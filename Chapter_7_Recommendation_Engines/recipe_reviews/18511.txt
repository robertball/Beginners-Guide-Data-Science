Made both as written and with a small change.  I like the cream of mushroom soup better than the chicken.  I also omit the topping, just because I never seem to have crushed cornflakes, and it is perfectly fine w/o. Here's a tip on how to get it to mix better.  Make sure hash browns are thawed as per recipe instructions. Pour melted butter/margarine over the potatoes and mix.  Then add the cheese and mix.  Lastly add the rest of the ingredients.  It seems to mix faster and better for me this way.  It does need the full hour to cook or your onions will be crunchy.  I usually divide this in half between 2 smaller casseroles, eat one for dinner and freeze the other.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Update: 15/02/07 - Tried the suggestion of putting french fried onions on top instead of the cornflakes - absolutely awesome! Don't put in at the start though...put in last 10-15 min and cook uncovered (watch as they burn easily), I sprinkled some extra cheese on top with the onions and it was really good!

Very good with a few changes. You can use 1/4 cup of butter instead of the 1/2 cup. I baked it a full hour, I covered it for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15 so that the top gets crunchy. I put the corn flakes on top and drizzled the melted butter over them, saved washing another pan. Turned out great.

What I love about this recipe is its versatility. I browned a pound of sausage with the onion and added it to the mixture. Also since I only had half a cup of cheddar cheese, I shredded an additional cup & a half of processed cheese. I used mushroom soup instead of chicken, and I didn't have cornflakes, so nothing but a sprinkle of parmesan cheese went on the top. I also left off the additional 1/4 cup melted butter, and since the processed cheese is so salty, I only used 1/4 teaspoon salt. It was a delicious main dish and would make an excellent breakfast casserole. Our family of 3 had generous portions and only ate half the casserole. My husband, who never likes leftovers and is not crazy about anything in a casserole, loves the leftovers.

The only thing that I do different is to used crushed French's onions to the topping.  It adds just the right flavor.
Edit.  I started adding a small can of jalapenos to it.  Adds a great kick and more grown up flavor.

My family loves this recipe...I have to make it for every holiday.  I however do not saute my Corn Flakes.  I have noticed that it really needs no butter what so ever. Due to cheese cooking out a great deal of oil.  I now use Cambell soups new mushroom/cream of chicken soup....gives it a little twist. If you like potatoes and cheese your gonna love this!!

This is a household favorite.  I prefer to use the chunkier country style hashbrowns (chunks a little bigger than a pea) because they don't get as slimy as the shredded type.  I like to thaw these chunkier potatoes in the oven until they are just warm, they cook perfectly even & hold the shape & texture better.

I made this for Easter with the following modifications, and it came out perfectly: First, use two cans of condensed soup (I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom).  Secondly, defrost the hash browns totally before cooking. Third, sautee the chopped onion in 4 tbl. butter for about 3-4 minutes before adding onion mixture to the hash browns.  Fourth, use shredded colby cheese, not cheddar!  Cheddar is far too greasy, and that is part of the reason why some people think this is too soupy.  Fifth, bake covered at 350 for about 45 minutes then remove the foil and bake uncovered for about 45 more minutes.  The casserole will only slightly brown on top, it is unlikely to burn.  You may also want to turn the heat up to 375 if you think it is too soupy.  It will condense if you give it long enough to cook.  If you do all of the above, it will taste almost exactly like the Cracker Barrel's hash brown casserole.  Be sure to let it cool for about 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven as well, as that helps it solidify.

This is a holiday favorite! I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of cheddar cheese and 2 cups of grated parmesan cheese.  I stuck with the cream of chicken soup as my grandma always had, but this recipe is so versatile that any cream soup will do which is nice.  Everyone loves the cornflake topping, but again it's a matter of preference. This does take an hour in the oven even with the thawed hash browns.

Heaven!  I forgot to thaw the hashbrowns, so it took a little longer to cook, I also followed the recipe, as I am a purist, and don't understand why people bother to review recipes after they change all the ingredients??

Excellent! I used a little more cheese than called for and crushed potato chips instead of cornflakes (with no butter added) on top. I used reduced fat/healthy request soup, sour cream and cheese. I sauteed the onions in Pam before adding. A winner! Thank you.

This has been our family's "special occasion" side dish for years.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken.  Can easily be made a day or two ahead of time by not adding the corn flakes until you are ready to cook.  You can also save the step of sauting the corn flakes by just drizzling melted butter over the crushed flakes before cooking.  Sure, it has a few calories - - but that's why we serve it for special occasions!   Enjoy!

This casserole is wonderful! I made no changes whatsoever and it turned out fantastic. It freezes great too- this actually sat in the freezer, forgotten after our baby's birth, for several months and it was still delicious after all that time. We especially loved the cornflakes on top. Great recipe!

Cooked in a 4 qt crockpot for 4 hours on high (omitted the topping and halved the butter). Delicious! Formed a nice brown crust, even in the crockpot.

Wonderful!  I have shared this recipe with almost everyone that attended my Christmas dinner.  This was a hit!  

What I did differently---I mixed cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup and I put my cereal on top and then drizzled the butter over it. 

I have 'adapted' it for a breakfast recipe by adding either bacon, sausage or ham, mushrooms, and a little extra cheese.  I have also topped it with parmesean cheese instead of the cereal.  

Wonderful recipe--thanks for sharing!!

My guests loved the recipe, but I did not.  The potatoes seemed to be too hard, I used the little chunks of hash brown potatoes, and maybe I should have used the shredded potatoes.  The sour cream taste was too powerful, and because my guests liked it so much, I will make it again, but use less sour cream.  The other change I think I'll make is to bake the hash brown potatoes prior to placing them into the casserole, and maybe the potatoes can cook better.

I'm all for easy.  I add 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix.  Don't have to bother with the onion prep this way and the onion soup mix gives the potatoes a nice zippy taste.  Everybody always asks what's in my potatoes. They know there's something extra, but can never figure it out.  If you use the soup mix don't add any salt, it is not needed.  Also I never use butter, the cheese adds enough oil.  Plus I use fat free sour cream and heathy request cream of mushroom soup.   I don't usually add any topping, but if I do fried onions are the preferred topping in my house.

My mom used to make this recipe when I was little.  I loved it.  After I left home for university I pretty much forgot about it and how much I liked it.  Then one day I suddenly got a craving for it.  I searched on this website to find a recipe and chose this one.  I'm glad I did.  It tastes exactly the way I remember it.  I made it a few weeks later for a pot luck.  People were confused about it at first, but once they tried it most went back for seconds.  It is a great recipe and when I eat it, it brings back fond memories.

Don't use fresh potatoes. Tried multiple times. Just can't duplicate the partially cooked, partially dried potatoes that are commercially prepared. They are essential to the success of this recipe.

I have been making variations of this recipe for the last 25 years. I could tell from reading the ingredients in this one that it would be too dry (as many reviews mentioned). The casserole should be moist when put in the oven.

If this amount of potatoes are used, there should be two cans of cream of chicken or mushroom soup - or, include milk in the recipe (approximately the same amount as the second can of soup). 

I have never used regular onions in this recipe, but if they are used, certainly they need to be sauteed first so they cook thoroughly. I have always used green onions, both the whites and green stems, chopped very finely (4-5 green onions). They don't need to be sauteed if the whites are chopped finely and they provide a great savory flavor to the dish.

I also always use fresh garlic - perhaps 2 medium to large cloves chopped very fine. I used fresh ground pepper too.

These changes give it more flavor rather than just loading up on the fat content and having it be a very rich dish. It will never be a healthy dish, but adding more sour cream and butter is not the answer to getting more flavor.

I frequently cut the sour cream back and replace it with low-fat, small-curd creamy cottage cheese or ricotta cheese. You won't know it's in there.

Lots of crushed cornflakes are critical for the top (about 2 cups or even more, plus some butter drizzled over the top). Bake with the top off all the way through - they will be crispy and they make the dish. Don't replace!

Wow! We hosted a buffet for 24 people and needed an easy but good potato casserole. This will become a regular for my holiday and special events menus. I made three pans of this and had to scrape the sides to get a little bit for myself - people raved and ate and ate. The only changes I made were to leave out the butter and I used low-fat sour cream with chives. I had to improvise for the topping since I was sure I had corn flakes (nope) or Durkee's onions (nope again). I sauteed some Italian bread crumbs in about 2 tablespoons of butter and it turned out great. DH said it was better than Cracker Barrel's potato casserole - great praise, indeed. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is pretty good as written, but has a lot of unnecessary butter in it.  I make a casserole very similar to this one, and I can tell you that the 1/2 cup of melted butter stirred into the potatoes is just overkill.  You can use cream of chicken, mushroom or celery soup, and with the sour cream, there is plenty of moisture and no need to mix in butter.  Also, I use 2 tablespoons of dried minced onion instead of the chopped onion.  It adds all of the flavor without the pieces of onion that my kids don't appreciate!  I use sharp cheddar cheese, and drizzle 1/2 cup of melted butter over 3 cups of crushed corn flakes instead of two, and use a 13x9 pan. Bake uncovered for 1 hour. Yummo!!

I used two packages of Trader Joe's Roasted Potatoes with Roasted Peppers & Onions instead of frozen hash brown potatoes, Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom soup(Reduced Fat) instead of condensed cream of chicken soup, fat-free sour cream and one cup of Sargento's reduced-fat shredded Mexican four cheese instead of two cups of cheddar cheese. I sauteed two cups of Total cereal in cooking spray instead of butter. The casserole came out lighter and in my opinion, more consciously satisfying than the original version.

This is a 5 star recipe - nothing less. I made this recipe a few months substituting 3 tablespoons of minced onion in place of the real onions. Since then I have been asked to make it approximately 20 times. It gets entirely eaten everywhere I take it. Mine seems to be al little better if I increase the cooking time to 50 minutes. Thank you Courtney for submitting this recipe. My family and co-workers love this stuff!

Is this something you can make-ahead and freeze? Also..when you do freeze, should you cook first then freeze? Or just throw the ingredients together and then freeze without cooking? THANKS!

Try using hash browns O'Brian, instead of plain frozen hash browns.This will cut down on the amount of onions that you have to chop and the green bell peppers add color and allot of extra flavor.

A recipes VERY similar to this has been in my family for YEARS. It was a  major favorite of mine as a kid, to the point that the recipe card at my mom's house reads "Jennifer's Favorite Potatoes." :) Over the years I have done some tweaking and have a few tips for what I consider perfection. First, it is important that the hash browns are thawed as much as possible. (It's a great make ahead dish if they aren't thawed though. You can make it up and set in the fridge until ready to bake.) If you use shredded hash browns it's more important that they are thawed and I have found they even need a bit longer to bake. I mix the potatoes with 4 tsp dried onion (but fresh is fine too) and 2 cups shredded cheddar. I then melt 1 stick butter/margarine in the microwave. I mix in the chicken soup... it's a must to NOT use reduced-fat version... and one cup sour cream (you CAN get by with reduced fat here). I then add the soup mixture to the potatoes and mix well. Spread into a 9x13 dish. Sprinkle with corn flakes (some people like potato chips ?? ) and pour 1/2 stick melted butter over the top. Bake a FULL hour at 350. You will constantly get rave reviews!

I have been making this dish forever.  It's my standard for potlucks or get togethers.  (and there are usually about 3 of these on the table) My mom makes this for Christmas Eve dinner, and we have the leftovers on the  Christmas brunch buffet.  My husband's absolute all time favorite potato dish.  He could eat this every night of the week and never tire of it!  When I make it I omit the onions and use onion powder. (my kids hate crunchy onions)

This is one of my all time faves! I am currently getting ready to make it for 75 people...most of wich are young teenage moms...they love it!  I do change it around...just a little to make it more convienent. I use one can of cream of whatever I have on hand and one can of condensed cheddar cheese for the soups.  I still throw in shredded cheese. Also, I omit the sour cream and the onions and replace it with french onion dip...essentially the same flavor with out the crunchy onioins and extra time.  It is also very easy to make for a huge crowd!

I love this dish! Have made it numerous times with variations such as light sour cream, monterey jack cheese or reduced fat cream of chicken and everyone still raves about it! Only thing I changed was I cooked the chopped onion in some butter before I added to the mixture.

I made this recipe as is, and I give it 5 stars.  Sometimes I need to change a few things in a recipe, but if you're like me, you want to know what the recipes is like AS IT WAS WRITTEN!  I can tell you that this one is WONDERFUL!  My husband "ooh'ed" and "ahh'ed" over it (more than some of the more elaborate meals that I make).  It's a nice, warm casserole.. perfect for those cold nights!  The cornflake crunch was a GREAT touch for the texture. My 3 year old and 19 month old gobbled it up. I'm actually making this again TONIGHT!

This was good - I've made a few of these before and I think this was the best one.  I think I might use Cream of Mushroom soup next time though ....

Great recipe.   However, I did not use the corn flakes, simply because I don't care for the crunchy texture.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always a big hit.  You really don't need to add any melted butter to the potato mixture (definitely not 1/2 cup) and they will still turn out great.  It's a good make ahead recipe.  I make the day before and keep refrigerated.  If you do this, set it on the counter for about an hour before baking to take the chill off if you have the time so they will heat quicker.  You may need to bake longer if really cold.

This is one of the BEST potato casseroles I've ever had. I made this for a fundraiser so I doubled the recipe. Only changes I made were only using 1/2 c. butter (doubled recipe) and used no butter on top of the cornflakes. Only downfall, is was TOO good. I didn't even get a helping, it was all gone by the time I got sat down. Will definitely be a staple in this house.

I shredded two pounds of fresh potatoes and half a small onion (might as well use the new Cuisinart) that I soaked in lightly garlic salted cold water until I was ready to put everything else together then dried it. I used a high quality sharp cheddar cheese, and real sour cream, but used the lower fat and salt soup.  I also did not mix in the melted butter, but instead rubbed the inside of the casserole with a stick of butter until there was a thick layer of it all over the glass and then put my potato mixture in.  The cheese and sour cream was moist enough.  Everyone loved the way the outside crusted up with my modifications.  As other reviewers suggested, I doubled up on the fried crushed cornflake mixture.  

While it was cooking, the aroma had my husband climbing up the walls, begging me to give him a scoop to eat before I brought them over to my parent's Thanksgiving.  But it was too pretty to break up and I told him to wait until I returned from the party with a plate for him.  We had some of my sister's foreign college students join for their very first American Thanksgiving.   They begged us to take the leftover potatoes back to their dorms.  I returned empty handed and had to whip up a second fresh batch for my husband and stepson the next morning for there breakfast.   

I have never had so many people beg for leftovers.  I probably will not be allowed to bring anything else to the next family gathering.

Excellent! I've made several variations of this recipe in the past, and they are all good. I prefer cream of mushroom over the cream of chicken condensed soup. In my opinion, it is the onions and the perfect amount of cheddar that makes this so good. I've also used reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat cheddar, and it still tastes quite good.

I used fresh potatoes instead of frozen and they worked great, but it needed a full hour+ to cook. This recipe was delicious!  My only complaint is that the potatoes were SWIMMING in grease - so much so that the crunchy topping was soggy (I used Panko breadcrumbs).  The 1/2 c. of butter the recipe calls for in the potato mixture is completely unnecessary. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and we ate it all up!

Excellent recipe.  We did make some changes though...  We omitted the 1/2 cup of onions from the recipe and also the corn flake topping.  Instead, we added 1/2 a can of French's fried onions to the potato mixture and then baked it for 40 minutes.  After 40 minutes we used the remaining French's onions to top the casserole and we baked it for an additional 10 minutes until golden brown.  This was a big hit with everyone.  This recipe should be eaten with caution....  It has enough fat in it to sustain a grizzly bear during hibernation.  Very tasty though!!

Having made this countless times, I can tell you that this recipe is definitely open to variations and substitions based on your preferences and what you happen to have on hand. IMHO, 2 cups of cheese isn't enough, so I double it, generally using a combo of cheddar & jack or  colby, or even parmesan. Instead of the cream of chicken, sometimes I'll sub out cheddar cheese soup, which is my favorite. I also like to sautee my onions and add a small can of diced chilies. That's a flavor combo I LOVE! The cornflake topping is classic (no need to sautee the flakes; simply melt the butter in a saucepan, add the cornflakes, stir, and add to the top of the casserole). French fried onions are great as well; I set my oven to broil and add them 2-3 minutes before done baking. Over the years, I've added sauteed green (or red) peppers as well. I've also used this as a breakfast casserole and added some maple breakfast sausage. The add-ins/possibilities are endless!  Use whatever you like - holds up well to changes.

I always get requests to make this! I omit the onions and used onion soup mix instead - mix it into the sour cream. I also use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. I'm surprised so many people omit the cornflake topping - its a must! Also use a sharp cheddar cheese!

This was truly yummy with a couple small changes: I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of chicken, used seasoned salt instead of plain salt, and added an additional cup of corn flakes on top. Could have used a bit more salt though. Beware: this recipe makes a HUGE casserole! It was filled to the brim of my largest mixing bowl, so it was a little hard to combine the ingredients well enough, but I managed. We ended up with enough for three different meals. By the way, it reheats very well.

I have to admit, I loved this, but I did change a few things. I too would prefer mushroom soup over chicken. I doubled the recipe and when I did, I doubled the cheese too. I used butter flavored cooking spray to grease my baking dish as well, which gave it a nice crispy-on-the-outside texture, and made cleaning a snap. I also followed the fried onions topping too. I didn't have any problems mixing it together, it just took a little time and I used a folding technique. I wonder if the quality of the frozen hash browns makes a difference? I'm thinking it does. My grocer was out of Ore-ida so I went with a slightly upper brand called Alexia Yukon Select Hashbrowns and man oh man. It was delicious and the potatoes didn't mash together. Those come in an odd weight and since I was doubling it anyway, I went with 3 bags. I hate to deliver the bad news to Cracker Barrel, but this one is clearly the winner. This is going to be my go to recipe for this type and it's clear that it will freeze beautifully. I can smell it on Christmas morning already! ;) I highly recommend it.

My entire family LOVED this recipe!!  I didn't change anything with my first pass, other than use the reduced fat sour cream and the healthy choice cream of chicken soup.  The next time I make it I will reduce the butter that I put into the mixture by half.  I think it could really cut out some unnecessary fat and calories without sacrificing the taste.  (Not that you should make this with the intent of it being a low fat dish!!!  It's just too decadent!!  But I do prefer to cut out some fat & calories whenever I can on any recipe.)  I will definitely be making this again, and it will become one of my "go-to" potluck and special occasion dishes!  Great recipe - thanks!

Everyone loved this dish! I was just finishing a green bean casserole when I started this one, so I added some leftover cream of mushroom to it in addition to the cream of chicken it calls for. I reserved some of the cheese to sprinkle on top and because I didn't have any corn flakes on hand, I crushed some ritz crackers and sprinkled that on top. Simple but delicious!

I made this recipe without adding any of the butter to the mixture (only a little on top to help brown the topping), and it was delicious and creamy.  This recipe really doesn't require the added fat and calories of the butter.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good but kind of heavy.  I did not really care for the corn flakes.  They were soggy since the recipe called for baking the casserole covered.  If I use corn flakes again I will leave the dish uncovered for the last 5-10 minutes of baking so they can crisp up.  Also, personally I thought the onions were too much.  I will make this again but with less onions and crisper corn flakes.

I skipped the cereal(???)and the butter you're supposed to saute' it in. I cut amount of butter used in the rest of the recipe in half.  To cut back on fat I used light cheddar, sour cream and soup. Added about 1 tbsp garlic salt. Sprinkled top with parmesan. It was still nice and rich tasting.  Family loved it. If you want a crunchy top, uncover the last 10 minutes.

This is almost the same recipe that my mother made me as a child. (she omitted the butter and it turned out fine) I have fine tuned this recipe and have made some improvements. If you don't like the cereal on top you can use cornbread stuffing instead. It adds a LOT of flavor! Plus you can also make this in a crock pot!

I am rating this recipe as written.  I would suggest cutting the butter by half, as I had to take a paper towel and dab the puddles of melted butter that had floated to the top.  Otherwise, a good recipe.  I also tried with french fried onions, another good suggestion from another reader.

Have tried similar recipes in the past and was disappointed but this one is great.  I used frozen O'Brien hashbrowns (with onions and bell peppers).  Not a big fan of frozen potatoes.   Next time I might bake potatoes and dice them up.
I also used green onions to add color and gave it a nice taste.  I would also recommend cutting the butter in 1/2 as recommended by others as well.

This is one of our favorite meals for breakfast.  I cook breakfast sausage and mix it in with the rest of the ingredients and instead of cornflakes, I use crushed Ritz crackers.  It's a family favorite!

Excellent!  I made it a day ahead of time and covered it and stuck it in the fridge.  The next day I baked it for about an hour and 15 minutes total, putting the cornflakes on top half way through and it turned out great.  I really liked the cornflake topping but it was greasy so I would use less butter while sauteing or no butter at all.

My husband adores this stuff!  Also called Texas Potatoes around here!  We have an understanding that this is made at least twice a month!  I always add extra garlic powder and let it sit overnight before baking, it's soooo much better the next day!

This turned out really yummy!  I used light sour cream, light old cheddar & half fat cream of chicken.  I had to use half cheddar and half mozza (ran out of cheddar).  I decided to try it with the French's onions instead of cornflakes and man it was delicious!  I baked it lid on for 45 then sprinkled with the onions and baked uncovered for about 15 mins.  Could have actually stayed in the oven a little longer.  Will definetely be making this one again.

LOVED this dish!  Served to two other couples tonight with pork tenderloin & everyone said they liked it.  Heard that it was creamier than one had made with her recipe that is similar.  I used cheddar cheese & I see what on revier said about a little greasy, but we let it sit on top of the stove for a bit when it came out of the oven & I think that helped.  I will be making this again for sure!  Definatly a keeper for our house!  Thanks for posting!  Very easy to make!  Oh, I did only need 1 1lb bag of potatoes, there was no way you needed 2 lbs of potatos!  Also used cream of mushroom soup...

AWESOME RECIPE! This one deserves even more than 5 stars! I've made it several times; each and every time to rave reviews. I've read some others comments about omitting the crushed cornflake topping... in my opinion, this would be a HUGE mistake! The delicious, buttery, crunchy taste really adds a whole new dimension to what would otherwise be just an ordinary, typical hash brown casserole. Just follow this one as written and you cannot go wrong. Great for potluck dinners and good enough for company!

This is such a great potatoe dish!  Cream of mushroom soup works equally well, and I always use non-fat sour cream.  The last time I made this, I was out of conrflakes, so I just sprinkled the top with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The end result was a yummy casserole that my guests absolute devoured!

My family loved this recipe!  Well, my 6 yr old liked it, but that's a huge thing in this household.  I took the advice of another reviewer, and used french fried onions as a topping, rather than the cornflakes.  It was a hit.

This is comfort food at it's finest.  I would absolutely suggest thawing the hash browns first, otherwise you'll have a runny casserole.

I was looking forward to this recipe. All the ingredients were something my family likes.  I did saute the onions which I think helped the casserole. However, my family rated this recipe a  2. The casserole had an overpowering sour cream taste. Perhaps, finding a substitute for the sour cream such as half and half might help.  Also, my family didn't care for the corn flakes on top.

The reason I gave this only 3 stars is because I really didn't like this version. First off I love the hashbrown casserole from Cracker Barrel and thought this was just like it. Well, it wasn't. The sour cream was not needed. AT ALL. I did this recipe without the sour cream and it was much better. Actually, I only used 2 tbls butter and omitted the sour cream and the cornflake topping. baked it at 425 for 1 hour and it turned out exactly like Cracker Barrel's.

I made just a few changes to this recipe.  I didn't have cream of mushroom or chicken soup, so I used 1 can of cream of potato and 1 can of cream of broccoli.  I used chopped chives instead of onions, since I had some in the fridge.  I also added about half a cup of bacon bits (not the crunchy Bacos kind).  

I used the same amount of sour cream, salt and pepper, cheese and hash browns.  Put in a sprayed casserole dish and baked, covered with foil, in a 350 degree oven for about an hour and a half.  

It was the PERFECT consistency - not soupy, didn't stick/burn to the dish.  Great flavor from the broccoli soup and bacon bits.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it and I plan to make it again and again - especially with holiday potlucks coming up!

This is one of my most favorite things to eat. We call them funeral potatoes where I live. Save time by just putting the corn flakes on top and drizzle melted butter on top. One less pan to wash. I also uncover it after the 40 minutes and cook for another 10 to make corn flakes crispy and brown. My mouth is watering!

WOW... this is such an easy recipe to make and it tastes so good!!  Talk about comfort food on a rainy afternoon.  I normally don't measure ingredients, so I "eye-balled" this one and it came out fantastic.  The only changes I made were bread crumbs (no extra butter) with seasonings on top (didn't have corn flakes) and I swapped out the onions for 2 Tbsp-ish of minced garlic... I'm a firm believer that you can't have too much garlic!  This casserole came out just the right consistency and had a creamy flavor without being rich.  You could use the full fat ingredients, but I figured the first time would be with 98% fat free soup and fat free sour cream... that way I can still alter it if needed, and there's no need to.  Very yummy, thank you for sharing!!

This is really yummy! I didn't have any frozen hash browns so I shredded some potatoes and rinsed the starch from them. Also instead of using cornflakes for the top I used French's onions.

Awesome recipe - makes enough for two nights for this large family.  I didn't have a 3 quart casserole dish so I used a 9x13 pan. You can halve the recipe and make it in an 8x8 square pan if you need to.  I also didn't have cornflakes, so I toasted two cups of panko bread crumbs in 1/4 cup of butter for the topping.  I also added some smoked paprika and garlic salt to the potato mixture.  DELICIOUS!  Will definitely make again.

Very yummy!  A family favorite.  Two small changes I do (only after I made it the first time according to the directions.) I like to saute the onions first.  Also, I bake for the 40 minutes covered without the cornflakes, than add them and bake uncovered for another 10 minutes.

Delicious!!  Everyone loved it. I followed the directions exactly.  One caution: because most of the major brands, OreIda, for example, makes hashbrowns in bag sizes just under 2 pounds, you can definitely cut down on the amount of butter.  I'd recommend 1/4 of a cup, or half a stick, instead of the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe. Otherwise, fantastic!!!

This was delicious but i do think it should be called "heart attack waiting to happen". It was so rich but thankfully it is very filling so i didn't overdue it.  I did use light sour cream and reduced fat soup. I also reduced the butter slightly.  The cornflakes give it a nice crunch that my daughter found appealing.

my family and I did not care for this. and we have never not liked a casserole with a creamy soup and sour cream mixture! this was far too greasy – the amount butter needs to be cut down quite a bit. plenty of oils are released by the melted cheese. it was swimming in butter when it was done! also, the potatoes just did not taste right – they had an “uncooked” taste even though I let them thaw completely and cooked the casserole for a full hour rather than the suggested 40 minutes. perhaps this would be better if the hash browns were browned first. and the corn flake topping was chewy rather than crispy. I will look for another recipe…

Delicious!  I subbed cheddar cheese soup for the cream of chicken but that was the only change made. The whole family LOVED this and I dont think the leftovers will last long! I served with roast beef and veggies,  yum!

Such an indulgent treat to have cheesy hash-brown casserole.  My family loves this recipe but we only have it around the holidays.  I made this recipe as is with the exception of subbing the Rosemary Saltine crackers for corn flakes.  You definitely need a crunchy topping to break up the richness.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written. It turned out very nice, and was a hit at my dinner party. It is very rich, but that is pretty much why I chose this recipe to begin with. I will probably make a few changes the next time I make this. I will try cutting the butter in half both in the main dish and in the corn flake topping. Also, I want to try adding some dried sage or fresh thyme to this, because I think it would taste really good. Thyme really likes potatoes, and I think that is the route I will take. I used the southern style hash browns, which are small potato cubes rather than the shredded potatoes, mostly because the recipe called for 2 pounds not 1 pound 14 ounces.

Have made this for years, only without the extra butter in the potatoes. It isn't needed. A great recipe-a family favorite. Campbell's, Healthy Request soup and low-fat sour cream reduce the sodium and calories a little (You shouldn't skimp on cheese-we like extra sharp cheddar) I'll have to try the French Fried Onion topping as some have suggested. It really sounds good. 

I put all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir away with a wooden spoon. Periodic "stabbing" with the spoon helps break up the frozen chunks. Stick it in the refrigerator and bake the next day. It will take longer to bake if the potatoes are still frozen. I use a 9" X 13" Pyrex dish that has a rubber lid. Just put the dish in the oven (without the lid, of course) as it preheats so you don't wind up breaking the glass by placing a cold dish in a hot oven.

I got a wild hair and decided to use freshly grated potatoes. After that time intensive task, I then grated the cheese and soldiered on. La sigh. If any of you get this idea; I would suggest you either pre-cook the spuds and then grate or grate then pre-cook or you will be baking for a long time. Lol. Wow, was it worth it! I did use mushroom soup vs chicken as that was what I had. I also didn't have cornflakes so used panko. I did use all the butter but divided it up between the casserole and the panko on top. I'll be making this again with or w/o fresh potatoes. Thanks CMANSKY.

Excellent! I didn't have cornflakes, so I sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top and covered them with spray butter. Also added bacon! Yum!

Very good, enjoyed by all. The only change was to use celery salt instead of regular salt and I omitted the sour cream because we are not too keen on it. Also substituted crushed crackers for corn flakes because I didn't have any on hand.

This is a yummy crowd pleaser everybody looks forward to.  Two good options are to use frozen O'Brien potatoes (diced potatoes with onions, red and green peppers) which makes it look pretty too.  Another good option is to throw in a bag of real bacon bits.

This is a great recipe. I make it with just a couple of adjustments. I have found it is just as good without the 3/4 cup butter, so I leave that out and I also do not top with cornflakes, because I don't care for the texture they give to the dish. Thanks for posting!

I've been making a very similar one for years.  Only minor changes - first, I only use 1 lb of hash browns and 1/4 c melted butter. I used green onion instead of regular and added 1/4 cup of chopped red pepper.  I also cut the cheese in in half.  I didn't have corn flake crumbs, but I did have some crumbs from the bottom of my crouton bag and used those on top, without the added butter. This turns out VERY creamy.

This was a huge hit at our fall potluck!  it was the first thing to go!  I took the advice from readers and I used a can of the Campbells chicken and mushroom.  and cut the butter down. I also skipped the step of sauteing the cornflakes.  They they turned out a bit soggy...even after baking uncovered for 15min. (but i'm not sure if that's because i covered the dish right away out of the oven to transport).  so next time i might just add them at the end.

Adjusted to serve 110 for a funeral dinner and it was perfect! everyone loves this and other than adjusting the cook time to allow for the depth of the roasters and cutting back on the butter and salt it was just right. love it when I find a recipe that I can adjust for a large crowd!

This overall was a great fast and easy side dish for weeknight cooking, although I thought it was a little bland when prepared exactly as written.  Just out of personal preference, I added extra sour cream, chives, garlic, and asiago cheese.  It was really good on the first night, but the leftovers reheated were even better!

Delicious. Freezes well.  If you decide to freeze, be sure to defrost completely before putting in the oven.  UDATE 8/28/10:  Very forgiving recipe.  It is five stars following the recipe exactly.  I've changed it around a bit using cream of mushroom (and once cream of celery) instead of cream of chicken.  I've also added bacon.  I very seldom put the cornflakes on top anymore - delicious without them.  Love this recipe!

There are many versions of this recipe but I think this one is best. I will use fine bread crumbs and drizzle butter over the top if I don't have corn flakes on hand and it's just as good.

Absolutely delicious served with Honeybaked Ham for Christmas dinner.  Big hit with all ages.  I didn't have time to buy frozen potatoes and let them thaw, so I used Simply Potatoes from the refrigerator case.  I doubled the recipe but used three packages of potatoes (two shredded hash browns, one diced potatoes with onions) and it was PERFECT.  Used a combo of colby jack and sharp cheddar cheese.  The casserole took a full hour to bake in a stoneware 9x13.  Everyone - even the finicky kids - loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!  It will become a regular!

So delicious! Baked uncovered for 60 minutes. Did not saute cornflakes, just drizzled melted butter over cornflakes. Also increased sour cream to 12 oz.

At first glance this is a gawdawful 1950's casserole. It's my general rule of thumb not to cook things that use canned cream soups in combination with anything, especially so much dairy! ----However, I remember a friend's grandmother making this and loving it. I pushed my snobbishness aside and made this for a breakfast party -it was quite the rich creamy cheesy hit. Added about a teaspoon of paprika to topping. Required closer to an hour of cook time. I had seconds!

Make this all the time. Usually skip all the melted butter. I don't find it makes any difference and the cheese adds enough oil. There is no need to thaw the hashbrowns just bake for 1 hour instead and since I usually make with meatloaf that also takes an hour at the same temp. it works great. Also can use crush chips on top for crunch but I usually go without. I put half the cheese just on the top.

Yummy, my family loved this with the ham on Christmas Eve! I accidentally left out the melted butter (which I had reduced to only 1/4 cup) and didn't miss it at all! Next time I may add some parmesan cheese to the topping. This is a keeper.

Everyone at my house gave this dish a Big Thumbs Up! My teenage boys wanted a taste right out of the oven... they didn't want to wait for the rest of the meal. Even the neighborhood kids grabbed a fork and believe it or not when my one son turned his back, he left his dish at eye level for the dog and she enjoyed it as well. The only change that I made was that I didn't have corn flakes (only had frosted flakes) so I took 24 Ritz crackers and crushed them mixing with 4 tablespoons of melted butter and sprinkled on the top.

absolutely delicious!  i love how you mix all the ingredients first and then pour it into the casserole dish.  it tastes much better.  i tried another one that called for sprinkling chceese on top and that one tasted awful.  be sure your hash brown potatoes are more frozen than thawed.  also - did not use cornflakes, but i'm sure it would taste just as delicious.

Wonderful recipe! The only change I made was to use cream of celery soup because my mother is a vegetarian. The meat-eaters didn't seem to notice one bit!

Very easy to assemble ahead of time and then cook later. I made mine yesterday and just popped it in the oven while I made the rest of my brunch. I think 40 minutes is a little optimistic for a cooking time to get it hot all the way through, especially if your hashbrowns are frozen though. Everybody enjoys this. Usually I saute the onion in some of the butter before adding because I like a milder onion flavor.

This is one of my favorites.  I don't saute the cornflakes - I just put them on top of the casserole and drizzle the butter over them.  Then, I bake it UNcovered for about 45-50 minutes.  I always get requests for this at family dinners!

This recipe was very good.  Everyone loved it.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken soup and I did not use the butter.  I will add this one to my menu for our family Christmas brunch.

Highly recommended.  Very tasty, and quite popular at the Christmas brunch.  I would double the amount of cornflake topping, it's the best part!  Easy to prepare for a big crowd.

I cut the recipe down A LOT and it was still AMAZING! The bag of hash browns I purchased was only 1 lb, the recipe calls for two but its only me and my two children (8 & 3 yrs old) so that was way too much. I used 1/2 a lb of hash browns, no butter at all - so i'd say its not necessary. Also i didn't have Corn Flakes on hand. I chopped onions very small, browned a pound of ground beef, added salt & pepper, 1/2 can of Cream of Chicken, about 4 tbsp of sour cream, and 1 cup of cheese. Mixed it all in a bowl, placed in dish, topped with more cheese (I love cheese!) , covered and baked for exactly 40min, then baked an extra 5 min uncovered! You can do so much with this recipe!!! Kids loved it as well as a guest I had over!!!

Just made this for Thanksgiving and everyone said it was the best cheesy potato recipe they ever tasted. As suggested by the other reviewers, I did reduce the butter to 1/4 cup and made sure the hash browns were thawed.  For the topping,I just melted butter in the microwave, stirred it into the corn flakes, and then sprinkled them over the top. I baked it covered with foil for about 45 minutes and then baked uncovered until the top and edges were brown. Delicious!!!!

To cut out some of the calories/fat I substitute the 1/2 cup butter with a 1/2 of vegetable broth. Keeps it moist and I can't tell the difference!

The whole family liked this. I can't remember for sure, because I didn't put my review in right away after making, but I think I used less butter and I know I used Japanese Panko bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes for topping. I toasted them on the stove with a little butter and spread on top before baking.

Heaven!I didn't have time to thaw the hashbrowns, so instead I put a couple Tbs oil in a large frying pan, threw in the hashbrown and browned them.  Then instead of melting the butter, I just threw it in and it melted with the potatoes, stirred in cream of mushroom (instead of chix), and the remaining ingredients.  Popped in oven in covered dish for 30 mins, then uncovered and added the rest of the cheese and the cornflakes for another 15 mins.  I tasted it before serving to my family and one taste turned into 7 before I finally could break away from it!  Served with Ham steak, Hollandaise sauce covered asparagus, and Hot fudge sundaes.  (It was "H" night this week.  Gotta start looking for "I" foods now!)

Love this recipe! I follow it almost exactly, except I don't like mushrooms and I don't eat chicken so I replace the can of cream of chicken with a can of cream of potato. It's absolutley delish! I love the cornflakes on the top. Always have to wait till last five minutes though to put them on, or they will burn. :)

I made this with 6T of butter instead of a 1/2C (mainly because it was there and I didn't figure it'd make a difference).  I also left off the cornflakes because I don't have any.  I noticed after the casserole was done that I was supposed to cover it; I baked it uncovered.  I also did a full hour as other reviewers suggested.  This is AMAZING!  I'm taking this one to a potluck, but I'm going to make another one with browned pork breakfast sausage and maybe some spinach for breakfast one morning.

Used 2 one pound packages of hash browns that were already seasoned with seasoned salt so didn't add additional salt. I am not sure what happened with those who say the recipe is "bland" unless they are diluting the soup before adding. Good flavor - way too much fat so we won't be making too often but we really liked it.

First of all, you need to spray your pan!  I halfed this and it was just o.k.  It was pretty dry.  If you follow the recipe on the back of the Ore-Ida hash browns, I think that would be better than this one.

Made this recipe with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and used milk instead of sour cream. Also, put cheese on top instead of cornflakes. It turned out to be absolutely AMAZING! Best Hash Brown casserole I have ever had!

This was GREAT! Although i should have read the reviews before and completely taken out the melted butter. Had no cornflakes but i did add cooked and crumbled bacon and for kicks and giggles put in chopped pepperoni. It was good but a little greasy.

A lady that I worked with made a casserole similar to this and I loved it!! I thought that I would make this casserole and it would taste like hers but it didnt...I wasnt too impressed with this.I made this as a side dish at a cookout and it didnt get ate. I think the onions were too overpowering..I will try cream of mushroom soup next time and use more salt because it was bland..I made the recipe as stated. I will give this one more try and tweek the ingredients.

This was a perfect way to transform ho-hum hashbrowns, and would be a great base for a meal. Like some other reviewers, I cut the butter in half and omitted the cornflakes. Also, I added a package of fresh mushrooms which paired nicely (probably could have used two). Many thanks!

I am eating this right now. Made pretty much as per the recipe except I used chicken flavoured stove top stuffing as the topping. I baked for 45 minutes and the onions were crunchie but it was nice for texture. The stove top stuffing added more crunch as well, and you may be able to reduce the salt by adding the topping as it is salty itself. This is very nice comfort food. Thanks!

This was so good!! The only thing I did different was I used a can of Campbells Cream of Mushroom and Chicken Soup because thats all I had and since I didn't have enough cheddar cheese I used a little jalapeno cheese and I didn't use the corn flakes because I didn't have any.  The kids and my husband loved it. Will definetly make this again!

Everyone loves this super easy side dish!!! I normally leave out the onions, and only use melted butter mixed with the cornflakes (not inside). When I am not feeling lazy I saute onion and green bell pepper in butter and add that in. Yummy :)

Made some slight changes which I think did this wonders! I am guessing the original is just as good, but I loved it the way I made it so hard to go back. Changed the cheddar cheese to Velveeta and put panko bread crumbs on top because I didn't have corn flakes. Wonderful, will make again!!!

This is a good recipe. I left out the corn flakes just because I didn't want to have to buy a whole box and the majority of it go to waste. I also added some seasonings like garlic powder and onion salt. Really yummy!

Very good for potlucks!  This was one of the most popular side dishes at the family reunion.  I used Velveeta to please my kids and omitted the pepper.  I only added half a teaspoon of salt and thought that was plenty.  I melted all ingredients except for the potatoes on the stove and poured the sauce over the potatoes in the casserole dish.  A very good and easy dish.

This was a very easy side dish to make. Instead of the frozen shredded hash browns I used the southern style (diced) hash browns. I omitted the sauteed cornflakes, and used about 1-2 cups of panko bread crumbs. This dish was so delicious!!

Delicious with changes made from other reviewers.  Probably very good without changes but....the package of hash browns I had was only 1 lb 10 oz; I used cream of mushroom; I cooked the onions in butter before adding to mixture; no cornflakes on hand so I baked for 30 minutes, then added french fried onions and a light layer of cheese for the last 10 minutes.  GREAT.  could have had more hash browns but not to saucy as it was.  DH and 5 kids gave it a thumbs up, and I have only about 3 helpings left from a whole dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used Original Potato Chips instead of the Corn Flakes but only added them after baking so they would stay crunchy. The potato chips add saltiness and flavor and it was perfect. We all loved it and our guests asked for the recipe. A++ (94)

This is a very tasty dish.  I don't cover the casserole when I cook it so the top remains nice and crisp.  It's always the show stopper at my brunches.  My friends absolutely love this recipe!

I have this recipe from my mother in law, and like alot of you have to make it every holiday or my family would freak!  Cheesey potatoes they call them.. I dont' really measure the cheese put as much as you want, but be careful because the cheese will expel oils that may drip over the side of the dish.  Also, I don't like to top with alot of cheese because the potatoes then get soupy instead of gooey, cheesey.  OH! and this is one of the best dishes to prepare ahead of time, because it tastes even better the second time you bake them!

This is one of our family's favs. We don't normally use the cornflakes.  It is also great with diced ham mixed in to make it a main dish.  Also try it with the hash browns that are mixed with peppers, it's great!

I have been making this dish for at least 15 years and it's always a hit! one thing I do different is i never thaw the potatoes.  it becomes too soft.  I use the frozen Ore ida potatoes with onions and peppers.  Also, i have used the mushroom can soup and didn't like it as much as using the chicken soup.

I made this recipe for a baby shower brunch and it received rave reviews!!  Great texture and flavor.  I used "southern-style" hashbrowns.  Next time I will try the corn flakes without sauteing them in butter.

This was easy to make and it tasted great!  I used shredded hash brown potatoes and cream of mushroom soup.  I also used both cornflakes and the canned fried onions on the top.  I reduced the 1/2 cup butter to 1/4 cup and it was still yummy.  I brought it to a club breakfast and got requests for the recipe.  I will be making this one again!

Everybody in my family loved this recipe! My mom makes this dish at every family get togther. Instead of hashbrowns, I added a bag of Potatoes O'Brien, because they have onions, and green and red peppers. It gives this dish a little more flavor. I will definitley keep making this dish. Thank you so much!

I couldn't put my nose on what was different from what I've had in the past with this. Then I was talking to one of my friends and she uses double the sour cream.   I will do that next time! But very very yummy!

We love this recipe, not bland at all (with a few changes).  Use real butter, but cut back to 1/4 cup.  I used creamy onion soup instead of cream of chicken. 
Also instead of regular salt, increase to 2 teaspoons of "Morton's Nature's Season" seasoned salt (yes!! 2 teaspoons!!).  I also added 1 teaspoon of onion powder (NOT onion salt). Instead of chopped onion, I used a can of french fried onions as others had suggested, and put half in the casserole, half can as topping at the end of cooking.  

Heck, I ran out of time and just cooked in the microwave for 20 minutes, stirring a few times during the cooking process (that's another reason I used canned fried onions- regular chopped onions don't do well in microwave).  Put onions on the top and browned them in the broiler of the regular oven. Watch closely!! They will burn if you blink!

Simple and delicious!! What more can I say? I am not a chef, but this I can definitely cook. I only use butter to sautee the cornflakes, light sour cream, and fat free cream of chicken. Also, I only use half of the recipe--it fills up a full 9x13 pyrex casserole dish & feeds a lot of people. I now have the perfect item to bring to BBQs and for potlucks; effortless too!

Good. Husband loved it. Used the full 2lb bag of small cubed hashbrowns. Because I'm always looking to add some veggies into husbands meal, I put 2/3 of a package of baby carrots into the food processer (cut up nice and small)and added to the potato mixture. Great color!! I couldnt bring myself to add the butter so I omitted completly. Instead I added 2/3 cup of Ranch dressing with the one can of cream of Chix soup. Turned out great. Husband didnt even know there were carrots (he thought it was clumps of extra cheese).

I just made this last night and my husband loved it! I didn't use any butter or salt in the casserole itself and I used light sour cream. I also added an extra can of cream of chicken soup. To save time and dishes, I combined hash browns, soup, sour cream, and cheese right in a large glass baking dish. I put the dry cornflakes over the top and then drizzled melted butter on top of them. It turned out perfectly! I was worried that with the light sour cream it wouldn't freeze and re-heat well, but my husband had some for breakfast this morning and he said it was great. I will make this again!

So simple to make.  I made this dish as a side-dish, in addition to coleslaw for a breaded baked cod dinner.  I added red, yellow and green peppers for coloring.  I also used a colby/jack shredded cheese mix.  I baked 45 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered so the cornflakes could brown and get crispy. Very filling and tasty.  Will make again.

Used a can of cream of celery as well as a can of chicken soup. Added garlic powder, a couple of dashes of hot sauce and some celery seed. Didn't have corn flakes so I used French fried onions on top. Very good and easy to prepare.

Excellent recipe...I took two portions to a pot luck, and I got lots of good comments from it.  I was out of cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom instead.  It still tasted great.  The crunchiness of the cornflakes made this recipe!

I thought this was yummy.  It was gooey and cheesy - the perfect meatloaf partner. I omitted the sour cream (so it would reheat better), and I did not miss it at all.  There was way too much of the cornflake topping, though.  Next time I will either 1/2 the topping, or I will eliminate it entirely.  I don't feel that the topping was necessary.

This casserole's even better if you use potatoes o'brien instead of regular hash browns and green onions instead of regular ones.  I've tried to find a way to cut the fat in this, but the only way I've found you can help even a little without wrecking the flavor is by using light sour cream.

I expected this recipe to be much better, based on all the great reviews. I thought it was kind of bland and not as cheesy as I expected. I used cubed hash brown potatoes, instead of shredded. I think shredded potatoes might have gotten soggy or too soft. The crunchy topping was good.

This is a terrific recipe! We had a tailgate brunch prior to a football game last week. I put the casserole together with the exception of the topping the night before and refrigerated it overnight. The next morning, I applied the topping, baked it for 1 hour, and as soon as it was ready, wrapped it in towels and took it to the stadium.  It was GONE in a very short time! I will definitely do it again for the next tailgate party!

Yummy and easy to make! My 8 year old loved this!!! I decided not to saute the cornflakes as indicated and I just put them on top of the casserole and drizzled the butter on top and it turned out just fine! I made 2 dishes of this, 1 for tonight's meal and one in a dish to freeze to serve after my baby is born. This was yummy and a pure comfort food! Thanks so much Courtney!

Very good!! My husband loved it. We always go to cracker barrel (a local resteraunt) so he can have the hash brown casserole. This was just as good!! I did not do the topping, as I did not have the ingredients on hand. It was  fine without it,although next time I will try the french fried onions as several of the reviews suggested. a definate keeper.

These changes  make this casserole just perfect for my family and guests::  Use Cream of Onion or Cheese Soup, double the onion  to 1 C. and saute the onion with 1/4 C of butter before adding to the mixture.  I skip the extra 1/4  C of melted butter and use 16 oz of reduced fat or fat-free sour cream.  I skip the cornflakes, they just seem to get hard rather than crunchy.

I used only one bag (1 pound) of hash browns. So glad I didn’t use two pounds as suggested otherwise it would have been way too dry and tasteless. Also, I had to put it back in oven. It needs to cook longer than 40 minutes...more like an hour.

Same recipe I have been using for years and always popular whether serving with pulled pork or ribs for lunch/dinner or serving at breakfast.   If you don't have the corn flakes substitute with broken up Ritz or Townhouse crackers (not Saltines).  Also, make sure hash browns are completely thawed.

This is ome of my go-to recipes - especially cor pot-lucks.   Easy, adaptable and always delicious!  I rarely remember to thhaw the hashbrowns so now put butter, soup, sour cream and chees, onione, s&p on the bottom of a well-sprayed 9x13 pan and pile the frozen hashbrowns on top.  I then set my oven to 350 and pop the unstirred mixtuure into the oven to thaw the hashbrwons while the oven heats.  My butter is typically hard so this serves to melt it as well.  When my oven sounds that it has reached 350, I take the casserole out, stir and put back to cook for 45-60 minutes.  Works a charm!  Like other reviewers, I don't bother with the topping - I find it unnecessary and another fat addition.  I reduce the the 1/2c of butter to justiver 1/4 c and use no-fat sour cream.  Ive use all types of cheese in mixture in this casserole but find a sharp cheddar favorite.  Cream of chicken, mushroom, celery have all been enjoyed.

I just made this for the first time and it tastes awesome! I didn't put any cornflakes on top and I used a whole teaspoon of black pepper instead of 1/4 teaspoon. I also let it cook for about 1 hour covered and another 15-20 minutes uncovered. It is perfection!

Very easy to make and delicious. Made it for Christmas dinner. Great compliment to the ham. The only thing is, it takes a lot longer than 40 minutes to cook. Cooked mine for 1 hour covered. Another 15 minutes uncovers. Thanks for a great recipe.

SOOO EASY!  I love to find a recipe that I can quickly throw together after work.  I did make a couple of changes only because I used what I had on hand.  I used 1.5 cups SHARP cheddar cheese and 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  And instead of using salt/pepper, I used a generous amount of Mrs. Dash Original.  And I did not add the corn flake topping. It was absolutely delicious.  Both my husband and daughter asked for more, which is unusual for them.  My husband has even requested this instead of mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving.  I do recommend making a double batch if you have a hungry family.  The hash browns shrink quite a bit as they cook.

I've made this a few times and always make a few changes. I use tater tots and bake until crispy and golden brown, i use green onion( it's my family's fav)  and I use a can of cream of mushroom and roasted garlic as no one in my family cares for cream of chicken, also add lots of freshly cracked black pepper. It's a family fav especially for the holidays :)

I used cream of mushroom soup instead - very yummy!  I also browned the onions a bit for more flavour

I made this today and it got mixed reviews. Some thought it was fantastic and other thought it needed more work and perhaps more time in the oven.  I made a double batch and followed tips from past reviewers.  I eliminated the butter. I used three cans of soup (mushroom, chicken, and celery), which is what I had on hand.  I did not add a topping.  I let the potatoes thaw as suggested.  I mixed everything last night and baked the casserole today. After over 2 hours it was nowhere near done. I then cranked up the over to 385 and baked another hour.  It was brown around the edges, which provided some much needed texture. Some guest felt it still did not seem done.  Also, my sons felt it would have been more enjoyable had I used cream of cheddar soup in lieu of the ones I used.  I think I agree.  Also, I baked it in a round, deep dish instead of a 9x13 pan.  The depth may have influenced the cooking time and texture. I need a good potato recipe that will feed a crowd and will continue to work on this until I perfect it!

This is a huge hit every time I have made it -  both at home or at any function.  The first few times I made it, I was not a fan because, as another reviewer mentioned, the potatoes were still rather hard even after 1 hour of baking.  Last night I tried pre-cooking the potatoes in a baking pan sprayed with cooking spray for 20 minutes at 350.  Then allowing them to cool to room temp. first.  Then assembling the casserole.  That worked like a charm.  I could now give it 5 stars, as I enjoyed it as much as everyone else did!!  It's now a permanent dish for all of my pot lucks.

This is so good! My kids and husband loved it! I followed the recipe except for the topping. I didn't have cornflakes so I used panko crumbs in melted butter. It was good with and without any topping. I just may make this for thanksgiving as a side dish.

The given way was pretty good but the topping seemed just okay and the covering created an extra hassle. So my tips: use two cans of soup, finely dice your onions (I use about 1/4 of a yellow onion) and saute to soften them first (especially if you don't like onion), cut the butter to 4 tbsp (use it for your sauteing if you wish), omit the topping, use 2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. To save a few calories I sub light sour cream for regular and no one notices. I don't bother to thaw my potatoes I just cook for about an hour to hour and a half uncovered. When it gets brown I take it out and let is set for a few minutes to set up. This is a favorite in our household and we think it is better than Cracker Barrel.

I made this for a Easter family dinner today.  I doubled the entire recipe. I also used cream of mushroom instead and used 5 cans (instead of 2).  I also added a half block of velvita cheese, it was kind of bland so i added seasoning salt along with the regular salt. For the topping,  I used Italian bread crumbs. This was a huge hit and my dish was gone before everything else.  Several people asked for the recipe! If you bake it at 380º for 50 minutes it turned out perfect!

This is very good.  I use cream of mushroom than cream of chicken, because I just do not like cream of chicken.  I also sauteed the onions first before adding it to the dish.  I did add a 1 lb of brown breakfast sausage to it this morning to make this a breakfast dish.  It's a hit with my friends and family.  Thank you for a great recipe.

My boyfriend and I decided to have breakfast for dinner and it turned out great!  Only a couple of changes..I browned one package of Jimmy Deans Sage sausage and added that to the mixture.  Also, instead of making the cornflakes/butter mixture, I just crush some Ritz Crackers and sprinkle it on top.  That's definitely my favorite short cut!

Delicious and easy recipe. this time I used colby jack and buttered the crushed corn flake topping. Next time I'll use sharp cheddar, non-buttered topping and add some ham.

Really yummy and decadent. Used red onion and 1/2 green pepper diced fine, cream of mushroom soup reduced fat sour cream and used crushed whole wheat Ritz crackers instead of the corn flakes. Will definately make again. Thanks!

This was just wonderful! Tastes a lot like cracker barrel's potato casserole, but I think better! Made these changes: shredded 2lbs fresh red potatoes and 1 small onion in my food processor. Added 1 1/2 cups diced leftover ham from easter, cr. of mush soup, 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 swiss and 1/2 cheddar cheeses, with a little on top at the end. I microwaved the onions in the butter for 2 minutes to get them cooking and added with the rest of the ingredients. Oh yes and omitted the salt, it has plenty with the cheese and soup. Cooked 1 hour. I also didn't use the topping but I'm sure that would be good. Will add this to the recipe box as a keeper!

This is a great recipe for a side dish when grilling out for a crowd, everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe (it made a huge amount, which ended up being way more than I needed) and cooked it in a extra large disposable lasagna pan (had to increase the cooking time to an hour and 10 minutes).  I will definitely make it again, might decrease the butter a little (in an attempt to make it slightly healthier) and I think you could leave out the corn flake topping, I didn't think it really needed it.

Not low in calories ... but worth everyone!  My family didn't realize I was trading the traditional family recipe until they tasted it .... Wow, couldn't get enough, my son-in-laws aren't free with compliments but when I see them go back for third helpings I know it's a hit.

This is also one of our families favorite go-to recipes. I sometimes use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken if I don't have it and it works well also. This goes so nice with about everything and something you can put together before dinner. It keeps well in the frig for about a week or I freeze in smaller dishes for just the two of us. The cornflakes on the top is a must.

Yummy!  I only had cream of mushroom, so I used it with great results.  You could play with the type of cheese you use and adjust the salt to taste.  I think next time instead of frozen hash browns, I'll dice some red potatoes and parboil them.  And to be honest, the cornflake topping is not necessary!  Thank you for a tasty recipe!

I thought it was good.  It needed to be a bit creamier for me but all in all was good.  I will be making this again.  Maybe with a bit more liquid in it next time.

I made a few changes after reading other reviews.  Omitted the first 1/2c butter.  Used 1 (10.75oz) cr of chicken and 1/2 (10.75oz) cr of mushroom soup.  Instead of cornflakes, I used french fried onions.  I added yellow mustard and fried bacon, crumpled.  Awesome!

Took this to two different parties and was asked for the recipe both times, plus they were the first dish to disappear!  I did make a couple changes-I used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and I only used 1/4 cup of butter.

After preparing this recipe, I thought "there is no way we will eat all of this"!  WRONG!  It was gone in a flash.  I used Stove Top for the topping!

When making this, I combined a little of this recipe with another one.  I ommited the melted butter to the casserole.  Instead of using corn flakes, I crunched up Ritz crackers.  I think that next time I will use an extra half can of cream of chicken soup like another recipe called for.

Made this for a work breakfast, I cooked it right before and it kept hot for us to eat!  It travels very well.  I did omit the butter and the cornflake topping, and substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also used green onions and added some garlic powder and seasoning salt.  I brushed about 2 TBSP of melted butter on top before baking.  I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  My family loved this!  We added 1 1/2 cups diced ham and used Cream of Potato Soup.  It was so yummy!  If I wasn't serving it to kids I would have kicked it up with a little cayenne in the topping.

This  was  a big  hit at Christmas brunch ! Being vegetarian I  substituted the cream of  chicken soup to  Cream of Onion  and 1/4 cup of  onions  ... and the onion taste was  not  overpowering  ...this   I  will make  over  and over  again

This was great.  I did not use ham because I am a vegetarian and it still came out great.  I also replaced the chicken soup with cream of mushroom.  Also, instead of corn flakes I used butter sauteed panko  because that is what I had available.  I think corn flakes would be good too.

Oh my gosh, I added sliced turkey polish sausage and it was a really good meal!  I left out all the butter, too much butter!  You can sub light plain yogurt for the sour cream.  I even forgot the cheese once and it was yummy!  I also added diced green chiles.

I made this today and it was fantastic!! I changed around some of the ingredients and it was amazing. Instead of chicken soup I used cream of cheddar cheese (great veggie option) and added mozzarella cheese in small cubes. Amazing!!

So delicious. Used half a cup more of cheddar. Didn't have cornflakes so eliminated that plus the extra butter to go w/them. Used cream of mushroom instead of chicken. The hash browns I had was a 1.75 lb bag but that ended up being perfect.

Instead of sour cream I always use French onion dip (prarie farms is the best) and add the french fried onions on top during the last 10 minutes of baking.

I bought the cubed hashed brown potatoes by mistake, as well as cream of mushroom soup (oops).  I sauted my onion in 1/4 cup butter instead of the 1/2 called for.  I used dried toast instead of cornflakes for the topping.  It was beyond excellent--perfect for Father's Day.  Thanks!

I've made this casserole per the recipe twice, with it coming out a bit greasy because of the butter. So, I halved the butter, eliminated the topping and added a pound of cubed cooked ham to make this into a main dish casserole. It comes out wonderfully!

I used cubed hashbrowns, as this is what I had on hand.  I added some garlic powder and some chipotle tobasco sauce, also. Note, it took 65 minutes to cook mine, but this may be due to the cubed hashbrowns.  We had guests for dinner, and they raved over it, so I gave them a copy of the recipe with my additions penned in.

The first night It was a 3 star recipe.  Then  i added precooked ground beef.  After I reheated it on the stovetop, letting it bubble a bit, in olive oil.  Delicious!

I've been making this for years. Everyone loves it! I use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and I use crushed potato chips in place of cornflakes. I do not use the 1/2 cup butter in the mixture. I crush my chips, put them on top of the casserole, and drizzle with a stick of melted butter. I sometimes also add parmesan cheese or even paprika to the top. Also, if you forgot to thaw your hash browns, don't worry. Just cook it a bit longer.

Used only 1/4 cup butter and it was plenty. Added 1 tsp habanero hot sauce and topped with crumbled potato chips the last 15 minutes. My guests LOVED the addition of the hot sauce.

EXCELLENT! I made this on Christmas morning. People got really quiet and wouldn't stop eating. Then, they had seconds. After reading all the reviews here are the changes I made. I substituted the cream of chicken for mushroom. Used french fried onions instead of cornflakes (I put it in the last 10-15 min, so they don't burn). I sprinkled some extra cheese on top of the french fried onions. This is definately a keeper in my brunch collection. THANKS CMANSKY and ALLRECIPES

I am so excited that I finally found this recipe! This was served with lots of meals at my grandmothers house and I haven't had it for years. When I made it I didn't have the corn flakes on hand so I left them out, it was good but I prefer them on for the crunchy texture. Thanks for the recipe.

Fast to throw together and yummy for such a basic dish! Using a "premium" cheese, like a Gruyere or a nice aged cheddar, kicks the dish up just a bit more. The second time, I added 1/2 cup milk to the sauce mix and (as others suggested) used half the butter. Using reduced-fat soups also cuts some fat calories, if you're into that. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent recipe! Can be done with the cubed potatoes or shreds. I don't do the topping and it's still awesome. A little tip - the more firmly you pack the casserole (smoosh it down) the quicker and more evenly it will cook - but I still have to cook it for over an hour, especially when I do it in one large dish (I often break it into two smaller and freeze one for later!) A family favorite in my house! Thanks!

This was very good, I made a few changes and it was so yummy. I used a can of chedder cheese soup, and a can of Chedder cheese and broccoli soup. I also added cubed ham, to make it a one dish casserole for dinner. It was so good, and melted in your mouth. My children loved it (I have very picky eaters all boys ages 5,3, and 1) and they ate every bite and the oldest asked for seconds..lol..I did use Colby jack shredded cheese, along with chedder on top as we like cheese, and I sauteed the onions. Very very good! This is a keeper in our house!

This recipe is quick and easy - followed it as stated. I put mine in a 13x9 baking dish and it came out great.  A little much for my husband and myself so I froze the balance and we ate at a later date.  Freezes GREAT!

I accidentally picked up the shredded hashbrowns that have onions,and red & green bell peppers already in them, and the cream of mushroom soup with garlic.  While I was grocery shopping to make this casserole.  Let me tell you what I made it the first time w/the above ingredients and it was AWESOME!!!  I made it again tonight w/the proper ingredients and found it a little more bland!!  So, maybe ya'll might like to give the mistake ingredients I purchased a try and see how you like it?  Yummy!!!

This is so good. I did not make the 12 servings(as it is written) thank Goodness allrecipes has the calculator. NOW I wish I had made the 12 servings. My family loved it. I only added one thing the ritz buttered crackers to the top. My husband was caught eating the leftovers for breakfast :)

Delicious and easy.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using Mushroom soup instead of chicken as others suggested.  I will try the french fried onion on top sometime.

Good stuff. Everyone gobbled it up for Easter dinner. I used cream of celery, added diced red peppers and instead of corn flakes i did the french fried onions on top... baked it for an hour as 40 minutes didn't seem to be enough. I'll be making this one again, for sure. Thanks for sharing!

I used 3 skinned and sliced potatoes and cooked 400 degrees for 1 hour. Also, I only used 2 Tablespoons of butter for the potatoes and 2 Tablespoons of butter for the topping. I figured the Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup would be salty enough so omited the extra salt. Last but not least, I used 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese with 1/2 cup of Mammoth Cheese/Smoked Cheddar mixture. This turned out VERY VERY GOOD!

We LOVE this recipe! I make a few changes that we prefer, but I'm sure it is excellent as is as well.  I use the southern style hashbrowns (cubes), cream of mushroom soup, and ritz crackers instead of cornflakes.  I leave everything else exactly the same.  This is so fattening, but so yummy!

Good recipe though mine turned out too salty. Next time I will reduce the salt significantly and let people add it after according to their taste. I also prefer this recipe without the cereal topping and it works great.

This recipe was very good!  The only thing that I changed was instead of using cornflakes I used French's Onions on top and added them the last 15 minutes.  My husband says this is a keeper!

Amazingly versatile & easy!  I added green onion & chopped ham to make it an entree.  The recipe is easy to double or half.  You can't go wrong with this!  I did use colby jack cheese because I agree that cheddar can be greasier sometimes.  This is excellent & is now a staple!

Started by downsizeing to 4 servings. Then used O'Brian Potatoes and Cream of Potatoe Soup, and instead of raw onion, used 3 teaspoons of dried onions. For the topping I used crushed Ritz Crackers sauteed in the butter. It all came out great and the wife loved it with our dinner of meatloaf slices topped with the Provincial Tomatoes (from this site) and the Creamy Pea Salad (also from this site). This is also a definite keeper

You will definetely feel a little more comfortable after eating this casserole.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead.  All the picky meat and potato guys in my family loved this.

This was a very good recipe. I did  make a few small changes to it.  I used cream of celery soup, mexican blend cheese,a cubanelle pepper, potato chips for the top and added garlic powder to it also. I loved the way it turned out.  There are so many things that you can do to this recipe, and it would be wonderful any way.

Very yummy with these changes: HALF the butter is plenty. No extra salt needed!! I prefer the cubed frozen potatoes to the shredded hash browns. For fresh onion, 2 Tbsp. of dry minced onion was easier and not too strong. The pepper adds a lot of flavor, and while I usually use cream of mushroom, this time I used and preferred cream of chicken.

Loved it! Even the picky eater ate it. He looked at it and didn't want to try it, but once he did, he was hooked. The only changes I made were to use cream of potato soup (it's what I had on hand), I cooked it for an hour and I used french fried onions on top. I can't wait to have the leftovers!

A family favorite! Sometimes I use cream of celery instead of chicken and I like to add a little more sour cream too. Sauteeing the cornflakes in butter is a useless step, they will crisp up perfectly in the oven!

There's lots of Hash Brown Casseroles out there, but I like this one. I don't use the topping because I'm not a real topping kind of person. The basic casserole tastes great w/o it. I also cut our 1/2 of the butter, didn't seem to need it.
Thanks for the recipe

I made these with a few modifications-- and I got rave reviews from the family.

My changes:
1) add one 8 oz package of regular cream cheese.
2) use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken
3) for the topping, use BOTH bread crumbs and the dried "onion" ring topping for salads.  Using all bread crumbs or all onion rings seems too boring-- but the combo is incredible.
4) use only 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter for the recipe, and use the other 1/2 stick for the topping.

ENJOY!

My family LOVES this casserole! We've been making it for years... we call them "Scary Potatoes" because it's scary how much fat is in them! I've made them with both southern style and shredded hashbrowns and it always turns out great.

I really liked this for a brunch dish.  Save a little time and dirty pan by just tossing the cornflakes with melted butter in a ziploc bag.  The second time I made it I halved the recipe, but used most of the can of soup anyway.  Also added some bell pepper and a thin layer of extra cheese under the cereal.

My husband loved it, but I didn't care for this.  I made this again, and this time I used fresh cut potatoes and it came out great. I had to cook it a long, long, long time though--more than 2 hours using fresh potatoes. *shrug* It was worth it though!

My only issue with this recipe is the onions. I like onions just fine, but the raw onion was barely cooked after 40 minutes. The taste of onion was overpowering. Next time I think I'll saute the onion first, or just leave it out and add some onion powder. Otherwise, this is a nice recipe.

This is easily worth five stars. I made the whole recipe for only 3 people, and there were hardly any left overs. I left out the onions, and the butter, and instead of corn flakes, I used bread crumbs. Because I had read in other reviews that the casserole was a little dry, I added a can of cream of potato to the mix. I also added 3/4 lb of sausage link since this was my main course. My hash browns were frozen when I started, so the entire cooking time ended up being about an hour and a half. I served this with brocoli and rolls.

delicious!  I made this for my boyfriend, and he loved it.  I was hesitant about the cereal topping, but it was one of the best parts of this recipe.  I wish I would've put less cheese and more hash brown.

Was a little disapointed with this recipe after reading the reviews.  Husband would give it a 5 and loves it, so I gave it a 3 instead of a 2...I found it a little dryer than others I've had and not as much flavor as I'd hoped.  Have made it twice now in the hopes I'd like it better the 2nd time, but no luck.  Will look for another one that I like better...sorry!  (I am usually with the majority as far as reviews go)

A friend made this for a barbeque, and we loved it so much that my husband begged her for the recipe. I use fat free sour cream and reduced sodium fat free cream of chicken soup and I haven't noticed any affect on the taste. I also don't saute the cornflakes in butter, I just sprinkle them on the top and pop it in the oven.

My husband's grandmother made this for a Birthday dinner for his grandpa and my husband hasn't stopped talking about it.  He even asked grandma for the recipe....low and behold she told us it was from here.  Now I have hubby begging me to make this on a regular occasion.  I did halve the amount of salt (cuz that's the way grandma makes it).  Definate keeper.  Thanks for the post.

This is "OFF THE HOOK" delicious! The leftovers, when there are any, are even better the next day! This is also something that you can eat by itself--its a guaranteed fact you'll be full, sassy and happy!! Thanks Court for sharing--This one is in the FRONT of my cookbook girl! ;o)

I didn't have time to thaw the potatoes. I just mixed it all up with the frozen potatoes and the recipe turned out great. I just left them in the oven a few minutes longer. My family and our drop-in guests all loved this recipe.

Well I'm a sucker for anything with potatoes in it, but my husband & I both really liked this! I cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us, and there is about half left, so we'll have leftovers tomorrow.  I omitted the salt since the soup is highly salty, and so is the cheese.  I used crushed Ruffles potato chips on top, rather than corn flakes, and skipped sauteeing them in butter.  Delish!  Thank you, Courtney!

This is one of our favorites, it is a must have now on our holiday buffet table. This is so easy to fix and so delicious. I used dried minced onion, about 3 T as a timesaver. I used the southern style cubed hash browns too for this. I did add extra cornflakes though (about 1/2 c) as there was more butter in the skillet and I just thought, why not? This makes a large dish. Great for potlucks, family get togethers, holiday dinners, etc. Keeps well and reheats well too. My ex MIL made this every holiday and refused to give me the "family secret recipe" for nearly twenty years I tried to get it when I was family... now I have it! Thanks for sharing! A definite keeper!

This recipe was OK.  I like my sisters recipe better (sorry!).  The casserole seems bland, but it could be b/c I like spicy foods.  I need to see what my sister's recipe has in it that is missing from this one...  Don't get me wrong, this was good (just not like my sis's).  I used reduced fat ingredients (i.e. sour cream, soup, etc.), so that may be the problem (?).  Thanks anyways!

I used only 1/2 container (4 oz.) sour cream, omitted the 1/2 cup melted butter and substituted about 1/3 cup milk, used 1/2 fat cream of chicken soup, about 1 1/2 cups grated cheese, a bit of chopped parsley for color, and I omitted the extra salt.  I added chopped bacon (about 6 strips) and sautéed it with the chopped onions first, and then mixed everything together.  I topped with crushed cereal flakes and about 1/4 cup melted butter.  It actually sat in the fridge all day until dinner time, and we baked it for about 45 minutes.  It came out cheesy and delicious, and I thought it was great.  I would serve it again as a side dish for ham or roast beef.  It was good. UPDATE: If you need to, you can bake this right away using frozen hash browns. I have done that the last two times and baked it for about an hour, and it works great!

WOW!  I originally made this for Thanksgiving where it was eaten in record time.  The end result was a delicious, creamy dish.  The only things that I changed in the recipe were omitting the extra salt and using low-fat sour cream and cheddar.  My flatmate and I ended up making it repeatedly for weeks and I keep on getting asked to "bring that potato thing" to carry ins!  Really easy to make and well worth the effort.

I cut recipe in half and baked in an 8x8 baking dish, as this makes a lot! I added a few shakes of garlic powder along with the salt and pepper and used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. Only thing I did not like was that the onions did not get done and were somewhat crunchy in this dish. We did not like biting into raw onions. Next time I will saute them first, or just leave them out.

Delicious, although next time I think I'll skip the corn flake topping.  Used cream of mushroom instead of chicken,-tasted great.  Think I'd bake it about 10 min. longer next time too.  Potatoes were just barely done.

I've made this dish for a work lunch, and it worked well in a slow-cooker (4hrs on high), but of course I left off the crunchy topper. Unfortunately, I need to modifiy it a little to get my husband to like it, probably just taking out some of the onions and sour cream. But I love this dish!!

I really enjoyed this recipe- it was comfort food at its best.  The only kind of hashbrowns I could find at the grocery store were the shredded kind, and I had wanted to use the little squares.  So I decided to subsitute a 2 pound bag of tater tots for the hash browns.  Also, I omitted the corn-flake thing all together. It was all soooo yummy!!  Oh yeah- the dish is ready when the cheese is melted and bubbly.  Enjoy :-)

TRY THIS ONE OUT!
Its so easy & delicious you'll want to make it all the time!I think its better than the restaurant versions I've had.
I leave the corn flakes out & its just as good.
Sometimes I cut it down for just the two of us but you won't have any leftovers if you make it for your family...its too good!

GREAT! I did tweak it though. I used o brien potatoes because they already had onion & peppers in them & i added about 8 slices of uncooked, diced turkey bacon. A keeper. The sour cream was  not over powering. Nice, rich flavor.

I am addicted to this stuff!  I use cream of mushroom instead of chicken, but I don't think it changes much (I just like mushrooms!)...  And I cook it for at least an hour.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks so much!

I had this at a friend's house and had to have the recipe.  I made it the next day for my husband and it was a hit.  We ate it for dinner and he thought it seemed too "breakfasty" with the cornflakes, so maybe I'll try something else next time.  It still tasted great, nonetheless.  I omitted the butter and it didn't taste any different than the one I had tasted at my friend's house the day before.

Yum!  I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and there was none left.  I substituted cheddar soup and it came out excellent.  I also left it in the oven for longer than suggested to get it a little crispier.  Great recipe!

I actually used cream of potato soup instead of the cream of chicken.  Very delicous.  Incredibly easy to make. Made for great leftovers as well.

I served this with ham at Easter, it was a hit. Everyone thought it was great. I left out the onions and will try it with cheddar cheese soup next time.

I made this for my son's family birthday party and everyone loved it!  I did find that as the recipe said, you must let the hash browns thaw out.  I ran out of time and tried to mix them up partially frozen and what a pain!  The butter hardened the minute it hit the hash browns!  So make sure their thawed and room temperature.  But will definitely make again and everyone asked for the recipe!  Thanks!

*AWESOME-FAMILY & FRIENDS FAVORITE* also great as left overs. I have made variations in the soup chicken, mushroom or cheddar, depending what I serve with this(brunch or dinner), but a must is to mix a bit of melted butter with the corn flakes and bake YUMMY, I find it does need to bake a bit longer than the it states.

This recipe was really good!  I've made it 3 times in the last two weeks - my Husband loves it!  Try using cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken soup.  That made the recipe even better!!!

To make it GF, I subbed in gf cream or chicken soup @ 12 oz. also, for some reason onions may cause a migraine so, dried minced onion for flavor, about 1tbsp. Also, I like the Kraft creamy cheddar.  They loved it at work.

I found the dish much too salty for my liking.  When I make it again, I’ll omit the salt and use sodium reduced cream of chicken soup.

I made this today, the only adjustment I made was I used half of the amount of butter as some of the other reviewers suggested. It turned out really good. The family liked it! In the future I will follow the advice of some of the other posters and sautee my onions first.  Also, I had to cook it a full 1 hour! The onions were  still just a bit crunchy, but still good!

I made it exactly as laid out. I sautéed the cornflakes and put them on top and I found them very chewy. Not sure how long I was supposed to sauté them for but other than that it was a good recipe.

Did't have everything this called for,  but the subtle changes I made worked out great. 
I didn't have corn flakes,  so I used panko instead and fried with a little canola oil.  No frozen hashbrown as well so I grated potatoes and squeezed the moisture from them. Oops, and I added Monterey jack cheese since I didn't have enough chedder. New fave side dish!

I’ve made this casserole before and it’s always been a favorite. This time (on the recommendation of other reviews) I left out all butter and did not miss it one bit!  I also didn’t put any cornflakes or crunchies on the top and it was still delicious.   I made this a few hours before baking so I took it out of the refrigerator prior to baking and it definitely needed 60 minutes in the oven.

I have made this twice now. Very close to Cracker Barrel.  :-)  I added 2 things: diced green onions and panko on the top (instead of cereal) for crunch. My family keeps asking me to make this again.

I wanted to make a smaller amount of this casserole and lighten it up a little bit. After reading the reviews here is what I did: I used 1  pound of thawed hash browns with 1  full can of cream of chicken soup, 1 tbsp of sour cream, 1 cup of shredded Tex mex cheese mix, 2 tbsp dried onion flakes, 1 tsp  granulated garlic, 1/4 tsp salt. I didn't add any butter to the mix but I did drizzle 4 tsp of melted butter over top along with one cup of crushed cornflakes and 1/4 cup of Tex mex cheese. It turned out great. I went with the smaller portions of the dairy because I still used the full can of soup and it worked out really well, and not greasy at all like some other reviewers had mentioned.I didn't feel right about rating it five stars as I didn't stick to the original recipe, but as far as inspiration goes, it is outstanding. I love seeing how other people modify their recipes because it lets me experiment more successfully when I see what you all have done and what works or doesn't work well. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good and extremely easy casserole! I did make a couple of changes recommended by other reviewers, that is, keeping the items the same, but adding a couple of steps in prep. I added additional onions and sauteed them before adding them to the dish.  Also, I used the square, rather than shredded, hash browns, which I partially baked before combining with other ingredients. I liked the result, but wanted a little more depth of flavor.  The second time, I used cream of celery soup instead of chicken (either would have been fine, but I wanted one dish to be vegetarian), added onion and garlic powder, a mixture of pepper jack and cheddar cheese rather than just cheddar, and then split the combined ingredients into two casserole dishes, adding browned sausage crumbles to one half.  I topped the vegetarian version with the suggested corn flake crumbs and butter combination, but topped the sausage version with a panko and grated parm combo about 10 minutes before it came out of the oven. Loved both of these modified versions of the dish!

I used the old way by topping the casserole with Kellogg's Corn Flake Crumbs, & pouring over a stick of melted margarine / butter. They've been difficult to find in the past, but recently   Walmart has finally started carrying them. I top all of my casseroles in this manner. I ALWAYS USE CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP in this, or ANY other casserole in place of Mushroom. It makes all th difference in the world. 
This is NOT just a "breakfast casserole" - it's good with virtually any meat, at any meal / time of the day.

The original version is good. However, I prefer the suggestions others have made. I use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and I omitted the cornflakes. Not a fan of cornflakes on my hash browns. Instead I sprinkle shredded Parmesan on top. I personally made the following substitutions and additions. I used a pkg of pizza shredded cheese; it is mozzarella, cheddar, Parmesan and cream cheese. I used Obrien shredded hash browns; it comes already thawed, and with onions, green and red bell peppers already in it. I omit the salt. And I add breakfast meat, usually bacon, sausage and diced ham; or one of the three depending on what I have available. Sometimes I add red pepper flakes or diced jalapeños if I want it spicy and flavorful.

I boil my own potatoes, and mix the cheese with the corn flakes, dry, and sprinkle on top. I would not mix corn flakes with butter.

I've been making this casserole for years, and it has become a family favorite. I whisk together the melted butter, soup, and sour cream and then add to the potatoes, cheese, and onions. However, my recipe calls for less melted butter (3/4 stick melted margarine/butter) in the casserole and crushed potato chips on top instead of corn flakes. I use the Healthy Request cream of chicken soup to reduce fat and sodium and reduced fat sour cream (NOT fat free) to lighten it a bit. You do not miss the extra fat grams or salt because the cheese offsets that. Instead of chopped onion, I use 5-6 chopped green onions. I mix half the cheese into the casserole and reserve the other half for topping the casserole towards the end of the baking time and placing the crushed chips on top of the cheese. My recipe calls for baking at 350 degrees for 50 minutes and then topping with the remaining cheese and crushed chips and baking for 10 minutes more so that the topping doesn't get burned. This is a great side to serve with ham, and the leftovers are delicious alongside eggs for breakfast.

This is the recipe that I have used for years except that I lightly cook the hashbrowns before adding all of the other ingredients. I mix them together in a small bowl and then when the hashbrowns are half done add them to the hashbrowns stir to mix and then put in the oven with the topping. I like the way that the hashbrowns taste from being lightly browned in the better.

This is, hands down, one of my family's favorite recipes. It has become part of our Sunday brunch routine. The flavors work so well together, and it is extremely filling. The only changes that I have made to it are that I brown a pound of sausage, and I put the onion in with the sausage to soften it up. Instead of using cream of chicken soup, I use cream of mushroom. Because my family loves the crunchy topping, I also crush one more cup of cornflakes. This increases the 1/4 cup of melted butter to 3/8 of a cup or 6 tablespoons. Sometimes, I also like to put some French fried onions on top too. It's just delicious!

I doubled all ingredients plus noted changes: used one cream of mush and one cream of chicken, used 1/2 yogurt with 1/2 sour cream, added 5 pieces of bacon crumbled and used 2 bags of southwestern style hash browns. Like others I added a little cheese to top, cooked it for 30 min covered then uncovered and topped with fried onions cooking 15+ mins more. I took it to a bbq. I've never received so many compliments on a dish before. It was fab!!  Added note: leftovers topped with overeasy eggs the next day is the bomb :)

I cut this recipe in half because there is only 2 of us- I mixed  2 tbsp melted butter, 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 tsp minced onions, 2 tsp hot sauce, 2 oz sour cream, 1 cup cheddar cheese and black pepper. Mix together first then added to 1 pkg simply potatoes diced with onion. Spread into casserole dish. Topping: mixed 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup broken up French fried onions, tossed with 2 tbsp melted butter and covered casserole. Baked for an hour and was delicious! Other than cutting recipe in half, the only changes/additions were I used minced onion, cut the sour cream, mushroom soup and omitted corn flakes using bread crumbs and fried onion mixture for topping because I didn't have corn flakes on hand. Also added hot sauce for a little kick!

I've been making this recipe for years and years.  I got it back in the 1980's and it's still a winner.  I make it almost exactly as written but sometimes omit the topping and it's still great.  It makes a lot and is good as leftovers.  Thanks for posting this - I wanted to pass it along to a friend and couldn't find my recipe card so I searched till I found the right one - and this is it!  Thanks Cmansky for posting this!

I made this for a Christmas get together and it was all gone within about 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend this recipe, however, I made a few tweaks. First, I used plain Southern hash browns (they are cubed potatoes) and  thawed them in the fridge overnight. I then used a little less than 1/4 butter and melted it and fried up the onions until they were translucent. I then put the hash browns in the pan with the onions and warmed them up until they were soft and warm (not browned). Once the potatoes were done, I put them in a bowl and added 8 oz. of regular sour cream, cream of mushroom soup,   about a cup of diced ham, about 6 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese (almost an entire bag, but maybe left about 1/2 a cup in the bag), 1/8 tsp of pepper, and about 1/8 tsp of salt. I cut back on the salt and cheese because I figured the ham was salty and could be greasy. I also didn't add any additional melted butter. I placed it in an ungreased 13 x 9  casserole dish. I melted 2 pats of butter in a saucepan and sauted the cornflakes. I sprinkled that over the top of the potatoes. I cooked the dish covered for 45 minutes at 350 F and then uncovered it and cooked it for 10 minutes at 425 F. It turned out great!

Everyone loved it. Followed the recipe. Did sauté the onions prior to mixing those into the recipe. That was the only change. It was wonderful, everyone (7) commented on how good it was. This is now a permanent holiday casserole.

My gobto cheesy potato recipe! Requested by friends and family for all parties! Sometimes I add cubed ham, if I do that I omit the salt. Sometimes I change the topping to crushed rippled potato chips and sometimes I do no topping. It's good any of the ways I make it.

I've beenmaking this for 20 years, except I add 4 oz. of Velveeta in the sauce and use more cornflakes and butter. For the people who say the potatoes are hard, place them in the dish and place in oven while preparing the sauce to make sure they are soft. We make this for every family function.

This has always been a popular pitch-in favorite.  Recently, I've simplified it even more by subbing Cream of Onion soup for the chicken, omitting the chopped onion all together (as well as the salt...plenty of sodium in the soup).  Also have tried substituting Kraft Touch of Philadelphia Triple Cheddar for an even creamier finished product.  Everybody likes it, no matter how it's prepared.  This one's a winner.

A solid side dish on a cool day.  I agree with many that cream of mushroom probably would be better.  All ingredients are easily kept in the pantry (and most are in mine all the time) making this a no-brainer on a busy weeknight.  Needs a little more seasoning, I mixed in a tablespoon of Italian herbs before baking and it turned out well.  Also, I omitted the butter and it was just fine without the added fat and calories.

I needed something a man could cook in a short time for Mother's Day breakfast at our church. This was something that most people could never mess up if they follow the recipe. I ended up doubling the recipe for our church gathering and using Texas Cut hash browns along with adding a pound of breakfast sausage it came out great! My second time, for Father's Day, I am trying it again but without the corn flakes and I am using French Fried Onions instead, as I read on someone else's rating, and I increased the breakfast sausage to be doubled along with everything else. I get a feeling that this is going to become a staple on our church outings.

This FAR exceeded my expectations... I travel for work and make a weeks worth of dinners for my hubby . I already asked him to take this side dish tomorrow ... Can't wait for him to try it... The only change I made is omit butter, 4oz of sour cream and 4 ounces of cheese soup because it's all I had on hand... Topped with shredded cheese and baked at 350 for an hour.

I used a 2 lb. bag of fresh hash browns.  Worked well and I froze half unbaked without the topping so I could have it a second time.

OK, I totally screwed up this recipe and it was still great.  Half way through I realized someone had eaten my cheddar.  Grrr.  What I did have was some leftover herbed goat cheese, some goat cheese crumbles and some Mexican blend.  Hmmm.  Tossed them all in, along with some bacon I'd cooked  and crumbled and about a tsp of dijon mustard. 45 minutes into the bake I removed the cover and topped with some French's fried onions and baked another 15.  It was completely awesome. Even my son-in-law, who hates creamy dishes, asked for seconds.  Bottom line:  give it a try even if you don't have everything.  It's very forgiving.

I love this recipe.  It reminds me of the potatoes served at the breakfast buffets in WDW.  I tried making them in the slow cooker yesterday.  I put it on low for about 6-7 hours.  They came out gre!t.  I plan on doing this Christmas morning so the oven can be used for other foods.

Unfortunately I didn't really like this recipe. It wasn't horrible, it was just very... bland to me. I had a recipe a long time ago when I was younger that they taught us in home ed. I loved that hash brown casserole and from what I could remember the recipes were very similar. Either my taste buds were expecting something this one was missing or they've just grown up to want a more adult taste. 
Some good points though 1) It makes tons of food and 2) It was cheap! 3) It can be thrown together really fast. So, if you're on a budget like me and need to take something to a potluck this might still be a good option.

Made this the first time for a girl's movie night.  There were six of us and I didn't take any home.  Only change I made was to use cream of mushroom soup mostly because I read the recipe wrong.  :-)

This was such a hit!  I forgot to add the cornflake topping and it was delicious without it!  People were asking to take the little bit of leftover I had.  Great recipe that is easy to make.

You can definately reduce the amount of butter to 1/4cup or less.  I also covered it for 45 min and then added panko bread crumbs (without the added butter) and baked for another 15min.

Pretty tasty! I have made this a few times and this past time replaced the onions with sauteed leeks and whisked 1/2 a cup of sour cream with 1 cup of milk and the soup and 1/2 the cheese before tossing everything and found the consistency and creaminess was better. I also added 1 tsp paprika to the buttered hash browns before stirring everything. No cornflakes but I put the cheese on top and baked uncovered - so good as some of the hasbrowns get a chance to crisp this way!

Super!  Everyone really loved.  I added 3 oz. to a 2 lb. bag of shredded hash browns and had only a few left when serving 12.  Youngest being Eli at 3 1/2.  Added just a bit extra sour cream (1/3 fat)

We love these cheesy potatoes!  I use 3/4 of a stick of butter instead of the whole and top the casserole with crushed potato chips...it's a texture thing and I love crunch.  For the same reason, I bake uncovered at 375 for about an hour.  The crispy corners and sides are the first to go.  Potato perfection!

I am trying this recipe now, it's in the oven.  However, 1 package of hashbrowns was only 1.1 lbs, so I bought two packages because it calls for 2 lbs.  I think this is way too much and I'm woried it won't have as much flavor.  I had to use 2 baking dishes just to fit it all in.  Next time I'll try 1 lb.  We'll see how this turns out.

This was very very good. I added a pound of hamburger and cooked the onion with it first. Then combined everything before cooking it. Comfort food - mmmmm!

Every time I've brought this casserole to a potluck or event, I always end up giving the recipe to a few people because it's such a hit! This is such a versatile recipe because it can be used for dinner or breakfast.  I'm not a fan or the cornflakes so I skip that part.

Loved this recipe.  It tasted so good, and it is very versatile.  If you only have O'brien's in the freezer - use that, if no cream of chicken, use any condensed cream soup.  Use cornflakes if you have them or leave them out if you don't.  Thanks for a keeper!

Outstanding!  I made the recipe exactly as written with one slight change.  My husband dislikes onions and I can't get enough of them, so I left the onion out of the mix and instead topped half the casserole with a can of french fried onions and my husband's half with extra cheese.  This was the perfect compromise for those who are split about onions.  It makes it more kid friendly too.  One of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow!

delicious. To make a bit more figure friendly, you can use low fat sour cream and soup (used mushroom because thats what I had in the house) and about half the butter and the results are still very good.

I follow the directions except for 2 things. I add about 1/3 to 1/2 a packet dry ranch dressing mix and I leave off the cornflake topping. This is my most requested family recipe. YUMMY!!

This is very similar to my own, however I enjoyed this one alot. I don't know if you put the two side by side if there would be much of a difference, however I liked the taste of this more. I didn't use the cornflake topping or the onions since my family prefers it without. This is definitely replacing my own.

Good traditional hashbrown casserole recipe.  A must in comfort foods! I prefer to make it with cubed hashbrowns rather than shredded.  For an extra kick I mixed salsa into part of it for my husband and me.  It was very good!

I used cream of mushroom soup like the suggestions and I added some garlic powder (my preferences).  This was great!  Took it to an office brunch and it was GONE.  Gave out the recipe the rest of the day.

We make this every holiday. A friend of my younger brother had a small wedding where their parents prepared most of the food. After spending holidays with us several times they requested that I make three pans of this for the wedding reception. (Later I found out they wanted two pans for the reception and one to take home to eat themselves. LOL!) I just came to the site hoping to find this already typed out. My daughter wants to make it and wanted me to email her the recipe. (Coming here is easier than typing it out!) This will always be a family fave for us. Sometimes we change it up by using different soups and different cheeses (once we added diced ham and swiss w/celery soup... it was great!), but we always come back to this version.

Not good if you are watching your calories, but I only serve this maybe once a year on a holiday. Everyone loves it. I prefer sharp cheddar over medium. I don't use the crushed cornflakes on top, but otherwise follow the recipe as written.

Totally easy and equally delicious! YUM!!! I made it as written here except I didn't saute the cornflakes, just crushed them, dumped them on top after about 40 minutes of cooking, drizzled some melted butter, and cooked for another 15 or so minutes. SO GOOD.

Found this while looking for a side dish to go with our dinner fritatta.  Very yummy.  I made a couple of adjustments for personal preference & based on what I had on hand.  Didn't have any frozen hash browns so I shredded 4 large potatoes in the food processor & rinsed them.  I used condensed cheddar soup instead of cream of mushroom & I omitted the topping all together because I didn't have corn flakes.  I also omitted the butter in the potato mix, there was plenty of liquid with the soup & sour cream.  I ended up cooking for about an hour to get the desired tenderness.  I took the lid off for the last 15 minutes or so in order to reduce the liquid down.

This recipe is great!  We all just love it. I only changed one thing.  I used French's french fried onions to top this with rather than corn flakes.  I haven't tried the corn flakes, so I don't know which one is better.  I just know that it's awesome with the onions!

This is so good and tasty..my family thinks it's Excellent.  I didn't have the cornflakes so made it without, also only half the sour cream, and 3 tbls of butter.  Still fantastic, in the future I will make it with the cornflakes to see what were missing.

This was absolutely delicious! A really great recipe to make your own.  I altered the recipe a little to my personal liking...  I first sauteed bacon (5 slices) with the onions, finely diced.  I used 1/4 cup of butter since I had bacon drippings from the saute.  I cut the salt in half, and added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic power.  And lastly, like several previous reviewers, I used french fried onions as a topping for the last 10 minutes.  My baking time total was 50 minutes covered, and 10 minutes uncovered with the topping.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

I am rating this before even cooking this....I hate to change stuff before rating but I did do a little different(based on what I had at home)...added ground beef and cream of mushroom soup.  I added cheddar and mozzeralla cheese.  I used grated real potatoes too.  I was eating it before putting it in the pan to cook.  Have a loaf of homemade bread cooked and can't wait for this to bake off.  I know this would be great if I left the recipe exact too.

Very good - I use low fat sour cream, fat free cream of chicken soup, 2% shredded cheese and half the melted butter and it still tastes awesome.

This was a good version of the classic cheesy potato casserole. It was fairly forgiving with my substitutions as well. I only had plain yogurt, no sour cream and had to use a mix of white cheddar and havarti cheese. I left off the cornflakes because I didn't have any and my family still enjoyed this one.

I used sharp cheddar and still kind of bland.  May pep it up with something else next time.

Great recipe!  I made this for Easter brunch and everybody loved it.  I sauted the onions with sausage and used italan seasoning.  I didn't have the cereal so I just topped with parmesan cheese.  Will make again!

So easy to prepare! I have used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup and it tastes great either way. I don't bother with browing the topping either - just pour it over top before baking. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I've made this recipe twice and it's been yummy both times.  The changes I made were using cream of mushroom instead of chicken, omitting the butter, used french's fried onions in place of cornflakes.

I made this recipe today for brunch. I don't like dishes with only one tone of color, so I added some spinach leaves, mushrooms, and instead of cream of chicken I used cream of potato. I also used two varieties of cheese-- cheddar and mozzerella. I'll post a picture soon. :-) It's a fabulous recipe-- would've never thought to add the sour cream, which adds to the deliciousness.

Very delish and definely rich potato casserole. I used to make it in a 9 X 13 pan but do like the results of a deep 3 qt. Corning casserole. I also use fried onion rings to top instead of cornfolakes. I know you can add extra meat, green pepper or anything else but it really is great for a basic potato dish. Thanks for the recipe.

I am giving this 5 stars and not 4 because the pan was cleaned out quickly at a church pot luck, and I doubled the recipe.  To me it was a little bland and I am not sure what it was missing, I did omit the little bit of salt because the canned soups are so high in sodium...  I will make it again and try adding more spice and/or onions, peppers, something...

I love potatoes, and the potatoes were so good in this recipe. (I used the Southern Style Hashbrowns.) I left off the cornflakes topping because we don't eat cornflakes, and I didn't want to buy a whole box just for this recipe - I just added more cheese to the top & uncovered it for 15 min. to let it brown. I cut back on the butter as recommended by other users, but I think that was a mistake. I added ground beef to make it a main dish and my family really liked it. We will make this again, only next time with all the butter.

My favorite hash brown casserole recipe.  Made it last night and switched the cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom and it turned out great.  Exactly the right mix of ingrediants so it turns out not too dry and not swimming in sauce. Thanks!

this is one of my favorite side dish recipes! it is always a big hit with friends and family.  On taco night, i alter the recipe by adding a can of rotel tomatoes and use breadcrumbs in lieu of the corn flake topping.  Be sure to add a little melted butter to the breadcrumbs, mix and spread over the casserole.  Awesome dish!!

Very good, but next time I will omit the onions (too crunchy and dominated the taste of the casserole) and add another cup of cheese.  I did add a package of diced ham, and this delicious addition helped make it an entree rather than a side.

This was spectacular!  Another girl at work was known for her hashbrown casserole and this one put hers to shame.  I served it with roasted chicken and green beans and everyone said it was amazing :)  Our picky 4 year old loved it too!

I thought there was way too much potato hash browns in ratio to the other ingredients.  I didn't think it had much flavor at all really.  Next time I will cut back on the potatoes.  I also used saltine crackers instead of corn flakes as one person suggested and it was horrible.  Next time I will definately use corn flakes for the topping.

I have made this casserole for years and it is a family favorite-with a few minor adjustments.  I always use cream of mushroom soup, then bake with no topping for 45 min. Remove from oven, and sprinkle 1 cup plain rice krispies (not the frosted ones!) over the top, drizzle with melted margarine/butter, add some snipped green onions and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Return to oven for 15-20 minutes...and ENJOY!

Served this for a brunch where I also served ham.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.  I did use cream of mushroom because that is what I had in my pantry.  I did read the other reviews and did not sautee the cornflakes just placed them on the casserole and then drizzled the butter over them.  I had to split it into two casserole dishes because the larget dish I had was the 2 1/2 quart corningware.  Will definitely make again!

I got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I followed others advice and used french fried onions on top.  I also used a low fat soup and sour cream.  I made it the day before, set it out one hour before baking and baked it off for 50 minutes before adding topping and the baked it 15 more minutes.  A winner.

We served this for easter dinner with ham and I doubled the recipe.  I baked it in 2 foil pans and my sister in law suggested baking for 1.5 hours like she does with her recipe.  I am glad I followed her advice because it came out just perfect.  Also, it is even better the next day!

Very yummy but I think the 1/2 cup of melted butter was completely unneccessary. It made the dish very greasy on top and didn't add to the flavor in any way. I'll definitely make this dish again, just without the butter.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  It has just the right amount of each ingredient.  Great flavor, great texture, and a perfect crunchy topping.

I really enjoyed this.  My sister had served a casserole like this at Christmas and I did not get the recipe, so I found it here.  I read many reviews and no one mentioned this:  it is very soupy, even though I had reduced the better to 1/4 cup.  My sister had the same result.  I am going to make it again, eliminating the soup entirely.  Also, like others, the onions were still crunchy even though I baked it for an hour.  If they are sauted first, it should eliminate the problem.  I did use light sour cream, but don't think that is why it was soupy.

This was good, my husband really enjoyed it...I not so much!! It was okay, I had made some changes. I omited the oignons and cornflakes, I added bacon. I had to let it cook for 1 hr and 10 minutes and this was with half the amount called for!! Will probably make again for my husband!!

Very good tasting and it went over well at a potluck lunch! The next time I make it, though, I'll probably omit the 1/2 cup of butter as the casserole was very greasy. I'll try low-fat cheese as well.

This recipe was excellent!  My entire family loved it.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I crushed seasoned croutons and sprinkled them on the top.

Yummy!  I only put 1/4 cup butter in the potatoes & 1/4 cup in the cornflake mixture to cut the fat. Also, I just sprinkled salt on the potatoes instead of adding a whole tsp.  I added a little less than 1/4 cup of green onions.  Next time I think I'll add the cornflakes at the end of cooking time so they're not chewy, but more crispy.  Very yummy!

My family loves these but I often "tweak" the original recipe. I use cream of cheddar soup or nacho cheese. As for "no meat" you can add either browned ground beef or crumbled bacon for the meat lovers in your family. I also top it with crushed potato chips and the melted butter.

The very definition of comfort food!  Every once in a while it's OK to eat food that's good for your soul - even though it may not be good for your arteries.  This is THAT food!  

My sister-in-law makes these for holidays and they are always a hit with their family - now I have the recipe and made if for my family and they just raved!  I added more cornflakes and butter to the top, but that's my preference, I like crispy!

I made this almost exactly as is, except I put it in the crockpot on low for 4 hours and used half cheddar & half sharp cheddar cheese. I also left off the corn flake mixture. 
My father-in-law said these were the best potatoes he's ever had!

This is so yummy! As a variation, I have even used fresh potatoes, since that's all I had in the house at the time.  I crisped up the chopped potatoes in a frying  pan, seasoning with cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I added the onions to the frying pan at the end to soften them a little.  Then I mixed all the ingredients and baked.  I omitted the salt and reduced the butter.  I also used french fried onions (no butter) as others suggested.  This recipe is good anyway you make it, in my opinion.

Beware of the butter.  I would suggest only 1 tablespoon mixed with hash browns and none on top.  I added chopped up leftover seasoned hamburgers to the mix and put french's onions on top.  Cooked covered 45 min and uncovered for 15 in a lasagna pan.  Delicious!!

I have been making this recipe for a long time and it is wonderful.  I make it for parties/cookouts and it is always a huge hit.  I usually don't add the onion and just use onion powder and a pinch of garlic powder.  This is one recipe that even the leftovers from a weekly dinner night never go to waste.

I used 1/2 can of cream of chicken and 1/2 can of cream of onion.  I was going to use a whole can of cream of onion but I was afraid it would be too "onion-ey".  It wasn't, next time I will just use the whole can of onion soup instead of the cream of chicken.  I also topped the casserole off with more cheddar cheese instead of the cornflakes and baked uncovered.  My kids love this!!

I LOVE this casserole. My only suggestion is to melt the butter in the microwave and then mix the cornflake crumbs in the bowl. Faster than cooking on the stove.

This was really good. As others suggested I only used 1/4 c melted butter in the casserole. I also used one can cream of chicken soup and one can cream of mushroom soup. When I added the crushed cornflakes on top I did not add any butter. I baked it covered for 45 and uncovered it and baked another 15.

Was craving some comfort food so made this - very tasty. It wasn't too much onion for us at all. For easy one pot preparation - melt all the butter you need then take some out to mix with corn flakes later. Sautee the onions in remaining butter then add all ingredients and put in casserole dish. Voila! Added a bit of garlic powder and put paprika on top of the corn flakes for a nice presentation. Did add half the butter called for, and used cream of wild mushroom soup.

I added bread crumbs in the last few minutes and broiled to toast them instead of corn flakes, I added a pinch of dried parsley for color and a pinch of thyme, which really rounded out a nice flavor.

I made this recipe for Easter but with some changes that I read about here on this board. Instead of just 1 can of Cream of Chicken I used 2. I only used 1/4 cup butter and not 1/2. I also didn't want to buy a whole box of cornflakes just for the casserole so I just topped it with cheese. It turned out really well. I baked it covered for 40 minutes and then baked it another 10 with the cover off so the cheese on top would get a little crispy. I think maybe I should have baked it a little longer with the cover on because some of the onions were still a bit crunchy. It was great, everyone ate it up!

I used light sour cream, to reduce the fat a little.  I also used a Monterey Jack/Colby cheese mixture, because that's what I had on hand.  This is fast and easy.  One could add some meat to make this more of a meal than a side dish, but we used it as the main course and it was great.  Thanks, Courtney.

Addendum: I made this again as a side dish for the marinated steaks that we grilled. This recipe refers to "2 cups crushed cornflakes cereal," which ends up being far too much of the topping in my opinion and takes 4 cups of uncrushed cornflakes to generate that much of the crushed. If starting with two cups of uncrushed corn flakes, once crushed, that should be enough topping and maybe that's what the recipe writer intended. 2 full cups of *crushed* corn flakes (4 cups of uncrushed) provides way more topping than is necessary. Everybody else probably figured this out, but to me, it wasn't clear.

This is an excellent recipe!  I spiced it up by using bread crumbs instead of cornflakes, adding an extra cup of cheese and a about 1/3 cup of onion instead of a half cup...MMMMM!

Very yummy and guests RAVED about it, all asking for the recipe.  I used "Simply potatoes" shredded hash browns (in refrigerated section, not frozen).  This recipe is actually on the back of the bag.  I omitted the onion as I forgot to buy one and added a few dashes of garlic salt.  Also omitted the salt and pepper (figure people can add to their liking). I prepared it the night before and then refrigerated and baked in the morning- very quick and easy.  I thought the corn flake topping made it!

Nothing special, it just tasted like tater tots in cream of mushroom soup with some cornflakes. Was not a big hit

I love this recipe.  Did a few things to make it my own though.  I'm not fond of corn flakes so I used seasoned bread crumbs on top.  Intead of dirtying another pan I just use dehydrated onions.  Also I use both hash browns (bob evans seasoned) and the cubed potatoes makes it a little different and definetly cook for a full hour!  Everyone loves this at brunch!

Couldn't find my own recipe, but they pretty much are all the same.  I always use the O'brien hash browned potatoes for this dish and did again.  I also do not buy cereal so I did not have cornflakes, I used butter flavored crackers and it was just as good.  I like Angelas idea of bacon bits on top.  Great idea.  Will try that next time.
Great side dish everyone, give it a whirl!  Never any leftovers!

I have been making a recipe exactly like this for years. It is awesome as is. Instead of cr. cornflakes, I use crushed ritz crackers on top. I also pour melted butter over the top of crackers as well. This is great with Ham !

I made this on Sunday for a family cookout, It was a big hit.  I did change a few things. I used Ritz Crackers sauteed in butter for my topping and added a few generous dashes of Tabasco for an added punch. This is now on my monthly recipe rotation!

This casserole was sooooooo good!  My fiance even raved about it and he rarely says more than "That was good."  I would recommend that you take the salt right out.  There is enough in the butter, soup, cheese, etc that adding the extra made it a little salty.  It has the taste of scalloped potatoes so next time I make it I'm going to add turkey-ham to the mixture!  Oh, the recipe doesn't say it, but make sure you use the shredded kind of hash brown potatoes.  I used southern style (basically diced potatoes) and the texute was a little chunky.  I think it would have been better with the shredded.

I thought this was good, but husband wasn't crazy about it.  I did add some milk, otherwise would have been very thick.  I liked it, he didn't, thus the 3 star rating.

I forgot to thaw the potatoes so I threw them in a pan with the butter to basically get them to room temp. I also just crushed the corn flakes for the top and then melted the butter for topping and poured over. It was very yummy with many many compliments.

Made this for Easter lunch...was originally looking for a recipe for au gratin potatoes and came across this one...Had to double to feed a crowd and turned out really yummy...used 1 bag of hash browns and 1 bag of o'briens and had to substituted cream of mushroom soup for the chicken.  I warmed the potaotes before adding to the rest of the ingredients..and sauted my onion in the butter before mixing in...assembled this the night before and baked for at least an hour and then another 20 mins without the lid...next time will reduce the butter.  I got lots of compliments and requests for more...great recipe!!

Made this for our condo's Easter Brunch,(Daytona Beach FL) and everyone LOVED it! Next time I will use less butter, and uncover for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the topping! (Also fabulous re-warmed.)

This is really good. I didn't have any sour cream, so I scrambled 3 eggs with a little milk and poured it over the top before baking, used cream of mushroom and half a bag of frozen broccli- i used odds and ends cheese that I had to make it extra cheesy- I think the real american slices I used(chooped up) made it really good. Easy, cheap, and deliciuos.I did not use the cornflakes, either. Perfect for a family of 6!

This was delicious and the only changes I made was to substitute potato chips for the cornflakes.  We don't eat cornflakes and always have chips on hand.  We loved the chips. I did saute them as advised - I also added jalapeno peppers.  If you don't like the heat of jalapenos adding red or green peppers will add to the flavor. The other change I will make when I make this again (which I will!), is to cut back on the salt.  The soup has salt in it already and I thought the recommended amount of salt was a bit too much for my family's taste.  Thanks submitter - I've been wanting to make this for a long time and I am glad I finally did!!

Very good addition to breakfast! I added 2 cans cr of chicken soup and didn't sautee the cornflakes at all. That may have been a mistake as the cornflakes were a bit too chewy. I'll reduce the amount of butter in the dish overall next time and try sauteeing the cornflakes.

This is a good recipe.  BUT it needs more zing.  It is bland & a little sour from the sour cream.  I used the little square hash browns instead of shredded & added a little cream cheese.
But here is what really made it good...kinda found this out on accident.  I had made con queso dip with Velveeta & Ro-tel...to serve with tortilla chips for our Memorial Day BBQ.  So what was delicious is putting a spoonful of this dip on the potatoes.  You could actually make the dip and mix it into the potato mixture prior to baking.  Try this, you won't be sorry... the potatoes need more cheese anyway & the Ro-tel will give it that zing.

I make this all the time, especially when I'm by myself.  It's my own version of "fast food".  I thaw the hash browns in the microwave for a couple minutes first.  Then I add the cream soup (usually mushroom).  I use garlic powder and often onion powder instead of real onion, mostly because I'm lazy.  I top it with bread crumbs and cheese instead of cornflakes.  I also up the cooking temperature to 400.  I mix the entire thing right in the casserole dish to save pots!  Easy and delicious!
Excellent recipe!

This was a perfect side dish for a brunch. At first I thought the corn flakes were going to be a little weird, but it really added to the whole casserole - you need to leave it in. Everyone loved it. I definitely recommend this for any brunch parties. Will definitely make this again.

This is a family favorite and one that we enjoy every Easter & Christmas. (I've found that we enjoy it more when I cut back on the listed amount of corn flake crumbs.)

My mom made this to go with steak when I was growing up. It is really delicious--my brother and I would fight over the leftovers. Not the healthiest side dish, but easy and yummy!!

Loved this recipe. Followed exactly. Loved the crunch of the cornflakes. Make sure your potatoes are fully thawed. Some of mine were a bit hard, but extra cooking time took care of that. 9X13 dish was gone in no time.

This is one of my favorite recipes. In addition, this is something that can be made anytime of the day. It's both quick and easy. Recently, I made this for a Mother's Day Brunch and it was a big hit. I highly recommend it!

This one is a sure fire winner. It is EXCELLENT! I doubled the amount of cereal. When I sauteed the cereal, I put in some garlic salt (about a tablespoon--but remember I doubled the cereal) for a little more flavor and it was great. Thanks so much Courtney!

Simple and always a winner.  I did find the topping a little too generous, but maybe it was overwhelming because I ran out of corn flakes and used mostly boxed corn flake crumbs.

I have not made this recipe in a year. I made it last year for Easter dinner, and was just asked to make it again. Apparently everyone loved it! I do remember that it took longer to bake than the recipe suggested. Also, I doubled the cereal topping last year, and will NOT do it again! It really over powered the yummy potatoes. The proportions are right on with this recipe.

Liked it but did not love it.  Sour cream was a bit much so I think I'd cut back on that a little next time.  I cut the salt out altogether because of the cheese and canned soup.  Also, didn't care for the corn flake top.  Interesting, but just didn't seem to go well.  Scraped it off and it tasted much better.

I've made this twice now. First time even after baking recommended time onions were too crunchy. Made for Christmas Day and sauteed onions in butter until soft, added and dish was much better. The sauteed cornflake crumbs on top add a great taste. Will definitely make again!

I took this receipe from the All Recipe Cookbook that I purchased from this site.  I made it on Christmas and everybody raved. Nobody could get enough!  Almost everyone had seconds and some had thirds.  It's a great, easy potato dish for any function.  We even made it for our family Christmas party and it was a big hit.   Very Good!

This is a great recipe. I halved it and it turned out great. I did not use the corn flakes. Also I would decrease the onions and butter by about 1/4 next time. I also think it would taste great with chunks of ham mixed in. I used hash browns that are cut into tiny cubes but I think the shredded hash browns would be justs as good if not better.

This recipe was tasty & easy to make.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I would change for next time is to leave out the salt, because the cream of chicken soup makes it salty enough.

I was sooo upset when I made this!  When I printed the recipe out, for some reason the "thawed" part of the hashbrowns got left out of the ingredients --so I ended up baking this forever!  Well, once it got done, it was WONDERFUL!  I realized what had happened when I came back and looked at the recipe again.  I'll make sure I thaw those suckers next time!  :-)

Excellent recipe!  I made this as part of my 3 year old's birthday brunch, and it was gone within minutes.  The Moms even asked me to have them over again in May for another batch.  I used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of chicken, and had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than directed, but it was absolutely delicious. One neighbor even commented it was better than Cracker Barrel's casserole.

This recipe was great!  I made it for a brainstorming session at the office.  I couldn't get the recipe to my co-workers fast enough!  I'd definitely crush the cornflakes and cut down a little on the butter next time.  I added ham chunks and it was even YUMMIER!  A friend suggested using seasoned bread crumbs as the topping instead of the flakes.  I'll try that next time.

This recipe was so quick and easy to make.  I would bake it longer next time and try crushing the corn flakes before I sauteed it in the butter.  My husband and I both loved it and I will definitely make it again!

Has a very good flavor and I cut the butter amount in half.  This is an easy casserole, I think I may serve it at a big family gathering, it would be good for a pot luck too.

I highly recommend adding 1 or 2 (4 oz) cans of diced green chilies.  They add such an amazing flavor!  I have also done this with fresh potatoes; peeled and shredded or diced then par boiled.  Since I usually don't have frozen hash browns on hand, it is a great and easy alternative.  I could make and eat these once a week!  So delicious!

This was a hit! I did add some diced ham and sautéed mushrooms that I had leftover from the holidays. Plus I  omitted the corn flakes since I didn’t have any. Served with hot sauce it was yummy! It was super easy to make and everyone loved it. I’ll make this one again.

My family absolutely adores this recipe and my co-workers all demand I bring it to potlucks at work. My adaptation is to include chopped onion and Instead of corn flakes, take one sleeve of Ritz crackers and smash them up in a gallon ziplock bag, sauté them in butter, and place on top to bake. DELICIOUS!

people from 6 to 60 loved this easy recipe I made for Christmas. I used shredded potatos and mixed everything well with my hands. My family and I always make a dish to share for holidays what I really liked was the quick time to make this potato dish when you remove the peeling and cutting of potatoes.

Great recipe and so simple. I didn't have cream of chicken : ( so I used cream of mushroom. I can tell that the chicken soup would have made it more flavorful.

2 cans of soup (cream of mushroom and cream of chicken), and added half a dozen green onions instead of regular ones), and about 8 or 9 slices of bacon ( crumbled).....they were awesome!  Everyone said they were ‘decadent’.  Will make again!

I have loved this casserole since I was young.  My family served it for holiday dinners, Sunday dinners as well as brunch.  This time, using suggestions from reviewers, I changed it up adding 1/2 can diced jalapeños and using the onion rings on top.  It was a delicious addition to a Labor Day barbecue. It’s not better, just a totally different flavor. I will be using both versions, depending on the menu.

Amazing!  I loved the fact that I didn't need to use eggs. I also cooked my onions but for the basic recipe, I used what I had on hand: Cream of Potato and Cheese Soup then added French Fried Onions the last 10-15 minutes with a bit more cheese (I didn't have corn flakes)!  I cooked it in 2 8x8 dishes for 30 minutes so I could freeze one - super yummy!!!

The only change I made was the topping. I used Panko bread crumbs with a little butter and put them on half way through the baking.  It was awesome!

Really, really good...I doubled it for a party, and grilled it on our Traeger in a large cast iron skillet. My only variations were using organic cream of mushroom and topping with French fried onions. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Everyone loves this recipe!!! My son requests it for special occasions :) I have used it for years but made a few small changes over time. I cook a package of ground sausage & mix it in with all the other ingredients. I also finely chop my onions & lightly sauté them 1st. It's great as is, but I love it better with the sausage added. I prefer the shredded hashbrowns & do thaw them. The cornflakes give it a great crunchy taste!

Great recipe!  Delicious! I added red peppers and 3 more eggs and some half and half to cover all the hash browns. Used a 9x13 dish and it was thick enough and looked so good. Thanks for posting .

I’ve made this for years. Never bother thawing the hash browns, and for the onion just buy the ones that have the onions and peppers. I always just dump the hash browns in the pan, mix the rest (double the cheese), put that on top of them, crush the corn flakes and add the melted butter on top. It is soupy when it gets done but once it sets for a few minutes it’s perfect.

I've heard that it's always wiser to try a dish and see how it tastes before making it and serving it to a large group of people at a special occasion. Well - I made this casserole for the first time and served it at our Mother's Day Annual brunch. I received nothing but raves!! My husband thought that it was awesome!! I used cream of mushroom soup, and added Asiago cheese along with the cheddar. Delightful!!

My daughter-in-law gave me a similar recipe a couple years back, and everyone was a fan, except for me.  When I saw this recipe, the ingredients were the same but the amounts were different, so I thought I'd try it.  Got oodles of compliments, and mos importantly,  I loved it too!!

amazing! did everything basically by the book. My topping was crushed corn flakes plus fried onion straws mixed together and drizzled butter on top. I made almost double the recipe in a 5 qt dish. Cooked covered with foil for 45 min and the without foil for another 15 mike. Perfect!

This recipe was dry and undercooked. The cream of chicken vs the cream of mushroom is s personal choice There is just not enough moisture in the dish. You may want to try adding in a cup to 1 1/2 cups of milk and  change the bake time to 1 hour because 40 minutes is not enough. I used cream of chicken with herbs and I think it helped the taste. Not something I would make again without making major changes...Good Luck!!!

Was a wonderful recipe! I didn’t use chopped onion but instead I used minced onion and it was wonderful. I didn’t put too much in for fear of the flavor overpowering the casserole ate all of it

This is so easy and delicious. I put in extra onion and cheese. I didn’t bother with the cornflake topping, and I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added about 3/4 t of Worcestershire sauce to give some extra zing.   I think it tastes even better on day 2 as a leftover.

Great recipe! My family devoured it! Instead of cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom. Also I used frosted flakes instead of cornflakes (gives a nice sweet taste to it, it's the only way I make my hasbrown casserole now) I also added more cheese!

Made it exactly how the recipe described and it was a near perfect dish.  I may follow some of the suggestions, but I will definitely make again.

I took the advice of others and used Colby Jack Cheese instead of Cheddar. I did sprinkle shredded Cheddar on the top. I also used French Onions and added a can of condensed mushroom soup along with the cream of chicken.

yummy! I made it exactly the way the recipe said. So good! The next time I might add bacon or  some diced ham! Either way I love this casserole, so easy to make and a crowd pleaser . So I made this recipe one more time, but exchanged the corn flakes with crushed potato chips, OMG! even better!

I didn't have frozen hashbrown potatoes so I shredded fresh. I think I would pan fry them and the onions for a few min to remove some water and soften them a tad bit more but the taste was excellent and my family wants them agai!  I didn't have corn flakes so I used Sunchips!  Worked like a charm!

Tastes great. I used cheddar soup instead of cream of chicken or mushroom. Also for ease 2 bags of simply potatoes. I use southwest style as my wife and I like the little spiced flavor. I hit under the broiler for a couple minutes to brown.

I've made this a few times and it is always requested for the holidays.  And since I can't leave well enough alone, I add to it a bit.  I slice up and add regular smoked sausage and 4 pepper smoked sausage to give it a little bite {spice}.  When I do this I always make a double batch as to not over power it.  And I still have some in a separate smaller casserole dish for myself after everyone has had theirs!

This was a hit at an office potluck! I made 2 batches--in the second one I stirred in cooked ground sausage. I did not do the cornflakes. Instead I just topped with cheese and baked. I did use the chunks of potatoes and felt that they did not cook enough. Next time, I will bake longer.

I followed the recipe for the most part. I did not use the second butter, but instead reserved about 1/8  of the 1/2 cup of the butter for the topping.  Instead of cornflakes, I used about 10 crushed Ritz crackers.  I also added 1/4 each of a red and green pepper, diced a bit fine.

Made without the cornflakes, and sometimes incorporate a small bag of O’Brien hash brown potatoes with the  and larger bag of plain. Outstanding! I’ve used a lot of hash brown casserole recipes, and this is the very best.

I made this for my Church Sunday School class. It was my turn to bring breakfast. I made it exactly as the directions stated with two tiny exceptions; no onion and no corn flakes. I used onion powder and townhouse buttery crackers in place of the corn flakes but with the melted butter. I also broiled it for a few minutes to make the top nice and brown. It was fantastic. I will make this again.

This recipe is excellent.  One time I didn't have enough sour cream but did have some French onion dip so I mixed that in with the sour cream I had and it  worked beautifully.

turned out well, although I omitted the topping (never had crumbs or cornflakes), but in hindsight I would have browned it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp and colour the top.  Otherwise everyone at the potluck I took it to loved it!

As another reviewer said, she doesn't like cream of chicken soup and used cream of mushroom instead.  Same goes for me.  There's some weird tang to the chicken soup that I don't care for.  But that's the only modification I made and everyone loved the casserole.  I will make again.

I make this pretty much the same way except, no cornflakes on top.  I just sprinkle more cheese on top that I have tossed with 3/4 cup parmesan.  The only other thing I do differently is I chopped a large onion coarsely, then I sautee the onions in a tablespoon of butter until they are tender.  It sure makes a big flavor difference!   Once in a while when I have left over ham or chicken I break it up into pieces and add that whalah!  now you have a dinner casserole.

A great addition to a wintry brunch.  This recipe is not for those trying to lose weight, but if it’s your free day, you will love a small sample of this.  
I cut back a touch on the cheese and onion as I don’t think it needed to be that calorie laden.  All liked it.  I substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup for the chicken soup.

I made this as written. It was ok but the onion was overpowering and not cooked through. If I make it again I will omit onions and use onion powder or onion salt.

I used whipped cream cheese instead of sour cream and I also added some shredded Gouda cheese with the shredded cheddar cheese. Also I did not do the corn flake topping... I just took the foil off for the last 5 minutes in the oven to crisp/brown the cheese on top a little bit. Amaaaaazing!!

Always a big hit. I have made this with half the amount of butter, as well as, the full amount. I must say using half the amount still creates a just-as-mouthwatering result as the original recipe without a greasy taste or appearance. This would be my only adjustment.

Amazing!!! Added only about 1/4teaspoon pepper be I'm not a fan, but my boyfriend loved it so much he wants me to make it EXACTLY the same next time. Also, instead of chicken I used cream of celery and Ritz crackers mixed with the melted butter on top. Yum!

I used slightly less cheese and less butter for the actual casserole itself. For the topping I used butter and panko bread crumbs (all I had on hand) that I seasoned with salt and pepper. It came out delicious! I baked it covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15. Not too soupy, not too dry. Will definitely make again!

Very good recipe. I only changed cream of chicken to cream of celery and colby for cheddar and baked it 1 hour. Oh and I did saute the onions in the butter first.
I will be making this again and again.

I turned it into a breakfast dish. I diced up a ham steak  and mixed it into the mixture, baking it just the same as it directed in the recipe . I topped it with fresh made bacon bits. I served it with a side of eggs and toast.

Did not care too much for this.  There are much better recipes out there for potato casseroles.  This was just too bland. It was creamy enough but needed more salt or seasonings. Maybe I shouldn't have used shredded hash browns.  Maybe I shouldn't have used cream of mushroom soup.  Maybe some hot sauce..?  Bland, bland, bland.

The cook time definitely needs to be adjusted. Onions were crunchy and nearly raw which made it a little disappointing. Still a good recipe just would personally make some minor changes, including using cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.

I added 6 TBS butter (instead of 8) within the potatoes. I used less fat cheese and low fat sour cream because I thought it had plenty of fat and I figured it still could be good.  I also liked the idea of putting the corn flakes on the top and drizzling the butter on top of that to reduce another pan to wash.  I can't wait to eat it.

My household loves this! I have started adding a small can of diced green chilis and some diced up chicken and it was really a BIG hit! I even tried it with a can of chicken and it was still good!Throw together a nice salad and your good to go in no time. Next I want to make a head and freezer meal it BUT I'm skeptical of how the sour cream will do?

A family favorite! Great at Easter with ham or with BBQ ribs on the 4th. If you don't have corn flakes, crushed potato chips  sprinkled on top and drizzled with butter is a  good substitute (that's how we always make them). I also cut back butter to 1/4 cup. Ore Ida frozen cubed hash browns are preferable to shredded and I do not cover mine when baking.

Really good!  I followed some suggestions of other reviewers as follows: added  about 1/4 cup chopped Jalapenos; used cream of mushroom soup instead of Crm of chicken; Used French fried onions on top instead of corn flakes. Cooked covered 45 min. then added French onions and cooked 15 min. uncovered (watching to avoid burning).  I mixed this up the night before and cooked next day for dinner.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I am not a big fan of any toppings so I can't rate with the topping. I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken and never covered it during cooking. It did take longer than suggested (about 2X as long) but worth the wait if you plan on it.

This is basically my mom's recipe! It's great. Brings back so many memories. I double the recipe always and it makes two sheet-pans. For 2 packages of Ore-Ida frozen hash browns, I use 2 lbs of cheese (1 lb sharp cheddar (2 8-oz packages) and 1 lb mild cheddar (2 8-oz packages). A little less than a 16-oz tub of sour cream.  I saute 2 small-ish yellow onions in a little butter and don't add butter otherwise. Used 2.5 tsp of sea salt (after trial and error, this is the perfect amount). I add pepper. I use cream of chicken but my mom also uses cream of mushroom.  I usually don't defrost the potatoes, and then I cook it for 3-4 hours at 350, uncovering for the last 45 mins. This time I put the bags of potatoes in lukewarm water for a half hour to defrost a little. They were done after 2 hours 45 mins with the last 45 uncovered. I had to move it up to 400 degrees for the last 45 to get the top brown. I warmed them up for an hour at 350/375 covered and they were perfect, though probably needed a little more time to warm. I don't add the cornflakes.

I made this for a Saturday morning breakfast with a couple small changes. I did not have Corn Flakes or crumbs, so I ended up crushing some Cap'n Crunch cereal instead. Not bad, but I would definitely say the topping is optional.

I browned 1 lb. of turkey breakfast sausage and stirred it into the mixture. I also added another half cup of shredded cheese to the top of the casserole. I think this is a great basic brunch/breakfast recipe that can be tweaked. We'll probably be making it again soon. 

Might try using condensed nacho cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken. Could also reduce the amount of onion, or saute them prior to take some of the bite out. Our friends are not huge onion people and I feel like I got a couple bites that were pretty strong.

I have made this a few times now. I always follow the directions the first time and tweek for the others. Family loved it the first time. Next changed the cheese to monterrey jack. It was really good but my 8 year old didn't like the spice. This time I'm making it with cream of mushroom and garlic instead of mushroom/ celery/ chicken. This is a great recipe and family has enjoyed every one of them.

This recipe is a favorite for my family, including the picky eaters. The only substitution I made was to top with crouched Ritz Crackers instead of corn flakes. I did not sauté them, I just sprinkled them on.

There are many variations of this recipe for Hash Brown Casserole, but this by far is my favorite and the one I have used for years.  I also cut the butter to half,  and I have used Colby  cheese for the Cheddar cheese.

My mother has made this for many years and we never had leftovers.  She made changes throughout the years, but it was my turn to take over the tradition of making this and the only change i made was i used refrigerated shredded hashbrowns.  Simply amazing!

Being I didn't have hash browns, but I did have a 50# bag of white potatoes, I boiled potatoes in jackets, then peeled and diced. I would make this again. As a matter of fact, I am making the recipe right now! Thanks!

The only change that I made was that I used cream cheese in place of the sour cream and it was perfect.  I only did this because I didn't have any sour cream on hand.  I've made this fish many times and have substituted mushroom soup and cèlery soup at times with excellent results.  I tend to use whatever is on hand.  This recipe always gets rave reviews when I serve it at potlucks.  Perfect recipe.

Loved this. Made it as is, without the cornflakes. You may need to adjust your baking time if you freeze it. I baked for 75 mins after being frozen. Yummy!!!!!

This  was so easy to make and absolutely delicious!!
The ONLY thing I would change is cutting down on corn flake crumbs by at least 1/2. 2 cups over powered the dish and I used a 9 x 13 pan. YES I will make  this recipie again!

Made this for a sunday brunch today.  Thought the cream of chicken sounded strange, but everyone loved it.  I didn't have cornflakes so I buttered and toasted ritz crackers instead.  My husband said this recipe is a keeper.

Very easy to make.  Great dish to make in a crockpot!  I did substitute the cream of chicken for condensed cheese soup.  Everyone loved during the holidays last year - making it again this year.

This was very similar to a recipe that I had years ago. I made some minor changes. Based off this recipe as is, it gets 4 stars but after my changes, I give it 5 stars.  I added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 1/3 cups of sour cream. I also added 4 cups of corn flakes on top and left out the onions as my family doesn't like onions (though I think they'd be perfectly yummy if you use them).

Make this all the time and it is always a hit, and is great left over the next day. we like it a little creamier so I do add more of the soup (we prefer cream of mushroom) and more sour cream.  but either way it is a great dish to go with any meal!

Super tasty. I made it with fresh shredded potatoes instead of thawed pre-made hash browns. The cream of mushroom soup and the cheese makes the potatoes creamy. I added a bread crumb topping to give it a bit more crunch. Came out great.

Love these, a great easy go to for the holidays when things are a little harried. We always called them funeral potatoes, because they always serve them in church after a funeral for the family dinner.

This is such a great side dish! Good with anything but especially if going to a cook out. It can be easily popped in the oven in a disposable casserole pan. I use Ritz as the topping

Used this recipe last night!  Added 2 cups cubed cooked ham and an extra cup of sour cream.  Also melted the 1/4 cup butter in microwave,  stirred in the corn flakes and sprinkled them on top of the casserole, covered and baked.  Turned out awesome!

I didn't have cornflakes, so I topped it with French fried onions and omitted the onions in the casserole itself. I was very pleased with the results.

I followed a suggestion from a previous poster. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  Instead of of cornflakes, I used  the French's canned fried onions as the topper.

Made this great recipe quite a few times.  It's wonderfully delicious and satisfying.   And forgiving.... I have forgotten to put in sour cream and another time I put  what I thought was too much cheese and another time I forgot the soup and  yet another time  put extra potatoes it all came out great and delicious!!!  It's great for anyone that is doing 5 things at once, like any mom.

I used the ingredients  listed, however, a few changes. I used Oreida Southern Hashbrown Potatoes , which has chopped onions , and peppers  included. I also used  Creme of Mushroom Soup. I added, 6 round slices of Provolone Cheese, which gives a bit of smokey flavor.  I followed directions of mixing ingredients in a bowl. I scooped half of the mixture in baking dish, then placed 6 slices of Provolone Cheese over the layer of potatoes mixture. I then, placed the rest of mixture over the Provolone Cheese. Baked for 45 minutes, covered , at 350°. Uncovered dish, and baked another 45 minutes at 400°.

Fantastic! Family loved it! I just changed a few things......4 large Green onions, 375 gram package of cooked and cut up bacon,  used  mushroom soup,  and grated an extra 3/4 cup of medium cheddar cheese. My family loves cheese! Cooked potatoes for about 15 minutes to make sure they were soft before I made the casserole. Added the sour cream then the soup and butter to potatoes. Then added the cheese last. Cooked covered  for 45 min. Then added the crushed cornflakes.and rice Krispies  last. That is another change I made . Also added 1 cup of
 the cheese to the top and cooked another 15 minutes. A huge success! Thanks to the other reviews I was able to pull this off. A really nice  versatile  recipe.

I learned a variation of this recipe from my Grandma, it is way too delicious. If you don't want to use chicken soup, cream of celery works really well too, I'm guessing you could probably sub in any "cream of __" condensed soup and it would still taste amazing!

This dish is delicious. However, I change it up a bit. I add chopped jalapenos and sometimes even mushrooms. I saute the onions, jalapenos and mushrooms in a pan with some butter before mixing it in. 

I cook it at 350 covered for 30 mins and and then crank it to 400 and cook another 30 mins uncovered. 

Oh and I don't add the cornflakes at all. I prefer it without.

I used 1/4 cup of butter, cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and I skipped the topping altogether. Delicious!

This recipe is very similar to one that my grandmother and mother make, but I have to say this came out a little better.  I started with partially thawed potatoes and followed the suggestion of mixing the potatoes, cheese, butter, minced onion, and S&P together first (used up some colby-jack and Mexican blend cheeses, maybe 1/2c each, along with the cheddar).  In a smaller bowl, I combined a can of  'cream of chicken and mushroom' soup with the sour cream (which I was a tad short on, so I added about 2-3T mayo to make up the difference).   Baked for 45 mins, then added french fried onions instead of corn flakes, returned to oven for 10 or so minutes until topping was lightly browned.  Came out fantastic!

FABULOUS recipe!  The whole family loved it.
To make it dairy free, I made my own cream of chicken soup and used non dairy butter and sour cream.
 In playing in the kitchen, I've come up with my dairy free version:
DF Cream of Chicken Soup 
(equivalent to 1 can)
1 3/4 cup chicken broth 
3/4 cup plain soy milk
1/3 cup (plus 1 tablespoon) flour 
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon each of black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and dried oregano 
Pinch of dried basil and dried parsley 
Pour the broth and milk into a saucepan. Bring to a low boil.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and herbs / spices.
Slowly whisk the flour mixture into the low-boil broth mixture.  Whisk / cook for 5-10 minutes.  Mixture will thicken.  Use as needed to replace 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup.
(Just sub non dairy butter and sour cream.????)

I left off the topping (didn't have any on hand), left out the onion and used about 3/4 cup milk in place of the butter, just enough to thin it out a little.  (The sour cream and cheese alone add plenty of fat, so don't worry about that.)  My potatoes weren't really thawed, so I made sure I broke them all loose, mixed it all up and then covered with foil. It took longer to bake, maybe 1 hour 15 minutes, but it was really, really good.  Nice, satisfying way to enjoy potatoes when fresh ones are scarce.

Remember to drain  hash browns first!! I added real bacon bits and chives to mine and used cream of mushroom soup as well. No cornflakes only because I forgot to by them and there are no stores open today :( I really hope it tastes as good as it smells cooking!

This was delicious! I made the original recipe first and everyone loved it!  The second time I made it as a dinner side dish and made some of the suggested changes. I sauté the onions and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Again it was just amazing! Thank you for sharing! A must in my house!

This was pretty good. I made it the night before and had it thaw in the 'fridge. It still took longer than 40 minutes to bake. I suggest using a little more salt, letting it bake longer, and trying Frosted Flakes instead of Corn Flakes (trust me!). :)

This was very good! Would be a great dish to take to a holiday dinner or potluck. I used onion powder instead of chopped onion and it had plenty of flavor. I also used part mozzarella cheese since its what I had on hand and didn't make the topping.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made this using cream of mushroom soup. Other than that exactly the same. Cooked for 1 hr and it was awsome.  Everyone loved it! I'm  making again to take to cookout this week end.  My only problem with this recipe is I want to eat it all! So delicious!

OMG this recipe is absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare with dif variations !I've made it 5 times already as a dinner casserole and it's a hit every time that I had to double the recipe. I used cream of mushroom , cut back the butter to only 1/4 cup and omitted sour cream when I didn't have any and Didn't even miss it the last time I made it. I shredded my own potatoes using a v- slicer and got more that way in my opinion. Left out the cornflakes . This is def a keeper and a go to for a quick dinner !!!!!

A coworker makes this all the time...and everyone LOVES it..!! I was finally able to find a recipe to rival hers...So excited!! I made the recipe exactly as written with one exception...I browned the onions prior to adding into the mix as I don't care for crunchy onion and prefer sweet, browned onions. It was amazing! I took the dish to a family gathering and we arrived late. I was worried that it wouldn't be eaten...but there were no leftovers. Great recipe! I will definitely use again...

Excellent.  I microwave the potatoes for 5 min first.  I add sauteed Mushrooms and some bacon bits to change things up.  I also use low salt chips instead of cornflakes and no extra butter is needed.  I broil the top for 2 min after I uncover so the chips are crispy.

Yummy with a few changes. I used green pepper instead of onion, cream of celery instead of cream of (chicken?), halved the butter and added some cream cheese. No need for a topping, just sprinkle some cheese on top!

Sooo good! I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken, added about a 1/4 of a sweet red pepper (finely chopped), and increased the black pepper to 1/2 tsp. It definitely needs a full hour to cook; I did 45 min covered, then uncovered for the remaining 15 minutes. I wasn't sure if I should use the shredded or cubed hash browns; I went with the cubed, which was perfect. I think adding some cubed ham would make this a good breakfast casserole

Our homeschool class used this recipe to do fractions. The 10-year-old read the reviews and decided not to put butter in the cornflakes. He wrote his review and I agreed: "I didn't like the casserole, but my family gave it five stars." He didn't like the taste and neither did I. We used CHUNK potatoes that were not frozen. That was the mistake, I thought. He said, "If I were going to change something, I would put less butter in and more soup."

I love this recipe but I cook it 1 hour covered and 1/2 hour uncovered.  Also I crumble ritz crackers and mix with butter and cover the top.  This is my favorite topping!  I also add sauteed onions.  Today I also added chives since they were in the garden.

Good recipe!  I substitute the corn flakes with ritz crackers or another buttery type cracker. I also omit the mushrooms since my family does not care for them and I use the cream of chicken soup. If you want to add some kick to it, throw in a can of drained rotel tomatoes.

Last year I used an almost identical recipe that my daughter & her boyfriend both disliked, but this year my daughter said if I made it similar to our local grocer's Texas Cheesy Casserole, they would eat it.  I was able to get a print out from the grocer's deli and the ingredients were similar to yours, except that I had to use Red Potatoes, dried onion, and leave out the corn flakes which I personally like, but the kids think are awful!  Mine took much longer to cook, I think because of the fresh potatoes; after an hour at 350 degrees, we took off the foil, upped it to 375, and it took about another half hour.  I think going with the dried onion was a great exchange, much easier than all that fuss and no overpowering onion taste problem like some others reported.  I cut back on the butter to 1/3 cup total which I used to coat the inside of the pan then melted the rest and added to the mixture, but when the casserole was finished there was still way too much butter!  It was floating on top of the casserole and I took several paper towels and soaked it up after which it was fine.  I thought it was a smidgen bland, but the kids (I say kids but the youngest is 20) all loved it and gobbled it down.  There were no leftovers:(

Make this for all family gatherings with a few changes. Instead of Sour Cream, we use Helluva Dip, we add soften cream cheese, use Mushroom soup instead of Chicken, and we sautee the onions with summer sausage or ham, depending on what we have on hand.  The recipe changes depending on ingredients.  
I usually put half of the hash brown mixture in the pan, put a layer of asiago sliced cheese, then top with rest of mixture, then shredded cheese on top.  The kids love this, and am requested every holiday to make for the meal, regardless if it is breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Definitely a family favorite! I leave off the cornflake topping and I find that I usually have to bake a bit longer than 40 minutes for the potatoes to get tender. Delicious and even better reheated the next day!!

Very good. Made it in the crockpot for Christmas morn, turned on high 4 hours but could have gone even five hours. Skipped the topping and sprinkled parm cheese on instead. Would make again.

Followed lots of reviewers tips.  Used 1/4 cup butter, cream of mushroom soup, and sautéed the onions. Had a great flavor, but I just didn't care for the topping. Will definitely make again without it!

Very good, comforting food. Made nearly as written the first time, just using french fried onions as the topping, put on only the last 5 minutes and uncovering. Took a good hour to bake, not the 40 minutes it says. This time I am making it for parties  (2 are in the oven right now). I sautéed the onions in butter because the flavor of the ones that went in raw were a bit much for my kids, and this time I'll use the Cereal topping but still only add the last few minutes uncovered so it can be crunchy.  Good recipe that requires very few adjustments. Edited: also had to swap cream of celery for the cream of chicken because we are vegetarians. It was a good replacement.

My kids flipped for this potato dish!  I used non-fat sour cream with good results, but it's still an indulgence based on the overall calorie count.  I skipped the cornflakes, but made sure the potatoes were pressed down well so the pieces on top would not dry out.

I never review recipes but this one deserves 5 stars - everyone at my brunch raved about it.  I subbed the French fried onions for the cornflakes, and subbed cream of mushroom for the soup.  I used shredded sharp cheddar.  It was really tasty - definitely will make again for the holidays.

This recipe is delicious...but even more delicious if the soup is cream of celery soup and the topping is Kettle Potato Chips crushed.  Almost the same, but just an edge better.

I love this recipe and my neighbor made it as written (except she put crushed French fried onions on top) last year for Christmas and her family gobbled it up!!!

It has been an old standby for many, many years and will always be a great addition to any dinner.

Have been making this delicious recipe for years. I often add a pound of country style pork sausage and now always use French's fried onion rings instead of cornflakes. Served with fresh fruit and crescent rolls, it's long been a breakfast favorite at ou house. I honestly can't remember anyone not liking it!

This recipe is similar to a recipe I got from my Grandma, who got it from an old church recipe book. Original recipe is that you peel and boil potatoes and then just kinda smash them, leaving it chunky. Then, you smash cornflakes up with a soft stick of butter and that is the topping. The onion is sautéed in more butter and is then poured on the mixture of potatoes, sour cream, and cream of chicken. It's sooo yummy!! Now that my grandmother has passed away, this is my signature dish at all holidays. I tried using French fried onions one year and the family said they preferred the butter soaked cornflakes! When the cornflakes are smashed with butter and are in the oven, it just gives it more flavor and a little bit of crunch!!

I like the flavor of the sauce, but not the texture of frozen potatoes, so now I make this with fresh potatoes sliced very thinly so I don't have to change the baking time.

I've made this quite a lot with some changes.....No butter at all. I brown 4 cut up rashers of bacon and pour most of the bacon grease in.  I don't care for onions much so I don't use them unless it's french-fried onion on the top.  I add garlic to the soup mix before I blend it in. Also cook for a full hour so it's done in the middle. Always a hit.

I've eaten this recipe many times but this is the first time I made it myself. This recipes makes a ton of casserole. It made 2 full baking pans so I was eating it all week but it's very yummy. I substituted cream of mushroom, left out the onion and used bran flakes. The bran flakes (what I had in the house) made it look a little weird but tasted the same. It's really easy!

I thought this was great.  I made it as written for a Spring brunch and everyone loved it.   Some of the other reviews are probably right that you don't need as much butter and don't need to saute the corn flakes but I didn't want to mess with it on the first try.

So good. Tastes just like the hash brown casserole I get at Disney at the Beach Club Marketplace.

Perfect side dish for just about any protein, but, I served with grilled "Unbelievable Chicken" from this site. I made as the recipe stated, but, only used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup butter in the potatoes.  I also used green onions instead of regular onions and we like the flavor and texture much better than a similar casserole I had made in the past.  Based on other reviews I cooked a little longer  - about 50 minutes and the potatoes were perfectly cooked.    Big hit with the family!  My niece packed up all the leftovers to take back to college with her for her dorm - that is winner in my book!

Me and my family were not big fans of this recipe.  It took way longer to cook than stated and just didn't taste good enough to be worth the enormous amount of calories and fat.

I made this recipe tonight, as I have never made hash-brown casserole in the oven before (have always used a crock-pot) I didn't want to wait the up to 4hrs it can take to finish cooking in a slow cooker. The dish itself was good, but made changes to fit my taste buds.

 First I reduced the amount of butter to 1/4 a cup instead of 1/2, reason for this was to compensate for the oils that would be produced by the cheese melting as well as the fact I had browned some turkey bacon and was compensating for potential drippings. Even with the reduction the dish was still fairly greasy, I also sauteed the onion with the bacon. I would suggest reducing butter content more if you feel like greasiness is an issue. 

 Secondly I did not use cornflakes I had some sandwhich bread which I took a knife and scrapped it against the grain producing bread crumbs, I then browned them in a little butter until' crisp and used that as a topping instead this was a lighter and I feel tastier alteration.

  Overall the recipe was good all-be-it greasy, but a contender for a "remake" if I feel that craving again but don't want to wait for a slow-cooker version

In general, it tasted good, but it was way too greasy. I would use very little butter or none at all to try it out.

I made this on Saturday it turned out great but I tweaked a couple of things.. I used cream of mushroom soup and French fried onions on top I also cooked it for 60 min covered then 20 min uncovered then I put more cheese and French fried onions on it and put under the broiler for a couple min..  It was really good the next day as well I put it in a skillet to get it warm a bit crispy and to melt more cheese over it...

I love this recipe.  I have made changes I use Mrs.Dash (garlic and herb) seasoning.  And I use either mushroom soup or cream of chicken what. Ever I have on hand. My family likes it extra Cheesy plus I use 2 bags of hash browns. I have been making this recipe for over 10 years and now have pasted it down to my daughter.

Really good.  We doubled recipe for family get together; mading two 9x13 glass casserole pans.  Followed recipe as written. Used half medium Cheddar and half sharp Cheddar cheeses. Increased cooking time to 30 minutes covered, then spun pans & uncovered for additional 30 minutes. Wasn't sure about the cornflakes, but they turned out good. Thanks for the recipe.

This was amazing.  They don't sell hash browns where I live (overseas), so I broke out my food processor and made my own.  I used the grater blade and grated about 2 lbs of potatoes. I put the grated potatoes into a pot of water and washed them well, drained them and washed them again.  This is a really important step, or else the starch will make your potatoes grey.  Because I already had the grater out, I grated the onion too.  Then I grated the cheese too! (Love this food processor!)  I didn't add butter (because I forgot). I definitely think this needs the full tsp of salt.  I cut it back and missed it. I did add a can of diced chilies which was an excellent addition.  I think I could even go as hot as jalapenño peppers or maybe use Pepper Jack cheese instead of cheddar.  I didn't do the topping, but like another reviewer's suggestion of the french onions for the last few minutes of baking.

Made this for dinner today to accompany baked ham and Brussels sprouts. The only thing I changed was I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of chicken and I used 2 cans of soup, (seemed a little too dry with one can of soup). In place of corn flakes I used French fried onions on top straight out of the pkg. no sauteing in butter. Better than my old recipe and I think the 1/2 cup of melted butter added to the mix makes the difference.

This is a great recipe. My husband doesn't like to crunch into onions so I used minced dried onions so we still got the flavor. I also agree with others that you could cut back on the butter in the casserole.

I had originally rated this as one star and then not explained my rating.  I have no idea how this got rated and I apologize to the poster as I have no idea how that even got rated by me.  I have tried this recipe and it is very good.  It makes a lot and I have to agree with another posted that I don't use cornflakes as I never have any.  I have used the French fried onion rings on top and that makes this recipe even better.

My 3 kids and I ate this whole thing with our dinner tonight and they all said it was yummy. I used minced dried onion because I was lazy, and used fat free sour cream. I cooked for 45 minutes covered then turned the heat to 425 and uncovered for 15 minutes.

I made this recipe for our local MOPS group and it was delicious! I eliminated the 1/2C butter and sauteed the onion in PAM before adding it to the mixture. Other than that I kept the recipe the same.

Great casserole.  I've made it many times and rarely do I use all the butter it calls for.  I know this isn't good for you, but a stick and half of butter is a bit much even for me!  Most of the time I use cream of mushroom soup, add a bit of garlic and skip the cornflake crust.  Instead I reserve about 1/2 cup of cheese and put it on top.   Other than that I make it as is and it's wonderful.

I substituted cream of celery to make it vegetarian.  Also used hash browns that already included onions to avoid that step.  Very good but too much butter.  Next time I’ll omit adding melted butter to the main mixture as it’s greasy enough with all the cheese.

This was delicious made only slight changes so I  still think it deserves a 5 star rating.  Icompleted skipped the butter that is mixed with the potatoes but added about 1/4 cup more low fat sour cream instaed.  Used 1 cup corn flakes and  1 cup fried onions.  Cooked 40 minutes covered and 10-15 uncovered. Got RAVE reviews from everyone at Easter brunch.

Excellent recipe! The only changes I make are to use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and I add more cheese.

I made this with some substitutions, and its our new favorite! I baked the hashbrowns in a 350* oven until browned on the bottom 1st, then used 1/2 garlic alfredo sauce 1/2 heavy cream in lieu of the soup & sour cream. I also added 1c bacon, & 2 chicken breasts, cubed. For the topping I used a combination of panko, french-fried onions, and crushed salt & pepper kettle chips. Its amazing. Yum yum yum!

This was a big hit and plates were licked clean.  I made slight changes.  Cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, light sour cream, used half the amount of cheese, and reduced the butter.  Even after all that, it was still plenty rich enough.  I threw in some ham to make a main dish instead of a side.  And it needed a full hour to cook.  At 40 minutes the potatoes were still somewhat crunchy.  The crumble topping went on halfway through so it wouldn't burn.  This would be superb on a lazy Sunday morning for breakfast with the addition of sausage or ham in it.  It also opens itself up to tons of variations:  pico de gallo with taco mix, w/ground beef & scallions, and you'd have a tex-mex casserole.  Can't wait to experiment.  So good.

Make as is, except I add in a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Next time: Less onion, cook longer..closer to an hour topping of crushed ritz crackers. Be sure to add full amount of butter. Less shredded cheese.

Delish!! The only changes I made were to add a little splash of milk, and I didn't sautee the cornflakes. It was wonderful and I will make again and again. In the future, I will half the recipe to use as a side dish for our family of 4, it does make quite a bit.

If you like a more blended cheesy potato flavor over the potato chunks and cheese flavor, use shredded hashbrowns instead (same bag/amount size).  Most of our guests prefer this smoother cheesier potato flavor and there is never any left over!

I halved the recipe since it was only 3 of us, and didn't want to have 1/2 of a can of soup lying around so I used the whole can (cream of celery) & omitted the butter (since some people said it was greasy).  I also used red onion which I liked the flavor it added.  I did not saute the cornflakes, just melted the butter in the microwave & added the cereal plus a little garlic powder & paprika.  The only negative was my own fault due to using the whole can of soup - it was just too much (I definitely liked not using the butter though - more creamy & less greasy compared to other similar recipes I've used).  So in the future I will make the whole recipe or just figure out something to do with the remaining 1/2 can of soup.

This is delicious! Brought it to a NYE party and it received rave reviews. Based on other reviews I only used 1/8 cup butter in the recipe and 1/8 cup on top with the corn flakes.  I also used green onions instead of regular.

This is really delicious as is, however I would recommend sauteing the onions first.  After baking for an hour, they were still a little crunchy. It could also use more spices, perhaps some cayenne pepper. But it was still delish!

This tasted great and my family all loved it, but it was a bit too buttery/greasy and the potatoes were a little firm...I did use a larger home-style cut hashbrown and cooked it for one hour to compensate, but it still wasn't enough time. Next time I will try the smaller hashbrowns and cut the butter back a bit.

Made this for my son's wedding.  It turned out perfect.  Cooked it in an electric oven since it was a very large quantity.  I didn't put the cornflake topping on.  Actually thought I made too much, but there were no leftovers!  Family has requested this dish for every family gathering since.

This is a good base recipe. I make a variation of this periodically, usually for holidays. My family just called to ask for the recipe, so I forwarded the link. I usually substitute cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken, and I like to throw in sliced mushrooms and ground sausage to make it a hearty breakfast meal, more than a side.

This was just "okay." I used the cubed hash browns and even after an hour and 10 minutes they were still kind of hard.  I thought the sour cream flavor overwhelmed the cheese, and even after cutting the amount of butter in half, it was very oily.  If I make this again I'll cut the sour cream in half, omit the butter and use shredded hash browns.

I made this for a reunion and it came out wonderful. I put in the amount of people i wanted it for and the site adjusted the ingredients for it. I ended up making 9 batches of this. I broke it up in to double and triple batches.  and diveded the product in to 3 large restaurant steam pans and a quarter sheet( cake pan). Lots of rave reviews and many asked for the recipe. Thanks so much.

I cut up my own potatoes instead of using frozen potatoes. I steam them for a while before I add them to the recipe and mix in.. I also and add cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, this recipe is on the frozen hash brown potato bag.

Great recipe! Just what I was looking for! Was very easy & everyone loved it. I had a 26 oz bag of hashbrowns, & no corn flakes, but it turned out wonderful just the same. Will definitely be a stable in our house.

Very good! I followed others suggestions and used cream of mushroom soup. I sauteed the onions in the 1/2 cup of butter and used an extra 1/4 tsp. of black pepper. Topped with french fried onions to cover( did not saute in butter-didn't need it!)Cooked for 65 min. in a 9 x 13 dish uncovered. YUM!

The suggestion that someone gave to use the french onions to top it was great!  I made this for the Easter party I went to.  It was the only dish that didn't have leftovers!

Easy and good.  I only made a couple of minor changes.  I used a package of potatoes o'brien (hash browns with the peppers/onions), only used 1/4 cup butter, and did not do the cereal/butter topping.  My potatoes weren't completely thawed so I baked mine for about 50 mins.

I think I did something wrong.  The onions were still crunchy and it didn't have that tangy taste of the usual hash brown casseroles I've had before.  It was pretty bland.

This recipe was so-so, my kids instantly looked at it and said Eeewww. I added peas because I like to have at least one green veggie for dinner -you couldnt taste the peas -well overall it was tasteless. I would suggest to add some garlic and load it up with salt and pepper. It was super easy but I do not think that I will make this again.

This was simple and good.  I had some leftover bacon so added that on top.  I didn't have cornflakes so I substituted bread crumbs and it tasted great.  Don't add the tsp of salt!  Canned soups have plenty of salt in them already.

I love this casserole, but what I do alittle bit different for the topping I would use frosted flakes. Melt 1/2cup butter and about a cup of frosted flakes --smash the frosted flakes and pour the butter of them and mix them up. Then put ontop of hashbrowns. It gives it a sweet taste with frosted flake  really good

My family really enjoyed these potatoes. I did not have crackers so made it without a topping and it was still good. I will follow one of the other suggestions next time to cut back on the butter because you could see it pooling up on top when it was done. Maybe the crackers would have covered it up and I would not have noticed.  I will make this recipe again.

I also found this recipe to be fantastic.  I was making chicken at the same time so I turned the oven up to 375 and used onions on top and they were fine.  I place the chicken pan on the top rack, however, so it maybe "sheltered" the onions enough because that pan was on a lower rack.

This recipe was very easy to prepare, but the flavor was not great.  We added crumbled bacon and sauteed mushrooms to the recipe, which helped a little.

I really enjoyed these.  I made these before, but the second time around was better.  I really enjoyed the crunchy topping.  That was my favorite part.  Husband wouldn't touch it because of the sour cream though.  I will make this again.

My cousin, the day after I served this at Thanksgiving, called me on the phone and said, "I just want you to know that I am taking the last bite of the leftover potato casserole that you sent home with me and I am very, very sad.  That was the BEST potato dish I have ever tasted!"  Will definitely be making this one again.  It was a BIG hit with my family.

I use this recipe all the time for family get-togethers.  Everyone loves it!  I don't change any of the standard ingredients but may sometimes add Onion Onion flavoring from Tastefully Simple--it'll add a great amount of extra flavor.  I do usually double everything except the butter and potatoes (but I usually use about a 30 oz package of potatoes) and bake it in a 9 x 13 Pampered Chef rectangular baker.

Very good. Not what I was looking for, but the SO and I still liked it. Made way too much; baked 1/2 right away, froze other 1/2. Perfect from freezer also. Would definitely use fried onions as topping if available in pantry. =)

I turned to this recipe when what I had planned for dinner didn't pan out.  I typed in "hash browns" in the ingredient search, and this was the first recipe that came up.  I used a bag of OreIda hash browns, the cream of chicken soup, sour cream, about a cup of shredded Italian blend cheese, the melted butter, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I sauteed Corn Chex with butter and put that on top.  I also added a can of corn to the mixture.  It looked kinda weird with the Corn Chex, but it tasted awesome.  Great base recipe!

This is very good and easy.  I used the hash browns that have green peppers and onions already in them, less sour cream and more soup, and the french fried onions as the topping instead of the cornflakes.  I am taking it to a potluck tomorrow at work and will be cooking it in the slow cooker.  We'll see how that works.

It's really good! I add Hormel bacon bits and use 160z sour cream. I almost double the amount of corn flakes while using the same amount of butter called in the recipe. It's a go to recipe for BBQs !

Made this for a large family brunch.  All age groups enjoyed this and I especially enjoyed how easy it was to make (given the many, many other foods I had to cook for this occasion).  Didn't alter the recipe and found it to taste good as is.

My family and I thought this recipe just okay in flavor.  My biggest gripe with it is that it was almost TOO rich, if that's possible.  With all that sour cream, butter, and cheese it just about made me nauseous after a few bites.  I think it could probably be cooked fine with less butter.  I could actually see the melted butter pooling at the bottom of the casserole after it was cooked.

I love this recipe! My girlfriend gave it to me years ago and we've been making it ever since. I always use the diced hash browns and rarely ever thaw it out. I normally just cook it uncovered for an hour to make sure the potatoes are cooked all the way. Also, I use spray butter on top of the cornflakes. So good!

This recipe was good and easy, but nothing special as my family said--but I really liked it.  I did alter and used two cans of the soup because I added chicken to the recipe and probably used a little more cheese and s/c as well.  I will make it again but it probably won't be in a regular rotation.

This is the 2nd time in 2 weeks I have made this so I had to leave a review!
This was YUMMY!!!  I made this on Christmas eve and put it in the oven Christmas morning and it was delicious!!  I browned some Jimmy Dean sausage and put it in the mix and it was awesome! My husband ate himself sick! :)
We have company coming so I am making it again today to put in the oven tomorrow!
Thank you for an awesome recipe!

My aunt has made this for several years for our Christmas get-together and this year I decided to try it myself for my Christmas Eve Party.  They were great.  I did chance a couple things based on other reviews.  I used cream of mushroom soup and the french fried onions.  Everyone loved them.  I like my a little crisp so I cooked them a little longer.  Will be making again.

Very good.  Thanks to other suggestions I made the following slight adjustments.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.  I sauted the onion in butter first and did not add any additional butter, instead I used a little extra sour cream.  I didn't put any topping on it.  It was a hit at a family dinner.

I love this recipe and make it often.  I only used 1/4 of butter, which was fine and I skipped the corn flake topping (only because I never have corn flakes around).  I've had it with and without the corn flakes and both are very good.  Seems to need a little more cooking than 45 minutes - maybe an extra 10-15 minutes.

I'm gonna say 4 stars, though my fiancee would have given it 10! I really didn't love the flavor of the cream of chicken soup, maybe cream of mushroom would have tasted better to me. I didn't have cornflakes, so I planned to use french fried onions. I then discovered I was out of those too, so I crushed up Cheez-Its and put them on the top. Pretty good substitute!

This is really good and easy.  I used cream of mushroom instead and topped with french fried onions like others have suggested.  I also add a can of sliced mushrooms.  Potatos and cheese how can you go wrong?

I have tried many "cheesy potato" casseroles but this one is the best.  I don't put any toppings on it but I do pour some melted butter over the top to help it brown.  I love it!

This an excellent recipe whether you serve it with fish or steak. You can use saltine crackers crushed when you don't have cornflake crumbs. flavor is just as good.

Thanks for this great Hash Brown Casserole recipe. We made this for a wedding party of 135. We are still getting great reviews from people who were at the wedding! The ratio we put in worked out perfectly with only a little left over! 
Thank You!! Annette White, Hawarden, Iowa

Made this for Father's Day.  It was a big hit. Modifications:  1/4 cup of melted butter, cream of mushroom soup,  colby shredded cheese instead of cheddar [has a tendency to be really greasy].  Other than that I followed the recipe as given. Will definately make this again!

I usually don't bother with a topping on this...and I usually use cream of mushroom soup.  This is a fantastic recipe.  Ultimate comfort food, and super convenient, since it uses frozen hashbrowns.  Thanks! :-)

I only used 1/4 cup of melted butter... we love onions so we mixed in some dry chives along with the onion it calls for & on top some French Fried Onions... I think alot could be done with this recipe though. Next time I think I might try some ham in it!

Excellent, tasty potato casserole.  I also used the cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and I cooked it for 45 minutes and then topped it with french fried onions (crumbled) and then cooked for another 15 minutes.  yummy!

Very sinful, but very tasty.  Nothing light about this dish AT ALL.  Used 2 cans of cream of chicken, didn't add any butter to the casserole itself (but did mix 1/4 c melted butter w/ 3 cups crushed cornflakes for the topping) and added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper for alittle extra zip.  Baked covered for 1 hour, then added cornflake mixture and baked uncovered for about 25 minutes.  Got rave reviews and there were no leftovers.  Will make again.

This was just what I was looking for!  This is a great recipe without any changes.  But... the onions are not all of the way done which gives this a strong onion flavor.  If you want to tame the onions I recommend baking this dish for 15 minutes before adding the corn flake topping.  Although I read a lot of suggestions mentioning changing the topping I think this recipe is the best as it is.  The corn flakes on top gave this dish a great effect visually and tasted fantastic.  For times when convenience is important you can through all the ingredients in the crock-pot omitting the topping.  Additionally this eliminates the undercooked onion problem.  You can make this a dinner by adding cooked chicken, diced carrots, and celery.  Yummy

very good!  I like the crunch the corn flakes add.  Next time, for a bit more flavor, I might add dried onions and maybe some cayenne pepper.  Will make again, though.  Makes a huge portion - good for a brunch.

Ok, I made this but w/ some variations.  I put cut up chicken in the casserole omitted the sour cream, cornflakes, and onions.  Used the cream of chix soup and everything else stated in recipe and it was phenominal!  Great leftovers as well!

I made this for a family get together and people were begging for the recipe. It's so fattening though! I'll try making it with less butter and low fat sour cream next time.

This recipe is exceptional. A definite keeper. I used hash brown patties bcos that is what i had on hand and crumbled them up into the mixture. I also used french's french fried onions instead of real ones. The cornflakes topping really make a huge difference please do not omitt. I used frosted cornflakes. My boyfriend raved about it for 2 days.

AWESOME!  I made a double batch for a Cub Scout pot luck dinner and brought barely one serving back home!  People and Scouts were coming back for seconds, thirds AND fourths!  This a one fantastic recipe!!  I put french fried onions on top instead of the cornflakes though.

***** Yummy!!!!  Needed to bake longer than 40 mins, but I used a deep dish.  I sauted the onions to sweeten them up & used ritz crackers on top.  Next time, I'm adding diced ham & green peppers.

This is a good recipe for this traditional cheesy potato casserole.  It is really creamy.  If you wanted, I think you cut cut down a bit (maybe a 1/8)of all the different fats (butter, sour cream, cream soup, cheese)and it would still be good.  I wanted to change it up a bit so I used white cheddar cheese and crushed white cheddar Cheezits instead of the cereal (I left off the step of cooking these in butter - just more fat). I also used the Orida savory Hash browns.  This added a bit of garlic to the flavor.

Delicious! The only bad thing is how devilishly good it is and eating too much of it.

Mmm....delicious---I didn't even put a topping on top and it was great--used Colby instead of Cheddar and I thought it was a nice addition.

Made this for a party last weekend... used Ritz crackers instead of Cornflakes and it was awesome!  Everyone thought that since the rest of the food was catered, this was too!  Everyone told my fiance how good it was all the way until the next day.  This will not disappoint!

I made this for a baby shower and it received rave reviews!  I had numerous requests for the recipe and there was none left, even with all the other food on the buffet.  I am not the world's best cook so I followed the recipe exactly and it was super easy.  I made the night before and just put it from the bowel to the pan, and did the topping in the morning at the same time.  I had to cook a little longer than reccomended.  Maybe too cold?  Anyway, you will not be dissappointed with this recipe!!!!!!

I made this for a church brunch.  I thought it was good; cheesy, salty, yummy.  But people went nuts over this dish.   And I mean NUTS!  Even my husband.  So, based on everyones reaction, I had to give it a 5 star.  I guess it is a real people pleaser.

I've made this casserole 3 times in the past month, and I absolutely love it (as do many in our home and church)!  I've tried it with both cream of chicken and mushroom, and both taste great.  I also took the advice of adding the topping after the 40-45 minutes, and cooking uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.

I never have cornflakes on hand, so I've tried both Rice Krispies and Corn Chex.  Probably doesn't matter what you use, because this recipe is fantastic!

I had family visiting and made for brunch this morning. I think it's a good basic recipe, but it was very bland. Also the corn flakes on top came out of the oven a little soggy. I will try a different recipe next time.

I made this for a group of 100 Bible Institute students.  It was wonderful.  One of the best cheesy potato casseroles I've had! I didn't use as much butter as it called for.  I topped it with shredded cheese the last 5 minutes of baking time instead of the corn flake crumbs since I was making it in an electric roaster which wouldn't make the crumbs crunchy.  Very delicious!

A warm and creamy potato dish.  I added a half pound of diced, fried bacon and tossed it all in a slower cooker.  Left the cornflakes off though as I thought they might get soggy cooked that way.  Very good!

I think next time I will not use the whole can of cream of celery and cream of potato soup.  It took away from the hash brown consistency.

These were really good!  I sauted the onion first.  I also used cream of mushroom vs chicken.  I baked it for one hour and then an additional 20 min uncovered.  I also added a can of green chiles - w/using 2lbs of hashbrowns - it could have almost used 2 cans of chiles or some tabasco.  I also made it the night before and let it sit out for an hour before baking.
It received RAVE reviews at a Thanksgiving for 30 people and made plenty!

This was fantastic!  Everyone kept asking which potatoes I used and actually I just put 10 potatoes in the microwave for about 10 minutes, let them cool for about 10 minutes, peeled them then grated them. They ended up being a little crunchy which was absolutely delicious.  I didn't put the topping on them simply because I didn't have any cornflakes but this is definitely a recipe that I will make again...and again.

Such an easy and versatile recipe... you really can't go wrong with this! We like it with Potatoes O'Brien, Cream of Mushroom Soup,a generous sprinkle of Lawry's seasoned salt and French's Fried Onions on top. I've found it doesn't really need that extra 1/4 cup butter, but it does take more like 60 minutes to cook. A definite keeper... everyone always goes back for seconds!

I made one of these for Thanksgiving last year, and another one for our annual family Christmas party.  Both times, it was a huge hit!  I make them occasionally just as a side dish when we have dinner at home.  It's soooooo good!

This is a great dish!  I usually just use 1.5 tsp of onion powder instead of chopping an onion, and I don't put the sour cream in because I don't like it.  Otherwise, this is one of my favorites!

What a different way for potatoes!  We absolutely loved it.  My husband and son each had seconds, very creamy, and for leftovers, I just heated with a little milk and butter.  I served this with pork chops and a veggie!!  Thanks Courtney!!

We tried this recipe this weekend and it was a HIT!! I used 2 cans of Campbells Creamy Chicken Verde Soup and I left off the corn flakes (I ran out of butter). It was great!! I had several requests for the recipe.

Awesome !!   We used french fried onions in place of the corn flakes and it turned out wonderful (added them after 20 minutes of cooking).  Cooking time was a little longer than 40 minutes but that might have been our oven.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe !!

I needed a dish to take to a brunch.  I looked for one with lots of ratings with a high start.  This was it.  It was quick to make, delicious, and nothing was left.  I will make this agian.

Awesome!  Only things I altered were sauteeing the onions beforehand, as others did & using 1 cup of milk and 1 cup fat-free sour cream, instead of an 8 oz. container sour cream. Mmmm!

Easy to make, I had a large group stay overnight so I made two batches, one with chicken soup and one with mushroom soup, think I liked the mushroom better.  Everyone seemed to like both pans.

A family favorite when the whole group gets together.  To cut down on some of the fat, I use the "healthy request" soup, low fat sour cream and omit the crunchy topping that uses additional butter. A great side dish for 15 with little or no leftovers.

I liked the recipe and so did my family but I didn't care for the cornflake topping.  Next time I will us a can of french fried onions in place of the chopped onions and then sprinkle some french fried onions on the top during the last few minutes of cooking.

A bit bland so I sprinkled a tiny bit (possibly two teaspoons overall) of taco seasoning mix on top of the topping after it was done, and then it was a kick-butt casserole.

Since I'm not a fan of sour cream, I used only half a container (4 oz.) to cut down on the sour-creamy taste.  I also added 1 tsp of garlic salt for some extra flavour.  The cornflake topping is a MUST!  Great recipe!

This is tasty and so simple. We've made this quite a few times. I don't put the corn flake topping on because that does not sound appealing to me. We just put a little shredded cheese on top to melt and it is delicious.

I thought this was a little bland, but I will probably make it again.  I added extra ground pepper and onions than it called for.  I brought it to a work lunch and everyone thought it was really good (there were no leftovers).  Thanks.

My husband and I thought this was a little bit bland. I might try it again with the addition of some jalapenos or green chiles or some fresh herbs or spices. I had some on the second day that I heated up in the microwave oven - seemed like it had a little more flavor on the second day. I think it's a good basic recipe to experiment with.

Very quick and easy. I cut down on the cheese a bit by using only 1 cup cheddar but added ½ cup fancy shredded Swiss. Also used ½ chucky hash browns and ½ shredded hash browns. A very well received side dish.

This is a delicious side dish and the leftovers taste even better!  I did, however, make a couple of small adjustments to this recipe.  I made the topping with equal parts of cornflakes and Peperidge Farm stuffing mix (not cubed stuffing).  Instead of sauteeing the cornflakes, I put the topping onto the casserole, melted the butter, and poured it over the topping.

Hubby LOVED this...I thought it was pretty good. Used less sour cream than recipe but otherwise didn't change a thing. He loved the crunchy cornflake topping too!

Great, but needs more cheese!  And I prefer Cream o'shroom soup over cream o'chik...I will make it 2 1/2 or 3 C of cheese next time...yum!

I made this recipe for a brunch party that I had a while ago and everyone loved it. I made plenty but people kept asking for more. It was easy to prepare in advance and it was a yummy side dish to my brunch party! Thank you.

I thought it was just okay.  But I am giving a higher rating based on my co-workers. Many wanted the recipe and commented that they liked it. 

I used green onions and Colby cheese. I wasn't fond of the slightly mush texture, so next time I'll try less soup and less sour cream. I thought it was too sour tasting but others disagreed. One suggested a small can of Ro-Tel which would be more to my liking.  I didn't use the crust but someone suggested using bread crumbs. I'll try that too.  Not bad. Thanks :)

Awesome recipe....Loved the taste!!!  Reminds me of scalloped potatoes except with hashbrowns.... I didn't have a 2 lb bag so I used 1lb instead...I only cooked covered 1/2 way.. Uncovered and continued to cook remainder of time-I wanted it to be brown and a little more "crunchy"...Thanks for sharing!

This has a good flavor but when I pulled it out of the oven it was still cold.  I suggest using a 9 x 13 pan or increasing the cooking time.

This was great...the only thing I changed was instead of cornflakes I sauteed some bread crumbs and sprinkled them on top.  I also added a bit more cheese just because my family loves cheese.  This was delicious.  I also made this once when I was in a hurry so instead of defrosting the hash browns I mixed everything while they were still frozen.  Worked great just had to bake it longer.

I added more sour cream than the recipe called for, and on a making it a second time, just about tripled the cheese. After that, everyone loved it.

This was a very good recipe - BUT - EXTREMELY high in fat if you leave it as is. So, I used fat free sour cream, low fat soup, low fat cheese and did not use the extra butter or corn flakes for the "topping" (the last thing this side dish needs is more butter). With all these modifications, it still turned out great (and we felt A LOT less guilty!)

This was good, but next time I will either use 1/2 the hash browns or another can of soup and more cheese.  It seemed too "dry".

Ever since I found this recipe I have made this each year for Easter and Christmas to go with my ham...  My family loves this and it has become a tradition...  To lighten it up I used the low fat soup, sour cream and cheddar cheese...  No one can tell a difference...  Thank you for giving me a tradition in my family...

These were very delicious!  I had just canned some potatoes from my garden so I diced them up and used them instead of the hash browns.  I also used cream of mushroom soup and omitted the butter.  They were a hit and I will be making them again.  Great comfort food.

So quick and easy.  We make these when we are cooking for funeral lunches at our church.  The crunchy topping really adds a great texture to the potatoes.  Everyone asks for this recipe.

Overall the dish had a good taste but it just seemed too greasy.  Maybe substituting cream soup for some of the butter??  I think I will try that next time!

I made this for dish for Christmas dinner, it was quick and easy but not a hit.  I had to bake alot longer than called for and could use more seasoning and less sour cream and cheese.

I made this as one of my potatoe dishes for Christmas Eve.  Everyone thought it was good but noboday "raved" about it.  I think it would be good cut in half and served as a side dish for a normal dinner. ( it makes alot of potatoes)  I don't think I'd chose it for a special occassion again though.

Ok I guess I don't have to repeat what everyone else has said in here, this recipe is just *TOO GOOD*!!!!  I loved the smell when it's baking in the oven and I can't wait for it to finish.  I cooked this casserole for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, it's a huge hit with family and friends, now all of my friends are coming to AllRecipes.com and looking up this one.  I used about 2x the cornflakes (crumble them really well and toast them!), the topping is what makes this one really good!

I skipped out on the crunchy topping, but the casserole was still wonderful.  Very cheesy and delicious.

My husband said they were the best potatoes he's ever had!  And he isn't the easiest guy to please!  I didn't have any sour cream, and I only had 1 cup of Cheddar cheese on hand, but nevertheless it came out delicious!

I added ham to make it a more complete meal.  We liked it but my husband thought it was too rich.  If I make it again I might use the less fat and sodium soup and such.

This was very good.  I used cream of celery soup and I thought the dish could have used more seasoning.  Maybe it was the soup I used but since I don't eat meat I didn't want to use the chicken.

I was out of sour cream but I had a mild french onion chip dip, I substituted this and didn't use the chopped onions. I also didn't put the cornflakes on top.  Regardless, it was excellant, everyone loved it, I will definately make this again.

Great recipe! I used cream of cheddar soup instead of the chicken and it was just fine. Next time I will double the topping and let it cook a bit longer. Very easy to make and a real crowd pleaser. Thank you!

This recipe was very tasty and different. It didn't last long with my husband which is nice because leftovers rarely get eaten in my household. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something different for breakfast
