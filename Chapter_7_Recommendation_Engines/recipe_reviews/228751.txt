My husband is from the Peloponesian region of Greece we liked the addition of the mozzerella cheese, but the sauce is missing approx ( to taste ) 8 whole cloves and a bayleaf....the only way my husband will eat it.

I am so sorry to be the first reviewer and not leave a rave review for this recipe.  I do love Greek food and this was OK.  Not spicy, almost bland.  I found it interesting but it is too much cheese for me.  Not sure how I could change it to something I would like better.  Sorry.
