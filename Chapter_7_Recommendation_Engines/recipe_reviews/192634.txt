Hello. I submitted this recipe and it should read DELUXE American cheese slices. 8 Slice package.  It makes a big difference to use it. Thanks for looking.

Great recipe.  I used cheddar and half mayo and half Miracle Whip.  I added boiled eggs also.  This was just like my Grandmothers.  A great easy salad.

this recipe is good but add a few drops of Tobasco sauce and a few drops of lemon juice to kick up the flavor to overcome the blandness

I love love love pea salad and I had never made it myself till now. Stumbled upon this recipe and its yum! I did add broccoli just because my husband loves broccoli it did not over take the taste of the peas either. Good for a quick side dish! :)

This recipe does take you back to the day. But I have always added some horseradish sauce ( Woeber's ) to my Hellmans and also hard boiled eggs. I usually cube Velveeta too instead of the sliced cheese. It needs to marinate in the frig to get good and cold too.

I never even heard of pea salad till I moved to Indiana, so I have bought it a few times in stores and tried it in buffets here. I love it, so decided to make it and where else to go but allreciptes right? This one is a bit different than what I have gotten here  in Indian but I love it. I took some advice and changed it a bit, used frozen peas ( 6 cups) and added half mayo and half miracle whip. Its delish.

I made this for Thanksgiving. My sister usually does it, but didn't send me her recipe, as requested.  We enjoyed it, even my son thought it looked good and had it on his plate, till he learned that it had mayo products.  My sister cooks her peas in milk before she mixes the other stuff in.  Drains them of course, and my mom said she does the same, except for she drains them again after letting it sit for a few hours, or overnight.  I do like my sisters and my moms better, but really enjoyed this one too.  Thank you.

Yummy.  Added red onion because you can't have pea salad without red onion!  I would not make this with canned peas... I think thawed frozen peas work best.  Also used a bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese which worked out well. The Miracle Whip (lite) makes this dish!  Thanks for the post!

Not a fan of canned peas.  Next time will try with frozen and add some onion.  Leftovers were great served for lunch on crackers or toast points.

Delicious!! I didn't have any canned peas so I used three 14 oz bags of frozen peas; thawed. I added 1/2 of a purple onion; chopped. Very tasty!

I omitted pimento because I didn’t have any.  I substituted diced & seeded fresh tomato. No cheese. Added shredded tricolored cabbage, defrosted frozen peas under cold running water, diced red onion & Hidden Valley Ranch Cole Slaw Dressing. Refrigerated for 2 hours to set up. Served with pan-seared oven roasted beef with steamed basmati rice.

I added chopped onion. I would have added cauliflower but I wasn’t going to pay the price for a head and only use 1/3 of it. I’ve used cauliflower before in pea salad. I will not hesitate to make this again.

Only changes colby instead of american cheese, and i added  3 boiled eggs, and some purple onion. Everyone says its the best peasalad they have ever had., and i have feed it too over 50 people since i started using this recipe years ago. I have even managed to get my husband who hates peas to  try it and he LOVES IT!!! Im telling you the colby makes it original and so much better than american.

Wonderful recipe and really good for a potluck. Has the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Only change was I used frozen vegetables. Have made several times and what I like most is it doesn't have a heavy oil after taste. Definitely best to refrigerate a day and serve well chilled.
