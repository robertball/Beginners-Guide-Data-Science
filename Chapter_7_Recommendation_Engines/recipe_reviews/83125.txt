A very simple marinade that's spectacular. I can't believe how tender the pork came out, not at all dry! You could cut it with a fork. I cut the pork into chunks and used fresh rosemary.  I added a little kosher salt and a bit more garlic.  I let it marinate all day and put it onto skewers for kabobs.  I skewered green peppers and onions separately and served this with rice.

This was VERY tasty!  I had half of a Costco tenderloin (so pretty big), and I marinated it as medallions (cut in 1 1/2" slices) for about two hours, using half the recipe for marinade.  Grilling it on my gas grill on indirect heat took about 15 minutes, and I only wish I had the whole thing!  It was very tasty.  It was a perfect marinade for us!  UPDATE:  My recommendation would be to halve this marinade unless you are grilling a huge amount of tenderloin.  Costco has cut down on the size of their tenderloins, so half did one package just fine!

Very very good meat! I doubled the garlic and used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic...I was wary of rosemary AND red wine vinegar, as both of these are things I have in my cupboards from failed recipes in the past. But on the barbeque this tenderloin was absolutely delicious. I saved the marinade to pour over the meat when it started to look dry towards the end of the cooking time, and it was a good choice.

Pretty good! I added more garlic than it called for, kosher salt, and thinly sliced pork. Easy recipe to remember, and I always have these ingredients on hand. I'm sure I'll make it again. Maybe next time I would reduce the leftover sauce and serve the pork with the sauce drizzled on top!

My family and I LOVED this recipe!  The pork was so tender.  I used the leftovers to stuff tortillas and topped with salsa.  YUMMY!

The marinade was great. I was a little surprised the balsamic vinegar didn't give a little more kick. Next time, I will save the marinade and boil it to serve over the meat for a little extra flavor. The meat was extremely tender, so I really think adding the marinade would add just the right amount of extra flavoring. It went well with garlic, cheese grits.

Easy to make.  I roasted it in the oven when the sky clouded over.  Not my favorite recipe but a nice change from the usual.

Delicious! That marinade was very subtle but nice. I like the tang of the balsamic. I used dried herbs, so just a tablespoon of rosemary. Instead of grilling I baked it for 10 minutes at 450, then for 5o minutes at 250. It came out a perfect medium well. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really easy, I used rosemary, and added minced garlic to mixture. Marinated about 4 hours, then grilled. Used thin pork tenderloin chops. We enjoyed these.

This was very good.  The pork was moist and flavorful.  I used thyme and grilled on an outdoor grill.  I simmered the remaining marinade, added 1 T dijon mustard and 1 T brown sugar and reduced until thickened.  Served over the pork it added lots of good flavor!  Will make this again.

I was not too impressed by this recipe.  It was okay but I did not love the flavor of the balsamic with the pork.  I used fresh thyme from my garden as the herb addition.  The pork was juicy and tender, but the balsamic didn't add much flavor after marinating an hour.  I reduced the leftover marinade to make a glaze and that didn't help much either.  Not bad but I won't use this recipe again.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I loved the flavor of the marinade.  My husband grilled this over indirect heat (400 degrees) for 25 minutes, then over direct low heat for another 5 minutes.  The pork was so moist and so tender.  I think this is going to be on our Easter dinner table!

Well, it doesnâ€™t get much easier than this!  I made this recipe as written using rosemary from our herb garden.  I marinated this for the better part of the day, maybe 7-8 hours.  Rather than discard the marinade, I boiled it for several minutes to kill any bacteria and Hubs used it to baste the tenderloin toward the end of the grilling time.  When the internal temperature reached 145 degrees, we took it off the grill, tented it with aluminum foil and let it rest for about 10 minutes.  Our result was a perfectly cooked tenderloin with a nice blush of pink.

Very good.  I used this marinade for a pork tenderloin that I baked in the oven.  I used some soy sauce (about 1/2 cup) and an equal amount of Balsamic vinagarette salad dressing, with fresh rosemary and garlic pepper.  Came out great!  Baked the tenderloin in the oven at 350 for about an hour.

Very very tasty and the pork was tender and juicy. I used thyme as my herb of choice and was not disappointed. The only thing I did different was to baste the tenderloins with the remaining marinade while they were grilling. Certainly a recipe I will be using again. Quick, simple, and delish!

Thyme was my herb of choice - I marinated boneless ribs-on-a-stick and grilled them on my indoor grill pan.  This marinade seems almost too easy, but the results are flavorful, moist and tender pork. The photo I took is of the leftovers that I sliced thin and reheated in a saucepan with a little liquid.  I think the flavor was even better. (But why is the featured food item in the recipe photo an ear of corn???)

I must say, the balsamic vinegar made this dish. I used the highest quality gourmet vinegar, a little extra garlic, and tossed in about 1/3 of a chopped sweet onion right before putting it in the oven. The pork came out perfectly sweet with just the right amount of flavour throughout the meat. I let it marinade in the fridge for about 4 hours, next time I think I'll let it marinade overnight. I also cooked it in my cast iron pot at 350 for an hour, and overcooked it. Next time I will cook it at 250 like someone else had done. Definately going to make another attempt next week!

Nice recipe. Ours took nearly twice the cooking time though over a charcoal grill. It didn't taste sour from the vinegar at all like I thought it might. It was basically just herby tasting. I used 1 Tbs of each herb listed.

Although the pork turned out nice and moist, it tasted a little too vinegary for my taste. It's possible I marinated it too long, of course, as one reviewer cautioned against. This marinade would be good on steak, but I like pork to have a hint of sweetness. (I actually did throw in some brown sugar to try to balance the acid, but maybe 2 tbsp wasn't enough.) I grilled sweet potatoes wrapped in foil right along with the pork, and they turned out perfectly.

I have made this several times with different herbs.  Thyme is the best.  Be careful not to marinate too long.

Recipe was OK but felt like maybe too much balsamic vinegar.  I think if I make it again I will use Red wine vinegar and less of it.

This is a great marinade recipe. It works on just about any cut of pork, and I have also tried it on chicken and steak with great results! If you are on a low carb diet, this is a great recipe to have.

This was great.  My husband couldn't stop eating. I used 1/2 white Balsamic and 1/2 dark Balsamic. Super moist and tender. Definitely a keeper!

Really excellent.  I agree with previous review.  Be careful not to over marinate.  The balsamic is best when not over done.

This is a great recipe that only needed a bit of tweaking, simply to fit my tastes.
As others suggested, I used more garlic and marinated this for a few hours, about 5 hours, and then boiled marinade to make a glaze to baste. I cooked it in the oven at 450 for 10 minutes then 250 for 30-40 minutes, basting with boiled marinade every 10 minutes. Very yummy!

Very easy and tasty.  Used dry sage instead of fresh, cut amount in half.  Have to watch the oil in the marinade for burning on the bbq.  Otherwise, great recipe!

Made this tonight and the family couldn't get enough of it.  I personally wasn't crazy about it as I found it a bit too vinegary for my taste.  I used thyme as the herb in the marinade.  I butterflied the tenderloins which made them cook faster on the grill.

I prepared pork cutlets.  I used McCormicks Sea Salt with Rosemary and Garlic (grinder) and some additional garlic. Yum. Perfect since it only had to marinate for 30 minutes. Will make this one again.

Great! I used boneless pork chops instead of a tenderloin. Served with parmesan crusted potato wedges and grilled asparagus.

Hubby and I made this today for a late-lunch/early-dinner, it was great!!  He doesn't like balsamic vinegar as much as I do but he agreed he'd like to have this again.  I used both rosemary and thyme in the marinade and they really added to the flavor!  Thank you!

Now, I REALLY DON'T like pork, but I like this!  I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard, and I also heated and reduced the remainder of the marinade to spoon over the pork.  This is what made the pork for me.

This was really quite good! I only had chicken breasts on hand as my pork was only in roast form.  I marinaded them for about 4 horus then grilled for about 20 mins.(give or take) while I basted with the leftover marinade that I had boiled off first on the stove. Hubby really liked Them as I did. Very moist and flavorful.  Served with a mixed pepper salad that I thru together and baby carrots.  Would definately do this again with chicken and will try with pork.  Not bad at all!!!

Family loved this.  I used a boneless sirloin tip pork roasts and marinated for about 4 hours then roistered on the BBQ.  The meat was tender and full of flavour.   Will be doing again.

Quick to prepare and the meat was nice and moist even though I left it on the grill a bit too long. Next time I will try and zip this up a bit with some additional spices.

We are campers, so things that are good on a grill and feed more than 2 is a must.  We made this on Halloween weekend and it was fantastic over the charcoal grill.  The outside browned nicely and the meat was very tender and the flavors of the marinade were there, but not overpowering.  I got 6 thumbs up that night for dinner, including my own.  This is going to become a regular camping meal for us.  
My first review was in Nov of 2010.  I have since made this at home in the oven in a cast iron skillet multiple times.  I have made it for friends here and for friends when I've traveled.  Always rave reviews.  We're big thyme fans so we've never tired it with anything other.   The only change I've made is that I now marinate for at least 4 hours but no more than 8.  Six years later and this is still one of our favorite pork tenderloin recipes.  Kudos!

I followed the directions and marinated for 30 minutes, then tried to cook until 155 degrees...it cooked for almost an hour and still didn't get up to 155 :P Maybe I didn't have the grill hot enough...but also the marinade wasn't really that strong. It was really easy, though, so I'm sure I'll try it again-I'll probably add more garlic and marinate longer and turn up the grill. I'm just scared it wil dry out even more...

This recipe was alright. I followed it pretty precisely but i'm just not a vinegar person I guess. My mom likes vinegar and she liked it but i could barely handle one slice. I guess i like my pork to be sweet. But you like vinegar taste you'll like this recipe.

I've made this a few times for my family and they love it. I use thin sliced pork loins which works well and cuts down the cooking time. I save the leftover marinade and reduce it to use as a sauce. I top the pork loins with sautÃ©ed mushrooms. For sides-seasonal veggies and quinoa brown rice.

This was great! When almost done I sliced it and finished cooking in a frying pan with the marinade. This was great!

Delicious.  I cooked it in the over as it was raining out.  I cooked for 10 minutes on 450, then 50 minutes at 350 as recommended by another reviewer.  I threw some potatoes in the pan with the roast the last 50 minutes.  Very good - I will definitely make again.  Next time I will try it on the grill.

Probably just personal preference at work here, but I used half the prescribed amount of vinegar and the overwhelming vinegar taste was still too strong for me. The flavors just didn't seem to blend all that well. I'll probably try it again with additional adjustments because I liked the general idea.

This was easy, low carb, lean and even the 7 year old loved it. I marinated for 5 hours and was shocked at how tasty and moist this was. I pulled the roast at 145 and rested it to 155 and was still moist!

I followed recommendations below and cooked this in the oven at 300 for 1 hr, ubtil the internal temp reached 160F. Then I put all of the sauce over the pork in the pan for the last 10 min of cooking.  I like the way the sauce tastes after baking and carmelizing in the oven. The spicy sweet combo was perfect,  especially paired with a nice malbec

I have made this recipe 3 times now, served on rolls.  All of my family agrees that this is better than steak! Thanks for the recipe.

What a way to turn boring low fat loin chops into something fabulous!  Thank you for this recipe!  I simply started with some cheap balsamic dressing added some soy sauce and chili flakes plus the garlic and rosemary as stated in recipe.  My plans changed so the chops ended up in the fridge marinating for about 3 days, I was worried but no need, they were amazing! I also reduced the marinade down to a syrup and poured it onto the chops, served with plain ole RiceARoni wild rice pilaf, yummmm!!

I modified this, as most cooks seem to do, but I'm sure using the exact recipe as is would be excellent, too. Here are my notes:
*Only need 1/4 cup balsamic, and no sage thyme or rosemary. More garlic - 8 large cloves, sliced thin. Cook 2.5 lb pork in 400F oven uncovered. Takes about 25 minutes - use a meat thermometer,keep checking until you get to 145-150F in the center of the biggest pieces. Put pan of onions back in the oven for 10 minutes while the roast rests. Probably great with a beef tenderloin, too!*
I cut a large sweet onion into thin slices, and marinated it with the pork as well. I threw them into the oven with the roast. Onions wind up looking very soft, almost caramelized. The pork is slightly pink at this temperature, perfect in my opinion. It is extremely moist and tender. I think if you cook it too long, you'll wind up with tougher, dryer meat. 
Great recipe! Try it!
