Great recipe and a great way to dress up a box of brownie mix by adding the quick addition of a creamy cheesecake type mixture. So simple and so delicious - what more could you ask for from such an easy recipe? I made sure that the cream cheese and egg were at room temp. just as you do with cheesecakes and added a cup of mini chocolate chips vs. chocolate chunks. This definitely takes regular brownies to another level of deliciousness with only a few ingredients. Have a cold glass of milk on hand 'cause you're gonna need it!

Well - I made a happy mistake.  I accidentally prepared a Devil's Food cake mix instead of brownies (same red box - oops!).  I don't know what the brownies would have tasted like, but the cake with the marble topping was FABULOUS!  I'll have to try the brownies next, but I really liked the Devil's Food cake in this.

I made these brownies and my brothers went up for 3rds!  They were a huge hit!
