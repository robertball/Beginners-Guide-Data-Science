In trying out a variety of quiche recipes from this site, I found this to be one of the best. It makes a wonderful custard-type filling. I used 1/4 cup minced green onion, 1/2 cup ham, and omitted the nutmeg. I think pie crust takes away from the quiche, so I do a quick spray with olive oil flavored cooking spray in the quiche pan, then dust it with 2T cornmeal.Second time around, I used 1/2 whipping cream, and 1/2 half and half. Great both ways, but creamier texture with whipping cream/half and half. Yummy!

Some quiche recipes require prebaking the pie crust and other recipes don't mention it.  I always prebake the crust to prevent sogginess.
This was very good, but I did add additional ham as we were having this for dinner.  I also ended up with a lot of extra egg batter, so I would recommend using only 3 eggs and 1.5 cups milk.  I did find this to be a little too salty (maybe my ham?) so I'd omit it and salt at the table.

This was the first time I have ever made quiche.  I used half & half along with 1 cup of milk.  Next time, I will probably omit the nutmeg (personal taste.  I used monetery jack cheese and minced green onions.  I baked it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for and at 400.  It set well and tasted very good!

I gave this four stars only because I had to add additional seasoning to it (I was afraid it would be too bland if I didn't, and after tasting the finished product I think I was right).  I added a bit of curry and pepper, garlic powder and what I'm sure had to be two "pinches" of nutmeg.

The overall recipe was wonderful, using smoked ham and smoked gruyere cheese.  I even used a store bought crust - which I normally don't do.  I also used fat free half and half instead of the milk, I often use it for cooking and it tasted great.

As of the following day, there were no leftovers, and that speaks for itself!

I used the suggested 1 1/2 cups of half and half and a little more ham. I also, used a deep dish pan and since I was using the pre-made crust, the top of the crust was below the top of the dish, but I was glad that I did it that way 'cos as others have said...I think it would have overflowed. I also added a little pepper. Very good recipe. Rich without being heavy.

It's been 30 years since I have made a quiche. I needed to make a dish for my daughter's 2nd grade class representing her heritage.  I found my mom's old quiche pans packed away.  I liked this recipe because it was simple and I am guessing will be well liked by her classmates.  I made a test run today and used store bought crust to line the pan.  I did keep it in the oven an extra 10 or so minutes in order to get the golden color.  Absolutely perfect looking and tasting.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This is a good basic recipe that only needs a few changes. A whole onion is WAY too much. 1/2 is plenty. Use the deep dish crust. Otherwise, there is too much filling. Also, you want to pre-bake the frozen crust for 10 minutes to avoid sogginess. I added garlic powder (1 tbl.) and cayenne (1/2 tbl) as recommended. I used half and half instead of milk and cut it down to 1 1/2 cups. There is no need to heat the egg and milk mixture before pouring it on top of the cheese/ham mixture. This keeps it from filling in the cracks. And it never hurts to throw in some mushrooms and extra ham!

I really enjoyed this quiche, but it takes some time, quite a lot more than the recipe indicates. All the quiches I've made in the past you just poured the egg/milk mixture in on the filling ingredients and popped it in the oven. With this recipe, I spent at least 30 minutes at the stove just stirring the custard until it began to thicken and I was starting to think it NEVER was going to show signs of thickening! I used more than 1/3 cup of ham, that sounded like way too little, I probably used about a cup of diced ham (from a ham steak), which I browned in a skillet until all the excess water cooked out of it (it would have left my quiche pretty runny if I hadn't done that). I also added some sauteed mushrooms. I had maybe 1/2 cup more egg mixture than would fit in the crust because of the extra filling ingredients. The 30 minute cook time was perfect, I had brown crust and the egg filling was set. You do really have to spend some time cooking that filling on the stove over low heat though to get it to the point that it's beginning to thicken. I am not entirely sure that the result was worth the extra effort, but it was a very nice textured quiche.

This was the first time I ever made quiche.  I made it for my husband (who is an wonderful cook) who said it was the best quiche he has ever had and the best thing I have ever cooked!  I will definitely keep using this recipe!

I took the advice of some other reviewers, and reduced the amount of milk (to 1 cup skim & 1/2 cup fat free half-and-half), and even so it barely fit in the pie crust. I also used monterey jack cheese, and included sauteed mushrooms with the sauteed onion. I used a little more nutmeg than the original recipe called for, and a little garlic powder. I didn't have a ham steak, so I used deli meat -- given the choice, I think I'd go with a chopped up ham steak, but the chopped up deli meat wasn't bad. It also took an extra 15 minutes to cook. But the result was fantastic! My fiance had two pieces, plus some more for breakfast the next morning (and he never eats breakfast). Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I used 1.5 cups heavy cream rather than the 2 cups milk in the recipe.  I had a bit of a problem when cooking the mixture of eggs and cream as lumps formed.  I used a double boiler the second time I made the quiche, but lumps still formed.  I am a beginner cook.  But I would recommend making sure you stir the mixture fervently and stand over it to assure the lumps don't form.

This was very tasty, and I didn't have a problem with it being too liquidy.  However, I did make the huge blunder of picking up a graham cracker crust at the store to bake it in -- D'OH!  Laziness did me in; I should have just made one myself.  We had to eat the quiche scraped out of the sweet crust.  Of course, that's not the recipe writer's fault, only my own.  I should have been paying more attention.  Hopefully someone here can learn from my mistake!  Oh yes, I also substituted regular onions out for scallions instead, and this worked very well.

Complete disaster.  The pastery didn't cook, The milk didn't evaporate.  The custard looked more like scambled eggs. 
What went wrong?

Excellent, I cooked it an extra 15 minutes.  I didn't have any onions on hand, so I fried up some fresh mushrooms and added them.

I agree that it was too much liquid and then my crust was soggy. And I personally like my quiche mixed up instead if layered, so next time I will mix the egg, onions, cheese, and ham.

I'm not sure what happened here but, 90 minutes later, my quiche is still not set and the bottom of the pan is filled with water - possibly from the ham?

I used cheddar cheese but that shouldn't have made a difference.

It's a good thing I fried up some potatoes because at this point, my dh is tired of waiting on dinner.

I'm a total beginer when it comes to cooking but found this recipe to be pretty straight forward. I had a hard time getting the custard to thicken until I turned up the heat a little higher and I also had to leave the quiche in the over for 10 minutes more than the recipe calls for. Maybe because my quiche dish is quite thick. Next time I do it I think I'll go for a little more custard filling, a little less cheese, and a little more meat.

This was ok. Seemed to lack flavour actually. And definitely did not need a pinch of salt - the ham made it salty enough.

I think there is too much liquid in this recipe, so maybe reduce cheese or milk.  Mine didn't firm up either. Didn't have the crust problem, but I did hand make my own crust.

This was very nice, maybe my first time ever making a quiche.
I tried to make it exactly as possible, but had to increase the cooking time to 35 minutes. By then, the crust edges were getting close to burning, so I stopped. Unfortunately, the quiche was fairly runny (liquid, as opposed to just oozing); this is a common problem with fruit pies I make, probably because I live at a high elevation. Despite not getting the consistency right, I thought the taste was wonderful - I'm not sure I've ever cooked with Gruyere. It is fairly easy to make, so I'll go ahead and recommend it.

It WORKED!!!! My wife says that my first quiche was better than any quiche she's ever had. Don't mind saying I was worried since I can't even remember ever eating quiche before, let alone cooking it. I minced up some pancetta instead of ham and substituted a half cup of heavy cream for the second cup of milk. I worried for nothing... the texture and flavor were lovely.

I use a deep dish pie crust and everything fit fine. I did prepare it as another person here suggested ... for about 10mins. I only added some sautéed  mushrooms and 3 cubes of the frozen spinach  (which I drained real good). I mixed all the ham, onions, mushrooms and spinach together and then placed on the bottom on the crust. I sprinkled the cheese on top, I'm not sure what kind of cheese I used but it was a nice strong flavoured one I had on hand. This is my first time making a quiche and I think I didn't take the egg/milk mixture off the heat quick enough...once it gets a bit thick it goes quick and I didn't know how thick to make it. Anyway, it poured nice over the other ingredients, maybe a bit too thick near the end but it all fit in without overflowing. It's cooking now so we will see how it comes out.....
WOW... it tastes so great!  the crust  on the bottom is a bit soggy, think next time I will bake it a bit more before I add all the fillings. I ended up cooking for about 35 mins. I think too I will mix all the fillings in with the egg so it's all spread evenly throughout. I thought the egg was too thick going in but the consistency  is great. I'm pretty happy for my first time though.

I love this easy recipe!  Substituted with baby swiss cheese instead- recipe will make enough for 2 quiches.  So good - kids ate it up!

The only change I made was the Gruyere cheese I used was smoked apple.  There are too much ingredients to fit in a 9" pie crust.  Baked it for 60 minutes instead of 30 minutes.  It has a watery bottom.

This is a good recipe, but I think the cheese amount is suppose to be 1/2 cup not 1/2 pound

Awesome!  The whole family liked it. I substituted kraft fat free cheddar for the gruyere cheese.
