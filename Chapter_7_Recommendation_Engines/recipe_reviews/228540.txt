These are really tasty! I like the addition of Worcestershire sauce! Made these for our football viewing pleasure :) Will definitely use this recipe again!

These were good!!  I just think the only thing was the cream cheese mix could have used a little garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Baked up nicely :)
