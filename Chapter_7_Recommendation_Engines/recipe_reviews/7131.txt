I really love this bread toasted with a little butter.  Didn't have any vital wheat gluten so I used 2 teaspoons of yeast instead of 1 1/2. The bread didn't rise as much as regular loaves, but the texture is wonderful - not too heavy.  I will definitely make again. (Costco has wild dried blueberries at a significantly lower price - and they're great!)

Great foundation recipe for blueberry bread!  Way to go Julie!  Some mentioned that their bread turned green, the reason the bread turns green is if the berries are added at the beginning of the bread cycle, you must wait till the second rise cycle (the normal time for additions such as nuts, raisins, etc, to be added.)  I thought the bread was fine, but my husband (who is a little finicky) requested some alterations and WOWOWOWOWOW did it turn out great!  In lieu of wheat gluten, I used a total of 3 tablespoons of bread yeast.  I also used butter instead of oil, added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt, increased the sugar to 4 Tbsp, increased my berry amount to nearly 1 cup, AND.... I added a few drops of coconut extract and vanilla extract. ... We now call it "Oh My God , Bread".  Happy Baking!!

I really enjoyed this bread.  I added some lemon juice and used soymilk instead of buttermilk because of my diet, but even so it tasted amazing.  I ate it warm, in chunks, covered in soymilk.  It's not too sweet, really easy to make, and the dried blueberries didn't break up in the bread machine.  Great stuff.

I made this bread this morning for brunch and it was yummy.  I used 2tsp bread machine yeast instead of the active dry yeast and wheat gluten.  I also used regular milk and lemon juice since I didn't have any buttermilk.  I didn't have any problem with the loaf rising and the texture was great.  Some of the blueberries got chewed up in the kneading which gave the bread a green color so my toddlers wouldn't touch it (more for me!) but there were still whole blueberries in every bite and the loaf had a good flavor.  I ate it right out of the machine with butter this morning and am looking forward to toasting some with butter or cream cheese later.  I did have to add a good bit of flour during the second knead to get the dough to form a good ball but the end result was great...I'll definitely be making this one again!

This reminded me of the soft interior of a blueberry bagel!  I made this according to the recipe and it came out great.  My dried blueberries were on the soft side so the dough started to get sticky when they were being mixed in.  I watched over it and added small amounts of flour, as needed, during that part of the kneading cycle.

This was great bread;. Very easy and a big hit with the group of toddlers and moms I served it to. It's also delicious with cream cheese on it.

I made this for the kids yesterday, and they seemed to like it.  I used 2tsp of yeast instead of the wheat gluten, and it turned out fine.  Next time I'll take out just a little earlier than the bread machine's set time for an even better loaf.

My husband loved this.  Dried blueberries were pricey so I tried the blueberry infused Craisins. Perfect!!  Will definitely make again. No gluten so I increased the yeast to 2 tsp.

I thought this tasted good. However, it reminded me a little more of a large bagel than bread. It is a dense and slightly chewy bread. I am not familiar to making bread with added wheat gluten, so not sure if that contributed to that. It is not a very tall loaf either and I assume the recipe was also maybe intended for the older machines that made smaller loaves. I accidentally added the dry fruit at the beginning and not at the beep. As a result the dough was blue, however the final result was a normal looking loaf. After this first knead, and before the first rise, most of the dough seemed to be on one side of the machine due to its density. I gently flattened it some to continue the rest of the process and it baked more evenly. My only ingredient change was souring milk, for the buttermilk. I think that worked fine. I also realized I purchased blueberry juice infused cranberries, instead of blueberries, and that also worked okay. While baking it smelled like a toasted blueberry bagel. It was a little too dense of a bread and a little trial and error, so not a repeat recipe. However, I liked trying a different flavor of bread. I sliced it, with my bread slicer, to have for toast on some mornings.

Absolutely delicious!  Used dried blueberries 1st time which was gone by the end of the day. 2nd time I mixed dried blueberries with chopped dried pears. That loaf was also gone by the end of the day!
