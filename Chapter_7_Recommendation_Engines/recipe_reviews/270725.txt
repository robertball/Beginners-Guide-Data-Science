This turned out pretty good. The rice vinegar is optional but I found it necessary. It needed the acidity. For the lemongrass I used the Gourmet Garden brand that comes in a tube in the produce section. I keep that on hand since fresh isn't easy to come by. I think the combo of flavors in this recipe would work great on any greens.
