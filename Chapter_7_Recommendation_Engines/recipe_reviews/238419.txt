Liked it VERY much!! I put a little TOO much garlic I think. Next time I will put one clove.  I added two cloves, but they were rather large.  Will make this again!

My first time making pesto. This is delicious. I followed directions exactly as written. I toasted the walnuts in a skillet on stovetop. The heat brings the flavorful oil flavor out.

This pesto is excellent. I made a small portion for 2 to give it a shot. I added a bit of the pasta water to the pesto for extra thickness. This was excellent. I will make this again!

Took cues from the other reviewers and double the olive oil (I used light olive oil), and threw in about a teaspoon of garlic salt (I tried it without, and it was very bland).  I don't have a fancy Oster blender, so I had to pulse it a few more times :)  I love the nuttiness added by the walnuts, and was trying to use up some fresh herbs in my kitchen before they go bad this week as I'll be gone.  I ended up freezing the whole batch, which fit perfectly in one of those sugar cannisters, and I'll be using it in pastas next week.

Yes I used less basil because I didn't have enough. I used slightly more Parmesan, more cheesy. and I threw some oregano maybe 1/8 cup into it. 
Plus I used course pink Himalayan salt.

I've made a recipe like this before and liked it . This time I over processed it and it was bitter. Also used 1/2 the called for salt but it was very salty.highly recommend the walnut basil combination.

It was very thick. The flavor was good, but I would not use this on egg noodles again. It would be good as a sauce on my zucchini pizza or something similar.
