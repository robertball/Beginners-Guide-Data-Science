I used no boil (gluten free) noodles but boiled them for 4 minutes anyway. The trick with this dish is keeping the noodles separated while mixing them with the cheese mixture. I used silicone tongs to manually separate the noodles while stirring. Reading the title, I expected a lighter dish. This is a rich and cheesy lasagne that will satisfy you. It went nicely with a light salad.  Thank you for the recipe.

i did make this almost according to the recipe.  the only thing i added was about 1 c. tom. sauce as i didn't think it would be saucy enough.

i made it for a casserole dish (about 11 x 9).  i used 8 noodles, 12 oz ricotta, 1 c. motz,  3/4 c. parm and 1/2 c. asiago (only because i had lots of it).

i cooked the noodles, THEN cut them into smaller pieces - no problem with them sticking together that way.

this is a great way to make lasagna but my guest and i did agree that it would be good with gr. beef in it.

also, cottage cheese (pulsed in the food processor) would be just as good, and a lot less expensive, than ricotta.

i would make it again as it was easy to assemble, used a lot less cheese (which can be expensive) and was very good with a side salad and a piece of garlic bread.

Too many noodles and not enough cheese!  Lacked in flavor.  I added some sweet Italian sausage and garlic which helped but still way to bland! I will try again but will add some traditional spices, fewer noodles and more ricotta cheese!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  He other reviews werenâ€™t very helpful as they added ingredients, used different kinds of noodles, or less cheese.  Basically the whole thing was a cheesey, gloppy, mess.  It needed more flavoring than what the cheese could supply.  I would make a cheese sauce with the ricotta and maybe some chicken broth and definitely add some steamed broccoli or spinach.

Loved it! I love lasagna, but my boyfriend isn't as crazy about it. This doesn't require sauce and it is easy.
