I do make this dish in the crockpot, I just layer the ingredients in the bottom of my crockpot and cover it with beef stock and let it cook all day. Sometimes, I throw in some dried basil/oregano and a bay leaf or two, depending on if I think of it. This also makes a great stroganoff by adding a cup of sour cream before serving. When I make this, there's never any leftovers.

This was very good. Definitely a keeper. I made this in the crock pot as directed in the footnotes. Made this for company and there were no leftovers!

I made this recipe pretty much as stated, but doubled it to have left-overs and cooked it in an electric pressure cooker. The only thing that I didn't double was the beef stock - I used 4 cups of homemade beef stock. I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand, so I used 2 4 oz. cans of mushrooms (probably should have used at least 3 cans), and used top round steak. After browning the meat, and saut√©ing the onions and garlic, in the pressure cooker, I added back the meat and the rest of the ingredients. I also added 1/4 cup of red wine. I pressure cooked everything for 20 minutes on the beef setting and let it slow release the pressure. Since I didn't double the amount of beef stock used, I didn't double the cornstarch/water mixture, but found that I had to double that so the gravy wasn't watery and more like gravy. I served it over mashed potatoes, and my family loved it. By doubling the recipe, I had enough for 3 meals for 3 of us. So we have two more meals to look forward to. The next time we have it, I will try it over egg noodles. Thanks for the pressure cooker recipe, Dennis. It was great, and I will definitely make it again.

My family & I loved it!   Followed the recipe, but I used round steak instead of stew meat.  I used my pressure cooker.   I also used my own homemade beef stock.  Will make again and again!

I don't have a pressure cooker. I simply used a large stew pot. I didn't have egg noodles, so I used rotini noodles. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was FABULOUS! Even my finicky 14 year old liked it.. AND asked for more!(I even got a "thank you")

It's a good basic recipe but a little bland for my taste so I added the following:
2 tsp Redwine Vinger
2 tsp Better Than Bouillon or 2 bouillon cubes
2 Tbsp tomato paste
2 to 3 Tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce
The flavor profile greatly increased and was quite delicious!

This was my first attempt at making beef tips and noodles. This recipe was very easy and delicious! The only change I will make next time is a little more corn starch to make the beef tip mixture a little thicker. Will make this again!

I'm on a gluten free diet and I was able to adapt this very easily.  I browned the meat in seasoned flour before baking and used beef broth instead of water.  Gluten free cream of mushroom soup comes in 12 ounce boxes, so the gravy was pretty thick.  Next time I'll increase the amount of broth to loosen the gravy.

The verdict was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!  It was just like I remember having when I was younger.  It was even better the next day.  This recipe will now become a regular feature in my menu planning.

I think it came out great... I did use about twice the meat and probably more corn starch, but it was delicious and the meat was falling apart.  I just picked up a rump roast and cut it into cubes... perfect!

I can't imagine how runny it would have been if I used 32 oz of beef stock -- or how bland it would have been as written.  I used 16 oz of beef bone broth and it was still too thin.  I added both red wine (maybe 1/4 c?) and Worcestershire sauce  (several tablespoons).  To thicken it, I added about 2x as much corn starch and 1/2 as much water.

I did make it, but I deviated a bit from the recipe.  I browned the meat, onions & garlic in a frying skillet prior to using the instant pot.   Then followed the remaining recipe as written
. T he recipe was delicious!

I didn't use stew meat instead I opted for sirloin steak cut into bite size pieces. Didn't and wouldn't adjust anything else.  My new Go To beef noodle meal.

It was very tasty but too much liquid.   It would need twice the corn starch to thicken it up.

I made this in the slow cooker. The flavor was good, but there was far too much broth. Even the 3Tbs of corn starch didn't thicken it enough. Next time I'll use less to start but do more to thicken it before serving.

Also, 1lb of noodles is not enough for 3 adults. Next time I will probably make extra noodles as well.

It was way too much broth for me, it was the consistency of soup.  I think half the broth and some gravy would be better.

I sauteeed the onion with the beef.  I also left the mushrooms whole and did not bother saut√©ing first... just popped them in the IP with the other ingredients when it was time to seal and set. I will definitely make this again, as even the picky children enjoyed it!

I liked it.  But it does seem as though some sort of flavoring is missing...I'm not much of the chef so I'm not sure exactly what else it needs...besides salt.  Good enough though

Made just as described, although we did add more meat. It seemed like the gravy should be thicker, but everyone loved how tender the meat was.

Good, but not great. It needs a fuller flavor. I melted some smoked gruyere cheese on top and that helped, but it needs more.

A bit runny.  Added a cup of sour cream to make it creamy.

I used the pressure cooker for this. It was easy. The meat was tender but the sauce was bland.

This had a good flavor.  If I could have gotten the broth to thicken, I would have given this 5 stars.  Added cornstarch and water, but could not get it to thicken.  Used beef cubes and they were really tender.  Made in the crockpot.  Will make again and use less broth.

My husband said this is between a 3 & a 4 star recipe!  That is awesome as he never likes anything!  I liked it also!  This is a keeper!

Was very tasty but was very runny.  I used the cornstarch as instructed but it still had too much liquid.

Made this in the crockpot, everyone loved it! Seasoned and seared the meat, otherwise made as directed with slightly less broth as I used a bit less meat.  Thank you!

I used the crockpot and put the noodles in too early and had a mushy meal to eat. I suggest cooking the noodles on the side or doing it via the pressure cooker as the recipe calls for.
