Yay, I am the first to rate this!!! This was really elegant and extremely tasty. It is the easiest thing to make and everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was wonderful. I also watched the video which Chef lets you know a few different things you can use in place of some of the ingredients. I used sherry and it was delicious. I also made this for a family get together so I quadrupled the recipe without any problems and like I said it is so easy to make. I also made a beet salad with this and had some white wine. And as always Chef John, perfect. Thanks again :)

So good! 

just want to thank the last reviewer for speaking up about the origin of the recipe.   My European family has been eating this for many generations.  I have my Nonna's  hand written recipe which  was handed down from her Nonna. It is almost exactly ( my Nonna didn't use cayenne)  this recipe but it is called Chicken Franchese.   SO GREAT 

Like several of the other reviewers, I too would cut back on the lemon, and disregard the cayenne.  Also keep your chicken stock handy in case the sauce gets too thick while heating. 

*We always make extra sauce, and serve it over pasta so every taste of the delicious sauce can be enjoyed. 

thank you

FYI   My Nonna was born in the  Amalfi region of Italy (southern) where this recipe is a staple for all kinds of dishes i.e. mostly veggies like eggplant, but also used for chicken, veal, and pork that's pounded into thin cutlets. The style of preparation is called "indorato" which translates to "encased in gold"

Hubs and I really enjoyed this Chicken French last night!  Having said that, let me say that I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic.  The amount of flour indicated in  the recipe is a ridiculous amount!  For  two small chicken breast halves (about 5 oz. each),  I used just 2 T. of flour and 1/4 t. of salt and pepper, along with the pinch of cayenne, and I still didn’t use it all!  I beat one egg and the milk in a pie plate, dredged the chicken in the flour mixture and dunked it in the egg.  I covered the pie plate with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator about an hour before dinner, as Chef John mentions in the video.  I browned the chicken for 4 minutes on a side over medium heat and removed it to a warm oven.  For the sauce, I had to use chicken broth, but kept the other ingredients the same, except the lemon juice, which I cut way back, using just 1 t. for my version.  The sauce didn’t thicken for me, so I did add a little cornstarch/water, just enough to give it some nice body and “cling,” which really helped.  The only thing I would change from my version next time, would be to put the parsley in at the very end.  It tended to darken after the chicken was added back in and reheated.  Next time, I will add the parsley after plating the chicken, but before spooning the sauce over the top.  All and all, a great recipe, and one we’ll be making again!  Thanks, Chef John!

Another home run for chef John!  The dish is excellent ( a bit too much lemon for my personal taste) but the technique is perfect.  Unfortunately this site completely missed the mark as to the origin of this dish.   It is a very traditional recipe from the old country.   It's original name is chicken Francese. ( which translates to chicken French ) Tyler Florence also has a great version of this recipe   I lived in Rochester for years and it is served in many restaurants.   I have also eaten it in Italy, and I have been in Dallas for about 35 years....  And it is served at every Italian restaurant too !   Not sure why there is confusion about this being a dish created created in NY.

I love this recipe so much that the other night I made it using filet of sole.There wasn't a scrap of fish left.Even the kids asked me to make it again soon.I do agree with other reviews that it's too much lemon;I cut it to one lemon and it was perfect.

This was absolutely delicious!  I read other reviews and decided to cut the lemon from 2 to 1.  2 would have been a sour piece of chicken, but with 1 it was darn near perfect.  This is going into the rotation!

Wow! This was great and super easy! I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic. I omitted the milk and added some chopped parsley in with the egg so the parsley was actually on the chicken. I used dry white wine instead of the sherry and chicken broth instead of veggie. I don't think the changes I made would make huge taste differences, so yes, this is another 5 star recipe for sure! Thanks Chef John!

Simply amazing!! I even almost screwed this up on accident by forgetting to brown the chicken in the oil and butter and started to reduce the liquid when I realized, oh  I missed a step. This is hands down the best chicken recipe I have ever tried! My husband was so impressed that I think I am going to have to make it again tomorrow so my parsley doesn't go bad! The lemon is amazing in the dish if you put the right amount of butter in it. I am addicted to this chicken, just can't get over that flavor. Thanks Chef John, your recipes never fail.

This is sooo good. I went with the other comments and used just one lemon. My husband said half a lemon would have been perfect. It tastes like the chicken you would get at a diner! This is definitely going to be a staple in our home for dinners!

Very good, fast, inexpensive and tasty! everything Chef John says it is. Husband loved it, added benefit. Will make again soon. Thank you Chef for the recipe. Made again but used only one small lemon juiced. First sauteed 8 oz mushrooms - reserved to a plate, then proceeded. Also refrigerated chicken for two hours after breading in egg and flour.  Chose to thicken sauce with 1 TBLS  corn flour and 1 TBLS water. Added shrooms and chicken to final simmer. Oh So Good!!

This was very good and tender chicken!  I followed the recipe almost to the tee but had to use a little brandy (1/4 cup) since I didn't have any sherry and decreased the butter in the sauce by almost half and it  was still rich and tasty.  I will make this again as it really is pretty easy!

I just made this. I used one large lemon and it was too much lemon. It's okay. I was really hungry and was munching on the chicken before i made that sauce, and it was so good! This was the first time that i had ever reduced a sauce, so maybe next time, i will use less lemon. I have to work on it. Thanks chef john for teaching me how to cook!!

Very good, however there is too much lemon juice for our taste, I've halved it. Pork chops can be substituted for chicken. Instead of reducing the liquids I've thickened it with a little cornstarch and broth in order to have more sauce to put over pasta or rice.

Added more than a 'pinch' of cayenne and a little more sherry,  but that is just our preference.  Maybe capers next time?

I wish I would have read others reviews.. Way too much lemon for me, and the sauce didn't thicken.  I will try again as it was easy and I can see the potential,  but like others, my sauce didn't thicken either.

Chef John, I love you and your recipes.  This was quite simple, the cooking time quick and it tasted delicious (I thought my 84 YO mother was going to lick the plate).   I followed the directions as written,  it was perfect (I hate reading reviews of all the changes the "wanna be" cooks make, they are completely different recipes when done).

Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  How about a nice basil/wine/chicken recipe now that summer is coming and my garden will be overflowing with fresh basil.

My family enjoyed it, but for me the vegetable broth sauce was just OK.  I pureed the leftovers in the food processor, added some curry, and enjoyed a very tasty chicken salad, though!  Thanks!!

I made the chicken following the recipe right down to the tee and Chef John did not disappoint. Make sure your chicken is flattened out universally or it will not cook at the same rate. Made it with some Chef John mashed potatoes which were poured over with the remaining sauce

This was a light, refreshing chicken dish. It came together quickly, make sure all your ingredients ready. I only used 1 lemon, as I was making for just 2. I served it with roasted green beans.

Delicious, elegant and easy! As far as changes, next time I’ll use 1/2 cup of flour to dredge and only 1 lemon. Because I make chickwn piccata regularly it reminded me too much of that dish. However, go by chefs John directions and decide. Oh, for a side dish made roasted cauliflower and broccoli. This is a regular on the monthly roster. Thanks John!

This is one way to bring excitement to a typically bland chicken. And at a just right ripeness. Also, Chef John is right - this chicken preparation does not need a lot else on the plate - all of them will detract from the excellent flavours of the chicken and the sauce.

This dish has potential with a little tweaking. My sauce was a too bitter.  Next time I make it,  I'm going to try less lemon and a different wine.

I love the flavors in this recipe! I followed it exactly and it was fantastic. I added some spinach to the sauce for color and a little bit more substance. I'll definitely make this again!

Excellent! I used less lemon just because I personally rarely like a lot of lemon in meats. That's just a personal preference. Chef John always makes excellent food and I never have altered any of his recipes until now but I did just because of that preference I have.

As others have said, this is a lovely presenting dish that is easy to prepare. The egg coating fries up beautifully and gives a much richer flavor to the chicken. It is helpful, though, to have all of your ingredients ready to go since it is such a quick dish. I try not to stray from the original recipe the first time I make it, but since so many people mentioned that it was too lemony, I did cut back on the lemon and the amount of flour. I love lemon, but I'm glad I did - in fact, I will cut back on the lemon a bit more when I make it again - and I will definitely make it again! Like others, my sauce did not thicken, so next time I think I will add a cornstarch slurry to help with this.  I also sauteed some mushrooms to serve with this dish. It just seemed right! You really should give this one a shot!

I don’t eat chicken but my family loved this traditional Rochester favorite. Makes a mess but so worth it. I doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers and they were gone in a day. Best served with linguini or other pasta. We like roasted Brussels sprouts with it!

This was great!  I even screwed up the sauce a bit by not reducing it before adding the butter. Still delicious!  Betting it will even be better if I do it right next time!

I only had thighs, so I trimmed all skin and fat and they cooked up marvelously!  I would go just a smidge lighter on the lemon juice... but my lemons were very juicy! Family LOVED this dish.

I've made chicken French before, not specifically this recipe, but this chicken French blew the other I made out of the water. My only suggestion is either to use 1 BIG lemon or two smaller sized ones. I made the mistake of using 2 big ones and it seemed like it took away the other flavors from the sauce. other than that, we had no sherry in the house so I substituted with some Marsala instead.

Made per Chef John's directions: Spot ON and quite easy to create! Perfect balance between the butter, white wine/sherry and lemon juice; was reminded of Chicken Piccata--but  something of a very subtle, but  slight smoky tint to the sweet "tang".  Paired off beautifully with creamy spinach Alfredo pasta and soft, fluffy warm biscuits. My sauce DID thicken; as it did, so grew the wonderful lemony citrus aroma!

So good! I have to admit, I have lived in Rochester, NY my whole life and never realized this was a local thing until I decided to make this recipe tonight and saw Chef John's description of the dish. It was amazing, good job Chef John! I paired it with rice and roasted brussels sprouts. Delicious!

Thank You for this recipe for Chicken French! It's so easy to whip together. This is the second time I've made this so far. I added some parm cheese at the end while stirring in the butter for a little salty taste. I used vegetable stock and added some chicken stock later on as I thickened it too much. My husband couldn't speak, he just kept eating and saying "mmmm!" It's one of his favorite dishes now!

The only change made was cooking whole garlic cloves in the oil before adding chicken cutlets. At first I was concerned it might be too lemony for my for my grandson but once the chicken is added to the sauce it is the perfect combination.
We loved it!!

So easy to make! Liked the recipe very much! I used Meyer lemons and I think even with them it was a little bit too sour for my taste. Will cook again and try with a little less lemon juice. Thank you!

Once again, Chef John hits the mark.  I used two large chicken breasts and cut them into quarters length wise.  After pounding them I coated them in the flour but then left them in the egg mixture until ready to cook, about two hours.  I did not wait long enough for the sauce to cook down and thicken before adding the remainder of the ingredients but it did not make much of a difference.  The flavor was wonderful.  Will make again.

Will definitely make again. Did as others suggested and reduced the amount of flour (1/3 of a cup was plenty for 2 pounded chicken cutlets) and used the juice of only one lemon. Didn't have any Dry Sherry on hand so used Madeira in lieu of. Easy to make (essential for me). The flavor and tender chicken made it a delight to eat.

It's good and edible, but I don't understand all the hype of how delicious it is. It's mediocre, at best. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except I only used the juice of 1 lemon, and that was plenty! I think it's worth giving a try once, but I doubt it'll be a regular in my house.

This was wonderful.  Made it 2 times in same week.  2nd time we thickened the sauce with corn starch rather than reducing it all the way.  This really pulled the full flavor into the sauce.

This was delicious! I doubled the sauce except for the lemon as I forgot to get more, thank goodness because two was plenty. Any more would have ruined the dish. As it was- I really loved it, but my boyfriend and kids thought it was too much lemon flavor.

I made this recipe last night and overall it was a hit!  Though I wanted to pair it with some spaghetti noodles like my local Italian restaurant does, so I added the noodles to the chicken and sauce after the noodles were cooked of course and I did end up having to put in some more broth and a little more lemon just to give it more sauciness but it came out really good thank you!

Then only thing I changed was the amount of lemon juice, I used only one.  The flavor of the sauce was ok, but it wouldn't thicken. My wife said it was "fine", not a ringing endorsement to me.  My family says I'm too tough on myself. Certain med's effect my taste buds, I try to keep that in mind when judging a dish.

I added garlic salt in the flour mix. Instructions not clear as to what to do with the e gravy, so I poured it into a glass bowl, and spooned the gravy over the chicken as it cooked in the skillet. Had mashed potatoes and green beans (both from our garden). Easy recipe to follow. Final product very tasty. Will make this again.

Delicious!  Another fantastic recipe from Chef John!     -    I used pounded chicken breasts, dried parsley and cooking sherry (gasp!)  I also used 1 lemon instead of 2.  I think it could still be good with the juice of 2 lemons, but I knew my picky husband and daughter would object if I did so.

As with many recipes (not just Chef John's), I found that the prep+cooking took waaay longer than the estimates.  Also, it is messy:  frying always is.  You may want to make this on a day when you are not in a rush.

When I make this again, I will still use the cooking sherry (it worked great!), I'll stick to the reduced lemon, and I will add a bit of corn starch to the sauce.  Oh......I'll also triple the sauce so I can have leftovers to put on anything and everything I can think of.  I might even drink it.

We kept the recipe exact to the original and it was very lemony which I liked and very delicious. We served if over rice with a side of mixed vegetables. It was tangy with lots of flavor and a great dinner worth making again :-)

Very light and tasty, relatively easy to make.
Tastes like chicken in a thin omelette batter!
I bet you could add cheese to the sauce too!

Rave reviews from my family! I followed the recipe closely.  A few tweaks - I marinated the chicken breasts in italian dressing overnight. I used only 2 eggs and 1 tbsp milk for the egg wash (and still had plenty extra). I doubled the broth and sherry for the sauce, while only using the juice of 1 lemon. This was served with roasted brussel sprouts and rice, to absorb the extra delicious sauce. Next time, I intend to use a meat tenderizer and flatten the chicken prior to browning. It's been added to my menu rotation for sure!

This was delish ! I used chicken tenders and pounded them slightly. They worked beautifully and were very tender.  I used Marsala wine because that is all that I had on hand. I would have preferred Sherry and will use that next time, but the Marsala worked fine. The lemon was great.  This is a keeper and would be an amazing dish to serve at a dinner party.

Great recipe. I did substitute red wine for sherry (because that's what I had on hand) and used one lemon instead of two. I think using two would have made it too acidic for my tastes. It was really good served with garlic mashed potatoes....I guess substituting ingredients with what you have on hand/what you like/what meets your dietary restrictions, makes you a "wanna be cook" instead of someone who simply enjoys cooking.  How is the weather up there on your pedestal?

A very nice change up but for me, it wont replace a regular sauce pizza.  I  used a large pizza pan (air bake) and stretched the dough to fit. . . only used 1 cup of ranch because that seemed to be plenty and it was.  I would probably use less next time as it really tarts up the cheese- maybe 3/4 cup.  It seemed like a lot of cheese and I used a lot of veggies: sliced mini peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, black olives, onions - and  I diced some pepperoni to spice it up all of the cheese.  Because I added extra veggies I baked a little longer- the crust and cheese started to brown around 25 minutes.  It really turned out good.  Nice flavors in all of those veggies melded together with the cheese.

Despite it looking really ugly in the beginning--like a misshapen omelet monster--it turned out yummy. I had to sub apple cider for cherry, which gave the sauce a nice fruitiness.. My cooking time was 10-20 min longer than listed, so be prepared.

Delicious.  It seems fancier than it is, but is simple enough for a weeknight dinner.  Didn't change a thing (except I have to use almond flour instead of wheat).  It's probably even yummier with regular flour!

This was fabulous! I recommend 1 teaspoon of lemon juice instead of lemons. I also you parsley flakes instead, and was sad due to the results, because all you would feel is leaves. I used 1/4 of parsley flakes if you don't want strange texture. I didn't you sherry and still great and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, Makes it REALLY REALLY good!

I have never made this dish before and found the recipe simple, and extremely easy to make.  I went from the video to completing the recipe on my own and it was fantastic!!  The chicken was so full of flavor and beautiful served... everyone loved it!  The only thing I would change is to double the sauce ingredients as we couldn't get enough!  I had made extra chicken and we made cold chicken sandwiches the nenxt day with wheat bread and Helmann's olive oil mayonnaise... this will become a weekly special in our house! Bravo Chef John!

This is a very good recipe.  I use 1 lemon and about 3 oz. of pineapple juice.  ( I buy the small 6 oz. cans and keep them on hand.) I also use 1 tsp chicken base.  I serve with noodles.

I made the mistake of  not reducing the liquid enough, so had to thicken it a bit using corn starch and water. I also reduced the amount of lemon juice....my two lemons gave an excessive amount of juice that was way too much for the sauce.  Also, I will brown the chicken a bit longer next time to darken the color and give a crisper texture to the coating. Very delicious flavor, though.

Way too much lemon.  I added another 2 cups of broth to offset the bitter taste.
