I left out the salt.  Plus I didn't have honey mustard, so I used 2 tbl. of mustard and one tbl. of honey.  After tasting it, I decided to drizzle in some maple syrup, as well for a tiny extra sweetness.  I used two pork tenderloins and added thinly sliced potatoes, carrots and peas.  I drizzled the marinade over all and roasted for 15 minutes at 400, then lowered the temp to 350 and roasted an additional 30 minutes.  10 minutes under a foil tent and it was the most delicious pork tenderloin I've ever made in 36 years of cooking.  Thank you!!!

I made this recipe as written using a 2 pound pork roast.  The only thing I did differently was to add all the ingrediants to the zip lock.  Then I let it marinade in the bag for 2 days (because I forgot about it). I made sandwiches on garlic bread and added provolone cheese and broiled for a couple of minutes to brown the cheese. Both of my sons had 2 big sandwiches and said it was the best they ever had.  I will definetly add this to our rotation. This is a very easy and tasty recipe. Plus there wasn't a lot to clean up. That's my kind of recipe. Thanks Lori!

I am very picky about my pork and this turned out great! I used whole grain mustard seed (1 tbsp) and less mustard. I did not salt it- thanks goodness- b/c the soy sauce took care of it.

I cook Pork tenderloin A LOT over the years and was looking for something new today so I decided to try this recipe. I was so impressed i'm writing my first ever review after being on this site for years. It was AMAZING!!! By far the most moist and tender pork tenderloin i've EVER made. The flavor was perfect, but i can only imagine the longer you marinate it the better it will be. The only thing I did different was I took out the salt because soy sauce is salty enough as it is. I marinated it for about 1.5 hours in the fridge, took it out while preheating my oven to let the temperature come down a little, then cooked it for 60 minutes at 350.I had 2 tenderloins and they cooked perfectly! I was 100000% satisfied with this recipe and will cook it again and again.

Yikes, the soy sauce flavor was way too strong for me in this one, and I like soy sauce and have used it in other marinades. I followed the recipe as written, I marinated for about 6 hours. If I make this again I'll use a third of the soy sauce and not marinate for as long. Luckily I assumed I didn't need more salt so didn't add any, the soy takes care of that.

very good. I added less soy sauce and added about 1 tsp worchestershire sauce and 3 tbsp dijon mustard and tbsp honey. added tsp pepper and NO SALT! cook at 425 for 30-35 mins. Important to let pork and marinade to get to room temp...for even cooking.

I cooked this for my boyfriend and I last night and it was so easy and he absolutely loved it! He practically licked the plate.  You can definitely tweak this and use what you have (ie. I didn't have enough soy sauce so I used what I had and topped it with rice wine vinegar and added more salt).  I marinated the pork overnight too.  I poured the marinade over the pork (per the recipe) before putting it in the over but it got overcaramelized.  I think next time I'll add the marinate midway through the baking time, maybe 15 mins into it. I only had 2 pcs of tenderloin so it only took 30 mins to cook.

This was the first pork tenderloin that I've made. Surprisingly it was very flavorful and moist. My husband and son both LOVED it and can't wait for me to make it again!

This is my go-to recipe for pork tenderloin and has been for years.

I buy the pork tenderloin in club packs, make up the marinade in individual portions, then put each pork tenderloin in a separate ziploc bag and load all the bags in the freezer - we have had it 6 - 8 months later and it has always been delicious (take it out the night before to thaw).

DELICIOUS AND EASY.

Awesome flavor!  Even my picky husband loved it.  I did add some fresh sage and rosemary, just because I had some in the fridge, but it wasn't necessary and the marinade would be exellent without.  This recipe is great as is, or can be a great base to experiment with different flavors and seasonings.

I usually only rate a recipe if I have followed the original exactly the first time but I had a pork tenderloin that I needed to cook and I found this recipe.  I didn't have any honey mustard so I subbbed with a TBS. of brown sugar and coarse ground mustard.  Followed someone else advise and cooked at 400 for 15 min. and then lower temp and cooked 30 min.  Tented with foil and let rest for 10 min.  Turned out very moist but I thought it was a little salty.  Next time will use low-sodium soy sauce.  Much better the next day sliced thin and served on hoagie rolls with coleslaw.

Best pork tenderloin I've made- flavor and texture. Only thing I would do differently next time is not to pour the marinade over the pork. It just burnt in the pan and wasn't needed anyway.

Delish!  Very easy to make!  The pork turned out very moist and was a crowd favorite at this house!  I didn't have dijon honey mustard so used regular dijon mustard and regular honey.  I will definitely use this again.

I really enjoyed this, as did my husband and my son.  I used low-sodium soy sauce so I didn't have the saltiness other reviews were said to have.  My daughter on the other hand didn't like it, but then she doesn't like anything, so I wouldn't factor that into my review.  Will definitely make this again (and my daughter can have a peanut butter sandwich).  Excellent!

Very easy and very good.  Used a 2lb pork tenderloin and BBQ'd it.  Very moist and tender.  Marinated it for about 6 hours.

This was a very simple marinade. I used honey and dijon mustard (equal amounts of each) and was heavy handed with the garlic. I used teriaki sauce instead of soy sauce. My husband raved over this dish, Thanks!

There's a big difference between a tenderloin and a pork loin roast. This worked well with a 4lb. boneless pork tenderloin.

Made this for my family tonight and they loved it. I did mine in my slow cooker on low all day and right before I served it, I poured off the marinade/juices and thickened them with some cornstarch. Made the best sauce to spoon over the slices of pork. Will definitely make again!

I tried this recipe for Mother's Day dinner, although made it slightly different staying with all other steps. 

I used more garlic, and crushed it directly into the bag 4 medium cloves. What can I say, I'm Italian?! I used Bragg's Liquid Amino which is a soy alternative and helps cut down the salinity of the meal. Average lite soy sauce is about 700 mg/ tblsp. Braggs is 160 per 1/2 tsp so 320 per tblsp. I used Gulden's spicy brown mustard 2 tblsp, and 1 tblsp honey Kenny's Virgin Honey out of NM. I used no salt or pepper. I cooked them on the grill medium heat basting with the left over marinade about 20-30 minutes (just make sure to check temp or cut to check it's gray throughout).
My mother-in-law and wife gave the pork a 20 out of 10, and said it was the best pork I've made, and that they've tried to date. I've written the recipe down, and as most have said will keep in the rotation. Goes great with grilled mushrooms, zucchini,squash, and corn on the cob!

This tastes great - definitely didn't need the salt and to be honest next time I'm going to use half the recommended amount of soy.  I think each slice needs a little juice from the pan to get the desired flavor, but it was a little too salty.  Otherwise this recipe is amazing and my husband loves it.  I served with potatoes roasted with sea salt, pepper, garlic and rosemary and it paired perfectly.

Easy & delicious = winner!  I was worried about the soy sauce because I'm not a big fan, and the reviews only made that worse.  I just charged through it, and it came out great.  Seriously, this couldn't get much easier.  I mixed everything together thoroughly (minus salt) in the morning, put it in a zip-bag with the pork, and stuck it in the fridge for about 6 hours or so.  The sauce was kind of thick for me, so I didn't need to baste.  I also had no problems with over caramelizing.  Everything came together nicely.  Can't wait to try it on the grill to add smoke to the mix.

I didn't have honey dijon mustard so I just added honey to regular dijon mustard.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written except I marinated for about 6 hours.  The tenderloin tasted great and it was easy to make - a great recipe. I served it with baked potato and broccoli.

My spouse is extremely extremely extremely picky. I am hardly ever allowed to "step outside the box". I made this recipe as a whim trying something new.  I didn't have the time to grill like all the other recipes required. My spouse was not looking forward to this when they got home. Not only did my spouse eat dang near the whole tenderloin but they demanded I keep this in the routine. I use country Dijon grey pupon for the mustard and low sodium soy sauce.along with some other seasonings that don't have salt. I do not put any salt in this as the soy sauce does it's job.Also I throw all this in a zip lock bag and let everything marinate for at least 4 or 6 hours. This has turned out perfect every time.if you make this once you well definitely make it again! thanks so much for sharing

Excellent recipe if soy sauce is reduced a bit. We had a 1.5 lb roast that marinated for 24 hours then put it on the rotisserie for 55 minutes. Perfectly moist and browned. Heated up the marinade and used it as a sauce. Definitely a keeper!

Well, this was my first attempt. I'm not a great cook but am trying to learn .   I love AllRecipes.   I bought a pork loin roast instead of a pork tenderloin because that's what the recipe said, but I guess I should have gotten the tenderloin.   It took forever to cook but found that the marinade started to burn around the edges of the pan before the internal temp was reached. By the time it was done, or I think it's done lol, my house started to smell like I had done something terribly wrong.  lol  I almost want to try it over again before my husband gets home.  lol  I don't want him to know I screwed up again  lol  It was an easy recipe though....Smelled great before the smoke rolled in   LOL

Delicious!  I used light sodium soy, and just one tablespoon of olive oil.  Have tried this both in the oven and grilled, it's a great savory recipe.  I just don't care for that much oil in my recipes.  Have made this over and over, husband loves it too.  We've even made it for guests on the grill.  Very popular with everyone.

Thought it was pretty good.  I only had 2 T of honey Dijon mustard so I used regular Dijon for the last tablespoon. Let marinade all day.  My tenderloin was about 1 pound.  I don't know why, but mine never seem to cook as fast as other peoples.  At 45 minutes was still pink.

This was the best pork tenderloin ever.  I didn't have honey dijon, but used regular dijon and honey.  As some pork tenderloins tend to be tough, I added about 1/2 cup of dry white wine since this tenderizes the meat as it marinates.  I only had one tenderloin, but marinated it overnight then removed it from the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before cooking.  Baked about 25 minutes then let it rest for 5 minutes.  It was absolutely TERRIFIC!!!!  Great recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Didn't have the ingredients for my usual pork tenderloin marinade, so used this recipe tonight, it was really good!  Like others suggested, I halved the soy sauce and did not add any additional salt. I did not have honey dijon so as also suggested I used 2T dijon and 1T honey. I only had time to marinate it for an hour but it was still flavorful. My tenderloin was only 1 lb so I think I ended up cooking it for about 10 mins on 375 and 25 mins on 350.  Was so tender!

This turned out incredibly tender & very flavorful. I started with a fresh pork tenderloin from a local farm so I definitely had an advantage there. I used regular dijon but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Leftovers were great too and just as tender. Hands down the best pork tenderloin I've ever had. This will be a repeat at my house!

I made this exactly as directed except I used about 1/3 less soy sauce, since one review I read said it was overpowering and I believed it. Even with that modification the soy sauce was all I could really taste, and the meat came out a bit dry and chewy. Perhaps marinating longer would have helped; I was only able to do about 75 minutes. If I made this again I'd maybe only use one Tbsp of soy sauce, and marinate it longer. A little soy sauce goes a long way!

I made this for my family last night. It was so GOOD! I did two things differently. We really like a garlic. Instead of one clove I used five cloves. I added the marinade and a small can of beef broth after 15 mins. of cooking. The gravy that I made from the pan drippngs was tasty.

This was very good.  The soy sauce gave a very good flavor to the pork and kept it very juicy and tender.  My track record with tenderloins has not been very good.  They have always turned out too dry with very little flavor.  It was very easy to do, but you do need to marinate several hours.  I did mine 4 hours.  I'm sure this would also taste good on the grill.

Didn't have honey mustard so I used honey and dijon.  Marinated for  around 5 hours.  Used low sodium tamari instead of soy.  Used 2 tenderloins so I doubled the marinade.  Didn't add extra salt.  1 hr  @ 350 was PERFECT for the two tenderloins, total was about 5 lbs.

This recipe is super!  I especially like the fact that it uses common kitchen ingredients, so you don't have to buy a whole bottle of an item when you only need 2 tablespoons.   I followed other reviews and and omitted the salt. We had Dijon mustard and I added a small amount of honey. Marinated for a couple of hours, drizzle marinade in dish, 400 for 15 minutes, 350 for 30 minutes. Cover with foil for about 15. Delicious and great for guests!

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I used a 4 lb. boneless pork shoulder roast.  I poked several holes in the roast.I had ended up marinating for over 24 hours.  Full of flavor and very tender.

I had half of a pork loin & cut into bite size pieces.I made the marinade with Worcestershire sauce,as I had no soy sauce.I used 2 TBS Dijon & 1 TBS honey,as I had no Honey Dijon.Everything else I did as the recipe suggests.I added 1/2 an onion & put into the marinade too.I put in a baking dish with all of the marinade,(after marinading 2 hours),set at 375( I think my oven heats a little cool) for 50 minutes,as I wanted the marinade to sort of dry up & soak in the meat.The meat was still super tender & my husband approved!!Pretty good!

So easy and so good!! 

I always make a recipe exactly as described the first time (although I used low sodium soy sauce, and it was salty enough for our family). 

I put sliced onions in the bottom of the baking dish, put the pork on that and then covered it with the marinade (I only had time to marinate it for about 2 hours - longer would probably be better). The onions caramelized beautifully in the sauce.

I made dressing and put it on a platter, poured the onions/sauce over the dressing then put the sliced pork on top. I served this with a crunchy waldorf salad and mashed potatoes.

YUM!!

This marinate was so devious. Even hubs who says NOTHING about his meal said he liked the taste.

Moist and tender - I used honey-habanero mustard and will definitely make this again.

Loved it, family loved it.  It was extremely tender.  I made it as written, except that I didn’t have Dijon honey mustard, so I used 1 Tablespoon of honey, and close to two Tablespoons Dijon mustard.  Very good flavor.

This was a big hit at Christmas Eve dinner. I followed the tip of one reviewer to cook at 400 for 15 minutes and then 30 minutes at 350. It was perfect and very juicy. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, wow! This made the best pork loin I have ever had. I followed the directions almost exactly. It was a little salty for my taste so I added a tablespoon of honey. That was my only change. I couldn’t taste it at all in the finished product. I marinated for a little over two hours and cooked as directed and the pork loin was as moist and perfectly cooked as I have ever had it. The meat truly melted in our mouths. My husband couldn’t get enough of it. I will make it again and share it with friends.

It was incredible and it cooked in the marinade.  I have used it in the oven and in a crock pot.  Loved it both ways.  I am going to try it on chicken and ribs.

I left out the salt and used low sodium soy sauce. I also used a garlic pepper Grider as a plain pepper replacement and added a bit of garlic powder. It was delicious and the garlic was still subtle. I also grilled the pork instead of cooking it in the oven for grill flavor. The whole family asks for it every time I make pork.

Used double the amount of garlic as we LOVE garlic in our house!  Ended up grilling over indirect heat.  We normally don't like pork tenderloin, but this recipe made it taste AWESOME!

This was THE BEST! Sooo tender. Unbelievable!  As some of ?the others suggested, I left out salt due to ?the soy sauce in it and added maple syrup (about 3 tbsp. to match up with ?the mustard)and honey (1 tbsp). This marinade is so good as a sauce for some mashed potatoes as well!  It was fork tender and juicy!

I'm smelling it cook right now =) I have used this marinade often, its SO good! I use whole grain mustard (Hubby is a diabetic) instead and I up the garlic.  It is by far the best and easiest way to do pork. Oh and just a suggestion to the people who had problems with the salt - maybe try low sodium soy sauce :/

My tenderloin came out moist and delicious using this marinade. I did use low sodium soy sauce and left out the salt all together. (Even with low sodium soy sauce, there is more than enough salt in it to make adding more from the shaker unnecessary.) Scrumptious!
Oh, and for a slightly different taste, try using lite teriyaki sauce in place of the soy sauce - also very, very good!

Just okay.  Could have used a kick, maybe a tsp. balsamic vinegar.  I even added a tsp. each of chopped fresh rosemary,  thyme and minced ginger and marinated for one hour.  Needs at least three hours marinating.

We really enjoyed this.  I only used 1/8 cup of olive oil to cut down on the fat, and we did not miss it.  I did not salt the pork because I thought that would make it too salty.  My daughter thought it was still a little salty so I will use light soy sauce next time.  I marinated the pork for about 8 hours.  My husband said this was the best tenderloin I ever made!  Very easy also!

To me between the soy sauce and mustard, there are bound to be a high sodium content and I could not really taste much of anything else.  Not terrible but, perhaps if lower sodium soy sauce was used or less and add a little more olive oil.

So tender that you could cut it with your fork! Next time, I'll cut way back on the soy sauce. I marinated it for about 3 hours, and may cut back to 1-2 hours.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous and a family favorite!  I usually use a 3-4lb tenderloin so I will triple or quadruple the ingredients and increase to cooking time.  Also, I marinate overnight which enhances the flavors tremendously.

This was the best pork tenderloin I have ever made.  My husband even commented on it!  That is rare!  It was easy, quick and used ingredients I had on hand.  I marinated the tenderloin for about 3 hours.  Perhaps that was why it was so tender.  Served it with a strawberry spinach salad and rice.  Great meal!!  Will serve this to guests!

I have made this 3 times already and every time I love it! Now I had to make some modifications because my hubby doesn't like soy sauce so I  halved the soy sauce and did the other half Worchestershire sauce which he loves. I don't add the salt and pepper because the 2 sauces are salty enough but I do use more seasonings like season salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and Adobo. The first time I made it, I did it like that and the rest like the recipe, with some cut up onions when I went to cook it. The second time I doubled the amount of garlic and added a bit more of Soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, and I put the chopped up onions in the bag as it marinaded to see if it enhanced the flavor and it did a little bit. The third time I added more garlic, a little more of the 2 sauces, maybe 3/4ths full of a 1/4 cup each, and used dried minced onion because I didn't have a real onion. It still tastes delicious! Even my picky hubby loves it and he doesn't like soy sauce or mustard of any kind, the other flavors mask those taste because they all complement each other! The pork loin is always so tender too, it's amazing and easy! All 3 times I marinated it for over a day to increase the flavor, thank you so much for this recipe!

Excellent recipe!  My whole family loved it, even the 2 1/2 year old!  I first checked it at 50 minutes.  Next time I'll start checking at 45 minutes.  It was ever so slightly overdone to my taste after standing uncovered for 10 minutes.

I used some honey/garlic dijon type mustard (what I had on hand).  This gave the marinade a touch of sweetness it was delicious!

We liked it, easy to make, and had good flavor. I used a German mustard. 
My meat thermometer was set to 170 degrees Fahrenheit for pork so that's what I baked it to, still tender. If it is pink in the middle my wife gets squeamish. I did cook it once before to a little over 145 deg F, it was pink in the middle, but very tender. We're old, and remember when a few people got Trichinosis.

I didn’t have any honey Dijon on hand but did have some honey and pineapple mustard from a gourmet gift basket, and it worked really well with the other ingredients in the. If I can’t find something similar, I’ll be figuring out a crushed pineapple

I'm definitely going to make this again. The marinade was so simple and gave the pork a great flavor.  It also turned out very tender. I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt and I think those were good modifications.  Thank you for the recipe.

I did this tonight . In general I think it can be good but definitely need to cover the roast with aluminum foil ( I did not ) to preserve the liquid so the pork does not dry out. Also watch how long you cook it - 45 minutes plus sitting was enough for us

This was delicious! I used honey and dijon mustard since I didn't have honey dijon. I think 60 minutes was a bit long, although my pork was only about 1 lb. I notice whenever I cook pork tenderloin this way, it ends up a bit dry. Very tasty marinade though. Fresh garlic makes a huge difference here. Served this with herb and garlic mashed potatoes and butter and brown sugar acorn squash. Yum!!

I used a different  marinade but 45 minutes was MUCH too long. When I therm-ed the pork tenderloin it was over 180º. The pork ended up a little dried out. Probably will only do 20-25 minutes next time.

So easy to prepare and amazing flavor. Pork tenderloin can be tasteless, but this hit the spot, and the soy was not at all over powering. Thoroughly enjoyed!

I have made this countless times and my family loves it. Best tip -- this recipe is perfect as is for the slow cooker. No need to marinate for hours. In the slow cooker, you can even use frozen tenderloin for quick prep time before you head out the door. We double the marinade because my husband loves it over rice.

Love this, but changed the recipe after the first try.  Just a couple of dashes of soy, or teriyaki and since my family loves garlic, I increase from one close of garlic to six or seven.  I let it marinate over night.  Wonderful in the oven or on the grill!

Juicy but way too much salt. I made it just as written, but between the soy sauce and added salt, we couldn't eat it.  I MIGHT try it again with half the soy sauce and no added salt, but not for awhile. Just very off-putting flavor.

We liked this recipe very much. I didn't have Dijon honey mustard, so used regular Dijon + brown sugar(1:1)as other reviewers suggested. I had 1# pork tenderloin, so I cut the recipe in half.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and NO salt.  Also, I cut the tenderloin in thin slices, marinated them for about 2 1/2 hr, and stir fried them.  Easy and delicious.  Thanks, Lori!

I used equal parts of 'Ken's' Honey Mustard Dressing & 'Grey Poupon' Country Dijon Mustard in place of the dijon honey mustard. And I also used very small amounts of salt & pepper. After preparing the marinade & sealing the pork tenderloin in a baggie, I refrigerated it for 15 hours. While it baked uncovered until it reached 150 degrees, I opened the oven every 15 minutes & brushed on the marinade that was in the bottom of the porcelain lined cast iron dutch oven. The pork was quite moist & very yummy served with long grain rice & chilled canned asparagus spears!

I only had a pork loin, not a tenderloin. I let it marinate for 4 hours then instead of cooking it in the oven I threw it in my slow cooker for 5 1/2 hours on low. The flavors were good but I definitely think it would be even better with the intended cut of meat but the crockpot idea kept my house from getting too hot on this warm day!

We loved this recipe. I omitted the salt and didn't miss it at all. I didn't have honey dijon so mixed a small amount of honey into the regular dijon. The marinade did burn off half way through cooking so I mixed up a small amount again to pour over. Very moist. Will add more garlic next time I do this.

It was great!  I did what others suggested and used regular Dijon but substituted a tbsp of honey for one of the mustard  and doubled the recipe for four pounds of pork tenderloin.  Then marinated in refrigerator about five hours, then two on the counter. Cooked as suggested, but added parboiled sweet potatoes and carrots for the last 20 minutes, covering with the marinade. After removing the meat, added a little water and several tbsps of cornstarch to make a sauce of the remaining marinade. Everyone loved the meal, seconds all around.  The vegetables were wonderful with the sauce!  Meat tender and juicy!

Came out great.  I did listen to the other reviewers and did not add extra salt.  The soy sauce adds more than enough.

We enjoyed this. It was simple to put together and was moist and flavorful. I will say it was quite salty, and I wish it would have been sweeter. I think I will decrease the amount of soy sauce and add some brown sugar next time.

This recipe was as easy as the instructions say!!!  The flavor was amazing and it was so moist!  I left out the salt, as other reviewers suggested.  I also used garlic powder instead of real garlic cloves.  (I didn't have any)  I was afraid I was going to have too much meat but our guests kept going back for 3rds and 4ths!!!  My family has asked for it to be on our regular menu!

I really like this recipe but did make one adjustment - added 1/4 cup brown sugar. It takes away from the saltiness of the soy sauce. Gives it a little more of a sweet and salty flavor. A hit to both family and friends!

This is the only way I cook pork tenderloins now.  Husband and kids absolutely raved about this version.  I followed recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I always marinade for at least a couple of hours and pour the remaining sauce over the pork to cook.  It works well hot for a family dinner and any leftovers are fantastic in sandwiches - meat stays so moist for days! .... my teenage son requests this often just so that he can take pork sandwiches for his packed lunch.  Great recipe.

I followed the directions and while this recipe smelled divine while baking, it didn't taste as good as it smelled. I think to bring out that wonderful flavor it needs to be marinated overnight.

I adore this recipe.  I throw all the ingredients together (without any extra salt and I use low sodium soy sauce) in a bag and let it marinate all day long.  Once I forgot about it and left it in the marinade for 3 days and even then it turned out fabulous.  I cook it as directed but always check the internal temp.  Sometimes I turn on the broiler and let the marinade really carmalize during the last few minutes of the cooking time.  I haven't grilled it yet but I bet it is good that way too.  It is so tender and juicy and the flavors are amazing.  I pair this with oven roasted potatoes and veggies.  It is always a easy meal that my entire family will eat.

Made this for supper tonight, the pork tenderloin was marinading in the frig for 9.5 hours.  Although I did find this to be slighty salty,not unplesantly so, I  will make again as my husband and son also liked this recipe.  Baked it at 325 in a convection oven for 70 minute in a covered french white  casserole  dish. Next time I will uncover for the 20-30 minutes to bake the sauce on the meat better. I did omit the salt and I used reduced sodium soy  sauce (33% less)  I also did not have honey dijon mustard so I used 2 tbsp dijon mustard and 1 tbsp honey as other reviewers suggested.  I served it with baked mini potatoes and baked carrots.  Everything in the oven so a very easy dinner to prepare and cook.

Wow and wow! This marinade is amazing. Used a probe, set it to 145, and the roast was as juicy and succulent as the meat you get from a fine restaurant. Without question I will be making this recipe often. My family loved it. Made it exactly as written.

Big hit with the kids and the in-laws!!! My 5 year old son had 3 helpings! Really salty, so don't add any. I didn't have any honey Dijon, so I just used regular Dijon and added a tbsp of honey.   - Christie W.

We cook for struggling families each week; about 70 guests. I liked the looks of this recipe. We stuck to the original recipe however, we used to full pork loins cut into thirds, marinated overnight. It was a big hit! We'll do this one again. I'd like to add a sauce to it. Any ideas?

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was delicious.  I was expecting more of a dijon flavor , but no!
It was wonderful.  I used a 1.5 lb Homel Pork Roast so following the recipe I discovered that I under cooked it by about 30 minutes. I added little red potatoes to the roasting pan too.  Otherwise this is a keeper. My husband and son loved it!!

I tried this recipe. I cooked 2 lbs. of pork tenderloin (cut in half) 1hr and 50 mins. 45 to 60 mins was not long enough.The marinade sauce I used was similar. I wisked the following ingredients for the marinade: 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 2 cloves of garlic minced, 4 Tbl. French's mustard, 2 Tbl. of honey, 4 tsp. of maple syrup and pepper to taste.  I marinated the pork loin for 6 hours in the refrigerator. Also, I added sliced carrots, sliced potato and poured the marinade over the meat, carrots and potato.
Everyone who ate this loved the taste.

I have a couple of pork tenderloin recipes that I like to use but this was one was really good. I didn't have the dijon honey mustard so used dijon mustard (2TBS) and Honey (! TBS) like another reader. I used low sodium soy sauce and did NOT add the additional salt and it was plenty salty enough.  It is even better the second day. I sliced it thin and put it back in the juices in the pan and it was awesome.

I put my pork loin in the marinade around 9 am, and cooked it around 6:30.  It was perfect!  Everyone went nuts over how good it was, and I felt like it was some of the best I had made.  Even my mostly-vegetarian 8 year old gobbled it up and wanted more!  I will go back to this marinade recipe time and time again.

Easy and delicious. Pork was tender and the leftovers - if there are any - make great sandwiches the next day.

This was excellent.  Nice strong flavor without being overpowering.  Only had to increase the cook time a little to get the nice browned outside of the meat.

Made this last night. Absolutely wonderful! Didn't have any dijon mustard so used the 1T honey and 2T regular mustard as suggested by another member and it was still great. Also omitted the salt the soy took care of my salt tooth.

If you want a little different twist on this add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and some red food coloring. This gives it a different appearance and takes the bite out of the soy sauce. (I also omit the salt as the soy sauce is salty on it's own and I don't use pepper!)

Very tender.  There was just something that needed tweaking and I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe cut some of the soy sauce(I used low sodium tamari) and add something sweet-maple syrup? I also added rosemary.  Will tamper with next time.

My husband and I love this recipe! We didnt have honey mustard the first time we made it, so we used honey and regular mustard. I think its better that way personally.

First time ever grilling a pork loin. It turned out yummy and tender with lots of flavor!! I marinated the loin overnight turning once or twice. Cook on medium heat on all four sides about 5 minutes on each to sear the outside. Turned down the heat and let it cook on low for another 20 mins or so until center no longer pink. We loved this! Try it you won't regret! :)

Loved this! It's simple, easy and delicious! We grilled ours on the top shelf of the grill. Best tip for grilling a pork loin is get a meat thermometer!  Takes out the guessing if it's done and it won't be raw or overdone and dry.

If you're  watching calories this is a delicious low calorie meat that satisfies the tummy. I also cut down on the soy sauce and didn't add salt.

This was a tasty recipe, my family and I thought that this was far too salty because of how much soy sauce we had to place into it. But either than that a great recipe and next time I shalt put less soy sauce :)

I like the touch of dijon. The salt, on the other hand, is way too much.  I wish I would have paid better attention to that when preparing.  Otherwise this was a very easy and delicious recipe.  Thanks.

I understand how people can find this too salty, but we're salt fans and DH and I loved this! I roasted some potatos in with it and made a salad for a nice Sunday dinner. There was a lot left as there's only two of us so I think I'll have sandwiches for the rest of the week. No complaints.

This was a hit! I had 2.5 lb of pork tenderloin so I doubled the marinade and let meat marinate for about 3 hrs. before roasting. One hour was perfect for the meat to reach 160 degrees. I made gravy with the drippings - delicious! After slicing the 2 tenderloins, I poured the gravy over the slices and served them with roasted vegetables and roasted potatoes. My family loved this meal, and it was so easy! (I too thought it was a bit too salty, but no one else commented. I will use low sodium soy sauce next time.)

The taste was great, but I did have to cook it about 90 minutes to reach the internal temp and it was a little tougher than I wished. We'll make it again, but hopefully I can figure out how to make it more tender.

Ours ended up a little on the salty side, but we also basted the sauce on the meat while we cooked it! Overall, very tasty!

I would not change a thing. Made this for company, boneless pork tenderloin. You can mariate it longer.  I also closed the mariated meat and some liquid into a foil pocket sealed around the edges. then cooked on the grill for about 30 minutes. Then finished it off directly on the grill, also browning it. Make sure its done with a meat thermometer. I am always concerned that meat is cooked properly, this worked out perfectly.

This marinade was too good! After marinading pork for about 5 hrs. i proceeded to take out and grill 2 tenderloins. Each tenderloin fell apart into 7 pieces! lol I still cooked it and EVERYONE loved it. Will make it our weekly meat on menu! Thank you

Very easy and tasty!  We used the reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still a little salty, but very very good...it's a keeper!

First I seared the pork for 2 mins per side in a blistering hot cast iron skillet with a little bacon grease, then finished like the recipe in a covered baking dish.  Turned out super moist and tasty!

This makes for a very flavorable tenderloin.  I followed the advice of another post and reduced the soy sauce to half of the 1/4 cup and it turned out just fine. I also did not have honey mustard, so I added about a tablespoon of honey. This recipe is a winner!

This marinade was good! I didn't have dijon honey mustard, but used plain honey as well as a stoneground mustard with horseradish. It was perfectly cooked. Although we liked this a lot, i am still iso the perfect pork marinade.

It was really good. I used low sodium soy sauce and didn’t add any other salt. Marinated for 5 hours.  Not too salty and just enough flavor. I’ll be making again.

Delicious and so easy! I marinated the pork for about 3 hours and cooked it for 60 min, turning the oven off for the last 15 min. My pork roast was possibly smaller though. Just a hint of pink and so tender! Don't overcook!!! We used the marinade as a gravy for the potatoes and pork. Note: I had to add 1/4 cup of water to the marinade around the pork as it was thinning too quickly and would have burned.

Used 1/3 of the suggested soy sauce (lite). Didn't have dijon honey mustard substituted honey and a chardonnay dijon mustard. After 2/3rds of the cooking time, there was no moisture in the pan and I was concerned about burning. Decided to add a splash of marsala wine and sauteed mushrooms then cover with foil. 
Did not use any salt - didn't need it with the soy sauce.

This was easy and the meat turned out juicy.  I ended up marinating it overnight, which I think was too much.  The flavor was too strong and too mustardy, just very odd.  I have another marinade I’ve used for grilled pork tenderloin and I think I’ll just use it for the roasted version as well.

I HATE pork but I could eat this all day long!! Soooo good! (I am a fan of strong seasoning/flavor) I spoon the sauce over the slices and YUM! I really like the texture of the meat and I normally despise pork. I love how easy it it is to make as well.

I used a mix of dijon mustard and horseradish mustard, and two or three times as much garlic (as is my tradition). I was concerned about the soy sauce overpowering so behind the savory conditions I also added a few tablespoons of honey to balance out the salty soy sauce. Marinated overnight and served with rice. Really excellent.

Excellent and easy!! The whole family loved how tender the pork was and the subtle seasoning made the taste of the pork shine through. I didn’t have honey Dijon mustard on hand so I used 1.5 Tbls honey mustard dressing and 1.5 tbls spicy brown mustard.

Really is amazing!  The only negative was no leftovers.  After reading a few suggestions, didn’t have honey so added a few spoons of brown sugar and one extra clove of garlic..  Sprinkled some red pepper flakes on top before went in oven because didn’t think to mix in the marinade.  I am from the south we like some extra spice.  Not many changes.... this will be a rotating go to recipe for sure!

As others advised I decreased the soy by 1 T and did not add salt nor did I add the full marinade during cook time (there was plenty of liquid for cooking without it).  The tenderloin itself was very  tender  and I consider it perfectly cooked.  However, the marinade itself  didn't taste good to me,  it just wasn't what I was looking for but only by trying it could I say that. I will gladly use the cooking method ie., marinade (overnight)  baked it at 400 for 1st 20 min then finish 15-20 min on 350. It couldn't have been easier to prepare and I'm happy I found the recipe just won't be making this sauce .

I used tamari instead of soy sauce because of friend with gluten intolerance. I also used stoneground grey poupon because that was what I had on hand.
It was the best pork marinade I have ever made!

This was a tasty marinade and gave the tenderloin great flavor. But I make one recommendation, do not pour the marinade over meat in baking dish. I marinated several hours in fridge and followed recipe. Unfortunately the marinade burnt onto my pyrex baking dish into a black charred cement. It took 2 days of soaking and scrubbing to get it off. But thank goodness the meat was not affected!

I, too, found the soy sauce a bit too salty.  It's a keeper but think next time I will cut back on the soy sauce and maybe add some brown sugar.

Used this for tenderloin kabobs today, great flavor! Doubled the recipe for maximum coverage and cut into large 2" pieces since tenderloin shouldn't be over cooked... and fresh veggies need time to char well on grill.
 Picky H gave a double thumbs up!

This recipe was a huge hit with my family!  I made the marinade exactly as written, but cooked the tenderloin in a 400 degree oven until it was 145 degrees.  The meat had a wonderful flavor, and was very moist!  I've made it a couple of times, and it's always perfect.

This was easy and really good! I didn't have Dijon honey mustard, so I substituted regular Dijon, 2 tbsp & honey 1 tbsp. Worked perfectly!

Very tasty, I added about 3 tblsp of vinegar and did not get very tender results. Not bad, but maybe will marinate longer next time.

Added 2 tbsp organic raw sugar. And I will make it many times! My husband recently realized he is gluten intolerant, so we can't buy pre-marinated meat anymore. This recipe saved our lovely plain tenderloin from my guesswork! Thank you.

The one change I made was to use balsamic vinegar in place of the soy sauce. I then also used some of the marinate to roast with the vegetables that cooked during the same time. Having a temperature guide assured that the port was flavorful, tender and still moist

Loved it! Last week's pork loin (different recipe) had nothing over this moist and flavorful recipe.   A few changes that other's might have mentioned: no salt, doubled soy sauce, added at least 2 Tbsp maple syrup, and about 2 Tbsp fresh chopped rosemary.  
Served with the cooked marinade/juices on the side along with roasted asparagus, roasted butternut squash with spinach and craisins, corn, and applesauce. Beautiful feast! Thanks for sharing!

This is my new favorite Pork Marinade.  Very tasty. I used sodium reduced soya sauce and had no issue with salt. Marinated 16 hours. Sooo good.

I didn't have honey mustard so I substituted Dijon mustard and a teaspoon of honey.  Wrapped in foil and baked 55 m inutes.  So moist and flavorful and the remaining juice made wonderful gravy.  This recipe is simple and elegant and will be made often!

I will surely make this again! I followed the recipe for the pork loin  roast itself, then an hour before it was finished, I added chopped, (not big chunks), celery, carrots, onion and canned mushrooms.  The house smelled so good!! I served with small red baked potatoes.  Yumm! This is a keeper!

This was quite good.  I used teriyaki and dijon mustard because that's what I had on hand, and it gave the pork a great taste and it was very moist. Big problem was cleaning the pan afterwards.  I will use this marinade again though but drain it off before cooking .

I red some of the reviews, and decided to leave out the salt and add a tbl spoon of honey! It was great my family absolutely loved it. For anyone who has picky eaters in your family you might want to leave out the soy sauce, or use something else in it's place. My oldest son (who is 10) didn't like the taste of It! Everyone else loved It! We also added carrots and, potatoes. They where amazing! Yum! Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was the very best ever pork tenderloin I've ever made!  It's a true keeper and easy, breezy.  The meat was so tender it melted in your mouth.  The only change I made was I added a little more garlic.  Also, instead of whisking the ingredients in a bowl, I just put them all in a gallon storage baggie, squished until totally mixed, put the tenderloins in, made sure the meat was totally covered, and put in the fridge about 2 1/2 hours.  I baked for the entire 60 minutes because my tenderloin was about 2.3 lbs.  Absolute perfection!!

I made this recipe exactly as instructed-- though I did add a dash or two of worcestershire sauce.  It was the most delicious pork I've ever had.  I only marinated it for an hour and cooked it in the oven for 55 minutes.  It was so tender and juicy and full of flavor!  I will definitely make this again.

This is a great flavor, and it's so easy. I marinated for 24 hours and had no regrets. I also used stone ground mustard.

A couple bites at the ends were really salty. I used soy sauce but no additional salt.  I marinated a little over an hour. I didn't have honey dijon mustard so I used dijon and honey separately. Overall, it was tasty and moist. My husband liked it and said so, which is a big deal. I would probably do this again, maybe reducing the soy sauce or using low sodium.

My husband liked this--the meat had great flavor and was very moist.  I did not have honey mustard on hand.  So, I added both honey and mustard to the marinade.  I let it marinade for at lest two hours.  We will definitely eat this again!

Let me just say, this was AMAZINGGG. I was worried about adding mustard but you legit do not taste the mustard, at all! I diced up garlic and onions, placed that in the bag. I added garlic seasoning, Himalaya pink salt, pepper and Italian seasonings! Put soy sauce and 2 tablespoons is worsersire sauce! Let it marinade for about an hour to hour and half. Baked until it reached 63 Degrees’s Celsius!!

Super easy to make, and family approved!
When I made it I made a few changes and it came out great! First I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt, second I substituted the  honey mustard with stone mustard (it gives it a bit of a tangy hit ), and third I used agave nectar instead of the honey  (quite liberally).  I also  sear the outside  of the loin before I put it to cook in the oven (I do this either on a large frying pan with a drop of canola oil, or on the grill if you don't  want to stink up the house.  Either work great and it gives  the loin a bit of texture).

After marinating I seared the tenderloin in a pan with a little oil and a couple of tablespoons of crushed pepper corns until it was lightly browned.  Made a Roux from the pan drippings, adding the oven drippings and 1/2 cup of chicken stock, tbsp of parsley, and a pinch of thyme and thickening to make a great gravy.  Outstanding results with a tangy taste.

I don't love pork tenderloin, but had some so I gave this recipe a try. We LOVED it! I did leave out the salt as others suggested and I also used 2 Tbs Dijon mustard and 1 Tbs honey since I didn't have honey mustard. I will be buying more pork tenderloin now. Thank you!

Cut back on soy sauce as other recommended and added a little honey drizzle. Overall the tenderness  of the pork was perfect. We just thought the taste of the marinate was OK. Not great but not bad. I did appreciate the ease of the recipe.

It’s easy and delicious.  I prepared it following the recipe, but feeling lazy dumped it into the crockpot on high for five hours instead of baking.   I doubled recipe for 4 pound pork tenderloin.  After cooking I simply shredded it with a fork.  My teenagers approved!  I’ll leave out the added salt next time.

I made a honey sesame variation.  soy sauce, honey (equal parts), toasted sesame seeds, dash sesame oil, orange zest/juice (not too much).  Best if marinated before cooking. I cooked in stoneware covered for 30 min, uncover last 15 minutes to brown a bit. Serve with pan juices. Delicious!

Nice flavor.  I ended up marinating it longer than 24 hours as one other reviewer did (she forgot)--I didn't.  Just wanted to try it.  I also did as one other reviewer did and made it into a sandwich by placing it on a bun and broiling provolone and adding a touch of BBQ sauce--YUM!!!

I love this recipe. I didn’t add salt. There is enough saltiness with the soy sauce.  I baked my tenderloins for 40 minutes. They were slightly pink on the inside and so good. It is easy to overcook pork.

I prefer pork tenderloin on the grill but decided to try this recipe since I had a piece in the freezer and all the ingredients for the marinade.  I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt.  The pork took the full 60 minutes to cook thoroughly and came out moister than I expected.  The mustard flavor came through nicely.  I will make this again.

Made it with regular dijon mustard (not honey) and skipped the salt/pepper.  Threw in some cut up potatoes and had a great meal.  Super moist.  Only gave it 4 stars b/c I tweaked the original recipe.  With those tweaks, was def 5 stars & will make it again.

I loved this one!  I threw it together before work one morning and made it when I got home.  It was delicious!  I was hesitant about cooking the marinade with it, but it made a delicious sauce to spoon over!

Pork tenderloin is my favorite meat and this marinade is the best I have ever used! After marinating for a couple of hours I put the tenderloins on the grill for about 20 minutes. It was perfect, moist, and fork tender. My husband made sliders out of the leftovers the next day. Delicious!  Will make this again...often!

My fiance loved it and so did my kids. I had to twerk it a bit since I didn't have honey dijon just regular so I added a bit of real honey. I also didn't add salt because it wasn't needed. Other than that the only thing I did differently was added rosemary and thyme on top of the tenderloin while it cooked. Big hit in my home. Will definitely be doing this again

This can also be made in a Insta Pot.  Twenty minutes and then quick release.  Strain the sauce and thicken it with corn startch and water.

SOOOO easy! Already had the ingredients but used teriyaki sauce in place of soy sauce. Marinated for 2 hrs and it was perfect! Tasty and tender. Inserted meat thermometer to make sure it was cooked thoroughly but not overdone. Used the pans dripping to sprinkle over medallions after slicing the tenderloins. Served with fried brussel sprouts (used a recipe I found on Allrecipes :0). Hubby loved it all. Thanks!! (I will  marinate it longer next time for even more flavor).

I'm about to make this for the third time because my husband and I cannot get enough of it! I love that this recipe uses ingredients that I almost always have, so all I need to buy is the pork. Delicious and one of our favorites!

Amazing flavour and it was so easy! I mixed the marinade directly in a big ziploc bag. Instead of 3 Tbsp of honey mustard, I used 1.5 Tbsp Dijon mustard and 1.5 Tbsp of maple syrup. I also left out the salt and pepper. This was a definite do-again. I plan to make this again for company sometime! We also made a gravy/sauce out of the drippings by whisking in pancake mix (we are out of flour! Lol) and and bit of water. It made the meal!! So good!!! Note: in Canada, it is recommended to cook pork to 160 so we did and it did not taste overcooked.

I will def make this again! I did what some recommended as I did not have honey dijon. I used regular dijon mustard & added 2 tbls honey & eliminated the salt. Let marinade overnight & cooked on the grill for 40 min. Wow, juicy & delicious! Had left overs the next day as a sandwich on baguette w/provolone. Yum!

This has to be one of the best pork tenderloin recipes I've ever made. I would have said it is the best until I tried the pork tenderloin and apple recipe from the site. It's a tossup of which one is better. I made thisdish exactly as written. The roast came out melt-in-your-mouth tender. I wish I hadn't  pushed off the marinade before cooking. I would've loved to have more of the marinade; it was scrumptious

I followed some hints from one of the reviewers, cooking it for the first 15 minutes at 400 and then lowering it to 350 for a half hour, then letting it rest under a loose foil cover for about 10 minutes. The pork came out looking appetizing (browned and caramelized) and was tasty, tender, and moist. I'm not sure why it didn't wow me enough to give it 5 stars--maybe just personal flavor preferences. I'll experiment next time. Good recipe, though.

Wow this was an easy but very nice marinade for the pork tenderloin. Like other reviewers mentioned I didn't have honey dijon so i used 2 tablespoons dijon mustard and 1 1/2 tablespoons honey and I used braggs liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce. I ended up cooking the tenderloin for an additional 15 minutes tented with tinfoil which made a nice sauce that we put over rice and I used later with the leftover pork to make an awesome fried rice.

Best marinade I've ever done on pork. Don't need added salt as the soy is all the salt it needs.
I pan-fried in cast iron, 5 minutes per side, then low heat and loose foil for 11 minutes until temp was 145 F. Rested for 5 min and sliced.  Best pork  ever.

I used two 1lb tenderloins and followed marinade recipe. I ended up not making it that night so it marinated a full 24 hours before cooking it. Turned out tender, moist and full of flavor. It was so easy to throw together. I love that it can marinate for an hour or a day and still tastes great! This is a definite go to recipe, thank you!

Used low sodium soy sauce and no salt, used with sirloin chops . Put on grill, wonderful.  Helps to keep chops moist. Very good. Best chops every time.

This was the best pork tenderloin I have ever made! Easy prep marinade and quick! The only things I changed was using garlic powder in place of minced and 2 tbs of whole grain country style mustard and 1 tbs of honey only because I did not have honey dijon mustard.  My family loved it and pork tenderloin is not generally a fave but it is now!

I added a little fresh ginger and a little more garlic.  I cooked at 300 F until 140 and covered for 30 mins.  Cold use a fork to cut it and everyone asked me for the recipe.  Ha Ha.

We loved this! I ran out of dijon mustard so I used whole seed mustard condiment, which created a weird texture, but a wonderful taste. We'll definitely make this again. So simple!

Very flavorful.  Omitted salt and used 3 Tbls. of honey mustard and about a teaspoon of spicy brown mustard.  Marinated overnight in ziploc bag.  Baked 35 min. in a 9x13 glass dish (had two 1lb. tenderloins).  Moist and juicy.  This is not a sweet marinade,  yet very flavorful.

I followed the recipe but also followed some of the other suggestions.  I did not add salt, and I added the maple syrup to the marinade, not  while it was cooking. I would make it again.

I have never had any luck with pork tenderloin until now. This was awesome.Everyone loved it.Been using all recipes.com for years and this is my first review, that's how much I liked it. Do not over cook, and use marinade to serve and pour over pork on plate. Double marinade would be great.  Bev H.Thanks for a great recipe.

We thought this was very good. I followed the recipe exact but doubled it due to over four pounds of tenderloin. I did leave it in the marinade over night with no problems. We love a strong soy flavor and I did not salt the meat. I would use this recipe again. If you don't like strong flavor then marinade a shorter amount of time.

Really simple recipe. Didn't come out as tender as I'd have liked, but likely my own fault. Came out tasty on its own. But the real treat, funnily enough, was making sandwiches with the leftovers. Will definitely try this again soon!

I didn't have honey Dijon mustard so I used 2 tbsp of honey and 1 tbsp of regular Dijon mustard and I didn't add salt since the soy sauce has enough in it already.  I also marinated it for 22 hours.  It was delicious, very moist and tender :-)

Deeelish! And easy! Because of previous reviews, I left out the salt and used low-sodium soy sauce. I didn't have honey mustard, so I just used dijon. I will definitely make again. Maybe I will experiment with a little less soy sauce. I will also try it with honey next time. Maybe a little dry white wine?

This is delicious!  Per other reviews, I decreased the soy sauce just a bit, but followed the rest of the directions.  Very very fine taste, and super moist!  I make pork tenderloins all the time.  This was probably one of the most moist results!  Thank you!

I made 2 tenderloins and instead of mincing the garlic, I cut 6 slots in the top of each and put a slice of garlic in each slot.  There was not one tiny bit left when we were done!  Thanks for this amazing recipe!

I used Dijon mustard and brown sugar instead.  Also I added two tbsp of red wine vinegar and a tbsp of Cayenne pepper. I did half soy sauce and half teriyaki sauce. It tasted great. I tweaked it a little bit.

Add me to the legion of fans. Made for family party, quadrupled the recipe and everyone loved it. No extra salt, uses a blend of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and Teriyaki sauce based on what I had available. Overnight  marinating and then added some thin sliced potatoes, carrots and turnips for baking. Spectacular. Leftovers were in demand as take home and there was not much to take home.

I found it's little salty so I use low sodium soy sauce and don't add much if any salt.

I've made this recipe twice and will make it again! It makes the most tender and moist pork loin.  I didn't have Dijon mustard on hand so I substituted stone-ground mustard and it was still good!!!  Bonus is that my husband loved it, too!

I mixed all ingredients in the plastic bag this morn to save time/cleaning and subbed  Dijon mustard & honey for honey mustard, garlic powder for fresh and completely overlooked/left out the Olive oil.   I marinated all day, cooked as directed and used pan drippings to drizzle over sliced tenderloin.  Superrr easy and delicious - thanks for recipe!

The recipe would be excellent followed exactly, I just didn't have all the ingredients. I loved it with my  adaptations, too.

This was a really good marinade. I didn't have dijon honey mustard, so used 3 tablespoons of sweet hot Inglehoffer mustard I had in the fridge. I read some of the reviews and used 1/8 cup worcestershire and 1/8 cup soy sauce, because some said there was too much of a soy flavor. It would have been fine either way. I also added 3 teaspoons of brown sugar when I tasted the marinade because I tend toward sweet and savory tastes.

The cooking time was spot on and the marinade was very adaptable to what I had in the house.

One of my favorite and most shared recipes with friends. It is so easy and delicious. I add chopped carrots, onions, apples and whatever other root vegetables I have on hand and let it all cook together in the pan with the pork. Great with mashed potatoes.

This is my go to recipe for marinating pork tenderloin.  I freeze the pork in marinade ahead of time....makes it extra jtender.  I also add worchester sauce and onion powder.  I use honey and yellow mustard instead of the dijon mustard.  It's always a hit!

I made this last evening after having marinaded it overnight.  I made no changes to the ingredients but I made the mistake of overcooking it to 170 degrees although it was still moist.  I had a 2-lb. pork loin and the loin did very well but the marinade on the bottom of the pan burned.  My husband really liked the flavor of the marinade but I was not as fond of it.  I would probably not make it again unless my husband requests it.  I would prefer something a bit more tangy.  Very easy recipe to follow, though.

Great taste and so easy to make. I added a little dollop of honey, marinated for a couple of hours and then cooked it on the grill for about 20minutes.  Everyone loved it!

My whole family loved this. The only thing I changed was I browned my tenderloin in a skillet added water and beefy onion soup mix and leftover marinade to droppings and poured it over the tenderloin before baking it. Cooking it again today.

This is a simple recipe. I don't have low sodium soy sauce so I omitted the salt. No honey mustard in my home; the stone ground version works well. The flavor is good, and sliced thin, the pork with a little marinade on top makes delicious sandwiches.

I made this interchanging  pork loin or tenderloin whatever I have available and using 1 Tbs of each Dijon mustard, honey mustard, and whole grain mustard. I left out the salt and added some rosemary. My daughter just started eating pork and requests this recipe!

I've made this one over and over again since I found it!  Tastes amazing when you bbq it!  I follow the recipe but use 1 tbsp dijon mustard and 2 tbsp honey mustard instead and always use Tamari soy sauce.  I also use Herbamare instead of salt.  Delicious!

I've made this exactly as written and with many substitutes. It has been wonderful every time. My substitutes have been instead of soy sauce I've used tamari or liquid aminos. Instead of dijon honey mustard I've used 3T mustard (all types) and 2T honey. I've upped the garlic too. I love this marinade for chicken too - on the grill - yummy!

This turned out delicious! It was a very simple recipe, most ingredients that are usually already on hand. The flavor was great- I thought it might be overly salty with the amount of soy sauce, but it was actually very good as is! If you don't have honey Dijon mustard, just add a 1/2 tbsp of honey & it works just as well. The bake time was spot-on... Came out perfect with the right amount of moisture but tender enough to cut with a fork. Thanks for sharing! This is a great quick & easy weeknight dinner recipe.

I found these really cheap cuts of pork lion at the store - a dollar a piece - and decided to experiment. 

I didn't have the olive oil - subbed with vegtable. Likewise I just had normal honey mustard and pre-minced garlic.  I found the soy sauce really overpowered it so I added more mustard to balance it out. I cooked for 35 minutes, but this was a little to much for my small cuts, next time I'd probably do 25-30. 

Served it on a bed of rice and it came out tasting great. Would make again.

This was very good. My son called it "the best pork ever," so there you go. The only thing I did differently is brine it before marinating, but that was just for fun.

This was excellent. 

Didn't have honey Dijon mustard, so used equal parts Dijon and honey. Used reduced sodium soy sauce and omitted additional salt.

Marinated a single tenderloin for 2 hours, then roasted @ 400 degrees to internal temperature of 140 degrees (~30 minutes). Let it rest while finishing the sides. 

Without a doubt the best pork tenderloin that we've ever had.

Today, my family and I had the best pork tenderloin ever... thanks to this marinade recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't add any salt and pepper. Next time, I will add a small amount of salt. I used both tenderloins, put them in a plastic bag with the marinade, left in the fridge for about three hours and rotated whenever I thought to. I put them on a preheated, hot grill and turned them often. I used a meat thermometer, and removed them from the grill when it read 140 degrees as recommended. The pork was slightly pink right in the middle, and deliciously moist, tender and flavorful! I will try this marinade with other meats, as well.

Made this today and after reading Kippyj's, I did not add salt. However I did not add maple syrup as my husband is diabetic. We loved it and I will definitely use this marinade again.

Excellent tenderloin.  I used low sodium soy sce. , added a tsp. of worcestershire sauce to the marinade and marinated for about 6 hours. I browned the meat on all sides in veg.  oil then cooked at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes (till it reached 145 degrees)...delicious!

I made this exactly as written. While it smelled wonderfully while it marinated and cooked the taste was just okay. I'm a little disappointed. It tasted a little better after it cooled but I won't be making this again.

Great recipe!  I substituted the honey mustard for a garlic aoli mustard and used an asian stir fry mix instead of soy sauce.  Came out excellent!

Received lots of compliments. The only thing I altered was that  I added was a little olive juice and did not add salt.

A group of thirty people praised this recipe! I took the advise of others and didn't add additional salt with the soy sauce.I only had honey mustard, not Dijon. It was wonderful. Great recipe.

This marinade came out so tasty and the meat was very tender. I marinated the meat for 2 1/2 hours instead of 1 hour and cooked it for 1 hour. I also left out the salt and pepper. Came out perfect!

Delicous!  Just tweaked it a bit because of what I had on hand.  I used around 1/4 of sweet and spicy mustard and then added 1/4 cup of honey to add more sweetness.  And a little garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Next time I will bake in a disposable foil pan because it really made a mess of my stone baking dish.  Wonderful flavor!  Highly recommend!

Absolute perfection every time, exactly as directed! I also use this marinade on chicken thighs sometimes, to save money (use less oil with the chicken; it gets greasy). Toss some veggies into the pan with the meat and you've got your side dish as well!

I did not have dijon mustard in the house at the time so I used approx 3 tbls yellow mustard,  2 tsp white vinegar and 1/2 tbls white sugar.   Before marinating I poked the tenderloin thouroughly with a fork on both sides. This is a super easy recipe and the entire family enjoyed it!

This dish was tasty, but a little salty and very runny from the soy sauce. The honey Dijon was a very flavorful addition. I served this with mashed potatoes which helped absorb the juices from the plate and really flavor the potatoes.

Used 2.75lb tenderloin in 2 pieces. Teriyaki instead of soy, no salt. 350° 45 minutes. Let rest at least 10 minutes. So juicy and tender, perfect! Used sweet hot mustard.

So simple and delicious!  Doubled the garlic and added fresh grated ginger.  Omitted salt.  Also had to sub stone ground mustard and honey for honey-mustard based on what I had available.  Loved the thick texture the changes created.

With a couple minor changes we thought this was great!  We didn't have honey mustard on hand so I used 3 TBS Dijon Mustard and 1 TBS Honey. Also used kosher salt. And we cooked it on the grill, which for me was key...made a very tasty crust on the meat and cooked perfectly when done to 145 degrees.

This is my go-to pork tenderloin marinade.  I make it exactly as is except I use regular honey mustard instead of the honey dijon and it is still delicious.  I typically am only cooking 1 lb of tenderloin at a time and I find that 30 minutes just about does it for cook time.  If you marinate it for about 48 hours you can't screw this up.  Everyone is always impressed when I serve this.  If you're looking to entertain and don't want to spend a ton of time prepping and supervising while cooking this is a great option.  I serve it with white wine risotto and a green vegetable and the presentation is great.

Ingredients for marinade are common fridge and pantry items-love that! However, I didn't have Honey Dijon mustard so subbed with Coarse Grain Dijon and honey, about 2 Tbs. each. I let meat marinate for 4 hours and baked as directed. The pork was delicious: flavorful, moist and tender. My family loved it-thanks Lori!

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  I added 2 TBSP brown sugar and listened to those who cut the soy a bit.  It made my pork taste a lot like Chinese Dumplings - great! It is good cooked as an au jus as well.  Thanks.

We also didn't have honey mustard-added some honey and it was good.  We used the low sodium soy sauce.  We used 4 cloves of garlic-personal taste-and it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe and the feedback suggestions!

For just the two of us, I halved the recipe and used one pork tenderloin. I did not have honey Dijon mustard so used Dijon mustard and added a squeeze on honey. Also did not add salt as soy sauce has enough. Marinated it about 2 hours. Husband put on gril on medium indirect heat for 25 to 30 minutes until internal temperature of meat was 140 degrees. It will keep cooking to reach FDA guidelines of 145 degrees. Perfect! Moist and juicy.

My husband loved it and it was very tasty.. and easy to make. Will definitely make again! Baked this at 400 for 15 min, then at 350 for 30 min. Next time, I will not put the sauce in until the latter half because the sauce burnt and I tasted it at times on the pork.

The amount of Soy Sauce is perfect, just don't marinade it for a ridiculous amount of time.  One hour at most.  I also added a tablespoon of honey and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Awesome recipe.

This was just ok. My husband liked it and my picky little girls ate it with ketchup and seemed to love it, it was very tender but I did not love the flavor. I may cook this the same way again but will not use this marinade.

Didn't have honey dijon on hand, so I used 1 tbs honey mustard and 1 tbs dijon -- tasted great!  Followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  Simple and yummy!!!  Will definitely be making this one again!

12 Feb 2015... Put the tenderloin in to marinate yesterday and baked it tonight for supper.  Moist and tender..  I misread the honeymustard and used dijon mustard and it turned out rather well.  My husband enjoyed it and I will make this again..  Perhaps I will use the honey mustard the next time.  Thanks!

Great flavor. I roasted at 350 for about an hour and had no problem with the marinade caramelizing or burning.   Perfect.  Next time I would add more garlic. Only had regular Dijon, so added just a touch of honey. No extra salt, but generous with fresh ground pepper. Drizzle sliced meat with pan juices.

Delicious marinade. I cooked it on a flat rack in a roasting pant. So, instead of pouring the excess marinade over the loin–I put it in a small sauce pan and cooked it with white wine, chicken stock and a little bit of corn starch.

This turned out great for us.  My family loved it.  I marinated the pork tenderloin on Fri afternoon, set in the fridge but didn't get to it until Sunday morning.  My husband stuck it in the slow cooker on 4 hours and we came home to a delicious lunch.  The meat was delicious and so moist.  We served it with rice and broccoli--YUM!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, so easy & good!

Very good recipe, easy and tasty. I did not have dijon honey mustard so I just used regular mustard and honey. I also added a few drops of worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and a half packet of goya sazon. The meat was extremely moist and tender. Will use again.

We had all this pork after the butchering, and my knowledge of pork extends only to recognizing the tail end of the beast....and somehow this recipe came out delicious.  It was good advice to eliminate the salt.  I marinated for 6 hrs and it was not too salty.

Left out the salt and this turned out great.  It had enough salty taste just from the soy sauce.  One of the more delicious pork marinades I've ever had.

We loved this recipe.   I followed the directions expect I didn't have the honey dijon so I just used dijon mustard and poured in some honey.  And what was great is how good it was left over.    So  now I can cook it ahead of time, slice, refrigerator and heat in the microwave before serving..   Happiness.

This is practically fool proof. The only change I make is to leave out the salt. I use low sodium soy sauce and that is all the salt needed. Marinate for one hour then pop it into the oven at 350 for one hour.  Allow the tenderloins to rest under a cover of foil for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing and you will have the most tender, flavorful pork you can get.  I've tried many recipes for pork tenderloin and none of them have been as good as this one.

This is a great, super easy marinade for pork loin.  I whipped this together quickly and let the pork marinade for just under an hour and it was quite tasty.  My whole family loved this new version of pork loin.

Cooked it almost exactly! I didn't have honey Dijon mustard so I used agave with Dijon. Did not use he added salt (I am sensitive to salty food). Oh, and I also marinated it for almost 24h. Served it with peas and jasmine rice. This is going to be a regular in my books. Everyone loved it!

This was delicious and very easy!  I read the reviews, so used "low sodium" soy sauce and for the mustard used Maille Rich Country Dijon.  It was fantastic and so very easy.  My husband loved it.  Served it with brown rice, with a little sauce on it of course, and a green salad.  Enjoy!

Used garlic infused olive oil in addition to the 1 clove called for in this recipe, low sodium soy sauce, no added salt, and about 1/4 tsp dried thyme. Marinated about 6 hours. Very good and tender. Entire family loved it. Personally, I'm not too big on soy sauce so may try wine instead next time. Or more garlic & pepper to mask it.

Really good blend of flavors! I too (like others) was skeptical of the amount of oil and soy sauce but everything was perfect quantities. I only changed one thing and that was the addition of grainy dijon mustard just because I had it and wanted to use it up, about 2 tsp. I cook pork tenderloin a lot and use many recipes. This one is a keeper! Thanks.

Made it this week and definitely a winner! Not much of a pork fan but after this recipe I've converted, HUGE fan now! Talk about super easy moreover how tasty this recipe is. The reviews were super helpful as well, followed many of your suggestions regarding not including salt also used the low sodium soy sauce and it was perfct. Aside from that didn't make any other changes since I was making it for the first time. I wanted to make it exactly as the recipe to see how it would turn out. Caramelization was also a concern but it wasn't as bad as I thought it could be.  I'm super happy I found this recipe! Thanks for posting it!!!

I must say this was delicious! My Husband and son loved it. I marinated it for two days and grilled it. The only thing I did different was to add about five cloves of garlic, because I add more garlic to every recipe. Also I had plain Dijon mustard so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar for sweetness. It was tender and juicy. I will use it again.

Turned out fantastic! I used a Bourbon seeded mustard instead of dijon. Cooking at such a low temperature really helps to keep it nice and moist. Got compliments from the hubby which is RARE.

While I'm not a pork fan, I found myself going back for seconds! I had 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard and used 2 tbsp of Bavarian mustard. I added 1 tbsp honey. To flavor the whole roast, I cut it twice (like I would if I was going to stuff it... Make a cut at the top third of the roast, peel the flap back and cut the remaining two thirds in half, ending up with a flat piece of meat - life a tri-fold wallet.) spread marinade on inside, roll up, bag, and add remaining marinade. I marinated for approx. 6 hours. All my picky eaters loved it, and it's easy enough to prepare in advance for an easy meal.

I have made this a number of times now and each time I do, it's a big hit with the whole family!  Even my picky eaters love it!  The pork comes out so tender and full of flavour.
I haven't made any changes to the original recipe. It's great just as it is!

Great recipe! I added some cubed potatoes, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Then I followd KippyJ and roasted for 15 minutes at 400, then lowered the temp to 350 and roasted an additional 30 minutes. I left it covered the entire time and then turned off the temperature and left it uncovered in the oven for a few minutes. Great recipe, came out very tender and delicious!

This was really delicious and, as the name states, easy.  I used regular Dijon mustard and added about a tablespoon of honey...since I didn't have honey dijon mustard.  Everything else was exactly as the recipe was written.  The end result was surprisingly moist and flavorful.  Thanks for offering the recipe. Husband and teenaged son enjoyed it too.

I prepared this recipe for my family.  I didn't have honey dijon mustard but just used a grainy mustard.  My family loved it so much.  So easy and quick to make.  My husband raved for days.  I am going to try again today and take some of the feedback in the reviews.  Thanks for a great easy and tasty recipe.

Made this as written except subbed the honey mustard with 2T of dijon and 1T of honey. It turned out tender and flavorful, I would definitely recommend this to people who don't want to overwhelm the meat with heavy marinade. Also, the kids (girls 11&9) loved it. I did simple green beans and some sprouted rice/quinoa blend as sides.

I have made this very simple pork roast several times, many times for guest. So easy and all prepped ahead of time. I do add a small amount of sesame oil and 5 spice powder. I cook with roasted red potatoes.

Mine did not look like this when it came out of the oven. Maybe you broiled it for a few minutes for the  brown crusty look on top?  My husband loved it. I thought it had a strong soy flavor and would have preferred sweeter. Next time I will use more honey and less soy sauce. I even thought about using a little red wine.

this was a very good recipe. you don't need to add salt at all since there's plenty of it in the soya sauce. I also added a bit more mustard just because i love mustard and i also added some worcestershire sauce.

Doubled the recipe for 2 pork loins. Would not double the oil next time. Turned out great! Seasoned (with spiced pepper) and used the sauce for flavor since others said it was bland. Will make again. Yum!

Excellent change of pace from marinated/grilled pork tenderloin. I increased the mustard and cut back a little on the soy sauce. Cooked it uncovered until it had a nice dark brown glaze on top. Very tasty!! I think next time I will try mustard with horseradish for a little kick.

Best and easiest marinade! When I find tenderloins on sale, I freeze them in the marinade and by the time they thaw & are cooked, the flavor is amazing & the meat is so tender! We lie this marinade on grilled chicken too!

Very good, easy, moist, flavorful. Next time I would watch the cooking time more closely, as mine ended up a bit dry (my fault for not watching). I would also omit the salt. Otherwise I loved the flavor of the marinade, and it was good over Sarah's Rice Pilaf, my go-to pilaf.

For someone who isn't to keen on pork we absolutely love this recipe. The only thing we left out was the salt. We have even grilled and oh wow just great. Thank you!

This came out very tasty. I didn't have any problems with the flavor, but I always use reduced sodium soy sauce (and I didn't add any salt to this) anyway. It made a fine pan sauce which did not require thickening to ensure tastiness or to get it to cling to my rice and veggies. It wasn't a THICK pan sauce, don't get me wrong, but the consistency was nice and clingy. I didn't taste the mustard at all but it added something great, which was nice, since I generally don't like a mustard flavor on anything but hot dogs or kielbasa or whatever. Thanks for sharing!

That was a 5-star Pork Tenderloin!  What flavor and so tender.  Can't wait to share the leftovers with my daughter's family!  Will definitely make that again, no substitutions.

UPDATE: Made this with only one tenderloin this time.  Halved the marinade recipe, changing the Dijon to honey mustard...a positive change! Roasted for 25 min at 425 degrees.  Perfect.
________________________________________
Everyone loved this!  Since I used two tenderloins, it may be that 45 min was a bit too much cooking time...Next time I will check at 35 min.  Also, may not need Dijon mustard at all...will try with only honey mustard next time.

I bought a 4.8 lb pork loin (boneless) on markdown and was looking for a recipe.  This sounds great. I am unsure how long I should cook it though. We don't have a meat thermometer. I was thinking 2 hours at 325, tented with foil for the majority of the time, uncovered the last half hour or so. Our oven runs hot, so we frequently have to drop the temperature. Any tips or suggestions?

The husband dubbed this 'instant classic' - it's so easy and it tastes great. Also didn't have Dijon honey mustard and used 2 tablespoons Dijon and 1 tablespoon of honey as others did and went easy on the salt since the soy sauce was already there.  Perfectly sweet, perfectly savory.  Served it with Grilled Sweet Potatoes (which went perfectly and was nice since we only have 1 oven) recipe on Allrecipes and corn.

I left out the salt and used plain mustard with some honey.  My husband absolutely loved this.  The favors were a bit overpowering for me in relation to the pork, but it seems men love this stuff.  Needless to say, I'll be making it again...

The items for the marinade were already in my fridge/pantry, so I tried this one over some of the other marinades.  It is fabulous!  Who would have known this easy combination would be so yummy!  Great bread dipping sauce when the pork drips on your plate, too.

First time making a pork tenderloin and this recipe made it super easy!! Hubby loved how good the house smelled while it was cooking!  I would definitely reduce the amount of salt used...the soy was plenty.  Will make it again and again! Perfect for company as well!

This was incredibly easy and absolutely delicious!!  I omitted both the salt and pepper and found the remaining ingredients brought great flavor without them.  I used 3 T regular dijon mustard and added about 1 1/2 T honey for two port tenderloins.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  A hit with the family, and something I'll definitely make again.

this is so easy and flavorful. my husband use to cringe when i made pork loin roast until i made this. i let it marinade for 24 hours and it came out delicious. the meat was tender and the flavor is off the hook. now my husband ask "are you marinading it?" when i say we are having pork roast. the leftovers are great in stirfry too because the flavors are already in the meat.

Made this last night and it turned out very tasty! I didn't have honey dijon mustard so I used 1 tbsp each of honey, dijon mustard and grainy dijon mustard.  After taking the roast out of the oven, I added a little more honey to the remaining marinade and a little cornstarch and used it as a sauce over the meat. I also usually don't add salt because I use salt on the cutting board when chopping or mincing garlic.

I've made pork loin a few times over the years and I've tried a different recipe each time. This one was by far our favorite. Everything from the smell of it cooking to the taste of the finished product is just delicious. I used a 3.5lb pork loin roast and just increased the cooking time to an hour and half. I also didn't have honey dijon mustard, I had honey mustard and I had dijon mustard so I just mixed equal parts of both. It was tender and juicy. I will definitely make this one again.

This recipe was incredible!  I tripled it for a 6 lb roast and we just couldn't get enough.  I might reduce the soy sauce in the future. Otherwise - perfection!

It was delicious. The only thing I would change next time is I wouldn't add any salt. The soy sauce adds enough salt by itself. Other than that it was most delicious. I will definitely make it again.
