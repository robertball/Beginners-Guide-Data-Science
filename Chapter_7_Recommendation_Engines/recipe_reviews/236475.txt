The rub is a solid 5 stars - it would be good on just about anything!  Instead of Salmon I used Steel Head trout. (A firm red fish like salmon.) Hubby cannot eat grapefruit so I made the salsa with Cara Cara oranges which was perfect. (blood oranges would be great).  I lined a sheet pan with parchment paper and placed the fish on one side and asparagus on the other end.  I did change the cooking time and temperature to 400 degrees convection setting for 10 minutes.  Both the fish and the asparagus were done at the same time.  Fast, easy, delicious and healthy too.  Served on a bed of rice with a spinach salad side.  Even the fish hating hubby like this.

Unfortunately, I was unable to buy fresh wild Alaskan sockeye salmon (my favorite), so I settled on farm-raised salmon which I knew wouldn't measure up in flavor. It was very fresh, it cooked perfectly at 20 minutes, and although the salmon itself wasn't all that flavorful, the rub really kicked it up a notch.  For our tastes, we could have  used a little more jalapeño in the salsa, but we enjoyed the pop of citrus flavor that came with the grapefruit.

Great recipe - the rub was fabulous! I subbed tilapia for the salmon to give it a try and no matter how much I pleaded with my husband to at least try fish he wouldn't...(maybe next time)so I ended up using the rub on pork for him which actually turned out very good. Since I wasn't a fan of the grapefruit salsa after making it I ended up going with a mango salsa instead. Overall, it was a nice blend of "sweet and spicy".

This rating will reflect the salmon only.  It was wonderful.  Just make it as written, unless you are a little iffy about the heat from the cayenne---then start with just half that amount and see what you think.  The salsa would be really good if it had some kind of liquid in it---olive oil, lemon or lime juice---anything.  It just needed something.  I had to use something other than grapefruit because of my husband's meds, so I chose to use an orange that came from a friend's tree.  That worked well.  You could easily get by with 1/4 of the salsa for this amount of fish.  I have leftover salsa, so I'll add something to that and make this same dish again this week.  It's that good.  Thanks, Mazola!

I actually really liked the salmon on this with the rub. Based on reading the other reviews, and about the heat with the rub, I only did a pinch of cayenne. I just don't care for hot food. It seemed like a lot of seasoning, but it was a nice amount after it was baked. I also made sure to do a packed but leveled amount of brown sugar, so it wasn't too sweet either. I lined a baking sheet with heavy duty foil, sprayed it with PAM well, and baked it on that. I didn't precisely measure the corn oil. I just drizzled it. I liked the mild taste of the corn oil compared to others I typically use. I think the extra amount may have given it a nice crispiness. I have never baked salmon in the regular oven and really liked the ease of this method. I usually use a broiler or sauté pan. I kept it in for 30 minutes and it seemed like a good amount of time. 1 lb is really not a lot of salmon. I got 4 really small pieces. So, I would make more next time. I used skin on salmon, but might try the skinned kind next time. The salsa, I was really not excited about. I made 1/2 recipe of it and it was plenty. It makes an interesting combination when a bite of it is eaten with the salsa. Grape fruit has also really gotten sweeter from what I remember as a kid. I bought what my local grocery store had, called cocktail grapefruit. I made sure to cut off all of the outer peel, the white pith, and seeds before chopping, to help with bitterness. I am rating this a 4, as I plan to make the salmon again. ty

I really like this recipe!  The rub adds a smoky, savory, and gently sweet crust to the salmon--a great way to add flavor to the fish.  I opted to use red grapefruit in the salsa, made it a few hours in advance, and it's delicious.  It was just sweet enough, and tasted very fresh.  I felt healthy eating this recipe, and will definitely make it again.  This would be fantastic over a bed of citrus-flavored vegetable quinoa.  YUMMM!

My review pretty much dittos all the rest of the reviews. A winning recipe! The only two deviations I made were to halve the recipe for the two of us and change out grapefruit for mandarin oranges due to a meds conflict with grapefruit. The salmon spices are spot on. The salsa was perfect and necessary for the salmon. This recipe is restaurant quality, company worthy and week day friendly! Thanks to the Mazola chefs for a keeper!

I had to change the salsa a bit, none of us like cilantro, so I used parsley.  My grapefruit was really tart so I added about 1/2 tsp of honey and let the flavors meld for a few hours while I prepared the rest of our meal.  This was a treat, I splurged on wild caught sockeye salmon and the rub was a terrific blend of sweet and spicy, enhancing the flavor perfectly.  All in all, a great meal.  Thank you!

Followed the recipe as written except replaced cilantro with parsley because we can't stand the stuff.  The dish got mixed reviews.  Hubby liked it, he said he would give it 4 stars, would have been 5 if it had instructed to remove the skin.  One daughter liked the fish but not the salsa, the other liked the salsa but not the fish.  My son took one look at it and refused to even taste it, and I didn't care for it at all.  In fairness I'm not much of a salmon fan.  The rub and salsa would probably be great on chicken.  I won't make the salmon again but might try the rest with chicken sometime, especially since there was so much salsa left over.

I have to say I really wondered about the combination of grapefruit salsa and salmon, because I just couldn't imagine the two together.  The salmon rub was tasty, and though it has a long list of ingredients, it's good.  My only substitution was to use smoked paprika instead of the regular, because I just like it, OK?  The real surprise was the grapefruit salsa.  "Let's get Bibi to try it.  Hey, Bibi, she likes it!"  Actually, I put it on the side because I thought I wouldn't like it, but I found myself going back for more and more.  In fact, I kept eating the salsa after the salmon was all gone!  My only tweaks to the salsa were to add a pinch of sea salt and about a teaspoon of fresh lime juice.  Yum, yum!

I don’t eat salmon, so this is my husband’s take on this recipe.  He didn’t care for the seasoning and would have preferred it plain, and the salsa didn’t compliment the salmon.  I personally thought the salsa was pretty good and a nice variation.

My whole family really enjoyed this dish! Although I love grapefruit, both my husband and I can't have it due to a medication that we take. I substituted with 2 cups mango, and the juice of an orange (in trying to keep with the citrus flavors of the recipe). I liked the sweet/spicy of both the rub and the mango salsa! I decided to keep it really healthy and served it on top of a bed of arugula instead of with a starch. It was a delicious and satisfying, healthy meal - and one that I'd make again. Thanks Mazola!

This review is mainly for the rub, it was very good on chicken. If I could eat Salmon I am sure it would have been goon on that as well. Do to medication interactions I could not use grapefruit so I subbed with cucumber instead. I also used red onion instead of green onions because I forgot the green onions. I added a bit of garlic salt and lime to the salsa after initially tasting the salsa and it was perfect. It paired well with the chicken.

This recipe is very good. I was lucky enough to get wild-caught salmon which we love when we can't get the sockeye salmon that we used to get in the PNW. We thought the rub was very good. I was a bit skeptical about the brown sugar, but it wasn't too sweet at all!  I, too, went a different way with the salsa for medication reasons. I made the salsa in the recipe but instead,used pineapple and threw in some mango. It was a hit!  I also made a recipe for rice that we really love and my husband could not get enough of it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Three  stars because the salmon was wonderful by itself (Caught by me this summer in the Puget Sound!), and the salsa was okay by itself. Together, it became a flavor that was VERY undesirable. They did not marry well. Mango, pineapple, or a sweeter fruit may make this better! I really like the concept of the dish, (Spicy, sweet salmon)however, this recipe didn't work in our house.

My hope was to enjoy this recipe, which we did not. While the rub was easy to make and salmon looked pretty as pretty as the grapefruit salsa, we have mixed reviews from my husband and I, but we both agreed, that neither of us cared for the tart but spicy salsa. We both have addictions to salsas but this was not good. The spice rub was too sweet on that back note. While you could taste the heat 1st thing out of the gate on the crust of the salmon, the sweetness came through at the end and sat there on the palate, not something I care for with fish. My husband said the salmon tasted fine to him, but that's where I partly agree, because as soon as you scraped off the seasoned crust, the rest of the salmon was fine. I'd make the rub again but omit the brown sugar all together. I made this recipe completely to a T and unfortunately it missed the mark. So sorry.

This is a winner all around. If you've never sectioned a grapefruit before (with a knife), google for directions. So much better than peeling the grapefruit and pulling apart the sections that covered in the membrane that can be tough to chew.  This was not spicy at all. Next time I will add more cayenne to get a bit of heat  This would also be very good grilled.  Instead of baking at 375 for 15-20 mins, I much prefer the flavor of broiling it for 10-12 mins. This gives it a nicer crust with moist center.  Do not overcook salmon!

I was a bit skeptical at first with all of the seasonings and salsa ingredients going on.  This dish was wonderful!  The combination of flavors melded nicely.  Be sure to take a bite of the salsa with the salmon for the full flavor experience.  Thanks Mazola for a terrific recipe!

We loved this. I made the grapefruit salsa and I used the Ruby Red Grapefruit. I added a dash of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar as my grapefruit were very tart for Ruby Reds. I put the rub and oil on the Salmon and let it sit on the salmon for about a hour or two. Then I grilled it. Wow that was good.

I LOVED the salmon w/ the rub, but I wasn't too keen on the salsa. I did have to use orange instead of grapefruit (which we LOVE), due to conflict with medications, but overall, it just seemed too blah to me. I would've been happier just squirting some lemon over the top of the fish and calling it a day, which is what I will do next time. This was a nice, healthy lunch for me today, and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My salmon was cooked perfectly at 20 minutes. The grapefruit salsa was a little overpowering but did complement the fish well. Without the salsa, coating on the fish was too sweet for my liking.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars based on the rub only. We did not care for the grapefruit salsa.
My family does not eat salmon, so I first made this recipe using boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I pounded flat. The chicken turned out with a nice flavor, but it didn't wow me. My best friend does eat seafood, so I prepared the salmon for her as directed and she really enjoyed the fish. She said that it was mainly sweet and could have used more spice in her opinion, but it was still good and she would eat it again.

Amazing dinner. Wasn't sure how the salsa would taste but it was perfect with the rub. Couldn't find a grapefruit so I subbed a navel orange and it was still delicious. Paired the entire meal with a side salad of mixed greens, cucumbers, sliced red onions topped with pine nuts, dried cranberries, and a raspberry vinaigrette. I'll definitely be making this again sometime soon!

This was interesting and good but not great. I made the salsa and rub exactly as directed except for using half the rub since I kept the skin. I didn't think I could stick that much to one side and this amount covered the top and side in a full layer. I also do not use corn oil so I subbed another mild oil. We grilled this, skin side down, for 15 min at about 375 and I am glad we did not use the full amount of rub as it would have been too much. It was a nice compliment to the salmon and the heat was quite mild except for aggravating an already tender throat. Not at all hot on the tongue though. We love grapefruit and didn't find this one to be bitter, sweet/tart would be a better description(I always remove the membrane from grapefruit) but the fish rub combined with the salsa at some times was bitter even though the salsa wasn't on it's own. I wouldn't make the salsa again- it was okay but not as good as other fruit salsas we've had and seemed to be lacking something. Perhaps using sweeter fruits, as others have done, makes for a better combo. As written, I would not make again.

Fantastic Recipe...one of the best for salmon that I have tried. I doubled the rub and used the extra to make a thicker topping.  The mazola really worked to help the rub/topping stick to the salmon.  Overall delicious combination of flavors!

I really changed this one up.  We don't like salmon or spicy stuff.  I didn't make the salsa either.  But with that being said, I got a tilapia filet and used the other flavors just as posted and it was terrific!  One of my boyfriends favorite recipes now!

I like the rub! Tasty and flavorful. As for the grapefruit salsa, I think it is a good complement to the salmon. I cheated and sprinkled about 1/4 tsp sugar so it isn't that sour...

I tried this out tonight and was pleasantly surprised... I left the salsa on the side just in case I didn't like it etc but I found that the rub on the fish was a bit bitter and the salsa is what makes it.
I think the rub needs a little less paprika but not sure.

This had outstanding flavor.  We used pink grapefruit from our tree which made making the salsa rather labor intensive.  Will make again, but will use canned grapefruit sections.

It was something new that we tried. It was great with mashed potatoes and a nice green salad. Next time for the rub I will use less cayenne pepper.

We liked the rub and it had a nice flavor. The grapefruit salsa didn't go with the fish at all for us. A different fruit subbed would be better. Not sure I will make this again.

Rating is for the rub and salsa because I made this with pork chops instead of salmon.  Rub was pretty good!  Not very spicy, and not sure where the 'sweet' was because the salsa was bitter.  we learned we do not like grapefruit salsa; for us it is best served with breakfast.  Thanks for the try though.

Diid not love the spice rub.  The cooking method was ok if you change the spice rub to your taste.  We do not eat grapefruit, so I grilled some fresh pineapple and served it withe the salmon and rice.  Loved the grilled pineapple.

My husband and I loved this dish.  The flavors in the rub were fantastic, and I’ll be trying the rub on other meats because it’s just that good!  The salsa was unique and refreshing; it would be perfect for a summer dinner.  The jalapeño gives it a nice kick.  We’ll definitely be trying this meal again.

Loved this recipe! Since I was cooking only for me, I decided to just do this in a saute pan on the stove...only took 5 minutes! I just put about a tablespoon of Mazola oil in the hot pan, placed salmon skin side down in pan, for about 2 minutes, turned the fish and cooked for about another 2 minutes! Came out perfect! This rub was delicious! Thank you Mazola for this great recipe.

Due to the fact that my family would not touch this with 3 certain ingredients in it, I had to swap them out beforehand. We used tilapia instead of salmon and tomatoes in place of the grapefruit & red bell pepper. It was delicious with our changes. The seasoning was wonderful, I plan on using it quite a bit in the future with other fillets of fish. The salsa had a nice kick to it that blended nicely with everything else. We served this on top of rice and it was gone in no time.

The salmon and the rub were very good.. I didn't care for the salsa and took it off. I made it with oranges instead of grapefruit to avoid any interactions, but I just didn't like the raw red pepper. I will make the same and rub again though

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's delicious, nutritious, light and filling. I subbed oranges for grapefruit and parsley for cilantro (not a fan). In the rub I used just a dash of cayenne because I'm a heat wimp. The rub was perfect. The fruit in the salsa balanced well with the heat from the cayenne and jalapenos. I will try this on the grill in the summer. It's a keeper!

The salmon cooked to perfection in 20 minutes. I did sub mandarin orange due to conflicts with meds for the grapefruit other than that I followed the recipe as written. Next time I may add a jalapeno to the salsa.

I had to substitute Swai fillets for the salmon, because here in Ohio, salmon is incredibly expensive right now.  Swai fillets are a mild white fish, much thinner than salmon, so I decreased the bake time to 10 minutes, which was perfect.  I made the rub as written, but omitted oregano, as we are not fans.  The fish and the rub were quite good.  I made the salsa as written, but I'm sorry, we did not like it.  We could not get past the bitterness of the grapefruit. No one here likes grapefruit on it's own, but I thought maybe in cut up small in a salsa we might like it. We did not. Perhaps subbing pineapple or blood orange for the grapefruit would make it more palatable to our tastes. Fish and rub=5 stars.  Grapefruit salsa=1 star.

My husband and I really liked the rub on the salmon.  It gave the salmon a nice crispiness on the outside and sealed in the flavors well.  We were not crazy about the salsa.  We are not fans of grapefruit so I did substitute mandarin oranges instead. I am also not a big fan of cilantro so I would just skip the salsa next time I make this.  But other than that, the rub was great and the salmon was cooked perfectly and it was visually appealing.  I served this over a bed of rice and with some asparagus on the side.

My family liked this dish.  I used fresh ruby red grapefruit.  It does take some time removing the membrane from the white fibrous sections so to save time you could buy jarred grapefruit.  We did not eat all the salmon so we had leftovers. My son said it tasted even better the next day.

I love how fresh and vibrant all the flavors are when combined together. I doubled the spice rub this time and really massaged it in, topped with a hearty portion of salsa, then served it alongside roasted broccoli with a squeeze of lemon on top, which was a fantastic complement! It’s a light-tasting dish that’s simple enough to make for a weeknight, fancy enough for company, and easily scalable should you want to make for a large crowd.

This was a huge hit at my house. I added 1/2 cup mango and 1/3 cup cucumber to the salsa. It came out delicious and cut the overly tart taste from the grapefruit.

I am a huge grapefruit fan, but the salsa was just so-so to me. The salsa ingredients just did not combine that well for me. I loved the rub, and I agree it could be very versatile. I think I would have preferred a tomato-based sauce/salsa (with a kick) with the rub. I paired this with "Lime Cilantro Cauliflower 'Rice'" from this site, and it was a great complement!

Used smaller fillets of tilapia and salmon, and added some orange in place of some of the grapefruit. The salsa was not a big hit, but that may be up to our personal taste. I also recommend using salmon or a salmon-like fish over other kinds, as its flavor works better with the salsa. But the rub was certainly spectacular on its own on both fish, and we'll make fish that way again.

This review is actually ore of a 4.5 than a 4, except we took considerable liberties with the fruit salsa.  We replaced the grapefruit with diced mango, added an additional jalepeno and made a "dressing" of lime juice and honey which complimented the rubbed salmon wonderfully.  We applied the rub about 15-20 minutes before cooking and let it sit uncovered at room temp.  The salmon with just the rub was great but then topped with the mango salsa really turned it into a grilled feast-one I'd be proud to serve to guests!  I also loved the fact that we were able to prepare it with already having had the majority of the ingredients on hand :)

The only problem with this recipe is that the salmon is sweet and the salsa isn't. Fish shouldn't be sweet, and salsa is flexible. Grapefruit adds a subtle sweetness, but it doesn't taste nasty with the fish. It's pleasantly bitter and tangy and everything good. Drop the brown sugar from the salmon, and the recipe would be 5 stars.

The entire family loved this recipe!  The rub was wonderful, we will be using that on fish again in the future as well as poultry, and we didn't find it too hot.  Again, if you are concerned with how spicy it may be, just reduce the amount of the cayenne.  Instead of the grapefruit salsa, I made a mango/pineapple/canteloupe salsa, and it was nice and refreshing paired with the salmon.  I would definitely make this again.

I invited my aunt and cousin over for this. I do not like salmon. I did try it and all I can say was it will definitely not convert a fish hater :) So I asked them to rate it. They gave it 3 stars. Said it needed more salt and more heat. I did use mandarin oranges instead of grapefruit which worked nicely. Cooked perfectly in the time said.

I tried this recipe today & was totally prepared not to like it at all. . I didn't really care for the salsa until I  added a few Tbsp. of sugar to it. There was a little too much heat to the salsa & the rub. My preference, I guess. I like the fish to be the main thing I taste, not heat. Too much cilantro also. Just my taste preference again. I served this to my Aunt also & she agreed with me. Don't get me wrong, we both liked it really well, but would tweak it slightly next time.

I received the Corn Oil from Mazola in order to facilitate my review - the thoughts and review are my own opinion - thanks for reading.

My family does not cook fish a lot.  My father is a big fisherman and we LOVE fish - when he prepares it.  I was definitely out of my comfort zone on this.  We liked this and it was easy to prepare.  I don't want to give it a negative review because it has nothing to do with the recipe - we're just not big fish eaters.  I will definitely make it again and might tweak it a bit. The boyfriend isn't a big grapefruit fan.

I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because of the grapefruit. We all loved the salmon. It had great flavor and tasted less "fishy" so for anyone who doesn't care for fish but wants healthy, this is good. We don't really care for grapefruit to begin with but eating it with the salmon gave it a bitter taste, probably because grapefruit is bitter. Go figure. I think maybe it would have been better with something like pineapple or mango. The salsa was good on the salmon without the grapefruit though so adding in something other than grapefruit could have improved the flavor more.

I have now made this every Friday and have been so happy with the taste! Great recipe and I have been changing it up with adding different vegetable accompaniments and have been so pleased! I see myself pre-making the rub-like I did and having it on hand! Easy and flavorful! I am so happy with this being our Friday dinner again and again.

The rub is delicious, though I omitted thyme and oregano due to personal preference. The salsa was delicious. I omitted the red bell pepper since my husband does not like them. I should have replaced it with a tomato to add the red color. Overall, a good and different fish recipe. We used Texas ruby red sweet grapefruit.

This was really easy and delicious! I used mandarin oranges that I rinsed instead of the grapefruit. I added salt and pepper to the salsa and halved my jalapeno since I had a very large one. Even my 14 month old ate this. I really liked the rub for the salmon.

I don't usually make fish or any kind of "fruit" salsa. I followed the recipe but did change one thing by subbing mandarin oranges for the grapefruit. I was surprised - my 8 year old son ate it so quickly and didn't say it was too spicy (he has very low tolerance to heat). He loved it! The flavors come together perfectly and it looked awesome as well. I'd make it again.

This rub was fantastic and we actually used it on mahi-mahi!  the salsa was lacking, I must say, although it wasn't bad (I used pineapple instead of grapefruit both due to personal taste and what I had on hand already.)  The jalapeno gave it a nice kick but overall it was a bit bland and needed more liquid to make it more salsa-esque.  The rub, however, was the big hit and, as other reviewers have said, would work well on several dishes.

I made this recipe using chicken and mandarin oranges because my family does not eat seafood or grapefruit. I loved the concept of this recipe and really enjoyed it with my substitutions.  The rub was really good and paired with the orange salsa, it really put this dish over the top!

I loved that this was super easy to make and called for everyday ingredients that we probably already have one hand or can find easily in the store. I am not much of a fish person, but I really enjoyed this and would make it again. Kudos for helping my family make healthier choices :)

I have to agree with previous reviewers that the rub is wonderful and an easy five stars!  It was easy to get together and used ingredients that I had in my pantry.  I was torn on the salsa though.  I made one version as the recipe stated using grapefruit and a doctored up version using mandarin oranges, lime juice, salt, pepper, & olive oil for my husband who cannot have grapefruit due to an interaction with medication.  I liked the freshness of the grapefruit salsa, but, I was not crazy about the flavor with the salmon.  It was a little too tart for me.  My husband really enjoyed the orange salsa with the fish.  I tried a bite and have to agree I preferred the sweeter salsa.  I believe the salsa recipe is a good start and you should adjust it to your taste.  Thanks for the recipe Mazola!

The salmon was very tasty. We enjoyed the spicy rub and will probably make the rub again. Since my family likes spicy food, I would add some chipolte chile powder. I used blood oranges instead of grapefruit for the salsa. My husband was skeptical of the salsa with the salmon, but it was a wonderful addition to the fish.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!! I added some Mazola Heart Healthy oil to the pan and dropped in my seasoned salmon and waited. . . 5 minutes later I flipped and served. My hubby almost did a back flip for this fish dish with the wonderful salsa! It's a Warm Saturday evening and this hit the spot:) Thank You Mazola!

I love Salmon...and this marinade was truly AMAZING, and the Mazola corn oil had such a lightness.  I did switch out cucumber for the pineapple, only because I don't like fruit with my food.  This was truly an outstanding recipe!!!

I made the salsa, tasted it, and decided it was going to be entirely too tart and too hot, even though I used sweet red grapefruit and only 3/4 of the jalapeno. However, I decided to taste it with the salmon first. I am so glad I did! Somehow, the flavors were perfect with the fish, and no extra sweetener was needed. Nor was it too hot. How is that possible? I don't know, but I had to have a bite of salsa with every bite of salmon. Very complementary, and it was pretty enough for guests.

This dish was wonderful and had such complex levels of flavor. I was not excited by the grapefruit salsa after reading the recipe but the sour/bitter taste that grapefruit normally has was offset by the nice sweet undertones of the rub and it all worked together perfectly! I used organic red grapefruit which might have helped. Two cups of grapefruit is a lot - I had to cut up 4 whole grapefruits and I still only ended up with one and a quarter cup of cut fruit - but it worked fine - I just added quite a bit less cilantro (a couple of teaspoons chopped)and this worked well for me because I am not a big fan of cilantro anyway. I loved the crunch of the red pepper. The Mazola oil makes a rich fish even richer and gives the dish good flavor. Rub the rub onto the fish very gently - I was a bit vigorous and it was caking up me. To serve, I topped the fish with just a tablespoon of salsa and tossed some white rice with some of the salmon drippings and a bit of salsa - maybe a teaspoon of each. Delicious!

I stepped out of my comfort zone to make this recipe. I eat no fish sea or fresh water. I tried a small bite or two and loved the taste, just not the texture. So if you like fish fresh or seafood you will LOVE this recipe. I used blood oranges in place of grapefruit in the salsa and we liked the results very much.

The rub was smoky, which is a great flavor, but I like my salmon more on the simple side.  The grapefruit salsa was absolutely amazing, however, and perfect with this salmon/rub combo.  Will be making the salsa again for certain.

This was delicious!  I love the tang of the grapefruit with the warming spices and in our home, salmon is welcome to the table any day of the week.  We did add sea salt and fresh squeezed orange juice (a teaspoon or so) to the salsa.

This made grocery store frozen salmon ($12.99/2 6 oz portions) taste like dinner out in well under 30 minutes.  I already had some previously made mango salsa in our freezer, so I chose to sub that for the grapefruit salsa.  I followed the salmon directions (omitting black pepper per personal preference), though I did forget to brush the Mazola(R) corn oil until AFTER I'd rubbed the filets with spices.  It made no discernible difference.  I served it over Uncle Ben's Ready Rice (the garlic/wild rice variety) I'd nuked and then sautéed in corn oil, onion, and garlic.   Heavenly week night meal worthy of weekend company.   THANKS for the recipe!

We liked the rub very much.  It was not spicy for us so I made the salsa with a bit more heat.  I served over a bed of rice I tossed in some Mazola oil I sauteed a bit of garlic and parsley in.  Normally I would use butter but the oil was pleasantly light and flavorful.  Will be making this again hopefully on the grill with a cedar plank.

This was an easy, but tasty dish!  My salmon was cooked perfectly at 15 minutes.  The grapefruit salsa was a great addition.  It was slightly tart --the next time I make the dish I think I will add a little bit of honey or agave to the salsa.  Try this you won't be sorry!

I found the salmon ok, but the salsa really made the dish. 

First off, I soaked my salmon in buttermilk in the fridge for an hour to get rid of any fishy smell and taste. Then I patted it dry and prepared the rub as stated above. While it was cooking, I made my salsa. I did however make changes to the salsa. I forgot to pick up the jalapeños, so I substituted red pepper flakes instead. I also added a little salt and garlic powder. It came out amazing. I was surprised too, seeing how I am not the biggest fan of grapefruit. It wasn't tart or sour at all. 

After my salmon was done, I took it out of the oven and tasted it as is. I found it kind of bland, but when I added the salsa the flavor was amazing. I'm giving this 4 stars, because without the salsa the fish is ok, but you really need the salsa to complete the dish.

I would have given it a better rating, but I substituted a lot in this recipe, and I probably ruined it because of that. I used tilapia instead of salmon and can't eat grapefruit so used oranges. Not so good.  LIke I said, it was my fault for not going by the recipe.  I did use the wonderful blend of spices though, which were good.  No photo-trust me, you wouldn't want to see it!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  It is a nice combination of spicy and sweet.  I think I lucked out and got mild jalapeno. The salsa was mild, but I'm hoping tomorrow the flavors will blended since there was one piece of fish left for my lunch tomorrow.
