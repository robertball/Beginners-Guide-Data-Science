Wow this was easy and delicious! I planned extra time to make it since it was a first, but I was blown away at how quickly it was prepared and cooked. I sautéed some shrimp with lime and garlic and added them on top which was the perfect addition. This will be a regular meal in my house!

Very yummy and easy to make tho beware of the spice factor.  I love spicy food but as soon as I saw the number and amount of peppers and chili powder I knew to go easy on it.  I used diced tomatoes with green chiles (no jalapeno), 1 tsp chili flakes, and 1/2 tsp chili powder.  My quinoa turned out delicious and still quite spicy but perfect for my tastebuds.  Love this and will make it again!

Absolutely love this, have made several times.  We leave out some of the heat (do mild green chiles instead) and add frozen organic kale and frozen organic cubed sweet potato (I'm sure you could do fresh too but we keep it easy!) for even more flavor and nutrition.  Excellent recipe and not difficult at all. Thank you!

This was so good, easy and flavorful!  I added 2 breasts of chicken, and chopped then and cooked them in the skillet before adding the quinoa and other ingredients.  I made this for a little pot luck, and everyone loved it!

Super easy to make - I used 1 tsp red pepper flakes instead of a Tablespoon - I also used a can of Rotel regular in place of the tomatoes and jalapenos because I did not have a jalapeno on hand and the Rotel has them w/the tomatoes in one can.  Almost the exact recipe and it was delish!

This was a fast, easy and delish recipe.  I add shrimp the last 10 minutes and we had a complete meal.  This one is def a keeper.

I am not an avid cook, but this is something that's easy to make, impresses people, and lets you experiment! I've tried varying level of heat, threw in random spices to substitute, and added chorizo, limey chicken, etc..

This has become a staple of my household and will continue to be one. Love it!

Knowing my preference for simplicity, I used a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of  the roasted tomatoes and all of the spices (except the garlic).  After cooking the quinoa, I sprinkled shredded Mexican blend cheese over top, covered the pan & removed if from the stove.  There was just enough spiciness and smoothness.  Left out the avocado & lime juice too because I didn't have them on hand.  I'm looking forward to lunch leftovers!

I have made this many times and it always turns out. I even made it a day ahead of time and took it with us when we went camping. I just waited and added the diced avacado after reheating it. Only thing I changed was I used a red bell pepper instead of the jalapeno because I can't eat really hot spicy foods. A little shredded cheddar on top makes it extra special.

My 8, 6, and 2 year old loved it. Quick and super easy weeknight dinner. Served with a side of corn chips. Substituted pack of low sodium taco seasoning for jalapeño and hot pepper.

Way too spicy (even though I added less chili powder and no jalapeno) and yet even my 5 year old made it through, when I topped it with sour cream and cheese and let him use it as 'dip.'

We drank lots of water to get it down and will definitely make again, but with a bit less spice. :)

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! Quinoa has been so boring to me up to now.

I was a little skeptical at first, as this was my family's first time trying quinoa but it turned out amazing (even though I forgot the lime juice)! Instead of the recommended amount of ground cumin and chili powder, I used a pack of taco seasoning instead and only put a DASH of chili powder and ground cumin to give it a little added kick. I will definitely be making this again!

This was too spicy. 1 TB of hot pepper flakes was a bit too much. I'd cut it down to about half that next time.

The whole family loved this. I used one teaspoon of chili flakes and that was perfect. I also barbecued two ears of corn and stirred that in instead of canned or frozen. I'll do that whenever possible because it was great.

It was very spicy and would lessen red pepper flakes in the future. I would use as a side dish in lieu of main course. My husband thought it would make a great Mexican dip for scoop type chips. It was flavorful and colorful as well.

I love this recipe; I made it several times.  Each time experimenting a bit with this or that.  I find the best adjustment is  1/2 T of red pepper ,  1 tsp of chili powder, and draining the water from the diced tomatoes.  Jalepenos make it spicey too, but I am not sacrificing that great flavor.

This is a fantastic little recipe! I stuck to and rated based on the integrity of the recipe. So made a few additions, but the base recipe deserves five stars, IMO. I used coconut oil to saute, added onion and green/red bell peppers, and did not add chili flakes. Used just a little fresh jalopeno because I want my kid to be able to eat it, and then garnished my bowl with more. The flavors are great and the lime/cilantro/avocado to finish (I topped bowls with them rather than put in skillet) was perfect. I also added a spoon of yogurt just to increase protein and meld the heat. For cooks who want to increase the vitamin/nutrient level, I threw in some chopped fresh spinach, diced carrot, and a little sweet potato I had on hand.

Made this last week! Absolutely delicious, I will definitely be making this again! I added quite a bit more garlic than called for (can never have too much) only used 1 tsp. of the red chilli flakes and upped the chilli powder to 2 Tbsp. The whole family loved it!

I used 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and sub'd a 7 ounce can of green chiles for the jalapenos. I cooked 1 cup of dry beans, drained them and used that in lieu of a can of beans. It was likely a little more beans. I misunderstood the directions and precooked 1/3 quinoa to end up with a total of 1 cup cooked quinoa which I added with the beans, corn (a little extra to use up my partial bag of frozen corn), etc. So there was less quinoa. Then I added the chicken broth which made it a little soupy. Luckily, it had to sit a bit while I went out for cilantro and avocados. When I got back it had thickened up noticeably. We served it with chips and used bowls. It was pretty good. A little warm. The fresh avocado and cilantro were a great addition, we omitted the lime juice.

Used bell pepper instead of jalopena, went lighter on the red pepper, chili powder, and cumin.  Yeah, we're wimps.  Easy, tasty, healthy, and good the next day.  

Also good with some yogurt or cottage cheese on top.

Finally, a recipe without Campbell's soup!! Very nice meal. Thanks for adding some citrus to the ingredients, it really does add more flavour to the food.

I was surprised how good this was. I even messed up and only had 1/4c of quinoa. I adjusted the liquid accordingly. Omitted the jalapeño and only added a dash of pepper flakes. ( would have been far too hot otherwise)
And I added some shrimp seasoned with old bay.
This was a test run for a cousins reunion dinner in a few days. Hubby loved it too. Easy and good!

I add twice the cumin and chili powder. I often use Rotel tomatoes instead of regular canned, diced tomatoes.

I made this with white rice since I didn't know I had NO quinoa in the house. I have to say, this is delicious; spicy, lots of crunch and just good flavor. I am positive it would be just as good with the quinoa. I can't wait to make it again.

This was great and tonight I'm making it for the 2nd time.  I also added some frozen sweet potatoes and dialed back on the spices --about a teaspoon red pepper flakes .  Since I am out of jalapeno, tonight I am using some poblano pepper instead.  I took the advice of others and served with some shredded cheddar too and served with tortilla chips for dipping.  A good "Meatless Monday" dinner if made with veggie broth!

Enjoyed the spiciness and the tang of lime juice and cilantro. Used 1/2 tsp chili flakes and one 10oz can fire roasted tomatoes and green chilies. Made the mistake of not having quinoa so had to quickly substitute cooked rice. Omitted the water and added shrimp. Baked in oven for 30 min until heated through.  Enjoyed this very much.

This is an easy recipe to put together for a quick lunch or dinner.   It was even more quick because I had cooked quinoa in my fridge.   So I cut way back on the chicken broth .  I didn't have the type of tomatoes called for in the recipe so I used salsa instead and I didn't use a whole can of black beans or corn.  ( I made it for 2 of us )   Obviously this is a recipe that can be tweaked to your family's likings. My husband thought it had too much lime  zing.  We juiced about 3/4 of a small lime.   I will definitely make this again.

Added just a little diced onion. I guess my pepper was really hot, because it was a little too hot, and I like spice! Good though.

Absolutely delicious, made the following changes : reduced red pepper flakes to one tsp., and added one pound of browned ground turkey lightly seasoned with taco seasoning, topped with avocado in the skillet after mixing in turkey. Served with shredded cheddar cheese and nonfat plain Greek yogurt. My husband and daughter and I finished in two days, leftovers for lunch. Will definitely make again!

Easy, tasty, filling. Thumbs up. I skipped the jalapeños because I’ve never been a fan and subbed 1/2 tsp of the chili powder with powdered chili ancho. Will be returning to this dish.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and all four of my family members did not like it. I will give it a clap for being easy and quick. I just did not care for the tatse of it. Also, tossing in the avacado at the end and having it slightly warm was a miss. Reviews said very flavourful but my family all said it wasn't great.

This is a simple, easy-to-make, and yummy  dish that will appeal to the whole family. I wasn't even looking for it specifically on AllRecipes. I was bored one day and just picked the first recipe that popped up. Everyone who says that it packs a bit of a punch is right, but that's easy to adjust. I like spice, but I still used only 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of a tablespoon, which still left a bit of a punch.  I also removed the seeds from the jalapeño and added the spices in earlier, when the jalapeño and garlic were almost ready, so that the fragrances and flavors could better meld. Just saute for a minute or under to release the essences. We added lots more lime and cilantro at the end! Even my husband, who loves very spicy, complex foods, really enjoy this. It's now in our monthly rotation!

I did not add the seeds from the jalapeño and reduced the amount of red pepper flakes.  It was definitely spicy enough.  Also, I added some Feta Cheese on top!  Excellent dish

I was not sure how I would like this, but it was great. I only put a small amount of Jalapeno. It is filling and if you have any issues with carbs, this one is slow reacting and healthy.

Very much enjoyed it but I did not make it spicy enough for my taste. I reduced the red pepper and Chili powder by 50 % based on some other reviews.

This was a great recipe. I actually added a whole can of chicken broth and some fajita grilled chicken. I served it over crunched multigrain Tostitos with a dollop of sour cream. I was a little worried that my hubby wouldn’t care for it and he’s eating his second bowl!  It was a hit and I will make it again!

This was SUCH a simple recipe!  I cut down on the cayenne a bit, because I was a bit worried about the spiciness for hubby...he loved it, and this will definitely be on our "keeper" list.  I also added some chopped grilled chicken that I had leftover ;  it added nicely to the mix.

This was so easy and delicious. I changed the chilli peppers for taco seasoning. Added shredded chicken to the mixture and sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips on top. I even at this cold the day after as a salad and it was even better. My partner, who is not a quinoa fan, couldn’t get enough of this.  Will definitely make it again.

We loved it! Almost to hot for one of us, but not. 
May add a little less chili flakes next time.  This dish would be nice with some tortillas on the side.  We will definitely be making this often.

This recipe was a hit.  Close to the end of cooking time, I added some shredded rotisserie chicken.  It was definitely a full meal then and everyone gave it a thumbs up.  Our family loves spice, but I think the crushed pepper might make it too hot for kids or adults that don’t eat spicy.  Will definitely be making this again and again..

The one tablespoon of red pepper flakes is way to much.  I cut it back to about a teaspoon and it still killed the recipe.  I would put in a half teaspoon the next time.

Super flavor. Super easy. Just right spice... enough that I appreciated the avocado and even ate a little cheese on the side, but not so much that my mouth was on fire or anything. A couple minor tweaks for what I had on hand: banana pepper in place of jalapeno pepper, lemon juice in place of lime juice. I will make again.

Only change I made was to lighten up the heat factor a bit (less red pepper flakes, less chili powder). It's a very tasty side dish served with grilled lime/tequila marinated shrimp (or chicken), carne asada etc.  Definitely a keeper!  Served with sliced avocados, sliced tomatoes, fresh cilantro, and greek yogurt (instead of sour cream).  A winner!

I added ground beef to the recipe and did not include red pepper flakes or cilantro. The dish was delicious and it made me look like I know what I’m doing in the kitchen! ?? I cooked the leftovers with scrambled eggs for breakfast burritos in the morning. I received lots of compliments.

This recipe was SO quick and easy and was packed with protein. I love things spicy but left out the cumin and only did half of the pepper flakes and it was barley spicy at all. My family loved it! We tried it several ways, over mashed potatoes, by itself, and as a dip. I would have liked to know what the serving size was though, i figured about 4 servings but if someone could let me know I’d appreciate it!

I was searching for a healthy main dish with flavor.  My husband loves spicy food and this filled the bill.  We love this dish!  I'm going to use the leftovers for making up some frozen burritos.

I made this on Sunday after a very busy weekend and it took no time at all. I used a cherry bomb pepper instead and this is a great recipe with the blend of flavours. Definitely a keeper

I loved it!  Next time I'll use less than the 1T red pepper flakes since it's pretty spicy, but still edible!  The avocado helps soothe the spicy taste (but I'm super sensitive to spices - someone else might think it's not spicy enough!)  Will definitely make again!   It is even good cold, like a salad.

I kept to the recipe mostly but used dry ingredients instead of fresh and also mixed in some hot salsa to spice it up a bit - that really added a lot of flavor.

Just be careful when sauteing the jalapeno! It released the oils into the air a little bit and my whole family was coughing...BUT it was delicious!

Excellent! My youngest was a little unsure about the texture, but everyone else loved it. My wife hardly ever eats left-overs (usually, my exclusive honor) , but this was an exception. Making it again soon!

This recipe is very tasty. I added hamburger (about a pound) and served it with crescent rolls. It is a little spicy but oh so yummy.

This was SO yummy!  I made these adjustments to prevent smoke from coming out our ears: I used a whole jalapeno but discarded all seeds and most of the pith, I used 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp chili powder, and added 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder.  I used tomatoes from the garden and added a dash of liquid smoke to come nearer to "fire roasted" tomatoes.  Last change was that I used the InstantPot; sauteed as directed, then added everything but the cilantro, lime juice, and avocado.  Used Manual for 1 minute, then 10 minutes on "keep warm" pressure release.  Stirred in the rest and delighted the family with it!

Easy, tasty, good.  Good ratios of ingredients.  Best to add avacado and cilantro at time of serving when using it as leftover.  Will make it again.

This was an amazing dish, I loved the flavors but my wife thought it was a little to spicy for her taste so she added some blue-cheese dip (for chicken wings / vegetables) to tone down the spiciness, which she said worked just fine and added just a little more flavor.

I made this tonight. It was really good. I did have to change a little bit. I didn't put red peppers, jalapeno  peppers, cumin, lime, or cilantro in it. Peppers are hard on my stomach. I also used regular diced tomatoes, instead of fire roasted. I doubled the recipe and then discovered that I only had one cup of quinoa, so I used a cup of rice to double it. I really liked it. The avocado was a nice touch. I love avocados.

A delicious recipe, one that I will definitely make again. I did add another avocado, which worked well.  I read a review that mentioned shrimp, so I also added shrimp, sautéed with garlic and lime to the top of the dish. Absolutely loved it.

I was looking for quick vegan meals and found this. Super easy, super quick, super flavorful. I didn’t put as much of the red pepper flakes (based on other reviews) and it was still spicy. I happen to love spicy food. It was just the right amount of spicy and it was a hit with the family. Will be making this on my tired days.

My family requests this again, and again, and again. It keeps extremely well, and can be reheated or eaten cold. We glob on sour cream, shredded cheese, hot sauce, and sometimes salsa. You just can't go wrong!

We love quinoa, but after eating it plain a few times it gets very old very fast. Made this recipe exactly as it is and it was PERFECT! Super yummy and a great twist for quinoa.

We really enjoyed the flavors in this dish. I didnt have an avocado or lime on hand, but it still tasted great. I also reduced the amount of red pepper flakes to about 1/2 teaspoon to minimize the heat. Adding meat can easily change this side dish into a main dish.

very good!!  I normally don't do hot stuff but I left out the jalapenos and it has the perfect amount of heat.  I ended up using more chicken stock though.  very good dish!

I found the recipe easy to follow, delicious & filling. Great for my diet as I get lots of protein without lots of fat and carbs. I didn't have any avocado or cilantro and it still tasted great. I did sub in homemade taco seasoning for the spices.

My daughter and I loved it! I added some cooked chicken and left out the red pepper flakes because my family isn't as "spicy" as I am. Still, it had some zing to it and I added the red pepper at the table on my own dish. Unfortunately, my wife wasn't crazy about it,  and my son didn't like it, so I don't know if I'll be making it again. That's why I only gave 4 stars. Still, in my book, this is a winner!

Really liked this but I did cut the heat. Used plain diced tomatoes and about 3 oz diced jalapenos, same amounts of everything else. Very tasty and looking forward to leftovers- maybe loaded nachos!

This is a five star recipe once you make the changes other reviewers have suggested. I cut the heat down to 1teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder (this was the perfect amount of heat in my opinion ) . I used vegetable broth (we are vegetarians). I also did not use a jalapeno and just used a can of Rotel. With these changes this recipe is excellent!

Usually try to make a recipe exactly as written the first time but after reading reviews, made one minor change. Added 2 tsp of red pepper flakes instead of 1 Tbs. Was still very spicy so I mixed in sour cream and topped it with cheddar cheese. Was delicious! Will definitely make again.

Great recipe.  Altered somewhat.  Don't use 1 tablespoon of red pepper flacks - use just a pinch.  Also don't use jalapeno pepper.  Use canned tomatoes with green chilis.  Great to make up and take for lunch everyday.

This has quickly become a family standard as a side dish as it contains so many healthy veggies and the quinoa is a great carb!  Tonight I'm trying it with some sautéed ground chicken to make it a one-skillet main meal.

This was delicious. I used to make quinoa all of the time, so I was a little skeptical when it said to use only 1 cup of broth for 1 cup of quinoa, but I tried it anyway. While it was cooking, I had to keep adding broth because a lot of the quinoa wouldn't cook. So next time I'm going to stick with 2 cups of broth to 1 cup of quinoa ratio. When serving I added shredded cheese and sour cream. So good!

This was AMAZING. I left out the spice since we had toddlers eating it, but my husband put hot sauce in at the end and loved it. This is easily coming into our weekly rotation! We did add cooked onions and plan on adding some red and green peppers next time. Don't skimp on the lime!

Yum...this was so good. I only made a couple of changes that I saw others suggest. I added Rotel instead of canned tomatoes. I also decreased the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon and it seemed spicy enough.  My avocado wasn't ripe so I sadly left that out. Overall this was a great recipe to add to my rotation.

Super easy to make and love that I can make it in one skillet! The only change I made was half-ing the red pepper for my kid's but I could have eaten it with the full amount, but, we like spicy things.

Easy and delicious! I would cut some of the spices down if feeding young kids. You can always add the crushed red pepper for the adults bowls after serving the kids.

I make this more often than any other dish for my husband and I. It's so easy and it's really hearty even though there is no meat. Plus, it's so healthy and flavorful, it's got just the perfect amount of spice. Great for potlucks, too!

If made with full cup of quinoa, it makes way more than 4 servings!  Last time I made it, I cut back to just over 1/2 cup quinoa and 1/2 cup broth.

This recipe is great! I have the pickiest kids EVER that do not like trying new things and they loved it! Rather than diced avocado, I just mixed in  guacamole and then they can't even see the green. I also used vegetable broth rather than chicken. This will definitely become a staple! Thanks for sharing!

Great dish, and easy.  Can be eaten with greens as a salad, or in tacos or burritos, or plain.  We have enjoyed it all of these ways.  Great for a quick dinner or side dish.

I took the suggestions of others and cut back on the amount of red pepper flakes. With that adjustment the heat was good. And I thought the dish overall was good, but I think next time I'll add more cilantro and avocado, because I love them.

This has become my daughter's favorite recipe for me to make!  We did learn after the first time to only put in the jalapeno and scrap the red pepper flakes!!  I have also started adding cooked, shredded chicken breast with some taco seasoning just to make it a complete meal.

Fantastic! Made as described except minus the red pepper flakes. This recipe turned me on to quinoa. one thing I will note is that I has to let it boil for about a minute in order for the quinoa to open (for lack of a better word). The first time I made this the long boil time was due to me also juggling mommy duties while cooking.  The second time I reduced heat as soon as it turned to boil and the quinoa didn't open -suspecting the problem I brought it back to a boil, gave it at least a minute, then reduced heat again.  Dinner was about 20 minutes behind schedule but still delicious. Even the 18 month old loves this dish! Fast, easy, and healthy for unsuspecting youths!

I mixed  this up a bit.  I sauteed onions with the garlic, added adobo instead of jalapenos.  Added a sweet potato, chicken and kale.  Omitted the red pepper flakes as adobo is hot.  It was fabulous !  A quick go to meal!

I have made this many times and it is always a hit.  There's not a thing that I would change except to add a little more chopped cilantro on top before serving.  So good!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe and easy to make. I agree with the other reviews - take it easy on the spicy ingredients and add them later to taste. My kids enjoy eating this dish with tortilla chips. I've also topped this dish with sauteed shrimp and chicken. Delicious!

I doubled the recipe because there are two cups of corn in a can and two cups of broth in a can; the recipe calls for one cup of each.  I think the next time I make this I'll add a pound or so of chicken.

Excellent! I had to make a couple substitutions, based on what I had on hand. Used a can of green chiles rather than the jalepeno, and had plain crushed tomatoes rather than fire-roasted. I also made guacamole with the avacado rather than stirring it in diced. Turned out amazing! I turned it into a casserole by layering some tamales (cut-in-half-lengthwise), leftover pulled pork, then the quinoa. After a quick bake I  topped with some cheese, the cilantro and sour cream. Ended up eating the guac on the side. My husband asked me to make sure to keep the recipe, the best kind of review he gives, and I agree! :-)

this was very tasty! we like spicy food so I wasn't too concerned with other reviewers comments that it was too spicy. I followed the recipe exactly, except we had canned jalapeños instead of fresh and when estimating how much to use I cut way too much and so ended up with a double amount! It was spicy!! But we loved it, especially with corn chips. Next time though I'll try not to double the jalapeños!

Updating my review because we make this dish all the time! The recipe as-is is great, but my husband and I have fiddled with it and found our favorite modifications. Nothing fancy, but I swap out the chili powder, red pepper flakes, and jalapeños for a few de-seeded canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Then I spoon in some of the adobo sauce from the can, tasting as I go to make sure I don't overdo it. Serve with a dollop of sour cream

It was such an easy meal to make and everyone loved it.  I added more cilantro than the recipe calls for and reduced the red pepper flakes down to 1/2 tsp because my family can't handle that much heat.

I served it with Mission corn chips for a fun Saturday night dinner.

I will make this again and put it into the regular rotation of recipes.

A really quick and easy recipe to prepare! I used 1/2 a diced chipotle pepper instead and added a tad more chill powder. Omitted the red pepper flakes. Added some leftover chicken to help use it up. Added shredded tex mex cheese because you really can't go wrong with cheese.  Didn't have an avocado or any cilantro unfortunately but it was still delicious!

This was way too spicy! I made it while my mom was over for dinner and I felt bad because it was too spicy for her.  I would definitely cut back 1/2 on the chili flakes and maybe go easier on the chili powder which came on too strong too. I think I'll love it next time. Easy to make.

This was Awesome! I used a rather large jalapeno pepper so I knew to use about 2 tsp  of the crushed red pepper- it was perfect- just the right enough heat for my Hubby and me. He loved it and said I could make this any day of the week- not just on meatless Monday. Thank you for sharing!

amazing... easy and a perfect dinner.  Even my husband liked it.  I think we will add a bit of ground beef next time - he wasn't 100% satisfied - but we did add a bit of shredded cheese and some sour cream.  YUMMY.

A very easy and tasty dish. I served this for company last night - they each had 2 servings. As others suggested, I used only 1 1/2 T red pepper flakes, although  I do like heat.This was enough, but next time I may increase to 2 tsps. One note of caution: this makes a  LOT (5 servings last night and have another 5 servings left) and, unlike many one dish meals, is not as good the second time around.  Next time will make smaller amount

very easy, fairly quick and soooo good. A new favorite at our house.  Added some leftover grilled chicken and it was awesome. I imagine it is still great without it.

Delightfully delicious and easy!  I used Mexican spiced canned beans, corn and tomatoes, which were spicy enough that I  could omit the jalapeno, which I didn't have on hand.

I loved this recipe! It was a little spicy, but I still enjoyed it. I think the spice overload was my fault, so I'm giving this 5 stars. I made it with corn tortillas and everyone loved it!!

I really liked this dish, but I'm giving 4 stars because it was way too spicy as written, especially for kids.  But it is versatile, and I've used and modified it in a wide variety of dishes - used either vegetable broth or mushroom stock for a vegetarian dish, added grilled chicken for a heartier meal, stuffed it into taco shells, rolled it up into enchiladas (omitted the avocado), just to name a few.  I'm not a huge fan of black beans, so I've substituted navy beans, lentils, and split peas (the split peas weren't the best idea), and I've used fresh Roma tomatoes when they are in season.  I halved the spice level in the recipe, and I still found it a little too hot so I reduced it a little further.  I think it depends on how hot the jalapeños are, so you just have to taste each one while cutting them up. My daughter thought it was perfect, but my son said it was too spicy for him to eat.

This is very good and I am already thinking of a variety of ways to use the basic mix - in tacos, and stuffed peppers are two that have come to mind.  My pantry is overfull so I have stopped "stocking up" and found I was out of essentials - no black beans (!!) and only 3/4 c of quinoa  - but I used refried black beans, and a little less liquid and it was fine (I'm sure it would have been better with whole beans).  I did not use that much spice - or the jalapeno.  I used enough chili powder and cumin to give it a nice flavor, but not overpower it.  I served it as a main dish and while it wasn't a pretty bowl of food,  it was delicious and filling.   With sliced tomatoes sprinkled with balsamic vinegar on the side we were happy with our light dinner.

This made for a very nice meatless main dish one evening when I need something quick and easy.  Most of the ingredients were in the pantry.  I was worried about a possible "Quinoa?...euww" reaction, but the responses were overwhelmingly positive.  I had the leftovers for lunch the next day, and they were great.  Will definitely make it again.
I did subtract just one star, as made it was a little bland for us...I did not have any Sriracha sauce handy.

Seeded the  jalapeño, used just a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and Rotel tomatoes and then everything else was the same. Still too hot for me but I loved the flavor. I will make again  but maybe cut out all or the red pepper flakes or jalapeño .
I cooled it down with some shredded cheese.
When I make it for my SO I'll grill some shrimp in the garlic and lime like someone else did.
Super easy and quick to fix for dinner.

This was my first attempt at making quinoa. It was actually delicious & I'd make again for sure.  My somewhat picky 16 yo son who doesn't like beans passed on it,  but my mom, husband & myself all loved it. I didn't have cumin so left it out. And I wasn't sure if I should include jalapeño seeds.  I omitted them based on previous reviews of it being spicy. I like spicey &  thought it was perfect amount of spice.

This was excellent and full of flavor. I made a few changes to the recipe based on what I had in the pantry and refrigerator.  I didn't have any quinoa so used rice instead.  I also added slices of cheese to the top and just let it melt while the whole pan was on the stove (cheese makes everything better right?). It was also great as leftovers with an egg on top!

I made this for 'Meatless Monday' and we loved it.  I did add a bit more garlic and some onion, which I cooked until softened. I used salsa instead of tomatoes, and added 1/2 of a leftover tomato, as that is what I had handy.   Used less cumin (not a fan) and 1/2 tsp red pepper.   Very forgiving, very delicious and healthy recipe!  We're using the leftovers for Taco Tuesday tonight!  We're trying to eat less meat, and this is definitely going to be a keeper!

Made this last night and it came out great!  I did not do the avocado as I don't like either, but the dish came out amazing!  I used stewed tomatoes instead.  I baked chicken, cut that up and added it to the dish to make a meal out of it.  Let the chicken cook in the dish with the quinoa to take on the flavor.  The lime and cilantro at the end really bring the dish together.

Left out all the hot stuff and added seasoned ground beef (just a little that was leftover from another meal) and black olives. My whole family (even picky kids) loved it! I may try adding sauteed Mahi or shrimp next time. So easy! It's ready before you know it!

I made a few changes based on what I had.  Instead of a pepper I used a can of Rotel tomatoes, instead of fire roasted tomatoes I used regular diced tomatoes (no, it wasn't too tomatoey) , no red pepper flakes, no lime, no avocado, no cilantro and it was fabulous.  It had plenty of spice for me but the red pepper flakes can be easily added later.  Yes, I made some changes but it's great base recipe  that can be easily adjusted for taste.

We forgot to get jalapeño peppers.  We used 4oz can of Ortega diced green chiles (mild) we had.  Followed rest of recipe as is.  Wife and I loved to.  Will be making this again.

Awesome flavor, even without the jalapeno. I had to cut back on the spiciness so used canned green chilies instead.  So easy and yummy. The hardest part is opening up the cans!!  Keeping this one!

It had a lot of fire as is. Depending on your crew you may want to reduce jalapeño or red pepper just a bit. Leftovers were great too.

The tablespoon of red chili flakes was too much, wondering if it wasn't supposed to be 1 tsp, which would still be a healthy dose. This recipe was incredibly easy to make, and clean up afterwards. I will definitely put this into my monthly rotation. 2 thumbs up.

This received and immediate "make this again" from the family. Super easy to throw together. I cut the red pepper flakes in 1/2 because I was worried about the heat. I will do the full TBSP next time just for the added heat. I did use two avocado's just because we love them.

I made this for a monthly pot luck--everyone liked it.  I did not use the jalapeño but substituted canned diced chilis instead.  I increased the garlic and used a few shakes of Frank's Red Hot in place of the 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes which I felt would make this dish way too hot.  Feedback from the group was that it was just the right amount of spice.  I would make it again and probably serve it with grated cheese and sour cream as garnishes.

I made it as suggested. The only difference I made was to cover the skillet while simmering to allow the quinoa to cook enough before all the liquid evaporated. It turned out great. Definitely will do again.

I didn't deviate from the recipe except I used a half of a serrano pepper instead of the jalapeño pepper because I lost the jalapeño somewhere between the grocery store and home. The dish was a little too spicy for me so I added some additional avocado and some sour cream and it was perfect.

This was great - I actually made it 2 days in a row my family liked it so much.  Fill taco shells with it - really tasty.  Watch the heat though...TB of red pepper flakes is a bunch.  I dropped it to a ts and it was still too hot for my wife...

I invited husband (carnivore)) and son (vegan) for lunch.  Both loved  the  very colorful and nutritious lunch  My vegan son was  very happy  to  get out of his bed at Noon  and be invited to start his day with  a  very energetic  bowl and iin my eyes a perfectly balanced meal.  

Made a small  change:  Added  miniature  red tomatoes  and  baby cucumbers  just to add a little more vegetables and to add a little more color to the salad.
GREAT  SATISFYING MEAL.  EASY  AND QUICK TO PREPARE .

Great tasting easy dish.  One needs to like things pretty hot to use the recipe as is.  For less fire, using green chiles instead of jalapeno and cutting down on the red pepper flakes works well.  The salt level is very unhealthy and not necessary.  Just use salt free canned black beans, canned chopped tomatoes, and ckicken broth along with the salt in the recipe.  Great with a little sour cream on top.  One could easily add some sausage, chicken, or shrimp if wishing to not go vegetarian.

This was a fantastic meal and very filling! We added a touch of sour cream, the spices were perfect! We love spicy so the crushed red pepped is great for us but might be too much for others.

Very easy recipe, I would make it again. I omitted the chili powder, and pepper flakes because the jalapeno was enough heat for my family. At the end, I place the sliced avocado and cilantro on top with a  dollop of sour cream. Very yummy!

This was very good, but I agree with another reviewer that it was way too hot.  I added an additional can of black beans and some cooked cauliflower rice trying to tone it down a little. 
As suggested by another reviewer, I added shrimp to the dish. 
I will make this again, but with the modifications to cut some of the heat.

Good as a side dish,  Could add pieces of cooked chicken or flavored sausage for main meal.  I used frozen combination of corn and black beans.

Tasted great.  The directions call for a can of corn but it doesn't say whether to drain it or not.  I drained it but added more liquid back so next time I make it, I'll use the can with all the liquid.  Delicious.

We made as directed  except we used red quinoa and put in a little more cumin and paprika and a pinch of brown sugar, also a couple of squeezes of fresh lime and lemon juice. And I used vegetable broth. It was so delicious with the avacodo and tomato on top!

This is delicious! Easy and quick. We only used 1/2 T red pepper flakes, but that's only because my husband buys extra hot red pepper flakes. We will make this again and again! Thanks for the recipe.

Based on reviews and my own preferences I used one canned chipotle pepper, just a sprinkle of crushed dry red pepper, 1/2 a tsp of chili powder for the heat and a full tsp. of cumin.  Also added an extra can of mild seasoned chili beans.  We loved it and will make again.

Easy to make and very tasty.  Added scallions and put a dollop of guacamole as a garnish on top because my avocados weren't ripe.  Added chicken which was really good.  Will add shrimp next time.  Fresh lime juice/cilantro/avocado neutralize the flavor.  Without those it might be on the spicy side.  Kids liked it with shredded cheddar on top.

This went together really quickly.  I did cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half and added some cooked cubed chicken to add some protein.  I'll make this again,  it's a keeper!

While I did revise the heat level, I loved this recipe. Easy to make and I  have been looking for recipes incorporating quinoa. I did not use a jalepano,  I cut the red pepper flakes back by a third, the cumin and the chili seasoning I cut in half and it was STILL spicy enough.  took a cue from a couple of other reviewers and grated some cheddar on top...yum!  So happy I have leftovers :o)

Made it as is and got rave reviews from the family. Super easy to adjust spice level to your preference. Used frozen tomatoes from my freezer. Added shredded cheese on top when I served it. Yum!

Loved the ease of this recipe - and tastes great, too! I did back off on the red pepper flakes - still plenty of heat for taste! Will certainly make this one again.

I added some shredded chicken for the last ten minutes of simmering. Other than that stuck to the recipe and it was amazing.  Even better after two days in the fridge

I made this just as the recipe instructed, except for the corn which I didn't have on hand. It was good, but a bit too much tomato for my taste.

Absolutely delish and easy!  I seeded my jalapeno and only put a dash of red pepper flakes and it was spicy enough.  I'd say do a taste test to see if you want to add more  spice  before serving depending on your preferences and the "hotness" of the jalapeno (I've had variances).  
It was perfect for a filling for warmed tortillas.  We just added some lettuce and sour cream.  Yum!!!!  Will for sure keep this one.

This was excellent, but like another reviewer, the 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes was a bit much, even for a family that likes spicy food.  I reduced it to 2 teaspoons for this batch, and will likely use 1 teaspoon when I make this again.  But this is definitely a keeper!

I have made a dish exactly like this but it is not one skillet. This was so much easier. I used Rotel instead of fire roasted tomatoes. I will leave out the jalapeño next time just because my husbands not crazy about jalapeños (I love them though). I made this and added the spicy grilled shrimp recipe I found on here. I just grilled the shrimp and put them on top of the dish. I put mine in a whole wheat tortilla with some sour cream and spinach and made more of a taco. Everyone else ate it in the bowl. It was a big heat. I also didn't mix the avocado in I just sliced it and let everyone put on their own.

I only used half the chili flakes, and I will only use half the lime juice next time. I also threw in some left over potatoes and spinach from last nights dinner. I also used up some of my disastrous homemade salsa instead of the canned tomatoes.     I used corn,  cut from the cob.  I love how left overs can be turned into a totally different meal. And it all went together very well. It will probably taste better cold tomorrow.

This was very easy and delicious. I started with frying an onion and used a packet of taco mix  with the cumin, which made the seasoning perfect. Kids loved it so much they took a second serving.

We loved this one. I made two changes...I knew the jalapeno I had was quite hot, so I cut the red pepper flakes back to about a teaspoon. I also added ground chicken, browned it in a separate pan & added part way thru the simmering step.

Good for weekday evening.  I did choose to  brown ground chicken and added extra spices. We like it hot.  It's a very good recipe to adapt to your family tastes.  And yes I would definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy, very delicious. I too cut back on the red pepper but this recipe was easy fast and very very good.  Put it on a bed of lettuce. Cut a few tomatoes, topped with dolup of Greek yogurt. Perfect for our meatless Monday's.

Really good - I didn't have corn but added in a can of chickpeas instead. I also didn't have a jalapeño pepper and based on the other reviews I didn't feel bad about not using it so as to keep the heat down. It was still very hot so added in juice of one extra lime and that helped. Oh also - I only had a quinoa/wild rice blend so used that instead. Would def make this again - delicious and nutritious. Only reason for the 4 stars was the heat.

I will definitely make this again. It is quick and healthy! We added shredded chicken and a bit more red pepper flakes than called for, just for a little extra kick. I think it would be great with chorizo or pulled pork as well.

Yes I have already made it several times. It is good leftover and also good topped with a fried or poached egg for breakfast.
I increase the jalapeños to 2 or 3 and omit chilli powder, hot pepper flakes and cumin.

So easy and so good.  I did take mine out before I added all that crushed red pepper, but my family liked it as written.
I made this again,  adding ground beef browned with an onion.  It was even better than the original.  I still plan to try another reviewer's suggestion of adding shrimp in the future.

So good! I made exactly as directed, except I didn't have a jalapeño so I put in pinch of jalapeño powder in instead. I didn't think it was too spicy, but we are Texans :)

This is quick, easy, uses ingredients you probably have on hand, and is pretty much a one pot meal. Plus it's healthy and makes great leftovers! What else can you ask for? This will be a regular meal in my house.

Delicious!  I added grilled chicken to the recipe and this is now one of our favorite go-to meals!  I've also swapped out the corn for other vegetables depending on what I have in the pantry/freezer to change things up.  The leftovers are just as good, if not better, so my husband and I both have our lunch covered for the next day.

I did change the recipe a little based on our preferences and what I had at home. Instead of corn I added garbanzo beans. I also wanted to keep it vegetarian so I used veggie broth.  Also I didn't have any avocados so I just omitted that. Kids all loved it! Next day we put it in a tortilla with lettuce, cheese or sour cream and tomatoes. They loved it even more!

Loved it. Easy to make with canned corn, tomatoes and beans. While I loved the spice my guests found it a bit much.

Absolutely great flavors!  I like the ease of serving this as a main dish for vegetarian friends or as a side dish to compliment a grilled steak or chicken.
