Delicious and easy.  I did make a few additions so that I might sneak in a few veggies.  I sauteed some green pepper, onion, celery, mushrooms, and garlic in the drippings from the chicken.  Then added the diced chicken to the veggies and sauteed them together for about 2 minutes then added a little salt and pepper  to the chicken and veggies.  Once I was tossing all those ingredients together, I also added some diced pimentos.  Tasted very flavorful and cheezy-my son 2 1/2 year old loved it-especially the noodles.

Excellent -- one of my fave AR recipes, BUT two things: the transfer from AR's old format left out that one of the Cheez Whiz jars should be "Salsa" or "Mexican" flavor.  Plus, if you use just 8 oz. of spaghetti you'll end up with tons of sauce, so I use either 12 oz. or even 16 oz.  I also add 1 tsp. garlic powder - makes it even tastier!

I'm doing dinner solo tonight.  Hubby is at a business dinner.  I love chicken spaghetti but didn't feel like making chicken or cutting up a lot of veggies, so I made this instead.  I used plain velvetta since that's all I had and dumped in some Ragu spaghetti sauce.  It was a great combination of flavors and I'm sure would have tasted great with some chicken and vegetables..had I been in the mood.  It was quick and inexpensive so I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks Dianne.

YUM!  Made Dianne's way and also substituted Cream of Mushroom soup for 1 can of chicken soup.  We like it both ways.  Thank you Dianne... you're a sweetie!

I needed a quick & easy recipe for supper last night to fill us up before we went bowling. I came across this. Not only was it simple but it was very tasty. First, I agree with a previous reviewer regarding the noodles-you need more! I used 12oz but next time I'll use 16oz. Also, I didn't have cheese whiz so I melted Velveeta and added 1/3 cup salsa to it once it was melted to achieve a close replica of the mexican cheez whiz the submitter had intended. Finally, I followed the advice to add some veggies and quick-fry them in the pan I had cooked the chicken (broccoli, celery, mushrooms) and added a jar of diced pimentos. The result was very good! Would make this again! Thanks Dianne!

I tried this last night and my family did not enjoy it at all.  I used 1 pound of spaghetti instead of what the recipe called for.  The mixture of the soup and the cheese was just too much.  Too bland, too cheesy........sorry, was not a hit at my house.

This is a very good recipe. I used mexican velveeta with kraft cheese sauce. But kept the rest the same except add brocolli. My child will not eat spagetti or brocolli but with this recipe he loves it..Definetly, a kids food... Thank you so much will make often.

I used 1 can cream of chicken, 3 chicken breasts, mild mexican velveeta, 1 can rotel, a touch of salt, pepper, cumin, and 8 ounces of spaghetti. I made 16 oz of noodles because of the other reviews but I think with the one can of condensed soup made the difference. I also boiled the chicken breasts so it would shred easier. I was out of fresh mushrooms but added a can I had in the cupboard. I was looking for a recipe where I had ingredients or substitutions on hand so I wouldn't have to go to the grocery store. It is just my hubby and I but this made quite a bit even after I scaled everything down. This recipe is a keeper. thanks Tammy

This was delicious.  I took some of the others advice and used 16 ou spaghetti noodles...I used one 15 ou jar regular Cheez Wiz and added a can of mild rotel(we don't do spicy stuff:)to give it the Mexi twist it originally called for. Instead of browning the chicken I boiled it in water with garlic powder. It was just to our liking.  Our 21 month old loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

this is awesome!   my kids & husband enjoyed this so I will adding this to my standard menus.  I did make a few adjustments --  used Velveta cheese & also added 1/2 can rotel type tomatoes & chilies.   I also started by sauteing 1 green bell pepper with some fresh garlic then added the soup, cheese & then chicken.  I also used 16 oz of spagetti.

Not exactly an accurate review, since I did make quite a few changes. Mixed one jar cheddar cheese pasta sauce, one can cream of chicken soup, chopped spinach, roasted red peppers + 1 TB juice, 1 can petite diced tomatoes, oregano, basil, garlic powder, parmesan cheese. Added cubed cooked chicken. Tossed with whole wheat pasta. Transferred to 9x13 baking dish and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. Delicious. This recipe can easily be modified to taste or ingredients on hand. Family loved it.

Because this recipe is easy, I really wanted to like it, but my family and I weren't impressed. After reading the reviews here, I used 16 oz of spaghetti but even that didn't help. It didn't make anyone hurl but nobody ate more than a couple bites. It was just a big gloppy mess. I threw most of it away.
