Love this salad! I didn't change anything (except the brand of dressing...couldn't find the kind it called for) It was very flavorful, maybe not the healthiest salad, but definitely one of the tastiest.

I made one batch with the asiago peppercorn and one with balsamic vinegarette... simply delightful. Everyone thinks I'm a genius and it only took 30 minutes!

I added marinated artichoke hearts to mine and everyone raved about this recipe.  Will make it again.

This salad is amazing!  It makes far more than 6 servings though.  Just served it for dinner tonight and everyone was blown away.  This will become a summer "staple" salad.

Wonderful recipe! I did change the penne to tortellini and used black olives instead of the kalamata. I also added green onions from my garden and used a rotissere chicken for ease. Thanks!

Couldn't find asiago peppercorn dressing either. I used parmesan dressing. I think it would be better with tortellini if served as a main course but a keeper nontheless.

My family loved this meal.
I am finding that sun dried tomatoes sound wonderful, I don't care for them.  Did not stop the family from getting seconds.

My husband really liked this dish, but I just thought it was okay. I tend to like more of the citrusy dressings rather than the creamy type. The flavors were great, but it was just a little more filling than I like.
