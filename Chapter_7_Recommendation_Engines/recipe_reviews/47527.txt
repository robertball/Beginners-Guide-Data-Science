I found I needed to make a few modifications to this recipe to get the result I was after.  With the changes it was very good.  Here's what I did differently.  I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground italian sausage.  I cooked this first then removed it from the pan, draining ALL the grease.  Then I cooked the onion and garlic (omitted bell pepper) in just a little olive oil, added back the meat and added flour.  We don't like a chunky sauce so I used a 29 oz. can plus a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and omitted the chopped tomatoes.  I added spices and wine as written but substituted fresh ground black pepper for the cayenne.  I found that after simmering for a couple of hours it was just too thick for our taste so I added about 1 cup of water to get a nice consistency.  Be sure to stir often or sauce on the bottom will char and it could ruin the whole pot of sauce.  Thinning the sauce out a bit helps avoid this also.  I recommend omitting the regular salt altogether or at least wait till the very end and only add as much as needed.  Also, taste at the end and if too acid add a bit more sugar and 1 or 2 Tbsp. butter.  Both of these things help cut the acid.  I used half for spaghetti and froze the rest to use another day.

This is the first time I've ever made homemade spaghetti sauce and this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I made it for a church gathering and within minutes, not only was it gone, but people were asking me for the recipe.  I tweaked the recipe based other other reviewers' recommendations: I used only 2 T of olive oil, 1 onion, a 29 oz can of tomato sauce, only 1/2 t. of cayenne and it was perfect for my taste.  I also drained the fat before I added the flour.  It took 3 hours to simmer and a little chopping, but other than that, it was simple and well-worth the extra wait.  "Arriverderci!" to Ragu and Prego.

Oh my goodness, I used to have this recipe years ago and lost it. How awesome to find it here. I could never remember the ingredients. It's a wonderful recipe. I always added bacon into my sauce. It added a nice flavor. The worchestershire sauce gives this recipe a fantastic flavor.

I have tried several times to make my own sauce....never liked any of them.  I don't like sauces that are too tangy or too sweet...this one was soooooo perfect.  I didn't change anything as I like to try recipes the way they are the first time and tweak them later.  However, this recipe, in my opinion, needs no tweaking.  Also, I have tried several recipes from this website but this was the first one I felt deserved reviewed!  Thank you Shelley for a great red sauce recipe!!!

Excellent!  My husband    loves this recipe.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and used brown sugar instead of white. I will no longer buy spaghetti sauce.  This is it.

This was a good sauce. I put it in the slowcooker for 4 hours on low and even my picky eater wolfed it back without any complaint. Next time I will use another red wine tho. I tasted the wine after I made the sauce and found that I really didn't like it. I will have to find a red wine that I like and try it again.

The only thing that prevented this from getting "5 stars" was the cayenne....I like spice, but not in spaghetti sauce.  We've made it several times now without the cayenne & love it like that.

I did a 6 person serving and it was still enough for an army.  This was pretty good.  I cut the wine down to 6 TBS for a 6 person serving because in my XP too much wine is not a good thing.  I also only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne.  Children do not like cayenne.  The worcestershire was a pretty good add-in.  I also would recommend making it with Roma tomatoes over any other tomatoes unless you have fresh garden tomatoes.  The recipe didn't specify a certain type.  Overall, I'd make it again.

This sauce was too spicey and greasy.  My kids wouldn't eat it.  It does have potential...maybe decrease the oil...omit the cayanne....????

Very good! I didn't add the celery salt or salt since the tomato products I used had so much sodium content already and my hubby is on meds for high blood pressure. I didn't use the olive oil either since the meat was rather fat. I drained the fat off after browning the meat and prior to adding the other ingredients. My family enjoyed this. Thanks for the post!

Excellent recipe!!  I added extra onions and peppers and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion instead of fresh tomatoes.  The flavor was excellent and I ended up with a huge amount of sauce--at least 3 meals worth for my family of 6--so I froze half.  This is a definite keeper for us.

This sauce is fantastic.  I did make several modifications though.  I used 1 1/2 cups of red wine, a 29 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the 2 cups of sauce and fresh tomatoes, 1 onion, and 1/2 t of cayenne pepper.  I also used ground turkey (1.5 lb) instead of ground beef.  I browned the turkey, onions, and garlic, added the flour and then put it into a crock pot with the remaining ingredients and cooked for 3 hours on low.   Yum!!

I wanted to tackle the task of making homemade spaghetti sauce so I've been searching for the perfect sauce recipe and I think I've found it in this one (with a few changes). Here's what I did - decreased olive oil to 3 T, omitted green pepper (don't like), sub'd beef broth for red wine, sub'd 2 cans Italian diced tomatoes (undrained) for fresh, use 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes for cayenne (we don't like spicy food), and decreased mushrooms by half. I also sometimes omit the ground beef and add 2 pkgs. (12 oz) of frozen meatballs. Then, after sauteing the meat (if using), garlic, and onions I cook the rest of the time in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours and add the mushrooms for 15 minutes before serving. Turns out great every time.

we love this recipe and i usually cook with the wine, it does add a special flavor. for those who dont like the wine, you can substitute 2 TBS of balsamic vinegar for each half cup of wine.

The best recipe I've found so far!  I added 4 finely shredded carrots and changed the meat to half pork and half beef (What I had on hand).  Like another reviewer, I also don't like tomato chunks in my sauce.  I chose to use 29 ounces of crushed tomatoes instead of just adding more tomato sauce.  It has more body.  I used brown sugar as recommended by a different reviewer.  I would reduce the amount of sugar by half next time because the carrots really added a lot of sweetness.  I had no problems with an overly wine-y flavor.  Maybe the secret is to add the wine first and separately, to give the alcohol a chance to evaporate before adding the other liquids.  I simmered for the minimum amount of time and the flavors were well blended and delicious.

I would give this recipe a -10 if I could.  I followed the recipe except I drained the fat before I added the flour.  I bought my favorite bottle of dry red wine.  I could not even doctor it up so that I could keep it.  I have made lots of homade spagetti sauces and this was by far the worst.  Maybe leaving out the wine would have helped - not sure..

Very flavorful and rich sauce! I eliminated the olive oil entirely and sauteed the garlic and onion with the meat after I drained the meat. The longer it simmers, the better the flavor. Used as a spaghetti sauce and made a lasagna with remaining sauce. Excellent!!!!

I made this for our weekly church potluck and everyone said it was delicious.  I wasn't sure about draining the meat or not, so I didn't and it wasn't oily like I feared it might be.  All I changed was not adding the cayenne pepper (I didn't have any).  I will do it with next time though.  Great recipe...Thanks.

We really enjoyed this recipe, my only complaint was that it had way to much cayenne pepper, which overtook the flavor.  Next time I will greatly reduce it and it will be great.  Thanks

This was a good sauce.  I would not classify it as great in my opinion.  It tasted like it needed additional salt when I served it...a  tiny bit bland.  I like that it was so meaty though.

i thought it was ok. i wasnt able to simmer the sauce for 3 hours so after about an hour of simmering, the beef still didn't have much flavor in it. i followed the recipe to the T but had to add garlic salt for taste. i thought this recipe was ok. by adding the 2/3 cup of tomate sauce defeats the purpose of trying to make it "homemade".

This is a great base sauce, but I did make some changes.  I used 1 lb. turkey sausage and 1 1/2 lb. lean ground sirloin.  Used 1-28 oz. can crushed tomatoes and 3 cans diced tomatoes (pureed in blender).  I always add creamy tomato soup to my sauce, and did so with this one (It makes the sauce complete - used 1 microwavable bowl).  Used only 1 small 8 oz. bottle of cabernet and omitted cayenne.  Hard to mess up a good base.  Added Italian seasoning.  It was perfect!!  Will use the rest for the "Baked Ziti III recipe", with ricotta, of course.

I gave it a 5, even though it was too spicy for us. Next time I will leave out the cayanne pepper all together(only used a little) and it will be perfect. I used ground beef, and cooked w/the garlic, onions and olive oil, drained the fat, added the flour, and put everything in a crock pot. Very easy and smelled soooo wonderful.

I've been looking for a great spaghetti sauce recipe for years and this is it!  Like others, I drained the ground beef and I didn't use quite as much olive oil.  I also had to use canned tomatoes.  But the seasoning was perfectly garlicly and spicy.  thanks for the great recipe!

TOTALLLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
I made this yesterday and put it in my cast iron dutchoven on top my stove and let it simmer for 5 1/2 hours. The longer it simmers, the better it gets! I can only imagine how GREAT it is going to taste when we have it again tonight as left overs.  I used a whole head of garlic as we LOVE garlic and so do the neighbors!  Took it over there and it was a HUGH hit:) The neighbors even wanted the recipe and took part of the left overs for themselves.  DON"T PASS MAKING THIS ONE UP, IT"S A KEEPER!!!!!  I'd give it 10 Stars if I could!!

This recipe was good but a little too thick for me. The taste was pretty good but I will have to play around with it to get it more to my taste.

This was my first time ever making spaghetti sauce from scratch. This was easy and very delicious. I made extra to freeze.

This is a good sauce recipe.  I would decrease the amount of wine next time to 1 1/2 cups.  Otherwise pretty good.

Delicious spaghetti sauce.  I made this recipe 3 times last summer ('11) and froze it in quart freezer bags.  I used all of the ingredients except the tomato paste and mushrooms.  When I thawed the sauce I then added the tomato paste so that it would thicken as it heated.  The sauce is loaded with flavor and we loved the chunks of onion, peppers and tomatoes.  The reasoning for no mushrooms is, we don't care for them.  I served this with garlic bread and 'Green Bean Salad' from this site.  Leftovers for lunch the next day were every bit as good as the night before.  Thanks TUCKER for sharing your recipe.

This is exactly the kind of sauce recipe I've been looking for!  I made it last night and my boyfriend and his friend loved it, as did I.  I'm so happy I found it!  I did alter it a bit, following 'Valerie's Kitchen' advice.  No green peppers or mushrooms, and I cooked the meat, then drained it, then cooked the onion & garlic.  Also replaced a pound of chuck with a pound of spicy italian sausage meat.  Yum!

Really a great recipe! I make a big pot of this and freeze two ladle fulls in each ziploc freezer bag (Makes like 14 bags!) Then for a quick meal for my husband and myself I reheat the sauce, cook the pasta, and dinners served in 15 mins! This recipe really helped us out when my son was born : ) Thanks a lot!

My family loves this recipe and my sister even said its the best spaghetti shes ever tasted.I didnt follow the recipe to a tee though mostly cause i ran out of a few stuff and didnt feel like running to the store. and it still came out great. i used 3 table of olive oil instead of 2, didnt use wine or the large tomatoes.the recipe came together as quite dry so i added 2 cups of water.be careful on the tomato sauce you choose, as some sauces tend to be qute sweet, whihc was what happened in my case.if you buy a sweet tasting sauce, go easy on the sugar (maybe just 1 tablesp).despite mine being a bit sweet, it turned out great for a novice cooker like me.

This was a good sauce.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  Next time I will only use one can of tomato paste.  I think 2 cans leaves too much tomato flavor.  I didn't cook the meat with the sauce.  I added browned homemade meatballs in the last 30 minutes of cooking.  This recipe makes a lot of sauce.  I froze 2 big portions and plan to have meatball subs with the leftovers.

Best red sauce recipe ever!  You could eat it alone, it's that good.  It is spicey, so cut way back on the cayenne pepper if you are sensitive as it does over-power the dish. Husband and kids loved it.  I used just a plain old cooking wine, but will use a nice red wine when I get the chance to find one.  If you omit the ground beef, it's a great base sauce for chili, spagetti, lasagna, etc...  Definitely will make more again and freeze for later.  I added fresh herbs and they tasted awesome.  Used finely chopped canned tomatoes with peppers because I'm lazy and don't like big chunky tomatoes.  Came out really nicely and tasted even better the next day!

Very good recipe, a nice change from my usual spaghetti sauce. I only used about 3 tbsp of olive oil to cook the veggies - 3/4 of a cup would be way too fattening! Like all spaghetti sauces I make, instead of simmering on the stove top, I let it simmer in the oven, partially covered at 325F. Less messy and I don't have to check it every 5 minutes!

OMG!  This is so wonderful.  My mom made it for me when she came to see me while I was pregnant and I couldn't get enough!  Don't be tempted to leave the red wine out, it makes it!  Also- Mom used her homegrown tomatoes which gave it an awesome flavor, but I have made it without and it is still good.  This is perfect because it makes a large amount and leftovers are really good on this one!

When the sauce was newly made I didn't like the strong wine flavor. However, after 3 months in the freezer the flavors melded together just beautifully. This is a wonderful spaghetti sauce. I'll just plan to make it well in advance of using it. The flour turns the sauce into a beautful rich looking suace intead of a a brothy looking sauce. This is truly a very special spaghetti sauce.

Great recipe!  I made some modifications, by leaving out the meat and pureeing the sauce once everything was in the pot.  Added tomato paste to get the deired consistency.  Overall, very tasty and the kids never even suspected any vegetables in the sauce.

I LOVE this recipe.  It is the best sauce I have ever tasted.  I usually make a double batch so I can freeze some.  It thaws out great and the taste isn't comprimisedat all.  I usually throw in a little extra wine and tomato sauce just to give it a little extra juice.

This sauce was okay.  I only used one onion and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  I used very lean ground chuck and there was no need to drain it.  I used fresh basil instead of dry.

This sauce is pretty tasty.  I omitted olive oil, flour, and half the meat.  I used ground round and sausage.  I also slow cooked in crock pot for 4 hours.  This is one of the better spaghetti sauce recipes I've tried, but it's still not "the one".

I wasn't that impressed.  First of all, you MUST drain the grease!  I had wondered if I should, but decided to follow the recipe exactly.  It was greasy as can be!!!  I had a whole layer of grease on top, thank goodness I wasn't cooking for company.

Good sauce!  The only thing I changed is that I didn’t put all the oil; I probably used about 2 tablespoons just to sauté the garlic.  An easy way to take the peel off of a tomato is to put them in boiling water for just a bit and the skin comes right off.

Really good bolognese.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, and still have tons! Next time will decrease the Oil and cayenne, other than that was really good.  Will definitely try again.

It has taken me years to find this recipe.  I had gotten this recipe from a  neighbor it was wonderful.  I had copied it down at 15 yrs old and lost it.  Now I have it.  HAVING BEEN RAISED IN AN ITALIAN NEIGHBORHOOD ALL I CAN SAY IS: ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SAUCE I HAVE EVER HAD.   I also make large batches of it.

When I was a young girl my family lived in a two-family house owned by Italian Americans. Every Saturday the grandmother, who lived on the second floor, made her special sauce. Every once in a while she would bring some to our family. How we loved that sauce. I always wanted to find a recipe that was close to hers, and this sauce is it! It makes a lot of sauce, perfect for freezing. Couldn’t recommend this sauce any higher.

Thank you for sharing!   I tweaked due to on hand ingredients but stayed as true as possible and loved it!  In case you all don't know, you must brown beef on high heat; otherwise you are sweating it.  Get it good and brown so it will hold up for simmering.  Delish and easy to modify for kids/dietary needs.

This sauce was the first me and my fiance had ever tried and we did tweak it a little bit we only used a quarter of a bell pepper and used canned tomatoes and a wine called burgandy only because we couldnt find the one it called for and we also threw some asiago cheese on top.this was great thanks for sharing this recipe, also we only let it simmer for about 45 mins it kept trying to thicken up and i like sauceier sauce next time we'll try siimering it the whole time!! Thanks again!

I loved this recipe.  My family loves chunky spaghetti sauce.  I did half chuck and half Italian sausage.  I left out the cayenne because of the sausage.

This was really very good and thick spaghetti sauce.  However, ours had a bit of a bitter taste.  Not sure if the wine I used was old or not the right type (can't remember what it was called.  Red and dry.  Leftover from a dinner).  I think that is what we were tasting.  Anyway, I'll definitely make this again b/c even with the bit of bitter taste, it was still very good.  I'll just omit the wine or use another type.  Thanks.

Choose a wine you like, since it cooks down for hours. This is what I did: I cooked my meat, onions and bell pepper together let it drain in a strainer. Then, I put a lil' oil in the pan and browned my garlic while the meat was still in the strainer. Then I added my wine to the garlic and let the alcohol cook off; then added the meat to the wine followed by the rest of the ingredients. I don't think you really need the flour. I also used one large can of stewed tomatoes instead.  When I use the jar sauce I ALWAYS add onion, garlic and bell pepper so this tasted similar to the jar. I don't know if I will go through this much trouble again--although it was an easy recipe, the jar's just easier.

Instead of browning the meat, I made everything and added meatballs and simmered those with the sauce for 2 hours. Fabulous! Sauce added flavor to the meatballs and meatballs still flavored the sauce. I also left out mushrooms because I had none on hand, but it was great and I have no doubts about how great this recipe would be in the as-printed proportions. I was surprised at how much kick the cayenne gave, but I love spicy food. Granted, it wasn't super-hot, but definitely noticeable!

Maybe I shouldn't rate this because I didn't use all the ingredients.  I used what I had on hand for half a batch.  Basically, I used 1/2 pound turkey, left out the oil and flour, added 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and subbed Italian seasoning for the spices.  I wanted to review it anyway because I doubt my substitutions made a huge difference (except maybe the flour and oil part) and this was THE BEST spaghetti sauce I've ever made!  The wine and lots of garlic give it an exceptional flavor and the sauce was thick and wonderful after simmering for 3 hours.  I didn't have mushrooms but love them, so next time they will be included.  Can't wait to try this recipe in lasagna!

Great basic, needed more garlic for my personal taste, so I added quite a bit of garlic powder. Leftovers were fantastic!! Will definitely make this again

This recipe is simply fabulous.  My guy and kid raved about it and now I can't serve anything but this! I occasionally omit some of the spices when I don't have them on hand, or substitute white wine for red.  It always comes out amazing. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is very good. Especially since this was our first attempt at sauce. Wine gives it an original flavor. The meat definately needs to be drained!

I made this on a Saturday night, finished at about 10pm and ate so much it made me sick on Sunday, 5 Stars ++.  I cut the wine back to 1.5 cups, and replaced 1 lb of hamburger with an extra pound of mushrooms.  Used half white mushrooms, half brown.

My husband said it was a bit too sweet for his liking. I thought it did taste alot like restaurant style sauces though. It was very thick but in the recipe it doesn't say to drain the meat, I would because in the end after the 3hours of simmering, there was alot of grease on the top of the sauce that I had to drain off. All in all It is one of the best ones that I'v tried to make so far but still isn't that GREAT one yet.

WOW what a great sauce. I made enough for 3 batches of pasta. Thank you so much. It was very easy to make and the taste is perfect. I never heard of putting flour in sauce before but it worked out fantastic.

Taste good.  I did add both mild and hot Italian *sausage(cut up) to make it extra hearty and meaty.

*I cooked them separately, to make sure they were cooked all the way through.

Just a pinch of cayenne. Sauteed the onions, garlic, meat and Italian sausage together, sautéed the mushrooms and some zucchini in butter and some of the red wine, then threw all of the ingrediants (add diced tomatoes with basil/garlic/oil) into a crockpot and let it sit on low for....well...until  I was ready, maybe 5 hours. Turned out great!

Worth every minute of extra effort. Only used 2lbs of meat(1 beef, 1 Turkey Italian) Next time I'll probably use only half the wine. Excellent recipe enjoyed by all.
