Healthy and delicious! I think my favorite thing about this smoothie was the hint of pepitas that comes through. The slight nutty flavor goes so well with the sweet banana-mango flavor.  I made it exactly as written (using a couple handfuls of baby kale). I had to add a little extra water to get mine blending. Looking forward to making this again soon!

This was delicious! I added a bit of lime juice and used raw spinach as I didn't have any kale and it was fantastic!!
