I make this pudding as listed in recipe and it comes out very watery, but I pour it in 1 cup size glass containers and store in freezer and it turns into a frozen dessert which makes for a really nice ice cream alternative. Eat the next day or a good 8hrs frozen tastes better the longer in freezer.
I am gluten free, dairy free, soy free & don't like to eat gums of any sort or all the preservatives in the frozen store bought desserts these days, so this makes for a nice healthy alternative.
I made the avocado recipe listed on this website and found this one to be much more satisfying full of fiber as well, my husband liked this one better also. Thanks for posting
