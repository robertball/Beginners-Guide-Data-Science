I loved this althought I didn;t make it exactly as written. I left out the mushrooms and spinach b/c my kids wouldn't eat it then. I also substtuted veg broth for the chicken so my veggie daughter would eat it. Otherwise, followed the recipe and it was delicious. We ate the entire serving in one meal so will be making this again soon.
