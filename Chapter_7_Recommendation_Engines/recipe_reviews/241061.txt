11-5-2016  ~This is fast and easy, for sure. Homemade soup on the table in no time and easily adaptable to use whatever vegetables you may have on hand. I modified it a bit to include my own tomatoes put up from my garden, and beef broth rather than water and bouillon.  Normally I add a good sprinkle of Parmesan cheese at serving, but not with this cheese tortellini and its bold flavor. Just as the soup was improved using a good broth rather than bouillon, so would a soup pasta rather than the tortellini.  I may throw this quick soup together again in the future, particularly since it easily makes use of ingredients I readily have available, but with these simple substitutions.

This soup was awesome! i made two batches and used turkey sweet sausage in one and regular beef sausage in another- both were great! I added egg noodles in addition to the tortellini as there just wasn't enough pasta. We couldn't stop eating it. we had toasted olive bread and also sprinkled it with cheese which made it extra great!

Yes, this is very good.  It's a wonderful cold-weather recipe that you just want to eat bowls & bowls of.  The tomato, zucchini & mushroom make it healthy and vibrant, and the sausage and pasta make it somewhat decadent.  I did use beef broth instead of bouillon, but bouillon will take up less room in your shopping cart.  The parmesan sprinkled on top (I use Parmigiano Reggiano from Italy) and crusty bread are essential, don't skip them!  Oh... and if you make this in the crock pot, boil the pasta separately and put some in a bowl and pour the soup over before serving.  Tortellini get soggy fast over continuous heat.

Delicious, hearty and easy! I used Shiraz for the wine and some frozen tortellini I cooked on the side. (Just because that's what I had on hand.) You can also drink the rest of the wine while you're cooking the soup. ;)

I love this hearty soup!  I used homemade beef stock that I had left over from a pot roast, and threw in a fresh bay leaf while it simmered!  Awesome fall meal!

11/12/16- I made this tonight and everyone loved it. I used beef broth instead of the water and bouillon. I also used a Cabernet which was nice and hearty! I tried using chicken sausage and that wasn't very popular. Next time I will follow the recipe on that!

11-8-16 Made this soup tonight, Wow what a great soup. I did not use the wine, instead I used beef broth because I do not like to cook with wine. (Hope no one get offended, it is simply my own personal choice). You should really try this soup it is a wonderful, hearty, and delicious soup.  My husband really liked it as well. We give it a 10 here in our house.
