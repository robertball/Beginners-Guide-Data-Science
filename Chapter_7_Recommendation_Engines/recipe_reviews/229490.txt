I used frozen chicken breasts and my own seasoning mix but kept the rest the same. It turned out pretty good for the effort put in. Will definitely make again. It would transfer well to a crock pot recipe as well if you had more time.

This was really good, I used 2 chicken breasts and cream of chicken soup, and instead of greek seasoning I used mcCormicks chicken seasoning and served it with peas.

This was very easy. I browned some chicken breast using the Greek Seasoning. I made two steam in bag brown rice packages. Added mushroom soup and some extra Greek Seasoning and some salt. Then added some browned sauteed onions very easy one pot meal for a work night!

I've made this three times in the last couple of months, twice with chicken and once with pork- love it as it's delicious, quick and easy, and reheats well.

The last last time I made it was the best so far as I enhanced it with a couple of ingredients from another go-to Greek recipe.  I mixed in a tablespoon or so of lemon juice with the mushroom soup when I baked the 2 boneless chicken breasts and finished the dish with  a generous sprinkle of crumbled feta cheese and chopped Kalamata  olives as I plated.   Outstanding and effortless

My husband and I loved this! It is a good way to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I don't like brown rice, so I made the fake kind with white rice, consomme and butter.  The dish was delicious!

I made this recipe almost as directed, except that I had two chicken breasts that I cut into smaller pieces. If I were to cook it again, I would make my own sauce and flavor it by stirring in the Greek seasoning and adding fresh, sauteed mushrooms. At the very least, milk or broth should be added to the soup base first, and the seasoning should be mixed with the soup before pouring it over the chicken. The volume of sauce was plenty for two breasts, and I think it would be enough for four breasts.

I'll have to give this a 3 because it doesn't call for any salt and pepper and it needed it.  I also made my own cream of mushroom, which I think tastes worlds better than the stuff from a can.  I think it would be better with some sauteed veggies in the mix.  Maybe onion, red bell pepper, perhaps some throw in some olives.
