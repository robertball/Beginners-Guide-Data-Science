This is truly a universal Marinade for Pork! I used all these ingredients to make an injection Marinade for my pulled pork. I added 1-1/2 Tablespoons of my dry rub 2 Tablespoons of Wright s Liquid Smoke and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper then let it dissolve before I injected it. We tried it once completed and rested and this marinade made the pork so juicy and tender! Everyone loved it immensely! Thanks Julie for making me look good especially because I baked it low and slow in the oven instead of smoking or grilling it!
