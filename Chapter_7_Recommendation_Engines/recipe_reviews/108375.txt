This was delicious! I marinated the chicken for a day to give it extra flavor and instead of just using plain mango and avocado chunks I combined them with the juice of one lime and some fresh cilantro and parsley to make more of a "salsa." The chicken was moist and flavorful the salsa was amazing and the citrus sauce complimented it perfectly. I served this with some frozen corn seasoned with butter salt pepper and dried thyme leaves. My fiancee called this meal "crazy tasty" which is his highest honor! I'll be making this one again soon. The only thing I'll change is that I'll probably add more red pepper to the marinade next time as this wasn't 'spicy' at all but other than that I'd say it was pretty perfect.

This is by far my favorite recipe!!! I follow the recipe to the T (which is a rarity for me) and it comes out perfect every time. Serve with black beans and plantains fried in butter for more complete cuban resteraunt experience. Now I've just got to find a bomb yucca recipe.

This was fantastic. I had to make a couple of alterations due to missing some ingredients. First I bought a chili pepper but lost it between te store and home. I took a chance and used Sriracha hot sauce (what looked to be the amount of the missing pepper) and omitted the salt. Second I used cumin powder instead of seeds (one teaspoon). Third I used two teaspoons lime juice instead of the lime zest (I just didn't feel like zesting the lime). Fourth I reduced the butter to 1 tablespoon. I poked holes in the chicken and marinated for 6 hours. It had a nice kick not too spicy. I could have drank the sauce it was so good!

This was so yummy my vegetarian sister tried a bite and ended up eating half a breast herself she thought it was so yummy. I did have trouble thickening the sauce but used five alive instead of orange juice so this might have been the cause. Also used a green chillie instead of red. Did not find it spicy at all. Even my picky 4 year old liked it. Will make this again and again.

Superb. I did chop the avocados and mango and added some chopped red pepper to make more of a salsa. Didn't have orange juice so I used Simply Lemonade added Hot Mango Pick-a-Pepper sauce and honey for the sauce over the chicken. Mmm. Delicious.

I thought this was an excellent recipe! My fiance loved it as well. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken so I just sauteed it in the paste from the blender and transfered it all to a baking dish. I also had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken so I added a little cornstarch and cut the butter in half. It turned out great! I will make this again.

This one is definitely a keeper! One of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. I followed the recipe almost exactly but had to substitute a white/yellow chile for the red chile and had to bake the chicken longer than the 8 minutes the recipes calls for. My pieces of chicken were very thick. It was flavorful and moist but not at all spicy. The sauce was amazing and the avocado mango and cilantro on top made the dish complete. As we were eating dinner my husband and I looked at each other and we knew this was a winner. I can't wait to cook this for a dinner party!

The chicken was okay. I let it marinate for 24 hours and the chicken didn't have big flavor. I thought the sauce had way to much butter.

This was good even though I didn't have much time: I used powdered cumin instead of the seeds and only marinated the chicken for just over an hour. I grilled the chicken and basted it while cooking. I also used this recipe on a pork chop and that also turned out good. My husband doesn't care for mangoes so I replaced them with nectarines on his and he liked it.

I made this w coconut rice. I cut the chicken into strips marinated 4 hrs served on skewers like satays and it was AMAZING. So flavourful tender absolutely delicious. The salsa too was delicious -I added diced red pepper corn and a little bit of honey cuz my mango wasn't too sweet. But I kinda felt like each part was better on its own. The salsa overpowered the chicken and the chicken muddied the flavour of the salsa. I will definately make both again but not together. 5 stars and then some for each on its own but not together. Oh! And I left the butter out and that was fine.

Best recipe ever! Thanks for sharing. I read previous reviews and learned it's not really spicy. So I added chopped jalapeno & red pepper in the salsa as well as lemon juice as one person suggested and sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley. And while cooking the sauce I added one chilli to boil just to add a bit of spicy flavour. It turned out great! My husband loved it and can't stop saying 'There are so many things happening in this dish!'

Awesome! Thank you so much for sharing. This is wonderful! I wasn't convinced the chicken would be cooked in that short a time but it was perfect! and the flavors were amazing. I made it exactly as written (except I only had ground cumin so I had to use that instead of the seed) and it was amazing. I served it with the Lime Cilantro rice on the AR website - they went great together! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars:o)

I thought that this was really fun. The chicken was nice and juicy. I felt it was a little bland the first time I made it yes I've made it twice. The second time I made it I decided to actually marinade the avocado and mango in lime juice for just a little while so that the avocado wouldn't turn brown. The lime added some nice flavor to the dish as well. I served it with black beans jasmine rice and LOTS of cilantro the second time around and it was a hit. We also had the Fire & Ice Salsa on the side - check that recipe out too. One really nice thing about this dish is that it is allergy friendly. I made it for people who had both lactose and gluten allergies and they could both eat it and liked it. Thank you!

This is an excellent recipe that I got to try for the first time. Highlights: - Skinless thighs vs. skinless boneless breasts (personal preference) - Followed advice of another reviewer and made the veggies accompanying this dish more like a salsa. - For those w/ dietary concerns I used Smart Balance Light instead of butter (5g total fat/serving and 90mg sodium/serving) balanced out w/ a lower sodium soy sauce ( 470mg/serving vs. close to a 1000mg/serving w/ regular soy sauce) and was able to maintain the flavor quite well. Overall this is an excellent and delicious recipe if you have the time as the prep is a bit time-consuming.

This was delicious. The changes I made was to marinate overnight use cumin powder (1 teaspoon) instead of cumin seeds and less butter (2 tablespoons). The sauce was ok. We had it with Mexican rice from this site also.

I absolutely never cook with fresh chicken because it kind of grosses me out. But...my husband is Cuban and i was looking for a healthy recipe - and wow - this is absolutely great! I agreed with the other reviewer about adding lime juice and cilantro to the salsa - lovely try it you will not be sorry.

I agree with the other reviewer who said the chicken didn't really have an amazing flavor. It was actually kind of bland especially for a Cuban dish. And I marinated it overnight. Next time I plan to use lime juice (instead of orange) more pepper and a little more salt in the marinade next time. I also agree that the sauce had too much butter. It would have been a much better balance of flavors and more savory if the orange juice flavor came through a little more but it was completely overpowered by the butter. I think half the butter would be about right. Overall it was decent and I did enjoy the avocado and mango made into a salsa with some lime juice added like others suggested. I am sure with the changes it will be a five star recipe. I paired it with black beans and coconut rice which complimented the flavors well so if you are stuck for sides those go well with this entree.

Delicious! I love that it's protein and fruit all in one dish. Add some black beans you've got a meal with relatively little effort. I've made this several times and find it much easier to us ground cumin instead of the cumin seed. Also I leave out the butter. I'm sure it adds richness but the sauce is so flavorful you really don't miss it.

This was good - no leftovers at my place. A few notes...this is not a spicy dish at all in my opinion. A baby could eat this. The Mango Avocado Salsa was the BEST part of this dish and I will make it again and add fresh jalapeno chopped - oh for the record I did like other reviewers and actually made it a salsa with lime and cilantro. The sauce itself did not do much for me. If I make this again it will likely be without the sauce. I served with homemade black beans and some brown rice.

My boyfriend and I made this together and although we really enjoyed the dish I was hoping for something a little spicier. We will make it again but add more chili to the marinade. We did pair the dish with a mixture of black beans and corn with some pre-mixed cajun spices added to it and some garlicky fried plantains which really complimented the meal. overall it was a great success.

This TOTALLY rocked! We loved it. Didn't have a red chili pepper so used red pepper flakes and omitted the butter from the sauce. Is a great summer meal for the grill. That marinade is awesome. We added extra pressed garlic and just loved it.

I just made this last night and it was fantastic. I didn't have a red Chile pepper on hand so I used three chipotles chiles in adobo sauce that I had on hand for the marinade. I also used about a teaspoon of margarine instead of the amount of butter called for and while the sauce never really thickened it still had a great flavor. I can't wait to make this again although I may decrease the sugary stuff a bit for the husband as he doesn't like sweet meats... Thanks for sharing.

Using this recipe as a base for grilling a 3 1/2 lb. chicken parted out I doubled the marinade quantities using Seville orange juice in place of the regular orange and lemon juice mix called for. I made the salsa as shown but doubled. The chicken was tender moist and spicy bright with its citrus/garlic/cumin/chile infused crust. It was the star of the dinner that included a vinaigrette dressed green salad roasted sweet potatoes (dressed with a little of the salsa's orange reduction sauce) saffron brown rice and berries over sorbet after.

Liked it! Served over rice and it was tasty for sure! I didn't have orange juice and used a combination of honey and water for the orange juice in the sauce and squeezed some lemon juice for the citrusy taste. Turned out very well! A dish I would make again for sure!

I'm not an avocado fan so I didn't make the salsa but I did make the chicken...This was so good! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and I did marinate them over night..The most moist chicken I have ever made! I would add a little more seasonings the next time it was a bit bland for my family;s taste but overall it was great. I'm giving it a 5 star even though I didn't make the entire recipe...Try this chicken it's great!

This is so flavorful. I love mangoes and avocados so I was eager to try this and I was not disappointed. I think cutting down on the butter on the orange sauce a bit doesn't hurt it if you are watching calorie intake. Still the buttery-orange flavor is so good it's hard to not make it as directed.

I was expecing some heat to this recipe considering it is Cuban and was disappointed. All the heat is in the marinade. Next time I will cook the chicken in the marinade and also put some chili pepper in the sauce that goes on top. Made as is it is very bland. As stated by another user I used coconut milk instead of butter.

I have used this recipe multiple times over the last couple of years. I truly feel like I'm sooooo lucky to have found it. The only things I have changed I don't use butter at all and a little fresh garlic in the sauce. Everyone that I have fed this to (including myself) has said that this is one of the best things they have ever eaten. Please do not underestimate the power of a little lime zest. It makes the sauce taste like candy!

My husband and oldest son said this recipe was a keeper but I made a few changes. Since we aren't fans of hot spicy and have limited fresh produce available I didn't use a fresh chili pepper. I lightly roasted a red bell and cut it in strips (I used the pepper). I used fresh orange juice for both the marinade and sauce. For the first part I combined the marinade and poured it over boneless breast and red pepper strips in the crock pot and cooked on low for about 8 hours. It came out perfect. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and lime juice instead of lime zest in the sauce. I didn't have unsalted butter but left out 1/2 the salt in the marinade. I only had part of an avocado but had lots of mango. Since it was put on top for serving I left the mango and avocado in separate dishes so my son that doesn't care for avocado could just use mango.

This is the first time I've rated a recipe. The chicken was so delicious I just had to add my two cents. I made the recipe as written except I forgot to add the butter at the end but it didn't seem to be missing anything. It had such depth of flavor and was absolutely scrumptious!! I'm almost tempted to make it again tonight! I can't see cooking chicken any other way. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!

This recipe is amazing! The marinade is the best I have ever had for chicken. When it came to the mango and avocado I actually made a salsa on the side: mango avocado red onion cilantro habanero lime juice salt and pepper and then I put that on top of the chicken. With the sauce drizzled over the top the flavor is endless. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe three times now. When I made it the second time I questioned the amount of butter in the sauce. When I made it the third time I omitted the butter entirely. It makes for a much healthier sauce. I served it with couscous and the results were pleasing. Otherwise I think it's very good.

This was great and I didn't even have time to marinate it! My grocery store didn't have red chile peppers so I used a serano instead (could have easily used 2). I also used ground cumin instead of roasting the seeds myself. Next time I will marinate it overnight and grill the chicken instead of browning and baking. Served with Black Beans Corn and Yellow Rice recipe from this site. So yummy and the whole family loved it!

The only thing I did differently was to cook the chicken using sous vide and seared it. This was so delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Not that difficult to make and absolutely delicious! The leftovers of mango and avocado salsa make a great dip for chips.

My husband and I thought this was an ok to good dish and the sauce was great. We found the cold salsa to be a little weird with the hot chicken so I might heat up the fruit a little next time. My dad on the other hand thought it was spectacular. He raved about it all night. I made this with coconut-mango rice which went well but made the whole thing very sweet.

This was really good. I had to make a few modifications because I couldn't find some ingredients have some food intolerances and just don't like cilantro! I used dried red pepper flakes instead of a fresh red chile pepper. I omitted the soy sauce and butter. Since the sauce wasn't thickening I added a bit of cornstarch. I also marinated the chicken overnight. This was soooooo good.

A favorite at our house. I always double the sauce because it’s great with leftover yellow rice and black beans.

First of all, the marinade, sauce, and the salsa were all great! The cumin was very prevalent in the marinade, but it didn't overwhelm the other flavors. You should definitely like cumin if you're going to make this, though! I only had time to marinate for about 2 hours, but since you don't drain the marinade before cooking, the flavors weren't lost.

The sauce was delectable and unique and the mango/avocado salsa totally makes the dish. I did add a squeeze of citrus (lemon, didn't have any leftover lime) to the salsa.

I only gave 4 stars because I felt that the cooking times were off and the style of preparation zapped moisture from the chicken. The chicken breasts that I used were maybe slightly bigger than 8 oz each, but close. I cooked for 3 minutes on each side and put in the oven for 8 minutes at 350 and the chicken was definitely still pink inside. I cooked for an additional 8 minutes at the same temp and it was done by that point, but had started to taste a bit dry. I think that I would actually use chicken thighs if I made this again.
