This is a traditional portuguese dish.  My mom makes it all the time and she serves it 2 ways-1 as a sandwhich with fresh french rolls and butter(called a bifana) which is my favorite, and 2 served with home made fries and a fried egg(this is the way they serve it in restaurants in Portugal).  We marinade it a little diff, we don't use water and instead of the chili and white pepper, we use 2 small red peppers.  We marinade it over night also.  This is my favorite!!!

I was in Portugal this summer & had this dish. I have added some Balsamic vinegar to give it abit of an edge(Think they used that in Portugal, as it had a slightly sharp taste).
Also they had sliced sauted potatoe around the dish.

This was incredibly good, but, be warned, not for the faint of heart where garlic is concerned!  The first time I made this I served it with mashed potatoes and drizzled the sauce over them too.  My son's friend said it was the best steak he'd ever had in his life, and this from an 18-year-old male! I didn't change a thing.  Make sure you use good steak, and don't overcook.  The total cooking time might be a bit long if you like
your steak medium to medium-rare, as I do.

I made this for a small dinner party and the beef turned out absolutely fantastic that my guests are still talking about it 6 months after. I wouldn't change anything about it. Just perfect. Absolutely a perfect treat!

Just enough spice to add a kick.  Saute assorted peppers and onions for a nice side over white rice.

This was delicious! I have been trying to figure out how to make portuguese steak since I moved to MA seven years ago. My in laws are so vague about it like they don't want to share, so thank you for sharing.

I did make one change and that was to reduce the oil to 1 T and I changed it to olive oil. There is no need to use that much oil in this recipe, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. With the 1T oil it was still delicious. My Portuguese husband was very impressed! It is easy to overcook, however, so be careful.

Easy and delicious.  Make sure you use a good cut of steak though.  We had it with couscous and salad.

This was an amazing dish!  I agree with one of the other reviewers that you should make sure you use a good wine.  I followed the directions exactly and would not change a thing.  I cannot wait to make this for my sister and brother-in-law next time they are over.  This one is a winner!  My family really liked this dish!

I thought this was fantastic! I actually just used cube steak in an effort to be frugal this week and it still tasted great! I can't wait to try it with a good cut of meat. 

Like another reviewer I used beef broth instead of water and added some pimientos on a whim. I should have remembered to reduce the salt, but it still tasted great!

I will definitely make this again and again.

An excellent tasting dish.  Great flavors; I love cooking red meats in wine.  I'm also a fan of garlic.  Perhaps it was me, or the cuts of meat I used, but both times I've prepared this meal, the steaks have been a little tough.  Other than that, I love it.

Decent, but I expected more garlic kick. I preferred the Filet with the Merlot reduction, also on this site.

Very tasty. Just made this for dinner tonight. I did have to make a couple of substitutions because I didn't have the exact ingredients (substituted red pepper flakes for the chile paste and used regular fresh ground black pepper instead of white pepper). It was very easy to make, also, which is always a big seller!

This is a very flavorful dish and not for the faint hearted. In and effort to cut back on fat, I do not use any oil (just a little spray oil to coat the pan). I cook the steak, then set it aside while I reduce the liquids. I then add the steak back into the pan to warm it up again. This recipe is great with mashed potatoe and brocolini or greens on the side. mmmm mmmm

These steaks were fabulous!  The only modification I made was to use onion broth instead of water.  The steaks turned out just fine, though next time I may marinate them before, and the sauce!  Exellent!

Traditional Portuguese cooking does not use Chile we use crushed red pepper either the dry flakes or the wet Goya. There are several variations. This can be made with Budweiser beer instead of the wine adding a package of MacCormics Brown gravy powder about 3 minutes before the recipe is finished cooking. Served with yellow rice and French fries, topped with a fried egg (from the same pan) and a 1/4 red pepper (sliced the long way).

This was a 4 1/2 to a 5 star rating with my family.  I might be tempted to cut back on the Chile paste just a tad but aside from that I would not alter the recipe.  I served it with corn and homemade mashed potatoes with garlic and herbs.  The tenderloin is a little spendy but I think it was worth the cost for the meat to be so tender.  Also I let it soak in the mixture for 30 to 45 minutes.

Great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added about 1 Tablespoons of fresh ginger to the marinade. The meat was very flavorful & tender. I made it with the root vegetables found on Allrecipes.com.

This was great! It was nice having something a little different for supper. It was definitely very strong, but we liked it. To be authentic we ever put a fried egg on top. Will be making again.

I wasnt very thrilled with this recipe. Although I had to substitute the Chile paste since I didnt have it, it just didnt turn out like expected.
