I loved this margarita with two small changes.  I added 1 1/2 oz lime juice to the mix.  Then I mixed 1/8 tsp salt into the shredded coconut and toasted it in the oven and crumbled it before rimming the glasses with it (which I dipped in extra lime juice first).  The house smells heavenly while your toasting the coconut, but be sure to watch it carefully.  Must try!

Coconut margaritas are my new favorite drink!!!! I added the lime mixture as well, really need that hint of sour! There is a reason they wrote the song  "put the lime in the coconut....make it feel better!"  Also served it on the rocks, not blended!!!  Excellent !

Of course I have to give it 5 stars - it's my recipe.  One hint, don't overpoor the tequila as you can very easily make the drink too bitter.  If you do then just dash in a little extra Triple-Sec and a spoonful or so of extra coconut cream.

This recipe is fabulous - like a Pina Colada made with Tequila instead of Rum.  I add about 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk to the recipe to cut back on the sweetness and the strength - makes it a bit more coconutty too!

This is an excellent drink. I did add 1 1/2 oz. of lime juice, so I don't know how it tastes without it...but I highly recommend adding it. Also served on the rocks from a pitcher rather than blending.

I also added some frozen fruit; a few strawberries, mango chunks or peach slices.  Tastes great.

Delicious Drink! Just what were looking for when we were tired of margaritas and didn't exactly want a pina colada...we did however add the lime juice like others suggested.  Excellent!

NEEDS MORE COCONUT!  I added fresh squeezed lime juice (2 limes) & toasted the coconut with the salt for the rim.  Very refreshing, love it!

I think I have found a new favorite drink. I followed the previous reviews and added 1 1/2 ounces of lime juice, as well as a "splash" of lemon lime soda. This will get made often this summer! Thank you for sharing.

I Love coconut Margaritas!  I dipped the rim in honey (to add sweetness) and then the toasted coconut.   YUMMY!

I was disappointed in this recipe. The flavors did not mix well together. We ended up adding some agave nectar to make it a little sweeter, and that helped some, but still was not great.

I had high hopes for this recipe but I was really disappointed with it. I think tequila and coconut cream wasn`t good combination. The cocktail was sour, it seemed some ingredient wasn`t fresh. At second, this was too strong. I felt only spirit. Sorry!
