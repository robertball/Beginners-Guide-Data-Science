Loved this and so did everyone at the party! I topped with some paprika and 1/2 thin sliced green onions.  I did cool the marinade before putting it on the cukes.  Instead of boiling all the water, I added ice to the boiled vinegar solution so the cucumbers would not cook.  Very German tasting!

Been making this for years. I use apple cider vinegar instead of white. I also use 1 cup of non fat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream. Making it this way works better for my and my family tastes.

So easy and lots of flavor.  I didn't have time to chill for the two hours, I did about 20 min and it was still wonderful.  I saved the marinate and put in a second batch.  If you do this I suggest adding more dill.

We loved it.  It is an easy, refreshing salad.  I might try the lemon juice instead of the vinegar the next time I make it.

Bit too sweet for me: reduce sugar, slight increase in salt. Used goat milk kefir in lieu of sour cream. Lovely on fresh from the garden cukes.
