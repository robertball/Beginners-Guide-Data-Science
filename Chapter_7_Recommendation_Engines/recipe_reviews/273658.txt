I do a low carb eating regimen and when I feel upon the chicken pizza crust, I was so hopeful.
What's healthier than pure protein chicken crust?!

Eager to try the recipe, I made the pizza. 
I added fresh garlic & fresh mozzarella to enhance the flavor. 

The pizza looked delish!
However,  the end result was disappointing. 
The crust was about 1/2" thick, which made it taste like a chicken burger pizza.  Nothing like one would consider pizza of any sort. 

If anyone does try it,  definitly make the 'crust' thinner,  maybe make 2 smaller pizzas. 
You'll def need the crust thinner so it's not like a chicken burger. 

Needless to say, I won't be making this again.

I was kind of leery to try this because itâ€™s not the usual pizza crust, but I did it exactly like the recipe and was pleasantly surprised how good it is!
