This is a GREAT quick and easy recipe for fresh corn on the cob.  My family LOVES this corn!  The only thing I would change is cutting down on the parmesan just a little bit.  Other than that, loved it!!!

Baked it in the oven and it was YUMMY!!  We even had some extra butter mixture and put it on bread that was really good too.

Great base but decided to improve on it a bit. To the mix I also added some red pepper flakes, onion and garlic powders and paprika. I also did not add the butter to the dry ingredients. My family just sprinkled the cheese mixture onto their buttered corn. Good stuff!

Recently I was challenged to make corn on the cob for my brother-in-law who won't eat vegtables (except for corn and for that he is picky) and my older sister who insisted the corn had to be boiled first. I didn't use this recipe but I did use almost the same ingredients. I melted butter, brushed it on the cob, sprinkled it with parasean cheese and wrapped it in foil and grilled it on the grill. I heard nothing but raves even from BIL and Sis. I look forward to adding the italian seasoning on this too as BIL is Italian. lol Corn was tender and wonderful tasting. Try it, you'll like it!

Average at best; didn't think there was all that much flavor. I used frozen corn on the cob.

I just made this recipe 10 mins ago and my fiance and I absolutley loved it, just the combiniation together with the sweet corn and the buttery/cheesy taste is a perfect combo. I would definatley recommend this recipe to "kick it up a notch" for corn on the cob.

This was good.  I did grill this on the BBQ instead of microwaving or baking.  I think this made it taste much better.  There was just a bit too much parmesan, so next time I will reduce the amount just a little.  Thanks for the post.

This is a nice change of pace from ordinary corn on the cob.

I accidentally doubled the butter, cheese and spice and it was excellent!  A nice change from the usual - a different but good taste.

Good way to shake things up.  I loved it and my wife thought it was "quite good".  It was kind of hard to spread the mixtured onto the corn though since the cheese balled it up.  Next time I think we'll try melting it all together in the microwave for a few seconds.

A nice twist to corn on the cob.  I didn't think it was drastically different but it was certainly a nice change to the norm.  I too used a little more butter and italian seasoning...very pretty. Thanks for the easy, new idea SLM!

I normally love just plain corn on the cob, but this was absolutely heavenly!  I will never make my corn on the cob without it.  It has a nice cheesy yet sweet taste to it.  A must try!

My husband said he prefered some of the other corn on the cob recipes I've gotten from allrecipes.  I thought it was interesting, but I missed the salt.

Not bad. I added fresh parsley for color, and used garlic salt in place of regular salt. I'll make it again, and may even suggest my husband use the parm/seasoning mixture for grilled corn sometime.
