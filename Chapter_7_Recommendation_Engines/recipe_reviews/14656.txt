My husband and I loved this recipe we have tried several different ones and I think that this is going to be "the one" we will go back to.. The only changes I made were I added in some garlic powder and just a splash of worchestire sauce.. For a glaze I added a mix of ketchup and Heinz 57 and then  sprinkled some shredded mozarella cheese on top when it came out of the oven..DELICIOUS!!!

I thought this recipe seemed to easy to be good, but I was wrong.  I now own the Best Meatloaf Recipe award in our house.  I've made this several times, but make sure you use meat that is 80/20 or you will have some floating grease that you will need to drain off.  Very tasty, very easy.  I took the foil off for the last 8 minutes or so.  EASY and EXCELLENT (my two favorite words when it comes to cooking).

I used 90/10 ground beef, 2lbs, since I needed 2 loaves. I used the whole 1oz pkg of ranch mix. I used the entire 6oz can of fried onions. I also used about a cup and a half of dried cornbread stuffing mix. I topped both with a drizzle of maple syrup and ketchup and then a half can of fried onions (3 oz) on top. I wrapped them with foil before baking for 1 hour and 15 mintes. I sprinkled the meat mix with coarse ground black pepper and a little bit of Jalapeno Salt. I also added 1/4 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of heinz 57 sauce. I added about half of a yellow sweet onion and about 1/2 of a green bell pepper (grinded in a food processor into small pieces) for moisture, I sprinkled about half a can of more french fried onions on each and wrapped each pan in foil before cooking for about 1hour and 15 minutes.  I let them rest for about 30 minutes before serving and they were to die for.  What a great recipe! I will never make "regular" meatloaf again!!!  It's fun to experiment with regular recipes and I will tell you that coming from someone who does not always like meatloaf, this was to die for and it is now my NEW meatloaf recipe.

I've made this meatloaf for both sets of parents and both my mother and mother-in-law asked for the recipe!  This is the best meatloaf recipe that I've ever tried.  I mix brown sugar and ketchup and brush the top of the loaf with it before baking.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, this is the first meatloaf I've made that didn't fall apart! While I was very pleased with the overall presentation, I thought it was rather bland. I wish I'd added the whole packet of Ranch, plus it could have done with some additional seasoning (onion powder, garlic powder etc etc). The FF onions were hardly noticeable too. I'll be making this again, but with a few modifications.

Based on the reviews and the interesting ingredients, I thought this recipe was really going to "wow" us. Actually, it tasted like any other meatloaf. The fried onions added nothing more than my fresh do, the stuffing was no different than seasoned bread crumbs and the powdered ranch dressing added no more flavor than my own seasonings (minus the chemicals). The only "wow" part was "Igloosgirl" suggestion to top the meatloaf the the Heinz 57/catsup combo. That little addition made the whole recipe worthwhile.

Really enjoyed making this simple recipe. As usual I forgot to follow the recipe exactly. I noticed the Worchester sauce after I popped the loaf in the oven. And I used a 50/50 combo of ketchup Jack Daniels Honey Smokehouse BBQ sauce. I did use the Worchester making a glaze with it, ketchup, and the Jack Daniels sauce which I applied when I removed the foil 10 minutes before the "ding". I used a 96/4 ground beef which was not at all greasy or messy after using non-stick spray on the loaf pan. Very moist, very flavorful, and unfortunately we ate it before we could take a picture. My wife suggested we cook a bigger loaf next time so we can get some leftovers out of it!

While I couldn't agree more with those reviewers who gave this recipe one or two stars, or with those who might have given this more stars but still stated they didn't like it, I didn't find their reviews would be helpful to anyone to understand WHY they didn't like it. So here goes... they say it's "blah."  It is. I knew I'd need to doctor this up, but the idea of the ranch seasoning and the French fried onions interested me so I plowed ahead.  But I should have known better. You couldn't taste the ranch seasoning.  You couldn't taste the French fried onions. And there was so MUCH French fried onions, coupled with the bread crumbs, that this really wasn't meatloaf at all. It was filler with a little meat. And not even inexpensive filler!  The French fried onions were nearly $4.00, so you're not really stretching a buck here by using so much filler. The meat was almost an afterthought. And even though I added Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and finely chopped onion and green pepper. even though I even used a combination of ground beef, veal and pork and topped it with bacon slices as it baked, none of these steps took this meatloaf beyond mediocre. With all this tweaking to improve flavor, I can't even imagine what this would have tasted like had I made the recipe strictly as written. In my view, this is not meatloaf. It's filler with a little meat.

A very flavor filled meatloaf. The french fried onions are a nice change from bread crumbs. I used 1/2 cup bottled ranch dressing, didn't have the seasoning mix, it still turned out GREAT!!!

Recipe was awesome, I used sourdough stuffing mix and added some A-1 steak sauce to the ketchup. The cooking time needs to be adjusted to 1 1/2 hours though as it was raw in the middle at recipe instructions - maybe it was my oven but I think it needs a little more cooking time than that. Made an awesome meatloaf sandwich the next day. I will definitely cook this again!!!!!!!

A very good recipe...Very quick and easy preparation. Thank you for submitting it. To the gentleman in Bangkok and others of the same opinion...this is a recipe review, not a blog. It is designed for the use of busy people looking to put a meal on the table. If it is not your particular cup of tea you should look elsewhere and in periodicals such as Saveur, Gourmet, Bon Appetit, etc. I really wish people would stop using this review box as a personal podium to discount it's intended purpose...this isn't politics! It's a recipe swap. That's all!

Interesting mix of ingredients which is what led me to try it, but I felt this recipe was nothing exceptional and surprisingly rather bland....  The only thing that saved it was my go to recipe for a meatloaf glaze: 3 tablespoons ketchup, 1.5 tablespoons honey and 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire.  Thank you Stephanie for the submission.

Very good but a little dry for my tastes - my favorite meatloaf recipe on the site remains the Tantalizingly Tangy meatloaf, followed by the Rempel Family Meatloaf. In both cases, they yield a delicious and moist meatloaf.

Excellent and easy. I thought the fried onions would be visible with the meat, but they blended right in. Very rich in flavor, held together well, and everyone really liked it. I baked it in a free form loaf in a shallow pan and put a bit of ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mixture on top before baking. Served with roasted potatoes, parsnips, carrots and onions.

I personally did not like this recipe, I thought it tasted like something that you would heat straight out of the box.. It tasted really processed and plastic to me. My fiance said it was just ok and he loves meatloaf and will eat almost anything.

i was expecting more flavor. I was somewhat disappointed since most of the reviews raved about how good the recipe was, I probably will not make this again.

Meatloaf doesn't get better than this!  I just love this recipe - the French fried onions make it so good!  It's a regular in our house.  Even my very picky 5-year-old requests my meatloaf regularly, and he passes on dinner most nights.

By using only one substitution, this meatloaf was terrible.  It was my fault for using Italian bread crumbs for the herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing called for in the recipe - because this meatloaf was way too dry. Don't substitute - and don't overbake!

This was awful. It was like eating bread flavored meatloaf. I even added a package of onion soup mix and that didn't help. My family requested that I never make it again and I won't.

This was DELICIOUS!!!! I used 2 lbs of meat (1 lb 80% and the 2nd 95%), a full ranch packet, bbq sauce, worchestire sauce, garlic, and half an onion and green pepper (in food processor)....along with all of the normal ingredients! I split the bowl and froze half for a quick dinner some night! I am very picky over meatloaf and try all sorts of recipes. This was by far one of the best!!! My husband loved it too.

I've never used french fried onions before but this was a perfect way to use them! It tasted delicious and very kid friendly!

Very good recipe.  I took a few tips from several reviewer.  I used 2lbs. of ground beef, 3 eggs, a whole box of stuffing, the whole pkg. of ranch dressing, 2 med. onions, sauteed, and added some garlic, salt and pepper.  It seemed a bit gooey, so I added some oatmeal.  And to top it, I spread mixed with brown sugar, ketchup and HP sauce .   Thanks for all the hints...it made two loafs, and it turned out to be a huge hit.

Who knew! Very good! I was in a major hurry, needing to throw something together for dinner. I had all these ingredients. I used 2 1bs. ground beef, accidently used an entire package of ranch dressing mix. Followed advice for adding the Worcestershire sauce. Don't be afraid of these ingredients. They work very well together. I disagree with a previous rating, this was full of flavor. Maybe the extra ranch dressing mix? I sure will make this again.

I am totally amazed that so many people rated this meatloaf as the "best".  I made this exactly as stated and have to say it was the most tasteless, boring meatloaf I have ever made.  I have a quest to find the perfect meatloaf and thought after making hundreds that this was the "ONE".  Wrong, will not make again!!!  Sorry!!!

As a charter member of the "There's No Such Thing as Too Much Garlic" Club, I did add a two tsps of minced fresh garlic and, as suggested by another rater, 1 Tblsp of Worstershire Sauce and 2 tsp of smoke flavoring. Very tasty stuff that's a breeze to make and you probably have all of the stuff on hand.

I've been making this recipe for a while since I pulled it off Allrecipes a few months ago, and I was tickled to see it come over the daily letter---now lots of people will get to enjoy it.  My husband, the meatloaf connoisseur, says it's some of the best he's ever had (even better than Mom's!) and I---who do not like meatloaf at all---will even eat it as leftovers.  I have made a little adaption since I started making it----I add a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce and a tablespoon of smoke flavoring---mesquite, hickory, original---it doesn't matter.  Adds a lovely hint of extra flavor.  This is a very good meatloaf and you really have to try it!

This is some awesome meatloaf! I made the recipe excatly except that I split the meat into 5 "mini-loaves" and cooked them on a baking sheet. This lets the bottom get a little crunchy. MMMM! I thought the flavors really blended together and I couldn't really taste them separately. But it sure was good! Hubby loved it too!

The flavor of this was just okay. I would like a little more to it. Maybe tomoato paste instead ketchup and some worcesteshire sauce. I had a problem with this drying out a bit too, but I had to leave it in a warm oven for a while, and that could have beent he cause.

I'd like to try this idea again, but make some alterations to get more flavor ad moisture.

Delicious!  I tried it two different ways..using french fried onions as per recipe then using one small onion (chopped).  My family preferred it with real onions. It was more juicy even after it was reheated.

My wife is not a big meatloaf fan but she really liked this recipe.  I substituted 1/4 cup real ranch dressing for the dry mix and a half chopped onion for the french fried onion. Strongly recommended!

All I can say is...WOW! I've tried several meatloaf recipes and this is THE BEST. It was very moist, meaty, and very tasty! I made it exactly as written. I didn't have any dry ranch dressing mix, so I found a recipe for it and made my own. As suggested, I added a glaze of ketchup and A-1 (didn't have Heinz 57). The only thing I will do differently is add a slice of bread to the pan before adding the meatloaf. This soaks up the grease. Make sure you remove the bread before serving. Will definitely be making this again!!

I agree that this meatloaf needs some kick.  I added a topping that I found from Mary's Meatloaf on this site.  It is 1/4 cup ketchup, 1TBS Yellow Mustard, 3TBS Brown sugar.  With the topping I don't think you need to change anything else.  I did have to cook an extra 15 mins at 400 degrees for an internal temperature of 165.  I also drained about a cup of grease from the pan and it was still plenty moist.

I love this recipe.  I did change a couple of things. I used 1 pkg onion soup mix, the whole packet of ranch mix, added some shredded cheese in the middle of the loaf, and used a pkg of Ritz crackers instead of bread stuffing. It did take a little longer then an hour to cook though because of the cheese layer. We had a friend over for dinner and my husband, the kids and our friend loved it. In fact he asked me to give the recipe to his mom. I don't usually like meatloaf, but this was something I will be making again very soon

This was okay, I added some spices like garlic powder and pepper because some reviewers said it bland.  But it did fall apart a lot, I might make this again because I usually have the ingredients on hand, but I'll have to remedy the crumbling.

You wont believe how awesome this recipe is...and I used to HATE meatloaf! Now, I make this all the time for my family. I add an extra egg and a little more stuffing so it holds together better. I've passed this recipe on to others more times than I can count!

I made this simple recipe tonight. It turned out awesome.  I only had 1lb of hamburger but still added the same amount ingredients to it. I think chopped green pepper would be an excellent addition and may add that next.  Will be tossing out the old recipe!  Thanks Stef!

this is the best meatloaf I have ever made.  The flavors melded together very well.  Never got individual taste of onions or ranch, just a great mixture of flavors.  I haven't made meatloaf in years because I hadn't had a good recipe.  Will be great for cold wintry nights in the future.  Very easy to put together and remember the ingredients

The bread crumb and fried onions cause this meatloaf to be mushy.  I don't like mushy food.  I like a little more texture in my meat loaf.  I gave the recipe 2 stars because the flavor was good, however,  I won't be making this recipe again.

My husband and children are about the pickiest eaters I know and everyone in the family loved this recipe.  They balked a bit at the french fried onions idea, but loved the taste.  I followed the recipe as written and I don't plan to try to improve upon it. It was fast and easy to put together and the ingredients are all pantry/freezer friendly  which is perfect for working families who don't plan menus well in advance.  Thank you, Stefanie!

We've finally found a meatloaf recipe we adore! The only change I made it making a "glaze" for the top: 1/4C ketchup, 1/8C BBQ sauce, and 2tbsp brown sugar. :)

THis recipe is very versatile and forgiving if you don't use specific ingredients.  I used Stovetop cornbread dressing crumbs and a whole package of Ranch seasoning and scaled this one up to 2 lbs. of meat.  I even mixed some of the french fried onions into the meat.  Top it off with some ketchup for a glaze and you have a great meatloaf.  My 30 month old, who hates almost everything, LOVES this!  You can also easily sneak in a handful of veggies (chopped green pepper, onion, fresh spinach, shredded carrot) to trick picky toddlers into eating veggies!

This was nasty.  I love meatloaf and I love ranch dressing and thought that I would love the combination, but I was wrong!  My husband and I had to smother it with ketchup to make it edible.  Waste of ingredients, almost ended in the trash.

I used 2lbs of ground beef. This was too bready tasting. If you like traditional meat loaf, stick with a traditional recipe. The fried onions really just added to the breaded taste and not much else. This gets 3 stars instead of 2 because my boyfriend kind of liked it, with ketchup, but he's not really a fan of traditional meat loaf. So, I added more meat and it was still too bready.

Very tasty!  I used the whole envelope of ranch seasoning but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Came out moist and delicious.  My husband had two servings and made meatloaf sandwiches the next night.  I'd say this one is a keeper.

This was a very easy meatloaf to throw together. 
I topped this meatloaf with a ketchup and brown sugar mixture finished off with nutmeg to taste. Anyone who has a problem with this meatloaf falling apart can remedy it by adding a handful of Quick Oats, to the recipe. The oats will tie together nicely. I will definitely make again.

This was good - a nice variation to plain meatloaf.  Next time I am going to add some more of the dry bread stuffing mix since that was my favorite part!  I do feel like it was missing something...  I probably should have added in some spices - it's a little bit bland as is.

Good meatloaf!  The flavor is quite nice.  I used the whole packet of ranch mix and topped my meatloaf with a glaze made from ketchup, chili sauce and brown sugar.  Next time I'll try using mustard in the glaze instead of brown sugar.  I'll definitely make this again and am looking forward to trying it with ground turkey.

A nice change. I used this recipe as a base but made a larger one for a dinner I was having. I trippled it and used 2 pkgs of ranch. I also used a pkgs of Knorr rice medley, fresh onion, garlic, and bell pepper. Finished with a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar and mustard. I lowered the temp to 325 so I could cook it longer. It was really good. different then any I have ever made. I will use this recipe again.

This was good but dry.  I doubled the recipe because meatloaf is always a hit at my house.  They ate it, but it was dry.  The next time I doubled the recipe again but used a can of tomato soup and a can of evap milk and the whole box of stuffing because I hate a little leftover because I forget to use it.  It was moist and delicious.  I will definitely use this again as it is quick and easy, but with the changes.  If your family can't eat the whole loaf quickly, freeze half for a quick dinner some night.  Thanks for the great inspiration for my family.

I altered the recipe by adding a full packed of ranch seasoning, used only 1 lb of hamburger, and a touch more of the crumbs.  This recipe only varies from my regular meatloaf recipe with the addition of the ranch and onions.  I honestly couldn't really taste the french fried onions, but overall the meatloaf was very good!  Even my super picky 2 1/2 year old liked it!!  I will be making it this way again!  With or without the french fried onoins.

I saw this recipe and remembered I already had the onions so I gave it a try. I used BBQ instead of ketchup because I am not a ketchup fan. My family loved it, including my already picky 1 1/2 year old daughter. Will be making this again! Oh yeah I topped it with a little cheese only because we adore cheese in this family.

LOVE THIS ONE! I have always been a meatloaf hater.  I now eat meatloaf.  I have tried so many variations of the recipe as it's very easy to do. My husband, parents and 5 boys all love it.   Mixing 1/2 bbq w/ the ketchup is good.  I have tried it with cheddar fried onions and I also like to add garlic to it.  This recipe makes a great meal to make ahead and keep in the freezer but I hardly have leftovers so if you have a family like mine, I suggest doubling or tripling if you want any for later.

I reallly enjoyed this recipe, and our youngest daughter thought it was terrific.  I gave it only 4/5 because the other adults didn't think it was a standout, though they enjoyed it.  I had doubled the recipe, and next time I believe I will try to add even more of the Ranch flavoring for the hard-to-please adults.

While it was easy to make, we weren't very impressed with this meatloaf recipe.  The flavor is kind of bland and it turned out kind of dry for our taste.  I think the fried onion breading absorbed all the moisture.  Next time, I will try with the whole packet of ranch dressing seasoning and less (maybe half) fried onions.  I might add some fresh onions to make up for the lost half.

I have never understood why meatloaf tends to get a bad rap. My family just loves it and, now that I have tried this recipe, we will have it even more than ever! I actually signed up as a member just so I could write this review (and I've tried MANY recipes on this site & never had the urge to). Of course, my family can't have meatloaf without a sauce on top so I added my signature blend with 10 minutes cooking time left. In case you're interested...1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 teaspoon bbq sauce, 1/2 tsp brown sugar, & 1/4 tsp worschestishire sauce. I make enough to have a little leftover because my husband likes to add more after it is served!

Wasn't bad but certainly wasn't memorable.  This is realy missing a lot.  Texture is good but it needs herbs or something.  I like the fried onion thing.  Stuffing didn't offer much aside from texture.

This is a great recipe just as it is.  I've made old fashioned and quick styled meatloaves and this was delicious.    Note to others who don't actually make a recipe, but rather use the review forum as a vehicle to post their opinions: Don't.  You impact the rating the recipe has received from others who actually took the time to make it and try it.

Best Ever Meat Loaf!..A wonderful change of pace.. This is my go to recipe especially for company. The only changes I have made  are I added some garlic powder and increased the amount of fried onions. I have been making this meatloaf for years and the compliments never stop coming.  Nor do the request for the recipe.

No question about it - this is my favorite meatloaf recipe! I used a meatloaf pan so all of the grease drained nicely. I also saved some of the onions and made a topping with them adding some ketchup, brown sugar, chili sauce

This was an instant hit with my family!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I would probably top with a favorite BBQ sauce the last 15 minutes of baking.  My son said it was his favorite meatloaf recipe!

Best meatloaf I've ever made OR had!! I couldn't find my loaf pans, so I baked the mixture in a muffin pan, and only had to cook them for 30 mins. Not only was it quicker, it also gave us the idea to reuse the leftovers to make meatloaf subs. Yummm!

My son requested meatloaf for his birthday meal. This was a huge hit with everyone including my husband who for 12 years of marriage wouldn't touch meatloaf! My 5 year old already asked for it for his birthday in 2 week. I used cornbread stuffing b/c I couldn't find herb and I used the entire pkg of Ranch. This as my son put it was a "definite make again"

Only had ground turkey on hand but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Very tasty for something so simple to put together. Will definitely make again. Will try it with ground beef too. I'm sure it will be delicious.

Could use a little extra seasoning. I had great flavor but just needs a little extra. Next time I will check other reviews and see what extras they added. I like to try the original recipe first then add to it the next time. Still it was very good

I made this because it was recommended to me by someone on the "recipe buzz." I thought it was okay. I used lean beef and only had 1 lb but kept all of the other ingredients the same. I was worried about it tasting salty with all of the higher sodium ingredients in the recipe, but it didn't tasty salty at all. My only issue is I thought it was a little dry. It may have been because I used a lean beef though. I may make this again in the future. I think it may make good sandwiches with leftovers.

Very good meal. Actually served it with tater tots and it was a great family meal in front of the TV for American Idol. My 18 month old daughter and picky husband both loved this meal. I'm not a big meat eater and I also enjoyed this.

There is no way to fail with this. This is one of those go-to recipes for an easy supper. It works just as well with onion soup mix or beefy onion soup mix... really, whatever you have will work. If I don't have stuffing I'll use oatmeal and/or breadcrumbs and I use ketchup with brown sugar and a bit of honey overtop in the last 15-20 minutes.

This was the first meatloaf I have ever made and it was also one of the best meatloaves I've ever eaten. I didn't have any stuffing or breadcrumbs so I used a half a packet of "Shake and Bake" seasoning. It turned out pretty awesome. HaHa. Also, I used 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing instead of a packet. It was soooo good!

I like any kind of meatloaf, but this one was extra tasty! The only change I made was on the stuffing mix; I don't keep stuffing mix on hand, I just used bread crumbs and my own herb seasoning. Scaled the recipe to 4 servings because I only had 1 lb ground beef, turned out very good, thanks for this recipe!

This was a good twist to the "normal" meatloaf! The only thing I changed, was that I took the foil off about 30 minutes into cooking. I hope yall enjoy!

I am making this recipe this week and noticed the bacon in the photo but not in the ingredients list. Did anyone add bacon to this?

Awesome, this was my first time making meatloaf. I never really liked meatloaf but I needed a change for me and the kids. I am definitely making this again!!! It was so good and moist. Both my 18 month old and 3 year old had 2nds and 3rds.  I did make a couple modifications... used 1.3lbs of turkey burger used the whole packet of ranch (Hidden Valley Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix) used half the can (3oz) french fried onions (too much fat) used 1 1/4 cup stuffing (Stove Top Stuffing Mix for Chicken) added dash of garlic powder, onion powder, and worcestershire sauce 10 minutes before I took it out I brushed on a glaze of ketchup & Heinz 57 (1.5 tbsp each) with a dash brown sugar Cooked at 350 for 1hr 10min Next time I am going to cook it a little longer and try fresh onions instead, hope it comes out just as yummy.

My husband said this was better than my meatloaf & that's saying a lot!  He always hated meatloaf until mine & now requests it all the time! SO for him to say this one's better - WOW!  I thought it was really good too & I think our household has a new meatloaf recipe!  I did only have a 2.8 oz can of the Durkee fried onions & think that was plenty!  This one's a keeper, thanks for posting!

Normally, I love meatloaf. I was all excited about ranch seasoning and french fried onions. I only ended up using half a can of ff onions. Husband liked it. I have had heartburn and acid reflux for an entire day. Still prefer recipe for brown sugar meatloaf from this site. Won't make this ever again.

The stuffing mix makes this meatloaf!  I didn't have fried onions or the ranch dressing pack, so I just threw in some onion cubes and chopped garlic.  My boyfriend said it not only was the best meatloaf he's ever had, but the meal I have ever made!

This was very good and different from our family favorite meatloaf recipe.  I did scale the recipe down and used 2 small loaf pans instead of the regular size loaf/bread pan.  I also cut the cooking time back 15 minutes.  The french onions were a great addition!

This is my husband's favorite meatloaf. I usually make small modifications - adding 1/3c ketchup and 1/3c Worcestershire. Also I reserve about 1/4 of the can of onions and mix with about 1/2 cup shredded cheese, and place on top during the last 10 minutes of baking to make a cheesy crunch topping. It's a great recipe.

Used the whole pkg of ranch seasoning. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly....oh...but I put a "well" in the center and poured in some "italian blend" cheese that I needed to use up, closed up the loaf and baked. It was WONDERFUL! Perfect consistancy, not dry at all and not excessively greasy! Great taste! Served with mashed potatoes and "Garlic Aspargus with Lime" from this site. Excellent meal!

I had to add to my rating! I made this and we turned the mixture into burgers and threw them on the grill.  AWESOME! We will do this MANY times this summer, I guarantee!

Unbelieveably good for meatloaf.  My very picky family ate it right up.  I used extra Durkee onions on the top and a whole packet of ranch dressing. Yum!

Absolutely delicious.  I only made a couple of small changes, I added a 1/4 cup of ranch dressing along with the ketchup, and instead of using the whole can of fried onions in the meatloaf, I kept back about a third of the can and pressed those onions into the top of the loaf.  I wowed the family and would like to pass along my thanks!

Well my husband HATES...HATES..HATES meatloaf, but he loved this recipe!  There was less ranch taste than I anticipated, so next time I might double the ranch.  Otherwise very good and very tasty!

Very good and easy meatloaf!  I followed the suggestion below and added the ketchup/Heinz 57 glaze on top.  I thought overall it needed a little more seasoning to give it more flavor, but will definitely be making again!  Thanks!

While my husband and I enjoyed the texture and general flavor of this dish, we felt that it lacked something -- it was a little bland and probably could have used some type of sauce. We found it "good" but not "great"; I guess it just wasn't for us.

I tried this for the first time just yesterday evening.  Specifically, I had all the ingredients on hand since we've just passed the holidays (french onions). Very basic but really good. I will definitely make this again!

Now I have 2 favorite meatloaves.  This is outstanding.  Followed the recipe exactly and topped with BBQ sauce and some reserved French-fried onions prior to baking.  Loved it.  Husband said it was the best.

I've been making this for years. I usually double the recipe, because a) its good, and b) what am I going to do with a half packet of ranch? I do not cook it in a pan though, I like the texture better when I cook it on a jellyroll pan.  It gets nice and crusty, but the grease doesn't run off and make a mess.  I also glaze it with a combo of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar. Big hit in my house. I usually serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and orange glazed carrots.

very tasty, and perfect for a non-tomato-ey person. However, this meatloaf stuck to the pan, even a Williams-Sonoma goldtone pan!

We really enjoyed this meal, but we prefer to use ground turkey to makes things a little healthier, due to an oversight on my part I accidentally purchased Turkey sausage meat instead but the meatloaf came ouut awesome!!

This was the BEST MEATLOAF I have EVER tasted!!!
I prepared it exactly according to direction and added nothing, not even salt or pepper-  except I don't cover with foil- I like the top top to get brown and crunchy.  The flavor and texture were PERFECT.    This will be my new basic meatloaf recipe. Now I am not one who puts ketchup, or sauces on top on my meatloaf before baking, but you CAN do that, and it would still be perfect, making this a basic recipe that would be fun to experiment with!!

Good meatloaf that everyone at the table enjoyed.  Doubled the recipe for leftovers (cold meatloaf sandwiches are the best).  I baked mine open in the oven instead of using a bread pan.  It makes the crust a bit thicker and adds to the flavoring.  I used cornbread stuffing as that's what was available at the time and generously sprinkled "Buck's Seasoning" on the outside of the two meat loafs before placing into the oven.  This family will certainly add this recipe to the rotation.  Yum Delicious!!!!

Moist but not greasy, and very good flavor!  I used a little over 1 and 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef, the whole package of Stove Top for Turkey, and the whole package of the dry Ranch Dressing.  Did not use the onions, but only because I didn't have them on hand.

I made this recipe for one meal and used the rest for sandwiches; I folowed most of the recipe, but made a couple changes that I think really made it pop! I used French's cheesy fried onion rings and Bullseye original bbq sauce for the top of the meat loaf, not alot just enough to impart a slightly sweet flavor that enhances the other flavors; this adds a whole different flavor and I think it is much more tasty! This is now my go to recipe for meatloaf. As an addendum, I used Kraft Savory Herb Stove Top Stuffing mix, this is another reason it really imparted a great flavor to the meatloaf, also use the whole packet of ranch seasoning; Try it you'll like it!

I didn't like this at all. The fried onions made the meat loaf too mushy. I will stick with my old recipe and use fresh onions.

This receipe is excellent and easy to make! The meatloaf has a great flavor and is very moist, certainly no need for gravy. Using the stove top bread crumbs and fried onions was brilliant! Tastes much better than plain 'ol meatloaf....My family loves this dish so I make it often!

After trying many meatloaf recipes & being disappointed, I was thrilled to try this recipe. I have never had better meatloaf than this one & my family agrees. My husband & daughter beg for me to make it a couple of times a month. My only changes are that I add garlic, Worcestershire sauce & a splash of liquid smoke. Sometimes I add a tbsp or 2 of A1 Steak Sauce.

This meatloaf had a GREAT flavor.  I did not have the dry bread crumbs so I used 3/4 of a pack of Ritz crakers.  It was a little dry.  I will however make this again and again and just try adding more ketsup, less crackers, more egg...something that will make it a little less dry.  GREAT idea adding the fried onions and ranch...yummy!

Delicious!  I just made this tonight for my two teenage daughters - one of whom is a meatloaf hater.  They loved it!  In fact, the one who "hates meatloaf" had a second helping!! I used 2 lbs of ground beef (98/2).  I also used the entire pkg of ranch dressing mix.  I was worried that the big can of french onions was a mis-print, but it turned out fine.   This will definitely replace my old stand-by meatloaf recipe!

The boys and my husband said they never want meatloaf any other way.  This after they normally haven't liked it in the past.  My mom said she tried it, and everyone at her house said it was delish.  Thank you.

I always try to make a recipe for the first time, exactly as it is given.  Unfortunatly I was out of time and specific ingredients and had a request for a meatloaf dinner.  My review is based on how the meatloaf turned out with my changes.  I hope to try the original recipe soon.  These were my subtitutuions: 3/4 cup of Italian breadcrumbs, 1/2 diced fresh onion and a full package of onion soup mix.  Baked 1hr. 15 min.  Wonderful, juicy and held its shape well.  I topped it with a mix of 1/4c ketchup, 1/4c Worcestershire, dash BBQ & cream style horseradish for the last 15 min.  As others have said, I too am not a big fan of meatloaf but this was a very moist and tasty dish.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I have tried so many different Meatloaf recipes, that my family never knows what to expect.  But everyone said this was the best meatloaf I have ever served. Moist, flavorful and it held it's shape.  Although the canned fried onions don't stand out like you think they will, they add a nice soft onion taste to the meatloaf.  I also used the whole ranch packet, because I never use up the halves. No one drowned their piece in ketchup like they usually do, in fact no one even used any ketchup.  This will be my go-to meatloaf recipe.

EXCELLENT!  Love this meatloaf.  You can even use bison meat. I'm a beginner and I was able to make this fantastic meatloaf. Don't use a small pan or else the juices stay in the meat and can taste a little greasy.

Absolutely wonderful. My husband says its the best meatloaf he's ever had. We mixed some ketchup and heinz 57 together to spread across the top of the loaf. My 2 and 5 year old girls were loving it as well. Will most definitely be making again.

I didn't follow this recipe to the letter since I didn't have all the ingredients.  However, I added shredded cheddar, some seasonings (onion flakes, garlic seasoning), mushrooms, italian bread crumbs and I used the entire packet of ranch seasoning.  I'm not usually a fan of meatloaf but I thought this was good and my 5yr old enjoyed it as well.  Mine did turn out a little greasy but was ok.  Even with all the additions, it really didn't taste much different than any other meatloaf per my husband.

Best meatloaf I have ever made.  Husband loved it and 2 year old son liked it.  I used the whole pack of ranch dressing.  made a glaze of bbq sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, and wosterschier.  Sprinkled a few FF-onions on top about 10 minutes before pulling it out of the over.  The glaze made this meatloaf even more delicious!

This recipe gives a whole new meaning to the word "meatloaf." I've tried so many different ways in preparing it, but this is the one I will use from now on. The combinations of flavor make it taste really good! The addition to the recipe I made was sauteed half an onion and one grated carrot together. Tossed it into the meat with the other ingredients listed in the recipe. For the stuffing, I used a pre-packaged cornbread stuffing mix that I soaked in milk for about 10 minutes so the dried stuffing didn't take away from the moistness of the meatloaf .. only added to it. Shaped it into a loaf. Topped the loaf with a thin smearing of ketchup all over it. Baked it for 40 minutes then covered it again with a thicker ketchup topping. For the topping, I combined ketchup, Heinz 57, worcestershire, bbq sauce, brown sugar and a few shakes of hot sauce (amounts all to your liking). Poured it so all sides and the top of the meatloaf was covered. Baked it for about 5 minutes more, then I turned on the broiler for a couple of minutes to bubble up the glaze. Tonight, it was served with potato salad and green bean casserole. It was a hit! So easy, you can't not give it a try!

We have made this about 5 times since trying it a couple months ago. It's so easy and so tasty and I don't typically like meatloaf! The only modification we make is adding lots of cayenne. We like everything with a bit of a kick to it.

not a bad recipe, just have had better, I felt it was rather bland maybe if I spiced it up some with some hot tomato sauce, or used some more ranch seasoning. the only thing I did not have on hand was the dressing I used italian bread crumbs instead.. I think it sounded better than it tasted..

My son doesn't like meatloaf! He loved this!!! In fact, so much that he wants me to make him a Guitar shaped Meatloaf cake for his birthday! (He doesn't like sweets either). I only made one addition...mixed 1 tbsp HP sauce, with 1 tbsp ketchup and 1 heaping tbsp brown sugar and spread it on the meatloaf for the last 10 mins. of baking.

I used ground turkey, salsa instead of ketchup, and, because I did'nt have stuffing on hand, I used some seasoned croutons instead.  It came out moist and very tasty, something turkey meatloaf usually isn't!

I've made so many different versions of meat loaf over the years trying to find the perfect one, and I think I've finally found it with this recipe. My meatloafs in the past would either have a nice taste but fall apart, or have no taste at all and stay together. This is the best of both worlds. It has a lot of flavor and didn't fall apart on me. I did mix half a cup of ketchup and half a cup of heinz 57 to put on top of the meatloaf as another reviewer suggested and it was fantastic. I will say I did have to cook it for about 20 min longer than suggested, and that was with cutting the recipe down slightly, but I will definitely be making this one again!

This was a good recipe, a little dry.  I added the whole packet of ranch, some garlic powder and wor. sauce.  I grated some cheese on top when it came out of the oven.  I'd definitely try the glaze next time.

This is the best meatloaf recipe that I have found yet.  The only things I changed was to add a whole pkg of the ranch dressing instead of 1/2 a pkg, and 1 cup of the bread stuffing mix instead of 3/4 cup. I also mixed ketchup and a little brown sugar and spread on top of the meatloaf before baking. Excellent    recipe. Have made this several times and  shared with friends.

Very good!!  I changed it some. I used Italian bread crumbs, instead of stuffing, Fiesta dry ranch mix instead of plain. half an onion instead of fried onions. topped it with 2 slices of cheese while it was cooling. my husband really liked it. It didn't even need to be eaten with ketchup , like he usually does. It would have ruined the creamy taste of it. Definetely a keeper for us. Thanks..!!!

This recipe is awesome! I made it for my husband and he loved it! I used stovetop for the bread crumbs and real onions instead because i was out of french friend and it turned out just fine. I also took anothers advice and mixed some ketchup and maple syrup together and poured on top before I baked it. The timing was great too, but remember everyones ovens are different. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! We will be making it for years!

I just have never been able to make a good meatloaf until now.  This recipe is awesome!!! Even my son who is a very picky eater and has never liked meatloaf had to try it because, "mom, that looks and smells really good."  He really liked it and says he will eat it again sometime.  The only thing I did differently was (because of sensitivity to tomato products) I used honey mustard instead of the ketchup.  I did save enough of the fried onions to sprinkle on the top of the meatloaf to brown just before serving.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was a good variation of the meatloaf recipe I normally use. I enjoyed the fried onions and the ranch seasoning. But it was a little dry for me. Next time I would use a bit more ketchup and less stuffing mix. But still I will making it again. Thanks.

This is probably the best meatloaf recipe I've ever made.  I made it into 6 individual loaves instead of one big one and used a dollop of mayonnaise since I didn't have any eggs. I also poured a can of Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup and a half can of water over them before covering with foil and baking.  Awesome with Mashed Potatoes & Caramelized Onions.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe but added a splash of Dale's and used ground turkey instead of beef. It was a very easy recipe that turned out really well.  If you use turkey, make sure you use a meat themometer to be sure middle is done.

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it so many times, I just wing it now. I use lean ground turkey and bake it at 450 uncovered (I use 2 pounds and bake it 45 mins.). I have a husband and 3 boys and they all eat seconds and thirds so I know it's good!

I used a full pack of Ranch dressing along with 2lbs of ground sirloin.  I also added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese (any kind will do).  Added garlic and onion powder and, as suggested by others for the last 10 mins I topped the loaf with ketchup, cheese and fried onions for a nice crunchy top. The end result is my husband thinks I'm a culinary genius!  Best meatloaf he's ever tasted.  For the record I really liked it too.  Thanks Stefanie for sharing.

My husband who hates meatloaf (his mom made it every week) loves this recipe.  Like other reviewers, I used full pkg of Ranch and then put half the fried onions on top of meatloaf with cheddar cheese for last 10 minutes of cooking.  Delicious!

My husband loves meatloaf..and hes also very critical of the food he eats its very hard to please him..i have made him several meatloaf recipes off of here..and was suprised that he actually liked most of them..but this recipe REALLY went over well with him...in the middle of eating it he called his Mother and Father who lives a few doors down and wanted them to try it...Thank you very very much for this absolutly divine tasting recipe and for making me look like a better cook to my husband...it was easy too.

When reading the reviews I thought "this must be some great meat loaf recipe"  I was disappointed for sure. I 'm now thinking a good meatloaf recipe will never be found, not that this was bad, just nothing to rave about. Sorry.

Great Meatloaf! Though I added a little liquid ranch dressing for added moistness and cooked it in mini bundt pans.  The recipe makes 6 individual meatloaf muffins and they cook in about 35 minutes.  My family loved this recipe.  I served it with potatoes mashed with the other 1/2 of the ranch dressing mix and added some sour cream chives and milk. Yummy!

I was never a meatloaf fan growing up. I found this recipe and did as someone else suggested and used Heinz57 instead of ketchup. This recipe is so good My husband and I always have at least two servings. He says it is way better than his mom's. Now that is a compliment!

One word sums this one up..... YUUUUUUMY! This was so easy to make and it was popped into the oven in less than 10 minutes. When I went shopping for ingredients I was a bit confused on the stuffing mix but I bought the Stove Top in the canister and it worked out just fine. This was so yummy and easy to make!!! Thanks for posting it Stefanie...my old meatloaf recipe is going in the trash later tonight LOL!!!

My wife, who considers herself a "meatloaf connoisseur", gave this a thumbs up. It's easy to make, but takes longer than 60 minutes to cook. I used a refrigerated jalapeno ranch dressing, instead of the dried version. 
It is great on a grilled hardroll.

I was worried about trying this because it got a couple of bad reviews, but I'm glad I made it anyway!  The onions made it very good.  It wasn't even greasy like a lot of meatloaves are.  If you like meatloaf at all you should try it!

I'm sorry, but we just didn't enjoy this meatloaf.  It had too much of a "frozen dinner" taste & really needed a sauce or gravy to mellow it out.  This won't be a repeat in our house.

This is a wonderful meatloaf.  I have prepared it several times using ground beef and venison.  Leftovers are delicious when reheated with brown gravy. Yummy!

This was my first attempt at cooking a meal as a wife.  My husband loves onions and I figured the Ranch seasoning wouldn't hurt.  We loved it!  He had no idea how easy it was for me to make.  He just loved the final result!

This turned out OK but it was a little to bulky for my tastes.  I may try it again with about half of the fried onions.  I also think it could use a little kick from something like a little soy or worscheister.  Just my opinion, thanks for it though.

Followed exactly  (that's why I'm rating THIS recipe) I hate when people rate a recipe based on their changes and give it 1-2 stars. If you're going to rate a recipe, follow it. Otherwise post your own d@MN recipe!

This turned out great for our family. My husband LOVES meatloaf and he's requested this twice already since I made it initially a month ago. My Mom's meatloaf was always a hit or a miss (and she also LOVES meatloaf) so I made this for her and the rest of the family and she was impressed and immediately asked for the recipe. I did make a couple minor changes and that was using the whole packet of ranch dressing (just because I wasn't sure if we'd end up liking it and didn't want to have 1/2 a packet floating around or waste it) and I only had a partial can of dried french onions. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. I plan on deleting all the other meatloaves I've stuck in my recipe box because this one is the winner in my book!

This is the only meatloaf I'll make from now on!  I added a ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and BBQ sauce glaze, then topped with some of the french fried onions.  Also only used about half the onions in the meatloaf mixture.

This was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and adding a little less than the whole container of fried onions. It was extremely easy, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. I've made a lot of Meatloaf recipes, I think this may be our favorite so far.

This is hands-down the best meatloaf recipe I've ever made. I make mine with ground turkey instead of beef but make sure not to get the really low fat stuff. I did that once by mistake and the meatloaf turned out too dry. Oh, I'd also highly recommend using the buttermilk ranch dressing packet. I add two of them but one would probably be Ok. I also prefer using plain panko breadcrumbs instead of flavored ones to not clash with the ranch dressing. Try it, you'll love it!

My family loves this recipe! I use the whole package of ranch and add a glaze I saw on someone else's review. The glaze is 1/4 c of ketchup 1TBS of mustard and 3TBS of brown sugar and I double the recipe. Yum Yum!

This is SO good.  Like others, I suggest just using the whole package of Ranch dressing mix.  I'm not sure why some complained of it not having enough flavor.  It is still meatloaf afterall.  It's not usually know for its kick.  If you want flavor that will punch you in the mouth, order some Thai food.  If you want an easy and yummy meatloaf recipe, use this one.

made this twice now - once with Stovetop Cornbread & once with Stovetop Chicken flavor. Added Worchester & sprinkle of Sirracha to the mix and ketchup rub lightly on top before baking. Add about 15 minutes to bake time though.

I made this meatloaf exactly as recipe directed. I found that it was good while hot, but I didn't really like it when it was cold ( for sandwiches ).
Like other reviewers, I found it to be too "bready".

Have been making the same meatloaf (with Lipton's soup) for 20 years.  Decided to try this.  It sounded different and surprisingly easy.  Five minutes after taking it out of the oven, my husband, with fork in hand, ate half of it.  He ended up eating the WHOLE loaf by himself!  Forget the side dishes, by then, he was  too full.

This was a good recipe, however, i have other meatloaf recipes which require less ingredients and taste just as good, so I probably won't be making this again.

This meatloaf was totally delicious!  The only change I made was I  used a combo of BBQ Sauce and A-1 Sauce as opposed to the ketchup.  We will make this again and again.  I put some french fried onions on the top as well.  We served with mashed potatoes and a salad and it was a great meal.

It was really good.  I will modify it a little bit the next time to fit my family's tastes. The French Fried onions were a bit overwhelming, so I'll cut them in half and increase the seasoned breadcrumbs accordingly.  Also, I don't think you need to add the salt.

Nothing special here. It looked like it would be really tasty, but it was super bland. I followed the recipe to the T but then added a ketchup, Jack Daniel BBQ sauce glaze. Had to cook it for 1.5 hours instead of the 60 minutes that's mentioned here. I also used one of those meatloaf pans that allows the grease to pass through to the bottom, "The Perfect Meatloaf" pan. Loved the pan, not the loaf!! Need to find another recipe!!!

This turned out okay. I followed the directions but beef is to heavy for me so I tried turkey the next time around. My husband liked it but I prefer the old fashion recipe that I made up. This one was good if you like the tangy. I actually used the whole ranch package for 1lb turkey the second time because the first time with beef and only a few ounces of ranch mix made it bland.

This meatloaf was much better than anticipated after reading the reviews.  The ranch dressing mix leaves a nice, tangy aftertaste without really tasting ranch flavor.  The onions keep it moist.  I didn't have stuffing on hand but breadcrumbs were a great last minute substitution.

We really enjoyed this! I only had 1 pound of ground beef, so I only used 1 egg and 1 Tbsp. dry ranch mix. Oh, and I thought it said seasoned bread crumbs (don't ask, lol), so I ended up using those which worked out great! We thought this was quite flavorful, but maybe it could use some sort of topping, like more ketchup or something...I'll expierement, lol. All in all, a nice change that I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love it, my husband enjoyed and my children ATE IT UP! Made 3, gave one to parents when my father was sick, they loved it. The 2nd one stayed home.  The left overs were taken to school and work to make meatloaf sandwhiches!! Awesome.

My picky eater loves this meatloaf!  I mix Ketchup with Heinz 57 sauce and pour over top during the last 10 minutes of the cooking process uncovered.  Comes out perfect everytime I also use 93/7 beef for less fat.

I give this a 4 due to me changing the recipe. I ran out of ketchup and didnt have dry ranch seasoning so I combined what ketchup I had with liquid ranch dressing.I brushed the top and sides of the meatloaf with bbq sauce and I reserved a few tablespoons of french fried onions and crumbled them on top of the loaf. It was very tasty. Will make again! Even my boyfriend who doesn't like meatloaf liked it. Def a keeper...

The meatloaf came out great, the meat was moist.  This was easy to prepare.  I did diced some green pepper, fresh garlic, onion and sautéed them in a pan, then added them to the rest of the mixture. I also did not have any of the dry Ranch dressing mix, so I added Ranch dressing instead as another reviewer suggested.

MMMMm!  Didn't have the stuffing, so I lightly crushed some crutons instead.  Also used less fried onions (maybe just 1/3 of the can).  Threw in a little worcestershire sauce and BBQ sauce because I had it.  Delicious!!!  Definitely a keeper.

Best meatloaf I've ever had.  I didn't use ketchup (too sweet for my taste), I used tomato sauce instead.  I topped it with the rest of the tomato sauce, mixed with mustard, smoked paprika, cumin, salt and pepper.  Very moist, and the best flavor I've ever tasted in a meatloaf.  I've made this three times already and my husband loves it.

LOVE this recipe! I didn't have the onions and only had a pound of ground beef, so I adjusted a bit by adding onion powder, garlic powder, worcestershire and more stuffing mix. I also didn't have the dry Ranch mix, so used 1/2 cup regular dressing. I made a glaze of ketchup, barbecue sauce and A1. My super-finicky husband and son ate every bit! This is GREAT! :)

I used bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix (all I had on hand). I also added the whole package of ranch mix after reading other reviews. My family really liked it and I will probably make it again......it was great leftovers too

I make this at least once a month if not more.  My husband LOVES it and hints that its time to make it again when he sets out the key ingredients on the counter (usually just the french-fried onions does the trick):) What's great about it is how EASY it is!  Just mix it all together and through it in the oven!  I add more ketchup to the top and remove the foil for the last 10 minutes or so.  Other than that, I follow the recipe and it's a hit every time.  Even my picky kids love it!

This was good in that I had everything on hand and usually always have these ingredients handy. It was rather bland though and seemed to be lacking something. The family was disappointed there wasn't a ketchup glaze topping and it wasn't my usual recipe. I only had two small cans (2 oz each) of fried onions so I only used 4 oz total and it was plenty. This was okay and very moist, but we all voted not to fix it again. Thanks for letting me try out your recipe. I had fun making something new.

This receipe is a all time favorite in my household. When my husband and his co-workers who car pool together come home they both attack the meatloaf like they haven't been fed in days. I use two pounds of ground beef and I use the little bit of leftovers in a sandwich for my husbands lunch the next day

Wow! This was incredible. My first time making meatloaf and I was adventerous making it for company and it was a huge success. One guest said that it was way better than his mothers. I took some of the advice of the reviewers such as using 2 pounds of lean meat 90% which I think worked so well because of all the oil and juices from the other ingredients, I used the entire packet of Ranch Dry style dressing, Another thing that helped I think was I first combined all my dry ingredients and all my wet ingredients first and let sit for a couple of minutes then adding them to the meat. I sculpted the meat into a loaf and left uncovered.  It was on top of Heavy Duty Tin Foil. The thing that I think made it out of this world was the Glaze I created on top. I first added brown sugar and then added brown maple syrup( I think the key ingredient) and with my fingers spread it around the loaf, lastly I added just a small amount of ketchup. The result was amazing. Thank You

After swearing off meatloaf because my mom's was so bad, I decided to give this one a try as I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I loved it.  The kids loved it.  The husband loved it.  It was so easy to put together and was just really good.  Plus, the leftovers made a great sandwich!  Thanks for putting meatloaf in our dinner rotation!

Hi everyone. I have been making this Meatloaf for 3 years now because my husband must have it or he will pout and because he cannot and must never cook (trust me). sometimes i add a little to the recipe like cheddar or swiss cheese (you know to make it even MORE low calorie ha!) this is an excellent recipe for Meatloaf and the one most consistently loved by most except weird people, Just kidding! (no but seriously they must be weird-but ssshhh don't tell them i said that) ;)

Wasn't bad, not excellent.  I couldn't taste the ranch mix, but it did have a good flavor, so I think that's perfect.  I used regular onions as I didn't have the french-fried, and maybe that took away from the meatloaf as a whole.  I used my own ketchup-mustard-worcestershire sauce-brown sugar mixture for the topping during the last 15 min because nobody in my house would touch meatloaf without the glaze LOL.  Will make again.  Thanks.

Marvelous!  I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and added a little worchestershire.  Put BBQ and extra fried onions on top before cooking.  My husband, a very picky eater, loved this!

Awesome!  Everything's better with french fried onion rings. I didn't like meatloaf before this recipe.  I've passed it on to my mother-in-law and she passed it on to her mother-in-law.

The only change I made was to use almost 2 lbs. of ground chuck and I also put ketchup over the top of the meatloaf to give it a glaze.  My husband really liked this meatloaf.  I thought it was ok.

Loved this!  The regular meatloaf mixture I make is very wet and the meatloaf comes out so moist.  This one didn't come out as moist, so I was worried.  Nothing to worry about!  It came together so nicely.  The flavor was nice.  I thought it was so easy to put together.  I made two little ones and still have one in the freezer for later!

This was delicious!  I may never make regular old meatloaf ever again!  I added a little more ranch then what it called for.  Even the kids loved it (and they are picky!!)...but what kid doesn't like ranch??

Great recipe! This is the best meatloaf we've had. I added A-1 sauce to the ketchup and used fresh onions instead of fried. Every other ingrediant I followed exactly but had to bake for 1 1/2hrs. Next time I will use a 93%-7% ground beef to avoid grease.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it turned out PERFECT!  I love that it was an easy recipe with easy ingredients - and it was LOADED with delicious flavor!!  My husband gave me the 2 thumbs up, and I will DEFINITELY be making this again!!!  My only note is that I would for sure bake it for the full 60 minutes, and maybe even a few minutes more than that.  (Thank you for sharing your yummy recipe!)

This is by far the BEST meatloaf recipe I have ever had.  This is my main recipe from now on.  We enjoyed meatloaf sandwiches with it leftover.  Try barbeque sauce to dip it in too.  Very tasty!

I tripled this recipe so I could use one loaf for dinner and put two in the the freezer for future quick, no-fuss meals.  This recipe produces a juicy, moist, flavorful loaf.  I did not have the canned fried onions so used pan caramelized fresh onions instead.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  This is now my favourite meat loaf recipe.  It's easy to whip up and paired it with a tossed salad.

i never knew people could get so excited about meatloaf night until i tried this recipe.  i customized mine a bit by adding chopped onion, green pepper, and chili pepper.  i also used the suggestion from this page and mixed heinz 57 with ketsup both in the mix and glazed on top.  i could live on this stuff.

I do not like meatloaf.  Therefore I never ever made it for my fiancee (it's one of his favorites).  He had been having a hard time at work so to cheer him up one day I decided to make it.  We both loved it!!  This is the only meatloaf I like.  Fiancee begs me to make it.  I followed the directions exactly except I omitted the bacon.

I try just about every meatloaf recipe that I think looks good, & well this one beats them all! This is full of flavor, & not crumbly at all. A dense meatloaf that holds it's shape well. Perfect for sandwich leftovers, if there are any! Do remove foil like another reviewer stated last 8 min. of cooking. This goes into the monthly rotation! Thanks for this one. Easy...Yummy!

I thought I had a pretty good meatloaf recipe til I tried this one. Now, this one IS my meatloaf recipe. The only changes I made were to add a little worchestersire sauce and a touch of garlic. Thank you for sharing this easy and fabulous dish!

I just made this tonight.  The kids liked it, but I loved it!  The husband...doesn't like meatloaf at all!  I made the glaze for it w/ equal pts ketchup, brown sugar, and A1, but would add less A1 and cook it on longer than 15 min.  Also, I think it might need a little more seasoning.  Overall, though, it was very moist and I will make it again!

We loved this recipe.  After reading some of the other reviews I only used 1/3 pkg of dry ranch dressing and it came out great.  I also put a piquant sauce on top...family tradition.  it consisted of 1/3 c. catsup, 3 T. brown sugar, 1 tsp. mustard and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  The whole thing was really good.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

AMAZING! I made some changes to the recipe, but I don't think it would even need anything changed! I used cracker crumbs instead of stuffing mix because I didn't have any. I also used about 1/2 c. of ranch because I didnt have a packet. I used my food processor to blend 1/2 green pepper, and an onion & mixed that in. I also mixed about 2 tbsp of maple syrup and 2 tbsp ketchup and put that on top for a glaze. I also topped with crunchy onions too because I had some extra.  I recommend this! The crunch was great! I did have to cook this about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  This was fantastic! A huge hit for all!

This is a very good recipe.  One of things I like so much about it is that it does indeed show the versatility of meatloaf.  Did I measure exactly? No.  Did I use the ingredients as listed? No., but I did take the concept and it was great!  I had ranch popcorn seasoning, so I used that.  I had Lipton French Onion Soup Mix, so I used that (about 1/2 pkg).  I used egg beaters instead of eggs. about 1/2 c. I think, but I didn't measure anything.  I did add some Worcestershire sauce (roughly 1T) and italian seasoning.  For the meat I used about 1 lb of ground beef and 2 mild italian sausage links.  I also used italian-seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing 'cause I didn't have time to make the stuffing at the moment.  The whole family loved it, including my picky, picky eater, who would only eat this that night!  Thanks for a terrific and easy concept!!

I used 90/10 burger and still had plenty of grease to pour off but the meatloaf was very tasty!! Next time I might add some mustard to perk up the flavor.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I know if you are skeptical like me, this recipe doesn't really "sound" all that fabulous.  However - I made this for my husband last night and he absolutely devoured it!  I made green beans with bacon and onion, let this cook down and also made mashed potatoes and gravy.  A very simple American meal and it was so delicious.  I adjusted the recipe to make 8 servings so we'd have leftovers, because who doesn't like a meatloaf sammie the next day?  My husband does and he just sent me a text that the meatloaf is delicious!  I didn't swap anything out, add anything, and followed the recipe to the specifications.  Highly recommended!

My family loved this recipe, my son who usually does not like meatloaf absolutely loved this recipe. A few changes I made were I used garlic and herb bread crumbs instead of stuffing (it is what I had available) and barbecue sauce instead of ketchup and added some worcestershire.

Yummy!!! My husband loves meatloaf and I'm alaways looking for new recipes. He said this was the best meatloaf he had ever eaten. I'm not a meatloaf lover, but I had to have some!!! It was soo good! I omitted the fried onions, but followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out moist and delicious!!

Best meatloaf receipe ever.  I did add a few items but not sure it made much difference.  I added some sauteed onions, A-1 steak sauce and some Italian Seasoning.  Absolutely the best meatloaf I ever had. Will make this regularly.

Very tasty! My husband begged me to make this again. I didn't cover the loaf with foil, and it cooked in 50 minutes. The top was crispy, but the loaf itself was still very moist.

Great recipe.  Sometimes we replace the catsup with BBQ sauce and use Ranch instead of Ranch seasoning.  Delicious!

This was surprisingly delicious.  I am not a meatloaf fan but I needed something easy to serve a lot of people.  While mixing it, the combination of the ingredients looked really gross to me and I honestly thought it was going to taste awful.  It really was good!

Wow! This is EASY and Delicious!! Healthy?..... NOT!!, but BOY is it good! I've made it several times and never changed the recipe. the latest installment is in the oven now with a bit of garlic and onion powder added and I'm certain it will be delicious. It always remains moist, thanks to the fat in the onions. Five star for ease of preparation and taste.

THIS IS A KEEPER!!!!!
THE RANCH DRESSING AND FRIED ONIONS WORK GREAT. 
I MADE A GRAVY WITH THE DRIPPINGS.
I ALSO USED 3 LOW SODIUM BEEF BOULION PACKETS A LITTLE WATER, FLOUR SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE AND THE REST OF THE RANCH PACKET! YUM!!!

I used my own ranch dressing blend in this recipe, not only to save money but to cut down on salt. I added in a couple large handfuls of matchstick carrots and a little bit of minced red onion. I also added in a handful of pre-shredded colby-jack cheese, not only in the meatloaf but on top as well.

I had to add a lot of extra ketchup, but I think it was because I added the cheese and carrots. 

My oldest raved about it and it was the only thing my youngest would eat on his plate. My husband didn't say much, so I think he thought it was passable as did I. I'd make it again, in a pinch. It went really well with the Best Mashed Potatoes.

This was fairly bland. Not too bad for meatloaf, but I would probably not make this again. I'll keep searching for the perfect meatloaf recipe.

Excellent recipe resulted in a very flavorful meatloaf that was a big hit with the family. I made a few additions and alternations to put it over the top.

2 pounds ground beef
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
1 1/2 cup herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix
1 package dry Ranch-style dressing mix
1 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions
1 (medium-sized) onion, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can mushrooms, sliced

This was a great spin on an old favorite. We loved it, but loved the leftovers even more. We toasted bread and coated the inside with BBQ sauce, then placed lettuce, matzarella cheese, onions and the meatloaf on top-makes a fantastic lunch!

My son and I thought this recipe was very good.  The only change I made was to spread ketchup over the top of the loaf when about 5 minutes of cooking was left.  The loaf was flavorful and moist.

This was outstanding! It was a hit with the whole family and so easy to make. The only difference I made was I used Sweet Bay Ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and also puit it on top with about 15 minutes of cooking time left. Great, great, great!

This was very good. I tried to save some for a friend that was coming over and everyone begged me to hide what was left!  I did change a few things.  I used less of the fried onions because i felt like the whole can may be too much for me.  I used about 1/3 of it.  I added about 1 tsp of garlic salt. I also added 1 Tbsp of sour cream so it wouldn't be dry and a few shakes or worcestershire sauce. After  i formed the loaf, I made a glaze of ketchup and 1 sprinkle of worcestershire. I miked it in a shallow bowl then glazed the top.  I had to cook mine longer than suggested, about an extra 15-20 min (I dunno why though) But about five minutes before it was done I added shredded cheddar cheese to the top of it, then placed it back in the oven.  It will be my new recipe.  It was very much enjoyed  by everyone :)

I absolutely loved the french fried onions - I never would have thought of that.  I put some on top and they added a nice crunch.  I will definitely be using them in future meatloafs!  I also added some green pepper and onion along with some Heinz 57 while it cooked - stuff I had on hand that I needed to get rid of.  Yum!!

EXCELLENT!  I have never been a big fan of meatloaf but my husband and daughter love it.  When I was a child my mother often made stuffed meatloaf.  With the herb flavored bread  mix, it tasted very much like hers.  This will be my standard meatloaf recipe.  Quick, easy to prepare and delicious.

This was a very moist flavorful meatloaf.  My 12 year old is very picky and he even ate it!  I added ketchup and fried onions on top for the last 10 minutes of baking.  The only problem was that I increased the serving size to 10 and the recipe said to bake for 50-60 minutes and I had to bake approx. 75-80 minutes to get done all the way through in a 9x5 loaf pan.  We will definitely be making this again!

My husband said this was the best ever meatloaf and for him to say that is incredible. He's picky!
I used 1cup bbq sauce instead of ketchup, shake n'bake bread crumbs instead of the breading, and I didn't have any ranch either, so I used some Garlic & Herb seasoning for the seasoning. My kids and hubby asked for seconds. Great recipe!

This is my husband's favorite meatloaf (not only have I made several, but if it is on the menu somewhere, he always orders it).  It is very tasty and super moist.

Not bad, added some worcestshire sauce and shredded cheese to the mix, other than that did not change a thing. Had a nice texture, wasn't dry and crumbly, Tasted better the next day, but still good. Probably make again.

My boyfriend is also a meatloaf hater.  However, he ate 2 large servings during our meal.  The next week I over heard him tell his friend that I can make awesome meatloaf.  Keep in mind this is not like traditional meatloaf with all the onions, peppers and goodies in it.

I followed the recipe to the T and my family did not care for this one.  We didn't even taste the ranch dressing and the meatloaf itself had a chewy consistancy - perhaps from the stuffing.  Won't be making this one again.  Sorry!

I made this recipe fully expecting at least part of my family to turn their noses up at it.  However even my SUPER PICKY 8yr old son wolfed it down. I can't believe everyone liked it (4 kids 2 adults!)  It was a little crumbly, so I think I may alter it a little next time.  I should also note that I mixed this up early in the day and just popped it in the oven when I got home from work. One last thing, Don't forget the foil, I did and it took much longer to cook.  This is a keeper!

I've made this twice now and my family just love it.  The second time I made it though, I layered it with marble brick cheese (we love cheese in the meat loaf) and I used Garden Vegetable dressing (I ran out of Ranch)and although a slight variation AWESOME !!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was wonderful. The only difference is that I sprayed my loaf pan with nonstick spray and turned the meat mixture out of it onto a foil covered jelly roll pan also sprayed with nonstick spray -- this helps grease drain from the meat.

Oh my gosh this is soooo good!  My family loved this and I loved the flavor the ranch dressing gave it.  I used Uncle Dan's Ranch Dressing Mix because it's my favorite.  I didn't use the french fried onions because I had an onion I needed to use up.  Worked just fine and this is going to be passed on.  Yummy, Yummy, Yummy

What can I say...YUMMY!  I made this for a birthday get together with family.  Everyone loved it.  I made the "loaf" the night before, and refrigerated until I was ready to cook it.  I (accidently) altered the ranch by using Hidden Valley Dips instead of the dressing packet.  I doubled this recipe and ended up dumping the whole packet of dip in the meat before I realized it was 2 oz instead of 1 oz the doubled recipe called for.  Still tasted great.  Since I did not have 2 loaf pans, I pressed the meat in an oval baking/casserole dish.  Other reviewers mention that cooking time is much longer than the recipe indicated.  Mine took an hour in the oval dish.  Obviously, it doesn't look like a loaf, but it seems like it may cook quicker that way.  I will make again!

A sturdy meatloaf-one that will hold up to leftover meatloaf sandwiches too.  I tried it with mixing beef and ground pork for the total amount...very tasty.  Definately going into my recipe box.

This was a great, simple to make meatloaf.  My boyfriend loved and and lived off the left overs for days.  It could have had a bit more salt and pepper and ranch (for a kick).  But overall its a really tasty blend!

Good but I agree with other reviews that the meatloaf needs something extra.  The Heinz 57/ketchup combo sounded like it might be good but we tend to prefer a brown sugar/ketchup glaze and I don't think it would compliment this recipe.

Cooking time was not long enough, and my oven is normally quicker than what the recipe calls for.  I had to leave this in almost twice as long.  But it was otherwise pretty good!

Great Recipe! I doubled all the ingredients except the onions. I knew that even though the recipe serves 6 and there are 6 people in my family, 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef wouldn't be enough for us. Plus I wanted leftover because my husband likes cold meatloaf sandwichs. I divided the mixture into 2 loaf pans and cooked them side by side for the time recommended. The seasonings were perfect and the juices from the meat softened the stuffing mix and dried french fried onions so they blended in well and gave a great flavor to the meat. Thank You Stefanie for sharing this recipe!

Yum yum and yum.  I'm normally not big on using package foods in a recipe.  BUT ... the fried onions, stuffing and ranch seasoning mix was a GREAT trio (along with the ketchup, of course)  I made this about 3 1/2 yrs ago and had forgotten that I had saved the recipe until I came across it looking in my recipe box.  YAH!!!  I picked up cornbread stuffing this time (I think I used the plain 'ol chicken stuffing the last time)  I to will double the recipe because meatloaf is even better the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time around.  Thanks Stefanie for sharing this with allrecipes.

Whisking together the ingredients PRIOR to mixing in with the ground beef will  naturally THICKEN and help bind the loaf nicely for baking--DO NOT THIN OUT W/ WATER. Made this a 2nd time as per directions: WONDERFUL comfort food--nice for early Fall season!  And my 3rd time w/ this recipe, I added shredded cheese,  sliced mushrooms, diced green and red peppers--and earned the 5th star!!

This is a great recipe! My husbands and I favorite meatloaf. The only thing I change is I add Worcestershire sauce. We make the night before, refrigerate overnight and slice it up and cook on the grill with our favorite bbq sauce to "blacken"it. It is fantastic!

Very tasty. I made one change due to a mistake. I forgot to add the Ranch dressing on one of the meatloaves, so I mixed it into a couple of tablespoons of catsup and made a glaze. It made the unglazed meat a bit more bland, but the top part was excellently Ranchy.

Yummy! Made this for a ladies retreat, it got rave reviews. I added a little some garlic and onion powder, but otherwise followed the recipe. 
Will definitely make again.
UPDATE: Love this recipe! I make them in an 8-mini Loaf pan! So good for dinner, even better for leftovers as a sandwich! Quick and easy to prepare, you can't go wrong

I made this for dinner and my husband and I loved it. Tastes great and it's really easy to make. I did add some garlic powder and Worcester sauce to the mix based on a previous comment and I had the ingredients on hand. Next time I will try using 80/20 meat as someone had mentioned in a comment. I believe I used 90/10 meat and had a puddle of grease at the bottom of the pan. I will also try a glaze on top for the next time.

Amazing! I don't generally like meatloaf at all, and this was the best.  Hubby said it was the best he's ever had too.  I used 93% lean ground beef.  I used the whole packet of Ranch seasoning, and a yummy BBQ sauce in place of ketchup.

This was great!  If you don't have the ranch seasoning mix just add some garlic and onion powder, some seasoning salt, some minced onion and some dill. I also did the ketchup and brown sugar mixture over the top and it was awesome!

This is one of the better meatloaf's I have had.  I am not a big fan of meatloaf, but I thought it sounded good so I made it yesterday and it turned out great! I actually messed up the ingredients by accident but it still turned out yumm.  I put a whole 1oz pk of ranch dressing mix in and I used cornbread stuffing mix instead of the herb mix.  This is worth making and serving to your family or friends. Oh yeah, I also took the cover (foil) off of it for the last 5-10 min's just to get a little brown to the top. Enjoy!

This has to be the best meatloaf I have ever made.  I used 1 lb 90/10 ground beef and 1 lb. ground pork (not breakfast sausage), and 1 full pack of ranch salad dressing mix.  I took one of the other cook's recommendation and glazed with a mixture of half ketchup and half Heinz 57, and topped with additional onions.  Normally leftovers at my house sit in the fridge until they become a science project, but the leftover meatloaf was gone the next day.  This even impressed my pickiest eater!

This is a very good meatloaf, very tasty.  The only thing I changed was used stove top stuffing instead of the seasoned bread stuffing and served it with the mushroom gravy from this site.

Great recipes.  Very tasty.  My children loved it.  Only one comment.  Next time will use a 98% fat free beef as the French-Fried onions are very greasy.  I had to drain off a lot of fat.  Otherwise a perfect meatloaf.

Better the second day.  As the onions lose their crunchiness, obviously, can't see why using the fried, canned.  the added calories, because they are fried, not worth it.  will try with fresh onions and up the loaf with all round seasonings.  but thanks.

My family loved this recipe! I added Worcestershire sauce to it and a glaze on top of 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 A1 sauce. I did put it in a 9x13 pan that I had sprayed with Pam cooking spray, but formed it in a loaf so the grease would not be soaked up in the meatloaf while it was cooking. Very good!

This was wonderful.  The family loved it.  Had a few great meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers.  I didn't have any french fried onions, so i just used dried onions,  either way  it was wonderful.  Will do this one again.

For my first try at making meatloaf, this wasn't bad. I don't think I cooked mine long enough, because I'd rather the edges be a little crispy, and I wish I had taken it out of the loaf pan before letting it rest. It was too greasy. Next time I'll perfect it by using a whole packet of ranch mix and more ketchup. I may try adding some brown sugar to the ketchup topping.

VERY GOOD! I made the ketchup/Heinz 57 glaze as suggested, which was wonderful. I was worried about it being too ranchy when I added the whole packet of ranch mix, but it was great. The best meatloaf recipe I have tried yet!

I've made this twice now and this last time I followed the recipe exactly and didn't like the stuffing mix, last time I followed a reviewers suggestion of adding bread crumbs and it was a much better flavor. Making the 1/2 ketchup 1/2 A1 glaze is a must!!!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made! I always have trouble getting meatloaf to be flavorful, and this recipe solves that problem! I added 1/4 cup of ketchup to the top while it cooked, but that's the only thing I would ever change about this recipe. Thank you so much for posting this! I will make this again and again!

This meatloaf turned out amazing! I will absolutely make it again. I didn't have Ranch-style dressing mix in the house, so I used a pkg. of onion soup mix. So good and I usually don't even like meatloaf all that much.

Tasty! I added a dash of Worcestshire to the mix and glazed the top with a ketchup/mustard/Worcestershire sauce. I also added the entire packet of ranch and the whole package of stuffing mix. I reserved a handful of the fried onions for garnish toward the end. Mine burned a tad on the bottom, (eh, probably my fault and not the recipe's) but other than that, it was a very good meatloaf! Next time I think I will add just a little bit of milk to the mixture to keep it moister. This was way easier than messing around with all the chopping that comes with preparing more "traditional" meatloaf recipes.

I have made this meatloaf 3 times now and it keeps getting better! My boyfriend and I just love it. It also makes a world of difference if you use meat from a butcher rather than grocery store ground beef (although not always possible). I've tried a couple other meatloaf recipes using this website and I've ended my search...Thanks Stefanie for submitting!

I absolutely love this recipe. I invited my parents over for dinner and told them we were having meatloaf. My dad HATES meatloaf, but came for the sides and fellowship. He left loving my meatloaf!!!  I've substituted turkey for beef and that has turned out very well, with a slight difference in flavor, but still very tasty.

The BEST meatloaf I've ever had. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I used 90/10 ground beef and it was plenty moist. I can't wait to get home tonight to have the leftovers as meatloaf sandwiches for dinner

I have liked almost everything my wife prepares EXCEPT her meatloaf.  None of her recipes tasted good to me until she made this one.  She followed the recipe exactly and I LOVE IT! Thank you Stefanie.

This was wonderful! I don't normally like meatloaf but this is definitely a recipe that I will continue using. My kids even loved it and my 3 year old is very picky!

Delicious!  Very easy to make - You don't have to fuss with a lot of different seasoning.  I mixed ketchup, dry mustard & brown sugar and spooned on top!

I already love meatloaf but this recipe my husband loved as well! I made a few minor changes based on reviews and what I had on hand - I used 2 lbs meat instead of 1.5 lb, simply because that is how it came in the package... I used the cheddar fried onions but couldn't discern any separate cheddar taste so we will just go with the regular onions next time - I really do like them as a filler, and if you get the store brand, the cost is not so much an issue. I did not have herb stuffing mix so I had to use italian seasoned bread crumbs. I want to try it with the stuffing because I like those bites of bread in the loaf. ^-^ Since there was an extra .5 lb meat, I kept the rest of the ingredients the same and added some liquid smoke (hickory) and 1/3 cup 57 sauce to the meat and then when I shaped the loaf I put a little trench in the top and put some sauce in there too. We cooked in a covered roasting pan with potatoes and carrots. I was AMAZED that my husband liked it. The leftovers were gone by the next day!  This will be our new recipe for meatloaf as I love it and can now make it more often as hubby will eat it too! Thank you VERY much for sharing!

Quite possibly the best meatloaf I have ever made or eaten, and almost embarrassingly easy to make.  I tweaked it a touch since I was using 2.25 lbs of  90/10.  I only used the small can of onions (almost 3oz), 1/2 cup ketchup, & 1 cup of cornbread stuffing mix.  It was perfect!  My kids loved it!!! 2nd time I made it I ground up a small can of carrots, a small can of spinach and tossed it in the mix with a can of diced tomatoes (all ingredients increased since I used 3lbs of meat).  My kids hate veggies but they loved this meatloaf!

We don't like onions so I left them out. This is a great recipe. I put ketchup and A-1 sauce mixed equal parts as the sauce on top of the meatloaf. I will be make this again and again.

Excellent meatloaf!  I had ranch dressing mix in a large bottle, so I used 1 1/2 tbsp, which was great.  It does need some kind of a glaze on top, IMO.

Excellent and very easy to make. Despite the whole can of french fried onions, it doesn't taste like onions at all. We all devoured it. I would only add a glaze of ketchup + sugar.

This recipe was wonderful, very easy to make, and very tasty.  I did try the using ketchup and brown sugar on the top like another user had done, and that just topped it off even more.  We love meatloaf and I have made many versions, but we really enjoyed this one, and this time there were no left-overs!

I was afraid this meatloaf would taste a little too "processed" due to the igredients versus a from scratch recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with a ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, sriracha, and water mixture before baking.  Very good meatloaf and a breeze to throw together.  Will make again.

We loved this recipe.  I have been making the same meatloaf recipe for years from my mother-in-law and my husband said he liked this better.  I did cook it a little longer and used ground sirloin.  I put the glaze of ketchup and heinz 57 on top and it was great.  Will definitely be making again.

Excellent recipe and I did add some strips of bacon as show in the recipe photo. The recipes are this site are to help those of us who need some inspiration. I like to read the reviews and when someone changes the componets of the recipe, I appreciate that as it may certainly make the recipe even better. My work day is over 13 hours a day which includes my commute time in addition to my 8 hours. These recipes on this site offer me the opportunity to still prepare a great meal for my family and not leave me totally exhausted by the end of the day. Thank you all for your contributions. I shall continue to try them all! :)

This was pretty good. It is quite salty, so keep that in mind if you do not like salty foods. (I substituted Heinz Chili Sauce for the Ketchup because I always subsitute Chili Sauce for Ketchup - it's so much tastier.) I grated cheddar cheese and sprinkled on top during the last few minutes of baking. I'll probably make it again sometime.

Great meatloaf!  This was my first non-out-of-a-box baking attempt and it turned out fantastic!  I halved it, since it's just for me.  I used Heinz 57 for the steak sauce, only change I would make next time is less crackers, probably about 2/3 or so of what I used (I used 1 sleeve this time).    Other than that turned out wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Was very good.  I would suggest putting a little bit of water in the pan when baking, makes it to where it doesn't dry out at all.  Plus makes it easier to get from the bottom of the pan.  But overall, will definetly cook again.

My fiance is a meatloaf lover, whereas I have never really liked meatloaf.  I decided to try this one and he rated it a 9/10 and I actually really enjoyed meatloaf for the first time in my life!

AWESOME!  I used 2lbs of meat so I added an extra egg.  I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  I didn't mix in the ketchup but added brown sugar and ketchup on top.

This is an awesome twist on a regular standby.  The only change I made was I used gravy instead of ketchup then made it in a cupcake tin for individual helpings.  Took it to work and they couldnt get enough!!

Great flavor, I put a whole pack of ranch seasoning, 1 cup of the stuffing mix, added one more egg and only used 1lb beef. I also substituted ketchup for tomato paste. Mine did not stay together?? but it was still good, and my first time making meatloaf! thanks

Awesome meatloaf! The best tasting i've ever had. I used cornbread stuffing instead and only had half a can of french fried onions, but it was still delicious. I made it into a ring instead of a loaf and wrapped it in foil while it cooked. It was so moist and a hit with my family!

Great loaf! My second time making this i altered it to a fajita loaf by substituting salsa for the ketchup, and a packet of fajita seasoning for the ranch seasoning and also adding some shredded cheddar cheese. It turned out pretty good.

It was good and easy to make. I didn't use the regular ranch like suggested, instead I used fiesta ranch which gave the meatloaf a more flavorful taste.

WOW! I have been making the "FireFighters Meatloaf" off this site for awhile and thought that it was the best...but this IS the best meatloaf recipe. I left out the ranch dressing and brown sugar (since that is not our taste) followed the rest of the recipe and added worchestershire sauce, tabasco, fresh ground pepper & old bay. Turned out delicious and moist, but dense enough to easily slice up for meatloaf sandwiches the next day. Thanks for such a great easy recipe.

Okay....this is not my favorite meatloaf recipe but it is good, as long as you use some brown gravy with it.  It is too dry without it.  The only thing I added to this was some salt and pepper and garlic powder.  I also put some french fried onions on the top the last 15 minutes of baking, I got the suggestion from another review.  It was a good idea, for presentation and so you can much on some crunchy onions with the meatloaf.  The only thing I think I would do different if I were to make this again is put half french fried onions in it and half white onions.  I also think I might put a little more ketchup in it and a little less dry stuffing mix.  Just because it was too dry.  I don't know if I will make it again, because I always like to try a different meatloaf recipe when I do it.

Made the mistake of making this delicious meatloaf. Now my family makes me cook it all the time. Instead of ketchup I use a spicy local bbq sauce. Don't make this unless you are prepared to make it again and again.

My entire family loved this recipe, even my 12 yr old son that has never tried my meatloaf (He wouldn't try the other because it had green peppers in it with ketchup on top (Quaker Oats recipe). I did make a packet of brown gravy for them to spoon over it just incase they wanted...

This was awesome!  I followed the directions exactly except for the package of meat I had was not quite 1 1/2 pounds.  Next time I will plan on using the full amount.  This meatloaf reminds me of what my mom used to make but with a little kick.  Flavors are not overwhelming but compliment the meat nicely.  It was so good that we had no leftovers.

This recipe was awesome! I actually used itallion bread crumbs instead of just seasoned bread crumbs. I also only used 3 oz of fried onions, 6 seemed like to many for me atleast. This is a great recipe and I if you like meatloaf you should try, you won't be sorry.

Absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever tasted.  I was a bit skeptical about the ingredients but I gave it a whirl and my family went wild over it!  If my 5 year-old had his way, I'd be making this every night. :)

Good flavor although I couldn't really taste the ranch seasoning so you could just use an onion soup mix packet (would be cheaper on the wallet).  The French Fried Onions were wonderful!

This was pretty good.  I forgot to buy the fried onions so I chopped a quarter of an onion and added that.  I used 1.3 pounds of ground turkey and .75 pounds ground beef and a full packet of ranch seasoning, this made 2 loaf pans of meatloaf.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and a few good shakes of worschestershire sauce.  It was very moist but honestly I couldn't taste the ranch.  Maybe adding the fried onions would make all the difference in the world but I doubt it.  Not bad but not amazing either.

I did not care for this that much, too many different flavors with the herb stuffing, ranch dressing and french fried onions.  I also thought it was a little dry - I'm used to soaking bread crumbs in milk before adding to the meat.  My family ate it - I just think there are better recipes out there.

Great meatloaf recipe. I followed others advice and saved some fried onions for the top mixed with some cheese for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I used some cheddar fried onions that I had on hand.  I'll definitely use again.

We love meatloaf at our house and this is a great addition to our recipe box!  The onions & ranch give it great seasoning & flavor.

I hate meatloaf. Always have. So when my fiancee requested I make him a meatloaf for dinner, I decided to try to find one that we could both enjoy, and this one sounded like the one. I made it almost exactly to the recipe (the only change I made was I used the whole packet of ranch seasoning). I thought it was ok, which is probably the best review I can give a meatloaf. It wasn't enough to change my mind about meatloaf, but I'd eat it again. My fiancee, on the other hand, said he'd wanted a traditional meatloaf, and this just wasn't it. I probably won't be making this one again, through no fault of the recipe itself.

Not bad, but not a five star recipe in mine and hubby's opinion.  A little too moist for our taste, due to quite a few wet ingredients.  Think if I were to make it again I would cut back on them.

Great basic meatloaf recipe. I've made plenty over the years and was curious about these ingredients. It worked out very well and I admit I was skeptical. It stayed together which I love, some are tasty but fall apart. Was not to salty at all. Next time I make it I will doctor it up some by using other reviewers ideas. Very easy,tasty, great. Thanks for posting.

This was okay.  I only had a 2 oz can of onions, so added the whole package of stuffing into the mixture.  It ended up really salty, I don't know if that was from the ranch or onions.

Not a bad recipe for meatloaf.  Moist, not dry.   I used 1/2 the  fried onion recommended and the flavor was very dominant.  Just ok..nothing special.

My family loved this recipe! Even our two year old! The only change I made after the first time is I use ground sirloin, or something a little leaner than ground beef. Makes ot less greasy.

Flavor was very good even though we didn't have the bread stuffing or the fried onions.  We added fresh chopped red onion and added a bread crumbs.  It was still very flavorful.

I thought this recipe was 'okay' if you have some ingredients to get rid of, but I still prefer my family's recipe for meatloaf.  I read other reviews, and decided to use a full package of the Ranch dressing mix (which is 2 oz.).  It didn't give it more 'Ranch' flavor, but did make it more salty - too salty.  I put the French-fried onions on the top, and that was good.

Changes: used 1/2 ketchup & 1/2 bottled ranch dressing in recipe (1/8 cup of each, instead of 1/4 c. ketchup)to make it more ranch-y, less ketchup-y.  Made a glaze from ketchup, worcestershire sauce and ranch dressing to spread on top. Also used about 3 ounces FF onion pieces in mixture and another ounce or so pressed into top after glaze.  Baked at 350 for 70 minutes and then at 375 for another 15!  Overall, a good meatloaf recipe, nice change from my usual.  Will probably make again, thanks!

Best meatloaf recipe I ever tried.  My wife is not a big meatloaf fan, and loved it.  I used a whole packet of dry ranch dressing mix, and reserved 1/3 of the french fried onions to sprinkle on top during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Perfect!

This was pretty good for quick prep time. It took a lot longer to cook, so I cooked for 50 min, than cover with a mix of ketchup and brown  sugar and put it back in for another 20-30 minutes. That's when it tasted better. My husband and boys loved it, so that is a good thing. It went great with a side of garlic mashed potatoes !!

This is the most delicious meatloaf recipe!  I've shared it with many co-workers and they all love it.  It is great as a sandwich leftover the next day as well.  My husband won't let me go back to my old meatloaf recipe anymore.

this meatloaf was okay but didn't really think it was any better than regular meatloaf and it sure had added calories/fat... I was disappointed that you didn't really "Taste" the french fried onions  - my 16 yr old said to stick to plain meatloaf!

This recipe was very "pantry friendly" and a nice texture.  I used 1 lb. of ground round and 1 lb. of hot italian sausage.  Gave it just the right kick.

This was an okay recipe for meatloaf. It was moist and very easy to put together but needs a little more flavor.  Next time I will add garlic powder and try the ketchup/Heinz 57 glaze mentioned in some of the other reviews.  Overall, it was pretty good and I'm sure I'll try it again.

This was a big hit with my husband and step-son.  I have tried MANY different meatloaf recipes and this was easily in the top 3 with them.  The reason I liked it so much was that it was one of the easiest meatoafs I have ever made -- no fuss and in the oven in under 10 minutes!

This was pretty good. not the best. i have one i grew up on with maple flavored sausage in it that is the best ever w/barbeque sauce. this one tastes close to one i had at the silver diner if you've heard of it. just add some salt to the mixture before cooking. i left the foil off. my husband liked it alot, he thinks its as good as my recipe. my son whose four would barely eat it. but he's picky just cause meatloaf looks wierd i think. it would be awesome if you could make some tasty gravy with it. i had to use ketchup cause thats all i had. i did the ketchup/brown sugar glase on top also that was suggested. mostly its a tiny bit bland but if you had a good sauce or gravy itd be really good. also i might try adding the whole ranch package next time or another spice.

Great taste! Not the usual plain old meatloaf. Very very tasty. We will replace this as our new meatloaf recipe!

This is sooooo good! The stuffing is such a great idea and gives it just the right consistency.  We'll never try another meatloaf recipe after finding this one.

Really liked this but next time will add a few seasonings. Needed a little more flavor. Will keep this recipe. Husband thought it was great!

Very tasty and easy to make.  Instead of using a loaf pan/foil, I baked
the meatloaf in an open roasting pan (crispier outside), for exactly 50 min.
It was perfect!  Happy I found this recipe for my family.

I have had a lot of different meat loaf in my time, but this one was one of the best.  Also, very easy to prepare.  Even my kids ate it and they don't like onions.  I have another meatloaf recipe that I really like, but takes too  much prep time.  This one was a cinch.

This recipe had a great taste to it. The only thing I would add next time is some type of glaze for the top. Very Good!
