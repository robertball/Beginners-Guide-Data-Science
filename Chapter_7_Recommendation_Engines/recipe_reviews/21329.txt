Delicious!!! I think the key to getting the potato crust to be more like a crust is to bake it on the bottom rack in your oven.  A couple of minor changes I made was I used 4 eggs instead of 3, I am SURE I didn't use a full cup of milk (probably more like 1/2 cup), and no nutmeg. I used a little bit of garlic powder in the eggs along with the salt and pepper. It was SO good!! You could really change this up a lot with different cheeses and veggies. My 2.5 and 3.5 year olds LOVED this!! I was so surpised! And my choosy husband said I should definitely make this again. I think it's a keeper!!

This was very nice for something different. To make sure the crust held up, I added 1 egg and a scant tablespoon of flour to the mashed potato crust. It gave it enough body to hold its shape whrn serving a slice. I also sauteed the onions in a tiny amount of olive oil, as someone suggested. I will make this again!

A typical quiche recipe, however, the potato crust is what makes it a welcome change. To save on time, I used Betty Crocker's garlic instant mashed potatoes and baked the crust without the filling for about fifteen minutes, to avoid the soggy bottom crust other reviewers mentioned. I left out the nutmeg, but used a little onion and garlic powder, along with a dash of cayenne for a bit of zip. I've made this with both broccoli and spinach. Hubby and my non egg eating kids loved it!

I liked this recipe because I some how always have leftover mashed potatoes. I did listen to other reviews & change it .  I used leftover yukon golds that already had butter & milk & added 1 egg , 1T flour, &1/3c half-n-half to get it all really smooth along with garic salt to taste. I baked for the 30 mintes until edge only was brown . I omitted Broccoli & made "denver" style . I sauted onion, mushroom and green pepper. I mixed eggs with half-n-half , changed salt to garlic salt & tossed in the ham , Pepper & nutmeg. Baked 35 and let set. My family ate the whole thing. Anna H.

I thought that this was very good.  I did follow the recipe for the most part. We had it as a side dish to pork last night, and the leftovers came to work with me today for my breakfast. I added paprika to the top.  I also added an extra egg for a total of 4, and I think maybe next time I'll do 5 eggs.  I didn't even taste the nutmeg. Next time I'm thinking a different type of cheese and mixture, such as swiss and maybe a little bit of garlic.

This is a fine recipe. The whole family liked it. But I would do two things differently next time around. #1) omit the nutmeg entirely. It made the quiche taste a little off. Did not match the flow of flavors at all. #2) add more cheese. Quiche was a bit too dry for my taste. With these two little tweaks, the recipe will be flawless! Don't forget to be creative and add different vegetables to the mix from time to time!

I used a little less broccoli and added some sauted mushrooms to the mix.  It took me about 45 minutes to brown the potatoe crust, but worth it.  It is a long process to make the meal, but you can steam the broccoli at the same time you make the potatoes, and when those are baking, I made the egg/milk mixture and set aside in the fridge until I was ready to put it all together.  All the steps were easy, just time consuming, but you can clean up in between each and at the end it is all in one dish.  I made this for only myself and my husband, and we devoured more than half at dinner and reheated the rest for lunch the next day.  A few minutes to heat through in the toaster oven, and it was almost better the second day!  It really hit the spot!!!!!

I loved this quiche!  I thought this was a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes.  I stir fried mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower and onions and put them all on the quiche.  I also substituted soy milk (which I don't really like, but I use it in recipes like this for health reasons) and it came out great.  Thanks!

A very tasty, successful quiche.  I don't know if it would have filled a '10" deep pan', though, as my dish was barely 9" and it *just* filled it.  My decidedly finicky boyfriend pronounced it 'delicious' - several times!
The crust was very like mashed potato; no crispiness, and didn't hold together, though I think this would be greatly improved if I had a metal pie dish instead of a pottery one; will update when I've bought one and tried it again!!  Recommended variations:  
  a teaspoon of wholegrain mustard added to the crust;
  4-8 rashers of smoked bacon, fried in their own fat, drained and mixed in with the broccoli (non-veggie version, obviously...)

I added ham, it was excellent. Even my boys ate it of 5, 4 and 1.5. Everyone loved it. A huge success and so easy to put together. I actually used the packaged mashed potatoes instead of making my own to decrease the time to create, just upped the calories.

Turned out great! I used red bliss mashed potatoes for the crust. Also, I had an array of fresh veggies so I reduced the amount of broccoli and added squash, peppers, and leaks to the other ingredients. As others suggested I used 4 eggs instead of 3. Also, used cheddar cheese and smoked Gouda and then sprinkled grated parmigian on the top. YUM!

My husband and I ate this entire thing in less than 24 hours... it is delicious. Also, I used the crust idea from this recipe to fix-up the quiche in another recipe... made this one with mushrooms and sundried tomatoes as suggested by one of the reviews. Used 6 eggs and had a little left that wouldn't fit in my dish. It is so good.

Fantastic!  The beauty of this is that you can add or take away anything to make it perfect.  I would recommend chopping the broccoli really small/fine.  It blends nicely.  As for the potato crust... AMAZING.  I did follow another reviewers recommendation and added one egg and a little flour to the mashed potatoes.  This made the mashed potato crust flaky and it kept its shape.  Excellent dish!

Because of my heart, I used soy milk, veggie shreds chedder soy cheese, and egg beaters.  I was totally happy.  The second time that I made it I was in a hurry, so I used powdered potatoes, and it was just as scrumptious.

This was delicious- I took some previous reviewers suggestions and added some garlic. A lot of people say they left over the nutmeg- don't! It really adds something. Also, the leftovers tasted great cold!

I tried this only for the potatoe crust and was very pleased at how easy it was to prepare!  I added margarine to the potatoes and no salt, and am in love with this new crust!  I also have tried it with fresh spinach, and these frozen veggies: broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, peas & carrots, and can't wait to try them with the fresh veggies!  I really love this easy and versatile recipe!  But the crust is so much easier than rolling out your typical pie crust.  This is food that Heavenly Father intended for our bodies to eat!

This was really good. I only had a 9x9 layer cake pan, so I only used 2 eggs and 2/3 cup of milk. I added chives and parsley to potatoes. It was even better reheated the next day.

This was lacking in taste but I am not sure why.  I added fresh garlic, diced ham and even about 1/2 cup chopped spinach but this was just so-so.  The mashed potato crust was a nice change of pace.  If I make it again I will add more spices.

This recipe was really good - a nice twist on the typical quiche, and healthier too! 
I put my own little twist on it and added spicy turkey sausage, red peppers, and broccoli, as well as light cheddar cheese.  I also used egg whites and 2 eggs to cut down on some fat - and used salt only in the potatoes.  In the eggs i added some Mrs.Dash spice and pepper - added some different flavours and cut down on the sodium! I also left out the nutmeg..
I also baked it on the bottom rack to help the potatoes be more of a "crust" than a mash - but next time I would try what another reviewer had mentioned and bake the crust for 15 min prior to making the dish to help the consistency.

Not bad. For the texture of the mashed potatoes I made sure there were some small chucks of potatoes in the mix this help with the crust structure.  After baking the mashed potato crust for 30 minutes, I added steamed broccoli, cooked bacon chunks, onions and garlic and cheese. With three eggs and a 1/2 cup of milk. I baked the mixture covered with tin foil for 20 minutes and then baked uncovered for another 30 minutes.  It was good dish, something different to add to the usual dinner menu. However it did take a long time almost an hour and half baking time not including prep time.

This was great, however I think next time I will make half of the mashed potatoes because I wanted more filling and I didn't have a deep dish pie plate so once I got it all together it was overflowing!  Made a few changes... added mushrooms, feta cheese, and and extra egg.  Definitely a keeper.  Next time I will load it with more veggies.  Oh and I used rice milk and it worked fine.

This quiche is wonderful. I prefer the potato crust to a regular pie crust. Much more like comfort food. I have made some changes though. Instead of black pepper I used white. I also added about 1/4 t garlic powder, and sharp cheddar, and next time, I'm leaving out the nutmeg. It didn't seem to fit with the dish. This quiche is more comfort food, less savory food. Thanks for the keeper!

This was so good! I got lots of compliments and was bummed that there were no leftovers when I took it to New Years brunch. Instead of making the mashed potatoes from scratch, I used the garlic & herb flavor Oreida Steam & Mash that you can find in the freezer section. I'm not a big broccoli fan, so substituted a 10oz pkg of frozen chopped spinach (thawed) and a pkg of pre-sliced mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms with the onion. I also am not a big fan of cheddar and so used 1 cup of pre-shredded italian blend cheese, and also added 1/2 cup of feta. I also used a 4th egg as mentioned in some of the other reviews. My only complaint was that I didn't spread the mashed potato evenly in the pie pan. I had it thicker on the bottom than on the sides, so the sides got burnt before the bottom was done when I was baking the crust. I just cut off the burnt part though and no one even noticed that the side crust was missing. It was so yummy!

My family loves this recipe! I made it lower fat by using skim milk, olive oil spray, and fat-free cheddar cheese.  We made it for a bridal shower brunch, and all of it went!

It was good, but I prefer the standard quiche crust.  Also, even though I followed the advice of others, and added an extra egg and flour, it still came out pretty soft.  I also baked the crust on the bottom shelf, but I don't think it helped much.  I give it stars though for taste.  I added sausage and garlic powder and omitted the nutmeg.

I'm sorry, but this recipe did not work for me.  The combined textures and flavors of the quiche over the mashed potatoes was very unpleasant.

Interesting variation on a traditional crust.  In the future I will probably add some additional spices to the crust.

This is delicious! My 18 month old loved it too. Now I have a great way to get her to eat eggs! I added an extra egg and used instant mashed potatoes with some garlic powder. Fresh garlic in the quiche filling. Didn't have any onions so I used dried onion flakes. Yum!

Very tasty and it can be tweaked to suit different tastes! I added chilli, an extra egg, and extra cheese, as suggested in other reviews. I also added mushroom and stir-fried it together with the broccoli and onion, with garlic and some chilli, before putting in into the potato crust.

It was brilliant. There weren't any left-overs because people were having seconds. And thirds.

Okay, nothing special...I followed a few previous reviewers ideas and added 1-1/2 cups ham to broccoli mix and sauteed onions and sprinkled top with garlic powder.  Still missing something.  Loved the idea, we enjoy all kinds of quiche, but not this one.  Sorry, I won't make it again.

A nice, low-fat version of quiche.  I left the skins on the potatoes, and that turned out well.  I also used Yukon Gold potatoes, which are more flavorable.  Plus I used non-fat soy cheese for half of the cheese, to reduce fat.  I find soy cheese has a better texture than low-fat regular cheese when melted.

Made almost as printed and it was very easy, quick and delicious.  I cheated by using Idahoan instant potatoes (many flavor options, I used garlic).  I used fresh broccoli steamed briefly in microwave.  My husband ate all the leftovers- it reheats very well.  Good as is but next time going to add bacon.

Fantastic. I made a cheez-it crust instead to add extra flavor, came out great! (put 2 cups of cheez-its, I used the white cheddar kind, in the food processor with 4 tablespoons of butter)

This was good.  I cooked a couple links of Italian sweet sausage and half a red pepper with the onion.  The flavors were about the same as a potato fritata, which is much easier and quicker to make.  But I'll probably make it again because my husband loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Time consuming, but was delicious! I had a lot of broccoli and potatoes to use up (shop at Costco) ... I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the mashed potato crust is what attracted me to this recipe.  I made individual quiches in custard cups for a side dish at dinner.  Will definitely make it again...

I did not add nutmeg, added lots of cheese and ham.  It turned out very well, except I am going to have to figure out how to get that potato crust so it is crusty and not soggy.

This was pretty good, but coulkd use a little "something."  Next time I will use less broccoli.  The raw onions added before baking is a nice touch.  Instead of cheddar I used spicy pepperjack cheese which gave it a bit of zing!  The potato crust was lovely!

Very good recipe! I did take a few of the suggestions in the reviews, such as adding an egg and about a tablespoon of flour to the mashed potatoes to help them get firm. They did get pretty firm, and a little crispy on the edges. I used only 1 cup broccoli and then 1 cup of red and green peppers for a little more variety. Also grilled the onions (and did the peppers just a little) to make them a little more tender.

I left out the nutmeg just cause i dont have any and it sounded a little funny... my mom said i would like it in there, so i might try it some other time. As a whole it was very good, next time i might add a little garlic salt or garlic powder to kinda add some extra flavor, but will DEFINATLY make this again.

OH... and my girlfriend thought i should add more cheese or mix the cheese in more with the veggies (i had sprinkled it over the top of them after laying them out and before pouring the eggs over.

I made this dish as a simple accompaniment to go with our meal of crumbed fish and vegies, and it went down quite well, however my husband and son both thought it could do to be a LOT more cheesier! I did add cauliflower aswell as the broccoli, which was very nice as I had leftovers of both. I would make this again, but next time add a lot more cheese, or use a cheese sauce instead.

I didn't really like this recipe.  I doubled it so that I could get rid of some broccoli.  I think I put too much on it.  My parents loved it though.  I guess I'll have to keep making it.  Maybe if I don't add so much broccoli next time, it won't be as bad.

I think this would have been more successful if I had not used skim milk, if I had baked the crust longer, and if I had spiced it up even more.  It was just very bland and the crust was mushy on the bottom, even though I baked it for 45 minutes, until the upper part was very hard and brown.  I used 3 potatoes, and I had enough for two quiches so I doubled the filling.  I also added sauted mushrooms to the filling, and garlic powder to the crust.  

I didn't mind the length of time it took (it was definitely 2 hours for me) since I could be doing other things while it cooked.  Just leave plenty of time.  

I may try it again sometime, but no plans to do so soon.

Oh my goodness this is how I am going to make quiche from now on.  I used leftover mashed potatoes and added one egg to the potato mixture as other reviews suggested.  I still used the 3 eggs in the quiche mixture. Also, I used half and half instead of milk in the quiche mixture. I did not add nutmeg. I used what veggies I had on hand, which were onion and red bell pepper. This quiche turned out light and airy just like in the fancy restaurants. I might add baking soda next time to get it rise more. DELICIOUS!

Delicious!  My crust did not get really firm as a pie crust would but I don't know if it would.  It was very flavorful.  Would make it again.  Might add fresh sated mushrooms and a little crumbled sausage or ham the next time.  But great exactly the way the recipe is written.

I made some small tweaks. I added chopped turkey bacon. I misread the ingredients and added the entire cup of milk to my potatoes but my husband loved it. I also used 4 eggs and will probably use 5 next time. I did not use the nutmeg and I used adobo with garlic powder instead. I will definitely be making this again.

I actually changed quite a bit, so I used this recipe as a base. For crust I sprinkled shredded cheddar on bottom of 10 inch glass pie dish. (The oils from cheese made it so it did not stick) I then mixed leftover mash potatoes from Thanksgiving with a some Italian bread crumbs & a teaspoon of flour (though I'm not sure if flour was needed). I then pressed the mixture on top of cheese to form crust and sprinkled again with crumbs. Baked for 15 minutes, then sprinkled more cheese on top. Baked another (maybe) 10 minutes which lead me to a nice crust to work with. (The cheese helped encase the potatoes to make a pretty solid crust that wasn't mushy like some comments have stated.) I then cooked zesty sausage in one pan, sauteed spinach, mushrooms, peppers, garlic, green onion etc. in another and transferred sausage and veggies to crust. Whisked 4 eggs w/ milk (I eyeball my recipes) and pepper, baked for 15 minutes then sprinkled just a bit more cheese on top (I love cheese) and baked 15 minutes more. I let it cool a bit, as the eggs are still cooking even out of the oven. It set up wonderful and my boyfriend really liked it. I know I changed a lot, but I only gave three stars because my first crust attempt like the recipe says didn't fair well. But without this recipe I wouldn't have known where to start.

I made this with cauliflower instead of broccoli, and 1 bunch of kale. I didn't pre-set the potato crust in the oven for 30 min because I forgot. So, the potato crust is mushy, which is fine since it mixes with the filling and tastes really good. I sauteed turkey bacon in butter which I added to the filling. I also sauteed chopped red onion in butter which I also added to the mixture. I omitted the cheese. I added in chicken flavor Stove Top stuffing into the mixture and cut up green onion and halved 6 cherry tomatoes.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I also some slight changes to it by substituting soy milk instead of regular milk and it came out fantastic. I sautéed the onion and warmed some frozen broccoli with about 2 tablespoons of water for 2 to 3 minutes for this recipe. My vegetarian boyfriend loved it!

Was easy and tasty. I used canned milk. I increased to 2 cups of cheese and added in some chopped red pepper. I cut up some small potatoes I had on hand and boiled those. I used a large metal spatula to press into my quiche dish. The cheese baked into a nice brown crust on top. Next time I will add in more peppers and maybe some fresh mushroom.

Like some others, I added eggs...5 in total.  I dusted the top of the mashed potatoes with garlic powder, and next time I might add a bit of cubed ham.  But even just the way this recipe was written it would be fantastic.

This was wonderful...not a crumb left!  The only change I made was to use Monterey Jack/Colby cheese instead of cheddar because we are not big plain cheddar fans.

I was struggling to find a recipe to use for a Passover seder that I could also use to satisfy my vegetarian parents. This was delicious! I was pressed for time so I used Simply Potatoes for the crust. I think they were too mushy though and even with extra time the crust never got crispy. It held the filler though and everyone really enjoyed it. It was more like a mashed potato dish than a quiche but it was a hit as my main vegetarian fare!

YUM YUM YUM! Wow, the potatoes really did it! I used instant spuds, but they were "high quality" instant spuds. 2 C of that to make the crust, which I also had to bake for about 40 minutes. In the egg mixture my only changes were: I used 1/2C milk (1%), 4 eggs (egg beaters), no onion, colby jack shredded cheese instead of cheddar, and I used garlic instead of nutmeg. So, they were pretty simple changes, and the dish was just amazing! Hubby and I had a hard time stopping eating. This WILL be made again.

This was really tasty. My crust didn't really get crusty but that's probably because I skipped the "brush with olive oil" step since I didn't have any. Still delicious though. :)

I really liked this, as I'm not much of a pie crust person.  They are too much fuss for me.  The only thing I would change about this would be to cut back on the amount of potatoes in the crust and I'd add a couple eggs as well.  But all in all I really liked this.  It went over well with everyone!

Awesome!  Your recipe calls for 1/4 cup of milk, and then later 1 cup of milk.  I either made the crust too wet or the quiche too wet.  In the future (everyone) please clarify where any duplicate ingredients go!  A novice like me needs to know.

This was a very tasty dish.  I had a bunch of problems with getting the crust right, though.  it was way too soupy, so I added some flour.  Still too soupy, so I microwaved it several times for a minute to turn the potatoes into more of a paste before I could do anything else with it.  That was a pain.  But other than that, it was good.  I will probably make this again.

This is a time consuming recipe. However, the quiche is delicious and it is worth giving some efforts to make it. You can also twist this recipe easily by adding any vegetables you like. I like adding mushrooms and carrots.

This is a lovely change from the classic pie shell quiche.  I baked the crust a bit longer than written and added a bit more cheese.  It was a hit with my family and at the party I took it to.

I had leftover mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving that I used to make this recipe. After pre-baking the potatoes for 30 minutes, they were slightly browned.  However, after adding the filling ingredients, and baking for 45 minutes, the bottom was not crispy.  It did not affect the taste whatsoever, as the recipe is still delicious.  The crust more blended with the filling rather than being a separate entity, like a typical pie crust.  It's a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes and is very flavorful!

Yum! I used egg substitute instead (3/4 cup), and shallots in place of the onion. I also added some roasted corn. I didn't have enough mashed potatoes for a full crust, so I used a square baking pan instead of a pie plate for a bottom crust. It came out nicely, is easy to serve, and I can see doubling this recipe and baking it in a 13x9 pan to take to a brunch potluck.

Yum. Thank you. I really liked the potato crust as a base to this. Will make & take for Holiday brunches.
I altered just a bit but stayed all over true to recipe.
My husband is a huge Garlic/Fresh Peppercorn/onion fan so I add them to almost everything I make. 
I did 2 garlic cloves (pressed) into mashed potato crust. Altered recipe by one small yellow onion, 2 eggs and 1 egg white (instead of 3 eggs)sauteed sliced mushrooms as well to broccoli mix. It is a keeper.

This is a very good basic quiche recipe.  I made it once as written.  The last time I made it I used more broccoli (3 cups), cheese (1.5 cups) and 4 eggs.  If you are on a tight budget this recipe is very good  as written.

This was very tasty...loved the mashed potatoes. It was easy, but time consuming. Not a quick-fix meal, but worth the time. I didn't have the cheese, so I used some chunks of cream cheese. I will definitely make this again.

this was a decent and fairly quick weeknight recipe.  i already had mashed potatoes on hand along with some fresh broccoli, so it came together quickly and was relatively tasty.  i added garlic, along with a mixture of cheeses (cheddar, provolone, romano - again, what i had on hand), and baked it in a small casserole dish instead of the pie pan.  i would make it again.

The potato crust was too oily and needed more salt to make it good. Not sure I would make this again.

I used brocoflower because the supermarket ran out of brocoli but still tasted great. Easy to make too. Taste good using frozen broccoli too.

...I tried this recipe because I liked the idea of a potato crust..I used 10 small peeled red potatoes and proceeded as written...The first thing you taste is the crunchy broccoli (small dice) and the egg..next I could taste the potato crust(crunchy on the edges more mashed in the center). Fairly good flavor..will try this again with more seasoning and cheese...thanks!!

I prepare this recipe for my celiac grandmother and mother. They love it, and I change things up from time to time by throwing in some sauteed bell peppers and sweet onions in place of the broccoli.

The taste of this dish was confused - a mixture of a twice baked potato with quiche mixed in.  It just didn't work.  No one in my family liked it.

My husband wasn't happy when I said I was going to make potatoes and brocoli. But after tasting it he said it was "kickass" and "awesome". He let me give 4 stars, while usually 3 is the best he ever gives even when it is yummy! Will definetly make it again thank you!

I make this all the time (well when I have the time, it is a little time consuming if you are freshly mashing potatoes)

To save time I used flavored instant mashed potatoes (we love garlic!).  I made 2 cups of instant spuds, and it was more than I needed.  Next time I'll use a cup.  Added mushrooms the first time I made it, and ham the second time. I received rave reviews !!! My husband went back for thirds!  Yummy!

I absolutely love this recipe.  Very easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.  I would recommend sauteing the onions before adding to the mix.  Otherwise, I found the onions to be too cruncy.

Great basic recipe for a different kind of quiche.  I usually add another potato and butter to the crust.  I also like to add one or two more eggs and for those non vegetarians leftover cooked ham or bacon.  Different varieties of cheese add to the flavor too!

Excellent!  I used instant potatoes instead of baked potatos.  Enough potatoes for serving of 4 people.  It turned out great.  My kids loved it.  I would cut the pepper in half though.  Also we omitted the onions.

The potato crust very tasty and healthy alternative to pastry. I didn't cook my crust for long enough so it was still quite soft. I would suggest 45 minutes. You can use any filling you like. I used sausages, onion, broccoli, cauliflower, ham and cheese. It was not a quick meal though as I had to cook all the ingredients first. But well worth the wait.

I added chicken and added more cheese, but it was great. I did leaveout the nutmeg. And I used bob evans mashed potatoes because I hate mashing potatoes.My hus band liked it. I'm making it again tonight.  Plenty of protein and after having gastric bypass surgery I need alot of protein.

This recipe was a tough one to rate.    It was good but not great.  I love mash potatoes, but not necessarily in this recipe.  The potatoes  stayed soft and I wasn't expecting the texture that I got, but the family and I liked  the flavor. With so many recipes out there  to choose from, I won't be making this again, not even to experiment with.

Have now made this quiche 3 times, trying something different with each batch. Mixed and followed some advice from the other comments and it came out beautifully.  So far the family favorite is broccoli and steak. Work favorite is spinach, mushroom, tomatoes and ground turkey. Found that when using some vegetables to cook and drain them first. Have and will use this recipe again.

Tasty but I expected a crisper (not mushy) "crust".  Might try it again using hash browns.

It was ok, I followed some if the good comments regarding adding 1 tablespoon of flour and egg into the mashed potatoes so  the crust stayed together, thank you cooks!! I would make it again, and try different variations. Gave it 3 stars because it was just ok, nothing out of the ballpark.

This was good with these changes:  I added fresh garlic to the potatoes while they were boiling.  I used half & half instead of milk (in all cases).  I added 2 Tbsp of grated parmesan cheese, black pepper and an egg to the mashed potato. I cooked the crust for 20 minutes on the bottom oven rack and then continued cooking in top of oven until lightly browned.   I used sharp cheddar cheese and seasoned salt .  I did NOT steam the broccoli first - this is not needed if you cut the broccoli in smaller pieces and use only the broccoli flower.

I pretty much followed the directions but added Adobo and butter to mashed potatoes. Also added adobo to the eggs. The only thing I wished I would have added was 1 or 2 more eggs. Wish I would read some previous reviews. But other than that my hubby and I really enjoyed.

I didn't realize until I began making the potatoes, there were no instructions on how much milk to put in the potatoes or egg mixture.  Which one do I put the cup of milk?  I guessed and the family loved it.  I will try it tomorrow.

Had tons of left over mashed potato and cooked broccoli from a luncheon, this was a delicious way to use it up. I did add an egg to the mashed potato to help firm it up, only used 1/2c milk in the eggs and omitted the nutmeg. Yum!

Wonderful quick and east dish, made a couple of additions for my taste, added mushrooms to onions, added turmeric, garlic and chilli for extra tang, only a little of each so be careful with spices.

Make sure crust is crispy and well browned before adding filling.  I ended up adding 2 more eggs and more milk to the filling.

I'm going to make this tmrw, but 3 potatoes to mash. and 10-12 oz frozen broccoli the first time because I have it on hand. I don't see the point of precooking the broccoli and i will not do that, my fresh or froz broccoli will go into the oven as is . I won't be using a pie pan for mine. Can't wait to taste it. Thanks. And i love nutmeg. It tastes great in many types of foods. People complaining because they aren't fans of or familiar with uses of nutmeg. I will definitely put it into mine. Yum. I am sure it is good with and without the nutmeg. I like many of the other suggestions from the other people too--thanks, and will also tweak mine to my own tastes, can add other ingredients and so on. This is a good basic idea.

I have not made this yet but read all instructions and read reviews. The original instructions say to bake the potato crust for 30 minutes. Seems like so many "cooks" have missed this and think they have come come up with this great idea to bake the potatoes crust first.  This looks like a great recipe and will give it a try just as written because that is the recipe.  Anything else makes it a different recipe.

I thought that this was a great recipe.  I just sprinkled a little nutmeg, instead of the full amount.   I cooked the potatoes in the microwave.  The crust really wasn't like a crust so much, but I was good with that.  It was a bit like having some mashed potatoes with my quiche which was a pretty good combination in my opinion.  Let's face it, potatoes certainly have more nutrition than a traditional crust.  I also made a not near as healthy, but quite tasty version with bacon.

All the other reviews are really good, I don't know why this just didnt turn out the same for me. 1st, the middle was still liquid-y after being in the oven for 50 mins, even though the recipe calls for 30-40 min. The top of the "crust" was getting burnt so I couldnt cook it anymore. Then, the crust never hardened. So when putting on plates it just came out like a casserole. Not a quiche type dish. And for us, there wasn't much flavor. Most of the flavor came from the bites with a lot of cheese in them. I don't have a steamer for the broccoli so I put them in a microwave safe bowl and covered the top with a paper plate. I also added a large dollop of butter to the broccoli and cooked in the microwave for 2 mins. This made them come out a lot better to me, than just cooking them without butter. I also omitted the nutmeg and added garlic powder instead. But I still couldnt taste much in the line of seasonings. I have no idea why this turned out so bad for me when most other reviews are practically 4-5 stars. :(

What a great way to use leftovers! Last night I had baked potatoes and broccoli, and this afternoon I enjoyed them in a whole different way. I DID make some substitutions (because of what I had on hand). I used mushrooms, chopped up small but raw, instead of onions and parmesan instead of cheddar. I also added garlic salt instead of nutmeg. It came out even better than I expected.

This is a great recipe, however I do agree with others that 5 eggs, and extra cheese makes it better. I also left out the nutmeg.

This tasted okay. It was a little bland for me. Also the potato crust just wouldnt crisp up for me. I baked it in the oven for 35 min before adding the filling because I was running out of time (and patience). It was good for using up old broccoli and potatoes but otherwise just so-so.

Unfortunately for the time it took to prepare, this was a dissapointment. It was just very bland, so definately not worth all the prep.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. It took a lot of effort to prepare and I was unimpressed with the results. How could something with so many delicious ingredients taste so bland!  I won't be making this again.

This is my first attempt at a quiche.  The recipe was simple and quick, and had great presentation as well.  Yummy, warm comfort food! Could easily do many variations to taste, as others mentioned.  Will be making this again!

This was very good. I made it for a potluck and everybody really liked it. It was best right away. I made an extra one to have the next day. It was not as great because the crust got soft and seemed more like part of the quiche than a crust. Oh well.

A very good quiche. I used it during Passover (since there's no crust), and it was extremely good, save for it being just a little bit "damp," despite a longer-than-listed cooking time.

This is a great, easy recipe and is always good.. I use instant mashed potatoes because it's easier and faster, and shallots instead of onions.  I make it in a springform pan.  Like the nutmeg in it and also usually add a 4th egg.  Also add at least 2 cloves of garlic every time. Great recipe; one of my faves!  Save a slice for lunch tomorrow; still great the next day!

Amazing recipe...for people who dont eat egg you can use white sauce n another addition is add cheese and jalapenos on the top of the quiche. I made it for my friend n he thought it was delectable.

I loved this.  It was a little time consuming but well worth it.  I can't wait to make it again.  Note:  if you are using stoneware (ie: Pampered Chef) it will take more time to cook the crust and the quiche.

I tried this recipe as a dinner dish.  Worked out pretty good, but I did make a few modifications.  I added about 2 tablespoons of onion and chive cream cheese when mashing the potatoes and it was awesome.  I also put some parsley and parmesan cheese in the egg mixture.  The only problems I had with this recipe was that I made it for the first time in an oven I am not used to!  My husband chowed down!

This is a great stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal that will keep you going all day long. Great flavor, but I would halve the onion amount and double the cheddar cheese, maybe add some red peppers or tomatoes.

Very good. The "crust" wasn't very crusty and it was a little time consuming, but I would make it again. I left out the onion and pepper and used vegetable oil in place of olive oil.

maybe i did something wrong.... but i followed the recipe down pat.  the potato didn't turn into any form of crust.  i may as well have just made one big frittata.  the inside quiche bit was good though.  i'm not going to try this again, it is very time consuming.

This was okay.  I was looking for a recipe shell, but wasn't impressed with the crust.  If I made this again, I would cook crust longer or use uncooked potato rounds.

This is just an ok recipe...I used leftover mashed potatoes but it never quite got that "crust" part going.. am going to try it again tho...I added ham and reduced the milk to make it more of a fritatta for breakfast, I think it just needs tweaking!

I really liked this - good comfort food. I sauteed the onions first and added a little garlic. Also kept the crust in to cook longer to get it really crispy.

This quiche was very good.  I ended up using three potatoes instead of two.  I found it a bit difficult to remove from the quiche pan as the mashed potatoes were not as firm as a normal pie would be.  I was also a bit more generous with the salt and sauteed the onions beforehand.  Generally a good recipe, but next time I think I will stick with the regular crust.

This recipe is quite generic but the beautiful part is the potato crust.  I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian who does NOT like pastry.  This recipe led to a new appreciation for quiche!  I've made it with spinach and veggie sausage, asparagus and veggie ham ... the key to success is the wonderful potato crust!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I cooked the mashed potato crust for about 10 minutes longer than suggested, until it was golden brown. Thanks for a recipe I'll use over and over.

Great recipe. My husband could not tell me enough how much he enjoyed this. It's a little time consuming, but well worth the added effort. A+

Good recipe. I added hot red peppers rather than nutmeg.

Tastylicious!  Not as quiche'y' I was expecting - maybe I'll try it with an extra egg next time.
