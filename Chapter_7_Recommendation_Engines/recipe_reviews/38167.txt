I made this for my mom for mother's day. To reduce fat, I used 1 lb of boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into chunks and 1lb of medium large cooked shrimp. I also used one box of dirty rice mix and one of red beans & rice. It also came in handy to not use all of the seasoning pack. I also used Pam garlic spray instead of cloves of garlic. This is not a recipe for those who like bland foods! :-)

Very flavorful, but the recipe calls for too much meat.

Just so so...  If anyone finds any exceptional Paella recipes out there, please post them here.  Basically, this didn't taste as good as what I tried in Barcelona; it was too bland.  I had leftovers but ended up throwing it away because it just didn't sound good after my first encounter.

This is good.  I substituted the water with chicken stock.  Also, I seasoned the shrimp and chicken with Creole seasonings.

I made this for the 4th. of July because my wife had to work that day and her and I could not get enough, we both loved this dish. The only thing I will change the next time I make this is to add another pound of crawfish. excellant recipe, easy to prepare even for an old fart like me.

If you can get Rabideaux sausage out of Iowa, LA, it is out of this world.  Also, I think sauteeing the white part of green onions and adding the green tops at the end will give this more Cajun flair.

This has an unbelievable taste! Even my 18 month solds ate it! I added the crawfish too early seeing they were bought already cooked so dont make the same mistake. Add them in later so they arent rubber!

This was ok. It had a lot of flavor but I felt the flavor was a little off. It just seemed to be missing something. Can't put my finger of what is missing. I might make this again but will use a different Zatarain's mix, maybe the Jambalaya Mix.

This was good, not great.  The package dirty rice mix has quite a bit of sodium and it becomes the overwhelming flavor of the dish.  Definitely easy.

I made this recipe without making any changes and there was too much liquid left when I opened the lid.  Next time I will boil it all the way down to almost no liquid, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, that's always a foolproof method.  Otherwise, my boyfriend loved it!

Wonderful dish!  This is a good one to just toss together quickly.  The boxed dirty rice has enormous amounts of sodium, so we won't eat this too often.

I omitted the peppers and mushrooms, and substituted extra shrimp for the crawfish becuase my store was out. Otherwise followed the recipe. This was AWESOME. Will definitely make this dish again.

My family and friends love this recipe.  I modified and only used shrimp and crawfish and no mushrooms.  I also added cream of chicken to make it more creamy.  I'm making it again today with just shrimp (store didn't have crawfish yesterday).  I'm sure it will be a hit again.

3/4 of a medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, doesn't sound like very much. But, what do I know? I haven't tried it yet, but it makes my mouth water just reaading it.
