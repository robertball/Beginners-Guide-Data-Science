I made this as written. It was delicious! Thank you for sharing! Reminds me of being a kid and my grandmother making stuffed cabbage with it simmering on the stove for hours.

I've made this three times now and keep getting requests to make it again.  I used to buy the ready-made frozen ones, but my family won't even consider those, now!  This recipe is wonderful!!!

Had originally planned on making these my usual way on the stove but decided to give my InstaPot a try.  Only thing different was the rice wasnâ€™t cooked prior and it called for 2 cans of tomato sauce.  I only had one so I used a jar of pasta sauce.  Turned out delicious!!  Best part was how easy it was to steam that cabbage and peel the leaves off!

This makes a LOT of cabbage rolls. Next time, though, I will soften cabbage on stove top, and use a little less tomato sauce. Otherwise: easy and delicious!

I loved the fact that the rice was uncooked but so tender when the product was finished. Very Delicious!

Although the recipe is quite nice, the prep and cook times need to be updated.

Would probably add more seasonings next time and go back to using a pot of boiling water to separate my cabbage leaves, but the rolls were really good and loved by all of us.

Off the charts good.  Quick and very easy.  Used Foodi, but directions were roughly the same.

Got a instant pot for Christmas and have used it at least twice a week since then. My husband asked if we could make Cabbage Rolls, or as my mother called them "Grumpkies". We made them and couldn't have been more pleased! So easy with the easy pre-cooking of the cabbage that way.

Cooking cabbage for 9 min is not long enough... I put in for another 9 min.... the few leaves that were done were ok but maybe my cabbage was too big?

Have 3 qt instant pot so cut recipe in half.  Also - cabbage won't fit in 3 qt instant pot so need to steam/cook cabbage in some other fashion.  Finished product had good flavor - will make it again with adaptations "outside" the instant pot.
