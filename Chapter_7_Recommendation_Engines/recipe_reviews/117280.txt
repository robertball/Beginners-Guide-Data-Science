THIS RECIPE WAS THE BEST!!   I MADE A LITTLE  "WELL" FOR THE FILLING! I USED CHERRY PIE FILLING (ABOUT 1 CUP) INSTEAD OF PEACH PRESERVES  -- AND 1/2 TSP. OF ALMOND EXTRACT TO THE DOUGH, INSTEAD OF 1 TSP. -- AND ADDED 1/2 TSP. OF VANILLA TO THE CREAM CHEESE MIXTURE!    OUTSTANDING -- BUT MUST CHILL OVERNIGHT!   I THINK THIS WILL BE MY NEXT CHRISTMAS MORNING SURPRISE! IT MAKES A VERY PRETTY PRESENTATION WITH THE TOASTED ALMONDS ON TOP!!  THANK YOU, JODY!!!!    Sandy, Sacramento, CA.

This is the best coffee cake recipe I've ever tried, and I've tried plenty. I've used all flavors of preserves and I've replaced the preserves with 1 cup of various pie fillings. If you cut the cold butter into the flour mixture using a food processor, the texture of the cake is so incredibly tender. TRY THIS RECIPE! You'll love it.

This is my favorite recipe for coffee cake by far!  Was a hit with everyone.  I didn't have the peach preserves, so I used canned peaches and thickened them with cornstarch on the stove before adding them to the cake.  It was fabulous!

Luscious and moist, and lovely light creamy taste.  I did not have peach preserves on hand, so I took a package of frozen peaches, defrosted and drained them. Then I added just a touch of sugar because the freezing methond that I use sweetens them enough that not a lot of sweetener is needed when adding them to recipes.  I put this on the cream cheese mix instead of the preserves and it turned out great.

It was great! I made it for a bridal shower, beautiful presentation and it was so yummy! I used a whole cup of apple topping/jam. The only change I would make would be to add some vanilla to the cream cheese. Very good coffee cake!

Scrumptious coffee cake.  Very moist and dense texture.  I substituted lowfat plain yogurt for the sour cream and added one finely diced fresh peach to the batter.  Everyone at work loved it.

This is the best coffee cake ever!! I made it 3 times last Christmas and friends and family loved it.  I'm making it again. I use Chunky "homemade" peach preserves. I have only made it with peach.  Tastes like a rich cheesecake for brunch.  A great treat!  Perfect for  Christmas morning.  I like it best warmed a little in the microwave before serving.

I made this coffee cake for my Mother for a Mother's day brunch. She said it was the BEST coffee cake she ever tasted!
I substituted raspberry jam for the peach but I think any fruit jam would be delicious. The sour cream keeps the cake moist and the cream cheese adds a lovely layer of flavor.
ENJOY!

Mine cooked for quite a bit longer than the time called for, and my topping didn't quite get browned - maybe because I left out the almonds?  This was very easy to prepare but didn't have that "wow" factor for me, even though everyone at work liked it.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy, easy, easy!  And so very good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The directions were easy to follow, even at 5:00 in the morning.  The taste was wonderful.  My family loved it!

This is an excellent cake.  I have passed the recipe on to many others.  I do recommend making it in an oblong pan so the cake doesn't take as long and doesn't dry out. Peach preserves are ok, but I'd recommend using something a bit tangier like apricot or cherry.

I have to be honest, this recipie was not only confusing , difficult to execute .. it didnt come out well .. 

While it looked beautiful the flavor was definately lacking . IF I were to make this again - I would NOT use peach preserves and it didnt hold its flavor-  ( perhaps a more saturated flavor would like a blueberry compote) .. I would bring some kind of flavor into the cheese filling because it was just so bland - and for me . the cooking time needed to be increased by almost 45 minutes.

Ive had worse desserts but this one wasnt anything to write home about .

WOW This is a really delicious recipe, I left off the almonds and used boysenberry spreadable fruit.  One of the best cakes I've had and was very very easy to make.

The dough was VERY sticky, I had to use flour on my fingers to pat the dough into the pan. The filling with the preserves was gooy in the middle. Taste overall was good; I'll try making it again in a 13x9 pan the next time.

My rewiew is not so good as others', I'm afraid. It was not bad - I made it with strawberry preserves - but definitely I've had better. My daughter said that apart from the filling, the cake itself stuck in her throat...

I searched a few of my local grocery stores but couldn't find peach preserves. I substituted with apricot preserves. This coffee cake was a hit at my office bake sale! Weeks later and everyone's still raving over it.

This was a little heavier and richer than traditional coffee cake, a bit more like the texture of a scone but still very good and it turned out beautifully!

I made this cake last night and brought it to my Sunday School class this morning.  It was a hit! I was a little unsure while putting this cake together that I was doing the right thing, since you have to put the batter on the sides of the pan and on the bottom of it - it says to pat it on - I used my spatula to put it on because it is too wet to pat.  I also made my own peach filling with fresh peaches.  I used probably 2 cups of fresh peaches cut up with 3/4 cup of sugar and 3 T. of cornstarch and brought to a boil and then simmered until it thickened.  This made it taste very fresh. I also added vanilla to the cream mixture since others had made this comment. The cake looked beautiful and tasted wonderful.  It's a lot of work - but well worth it.
