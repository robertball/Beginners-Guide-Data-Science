this recipe is a great one; not only for taste but they are so easy to whip up at last minute.  These are sure to go over at any event or function.  I love the versatility of the add-ins also.  I used up peanuts, butterscotch morsels, semi-sweet, and a few holiday M&M's I had on hand.  I think next time, I'll double the recipe and use a larger pan.  These are not a thick bar using a 9x13.

I added butterscotch chips  to the batch, and I used chopped almonds instead of walnuts. Really liked the results!

Super easy base recipe.  This can easily be tailored to your tastes.  Not overly sweet.  Perfect with vanilla ice cream!
