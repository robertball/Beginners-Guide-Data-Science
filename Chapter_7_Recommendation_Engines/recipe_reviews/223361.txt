This recipe was simple, easy and turned out awesome. The thinner slices of eggplant made a crispy dish even after the sauce. My eleven month old son even had seconds.

wow! This is a delicious recipe. The smoked mozzarella is excellent and will be a permanent substitution for plain mozzarella in future Eggplant Parmesan dishes.  I come from a long line of Italian cooks who are known for this dish. That said, I was happy to find a recipe that deviated from the usual way we make it. I am a basil fan so I did add extra basil. My Nonie insists that you must dip in flour first before the egg and bread crumbs. Since I have grown up with that step , I do it automatically now. Not sure if it even makes a difference!  Just when I thought I couldn't improve on the family recipe, I did! We make our own sauces and freeze for future use. I chose the caramelized onion and red bell pepper sauce which went great.  Next time I am making a double batch! Oh thank you for this jewel of a recipe!

Delicious!!!  My 7 year old asked for thirds!  I used regular mozzarella instead of smoked, and laid the eggplant slices flat on a cookie sheet rather than layering them in a baking dish.  Amazing, great recipe, thanks!

Great recipe! Unfortunately, my store didn't have smoked mozzarella, but I used fresh and it was still good. I took another person's advice and dipped the eggplant in flour before the egg/milk mixture. It helps the breadcrumbs stay on!

Loosely followed this recipe. Up sized to make a 9" x 13" dish (1 large & 1 medium eggplant, and 2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce). Tried the recipe’s method of not flouring the eggplant before dipping in egg mixture/bread crumbs, and the adhesion was not good . . . Nonie’s method (Mom of five’s review) of first dipping in flour is much better. Sautéed onions and fresh garlic, and then simmered with the marinara sauce to give it more flavor. Like others, used regular mozzarella after being unable to find smoked mozzarella cheese given limited time. I’m pretty sure this cheese is available at a local deli and will pickup some to make this again. I found this more involved and time consuming to make than anticipated . . . take note of the 20 minutes to 2 hours suggested for drying out the eggplant. I did 30 minutes after checking a few other recipes, and that seemed fine. With more than an hour into cutting, drying, and frying the 2 eggplants, the fried slices were placed in fridge for later use that afternoon. That is the major time factor, and the dish comes together quickly after those steps are completed. This eggplant dish is very, very good. In trying to make a healthier version while hopefully not sacrificing taste, next time plan to follow the method of baking the eggplant detailed in Crunchy Eggplant Parmesan on this site, and then finishing it off by using steps 3, 5, and 6 of this recipe. Thanks lindseytr0n.

Atempting to have a meatless Monday with my hubby and kids.  This turned out to be a meatless Wednesday instead.  LOVED this recipe!  Kids loved it too which is surprising because they don't like much.  The only thing I changed was that I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  This was only because I didn't have bread crumbs available.  I served this with spaghetti squash and garlic bread.  Will surely use again!  Thanks for sharing.

This is incredible. My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it, and we had a lot of leftovers so I took it in to work for my employees to try- it was gone within 3 hours and everyone said they absolutely loved it! :-) I did make the tomato sauce from scratch, and followed review suggestions to dip the eggplant in flour before the egg and bread crumbs- it worked beautifully. This is a definite favorite- I'll be making it often!

Very good!  The skin is rather tough, but the flavor was great.  My kids aren't too picky, but this was definitely not a remake for them.

This recipe was amazing!! My kids loved it. I had never made eggplant before and probably only tasted it once (yuck). But my daughter asked to try eggplant so I bought one at the store and found this recipe. I had to use twice the egg and all the breadcrumbs in the house. I also could have made it in a 9X13 pan as it almost overfilled my 9X9. I couldn't figure out the layer exactly if sauce was supposed to go in each layer, but I forgoed it in a few layers to save on space. Truly an amazing dish, even if it was a lot of work! Totally worth it!

Unbelievably delicious...and I don't even like eggplant...smoked mozzarella ,fresh basil and panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs make this a super easy and super delicious dish. Be sure to slice the eggplant thinly...yummy!

I made this last night for some friends we had over and every single person had 3 servings and kept asking what was in it!  One guy, the vegetarian, said it's the best eggplant parm he's had in a long long time.  I think the smoked mozzarella makes a huge difference.  You don't need a lot.  I added shredded mozzarella to fill in the spaces bc the smoked moz didn't seem like enough cheese.

This was very easy to make and very yummy! I used regular mozzarella cheese and seasoned the bread crumbs with pepper and parsley. Would make this again for sure.

Although I don't eat eggplant, this is a very good recipe.

Recommendations: Don't buy canned/jarred marinara sauce. If you make this recipe, prepare your own marinara. Marinara has uses as an ingredient in other recipes.

This is my new favorite recipe. I've made it 3 times & noticed the more the basil, the better. I also prep my eggplant to sit 1-2 hours. It seems to taste better the longer you drain the eggplant juices. Eating them after being fried is delicious, also. I may make that a future appetizer with a nice sauce...possible a chipotle ranch. Thank you for making me realize eggplant is delicious!

Really yummy and easy to prepare, although frying the eggplant took longer than I thought. I made my own breadcrumbs, which I felt was a positive change. I also didn't use fresh Parmesan, which was good, but next time I'll use fresh. Despite this, the dish tasted really fresh and was not too cheesy. I used a lot of basil because I love it. Finally, I used regular mozzarella instead, because I couldn't find smoked. I'm hoping to find it for next time! My husband said: 'better than a restaurant!', and he's not a gushing complimenter :)

It turned out so well! I did a little shortcut when it come to frying it, I just used the air fryer, but it worked out. I didn’t get to take a picture of the finished product, but I do have my plate.

I have never had eggplant before, so I was happy to try this recipe, I also added garlic and onion powder to it, my family loved it , my daughter had 3 helpings which surprised me as she usually doesn’t eat much. This is a keeper and now eggplant is a favourite of mine.

I liked this recipe but would peel the eggplant.I find the skin to be tough and bitter. My Italian husband tried this but rejected it for the bitterness.

I'm not an experienced cook but I did it! You can too! Couldn't find smoked mozzarella but regular worked fine. It was delicious. Will make it again as a special meal since it was pretty time consuming.

Great recipe.  Freezes well.  We used creole tomatoes and sweet onions in season.

I made this yesterday and it was delicious. Even my husband who doesn't like eggplants enjoyed it. I used regular mozzarella and l didn't rinse of the salt and pat dry. 

I'll definitely make again!!

Loved it, the smoked mozzarella made it! Make sure to slice the eggplant thinly. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a jar of marinara sauce and it was still quite juicy without being soggy.

I doubled the amounts for two families. Delicious and cheesy. Made one with gluten-free breadcrumbs and no flour and I think that was the small difference in taste from the normal one. Still, very good.

This was wonderful! The advice on sweating the eggplant was amazing, it wasn't soggy at all! The only change I made was used panko instead of breadcrumbs, made it crispier. I had many many compliments on this, thank you for a great recipe!

Excellent!!! I only changed the part of adding less sauce, I added a tablespoon to each piece of eggplant verse layering it on everywhere. I don't particularly like eggplant, but this recipe exceeded my low expectations by far. Plus we made it with a side of pasta to mix together while eating.

You won't believe it but I made this as stated but used a very large Zucchini out of my yard and it was wonderful. Zucchini has a lot of water also. Thanks for the great idea for using my Zucchini.

I don't think I let the water drain from the eggplant long enough and it was a bit soggy. I also could not find smoked mozzarella in my town and so had to go with plain.

Excellent recipe!  Kept right to recipe except for 1 difference - used regular mozzarella instead of smoked. Can't say this made a difference because we haven't made  before.  Delicious!!

I drained pressed the eggplant like the author suggested and fried in small batches. I did peel my eggplant. I discovered that I don't really care for eggplant. Imserved it over angel hair pasta. I also would add another jar of sauce or use a large jar.

This was a delightful recipe.  I salted the eggplant and left it in one layer on paper towels, with a paper towel on top.  I accidentally left them out for about 4.5 hours.  I started out using "Nonni's method" as mentioned in some of the other reviews (dipping the eggplant in flour before the egg and then breadcrumbs) but forgot halfway through and realized it was actually working better without the flour.  I theorize that it has to do with whether you've let them sit a long time with salt or not.  I fried mine on a griddle with only a teeny bit of oil.  The resulting dish was really great, the eggplant wasn't soggy and my kids loved it (2 and 4 years old).  Definitely recommend it.

Amazing!!! We loved it. I used regular mozzarella cheese, but I bet it is even better with smoked mozzarella cheese.
