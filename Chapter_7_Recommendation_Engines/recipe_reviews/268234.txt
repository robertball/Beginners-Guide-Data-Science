This was a pretty easy way to make borscht in the Instant Pot. It definitely needs quite a bit of salt to make the flavors pop. I think maybe using vegetable broth instead of water would have  helped. Maybe a bit of tomato paste, or vinegar/lemon juice for depth of flavor. This definitely makes a lot, so I'll be freezing half for later. I left out the green bell pepper because I forgot to buy one. TIP: use a food processor to quickly shred the beet and carrot.
