This is my new hard boiled egg recipe. This is just unbelievable and so easy. I will add another minute to cooking time since I have a 3.5 qt air fryer. I had no trouble peeling the eggs after the ice bath. Thank you so much for this new way of making hard boiled eggs and adding it to my growing wonderful air fryer recipes.
