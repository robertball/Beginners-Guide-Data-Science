Great recipe.  Although I tweeked slightly.  I used boiled chicken instead of canned.  I also used celery insteady of green beans and sauteed the onions, celery and carrots in the bacon grease.  Then followed the recipe with the execption of adding some more spices.  Will make great left overs.!

Oh.  Wow.  This is by far one of the best stews I have had in my entire LIFE! Very delicious and yummy.  I did make some modifications, as I doubled the recipe because this was made for a woman who just had a baby.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 3 cloves of fresh garlic, a red onion, and replaced the water with chicken broth.  I did not have potatoes, so I substituted dinner rolls as the starch/bread.  I also simmered it for a bit longer, because I like my carrots to melt in your mouth and the onions to be super duper soft as well.  Very flavor and yummy.  Thanks!

this was great - although I would leave out the green beans, or use sweet peas instead.

This recipe was delicious and easy to cook while doing other things (like rotating loads of laundry on a Sunday).  I did make a few changes. First, I doubled the recipe to have leftovers.  For the double recipe, I poached 4 chicken breasts (about 2lbs of chicken), cooled them, and put them in the fridge, then chopped them up when I started cooking.  I used two cans Campbell's cream of chicken with herbs soup, and I added about 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper for a little zip.  I liked the green beans for color - frozen peas would work well too.  And we served it up in bowls with mashed potato underneath.  Yum.

This is great and comes together easily.  I doubled the bacon and browned it right in the same pot as I was going to make the stew in, also added plenty of chopped garlic since my husband has an onion allergy.  After draining the bacon fat, I just left the bacon in the pan and added everything else.  I highly recommend using chicken broth instead of water as it will give you a richer flavor (low sodium is fine since the soup is plenty salty) also, I used cream of chicken with herbs.  I did also double the recipe.  It is great left over!

This was a huge hit at dinner. I did make some changes for lack of ingredients. I used leftover cooked chicken breast instead of the canned stuff, I didn't have any bacon but threw in some cubed ham instead, I used canned green beans, I didn't have any oregano, but I seasoned it with salt and pepper. I served it with buttermilk biscuits and there were no leftovers of either one of those. I will definintely make this again, it is quick and easy and great use for leftover chicken.
