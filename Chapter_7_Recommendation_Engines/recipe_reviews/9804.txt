Tip #1: Finely ground oatmeal for a subtle nutty taste and texture. Don't grind if you prefer a rougher, more dense cookie that tastes more like an oatmeal cookie with chips. Tip #2: Using unsalted butter will make cookies spread more while using a margarine will make them spread less and be thicker. Tip #3: Add 1/2 tsp more of baking soda for a higher rising cookie. Tip #4: These cookies are extra extra sweet so you may want to reduce sugars to 3/4 cup each to lessen sugary taste. Tip #5: I found 1.5 cups of choc. chips more than enough for me. But, true chocoholics should try 2 cups of the chocolate chunks instead. Tip #5: Watch cookies very carefully. Cooking times may range from 7-10 minutes depending upon the cookie size you choose, your texture preference, and your oven's temperature settings. They may look undercooked, but you'll get a crunchy edge and soft chewy inside if you bake just until the outer edge only is brown.  Let them set 1 minute on the cookie sheet after removing them from the oven to finish cooking them and you'll get a perfectly chewy but not soogy cookie. Over-cooking (entire cookie is brown) will definitely result in a hard crispy cookie, unless you like them that way.  Tip #6: This is a lot of dough so you can either halve the recipe or store the dough in your frig. in a platic zipper bag so you can make a fresh batch when the mood strikes you.

Perfect! A new favorite for my husband and me. He couldn't get enough of them!  Here are the slight changes I made which resulted in a perfect, thick chocolate chip cookie...I used margarine (1 stick lite, 1 stick regular). Margarine helps cookies stay plump rather than flat.  I let my eggs reach room temperature, and was careful not to overblend them with the dough (another common problem with cookie bakers).  Lastly, I added 1/2 tsp more of baking soda and 1/4 tsp more of baking powder to help the cookies stay thick.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a T using Ghirdelli (sp?) chocolate chips.  I noticed some people said the dough got stuck in their mixers, but if you look at the recipe closely, you will notice it says to STIR the batter once you mix in the dry stuff...do not use your mixer at this point. Good luck! This is quite a perfect cookie!:-)

The funny thing is, I don't really like chocolate chip cookies all that much - I just wanted something for my kids to send to my husband (who was working out of town), but DANG these are good! They stay dense and moist, not fluffy and cake-y like other recipes I've tried, and it's all chunk with a just a little cookie holding it all together!! The last time I made them, I used 1/2 cup each of walnuts, pecans and macadamia nuts, and substituted almost 1/2 of the semi-sweet chips with a Hershey Bake Shoppe product called Almond Toffee Bits - basically the inside of a Heath bar, but in perfectly uniform little chunks and with no mess and frustration of chunking up the candy yourself. Really great!  Oh, and if you really want to go overboard, make an ice cream sandwich with a couple of these bad boys!

These are IT!! Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookies. If you don't like your cookie too sweet, reduce the amount of brown sugar and white sugar to 3/4 cup. Please don't omit the grated chocolated as well as the ground oats. It makes a world of a difference in taste and texture. For those reviewers who left out the grated chocolate, try it again and you'll taste a difference. I've also found that I get a better looking cookie when I mix the batter by hand rather than with an electric mixer. The trick is to let the butter soften at room temperature or pop it in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds. Make sure not to let it melt though! It alters the appearance and texture of your cookie. 

These cookies do take quite some time to prepare so be sure to make a huge batch and freeze the rest of them. Everyone who tastes these delectable treats raves about them and will beg you to make them. I love to bake and do it quite often. These are the most requested treats by my family and friends.

OK these are five + star cookies as is-I make all the time and people rave about them(minus the nuts)..but you MUST try this.  With halloween coming I needed to clear out all existing candy in my house so instead of grating a regular chocolate bar..I stuck some mini snickers, twix, m&m's, baby ruth's, and hershey bars into a food processor and blended it up nice and added that to the cookie (maybe 10 mini bars altogether).  OOOOHHHHH my it was so good the next day I had to make another batch using the same candy bars and even mixed in some reeses p-butter cups and a whatchamacallit bar.   Even better.  Now I can't wait for my kids to bring home all their trick or treats so I can make yet another batch...My co-workers love me this week!  TRY IT...IT"S SO YUMMY!!

I left the oats whole, and used chocolate baking chunks instead of the smaller chips, but believe me when I say I have NEVER had a more delicious chocolate chip cookie.  They stayed soft after being out uncovered all night, then remained soft in a ziplock bag for 5 days. I will make this my only chocolate chip recipe from here on out. Thanks for the submission!

I will not try again. Even with all of the chocolate it is very bland and very dry. Reread the reciped several times to be sure that I wasn't leaving anything out and that I had read it correctly - I had and they turned out bad. Did anyone in the past have tips for a cookie that is not so dry?

I halved the recipe, didn't have any nuts to add (but I would add pecans if I had them), added 1/2 cup peanut butter, and used old-fashioned oats. This recipe produces a slightly chewy, slightly crispy, tasty cookie. I like the depth the grated chocolate adds. Great cookies Rene!

I got compliments like I couldn't believe from my co-workers after bringing these in these cookies.  I got raves...I mean RAVES from people who usually just take a cookie and run.  You must measure accurately with this cookie...or you'll have a rock hard piece of dough/oatmeal that will wear the motor on the best of mixers. I use an icecream scoop to make large cookies that don't spread out all over the pan.  I like to "change" receipes but this is one that I'll always make exactly the same.  The compliments make the mixing worth while!

Wish I could give this more than 5 stars! I've been making this recipe for over 20 years now...it costs a small fortune to make but is worth it every time. My tip: grind the milk chocolate with the oats in the food processor rather than grating it seperately. Fabulous cookie! And they freeze excellent (if they last that long)! Great for the holidays!

I read through some of the reviews and there were a few people this didn't work out for. Since they are so good I thought I would share a couple of 'cookie' tips I learned:
- Bake for 8 minutes, take pan out of the oven and leave it on the pan for a minute or two. To get moist cookies part of the baking need to occur outside the oven
- Don't skip the grated chocolate, use bakers squares if you can't find any bars
- Mix it with clean hands, this is way too thick a dough to mix it well with a spoon!

Thanks so much for the recipe! Since finding this recipe last year, I have made these cookies dozens of times!  They stay soft and delicious for days and are now my standard cookie recipe.  I generally keep to the recipe, but I always grind the oats finely in a food processor - it's MUCH faster than a blender and does not get so over-worked.  Also, and this goes for any cookie recipe, try placing the eggs in hot water for a few minutes while you cream the butter, etc.  Warmer eggs make lighter cookies!  Just stick to the original recipe, and you'll be rewarded with INCREDIBLE choc. chip cookies!

A very good cookie!  I made these and I doubled the recipe, added 2 t. cinnamon and 1 T. instant coffee granules to the dry ingredients.  WOW!  Did that make it pop!  (I also made it without cinnamon and it was still amazing and had that "little something extra" from the coffee.)  I also used Splenda in place of 1/2 of the white sugar and you can't tell the difference, so next time I will use all Splenda instead of white sugar.  The instant coffee granules added tremendous flavor, yet it's subtle enough that my kids and husband never knew it was in there.  I used Old Fashioned Oats as that's what I buy, and it gave it a nice chewy texture.  If the oatmeal is ground finely, you can't really detect that it's there- which is great when you're wanting more of a chocolate chip cookie, but if you're wanting more of an oatmeal cookie texture, don't grind it as finely.  The best cookies use real butter, pure vanilla and a high quality chocolate.  (I used Ghirardelli).  If you don't like it too chocolatey, just use less chocolate chips.  I refrigerated the dough for an hour before rolling them into little balls and then stuck the dough back in the fridge between batches.  I also used parchment paper on my cookie sheets (no greasing required).  I baked those for 9 min. and let set on pan for 5 more before removing to racks to cool.  I also made "monster" cookies with an ice cream scoop (1/4- 1/3 c. approx.) fitting 6 to a pan and baking for 14 min. instead of 9.  They're a HUGE hit.  E

Not worthwhile. Nestle TollHouse are much better.  Tollhouse are soft and chewy, not these. These came out dry and I followed the recipe to a "T".

wow! Haven't had a homemade cookie this good in a long time. My 2 and 4 year old helped me make these, followed recipe exactly except we used margarine and the whole bag of chocolate chips. Super chocolately and so chewy good. This is my new oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe!

I followed the recipe carefully, though usually I just "wing it".  But, the cookies turned out blah.  The dough itself stayed together nicely and looked pretty, but they didn't have much taste.  Sooo disappointing because I craved Choc Chip Cookies!  I'll stick w/ toll house.

A friend asked for these for his birthday.  I made these just as the recipe is written...what a dismal disappointment.  I was embarrassed to give the cookies to him.  VERY very dry and definitely lacking in flavor.  Not quite sure why this gets raves.  Guess that's why there's all sorts of recipes.  Not a recipe I will repeat making, although I am glad I tried it.  You don't know until you try.:o)

Fantastic cookies.  I chose this recipe because I had only one teaspoon of vanilla left and needed to find one that worked with so little vanilla.  However, after reading the reviews, I decided to make some alterations of my own.  I cut down the amount of oats (used a little less than 2 cups) and made up for it with half a cup of whole wheat flour.  Even after I'd ground the oats and mixed it with the flour, I ended up leaving at least a cup of the mixture out.  I put in four cups of chocolate chips and didn't use any grated chocolate or nuts.  And finally, I included an extra egg yolk in the ingredients.  The cookies came out delicious.  They're not the big fat bakery kind of cookies, but if you're looking for some small, moist and chewy cookies, this is the perfect recipe.  They do indeed spread out in the oven - they come out incredibly flat.  But they aren't (to me) in any way asthetically displeasing, and the small flat shape makes the chocolate really stand out.

I've been making these cookies for years.  This is absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie recipe, more chips and nuts than cookie!  They are very dense and a little crunchy, not soft and "cakey" like some recipes.

Recently I have made my share of cookies, and though they were all good, this is by far the BEST!   The crispiness from the grated oatmeal, the heavenly chocolate with every bite, and the chopped walnuts, make this the perfect cookie for me!  I did add 1/2 tsp of ground saigon cinnamon (enhances chocolate for me), and 2 tbs of ground flax seed.  I have made this recipe twice in 2 days.  On today's batch, I used Hershey's special dark chocolate chips, and Ghiradelli bitter sweet bar I grated in food processor.  This is now my go to for cookies, and I will be making these for Christmas presents this year =).  Hope these work out for you, happy baking =)

I was really disappointed with the texture of these cookies - maybe I cooked them a little too long.  They were still delicious but not the same as the Macy's cookies from my childhood.

I so wanted to love these but I really didnt even like them (although I ate them but that is an issue of gluttony). They were dry, overly sweet, and fell apart.  Keep looking for new chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site.  There are many others to try that are delicious

These are THE BEST cookies to make! It's a great way to get some whole grains in there. I've made them by the recipe and have also done some different things with them- dark chocolate and coconut, cranberries with white chocolate, just add whatever you have on hand!

Okay, so as I am reading the recipe, I am thinking to myself - grinding the oats, grated chocolate?  Then I made the dough (only a half batch) and it seemed a little dry, but tasted amazing - yes, I eat cookie dough.  I proceded to bake these, and they didn't look all that good.  They were a little rough around the edges, they didn't spread into a perfect little round cookie.  I turned off my oven and decided only baking 12 of these was going to be enough.  My daughter and husband wandered into the kitchen (funny how that happens when cookies are baking), and each grabbed one.  They said, with their mouths full, these were some of the best chocolate chip cookies ever.  Back on went the oven and I made the rest of the batch.  Of course, I had to try one (or 4) of the cookies, and they really are darn good chocolate chip cookies.  Will for sure be making a full batch of these cookies soon.

I've made these cookies for years now and I always get tons of compliments. The only change I make is switching up the chips and nuts. My fav is to use half pecans and half walnuts and a mix of milk chocolate and semi-sweet. And make sure you take them out of the oven as soon as the edges start to brown. For a soft chewy cookie they almost don't look cooked enough. Great recipe!

These must be tasted to be believed!!! I didn't believe any cookie could be this good!! I made the recipe exactly as it was written, and I baked them for exactly 8 minutes. They came out of the oven very soft, but hey firmed up nicely as they cooled. The dough was very thick, and I had to mix in the chips, the grated chocolate, and the nuts with my hands. Then I shaped the dough into nice round balls and placed them on the sheet. They backed beautifully. Wonderful!! Like music for your mouth!!

I did exactly what the recipe called for and they tasted great right out of the oven. But they were dry and flaky two hours after and even worse the next day. I was disappointed.

I was so disappointed with this highly rated recipie.  After all the extra effort of following the recipie EXACTLY (blending the oats and grating the chocolate, etc.) these cookies turned out miserable.  This definitely does not earn five stars.  The grated chocolate looks like worms, the flavour is dry and crummy, and the dough NEARLY RUINED MY MIXER!!

So NOT worth the effort or hype!  Go to Neiman Marcus website for the real cookie recipe - way better and far less work. 
Also, if you have a hand mixer I wouldn't risk it...  My Kitchen Aid stand mixer could barely handle this too stiff dough.

Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie I´ve ever made!!! Also this is quite a versatile recipe, for I made four different batches and they all turned out fantastic. First I made one exactly as stated in the recipe (I only doubled the amount of vanilla) and my cooking time was 9 minutes flat, these were scrumptious. Then I made another batch without nuts, choc chips or shaved chocolate for my one year old (I did add up 1/2 cup more oats) these were moist, yummy and very healthy. Then I made another recipe without the chocolate shavings which gave me more classic cookies with that homey flavor, awesome. And finally I ommited all chocolates and nuts and added 2 cups of shredded coconut, mmmmmm deeeeeelicious. Thanks for a wonderful recipe now it is a family favorite!

This is bizzare! I was searching through my recipes and found the same one, except the ingredients were doubled. I have had this recipe for about 15 years, with the same story behind it, and didn't even know it. I have been searching for the ultimate choc. chip cookie recipe...and this one is it. They kinda remind me of the Otis Spunkmeyer cookies...but even better. If you are searching for the awesome cookie recipe, then this one is just what the doctor ordered. On a scale from 1 to 10...I rate this recipe an 11!

This was an excellent recipe. I made one small addition, which was I added a half cup more of milk chocolate. The cookies were great the day after as well. This recipe is added into my personal recipe book.

***UPDATE***Due to the fact that these did not taste good the next day, I continued my search. I took naples suggestion and tried the "Land O Lake" chocolate chip cookie recipe--she was right--it is THE best and is moist and delicious for a few days after (if they last that long)! ---Old review -->Hands down THE best chocolate chip cookie I have ever made. I have been on a search for the ultimate chocolate chip cookie and I am very confident that my search has ended here! I followed the recipe to a T and they are absolutely delicious! Moist! Chewy! Goodness! **UPDATE*** The only complaint I have about these is they don't keep well for long. So eat them by the 2nd day!!

The oats gave it such a nice nutty flavor and texture. I will leave the walnuts out next time, because then the nutty flavor and texture becomes a bit overwhelming. used 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar, make sure eggs are at room temperature, used 1 1/4 tsp. powder and 1 1/2 tsp soda. Make sure you don't overblend eggs with dough and baked around 8 minutes.

These cookies are the best! I'm not too crazy about walnuts, so I leave them out. When I need to bake for a small group, I like to roll 1/4 C of dough into a ball and bake for 12 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees (this make about 16 really big cookies). They turn out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I have to try the chopped Heath bars - that sounds yummy!

strange that these reviews are either "perfect" or "stuff"/"hard"/"crumbly" because mine came out too cake-like.  very fluffy, bready, etc.  i followed the recipe exactly, but substituted macadamia nuts for walnuts (i'm allergic), and they are simply horrible.  there are several other, better chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site.  i suggest people keep them in mind when they chose this recipe.

I do not like a too sweet cookie, so I decreased the sugars to 3/4 cup each based on other comments.  Also, I didn't want an oatmeal cookie so I used 2-1/2 cup flour and only 1 cup of oats.  Did not use the grated chocolate.  Measured 2 tablespoons of dough and shaped it into 2-inch disks before baking at 375F for 11 minutes.  Came out with great shape, texture and taste.

I don't get it.  These cookies didn't turn out at all.  When I was mixing up the batter, my beaters actually got clogged and I had to scrape it out from inside them.  The cookies didn't harden, spread, or even budge while baking. My boyfriend tried one and actually had trouble swallowing.  What did I do wrong?

This is a very good cookie. A little time consuming though. I cooked mine for 7 minutes after scooping them with a little scoop, and slightly flattening them with a glass.  They do not spread very much while baking.  I too chopped my chocolate in the food processor, and made sure my oats were ground to a powder.  This is a keeper.

A friend raved these cookies up to me so I thought I'd give 'em a whirl. They ARE good but good gracious! - they make alot and I'm not a cookie fan to begin with (my family is though). They seemed to like them but I can tell when a cookie recipe is about to become famous with them b/c they suddenly dissapear. Not the same can be said about these - there are plenty left in my tupperwear container...

These are excellent cookies!  I have never enjoyed chocolate cookies so much.  They are very dense, and freeze very well.  The preparation is a bit of a pain - the best way to deal with the bar of chocolate is with a food processor, and make sure your hand mixer can handle such heavy dough.  Even though they take a bit of extra time, I am sure you will find they are worth the effort!

These are the best cookies ever!  My family and friends get together for a cookie bake-off each year a few weeks before Christmas and this is the cookie we have to make.  When we mix the dry and wet ingredients together I make the men mix with their hands (it would be to hard for an everyday mixer).  After a few years of grating the Hershey bar by hand (made the men do this job too) we started using a Salad Shooter (works great).  This year I also made a batch substituting the chocolate chips for ½ the amount in toffee.  Oh my, another hit.  I brought them to work and have had a number of requests for the recipe.  It wouldn’t be Christmas without these cookies in our house.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have made.  I get rave reviews when I do.

This is the closest recipe to Neiman Marcus's famous choclate chip cookie recipe.  I had the original recipe from the nephew of the woman who got the original recipe from NM.  I lost my copy several years ago.

Funny that I got the recipe when I made cookies for work and the gentleman tells me that he makes these famous cookies and proceeds to tell me the story of the Urban Legend.  I can tell you that this the closest recipe, if it is not.  I do remember the instant espresso and the ground oats.  These were the key ingredients.  The only thing that may differ is the amounts.

Thank you for posting the recipe as I have been searching for this for the longest time and this is the first I have seen of this recipe.

Wonderful! I used unsweetened cocoa powder instead of the 4 oz of milk chocolate, and added some apple sauce for added moisture. Everyone raved about them!

These are so good! I've made the original Neiman Marcus cookie recipe from their website, and I made these because I wanted to compare the orignial with the legend recipe. Both recipes are really good and so different I can't choose which one is better. I really liked the addition of the ground oats, it made the cookies more hearty than regular chocolate chip cookies without making them too rough like other oatmeal cookies. I put the milk chocolate in the food processor and that sure took alot less time and effort rather than grating it by hand. I wanted bigger cookies so I dropped the dough by heaping tablespoons and baked them for about 12 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe!

My family isn't fond of walnuts so I used Pecans AND I blended them to a pulp.  The flavor was there, but no chunks.  Other than that...made just as is!  Amazing!

Delicious!  I'm just eating my 4th cookie now and these have a nice consistency and flavor (also reduced both sugars to 3/4 c.).  I might add cinnamon next time.

These cookie were VERY good. I took them to work and all my coworkers loved them. I followed the recipe exactly as written, not changing a single thing. My only complaint, I wasn't too happy with the way they looked after baking, they looked nothing like chocolate chip cookies. Everyone thought they were oatmeal cookies at first glance; I think it was because of the grated chocolate.

BEST cookies I've ever baked! I followed all of the directions of adding more baking soda and powder to my mix. I also added 2 tbs of sheridan (or kahlua) instead of the vanilla for a nice kick! It was DELICIOUS!!!

Unbelievable! Ouststanding! I halved the recipe because I only had half a mixed bag of semi-sweet and white chocolate chips. It made exactly 24 cookies. I was skeptical of grinding the oats, I thought, "where's the texture?" But it is so good! I will use half margarine and half butter next time to make a thicker cookie. The butter made them flat (but I like them that way) it's more for my husband and daughter who like "cakier" cookies. Oh, I also used almonds instead of walnuts. Perfect!

These are great!  The story I got around 1988 was that they were Mrs. Field's.  I don't use the nuts-just a preference and they are fine without the grated chocolate too.

Best chocolate chip cookies I have made! Followed the recommendations of other reviewers to reduce the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup each and it worked out just right. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. I baked two versions - one softer (about 8 mins) and one crunchier (about 12 mins) because i like it soft and my boyfriend likes it crunchy. Both were good! I will definitely bake this one again!

very tasty with a great texture. not so soft neither hard. and holds the same texture for up to 3 days. made half the quantity though. used milk choc chips instead of semi sweet to suit my personal taste. eventhough the dough was dry but turned great after baking! i think i will soften the butter more next time to ease the mixing process.

This was my favorite cookie recipe back in the 80's an 90's.  I lost it when I moved and am thrilled to have found it here.  I m planning on making a huge batch for our church sweet day this weekend.  Thanks for finding it.  I always heard it was the "Neiman Marcus" chocolate chip cookie.

yum yum yum. I know that the sugar is waaaaaaaay to much so I used just 1 cup of white sugar + 2 TBS molases and it was enough and I used whole wheat flour . and just 1 cup of chocolate chips. they came out perfect and I did't feel that the whole wheat gave it a weird healthy taste , I did't feel it.

These have a very good taste.  I am not big on oats in chocolate chip cookies.  I thought by blending the oats they wouldn't be noticable.  You can still tell they are there.  My whole family loved these.  Good with a few white chips thrown in there!

I love the way the cookies spread and shaped nicely once they are cooked. But i think i'll add more cocoa powder or instant coffee to make it bitter.. a bit too sweet though... will definitely make more!!!

Oh my - this is a fabulous recipe. I do think it requires a little tweaking, just to suit your own personal preferences. I agree with many other reviewers that the sugar can be decreased by at least 1/4 cup each. The stir-ins add a significant amount of sweetness, as does the grated/ground chocolate, so no worries there. I used the blender to grind the oatmeal to a flour consistancy a cup at a time, and added a regular size hershey bar with each cup as per another reviewer's suggestion. I substituted oat bran for the remaining 1/2 cup of oatmeal the recipe called for, and it added a nice, nutty texture and flavor, and a teensy health benefit, but hey - it's something!. For the stir-ins, I added chopped peanut butter chips and chopped m&ms that I had left over from making caramel apples. That added an additional bit of ground chocolate to the chunks to make the 4 oz called for. I didn't add nuts (pecans!), which I regret. The dough could have easily handled additional stir-ins. This recipe makes a VERY STIFF dough! You will seriously give your muscles a work out stirring everything into the dough. The dough was so stiff that I rolled it into golf ball sized balls, nine to a cookie sheet, flattened them about halfway down, and baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect: crispy,chewy, rich deliciousness. I got about 54 near 3 inch, very substantial cookies from the recipe. I will make these again, for sure, but I will decrease the sugar next time and add nuts.

The powdered oats gives these cookies an amazing texture.  I usually replace the walnuts with toffee bits and these cookies disappear in no time!

I see that alot of reviewers really enjoyed these cookies. In my opinion, there were too many chocolate chips, which overpowered the taste of the cookie... and they left an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth from the powdered oats.
Sorry for the bad review, but I'm sticking with my old Nestle's Toll House recipe.

i had this recipe years ago and forgot how good they were. seriously, hands down best chocolate chip cookie. the oatmeal is very subtle, it makes you wonder what the extra flavor is but still tastes like a chocolate chip cookie. i make them big and cook them on parchment. i also rotate two pans on two different racks halfway through cooking to ensure perfect tops and perfect bottoms. they get perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. make sure you take them from the oven when they look nicely formed and nicely browned but feel undercooked to the touch. if you have to be very careful getting them off the pan you know you took them out on time. as they cool they will be the perfect texture.

This recipe is absolutely the best. I've doubled it in the past (which makes a LOT of cookies) just because they're so good. I use all brown sugar for a dense cookie - for amazing cookies that you could actually picture buying at a bakery, try this: use a 1/4 cup measurement for BIG cookies. Bake them at 400 F for 7-9 minutes until lightly browned. Take them out and let them cool completely on the sheet, and then for a couple hours on the rack. They won't be great right out of the oven - too mushy - but when they cool, they will be SOFT, THICK, DENSE, and CHEWY! People RAVE over these! Oh, and you MUST not leave out the milk chocolate!

These are the best ever!Rave reviews every time. Also a great arm workout mixing the dough =D. I omited the nuts since they were a bit pricey. Had I used nuts I would use PECANS. I also added 1/2 tsp more vanilla, 1/2 tsp more of baking soda and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I shaped into 1 inch thick balls with my (clean) hands and they formed into the perfectly shaped round cookies. Helps to bake on parchmant paper for even browning and no burnt bottoms. Also I suggest using butter instead of margarine for the flavor.

This was an OUTSTANDING recipe! I made these cookies for Christmas and everyone loved them, especially my wife and I! We all scarfed them down like crazy! Just be sure to follow the directions word for word. The first time I made these I mixed dry ingredients and wet separately which this recipe is NOT all about! Mix things EXACTLY the way they state! The second time I made them they were amazing!! Great cookies!

These cookies... are... AWESOME!! I did a half-batch, so I used: ½ cup margarine, ½ cup sugar, ½ cup brown sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup flour, 1 1/4 cups rolled oats, 1/4 tsp salt, ½ tsp baking powder, ½ tsp baking soda, 1 cup chocolate chips, and about ½ cup walnuts (ran out!). Oh, and I used 1½ full-sized Hershey bars, ground up a bit in the Magic Bullet (which I also used to grind up the oats). I used parchment paper on the cookie sheets. I had to lower the temp to 350 as they were browning too quickly on the bottom. Some of the best cookies I have ever made and eaten, and I bake pretty much daily! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Rene!

These cookies came out very good. They don't look like any of the pcitures though. Everyone that tried them liked them, and they smell like peanut butter which is weird. I thought I blended the oatmeal into a powder, you could still see the oatmeal in the cookie. I chill the dough in the fridge before baking it so they don't spread that much. What i didn't like about this cookie was that it didn't fluff. It was very chewy and cracked on the top. Overall, pretty good, but I may retry this and blend the oatmeal more.

This cookie recipe is delicious, and I have always adored this cookie. However, I don't know why the submitter put 375 degrees. That is way too hot for cookies. I went against my better judgement and did 375. That's why i'm only giving this 3 stars. I like the Neiman Marcus cookie better, and this is very similar, but it isn't as good. That one is a five star. I ended up with 2 huge pans filled with cookies that were burnt black on the bottom and not done in the middle. Next batch cooked just fine at 325. Don't preheat to 375.

The best chocolate chip cookie! Now I can stop searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie. This beats the Tollhouse cookie by a mile. I made the cookies larger: nine golfball-size balls of dough per standard 12" x 16" cookie sheet, baked for about 10 minutes, gave me three-inch-diameter cookies that had more contrast between a crispy exterior and a soft, chewy center. Smaller cookies tend to have less contrast in texture between the edge and the center. But please do try these cookies!

hi fellow bakers--i didn't have the chocolate bar and didn't feel like going to the corner to buy one, so i skipped that ingredient, yet the results were outstanding!  what resulted was a very crunchy cookie that reminded both my husband and i of the original 'famous amos' cookies that are stellar with milk!  CRUNCHY, TASTY AND OHSOGOOD!   have fun!

I thought these cookies were great.  I thought the oatmeal gave them a certain nutty texture.  The dough is a little hard to work with but they are great cookies.

The BEST cookies I've ever had.  I made these as Christmas gifts to friends and co-workers and never recieved so many raved reviews.  To top it off, I had to make another batch of them because my sisters and I ate them all!  The hardest part is processing the oatmeal until it's fine.  But it's worth it.

My husband just LOVES these cookies, but they are a pain to make.  The prep time is NOT 15 minutes, more like an hour to do the oats and chocolate, and get everything mixed together.  I've made these twice, my old mixer couldn't handle the thick dough, then my KitchenAid handled it very well.  But everyone raves about these cookies, so I guess its worth it.

I followed the recipe to a T....and they came out   dry-even after watching closely not to overbake.
I added more butter to the remaining dough and the problem was solved and they are delicious.  Next time, I will add 1 and 1/2 cups butter at the start

You he
ave to be careful and not bake these cookies too long.  They need to be still rather soft when you remove them from the oven and just slightly browned around the edges.  Sometimes we use half butterscotch ships and half dark chocolate chips for the 2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips. i also like pecans rather than walnuts.  my culinary students have been making them for at least 28 years......

I followed the advice of others and decreased sugar to 3/4c. each, increased baking soda by 1/2tsp, and baking powder by 1/4tsp because I prefer a little puffier cookie.  Could not be more pleased with the result!  I also sprinkled some cinnamon right on in these.  The balance of flavors is wonderful and even without grinding the oats these are the perfect texture - not overly hard or chewy after baking exactly 7min, letting sit for 1.  Wouldn't hesitate to make this my go-to chocolate chip oatmeal recipe!

These really are amazing cookies, my mom made them for me when I was a kid when the original email was forwarded around, and they are just as good now as they were then. The thing I like about them is that they are unique, the ground up oats make all the difference for an awesome texture and taste.

I used butter, both cups of sugar, Heath toffee bits, semi-sweet chocolate chips and blended milk chocolate melts.  I did not add nuts, as we are not fans in my house.  They turned out great!  I baked them on a metal cookie sheet and a Pampered Chef stone and the ones cooked on the stone turned out perfect - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I ended up with 84 2" cookies - enough to share!

This is a keeper. I took both sugars down to 3/4 cup, used half margarine and half unsalted butter, and added a little more baking soda. I love milk chocolate so I also used half milk and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. Everyone else was right... 1.5 cups was more than enough! Add a little sprinkle of cinnamon... you won't have any left over!

Just ok, kind of a different taste if you are used to traditional chocolate chip.

I followed the recipes exactly, except didn't add nuts. I also added a bit more baking powder to assure they rose well. 
OMG this might FINALLY be "The One". I love the extra texture the oatmeal powder adds. My cookies turned out JUST like the photo-very fat and plump-without being cakey or flourey tasting. Yummmmmm

This has been my chocolate chip cookie recipe since the late 1980's. I got this recipe and it was called the Nieman Marcus $250 cookie recipe. Of course back then, I believed the urban legend. Then I got a similar recipe that I was told was Mrs. Field's recipe (which I'm sure is also an urban legend). I tend to follow the Mrs. Field's recipe. The only difference between this recipe and my "Mrs. Field's" recipe is 1) I don't grind up the oatmeal and 2) I don't add grated chocolate to the dough. What prevents these cookies from flattening is the fact that there is a lot of dry ingredients. I find it is easiest to mix the dough up with a heavy duty (Kitchen-Aid) mixer. Trying to mix the dry ingredients in by hand can be very tiring.

I tried this recipe for the first time today and it was tasty. I substituted the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour because it's what I had on hand. The taste of the cookies was good but they were a bit dry. This may have been due to the whole wheat flour. I would make this again but with fewer chocolate chips. Seems like I had more chips than dough and it was slightly overbearing.

I halved the recipe because 5 dozen cookies was a bit much for us.  They came out really good!  I took them out just as the edges were beginning to turn golden and that was perfect timing (about 8 minutes).  I think next go-around, I will reduce the amount of semi-sweet chocolate and increase the milk chocolate because that's my preference.  This is definitely worth making and is an easy go-to cookie recipe.

This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie.  I followed others' reviews and made some changes.  I reduced sugars to 3/4 cup each (I don't like overly sweet cookies), added in an extra 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda for extra lift.  The cookies don't spread much and stay puffy which I like rather than flat.  The oatmeal gives them a wonderful flavor too.  I love this cookie.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These were really good, just a tad too sweet for us. I'll probably lessen the sugar next time. Also I baked them for about 10 minutes.

My family liked these cookies.  I think they were a little dry and crumbly.  Nothing to rave about.  I guess I was hoping for more considering they came from an urban legend that raved about a $250.00 cookie.  But, since my family thought they deserved four stars I thought I would give them four.  Personally, I would have given them three.

Great cookie!  I make them for gifts when someone has been exceptional!  The recipe "as is" is phenomenal... but sometimes I like to add in heath toffee chunks from time to time.  Also, instead of just walnuts, sometimes I like to use cashews and pecans as well.  Gives a little more depth to it all.  NO cookie will ever compare!

I give this recipe 5 stars not because it's my favorite choc. chip cookie recipe but because my family loves it!  It's healthier for them because of the ground up oats.  All three boys ages 5 to 12 like these cookies so they are a winner in my book!

Excellent cookie.  I, like many, made some minor adjustments for taste.  I cut both sugars to 3/4 C and ground the oatmeal in a food processor to a coarse flour. To save time I threw the walnuts and the chocolate bar into the food processor as well and hit the pulse button several times.  The chocolate was not quite as fine as grated. I also made the cookies rather large. They were approximately the size of golf balls maybe slightly larger before baking and were approximately 3 inches in diameter when done, yielding about 52 cookies. I kept the temp to 350 degrees knowing my oven and rotated the cookie sheets 1/2 way through baking. The baking time was 9-10 minutes total.

These are my absolute favorite cookies. We don't include the nuts, but you can vary the chips/nuts as much as you want. With milk and semisweet, it's great, but with white and dark, or with butterscotch and toffee chips, it's divine. The chewy texture is perfect, and the dough itself is irresistible. We always make extra to have raw.

This is a pretty good chocolate chip cookie recipe. I omitted the nuts due to my picky eaters. Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar (this is a really sweet cookie), and only blend half of the rolled oats for a crunchy texture.

These cookies had great flavor, but the texture wasn't my favorite.  I prefer a moist and chewy cookie.  These cookies were a bit dry, but good with a glass of milk.

These are great!!! Except I didn't feel like grinding up the oats the first time I made them, so I just put in 3 cups of rolled oats with 1/2 of wheat flour, and my neighbors think I should open a cookie store!!! The second time I followed the recipe exactly, and it was still really good the difference was the texture. Anyway, these are perfect!

These turned out great!  I think running the oats through the food processor first is a great idea.  The finely processed oats add nice texture without making it seem like an oatmeal cookie.  Very good.

I use the same exact recipe but you do not have to use the rolled oats you can just use the flour 2  1/2 cups will work just fine and the cookies taste the exact same.  It will save you time!!!

I heard of this recipe back when Gopher, Pine and listservs ruled the internet.  In fact, I've been baking a similar recipe to this for years.  The original recipe found on the snopes website is the one I received and follow to a tee.  The one given here on allrecipes call for dropping the dough on a spoon.  I love rolling it into balls and also grinding the oatmeal into a fine powder.  I recently made this recipe and my boss ate 25 of the 36 cookies I made.  Delicious!

These cookies are incredible!  The oatmeal adds a nice flavor and texture...plus the added bonus of fiber.  I packed the dough into a 1/4 cup measuring cup and then inverted it onto the baking sheet (6 per sheet).  The cookie remains chewy and has an even shape.  They took about 15 minutes to bake.  I took them out when they were browned on the edges and the top but still soft in the middle.  They set up as they cool.

These are the best!  I changed a few things though, due to not having some ingredients on hand.  Instead of walnuts, I added 1 t. almond extract and instead of the milk chocolate, I chopped up some DARK chocolate.  These were gone in two days!  Yum!

I used a 1 T. scoop for the cookies, and it made 6 dozen+

These were really yummy. I am always using the same oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe and this was a nice change.  One that I will keep for sure.  I love the oatmeal taste and the sweetness is absolutely perfect.  I did not change anything.  Definately a keeper!  Thank you!

The overall flavor was good in these cookies. I used 62% cocoa chocolate chips so they were not too sweet as other reviewers had stated. The cookies were pretty soft/chewy. There was no outside crunch which i like.  It might have been the rainy weather though. Overall a good cookie though.

I'm eating these as I type!  Very good.  I used the Nestle 62% Chocolatier as the grated chocolate, and it cut down on the sweetness.  Great texture and flavor in these cookies. They will be gone quickly, I can tell!

These were pretty good for a choc chip recipe. I have been looking for a really good one, and decided to give this one a try. I don't have a food processor, so I put the oats in a blender and it made into a powder also. They were ok, but we could definitely taste the oats in it. I'm still looking for that 1 good recipe.

I also received this recipe in the mid to late 80's and I haven't used another chocolate chip cookie recipe since!  The only change I made (purely by accident) is to chop the chocolate bar, not grate it.  I did this the first few times accidentally and I love the cookie so much I didn't want to change the way I had been making it.  And now that nestle makes chocolate chunks in a bag, sometimes I just use those instead of the chocolate bar.  I get lots of compliments on this recipe.  You must undercook slightly so they don't get too hard and crunchy.  They should stay soft if they are undercooked when you first pull them out and they finish 'cooking' on the cookie sheet for the few minutes before you remove them to a cooling rack.  That's the trick, in my book.  :)  Love them, thanks!!

This recipe is so not worth 250.00.  Probably not even 2.50.  I will not make these again.

I expected more out of this recipe.  Everyone loved them, but I personally felt that they were a bit dry.  I wish they had been chewier.  I think the oats may be the culprit.  They seemed to make them a bit gritty.  If, however, I like oatmeal cookies, this probably would not have been an issue.  I, like others, added an extra 1/2 tsp baking soda.  I did not add the grated chocoloate (wasnt on hand).  Otherwise good.

I agree with other reviewers who found this cookie a bit dry.  I followed the directions exactly, up until adding the chocolate chips.  At that point, I broke the dough into three different groups.  Plain chocolate chip, double chocolate pecan, and chocolate chip with cinnimon raisin.  They all turned out a little dry, but had a nice texture and chew.  Overall, I will stick with my standby chocolate chip cookie recipe.

These cookies are fabulous....I made a couple of variations.  1) I ground half the oats and left the other half whole for a wonderful texture.  2) I used half vanilla extract and half almond extract for a nuttier flavor.  3)  I used 1 1/4 tsp baking soda for a fluffier cookie.  4)  I used black walnuts for a deeper flavor.  They are a delicious compliment to the chocolate chips.  5)  I did not use the milk chocolate as the chips seemed more than enough.  I took the cookies out just as they were starting to brown and let them sit for a couple of minutes before removing them from the sheet.  They were sinfully soft, rich, and dangerous!  I cook often and have found my new favorite cookie recipe...definitely sinful, but definitely worth it!!!

What a wonderful recipe!!  This is the first time I've made these cookies, but they were wonderful.  My alterations: I didn't have any oats, so I ended up using just under 3 cups of unbleached bread flour (I was going to add more, but the dough just could not take any more), 1 1/2 cups Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips, and no nuts (I didn't have any).  I baked these at 250 for about 15 minutes.  They didn't really look done when I pulled them out of the oven, but after setting for a few minutes I found they were juuuuust perfect.  Also, anytime I make cookies, I use unsalted sweet cream butter-- the difference in taste is very much worth it.

I didn't have chocolate to grate and I didn't use nuts but these cookies were AWESOME!  My whole family moaned with delight when they ate them.
I layered them in wax paper and kept them in an air tight container and they stayed soft and chewy.

These cookies are soft! I love them! Instead of eggs (I'm a veggietarian) I use 1/4 cup of applesauce per egg. Not only does it act like an egg, it makes it even more moist!! Try it out!

These were alright.  They turned out really 'oaty' which isn't suprising given the 2 1/2 cups of oats.  Not sure what all the fuss is about.  I'll have to check out some of the reviews, I guess.

These cookies are fantastic! I made them as a thank you gift for my neighbors and they called right after eating one and said they were very yummy. The ground-up oats make a very nice difference from other chocolate chip cookies. I did have to bake them for 12 minutes instead of 6-8. For something different, I grease a 9-inch cake pan and spread cookie dough out in that and bake until golden brown--about 15 minutes or so--to make a giant cookie. Nice for birthday treats or thank you gifts. :O) Enjoy! Will DEFINITELY make these again!

If there were ten million stars, I would give this recipe all of them. I was at first skeptical of the whole processing the oatmeal step but I assure you my friends, it was well worth it. I don't have a food processor and I never knew that my blender had such capabilities. But alas, it did. And some really freakin' good cookies came out of it. Thank you Mrs. Kratz for all the cookie wisdom you have bestowed upon me. Honestly though, these are the best chocolate chip cookies you will find on this website or probably anywhere. I also am too uncoordinated to shave chocolate bars so I just broke them off into as little pieces as I could. I do not yet have a gourmet kitchen yet, but give me time, I'm only 23.

This is the best cookie recipe that I've ever made.  I've been making it for several years now, but the one thing that I do differently from Rene is that I grind the oatmeal AND the nuts to a fine powder before incorporating them into the batter.  FABULOUS texture results from doing this!  Here's why these cookies are so great:

1.  THE TEXTURE.  They are very firm with a mealy texture that sounds off-putting on paper, but feels absolutely delightful in your mouth!

2.  THE FLAVOR.  The fact that you can't see the oatmeal or the nuts results in a flavor surprise that adds a tremendous amount of depth to these delectable treats.

They require a little more preparation than your run-of-the-mill chocolate chip cookies, but they are well worth the time and the mess.  Try these cookies!!

I love these!!! I've been making these for about a year and without fail I always get compliments. The only thing is they are very textured cookies, so you can almost see the oatmeal, but I'm an oatmeal lover. This is an extremely versatile recipe. I've switched the ingredients to walnut, cranberry and white chocolate and pecans and butterscotch. This is one of my favorite recipes and it always bakes a pretty cookie.

Beautiful cookies!  I didn't have anything to grate the chocolate with, so I tried pounding it to death in a ziploc bag...and that was a fat mess, so I didn't get to use the milk chocolate in the recipe.  It didn't matter!  These cookies are wonderful!  I flattened them before baking.

I bake these every Christmas and understand these are THE Neiman Marcus cookie.  My family requests these for every get together but I can only handle it one time a year....time consuming,but worth it!  May save time....process oatmeal and grate chocolate day before.  Also refrigerate chocolate for easier grating and return to refrigerator until ready to use.

Very Very good they are soft and chewy, they stayed soft the next day. Everyone said they were the best cookies I ever made. My mother and sister, and they are very hard to please. I made a few alterations though since I didnt have a few or enough ingredients. I had about 1/2 cup of oats instead of the 2 and 1/2 cups. My family and I dont care for nuts so I omitted those. I used only 3/4 cup butter. I also didnt have any brown sugar. So I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar. And lastly since my family adors dark chocolate I used hershey's special dark instead of the grated milk chocolate chips. These cookies are wonderful.

Excellent!  My husband loves oatmeal cookies but my kids won't eat cookies with oatmeal in it.  This recipe "masked" the oatmeal and my kids gobbled it up.  Great texture.  I baked these on my Pampered Chef baking stone for about 10 minutes and they came out perfect.  I used a medium sized cookie scoop so they looked as good as they tasted.

I love the taste that the ground oatmeal adds to this cookie.  I followed the reviewers advice of adding an extra 1/2 tsp of baking power to achieve a fluffier cookie.

I think these are my favorite cookies of all time. I have tried several other chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site, & this is the best by far.

Incredible!  My favorite chocolate chip cookies ever!  My husband couldn't stop eating them.  They are chewy, soft, and so chocolatey! They are addicting!

This will be my main cookie recipe.  I can't wait to try them with cherries and nuts.

I love these cookies.  I lost the recipe years ago and am happy you have shared it.  It was easier than I remember thinking it was 10 years ago.  The cookies were great.  I did over cook them a bit.  They were chewy when I took them out, but were hard an hour later.  I should have stuck to the time on the recipe.  (My partner does not like these at all, but I LOVE them.)

These are with the extra work! I used a rotary grinder for the pecans and the chocolate (I used dark chocolate chips throughout the recipe) and blitzed the oats in my food processor. Used a hand mixer to cream, a silicone spatula to add the dry ingredients and hand mixed the chocolate and pecans. As some other reviews advised, I added an extra bit of baking powder and baking soda. Refrigerated the dough for a few hours, then baked a few cookies. When the dough is room temp, 8 minutes is probably enough. I baked these straight from the fridge and they needed a few more minutes. They stayed nice and high! Perfect cookie! Makes about 3.75lbs of cookie dough.

I've been making these for years from the old paper copy. Nice to find it online.   These make the best chocolate chip cookies. I don't add the shaved milk chocolate, but I do add a bit more chips and nuts than called for.

This is a delicious recipe and I always get tons of compliments when I make these! Tip - after making the dough, let it sit in the fridge 24 hours. The flavor becomes more complex and caramelized in flavor.  I don’t grind up the oatmeal/leave it whole and I use the highest quality vanilla and chocolate I can find.  I also make these huge - about the size of my palm.  They come out slightly crispy on the outside, and soft and creamy/chewy on the inside.  Delicious!

These cookies were a hit! Even I, who normally hates nuts in my chocolate chip cookies, cannot resist them.  A few notes:  I doubled the batch because I had 2 cookie swaps to attend.  I only had time to make about half.  The dough kept nicely in the fridge for a few days and the second batch baked up just as well.   I changed it a bit: to make sure they were a little on the fluffy side, I used half butter and half shortening.  I used a combination of semisweet and dark chocolate chips.  I halved the amount of nuts (since I usually hate nuts in my cookies).  I used grated Scharfenberger dark chocolate.  Grating the chocolate (as well as trying to bake with 2 little ones) makes the dough a  little more on the labor intensive side, but well worth it!  My chocolate snob husband loved them and declared them his "go to" for chocolate chip cookies.

Excellent. I made it this afternoon and they came out great. I did decrease the sugars to 3/4 c each and added the 1/4tsp more of B powder and B soda and they are thick and soft. The flavor was good and I didnt find it any more time consuming than making them without the oats and ground chocolate, I put both in my blender and in less than 30 seconds fine powdered oats and chocolate. I will definately make them again.

Will not make again. Very dry cookie. I wondered as I was mixing the dough up if I was missing an ingredient, because of the dry texture. Threw the cookies to my chickens, and they hardly ate them.

Delicious soft cookies.  My recipe from many years ago did not grind the oatmeal, I did this time.  The dough is very heavy but, there is a lot in it.  They don't spread much while baking.  Cut back on the white and brown sugars to 3/4 cup.  These are plenty sweet.   That was my only change.  A little shake up from the usual chocolate chip cookie.

Yum!!! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 Apple sauce with oil and these came out SO good that toddlers and husbands alike could not stop munching them and now they're asking for more..... Cutting chocolate with a chef knife is KEY! It makes them that much more special and indulgent.

They turned out great! I'm not a baker so I was so impressed with the outcome. I shared them with several neighbors and I've had two requests so far for the recipe. I tried one batch without the grated chocolate and they were just as good. Mine took the whole 8 minutes.

I tried these. I was looking for something different than Toll House choc cookies, I don't really like those.  I thought these were very good. I pretty much followed the directions and I did blend the oatmeal into a flour.  I'm no genius but I think those that said they are dry, flakey, bland must have done something wrong; or if you cook something too long it isn't going to come out right.  I'm gonna give it 4 stars because the oatmeal taste does come through and the oatmeal gives it a "grainy" texture.  Don't get me wrong, I would make them again.

These are very good! I made a few changes. I blended the oats into a fine powder like the recipe said. Except I held out 1/2 cup of the oats and just added those as whole oats. I took tips from another poster and brought my eggs to room temp (not sure what that does but I did it) and  added 1/2 tsp of b.Soda and 1/4 tsp b.Powder.  I used a small cookie scoop. Not my smallest one but the next size up. And baked for 7 min.  When I got to the dry ingredients I set my Kitchen Aide mixer on stir and used the dough hook.  All is well and cookies are yummy. 

TR

ps... I think this was the Ms.Fields cookie recipe that was sold for $250.

I made the adjustments people suggested with the baking soda and baking powder increase, however, they are a little salty. Apparently, if you increase the baking soda, you should cut the salt at least a little bit. I also needed to bake them about 11 minutes. I think the people who are getting dry cookies are blending their oatmeal into flour, don't blend it to a powder, just a coarse oatmeal.

These were ok. With all the great reviews, I was expecting them to be the best cookies ever but they were just ok. I didn't add the shaved chocolate or nuts though so maybe that was the difference?

What a perfect cookie!  Texture and taste spot on while following this recipe as stated.  To freeze just size and slightly flatten;  let it thaw during the preheat oven process and still perfect.  These are my boyfriend cookies!

AMAZING! I don't even really like cookies but absolutely loved these! Sent some to work with my husband and got rave reviews, healthy fit men who usually don't touch anything sweet ate 3 or 4 of these! I left out the nuts (didn't have any) and baked for 7.5 mins, letting cool completely on cookies sheet! Soft but chewy, oh my they are good!

The processed oats add an unexpected but wholly pleasant texture, and the grated (or, in my case, processed with the oats) milk chocolate adds an unexpected bit of extra flavor, too. These cookies are a step above the ordinary and worth the time.

I subbed in 1/2 cup of pecans for 1/2 cup of the oats, since I was short, and processed those until crumbly as well, and I used half whole wheat flour. These cookies are terrific! I gave some away, and my friend said, "What are these made of - heaven?" I might stop short of that, but they are crispy and chewy and lovely. Do take them out perhaps before you think you should: mine were great but crispier than I'd like. I'll watch more closely next time, because there surely will be a next time. And a time after that, and a time after that...

I made a batch of these for a party I threw last Sunday, and they were a huge hit.  I was sending friends home with baggies full.  They're very soft, which I love, and have a great oatmeal flavor without the chewiness of oatmeal (because of using the food processor).  So yummy...I think this will be my new go-to recipe.

These cookies are amaaaaaaazing. 
My mom always makes the best chocolate chip cookies ever, so I just wanted to try something to compete with her. We both fell in LOVE with it. The oatmeal really makes a difference in the cookies.

I made these years ago from an e-mail. The department store in the e-mail was Neiman Marcus. I have never had a cookie from a Neiman Marcus, but I thought they did taste a little like the ones from the Double Tree hotel they give you when you arrive. I don't know that I believe the story now. However, when I did make them I halved the recipe here and it still made plenty. I find them to be a tad work with the grinding of the oatmeal and the grating of the chocolate. Overall, they are as good as any other cookie. I did save the recipe though, so I must had planned to try making them again.

These take a while to make but they are so moist and wonderful it is so worth it!  I use pecans because I like them better than walnuts.  Also, it is much easier on the kitchenaide and keeps it from mixing it over the edge if you half the recipe.  They freeze great.  For the ones I don't put nuts in I put M&Ms... that way people can easily tell which ones have nuts and which do not.

This is my new Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe. I used less shredded chocolate (1 oz) and less chips (1.5 cups) and it was plenty Chocolaty to me. I am giving it five stars for the build up of the cookie. I feel like the chocolate can be left to the baker's taste. But with the amounts I used, you could tell they were different (with the shredded chocolate) but not over the top, as might have been the case with the recommended amount. I'll certainly try that some time just to taste it but this is a great base recipe.

I haven't tried this recipe, so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt with 5 stars.  Just wanted to say I worked for the store in question, and it IS an urban legend, and the real recipe involves espresso.

Fantastic. WHO cares who had the recipe. If you read her entry, she said it was an Urban Legand and who knows.   The oatmeal "flour" makes this cookie tasty. I double all my cookie recipes and freeze some dough. I bumped up to 1 TABLESPOON Vanilla for the double recipe.  It is delicious. Always the recipe we like.  It is simple to make.  I left out the milk chocolate, changed sugars to 3 cups brown, 1 cup white for the double recipe.  Thanks for sharing. We love the recipe!

These cookies are incredible!  They taste great and they look great, not flat like my cookies usually do.  I did use 1/2 grated milk chocolate and 1/2 white chocolate.

Fabulous cookies! My 4yr old and I made these, we followed the recipe exactly, and they came out perfect! The were chewy inside, crispy outside, and just sweet enough to be satisfied after 2 or 3 (ok, I ate waaay more than that, but who's counting?). We will definitely make these again!

I made this pretty much as stated except added reeses mini baking bits. i also added 1/2 c extra flour and im glad i did. They turned out great. Soft chewy amd thick. Next time I might just blend half the oats or just grind all of them half-way so I can get more of a oaty texture.

This looks like a great cookie. Can I make the dough up and then freeze it for later baking?

Very good!  I was looking for that extra something in a cookie that has both chocolate chips and oatmeal both of which dh loves, but this gives it a great texture.  Followed the recipe exactly except left out the nuts.  We love walnuts, so next time I will add some to half of the batch.

These cookies were amazing! I did change the recipie though. I melted the butter for a thicker cookies, changed the 4 ounces of grated chocolate the crushed white chocolate chips, added a tablespoon of ground cinnomon (sp?, changed the nuts from walnuts to pecons and also ground grahm crackers in a coffee blender and then added them to the mix. My changes were made only by personal pereference, I'm sure the origanal recipie was amazing as is but I just changed things to my liking. They were five stars and I never rebake recipies and less they're amazing, and this one is going for a third run.

YUM. I halved this recipe and it was delisious, but I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  Instead of adding grated chocolate, I put about 3tbsp of choc. syrup and 3tbsp of melted peanut butter to add some for flavor.  I probably but less choc. chips than it called for as well.  Also, instead of nuts, I crushed up some chex cerial.  These were verrrrrry good.

This is the best choc. chip cookie recipe I've ever made.  The key is the blended oats, it gives the cookies an amazing texture.  I chopped up milk chocolate bars and that's all the chocolate I used.  I didn't have any nuts, but next time I'm definately going to add pecans.  These cookies are melt in your mouth!

I thought these were pretty good. I'm not sure about the texture though. I did make a few changes: I used half oil and halg butter, ground old-fashioned oats instead of quick ones, and like another reviewer, increased the baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp and the baking powder to 1 1/4. They still taste amazing though!

This is one of my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipes. Everytime I make these for someone, they ask what my secret is. I think the finely ground oatmeal adds that nutty flavor, without the coarse texture. When I make these they always come out perfectly. I always use semi-sweet chocolate chunks and milk chocolate chips. I don't really measure the chocolate chunks and chips, I just add it until it looks like there is enough. Everything else I do exactly as stated in the recipe. Seriously, you have got to try this recipe! But be warned, once you make them people will always ask you to make more!

Tasty, original cookie.  You do need the time for preparation of rolled oats and nuts as well as some type of food processor.  I followed the recipe with one exception-  I used some mini M&Ms instead of the grated chocolate.  The oats really gave a nice crispy but chewy texture.  This makes a lot of cookies which is nice b/c we like to bake off a half dozen after dinner sometimes so I was able to roll out a couple of dozen and freeze them.  The oatmeal, chocolate chips, M&Ms and nuts really complimented one another.  Oh, and mine baked for almost 12 minutes and I let them sit on a parchment lined cookie sheet for a few minutes before placing them on a cooling rack.  One more thing-  I made the dough in the AM and then baked the cookies after the kids were asleep.  Thanks for sharing!  UPDATE:  I originally gave this 4 stars but had to come back and give it 5 stars because they really are fabulous-  even when freezing them and then baking them.  This is one of my absolute favorite cookies when I add the mini M&Ms.

k, so i was just starting to mix the flour into my kitchen aid and the flour flys on the lowest setting, then when it turned to cookie dough it was trying to jump out, it was a monster., i think this is the best thing to cook when u dont want your kids to eat the cookie dough before it gets on the pan, cuz its not very sweet. i skipped the walnuts thank god and the shredded chocolate or whatever cuz i was out.so i opened the oven a little early and poked one and it fell like a cake, it was different, two minutes later i took out the cookies and they were goregeous, interesting flavor you can really taste the oatmeal.i mean really. they are kinda crispy, i like them but they remind me of cerel. i guess my search goes on the are pretty tho.

I made these cookies and they were wonderful!!!  i didn't have any chocolate, so we replaced it with cocoa powder and oil (for every ounce of chocolate, you use three tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 tablespoon of oil.)  We also omitted the walnuts.  With the cocoa powder mixture instead of the Chocolate, the cookies didn't look like the picture at all, but they till tasted good.  They're also a bit on the crumbly side.  They seem very soft when you first take them out of the oven, but they get more firm as they cool. As I said, though, they're quite a bit crumbly.  Almost soft.

These cookies are awesome. I don't grind the oats because everyone at my house prefers a chunkier texture. They never last more than two days. And the ingredients usually find their way onto the shopping list every week or two.
Good stuff!

These are fantastic just the way it is written.  I've made them a few times and every time people say they are the best chocolate chip cookie they have ever had!  I agree!  UPDATE: I made these again with unsalted butter and 1.5 cups choc chips and they were a lot less flavorful, definitely don't do that.

I didn't grind my oatmeal, and grated dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate, using only 1/2 the amount called for. Used pecans rather than walnuts as that is what I had on hand.  I guess there are several variations on this recipe floating around.  This one tended to get a bit crumbly after the cookies had cooled.  Thanks for posting the recipe, Rene!

I'm NOT a huge chocolate chip cookie fan, but these were the best cookies I'd ever had. The 3rd time I made these though, they were SO dry and just not that good. I think it was because the first 2 times I didn't take the butter out of the fridge early enough so I melted it in the microwave - didn't do it the 3rd time. I also leave out the grated chocolate every time. These cookies are awesome. If you read reviews that say otherwise, it's because they did something wrong, trust me!

These were great!  Super moist and full of flavor.  I really liked the oatmeal ground up, it gives an extra special flavor without having the "chunks".  I baked mine for 9 minutes, 6-8 was too little time.  I also did not add the nuts.  Thanks for the great recipe, I will use it again!

I left out the walnuts, and used a bit less chocolate, and these were still extremely sweet! I had to bake them for about 15min before they were done, though. I did two batches, the first I stoped at 12min, and they were practically falling apart in my hands. My friends and family all loved them though. I'm definetly keeping this recipe!

WOW! Great cookie recipe! I got the best compiments ever on this cookie! 4 dozen were gone in 20 minutes on thanksgiving, even before the turkey was done! It is very versatile, you can add almost anything you like to this dough! I like toffee chips, semi-sweet chips, ground chocolate and hershey chunks.

I had to try these to see what the buzz was about.  They were okay.  I didn't think they were anything extraordinary.  They were definately VERY chocolatey, which I liked, but for someone who doesn't like a really sweet cookie, these would be a turn off.  I would make these again but I'd probably cut the white sugar down by 1/4 cup.

This is a fabulous recipe! Instead of milk chocolate and nuts I put 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 1/4 cups peanut butter baking chips. My taste buds danced for a half hour!

This is our official family chocolate chip cookie! The trick to this cookie is to process the oats until they become oat flour! That way they are not oaty and don't absorb all the moisture in the cookie. Anyway, we LOVE this recipe and make it on a regular basis for our family to eat and bring it to every family event and holiday. We're famous for them.

It was a wonderful cookie, and I'm giving it 5 stars because it was very easy to substitute ingredients and STILL come out yummy. 
I used chopped heath bars instead of chocolate chips or shaved chocolate, just because that was what I had on hand and I didn't want to run to the store. 
I also substituted the  all-purpose flour for my own mixture of whole wheat and unbleached flour and some of the oats for oat bran. (because I'm a nutball who can't resist adding a healthy touch to even something as simple as cookies)
I ALSO subbed the white sugar for splenda (so my hypoglycemic husband could at least have ONE cookie)
My son wanted to make cookies and I'm always looking for a cookie that will taste good, have low sugar (this one doesn't) and will be at least somewhat healthy. I think this one was able to accomidate 2 of the three, and since it isn't intended to be low-sugar, I still give it 5 stars. YUM

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm...........these were interesting. They spread out A LOT on the cookie sheets and so they weren't the thick, delicious cookies I thought they were going to be. They were thin and sort of crunchy. I think the chocolate chips were the best part. The blender didn't really like having to puree the oats. I probably won't make this again, but the cookies were okay.

This is an ok recipe. I have searched far and wide for the perfect chocolate chip recipe and still have not found one. I liked the softness of these cookies but I didn't care too much for the flavor from the oatmeal. They tasted too much like oatmeal cookies and I am not much of an oatmeal cookie fan. Needless to say, the search continues.

Great cookies!  My whole family loved them, they are really full chocolate chips.  Any type of nuts works great.  I baked for 8 minutes just to get a slightly darker color, but they were still chewy.  I will for sure make again!

I kept the oats whole to give it more chew.  Was a good cookie, but I found that the next day they definitely weren't as good - got way to crunchy.  Good, but not worth changing from my other recipe.

Finally!  A recipe that yields delicious cookies! I had been on the hunt and after countless inconsistent, cakelike cookies, I can finally make ones that are moist, soft and chocolatey! The only downside are that they are not the most attractive cookies (certainly didn't turn out like the picutre).  Otherwise, prepare yourself for rave reviews and envy from your coworkers!!

This is now my official chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I had been having problems finding a recipe that produced chewy cookies.  This recipe resulted in cookies that were chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges.  Perfection!  If you want this result make sure to use half white sugar and half packed dark brown sugar.  The white sugar results in crispiness, while the brown sugar results in chewiness.  Half of each and you have crispy-chewy cookies!  If your cookies are not moist enough, try adding an extra egg yolk.  The yolk gives provides moisture while the egg white creates dryness.  I halved the recipe and created 25 medium, chunky cookies.  I only used the 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were extremely chocolatey.  I'm glad I didn't add the grated milk chocolate, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to enjoy the actual cookie part.  I'll cut the chocolate by a quarter next time.  Tastes great with walnuts.  The oats give it a coconutty texture, so I'm thinking I'll try white chocolate and toasted macadamia nuts next time.  Yum!

I'm am SO addicted to these cookies. I did notice that the brand of chocolate makes a difference. I used Ghirardelli semi sweet and Trader Joe's Swiss milk chocolate the first time and they were awesome. I used the grocery brand the next time and my cousin asked me if I changed the recipe. She said they were better the first time. I've also tried them without the walnuts and they were delicious.

Well Rene, these cookies certainly passed the test in our house. After reading one review that stated the Nieman Marcus recipe was so much better I decided to check it out. I didn't see much of a difference between the two recipes so I figured I'd be loyal to this great site and all of the submitters and made my choice by adding this to my Christmas cookie recipe box. I'm so glad I did because my fifteen year old daughter declared these "the best chocolate chip cookies in the world"! Thanks so much!!!!

This may be the BEST cookie recipe I have ever tried! The oats in this recipe make the texture of this cookie very sturdy yet crumbly when eaten. You will not regret making these!

I have been using this recipe for ages. It is THE best chocolate chip cookie recipe around. I actually found it in a church cookbook, which did not call for nuts. My family eats these as fast as I can turn them out, and I have a reputation amongst our friends and relations for making a mean chocolate chip cookie. This recipe is my secret. You absolutly cannot leave out the grated chocolate. It is the key to the sucess of this recipe. The nuts can be optinal. My family actually prefers them without the nuts, but you have to add the grated chocolate. These freeze well, so I often make a double batch and freeze half for later. It is a family tradition to make these to take along when we go camping. I like to use two of these instead of grahm crackers for sm'ores. More calories, but SOOO good!

the first time i made these cookies, i reduced the sugar, and left out the grated chocolate and nuts. the cookies were poofy and dry, and just terrible, but i knew it was because of the changes i had made. so i made them again exactly like the recipe says, and they were great - only WAY too sweet. I'd like to experiment with the recipe to get it less sweet without compromising the moisture. i recommend that anyone trying to bake any type of cookies should read the tutorial on this website about how to get the right texture in a cookie. i'll keep trying!

I LOVE these cookies!  I substitute Heath bits for the grated chocolate.  They are moist, chewy and taste fantastic.  Definitely one to put in the recipe box.

I loved the buttery oatmeal flavor they have! I modified the recipe a little...leaving out 1/2 cup oats to make the dough more gooey. I also omitted the walnuts and chocolate shavings. I added milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. I took them to work and they disappeared! I had to quickly grab a couple so I didn't end up empty handed! Yum, thanks :)

These were good but a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  Will reduce the amt of sugar next time.  These cookies came out very cake like for me...they were really good the next day, excellent for dipping in milk--yum!

these cookies tasted good, and were soft and chewy.  i had to take off a star because of their appearance, though.  the grated chocolate gives the cookie a sort of mottled look - not very attractive.  it seems like it almost wants to be a chocolate chocolate chip cookie, but didn't quite make it.  maybe the recipe would be better without the grated chocolate.

This is now the only CC Cookie I make! I get compliments ALL the time for it! I havent found ONE person who doesnt like these. Everyone asks when I will be making more! I have made them so much I have the recipe memorized. Ive given this recipe out to many people too, they loved it!  I freeze the dough before rolling it into balls. Thanx for this recipe!

This is definitely a delicious and tasty chocolate chip cookie. I specifically enjoyed the addition of the ground oats. It gave them a different texture than normal oatmeal cookies. The dough, however, did not spread at all. I would recommend rolling the dough into balls and flattening it before baking and also letting them stay in the oven for 9 minutes. Overall, everyone enjoyed them! I would make these again!

Perfect.  I baked mine for 9 minutes instead of the recommended 6-8 because I like a crispier cookie.  Wonderful taste and texture.

I thought these cookies had a great texture and were pretty good, but too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will reduce the amount of white sugar.

These are excellent chocolate chip cookies! I love the texture and flavour, and they're nice and soft, but not cake-like.  Definitely worth the extra time this recipe takes.  First-time recipe users: the dough gets very thick and your mixer may not be able to manage, so get ready with your wooden spoons...but don't worry, the cookies turn out awesome and worth the extra effort!!

These were delicious cookies! I made some as a gift for my brother-in-law Tim (what else do you get for the man who has everything? LOL) along with some brown butter cookies, also from this site. He loved them! So did I! The one gripe I had is that my dough was kind of stiff, but it did give me a truly stupendous cookie, so why should I complain?

Absolutely positively delicious.  I even added raisins to one batch and sweetened cranberries.  Everyone who eats them loves them.  I'm glad it makes such a large batch.  I had planned to give two dozen each to some students going away to the college, but my office staff commandered two dozen.  I had to go back home and get more to mail out.

When I added the dry ingredients to the butter and sugar mixture, I used my fingers to thoroughly mix the ingredients together. I then used a small ice cream scoop to drop the cookies onto the cookie sheet.  My teenage son says they're the best chocolate chip cookie that he has even eaten. I definitely will bake these cookies again. They're simply terrific!

These are just glorified chocolate chip cookies.  They are good, but they create
quite a mess to make.  Definately use 1/2 recipe if using a hand mixer - mine
couldn't handle a whole recipe well (the one that makes 112 cookies).  Make 
sure that you blend the oatmeal in a blender - well.

I make this with different variations. Whether I want oatmeal/raisan/choc chip, pnb (1/2c pnb, 3/4 butter) choc chip, I even make one with 5X choc! (cocoa powder, choc syrup, milk choc, white choc & semisweet chips) truly disgusting lol. In other words you can make anything with this great base for a cookie!

The only reason it got 4 cards for easiness is because you have to blend the oatmeal into powder.  other then that it is really easy.
Anyway,  this is by far the best chocolate chip cookie recipie.  It's not the average toll house recipe.  It has a very unique flavor.  My wife and I found this recipe years ago online, and have loved it ever since.  The first time we made them, I took a batch in to work with me, and now everyone thinks my wife is a master chef.  Awesome cookies.

My family likes these cookies.  It does take
longer to mix up than some other recipes.  I have
made it twice now and I have to increase the baking
time for 9-10 minutes.  I toast the nuts before I add
to the mix.  It really seems to bring out the nut flavor. It's
a "keeper".

This was a great recipe and a hit with the neighbor kids and my co-workers.  I even used leftover grated Easter chocolate instead of a block of baking chocolate and that was a great way to use up the candy!

This is the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had! I made this exactly like the recipe called for and it was really good. Then, I was trying to make it again and I forgot to grind the oats and wow!!! They tasted even better. These cookies were moist and truly delicious! This is definitely my go-to cookie recipe.

I did not grind the oats very fine- I left them fairly coarse to give more texture and oat flavor to the cookies. I also did not add the additional chocolate shavings, just the chocolate chips and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.

The only changes, outside of mix-ins (which should be inconsequential unless they add more liquids/ fats or change the dynamic of the media in the recipe, in which case I would know to make the required modifications) I made were pertaining to my altitude. Now, I know baking up here is LESS than ideal(7k ft above sea level) but most ventures have been ameliorated with my fool-proof ratio guide I devised myself based on the better homes and gardens cookbook. I DONT know where this went so wrong, I had even added an extra egg, just for good measure when applying the “extra liquid” rule to the recipe, also of course adding extra butter(by way of shortening) and some brandy- along with almond meal for the extra flour& 1/4 cup extra, reduced both leaveners by half, as well as salt. These are just standard things I have to do up here& I don’t usually have problems like I’ve been having ever since I moved& got a new OLD stove. I’m going to try this recipe again- itd be so excellent if u could get it to work. Choco chip is hubbys FAV& when I did basically this same rev just down the st they were AH MA ZING! These were BRIQUETTES, once cooled, and in the last batch I had to remove almost half of the mix-ins because they wouldn’t hold together with them included, I bit the bullet& added what I felt was missing, water... only the last batch is edible AT ALL:( keep the rest around for dunking or to send to enemies as a passive aggressive post-holiday “gift” prompt to see the dentist.

I followed SLWDANIELS' tips on increasing soda and powder, but did not have grated chocolate to add. Cookies turned out chewy and moist. First two dozen were just choco chip, for the second two dozen, I added a cup of toffee bits. So yummy!

These cookies turned out great, and were very familiar to me, so I looked in my old recipes that I copied from my mother’s recipe box over 20 years ago, and I grandmother made these cookies as a serious treat for everyone when I was a kid! I believe she’d also keep the dough frozen, because her recipe is a double batch, so when company was due to arrive, she’d have easy, fresh- baked cookies. Her recipe was called ‘Neiman Marcus Cookies’ because she either got the recipe from the Columbus Dispatch newspaper, or from an old Neiman Marcus catalog. Thank for the trip down memory lane! These will be in my  repertoire from now on!

straight out of the oven these are excellent!
I left the oats unground as I like the texture, and didn't bother grating any chocolate, just put in some chocolate chips, but may consider putting in the full amount of (unchopped) choc chips.

I did the recipe exactly as written. I would never feed margarine to my family! I am really careful with trans fat. My cookies were chewy and perfect, they did not spread  at all, you just have to learn how to work with butter. I also added white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.

This has become my #1 chocolate chip cookie recipe. I found this recipe 20+ years ago but forgot about it. I love the coffee in it but many times leave it out because some people don't like coffee. Strange. The dough freezes well as well as the baked cookies. I use a small ice cream scoop to form these and press them down with my hand before baking. I made a double batch for Valentines and gave them out to neighbors and friends and they raved about them. Many smiles

Came out great. I didn't add as much oats (1-C) and only           
    (1-C)walnuts. added 1/2-C more flour and only 1/3 -C ground chocolate chips. Mix a little dry  and added 1/3-C of water.

I added a bit extra baking soda and refrigerated before and after balling. This keeps the cookie nice and tall. They baked up in 8 minutes first bake then 9 minutes for the third and final, chilling until used (got 59 cookies). Nice and tall, Debbie is on her third now.

Just from reading this recipe it has too many dry ingredients.  Good chocolate chip cookies must have a little shortening.  If they don't the butter makes them greasy flat and crunchy.  I prefer a soft chewy cookie.  My personal preference.  I would decrease the amount of flour (a typical recipe has 2 1/4 cups flour to one cup butter and they are adding oats on top of that) to 1 2/3 cups and oats to 1 1/4 cup.  I would do half shortening and half butter.

I followed the recipe as written  the only addition was that I ground the oatmeal.  The dough was very dry.  I decided to added another  large egg (3 total) which improved the consistency  of the dough.  Because of the large batch, I  refrigerated the extra dough.  The next day it was hard as a brick. I allowed the dough to sit at room temperature and it became only slightly more manageable.   I decided to make one large cookie . I plan to try this recipe again with less oatmeal. The flavor of the cookies was good.

These are really terrific cookies, crisp, sweet and with the oatmeal, very satisfying as well.  I followed the directions exactly as written, except I didn't have any milk chocolate chips, so I cut up a block of Mexican chocolate  and added that.  I made them fairly small, so have more than 60, but they will not go to waste. Maybe my waist.  Probably my waist.  I live in Guatemala and homemade cookies are almost unheard of here, so these will be very well accepted.  If you MUST make changes, think about adding coconut instead of walnuts, or some cinnamon.  In my opinion, this doesn't need tweaking.

My family loved these cookies! I made as written omitting the walnuts and grated chocolate (because I forgot). These were perfect and were perfect for our ice cream sandwiches.

If you're looking for hearty and chewy, this recipe makes the best chocolate chip cookie ever! I normally skip the milk chocolate shavings (makes it too sweet in my opinion) or put a 1/2 cup of the semi-sweet morsels in the food processor.

I had  tub of rolled oats that no one eats so threw just over a cup into the bullet mixer for a  few shakes to powder the majority of it mixed with 1 cup bleached flour and did a half batch. Added 1/4 tsp crème of tartar to my wet ingredients and used margarine. Did 2 test cookies @350 (176)  for 10 minutes. A little pale  and the bottom edge ran very minutely. The rest of the batch is in the fridge until the morning awaiting the proper 375 (190) temp. Excellent cookies, can't wait to eat, errm... I mean bake the rest.

A very good cookie with the healthy addition of ground oats.  Good to have the 1/2 recipe listed here.  The full recipe is hard to mix in a stand mixer.  
I found you can decrease each of the sugars by 1/8 cup with changing the texture.  I also use white whole wheat flour.

I placed green and red chips on the top of the raw cookie prior to baking to have a Christmas themed cookie.  I increase the baking powder and baking soda just a tad to give it a little more fluff.  Don't forget the salt or vanilla.  This is a very good, from scratch, chocolate chip cookie.

Nice tasty cookie - I followed the suggestion to add a little more baking powder and some baking soda.  Makes a nice dense cookie without grinding the oatmeal.  I will definitely make again.

I have  made these cookies many times and they are delicious just as the recipe states.  I have made only slight changes to my taste.  Instead of  grating chocolate, I used milk chocolate chips.  I also decreased each  kind of sugar by 1/4 cup.  I increased the baking soda and baking powder by 1/2 teaspoon each to make a cookie that is a little higher.  I like to use black walnuts for the nuts, but if I am taking the cookies to an event, I leave the nuts out, since so many seem to be allergic to nuts.

This was a disaster. After chilling for over an hour and then putting these in the oven, I opened it to find one big flattened mess. The only thing I have concluded I must have done wrong was using quick rolled oats? We ate them as crumbles. Super sweet and nutty, but a huge disappointment.

I followed the recipe exactly.  the taste was fine but my cookies did not spread out and the first batch came out like little balls.  for the next batches I flattened them with the bottom of a glass  and they came and they came out flat, exactly as I had put them in the oven. I like d the idea of putting the oatmeal  in the blender first.  It did had a nutty flavor but not the texture of big pieces of oatmeal.  Oh, and 6 minutes is not enough.  I had to cook each batch for 8 to 10 minutes.  8 minutes when I flattened them and 10 when they were in little balls.

06-08-16 ~ Delicious cookie that I've made for many, many years. This recipe makes a lot of cookies, and I made a ton as I used my small cookie scoop. I wanted a lot of them to share with numerous people. I made two cookie sheets without the walnuts added, for my son. I then added the walnuts to the rest of the dough. A delicious cookie that holds it shape well and remained soft and chewy for days in an airtight container.

Made these and they were a hit!  WERE cuz they're gone now. Some changes I made due to ingredients on hand:  I used almond meal instead of rolled oats. Added that with the other dry ingredients to the food processor. Also instead of grated chocolate that I did not have I added half cup of mini chocolate chips and gave them a whirl in processor with flour mix. I also added almost a cup of coconut and pecan pieces. Probably the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. Thanks for sharing.
Update; Made these gems again today though this time I only had a cup of almond meal so I added a cup of ground flax seed in place of rolled oats. I also added coconut, raisins and chopped pecans again. Turned out great.
Updated Update: This is now my Go-To cookie recipe. They are the bomb!

I heard the same story and she was so upset over the charge that she put the recipe out for everyone to try. The recipe I got was called "250 Cookie Recipe." It is the best cookie I've ever tasted and I highly recommended it. The recipe I used made like 20-40 dozen so I had plenty to share with friends and to store in the freezer. Well worth the work if you're looking for a Award winning, mouth watering cookie.

Great cookie recipe! Grating the chocolate bar was a bit of a pain but worth it. If you prefer a chewy cookie you will need to underbake considerably as these cookies crisp up even when underbaked.

These are absolutely amazing.  I had this partial recipe years ago (minus the ground up milk chocolate)...it was good, but adding the chocolate takes it to a much higher level.  The extra steps of grinding up the oatmeal and chocolate are well worth it!

I used my coffee bean grinder to grind the oatmeal. Only could do about a half cup at a time, but worked great. To get the grated chocolate, I froze four ounces of chocolate chips and then ground them in the coffee grinder as well.  Was shocked at what a fine chocolate powder this produced. I made sure my butter and eggs were at room temperature before I started.  I refrigerated the dough, then rolled the cold dough into walnut-sized balls for baking. These are so good! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made larger cookies, in total about 48. Ended up cooking them about 13 minutes. They are very chocolate-y and delicious. Next time I make them, though, I will mash them flatter. They don't flatten while cooking.

I added a smidge more vanilla, because I do that.  These are the best! These are the new "go to". Search over.

i followed the advice from other reviews and reduced sugars to 3/4 cup. Didn't have any chocolate chips so used butterscotch, pecans and some left over chocolate buttons chopped up. Also used stone cut oats as thats what i had in the pantry - delicious!

Excellent recipe.  Beautiful and delicious cookies.  I followed the recipe except that I used pecans because I did not have any walnuts.  Oven temperature and cooking time are exact.  Will use this again and again.

I will make these again and have added this recipe to my collection of favorites!  So tasty, soft and chewy.  The only thing I omitted was the ground chocolate.  Didn't have any on hand.  May do so next time.  Never regret enhancing chocolate flavor in anything!

Decided to do this recipe tonight, but did half of the amount of everything without adding the Milk chocolate grated. I also did 2 tsp of baking powder instead, because my father is sensitive to the taste of baking soda, he can taste it in anything.

These cookies turned out perfect, for what I would want when it comes to chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. When they were ready, no part was burnt, it was evenly cooked and they were still chewy once cooled. My kids loved them, and I loved them, and hoping my father likes them even more. Going to save this recipe in my bookmarks and even write it down in a recipe book. Thank you so much for sharing it online, and so grateful I came across it.

My all time favorite cookie.  I use 60% cacao chocolate chips, and also a 60% cacao bar for the grated chocolate.  I use a half cup walnut pieces and a half cup pecan pieces.  Rave reviews from friends and family.  The recipe as written is ginormous, so I use half the dough, roll it into cookie size balls, and put it on a cookie sheet in the freezer.  Then when my wife wants fresh chocolate chip cookies, I just grab a few balls and put them in the oven for an extra minute or so.

I made these on a whim (late night sweet tooth). I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it made 2.5 dozen cookies (I did 1 oz dough blobs). They are so yummy! I used dark chocolate chips & put some milk chocolate Hershey's kisses in the food processor (left over chocolate from the Christmas stockings!).  These have a very bold flavor...love them!  They don't spread very much--which i love! I just pressed them down on the pan prior to baking. Very yummy :) This will be my "GO TO" recipe.

I really wanted this recipe to blow my socks off!   In reality it was just ok, maybe a little on the dry side, nothing special.  Put them on my Christmas platter and only half a dozen were eaten.  They sure looked good though.  In all fairness, I will try again.

These were really heavy cookies with the oatmeal. Very good. I did make the mistake of using 1/2 cup of quick-cook oats since I ran out of the rolled oats (did use the 2 cups) which made the cookies VERY crumbly but to my amazement they held up very well when cooked. I might just use a little less oatmeal next time though.

Yummy cookie!  I'm a cookie novice so I was nervous that I had to tweak it for high altitude but all I did was  add 1 cup extra flour and reduced the heat of the oven to 350 deg.  I did not powder the oatmeal, used pecans instead of walnuts, added 1 cup of coconut flakes and frankly, I got tired of grating the milk chocolate so only added about 2 oz instead of the 4 but I can see how the grated chocolate adds a lot of flavor to the overall cookie.  Very good recipe!

Not a true chocolate chip cookie taste and mouth feel in my opinion. Also, the grated chocolate makes them look less appetizing as well. A good cookie, but not at all what comes to mind when I think of a legendary chocolate chip cookie. With more ground oats than flour, they really should have the word legendary changed to make room for the more descriptive word "oatmeal" in the title. I think anyone who loves oatmeal cookies might enjoy them, but for me searching for the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I found them very lacking in texture and flavor. Your mileage may vary.

Very good cookie recipe. Very different from the typical tollhouse chocolate chip cookie. My cookies came out a little cake- like not greasy at all. These cookies don't spread out. I did use more baking soda and more baking  powder (1/2 t more of each) as others suggested. I used butter. For the chips, I used 1 and a half cups total.  This was plenty.  I used 1c Ghirardelli bittersweet choc. chips and 1/2 cup semisweet choc. chips. I will use the Ghiradelli  chips again as  they are extra wide and make a great presentation in the cookie.  Also, STIR in the flour mixture DO NOT use an electric mixer in this step.  It's a very thick batter, so be prepared to use your arm muscles!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I've been looking for a go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies and I think I found it! I like the crispness of the outside and the crunch from the walnuts. I love a good portion of chocolate and crunch in my cookies and I feel like I get exactly what I want. I will definitely make this again!

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe instructed and they came out perfectly!  Just like the store they supposedly originated from!  I work at a television station where I am a writer (and resident baking expert.)  Can't wait to deliver these babies this afternoon - I am pretty sure I will get a standing ovation for them.  They might even get mentioned on air :)

Pretty  good. Didn't add the nuts or the grated chocolate (didn't have any). Managed 4 dozen decent sized cookies out of the dough, though all of them singed a little on the bottom. Likely my oven's fault, so I dropped the temp to 350F.

I'm here to say that you can make this mistake and the cookies are still fantastic: you can not read the directions and end up using whole oats and be just fine. I did use awesome chocolate and cut it into chunks.

This was a really good recipe - it meets the expectations of the legend. I added 1/4 cup of chunky peanut butter to get the nutty taste and did 1/2 brown rice flour with regular flour.

This recipe is AWESOME! I did make changes based on what I had in my home. Instead of milk chocolate I ground white chocolate squares in  the blender.I only had quick oats, so I reduced the quantity to 2 cups. I didn`t add nuts. I also made the cookies really big. They are super delicious!

I found out I was really short on oats when making these cookies and added one and a half cups flax seed and one cup of oats instead of the two and a half cups of oats. Guess what? They turned out great! Nice and healthy too!

I just made these, and they were amazing! I looked in the reviews and watched them while they were baking. As soon as the edges turned brown, I took them out. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and exactly what I was hoping for. Great with cold milk! I'll be making these again soon.

Very good.  Made as directed, but used pecans instead of walnuts.  (Also, I always bake with white whole wheat flour and evaporated cane sugar.)  Baked about 9-10 minutes on a baking stone.  Made exactly 5 dozen using a medium cookie scoop.  Soft and yummy!

Good cookie, but it takes much longer to prepare than my standard recipe.  Might make without nuts next time as it is kind of dry.

I replaced the nuts with caramel bits and sprinkled the tops of the dough balls with fine sea salt right before baking.  We always underbake these a bit so they have fudgy centers.  They are fantastic cookies for shipping since they don't go stale for almost a week.

I found this story/recipe in my e-mail several years ago, and I thought the story was so great I had to try the cookies!!  The recipe I got specified Hershey's chocolate bars for the grated chocolate, and it is my favorite chocolate bar so that's what I've always used, but I have experimented with toffee chips and other chip variations. I love the idea about using the multiple kinds of mini-bars! We have leftover Halloween candy from last week so I'm going to try this!  This is hands down my favorite chocolate chip cookie!!

Very nice cookies, yet more the cakey type. I did not have milk chocolate at hand, so I used 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons sour cream (heavy cream would work just fine, too). For my taste, the sugar was enough (even though I had reduced it to 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white sugar), so I did not add any additional sugar. And I left out the nuts because my kids don't like them.
The cookies came out great. I had made them using two tablespoons to drop them, but could have gently rolled them with my hands as well. They took about 12 minutes to bake, because they were a bit larger than the recipe indicats. I got 50 cookies out of it. The secret is to take them out of the oven just when the tips start to turn slightly golden. If you take them out sooner, they will deflate and still be raw inside, if you let them get darker, they will be dry and hard.
For my taste, they were a bit too sweet, so next time I'll reduce the sugars to 1/2 cup each, being aware that this will change the texture even more to the cakey side as well, but I'm fine with that. Nice chocolatey taste. Thanks for the recipe!

It takes some work, but they are really good.  I am not sure why mine tend to be flat, but I am working on that.  I roll them all into balls and freeze the un-cooked cookies, like the ones you get in the freezer section, and they turn out the same as if you just made the dough.  You just have to cook them a little longer.  I did not grind my oatmeal this time, and they still turned out good.

This is my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe, although with a few variations.  I usually use dark chocolate chips (and sometimes half peanut butter chips), pecans instead of walnuts and I often add some chopped dried berries (blueberries, cranberries, cherries - or a combo of these) instead of the grated chocolate.  The two most important factors in not having dry cookies is making sure your oats are well ground (they should be fine and flour-like) and that you are not over-baking them.  Take them out of the oven when they just begin to darken in colour the teeniest bit.  Let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or two and then transfer to cooling racks.  If you take them out at the right time, they will be so soft that you won't want to move them off the baking sheet right immediately.

Perfect! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out brilliant. Only thing I might do different next time is put 1/2 cup fewer walnuts. There are so many choc chips and walnuts that occassionally the cookie dough couldn't hold it all together.

These chocolate chip cookies are the BEST (and a little more healthy than the 'regular' variety). When I make my cookies I decrease the heat to 350 degrees (I usually decrease cooking temperature for all cookies, cakes, and breads I make - a trick learned from my family in the restaurant/bakery business). I also use a small cookie scoop (the smaller, the better) - which provides evenly sized cookies and helps them to bake more uniformly.

These are so wonderfully different from your everyday chocolate chip cookie. Even my oatmeal-phobic husband can't stop eating these by the plateful.  This recipe would make too many cookies for my little family if it weren't for how addictive they are.

We love oatmeal choc chip cookies and these were excellent.  With the oatmeal ground up it wasn't quite like a typical oatmeal cc but it gives it all the flavor.  Very good, rich and delicious - new fav!

Very good cookie.  I received the email of the urban legend.  Checked here to see if the reviews were good, which they were!  Two things I did different: I didn't add nuts, and I baked at 300, for 18 minutes, cooled on sheet about 1 minute, before removing to the rack.  Very good.  My picky chocolate chip cookie husband even liked these.

You've found THE best chocolate chip cookies around. Look no further, I've made these time and time again, and they are no fail if you do the recipe as written. If you prefer less sweet you could reduce the sugar to your taste but as they are, they are excellent. Use parchment paper for perfectly even baking:)

I made these cookies yesturday, and they are the best ever! Grinding up the oatmeal works great, you get the taste without the texture. They are still just as soft and good as I am eating them right now! When a recipe calls for butter I always use sticks of unsalted butter, it works best for me. I was thinking I would do these again and add some raisins, just to try it out! Perfect and easy..

These were just ok....2.5 stars I would say.  I am daily baker and cookies are my specialty.  These were bland and really nothing special about them at all.  Definitely wouldn't make again.  My family wondered why I made such blah cookies yesterday.  They are just missing something...can't put my finger on it though.

I loved this recipe!  I  took them to work and they were a hit. They are little more labor intensive then your average cc cookie but well worth it.  I added a 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips to the food processor with the oatmeal. heaven!

This is so funny to me! I have been making this recipe since I was a little girl, and I mean THIS recipe (I have it memorized). I might have started making it in 1986 or '87. Anyway, I never knew that it was the "Neiman Marcus Urban Legend Cookie" or anything. My mom's friend gave me a handwritten index card with the recipe and I still have it. 
The cookies are sooooo good, and I don't know how anyone can fail, unless they do not mix the ingredients properly. Margarine brings a different outcome than butter, but you cooks knew that already. The older I've gotten, the less chocolate chips I add to the mix. Too much chocolate spoils the oatmeal texture.

I have been making these cookies for about 5 years now and everywhere I take them, I get compliments galore. I mentioned I was making them to a co-worker the other day and she remembered them in an instant. These are a fantastic cookie, great for gifting to co-workers during holiday time. Trust me, they will be begging for this recipe.

I need help I have followed this recipe exactly the way it is listed. However my cookie even after being in the oven for 11 to 12 minutes has a raw oat taste smell that I don't like. The cookie is still soft mind you. But just tastes like raw oats. Please advise. I am rating it a five because I have had my friends cookies and she followed the same recipe I am probably just doing something wrong.

I wish I could give this 10 stars!!! They were sooooooo yummy! MY husband loved them as well. I creamed the butter and sugar and then used my hands(they are the best tools you got)to mix in everything else. I kept them in an airtight container and they are so chewy and yummy! I also used milk cho. chips as they were the only ones I had. SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD!

My husband makes these cookies every year at Christmas - they are so good! They are a little time consuming, but well worth it. He pretty much sticks to the recipe and for the milk chocolate he grates Hershey's chocolate bars. They freeze well, too. Yum, Yum!

This has been my all-time favorite cookie recipe for years. The only thing I don't add is the grated chocolate, but it is still delicious without it!

My grandmother and I made this recipe many times. Lately I have been melting the chocolate instead of grating it to save on cleaning the food processor. It was a big hit last year at the bake sale, etc.

This made incredible cookies!  I ran out of butter so had to use margarine and this still turned out awesome!  We did half with chocolate chips and half with peanut butter chips.  I had a recipe similar to this a long time ago and was happy to find it again here.  Thanks

I have made this three times.My family loves this recipe! Whenever my husband wants chocolate chip cookies, they want me to make them. They stayed chewy for a few days. I also agree with another review, make sure to grind the oatmeal up very thin (i used my food chopper) or else the texture is a little grainy. 
Very good!

The batter was really dry and difficult to clump together.  The cookies also became really hard the day after I baked them.  I couldn't get them to look like that picture at all, but they tasted OK.

Loved this recipe-- cookies much heartier than tollhouse, which i wanted.  we took advice of one reviewer and cut sugars to 3/4C each, and also substituted 2T of nutella for the milk chocolate (will try 4T next time).  turned out delicious-thanks!

Great recipe - make these often and they always turn out fine.  To save our shapes I usually freeze half the dough for another time, rolled into a sausage ready to slice off, or we would just keep eating!

Haven't made these in years and they were just as good as I remember.  I think I prefer the toll house recipe with a bit of extra flour but this was food for a change.  I used semi sweet and milk choc mini chips instead of the bar.  I may have added too much flour because I am used to adding extra to the toll house recipe but these were still very good.

yummy, They all got eaten in 2 days... 
I thought I would make these a little bit healthy, haha  so I replace 1 1/2 cups of the white flour with wheat flour and it worked out pretty good, the cookies ended up having more texture but nobody in my family even noticed.

This recipe was great.  To lower fat I halved the recipe and substituted 1/4 c. mashed banana for half of the butter.  It was still very soft, moist, and delicious.

I've now made this recipe twice. The only thing I didn't follow exactly, was I used margarine instead of butter.  These cookies are moist and chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. I love the texture that the ground up oatmeal gives these cookies. This is by far my favorite chocolate chip cookie.

These were so yummy. The rolled oats gave it such a great nutty flavor. Make sure to only cook for 8 minutes or else they get to hard!! I will absolutely be making again.

I LOVED these and so did my friends that were not "cookie" people!  I left the oatmeal a little chunky and only use 1.5 c of chocolate chips.  So chewy and yummy!  The key is to only bake about 6-7 minutes.  They will not look done at all but they will harden up after a few minutes out of the oven.  They will stay chewy for days this way.  I believe this recipe is also known as the Neiman Marcus Cookie.

I first reviewed these a couple of years ago and apparently loved them. I made them again, and I don't know why but this time I wasn't as impressed. Made exactly as stated and these were a little dry and crumbly. The only thing I can think of is that this time I didn't grind up the oatmeal as fine. I didn't think they were anything legend worthy and won't make again.

I have made this recipe many times with great results every time but this was my first time modifying it....so easy to do.
I substituted 1/2 of the flour with 1/4 cup wheat bran and 1/4 cup ground flax seed without hesitation.  I didn't have 4 oz of chocolate to grate I only had 2oz and they turned out great.  I also didn't have the full amount of nuts so I added raisins and coconut...and Scor bits because I didn't have enough chocolate chips.

Yummy yummy yummy

These just didn't cook well the first time. Too crunchy. I think it matters the type of oats. Rolled must be very important, I gather. I tried with steel cut, and I ground them finely but it was like biting into a sand. I tried them a second time, and...  they were much better. Subtle peanut like taste. Upping my rating to 4.5.

These were highly addictive! I did find though, that there was so much "stuff" in these that you had to squish them a little bit when rolling them to get them to stick together in a ball, but that certainly didn't take away from their goodness!

We have made a variation of these cookies for years & I have to say that they are the best cookies I have ever eaten.  

One of our favorite changes is using half milk chocolate, half semi-sweet chocolate.

And I will agree that these make a lot of cookies-our batches can generate over 100 cookies, so we freeze some of the dough to enjoy later.

These turned out great!  They stayed soft until used up a few days later.  The oats gives them an awesome texture too.  Definitely the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found so far.

MMMM!!!  My husband and I loved the cookies....they were very soft and yummy!
I baked them for 8-9min. I only put 2 cups of oatmeal. The cookies will look kinda pale at 8min. but they are ready if you like them soft. Once they cool for a few minutes they will flatten and look much better...they taste much better than they look!!

This was the first chocolate chip cookie recipe i tried from this site, and i have to say i picked the right recipe! it turned out so good, all the cookies (i made 30 of them) were all finished within 2 days by me and my boyfriend! i made the cookies 2 more times, one with the oats not ground and another one with cocoa powder to make a double chocolate - followed the rest of the recipe exactly. the cookies NEVER failed to taste delicious!

Tastes great, but I am not sure if it's worth the time and effort.  It's a rather time-consuming and labour intensive recipe.  I think I might be able to achieve similar results with a simpler recipe.

I've heard this story numerous times and have always wanted to try the cookies!  They were very good.  Of course you could taste the oatmeal in them, but the texture was smoother than a regular oatmeal cookie since the oats were ground.  I used unsalted butter and quick cooking oats.

Wonderful recipe. Surprising and delicious. I have tried other recipes but was never able to get this kind of texture, which I am definitely happy about. I skipped the walnuts and chocolate and just added white chocolate chips; and I reduced the amount of oats as well. It turned out the best, definitely a keeper.

I have been making these for years. Today I used whole wheat flour, and they turned out great.  Not too flat, not too fluffy.  I have used  butter as well as margarine, and honestly I cannot tell the difference in this recipe.  (I usually prefer butter in all of my other recipes)
They really are great.  I saw one reviewer say that she used one tsp of almond extract.  I just happened to have some on hand, so I added the almond extract in addition to the vanilla extract.  Delicious.  I don't care where this recipe originated, just as long as I have it!

I halved the recipe, and ended up with plenty of cookies. I ommitted the grated chocolate because I'm lazy, and substituted dark chocolate chips in order to cut down on sweetness. Would make again.

wonderful flavour! the oatmeal and grated chocolate added dimension to the flavour of these cookies. the texture was a little cakey for my tastes, but this might have been due to my substituting half of the all-purpose  flour with white wheat. these taste better after they have cooled down.
side note: even my sister, who detests everything made with oatmeal, loved these cookies.

I like this cookie.  It's one of the best I've made.  I got lazy when it got time to shave the milk chocolate and happily discoverd I had some leftover mini-chips in my pantry.  You can taste the oatmeal in the cookie without the added texture.  It's a real beautiful cookie when it's finished.  The only drawback is that I didn't enjoy the taste of the dough as much as the recipes on the back of the chocolate chips.  But, that should be a positive because I didn't sneak as many nibbles.

Made these cookies, but the only change I made was that I used milk choc. chips and chopped them ultra fine in place of the grated milk chocolate.  They were absolutely wonderful.  I am sure I will make these again.  Makes a nice sized batch!

I was disappointed by these cookies. The oatmeal taste was overwhelming, so they tasted like oatmeal rather than chocolate-chip cookies. My boyfriend's father really liked them, however.

This recipe is good, but too sweet for my taste.  I converted it to gluten free using Pamelas baking mix in place of the flour. Used Mccanns oatmeal.

After finding this recipe, I just finished making a batch.  I was sorry to see this method is not the exact method -they came out very dry.  I made them step by step according to the recipe, including mixing method.  After I baked one batch, and saw how dry they tasted, I mixed by hand one more whipped egg to the remaining batter.  They came out much nicer.  So, maybe try your batch with three eggs from the beginning.  Also, be careful not to add extra graded chocolate, they become too sweet. (If you can imagine that)

Well not thrilled. I am still looking for that perfect cookie. I didn't add the oats, but everything else I did the same. Not sure that could of added to give it a 5 star. Mine came out flat.

It turned out beautiful, but I found I needed to cook mine for a minute or two longer then the directions stated. 
I added a teaspoon of dissolved instant coffee for a slight mocha flavour. Boyfriend and friends ate them all over one night.

Sorry, but I didn't see why these are so great. A good chocolate chip cookie needs to be very sweet, regardless of baked texture (soft or crispy). I didn't find these worth the time or ingredients. I used chopped candied pecans instead of walnuts and the cookie still wasn't sweet enough. A Teaspoon of cinamon improved the recipe, but I won't bother making this one again. I had such high hopes based on all the great reviews. Maybe my gourmet cookie expectations are too high.

I altered the recipe a little, and it turned out great.  My 5 picky kids loved them.  I used 1 C. white flour & 1 C. whole wheat pastry flour. I only ground 1 1/2 C. Oatmeal and added the last cup whole.  Then I added 1/2 C. unsweetened coconut. It turned out fantastic.  I reminds me of the cookies they leave on your bed at a certain hotel chain in the mornings.  Even though they have oatmeal & wheat flour, they don't taste the least bit good for you, they're yummy!

I have made these many times in the past, each time very delicious!  I had lost my copy and was happy to find it on this website.  I took another person's suggestion and did't grate the candy bar, but smashed it with a mallet.  Much quicker and less mess this way.

The cookies were pretty good....but i personally do not like walnuts or oatmeal cookies so I took those ingredients out. Then the cookies were really runny so I added a cup of flour...after that they were pretty flat. Overall though....the cookie dough was good!!! :)

My family really loved these cookies and thought the story behind it was comical. We do not like walnuts so I left them out and added a few extra chocolate chips and it turned out great, not flat like most of my choclate chip cookies turn out!

The secret to this recipie is to refrigerate the batter over night then bake. The cookies come out thicker and softer. I made 1/2 a batter the day I mixed the ingredients and the rest the next day. The cookies tasted the best on the second day after the batter was left in the fridge overnight. I just recently got married and I don't know how to bake. My hubby got so impressed when I made these. I am looking forward to more baking! Thanks.

Beautiful , chewy, sweet and delicious!  These are to DIE for!  I'm replacing my old recipe with this one!  I like the grounded oats in it because (in my oppinion)  it makes the cookie a perfect medium between "oatmeal" cookies and original "chocolate chip" cookies.  It's the best of both worlds!  I can't believe how well they present themselves too.  If at first you don't succeed when making these, then try again - because these recipe is PERFECTION!!!

I had to make these cookies just because of the title.  I thought that they were dry and they had too much oats in them for a chocolate chip cookie.  I don't think I will ever make them again.  My perfect chocolate chip cookie is more crunchy than soft and is not flat.  These cookies had no rise.  When I took them off the sheet they didn't really have any shape.

This recipe is fabulous!  My daughter loves choclate chip cookies, but is allergic to choclate.  I'm not particularly fond of choclate.  My husband thinks he's a choclate chip cookie connoisseur.  So it has always been impossible to satisfy everyone with one recipe.  This is it! This cookie (even without choclate) is so good it is still the favorite of my entire family and all of our friends. I only add 2-3 choclate chips per cookie (1-2 for my daughter) and increase the pecans and they are still requested everywhere I go.

This was just alright. The cookies came out flat and kind of hard around the edges, yet chewy in the middle which is good.  They have a good flavor to them.  The cookie dough was absolutely excellent but after baking, the cookies were just okay.

I made these with my kids, omitted the nuts, reduced the oats to 3/4 cup.  I was worried when I noticed they were spreading out pretty thin while baking, but after cooling (one minute) and trying, we've all decided this has got to be THE BEST choco chip cookies we've ever made, tasted!!! Chewy, chocolatey, crispy enough around the edges, awesome!!

This is the best chocolate chip recipe ever.  I've heard various stories about where it came from, but they are wonderful cookies.  If i dont have a food processor or blender on hand, i crush the oats by hand.

These are very good chocolate chip cookies.  I've made them twice.  The second time I reduced the ground oats to 2 cups and this made the cookies a bit more moist.  The first time I made them they were a little to crispy.

These were GREAT the first day, but not quite as chewy and moist the second. The oats gave the cookies a nice extra taste along with the other flavors. Everyone who has tasted these loves them. A woman at my husband's office called them sinful. :)

I didn't have any grated chocolet so i just blended a 1/3 cup chocolet chips in my blender. I also added an extra egg....
I feed these cookies to two second graders they said that they were the best cookies ever in the whole wide world.These are Yummy in our tummys... They said they would rate them a seven and a ten star cookies if they could. 
Thank you for this recipe!!

Excellent. I use Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and skip the other chocolate. My family loves the oat taste and the fine texture from putting the oats in the blender. We love these cookies!

These cookies were too much work for how they tasted. I would say they were "OK." My husband was indifferent - it was something for him to eat that he didn't have to make. I probably will not make these again and if I should, I will not bother grinding the oats.

I have been making these cookies for years and everyone LOVES them.  I have found that they are much better when I leave the oats whole instead of grinding them up.  I also coarsely chop a large Hershey bar with almonds instead of grating a plain chocolate bar.  Very tasty.

WOW! As my son used to say, these are "All that AND a bag of chips". This cookie recipe is by far the biggest crowd pleaser I have ever encountered. I have made these twice in one week just for my coworkers, they cant get enough. I did not add the grated chocolate, and only used milk chocolate chips. Rene, I cant thank you enough for this one.

After all I've heard about this "urban legend" recipe, I was expecting something really amazing.  My family thought these cookies were good, but not great.  I used my food processor to chop the nuts and grind together the oatmeal and milk chocolate, but otherwise followed the recipe.

These cookies are very good. I was just a slight bit disappointed because they weren't the best I've ever had, but still delicious. My husband loved to eat the batter and I wasn't sure I would have any left to bake! I used the blender to grind the oatmeal and grate the chocolate at the same time and it worked well.

Also known as the (mythical) Neiman Marcus cookie, this is a rich, dense cookie with a hearty, homemade flavor. Use high quality chocolate for the best results. Travels well, which makes it a popular addition to college care packages. Rated A+

These cookies are absolutely exquisite! The oats really give them a nice flavor and texture...yum! I made two batches, one without the grated chocolate and one with, they are both great! So if you really love chocolate add the grated, if not, they still come out great!

I have used this recipe for a couple years.  I actually found it somewhere else but they are the absolute best cookies.  I used to love Mrs. Fields cookies and now I never go there anymore.  I just make these instead...they are better than any other cookies I have tried and I get requests for them from everyone I know.

"Wildrose" (left feedback for this recipe on 12/8) said the cookies were dry and crummy and the batter almost ruined her mixer. I'm guessing she did not follow the recipe where it says to STIR ingredients--not mix. This recipe is a little extra trouble, but not much--and worth every bit of effort!

I LOVE THESE COOKIES! THEY NOT LACKING ANYTHING. I MADE A BACTH WITH WALNUTS AND WITHOUT WALNUTS. BOTH WERE EXCELLENT. I PUT THE MIX IN THE FRIG FOR 2 HOURS BEFORE BAKING TO CREATE LESS SPREAD. THE RESULT WAS A CUTE PUFFY COOKIE THAT TASTED GREAT.

This is such a unique recipe for chocolate chip cookies. I didn't have shaved milk chocolate or walnuts so I omitted those and followed the rest of the recipe. They turned out great! I even thought that they were chocolaty enough that I wouldn't add the shaved milk chocolate unless I'd reduce the amount of choc chips. Perfect texture! crispy on the outside, soft on the inside!!

This is my all time favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.I have been making these delicious cookies for several years.My grandmother used to make these for me and I always thought they were so good.I like to make a big cookie so I use a heaping tablespoon and only bake them about 7 minutes.I like mine undercooked just a little.They are also delicious made into bars.Either way,these are the best cookies ever!

These were pretty good, but I found a recipe for these that adds crushed instant coffee instead of the grated chocolate and claims it is the recipe that the lady bought. I like that one better as it gives it a little something unusal.

a very typical cookie. i made them by rounded tsp and (of course) they were tiny! (but that just means you can eat more :D)  and they dont spread. i skipped out on the nuts and grated chocolate and cut the sugar to 3/4 c. each ~ that was perfect! nuts would go really well with the recipe though because oats naturally taste kinda nutty.

This was a good cookie, but not the best. They were good when they were still warm from the oven, but I didn't care for the texture, which was a bit hard and crumbly, once they cooled. I prefer a soft, chewy chocolate chip cookie. So if that is what you like too, I wouldn't recommend this cookie.

They're VERY good and simple to make.  My husband doesn't like walnuts though (but I like them) but I think next time I'll take them out or just put half the amount that the recipe calls for.  Other than that, they are excellent.  I took the batch to work and they devoured them!

I didn't stick to the recipe exactly, but these cookies turned out great!  Soft & chewy inside, crisp outside.  I didn't use nuts or the grated chocolate. Also, I doubled the vanilla and used only 1c of oats. Yummy! I definitely recommend.

Very soft and tasty, although I made a few changes. Instead of using grated chocolate, I just melted down 4 oz. of chocolate chips, and mixed it in in the very last step. It made it look very unique and tasted great! Also, next time I'll add about another cup of oats, and only grind down about half of it- I like the texture of oats.

I make these all the time but omit the grated chocolate and nuts. I also increase the vanilla by up to three times for more flavour and add 1/2 tsp more baking powder for a higher cookie. The sugar makes the cookie crisp but you can safely reduce the amt (either brown or white or a mix) by 1/3 cup so it isn't overly sweet.

I have been making these cookies for awhile, and they are always a hit.  Since I don't like nuts in cookies, I use toffee chips instead.  I grind them up, but not too much, so that some chips are ground almost to a powder but others are more or less whole.  The flavor is wonderful!

I have been making this recipe for a few years, and its one of my faves. I usually get asked for the recipe. One change I made however is, I melt the chocolate (I use hershey bars) and add it to the butter sugar,eggs etc, and I don't grind up the oatmeal. Although I might try that. These cookies are more like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, and my husband says they remind him of Dad's oatmeal cookies. I also omit the nuts so my kids can take them to school. I bake them for 10 minutes at 350. Nice and soft/chewey and they don't bake up too flat.

These were just "okay".  Personally I like Tollhouse better and wish that, instead of these, I had made the Tollhouse over Christmas holidays this year.

WOW!  This cookie is to die for!  I was so happy with the results.  The oats really make the cookie stand out!  Great recipe.  Now, I have to share with others :)

Have made them so many times, can't keep them around for long.  I always make double the receipe.  I like using different size icecream scoops from bite size to extra-large cookies!  My kids love to make these!  Thanks for the receipe!

This recipe is written like a doubled recipe or something.  Next time I think I will scale it down.  It was just too big to handle (especially trying to stir it all!)  It had great texture and taste.  I didn't have any chocolate bar to shave, but it was still very chocolatey and delicious!

I have to be honest and say that though, these cookies were quite tasty, they just didn't seem to compare to some store bought cookies I've had and therefore, the recipe didnt seem at all to be worth ALL the trouble. I rated this recipe so highly though because EVERYONE that tried these cookies said they loved them and begged for more... guess i was outnumbered.

Heavenly cookie recipe!! Truly good in texture, the powdered oats gave it a good chewy bite.
An abundance of chocolate in every bite. The best cookie recipe yet.

Makes a good cookie - much different than tollhouse, but richer and chewier.  I will make it again.

This cookie is the best, although not one to make when you're in a hurry.  I make these when I want to enjoy an afternoon of baking with my kids.  Instead of using the full amount of nuts I like to use half nuts (pecans are the best) and half toffee chips. These are the cookies I make whenever I want to treat someone.  They really are delicious and always well-received.

Absolutely delicious. The finely crushed oats give these cookies excellent texture. I omitted the milk chocolate because I didn't have it in my pantry and these cookies still came out wonderful. Make a lot, they go fast! thanks for sharing the recipe.

MY FAVORITE COOKIE RECIPE!!!! And trust me I have tried them all.  I am away at school and every time I come home the first thing that my sisters ask of me is to bake them these cookies.  That is all they seem to talk about.  If I could I would make these everytime I ran out.

This recipe was just O.K. Not the best cookies I have ever had. Pretty good texture but very hard to tell when they are ready, I overbaked them.  I am still looking for the ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe!  I might try again to make them.

We LOVE these cookies, they have a very good flavor to them.  I didn't use the nuts, and they were still delicious!  I grated the chocolate in my salad shooter, it worked!!!!  I can't wait to try the skor candy bar in them!

These are good but I prefer tollhouse.  The dough is stiff so it's hard to stir in the chocolate bits.  Also, don't overbake them or they'll be hard as rocks.  These grow stale pretty quickly, too.

These cookies are to die for, especially right out of the oven. They do take some time and effort, but after you take that first bit, you forget all about your exertions!

Although these take longer than other chocolate chip cookies, the quality of the final product is well worth the extra time.  Even though I only used 1 cup nuts and 1 oz. milk chocolate, the cookies were a hit with everyone who had them!

I too have heard the same story about these cookies.  I first heard it about 10-12 years ago in a Home Economics class in school, and I still have and enjoy the recipe.  They take some time to make but are well worth it.  They really are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever eaten.

This chocolate chip cookie recipe is by far the best one I've ever made...and I've made a LOT of cookies.  The ground oatmeal gives the cookie a more flavorful base than flour alone and the grated chocolate melts into the dough while baking to give the cookie an almost candy bar-like quality.  Very chewy on the inside, crisp around the edges...just like a cookie SHOULD be.  Best eaten with milk.
