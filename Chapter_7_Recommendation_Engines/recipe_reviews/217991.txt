Very dry and crumbly as recipe is written. The size of the egg +/or squash may have made a difference, but I was happier by adding 1/4 cup of water to the mixture.  Next time I will be adding herbs +/or hot sauce for more flavor!  This is a great starter recipe that can be altered to please the tastes of those who try this!

I didn't have enough onion and tried to substitute onion powder. I didn't add enough though lol. Despite that this was still really good, will make again.

Yum! I used a small summer squash and grapeseed oil instead of peanut oil. They had just the right amount of moisture and tasted great. Will definitely make again!
