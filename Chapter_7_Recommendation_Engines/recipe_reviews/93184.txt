I was not really pleased with this recipe. It not taste bad, however it was not good. It did have a nice presentation however. I would imagine if you made this for a group of people you would have no complaints, but no leftovers, because once they get cold they do not taste good at all.

*note: I did not alter this recipe at all in any way.

These were great! They make great snacks for game night and poker night and are super easy to fix.
