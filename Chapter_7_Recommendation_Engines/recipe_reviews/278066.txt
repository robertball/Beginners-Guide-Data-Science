It’s a good recipe. I made my own taco seasoning. Too many additives, plus sugar, in the store bought mix. I avoid processed foods and sugar  to cut down on inflammation.

It came out perfect! I always make a recipe exactly as instructed the first time and then the second time I tweak it a little to our taste but this one was great just the way it was presented. Thanks!

It’s easy to make, very healthy and filling. I added a bit of jalapeño pepper and just chopped the zucchini. Otherwise all ingredients as listed.

I added hominy instead of corn  and half a jar of flame roasted green Chile. It was excellent!

This was very delicious!  We put it in a wrap and added jalapenos.  Yum!
