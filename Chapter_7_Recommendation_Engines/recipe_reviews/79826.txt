We thought these were very good - the dough was very was to work with. I followed the recipe exactly. I think it will be my recipe for cut-outs for now on. The frosting had very good favor (I might add even a little more cherry jello next time). I don't think I beat the egg whites long enough because it was not very fluffy; regardless, I added some more powdered sugar and it thickened up fine. I doubled the recipe (made a lot) and all were gone in about two days. Everyone liked them and they looked great.

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  It was loose and greasy and had nowhere near enough flour.  It was like trying to roll out peanut butter and cut it into shapes and transfer to a cookie sheet.  And that was after refrigerating for a few hours.  I didn't get to try the icing, which sounded like the highlight of the cookie, but I would say, if you want to try the icing, make a different sugar cookie recipe first.  This one just does not work.
