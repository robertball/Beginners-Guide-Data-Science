This is actually more of a pudding cake, where the batter separates out during cooking into a top spongy layer and a bottom, sauce-pudding layer.  It is extremely good with the following changes: 
1/4 cup flour instead of 3 1/2 Tablespoons
1 tablespoon butter instead of 2
1 cup of milk instead of 2/3 cup
zest and juice of one lemon (or a juicy lime)
bake in a 1&1/2 quart dish that has been sprayed with cooking spray, and placed in a Bain-marie (water-bath).

I used the juice & zest of one lemon but otherwise followed the recipe. I  topped the pudding w/ raw sugar before baking to get a caramelized coat of sugar on the top. I garnished w/ lemon zest & another sprinkling of raw sugar after baking. We loved this dessert & will have it over & over! I baked it in a 1 1/2 quart souffle dish & served it in parfait glasses but next time I will decrease the cooking time & bake it in individual ramekins. I'm eager to try this w/ limes too. And oranges. Thanks for sharing the recipe Chessette!

Love this! I didn't alter the recipe at all and it was fabulous! Reminiscent of lemon bars and lemon merengue pie. This seperates into two wonderful layers, cake on top, pudding on the bottom. My new comfort food! Thanks for sharing this one.

I made all the changes according to an earlier reviewer...with even less sugar (2/3 cup) and even more lemon juice & zest (1 1/2 lemons, 1/4 cup).  It was the BEST lemon dessert I have ever eaten.  YUM!  So utterly delicious and unusual.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!!  This is amazing.  I baked in 5 individual custard cups sprayed with Pam.  Sprinkled with course sugar. I then placed the filled cups in a water bath & baked for 28 or 30 minutes.    Used Way more lemon than the recipe called for & also added some lemon zest.  It is hard to belived that something that only took 10 minutes to get ready to go into the oven could be so awesome.  It is like eating lemon pie.  I will make this again & again.  Am going to try with limes next time.

This was an easy and very tasty desert. Very light.  Wounderful lemon flavor and creamy smooth texture.  If I would of had it out, I would have expected it to take a lot more time to make and be more complicated. Had all ingrediants on hand.  Is good warm or cold.  Thanks SHYPURPLE

Not quite what I had expected- it had a nice tart taste, but I think I put it in too shallow of a dish. It seemed to be done cooking early.

Absolutely superb!  So easy to make, and so delicious.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I took word of advice from first review, and sprinkled raw sugar and some zest on top - spectacular!  Highly recommend this recipe. I did have to cook it for 15 minutes more than stated, but that is likely because of my darned oven!!

I had my doubts when I saw it, it did not look like much. It was a light dessert. I put a dop of cool whip on it. Only served 4, and not large servings.

This did not have the consistency of pudding at all.  More like a flan but the lemon taste was still good.  Overall disappointing.

Excellent! This didn't create a sauce for me but ended up being a cross between a pudding and a souffle. Very light and fluffy with a beautiful lemon flavour. I added some grated lemon zest to the mix and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup. Also made 6 servings instead of 4 which was just enough for 4 people.

I didn't cook it long enough, so don't be afraid to let it get brown. I used almond milk. Worked fine! And was fairly easy to put together.

Even using bottled lemon juice this was really good. I only lightly stirred in the egg whites and they made a light cake top with a warm lemon pudding on the bottom. I will double the recipe from now on because it give more distinct layers in my casserole dish when there was more batter.

I followed the recipe to a T and won't be changing a thing in the future. Wonderfully light cake and a luscious lemon custard underneath !! The lemon isn't overwelming, but just right. We love this pudding. Don't spoil it with any additions - enjoy as is.
My only comment is that for 4 portions you have to scale the recipe to 6

I wasn't very impressed with this. The texture of the two layers is a little odd... The bottom layer reminds me of warm egg yolks with a hint of lemon.

I enjoyed this dessert, but no one else in my family did.  The flavor is great, but the texture turned my kids off, and even my husband.  The flavor reminded me of lemon bars, but the texture was creamy instead.  But it was easy and very tasty.

Very good!! A nice lemony taste. This is definitely a chiffon-type pudding cake. I made it with the modifications listed a couple entries below and was happy with the results. Thanks!

It is less a pudding and more cake or flan. I like my lemon stuff more zingy-tart. I even added lemon zest and I found more sweet than tart. Oh well. It wasn't bad, but not to my taste.

I baked these in individual ramekins and reduced the baking time by five minutes.  I also added a little lemon zest to add a little more lemon flavor.  The dessert was very good but just a little too sweet for my taste.

This was OK. A nice light lemon flavor, it was a little egg-y for us, but we enjoyed it as a change from our usual desserts.

It was okay -- I have to give it points for the availability of recipe ingredients. In terms of taste, it was intensely sweet and tart at the same time. Even my lemon-dessert-loving son only got through half of his portion. I don't think I would make it again, personally, but I certainly wouldn't discourage others from making it. Just not my cup of tea.

This was a delicious white cake with a lemon pudding bottom.  Very easy to make.  A light enjoyable dessert.  Followed the recipe as is (only I doubled it). As another reviewer stated my also was browned on top when it was cooked through.

These proportions are definitively for TWO people and not 4, as you have to try a second piece ! VERY good and light ! Used half of the sugar for a better diet and was still making a yummy dessert (we had it cold). I'm sure too that lemon lovers would prefer 4 instaed of 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.

Perfection! I've made this recipe a number of times since first seeing it a few weeks ago (making it again today)! It is just so light, with just enough sweetness/tartness to create the right balance. The perfect end to a delicious meal!

The picture is horrible and dose not inspire you to want to make this but I did anyways go figure. I made it with fresh squeezed orange juice and added some orange zest as well to it and it came out very good. Made a test run today am making it again tomorrow and serving it hot with plain Greek yogurt on top with a little honey and orange zest mixed in should taste as good as it will look. Will post pic

A little too sweet for me, but better chilled. I would like to try it with a little less sugar, in custard cups with whipped cream, strawberries and a mint leaf on top!

Really good, quick and easy too. I used the juice from a whole large lemon and topped up with some extra from a bottle. Turned out really well.

The cake part on top was nice, sponge-cakey, but the "pudding" on the bottom was soupy and sickeningly sweet.  This is not for me.

The top part was like a sponge cake and it was very good, but the bottom part, the sauce/pudding, was too saucy, like a liquid consistency with lumps. After chilling it, it only thickened up a tiny bit, wasn't like pudding at all. But still tasty. I used the sauce part to pour over a big chunk of the cake part. Good, but strange.

I wouldn't make this again. The lemon was quite subtle. It needs LOTS more lemon juice and/or lemon zest.

Yum!  This recipe didn't look like much when I was making it, so I didn't think it would taste good... but when I tried it, I rather enjoyed it.  Definitely some for lemon lovers to try!

This is delicious! I followed suggestions to reduce the sugar slightly, bump up the lemon juice, add the zest, and sprinkle raw sugar on top. Perfect timing for my small souffle' dish, looks beautiful, and tastes great!

I have a Meyer lemon tree that I love and try to incorporate into recipes as often as possible. The first time I made this, I was thinking it wasn't lemony enough, so I added about a tsp more of juice and tsp of zest, no other changes to the recipe ... it was perfect and delicious! The only advice I would give is to watch it in the oven, because it will become too brown quickly.  I have made it two more times and doubled the recipe, exactly, and added 2 teaspoons zest, and more juice, and came out perfect. My family, friends and husband all love it! Just the way it is written with a little more lemony flavor, and it is the perfect recipe. Thanks to you and your Grandpa for the great recipe!

Very good but next time I will use more milk, probably 1 1/4 cups.  It would be bette with more sauce.

I have made this twice now and I love the taste. I just don't know what I am doing wrong that mine comes out with no pudding on the bottom. I seem to have cake on top and then a layer that is solid on the bottom. I think next time I will cook it until just starting to brown, and see what that does.
