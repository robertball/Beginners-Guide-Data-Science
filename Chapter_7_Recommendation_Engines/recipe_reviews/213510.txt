Made several batches of this for a dinner party tonight, and it's wonderful. My methodology was a little different than the recipe: I seared the steaks on both sides, then finished in the oven to medium. When i removed the steaks from the pan, there was lots of yummy brown fond in the bottom of the pan, which I included in the sauce (if you prepare your steaks and sauce in separate cooking vessels, your sauce will suffer for lack of yummy brown bits!). I didn't cook the steaks in the sauce - used only 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup stock, let it reduce by half, then removed from heat and swirled in 2 tablespoons butter at the end to give the sauce a little extra rich feel; this also allowed me to omit the cornstarch and still have a nice, rich sauce.

Fantastic meal.  No leftovers.  Used green onions instead of shallot.  Rather than corn starch, made a roux with flour and butter and added the shiraz to that.  Perfect mix of tender and crusty.  We'd have happily paid a lot for this in a restaurant.  Can't wait to try again soon.

Hubs prepared the steaks on the grill (to perfection I might add) while I took care of the sauce. I have to admit my first impression was that I was kind of turned off by the sort of purply mushrooms and sauce.  I used a good quality, rich beef stock and an even better Cabernet Sauvignon. Wow, this is really gonna be good, I thought.  I added the cornstarch but found it really wasn't necessary; the sauce reduced nicely on its own.  We sat down to eat and were surprised and disappointed to find the sauce...weak.  I expected full-bodied flavor but it just wasn't there.

Excellent! Except I did not cook the beef in the sauce. I pan seared them and cooked them in the oven. I used the sauce on top of the beef when I served them. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and a spring mix.

This was so yummy! and suprisingly easy too! the only change I made was I used 1 can beef broth instead of just 1/2 cup. It was also very pretty on the plate!

This was a fantastic recipe! My husband and I cooked it together for Valentines Day. We used Pinot Noir for the wine and it turned out perfect. The steak was tender and juicy and full of flavor. Be sure to use thick enough cuts. I wouldn't change a thing when making this recipe.

we only used the mushroom sauce and it was phenomenal. We pan seared the filet then put it in the oven at 500 for 6 minutes for medium rare. Delicious.

My husband & I liked this a lot. I love the idea of a wine sauce with mushrooms. I didn't use the thyme or cornstarch. I used flour to thicken it up. Next time I will use less flour to make it more of a "sauce' than "gravy". Filet Mignon is to good of a meat to cover up with gravy. It was my husband's Valentines Day dinner and we were both pleased with this recipe.

AMAZING! I used about a cup of beef broth instead of a half to make the sauce brown and not purple. I also didn't have cornstarch so I mixed left over beef broth with flour and mixed with sauce. I served over garlic mashed potatoes and sliced the meat ontop of potatoes. It was great!

This was amazing. 1st time I try a recipe I always follow it 100%, then figure out where I want to deviate.  This one needed no change whatsoever.  I would've paid a lot in a restaurant for this and not complained 1 bit.  The color of the sauce didn't look appetizing at first, but as soon as I tasted it I had no more concern.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I, too, made this for Valentine's Day 2010 for my lovey and it was fantastic! When Mark was done with his, he declared my portion that I could not eat "dessert steak" - Yes, it's that good.

I tried this last night for Valentine's Day dinner and kept to the recipe (though I may have added to the 1 cup splash or two of wine!). It was absolutely delicious and both of us were over the moon! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus, washed down with a nice cabernet. Thank you Muffinmom for such a great recipe!

I have a recipe close to this 1 for a filet mignon tenderloin roast.  Great at Christmas.  I also use 1 can of condensed beef broth and 1 cup a good Pinot Noir or Cabernet Sauvignon.  Pan sear the roast in a skillet, finish baking it in the oven.  Great with roasted new potatoes with garlic, italian herb and melted cheddar cheese on top and steamed fresh asparagus.  

For the roast cut a garlic clove in half rub the roast with that and salt, pepper to taste.

The sauce for this recipe is fantastic.  For the filet mignon, I actually cut it up into bite size pieces so that the sauce can cover more meat.  Easier for my kids to eat as well.  Served this with a side of mashed potatoes and steamed carrots and it was a hit.

Used a ruby port since that was already open.  I thought it was decilicous.  It was a tad salty even though i used a low sodium beef broth.  I ended up using canned mushrooms and dry thyme, but it was a wonderfully tasty dinner served with green beans and twice baked potatoes.   The sauce made the recipe.  Definitely a company's coming kind of meal.  Yum.

I followed this recipe exactly and it is outstanding.  The sauce is rich and very flavorful.  I served this with lots of roasted French green beans and a little serving of roasted garlic mashed potatoes. I will definitely make this again! Thanks Muffinmom!

This is a really yummy recipe, but it's not the very best I've ever made, and needed a bit of extra kick on the spices.  I will most likely make this again, though next time I think I will reduce the amount of oil to cook the steaks and cook down the sauce more.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This sauce was the perfect addition to a Sous Vide cooked filet!  I made the sauce according to the directions and served it over the filet after it was cooked. So tasty!

Great recipe!  We really enjoyed the simplicity and delicate flavors.  We followed the instructions exactly and our Filets came out perfectly (medium rare).  I made this with Potatoes Lyonnaise and a roasted White Asparagus dish I put together.  A French Baguette is required to sop up the extra sauce!  Thanks for this great gourmet dish!

Just finished two wonderfully cooked steaks! I cooked mostly to recipe with exception of the thyme, water/starch. I did use all the listed ingredients only used the beef broth instead of water to make the paste. I found that there was much more sauce than we needed (cooked for my wife and I). We had plenty of mushrooms left over. The only complaint my saucier (wife) had was that it needed a little more salt. (I forgot the most important part of tasting before serving...). Overall an eccellent dish and so glad you shared it!! I'm stuffed!

This makes the best gravy EVER. What a compliment to a wonderful piece of beef. A recipe to really impress. A nice dish to follow with really not a whole lot of ingredients and it will come out great.

This was pretty darn good. I think 1 cup of wine was a little too much for my taste. I also used chicken broth bc I didnt have beef-definitely would have been better with the beef. I am going to try this recipe again using less wine and a good quality beef stock.

very good. I love mushrooms with any kind of red meat. This is a simple mushroom sauce that can be used often at my house.

This was very good! I didn't want to spend the money on filet mignon for my family of 5, so used top sirloin. I'm sure filet would have been even better and might try it again with filets someday.

I keep coming back to and love this recipe for it's consistency. I would hate to over cook this expensive meat, so I follow the cooking time for the meat exactly! I pretty much follow the recipe, except I let the sauce reduce much longer for more flavor (until very reduced because it looks like a lot of sauce) and then just add a small pat of butter. Thank you so much - we love it!

I made this sauce for Valentines Day!  Excellent!  I grilled the Filets on the grill first then assembled the dish.

Soooo good! I went by the recipe except just used onion instead of shallot. It was  pretty rare so cook it a little longer if you don’t like rare!

It was Excellent! 
Just make sure to account for the thickness of meat. My steaks were 2 inches thick. I sauteed for 3 minutes per side, then later when adding the back to the simmering sauce, I had to cook for about 10 minutes per side in order to increase the internal temp. up to 130 degrees. By this time the sauce was more of a glaze than a sauce. I added another 1/2 Cup of beef broth which helped thin out the sauce. It was still an excellent dish!

Delicious! I took the suggestion of previous reviews and finished the filet mignon in the oven at 500F for 6 min and it was perfect - melt in your mouth. I didn’t have fresh thyme and so used dry and I’d leave that out next time. Lots of flavour without it. And like a few other reviews, I made this for our Valentine’s dinner and my husband loved it! Served it with twice baked potato and steamed asparagus.

OUT-STANDING dish!! I always make a special dinner for my wife as part of Valentine's Day, steak is her fave and she LOVED it! If you're concerned about the amount of wine, don't... Alcohol evaporated and the sauce sets up nicely with the cornstarch (I used a bit more to thicken the liquid a bit more). Paired it with baked asparagus tossed in olive oil and kosher salt, yum. Adding this to my regular cooking repertoire...

I love this recipe.  I searched everywhere for what my taste buds would consider an appropriate sauce for my tenderloin tips.  This is going to be my 'go to' recipe from now on.  I had Merlot on hand and it worked out as well as Cabernet Sauvignon.  I saved the leftover sauce and put it over the left-over homemade noodles.    Yum!

I used this recipe for my MIL's birthday dinner. My husband grilled the steaks perfectly. I followed the recipe almost exact. Instead of making a slurry, I stirred in about 2 tsp GF all purpose flour to the sautéed mushrooms and shallots and then proceeded to add the wine, broth, and thyme. I don't think the flour or slurry would have been needed as I did find I needed to thin it out a little more so it wouldn't be as thick. My husband hates mushrooms and didn't try it, but my MIL likes mushrooms and said she really liked the sauce with the steak. I tasted the gravy and it had good flavor despite not making the steaks in the pan. If I ever get to make this for myself, I'll omit the flour or slurry component as I think I'd prefer more of a thin sauce instead of a gravy. Overall, good recipe and I'd love to try it again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with a couple of (suggested) modifications. Green onion instead of shallots, and finished in the oven 6 mins at 500. I seasoned the meat 30 minutes ahead, and let it come close to room temp before searing. The sauce (to which I added 2 cloves of garlic) was the show-stopper. I also added some Kitchen Bouquet browning liquid to make the sauce a meatier brown instead of purple. I did not use the cornstarch slurry, but added a pat of butter while finishing. (I also used 1c broth and 1/4c wine). I suggest starting the sauce first if you plan to sear, bake and rest. I will make this again for sure. Hubs now says he needs to step up his game!

I pan seared and oven roasted the filets.  Made the wine sauce as directed.  I would like the mushroom wine sauced to be thicker.  Next time, I’ll cut back on the amount of wine used and simmer a little longer to reduce the sauce.

I've made this twice now, and we LOVE it!!  I buy whole beef tenderloins and this is an excellent recipe to use up those little end pieces that are left after I cut it up into steaks.  The only change I make is that instead of cornstarch, I use a couple of teaspoons of (bulk) beef gravy mix, just to thicken the sauce a little.

I made this for our Valentine's Day dinner and it was delicious!   I used my newly seasoned cast iron skillet and followed the recipe with only one minor change.  Since I already had green onions, I substituted those for the shallots.  I will definitely be making this again!

I will make again.  Very tasty.  However, it took longer to cook in the gravy for med rare, almost twice as long.  One teaspoon of cornstarch not enough to thicken gravy.  I will use more next time.  I also did not use thyme, do not care for it, used tarragon instead.  My husband loved it!

I've made this 3 times.  The best! Good every time. I leave the thyme out - personal preference.  I have used red cooking wine rather than cabernet every time. All else as stated in recipe.

Made this for Valentines Day meal. Excellent choice. My hubby could not rave about this fabulous steak enough. This one is restaurant quality. Not only does it taste phenominal, it looks that way on the plate also. Winner!

I  made this with Venison Chops.  only used a dark red Box wine - I used only 1/2 of the slurry  and I did finish it with a pat of butter.   OMG...   SO DARN GOOD!    This will be made again and again !

So delicious! I was exactly what I was in the mood for tonight. I didn't use the cornstarch. I didn't see any need - the wine/broth reduced down perfectly. At "campagnes" suggestion, I tossed in a little bit of butter at the very end. Good call.

Great but sauce could be a bit thicker, 2 teaspoons of cornflower would be better.

I really liked the recipe. I did not cook the steak in the sauce though to allow my guests to appreciate the filet mignon by itself if they wish to do so. I used shiitake mushrooms instead button mushrooms because I like the texture and flavor more. The sauce just wasn't rich enough for me so I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, salt, and two tablespoons of butter instead of cornstarch (thank you Campagnes for the suggestion). The sauce became amazing and stole the show from the filet!

Whoa! This is great. I added a little garlic, just because I love garlic. I also used Merlot because that is what I had. I let the Merlot reduce down a couple of times. Ended up using about half a bottle when it was all finished. Talk about intense flavor. The next day, I have it waiting for lunch and can not wait. Thinking about when I will make it again and how to add to it.

It was wonderful although I used 1.5 inch thick filets and as I live in south Louisiana I used a roux instead of corn starch as a thickener. One other change was the steak prep. I seasoned the steaks with sea salt and crushed black pepper then let them rest in the fridge for two hours prior to cooking. This allows a chemical reaction to take place within the steak.

This was only the 2nd time I ate filet mignon. The only changes I made were onions instead of shallot and pinot noir instead of cabernet but only because I didn't have the others. I cooked two steaks but they were a total of 1.5 lbs so I adjusted the rest of the ingredients. We split it 3 ways and I would definitely cook this again. It was awesome. Even my picky husband raved about it. Good Job.

This sounds good but I can't imagine 4 ounces of meat per person. It says two 8 ounce steaks,
