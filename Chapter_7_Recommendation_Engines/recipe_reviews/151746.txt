I use semi or milk chocolate as my base coat then top it with the white chocolate followed bt the crushed peppermint. It takes a little longer to di it this way because you will have to wait until the first layer of the chocolate is cooled. But it is well worth the wait.

I was going to make some of this and give it as gifts.  I tried one reviewer's suggestion of making a semi-sweet chocolate layer first and when that had cooled I added a layer of white chocolate on top along with the crushed peppermint.  'Don't know why, but when I went to cut the candy into pieces, the white layer separated from the dark layer, and most of the crushed candy pieces on top just fell off!  They had not stuck to the chocolate, even though I'd used a piece of waxed paper to supposedly press them into the white chocolate layer after I'd sprinkled them on.  The stuff tastes good, but I couldn't give it as gifts with the way it all came apart.  I think if I make this again I will just make one layer and stir all the crushed candy into the melted morsels so there's no chance of pepermint "fallout!"

I made this last year as a last min. easy treat to add to my cookie dish that we give to family and friends.  They all loved it.  Everyone is already asking for it this year too.  I did use white choc. and added 1/8 teaspoon of peppermint extract and it turned out great.

Don't you hate those reviews that change everything?  Well, here's another!  I did this with white chocolate in a double boiler.  Quick, easy, and a great candy for people who don't like real chocolate.  Got rave reviews.

This is so, so easy and a good recipe to get kids involved.  My 8 year old son unwrapped all the peppermint and chocolate squares, and then used a rolling pin to smash the candies (which were safely inside a ziploc baggie).  The way I did it was to remove all the bigger pieces of candy and set aside.  Then I melted the chocolate in a bowl and then stirred the candy "dust" in and spread that on a cookie sheet.  I sprinkled all those larger pieces reserved earlier on top.  This is a FAST, EASY recipe to take to work or give as gifts and it's super-yummy too!

This was very good and easy to make.  I used white chocolate instead of the dark.  I also had leftover candy canes so I just crushed up those instead.  Very simple to do and the red and white candy looked great in the white chocolate.  This was perfect for us - but if you like a stronger peppermint taste, add a little peppermint extract to the melted chocolate.

This was a great recipe.  I made it with both white and semi sweet chocolate.   According to my daughter this is to "die for".     Very simple recipe that made a nice addition to our baked good baskets.

I used dark chocolate and crushed candy canes and arranged the pieces around the edge of a cake like a fence. Dark chocolate and peppermint go well together and the bark can be used in many decorative ways.

I give this out at for Christmas presents.  Everyone loves it.  It is so easy to make, and it is inexpensive too, depending on what kind of chocolate you use.  Sometimes I ad some peppermint extract to the melted chocolate.  Easy and good!

Simple and delicious. I love that this recipe is yummy, and that I have the time to make it during the mad-dash holiday prep. 

I added a bit of white chocolate swirl in with the semi-sweet, and enjoyed the flavor contrast along with the marble look. 

I'll be making these every Christmas!

This was great, it doesn't get much easier. I just mixed the peppermint in with the chocolate, it didn't turn out as pretty but it still tastes good! It's a fun activity to do with kids.

YUM!  I made a double recipe and combined milk and dark chocolate... it came out great!  Crushing the peppermints was messy and annoying, but worth it!

This recipe came out tasting great...on the second batch. Maybe other people's microwaves are different than mine, but setting it on HIGH burned the chocolate within the first minute. I think the squares were also too big to melt evenly. It was so bad I had to scrap the entire first batch.  Next batch I chopped the chocolate into little pieces and microwaved on 50% power for 1 minute...stirred and microwaved for 30secs (still on 50%) over and over until it was evenly melted.  Good luck!

So easy, and so delicious!  Used semi-sweet chocolate, crushed candy canes, and white chocolate for the top.  Used a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper.  If you need a quick Christmas gift and are sick of baking, this is perfect!
