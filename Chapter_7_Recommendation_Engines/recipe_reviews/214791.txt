Even though I'm German, I don't recognize this recipe but I have to say it is simple, delicious and filling. I half the recipe and bake in a small cast iron skillet right in the oven. Delicious as is or served with a light drizzle of syrup.  I have also made this, sans the vanilla and cinnamon, as a vegetable pancake with sautéed mushrooms and onions.  This makes much more than one serving LOL!

Egg-cellent and super easy to make.  It's going to disappoint if you're expecting anything like an American-style pancake.  The eggs give it an entirely different texture.  We had ours with some homemade mulberry syrup (with whole mulberries) mixed with regular maple syrup and with a dollop of sour cream.  Amazingly decadent!

I was so excited to find this recipe, I made it for my husband for fathers day and he LOVED it, the only thing he said was that it was a litte thicker than he would have liked, I think next time we will find a different pan, we used a pie pan and it was a bit thick. My girls did love to see it puff up and warming the eggs and milkl first really do make a difference.

Excellent addition to any breakfast.  Easy to make and has an excellent texture.  I made mine with whole wheat flour, and only four whole eggs and some egg whites due to a pantry shortage this morning, but it was still great!  I served with some egg whites, cooked apples with cinnamon, and agave nectar.  Nice breakfast made with things that you usually have in the pantry.

This was a huge hit with my three kids. They polished it off in no time. I used 1TB butter instead of two for a bit less fat, and a 9x13 pan because I don't have a smaller one. I baked it for 20 minutes and it was PERFECT. Thanks for the recipe!

I was surprised in a very good way by these! I've neither made nor had baked pancakes before so I didn't know what to expect, and these definitely have me impressed. I halved the recipe for my boyfriend and I and made it in a smaller pan, so they may have been thicker than usual, but I liked them that way. Reminded me of French toast, but chewier. We both decided that these would taste great done in little yorkie pans (or muffin pans) to make them individual and then stuff them with bacon or sausage. As it was this morning, we topped ours with honey, peanut butter, and bananas (not all at once though). I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the whole thing as soon as it came out of the oven, and that turned out to be a great addition. Looking forward to experimenting with this recipe!

This did not taste anything like a pancake. I should have figured that out, however, as the recipe calls for 6 eggs and only one cup of flour. It tasted more eggy than anything else. Overall it didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like a pancake.

Tasty but seemed like it was missing something. Also, mine took just over 30 minutes to cook fully.

I just made this today. I added 1 tsp of ground ginger and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp also. I used Plain Soy milk also and whipped the whole thing using an electric beater.  The flavor was excellent and I'll definitely make again! We used vanilla yogurt and sliced bananas on it (my twin 8 year old girls loved it). It's definitely a winner!!

I made this for breakfast this morning thinking we would have a ton of leftovers but it was so good that we ate it all.  Next time I will use a slightly smaller pan to try for a thicker pancake.  We ate ours with powdered sugar and syrup.  The taste reminds me of french toast, but the texture throughout the pancake is fluffy and egg-y.  I only had 5 eggs left in my fridge and that still turned out delicious.

I halved the recipe.  My review may not be fair, because the only thing I measured was the flour and eggs and cooked for 15 minutes.

It wasn't good. Bland and gross texture. Too much flour taste. Maple syrup was able to mask the badness but I still choked down a few bites. My 8-yr old son said "No flavor" after two bites.

This recipe needs something but I'm no chef.

This is not like a traditional pancake.  It came out smooth and creamy almost like a custard.  We absolutely loved it!  I served it to my family with fresh fruit and whipped cream.  It's going on my holiday brunch list!

Great, easy recipe. I like to add some fresh blueberries to the batter before baking and then top with some lemon juice and powdered sugar before eating to sweeten it up a bit. Yum!

Since I was eager to try the recipe, but didn't need to cook for 6, I decided to scale it down to the following:   2 eggs, 1/3 cup flour, pinch salt, sprinkle of cinnamon, 1/3 cup milk, 1 1/2 tsp Smart Balance (instead of butter) in a small cast iron skillet in my large toaster oven.  I left out the vanilla. Results were great.  I loved seeing the pancake puff up and toast.   I ate it with a little sorghum syrup.   Thanks for the recipe.

I can't imagine anyone down-rating this recipe.  It's fool-proof and the best thing is it has no sugar except what you put on top.  I divide the default quantity between two 10-inch cast iron skillets, and it serves 4-6 people.  Preheat the skillets with the butter in the oven while you mix the rest.  Traditionally served with a sprinkling of lemon juice and powdered sugar, or you can make a fancy dessert by ladling on any kind of fresh fruit or fruit pie filling.  It could be a dinner or brunch dish, too, if you serve it with veggies and mushrooms or creamed chicken or beef or even fish. You won't be sorry you tried this!

you can also get some fresh apples, peel, core and slice and cook them in butter till tender. Then place the apples first then batter on top in a cast iron skillet and bake. Very good. Thank you for sharing recipe.

These were ok.  I felt like the batter was missing something.  By themselves they taste a little bland but with butter and syrup they were good.  My husband liked the texture and we'll definitely try again with a few tweaks.  :)

This is the first time I've baked a pancake. It was very thick and tasteless. It tasted like baked dough but without flavor until you put on the butter and syrup. We did not enjoy it enough to bake it again. However, I must say that this method sure beats standing in front of the griddle for an hour making pancakes for a family of seven!

FANTASTIC!  I switched a fresh ground multi-grain flour for the white flour.  Also, I only had 5 eggs, so I used powdered egg.  Last time I made it, I even used powdered milk!  This is great recipe to use up my collection of different grains in my food storage.

My mom used to make German Pancakes for dinner all the time. I decided to make it tonight and found this recipe. It was so easy and it turned out perfect! Even my picky eaters liked it.  Thank you so much for giving me back an old favorite!

These tasted good but mine came out pretty dense in the middle.  It puffed up around the sides and the middle felt dry when I pressed it (I also baked it for the amount of time the recipe said) but I thought it'd turn out more cake-like like a pancake.

I made this for the first time during breakfast this morning, and I thought it was pretty decent. It does have a real eggy texture and flavor though, which was fine but I think adding more cinnamon and mixing the batter more next time will make it a winner for me. I served mine with no syrup, just a spread of raspberry jam with confectioners sugar sprinkled on top. Overall it reminded me of French toast, and I will definitely be experimenting with this recipe more.

My fussy, picky, yet adorable grand daughters loved this pancake.  I've made it three times in less than two weeks.  I'm sure I'll be making it quite often.  Thank you for a healthy, easy and filling recipe.

I followed the recipe as written. It tasted nothing like a traditional German pancake and was very dense. No one in my family cared for it.

This is the same recipe as my German grandmother's (except with half the butter, which I do anyway)!  We up the recipe by 1.5 and stick everything in the blender for extra fluff!

Made this last night for a light supper and it was wonderful. I had originally planned to serve it with fried Granny Smith apples but at last minute added smoked sasage and red sweet peppers to the apple mix plus a tablespoon of brown sugar. Forget leftovers....we ate it all.

I love this recipe, however I don't add salt and I use 5 tablespoons of butter instead.  It is nice served with powdered sugar and a splash of lemon juice.

My mom has a recipe for german pancakes, and hers is very similar in that it has the same measurements of  egg, flour and milk. Her recipe has a lot more butter and no vanilla or cinnamon.  This recipe tasted very good. However, it didn't have any more "puff" than my mothers recipe.  We like to put jelly and powdered sugar on my mothers german pancakes, but this recipe tastes fine with just  sugar on top.

I have been making this for years. It’s my grandmothers recipe. Huge tip leave cinnamon out and whisk all  ingredients ingredients the entire time butter is Browning open oven pull out rack the dishes on pour in your batter push rack back in gently turn the oven light on and stay out of the kitchen to prevent it from flopping. ONLY USE whole milk

I make this recipe all the time but with some additions that my family LOVES!
1 - I increase the eggs to 8 just to make it stick to the ribs a little more.
2 - I line the bottom completely with thinly sliced apple (1/2cm at peel side) before pouring the batter over top.  The apples then float to the top a little and even more while baking.
3 - We eat this with plain yogurt and real maple syrup which is such a nice contrast.
4 - As one of the other reviews mentioned, this takes my oven quite a bit more than 20-25 minutes to bake.

I've made this many times, as written, and it's always a favorite. 5 stars, as is.

Today, I  had already cracked the eggs and mixed the wet ingredients when I discovered I was out of flour. I substituted 1c old fashioned oats. Try it, it's just as delicious, the kids were still happy, and it's probably more filling.

It was good. Not as fluffy as i expected more heavy. I tasted like a thick crepe. I used half and half cuz i was out of milk. I also made apple cinnamon syrup with reg. Syrup and cut up fresh apples and sprinkles some cinnamon in. Simmered on low and served on top. Easier and Better than pancakes for sure.

Used this as a base recipe. I live alone so halved all the ingredients except the cinnamon, which I doubled(would have used 3 tsp with the full recipe) and 1/4 tsp nutmeg ( 1/2 tsp for full recipe) and topped with apple slices.  When halved the baking time drops to about 15 minutes, so keep an eye on it.

This is definitely not light and airy as a regular pancake. That said they are delicious and eggy. I used a bit more butter in the baking dish, added a teaspoon of sugar and a bit of nutmeg with the cinnamon,  then after I poured the batter in the baking dish topped it with 2 teaspoons of sugar and slivered almonds. Be sure to cook it long enough - the edges should rise up and even curl, but the center needs to be fully cooked. Yummy!

Very good! A family favourite! It's so easy to make and it tastes amazing with some powdered sugar or syrup. It sinks when it comes out of the oven, but it's not undercooked. Definitely will make this again. And again. :)

This is a good recipe although it turned out a little more dense than I expected. Maybe a little more flour and one less egg or take out the yolks.
