Woooo hooo!  Finally, a base recipe which allowed me to make the catfish I've always wanted!  The cayenne dry marinade was fabulous, and cutting the fillets while frozen made for skinny and ultimately crispy finished "fries."  I coated in a mixture of fine organic cornmeal, fine flour, seasoned salt, granulated garlic, onion powder, and a little more cayenne for extra kick.  Crunchy, delicious, and very addictive, even for my toddler grandson.  Frying catfish may not be "rocket science" (to quote a previous reviewer,) but if it were?  This recipe made it into orbit for me!  Thanks for posting!

This was good but thought could use more seasonings so after frying one for taste I added some garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoning salt to the corn flour.  Do think I will continue to use my mixture of cornmeal with a bit of flour.

My yankee super market didn't have any corn flour so I substituted fine corn meal. But they did have fresh farm-raised catfish fillets. I served it as a sandwich on toasted hard rolls slathered with creole tarter sauce. With cole slaw on the side it made a great dinner.

I was not a fan of catfish in the States, and I've never seen it here in Australia...so I tried it with a salmon fillet I had in the freezer...WOW is all I can say...this is amazingly tasty for the few ingredients it uses!  Once you are done with frying the fish - deep fry your fries. The oil (now flavored with the cayenne) makes them tastier too.

With only three ingredients to embelish the fish, it's difficult to award stars, or think of it as a recipe.  It is, however, very good.  To people who can't find corn flour in the store, grind cornmeal (white or yellow) in your food processor or blender until it's the consistency of flour.

Mmmm.  Although 1tsp cayenne really wasn't that spicy.  Next time: MORE.  No corn flour, so used corn meal.  Nice, crunchy texture.  I just used the nuggets I had and sliced them in half.  We enjoyed!

Absolutely delicious. I added a bit of salt to the actual fish itself as well as some onion powder. This is now my default fried fish recipe.

Mine took about 20 minutes to cook through prior to that each test piece was still raw in the middle. Followed the instructions exactly and it was good. The next time I added seasoned pepper to the corn flour mix.

A great recipe if you're trying to cook for a gluten-free diner. Yum! Just make sure you use clean (uncontaminated by wheat flour) oil, and you'll be golden.

Great, simple and delicious. I also used a bit more cayenne the 2nd time around. Along with mixing cornmeal with flour- I added season salt, garlic powder & pinch of pepper. It's a great base recipe- I say tweak it how you like and go from there, afterall- nobody knows your families 'taste' better than you!

My husband and kids love this fish! I still do the cayenne pepper part, but instead of the corn flour, I used Zatarain's seasoned fish-fri. I thought the cayenne might make it too spicy for the kids, but it didn't. It was quick, easy, and delicious. I have made it at least 4 times since finding this recipe.

Had to use corn meal, couldn't find corn flour. Added a T of seasoned salt to the mix. These made excellent catfish po'boys on toasted french rolls topped with shredded cabbage, carrots, and spicey tartar sauce.

I don't do spicy foods so I substituted the ceyenne with smoked paprika. Instead of fries I made nuggets. I also sprinkled the nuggets with garlic powder once they came out of the oil. But the overall finished product was very yummy.

I've fried catfish for decades and also come to allrecipes all the time to try dishes and rarely give a review, but late this evening I tried this for a snack, not deviating too much from similar methods.  Since I didn't have corn flour on hand I quickly googled it and found I could make it myself by milling corn meal in the Vitamix.  So I did.  Only after cooking the recipe did I realize that instead of using the teaspoon or so of paprika, I had grabbed red pepper instead.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Gosh, this is an outstanding way to fry up catfish.  I actually like the red pepper but next time I'll probably use half paprika and half red pepper to tone down the heat.  Thanks so much for, yes, a simple recipe but with a unique and delicious twist.

I've been cooking catfish pretty much this way for 30 years; however, I dry "marinate" also with salt and pepper as well as the cayenne and cut my strips thicker.  This breading method works well for frying chicken, but using wheat flour instead of corn meal or corn flour.

We used corn meal rather than corn flour, and added some salt.  Everyone loved this catfish and it was wonderfully crispy.  The best cornmeal catfish we've had.

I'm surprised at how great this fish turned out!  I used a LOT of cayenne and put some cajun seasoning in the Maseca Masa I used for the corn flour.  My only recomendation is they need plenty of salt.  Salt the flour and salt them when they come out of the hot grease.  I also fried up some corn fritters, might as well while the grease is hot, right!

I was looking for a way to use up corn flour.  I love this recipe.  No need to buy fish fry if you have corn flour.  I let it cook until it gets nice and crispy. I also like to add a little thyme in with the cayenne. Thanks for the recipe.

After adding garlic and onion pwr to the flour you should be ready to go.  Masa flour can be found in most supermarkets in the Mexican food section.  The second time I made I used some Creole Seasoning to the Masa.

Used 3/4 C corn meal & 1/4 C flour with 2 t creole seasoning, 1/4 t garlic salt, dry marinated with cayenne, and wah-lah!  Very crunchy and salty enough for me.  I also deep fried my french fries in the oil afterwards.  So good.  Finished the meal with watermellon (something healthy to counteract all the deep fried stuff!).

So good. A few additions added to the corn meal for more flavor, but this is a winner in my home.

This recipe is for when I need my spicy needs filled.  It's not nearly as spicy as you might think when you read this recipe,and if you cook your fish first and then toss in some tater tots you will have some of the best tots ever!  Like many others I used fine ground corn meal.

When frying make sure your oil is really hot, of course you can add more seasoning to your taste, enjoy, my family loved them!

Super easy, very tasty. Added Old Bay to the corn meal/flour mixture I substituted for corn flour. Will definitely make again. These were a hit. Thanks for sharing!

Took me right back to New Orleans the first time I made it. It is now the only catfish recipe I use.

Corn flour can be found in your local grocery store under the name Masa or Maseca or in Hispanic grocery stores. I also seasoned the flour with coarse salt, pepper, coarse garlic powder and paprika. I didn't use a deep fryer so I use plenty of canola oil and just turned it once. I put the frozen pieces in a zip lock bag and added the flour and season to the bag. Tossed it around and fried it. Turning it once. Set it on paper towel to drain out some of the oil. The entire process took 20mins.
