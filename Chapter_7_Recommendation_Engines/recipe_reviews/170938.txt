I wouldn't call this a taco sauce sorry, and there needs to be more seasoning in the mixture & waaaay less oil.

This tasted strange with tacos.  Tasted great as a dressing on a salad of lettuce, green peppers, olives, onion, black beans, and corn that went WITH the tacos though. In fact I will actually save this recipe just for that.

thank you VERY much for this! KEVINLEE91 is from West Memphis, AR, so I'm hoping that this is a recipe for the taco sauce at Pancho's Tacos in the Memphis/West Memphis area. I grew up eating these tacos and have never had their equal. Plan on making a batch of this and keeping it in the fridge. Will add it to the bland, flavorless tacos I sometimes have to get from Taco Hell. KEVINLEE91, you've made my day!

I used this recipe, with a couple alterations, as the sauce on a taco pizza and it turned out great!  I doubled the recipe since it makes such a small batch, but I kept the amount of oil the same since it seemed like too much to me.  I actually used 1/4 c olive oil and 1/4 c canola oil so the olive oil flavor wasn't so overpowering. I added one tsp of chili powder and about 2 Tblsp of ketchup to thicken it up and balance out the flavor a little bit.  It turned out great!  Now it's a keeper!

Used this for a fajita pizza, but If I was making tacos I would have been very disappointed. It was not like traditional taco sauce. Great for a pizza tough, just brush the dough with it and sprinkle a bit over the toppings.

This has a good flavor and would taste fine on tacos, I think.  Since I was using this as an ingredient for another recipe (Chicken Ole from this site), I added a few squirts of ketchup to give it the tomato flavor I would normally expect.  (However, I did try the sauce without it and thought it was good without the ketchup too.)  Additionally, I followed the advice of other reviewers to double the spice amounts and use 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup canola oil instead of just the olive oil.  Next time I may add a few dashes of chili powder and paprika if I want a more traditional "taco sauce" flavor.

oh my gosh, thank you soooo much. I love Pancho's taco sauce and I hate buying it in the store because it is costly compared to the amount we like to use. I'm going to try it tonight!!

It took some adjusting.  We like some spices more than others.  But this recipe works great in a pinch.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I cut the oil in half and added some fresh lime juice, and then it was perfect.  We use this on chicken taco bowls, and it makes it taste like a restaurant.  Thanks!

There is too much oil, so I ended up using it as a salad dressing. Even then, it wasn't all that tasty.

This made for some amazingly flavorful ground beef! I cooked the beef and then let it simmer in this sauce, and my entire family loved it (even the picky 3 and 5 year old)! I doubled everything except the oil as suggested by another reviewer. It was perfect with one pound of ground beef.

I liked it.  Helped me out in a pinch as I had no sauce or salsa.  Did seem a bit too oily as I spooned it on, but it tasted great and I will make it again.  Oh also we were out of Cheyenne so I used  Cajun seasoning.  Gonna put it in a squeeze bottle and label, shake well. :)
