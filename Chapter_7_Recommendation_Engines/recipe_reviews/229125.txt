Made it last night. It. Is. Not. A lo-cal delishishness! It was terrific, but boy do I have regrets today! My taste buds deserve a break from no-carbs, no-fat, no-salt, no taste foods 4x a year! Thanks nymbus.

I make this around the holidays. A restaurant I go to makes this in New York and the chef gave me the recipe 3 years ago. Everyone loves it.

I made it to season my turkey this year (between skin and breast meat and rub, as shown in turkey prep video).  Added flavor and moisture, not to mention a beautifully browned bird.  Did not have "fresh" ingredient on hand, so used dried spices and lemon juice.  Still quite tasty!  Should add link to turkey recipes...

I loved the lemon touch this added to my fish and steamed veggies. I wrapped it in plastic wrap like a cigar and froze it for about an hour so I could slice off the amount I wanted. I still have plenty for future meals.

Really delicious combination! I tried to do by hand but the lemon juice really does not mix well with the butter that way. Ended up throwing it all in my stand mixer and whipping it. Turned out perfect!

Had fresh rosemary, thyme and sage to use up so I made this. Love it! Would be nice with orange zest, too.  I think I'll keep some of this on hand at all times!
