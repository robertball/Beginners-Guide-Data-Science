This is a very buttery French bread. Made plain it's not that good, it needs to go with something.

Amazing!!! Made this by hand... easy but time consuming. Will definitely start first thing in the morning next time lol. Mine came out perfectly golden brown, slightly crispy on the outside, moist inside. Delicious with blueberry preserves!

This was an outstanding bread.  It was soft and buttery, with a just-shy-of-firm crust.  I substituted bread flour to get a firmer dough.  I kneaded it with a stand mixer equipped with a dough hook, which took most of the work out of it, and also resulted in a nicely spongy, tight crumb.

This is really good. I was sure I messed up somewhere when I did the butter part but it came out really yummy. I used this to make Gil's Brioche French toast (AR). Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.

A great recipe with excellent end results.

I did this by hand and it went fine but will definitely use a bread dough hook with my mixer next time!

I used Gil's French Toast with the brioche the next day.

Like a couple of the other reviewers, I thought I'd done something wrong when I got to the butter addition. The dough broke apart and didn't incorporate the butter as easily as I wanted it to but I got it done. I have not baked this bread recipe as is, instead I used the dough to make cinnamon rolls. They were the best I've ever had! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made three batches, one was plain, one with choco chips and one with fruit jam as topping. All were perfect. Had little trouble with making exact brioche shape, so we made a little dent on top to fill in the toppings. Served it with home made lemon jelly, everybody loved it.

This recipe is very forgiving due to the high butter content. The final product is bland, especially if you use unsalted butter. Increasing the amount for water will produce a slightly lighter loaf. Not as good as Challah.

Perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  Having never made a brioche I followed the recipe exactly.  Adding the cup of butter was disconcerting but I persevered and the result was outstanding.

Used a Kitchen Aid so I skipped the 6 hours-overnight chilling. Never had brioche so I am relying on my sister's opinion that it was good. For those who may not know, like me, divided into 2 loaves is equivalent to making cornbread height (2-3"). I actually needed this for a French toast recipe so next time I'll try just 1 loaf. As for taste, it had a nice crumbly exterior and a dry flaky texture inside. It's perfect for French toast if left out overnight to dry.

I bake a lot but not bread as rule.  This recipe was so good.  The dough was a dream to work with and the bread and sticky buns I made were wonderful.  I'll definitly make it again.

It was a little more dense and a little less fluffy than brioche I've had before. The flavor was very nice, the crust was perfect. I might should have let it warm up longer after taking it out of the fridge, that's why I'm giving it four stars instead of three out of benefit of the doubt.

The recipe is fantastic.  My mistakes were I refrigerated the dough 2x which I think killed the yeast, and I added about twice as much butter as the recipe called for.  Other than that, it's a well-written recipe.  Also, I haven't baked anything in about 20 years.  I'm quite certain that factored into things as well.

This was so tasty! Best with jam or butter on it, but isn't too bad just plain I did a braided loaf and it turned out so pretty and yummy! Was a but worried when I added the butter, but just keep kneading! Definitely will make this again soon! :)

This bread did not taste good, at all! Threw it away because nobody would eat it. I’ve had plenty of experience making bread and followed the recipe exactly, it just did not taste good. Checked all my ingredients and nothing was expired, don’t see how this recipe has such good reviews. If the bread doesn’t taste good on it’s own, it’s a flop in my opinion.

It was a great recipe. I had to change the active dry yeast to instant yeast since I did not have any active dry yeast at home. I am so happy with the products turned out really nicely.

This recipe works perfectly. I used bread flour and refrigerated it overnight. In the morning the dough was firm and easy to work with. I made brioche a tete, and it yield 10 beautiful brioches. I added nuts and jam 'under the tetes' of a couple of them before baking, for myself - and the rest I kept plain for my family to add whatever they wanted to when eating.
They baked to perfection in 12 mins...In the future I plan to use this dough recipe for meat wrapping.

Pretty sure I heard my stand mixer laughing at me as I tried to incorporate the butter...  :-) So here's what happened - I followed the directions in the Editor's Note for making in a stand mixer.  I mixed the dough, minus the butter, for 10 minutes on low using the dough hook.  Perhaps that was too long? It was pretty solidly formed by then.  When I added the butter a tbsp at a time as directed, the butter stayed on the outside of the dough, and the dough hook began just sliding around on the surface of the dough, pushing it to the outside and bottom of the bowl.  I stopped the mixer several times and attempted to reshape the dough around the hook. Nope. I took it out and kneaded it a bit and then put it back in. No luck. I adjusted the height of the hook to make sure it wasn't too high.  No go. I had a hunk of dough covered with slimy butter on the outside, and nothing, it seemed, was going to change that.  I had only added about 3 tbsp of the butter before I gave up using the mixer.  Determined to salvage my bread, I went back to the manual instructions and kneaded the butter in by hand.  I did eventually incorporate the butter into the dough, but gosh, it sure put up a fight!  I made the rolls.  They were soft and buttery, but not flaky.  I will try making this again (we did enjoy the taste) but by hand next time!  I'm not very experienced with making bread, so if someone knows what I did wrong maybe they can post a message.

This recipe is actually really simple. I made two loaves. The part that made me most iffy was kneading the soft butter into the dough. It was really slimy, and this being my first time making brioche, I worried that I was doing something wrong, but it came out fine! In fear of having plain bread as mentioned in other reviews, I added about 1/4 cup more of butter, and the bread is definitely delicious by itself. The bread is really soft on the inside with a slight crunchy exterior. I'll use it for French toast as well as eat it by itself or with butter. I'll make this again!

I made this with my Kitchen Aid and it came out looking great.  It tasted just okay.  I think it's just the type of bread though (I've never had brioche before this).  I used it to make French toast which was also just okay.  By itself or with butter it's boring, as another reviewer mentioned.  It might be good with some homemade jam.

Well, that was a disaster. On the last step, the dough wouldn’t proof. Finally I put the rolls in the oven, and they barely rose. I let the loaf of bread proof a little longer and got some volume before putting it in, and it didn’t rise in the oven AT ALL. The bread is way too dense. Also, the flavor isn’t anything approaching brioche. I’d give it one star, but the results are at least edible, so we don’t have to throw the whole thing out.

This is a great bread but not anywhere near the Panera Brioche that I was looking for. This recipe needs milk, more butter, and salt (sugar). It lacks the sweet  and saltiness of the big brand of Panera. 

However this is a lite and fluffy recipe with and beautiful shiny outside, but more similar to regular bread.

A few quick questions:

1. If you do not use a blender to mix the flour mix w/ the eggs and the yeast mix, what is the best hand method to mix the dough? 

2. Can you handle the dough too much and kill the yeast?

3. Should you use room temp eggs?

4. What happens if you use warm almond milk v. warm water?

5. When you flatten the dough and spread the butter, how thin should you flatten the dough and how many turns  should you kneed the dough?

6. Do you need to preheat the oven for 60min while you wait for the dough to rise after it's pulled from the fridge, split and placed in the pans?

It worked well! I wasn't sure I was doing it right at first, since I've never kneaded butter into dough before! This was my first attempt at brioche, and I think the recipe was easy enough! I had to look up how to knead brioche dough by hand though. I will make it again!

I used this recipe to make Hot Cross Buns for Easter. Followed the recipe to the end but with half the eggs and butter (which I subbed for margarine). I added candied peel, sultanas and cinnamon to the dough at the last stage and divided into buns. Let them prove for another 30 minutes and then baked them. They turned out great!

The recipe worked, but the bread was crusty and crumbly like a biscuit, and was not sweet like the brioche I've bought before.

Really bland and a texture more like a biscuit than a bread. The directions were really clear and good.

Love this recipe.  Works great in a stand mixer.  I had to add a little extra flour but it turned out great and it's easy to shape.  I made knots out of this recipe and added garlic and herbs.  Definitely a keeper.

This dough was a royal pain to work with but it sure was worth it!  It is very rich and flaky. Brioche is perfect for french toast, especially when it's day and old.  When incorporating the butter, don't panic, just keep on mixing and you'll be rewarded with a beautiful loaf of authentic brioche.

This sure took a long time, but if you want to make from the scratch french toast, then this is the perfect recipe.  I topped it with strawberry-rhubarb syrup I made and topped with cool-whip.

I must have messed up somewhere, or simply didn't bake long enough. After 25 min it was still raw inside. Back in oven 10 more min.  That did it. But I did not get the fluted loaf you get in a Brioche pan; I also didn't make 2 loaves, so there's that. But it's very good. Will try it again.

Turned out well, a little bit bland, but good overall.
