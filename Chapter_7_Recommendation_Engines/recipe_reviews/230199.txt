Found this recipe last year.  Double the rhubarb for sure!! I used maple syrup instead of sugar for the sauce (and also added an ounce or 2 of a liqueur I had handy). I substituted whole plain yogurt for the buttermilk. Substituted cream for the evaporated milk. I use coconut sugar for the cake portion . Also added some cinnamon to both the cake and sauce. HIGHLY recommend. The first time I made this my girlfriend who does not eat desserts tasted a bit out of politeness and ate 2 helpings!

Fabulous!  Based on other reviews that suggested adding more rhubarb, and having fresh blueberries needing a home...  I added a cup of the blueberries and this cake is awesome.  It took an extra 15 minutes to cook (50 minutes total), but oh so worth it.  I haven’t even made the sauce; this “bluebarb” cake is delicious without it!

Made this tonight for Mother's Day and it came together beautifully, smelled great while baking, and came out of the pan without a hitch!  Can't wait to taste it but will have to as the event is tomorrow.  (I did "quality-check" the batter and YUM!)  So far I'd give this a very high score!

Wonderful? Everyone young and old loved it. I would make double next time. We had extra caramel sauce which I saved for another use.

Great recipe. I added a bit more rhubarb, making no other changes. I did not serve with the sauce and it was great the way it was. It's a great cake base and freezes well too.

Might increase the rhubarb and did not use the caramel sauce as it was just right without

I was looking for something a little different to use my rhubarb from the garden.  This was very good, but a little sweeter than I would have liked.  Next time I would add more rhubarb to offset the sweetness.  The texture was perfect though.
