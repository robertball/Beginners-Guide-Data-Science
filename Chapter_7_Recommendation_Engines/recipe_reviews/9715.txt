These were the worst bars I've ever attempted to make.  I made them once, and they turned out horrible.  After the instructed cooking time, they were completely raw, so I cooked for *double* the time.  They were still undercooked, and then they turned rock solid over night, and we threw the rest away.  I made a second batch the next night, thinking I had mis-read the directions, and they turned out even worse.  The butter content seemed way too high, and it amounted to a gross mess that I wouldn't dare eat.  It was such a disappointment because this recipe was to be a highlight of my husband's birthday weekend.  He ate some of both batches with reservations, not eating 75% of them.  Unless I mis-read the instructions incorrectly twice in a row, this recipe is seriously inaccurate.  Would not recommend.

These were delicious right out of the oven, but after a few days they develop a hard and crumbly crust, and the inside gets stale, even if stored in a tin. But the night they were baked, they were TO DIE FOR!!!!!

Disappointed - not chewy, more cake-like.  I did double recipe so maybe that was problem?  I did not overbake, took them out at 25 min. and golden.  Maybe they should be a little underbaked?  I am still looking for a moist, chewy, bar cookie with macadamia nuts and chocolate.

if i could give this recipe zero stars, i would - i concur w/ the other individual who said the butter content was WAY too high.  i baked them for 15 minutes longer than recommended and they were still drastically overcooked.  i actually put the cooked dough into a bowl after i realized there weren't cooked enough to serve.  tried making dough balls out of them and i could actually ring the butter out of the cooked dough.
