I recommend letting the beef sit in the marinade at least 4 hours. Not only does the flavor have time to penetrate but it makes the beef all the more tender. The vinegar/sugar blend is absolutely perfect for the onions but again, I recommend letting the onions sit in it at least an hour instead of only 10 minutes AND, half of an onion was plenty. My one and only complaint is that the watercress is a little overpowering with all of its bitter radish-y flavor. Next time I will use half watercress and half baby spinach. Overall great recipe and one I will make again with minor adjustments. Two thumbs up from the hubs!
