This is the first time I have made a review.  I made this casserole for Thanksgiving and it was excellent.  I even used reduced fat cheddar.  There was only for of us so we did have left overs but we finished it off the next day for breakfast.  I am making it again this weekend.

Another dish that our guests came back for seconds and thirds. I used only one cup of the liquid which in this case was fat free half and half and one cup of sour cream. I topped with the cheese and buttered bread crumbs. Excellent Carol and thanks!

This was an ok recipes. I would recommend it more for a breakfast dish then a dinner or lunch dish. My 4 year old loved it and it wasn't horrible. It was more like a Broccoli Cheddar omelet then a casserole. I will make this again I will just not be making it for Easter dinner again. It need a bit more seasonind so I added a mixture of my favorites to it. I added a lil garlic and I didn't have heavy cream on hand so I used whole milk. And I also used frozen broccoli which worked just fine. I am sure it cut the cooking time down. I also cooked it at 400 degrees in a large glass dish and it took like 30 mins instead of 45. Good for the most part!

I used frozen broccoli and it turned out great... but it needs more cheese and more salt.

Simple and delicious.  We love broccoli and cheddar so this was a fabulous side.  Even the kids ate it all up and asked for more!  Thanks for sharing.

This is awesome. The texture was great, the eggs were very fluffy. I don't think there was a single thing I changed about this recipe, and I usually tweak EVERYTHING!

This is NOT a casserole but more like a broccoli omelet. It was not suitable for a Charistmas dinner and my family did not like it at all. It was also very bland tasting. I will not be making this dish again.

I must say I followed the recipe to a t, found it to take forever to cook. ( not sure if its my stove though) over all I feel that this casserole did have some what good flavour, Needless to say the Family also asked me not to remake it.

This was very very good - husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  I made absolutely no changes to the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  The texture and taste were great.  One caveat - this is not a "quick and easy" dish.  Chopping board for broccoli and onions, shredder for cheese, skillet to cook broccoli and onions, bowl to mix egg, cream and cheese, baking dish as well as a pan to set the baking dish in - plus knives, spoons, beathers, etc. created quite a lot of cleanup.  Lots of work for a side dish, but if you don't mind that - the end result is worth it!

This was on the bland side for me.  My family didn't hate it, but they said they didn't really want me to make it again.  I think it's because I don't make a lot of egg based dishes and they probably weren't used to it.  I thought it was decent, but could use some spices to add more flavor.

I love this recipe. Awesome for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I was worried that it would make too much but my brother was whining that he wasn't able to get seconds of it! Made it several times now.

I made this for Christmas lunch and everyone loved it!  Only thing I changed is the amount of eggs - I used 8 instead of 12.  Will definitely make it again!

I made this for Christmas dinner this year and my picky, veggie-hating nephew ate about a third of it.  There is no higher praise.

This was very good...Wednesdays are casserole night at our house and I wanted to try something a little different...I added ham that I chopped and cooked a little with the broccoli and butter to make it a main dish. Turned out great, the kids loved it too! The little bit that was left over, my husband and I had for breakfast the next day with a few drops of hot sauce. Yum!

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I halved the recipe because I just didn't feel like chopping 8 cups of broccoli and I had some difficulty finding a pan big enough to fit a 9 x 13 in dish in to while cooking... :o) Based on other recommendations, I kept the amount of salt at the recommended amount for a full sized dish and I added extra cheese. I also topped with a cheddar and monterey jack blend for a little added flavor. It was delicious and pretty easy to make, and I will definitely be making it again!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. It could have been something I did wrong, but it was runny and didn't really have much flavor. I had most of it left over. Not a winner for us.
