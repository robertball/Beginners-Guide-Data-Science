I wasn't quite sure when I was making this what the texture was supposed to be like. I used one butternut and one accorn squash, sliced them and removed the seeds, then peeled, cubed, and boiled the pieces along with the onions. Once they were good and soft, I smooshed them with the mixer, along with the rest of the ingredients. Topped with the bread crumbs and baked. I got lots and lots of compliments on it.

I cooked this recipe for my parents grandmother brother and my niece and nephew. They all loved it! It was extremely easy to make and even the kids wanted seconds. I added garlic and a little bit of sour cream and I used Italian breadcrumbs. This will be a summer favorite.

This was a great recipe. It was delicious and easy to make. The thing I liked most is that it didn't taste like the usual squash casseroles that you use cream soups in. It has a very unique light taste. My husband loved it.

This had really good flavor but the 2 eggs gave it an unexpected consistency that we didn't really like. Would make again with one or even no eggs.

We liked the Posh Squash. I used Miracle Whip I was out of Mayo. The Whip gave it some Zip. The wife even took the left over s for lunch. Will make again.

Sounded good but we didn't care for it. Bland mushy and too much mayo.

All the recipes I have ever seen for this use summer squash. I was surprised to see that so many people liked it with winter squash. It is wonderful with summer squash (and easier) so I will have to try with winter squash.

I used half sour cream and half mayo added salt and pepper and only used one egg. The flavor of the suash was good but I was not crazy about the bread crumb topping. It seemed a little dry and didn't do much for the flavor.

Wonderful all-round recipe - one more good way to use up the hoards of squash I get out of my garden each summer. As noted by previous reviewers recipe needs salt. Like one other reviewer I sauteed the onion and bell pepper instead of boiling. I squeezed all water out of the squash with the result that the recipe was maybe a hair dry? Next time I make this I will try adding 1/4 cup honey-dijon mustard and a teaspoon of salt and I think I won't be so zealous about squeezing out ALL the water...

I tried this and thought it needs a little salt and pepper. Otherwise it was great. I used green and yellow squash. I think it would be even better with sausage or bacon crumbled into it. You could used green yellow and red peppers for color or if you like it hot use hot peppers.

I pureed the squash like other reviewers said and after adding all the ingredients was left with practically a soup! It tasted like kinda tangy but sweet. The onion didn't add much. The cheese was so over powered by the mayo you could barely taste it and the bell pepper just looked weird!

This was really good but also really rich. When I make it again (and I will make it again!) I'm going to reduce the mayo to 1/2 cup and add either minced garlic or garlic powder along with a dash of cayenne. This actually tastes better the next day as the flavors have had a chance to meld fully. Great dish - thank your for the recipe!

I am not a fan of "sweet" vegetables so this recipe appealed to me. I had one butternut that I had no idea how much it weighed....so I just followed the directions used one egg fat free mayo (probably less than 3/4 cup) and grated Kraft blend of 2% white sharp cheddar/swiss and parm cheese...and OMG!!! Fabulous!! Thanks so much.

This is amazing! Only to be fair I did modify the recipe. I didn't have the parmisan so I used swiss and it turned out so yummy! My husband who hates squash loved this!

I was not convinced that this recipe would be any good but my husband wanted a savory squash for Thanksgiving and this seemed the easiest with ingredients I had on hand. I was very pleasantly surprised! The squash is light and tasty. I omitted green pepper because I don't care for it. But it's a wonderful alternative to the standard sweet squash recipes.

My bf and I didn't really like this. It was tangy which I kind of liked but we aren't sure enough about it to make it again. I'm not thrilled with the amount of mayo it called for (I'm not a big fan of the calories or the taste) and I didn't have onion or bell pepper so I left that out. It may have been better with those ingredients but I still don't think we'd like it. So I'm going to search for something we might like better.

Tasty! I had a 16 oz package of frozen squash and didn't like the flavor of it plain so I found this recipe. I am on South Beach so I didn't use the bread crumbs and didn't have any green pepper. I still found it yummy!

Very Good..I used butternut squash..I sauteed the onion ( iused a red one) w/ the green pepper and then added it to the boiled squash. I also used 1/2 cup light mayo and 1/2 cup of a veggie parm/mozz blend...one to 2 T sprinkled on top all that lowered the calorie content and made the best way to make butternut squash I've ever tasted...My husband loved it too!!!!!

Delicious!! I used Panko Italian Style bread crumbs. Kids (young and old) loved it. It reminds me of the Au gratin cheesy potatoes (with the hash browns) except sweeter due to what ever squash you choose. I used banana squash. It sort of had a mashed potato consistency. It's definitely a new favorite.

I brought this dish to a family function (my boyfriend's family btw) and it was gone in 60 seconds! Everyone loved it and now when we go to get-togethers I am asked to bring this dish. I do admit to tweaking it just a bit....I added fresh garlic and put it into mini muffin tins with the little paper cups (can't remember what those thingies are called) anyways so they were "finger-foods". I am making this dish tonight to go with a ham steak! Thank you for a different and yummy approach to squash!
