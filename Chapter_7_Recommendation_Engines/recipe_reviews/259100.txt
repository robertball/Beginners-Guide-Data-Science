These are excellent! Once you try this recipe you will never be able to go back to eating frozen prepared nuggets again. On that note I wanted to share something helpful here. I had all of my chicken coated and was frying in batches when something came up. I stuck the ones I hadn't got to on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer. The next night I pulled them out of the freezer to finish and they actually did better after being frozen. My point is that this would be an excellent recipe to make ahead and freeze for later use. If you decide to do that be sure to freeze them individually prior to combining them so that they don't stick together.

Terrific recipe. Crispy crunchy delicious crust and very tender chicken. I'm not a frying fan, so I baked these on a cookie sheet at 400 for about 10 minutes (I used chicken tenders). My grandkids (14 and 11) loved them, as did their parents. And they're so easy! I think I'll be making these often.

Used buttermilk instead of milk 1C mixed flour 1 1/4 C in with buttermilk and 1 egg topped with crushed panko breadcrumbs. Eliminated parmesan. Great recipe! Paired with Homemade Onion Rings. Cooked in Corn Oil

Really good! For our family of 4 (teens & adults) this recipe only served 4 not 8 because it is so yummy! I didn't need a whole cup of flour 3/4 cup or even less would have been more than enough. Perhaps my pieces were bigger than intended. I used 2 large eggs and it was barely enough so next time I'll use 3. For me 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken was 2 1/2 large chicken breasts. Some of us used ranch or honey mustard dressings for dipping. So yummy!

Used 3 lg chicken breasts cut into nugget size and also strips. Had to make 1-1/2 times for coating. They were very good flavorful. I must admit the nuggets were better than the strips. I don t know if because they were more meaty or what. Will make again.

Tastes just like chicken nuggets. Didn't have any normal milk on hand so I used evaporated milk instead. Didn't seem to deter from the flavor at all.

These were a big hit at July 4th party! We actually added a little buffalo wing sauce after we took them out of the fryer.

This was the first time we have ever tried making homemade chicken nuggets, and they came out perfect! We used a deep fat fryer (outside) and cooked the pieces in 4 batches for about 5 min. The only other alternation we made was to add poultry seasoning to the panko mixture. Yum!
