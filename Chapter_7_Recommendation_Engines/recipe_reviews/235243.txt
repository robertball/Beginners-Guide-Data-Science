Very good basic stock recipe! I let mine simmer longer than called for and didn't have celery on hand this time, but otherwise followed ingredients / instructions. As soon as it cools, I'll be dividing this into some ziplocs and getting this liquid gold in the freezer!

Though this is a good recipe, I cook it for a lot longer...4 hours!  I also added a tbsp. of dried parsley and thyme, plus salt and pepper.  I don't use a lot of salt as that can be added in when making soup.  Cook slow to keep stock clear.

I simmered the pot for 2 hours instead of 1 hour.  I also added dried tarragon with about 30 minutes left.

Horribly bland. A recipe does not deserve 4-5 stars if the directions say to simmer 1 hour but everyone who succeeds at making it  simmers it for 4 hours. I added more like 10 bouillon cubes and 20 cloves of garlic, still bland, This recipe needs SALT!

I added green onions, leeks, thyme and sage to use them up.  I simmered for 3-4 hours.  It was very good.  Will use again. Thanks!

SImmer for 3/4 hours. A good stock and a base for soup.some people seem to think this is a soup recipe. It is strained when cooked and the stewed veg are  thrown out. Fresh vegs are added when making a soup.
