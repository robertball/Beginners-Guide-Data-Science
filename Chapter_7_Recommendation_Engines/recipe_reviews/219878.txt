This chili cannot be called mild, but it's very tasty! If you are sensitive to spice, don't add the jalapenos or cut back the cayenne, or both. Chili is forgiving that way. That being said, I didn't reduce anything, because we like it on the spicy side. I was in a huge hurry when I made this though, so instead of starting everything in the skillet, I threw everything straight into the slow cooker, including whole chicken breasts. Before serving, I shredded them in the pot. Also, after tasting, I decided that it needed a little something on the sweet side to cut the spicy a tad, so I added a can of corn, and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again, and I'm looking forward to lunch this week!

I am the originator of this recipe.  I like the idea of adding corn to this, thanks for the suggestion.  Sometimes I use two cans of great northern beans and one can of black beans to add a little more color.  It is wonderful served with fritos, a scoop of sour cream and a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese on top.

OH MY GOSH!  So hot!  I absolutely love spicy food but this was so spicy I got through half a bowl before I had to quit.  With a runny nose and sweat dripping off my forehead I can say it was tasty but I would definitely cut back on the peppers and chilies!  I made a whole crockpot full and no one in my family can eat it.

I just made this! YUM!! I started with frozen, boneless breasts. Added the onion and celery raw, mixed spices and sprinkled over chic and veggies. Added the chix broth and water. Let it cook on HIGH for 4 hrs.  Shredded the breasts and put back into broth. Added a small can of corn (per other folks suggestion) and at 4.5 hrs added 8 oz sour cream (that's what I had) I didn't use any cream or milk or anything. Let it cook for another 1/2 hr. Added some shredded cheddar cheese on top of each serving. My husband loved it! Kept sayin "You can make this again!"

Delish. Kept to the recipe, though, I did remove most of the seeds from the jalapeno peppers. Perfect meal on this cold winter evening.

We loved this recipe.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and backed off the peppers using a half green serrano pepper instead. I also added corn as suggested.  I cooked it on top of the stove instead of the slow cooker and only simmered it about 20 minutes.  The aroma brought my husband out of his study to help set the table. He was anxious to try it!
