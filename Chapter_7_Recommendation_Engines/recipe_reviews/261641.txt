Great muffin and healthier than most, but sadly not Whole 30 compliant. You’re not supposed to recreate baked goods with approved ingredients.  Sorry...but they are great for a treat after!

Extremely easy and quick to make!  I made two additions: 1/2 tsp vanilla and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Without added sugar you should use really dark, ripe bananas. Delicious bread like consistency when put in mini loaf pans (no greasing needed in silicone pans). I dropped batter in the bottom of the pans and smoothed as best as possible. When baking normal by dropping onto sheets the browned crust that forms is crunchy and delicious with a moist bread like center. If you're not Whole30, butter and honey are killer additions.   Either way, be careful with calories. Each serving packs a punch and you won't want to eat just one if you are abstaining from added sugar or adding honey-butter. Guilt free calories for me though it's mostly from the almond's monounsaturated fats. They can be quite filling if you eat more than one or two.  Friends I shared with loved them and asked for the recipe. I will continue to make these often.

These do not look as good in the picture as they are!  They are wonderful.  My husband, who isn't gluten free, had no idea they are GF.  I was very impressed. Made as is written.  The only thing I will do differently next time is maybe add a bit of banana extract. I used 2 bananas, but maybe needed to wait till they were more ripe.  Delicious and so easy. I plan on making these with my 2 year old grandson, as his mama doesn't allow him to eat much sugar.  These would be a fun treat, cut in half, spread peanut butter on  them, and put a little banana slice between the two halves. Just enough for two little hands. But I cut in half and spread butter. Seriously, no difference from a regular wheat muffin, in terms of texture, except these were lighter and fluffier and moist.  They look dry and crumbly in the picture, but they aren't at all that way. I used a cookie dough scoop, so it made around 20.  Thanks so much for submitting the recipe!

I had pretty small bananas so I used 3.  Also, they were several days from ripe, so that will affect my result.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Taste and texture is good.  Ripe bananas are key, though.  Next time I'm going to use more banana.  There will be many next times :-)

It seems to me that most gluten free food is packed with sugar to make up for the lack of gluten, I guess. This recipe  is not. It has an awesome just slightly sweet taste. I added the vanilla like suggested in some of the other comments. My wife ate most of these so now I'm working on my second batch.

Perfect for a quick gluten free snack! Also, to the people that wish to substitute coconut flour for the almond flour, you will only need 1/4 to 1/3 the amount of flour called for in this recipe since coconut flour is much more absorbant. If you substitute 1:1 you will most definitely end up with dry hard lumps instead of muffins. HTH and thanks for a quick, tasty recipe!

I LOVE these muffins.  They are delicious.    Good bye to bread !     I'm going to make them and give to friends.  From the remarks, I will add cinnamon from now on. I am going to try and freeze them, since this recipe makes a lot.   Russell, thank you very much for a new favorite recipe for my stash !

You MUST allow your bananas to ripen or you won't get the flavor. I added a third banana, cinnamon, and a little nutmeg as well as pecans and they were so delicious. Although it may not be technically whole30 approved since you're recreating a treat, it was worth it to me for getting thru the hectic mornings!

For the ingredients, these are amazing. I used an extra banana in my second batch and liked them even more -- I think the almond flour feels a little grainy to me. Also FYI almond flour is expensive!  

While these aren't Whole 30 "approved," because they're trying to replicate things the Whole 30 outlaws (the "SWYPO" rule), they ARE compliant  and I am thus I am using them to survive the Whole 30! Thanks for the recipe!

Was very pleasantly surprised by these. I added some chocolate chips to this recipe and they were DELICIOUS. I found them to be just as satisfying as a regular cookie or muffin.

I'm on the Whole30 and I know this isn't approved technically but oh well I had 3 ripe bananas just sitting there and I was curious to cook with Almond Flour!

These came out looking great and tasting pretty good, my only gripe was how salty they were. The only salt I added was the 1 teaspoon, and I don't see any sodium on the almond flour or coconut oil, so it was pretty surprising and a bit disappointing.

Maybe my usual recipe, with butter and, yes, added sugar (half cup) just masked the saltiness? I'd love to give it another try, maybe with just a 1/4 cup of organic sugar or using Ghee (whole30 approved) instead of the coconut oil.

Anyway, thanks for the recipe! It was fun to try :)

3.5/5 stars

I was very excited to try this after reading the good reviews. However, it was tasteless and bland, even though I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. This might work well as a base, but a lot will need to be added to it before I would consider it worth making again.

Very dry, and not very tasty, but they aren’t bad with a couple pats of butter. If you don’t like sweet stuff with coffee they are perfect. I’ll definitely eat all of them, but I’ll be glad when I’m done, and I won’t be making these again.

I was looking forward to making these "muffins" all weekend, but the recipe was so dry that the tops were burnt and the rest was barely held together. Fair warning - don't be surprised if you're disappointed.

These are tasty and moist.  I made these for just myself, so I only made 1/2 recipe.  I used an overly ripe banana that had been frozen then thawed. The banana was already liquidy and very flavorful at that point, so no need to microwave the banana.   Next time I may add a little cinnamon and/or  pecans.  I like the texture and crunch of nuts in banana bread.
A note on the frozen banana: We toss the bananas that go brown into the freezer, peel and all, to use for banana bread. Just thaw in a bowl, peel, and used in your recipe.  They will be brown, wet, and pretty gross looking, but they make the BEST baked goods!!  (use all the juice, follow the recipe as written) Alternately, we peel and slice the bananas before freezing - they are super easy to throw into smoothies that way!

I made these exactly as instructed but I only had 2 medium size ripe bananas and the batter didn’t taste quite sweet enough so I added a couple tsp of sugar (obv not following a Whole 30 diet!). They came out perfectly browned and super moist and tasty. Would be just as good w/o the extra sugar, but would def use bigger or an extra banana next time.

really quite tasty especially given how few ingredients these require! I added a tablespoon of psyllium husk powder which made them softer and less crumbly than I imagine they would be without.  really superb recipe

Quite bland. I added cinnamon, but next time I will use more cinnamon and use almond butter in place of the coconut oil in the recipe.

I made these per recipe, except I had 3 rather small bananas instead of 2 large. They were ok. I do a good amount of 'paleo' type baking and I've had better, as these were very plain.  They also took somewhere between 25-30 minutes to bake, they were still nearly raw at 17. 

I'll make them again, but add more flavor with vanilla, cinnamon, perhaps some nutmeg. I may experiment with the base recipe, swapping pumpkin for the banana! Overall a good basic recipe texture-wise, but needs some additional flavor and a longer bake time.

Used coconut flour instead of almond. The consistency was mostly flour. Rolled in my hand and was able to place on the baking sheet. After baking , They fell apart.The flavor was there but they crumbled on the tray.
