We really enjoyed this.  The way the recipe is written makes it seem more complicated than it needs to be.  Here is what I did to stream line this and eliminate the blender and a couple of bowls.   Put the cauliflower on to steam.  While the cauliflower was steaming, melt the 2 Tablespoons butter in a skillet add the finely chopped mushrooms (next time I would add some finely chopped onion too)  Add the flour and cook for a few minutes, add the half & half (I use low fat milk instead) stir to create a thick sauce.  Mine was about the consistency of Condensed Cream of Mushroom soup.  Separate the eggs putting the yolks into a large bowl and the whites into the mixer bowl.  Add the green onions, Parmesan cheese & seasoning to the yolks and stir well.   Add the steamed and slightly cooled cauliflower and using a fork, mash and stir until well mixed and the cauliflower is slightly mashed. Add the mushroom / white sauce & stir well.  Beat the egg whites and fold in.   This fit nicely into a 9" deep dish pie pan.   Grease the pie pan well or this will stick!  It baked perfectly in 35 minutes.   I omitted the curry powder and next time I would definitely add it.    Thanks for a healthy low carb breakfast.

I followed it to the T, well except I had to leave it in for much longer than the suggested time since the middle wouldn't set. It was so bland, there was a lot of liquid at the bottom of the pan, and I can't even think of what to compare the texture to.

Followed Baking Nana's suggestions and adjusted recipe to call for 1/2 the cauliflower head, 3 eggs and added grated cheese before baking to the top.

This recipe turned out great! I did use Soymilk which didn’t make a taste difference for my family and the sauce was plenty thick enough. I put it in a deep 10” pie plate and used a homemade crust and it took about twice as long to cook. But overall I will make this again when I have cauliflower that needs used in the fridge! It was easy to make and all 4 of my kids and the hubby approved!

One of my first quiche dishes.  As a kid, my mom used to always make them with onions & peppers, which totally turned me off, so I never thought to make one.   A hit with my husband and also my son who does not like cauliflower.  I hand-cut all the veges and steamed them.  I think that was the cause of the extra water, which I ended up draining by tipping the pan slightly 1/2 through baking.  I also did not whip the eggs--just mixed them in the cream sauce (made with whole milk)

I used red peppers in addition to the cauliflower and onion. Mild flavors go well together.

It was bland except for a little bit of the curry taste, and the texture was much too mushy. This was the first time I'd peaked the egg whites for a quiche and maybe that's why it was less  Also, filled a 9x13 dish...lots of wasted ingredients.
