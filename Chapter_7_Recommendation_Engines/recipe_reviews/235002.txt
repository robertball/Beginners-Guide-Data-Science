I found this recipe and decided to try it. It's better than my wife's recipe that she got from an Italian lady in Queens, NY. We have it often as we both enjoy spaghetti with meat sauce. I prefer the thick spaghetti pasta, while my wife has a gluten free spelt pasta. It's all good. This recipe will last two people for two or three meals... and everybody knows spaghetti sauce is better the day after!

It's as classic and simple as can be and it took me back in time to a recipe in my younger days that we also used for pizza sauce. Perfectly delicious!

Very yummy! I have made this sauce a few times. My husband and I really enjoy the flavor. Especially when I Add the red pepper to 
make it a little spicier.

Delish. Added extra finely cut mushies the family didn’t pick out & a grated carrot. No tinned tomato sauce in oz so did a tin of condensed tomato soup instead. Yum

The spaghetti sauce turned out very well. Because this is a hearty sauce, I used bow tie pasta and the meal was served with a side salad and fresh made garlic bread.

one change I made is to add a small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Also, doubled the spices.

I followed the recipe exactly- I didn't care for the sauce. Way too much sausage for the amount of sauce.   I will have to try to somehow add sauce to this, sorry!
