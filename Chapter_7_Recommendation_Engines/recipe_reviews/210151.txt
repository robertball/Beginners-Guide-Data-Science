I loved this recipe! I changed a couple things to make it more of a 'carbonara'. I used half cup chicken stock, half cup white wine, 2 Tbsp Cream cheese, and bacon bits and I also chopped up the chicken before adding it to the sauce in big bite sized pieces. It was so amazingly delicious. my new favorite pasta dish!

This makes a hearty and delicious dish, with some slight alterations. Instead of using jarred sauce, I used B. Mason's Alfredo Sauce recipe from this website. The fresh sauce in combination with the wine and the tomatoes was intensely satisfying. Next time I'll use more basil and perhaps a few dashes of ground white pepper. This is a crowd-pleaser--thanks!

very good! I did add some oregano and fresh spinach to it. I had extra spinach left over and thought this would be perfect. It really was a nice touch! I made pasta to go with this and just mixed it in before serving and topped with parmesan. Husband loved it and said I could make it again... which really says a lot for him to say that! :)

One of my favorite and easy meals to prepare.  The combination of chicken breast, Alfredo sauce, and Roma tomatoes is hard to beat.  This base recipe gives me many options to add a variety of ingredients for a subtle and pleasing change of tastes.  Recently, to the base recipe, I added some sauted Baby Portabello mushrooms and freshly minced garlic.  And, for a different texture, after browning my chicken, I cubed and then chopped it up slightly in the food processor before returning it to the skillet.  I served the sauce on top of a bed of Spinach Fettuccine noodles for an out of this world meal.  You should treat yourself and try it with my variation.

This recipe was a hit with my picky eaters (aged 5 and 2 yrs) and it was very quick to make.  I was concerned about using the alfredo sauce from a jar, but i used the Bertolli brand and it was great.  Next time I make this I will add some summer squash, zuchinni and a few sweet peppers.

This recipe was great; it was quick & easy! I did change a few things. The first thing I did was I doubled the recipe, for everything except the chicken (I used 5 chicken breasts & cut them in half). I eyeballed it on the olive oil, using more than suggested. Instead of plum tomatoes(I couldn't find them) I used 3 roma tomatoes. I used 1 cup of Chardonnay. 2 jars of Bertolli. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. I also added just a bit of minced garlic. As far as cooking goes, I followed everything. I served it all over fettuccine pasta. Very good!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I also used butter and olive oil to saute the chicken.  I cut the chicken breasts up into smaller pieces (just to save time) and added some poultry seasoning before cooking them.  This is a very simple and fast recipe that tastes great!

This was DELICIOUS!!! very simple and easy to make. I paired it with capelini and used classico brand alfredo sauce. Even my father (who hates chicken alfredo) cleaned his plate!! I will definately make this again!

So good! The wine really made the sauce! I added two cloves of garlic along with the tomatoes and cut up the chicken but didn't change anything else and it was amazing!

This dish turned out great!! I picked this recipe because it was simple and used very few ingredients. I added more tomatoes then called for, used garlic alfredo with aged parmesan cheese, and added pasta. It was excellent!!

The whole family loved it.  The only thing I changed is I used half butter and half olive oil to cook the chicken with shallots and garlic.  After cooking the chicken, I had to clean the pan clean due to the shallots and garlic browning too much, but the rest is history.

This was lick your plate good!  I doubled the wine and let the wine simmer with the tomatoes for a few extra minutes.  I also browned the chicken with a little garlic.  Peas went good with it on the side or mixed in like my boyfriend did.  Pasta sauce in a jar never tasted so good.

Normally I would pass up a recipe using jarred sauce, but I was in a hurry, had all ready defrosted chicken and needed dinner.  A quick swing by the grocery store for missing ingredients and dinner was on the table in 30min.  The family loved it.  Used the broth not the wine and chopped the chicken for faster cooking.  Of course homemade sauce is going to taste better, but this was better than fast food and clean up was minimal.

It was relatively easy for me - my first attempt to cook something solo. My boyfriend and I loved it and I substituted the wine for chicken broth. I got a little overwhelmed at one point, running from the chicken to the computer to recheck the instructions, but it was my first try and definitely a success.

Much tastier than I expected. I need to keep this one in mind for a quick week night meal. I threw in an extra plum tomato. I really thought the tomatoes made the sauce much more tasty. I also used a refrigerated Alfredo sauce (10 oz regular and 10 oz reduced fat). I might try a jarred brand next time as the jarred sauces are a lot less expensive than the refrigerated. I will also use some of the other reviewers suggestions of adding more veggies to this recipe. This one is a keeper.

This was fantastic! Like many others, I chose this recipe because it was simple and didn't take long to make. My husband and I both loved it. This will be going into regular rotation. I did change a few things. I used Classico roasted garlic alfredo sauce because that is what I had on hand. Also, I used 1/2 a tsp or so (just a guess because I didn't measure) of dried basil since I didn't have any fresh. We served it with rice and topped it all off with a little freshly shredded parmesan. The chicken came out perfect. Thinking about adding some mushrooms to it next time. I can't wait to make it again! Yummy!  FYI: For those of you who don't know, roma tomatoes ARE plum tomatoes. They are just one type of plum tomato. Just thought I would put this out there as I saw many people mentioning in their reviews that they could only find roma, not plum, tomatoes at the grocery store/market. Hope that helps!

Outstanding, can't wait to make it again. I did not use the jar sauce, but had two envelopes of another sauce which is our favorite, whipped them up and sauteed the tomatoes in the wine. Sliced the breast of chicken and layed it on a bed of bow tie noodles, added the tomatoes and sauce. Mmmmmm soo good! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a great base.  I used a rotissarie chicken that had been deboned, skinned and chopped.  While cooking the pasta I added a large broccoli crown that was cut into florettes and 3 large cloves of garlic to the pasta water.  I used 1/2 cup of white wine, a small can of mushroom stems and pieces and half a jar of sun dried tomatoes packed in oil.  This was a complete meal and matched anything that I've had at the pasta restuarants.

This is by far the beset chicken alfredo I have ever had! Definitely better than any I've had in a restaurant. I had no white wine on hand so I used chicken broth and it was great, but I'm sure the wine would just push it over the top! I did add a few more seasonings than in the original recipe. My husband loved it! And he is not a fan of something new. He always has some other ingredient that would be better but this time he couldn't say anything, he was too busy stuffing face!

This just did not taste good to me. The tomatoes tasted very acidic with the sauce unless it was the wine. The basil, like in most dishes I have tried it in, was just a really dominant flavor. It looked really simple, but the combination just did not work for me. The sauce might work with a more mild vegetable. I think I tried something similar with just broccoli and chicken that worked well.

I liked this recipe, but my kids didn't. I probably won't be making this again until they are older, because it seems to be more for an adult taste. Or maybe it is just my kids!?

Loved this!  I add artichoke hearts and broccoli to beef it up a bit with veggies.  The type of wine makes a big difference.  I don't like Chardonnay and used that the first time.  Made the dish too bitter for me.  I used Sauvignon Blanc the next time and it worked out better for my taste.

Wow, this was such a great recipe!  Not too salty or too bland.  Really good flavor!  A few alterations: I added mushrooms which were yum.  I didn't have white wine so I used sherry.  I was out of basil so I used oregano.  I will definitely be making this again.  Husband and 3 year old daughter loved it too!

This was just OK for me.  I sliced the chicken into strips and baked in the oven with minced garlic while I prepared orzo to serve with this.  Then I used the white wine to deglaze the baking pan and poured that into my sauce.   DH loved it, I thought it was alright - seemed a bit bland.
