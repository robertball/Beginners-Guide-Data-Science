This is a really good simple recipe. 2 important tips!! DO NOT OVERMIX THE BATTER. Just mix enough to incorporate ingredients. That's the trick to a moist banana bread. Also make sure your baking soda is FRESH. I did add a couple of my favorite ingredients and it turned out oh so good. I used a 50/50 mix of white sugar & brown sugar. I added an extra banana, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 cup of walnuts. I also find a glass loaf pan works best. Before baking I sprinkled more chopped walnuts and brown sugar on top. I baked for a total of 70 min at 325 and covered with foil for the last 30 min so it wouldn't brown too much. Yum!!

I used 2 1/2 bananas that came to 1 1/3 cups of mashed to make this bread, and the sugar I used was Sugar in the Raw organic cane sugar.  The bread itself turned out to be a smaller loaf than what I've made in the past, and it was easy to make because of the few ingredients it called for.  It is especially good toasted with butter because the outside gets crunchy.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, Joy!

This is very similar to the banana bread my mother made -  simple, moist, and tasty with the banana the star.  The only thing I would change might be using baking powder instead is baking soda to try to get a bit more rise.  I will be making this again and again especially since Marianne suggested toasting it!  Thank you, Joy

I did't get to try this yet, but the family LOVED it! I only had 4 large-ish bananas, so I just used those, which worked out fine. Also, I did reduce the salt to only 1 teaspoon b/c I felt that 2 would be too much. This baked longer than an hour in my oven...had to add about another 15-20 mins. (I covered the top of the bread w/ foil so that it wouldn't get too dark). This makes a HUGE loaf...great for sharing! This was very easy to throw together...a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I doubled the recipe for two loaves. Cooked one in a dark metal pan and the other in glass. The glass one baked more slowly and evenly. I made a couple changes to the recipe: for a double recipe I decreased sugar to 2/3c brown sugar and 2/3c white sugar. I also added about a cup of milk chocolate chips. It was delicious. Will make again.

This was the best banana bread I have ever made. Came out so moist and absolutely delicious. It's very easy to make aswell which is an added bonus. The bananas I had were quite small so I used 4, I only had self raising flour so omitted the baking powder and salt, and added 5ml of vanilla extract. I am so happy to have found this recipe....no more throwing over ripe bananas away. Problem is my 4 year old loves it so much I'll be baking this every week.

Yummy and moist! I followed directions exactly but only had 1/2 cup of sugar on hand but it still had just the perfect amount of sweetness  thanks to the bananas! I also added a pinch of cinnamon and about a tsp. of vanilla extract. My loaf turned out moist and fluffy. Perhaps the reason why some reviews stated that it didn't rise was because of over mixing? I've learned that with banana bread, if you over mix it turns out flat. I will definitely make this again!

After trying to bake banana bread one time years ago and miserably failed, I decided to look for a simple recipe. This was amazing! Was not soggy in the middle at all like the one I had made years ago. I did add a splash of vanilla extract and added walnuts to the top. Also,  baking time for my bread was only 45 minutes in a 9x5 metal pan and it was completely done. This recipe is fabulous! Will be making it more! Thank you!

This was THE BEST banana bread I've ever made! 
I only had two bananas but decided to give it a try anyway and it came out perfect. The only thing I added to the recipe was a teaspoon of baking powder n it came out light n fluffy. 
Will be making it for sure next time I have a couple ripe bananas. A+

My wife and I love this, and we made some slight modifications which we believe incredibly enhance the original, already excellent recipe. (You won’t regret these very easy additions.) 

To the batter, add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, in addition to chopped walnuts, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, and pepitas/pumpkin seeds. Prior to pouring the batter into the loaf pan, spray cooking spray on the bottom, then rub a thin layer of butter directly from the stick. Add chopped walnuts, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, and brown sugar to cover the bottom of the pan, followed by another thin layer of cooking spray for adequate toasting. Place the pan in the oven to toast the bottom layer for 10 minutes (also at 325 degrees.) Remove from the oven and add the batter, then bake as directed. If you’re not a fan of any of the above, you can adjust and use nuts and berries that you prefer. Turned out EXQUISITE, and we’ve already made this six times.

Best and easiest banana bread ever. I'm 71 and have made a lot of banana bread. I do use 5-6  bananas sometimes and on those recipes the bread disappears quite quickly.  I have also found out that this recipe adapts very well to mangos. Just squish them up just like the bananas and In the same amount. I even used canned ones. I like to add some lemon zest to the mango bread or about 1/4 cup orange marmalade.  I bake mine in a glass 9" pan. Takes about 40-45 minutes to bake. My youngest granddaughter 12, wants this recipe. Will send it too her. This is really a keeper. One last thing. If you have any left for the second day, it even gets moister and tastier.

I am 85 years young and I make this banana bread for my wife who can no longer cook. I do all of the meals, but she really loves Joy's banana bread and It is so easy to make. I add chopped nuts sometimes. I can do it by heart it is so simple.

My new favorite banana bread recipe. And I have tried A LOT of recipes. This one has such a wonderful banana flavor it doesn’t need any spices or chocolate chips. I did add about a half teaspoon of baking powder.

I was sitting in class one day and I was craving banana bread really bad. So, I took out a sheet of paper and wrote down this whole recipe. I had it for a while but one day I decided to make it. Everyone loved it! It was my first time making banana bread ever and I was super proud of myself. This recipe is amazing!!

I made the recipe as is. It was good, but I could taste the salt. To me it was very salty. So next time I make it I am going to try 3/4 tsp of salt. I've marked 4 stars because it's not the best tasting banana bread I have ever made and that's what I am using my 5 star rating's for, the best.

Truly an easy recipe to follow and make! I had enough mix that I could make two loaves of the bread. If you have two bread pans, keep one on standby! My family couldn't stop saying how good it was.

Best and easiest banana bread ever.  I made no changes.  A couple of hints.  Make sure when you add the flour to not over stir or it will fall.  STIR ONLY UNTIL BLENDED. Same goes for all quick breads, cobblers, pancake mixes, etc.  You can put as little banana or as much as you like, just remember, the more banana, the more dense the bread.

This recipe is great! I had three very ripe bananas that were not getting eaten sitting in the kitchen, and I knew that I wanted to make banana bread so they did not go to waste. I was looking around for a recipe that was simple considering I only had some basic ingredients around the house. I had everything for this one! At the recommendation of others, the only thing I did differently was add about a teaspoon of baking powder to the recipe; it turned out amazing! Super tasty, fluffy, great texture. It took just over an hour in the oven at 325 degrees.
I also added pecans to mine.
Thanks for the great recipe! Will definitely be making again.

I  put a half cup of butter, and two eggs., along with a wee bit of vanilla extract.  Came out perfect. Also changed the baking soda to 1/4 tsp, and added 1/4 tsp baking powder. Seems to make it a bit lighter.

Excellent recipe, quick and easy. This was my first time making this. I followed the recipe exactly but also added a pinch of cinnamon and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts as another reviewer did. It turned out great and my family absolutely loved it. It did take 10 minutes longer to bake, I think because I used a tinted brown glass loaf pan,  I will definitely make again! Thanks to Joy

great recipe! I should have cooked mine for a little less time, but over all tastes amazing. I added some chocolate chips in my mix making it super yummy! also tossed some oats on top to make it pretty. I have a gas stove so maybe that's why it cooked a little quick.  AMAZING

This was my 1st time making banana bread (more like a cake). I have never baked any cake before except using cake mix as a teenager. I used less sugar (3/4 cup brown sugar), had no vanilla, so used 2 tsp 5 spice powder and 2 1/2 bananas. It was absolutely delicious and it came out perfect. The hubby was impressed and I gave some to my neighbour  who said it was spot on for a 1st time and I should continue making more. This was last month and I will be making another one tomorrow. I hope I have beginners luck again. Thank you for this recipe. It took me a good month to work up the courage to try this recipe. After looking at a couple others I decided on this recipre

I'm 16 and ever since my mimmie (grandmother) whom lived with us passed, I've wanted to whip up delicious recipes just like she did for us every day...this bread is such a simplistic and delicious recipe that my very picky family even adored it. It was amazing to feel like I could make something so special for them. Just as a tip you will have to cook it for 1 hr and 20 minutes, but for the last 20mins cover the top with foil so it doesn't get too brown.

It was so easy to throw together, even with a demanding 1 year old around. I didn't even mash the bananas very well but it still turned out consistent! I added about 1/8th of a cup of dark chocolate chips for a smattering of chocolate here and there, so decadent! I will bookmark and use this again :)

I'm eating a slice as I type. Delicious! Easy! I'm glad that it's not soggy like too many banana breads I've made.  It's a true bread -- not overly sweet and nicely moist. Thanks, Joy!

Easy enough for a complete amateur and it came out great. Added a little brown sugar on top before baking. Good stuff. Wife and kids want more.

I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla, as well as baking powder (in addition to the baking soda called for in the recipe) and it was delicious! The whole family loved it--wonderful, easy recipe that I will definitely use again!

I doubled the recipe and took the advice of others about using Baking Powder. Also I added pecans. We were using up over ripe bananas so I didn't measure them, I just added them all and it turned out to be just right. I cut down on the amount of sugar suggested just for personal taste. I made 4 mini loaves plus I should have made one more, but I didn't have the right size of pan. It was a little off on size compared to the others but still tasted great.

I didn't make a single change to the original recipe because I had limited ingredients and it was perfect! Light, fluffy, cake like texture. I did however make two small loaves (8 x 3.75 disposable pans) and added dark chocolate chips and walnuts to one.  Heavenly!!  Cooking time was about 35 mins, a little extra for the one w/ choc & nuts.

Very good and simple to make. I did add chopped nuts, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla. Took 75 minutes for the center to finally bake. At the 60 minute mark I covered the edges with foil and left only the center exposed. Will make again.

The reason I chose this recipe over all the other countless banana bread recipes is because this one only uses 1/4 C butter, which is a half stick. All of the other recipes require an entire stick of butter (or more!). 

After reading the reviews, I added 3/4 teaspoon baking powder and added a 4th banana. I baked it in an 8x8 pan because I wanted to spread peanut butter frosting on top so didn't want it in a loaf form. This turned out really great and it was delicious.

Excellent banana bread recipe! So surprised since it was super easy. Substituted coconut sugar for white, added chopped wanuts and chocolate chips and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking. I used a convection oven so it baked in 45 minutes. Even then, I thought I overdid it but it was fine. Regardless, I would watch that 60 min baking time and check it after 45 or 50 min. An hour seems like a lot especially since it doesn’t rise all that much . If I make it again I will add a little bit of baking powder. Great recipe if you have bananas that got  a little too ripe for your cereal!

I read a lot of the reviews before making this, but none of them commented on the salt amount.  I didn't think a teaspoon was over the top, but YUK!  Cut the salt to about 1/4 tsp.  Everything else turned out great, it rose with the addition of baking powder as suggested.  Just can't eat salty banana bread though.

This recipe was super easy to make and simply delicious. I had some bananas that I wasn't going to use fast enough before they went bad, so I decided to look for an easy banana bread recipe. I had some once and loved the flavor, but not the walnuts. This recipe was perfect. It called for exactly the number of bananas I had left and I had all of the ingredients on hand. I did have to bake it about 5 more minutes than the recipe called for, but it turned out wonderfully. The top crust was nice and crunchy while the inside was super moist and flavorful. I will definitely be making this again.

great little recipe! super easy and comes out yummy even if it accidentally burns (i found an hour baking was much too long and cut the time to 40 minutes)... i've made this recipe many times, so many that i started doing things my own way. i usually add chocolate chips, skip the nuts, and have found no reason to dirty 2 bowls to make one loaf of bread (i use a square cake pan usually but this also fits in 2  eight inch round cake pans). the more bananas you use, the more intense the flavor, but my family are banana lovers so i'm lucky if i can come away with more than 3 (make sure they're like, yucky ripe! the blacker and squishier the better. eww)

Best and easiest banana bread I have ever eaten! or made. I think there was  a mistake in ingredients for flour. I used self rising flour instead of all purpose flour and omitted the salt and baking soda since, it is already in self rising flour. Instead of butter, I substituted the same amount of vegetable oil.  I also doubled the recipe  to make two loaves  and added  1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon per loaf. I cooked it in two metal loaf pans for exactly 1 hour as directed. It came out moist and perfect!  I will try it with chopped walnuts the next time I make it.

This was a great recipe and made a moist, flavourful loaf! Baked perfectly in a glass dish in 1 hour as suggested. Only tweaks made were I added 1 tsp of Vanilla and some chocolate chips per personal preference :) I will be making this again!!

I was looking for an easy recipe with baking soda as I didn't have any powder. I followed it almost exactly, except I cut down the sugar for my own preference. WOW! This turned out to be the best banana bread I've ever made, so easy and it was gone in a day. I would love to try and add nuts or maybe vanilla someday, but for a base recipe, this one is 'bananas!'.

Great taste with a little added cinnamon and vanilla but it came out flat. Most likely from over mixing and I think I should’ve use baking powder to make it fluffier and less dense. I will definitely use same recipe with the modifications needed.

I've never made Banana Bread before because I'm not a huge fan of bananas but since I had some turn super ripe I thought why not!?
 After researching some recipes, I picked this recipe because it looked (and was) super easy to make.  After reading the reviews I did modify it at little like some people here suggested. I added 1 tsp of Baking Power. I also added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon because I like the taste. I did however only use 1/2 cup sugar. 
 I had 4 bananas so I split this recipe into two to add chocolate chips to the second loaf. This is the main reason I used only 1/2 cup sugar.  I didn't want to get the bread too sweet with the chocolate but in the end I will use the full cup of sugar next time.
The loaves were smaller so I cooked them for 45 min at 325* instead of a full hour. The regular non chocolate one cooked perfectly in about 35 mins and the chocolate chip one took a little over 45  mins but that was in a smaller pan too. They rose just fine with no issues there.
Both the loaves turned out fantastic.  Super moist and melt in your mouth yummy. I will definitely make this recipe again to enjoy.

I just made this recipe and put it in the oven... it smells so good! I doubled the recipe, made one loaf just as the recipe, to the remainder I added cinnamon, allspice, and vanilla, and put them into a large muffin pan. I will let you know how they turn out!

Used  a 50/50 blend  of white and pure cane light brown sugar and added about 4 drops of pure vanilla extract. I cooked it in a 9x5 for only about 45 minutes (as I love my banana bread super moist). The end result was nothing short of brilliant! Will share this one for sure!

Made this recipe for the first time tonight. Used only 2 large bananas, substituted baking soda for baking powder, added a tsp of vanilla extract and cinnamon...turned out amazing!!!!  Other than maybe having to cut down the sugar next time, will be my go-to banana bread recipe

This is an excellent recipe! I have made it both exactly as is and tweaked for my family's taste. The one for family, I used brown sugar instead of white, I half tsp more vanilla, and about a TBSP of cinnamon, and 1 more banana (just because I had 4 I needed to get rid of). I admit I prefer the tweaked one, just because I love the taste of cinnamon on banana bread but both ways my family ate it up. Thanks!

Ok, I just found this recipe a week ago, and I've already made it three times!  It's that good!  One was for my sister who wasn't feeling well, and she absolutely raved about it!  She even texted me the day after to tell me AGAIN how good it was!   Make sure not to over mix when adding flour to egg/banana/sugar mixture to avoid a rubbery bread.  Mix until flour JUST incorporated into mixture--maybe even a tad short of this.  This will be my go-to staple for years to come!!  Thanks a million, Joy :)))

I have been making this recipe for years .    If I only have 2 bananas,  I add a chopped up apple.  Always add walnuts and add tsp vanilla.  If I use apple, I top cooked bread with melted butter and cinnamon sugar.

Delicious! No problems at all, and the flavor is very good. However, these were the changes I made:

2 bananas instead of 3;  1/2 the salt, because I used salted butter, not unsalted (just what I happened to have on hand); added a little bit of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger; added orange zest.

I cooked it for an hour as directed. Came out essentially perfect! I will absolutely make this again.

I was craving for some fresh banana bread and  found your recipe. Its very simple to make and turned out delicious and moist. I used raw sugar instead  of white sugar and added some roasted crushed nuts too. Now I buy bananas and can't wait for them to get over-ripe before I can bake a fresh loaf . Thank you so much for sharing.

I loved it because the top was crunchy I assume from the sugar and melted butter. but it did have that baking soda taste slightly. I think I may just use half of the recipes called for. but I will definitely make it again today.

Delicious! I loved the sweetness and simplicity of this bread! I followed this recipe to a T with the exception of 2 additions which I thought were simple enough without completely changing the taste. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and lightly dusted (not even quite half a tsp) the top with white sugar to make a sweet and pretty crust.

A super simple, 7-ingredient banana bread.  I pulled the bananas out of the freezer to use in this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and baked in 5 (6x 3 1/2) pans.  I did add 3/4 tsp. of baking powder to ensure a nice rise in the bread.  
The results were a delicious banana bread that we love to toast.  It is definitely the quickest and easiest banana bread I've made.

This was delicious! For some reason I ended up taking it out of the oven at 45 minutes and it was perfect! Super moist with a touch more ooey gooey-ness! If you love that, I highly recommend! I'm going to make it with dark chocolate chips next time!

Super fast, easy, moist, and terrific!  My family loved it.  I did top it off with a strudel type topping of flour, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon.  Saw one review which stated that it made two loaves but it only made one medium size loaf from the recipe.  Will definitely use this one again.

I've made this several times and it's my go to recipe! I always bake my bananas until they're black and shiny and it's so good! I'm going to try adding chocolate chips and walnuts this time.

I have made this recipe many, may times. My family loves it. I accidentally changed the recipe though. Rather than using baking soda, I used baking powder. I have made this recipe using whole wheat flour and all purpose flour. I prefer the whole wheat, but it is delicious with all purpose. I also add chocolate chips and bake in a mini muffin pan.

I have made this numerous times and even put it in muffin tins and it is literally DELICIOUS...

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 

It is SUPER easy and requires minimal everyone has on hand ingredients. I am so happy to have found it. Trust me people - MAKE THIS, DEVOUR IT, AND THEN... JUST SMILE...

it's so yummy! everyone goes back for seconds!! The only changes I have made were adding 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon and doing 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, sometimes I add in about a half cup of chocolate chips. I think these additions give this simple recipe more depth and complexity which seems to be true with all of the amazing compliments I've gotten on this recipe! :)

Super easy recipe that my 14-year old son makes when the bananas are too far gone!   Can make it on a whim since the ingredients are household staples and no softened butter to plan ahead.  We enjoy adding some mini-chocolate chips to the batter.

Yum! I did add baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla and walnuts as others had suggested. I also baked in 3 small (3x5) loaf pans for about 30".  Great, quick recipe!

Super easy, solid recipe. Simple to customize and requires few ingredients. I chose to use half white sugar, half brown sugar. Also added burbon-infused vanilla and nutmeg. Turned out fantastic! Next time I'm going to add toffee chips. I highly recommend trying this recipe...it won't disappoint!

The recipe lives up to its name. Easy peasy!  I choose this recipe because, it was simple & easy. 
I had only one banana, so I took out the old calculator. 
This recipe is great for teaching your child, your child can easily do this!
Added pics for results.

Just as easy as everyone else on the review said! Made them in mini loaf pans and added pecans and chocolate chips. Covered the pans with foil the last 20 mins so the bread wouldn’t brown too much. Used three large bananas and it came out so moist! Only regret is not doubling this recipe to make more!!

This recipe was fast, easy to make and delicious. I added half a cup of chopped pecans bc I love pecans in banana bread. It was also raining the day I baked this and had to bake it for an extra half hour give or take a few mins but it came out perfect!

Delicious - and so easy and quick that I can remember the recipe in my head !  I had to substitute the baking soda ( 1 tsp) for baking powder ( 3 taps) which resulted in a lighter , fully risen bread which worked out great : )

Perfectly moist and delicious!

I added 4 bananas (instead of three)
Used 1/2 organic white sugar and 1/2 cane sugar 
Added chocolate chips (semi-sweet and white)

Just made round #2 last evening for the little one’s teachers for Appreciation Week at school

I made this bread last week and it's the best banana bread recipe I've ever made...and I've made LOTS of banana bread in my lifetime!  It was so good that I made it again today.  I only made one change in the recipe, and that was to add 1 teaspoon of almond extract to give it a little more flavor.  It's definitely a keeper!

This is my go-to easy (all i make) banana bread.  I use all-purpose gluten-free flour sometimes...depending on if I want some or not and sometimes I throw in some blueberries, which my husband appreciates, but my kids don't touch.  We also have a bunch of banana trees in our backyard and my son likes for me to use those instead of store-bought bananas, which I don't really like because they are so hard and don't mix in well and they are not really sweet, but with the amount of sugar that this recipe calls for, it doesn't matter... the bread will be sweet.

Tastes like cake!
I did make some changes:
-I used 4 medium bananas instead of just 3
-Substitited yellow sugar. Could have used less
-I used 1/4 melted coconut oil for health. Think it made a nice flavor addition!
-Added 1 tsp vanilla
-Added 1/2 tsp baking powder as per reviewers
-Added 1.5 cups dark chocolate chips.

Excellent! Super easy. Followed the recipe exactly and it was light and fluffy on the inside and had a great texture on the outside. Had a hint of savory from the salt, which we loved! Thank you for a wonderful and simple recipe!

This bread is everything!!! So moist and fresh tasting. I have used a lot of other recipes and they do not compare to this one. I will not again try any other recipes. I have found the right one with this recipe. A must try and I swear you will love it!!! I know I do... Quick and easy. I whipped all the ingredients till it was nice and smooth. I pre heated the oven to 325° and let it bake till no goo on the knife. It rose up to the occasion was perfect. I did not add anything to this recipe. Just sit and wait. It will turn out perfect.

This is the best banana bread recipe! I have made many different recipes, and this is by far the best that I have tried. I followed the directions exactly, but added an extra banana. This is quick, easy, and delicious.

I did not change a thing-- texture was wonderful and the banana flavor came through strong and it was such an easy recipe to mix up. Rave reviews from coworkers and the entire loaf disappeared before lunch.

My family LOVED it. The only change I made was cooking only 45 minutes. I decided to check it at 45 minutes. It looked done, and it was according to the toothpick test. I'm glad I checked it early. It would have been dry if I had cooked it as long as the recipe indicates.

I will try other recipes before I try this one another time. If I do decide to make it one more time I would change some things.
First I would add less salt and also add the salt in the flour and baking soda mixture. It did not have enough flavor for me it tasted bland.

I’ve tried numerous banana bread recipes but this one was EXCELLENT!!!  My hubby and I loved it. I will be making this every time my bananas start to ripen. I did put in a handful of chopped walnuts. Next time I will try mini-morsels.  Follow the recipe it’s easy and delicious.

Was very moist. I  only use part of the sugar because I don't like sugar.  Banana amount in cups would help.  I had 3 in varying sizes. But the flavor was good.  Easy recipe.

I made it with 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1 whole cup and used 4 bananas instead of 3.  I substituted coconut oil for butter and also added in cinnamon.  This came out as the best banana bread I’ve made in recent memory!

Thanks for the recipe, the changes that I made are switching the white sugar to a brown one, then I tried to add 1tsp of baking powder like what they say in the comments to make it rise. My kids loved it. I tried topping it with some walnuts.

It was really good. I don't normally put my bananas in without mashing them first, but this time I am trying it without smashing them to death, but leaving it a bit lumpy by just mixing the ingredients together like advised. I had 3 smallish bananas that I used. I cooked it for the desired time in the end. The crust has a nice crunch to it, but the inside is so moist and soft. I am very pleased with this recipe! I will make it again in the future.

Delish - I didn't melt the butter - just creamed it like I always do.  3 bananas give it a really creamy texture.  It lasted all of 4 hours...making it again tomorrow.

Delicious. Easy to make. I made this at high altitude in an 8 by 8 pan since I didn't have a loaf pan. I used 4 frozen [thawed] bananas. I made sure it didn't overbake and it turned out perfectly.  I like the size pan as well. Definitely will make again with more of my frozen bananas.

This was an easy recipe to make.  You have to be mindful and follow the recipe.  Don't do more or less.
My family loved the bread! They were fighting over the idea of having banana bread.  My husband that it reeeeeeeeal cute to tell the kids the reason why banana bread was made. And....? The recipe calls for ripened  bananas the riper the better.

Had about 6 bananas that needed used so I doubled the recipe. Used 1 cup of sugar. 1 cup of brown sugar. 1 cup of walnuts. 1 teaspoon baking soda. 1 teaspoon baking powder. Rose up beautifully and tastes amazing. This recipe is definitely easy to add to and I will be making it again! Absolutely delicious!

Such an easy, basic recipe that you can whip together in minutes.  Added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla extract as other reviewers suggested.  I'll also reduce the sugar next time as I prefer it less sweet.

This is amazing and super easy.
I put my banana bread in a zip lock bag once it is slightly warm for about a day. This makes the bread super moist and have a better banana taste.

Still in the oven and it smells DELICIOUS!
With the simple ingredients, though, how can it taste anything but great 
I added in about a teaspoon of vanilla, because I found the recipe lacked it...If I wasn't in a hurry, I would have added in some cinnamon & brown sugar!
Other than that, simple, easy recipe!

The bananas shine in this recipe.  I wanted a banana bread that tasted like bananas, not cinnamon, nutmeg or vanilla. I made this bread exactly as written and it is excellent. So fast and simple. This is a definite keeper.

About 10 baby overripe baby bananas because that’s what I had, light brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of course sea salt, in a 8x8 buttered pan for about 20 minutes. This recipe is amazing!!! I’m just a weirdo and like to mess with things (: oh! I topped with chocolate chips as well. Yum!!!

It is a nice moist bread.  I did add 1/4 t of cinnamon and 1/8 t of nutmeg.  I think the flavor would have been very flat and one note without them.   I also added pecans to give it some texture.  Those aren't necessary but my family likes nuts in their bread.

Very moist but I thought it was way too sweet but maybe since I used brown sugar instead of white. I doubled the recipe, added cinnamon and substituted oil for butter. Would make it agin with less sugar.

Oh my goodness this is delightful. I accidentally put 4 bananas instead of 3. It was dinner time chaos at my house...I thought the kiddos took one-off the bananas. I could eat this till I was sick!  Highly recommend and relatively easy to make!

Just okay. Mine came out pretty densely textured. And not very sweet, though some would like that. Probably won’t make again.

I make banana bread occasionally, and I used to have this recipe where you first melt the butter then you pour it on the bananas which makes it easier to mash. It honestly works for any banana bread recipe and it makes your banana bread more moist. Also, my dad and I prefer my bread less sweet so when I make my banana bread, I use 1/4 cup of sugar. Overall I love this recipe and I highly recommend it!

A great and simple recipe. I followed the recipe as written plus added in some vanilla extract and semi-sweet chocolate chips to please “the kid” more.  Will make this again.

We loved it! I added chocolate chip, walnuts, and cinnamon (that's why it looks burnt). Literally turned my back for less than 5 minutes and my family had already gotten into it.

This recipe is so good and easy to make!!! It tastes delicious and it's quick and easy. I added candied pecans to it and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  The candied pecans just gave it a nice surprise light crunch. I made the bread in a Bundt pan because I couldn't find my loaf pans. It made pretty much a full Bundt bread cake. I wanted to eat the whole thing. I'm indulgent and on my second slice I had it with some butter pecan icecream. I wonder if the recipe would work well in a waffle iron for banana waffles. The recipe is so good and easy to follow. I pull this recipe when I have old bananas.

Best and easiest banana bread ever!  I know my aunt wants some when she leaves three overripe bananas on the counter. That’s her hint. ??.  Thanks for sharing, Joy!  I add pecans because I didn’t have walnuts the first time. It’s amazing.

I only had two bananas, so I added an egg. I also used whole wheat flour, which made my final product darker than the picture. Finally, I took it out of the oven around 55 minutes, and it was completely done--spongy, moist and absolutely delicious.

Great recipe...I've made it four times, no two ways the same.  Mostly it was lack of sugar that made me deviate.

The first time I had to throw the finished product out because I used a tablespoon for the salt instead of the teaspoon the recipe called for.  Even my husband couldn't eat it.

Second time, I used Splenda for sugar; third time, brown sugar; fourth time, real maple syrup.  Every time (except the first which was my bad), it came out beautifully.  It's better than having a great figure...well, at least it had the men come sniffing around, looking woebegone and begging for Joy's Banana Bread.  :D

The only change that I made was to take out the egg and use 1/4 cup applesauce.    I did this for my vegan friends.   This is the very best, easiest recipe I have ever made.   Love it.

Thank you!!!!

Loved it! Was looking for an easy breakfast bread and this was it! Not sure why others had a problem with rising. Mine did. I did need to add an extra 9 minutes baking in the toaster oven.

I should have started checking it at 50min.  Was a bit overdone, but still very good!

My wife thought too salty.  I didn't.  I thought it was just right so of course I am going to try again with 1/2 tsp salt.  It was also a bit over baked so I will start the tooth pick test at 50 minutes.

Delicious!  I added a tsp of baking powder, a tsp of cinnamon, and a splash on vanilla extract based on reviews. I also covered the pan with foil for the last 15 minutes.  It took about 65 minutes in my oven.

Super super moist. Not too heavy. Absolutely yummy.
You may want to put foil over the top of the bread about 2/3rds through baking, it may just be my oven, but the top got done faster than the inside- not a big deal because once I covered the top it turned out perfect.

Easy one bowl recipe and only 7 ingredients!  After reading that some people had loaves that did not rise, I added 1/2 tsp. Vinegar. That reacted nicely with the baking soda and made a high, light loaf.

Made this recipe as listed. Delicious! I did remove ten minutes early, maybe due to glass loaf pan? But it was done at that point. Excellent, easy recipe! Thanks!

Super easy recipe.  Flavors are balanced really well.  I tried 1t of baking powder and 1/2t of baking soda attempting to get a bit more rise.  It didn't rise more but was beautifully light and moist.  I also added about 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut on top.  I think I will double the recipe next time.

This banana bread recipe turned out great.  It was super easy to make with very clear directions.  I don't like reading reviews when people say they substitute ingredients.  However, I only had two bananas, so I added a macintosch  apple and it tasted great.

Perfect.  I also take it out of the pan and wrap it in aluminum foil immediately after it comes out of the oven.  Then it steams itself and retains the moisture.

This recipe could be called “No Fail Banana Bread”.  I found this exact recipe in a magazine in the early 1970s and have made it a zillion times since.  The blacker the bananas, the better for colour and taste.  I save bananas till they go black, peel them, and freeze them till I’m ready to bake.  And I add a glug of vanilla because I like vanilla.  A fabulous, reliable recipe which can also be used for mini-muffins - I bake them at 350 for about 17 minutes.

Moist and delicious! Followed the recipe, but also added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. It’s a hit with the whole family!

ETA: I just made a double batch and made a loaf and 12 muffins. Did the muffins at the same temp for 40 mins and they came out great!

Very good recipe.  Added walnuts.  Did not melt butter, just softened it.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Perfectly baked at 1 hour.  Will make again.

Easy and so good! I add about 2-3 Tablespoons of vanilla yogurt, which adds the “special ingredient “ flavor that wows everyone. My family loves it.

I've made this bread twice & it was perfect each time.  Made it once with baking powder rather than baking soda & didn't notice much of a difference.  Excellent and easy recipe!  Tried throwing in some semi-chocolate chips and found it even more amazing!

I'm giving this recipe two stars only because it is not for banana bread. I was looking for a banana bread recipe and this cake recipe is what I got.  AllRecipes should rename their banana cake recipes to indicate what they actually are to avoid confusion.  There are many real banana BREAD recipes out there that utilize YEAST that are delicious.  I expected better from AllRecipes.

Some tweaks-used 4 bananas, half brown and half white sugar. added vanilla, cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, and allspice small amount. Everything else exactly as specified , fit in one large size loaf pan perfectly with room to spare. I play around w spices and usually add chopped nuts, whatever I have on hand, pecans or walnuts seem best. this makes an awesome nice full loaf of rich, tasty banana bread! ***Tips, I try not to overmix batter and always use extra ripe bananas.

I am definitely not a Baker and this one was so easy and so good! I read the other reviews so we added 1 Tsp of Banking Powder, 1 Tsp of Vanilla and a Pinch of Cinnamon. We also doubled the recipe. It came out Delish and for someone that cannot cook, I am impressed! I checked it at 45 minutes and one was done and then left the second one in for 10 more minutes so check it early. This one is a keeper!

Great recipe. Much like many others, I too used 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c regular sugar. I folded in about a cup or so of chopped walnuts that I pre-roasted in the oven first.  I also added some ground cinnamon and baked in a glass loaf pan which I “greased” with butter before I filled it with the batter. It turned out great!

My first time ever making banana bread and after a brief search here, found this and went to work using the well-ripened last 3 we had. Other than a bit darker color on top as I remember, it tasted really good!  Did another batch, adjusting the time to 45 min. and still was a success! Going to make this a keeper as it not only was easy to make, but easy to remember the recipe without a recipe! :)

Absolutely delish. Like another has mentioned this bread does not rise up a whole lot but that won't deter me from making it again. It's sweet, with a crispy chewy crust and a moist interior. I added 1 tsp vanilla (to the wet ingredients) and 1 tsp cinnamon (to the dry) and went 50/50 with white sugar/brown sugar. I think the bread would still have been perfectly yummy without those adjustments. You do need to be careful not to over-mix, so I used a spatula to combine everything. 

Perfectly baked through after 60 min in my convection oven.

Quick, easy and delish. Actually made two batches. 1 loaf and then 21 muffins. Added chopped walnuts to the muffins but made as recipe called otherwise. Ate them warm with butter and then room temp the next morning.

This is super easy for a bachelor to do without screwing up and it comes out great.   I add chopped dates, pecans, and a few tablespoon of chia seeds (I love the crunch they give) and it goes from great to awesome!

I added vanilla, an extra egg and 2 bananas because I had them, but only a half cup of sugar. I will make it again trying the original recipe but I have had rave reviews from everyone I shared it with, the way i changed it.

I switched the allpourpus flour for almond flour to lower the carb content and switched the sugar for swerve to lower the carb content. Turned out phenomenally! Tasted just like banana bread but far less carbs closer to 12carbs for the whole loaf instead of 42carbs

I added chocolate chips as well as some cacao nibs and coated the sides of the pan with coconut sugar. I cut back on the sugar by 2/3 and replaced it with coconut sugar. I used coconut oil to grease the pan. I also used coconut flour to cut back on the regular flour - I was experimenting so I cut it back by 1/2 and used 1/2 regular and 1/2 coconut. came out great!

This was a very easy recipe to follow and tasted so good!  I did have to change it up a bit because I only had 2 bananas. 
I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and cut the flour back to 1 cup. Also cut back the baking soda a bit and the salt.  But I did keep the egg!   I used the little mini cupcake tin and got 48 little banana muffins. Baked them for about 12-14 minutes.  The grandkids love them.  Win-Win.

I made it exactly as described,  and it did not come out well.  I believe proportions are off, and adding the salt at the end wasn't good because  I could taste salt throughout the whole loaf.

This bread is delicious! I followed the recipe without making any changes and it turned out great. It's very moist, fluffy, and sweet. The hour baking time was perfect for my oven. Probably my new  favorite banana bread recipe!

After making this, I wondered why I had EVER made banana bread from a box!! This is a family favorite and I am ALWAYS complemented! I make it in a double, triple, or quadruple batch and it turns out top notch!

Easy?  Super Duper Easy.  

I read a lot of reviews and  decided to substitute the baking soda with baking powder.  

I was craving some FRESH  banana bread but there are no  bakeries near me.  I decided to let my fingers do the walking to allrecipies, my fave site for delicious and easy recipes.  This recipe has earned a permanent home in my kitchen.

Thank you allrecipies and Joy.  A joyous day it is.

Very moist!  Did add 1 tsp baking powder and tried using 1/2 c sugar with 1 tbs Stevia plant leaves that I had crushed up.  (1 Tbs of crushed leaves = about 1/2 c sugar) Worked well! Will make again.

it came out quite good! the family loved it and there were no complaints other than I have to make one next time with nuts and one without. I made some adjustments as some reviewers stated. I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon  cinnamon  as well as adjusting the sugar to 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup sugar. should have taken a picture but it didnt last long! Will be making again and again!

Didn't rise as much as I would have expected, maybe I did not add enough baking soda.  Regardless, it tasted absolutely brilliant.  It was light and moist on the inside and the crust was crispy and very tasty.  We ate the whole loaf as soon as it cooled off.

Really easy recipe.  Very moist and flavorful.   Definitely would make again.   I used a casserole dish rather than loaf pan .  My family eats banana bread so quickly I love making as bars rather than bread.

It was delicious. After reading other reviews, I added a tsp of baking soda and a tsp of vanilla. It turned out okay, it took about 1.5 hours to cook though. Overall, I’m pleased with how it turned out. I just recommend adding the baking powder to it so that it rises.

This recipe was my first time making banana bread and it was a success. I added vanilla and cinnamon plus cut the sugar in half. Simple and good. Next time I'll cut the salt in half too.

Loved this recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used apple sauce instead of butter and lastly I added chocolate chips for my chocolate loving family.

Was looking for an easy recipe. So glad I found this one as I'm not the best baker.
This was delicious! Made just as recipe stated. 
Very moist! Cooking time was spot on with my oven. Saved to my favorites so I can make again when I have the perfect bananas.

Pretty good! Next time I will cut back the salt, and I think I will also try adding baking powder. It didn't have the rise I expected. Had to cook it an extra 10 minutes to be done inside. Added a little vanilla. Next time I will try some cinnamon, too! Very easy, just too salty as is.

I doubled the recipe. Everything I used was organic. I used 1 3/4 cups of sugar, 1 1/2 cups of white org flour, 1 cup org whole wheat, 1/2 cup org coconut flour. 1 3/4 cup of org sugar, coconut oil instead of butter, 1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup org unsweetened shredded coconut. Added 1 tablespoon  more of coconut oil I was afraid adding the coconut flour may make it dry. I added about 5 more minutes to baking time. All I can say is WOW! Healthy and so good, didn't miss the extra 1/4 cup sugar! Thank ogoodness I made 2 loaves!

I put 5 bananas in bread after reading a review.  It taste great and I wanted to make it more nutritious.  I never would have added more without reading a review.  So glad you have such a large number of reviewers!

I used 6 really ripe baby bananas, some zest from an orange and cream of tartar to make it rise. It was a really refreshing and tasty twist on old fashioned banana bread. I don't care for nanna bread but this was pretty good. I made two batches.

We added one teaspoon of vanilla. It is such an easy recipe, our young kids (age 8) can make it with minimal help. I only need to help transferring it to the pan and putting it in (and out) of the oven.

Fantastic recipe! I made a couple of modifications though, just because it seemed right. I used dark brown sugar instead of white because I like the molasses taste, and I added a splash of vanilla, because yumm vanilla! Also sprinkled a little extra brown sugar on top to give it a sweeter crunchy top. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

The taste is great, I did add the vanilla and cinnamon someone suggested.  For some reason it is really super dense I was very careful not to stir too much.  I will try again.

I made this wheat free, using a combo of King Arthur's gluten free flour, corn starch, and tapioca flour.  I added 1 cup of very coarsely chopped walnuts.  It was to die for!  And easy, so very easy.

This recipe is exactly like my banana bread recipe I have been using since the early 1970's. I love how quickly it goes from the mixing bowl into the oven to bake. My favorite add-Ins are: 
semi-sweet chocolate chips, walnuts or pecans, and white chocolate chips.  Delicious!!

Followed the recipe exactly, but my bananas were very small so I threw in one extra. It did rise for me, but was very dense. Kids still seemed to like it.

Very, very good.  I used about 5 small bananas that I had on hand (three were previously frozen, so I thawed them and drained the juice).  I, too, added a splash of vanilla and a teaspoon of baking powder, as others had suggested.  Took about an hour and twenty minutes to cook and came out moist and delicious.

Easy and moist and bakes up nice and not wet in the middle. Added 1/3 cup sour cream and 2 eggs instead of 1, and the mashed banana came to 1 1/4 cups.

I made it as directed,  twice already and they came out perfectly.  I will be making it again.  Everything went smoothly,  although it did take longer than an hour. 
Not sure if this matters, but I used coconut oil to grease my pans. Because tropical.

Thanks, Joy!!! This recipe is hands down the BEST banana bread recipe I've ever made! It's super moist and decadent. Although not a must, I followed the advice of another reviewer and made slight variations: 1/2 cup of granulated sugar & 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, teaspoon of vanilla flavor, no baking powder needed (as long as you use self-rising flour)

Yes. I doubled the recipe and had to add a cup of water. I also increased the temperature to 350° cutting the bake time by a quarter. It was very moist and the kids couldnt get enough with a little margarine spread. Thanks so much!

Banana bread isn't difficult and this is the easiest recipe I've used yet. And the best! The only change I made was to sprinkle some brown sugar on top before putting it in the oven. I used a 9x5 pan and it took a bit under an hour. Probably could have removed it 4-5 min sooner than I did even.

I love using this recipe. I always use it but instead of butter I use vegetable oil. My mom always used vegetable oil instead but I made it for my mother in law and she loved it! I also don’t use as much baking soda due to always being able to taste it so I use a little baking powder

I liked it! I added some more butter than on the recipe since the dough was a bit rough. The taste is really good. If you want it less sweet just put 1/2 - 3/4  of a cup in. I added some cinnamon and a tiny bit of nutmeg and it gave a really good taste! :)

Easy & Good
Might be nice to add some cinnamon & maybe a touch of baking powder but the recipe is really good the way it is as well.

This was easy and fair quick. I had four over ripe bananas and didn't use the really brown bits, so I guess I used 3. Based on some of the reviews I read, I only used 3/4 cup sugar, and I added a splash of vanilla and about a 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon, allspice, and ginger. It came out fantastic.

I love this banana bread. I make it for my family pretty often. Most of the time I make muffins instead of a loaf, it cooks faster and easier for toddlers to handle

Very good! Had 5 bananas so I doubled the recipe and baked in muffin tins instead of a loaf. Baked them for about 20 minutes and they came out perfectly delicious and moist!

Second time making this. First time the bottom half started to burn a tad bit. (I can’t remember what I thought went wrong) Other then that, it was DELICIOUS. This second time I knew my baking soda wasn’t super fresh, so I added almost a full teaspoon of  baking powder (on top of the soda and salt). I ended up putting my sifter tool right over the bowl of wet ingredients (I added vanilla and cinnamon to the wet) and added the dry ingredients through that. Then I mixed all ingredients until just mixed. I also set my timer for 45 mins (I was worried about the burning) I checked it at 35 mins and covered with foil, then added 10 mins to the end. It came out perfect! (So about the last 20 mins with foil on top)  This is just a perfect basic recipe. I think next time I’ll try the 50/50 white and brown sugar, just because. :)

I double the recipe.
I do half packed brown sugar and white. 
I did only 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. 
Added 2 tsp vanilla. 
Bake about 15 minutes for cupcakes.
This is my new go too. 
I have made 2 double batches in a week by request!!

This banana bread was super easy to make, my kids helped me and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. I did make some tweaks, following some others and it turned out amazing!
 I doubled the recipe, so I added a little under a cup of white sugar, and a little under a cup of brown sugar. I also added 2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 tsp of vanilla extract, and baking powder. 
Cooked it for 40 minutes, then finished the last 20 minutes covered with foil so the top wouldn't over brown. I cooked in a glass rectangular baking dish instead of loaf pan. It turned out amazing.

So good! I doubled the recipe, and like many others I did 50/50 white and brown sugar, a tsp of vanilla and some cinnamon. 

I made the mistake of mixing the wet and dry ingredients together, rather than separate first. But you wouldn't know it! This is a simple and forgiving recipe. Next time I make it, I'm gonna add chocolate chips. 

10/10 great recipe!

Very moist! Hands down one of the best banana breads I’ve ever made! I used brown sugar (only 3/4 cup), eliminated salt and added chopped walnuts. Other than that, we used the recipe as is. So delish! We ate almost the entire loaf right out of the oven. So easy to mix (we hand mixed) This recipe will replace my old one for sure!

I'm a novice at baking, but this was one of the easiest and most successful recipes I attempted. However, I added a dash of mixed essence and grated cinnamon as it enhanced the banana flavour. I also used brown cane sugar rather than processed white/granulated sugar. It was perfect.  I will make again but will use 1/2 cup of sugar, since the bananas I used were very ripe and extremely sweet and throw in some chopped walnuts

Substituted  1/4 cup packed  dark  brown sugar,  1/3 white sugar. 1 tsp cinnamon.  1/2 tsp each baking powder, baking soda & salt. 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. 1/4 cup cold butter/margarine

I've found that making assorted breads,biscuits, and pies that using cold butter/margarine helps with lift and it also helps keep the bread moist.

I poured the batter into a dark 8x8 pan and baked it in my power air fryer for 40-50 min or until toothpick  inserted in the middle comes out clean.

I added cinnamon and nutmeg and vanilla if doubled it fits a 12×4×4 loaf pan.  I find that if I only make one I won't get any so this is now my go to banana bread recipe. Thanks joy from me and my family.

I made this classic banana bread but with a twist! Along with the baking soda, I also added a tsp of baking powder. For more flavor, I added a splash of vanilla to the wet ingredients and then cinnamon (to taste) in the dry ingredients. When completely combined, I added about a half cup of mini chocolate chips. I then poured the mixture into a buttered glass Pyrex dish. My bread came out of the oven in the allotted time,  one hour, with no cracks. It was perfectly moist and yummy! Will definitely make again!

I love it. Easy, yet came out perfect. I followed the advice of others and added a pinch of cinnamon, a tsp of vanilla, a half tsp of baking powder, and a cup of chopped pecans.  Will definitely make it again.

I made a triple batch and added one bag of mini semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter before pouring into the loaf pans. Perfect! I will be using this recipe again and again. My friends can't get enough.

This is the easiest and tastiest banana bread I’ve ever made. I added a tsp of vanilla and a little bit of cinnamon and reduced the sugar but sprinkled a little bit on the top.  It was delicious. My kids had fun helping me make it. They loved it and my husband said it was perfect.

Beautiful! Cut the sugar in half.... use 5 banana’s instead..... I store my over ripe banana’s in the freezer until I have time to make bread.... also walnuts add the protein to sustain your hunger... and makes a nice snack with tea or coffee.... xo

It was really well done, but still kind of salty. I would recommend reducing the salt, and adding a dash of cinnamon, allspice, and ginger powder into the banana mixture before adding flour etc. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, and that might have added to the somewhat weird flavor at the end, but it rose wonderfully and ended up being a beautiful brown color.

I will absolutely make it again and I might make it again today. I'm trying to ask a question about this bread and maybe someone on here can answer for me. Can I make an easy bread like that using apples? Same ingredients that I would normally have in the pantry like I had all of these ingredients at home.

Very good, very moist banana bread. I think I will add another banana to the mix next time. It's a keeper. Good recipe.

I'm not a frequent baker, so I loved this recipe for being easy and successful.  Some of the reviews said to not over mix so I just barely combined the ingredients and the result was very nice.  I also took the advice to add a little baking powder and some chocolate chips.  Next time I will make sure to mix the wet mixture better because I had some big banana blobs within the bread.

Great bread! Not over mixing is the key. 2nd batch I cut the sugar in half and topped with Raw sugar...so I’ll see. 
Also added walnuts both times. 5*

So easy and delicious!!! Thank you for this recipe! I had 3 bananas that were really ripe and really brown;) and needed a 3 banana recipe. Since I couldn’t find my old recipe I googled 3 bananas recipe and found this gem! I had only bread flour so I used that and went with a little less sugar and added crashed walnuts on top right before baking. Came out great!

This is super easy, and turned out yummy. I think its a great base recipe, but next time I will add some things. Maybe a type of nut, cinnamon, or nutmeg to give it a little lift. But for anyone with sensitive tummies, children, etc this is a tasty, simple version. Will make it again!

Absolutely easy, quick, moist, delicious. The longest part is waiting for it to come out of the oven.

I loved this recipe.  It was so simple and they came out so good.  I used smaller pans and added about 2 cups of batter per pan and cooked them for 1 hour at 355.  Came out perfect.  For 6 pans I used 13 bananas and multiplied the recipe by 4.

Great recipe. Not going to change my score from 5, BUT it took me  1:30 total time. It may just have been my oven (why it's 5 stars) and may have been my adding walnuts.

First time making banana bread and the recipe was a solid foundation.

This was an easy recipe that my daughter was able to help with. It turned out great even though I over baked it by 20 minutes (I forgot about it lol). The crisp actually was a great touch to it so I can only imagine how it would taste if I didn't. The inside was still moist and tasty as well. The only changes I made was I substituted the eggs for ( 1Tb of vinegar mixed with 1tsp of baking soda) since my son is allergic to eggs. Great recipe.

My family loved this bread! I adjusted it a little for my liking. I opted for 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of  the white sugar. I added a splash of vanilla, a dash of nutmeg, and used 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Also only baked for 50 mins. Came out nice and  fluffy!

I used half and half white and dark brown sugar, and reduced the amount all together as this recipe is a tad sweet, but all together it is excellent and super easy to make.

Super easy and basic. Lends itself to additions and tweaks very easily. I followed the recipe the first time when I was in a pinch to make something for my students for a class party and didn't have much in the house. It turned out great and they loved it. The second time, I made the following changes: 4 bananas, whole wheat flour, 1/2 c white sugar + 1/4 c maple syrup + 1/4 c honey, 1/8 c butter + 1/8 c margarine (+  dash of oil when I saw it was getting too thick),  2 dashes of cinnamon + 1 dash each allspice & ground coriander seed. 

To make this even healthier/gf (though it would change the density I think), you could do oat flour. I also might try adding nuts next time and throwing in sliced banana at the end.

Hahaha! I just put a review for whole wheat bread on here in the banana bread spot! What a goof ball! Anyway, this is the recipe I use now for banana bread. I reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I reduce the sodium by using light salt and only half as much. It works well and is still fairly sweet.

Excellent recipe! Added a half a tsp of baking powder and a quarter tsp of baking powder, half a tsp of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. Used half a cup of brown sugar because that’s all I had. Baking time was 45 mins. Turned out perfectly, thank you!!

First banana bread I’ve ever made and it turned out perfect! I changed up a couple things. I used 4 bananas instead for that little extra. I added a bit of vanilla. I also added a tablespoon or 2 of brown sugar just for that sweetness. I used about 3/4 a teaspoon of salt instead just worrying that it was a bit much. Cook time and temp was set at the same and turned out perfect. Follow the directions of not over mixing. This really is key for the “moist”

YUM! I’ve made a lot of different banana bread recipes and this ranks among one of the best!! It’s super moist with tons of flavor. I’m definitely going to make this one again. I followed the recipe as is and don’t think it needs any alterations.   If you like nuts go ahead and add them -I think I will next time just to try it!

I did make a few changes. I added baking powered instead of baking soda as per another reviewer.  I also decreased the sugar and used only brown sugar. Great recipe.

Delicious!!!! So easy and delicious. I used 2 bananas because it was all I had and I added 1teaspoon of vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon sugar ontop before baking. I also used a muffin tin because I don’t have a pan to make it a loaf. Believe I cooked same temperature and time, maybe less on the time since it was muffins. Very very good!!!

I made it and added nuts.  It was very good.  I cooked it in muffin tins instead of as a loaf.  It only took 20 minutes to cook.  My husband really liked it that way.

I used 5 bananas and 1.75 times the ingredients (well, 2 eggs). I added 5 oz walnuts and baked in 8x8 pyrex glass dish. It rose just above the pan while in oven but settled. Came out very nice. I've had better but this is my first time ever making it.

Doubled the recipe and added vanilla and cinnamon (and some chocolate chips! Did some slight modifications according to other reviews. Love that there isn’t a ton of butter like other recipes I’ve made from here.

This was my 1st time ever making Banana Bread! After looking it up if it would be okay, I substituted margarine for melted butter, and used half the amount of sugar (as suggested in a forum I found). This was indeed extremely simple! And the two loaves I made came out golden brown and very moist!

I used self rising flour so I did not use the salt or soda. I also used vegetable shortening instead of butter. Preparing it was easy and fast, with distractions and mashing the bananas it took me about 25 mins to prepare. It rose as expected and it smells absolutely divine.  The taste is even better!!

I added a little vanilla and had 1 tsp of both baking soda and baking powder based on other reviews and it turned out delicious! It fell a little when I took it out of the oven- not sure what I'm doing wrong to cause that, but otherwise, it was perfect!

Notes mostly for my benefit in recreating this wonderful bread. I made 1 1/2 recipes because I had 5 small, very ripe bananas which was just over 2 cups. I used two eggs and half of the sugar was brown sugar . I added  a cup of walnuts and a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla  because we prefer it that way. I also added 1 tsp of baking powder to the dry ingredients to make it a little lighter. I was careful not to overbeat after adding dry ingredients. Baked in two metal loaf pans for 55 minutes.

Absolutely delicious!  I tried more complex versions of banana bread recipes, but this one is surely the best and easiest.  I do sprinkle a mixture of sugar and cinnamon on top before putting it in the oven.  Wonderful!

As the title states, this is really easy to make. We added chocolate chips, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The other reviews mention it doesn't rise, but honestly it doesn't need to. My husband and I both loved it!

Yummy! The crust was crunchy and the insides was soft and moist. 
I made some changes tho- I put 5 large very ripe bananas (the more ripe the more sweet) and used less sugar and salt. Butter was salted butter. I also used half baking soda half baking powder. (No logic there! Just for fun) 
Thanks Joy!

So easy to make and super delicious. I ended up using organic cane sugar and it was the right sweetness for me.

I only had 1 large ripe banana, so I added 6ounces of vanilla Greek yogurt...It turned out good. Moist. I think next time I'll add some pecans, and maybe a little stressed

This recipe is PERFECT and DELICIOUS as is.  On occasion, I'll add 1/4 cup of walnuts and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips right before popping it in the oven.  On average, I make this banana bread twice a month.  It's so simple to assemble with a few staple ingredients and yet is so delicious.  Joy, thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

Turned out great. I followed the recipe BUT added baking powder ...and DON’T  overmix ...just blend the ingredients together.  It came out soft and moist on the inside with a little bit of a crisp on the outside. A quick and easy recipe. I definitely will remake again!!!

I wanted this to be a little richer. It's a decent recipe, but tastes a bit plain, for lack of a better word. I would use this one if I didn't want to beat butter like a lot of other banana bread recipes, but likely wouldn't make this again. Pro of this recipe is that it forms a crispy crust.

This was a great recipe.  Followed directions exactly except for cooking it 70 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  Delicious alone or warmed with a little butter.   Will be making this often.

This was a very good recipe. I only used 2 1/2 bananas to cut back on the sweetness from the banana. And I added a pinch of brown sugar and some pecans.

I made this recipe last night. I used baking powder instead of baking soda only because I was out of the soda. It came out wonderful!
Was gone by the next afternoon. I will definitely make this again.

I use cane sugar instead of regular sugar; no butter but two full spoonfuls of organic coconut oil and grease the pan with same oil. I use different crushed nuts with each batch and on occasion, splash a dash of rum and a few wee sprinkles of coffee grounds. On other batches I dash it with a zest of vanilla extract and diced pineapple. The house fills up with the aromatic promise of baked comfort. When I have guests over, I like serving it with iced, unsweetened orange spice tea or a nice cup of hot cocoa. I love the original rendition but have really enjoyed modifying it here and there. My guests’ reaction is always a hit. Happy baking, all! ??????

Was looking for a good, simple banana bread. This one was absolutely great. Followed recipe exactly and it was perfect. Making it for the 2nd time this week as I write this review. This time I have added 2 tsp of cinnamon but changed nothing else. Seems like a bread you could add to your liking....pecans, walnuts, chocolate chips,  mmm.
Thanks for the great recipe, its a keeper!

This has become my go to recipe: dinner gatherings, family events and post Thanksgiving breakfast. Everyone enjoys it and my husband has requested I add it to my repertoire. It is so easy to make with not a lot of ingredients. I loooove it.

I just added some cinnamon (a dash) and some baking powder (1/2 tsp) and chocolate chips. This was fantastic! I will make it again and again!!

My 10 year old daughter and I made this today. I was looking for a simple recipe that I could teach her so that she could make it next time on her own. And this recipe fit the bill perfectly! Plus, it tastes amazing!!! I did make a couple little changes...I had 4 small-medium bananas and I used them all. I also added about a tsp of vanilla. Instead of a whole tsp of baking soda, I used a 1/2 tsp baking soda and a 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Oh, and I only used a 1/2 tsp of salt since I used salted butter. We will most definitely be making this recipe again!

EXCELLENT! This is such a simple and delicious recipe. The only modification I made was adding 1tsp of cinnamon. This was only because of personal preference, not because the recipe needs it. Thank you for sharing.

I have always wanted to find a moist banana bread recipe and I finally have and it's delicious!  I watched the video as I made it and did each step as they did to make sure I made no mistakes. I added the ingredients that were added to recipe in the video only and it was sooooo yummy! One loaf is not enough!  You must double it so it lasts more than one or two days! Watch the video to get the extra ingredients. Things I've never seen added to banana bread before,but delicious,

Amazing! This is my first time baking something that didn’t come in a box lol. I love love love banana bread and when I saw I had 3 very ripe bananas I wasn’t going to eat I decided to make this. The recipe turned out amazing! It was super easy to follow and all the ingredients I had on hand. Definitely add the whole cup of sugar though because I added a little less but it still tasted phenomenal. I put it into muffin cups and it took a lot less time. (32 minutes). The whole house smelled amazing and they taste sooo good warm with butter. 10/10 will make it again. Fair warning though, once you start you’ll wanna eat all of it :)

This bread was very good but with alterations, hence the 4 stars. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, two dashes of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of salt, and 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also baked it at 350 for 50 minutes.

This has got to be the most forgiving recipe ever invented!!
I prepared it as written (added chips and nuts).  I put the butter into the microwave to melt, and continued mashing, measuring, greasing, mixing, etc.  My only addition was 1/2 cup chocolate chips and some chopped nuts.  Poured it into my loaf pan and even stuck it in the oven.  5 mins later I opened the microwave - guess what I found?!?!?!  (!@#$%^& - then LOL - :()) So - removed  pan from oven, poured the melted butter over the top and mixed it in with a fork.  It was a little underdone on the bottom, but absolutely delicious, demanding a second piece be eaten immediately.   I imagine it will be even better prepared properly.  Try it!!!

Great basic recipe  and super moist. I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon and decreased sugar by half. I used half teaspoon of baking powder and half teaspoon of baking soda and a bit less salt.

I liked the taste of this bread, but not the texture. I found it a little too heavy, but if you like your banana cake dense, then this recipe is for you. Just one warning: the use of baking soda  alone means that the leavening is dependent on the acidity of the bananas. If your bananas are really sweet, I suggest adding  1/2 tsp of baking powder , or a little lemon juice to the recipe. I did this the second time, and it was considerably lighter.

So easy and so delicious! Everyone love it.  I had never made banana bread and I happened to have a couple of ripe bananas. I did not make any changes and it was so moist. Next time I will sprinkle some walnuts and perhaps a bit of cinnamon.

I have made this several times now. Doubled the recipe as well. Only change I make is add 1/2 tsp baking soda. Sometimes add 1/2 cup walnuts depending on who will be eating it. Love this simple and easy recipe.

I like stuff in my banana bread - I added a half cup chopped walnuts and a half cuo chocolate chips.
Also  the recipe doesn't mention it but- don't forget to grease the pan - my loaf stuck to my pan

I had a bumper crop of bananas this summer and have made more.than a dozen loaves based on this recipe.  I replace the butter with avocado oil, and you don't even miss the butter.  I also use half whole wheat flour and half brown sugar (not packed).  Some times I add nuts, cinnamon, and vanilla, for variety.  You can even replace the egg with chia seeds soaked in water if you need a vegan loaf, but it comes out great every time.  A perfect base to get creative, that also can stand on its own.

Excellent recipe.  I was looking for one where all the moisture came from bananas not water, sour cream, oil, etc.  I like the lower amount of fat this recipe had compared to some. However I was wanting to make muffins.  I did add pecans and made a double batch.  Using regular cupcake tins these made 36 muffins.  I added cinnamon to the last dozen which my husband liked the best but I like them with just the banana flavor.  They were moist and fluffy and delicious.

Because there was the issue of the bread rising (or not), I used a tsp. of baking powder and a half tsp. of baking soda.  I also stole an idea from a Spiced Banana Bread recipe and added cloves, nutmeg and because I had it, dried orange peel along with cinnamon.  Very easy to put together.  I think next time I will use a slightly smaller pan.

This recipe is excellent. I used four very ripe bananas because that’s what I had on my counter and it was delicious. My husband said it was the best banana bread I’d ever made. It was extremely moist and tasty.

So easy, I didn't have a loaf pan, baked it in a square baking pan and it still came out delicious and not at all flat because of pan being too large.

I would definitely make this again.  It was very moist and the color was excellent.  I threw some chopped pecans on the top and added a little cinnamon.  
The only thing I think I'll change for next time is skipping the salt.  Usually I don't have a problem with salt in baked goods, but this one turned out to be a little too much for my liking.

This recipe was great and incredibly simple. I tried testing at 45 minutes like some users suggested but it was way too soon for us. Kept checking and in the end, ended up keeping in for just over an hour. I think an hour is just right. I did make add chocolate chips and I used bread flour instead of all purpose because we ran out. Wish I had added some vanilla but it was delicious regardless.

Great recipe! Wanted a fluffier bread the second time I made it so instead of the baking soda I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I also topped it with a pecan crumb topping; 1/4 cup butter, 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar, 1/2 cup chopped pecans

I liked this recipe a lot! Great use for three overripe bananas. The bread was tasty and moist! It was a hair more savory than I like; when I make it next, I'll see how it works with just a half teaspoon of salt rather than a full teaspoon.

Omg! I usually hate banana bread so I just decided to make it for my family. My kids warned me by saying," mom dont you dislike banana bread ?and I replied yes ! I dont like it but I will try a tiny tiny piece just because I was making it.....
That tiny piece turned into 2 huge slices ! 

This was soo delicious that there were no pieces left I am going to make this again right now it was super easy to make I let the kids help out as well .

The only things I added to the recipe was TBS of ground cinnamon ,and a TBS of Dominican vanilla extract. ??????

To be honest my family literally ate the whole loaf as soon as I took it out of the oven!! I was asked to make more and stick to this recipe. The only change I made was adding additional egg whites.

Am going to make this today; however, thought I would copy/paste this info from a cooking site which relates to the controversy between using baking soda (as the recipe calls for) OR using baking powder....here is what the expert said:

"Baking soda is the classic ingredient that creates the quick leavening of baked goods such as banana bread. It's what gives the quick bread its fluffy and light texture. Baking soda produces just enough gas to form a bread that is not too dense or heavy, and requires no resting period to obtain the perfect loaf. It's an essential ingredient, but there are a few substitutes."

I am going to use baking soda as the recipe calls for.

I've been making this recipe for two years and it's by far my favorite! I do however only add 1/2 C of sugar because we don't like it quite so sweet. 
I also make it in a muffin pan to save time and mess when serving. They only take about 30-35 minutes to bake so it's quick and easy

So far, so good. I used half regular sugar, half brown sugar, and then half baking soda and half baking powder. I also added oatmeal, sunflower seeds, and chocolate chips. The outside has cooked to a dark brown color, and seems airy, but also moist. We'll see how it turns out after it fully cools. The color is beautiful, at least!

This banana bread came out so good! I read the reviews and followed the advice of many with adding baking powder. I also added some chocolate chips, a dash of cinnamon, and a teaspoon of organic coconut oil which helped make the banana bread so incredibly moist! I regret not making 2 since the one I made vanished so quickly

Totally easy and delicious.   I made it with my 6 year old daughter and she did most of the work.  The only thing I changed was adding a cup of walnuts at the very end.

I added walnuts, it took 1 1/2 hours to bake. I wanted to add a photo, but I don't see the option. It was yummy!

I made mine in mini bundt tins. It only took 15 minutes to bake. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and I’m glad I did because it would have been a little bland. I think the original recipe could use maybe more sugar or 1/4 cup of brown sugar or just put in the cinnamon like I did. I make a nice, light cake texture.

I was already well into making this bread when I seen a bunch of reviews stating it was dense and salty.  Everything was already all mixed up and I tossed a teaspoon of baking powder in just on case.  I also swapped the sugar for half a cup honey.  It turned out great,  light and fluffy and very moist.  I will make this again.

Wow!!! This was flavorful and moist. I didn't have a loaf pan so used a 9x9 pan. It makes for a more shallow bread and it cooked in right around 30 minutes (not the hour which would be for the loaf). Totally delicious and stillllll the best way to use those bananas that are getting a lil too ripe. Very easy- would recommend this one.

I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times in the bakery I work at and it's always gone within two days. Originally it was just a way to get rid of a damaged bag of flour and some rotting bananas, but it sells so fast I may just keep making it!

This was perfect. Now, I did change it slightly only because I had one extra banana than the recipe called for, 4. So I added 4 mashed bananas instead of 3. Other than that, I kept everything the same. It was easy, and oh so moist as well. 

I would highly recommend it to anyone.

This is the best banana recipe ever! I've followed this recipe to a tee and also by adding a banana and using margarine -- even adding nuts on occasion -- and it's always consistent,  delicious, and a big hit. When I make this banana bread it's gone the second it hits the counter.  It's so basic, you probably have everything to make it in your pantry right now.

Used 5 bananas and 2 cups of flour, 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup butter. 1 1/2 tsp baking soda. I loved that it didnt rise too much. It's nice and dense with baking soda instead of powder. Thanks Joy!

Didnt have any bking soda so i subbed with baking powder. Came out beautiful! Not as firm as i would have liked but wasnt crumbling either tho. Could be a bit sweeter so i will add a little more sugar next time and use bananas on the more ripe side (i used some past that were pretty brown) all in all it was a hit with my family and i will be making regularly. Thank you for the recipe!

Very moist and delicious! I followed some other suggestions and used 1/2 cup white sugar plus 1/2 cup brown sugar. Cut the salt in half, and used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. Since we live at altitude, we don’t add too much leavening. Baked for 1 hour and 5 minutes. Will definitely make again!

OMG! This was by far the BEST banana bread I’ve ever made! So moist, flavorful, and beautiful! I also made a few little changes.. added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp baking powder, and used half brown, and half white sugar. My husband ate it like it was going out of style! Thank you Joy! ????

Wonderful recipe! I started out making one loaf of this recipe and was asked to make another immediately. Then it was 2 loaves a week. I am now making at least 3 loaves 2 to 3 times a week. To say it goes fast is an major understatement! Usually I make it exactly as it is written but now & again I add walnuts. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I make this all the time for my daughter.  She loves it! It’s really easy and can be played with by adding additional ingredients (nuts, chocolate, peanut butter chips etc). I do add a little bit of baking powder to help get it to rise. I’ve used coconut sugar in place of the white sugar with success as well.

Made it exactly according to recipe and it turned out delicious! Perfect way to get rid of a few overly ripe bananas. Will make again for sure. I did substitute the flour in this recipe with 100% whole wheat flour, as that’s all I had on hand, and it tastes great!

I did make it and coming from this non-baker this was super easy to make and turned out perfect!  For the record tho, I have a slightly older oven and kept the bread in for 1 hour and 12 mins. The bread is super moist and yummy. I also added cinnamon on top just before I put it in the oven. Must make!

I rarely leave reviews but this bread was not only DELICIOUS but super easy to make! Very moist! My 9 year old made a loaf just a couple days later because the first one was gone immediately! We did not make any changes to the recipe.

One of the best feelings ever; Coming home to a bunch of over ripe bananas. I whipped out my phone and got straight to making this recipe. Midway through the bake time, the overwhelming smell of bananas wafted through the house. First bite, success!

Really great flavor! Just added 1/2 t cinnamon and some chopped walnuts (because grandma always did so). Turned out well. I may try the baking powder idea next time to get a bit more rise. I remember grandmas banana bread being more dense and moist, still trying to determine how to do that. But I like this recipe!

WARNING!!!! ...Over mixing this batter will be the kiss of death causing it NOT to rise (also, make sure your baking soda isn’t expired).  I just fold the flour mixture into the well blended wet ingredients. I gently turn the spatula just until the flour mixture is barely moistened. When I pour the batter into the pan, I even see a few little dry flour spots here and there. Don’t worry! The bread comes out amazing! This recipe is simple with everything I need right in my cupboard or fridge. If your short on time, throw the batter in muffin tins. It makes great muffins! I have tried so many banana bread recipes and now that I found this one, it’s my go to favorite.

I have tried many banana bread recipes.  Most of the time, the baking time and temperature were off, or the flavor wasn’t quite right.  This is mostly accurate, but I add five minutes onto the baking time.  I favor a traditional loaf pan, and this recipe is perfect for that.  My whole family will eat this, and I can double or triple the recipe and freeze the bread for future breakfast days.  The simplicity of this recipe is shocking after you’ve tried it, because it’s difficult to believe there wasn’t some “secret.”  Everyone I’ve shared it with has RAVED.  I highly recommend.

I made this yesterday, it was really easy and tastes wonderful. It's moist and has just the right amount of sweetness. I did sub 1/2 brown sugar for white sugar and added chopped walnuts, too. I doubled the recipe which was enough to fill 6 mini loaf pans. As other reviewers mentioned don't over mix the batter or it won't rise properly. This is a great recipe and a keeper for sure!

This tasted wonderful, my family loves it. I also tried it with 2 extra bananas, a handful of dark chocolate pieces, and a handful of dried cranberries.
I look forward to making many different banana bread variations in the near future.

Incredibly easy and moist bread. I made muffins, subbing coconut oil, sea salt, and 1/4 c. applesauce (For the egg). Half of the muffins, I threw in freshly diced pineapple, pecans, and topped with coconut flakes; other half added mini chocolate chips & pecans.

Absolutely delish. Thanks Joy.  Only used 2 bananas, 1/2 cup of sugar with a dash of baking powder and a dash of vanilla syrup.  Decorated it with pecans.  Amazing.

This is my go to banana bread recipe.  Too much salt though, I cut it down to a 1/2 t.  Super easy & I’ve made it with 2 to 4 bananas, it’s such a basic recipe you can play around with it.  Sometimes I add a little vanilla, nuts or spices and it always tastes yummy.  Never lasts more than a day in my house.

First time baking anything in SO LONG. Easiest ingredients to come by! I loved it, I melted the butter and used 4 bananas instead of 3, then added a little ground cinnamon to the top and it came out just fine. Wish it was a little more moist, but I didn't know how to make that happen, haha! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe, I really enjoyed the simplicity!

This is best receipe ever! Turns out every time- I use rice flour instead of wheat flour, which tends to make baking taste grainy and dry but not with this receipe. I love how simple and little ingredients it requires and yet taste so great! My kids don’t want me using any other receipe. This is definitely my go-to now!

This recipe and the final banana bread was improved when I added .5ml of good-quality vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, half a cup of toasted, chopped pecans and banana frosting. Took a tiny bit of time to roast the pecans (careful, they can burn easily) but otherwise was ready in a jiff. Outstanding and still very, very simple. Added vanilla and cinnamon to mashed bananas and added chopped nuts alternating with flour. Added sugar to butter (about half of it) and had no trouble combining ingredients. Doubling citrus in lemon frosting recipe added a nice tang.

Easy, great tasting, banana bread.  I've been making my grandma's recipe my whole life but I will probably use this one now.  Since my oven was already preheated, this recipe took less than 5 minutes tho put together and in the oven.   The bread taste awesome.   I did add pecans but nothing else changed.

I made this recipe because I happened to have all of the ingredients on hand, and it turned out pretty good! 

I really don't like changing recipes, but I thought there was way too much salt in the recipe. I added the full teaspoon, and maybe I didn't mix it thoroughly enough, but the bread actually tastes pretty salty to me? I would cut down on salt next time.

Also, it started to turn brown on the outside faster than it cooked on the inside, so I tented the loaf with aluminum foil at about 30 minutes.

This was good but a little dry on the outside and inside a bit. I was surprised because of the lower oven temp. I took it out at 50 min but would check at 35-40 min if I made it again. I also added 1 tsp of baking powder after reading the reviews. It still only filled the 9x5 pan about half-way up. I also did half white and half brown sugar and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Very easy recipe. UPDATE 2/8/18: Toasted with butter, as a reviewer suggested, is the way to go! YUM!

Delicious!  I used half the sugar (family preference), olive oil instead of butter, added chopped walnuts, and all whole wheat flour- it turned out great.  Very moist.  Took right at an hour to bake.

I know that some people don't appreciate reviews where the recipe isn't followed exactly but I wanted to chime in because I converted this to a vegan recipe.  I also used baking powder instead of soda like some other reviewers suggested.  Making it vegan was easy - just use ENERG Egg Replacer.  So the bread was a bit denser than I like but otherwise DELICIOUS!  Next time I will use 2 "eggs" instead of 1 to see how that works.

I hate to only give this 4 stars because I have been using this recipe for YEARS now! But true to the idea of rating the ORIGINAL recipe, this one was just a little too sweet for me, so I reduce the sugar 1/4 cup. Or as an alternative, you can try 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar (also adds a nice flavor)! Also, for a healthier (but too much!) version, I often use 3/4 cup white flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. Adding a tsp. of cinnamon also works nicely! Thanks Joy, for a truly easy go-to recipe my friends and family have enjoyed for years! ??

Is it just me, or did anyone else find the butter and egg wasn't enough liquid? I haven't actually baked it yet, but I don't know if that's going to be possible. Could it have to do with the fact I only used 2 bananas? That doesn't make any sense though.

My first bake ever since I've moved to a new apartment by myself. Turned out pretty good! Maybe a bit too sweet for my taste + maybe I should've used slightly lower temperature (or baked it for 50-55 minutes).

Best easy Banana Bread! I added some crushed walnuts. I actually didn’t have the right sized pan so I made a few muffins also. Baked for 40 minutes. Came out perfectly.

It's a great recipe! I added, 3/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. 
The only thing I would suggest is add nuts and 3/4 cup of the sugar!

I googled "what make 3 overripe  bananas" and up came this recipe. The instructions were clearly written and understandable and the ingredients are such that one could have "on-hand".  It was simple and the outcome was spectacular. I cut then wrapped individual slices. The bread was moist even after 4 days. This will now be a staple at Sunday dinner. I followed the directions with NO substitutions.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon and it turned out great! I’ve made this recipe twice and it was perfect both times. As other reviews mentioned, try not to over mix the batter. Also, I’ve found lining the pan with parchment paper is a great trick. The bread will pull right out of the pan without sticking to the pan or the parchment paper!

This was 5 stars for me, moist, flavourful, and sweet with a beautiful texture. I used thawed, previously frozen baking bananas and I made the following modifications to accommodate my diet: only 1/2 tsp salt; add 1 tsp vanilla; 1/2 honey and maple syrup in place of the sugar; 1/2 vegan margarine and coconut oil in place of butter. I will use this recipe from this day forward. Thanks so much!

When bananas are too ripe to eat. Just make banana bread instead of throwing them away!!! This was so easy to make...even made this while I made dinner the other night! Kids love it! The middle is somewhat gooey, although I love that aspect! Mine came out very dark brown. I may wrap foil over top next time. Thanks Joy

Listening to other reviewers, I used baking powder instead of baking soda and added extras: nutmeg, vanilla, and about half a cup of pecans.  I also added a splash of oil for extra moistness. The results were very tasty!

This is a lovely banana bread.  Moist and delicious.  I added A little cinnamon and a little vanilla.  It's also easy to tweak this recipe by adding chocolate chips walnuts almonds whatever you like. I also used half brown sugar half white sugar.  This will definitely be my go to recipe for banana bread.

Smelled like a dream, tasted super-moist and soft.  I did sub gluten-free flour as the husband has celiacs plus added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and baking power.  It was so easy and fun to make but I do like my banana breads to be more "bready."

So  I'd rate it 3 but my 13 year-old rated it a 5, hence the 4!

I made this bread following the directions exactly, and it turned out perfectly! It’s simple to make, but just as delicious as more complex bread recipes I’ve tried. It’s moist and very flavorful. My banana-holic husband gives it two thumbs up!

It was delicious and quite easy to manage. The only thing I would change is using less sugar. It was a bit too sweet for me.

LOVE this banana bread recipe! So simple and yummy. The only thing I would change is to add one more banana, without it you can't really taste the banana in it.

For as simple as it is, this deserves 5 stars.  I made it in about 10 minutes, then 45 minutes in the oven.  It turned out yummy!  What a great way to use over ripened bananas when you have little time and basic ingredients!  I will keep this on hand for future use.

Have made several times, everyone who tries it loves it. I can't get over how easy it is to make. Some times I have added chocolate chips to batter, my son loves it that way. This is the recipe for banana bread, period.

After reading all the reviews on this bread, I was hungry for it.  Made this tonight.  Absolutely one of the easiest recipes for banana bread that I've ever made. Absolutely delicious too!  Will add either strawberries or blueberries next time.

really good! as a college student, the simple ingredients make this recipe ideal. My roommate and I bake them in muffin tins for an easier on the go snack. I would also recommend adding a splash of vanilla for a little something extra :)

This banana bread turned out great! I substituted 1/2 cup almond flour for part of the regular flour. I also topped the bread with chopped walnuts, a dusting of cinnamon and brown sugar to make a slightly crunchy crust. Great texture, great flavor!

It is absolutely easy and quick. It is very delicious. I actually used a brownie pan. I didn't have a loaf pan. It cooked less time and it was perfect because I could cut little square pieces I also made some vanilla icing and drizzled it all over and used some walnuts too.. i cooked it for 28 min. That's all it took in my square brownie pan. I could of cooked it maybe 25 min.

I stirred in 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and used baking powder instead of baking soda, as one reviewer noted, and it rises perfectly every time.  Recipe is very easy and I've made it several times. It tastes equally amazing when made with whole wheat flour and brown sugar. Make sure your bananas are VERY RIPE - it makes for easier mashing and richer flavor. Recipe also makes 3 mini loaves which bake in just 45 minutes at same temp stated in recipe (325).

My family officially loves this - so much that I make it a few times a month! I’ve had to stop trying other recipes as they just don’t compare.    Substitution: brown sugar instead of white and sometimes I add an extra banana and/or double the butter for my husband’s preference.

I made this last night...I was a little skeptical because of not having baking powder and the issues with rising. It didn't make a difference...my family loved it!! I baked it in a loaf pan which took about an additional 20 mins. thats the only change. Super easy and really good!!!

I only had two bananas but decided to make this anyway.  Only changes were,as other reviewers had suggested, was to add cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg and less salt.  This turned out fantastic and hubby loves it! Super easy and next time I may add dried cranberries and or raisins!

I was looking for an alternative to some of the more decadent banana breads on Allrecipes, many of which are great, of course, but you don't always want to be using a cup of butter/sour cream/oil. Followed the recipe exactly and it's true that this bread doesn't rise much. But it's still pretty good -- tastes more bready than cakey. That is, not as moist, but still full flavour.

Easy and delicious!  I pretty much followed the recipe but I did modify as per some of the recommendations.  I did add a bit of vanilla extract and also some chopped pecans that I had on hand.  I also sprinkled the top with a bit of sugar and cinnamon.  It came out super moist.  Will definitely do again!

I added an extra banana only because I had it and didn't know what else to do with it.  It came out nice and moist. Fairly dense and with a spread of butter made for a perfect breakfast.

Just started experimenting with almond flour and made it as is with two exceptions - I did not have honey so I used agave  and my husband won't eat a dessert breat unless  it involves chocolate so I added 1 cup mini unsweetened chocolate chips 
Came out great  - this will be a go to when I have over ripe bananas. Thank you

Moist, delicious and easy.  I didn't have a loaf pan so I used a large muffin pan and cooked it about 10 degrees less and for about 40 minutes.  
I  added a little vanilla, cinnamon and walnuts this time so will let ya know!

It tastes good, but I've made it three times and it takes well over an hour to bake. It's really not worth it, and no matter how I swing the recipe it doesn't work out that way. It's insane.

Delicious and best of all-- extremely simple and not at all difficult to follow. I worked along most of the steps of this recipe, but I added in my own flair with a teaspoon of vanilla extract as well as a cup of chopped walnuts. Tasted great and my family all had second servings. Thank you, Joy!

Loved the simplicity.  I had apples on hand that needed to be eaten,  so I threw one of those in, too, with some cinnamon.   Will definitely keep this around.

Didn't make any changes about this recipe. But it was a little over cooked on the edges when I baked it for suggested baking time. But my friends loved it.

Super easy to make. I made two changes - I added chocolate semi sweet morsels (yum!) And I also cooked it in a glass pan, so I adjusted the  temperature to 300 instead of 325. Will make again!

I was looking for an easy banana bread recipe. This was my first time making banana bread from scratch. This recipe was so easy and delicious. I used 3 bananas and I had to bake an additional 5 minutes. The loaf pan I used was not quite 9x5. Otherwise, it came out great. I will definitely make this again!

So I made this banana bread because I had bananas ready to go. Next time I went to the grocery store, I bought overripe bananas so I could make it again!! I added coconut and mini chocolate chips (a handful, maybe 1/2 cup each) and it was out of this world!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Easy and delicious!!

I doubled the recipe and made muffins. It absolutely needs baking powder. Here is what I did, and these were THE best!!!!

3 c flour
7 bananas
4 tsp baking powder 
2 tsp baking soda
2 c sugar
2 eggs
1 stick of real butter
1 tsp salt
 I baked the muffins for 22 mins, and they were perfect!

Love this recipe! The only change I made was I didn't add salt! The one time I did, it all but covered up the sweetness! If I'm going to use a whole cup of sugar in one loaf of bread I want to taste it!

Overall not very healthy but easy and tasty. Used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white. Cut the sugar to 2/3 of a cup. Next time I'll try switching some of the butter for apple sauce or coconut oil.

I made a gluten free version based on Joy's recipe:
2 eggs, up from 1
Add 1tsp baking powder
Add 1tsp xanthum gum
Replace AP flour with 1/2c white sorghum flour, 1/2c glutinous rice four aka sweet rice, 1/2c gf baking mix.
(or your favorite 1for1 gf mix. Check for xanthum or agar. Leave out if already in mix!)

It turned out very tasty, and surprisingly like the simple banana bread from days of yore.

This is the best, very moist!  It is so quick and easy to make.   I did cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans.

It was good. I added chopped pecans and walnuts and dried cranberries. I think next time I would add less sugar. The only down fall is it took 1-1/2 hrs to cook throughly.

Fantastic recipe my whole family loves!! Simple to execute and perfect every time!! The only change I made was adding in chopped walnuts by folding it into the finished mixture before sticking it in the oven. Same cook time, and adds some extra texture!! Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe :)

Really easy and very delicious.  I don't keep a lot of different items in my pantry but the ingredients for this were basic.  Only thing I would do differently is bake a little less.  At 50 mins. it wasn't done and at 55 mins. it was overdone.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the instructions but added a tsp of baking powder as some other reviewers had mentioned. I also used sunflower oil instead of melted butter. The batter was very wet so I added about 1/2 cup of rolled oats. I sprinkled the top with chopped walnuts and more oats. It didn't cook all the way in the recommended time so I'll cook it at 350 next time.  Everyone loved it so I'll definitely make this recipe again.

This was my first time making banana bread, my mom does it from a box lol. It turned out prefect! Not too dense, moist, not to sweet. I added a dash of vanilla extract while mixing in the salt and I did have to put an aluminum foil tent on the over it and move it down a level for the last 25 mins but it's great. Also a trick I learned from my mom is to let the bread cool on its side, makes it easier to get out of the tin. I'll be doing this again soon.

This recipe was actually very easy to make. I made cupcakes instead to make it easier to snack on every day. My boyfriend and I loved it. I will try it with chocolate chips next time. Also, if you're thinking of making cupcakes, I would suggest removing it from the oven 5 minutes before the set time.

I love banana bread and have tried out a lot of recipes, and this was definitely one of the best. I try and make healthy additions to my baked goods and added oats and flax seed to this - I was worried that it would dry it out, but it was still moist on the inside with a slightly crispy surface. This is a great recipe on its own and I'll use it as a base if I want to experiment too.

I found this recipe while looking for something to do with overripe bananas.  It was easy as advertised even for someone with relatively little baking experience.  I added chocolate chips because everyone in the house thinks almost everything is better with chocolate in it.  It took about 10 minutes more than an hour to cook.  Even the 12-year-old, who sometimes has pretty high standards for food, loved it!

Great recipe! i added walnuts, used less sugar (was still a bit too sweet for me. i'll try 1/2 cup next time). i also only had 2 bananas, so i used 1 apple instead of the 3rd banana. and i added spices just because. and i only cooked it for 50 minutes, that was sufficient. came out yummy and moist, love lvoe love it!

Super easy and quick my only change is a little cinnamon and double vanilla to help the flavor in case the bananas are a bit overripe.

I added 1tsp baking powder, used 1 cup all purpose flour, half cup whole wheat flour, 1 scoop vegan protein powder,  4 bananas and only used 3/4 cup of sugar.  I also added a couple handfuls of chocolate chips as requested by my kids.  It's still very sweet, so you could add even less sugar. Rave reviews! An hour us way too long for muffins....check at 30 minutes and every few minutes afterwards.

I was looking for an easy banana bread to make and this was it! This was easy to whip up and used ingredients that I had readily available in my pantry/refrigerator. I did add in a little nutmeg and cinnamon but other than that kept the recipe as is! Very moist and everyone in my family loved it!

My 10 year old made this by herself and it was amazing! 
(As others suggested, she used baking powder instead of baking soda...and added a cup of chocolate chips).

Please see my changes on Facebook and I will make it again. I made it this evening and 1/3 is gone.

How can I find you on Facebook...here at Allrecipes there is only Joy showing. Probably to protect your ID.

I am going to double the recipe today and use powder instead of soda. We will see what happens.

I made it just as the recipe called. Turned out amazing and sooo easy!! I used a glass loaf pan, so it did take longer to bake at 325° I think next time I may cook at 350° and see if it cooks a bit faster. It took about an hour and 10min. Delicious and super easy! Will be making again!

I added brown sugar instead of white. I'd add less sugar next time. I also added 1tsp of vanilla extract. And perhaps slightly less salt next time too. I added  more bananas since I have LOTSA browning bananas- the best to make banana bread with! I took it out at 50 minutes too and it's nice and moist. I often leave banana bread in too long- an hour like it says but 50min was just fine.

Such simple recipe and so easy to make. Like the other reviewers have mentioned, i would use less sugar next time. Maybe 3/4 or 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup. I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it more moist. ????

I have tried several Banana Bread recipes, but this one by far is my favorite.  With every other recipe, I thought the Pillsbury Box mix was better and would go back to it.  But this one, I will make from now on.  Moist and great flavor.  Not too sweet.  It did take a long time to bake, longer than the time stated.  That might be my $6000 stove!  Sometimes you don't get what you pay for!

This was great. I added chocolate chips (Ghirardelli's semi sweet) to one half of the bread and that half was overly sweet, so if you add chocolate, I would suggest reducing sugar by 10-15%. I also added half a teaspoon of baking powder as other suggested. I didn't add cinnamon or vanilla, and wish I had.  It was done in 37 minutes in my very precise electric oven, so do keep a watchful eye on this.

This recipe baked perfectly! I read other people's suggestions about adding baking powder instead of baking soda, so not sure how it would have turned out if I followed it exactly. I also added pure vanilla extract.  I will definitely make this again, but with less sugar (maybe 1/2 or 2/3 cup) and add some nutmeg and cinnamon as well.

I followed the easy recipe exactly. I baked the loaf for 1 hour, tested with a toothpick, came out dry.  Placed on cooling rack and when cooled, sliced the lovely browned, toasty bread to find about 1/2 of the center of the loaf was raw.  Not sure at all what I did wrong.  My oven cooks at the proper temperature.  I rated it 2 stars as the taste(of the cooked part) was good and it's very simple to make.  Oh well, too bad. Back to my old banana bread recipe.

Easy.  Fast.  Moist.  Loved it.  I'm already thinking of ways to add things to it like nuts or fruit.
Great recipe.

The recipe was very easy. I did make one change;  I added crushed walnuts to it. My granddaughter said, " It's the bomb".  As soon as I have over riped bananas, I will make it again. My  family loved it.

Flavour was ok, but I found this too sweet. I even substituted less sweet coconut sugar for the cup of sugar in the recipe. Besides that, it went together quite quickly and easily and baked beautifully in an hour in a 325 degree convection oven. My husband thought it was good.

Before I go on to rave about this, I have one criticism. TOO MUCH SALT. OY!!! Cut it in half... OTHERWISE... I've made a lot of different banana bread recipes, and I will say this is what I expect banana bread to taste like! Bravo! 
Since I live over 6,500 feet in elevation, and I have a funky Mexican oven that wouldn't be able to keep an even temp even if it had a direct connection to God, I shy away from using just one pan, and split the batter between two 5x9 loaf pans. They were perfectly done in a little over 25 minutes. 
THIS is my new go to recipe for B bread. 
Oh... I threwin a handful of sliced almonds...

Followed this recipe almost to the letter, with a few substitutions: I used 1/4 cup of egg whites instead of one whole egg and 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of one teaspoon of baking soda, threw in a dash of cinnamon to the batter and topped with chopped raw almonds. Came out wonderfully after 55 minutes in the oven! Thanks everyone for your suggestions and thanks Joy for a great recipe!

Pretty much fool-proof.  I'm not a great baker because I seem to always forget something.  I made this with raw sugar which was coarser and darker, and only had Kosher salt which doesn't quite measure the same as table salt so I wondered how these would affect the outcome. I added the salt with the flour as I didn't notice that it should be added after the batter was mixed.  I got the pan in the oven when I realized I had left the butter in the microwave.  I added the butter to the batter in the pan and hoped for the best.  It came out great.

My first attempt at banana bread and it was a success...thanks to this recipe!  I didn't make any changes and the result was a light, fluffy banana bread that was absolutely delicious.  I appreciate the simplistic, everyday list of ingredients and the simple directions.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks, Joy!

Made banana nut bread this morning. I didn't shy away too much from this recipe only opting to add a splash of vanilla and chopped walnuts.  It turned out moist and delicious.  My family loved it.

I made it once with no changes, then I cut the salt in half and added an equal amount of baking powder to soda. This helped it rise. I cooked it closer to 55min rather than an hour, and that helped to keep it moist. All in all, a great recipe. Everyone in the house loved it. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Delicious! Will definitely be making this again. I used three very ripe bananas and I threw all the ingredients in the blender and added about a teaspoon of honey. I also sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top before putting in the oven. Very moist! Thank you!

This recipe was perfect as is. I had exactly three overripe bananas to use up. The ingredients were simple and on-hand. The result was moist and not too dense, and just sweet enough. Five stars for a basic classic! 
I'll try it with chocolate chips and walnuts next, maybe add a crumb topping. Honestly though, the plain version is already gone here. Yum!

A great go to recipe.  I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon and I used self rising flour.  And 1/2 cup of  chopped walnuts.   Otherwise I didn't make any changes.   It is delicious.  Next time I may also  try some vanilla.

I made this exactly as recipe is written. It was so darn easy and the bread is moist. I made one loaf with nuts. It was moist and tasty. I made one loaf without nuts. It turned out great but not as moist. I think the size and ripeness of the banana makes a huge difference. Either way the loaves were fantastic and just what I need for those over ripe bananas on my kitchen counter. I baked in my convection oven so I started testing for doneness after 45 minutes.

This was great! I had exactly three bananas. Here is where the confession begins: I added a little vanilla and cinnamon, and I used 1 c. whole wheat and 1/2 c. AP flour. I subbed some brown sugar for some white sugar and used a little less than it called for and found that I could have easily used 3/4 c. and it would have been plenty for us. I used 2 T. butter and 2 T. coconut oil. We all liked these a lot: they weren't so heavy and oily as some loaves but were still moist and fluffy (and we did use baking soda, as the recipe called for, and had no problems with the muffins rising). We made them into muffins and had a dozen. I wish we'd had more!! This recipe includes terrific proportions for using as a base (and would be delicious exactly as-is, too). Thanks!

I added walnuts and baking powder,  an extra egg,  and one more banana. I split it between two nine inch bread pans...  But it did not rise much so it likely would have fit in one. Mildly sweet.  Good with coffee or milk!

First time making anything a banana bread from scratch. Really easy, and quick to mix (we left out the nuts because we didn't have any). My 4 yr old daughter helped mix, and just the batter smelled so yummy! I did a double batch, my 3 yr old son added a slice of banana to the the top of each muffin, and I baked them as muffins (took about 25 - 30 minutes to bake). Just waiting for them to cool, then breakfast time! Smells great!

UPDATE:
Just tried 2 of them with Neufchatel Cheese and it was better than the Pillsbury Quick Bread!!!!!

One of my favorites. The cake came out so moist. My only suggestion is to know your oven if you are trying this or any recipe , I had to bake mine for only 45 minutes.  The first time I made it, it baked for 1 hour and it was dry. But , having said that wonderful banana bread, I make it at least once or twice a month!!

I use brown sugar instead of white. I haven't tried this recipe with white.
I also add chocolate chips or chocolate chunks.

I was feeling in the mood for banana bread a little while ago, and I stumbled across this recipe. It is amazing! It's light and fluffy and rich at the same time. The only thing was, to make the bread a little moister I usually add 1-2 tbs of honey. Other than that, this is a now a staple in my house.

This was so good and easy to make. I added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. Added cranberries to 1/4 and chocolate chip to 1/4 leaving 1/2 the cake plain. Will be making this again whenever I have ripe bananas.

Made a double batch and took the advice and added baking powder and the loaves rose beautifully. I also added a bit of  brown sugar and some semi sweet chocolate chips...let's just say that the loaves didn't make it long in my house!!  Yummy, will be making more this week!

We use baking powder instead of baking soda and add walnuts. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy yet delicious banana bread.

Very easy to follow. I used baking "powder" and no salt. However, I did add dark chocolate morsels and chopped pecans. In addition, if using a dark pan, check it's progress after 45 minutes. Mine was a little too brown after an hour. That said, I would encourage this recipe chosen as a definite "go to"! Thanks ;)

I made this recipe using same ingredients except i didn't have baking soda so I used 3 tsp of baking powder instead. I also omitted the salt because the butter in used was salted. I also threw in a handful of cashews. Will definitely make again, husband and kids loved it!! Very moist too I forgot to mention. ?

I made this as muffins, not bread, and added about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Made the recipe exactly as is, and it was fantastic.  Muffin cooking time was 25-30 mins.

Also, made muffins instead of bread.
Baked for half an hour.

This is a great base for making banana bread. Loved how it turned out. The only differences i made was 4 mashed bananas, 1 tsp baking powder and a handful of cashews. Might try a little vanilla extract next time:)

I made this recipe multiple times and it's always perfect. Not too sweet!  My in-laws and family devoured them in a week! I think I made about 8 batches! Instead of bread I made cupcakes and added chopped walnuts and raisins in some of them.

This is great! Used three large very ripe bananas and because of their natural sweetness due to ripeness, reduced sugar to 2/3cup. Think it could even have been less! 
Used baking soda from my fridge. (No, it doesn't affect the taste) and omitted salt. Will definitely be using this again. So moist! Maybe will ad nuts of some sort next time!

Made this with a couple changes. I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I didn't have a loaf pan so I used a glass 8x12 pan and baked in my toaster over. It only took 40 minutes. It is so moist and delicious. The top was s little dark but the taste was perfect.

Turned out perfect, and tastes great! I've made this recipe 3 times. The first loaf I made, I forgot to add the butter and it still came out delicious! Takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake (unless your bread pan is on the larger side, then maybe less time).

Super simple recipe that made for a very tasty snack!! I had enough bananas for 2 loaves but didn't have enough white sugar, so I substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for each loaf and it was delicious! Thanks Joy!

This is going to be my new go-to banana bread recipe.  Simple, yet very moist and delicious.  I only used 2/3 cup of sugar and it was still sweet enough.  I also used canola oil instead of butter.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was perfect.  I love how simple it is and just as good if not better than recipes with more ingredients.  Thanks for sharing, Joy.

Updated: I tried this a second time with fresh ripe bananas. It still takes much longer to bake than the recipe states, but it rose nicely, and made a dense and tasty bread.

Just got done baking this for my aunt's birthday dinner and it turned out A-OK!  My family loved it!  I substituted the baking soda with double acting baking powder to make the bread rise. Also, I used packed brown sugar instead of white.  The end result was great and my loaf definitely rose to the ocassion.  The top turned out crunchy which was really good though 1 hour bake time was not enough for my oven so I cooked it for another 5mins. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did the same as some others and switched out the baking soda for baking powder and then made them as muffins instead of bread and added chocolate chips. They were great and so easy to make. I had another banana bread recipie that I never used because it was too complex. I can see me using this every time my bananas start getting old. Or even when they don't!!

I made it today, I added some nut to make some Banana Nut French Toast  for my 9 yrs old son. I was really pleased at the outcome of the bread and the french toast, I sure wish I hadn't broke my phone because it deserved a picture and a post. Lol.. Thanks Joy.

I had 4 bananas that were so overripe, I HAD to find something to do with them.  I have a couple other recipes, but I wanted something that was quick and easy, and this is it!  It literally took me 5 minutes to prepare... I was ready before the over preheated!

So, I did use 4 instead of 3 bananas...  I also added 1/2c of raisins (because I like them) as well as added 1/4t of almond extract.

This is so delicious, that nearly the entire loaf was gone before lunchtime... I will for sure make this one again.

Very easy and I had all ingredients on hand. I used 3/4 tsp salt but it was a bit much so I'd use even less next time. I used 3/4 cup sugar per reviews but I should've used the full cup. I wish it would've raised some more. It's a good basic recipe and I'd definitely make again, adding some raisins or even chocolate chips. My overly picky 3 year old eats this up so I'm really happy with this recipe.

I made two batches: one regular loaf and one converted to muffins! To each one I did add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and used brown sugar instead of white. Unfortunately, I forgot the baking soda in the loaf so it turned out rather flat, oops!  The muffins were baked at 325 for 30 mins, but were a tad overdone, so I'll bake them for 25 mins next time. Everything turned out very well otherwise! Love it!

My favorite recipe I have found on here I lost track of how many times I have made this. Now I used it as a great jumping off point and make a ton of tweaks now for fun. Never had an issue. I add walnuts or chocolate chips on the top. Sometimes I reduced the sugar by a 1/3 cup and substitute cocoa powder for a yummy chocolate banana loaf. I have tried using  2 1/2 bananas (dropped a half on accident) still came out great. I love trading the sugar out for light brown sugar. If you substitute baking powder for baking soda it helps it rise more but I find the flavor a little more bland. Toss in a teaspoon of vanilla or molasses for a yummy extra flavor. I have forgotten the salt all the time and it still comes out great.

Really easy recipe. I only had 2 ripe bananas, so I used half an unripe one. Came out very well but a little less sweet and less moist than other recipes I've used. That may have been due to the lack of bananas so I'll take them blame. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I cut back on the sugar the second time because it was to sweet, but other than that it was delicious! My family loves this and I've been making it probably too often.

I have never made banana bread.  I had my 10 year old daughter make the banana bread, while I supervised her. It was so easy for her, as it was her first time making it.  Unsure of the of what to expect, it came out so delicious.

I did not include the butter and I substituted the exact same amount of flour for whole wheat flour. I also added chopped walnuts. It came out perfectly. After about 25 minutes I turned the heat down to 300 and then checked it every 10 minutes with a toothpick.

The best thing I can say is that my grandson  Sebastian loves it! I have made it several times and will continue making it for family and friends. The only change that  I made is that I switched  the white sugar for brown sugar.  Love it!

I only had two overly ripe bananas, so that is what I used. Used baking powder instead of baking soda because another reviewer suggested that change. Added about 1/2 cup chopped pecans because i had some left from Christmas baking. Hubby said it was the best I ever made!

One of my intentions for the new year is to not waste food.  I had six very wipe bananas on hand so I decided  to make banana bread.  This recipe led to the best banana bread I've ever made!   I took a few of the other reviewers' suggestions and added a bit of brown sugar, pecans, and a dash of vanilla.   So yummy!

This receipe is simple, easy and tasty! In my oven, it took 1 hour and 14 minutes to bake. Falls apart easily when sliced.

Easy and yummy!  Made it twice this week because it just gets gobbled up fast.  If you follow the recipe there is no after taste of baking powder.

I added chocolate chips to it.  I know some would add nuts but we have a child with food allergies.  Chocolate works just as well.  She didn't complain LOL

Perfectly moist and SOO delicious. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a 1/4-1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and halved the salt to 1/2 tsp (only because the only butter I had was already salted). My husband couldn't stop raving about it!

Super easy and quick and loved that the banana shone through. Yummy!! I slightly browned the butter on the stove when I melted it and next time I will use a little less sugar but that is a personal preference. Great recipe. Thanks!

First attempt at banana bread and it was a delicious success! Only change is I followed other reviewers and added a dash of vanilla. I also made muffins instead of a loaf, did same temp for about 30 minutes and they are perfect!

The first time I made just as the recipe called. I thought it was great just a little too sweet. The second time I made it with  two large bananas and cut the sugar back to about 3/4 of a cup and it was even better. I made muffins instead of a loaf.

Kids loved it. Had to bake it a little longer than the suggested time until butter knife came out clean though. Most successful Banana bread I've made thus far.

Turned out great. I put a streusel topping on it but it would have been really good without it. Made one large loaf. Used self rising flour because it's all I had and omitted the baking soda. Fairly sweet, I'm going to cut the sugar next time and see how it turns out. Will make again, maybe with nuts too.
