Delicious! No wok - still turned out great. I browned the chicken in batches, then the peppers and added green onions when combined. I doubled everything so I would have leftovers. Served over white rice. Quick & easy - great for a weeknight dinner.

This is a very simple and easy recipe that tastes great! I like to add peppers, mushrooms, and water chestnuts or swap out the green onion for red or sweet... whatever I have on-hand.  It's always turned out great.

I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised to read so many positive reviews.  My wife and I found it to be bland and without much flavor.  We had to add a lot of seasonings at the table to give it any flavor at all.  Very disappointed.  Won't make it again.

I used a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks and it was delicious! Next time I will use a can of pineapple “tidbits” instead of chunks just so the pieces are smaller. GREAT, simple, delicious weeknight meal!

Instead of breast I used thighs, which is more flavorful to me. I made fried rice and broccoli.

We don't eat peppers, so I used plain white onion instead. Also, no paprika. Still turned out great! My 3 year old even loved it.

I enjoyed making this meal for my family. My suggestion is 2 lbs of chicken, this is great for left overs. Very easy to make. I also used more pineapple, because I love pineapple! I will definitely make this recipe again.

No changes. We loved it! Great for a summer's evening when the weather is hot.

However I may try it with other fruit and will let you know how it turns out.

This was very good and very easy. Not a lot of ingredients (and nothing exotic) and you can do all of the prep before you start to cook.  The cook times given were also right on the money.  Might just add a little cayenne or pepper flakes next time.

Good quick meal. Good flavor. I served  over  white rice.
  I Will make again. I have ordered  pineapple  chicken  in restaurants.  This tastes similar but is missing something. I think it's the chicken  not being grilled first  so I will try that next time. However it's still a good quick meal that's  light and healthy.

Easy to make, even easier to eat. Will definitely be making it again. We used red bell pepper and served over rice. It was pretty delicious. I added a dash of red pepper flakes for added kick for that sweet heat. Mmm mmm good

This is a great dish to experiment with.  You can't go wrong here. I used yellow and red bell peppers instead of scallions.  I also used fresh two pineapples. Great presentation!  She will love this dinner that you prepared.

Positives, an quick and easy dish.  Everything came together easily. I only had a 20 oz pineapple tidbit, but I think chunks would be better, as the tidbits were in every bite. I used a yellow onion, which worked fine. I also believe adding a bit more red pepper, and broccoli would zip up the dish, as I found it a bit bland.

I made this recipe exactly as it was given. We absolutely loved this. It was pretty easy to make and didn’t take a lot of work at all. 
It had a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. We served this over rice with broccoli on the side. 
This will now be one of our favorite meals to make.

I tried this because of the great reviews. I followed the recipe but added a little garlic powder and black pepper. We still found it bland and didn’t have enough sauce. It might have been better had I doubled or tripled the sauce.

Really quick and easy.  I used a leek instead of scallions, so the onion was a little more subdued.  I might throw in a jalapeno or two next time to spice it up a bit.

Great, easy recipe. I did add about 2 tbsp hoisin sauce, sliced Bella mushrooms & Cheyenne pepper for a kick. Served over basmati rice with a side of steamed broccoli. Delicious!

I doubled the recipe except I only used 1 bunch of scallions and used a 20 oz can of Pineapple tidbits.  It says salt to taste- I added 1/4 tsp salt but I don't think it is needed (there is a lot of salt in soy sauce).   Some reviewers said it wasn't sweet enough and someone added brown sugar.  I added 1/2 Tbsp of brown sugar to the pineapple juice and it tasted great.

This was FANTASTIC! The only thing I did differently was I added some sliced green and orange peppers to the mix, mostly just because I wanted to use them up before they went bad. I served it over rice and the fam LOVED it! Will definitely add this in as a regular part of the rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was surprisingly bland. I ended up putting sriracha on it to make up for the blandness. Wasn’t an awful recipe by any means, but definitely won’t be a go-to for me.

This is the way to go if you're looking to blend sweet/savory AND have something that's easy to cook on a weeknight.  I made this with twice the paprika and added red pepper flakes to balance the sweetness of pineapple and the saltiness of soy sauce.

Was very good. Don't use the cream of mushroom soup for this one.  I did use the sherry after sautéing the peppers and added some shallots . The sherry was used to deglaze the pan.

Used 20 Oz. tin of Pineapple instead of 12 Oz. by mistake, (adjusted cornstarch to match proportion) no complaint on amount of pineapple and sauce this caused.  Excellent color and flavor.

Yum!  Very quick, easy and healthy. I increased the pineapple to 2 cans because we love pineapple plus I knew one can wouldn’t provide enough juice to make enough sauce. So I increased the cornstarch as well. Also, at the end it seemed to lack something so I added 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and that kicked it up a notch.  This will be in my dinner rotation for sure!

I read the reviews. I added grated ginger to my marinade. I also cooked my scallions before the peppers because I like my onions more well done. I served it over  jasmine rice. Very good. Will make again. My husband liked it very much. Next time I might also add some bok choy and stir fry it as well.

Made for the 2nd time last night. Made a double batch, (wanting left overs for lunches). Husband says it's better than restaurant.  It is!  We both really love this dish. You can pre-prep  everything and when time comes it all comes together quickly and the whole house smells wonderful. lol, my husband likes to watch me cook it;  just keeps saying: it smells so good. :)   Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

The only changes I made...coconut oil, frozen 3-pepper blend & diced onion mixture( I fix a lot of variations of stir-fry cauliflower so that's easier to keep on hand.) I think will use pineapple tidbits instead of chunks next time.

I followed the directions exactly--except for adding a sprinkle of ginger powder and a garlic clove to the soy sauce marinade. My 4 kids, my husband and I all loved it. SO easy, minimal ingredients and fast--my favorite kind of recipe!

I would have given this five stars,  it husband was not crazy about it. Easy to make, good mix of flavors. I added cashews, kept thinking it needed broccoli. Will make again and add broccoli.

Made this tonight, and will make it again! However,  to give it some nice flair, I'm adding sweet chili sauce to the pineapple juice next time, and throwing in some red onions for color, crispness, and a little extra flavor next time.

I added red pepper flakes because we like some heat.  I also added some brown sugar which made it perfect. It was easy enough.  I made 5 pounds of chicken and should have done the chicken and then added the pepper and green onion because the red pepper was very soft.

Excellent recipe, better than my usual sweet and sour Chinese recipe.  Fewer steps and ingredients are flexible.  I used regular sweet onion, green peppers, jalapeños, and pineapple. Great taste and so easy!

I used a large stainless steel skillet and served it over white rice that was cooked with a garlic oil base. It was delicious.

I made a similar dish but the chicken was crispy and I must admit, I liked that way better. But this is still good and MUCH faster to make!!
