These turkey burgers were simple to put together and very tasty.  I liked the carmelized onion flavor that came from browning the onions first instead of putting them in the burgers raw.  There wasn't one particular flavor that stood out in these burgers - all the flavors combined just gave them a nice taste without being overpowering.  They definitely were very moist!

Great recipe! Very flavorful and moist. I added a teaspoon each of dried parsley & paprika to give the burgers a bit of color. Also caramelized the onions. It

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/230324/moist-turkey-burgers/ ... These were good, really good; & yes, moist; nearly moist like a beef burger.  I pretty much 2/3rds this, but  didn't change the ratios too much.  (2#mixed turkey, 1 1/2c onions, 1/2c breadcrumbs, 1T worcestershire, 1T dijon mustard, 3cl garlic, 1t poultry seasoning, 3/4t dry mustard)  I panfried these.  They even browned like beef burgers - meaning got crispy dark places.  Adding those cooked onions is a good trick - especially with turkey - & if you're using allwhite (which I don't recommend for burgers).  Turkey can be dry & flavorless, but this recipe is worth keeping.  Thanks!  One more thing:  These are some big burgers; 9 from 2#.  I suppose quarter pound is usual, but I'll make 'em smaller next time.  Very filling.

This was one of the best turkey burger recipes I have made. I try not to make changes, but I didn't have poultry seasoning. I had something suitable for fish or chicken, so I used that, and added chopped red pepper for a little more flavor and moisture.
 They remained moist and held together - I don't like adding eggs, as it turns out like a meatloaf, in my opinion.
Overall they were very good and I will make again.

These really are fantastic. I have made them twice, once in a frying pan and once on a grill outside. They do taste like a juicy beef burger. Somehow the mix of spices, garlic and sauteed onions come together to make the flavor very similar.
I made no changes to the recipe. This is now my favorite ground turkey recipe.

One of my fave meals to make for my family. I usually throw an egg or two in to help keep it all together.

This recipe was by far the BEST turkey burger I've made and eaten! I was skeptical since most of these recipes turn out dry. This one is not. I did a half recipe and instead of fresh bread, I did panko breadcrumbs. I cooked them on a cast iron griddle. The result...juicy, amazing burgers. I was worried when I flipped them that they were going to fall apart as they seemed to not be bound enough. Despite this, they held up and tasted wonderful! Thanks for the recipe.
