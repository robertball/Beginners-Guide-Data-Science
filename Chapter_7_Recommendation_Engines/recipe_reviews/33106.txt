Pretty good! I ground down the oats to a finer consistancy in my blender and omitted the cinnamon this time around. No cream of tartar so I just upped the baking powder to a tsp. and used a half tsp. of baking soda. I did combine the dry ingredients first, wisked them to combine them and eliminate most lumps, then combined the wet and gently stirred the batter until just combined. Because pancake batter using oats can be a little wet at first, I let it sit for fifteen minutes while my griddle preheated and it was perfect. Good stuff! Next time, I'd like to use butter, real buttermilk instead of water and milk powder and add blueberries. NOTE: One batch of this recipe got me ten pancakes, using my 1/3 c. measuring cup for even pancakes.

We loved this recipe.  I mixed up the dry ingredients and gave them as gifts to my daughter's teachers along with a recipe card to tell them which wet ingredients to add.  I did find that the salt was excessive.  The recipe says "1 1/4 tsp, divided" but doesn't tell you what kind of division to do.  I added the full 1 1/4 t. to the batch I made for my family, and they turned out a little too salty.  I scaled it back to 3/4 t. and that was MUCH better.

This was yummy! I did not have milk powder so I used milk instead of water and added about a tbsp of plain yogurt instead of the cream of tartar. The pancakes were very hearty and delicious.

I was looking for a pancake recipe to make gift jars for breakfast baskets to give at Christmas... I tried this initially to see if I liked it enough to give away, and it was good, but a bit too heavy for my taste.  I changed the original recipe a bit... I used one cup of white flour(eliminating the wheat flour entirely), reduced the salt to 1 tsp, and reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp as well.  I had rave reviews and half my family and friends requested the recipe for themselves... (the other half probably haven't tried it yet ;o) These are a hearty, delicious pancake!  For a twist I also added chopped apple to the batter, which my finicky 2 year old granddaughter LOVED!  Thanks for the recipe!!!  Definitely worth a try.

These pancakes live up to their name!  I substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for the oil and it worked great!  Very delicious and very filling!  And with the applesauce they are low in fat too!

These are the best pancakes ever. I use whole wheat flour in the entire recipe, and add a little more cinnamon and also blueberrys. Yummy! My husband and I enjoy them on the weekends for breakfast.

I did as the other reviewers mentioned and increased the baking powder to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp baking soda.  I also did not have dry milk so I used 1/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup water.  NOTE * AUTHOR SAYS TO USE A TABLESPOONS OF BAKING POWDER AND CINNAMON - THESE SHOULD BE TEASPOONS!  My eight year old loved these pancakes!!!!  You almost did not need the syrup other than for the moisture because they are so delicious!  Next time I will use fresh fruit and yogurt as a topping instead of the syrup.

I printed this out with the intention of making gifts out of them.  It just barely fit into a one pint canning jar (tamped it on the counter!).  I then mixed up a batch to test, and I have to say, they smelled great when they were cooking.  I did not, however, care for the texture.  It was kind of crunchy from the oatmeal!  I prefer a different batter.  I won't be using this for gifts.

This is a great twist on the classic pancake recipe that can get old fast :) I love the texture the oatmeal imparts, yet they still stay light and fluffy. My kids and I love them! Thanks!

Did not care for these. The flavor was only so-so. They were heavy & tough. I guess that is to be expected since it is made with wheat flour & oats. Way too much cinnamon. Oh, well. On to the next recipe! :)

Absolutely delicious and great recipe! I actually used honey and molasses instead of sugar, applesauce instead of oil and added chopped raw almonds and blueberries.

I actually made this with no milk, fake eggs, and splenda brown sugar and they tasted fantastic!  A great recipe for healthier modifications.  Thanks.

Very yummy! Used all whole wheat flour & added some cinn & Splenda. The baking powder measurement was confusing-3/4 of a tbsp is hard to measure! But I ended up using around 2 1/2 tsp. Very nice & fluffy-thanks!

The pancakes really are delicious. At the suggestion of another reviewer I reduced the salt, and I'm glad I did! I only use about 1/2 tsp.

I don't understand how this recipe has a 4.5 rating.... I admit I didn't follow the recipe exactly, so that may be it, although I don't think my changes would have impacted it that much. These had a strange salty taste, and definitely not sweet enough.  Also, I wasn't a fan of the texture...even though I ground up the oatmeal, it was still just too grainy for me. My changes: I didn't have cream of tarter, so I increased the baking power to 1 T.  I also didn't have milk powder, so I just omitted that and the water and used (almond) milk instead.  Smelled good cooking, but I almost spit out my first bite.  Disappointed.

DELICIOUS indeed!  They are just the right amount of sweet and savory with a little bit of a "homegrown" flavor. The batter is dense without being rich and the texture of the multiple flours is wonderful. I was worried the cinnamon would be too much but it in no way is overstated. Used 1/4 teaspoon of lemon juice instead of cream of tartar and they still turned out great. Because I used whole rolled oats I finished the batter and THEN preheated the pan to let the batter set up. If I had to change anything then I would use a little less salt, but otherwise it WAS delicious!

WOW!!! I REALLY like this recipe. Easy and out of this world taste, I won't make any other recipe again. I did not have powdered milk so I used butter milk instead of water and the powdered milk.

These were seriously good. I used all wheat flour and substituted 1 cup of fat-free milk with 2 tbsp of melted butter for the powdered milk and 1 cup of water. I don't usually like pancakes but these are now my favorite. =)

This was great for a few reasons. We like to add fruit to any pancakes we make so I added chopped apple and raisins as I thought that would compliment the oatmeal texture. I doubled the recipe to have some the next day for breakfast and found that not only do they reheat very well but they are also delicious as a cookie-type snack when eaten cold. Great breakfast on the run :)

I made the recipe as is but only 1 tsp of salt. They are very good. For my kids I added a mashed banana to it.  Even my daughter's very picky eater friend loved it and went back for seconds. This is a good substantial breakfast with the oats and banana.

I make this recipe literally every weekend and store for the rest of the week and it is the BEST! I've made the recipe as is, subbed ground flax for eggs, apple sauce for oil, banana for sugar, almond meal for flour, added super grains; basically no matter how I adapt this recipe it turns out. I don't have cream of tartar or dried milk though, so I always just use 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2  tsp baking soda, and 1 cup milk (instead of water). It's a favorite with the kiddo and the hubby too. Thanks for the solid, super versatile, recipe!

This was delicious! I tweaked it a bit tho... I used black strap molasses in place of the brown sugar, used 1/2 tbs of baking powder and used raw whole milk in place of the powder and water. So good!

Thias is our go-to weekend pancake recipe. Hearty and delicious, the recipe needs no modifications. My family eats them up and does not leave leftovers! This recipe makes about 8 pancakes.

Fantastic, light and fluffy!  The flavor is amazing.  This one will go into my regular rotation.  I love that its healthy, too!  Some reviewers have suggested that the tablespoon measurement should be teaspoon, but I made it as originally written and it worked out perfectly.  I did let it sit for just over 5 minutes before cooking to allow the oatmeal to soak up the moisture.   Changes I made: I substituted 1 cup milk for the milk powder/ water (didn't have any milk powder) and I omitted the salt and cinnamon completely for our personal taste.   Thank you for such a great recipe!

Absolutely one of the best!  I used 1/2 c. milk, 1/2 water instead of milk powder, 1 tsp b.powder and the cream of tartar it called for.  I did run the oats through my processor really quickly and I added blueberries to the mix.  I will try this with buttermilk next time but it was delicious just the way it is.

These were very good,I followed the advice of one teaspoon of cinnamon  ( I used Vietnamese Cinnamon which is stronger) and baking powder. I thought the batter was a bit thick so I added 3 tablespoons maple syrup.

This is probably one of the best oatmeal pancake recipes on this site. Although I did not use the cream of tartar and I didn't have whole wheat flour (I just used all-purpose white flour), it was relish. I will not look at any more oatmeal pancakes anymore!

This is a new family favorite!!!  I will definitely be using this as a gift idea for Christmas this year. I doubled the recipe, as we have a large family, used 1c.buttermilk instead of the water and milk powder, and I also subtitued 1c. oat bran for the 2c. quick cooking oats.  Fabulous pancakes!  I have tried a lot of recipes for homemade pancakes.  I now need to look no farther. :)

These are my family's favorite pancakes!  We even love making enough for leftovers to toast for snacks! Very hearty and even the littlest ones love them.  Thanks for a great recipe!
