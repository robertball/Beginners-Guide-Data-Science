This was actually a very simple tasty recipe. Essentially it is custard with coconut on top because that is where it migrates to in the cooking process. Everyone I fed it to liked it. Not fancy just simple.

This was not good. It was easy to whip up and bake but something is not quite right about this one.

This yummy custard pie got rave reviews at my Gourmet Ladies luncheon. It is beyond easy. It is good just like it is but it also makes a perfect base for drizzling your favorite fruit sauce bourbon sauce caramel or lemony sauce over it.
