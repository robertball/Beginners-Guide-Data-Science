This is a great recipe.  The favor is light and good.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of basil (the taste is sweeter).  I made my own chicken stock (see all recipes).  Because I made my own stock, I added 1 teaspoon of salt.  My family loves this recipe!

GREAT recipe. I also make my own chicken broth so I added a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning. Because I was taking this to a soup & bread meal I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for feeding a crowd of hungry Lutherans! Thanks for sharing!

I've made a resolution to stop wasting so much food this year. We had chicken and rice for dinner so a quick search led me to this recipe to use the leftovers in. The soup looks and smells great and was so quick and easy to make being the chicken was pre-cooked. Some quick packaging in mason jars will make for tasty grab and go work lunches this week. Thanks for a great recipe!

Used this as the basis for a pot of "gotta use what I got in the pantry" soup for my ailing mother, who said, "We'll not be buying chicken and rice soup anymore - this is MUCH better than any can!"  Not much more to say, is there?  Thanks for the recipe AND for helping to make my mom feel a bit better!

I have to say that the ingredients in this recipe are so easy that I really thought that it would end up being just blah like the hundreds of other chicken soup recipes that I've tried that never taste just quite right.  This was really good though, even my kids liked it which is a miracle!  Nice flavor that wasn't too much of this or that and it seems to be a great base if you want to add other stuff to your preference as well.  I love that it has simple pronounceable ingredients so that it can be all organic if you so choose.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is delicious and healthy.  I make my own broth boiling the chicken in water and adding onion, celery, and fresh thyme sprigs.  I strain the broth for use in this soup.  I added l lb. chicken (boneless breasts) and 3 cups rice because we like more of both.  I used fresh bay leaves (3 instead of 1).  I also added 1/2 tsp ground sea salt because I felt the flavors needed to stand out more.  This is light enough for a fresh summer meal, as well as a cold winter night.  Enjoy... and thanks for the recipe!!!

Recipe as is was ok. Rice would be bland if made separately and added after. Also, way too much rice. 

Changes - make own chicken stock and pull any extra meat off of the bones and add that to the soup as well. Cook rice in the pot instead of separately and use half as much.

Agree - this soup is delicious.  Lots of recipes call for lemon in chicken soup, the lime was a first for me - and I loved the taste.  I used a fresh lime and didn't measure, just squeezed the juice from the whole thing into the soup.  Realized it provides a "salt" aspect which was good b/c I used low sodium chicken broth.  It was fast to make because I used boxes of Swanson chicken broth, chicken breast strips, pre-chopped celery and onion in a container from supermarket - and 3 of those little cups of Minute Rice (2 white and one medley) - very little work other than cubing the chicken, dicing carrots and microwaving the rice and putting everything together.  Cheating but it made a quick delicious meal.

Quick and easy, Perfect for when everyone starts getting the colds and the weather starts to turn yucky. If you double the recipe, it feeds a family of 5 with enough for everyone to have seconds and some for lunch the next day. Very tasty!

I like this soup because it is really healthy - all the ingredients are organic (it is difficult to buy not organic rice or onion), it is fast and delicious.
I recommend this soup for everybody who likes healthy and tasty food!

I followed the advice of others.  I added a teaspoon of cumin, 3 sprigs of rosemary, and some garlic powder.  I'm not a fan of pepper so I omitted that.  I will defiantly make this again.  I didn't have any lime so I omitted that too.  I've worked hard to try omitting salt from my diet so I was happy with the outcome, the hubby added some salt to his.

Very traditional and delicious soup! I made this for my husband who has a cold, I added a half hot pepper, no seeds, to add a little bit of a kick to kick out that cold! Very good soup!

I made if or a large group of people and it went over very well. I used rotisserie chicken to save time, added more rice and extra chicken bouillon to modify for personal taste.

This is a really good soup and very simple to make. I did add  another 2/3 cup of rice to make a little thicker. The Lime juice really makes it pop!   I did saute the vegetables first but other than that, I followed the recipe.

We used fresh lemon juice instead of lime, because that was why we had on hand, and we omitted the parsley because we didn't have that either.  Delicious, filling, nourishing!

I hate to be a party pooper, but this recipe did not live up to my great expectations based on the reviews. I followed it exactly for 4 servings, except adding a cup of hot water since chicken broth is usually only sold in 32oz cartons, which is 4 cups, and recipe asked for 5 cups or 40oz. I just considered it a low sodium option and added a bit more salt, rice, and veggies to compensate. I used rainbow carrots which made the soup pink because of the purple carrots, but I don't think my changes were drastic enough to mask the core flavor of the soup which should have stood out to me right away. I thought it strange that the recipe didn't even indicate adding "salt and pepper to taste," which rendered it bland and utterly tasteless. I added some Indian cayenne and lots of garlic salt and pepper and it was still just ok. I thought the lime was overpowering so took out the slices of garnish. I've had pho so it reminded me of a wipipo version of that which was strange. I've been making tons of recipes from Allrecipes, but I was actually embarrassed to share my soup with anyone this time. Anyway, just wanted to give my honest opinion.

I really like this. I cooked the chicken a good while in the broth before adding the onion, carrots, and celery. Didn’t measure the rice but cooked it before adding to soup. Next time I might taste it before deciding whether to put in lime juice. Even though I didn’t have any parsley, it was still very good.

This is the best chicken soup I have ever made! Everyone loved it. The lime adds a depth of flavor that other chicken soups just do not have. The recipe is also fast and easy. It is perfect for a sick day or a weeknight or a chilly, rainy day.

This is a go-meal now!  It is so fast to put together, and really good!  I add different veggies, green beans, zucchini, depending on what I have.  I do not add the rice until serving.  There are usually leftovers and the rice gets mushy...so I just add it to each serving.

Pretty good! I ended up modifying it a bit though. I added more carrots and celery, and I used 5 cups of veggie broth (ran out of chicken broth after cup 5). Since I let it simmer for about an hour, I also added about 6 cups of water. All in all, very tasty!

I love this soup! I only had 8 cups of broth so I added 2 cups of water and a chicken bouillon cube. It was perfect. The lime juice adds wonderfully to the flavour. I will definitely make again!

Had to add three packets of sodium free chicken bouillon to up the chicken flavor.  Very bland otherwise.

Great recipe.  I substituted roasted chicken and put uncooked wild rice in to cook with the soup.  Everyone in the family liked it.

The only changes I made were I added noodles rather than rice, and I used my homemade broth. My husband liked it, I thought it was too bland.

My family and I love this soup! The only things I changed is that I added a brown rice and quinua blend in the soup, and added frozen green beans. I also added a little cornstarch and water at the end to thicken it. This made a wonderful low carb, high protein and veggie meal. My family ate every bit of it!

Made it exactly according to the directions and could not believe how tasty.  The whole family including picky children ate it up.  There is plenty of broth if you wanted to add more meat or vegetables according to your taste.

This is by far the best chicken and rice recipe I have ever had!  The addition of the lime gives this soup such a clean feel, especially since some chicken broths can feel heavy and oily.  I make this on the weekends and then have enough leftover for lunch for the rest of the week!  I guarantee that you will NOT be disappointed with this soup.

Took a trip to visit family in Cold Colorado.  I wanted to make something easy and warm....this was perfect.  We all loved it.  Everyone had seconds and some had thirds.  I did make it without the lime but followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".

I made a double batch for my Scout Troop to have by a fire while we checked out a quinzee I built. 
The only thing I changed was I did not add the lime.
The double batch WENT like lightning with 7 kids 2 adults.
Definitely making again!

Good flavor and quick and easy to make. I put in 2 cups rice right in the soup and cooked it that way. Huge mistake we had a big pot of rice. Next time won't make that mistake. I'll try just 1 cup rice and still cook it in the soup.

So simple, so yummy, so healthy! I used salt free chicken stock and beefed up the spices, also added half a cup of white wine and a tablespoon of minced garlic.  It tasted just like the homemade chicken rice soup my Italian grandmother used to make. Sooooo good!

Tried this recipe with leftover roast chicken (white meat) and the family loved it. The herbs, seasoning, and lime juice really made this recipe stand out. I was winding down a head cold and it seemed soothing.

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  The night before I diced the vegetables and put them in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator.  Diced up some boneless chicken breast and put them in a different ziplock bag.  Came home from work and it was SO simple to put together and cook.  The lime, makes a BIG difference.  It was delicious!  It was the first lime I have ever bought, but not the last after I found this recipe!  All in family loved it!

Why is this soup so good? I don't even make my own stock (use College Inn) , get the rotisserie chicken from Whole Foods and frozen rice packet from Trader Joe's (just throw it in at the end). I do use fresh parsley. Maybe it's the lime. I make this throughout the winter and whenever someone starts getting a cold - fabulous every time.  Thank you!

This is a good basic chicken soup recipe. I used cooked chicken so the broth mainly tasted like broth.  I decided to riff off the recipe. The lime made me think southwestern, so I added black beans, kidney beans, cumin and a can of diced tomatoes with chiles (mild for us).  Did not add rice to pot and cut the broth to 8 cups. Added a cup of chardonnay (I keep single serving bottles for soups) because it adds depth without the alcohol taste.  Microwaved a pouch of brown rice to add at the end. A tasty, hearty Southwestern soup that is a meal in a bowl.

A friend made this soup for me recently when I was sick. Every time we ate it, my husband and I said it was absolutely the best chicken and rice soup that we had ever had. Because it makes quite a lot, I want readers to know that it only gets better reheating. 5-Star for sure.

Added a ton of lime because we love acidity and a little bit of salt but otherwise made it as described.  Love it.

This is a fabulous recipe. No more canned chicken and rice sounds for us. I sautéed the vegetables first to cut down the cooking time. I did add some Bouquet Garni and some chicken base along with a couple extra bay leaves. Did salt and pepper to taste. Used a bit more rice than called for. In fact, it’s in the stove right now.

Delicious and very healthy. Followed the recipe then garnished with fresh ripe avocado and cilantro. I'm sure I'll be making this again and again. Thank you so much for a very simple yet flavorful recipe.

Awesome and easy!  I made this with my own saved bone broth from the chicken I cooked the day before.  I substituted riced cauliflower for the rice to keep it paleo friendly.  I kicked the flavor up a notch with a few organic diced tomatoes (5 romas) but the taste was great with or without the tomatoes.  This is a keeper and one I will memorize as are my other favorites!  Thanks to everyone for this one!

Great recipe! I was looking for a chicken soup with rice and came across this. I used the base recipe but fried the onion, celery, and fresh garlic before adding the broth etc. I also added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and russet potatoes.
My family and my best friend's house family love it!

Amazing! I used bouillon chicken base (sodium free) instead of chicken broth. Then I also added spinach. 

It's delicious!!! Definitely a good dish to make if you're sick or want to do some clean eating!

Excellent chicken soup.  My wife added about a tablespoon of  fresh chopped oregano and used a wild rice mixture.  Also added salt.  Excellent .   Will make again.

A very nice basic chicken rice soup, perfect for a cold day.  We added a little bouillon and basil, plus extra cracked pepper.

I give this 4 stars as is and 5 stars with my additions.  I added cumin, poultry seasoning, 1 clove of garlic, 3 bay leaves instead of one and increased the thyme to 3/4 tsp.  I didn't add the lime juice and used long grain rice. Yum -  good winter soup.

Very good soup. Made it tonight for dinner and it really hit the spot on a cold winter's night. I did add a little more rice since there was so much broth and we like a little more rice. This is a keeper.

I added more chicken and rice and added basil. I'd decrease the parsley. Also the pepper  can be a bit overwhelming. I'd double the recipe too because it is great for lunches!

My husband had a bad cold and wanted chicken soup.  I found this recipe which turns out is fast, easy, and delicious. I'm made 3 batches this week and made very few changes. I do use only 8 cups of packaged Trader Joe's broth and the flavor is wonderful.  He likes noodles in place of rice and I add about 2/3 cup of water as I put in the uncooked noodles, and I add the chicken in at the same time. Someone else suggested adding basil and I tried that on the second batch and found it to be a nice addition.  Haven't added the lime yet but bought one to add to today's batch.  This will be my go-to chicken soup recipe as it's so delicious and easy and canned soup is well - yucky with way too much salt!

Great basic recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp chopped garlic, then sauteed the veggies for about 2 mins.  Also added 1/2 tsp basil, cut the rice in half, then simmered it (including rinsed rice) in the broth with the veggies for 15 minutes.  Delicious!

I had made my own chicken stock from boiling a chicken and used that instead of the store bought.  I would add more chicken next time and less onion.  Good consistency with my homemade stock.

I sautéed the onions and celery in a little EVO. I ommited the bay leaf because I don't care for it and pureed the veggies with an immersion blender before adding leftover turkey. Thicken it with about a 2 Tbs of cornstarch and added more rice. The whole family loved it. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe to start with and then make it your own.  I have made it many times.  I use left over chicken from a rotisserie chicken from the day before.  I don't add parsley, thyme, the bay leaf or lime juice; instead I salt and pepper and add several shakes of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute.  I use Trader Joe's Basmati Rice Medley, which gives it a lot of additional flavor.  I also add half and half or milk to make it a little creamy, as well as steamed, chopped broccoli or green peas.  Yes, I know there are a lot of variations from the recipe, but as I said this one is a good place to start and then use what you have or what you like.   I think it makes a difference to first saute the onion, carrots & celery in a bit of olive oil before you proceed.

Great, thick, hearty soup without added cream and flour like many chicken rice soups!  Some changes:  deleted parsnips and substituted Italian seasoning for thyme and used a cup of uncooked brown rice. I added extra carrots and celery also-over a cup of each (3 big carrots, 3 large celery stalks)I added two large raw chicken breasts to the 10 c water, shredding it once cooked. I added some chicken bouillon at the end to adjust the salt to my pleasing. It was thick - almost a stew instead of soup which is how my family likes it. Super easy and quick!

My husband loves this soup!  It is not only tasty, easy to make, and made with ingredients that we generally have on hand, but eating this soup has helped him reach his weight loss goals.  He keeps asking for this soup!

I needed to use up an extra rotisserie chicken I had bought for company the previous day and wanted to make soup.  I just needed the basic ingredients/measurements of the recipe to go by, and it turned out very tasty.  My Mom and Hubby loved it...Very easy to make.

Delicious. More or less followed the recipe. At the end we blended the soup up to produce a creamier texture and added it to the soup. Came out a wonderful consistency.

This is a nice easy soup to make. Lots of flavour for something so simple - great as-is or you can add in other veggies you enjoy. I first made it for my husband when he had a cold but this has become a go to soup for chilly days. Reheats well

It wasn't a bad recipe but I added Bella mushrooms, squeezed a 1/2 lemon, some thyme, an onion, some olive oil, added garlic, and cooked the rice separate. Will have this for lunch all week!

This was really good. I will add more rice next time and I didn't have any parsley so I added a dash of basil to give it a little more flavor but I think this is definitely worth making again.

Really liked this recipe. Tweaked it slightly in that I sauted the onions, garlic, celery  and chicken in a very small amount of olive oil before adding the other ingredients  as I feel that gives a bit more depth to the flavor. I didn't have fresh parsley so used some dried and added a couple of hand fulls of fresh kale as it is in season just now and a really "good for you" veg.

I make this exactly as the recipe says and use a rice blend ... we love it! We live in the PNW, and soup is perfect in the winter. It will make many more appearances in our home.

One word to describe it (FANTASTIC)! Didn't change a thing except to add salt, as my chicken broth didn't have any.  So easy and with all ingredients on hand, this will be to go soup recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing it with us all.

Changed the butter to olive oil for a friend who can't have dairy.  I halved the recipe this time for my husband and me but added a little more chicken.  It tasted great!  I will make it again for my friend who is sick and on a special diet.

The flavor of this soup is AH-MAZING!! 

I had to make a couple of changes based on what I had so I didn't add thyme as I was totally out, added double the cracked pepper for spice and didn't add chicken because I wasn't wanting chicken but was craving a rice soup. Also cooked 1 cup of rice which made a bit more than 2 cups and added it all to replace the space the chicken would have filled.

Either way the flavor was pretty much the same as written and it blew me away! So easy and delicious! Even my kids tore it up. This is a keeper for sure!

I made mine with homemade chicken stock from the roasted whole chicken we had for dinner.  We ate some of the chicken with dinner yesterday, then I used the remaining meat for this soup.  It was great with a few oyster crackers on top :)

Really yummy soup! And my two kids who are fairly picky loved it too! Added a bit of dried basil and didn't add any lime (didn't have any). Used chicken thigh meat, this will be a staple at our house now! Nice and light too so you can eat more!

I made it, but used leftover turkey and broth from the turkey.  I always make turkey and rice soup with some of my leftover turkey,  without a recipe, but thought I would try this recipe in order to assure the right combination of ingredients and spices... It was delicious! Thanks!

This recipe is so easy and quick!  My husband and I love it!! I roasted a chicken the other night and had lots of left over chicken so used that.  I also had some left over rice as well so this was very quick to prepare.  I have always enjoyed cream based soups but can't afford the calories and this is a perfect and healthy alternative that I will make again and again!

Needs a little something extra...  I did add some additional herbs and spices.  My husband wants egg noodles with it next time instead of rice but overall it was good!
