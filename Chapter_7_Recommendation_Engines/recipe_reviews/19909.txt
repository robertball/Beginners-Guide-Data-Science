This was VERY bland.  I doctored it up by doing the following and it turned out great:
Added oregeno, basil, and garlic powder
Added a small can of tomato sauce
Put it in a 9x13 pan, smothered it with mozzerella cheese, and baked it until the cheese was melted.

Thought it was great. I started off by adding extra spices like basil, oregano, cilantro, as well as tomato paste and fresh garlic.

This was okay, but kind of bland. If I consider making this again, I will add some spices and garlic.

This  is similar to a New England standard (I'm from Boston) that we call American Chop Suey.  Our version uses hamburger, and the green pepper is mandatory.

So bland as written. I had to add a lot of spices and served it with shredded cheese and sour cream.

I only used 1 cup of macaroni which is perfect for our family and left out the mushrooms for personal preference.  This was enjoyed by all.

I have been making this since I moved out on my own many years ago . I seen my cousin from Canada make it once and I was hooked. I do add my own seasonings to my liking  and i add mushroom, celery onions and green peppers as well.

Very good, but agreed with some of the other reviews that it was a little bland.  Followed suggestion in another review and added garlic, oregano, basil and mozzarella and it was much better.  Will definately have this again!

My husband LOVES this recipe. Only recommendations would be to add Italian sausage links instead of ground sausage. Also doctor it up by adding olives and mixing up the noodles. Thanks!

My family loves this recipe. The only thing I did differently was add some chopped garlic.  I have made it many times and it is a family favorite.
