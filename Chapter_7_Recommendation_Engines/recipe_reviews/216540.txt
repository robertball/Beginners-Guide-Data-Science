i used whole wheat white flour, added just a touch of vanilla extract and used almost all organic ingredients. I took a previous reviewers advice and added in about a half cup (maybe more) of chopped pecans. I thought this was perfect. All the ingredient measurements were spot on, which I really appreciate. I actually made muffins out of this recipe (we're more of a muffin family than a loaf family) and I got twelve muffins that were a little on the bigger side. Right before baking, I pushed in a couple extra cranberries into the top of each muffin and sprinkled just a little extra chopped pecans on top. These baked up wonderfully and both kids and husband really enjoyed these.

I can easily give this one 5 stars based on the fact that I accidentally left the butter out and it was still very good. It must be that the banana, sour cream and egg made up for that shortfall. So yes, I will make this one again and be sure not to forget the butter as I'm sure it's even MORE flavorful and light with it. I used fresh cranberries that needed to be used up which increased the tartness, and one thing I would add would be walnuts. Thanks for giving us a nice change from typical banana bread.

Since I didn't have the exact ingredients, I did a little custominzing: 1 cup fresh cranberries, 1 cup banana, 1/4 cup applesauce, 2 tbsp whipped cream cheese, 1/3 cup canola oil. Still turned out wonderful!

This surprised me.  I had thought the amount of cranberries to be too much.  I was wrong as the loaf is excellent.   Next time I make it I will add 1 half cup of baked pecans chopped into smaller pieces.

That is some yummy banana bread! 
I "healthyfied" the recipe and used whole-wheat flour, applesauce instead of butter and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. The bread is moist and the tartness of the cranberries compliments well the sweetness of the bananas. 
Will sure make that again!

This is good. I used wheat flour, 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of butter, brown sugar and 2 small-medium bananas. 
I made muffins, and they turned out very heavy and dense.  The addition of cranberries made it the perfect sweetness. I would have given it 4 stars if it wasnt so dense.

I made half this recipe and it never cooked all the way through, or else it was just too moist.  Seems like it needs more flour or less bananas.

This recipe is a nice variation from the usual banana bread and is especially good when served warm.  My only change was to add 1 tsp of vanilla.

This has become our family's go-to banana bread recipe.  The dried cranberries really do pair well with the sweetness of the bananas.   I've experimented with the recipe over time, and the only changes I consistently make are to substitute whole wheat for all-purpose flour and coconut oil for butter.  Enjoy!

This is a tasty breakfast bread.  I was skeptical of the large amount of baking powder, but it worked.  Followed the instructions pretty closely, only switched lemon juice for grated orange peel.  The oats make it more substantial, than regular flour.   I would make it again.

This is good. I had to use vanilla yogurt in place of sour cream, and I tend to like things less sweet, so I ended up decreasing the sugar to about 1/3 cup. It is still pretty sweet, largely because of the dried cranberries. I did add walnuts, and I cooked it in three mini bread pans. Next time I will probably add cinnamon and vanilla for a bit more flavor. I might try a mix of dried cranberries and fresh ones to cut the sweetness and add some tang.

I used dried cherries instead of cranberries (my husband cannot eat them) and added chopped pecans.  This will be my "go to" banana bread recipe from now on!  It is delicious!

Tastes great! but I must have done something wrong because it crumbled when I cut it. I didn't have enough banana so I used 1 cup and 1 cup cranberries. My loaf pan is brown glass and I baked it for 45 min. Maybe that was too long? It was still moist but falling apart.

This bread came out so moist! It was great! I changed just a few things. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also didn't have dried cranberries on hand so I just didn't add them. It came out sooooo good. In the future I want to try a few things to get the top of the crust to brown up a little more - just for presentation. Maybe some egg-yolk or butter brushed on? I'll have to see. Definitely making this again!

This was so good. I work for a utility company so I made this to take to work with me on Christmas. It disappeared!

DELIOUS....Made this as an alternative to regular cranberry bread family usually has on T'Day! Will now be a regular on my list. Bananas made the bread moist and rich and the dried cranberries gave it a tangy chewiness that everyone loved! Only thing I might change would be a bit of almond extract to give it a hint of nuttiness(we don't use nuts generally)  YUM!! You have to try this!!
