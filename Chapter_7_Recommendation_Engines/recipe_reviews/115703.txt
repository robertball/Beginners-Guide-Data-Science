This was an odd combo.  I made it exactly as directed, against my better judgement.  Chicken should had definitly been sauteed before vegetables so it can brown, zucchini got soggy.  And two tablespoons of butter for one serving is a lot. I used two tablespoons for the whoel dish (3 chicken breast halves and 3 zucchini)  Its bland.

I used this as an inspiration.   I seasoned breasts with salt and pepper and italian seasoning.  seared the whole breast then finished in the oven. removed chicken to plattwr's nder loose foil. I deglazed the pan with some marsala wine.  reduced then add garlic zucchini and sliced grape tomatoes and red pepper flakes.  sliced up the chicken put it back in pan and tossed.  served with veggies on side topped with parm cheese green onion and parsley and remaining sauce on the chicken.

I cooked the chicken seperatly, but put a TBSP of olive oil and a dash of salt in the pan. In another pan, I nelted the butter, salted and peppered it, then threw in the garlic. After that was cooked down some, i thre in the onions and sweated them. Then added the zucchini right before the chicken was fully finished. I cut the chicken in bite sized pieces and tossed back in the original pan, when it was done, then I added the chicken to the other pan with garlic, onions, and zucchini. Salted a little more, and added the rest of the butter. Everything turned out really good. A nice quick, easy, and delicious recipe. Also very healthy.

Not really flavorful, but it turned out okay. My husband liked it.
