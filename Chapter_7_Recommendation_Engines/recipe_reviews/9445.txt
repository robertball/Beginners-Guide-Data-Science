Thank you for this recipe! I used white chocolate chips instead of coating. Also, I mixed the pretzels in the white chocolate first, then stirred in the colored candies to prevent the red and green candies from melting in the white and swirling it. I had no melting/swirling problems this way. After spreading on the baking sheet (9x13), I hand-inserted more red and green candies on top for color, and then sprinkled the whole pan with red and green sugar sprinkles. Turned out great, thank you!

A very pretty dessert.  Warning any broken M&M will swirl brown choclate with the white and some of the candy coating melted.

Perhaps I should have known, but the recipe would have been more successful if the recipe required WHITE CHOCOLATE instead of CONFECTIONER'S COATING. Who knew!

This recipe was easy to make and fabulous.  I did, however, make one change...instead of using the red and green candies I used red and green sugar.  It turned out beautiful.

This was fun to make (quick, easy) and didn't last long, everyone had to try it. They never made it to snack tray.  Thank-you.

I did not try this specific recipe, but in the past I made Holiday Bark with white chocolate, mini candy canes, and unsalted mini pretzels. It was a big hit.
