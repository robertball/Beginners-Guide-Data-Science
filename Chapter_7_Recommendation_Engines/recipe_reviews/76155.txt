For Kerms, the water is supposed to be for the rice. Not the etouffee. I think that was your mistake.

I tried to make this etouffee and it was a disaster!  I think the measurements might be wrong.  With 3/4 cup of butter (that's a stick and a half of butter) and 6 cups of water, I basically ended up with butter soup.  The recipe only calls for a couple of tablespoons of tomato sauce.  Within 6 cups of water, that doesn't do anything.  Maybe its supposed to be tomato paste?  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I basically ended up with melted butter floating on top of slightly tinted water.  I ended up having to throw the whole thing out.  It was very disappointing because all the shrimp (I didn't have crawfish) was wasted.  Maybe I did something wrong, if so please tell me!  I was so excited when I read the other reviews.  Mine just didn't turn out anything like it.

Super easy! I am from Louisiana and agree with other reviews...etouffee should not contain canned soups! My entire family enjoys this recipe!

I am from Louisiana, born and raised, and as Cajun as it gets.  This is how we make crawfish etouffee.  Everybody's recipe is a little different.  Most Cajuns put the "Trinity" in their etouffee.  The Trinity is a compliment of seasonings that go together very well- bellpepper, celery, and onion.  My family adds celery, and the only reason we leave the  bellpepper out is because I am allergic to it.  Great recipe.   Bon appetite!

Way too bland. Great base for an etouffee recipe but if prepared just as the recipe was written, I’d actually give it 2 ½ stars.  However, I jazzed it up with the following:
1 bell pepper, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
cayenne pepper, several dashes
Louisiana Hot Sauce, several dashes
6 Garlic cloves
10 green onions
6 teaspoons Tony’s Cajun Seasoning
1 stick of unsalted butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons tomato paste instead of using tomato sauce
With the above additions, I give it a solid 4 stars. ****

This was very tasty but I made a few modifications.  I only used 1 stick of butter, added a green bell pepper to saute with the onion, increased to 2 cloves of garlic, and increased tomato sauce to about 4-5 Tbsp.  I cooked the sauce and then in the last few minutes I added some frozen crawfish tails and shrimp left over from a crawfish boil that I thawed (they were already cooked).  Very easy recipe!

Had to rate this a 5 to offset Kern's review. The 3 cups of water are to cook the rice in, not to add to the Etouffee.

I just made this last night and I was so glad it really was as easy as it seemed.  The flavor was wonderful!  The only thing I would change is the amount of onion in the beginning.  It was a bit too much for my taste.  I also added shrimp since I didn't have enough crawfish.  It was SOOOO GOOD! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great basic recipe for etouffee. I tweak it just a little. I use chicken broth in place of water and add two chopped green bell peppers when sauteeing the onions. The chicken broth gives the etouffee a full rich flavor. I also don't measure the broth but eyeball it to the right gravy like consistency. Absolutely delicious! Also... I serve my etouffee over mashed potatoes instead of rice... If you have not tried this PLEASE do! Very yummy comfort food!

Easy and delicious! I'm from Louisiana but don't get to eat the good stuff too often since moving away. I made a few changes: used only 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) to reduce fat a little, about 1/2 of an onion, no-salt tomato sauce, omitted salt and pepper, and cut Tony's to 1 TBSP - my husband's a wimp. : ) Still got rave reviews! May add an extra clove of garic next time. Will add this one to my recipe file.

To the user Kerms, and any one else who had the problem where to etouffee had too much liquid:  The 6 cups of water is to boil the rice!! Don't put that much water in your etouffee! If you do find that you added too much water on accident try cooking it uncovered, stirring constantly over medium heat to cook some water out. Also, etouffees usually will thicken up if you let them stand. Remember that rice will absorb a lot of juice when you combine them, so you may find it better to have a little more liquid than you originally intended. As a last resort if you just have too much water, you can always add more flour by slowly stirring it in.   Otherwise, this is a very solid recipe! :)

This dish was very easy to prepare.  I used shrimp instead of crawfish.  I served it over white rice and was a resounding success with my family.

Those of you that are making "butter soup" with this recipe, you are passing over the first step. The rice is supposed to be cooked seperatly, the etouffee is a topping for the rice. It is an easy 2 step recipe--
I love this recipe, it is super easy to make and taste wonderful! We always make it when we have leftovers from a crawfish boil

We made the recipe as written and thought it was a little thick as well. So, we added some water to thin as bit adn it was perfect. This is a keeper recipe. I used another reviewers hint of boiling the heads in water for the rice water, and it was really delicious.

I made this last night, it was so easy and quick and not to mention delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and used craw fish tails from the freezer section.  I served with the rice and a buttermilk biscuit (Pillsbury frozen). Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic!  It was so easy and tasty.  Kerms it seems like what you did was mix it incorrectly.  The 6 cups of water is used for cooking the 3 cups of rice.  That would be done separate from the other part.

Good, but I used tomato paste.  I buy it in a tube so you don't have to waste the can and I put a lot of red pepper in it.  My husband loves it hot and spicy!

The first time I made it I hadn't made a roux before, so it was too thick, but still tasted good.  The second time I think I got it right.  I took it to a movie night/pot luck.  Everybody loved it.

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  Crawfish etoufee is one of my all-time favorite dishes, and this one measures up with the best of them.  The only thing I would change is less water (only needs about 4 cups) and more tomato sauce (I use a whole 8oz can).

I am a big fan of anything cajun/creole. I really enjoyed this recipe. The best one I have run across so far. What makes it even better is that my wife and kids DONT eat it. So it leaves more for me :)  Thanks0, this is quick, easy and really good.

Delicious.  My hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed this etouffee.  I was unable to find crawfish at my local grocery, so I substituted large shrimp and it was great.  I therefore changed the cooking up a bit, I cooked the shrimp in the butter with the onions and the cajun seasoning, then removed the shrimp when just cooked, to add back in just before serving.  A+

3.5 stars overall.  I was a raised on a variation of this recipe, but I gave this one a shot for something a little different. I found the suggested amount of seasoning was too salty, but the directions did say "or to taste." My real complaints are that it's very thick and I had to double the amount of water t thin it and there was way too much diced onion. My husband complained that it gave him a stomach ache. OH well, worth a try, but I'll stick with my stepmom's recipe.

Awesome, classic Louisiana recipe.  I HAD to rate a 5 to offset the person who didn't understand to use the 6 cups of water for the rice!  Thanks for printing this Bonniet.

I made this recipe for some friends last night, while we watched the Mayweather fight, and it was absolutely great! Well I had to make a few adjustments. It was too thick going by the recipee. I had to add water a few times. I used minced garlic instead, didn't use that much flour, used alittle more tomatoe sauce. Added my cayenne pepper and tony chachere, oh and also added some hot richard's sausage, and it was perfect...and so easy to prepared.

I liked this recipe. The consistency was a little bit too thick, but not overly so.  Everyone loved it.

I used shrimp instead of crawfish, since most  recipes are good for both. I used chopped tomato instead of canned tomato sauce, seafood stock instead of water, and added a half a teaspoon of slap your mama Cajun seasoning. Not sure why other recipes are using canned soup but good ingredients make a good etouffee.

This is an awesome recpie! I actually made it with shrimp, crawfish tails, and andouille sausage. I also added a pich of Old Bay seasoning & cayenne pepper for that kick! This is an easy and good recipe. Thanks!

This 4 star was taken to a five star with a few simple changes. I added a red bell pepper and 2 stalks of celery to the onion step. Then I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion and 2 teaspoons of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce. Then as a last step I added mushrooms. WOW...I am from Louisiana and I loved this!!!

only used one stick of butter, 3 cloves of garlic, + one chopped bell pepper after the onions cooked for a few minutes.  It was a perfect first attempt and a great recipe.  I am currently living in LA and this is right on the money.

I made this recipe on Sunday and it was great! I do believe there is a little confusion about what to do with the 6 cups of water. Is it for the rice or the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe! The only sub I make is I use half the butter and replace the other half with EVOO, it is a very creamy, smooth sauce that I find myself craving :) LOVE IT!! I get frozen Crawdad meat at Wal-Mart (Who Knew??) I make this all the time and my hubby LOVES IT :)

I did not care for this recipe. I cooked exactly as indicated (no extra water here) and it was basically a tasteless butter/onion slop. That's not etouffee. Two tablespoons of canned tomato sauce is ridiculous - this needs more tomato punch than that. I've had etouffee (the real stuff) many times and this just isn't it.

I've used this recipe several times and have been extremely pleased with the results.  I made the mistake of measuring the Cajun seasoning in teaspoons instead of tbsp.  Using the listed amount gives a nice kick!

This was delicious! I only made a few modifications.... added about 1/3 can of Tomatoe Sauce, 2 cloves of garlic and approx 2.5 tbls of cajun seasoning (maybe alittle more- I kept sprinkling it in for taste).  Everything else stayed the same.

So easy, quick and so very good!  I like it a bit spicier, so I used Penzey's hot cajun seasoning.  It was just right.  Two other mods just to please our palate:  A little less onion, a little more garlic.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I really liked this! It was pretty easy and it all goes in one pan which is a huge bonus for me! (Less clean up!) I ended up using a whole small can of tomato sauce just for our desired consistency and shrimp because of availability! Other than that I didn’t change a thing!

This is a good recipe but I prefer to sub milk for half of the water. It makes a decadent sauce which clings to the crawfish. Also, don't just add flour and mix. You have to cook out the flour, stirring constantly, until it just begins to brown or your dish will taste like raw flour. I have lived in New Orleans and then Baton Rouge for over 20 years and these are tips I've learned along the way!

This wasn't a home run for us. we love étouffée but I found myself without peppers and decided to give this recipe a try. We really missed those peppers in the final dish, and it had way too much butter for us. No one wanted seconds which never happens around here, so this one won't go in the keeper file. I don't usually make a recipe without tweaking it, and I should have done the same here.  Thanks for the recipe to try though!

This was freaking ridiculous! It almost tastes like the étouffée from pappadeux. Very authentic tasting! I added a few extra ingredients like parsley and a bay leaf :) it was BIG hit with my family!!! Thank god I didn't go with the recipe that called for can of mushroom lol!

I made this a couple of months ago. I did exactly what the directions said...until the end. I had to add a little of this and that here and there to get my desired taste. Overall it's a great recipe. 

Btw, it's way better on baked potatoes with shredded cheese than just plain rice!!!

This was fantastic! Rich and wholesome. I hate spicy foods and I LOVE etouffee so it was great to be able to measure my own amount of cajun seasoning (restaurant etouffee is often too spicy for me). The only change I made was I only cut up half an onion and I put an entire red bell pepper in. Accidentally used a little more butter than needed and so did not use any water, but it turned out so wonderful!

I also believe that étouffée should not contain any canned soup. So, I substituted one small fresh tomato for the soup. I only use the tomato "meat." Quarter the tomato and use a cheese grater to extract the meat and leave the skin. Fantastic!!

This is a lovely mild etouffee.  I am giving it five stars because it is so easy for beginners and people who might be afraid of "cajun cooking."  However, I think it needs more--I added celery and bell pepper to the onion, and extra green onion and cajun spices to the end product.  This would be perfect as written for kids along with a ton of butter on their french bread!  Eat it, cher!

Please note, the water amounts were for the rice + the etouffee.  I'm sure if I had made this correctly I would have rated it at least 4 stars, but I can't give this a 5-star review because it was so vague in the directions.  It took me reading the other reviews to figure out where it went wrong.

This was excellent!  We did not have any crawfish available to us so I used mini shrimp instead.  I also did not have any tomato sauce so I used pizza sauce instead and it still tasted amazing.  I found there was a bit too much rice though.  I also cut down the amount of Cajun seasoning to 1/2 tbsp but next time I would add more.

I loved this!  Next time I will leave out the onions in the beginning though.  My husband and I don't really care for them and found that they weren't really needed.

Extremely easy and delicious.  I cut rice down to half, cut back on butter and used my own Cajun Seasoning which does not contain salt.  Absolutely first class.  Also used the heads from the crawfish to make a stock which I used to make the rice and the one cup of water for the etouffee.  Thanks for sharing!

I've always been scared to cook, and my guy lived in the New Orleans are for years where etouffee is all over.  Thought this would be a quick and easy meal, and it was.  I used shrimp instead of crawfish.  The whole meal was finished off by both of us in one sitting!  I was so proud that he heaped more rice and smothered his plate full of the etouffee for seconds!

I took some of the recommendations from the comment section and made this wonderful dish. I like spicy food so I added jalapeños.  When I make this dish again, I will cut back on the salt content.

Very delicious!!
I absolutely love etouffee but I have never tried to make it. This recipe was soo easy and quick.
I will definitely make it again, maybe add some shrimp to it.

This is the first etouffe recipe I have found that is truly an etouffe.  I'm from LA and you can count on this being authentic.  The only thing I would do different is use a dark roux, but to each his own.  All of the other ingredients are on point and it is not cooked in a microwave (God forbid!).  Kudos for putting a true Cajun recipe out there.

I've made this several times, and all I have to say is it's a GREAT recipe. It's my (and guests') favorite recipe for etouffee from several cookbooks and sites. The only caution I have would be to watch the salt.

It DOES need SOME salt to taste good, but the amount of salt in pre-packaged creole/cajun spice blends, and in tomato sauces, and in the unrinsed seafood contributions to this recipe, can REALLY vary based on geographic location and/or store...
The first few time(s) you make this, use low/no-salt cajun seasoning, low/no-salt stock in place of the water, low/no-salt tomato sauce, and rinse your crawfish or shrimp several times in clean water. Then, and ONLY then, salt to taste...

...perfect.

I made this with shrimp instead of crawfish and used half an onion instead of a whole one but it was delicious! The consistency and flavoring was perfect and not ten minutes after it was complete did my family completely devour it. Definitely making again and will do with crawfish once it's not 16 bucks a pound for tails.

This turned out absolutely perfect. Delicious with the raw shrimp that I used. 

I followed this recipe exactly until finishing up the water addition to the étouffée. I found that two cups of water was necessary to decrease the consistency of it. It was far too thick for me with only one cup of water. The flavors were still dynamite even after adding the water. 

The measurements of all other ingredients were 100% spot-on. This will become a staple in our home from now on.

Doubled recipe. Added diced celery, bell pepper. Added more flour and then more water to get right consistency. Substituted 2 tablespoon of tomato paste for tomato sauce. Added shrimp in addition to crawfish. Seasoned with Tony's Cajun seasoning and Cajun hot sauce. Added fresh parsley and green onion. Everyone loved it!

Good recipe. A little too salty as well. I'll cut it back to 2.5 Tbsp of Tony Sacheret only. Definitely add the celery and bellpepper. Will try again soon.

I made this tonight and it turned out great. I believe I added a bit too much seasoning due to the fact my crawfish was already boiled with seasoning. I added celery and bell pepper to make it more authentic.

Tomato in Creole version but not in Cajun "light brown gravy" type.  This is a staple in Cajun country during crawfish season and with quality frozen tail meat available now year round can be enjoyed year round.  If the crawfish is not properly frozen, it can develop a "fishy" taste, so be sure the crawfish are of good quality.  If quality crawfish are not available, quality frozen or fresh shrimp, crab or fresh mild white fish will work quite well.

Very easy and good. Do note that some of the 6 cups of water is to boil rice not for making etouffee. I added a little extra tomato sauce and seasoning. Overall a great recipe

Not quite sure how to rate it because the flavour is all there but unfortunately the butter and flour didn’t incorporate properly.  I made sure to sprinkle the flour in little by little.  At first it looked perfect but then it started to separate.  Any helpful tips for the future?

i was nervous about making this! i work with a woman from NOLA and even she LOVED it! it was very easy to make and only took about 30 min. i already had the crawfish pre-peeled in the freezer from a boil a few months ago. I did add 1/4 cayenne, ground pepper, oregano, thyme and garlic/onion powder instead of cajun seasoning.

THE 6 CUPS OF WATER IS FOR THE RICE. I saw a lot of people used it for the sauce itself. Aside from that I'm from southern Louisiana and while this isn't quite what I was having down there, it is still pretty amazing. 5 stars.

My few changes were to use 1/2c. (one stick) of butter, it was plenty! And I added a small amount of finely chopped bell pepper with the onion, and added two bay leaves in with the water and tomato sauce. (Remove these before serving)
I've used shrimp in place of the crawfish before and it's still excellent, and probably healthier too :)

This is a really good recipe. My husband and I visited Louisiana last year and we loved the food but, there aren't any Cajun restaurants near where we live. Happy to report this recipe tastes like what we had in NOLA and is easy to make at home!   I made a few modifications, added bell pepper and celery to make the "trinity" used 1 Tbsp tomato paste instead of sauce since I didn't want to open a new jar and I made it with shrimp since we don't get crawfish up here. Only downside was IMO 3/4 C butter was a little too much, it left a lot of oil floating on top. I will cut down to 1/2 C next time and see how that goes.

I gave 3 stars bc the general whole of the recipe was good. I did change It as others said. I added way more than 2 tbsp of tomato sauce and 1 1/2 sticks of butter is probably a little much. But after some tweaks it turned out pretty good!

I'm from East Texas, and Cajun food is huge here. I did make a few substitutions  (added the trinity, and I had bought crawfish sausage that I wanted to try), but this is a flavorful dish! Very close to my  Cajun uncle's etoufee!

I liked this. I added shrimp and andouille sausage. Idon't see how it was bland for some as you're to add seasoning to your taste! This was a perfect blueprint recipe to go off of.  If you feel it's lacking or missing anything,  make it your own.

I would give it a five except that I know the celery and bell pepper r made it better than it would be. I followed commenters suggestions and did that as well as used only a stick of butter and less onion. All in all this was a success and consider this a good base recipe that one can make changes to to their liking. It feeds a lot of people and tasted great and took about 20 minutes or so. Rice was done at the same time as the fish. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is a great basic recipe that you can easily modify!! Although,  I gave it 4 stars because I think the proportions are a bit off.  I found that the 3 cups of rice was way too much rice! We had a ton leftover. Also, I felt as though it was too much butter. Which wasn't a big deal since we were able to drain some of it and it tasted pretty good!  Next time I'll probably only use a stick of butter, a cup of rice, more seasonings,and  maybe even some bell peppers. This is a great recipe if it's your first time cooking etouffe.

I wanted something fast to cook for supper. I had some frozen crawfish tails ... then I found this recipe. My family loved it. 

My mother is from Louisiana, and I was born in south Louisiana as well but did not grow up there. The only time I ate good dishes like this was when we went back for visits. Very authentic recipe.  I did add bell pepper and have eaten it with celery as well. Just didn't have any on hand.

And for the record ... a cup of water is needed for the recipe ... as it states. The rest of the water is for the rice.

This recipe has great bones. I used shrimp instead of crawfish tails because my grocery store was out. I added Worcestershire sauce and two ribs of chopped celery to mine and it took this over the top.

The first time I made it I did it exactly by the recipe and it was very good but we thought it was way too much butter.  The butter floated on the top.  The second time I made it I cut the butter to 1/2 cup and added smoked sausage and okra.  Now it's one of my husband's favorite dinners.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am from New Orleans and this one is a keeper. I did add about a cup and a half of water. It should be a smooth but thick sauce. Just an FYI for others it is better the next day once the flavors have had a chance to meld.

Great recipe! I added a green bell pepper, 2 stalks of celery, and upped the water added to 1.5 cups and let it cook down until it had the right consistency. I found 1.5-2 tablespoons of Tony's good enough to salt and season the whole thing. If you use frozen tails from the supermarket they can have an undesirable taste. Thaw them in water with crab boil and it will taste more like they came from a crawfish boil and will  get rid of that frozen crawfish farm flavor.

I had to double the recipe so I made some changes while I was at it :).  When sauteeing the onion I added celery and green pepper.  I used badia cajun seasoning which was not much of a kick but to much for my girlfriend, so be cautious if cooking for people who dislike spice.  Tasted amazing, my family loved it and I look forward to making it again!

I am from Lafayette, LA, you skipped a portion of the directions. For starters we use the Cajun Trinity, onions, bell pepper and celery. You melt butter, saute onions bell pepper and celery until the onions are translucent. Then make the roux. When roux is brown enough I add 2 tbs of tomato paste. You add water,  make sure sauce isn't to thick. Let simmer about 10 minutes, then add crawfish, cook another 10 minutes, serve over rice.

Loved this, it was so easy! I ended up using about two cups of water in the sauce instead of one. Other than that, no changes needed. Even my kids liked it!

I subbed shrimp for the crawfish, shrimp stock (I had on hand in the freezer) for the water and only used some Cajun seasoning (and no additional salt). Not only was it easy to throw together, but it tasted great the first night and reheated wonderfully  and tasted great as a leftover meal as well! Yum! Can't wait to hunt down some crawfish and give them a try! Thanks for sharing!

I rated this a 4 b/c I cut down on the Cajun seasoning and I'm glad that I did. If I had used 1 1/2 tablespoon it would have been way to salty and spicy! I did use chicken broth as others had advised. Also, I used frozen (yes, I know) crawfish b/c that's all I could find. This is a true New Orleans dish and it is so good. I will make again and may use shrimp with it!!! I made a nice tossed salad and crusty garlic bread to go with this!!!  Wonderful meal!

I made a few changes.  I sauteed my onions with 1 red bell pepper, 1 green bell pepper, 1 cup of chopped celery . I added a pound of shrimp,and followed the recipe, but at the end, I added 2 cups of crawfish tails from a boil that we had, I also added shucked corn from 4 mini cobs that were cooked in our crawfish boil. They added a great flavor.

I just made this recipe for the first time. I was really nervous because my husband's version is top notch. Added a few things like a bell pepper, two stalks celery and a tad bit more garlic. My husband and kids loved it! I will definitely keep using this in the future.

First time making it and all I can say is WOW!  Fresh crawfish and fresh veggies and herbs and spices. OMG it turned out absolutly fantastic. I agree that the directions for the water needs to be better clarify. I ended up using 3 cups of water for this dish. Otherwise the directions are spot on.

I made this last night with a couple of modifications. I was craving etouffee but didn't have any seafood in the house so I minced up some chicken breast and added that in after the onion. I also added a finely chopped bell pepper because I had it on hand. My husband and I loved it! I served it over top fried cheddar grits....WOW! Can't wait to make it with shrimp next week.

Only thing I did differently was that I added a chopped bell pepper, some celery and some Tony's. I'm a south louisiana girl - and this was the real deal!  And so easy and quick! With these tweaks, it gets 5 stars!

This was fantastic! I added a few bouillon cubes to the water for the rice just cause that's how I like it. I also did half Cajun seasoning, half blackened seasoning, and a few shots of Tabasco. (Approximately 3/4 Tbl each of the seasoning's and about a Tbl of Tabasco) I did 4 oz of tomato sauce as recommended in another review and this was ahhhhhhhhhmazing!

I agree great basic recipe, only because i tweaked to my taste buds. 1)instead of water use chicken broth 2)i used swai fish fillets (cut into bite sized pieces and shrimp) 3) season seafood with salt,garlic/onion powders, oregano, basil, cayenne, crushed red pepper flakes, chipoltle chilli pepper,a dash of old bay, celery seed, tumeric, & a dash of chilli powder. 4) i sautéed some frozen green bell peppers with the onions. Also instead of seasoning the base with cajun seasoning(i don't use it AT ALL) i seasoned it with a little salt, small dash of celery seed and a dash of cayenne. WIth these modification a solid 5. Also to the rice i added parsley flakes for color.

Loved this recipe!  Added half a can of rotel and half a can of sweet corn to make it a little more hearty.  The rotel added some heat too.  Will definitely add this recipe to our family's menu.

Just made this and it was great! Doubled the recipe in some places by adding more crawfish, green onions, flour, onions and garlic. I did add 8 cups of water and it was somewhat soupy at first, but I fixed that with more flour and let it simmer a bit longer. After it set, it was awesome, and everyone loved it!! :)

I used to eat this a lot in high school; it was prepared by a friend that live i LA for a time.  It has been a favorite of mine that i had never tried to replicate.  This recipe was spot on what i remember!  It was such a great joy to taste it again!  My hubby had never had etoufee before and he loved it too :)

This recipe is awesome!! The only thing I plan on changing the amount of butter I use next time. It came out kind of greasy, so I'm thinking cutting the butter amount in half will do the trick.

Loved it! Made it for my family and one of my sisters who does not like crawfish ettouffee ate a couple of bowls! She had made spaghetti on the side thinking that's what she would eat but she didn't even touch the spaghetti!

Yumm! It was a bit too buttery for my  taste, so I added a bit more tomato sauce, and favorite hot sauce to the mix, and it was amazing! And so easy!

quick and easy.  I'm not sure how much water I used in the end, I poured in a little extra two or three times because it was extremely thick.  And this was a little too spicy for me, so next time I think I will put in less of the cajun seasoning.

used more garlic,3-4 cloves, substituted marinara sauce for tomato sauce, used red onion, added pimento (red pepper), very easy on the cajun seasoning , wanted to enjoy without tears. Awesome!! TFM.

For Kerms, I made the same mistake and it was easily rectified. I made a blonde rue, one cup butter and one cup flour, and then added it to the mixture and some more Tony's and it turned out great. 

I'm from Louisiana also, and me and my husband loved this recipe, even though I made a mistake. It was quick, easy, and tasted great.

This was so delicious.. the only thing I would change is the amount of butter.. it was floating on top when I was done.. and made it a little too rich.. but other than that it was excellent!

Kerms - the first part of the recipe - the six cups of water and rice part - was just to make the rice. Sounds like you combined all that together. I can see how it confused you. Sorry you wasted your shrimp. Try it again!

Delicious and easy, I also added an extra tbsp of tomato sauce, plus some chopped cherry tomatoes. Tasted very similar to those I've had in restaurants in NO, and just as easy to make as those requiring canned soups.

There was more onion than I would have wanted, but I was impressed that this "cheating" recipe (no roux) came out very good and tasty.  I used more tomato sauce than it called for (several more tbs) since it was lacking a "depth" in the flavor somehow.  I think next time I'll add sauteed peppers (and a bit less onion) - maybe that's the missing depth...  Overall very tasty.

Wonderful recipe!  I included about 2 tablespoons of crawfish fat when I added the water.

This was my first attempt to an make etouffee and it was delicious!!  The only thing I added was about a teaspoon of liquid crab boil.  That set the whole thing off.  I made it last week and I am making it again tonight.  This time I think I am gonna use a cup of butter instead of 3/4 and add some bellpepper from my garden.  Thank you for the recipe!!

My husband moved to south Louisiana a year before myself and our sons, and fell in love with Crawfish Etouffee. I found this recipe and gave it a whirl. He LOVED it! Said this is what Etouffee is supposed to taste like. And so easy!
