I also have made this recipe for many years. Our recipe has half butter and half shortening in the cake. It always turns out great.  I have baked it in a 9 x13 inch pan when that was what was available and it is still good. I have added cinnamon to the cake or icing for a little different flavor.  I have made it without nuts in the icing for people who don't like nuts and have made it half with nuts in the icing and half without ( just pour some icing on half the cake and add nuts to the remaining icing and spread on the other half).  I have a friend who makes it with regular milk not buttermilk.  It is a very forgiving cake.  Since the cake is very moist I have never tried layers.  I use the same saucepan for the icing I use for the cake.  I have seen this named Sheath Cake, Texas Sheet Cake and 22 minute cake. Happy cooking!

I have been making this cake since I was about 10 years old, and I will be 46 next month! Everyone who has ever had this LOVES it! So moist and delicious. I add extra cocoa, usually about a half cup total, and have even used the dark cocoa, that is really good.  On my birthday I always want the "Mississippi Mud" version-(my mom's)  when the cake comes out of the oven, (baked in 9x13 pan) spread a jar of marshmallow cream over it while it is still very warm.  Then make the frosting with the nuts, and once the marshmallow has cooled very carefully spread the frosting over the marshmallow.  Yes, very decadent- thats why I want it for my birthday!  I have shared this recipe more than any other over the years- everyone enjoy!

I have been making this recipe for more than 25 years... Sometimes I add 1  Tablespoon more of the unsweetened cocoa powder for more of a chocolate taste in the cake and the icing!...it is a very easy and quick way for a wonderful cake.....my recipe is called "Brownie Sheet Cake".....got it from a friend of mine!

Been making this for years with the following differences: extra tablespoon of cocoa in both cake and frosting and sour cream in place of buttermilk.  I also try to prepare the frosting just before the cake comes out of the oven and pour it on the hot cake.  The heat makes it easily spread as long as you are not heavy-handed and it sets up like a perfectly smooth fudge on top.

This is a simple and tasty cake to take to a potluck at the last minute. I did increase the cocoa by 1 tablespoon cuz I love chocolate. Otherwise, made as directed. Wonderful cake Mrs. Altmiller!

Chocolate sheet cake always goes over well at our family functions. While this wasn't the best sheet cake I've had or made it was good. I used a 10x15  sheet pan and it fit perfectly. Once you pour the batter into the pan be sure to pick pan up about and inch from the counter and drop to the counter a few times to pop the air bubbles. I forgot to do that and ended up with a very unevenly baked cake. I always pour the warm frosting over a warm cake. It's just the way I learned to make a cake like this. I left the pecans out of the frosting and toasted them in a dry non-stick skillet before adding them to the top of the cake.

Just a warning: this batter is VERY runny. If it turns out like soup, don't be alarmed. I used cake flour (if you do this, be sure to add an extra 2 T. for every cup of flour), I also warmed the butter and water in the microwave and then added the cocoa powder (used and extra T of cocoa too). Lastly, I turned them into cupcakes instead of using a jellyroll pan. If you do this, be sure not to overfill the cupcake molds because I overfilled a couple and, although it wasn't disastrous, batter was overflowing out the middle of a couple of them. All in all, the cupcakes turned out fine, but I didn't find the cake itself to be all that chocolaty. I think next time I'd add even more cocoa powder or even some chocolate chips might add a lot to this recipe. Granted, I did not use the frosting recipe on here, instead I used a vanilla frosting, so I'm sure using a chocolate frosting would help too.  I used vanilla because I decorated them with Christmas sprinkles and I thought the sprinkles would pop more on the vanilla instead of the chocolate. Also, this recipe yielded about 20 cupcakes and they cooked for about 20-25 minutes.

This is liteally better than anything else in existence.
Ever. 
I usually up the cocoa amounts and add mini chocolate chips to the batter and glaze, just because I'm a little over-obsessed with chocolate. This is my favorite cake to make, and I've made it for my birthday, for parties, for others, and just because I feel like having chocolate, and it always pleases.

This is the best chocolate sheet cake ever.  I usually cut the icing recipe in half or doube the cake recipe.  It's too much icing for my taste.  But it's really moist with all that butter and really delicious!  Thanks for posting, I had this recipe 30 years ago and lost it.  I'm so happy you posted it.

Good cake. Word of warning, this takes longer than 25 minutes to bake. The ends get done quick but it seems like the middle takes a while longer. Good flavor, but light in texture. As a personal preference I like a denser cake, but would still make again as a good base cake.

I haven't baked in a while but a guy I know had a birthday so I gave this a shot.  The frosting was easy to decorate the cupcakes with and tastes like a wonderful fudge. Cake moist and held together well. On a few cupcakes I added marshmallow under frosting.  Thank you for the recipe, the cupcakes are so good!

This cake is very good. Do not double the icing like I did. It's way too much. Lol. You'll get the sugar sweats. The cake is moist. I used a 9x13 pan and had to bake for an additional 15. Came out GREAT

I added an extra Tablespoon of Cocoa powder to cake, and to the frosting, and substituted sour cream for the buttermilk.  
My discerning women's club members loved it and so did my husband and I !!   The frosting was so rich and fudgey! Yum yum!

This is an easy cake to bring to a potluck. Made it for my family and wanted more chocolate taste to it. I added an add'l tbs to both the cake and frosting. Be sure to wait until you are almost ready to frost the cake to make the frosting. If not, you will need to reheat the frosting to allow it to spread correctly. (Think part glaze/part frosting). Delicious.

This recipe has been in my family for over 30 years; it is always requested for a birthday or anytime we need a dessert. I have substituted sour cream for the buttermilk, and it is still delicious. I have also cut back on the icing ingredients, and it come out great, just not so thick or sweet.

I ended up cooking longer than the recipe called for and had to move the rack closer to the top towards the end so it would cook evenly and not burn the bottom

OLDEN days?   Yes I have been making this cake since the dinosaurs roamed!  However, I poke holes in the hot cake, press it down with a clean cloth and pour the icing over the hot cake.

It's even better with more chocolate, and using coffee  or express powder in it.  It intensifies thes and deepens the chocolate flavor!  I've also made this for over 55 years.  Have doubled  and tripled the recipe and made it in large rectangular baking or lasagna pan for a large crowd!   Everyone ALWAYS asks for  the recipe.   My family loves chopped walnuts on the top, but it's also delicious with no nuts, for those with  nut allergies.   It's always a big hit!   Extremely easy to take on a picnic or elsewhere .

I have used a similar recipe for years. This is now my “go to” chocolate cake.  It is requested at most every family or company gathering I go to.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Sooo easy to make. Used gluten free all-purpose flour and it also worked! :) Very good, I'll have to make it again.

I will make this again but sprinkle the nuts on top of the icing rather than in it.  This is very light tasting despite all the butter!

This cake is wonderful. It’s simple, chocolatey, and super easy to make. I used gluten free flour so I reduced the sugar by 25%. This cake does disappear quickly, so make two if you’ve got a crowd. Thank you for the recipe.

Just as promised, yummy chocolate cake! Super easy & fast---from prep to cool less than an hour! I didn't have buttermilk so subbed by "making" with milk & lemon juice. Definitely a keeper!

Very nice sheet cake, easy to make and the pecans added a special flavour. I added a bit more cocoa to make it more chocolatey. I´ll definitely be making it again!

Delicious! I love chocolate sheet cake! Perfect for when I want cake NOW and don't want to wait for cold butter to soften. I cut this recipe down to 1/3 so it would fit in a 9 x 9 square pan. There's just two of us and we like chocolate cake, just not a whole jelly roll pan worth! I made this recipe as directed other than cutting the recipe down to a third. I used a dark cocoa because chocolate sheet cake tends to be light on the chocolate flavor. The result was decadent but not too dark, rich, or overpowering.

Made this and a white sheet cake for my poppa's 80th party. It turned out so tasty and moist. I added a little bit more cocoa and baked it in a 9x13 pan, didn't take much longer to bake. Only used 4 cups of sugar for the icing. Very minor things and will for sure make it again.
