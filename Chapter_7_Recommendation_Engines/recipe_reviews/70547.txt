I really liked this recipe. It's nothing fancy really, but the flavours are good. The only change I made was using cheddar instead of motzza. Very tasty when grilled on the BBQ :)

These burgers are DELICIOUS!!! The only thing I would change was to use a little bit less than 1/4 cup of A1. The perfect part about these burgers are that you can grill them to well done (and I normally eat medium rare) but they are still incredibly juicy. I make these every week!!

I make these every once in a while when I'm in the mood for a 'steak-type' burger. They are very tasty as is, but sometimes I'll add a little finely chopped or grated onion for a little extra something. I love topping these with sauteed mushrooms and onions and usually just use whatever cheese I have on hand (swiss is great). I've never had a problem with them falling apart or anything, but I also do not measure the breadcrumbs, just eyeball it and mix with my hands to get the right consistancy. All in all, a very nice, simple and tasty burger! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe was pretty good!  The burgers did try to fall apart on me after I flipped them.  Next time I would add a few more seasonings to the beef mixture for more taste and maybe a little more A-1 sauce!

These burgers turned out great and were so easy to make. We have made them on the grill and indoors too and both ways were good.

My first reaction was I didn't like the taste. After I had  a few more bites, they were ok. My son liked them-- they were pretty mushy. Alittle hard to grill. Should add more bread crumbs but I will not make again.

This is an awesome recipe for super moist tasty burgers.  I, however, use 1/4 cup marinara sauce instead of steak sauce and put the burgers on sourdough buns for an Italian themed grilling night or I'll use a 1/4 cup of a smokier tasting cheese like Gouda and bread crumbs with no seasoning if I use the steak sauce.  That way I don't end up with competing flavors.

Pretty good. The flavor was a little bland so I added some salt and pepper after cooking, and sprinkled some more mozzarella on top. Definitely not the right structure for burgers, so I ate it more as a mini meatloaf. All in all, I'd make it again.

It's not my favorite burger recipe, but it was very good.  I used ground buffalo instead of beef, it worked out great.  I added chopped onion to the burger before cooking.  I think I would use this recipe again.

I thought the burger was great, but the rest of my family found it a bit too "soggy" or soft and didn't think it was spectacular.

Not bad. Definitely cook these on foil though. Mine fell apart as soon as I touched them. Other than that they were great!

These burgers are good, but they started to fall apart when I turned them over.  They were moist and juicy and my husband liked them a lot.  Not as good as some others I have tried but if you like the flavor of A-One, you'll like these.

These burgers really seemed promising based on the ingredients, but they were not what I was expecting at all. They tasted fine, but they tasted like meatloaf and crumbled really easily. I don't cook often and I realize that this may have been my fault, but I followed the recipe exactly. All in all, this wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either.

I made these last night, following the recipe exactly and I have to say these are not one of my family's favorites - my kids, 17- 11 1/2 & 10 - tasted but would not eat these.  I love A-1 sauce and thought these would be terrific. They weren't so great.  They're not good enough to make again.

We loved the flavor of these burgers! I didn't have italian breadcrumbs, so I used plain and added some oregano, basil, parsley, garlic powder, and onion salt.  I forgot to follow other's tips to grill them on foil... I won't forget next time!  They did kind of fall apart, but they still tasted very yummy!

this is the best burger recipe we have ever tried...and we have tried a lot!  I make this for a cookout and everyone took home the recipe.  In fact I had someone call me several days later that said they hear how great my burgers are and wanted to know the recipe as well!!!

This burger was absolutely delicious.  The only problem that I had was that they fell apart when I was trying to grill them, but I'm sure that was my fault.  Great recipe! Definitely worth a try!

Great burgers!  Came out juicy and very flavorful.  Also did a little twist one time and instead of using Steak Sauce cooked them up with a honey BBQ Sauce and was also fantastic!

I really liked this recipe, and my husband did also. It was great because these hamburgers used items that we already had around so we didn't have to buy anything extra. We used onion buns which complemented the meat nicely. We also didn't have an issue with them falling apart like it sounds like other people did, but we didn't measure everything exactly as the recipe said, just added enough ingredients to keep everything together. The steak sauce gave them a nice little kick but it wasn't anything too spicy by any means. Since we liked these a lot I'm sure we will be making them again, thanks for the recipe, ANDREWSBUNCH.

These were pretty good and I bet they would be even better on the grill!  I used taco cheese in these and seasoned with Lawrey's seasoned salt and black pepper.  Served on onion rolls with melted colby cheese and more A-1, of course! Thanks for the recipe.

Overall it is an easy and fair tasting burger. Next time I make them I will add a little more cheese and I may even change it to a Chedder.

The a-1 sauce was a little over-powering for our taste.  I'll probably keep looking as far as hamburger recipes goes.  Thanks anyway!
