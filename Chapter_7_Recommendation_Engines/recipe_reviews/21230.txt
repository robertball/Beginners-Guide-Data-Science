I have never had anything but raves about this recipe.  I have made it several times now.  I usually make a whole recipe and freeze half for later use.  
The meat has a strong peanutty taste.  You can adjust the heat easily and I tend to make mine mild since it must be child friendly.  I will usually serve over rice for a main dish with vegies.  
I have tried cooking it several ways.  Outdoor grill stuck and the meat fell off the skewers.  Indoor grill (George Forman) worked great if you are only doing a few.  Oven works good for a large batch, but I have never had much luck broiling anything, so some were a little under done.  The last time I stir-fried in a wok.  This is the method I will use from now on.  All the meat was cooked and none was dried out or under done.

Fantastic!  I thought this would steal the show in the dinner I prepared. I used strips and skewered these rather than cubes, but that won't change anything. Definately one for the archives!

TOO SALTY!  Rinse the peanuts 3 times if they are salted, then dry them with paper towels and dry roast them in a medium hot pan for 4 to 7 minutes, shaking the pan several times, until the nuts are no longer steaming and begin to aquire a color.  Use low sodium Soy Sauce.  

But this recipe was delicious.  The green onions were a delightful note.  If you can grab your hands on 1 tbs of dried lemon grass and 1 tsp of fish sauce (in addition to removing the salt from the peanuts) you'd be giving yourself a treat indeed!

I made a double recipe for a large gathering, but had to make it in 2 batches because of blender capacity.  However - it was well worth the trouble.  Everyone raved, and I'm planning on making this again very soon!  I highly recommend it.

"This is FABULOUS!!!"  Those are the exact words out of my husband's shocked mouth the second he took a bite.  I too did not read ahead and didn't realize that it needed to marinate.  Went out for dinner last night and it was so worth it to let it sit over night.  Didn't cube my pork, I cut my loin into very thin chops.  That was the only difference in what I did for the most part.  One half of my grill cooks hotter, so a few of them were slightly burnt.  This changes the flavor altogether and is enjoyable also.  My daughter that won't touch food that has the smallest hint of black on it, wouldn't trade in her burnt piece.  We used our cook marinade for our rice instead of dipping our pork in it.

This was so awesome. I made it last nite and my 4 kids devoured it. I was surprised there was any left (I even doubled the recipe), but they argued over who got the left overs. Totally yummy, totally easy. 5 stars, for sure. I served it with pad thai, it was perfect. I baked it (its winter here) at 450 for about 8 minutes. It was nicely done.

Great recipe.  I made it for an Asian themed dinner party & everyone had seconds.  It is a bit salty so use either unsalted peanuts or low sodium soy sauce.  I expected it to be a bit spicy b/c of the pepper flakes, but it wasn't.  If you like it hotter, add more pepper flakes.  I also made it with both chicken & pork & both were yummy.

Delicious!  Served this for the first time with company over and it was gobbled up.  I marinated all day and then cooked it in a pan with some of the sauce. I didn't use the rest of the sauce. Thank you!

I substituted 1 cup low fat, chunky peanut butter for the peanuts, left out the butter completely, and used 1/2 c. low sodium vegetable broth and a scant 1/2 c. low sodium soy sauce to reduce both the fat and sodium content.  The sauce was a nice consistency and had good flavor.  I reserved 1 cup for dipping sauce and used the remainder to marinate the pork. That way, I could quickly heat the dipping sauce in the microwave without having to worry about boiling it for safety after being in contact with the raw meat.

I should have heeded Quadon's advice.  It WAS way too salty but seemed great if I could just get past the saltiness.  Next time I will definitely use low sodium soy sauce, unsalted peanuts and unsalted butter.  It still should have enough flavor with everything else.

Wonderful!  I used pork loin chops and grilled them whole.  We added a little more red pepper flakes to make it spicer.  The sauce was good over rice.  Next time I will cut the butter by 1/2.

Excellent dish. I recommend doubling the Marinade to use later, well worth the trouble.

Absolutely fabulous!  I made these on a night when it was too cold to grill, so I put these in the broiler for 20 minutes (turning the kabobs once) and they came out great.  I did not boil the sauce for dipping, as I thought it might be overpowering, but these were still wonderful

We loved this!  I cooked it under the broiler on skewers (approx. 8 mins, turning once) because it was too cold and dark to grill.  They were tender and delicious, not too salty, and they heated up well the next day.  We served it with coconut rice and fruit.  It is one of my husband's new favorites!

I did make a few changes, but it came out great. Also good with chicken breasts. I used 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of chopping peanuts in a food processor. Then, I added the other ingredients. I reduced the soy sauce, as suggested by other reviewers and found it to be just right. We loved this dish.

This is a delicious dish! I too substituted the almonds for 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I marinated for the recommended time (6hrs), grilled it, and I was surprised at the results. My friends and family loved it! Thank you!

I made this for our Asian themed cooking club.  Everyone was dubious when I told them what it was and how it was prepared. But when they tasted it all skepticism went out the window.  Even a friend who claimed not to like peanuts liked it.  DEELISH! - Definitley a winner!  I adjusted the heat and used unsalted peanuts as per other suggestions.

Delicious! I used low sodium soy sauce and broth and unsalted butter and didn't think the dish was too salty. We grilled them whole, did not skewer. I boiled the marinade to make a nice topping, which was a tad spicy but delicious. I subbed dry roasted Virginia peanuts for the spanish. I think that this is a keeper! Thanks for the post!

I love pork satay and tried this recipe, but according to my Indonesian tongue it was still missing something... Tried adding one whole red onion and 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was better. I didnt know what Spanish peanuts was so I used kemiri instead. (asked a mom's friend who makes terrific satay and she told me to use kemiri nuts. Eum, I think the english word for kemiri is candle nuts)

I added a little more red pepper than the recipe called for, and left out the butter and chicken broth (since I didn't have them at home) -- but my husband thought it was great (nice and SPICY).  The recipe was easy to prepare, and tasted great hot off the grill (we made pork chops as an entree, not an appetizer).  Great job, Debbie!  Thanks.

I made marinade for the pork but omitted the butter, used veg broth & used 1/2 C peanut butter instead of peanuts & didn't use a blender. I put the pork under the broiler for 4 mins each side & threw it into 'Peanut Butter Noodles' from this side. The sauce kinda burned the pan so grilling or stir frying is prob best. Thanks.

I forgot some of the marinade for dipping but this was still a good recipe. I didn’t use Spanish peanuts, rather I used just regular salted peanuts. Instead of crushed coriander seed I used cilantro leaves. I served this with a Rice-a-Roni asian flavored rice.

This was very salty, but I did use regular soy sauce since it was on hand.  Next time I'll use lite and possibly reduce the the amount.  I did rinse the peanuts to remove the salt and oven roasted them.  The flavor was pretty good, I plan on making them again in hopes of making them less salty.

Really good.  My kids wouldn't touch it, but the adults loved it.  I didn't realize until mid-afternoon that this was to be marinated (I'm terrible at prep in advance!) so I cheated and baked the pork in the marinade.  It turned out really good despite my lack of reading the instructions!  Next time, we'll grill it and follow the recipe!  Thanks so much!

I found that the salted peanuts in combination with the soy sauce made this recipe a little salty.  I've made easier Satay recipes that I felt had a better flavor. One thing I never tried in my recipe was the use of fresh ginger. It DOES make a BIG difference.  I'll never use dried ginger again! (Thanks, Debbie!) Though I probably won't make this version again, it wasn't bad.  But, I'll opt for my own recipe in the future (using fresh ginger instead of dry).

This is a great recipe and from what I remember from my Indonesian friend's Satay, very authentic.

This was great. I didn't have a grill handy, so I put it in the broiler on high for 4 minutes on each side. Very, very good.

Super-tasty!  Easy and fun. It was lots of fun to make the marinade.  It made a gigantic mess because I used the little food processor that attaches to my blender.  1 Recipe of marinade makes about 2 1/8 cups. I had the butcher cube up the meat so that saves tons of time. My husband said it almost had too much flavor, but with some rice and other sides, DEELICIOUS! 8/06 - we've had this 3 times in our freezer food exchange group and all 5 families love it (even with little kids).  One of them calls it Sat-YAY!

Great addition to my recipe collection! Both my husband and 4 year old loved this entree - I made it with chicken and used regular dry roasted peanuts instead of spanish peanuts.

Really delish.  One of the best I've tried.  I don't usually use the broiler much, but this makes great use of it.  The only suggestion is add some time under the heat (9-10 minutes after flipping).  Also next time I will halve the soy sauce and add one red chili pepper for some needed heat.  Truly restaurant quality!

Delicious.  We didn't need any of the remaining sauce for dipping; the flavor was already strong.  Slightly more salty than perfection in my view, so next time I will use reduced-sodium soy sauce.

This came out very tasty and the family ate it up.  Our grill was down so I ended up cooking it in a wok.  I wouldn't do the next time even though it came out just fine.

We loved this. I would consider using 1/2 regular soy sauce and 1/2 low sodium. I substituted ground fennel for the coriander an did not have fresh ginger at the time, using 1/8 tsp dried, ground ginger instead.  Will make again.

Very very yummy! I didn't have any peanuts on hand so I used a very scant cup of peanut butter and did cut back about a 1/4 c of soy sauce. It was really windy here today so we grilled these on the indoor grill and basted as directed something I would make again and I'm not much of a pork fan so that really speaks volumes.

The marinade made a decent amount and I was able to marinate more than 1.5# just fine....maybe around 2# of pork loin.  I didn't feel like putting them on skewers, and I can only imagine they would be deicious that way, but I just lined them all up on a large cookie sheet and baked them.  I think the oven was somewhere between 350-375 for 10-15 mins, flipping halfway.  Yum!!  The peanut texture is great, and it seemed these tasted even better the next day.

This is absolutely delicious.  I did as others did and used peanut butter instead of peanuts - I had none in the house. And I used a white onion as I had no gr. onions either.  I put the ingredients in my food processor as opposed to the Blender.  Worked perfectly.  Served with long grain rice and Bacon-y Bok Choy from this site. Boiled up some of the remaining marinade as extra at the table . Fabulous meal.  I should note that I used half of one pork tenderloin and this was quite enough for a meal for the two of us.  So one tenderloin will serve 4 people quite nicely with the appropriate side dishes.  My husband is still raving about the meal.

LOVED the meat, not the sauce.  My husband raved! One caveat - you do need to like salty things, which we do.  Suggestion:  since we didn't care for the sauce (the boiled marinade), next time I would marinate double the meat or make half the marinade.  I used a no cook peanut sauce from this site that another reviewer recommended - it was fast and delicious.  We'll have this again and again.

This recipe is fine.  it won't set the world afire but it shouldn't draw any gripes from an eater that would like this sort of dish either.  I was concerned that it might be too salty because of some of the reviews so i used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium chicken bone stock.  Salt was an issue with my make- it was lacking. But I feel lucky in that it allowed me to add some high protein fish sauce.  My lemons were not juicy so I subbed in some rice wine vinegar to compensate.  Later, I wen t to the store and bought some limes and added lime juice to adjust brightness a bit plus it seemed like it needed lime to me.

In the end, this is an acceptable recipe, pretty good taste.  I would go about it differently next time.  It would be more handling but probably not too much more time, the flavors would be more layered and one  could tweak the balance more easily.

Delicious. I made one serving with Naan and made a wrap with lettuce, extra sauce, and goat cheese. The second serving for dinner I made rice and served it over rice with sauce drizzled on top.

I omitted the honey (not a fan) and the butter, which probably tastes amazing, but too many calories.  I stir fried it with lots of veggies and it was very tasty!  I think grilling it would be divine and will definitely try it when the weather warms up.

Wow! This was awesome. I almost didn't make it because of the picture. We prefer our pork with a fair amount of pink which I was able to achieve in about 10 minutes on the grill. I followed the recipe, marinating overnight, but added a splash of peanut oil and cumin to the marinade. Will definitely make again. Served with nasi gorung and Indonesian cucumber salad.

Our family really loved this recipe, i used cashews instead of peanuts because thats what I had, and we bbq them and brushed with a little bbq sauce as well.  I will try with peanuts next time to see the difference but as it was we loved it.

Wow, was this ever delicious!   My family went crazy for it.  I grilled it with Vidalia onions between the pork.  Would be good with tomatoes too.  The sauce was fantastic and the marinade gave the pork a wonderful texture and flavor.  I will definitely make it again.  Next time I am going to try to cut the butter in half, maybe adding more broth for volume.

Great recipe, easy to follow. I used pork ribs and marinated them over night. They were very tasty.
I asked my partner which recipe he wanted with his lamb ribs tomorrow and he requested this one over any other suggestions. We will stay with this recipe for all our ribs. 

The only alteration I did was to dry roast a cup of fresh peanuts in a non stick fry pan instead of salted Spanish ones.

Impressed the heck out of "we love BBQ" friends! I'll make this again for sure. I used thinly sliced pork cutlets and threaded on to metal skewers I oiled first. Worked great. Serve with white coconut rice (jasmine if available) and stir fried carrot sticks.

The whole family loved this! From Daddy down to the babies! We added the marinade and some seame seeds to some green beans for a side and boiled the marinade (added a bit of cornstarch to thicken) to coat and served this over rice. Delicious!

J'ai mis moitie arachides et moitie beurre d'arachide. Quand meme sale ... mettre moins de sauce soya la prochaine fois ...  sauce assez epaisse ... peut-etre dilue sauce soya avec eau ou bouillon poulet non sale?
