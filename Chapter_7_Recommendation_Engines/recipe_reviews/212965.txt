Okay, let me just state for the record that I can NOT make omelets. I have watched videos online, and put those methods into practice. It just doesn't work for me. With that being said, please forgive my photo of this recipe. As far as the recipe goes, it is delicious. I love the incorporation of the potatoes in this omelet. I used Egg Beaters (gotta watch that ol' cholesterol), and omitted the salt, peas, and raisins, as I don't care for any of those things.  Oh, and I also used imitation crabmeat, as that's what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe lola.
