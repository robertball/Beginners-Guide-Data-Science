I had to change a lot of things with this recipe, but it was worth it!  All of the revisions came from other reviewer suggestions :)  I made taco seasoned ground beef, then added the tomatoes and since the meat was seasoned I added no salt and just a pinch of sugar.  I changed the layers, as suggested, and put the noodles on the bottom,hamburger next, cream mixture next (an ounce more cream cheese, 1/2 c more sour cream), then cheddar cheese.  I covered with foil for first half the cooking time and removed it for the second half.  It was truly DELICIOUS once it was made with the CHANGES.  I have a picky husband & 4 year old and they both gobbled it up and had seconds!  It was just as good rewarmed the next day!

I have been cooking this recipe for years.  I remember it being one of the first things I ever made that didn't come out of a box and it's been a family favorite ever since.

I will say that my recipe varies slightly.  I use 3 green onions instead of regular and mix it with 2 cups sour cream and 8 oz cream cheese in a separate bowl.  I also use 16 oz of tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and mix with ground beef, a can of corn, 1 tsp sugar and salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper and Worcestershire sauce.  I then layer   (repeatedly and in this order) the cooked noodles, beef mixture, and the cream cheese mixture.  I then top with a lot of cheddar cheese and bake until it bubbles (about 30 minutes).

After reading the reviews, the best things are to;
1) Add 1oz more cream cheese& 1/2 cup more sour cream
2) Add 1/2 of the onions to beef while frying
3) Season beef well
4) Cover with foil
Layer like recipe calls for and it is a excellent dish. My family (who are picky eaters) wanted me to make it again the next week! It is also very easy to make. Send us more recipes like it!!!

This is an all over good meal.  I made it the way it was written the first time and we rated it an 7.  The second time I made it I added chopped garlic with the onion mix and tabasco sauce as well.  I also seasoned the meat before cooking.  I mixed the meat with the cheese mixture and the noodles as well then topped with twice the amount of cheese.  That way the we werent just getting a hunk of noodles with cheese melted on.  It turned out good.  The second time we rated it a 10!

My husband loved it!  I went by other reviews adding tomato sauce.  I think I will add some more tomato sauce next time.  I also added the onions to the meat mixture.  I covered with foil and added cheese to the top (on top of cream cheese mixture).  
Will make again!

I've made this recipe twice and its been great both!  The first time based on other reviews, I made it mexican. I mixed the onions in with the meat and added some taco seasoning and salsa.  I did use 8 oz of cream cheese and sour cream and 16 oz of noodles so I had to make a 9x9 pan too, but my husband pulled that out of the freezer for lunch 2 days later.  
I did almost the same thing the second time but I made it Italian.  I used Spaghetti sauce and topped with Mozzeralla cheese.  The noodles on the top of this one were crunchy so next time I'll layer them on the bottom only.
My family and I loved this recipe and  I look forward to playing with it more.
                                                                                  /(6/17 addition)        
Okay This recipe has been a staple in our house for 2 years now.  I have enjoyed it so much that I don't have to look at the recipe anymore, not that I follow the recipe exactly either.  I mixed black beans in with the meat the last time I made this because I didn't have enough meat and it was probably the best yet.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty good recipe.  This has made it to my recipe box, but I added notes.  I put in some oregano and never make this recipe without corn.  Something about the cream and the corn coming together make this even more appetizing.  Thanks for giving me ideas with this one.

This recipe is great. I have made it numerous times (the hubby insists I make it at least once a month!) and have made a few minor changes.  

Firstly, I use 2 lbs. of meat, 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef and 1/2 lb. locally homemade hot sausage.  

I saute the onions with the meat mixture instead of adding it to the cream cheese mixture and use double the amount of diced tomatoes.  

I also use a whole 16 oz. container of sour cream and the whole 8 oz. container of cream cheese.  I also use about 1/2 cup more of the cheddar on top.

The best and most flavorful change I made, however, was adding a package of dried onion soup mix to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  I did this the very first time I made it and it turned out great.  I tried it once without it because I didn't have any on hand and the dish just wasn't the same.

In all, a great recipe.  The hubby's buddies now flock to my house when they find out I'm making it, so I have to make 2 batches every time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was really good, an interesting combination of ingredients that works well together.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and put all the noodles at the bottom.  Also, right before I put the topping on top of the casserole I mixed in the cream cheese and sour cream blend. It helped the consistency and also helped break up the cream cheese as it is hard to stir in evenly.  One thing I will change next time is to saute the onions in with the ground beef.  Otherwise they stay crunchy and taste more like a raw onion.

This recipe was too dry, it has a great flavor - just needs more sauce. I would also put all pasta in the bottom rather than more on top (the top layer dries out and becomes crunchy/chewy while baking). I still have leftovers left! Must revise this one before making it again!

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't much care for it.  My husband doesn't like spicey so thought I would try this.  Something about the cream cheese/sourcream layer just put me off.  Funcky flavor combo, I won't make this again.

This was an easy recipe to make.  I utilized other reviews and used sausage and beef.  I added garlic and onion while the meat was browning and with the tomatoes added worchestersire and a bit of beer. I also used 8oz of cream cheese and only 8oz of sour cream. I would not layer the ingredients, but mix it casserole style.  Boyfriend liked it so I'll make it again.

My  husband  really  enjoyed  this  dish, I did  find  my  noodles  got  a bit  dry and  hard on  top, so  I  may reduce  baking  time when  i  make  it  again. Thank  you  for the  recipe.

This recipe could be a whole lot better.  It needed some "kick".  Shame on me for not reading the reviews before making it last time.
This time I put 1 pkg of taco mix to the meat mixture before simmering it.  I also added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar and some onion to the meat mixture.  
It seemed to help considerably.

This recipe was excellent. My husband and my kids loved it. I added 1 can of condensed cheddar cheese soup to the sour cream & cream cheese mixture, as well as 1 cup of milk. I used elbow noodles, and I used two cans of Rotel tomatoes for extra zip rather than plain tomatoes. I will definately make it again. Thanks!

Really good. Will make again. The hubby suggested making it without the noodles and eat as a dip. He's a big dip person! I also used a bag  spicy shredded cheese on the top. I think it would have been a bit bland for our family had I used regular cheddar.

I've been making this for years and it is SUCH good comfort food - just make sure the cream cheese is super soft so it will combine well with the sour cream. Also I use green onion (tops and bottoms) instead of regular onion. I have layered it as the recipe suggests and I have also used a smaller oval dish and used more layers - no matter what it always turns out great. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a decent basic recipe, however, I would NOT suggest making it as is, or you'll just have an unseasoned pile of slop!  It is also rather time consuming for what it is and thus, though when I severely doctored it up my husband liked it...when I told him it took me as long a nice lasagna would take, he asked me to "in the future, stick with the lasagna."  I think that should say it all for this review.  Not bad, not great...mediocre if unseasoned, but good if properly modified.

Though I hesitate to say it was my husband's "delight," we did both think this was pretty good. However, our almost-4-year-old was not at all impressed and didn't finish even half her small portion. We think perhaps it was the sour cream/cream cheese layer that put her off; it has nearly the same consistency and taste as ricotta cheese when cooked, so if you're not a ricotta fan, this is probably not the dish for you. Perhaps we'll try this again when our daughter's palate is a little more sophisticated. (For the record, I prepared it exactly as the recipe directs, with no modifications.)

This was a hit with my entire family!  Not an easy task with 5 kids.  My DH asked what it was called, and heartily agreed.
I did make a few changes, though, both in recipe size and ingredients.  I used 2 lbs of ground beef & 2 boxes of whole grain rotini (about 27 oz).
I always season my ground beef while browning, usually with salt, pepper, onion, and garlic, to taste.
After draining the fat, I added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper, 1 can diced tomatoes, and 1 8oz can tomato sauce.
I also added 1/2 bag frozen, chopped spinach, which I do to a lot of dishes.
I used a 16oz container of light sour cream and 4oz of low-fat cream cheese. I also chopped up a few green onions, since I had them on hand, and threw them in.
  I mixed everything together, including pasta, then put it in 2 pans and topped with 2 cups of fiesta blend cheese.
I have made it in layers before and mixing it all together seems to work better for us.

This is a good, easy meal.  I cooked the onion along with the ground beef and also added a tablespoon of minced garlic.  Other reviews had suggested adding a small can of tomato sauce, I only had a 15oz can on hand, for fear that it may be too much and end up runny, I drained the juice form the tomatoes, this ended up being a very good amount.  I also added oregano, thyme and black pepper to the tomato mixture.  I put 1/3 of the tomato mixture on the bottom of the pan, then all the noodles and then the rest of the tomato mixture.  I also used marble jack cheese instead of cheddar.

I've been cooking this casserole for years and I haven't had a complaint yet.  Put a little of the meat mixture (I use spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce)on the bottom of the pan before adding the noodles.  For the cream mixture I use cream cheese, sour cream, and cream of mushroom.  It mixes easier and is creamier.  And don't put anymore noodles on top.

I followed the reviewers' suggestions and put the pasta at the bottom and cooked the onions with the beef and added more tomato sauce. The casserole came out just fine - the taste was okay. I really didn't like how much cream cheese there was - a little too strong for me. Next time, I'll try reducing the cream cheese and adding even more tomato sauce to the beef.

Wonderful recipe. I used low-fat sour cream, and never missed a thing. I also added crushed garlic & butter croutons on the top, and drizzled melted butter on top. Additionally, I took the advice of another reviewer and put all the noodles on the bottom of the casserole, then layered accordingly on top of them. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was pretty good, not a favorite of mine, but my boyfriend and dad loved it, and they are very picky eaters.. For some reason the sour cream and cream cheese ended up a little dry after baking it, I will use an extra can of stewed tomatos next time. Overall though, it was pretty good. :)

Very good! My hubby (former farmboy) commented that he liked this dish! However, he suggested cutting back on the cream cheese which I agree with.

All I can say is WOW! This was AMAZING!! I was supper excited to try this out because my fiancee is a farm boy. I'm not a huge fan of ground beef, but the hint of sugar really topped it! I did my own twist and layered with: beef, shredded cheese, noodles, cream cheese mixture, then repeat, finishing with shredded cheese on top, and sprinkles some basil on top as an added touch! I will definitely include this in our weekly meal plans!

Pretty good. I would cut the cream cheese down, add more tomato sauce with seasoning, mix it all together, top with cheese then bake.

I rate this 5 starts because my husband loves it so much.  Seriously, I cook a lot of awesome stuff, but this is the one my husband remembers..maybe bc it has a name..  anyway, i use diced tomates w/chilies, don't use the cream cheese (just more sour cream) I don't layer the sour cream in, I mix it with my cooked noodles. then layer the noodles, beef/tomato mixture, cheese & repeat. i like to chop up green onions to spread over the top and throw in a bit of garlic powder.  it's not the best recipe I have by far, but for how much my husband loves it and how easy it is..you can't go wrong  oh i cook the reg onion in with the ground beef once it's about half done..this helps when your onions aren't quite as sweet

Instead of using tomatoes, I used pizza sauce and yellow onions. I topped it with half cup fancy shredded cheddar cheese and half cup of fancy shredded mozzerella. THis was a very great recipe for a quick meal.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. He's diabetic, so we used Dreamfields penne pasta (it's pasta that has no impact on blood sugar) and lowfat cream cheese, sour cream and cheddar cheese.  I also sauteed the onions with the beef.  Even with these lowfat ingredients, it was very tasty.

Upon closer inspection I discovered that my cream cheese was a science experiment gone awry.  lol so I adjusted the recipe and made it anyway.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the meat with the onions to cook.  I mixed oregano, garlic salt and about a 1/4c mozzerella cheese with the sour cream.  I sprinkled a litle garlic salt and another 1/4 cup of mozzerella on top of the noodles themselves. I layered everything as suggested and topped it with sharp cheddar cheese.  Everyone loved it.  I suspect it would be great with the cream cheese also!  I WILL make this again.

Excellent with some few changes like others did: I sauteed the onions with only 1 lb ground beef, added 1/2 a package (2 Tbsp) taco seasoning and about 2/3 cup water. I added 8 oz can tomato sauce also. I layered noodles on bottom, then cream cheese/sour cream mixture, then ground beef mixture, then cheese. After I baked it covered for 15 minutes and then uncovered for 15 minutes, I also put the oven on broil and melted the cheese even more.

Excellent recipe except I tweaked it a bit from reading other reviews... I used 2 cans of Rotel for the tomatoes to spice it up, sauteed the onions with the hamburger, used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup with 1/2 cup sour cream and 3 ounces of cream cheese.  I put a little bit of the meat mixture on the bottom of the pan, all the noodles, all the creamy mixture then topped it off with some sharp cheddar and VIOLA, it was fantastic.  My husband couldn't stop eating it!

Used spaghetti instead of egg noodles, 2 lbs of ground beef, spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes, added  garlic and creole seasoning to the meat, and omitted the onion.  This is fantastic!  It is a rich and creamy spaghetti dish.  This dish will be made again and again.

I took several reviewers advice and loved this recipe.  My whole family loved it.  I used macaroni noodles instead of egg noodles.  I added a can of tomato sauce and I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, and a little extra cream cheese.  I also mixed it all together and sauted the onions and I have to say it was delicious.  I will make it again for sure.

We've been making this excellent recipe for years.  I just came across it again and felt I should finally review it!

We've served this meal to everyone we know and they all love it.  The only change I made is that I don't put any noodles on top -- they tend to dry out a bit when they aren't covered completely.  I put them all on the bottom.

The cream cheese mixture is SO good because of the onion crunch.  Even with 2 or 3 of us, we barely have leftovers!

Very Good! I did make a lot of changes because i didn't have everything. I used the leftover taco meat from the night before and added spaghetti(?) sauce, about 1/2 cup sour cream, onion and lots of cheese. After reading the reviews i could not decide about the onions so I cooked half and left the other half raw. I mixed everything together adding milk until i got the mixture looking the way i wanted it to. I wrapped it in foil. the last 10 min. i took the foil off and added more cheese on top. WOW! Very Good!

Thanks to the reviewers! I added the small can of tomato sauce to the meat mixture (definitely glad I did), and layered 1/2 the noodles, the meat mixture, the other 1/2 noodles, then cream mixture to avoid dry noodles on top. Doubled the cheese, and also cooked onions with meat (microwaved the ground beef & onions, then nuked with the tomatoes and sauce for 4 minutes to save a little effort). Great, easy combination! Husband wasn't delighted, but was definitely satisfied. Will make again!

I thought it was really good. It's like a homemade version of hamburger helper. A few suggestions to make it even better would be: saute the onions in the ground beef instead of just adding them to the cream mixture(I followed the recipe and the onion was crunchy and very strong tasting because they didn't have enough time to cook)also make sure the can of diced tomato that you buy does have alot of juice or it will be a little dry and add more cheese on top than called for in original recipe. My family liked it and I will make it again with my own changes.

Good stuff! I'd bump it up to 2lbs of ground beef, though. It needs a little more to balance out all the rest of the ingredients.

yummy yummy!! I took some of the others suggestions, I use taco seasoning in the meat, and I also cook the onion.Instead of canned tomato, I throw a can of Rotella in there.  I have also added half a can of Cheddar soup. I am asked to make this every week.

This is a very yummy recipe.  My family really likes it.  The only problem was that my family thought it had too much onion, so the next time I cut back on the onion.  I usually make two dishes of this at the same time.  I'll prepare them both up to the last step of cooking and take one to a friend or freeze it for later.  The last time I made this I was short about 1/2 cup sour cream so I mixed in 1/4 cup milk with my sour cream and it made it creamier.  It was very yummy.  I hope my review helps someone else.

Great potential.  I did what another reviewer suggested and I made taco seasoned ground beef.  I also added some frozen corn in with the tomatoes and simmered for 12min.  I don't know if my measurements were off a little, but next time I won't use as many noodles.  Overall, very tasty.

This just wasn't very good. I tried all of the suggestions, and they didn't help. My husband thought it was ok. Thanks for at least something different one night. Won't make again, sorry.

My family really didn't find this dish to be that "Delightful"....I spiced up the ground beef with Italian spices, garlic, and salt and pepper which definitely helped the dish.  And layered all the noodles on the bottom, as others suggested, but overall it was still just OK, I probably won't make it again.

Awesome!!  I made a few changes based on what I had available:  I used 8 oz of sour cream and 8 oz of cream cheese instead of the amounts called for.  Also, I sauted the onions before mixing into the cream mixture.  Finally, all I had left was 1/2 of a 16 oz. bag of egg noodles, so I used that (8 oz) instead of 10 oz.  This is definitely a keeper!

I read the reviews before making this dish, and wasn't sure if we were going to like it.  It turned out great.  I like the taste of the onions, it does give it a little kick.  This is a recipe that we will use over and over.  Thanks!

I wasn't fond of this right out of the oven.  But I enjoy left-overs and each day in the microwave, it was more flavorful and then, an empty dish.  My teen son didn't like it all.  I think it would be a good recipe to add to and make it a more personal creation, a mexican flavor came to mind for me. I thought some taco seasoning, diced tomatoes and chiles instead and some black olives would be a good variation.  I have already passed it on to others.  Thank you for sharing!

Have made this about 8X now, just the way Cathy wrote it and it's great. No reason to make any changes. (unless you're out of cheddar, any kind of cheese is fine) While I'm not a fan of this kind of meal (American chop suey, shepards pie ie.1 pan of thrown together stuff) I love this!

I tried all the high rated suggestions even tried it the way the original receipe calls for it but each time it just wasn't good. My husband ate it but I could not finish it. Won't be making this again. One of the recipes that look great on paper until you put it in your mouth.

This is delicious! I added green beans and some fresh mushrooms. I used the au jus left over from slow cooking the roast with onions, and thickened it with some cornstarch. I added more of the thickened au jus than 1/2 cup as I wanted everything to be moistened. With cheddar cheese on top, this meal was to die for! I may try making it with refrigerator biscuits instead of the mashed potatoes for a different twist.

This is a nice basic recipe that is tasty "as is" but is truly great when you modify it to suit your own family's preferences. I used red bell pepper, tomato sauce (instead of diced), Worcestershire, garlic, pepper, and onions in the meat sauce and then added green onions (instead of regular onions) to the cream cheese mixture. Nice, simple, tasty comfort food!

This has quickly become a family favorite. This tastes even better the next day. I do cook the onions with the ground beef, as someone else suggested....but otherwise, no changes. Thanks so much for such an easy, inexpensive, and delicious recipe!

This recipe is DELICOUS *but* it's also extremely high calorie, because of this I've only made it twice and both time it was gone in an instant. If you can afford the extra calories then go for it!

I hate to rate this recipe a 1 star..but this was really awful. The cream cheese and sour cream made it so rich that it was hard to eat. I used reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream to cut down this very fattening dish. My boyfriend said it was the worst thing I have ever made him. I followed the directions exactly as printed.

I only gave this recipe a 4 because of the changes. I have been making a similar recipe for years.  I mix the sour cream and cream cheese with chopped green onions. Then I cook small elbow macaroni (seems to mix in better) and stir it into the cream cheese mixture and put in the bottom of a greased casserole.  I then brown the ground beef and season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Drain and add tomato sauce and sugar.  Pour that mixture over the noodles and top with cheddar cheese and cook in oven until heated and cheese is slightly brown.  (YUMMY)

We really liked this dish! Will definitely make again. Took other viewer's advice and doubled tomatoes for a moister result, put some meat mixture on bottom of pan, then noodles then creamy mixture, then rest of meat. This kept noodles soft. Husband says this recipe is well-named! Thanks!

This was FANTASTIC!  We made a few changes....  We didn't have the tomatoes or sugar, so we used about 1 cup of ketchup instead.  I was 1/2 cup short on sour cream, so I subbed cream cheese for the difference.  We didn't have cheddar, so we used American and Italian cheese on top.  I definitely want to make this again with the cheddar.  hah  Creamy, sweet, filling....This is a keeper in our home.

I'm only giving 4 stars because I changed some things. Good basic recipe. I added 1 can rotel and 1 can tomato paste. Used macaroni noodles instead of egg noodles. Sauteed onion with hamburger and added minced garlic. Also used pepper and worcestshire. Added season-all to sour cream/cream cheese mixture. Instead of layering I just mixed it all together and put it in casserole dish then topped with cheese. Next time I make this I think I'll also add some diced chili peppers.

We were not impressed with this recipe.  Definitely did not delight my husband, my children, or myself.

Overall a good recipe. All four boys and a picky husband liked it. Like others I placed all noodles in the bottom to prevent drying out and exchanged the paste for half a jar of spaghetti sauce. This dish is now a regular in our household.

This was one of the first recipes I made after moving away from home to college, mainly because it was cheap and easy to make! I still love it now, and its definitely a staple in my recipe box.

I thought it was pretty good.  I did add 12oz package of noodles instead of 10.  I also used tomatoes with green chilies and added garlic and crushed red pepper to the meat for some extra spice.  I probably would mix the sour cream mixture with the noodles instead of layering it.  I would also cover while baking since some of the top noodles were a bit crunchy.  Overall, I will make again.

I loved the flavor of this but not the consistency. I wish I had read the reviews first...because I would have added the tomato sauce and cooked the onions with the meat.  I'll try it again now for sure.

Good and filling.  Next time, though, I think I'll add some tomato sauce along with the canned diced tomatoes.  I'd like more of a saucy consistency.

Yuck!  We all ate one bite and I threw the rest in the garbage.  This is the first time I have ever given a 1 star rating and the first time I have actually gotten up from the dinner table and thrown away the food.  We ate leftovers instead.

I thought this turned out pretty good.  After working all day, I am always looking for quick and easy recipes, which makes this one a keeper.  It was so simple, even my wife could make it. :)  I followed other reviewers suggestions -- browned the meat with the onions, put all the pasta as the bottom layer, added green onions to the sour cream/cream cheese mix, etc. I also thought it was going to be too dry, so I added a can of tomato sauce to the meat and was glad I did. My wife said the taste was excellent, but she's not a huge egg noodle fan so she wasn't overly impressed. My picky three-year old daughter loved it (as did my 18-month old son, but he will eat anything).  Next time, I will scale the recipe back for a smaller casserole dish as we had a lot leftover and I will be eating this for lunch for a week.

Loved this!!  Took advice and browned onions with meat, used 8oz cream cheese and definately more shredded cheese on top.  Also mixed it all together and put tin foil on top for last 15 mins.  The only thing my bf suggested was that he would like the sour cream put on top after baking - so we will try that next time! Thanks for the recipe!!  I loved it!!

First recipe here I've really liked.  I used some of the suggestions and browned the beef with the onion.  Added green onions to the sour cream mixture.  I did layer noodles on top, and they did begin to dry out a bit, so I covered the pan with tin foil and they softened right up again.  After cooking, I poured a tomato-pesto sauce over the top for extra flavor, and it was perfect.  Will definitely make again!  (I should also add that I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream to cut calories and make fat.)

I thought this sounded pretty good and looked so easy, but we found it to be extremely bland and unfortunately ate less than half of it.

Very yummy!  I like that you add the onions to the sour cream mixture instead of while you are browning the beef....they hold up better and are more flavorful.  This is even better as left-overs!

I made this exactly as directed and I loved it.  I would never have thought to put those ingredients together but it was very good.  Sweet and tangy but hearty too.  I served it and kept asking FH if he liked it and he kept saying, I don’t know.  He eventually went back for seconds and said he liked it.  It was nice to get out of the same old thing for dinner rut.  Very different and delicious.  I think cooking the onions would cause them to lose flavor and texture.  In my opinion, keep them raw when you put them in the sour cream mixture.  They get cooked in the oven anyway but still turn out somewhat crunchy. It needs no other spices IMHO.  I did not find it dry or bland at all, contrary to other reviews.  Very zippy and yummy!

True to it's name, my husband did enjoy this recipe. I was out of sour cream, so instead I used 1 block light cream cheese, 1 cup cottage cheese and about a 1/4 cup cream. This worked well, it tasted great. As per the other suggestions, I added taco seasoning and corn. These were very good additions. Some people said their noodles burned to the bottom, I buttered the pan and the noodles turned out great. I also used fine egg noodles, which gave it a great texture. We really enjoyed this.

This was really good.  I did it a little differant I lightly buttered my noodles and added garlic and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture with the onions. Instead of plain cream cheese i added 6oz. of cream cheese with onion and chives the ones you buy for bagels. and doubled the cheese because we love cheese in this house.. it was a fast and great meal. thanks

My husband and I love this casserole!  It is easy to fix, and always turns out great!  The only change I made was to substitute spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes, salt, and sugar.  I strongly recommend this recipe!

Not good at all!  I thought it would be good from all the rave reviews????  I put all the noodles on the bottom (like many had suggested) and I used 2 cups of sour cream instead of the cream cheese (don't like cream cheese)and added more cheese to the top.  But the most disappointing part was the noodle part.  It was tasteless!  No sauce whatsoever, like eating plain noodles.  Did I do something wrong because I thought it would be better?????

Very good.  I followed other reviewers' advice and added taco seasoning.  I cooked the onion with the ground beef.  I omitted the sugar and the salt, and used 16 oz of egg noodles.  I also used pepper jack instead of cheddar.  Excellent rib-sticking comfort food.

This was pretty good.  I followed some of the previous suggestions of adding more cream cheese and more sour cream.  It was very good but I think it needed more tomato and meat mixture, so I will probablly add that next time.

The kids and I thought this was great.  They picked out the onions because they were crisp as they weren't carmelized first...a feature I especially liked with it's fresh onion taste.  My husband like it but to my surprise it was a bit hum-drum for him and thought it needed something to punch up the flavor.  Leftovers were dry and not very good.

This was really awful.This combo does not go together.I ended up throwing alot of it away.Two of my kids forced themselves to eat it so they could get their dessert,but my 7 year old said it was so bad he didn't care if he got dessert.My husband and I also hated it.

Everyone at my house really enjoyed this dish!  Since transferring the leftovers to a smaller container messed up the layers a bit, when I heated up the leftovers, I just mixed it all up and topped it with a bit more cheese.  Tasted just as great the second time around.  I think when I make it again, I will make a little extra cream cheese mixture, there just wasn't quite enough for this cream cheese lover!

This was "fair" at dinner last night, but was REALLY good today. I dunno-maybe one of those magic recipes that just taste better as leftovers? Anyway, simple to make, inexpensive and yummy. Thanks!

I made this for the first time as a newlywed in 2002.  It was probably the first real dish I made that was not just pasta and sauce or shake and bake.  I still make this today, now for my husband and son.  It has become a staple in my recipe collection.  I usually only do the bottom layer of egg noodles though.  Delicious.

This is great for a quick, simple meal that a family can enjoy.  Not a good one for impressing guests.  Perfect for nights you don't have a lot of time to cook but want something tasty.

I used ground turkey and browned the onions with it. I also added montreal seasoning to the meat. Then I added Paprika, parsley and pepper to the cream (and extra cream cheese). I thought it was very good. I will make it again.

My "kids" (14 & 17) hardly ever agree on new recipes that I try. This is the first recipe in a long time that both asked if I could make it again soon.  I'm also on a low sodium diet, so I adapted the recipe to use "NoSalt" instead of salt, and I used no-salt-added tomatoes.  This is sure to become a part of our family cookbook and I will share my low-sodium version with my friends who also need good tasting yet no-salt meals!

I tried this recipe a while back and then lost my printed out copy when we moved, I spent the last half hour looking up this recipe again (I'm really bad with remembering names) the half hour was soooo worth it, this is one of my very favorite recipes. My kids are 5 and 2 and they loved it, even wanted seconds! This is a must try for any newlywed or just for a quick and easy, yummy dinner!

Quick, easy, and oh-so creamy....  This is one of my new favorite recipes.  The only changes I make are to mix the cheese throughout (instead of sprinkling on top) and sautee the onions with the meat (instead of adding them raw with the dairy products).  I'd also like to change the name -- Husband's Delight sounds so silly -- but haven't come up with anything better yet.  Anyone, anyone...?  :-)

I think this recipe is really easy and tasty. My family really enjoyed it, and it was very filling. Next time I make it I am going to try more tomatoes in the beef, and I am going to mix the beef into the cream cheese sour cream mixture. Overall a great recipe!

The Staff at AllRecipes has modified this recipe to include a step to pre-cook the noodles.  Now there should be no need to add water at the end of baking.  Happy Cooking!

I have alot of recipes that you bake in the 
oven where you do not need to cook the noodle.
This recipe did not tell me to precook noodles so 
I did not.  I found after the 25 minutes that my
noodles were still hard.  I added a bit of water 
stirred the mixture up and another 15 minutes it was 
good.  I also put foil on top.

THe first time I had this dish was at 
my mother's. It went over so well with
everyone (including my sister who's
extreamly fussy) that I just had to 
make it myself. Was very easy to make
and once again went over well with
everyone.

This recipe was well liked by the entire family.  It's great for a potluck gathering since it makes a good amount and it will definately be a hit.  I also covered this dish while baking and didnt have any trouble with the top layer being dry or tough... it even LOOKS appealing when it comes out of the oven!  Yummy!

I found this receipe to be easy, but the top layer of noodles were very tough. Probably due to not being covered in the oven. Microwaves well.

his was a great casserole, I cut the cream cheese in half as I didn't want it too rich. The onions mixed in with the sour cream and cream cheese gave it a great a delightful crunch.

I even made more of the cream cheese and sour cream like others suggested and it was still very try. It was also very bland. Spices much needed. Nothing to write home about.

I didn't read the reviews prior to making this so I made it as it was written. The family really enjoyed it but I thought it lacked a little something. The noodles on top got a little crunchy which resulted in mixed reviews from my family. Some liked the added texture, others did not.

 I will make this again, but will definitely be trying some of the ideas from the other reviews. I will put the onions in with the ground beef to cook because they were still too crunchy for me. I will also be adding some garlic or other spices. I loved the ideas to make this dish "Mexican" or "Italian" so I will be trying that. I think it is a great foundation that a cook can add their favorite spice preference to and make a delicious dinner. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good recipe.... I added some Oregano and Italian Seasonings to the meat mixture and sprinkled parsley on top of the cheese right before baking in the oven.  I doubled the recipe for more servings.  It was great!!!

I feel like it should have been yummier. I think I used too many onions. I will try again with some of the suggested adaptations. We will see.

I've been making this recipe since 2007. The recipe is a great start and allows for adding flavors based on your tastes. I usually add garlic powder, pepper, extra onion and sometimes basil. I use whipped cream cheese now instead of the block. Easier to mix together. I saw someone added taco seasoning to the meat mixture. Will have to try that! The one tip I have is mix it all together instead of layering it. (It seems to re-heat better that way). Then add the cheese to the top. We love having it all mixed together. Thanks for the recipe...it's been a staple in our house over the years.

I also used a little more cream cheese. I would omit the sugar, use 2 tsp of salt and use 2 cans of crushed tomatoes. That's just my personality preference. My family (including 3 young children) loved this recipe!!!

For those of you allergic to milk/lactose intolerant like our family, we made this recipe with Tofuti sour cream and cream cheese, and Daiya cheddar cheese. Still came out great! We added a little hot sauce and parmesan cheese to our bowls, delicious!

This is one of my go to recipes for when we want something tasty and filling. I did change several things. I add onion and garlic to the sauce for more flavor. I basically make a down and dirty spaghetti sauce. I also use more than one kind of cheese - mozzarella, cheddar, whatever else I have around shredded. This is one of my kids favorite meals and one that I can still get my now adult daughter to still come over for.

My husband likes it. Of course, he loves sour cream and cheese. I added the taco seasoning to meat, used two cups of sour cream, eight oz of cream cheese, and about three - four cups of shredded cheddar on top. Needed more salt and some ground pepper.

Very good!  I made this recipe pretty much as is....I added garlic (we are a garlic-loving family) and fresh ground pepper for some zing and, rather than layering, I mixed the whole lot before baking (reserved some shredded cheddar for the top).   The family liked it a lot, even the kids.  Still needs more spice, though.  Next time I'll add more garlic and pepper, and I'll try some worcestershire sauce or a tsp of beef boullion powder.  The taste of sour cream came through a bit too much (and I only had 1-1/4 cup) so I'll cut down on the sour cream next time.  Some fresh grated parmesan would be a nice addition.  With these minor adjustments, this recipe may be going into our regular meal rotation.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this pretty much by the directions with the exception of seasoning the beef.  I don't think this was my taste...  The sour cream/cream cheese mixture was really thick in there...  My husband and son ate it okay, my youngest wouldn't.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Only changes I made was to flavor up the meat a little more than the recipe called for.  I added garlic while browning it and also seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.  It would probably have been too bland if I didn't season the meat.  But, all in all a great meal!

This recipe can be spiced up a bit to vary the taste.  This recipe as written is an older, traditional favorite that my mother used to make.  Instead of a can of chopped tomatoes, use your favorite jar of spaghetti sauce, 1 T. chili powder and season the meat with garlic salt and pepper.  Instead of layering, mix all of the ingredients together so the sauce flavors the pasta better.  I don't use quite so much sour cream or cream cheese,but adjust to your liking.  The sour cream and cream cheese combine to make the sauce incredible.  Don't leave out the chili powder b/c it really adds to it w.o taking it totally the mexican style.  I top the casserole with cheese and cover with foil. This is a quick dish to make it and provides your family with that comfort meal.

my boyfriend and I are big casserole eaters and this casserole is by far our absolute favorite! I follow the recipe exactly and it is perfect. One time I sprinkled olives in it and it was even better! definitely a delight!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I think the sour cream and cream cheese really gave it a rich, unique taste. Not just another "noodle" recipe.

This was so-so. We did eat it but I don't think I'd make it again. The sour cream over powers the cream cheese and you couuldn't even tell it was there. I did sub pico de gallo for the canned tomatoes and I know that gave it a different flavor but the tomatoes just don't seem to fit in this recipe. Thanks for the idea.

My husband loved this recipe! I used ground turkey, lowfat sour cream, tomatoes with green chiles, and subsituted garlic salt for half of the salt.

We thought this recipe was just ok.  It's most likely due to our personal preference of bolder flavors.  If you have a family that prefers mild flavors, then this recipe may be the one for you.  I could give it more stars with heavy modifications, but then it wouldn't be the same recipe.  Give it a try and see what you think!

This is a delicious meal!  I make a few changes.  I don't do the tomatoes, I put in tomatoe sauce instead.  I also add in a layer of chopped, well-drained, spinach.  Adds a great taste and veggie serving.  I scale it to make 8 servings.

This recipe is Wonderful and Easy.  The only changes I did was add the onions to the meat mixture to cook them, otherwise the onion flavor is too "raw" tasting for us.  Don't be afraid to add plenty of sauce!  Great recipe my husband, 3 and 6 year old LOVE!.

This recipe is far too dry. I made it pretty much by the recipe with the exception of taco seasoning mix and cheddar cheese on top.  It was fair as far as taste but not tasty enough make again.

Really good, and unique. Did not tweak it much, seasoned the meat with some random spices and then cooked the onions in the meat because my family are not big fans of crunchy onions. Came out nice. I will be making it again.

I tweaked this a bit, using 1# of lean ground beef, added finely chopped onion, bell pepper, added stewed tomatoes, and a can of diced tomatoes, adding salt, pepper, chili powder (will use taco seasoning next time).  I par boiled the bag of egg noodles and drained mixed the sour cream (16 oz) and about 5 oz of cream cheese.  I stirred everything together and dumped into a sprayed casserol dish, topped with 2c mexican shredded cheese and baked 30 min.  It was a great hit with the family, DH continued picking at it before I could get it put away, and he scarffed the rest down 2 days later (unusual for him).  The sour/cream cheeses mixture gives it a tany in the first bite but it definately grows on you and is a great dish!  Next time I will add taco seasoning, and more chili powder.  May try making it with left over rotersire chicken.  Great dish thanks for sharing.  I will be adding this to my normal rotation.

Awesome base idea!!!  Browned the beef with garlic, onions and Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle.  Didn't have tomatoes, so I used FF Cream Of Mushroom (Added in some chix broth and a splash of milk).  Per AmandaT's idea, tossed in dry onion soup with the Neufchatel and Lite Sour Cream.  Barilla Rotini Plus noodles.  Very easy, very versatile.

This was pretty good. Very filling! I did like the addition of cream cheese; it added a nice zip to the casserole. I added a clove of garlic while browning the ground beef and plenty of ground black pepper. I also used rotini, since I didn't have enough egg noodles. Thanks :)

This was okay. I think the beef mixture needed more sauce..maybe a can of tomato sauce. Maybe I will try it again but with a couple of changes.

There are great ingredients in this casserole but it lacked pizzazz.  It was bland and dried out.  We usually love leftovers, but not with this recipe. I don't think I'll make it again.

Noodles on top were too dry. Too much sour cream/creamcheese. I would have followed other suggestions to mix all together rather than layer. Son & Husband like it more than me. Would try again with modifications.

This wasn't as great as some people sad, but not as bad as others did. I made a few changes... I just mixed the noodles in with all the meat, so the noodles on top didn't dry out. I also used another can of tomotoes like others said to. I poured 1/2 the meat noddle mix in the pan, then added the cream cheese mix and then the rest of the meat and topped with cheddar. It was pretty good but some bites had to strong of cream cheese taste... next time I'm going to just mix all the ingeredients, but the cheddar, in a big bowl, put in the pan, top with cheddar and bake... you end up mixing it all up on your plate anyway. I'll make this again for dinners but it won't be a huge family favorite.

I have used this recipe a thousand times. The cream cheese topping is sort of tricky, but totally worth it. I also like to add french fried onions on top before cooking.

this is a really good recipe.  It's kimda like hamburger helper but not so processed.  I added some corn once just to have more veggies in the casserole. It's a great weeknight meal.

This dish was just ok.  When I'm looking for a one dish meal I'll keep this in mind but I'll doctor it up a bit.

Good with changes: added cream of mushroom, cut down on sour cream to 2/3 cup. also added can of tomato sauce and garlic. sauteed onion and garlic with hamburger. Hubby liked it when everything was all mixed together and baked with sharp cheddar on top.

Like the others I too altered a little bit but this recipe was excellent and a family hit!!! I used Rotel with green chiles canned tomatoes instead of petite diced plain tomatoes. I used a little more cream cheese than called for here. I also used thin egg noodles not the broad ones and put most of them on the bottom layer. I then did like the author and layer all the meat and then the sour cream mixture followed by the remainder of the noodles. To avoid having crispy noodles on top I increased the amount of cheddar cheese used so that it completely covered the noodles on top. OUR FAMILY WILL DEFINATELY BE HAVING HUSBANDS DELIGHT AGAIN !!!!!

Pretty tasty. I did make some modifcations. Used a whole onion, added garlic, mixed the cheese and noodles together. Used whole wheat rotini. Topped this with a layer of defrosted frzoen spinach. The meat layer did really need more sauce so I added some tomato paste, italian seasoning and tomato sauce. Soy cheddar and mozzarella went on top. Took this to a church potluck. It went over well. I had a little leftover and am reaheating this for work lunches this week.

I made this last night for my husband.. We both liked it, but he made a suggestion that I thought would  be really good to add some flavor..Add crumbled bacon.. I thought it was good but next time, I'll change up a few things and maybe add a few things also..

I made this last night and one of my 3 girls did not like it (but she doesn't like anything. Ü) My husband, 2 other girls and myself liked it.  I wouldn't call it a favorite. I took others advice and put shell noodles on the bottem and then the cheese sauce and then the hamburger mix on top. I think it really needs some more spices or something but it was quick and easy.

Well, I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I wouldn't serve this for company, but it's great because I had all of the ingredients on hand  and it tastes really good.  I followed the advice to keep all noodles on the bottom and I cooked the onion with the hamburger.  It turned out fine.

It was ok.  One thing I didn't like was I had tender noodles on the bottom and the noodles on the top were crunchy.  I liked the sour cream mixture.  The whole thing had kind of a "goulash" flavor.  It was good, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

It was okay.  I would have liked a little more flavor in it.  I did like the cream cheese mixture with the noddles.  I used medium size shell noodles and they were very good; they held the cheese inside them...very yummy.  I will try this again, but add some spice to the meat and a little layer of cheddar cheese in the middle.

I couldn't get the cream cheese to mix evenly into the sour crea.  And i took everyone's advice and added the tomato paste and italian seasonings and garlic and it was still bad. I was sorry everyone had to eat it for supper here.  i won't be making this again.

Prepared this the night before so dh could bake it as I wouldn't get home until late.  He liked it, 4 y.o. said it was okay, and I thought it was decent. It was a bit watery but that could because it was in the fridge overnight. Will make again especially when our schedule gets crazy.

I guess this should be called Brother's Delight in my family.  He couldn't get enough of it!  I just added some italian seasonings to the meat, and put all of the noodles at the bottome layer.  Yum!

My husband took one look at it and said, "Oh, homemade Hamburger Helper?" And I took another look and thought, yep, you're right. But it definately has more of a kick with the sour cream and cream cheese. Pretty good. I'll probably make it again.

Really GOOD!  I added some italian seasoning to the cheese mixture, and it turned out great.  Next time, I think I will use more meat and less noodles.  Thanks for sharing!!

Not impressed. The only changes were those made by other reviewers... (add small can of tom juice, add italian seas., mix pasta in with cheese mixture). I thought it was boring and lacked flavor. It was also very heavy. Husband said it was just okay. Thanks anyway.

I cut this recipe in half because I wasn't sure if it was going to taste good. The changes I made was adding grated parmeasan cheese to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture and I used spaghetti noodles instead of egg noodles. I also used barilla tomato and onion spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes and onions It was quick and easy and the family loved it.

I didn't really enhoy this, I did mix everything together as opposed to layer, so maybe that is what my problem was.  I also added some herbs and mushrooms.

Great and easy recipe.  My family enjoyed it but I suggest it needs more spices.  I added garlic powder and italian seasoning but it was still lacking something.  I also added more diced tomatoes.

Tasty, easy, filling, cheap and flexible!! I like recipes that are adaptable to some minor changes as to what i have on hand. I had not enough sour cream, so i swapped the proportions on that and the cream cheese. I also added the onions and a clove of garlic to the browned meat... i think had they not simmered a bit, they'd be too crunchy. Skipped the cheddar and stirred in about a third cup of parmesan. yummy!! definiately a "desperation dinner" keeper.

Fantastic dish. Only variation I will make is to add a bit of tomato paste for a stronger tomato taste. Very quick and easy. Will make again!

While I wasn't crazy about this, the family loved it. I didn't dislike it, but I think I expected more. I'm going to try it again but I think next time I'll take the advice of other reviewers and mix the cream cheese mixture and noodles together. Also, I think I'd add more spices ~ I found it a little bland. But, like I said, the family liked it the way it was written. Thanks Cathy.

My family liked this. I took the advice of others and cooked onion with the beef and added tomato sauce{ glad I did}, this would be easy to spice up if you desired. The leftovers after setting over night in the fridge was even better, very tasty. Will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

It truly did appeal to my husband and sons(7 & 3).  They ate it right up, along with all of the leftovers. I made a small ramikin of it without tomatoes for my youngest son and it tasted just as good as the mixture with the tomatoes.

I made this with the modifications suggested by others (browned onions with beef; added tomato sauce to beef; layered pasta then beef then cheeses; covered with foil to bake) and it was pretty good. It wasn't amazing but everyone enjoyed it and I would consider making it again.

With changes this is definitely five stars! I too added a small can of tomato sauce to meat and cooked diced tomatoes with mixture. I layered as someone had suggested: pasta first, then meat mixture, cheese on top. It was sooooo good! YUM!

This wasn't bad, but I think there's some "tweaking" to do.  First, I thought there were too many noodles.  Second, the cream cheese/sour cream mixture didn't "ooze" down into the other ingredients enough...wasn't "saucy" enough for us.  Other than that, it was a decent casserole.

Delightfully surprised! Very yummy - the only thing I would do different is to cook the onions with the ground beef. They were a bit too cruchy for our tastes.

This is delicious and very easy.  I used diced tomatoes with jalapeno.  I added habanero mustard to the meat and topped the dish with Mexican cheese.  Spiced it up a bit. It was great!

I LOVE this recipe!  I've been using it for about two years now and I've never made it for anyone who didn't think it was awesome!  I cut out some of the fat by using ground round and fat free sour cream and cream cheese.

This was just ok, a little too rich.  I jazzed it up with some spice, and cooked in layers as the recipe said, then mixed before stirring.  I think the orange color may have put us off.  I probably won't make this again, since I have more to try.

This recipe was ok.I think instead of the layers, it would have tasted better to mix everything together and bake. It made a bunch, but my family didn't like it enough to keep the huge amount of leftovers.

I thought this recipe was ok.  My kids did not like it very much, and my husband felt the same as myself.  I mixed the cream sauce in with the noodles instead of in between.  If I do make it again, I will make some changes.

This was not one of my favorites. I think the sour cream mixture should be blended in with the noodle instead of being spooned in between it. The noodles became dry.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe along with his co workers, But i did add a layer of jalapenos between the sour cream mix and cheese, they really spiced up the already good dish.

This is good.  Really different from everything thing else I have ever had.  I kept the onions in the cream cheese and sour cream. that gave it a stronger (crunchie almost) flavor.  I liked it.  I added a ts of minced garlic and 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce to the hamburg meat.  Excellecnt.

this recipe was great. I used macaroni instead of egg noodles.I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon to the ground beef mixture.I also used blue cheese in the sour cream mix, (which I would only recomend if everyone eating likes blue cheese)I added 1&1/2 cups of partly skim mozzerella to the cup of cheddar on the top, as I did not think one cup enough.I will definitley make this again.It tasted even better the second day.

This is definitely named correctly.  My husband went back for 3rds and even my picky eater loved it.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and sauteed some additional onion with the meat.  Fast, inexpensive and everyone loves it!!!

Yummy! Quick and easy "comfort" meal.  Followed advice of others and cooked onions with the ground beef.  At the end I mixed all the ingredients together reserving a little bit of cheese which I sprinkled over the top.  Perfect!

Very nice dish.  I too sauted the onion with the ground beef.  Also added a little worcheshire sauce, red wine vinegar and some cajun seasoning to the meat.  The noodles were starting to get dry on top so I covered it with foil for the last 10 min.  Thanks for 'delighting' my family!

This is awesome!!! It is so rich and creamy!!! YUM!!! Although I have found we like the onions cooked with the meat not put in with the cheese...it makes them a little softer.

This is a winner at my house.  My husband and my 3 boys all eat it up.  I have 1 very picky 5 year old and he LOVES it.  He doesn't like very many things and he gave it a 100+.  I did modify as others suggested and use spaghetti sauce instead and more cream cheese.  Other than that, I follow the recipe.  It's a keeper!  Thanks so much.  It's hard to find things that my picky eater will eat!

This recipe is truly a husbands delight. My whole family enjoyed it. It is refreshingly different. I made a few substitutions after reading the reviews...I used bowtie pasta instead of egg noodles, 1 lb of hamburger & 1 lb of sausage, spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes, and more cream cheese, onion & cheese than the recipe called for. I did not use the noodles as the last layer, I was afraid they would dry out. We will definitely eat this again!

This has to be one of the worst things I have ever made.  My husband, who always has 2nd's hardly finished his serving.  It was dry on top, the cheese doesnt' mix with anything and the hamburg tasted just like it is, hamburg with tomatoes.  I always follow the recipe the 1st time so I didn't change a thing.  I will not be making this again.

The name is appropriate; even though my husband doesn't generally like casseroles, he enjoyed this one!  I sauted the onions with the ground beef, and added a packet of sazon seasoning to the beef which added a taco-like flavor.  Instead of topping it with some noodles, I kept the noodles on the bottom and added plenty of cheedar to the top....  the consistency was similar to lasagna which made it easy to slice.  Will make it again!

We loved this recipe.  I sauted mushrooms and onions with butter and garlic and added these in the meat once it was already drained instead of with the sour cream mixture. I also put all noodles on bottom so they would not be crispy on top.  I used a mexican mix of 4 cheeses and added about 1 1/2 cups cheese.  I will make this one again!!!

It was pretty good.  Based on other suggestions, I added taco seasoning & corn while simmering the meat.  I also increased the amount of cheddar cheese.  Next time I will also increase meat amount to 2 lbs.  My husband liked it and I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe last night for my very picky boyfriend who hates casseroles--and he had two HUGE helpings!!  I did alter the recipe a bit.  I went ahead and fried the onions in with the hamburger and added some gr pepper and mushrooms.  I also accidently poured way too many noodles in the boiling water so I added a can of tomato soup to the hamburger mixture and it turned out incredible!!  Very creamy and not dry at all!!  We we definately make this again!!  Thanks!!

This recipe was good, great for a family dinner night and the kids actually ate most of it!  I did jazz up the recipe a bit by adding the onions, some garlic and italian seasonings to the meat as I was browning it.  I also followed some other suggestions to increase the sour cream and cream cheese.  A nice midweek dinner.

I was craving comfort food and I got it. This was pretty good, not like "oh my god" but still yummy. I used ground turkey, tomatoes with Italian seasonings (28 oz. can)and sauteed the onions with the meat, also added mushrooms. 

Next time I will mix the dairy layer with the noodles (Gnocchi), I will also add more cheese in between layers. I did add some cheese to the dairy layer, used fat free sour cream and light cream cheese (I can never tell the difference from regular and light). I will also cover with foil, thought about it and totally forgot, and the top got really crunchy. Even after being in the over for 30 mins. the bottom layer was still cold, I think the dairy layer creates a barrier. 
I made this the day before and simmered the tomatoes with meat for like an hour, so the meat took a lot of the seasonings. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a great comfort food recipe.

Cheese mixture was very good.  Meat mixture was a little bland.  I'm going to add something to it next time.  Not sure what.  Perhaps some garlic?  Maybe crushed red peppers?

This is a very simple dish. I thought it a little dry but my husband liked it a lot. After he ate his plate he finished mine. I did as an earlier review suggested and used 2 cups sour cream, 4 oz. cream cheese, put the onions in the beef while cooking, and used more cheddar cheese. When I make it again I will repeat this.

I didn't enjoy this recipe as much as I was hoping I would after reading the positive reviews.  It seemed to be missing something - maybe corn mixed in with the beef or seasoning of some sort.  I might play around with it a little and see if I like it better next time.

Overall, we enjoyed this recipe. I would agree with other reviewers that a little more sour cream may have been warranted. We'll try it again.

My family loved this recipe.  I added half the onions to the meat and half to the sour cream mixture.  I also used tomatoes for pasta that had seasonings in it.  I added a teaspoon of butter and some parmeson cheese to the top layer of noodles and sprinkled more parm cheese on top of this dish.

I enjoyed this a great deal, and will make it again to share with my SO.  However, I'll mix the sour cream/cream cheese sauce into the meat.  I like the extra zip the raw onions gave the meal.

Here's one change I made: I used fat-free sour cream and fat-free cream cheese.  I also used 91% lean ground beef.  That cuts down on the fat content, and possibly saves a few calories, too.

This was a great recipe and easy to make.  I will however, precook the onions before adding them to the cream cheese mixture as they were a bit strong.  Great tasting!

Tasty, very easy to prepare and is extremely filling.  As mentioned by previous poster, adding a cup of wine before sticking into oven is nice, along with seasoning beef with dried basil, thyme, nutmeg. And stirring pasta into beef mixture instead of layering kept it from drying out too quickly.  I also tried a cup of hot salsa, and was amazing.  So many little things you can do with this recipe make it great to fix once a week or so.  Experimenting is half the fun!

This was ok.  Needs more seasonings.  I wouldn't put the noodles on top as they tend to get hard.

YUMMY!!!!  Very easy!!!  I added the onion to my ground beef, drained then added the tomatoes.  I also added extra cheese to the hot noodles before adding to the casserole.  My only addition that I will do next time adding something with a little spice... maybe red pepper flakes or green chiles.  I will make it again, definatley good for the hubby and 2 year old:)  Thanks!

I'm a new cook, and I found that this recipe turned out really great, although I didn't like the raw onions in the sour cream/cream cheese mixture. My mixture was still cold when it came out of the oven, I don't know why. Next time, I will cook the onions with the meat, and mix with the sour cream mixture than layer on the noodles, over all, it was really good :)

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe, but my man was so I'll probably make it again.  Next time I won't layer noodles over top as they ended up hard.  I don't like onions at all but they didn't ruin the casserole.  My 4 year old wouldn't even touch it (not a fan of red meat)

This was a unique potluck dish.  The sour cream gives it a different twang than other pasta casseroles.  I added a little parsley on top for presentation.

This recipe was ok the tomatoes added a little zing to this dish but it needed something more. I also may not have added enough cheese so my noodles on the top layer turned a little crunchy.
My husbnad and friend didn't like it at all so I won't be making it again.

I enjoyed this dish, however, my husband enjoyed it more than me.  He would have liked it more with a little salt.  Next time I will season the meat like I normally would.  The onion in the sour cream/cream cheese mixture was great.  This casserole would be great for a new wife to try.  I believe that you should make a good first impression.  If this was one of the first dishes made by a newly wed, your husband may think you are an excellent cook no matter what you make after that.  Give it a try.

I added a small can of hot peppers and increased the cheese and used half hot sausage. We like spicy. Great dish and nice to freeze in individual baggies. My whole family liked it with more of a kick.~~~~~~~JUDYKE~~~~~~~~~

I loved this "light lasagna" recipe.  However, it was not my husband's delight, though he is a very picky eater!!!! I mixed the ingredients instead of layering after reading some of the other comments.  I will make it again and my husband can he something else if he wants!!! Thanks.

This is a nice recipe for a new cook or one in a hurry...not because it is so fast, but because it is easy.  Good comfort food on a cold, rainy day.
With a salad...a complete meal.

I added italiann seasonings the the cheese mixture and it tasted great. Kind of like lasagna. I would also think that you could add mexican seasonings to the cheese mixture for a spanish flavor.

This is a first rate casserole.  Very moist and flavorful.  My husband, however, suggested that I pour some Marsala cooking wine over it before putting it in the oven to bake.  WOW!!!!!  What a terrific addition that made!  I suggest that anyone who tries this recipe add some Marsala cooking wine to it -- it really jumps up the flavor. I make this casserole at least once a month.

Maybe I did something wrong but this turned out terrible for me.  The ingredients did not mix well at all.  When it was done, it was still in separate pieces; noodles, meat and cream cheese mixture.
Too bad, I really liked the thought of this recipe!

It was great. Could be called Wife's Delight as well. I loved it as much as my husband. Being newly wed, I've been trying new receipes and my husband keeps asking me to repeat this one!

This is so wonderful!!  I loved it!  This is my favorite dish now.  5's all around!  Unfortunately, my husband has a sore inside his lip, so he didn't get to fully taste it.  But he will next week!

I have no children so I can not rate this section.  But I found it very tasty.  I did add red cayenne pepper to mine and I think the next time I might use rotel tomatoes for the spice.  But it was so easy to prepare, and throw it in the oven serve with a vegetable and it was a full meal.

This was a very tasty, creamy and delicious recipe.  Not only did my husband enjoy it, but my finicky ten year old son devoured it also.  This was delicious, not too overly seasoned and I will use it again and again. I will also use the cream mixture as an idea for other recipes.

We all loved this dish even my 10 year old son (He is a very picky eater)  I felt it needed maybe some garlic or basil to spice it up.  My husband added a little worchester sauce to his.  By the time dinner was over there was none left for lunch the next day.

Very tasty! Good with various types of pasta. I would recommend adding a
little more sour cream. Also, make sure to let the cream cheese soften ahead
of time.  Yumm!

Really good tasting meal. We didn't add the cream cheese forgot it but, it was still very good. It was really filling wasn't real kid friendly with our boys though. Oh well. We didn't bake it but, it still turned out wonderful.

We don't have children, but my husband just loved the taste of this casserole.  He could not figure out what was in it, I think the sour cream and cream cheese threw him off.  But I had enough left over to fix both of our lunches the next day.  Very quick, easy, and delicious!

We enjoyed the flavor of this recipe.  I didn't have egg noodles, so I used small pasta shells. I enjoy finding good casserole recipes as I send them for my husband's lunches to work for him rather than buying all those processed foods.

Kind of watery with just the juice from the tomato can. Maybe tomato sauce would work better
