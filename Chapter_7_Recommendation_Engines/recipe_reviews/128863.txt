I thought it was a very tasty stuffing.  I didn't use all the hot peppers called for since I had guests that don't like hot foods, but the flavor was really good.  I also used hazelnuts instead of the pecans and it turned out nice.

I just made this for Thanksgiving today. Huge hit with all my guests! I did make a few changes, pork sausage instead of bacon and I made the cornbread instead of using bagged. The flavors in this are so great (I never would have thought to put them all together) I will be using the base of this recipe for a chicken dish very soon.

I liked the flavor but even with a little more chicken broth that called for it was dry and dense. Flavor was great, wished it were not so heavy.

Loved this! As did everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner!  The mingling of flavors (bacon, cranberries, jalape√±os, chilis and chicken stock) and textures (pecans, cornbread stuffing, and bacon) was a veritable party in my mouth! I  only used one 14 oz bag of cornbread stuffing and this filled up my oval shaped 13 x 9 pan. Also, after it was done cooking, I poured several large spoonfuls of gravy over the top. That really helped it be more flavorful and more moist.

Recipe is unusable.  Very dry and original recipe made way too much.  Not a good combination of sweet, spicy, and salty flavorings.  Will try another recipe next time.

If you find that this recipe is too dry then add more chicken stock. If you find that this recipe is too heavy then use one box of regular stuffing cubes instead of cornbread. It isn't rocket science people and a bit of common sense goes a long way!

We really enjoyed this quick and easy way to dress up boxed stuffing mix.  I used one box cornbread and one box regular sage (didn't realize they weren't both cornbread), cooked the veggies in the bacon fat instead of butter, and left out the nuts (just don't like them).  The cornbread is a great base to bring together the sweet, spicy, smokey, and savory flavors without completely departing from the traditional comfort food flavors that we crave during the holidays.
