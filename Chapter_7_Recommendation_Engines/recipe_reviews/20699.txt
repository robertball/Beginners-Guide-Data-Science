I thought the combination of juices was great, but I felt that it just watered down my club soda after 5 minutes.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted great, but made the bubbles go away pretty quick, if that makes sense.  I can't imagine serving this for a party, there is nothing *party* about it.  Refreshing, I suppose you could say.  We actually liked using the mixture for smoothies with ice in our blender!

IT was a fun idea. It made a wierd taste if i put it in water so, I put it in juices instead to make it exciting as the time went by.

This is so refreshing! I got almost two trays of cubes and didn't mind at all the cleanup afterwards. So simple. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for the Faceless Frenzy weekend 2013. OMG this is so refreshing!  I didn't have cranberry so I used grape juice.  DH even liked it.  After taking the photo I decided to add a bit of vodka - over the top!  Cannot wait for summer to enjoy this on a beach.  Thanks Blair.

This was ok, just a little fruit added to club soda. This was alright.
