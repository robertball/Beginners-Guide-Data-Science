Original review--Sep. 3, 2011: My family thought this was great! I used whole wheat bread, sliced deli cheddar cheese and sausage patties because that was what I had on hand. You CAN have breakfast sandwiches like this but use lighter counterparts and still enjoy it just the same. HUGE hit with all of us and this was a cute new way for me to eat one of my favorite breakfast foods that I grew up eating as a child. EDITED: I like to make this sandwich with leftover french toast, too (I do make my french toast "lighter" with whole wheat bread and partial egg whites). If you drizzle a little maple syrup in the middle, it's HEAVEN.

Awesome egg sandwich with a really cute name! These were great for breakfast "on the go" and were very filling. I used canadian bacon and cheddar cheese. No need to microwave - these melted just fine. Much better than going to a fast food driv thru and much cheaper too! Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I made this I was really impressed.  I only made one half and served open faced.  Now, I make fresh garlic butter to spread on the bread.  I fry the "cutout" circle part separately, and then use it to catch any egg yolk that ends up on the plate.  That is, if I've managed to cook the egg just right.  The best morning comfort food ever!  Thanks for sharing!

Love an egg sandwich - any way you make it!  This was a very good sandwich.  The only thing I did different was use regular size wheat bread because I didn't have any Texas toast.  The egg set up nicely in the middle of the bread and it flipped and grilled great.  This is a winner.  Thanks Rhonda35 for your version of an egg sandwich.

I really loved this recipe.  I didn't put it in the microwave at the end though.  As soon as I flipped the pieces of bread I put the cheese on the side that just came from the hot side of the griddle and it melted very well.  Great idea rhonda35!!!!

This was delicious. I only did 1 slice of bread per person and only 1 slice of cheese and served it open. I also didn't break the yolk like it says and it was so wonderful. Perfect for a quick breakfast as my husband and I have to be out the door by 7:30. Great job Rhonda!

So delicious! I thought this would be like egg in a boat but it was far better. I used canadian bacon and only 1 slice of cheese, but wow! This sandwich was really great. I assembled and ate this promptly so I didn't need to microwave it as the cheese melted fine and it was just the right temperature for eating. I sprinkled some salt and coarse ground pepper to the egg as it cooked. Thanks Rhonda, fabulous breakfast sandwich here!

Known as Egg in a Basket in our family, we make it with cheddar or swiss cheese because we don't like American cheese.  It's a rare, special treat in our house .

This recipe is great. I only grade on taste not on calorie content.Now, I did make changes for a calorie friendly recipe and it is great as well. Use 2 slices of Sara Lee Delightful bread 2 slices of reduced calorie cheese and 2 slices of 97% fat free ham  Use egg whites instead of the whole egg and butter flavored cooking spray in place of the butter.

My son & husband LOVED this as is.  I however do not like ham and need less calories.  I just used reg toast, one slice of cheese & replaced the ham with a tomato slice on mine.  :)  I also used "I can't believe it's not butter" spray instead of actual butter.  yummy! not hard to reduce the calories here if you think it's too much.  you also don't have to eat the whole thing, simple as that.

Very tasty, but there was a bit too much cheese, also it might taste better with unprocessed cheese.

Delicious. For YEARS I tried to gain weight ( I have a fast metabolism and used to get sick often) and depended on high-calorie recipes like this. I still eat stuff like this frequently to keep myself at a healthy weight.

My mother made these for us growing up and called them gashouse eggs - don't ask me where that name came from. I plan on making this today for my daughter, and yep, she is a perfect little chubby wubby. I love this name better so I will definately use it. Kudos to the creator!

I have been making a recipe like this for years. We called it Dutch Eggs. You can make this low fat by using lite cheese, smart balance butter, whole wheat bread or lite bread, they do have a lite ham or use turkey. Voila a lighter version.

My mom made this and we called them gashouse eggs. Didn't need all the extra fat from cheese or bacon and they were still great! I do think this recipe needs some serious revamping.

I am so glad that I found this recipe. It is fun and easy to make and delicious.  I use one piece of whole grain bread, one egg, one piece of low fat cheese and ham.  A healthy and moderate portion.  I will be making it often - breakfast is my favourite meal.

Great tasting recipe - certainly not for every morning, but how about one of those sleeping-late weekend mornings when you probably won't be eating lunch.

This is an awesome sandwich. Use thinner bread, low reduced fat cheese, deli thin ham, or canadian bacon, spray instead of butter. And only 1 egg. That would make it acceptable to fit into my 1400 a day calories.

I love it!  Classic power breakfast.  As a backyard chicken raiser, we're always looking for different ways to use eggs.  Thanks for this one.

Delicious and easy. My husband just completed his 14 mile Sunday run, so 800 calories is no problem for him. Great sandwhich for refueling.

This is great.  I have been eating this since I was a child.  We call them egg in a nest.  We cut the center out with a glass and use the bread from the center to dip into the egg.

This surprising sandwich was a childhood favorite of my husbands and he is 74 now.  His French Canadian mother called it "eggs in a frame" in French but our sons grew up knowing it as "chicky in a hole" from the time they were able to eat at the table.  Try scrambling the egg with a little horseradish before frying for an adult taste treat.

been making similar for years for my kids (my mom made them for us!), but we call it a "picture frame" egg, it would be the open face version.  Eaten with ketchup, my son eats it with maple syrup! You can add what you want under the slice of cheese!

I just made them a few minutes ago and it was very delicious. I only had a problem flipping the bread over since I made a bit of a mess on the skillet since the egg wasn't completely ready. I'd suggest you scramble the eggs before pouring them into the bread hole. I served them as individual pieces and put some mild salsa on top.

It's delicious if you DON'T break the egg!  Other than that, make it as directed and enjoy!!

This was the first thing our children were taught to cook. We call them " Nest Eggs". Now  all the grand kids have learned also. Always a hit.

This was a huge hit in our house.  I didn't microwave it but just put a lid over the fry pan to make sure the cheese melted.  Super easy way to make a complete egg sandwich.
