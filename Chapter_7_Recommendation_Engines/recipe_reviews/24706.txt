I've beem making this dip for years, and it always impresses people.  The only difference is I leave out the salsa.  Very easy.

Everybody loved this dip. I just scooped out servings on a plate and served with tortilla chips. I have made it a few times and it is always a hit. Just don't use fat free or low fat cream cheese - it doesn't taste anywhere near the same.

I've been making this dip since I found a recipe for it in the late 1980's and it still is a huge hit everywhere I take it!  I layer mine just a bit differently.  I spread the cream cheese mixture on the bottom, then spread the chili mixture on top, then the salsa and then top with cheese.  I always use Hormel's NO BEAN chili, as I think it tastes better without the beans and most people are not bean lovers.  Delicious!

This is one of my favorite dips. Where ever we go, no one has room for anything else!! I disagree w/ a previous reviewer, I use light cream cheese and I think it tastes the same. I also use turkey chili! Same great taste.

I have made this, although it was called "Hangover Dip". :)  I use chile without beans and don't put salsa in. Easier and I think better without the beans. Very popular at parties!

Great recipe! It literally takes less than five minutes to put this together. I used a glass pie dish and layered it as follows: cream cheese, chili, salsa then extra sharp cheddar cheese. The freshly grated sharp cheese makes this dish superb! I used half the amount of salsa and that was all I changed. Perfect :o)

This recipe was very good.  However, I used home-made chili w/ beans, so I don't know what the recipe would taste like with canned chile.  I served it to a crowd and everyone raved about it.  Next time I would cut the recipe in half and use a deep dish pie plate.

This was the first recipe that I made on this website. this was very good!!! My roommates loved it. I put the lettuce and tomatoes on top.  It had to much sour cream though that's the only thing. But otherwise It was amazing.

Excellent and easy! My kids don't like beans, so I used a potato masher and mashed the chilli.  A hit!

I used diced tomatoes with chiles instead of salsa and chili with no beans and my family loved it. There were no leftovers. Will make again and again!

Made this awesome dip with the following changes -Used chili with no beans and mixed with half can of refried  beans and half a package of taco seasoning. For the cream cheese I used half low fat and half regular.
