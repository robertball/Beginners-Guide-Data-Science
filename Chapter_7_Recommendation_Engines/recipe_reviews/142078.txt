This was also the first use of my ice cream freezer. I used Splenda? in place of the sugar, fresh pineapple, lime and a light coconut milk. Mother in law is a diabetic and I was trying to make something she could enjoy with the rest of us on the 4th of July. Sorry for all the changes but are they changes or substitutions. Fresh for caned and lite for regular. No mater how you look at it this was wonderfull and tasted just like a Pina Colada and even my {MIL}could "escape" with out worrie.

Creamier than other sorbets because of the coconut milk, this is light, refreshing, and a nice balance of  coconut, lime and pineapple flavors. Perfect just as written!

The tropical taste of coconut and pineapple is alluring on a hot summer day but sugary sweet not so much. Simply reduced the white sugar to 1 cup when making the syrup as the pineapple is packed with sweetness. Used a fresh, juicy whole pineapple instead of canned. Two-thirds of pineapple processed in a Vitamix blender to get a smooth and frothy mixture, and remaining portion pulsed several times so that there would be some small pieces of pineapple. This turned out great, and was plenty sweet for our tastes. Thank you, CALLALILLIE for sharing this refreshing summer treat.

This was very refreshing.  Will definitely make again.  Kids liked it too.  I skipped one step.  I didn't heat water and sugar.  I threw everything in blender and then right into ice cream maker.  Good sorbet consistency.

This was so easy! And relatively cheap compared to other deserts I make. I accidentally used twice as much lime juice. Next time I will still use 1/2 c lime juice, but reduce the sugar by about 1/4 - 1/2 c. Everyone loved it, but some commented that they had sugar overloads.

LOVE THIS recipe!! So refreshing for summer.  I don't have an ice cream maker, so the pineapple did settle a little to the bottom.  I froze them in individual ramekins. Easy for serving.  Would DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

Wonderfully Delicious!! Creamy, fresh, cold and yummy! Instead of can crushed pineapples, I used a fresh juicy, ripened pineapple I picked up from the local market. I cut into bits, chilled in refrigerator along with a coconut milk and syrup. When I put the mixture in the ice cream maker, it took 20 minutes to make. It was sooo creamy, smooth, tasty and fruity. I cannot believe I actually made this and it was so easy and cool. The balance of flavors were perfect. This is a definite keeper and one that will be used again and again.

We love this recipe! I don't have an ice cream canister, but we freeze this in a small stainless steel bowl with great results. We also like to thaw this a bit & mix with ginger ale or 7up.

This recipe is YUMMY!  Very easy to make, as other reviewers have suggested I don't boil the water and sugar, just throw them in with the other ingredients.  I have also used coconut cream instead of coconut milk (extra YUMMY), just cut the sugar in half.  Highly recommend, thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic! I poured the mixture into plastic party cups to freeze for several hours as individual servings.  When I pulled them out they weren't *quite* frozen...so we poured rum on top, stirred and drank up! DELICIOUS! With or without the rum. ;)

Very refreshing! The only thing I did differently was put in 3/4 cup sugar instead of the amount in the recipe because of the one comment about it being very sweet. It came out deliciously tart with a little sweetness and is great on a hot summer day! Will definitely make again!

Yum! I love the flavor of pina coladas and this hits the spot. I made it the old fashioned way, without a machine just sticking it in the freezer and stirring every few hours. It came out very well, but had to be put in the refrigerator about 30 minutes before eating so it is soft enough to serve.

EXCELLENT!  Just like a frozen Pina Colada.  If you like Pina Coladas, you'll love this.  It was a huge hit tonight when the temperatures went into the 90's.  I left out the lime juice because I didn't have any.  Hubby claims he likes it just the way it is.  Thank you CALLALILLIE for such a fantastic recipe!

Love this!  I'm making it again for the second time in 2 weeks and plan on making it regularly.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly except that I strained the pineapple after pureeing.  The texture was oh so smooth and creamy.

My husband says this is the best sorbet he's ever had, even better than the sorbets at our favorite upscale restaurant.

very easy.  I used tidbits in juice instead of crushed, and pureed them in blender.  I reserved the juice and subtracted that amount from water to make syrup, and added it to  the final mixture.   I couldn't find the lime I thought I had, so omitted that , but I didn't  miss it.    Froze nicely in my Cuisinart ice cream maker.     Makes a delicious treat and soothing for a scratchy throat.

A light and refreshing desert.   Are 3 minor adjustments As suggested by others I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it had just the right amount of sweetness. 
2) instead of 1.5 cups of water   I used the pineapple Juice left over from draining the pineapple.
3) added a slug of Malibu rum

Followed the suggestion of other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. This is a great alternative to ice cream on a hot day.

It was a great hit with my guests! I did use fresh pineapple ( about half) since that's what I had on hand.  I did not have the time so I put it straight into the ice cream maker then the freezer  instead of the 3 hrs in the fridge.  It was delicious. Great recipe

Flavor is good!  Although the instructions are easy, I don't understand how the sorbet is possibly ready in 25 minutes when you have to chill the mixture 2-3 hours or overnight before using the ice cream maker??   :-/

I first made this sorbet recipe a few days ago but I have to admit, I substituted some things, so the results weren't as expected. We are trying to watch our sugar so the first thing I did was cut that down. I made the syrup w/ 1c. water, 1/2c. PureVia, and 1/2c. Sugar. I used a 20oz. can of chunk pineapple (drained) instead of crushed because it's what I had on hand. I put the coconut milk and the pineapple in a blender and blended until smooth, tempered in the simple syrup, added the lime juice and chilled overnight. After following the Mfg. instructions on my ice cream maker, the sorbet just hadn't set as firm as I'd liked so I scooped it into a Rubbermaid container and stuck it in the freezer hoping it would set a little more. Actually, it froze...SOLID Lol. We had to defrost it in the fridge for 30 minutes and then hand mix it to achieve the consistency I was looking for. Even after all that, I still have to say the taste was spot-on. So delicious and refreshing! I made a new batch tonight and followed the directions "to the T" so, fingers crossed that Round Two results in success!
