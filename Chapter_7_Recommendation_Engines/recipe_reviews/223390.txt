Really good chili. I added a can of pinto beans and a can of tomatoes with green chilies. We like our chili a little spicier so I went ahead and added another tablespoon of chili powder near the end. I cooked it on high for 5 hours, and spooned it over a corn bread casserole topped with sour cream and cheese. Yum!!

This was a great recipe!!  The only thing I changed, was adding 1 extra can of tomato sauce.  I decided to do this because it was very solid.  The extra sauce made it the best chili I've had!

Spicy Slow-Cooked Chili Haiku: "Halved the recipe. And it fed 4 perfectly. Glad I skipped 'cook's note.'" So I followed the recipe, halving it, and upon coming home from work to the wafting wonderful aroma of chili, despite it being a sticky hot summer day (I'll make chili once a week regardless of the time of year or weather!), considering following the cook's note about adding more cayenne pepper. Took a nibble and passed on the additional spice, b/c it was plenty spicy and pretty tasty.

Made this today for a group of friends and my boyfriend for Sunday Night Football - everyone loved it. Very hearty and flavorful, juicy but not too thin at all. I was a little worried about it being too dry at first but after the 3rd hour on high in the slow cooker it really got a nice broth. Overall, it was great and everyone said the flavor was awesome. I prefer my chili on the spicier side so I just added some fresh jalapeno slices and cayenne hot sauce on top of my shredded cheese and sour cream. My one friend who doesn't really like anything too spicy said it was perfect. I will definitely make this again!

Best chili I've ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the beans because beans are nasty.  :)

My family's favorite chili recipe. Works great as a half batch by halving the recipe. I tend to use powdered garlic instead of diced as I hate chopping garlic, and it tastes just fine.

It also works surprisingly well as an alternative to sandwiches for packed lunches. It both reheats and stores well. Plus, one can feasibly make a week's worth of lunches while sleeping, if they put it in the slow cooker on low before bed on Sunday night...

I halved this recipe to avoid making too much and made it *almost* exactly as the ingredients are written (with the exception of accidentally adding all 3 Tbsp of the chili powder) and it was delicious.  Even the picky eater in the family, my husband, loved it!  He spooned it over warm tortilla chips and added lots of freshly grated cheddar cheese.  Am planning to make this again today!

I didn't like this recipe so much and didn't realize why it was so thin in texture until my wife asked if I put any tomato paste in it.  Plus, it was too bland, not enough spice.  Other than those two issues it was alright.

Easy and delicious! VERY spicy, with the tablespoon of Cayenne pepper! But I'm in Arizona, so it fit right in. :) The only change I made was to add a little oregano and cumin, just because. It seems to get LESS spicy as it sits ... leftovers weren't as searing. This is great over rice, too!

I made this chili for a Super Bowl party, and it was a big hit. It's solid and basic enough to appeal to a large group and to allow for add-ons as the cook chooses. I cooked the beef with celery, added some dried oregano and cumin, and popped in halfway through cooking one chopped jalepeno and an extra can of tomato sauce for a nice broth. Will be using this recipe again for sure. The long cooking time is great for folks who are gone a full work day.

Good recipe, with some alterations for a little more spice and flavor

(Note, my suggestions are based on halving the recipe)

1) I used 93% lean ground turkey, to make it healthier (with all of the spice and the long cooking time, I was not missing the ground beef at all!)

2)  Cut a fresh jalepeno in half and let it cook with the chili (fished it out before serving) -- added a nice spice, but not too hot

3) Added 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes

4) Added 1 tsp of nutmeg, for depth of flavor

5) Added 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning

6) Added an extra clove of fresh minced garlic

7) Added 1 tbsp of garlic powder

8)  Cut the onion in half, rather than minced inside of the chili and fished onion out before serving so you get the flavor, but not pieces of onion throughout (i hate biting into cooked onion!)

9) Added 1 tbsp of tomato paste

10) Used 1 large can (28 oz) of diced tomatoes (yes, even for 1/2 recipe), as chili was way too chunky

This chili is fantastic. Many "spicy" chilis don't have a flavor to back up the spice; they're just spicy to be spicy. This recipe turns out a chili that's got a good kick and a fantastic, complex flavor as well.

This is a delicious chili recipe.  My husband loved it.  The only change I made was cutting the cayenne pepper measure in half. I will definitely make this chili again.

Loved this recipe. I swapped out ground beef with ground turkey but I followed the rest of the recipe. Family members loved it! Definitely will cook again :-)

This is the best chili recipe I've ever tried! If you don't like things really spicy I would recommend not adding as much cayenne and chili powder but I thought it was perfect! Makes a lot so plenty for friends and family! I do like peppers so to customize it to my own taste I added one more pepper and a little less onion but that's just my preference. Also, I used 24 ounces of sauce - I'm not sure how all the spices could even be stirred in with just 8oz of sauce. A few of my friends tried this recipe and I gave them a heads up on this. They agreed and used more sauce and said it was perfect!

I didn't have cayenne so I just added a couple of teaspoons of hot sauce, an extra 8 oz can of tomato sauce to thin it out just a tad, 1 can of canellini. beans & 1 can of kidney beans just because that's what I had on hand & I used ground turkey to make it a little healthier. It was awesome!

Very good recipe and easy to play around with. Changes I made: I used one can of red and one can of white kidney beans, added 2 cans of tomato sauce, used 1lb ground beef and 1lb of ground pork, added celery and the onions to the meat near the end of cooking, didn't drain the 28oz can of diced tomatoes and I added a lot more garlic, cayenne and chili powder. After those changes it was a matter of taste preference. I may have added a touch more salt and I added a red garlic sansel and maybe a touch of oregano. The changes might not have been necessary and the base recipe would have been good for the average cook. If you do want to thin out the original recipe though I would recommend adding either the extra can of tomato sauce or not draining the diced tomatoes.

Loved this! I halved the recipe and further halved the cayenne and chili powder because we're not really into overly spicy food. I added a bit of cumin because chili is not chili without cumin and a bit of seasoned salt and white sugar. It turned out great! My only regret is that I didn't make the full recipe because we didn't get to have any leftovers!

This is how my mom made her chili , I grew up on the stuff, I have added one thing that I think makes it taste better is add 1/2 jar of salsa, mild, med or hot, whatever you prefer. Gives it a wonderful tangy taste!

Have made this several times, with slight variation.  I actually use 1 lb of beef and 1 lb of turkey.  Instead of cooking the meat in another pan, I do everything in the crock pot.  One less dish to wash!  First add the meat in the crock pot on low.  Once almost cooked thru, drain and add all the other ingredients. I do not drain the diced tomatoes since it needs the extra moisture.  Great recipe!

Used 1 pound of beef and it was still great. I thought it was going to be really thick when I first put everything in, but it balanced out nicely by the end. I do prefer a hearty chili. Must be a wuss because this was too spicy for me! So I will cut down next time. Still, really great flavor. I like to pour chili over salad greens as dressing and protein all in one and this was great for that.

This chili was absolutely delicious. I didn't think it was too spicy, it was actually just perfect. I added an extra can of tomato sauce as well because it was looking too dense. Everyone that ate it had seconds and left-overs didn't last long. I would definitely recommend this one!

WON at a Superbowl Chili Cook-off with this recipe!!! Only change made was that I added "1/2 tsp of Pappy's Hotest Ride in Town BBQ sauce".  It's a great recipe without that added hotness, but it made it a prize-winner!

Very good recipe! But, as always I have to add my own twist. I enjoy my chili really spicy! What I did was after cooking the ground beef I drained the grease out. I then used a food processor to chop up fresh hot cherry peppers, jalapeños, onions, and bell peppers. I then added this mixture to the pan of ground beef along with chili powder, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and a can of tomato sauce. This really gets the flavored to cook right into the meat. I let this cook together for about 5-7 mins. This also makes it easier to mix all together. Other than that I also added an additional can of tomato sauce as it was very thick. After cooking it together in my pan, I then put it all in my crock pot along with the diced tomatoes and other ingredients!! Came out awesome!!! Will definitely be making this again!

I really like this simple recipe. I ended up not adding the cayenne pepper though to make it a bit less spicy.

This recipe is very good. I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used crushed tomatoes and added a cup of water. I also added 3 tablespoons sugar to cut the acid from the tomatoes. I also added a little cumin. delicious!!

Very good recipe for chili; however, do NOT add a Tablespoon of Cayenne unless you like it REALLY spicy! Ruined my entire pot of chili! :(

This chili is an excellent base recipe. I made it exactly as indicated, and we loved it!  I found that it had just a little too much onion for my tastes, so next time I will reduce the onion by 25%, increase the kidney beans by 25%, and throw in a small can of chopped green chiles. With these small adjustments, it should be absolutely perfect.

I've made this many times over the last few years. It's a great simple recipe and everyone loves it that I've had over. The only thing I add is a second pepper and more chili powder and more cayenne to make it spicier.

Made exactly as written except lowered cayenne to one teaspoon. I felt 1 tablespoon would be to much for the grand-kids.  Probably one of the top three chili's I have tasted.

My family LOVED this one.  I did use the diced tomatoes with jalapeños AND I added two spicy jalapeños to the mix.  It was just the right amount of spice for my family (we like items medium to slightly above medium).  I always know a recipe is a success when my kids eat it as their afternoon snack when they get home from school.  This recipe does make a lot of chili, and it is very filling.

Though this chili has a good flavor, it is considerably too spicy for us...I did cut the cayenne down to two tsp., as opposed to a full tablespoon, but it was still dynamite hot.  After adding 2 T. sugar and 2 T. vinegar AND boiling a raw potato in the chili for a couple of hours, I finally tamed the mixture to our taste.  Another tip...don't add extra liquid even though initially it seems dry.  Eventually the ingredients do liquify, and I ended up leaving the lid off to allow it to thicken further.

I cut the recipe in half since am only cooking for one person.  I used 1 lb. chili cut beef 1 can drained kidney beans, 2 cans diced tomatoes (did NOT drain), 8 oz tomato sauce, 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, 1 clove garlic, 2 T. chili powder, 1 1/2 t. cayenne, and black pepper and salt to taste.  Cheese upon serving.  Put this in my 5 qt. cooker and only had to cook 4-5 hrs on LOW

Great chili, but way to thick for our liking. I just thinned it with  little beef stock and it was perfect. Didn't want to use more tomato because this is beef chili.

I also felt that this was too dry.  I didn't have additional tomato sauce so I added eight ounces of V-8 juice and I was very happy with the results. I'll definitely be making this again.

A very good chili! Like others, I ended up adding more tomato sauce to thin it out somewhat. I must have used some very potent spices, because this came out HOT (and we like spicy)! I'll probably make it with about half the cayenne and a little less chili powder next time.

I made this with a few changes and it came out amazing! I only used 1 lb of ground beef , 1 onion, 1 can of beans I switched them to black beans, I used a 14oz can of tomato sauce instead of 8oz, I added corn, used 2 tablespoons of chili powder and 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper and served with tortilla chips :) my husband can't get enough!!

Our perfect chili! The only thing I changed is I leave out the cayenne (since my daughter doesn't like spicy, but I personally loved it as is) and just set out the shaker so everyone else can sprinkle in as much as they like. Without the extra spice it's a lot like Wendy's chili and leftovers (if there are any) reheat well and are great for nachos or on baked potatoes. I little trick I learned is to add a cup of water to the browning meat and it helps draw out more of the grease and even browns it faster.

Made this dish SEVERAL times for pot lucks. The secret...add more time than the suggested time. The longer, the better. The spices come alive, not too spicy, the longer it sits on low/warm in the pot. Stir occasionally.

This was an absolute hit at the Bible study potluck! I cut the Cayenne pepper down to 1/2 teaspoon and it was the perfect amount of warmth for everyone. For my family, I will kick it up a notch to a teaspoon and a half maybe. A tablespoon is waaaaay too much. Used turkey instead of beef. Everything else the same as recipe. Just perfect. Thanks for this recipe!!

I love it. I make this every year a few times a year. Sometimes I cut the cayenne pepper and chili powder in half so it’s not so spicy for the kids.

Like most allrecipes recipes, it came out great.  My family  unfortunately can't handle spicy food so i had to reduce some of the spices.  Usually If the recipe calls for 2 Tbsp of Chipotle chili pepper, i'll reduce the amount to 1 Tbsp and half.  The same goes for pepper and any other spice.  But it still came out great.  My family loved it.

This is the second time I've made this chili, and it is a solid foundation, but needs some adjustments. I increased the spices and used chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. The other change I've made is to use three cans of the hot rotel with habaneros instead of plain diced tomatoes. This recipe makes a TON of chili, which is great for meal prepping. This time around I used a prepackaged mexican cornbread mix and added cornbread dumplings into the crock pot at the end. Yum! Even with the cornbread, it still is pretty healthy and calorie conscious.

I've made this for the family and for church gatherings on many occasions. I like to add a bit of Jim Beam bourbon for flavor at the beginning as well and sometimes I halve the chili powder amount for slightly less spice (it's still plenty hot). Great recipe and a crowd-pleaser to boot!

Sooo good!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and put in 1 can of pinto beans and i can of kidney beans, to add variety.  I also used 1 pound of ground chicken and one pound of  ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I added 1 more 8-oz can of tomato sauce.  YUMMMY!!

I consider myself a chili fanatic, and make it all the time, but 
this is one of the best I have made over the years, bar none.

Used lean pork instead of beef, and added 1 regular can of beans "tangy and sweet", but otherwise followed it exactly.
Wow, it is fantastic and addictive !
I will make it again in a heartbeat - zero disappointment.

This was pretty good. I used fresh beans by cooking according to the directions. Other then that, I prepared this exactly as instructed, which was too mild for my taste. I added a whole lot more chili powder (probably 2-3 tablespoons) and refrigerated for a few days. Now it is PERFECT.   I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. I use one can kidney beans and one can pintos. When my boyfriend is here I leave out the green peppers (he can't stand them) and it doesn't really detract. The last time I made it, I used all 3 tablespoons of chili powder and 1 of cayenne. Unless you like REALLY hot, you might want to reduce the chili powder to two.

I wanted to make a dish to share for our annual Halloween get together with neighbors, and I thought chili would be the perfect dish. My wife and I like our chili hot: this was recipe was not as hot as we like, but it had a great flavor and nice heat. For some of our neighbors, it was really hot. I think it definitely hit the sweet spot, the entire dish was gone in 10 minutes! Only change I made was to add 1 small, chopped habanero chili.I'm going to make another batch for the weekend, may add one more teaspoon of cayenne and maybe one extra habanero.

It was very very tasty. I added jalapeños for a little more heat. It was a little “soupy” for what I was expecting. But very very delicious.

I doubled this recipe for the firehouse and there was about one serving left after an 8 fireman dinner. It barely fit in the slow cooker!!!!!!!  I added one habenero and one jalelepno about an hour before arriving to kick it up a notch. It was perfect for a large crowd.

We made half a batch of this chili last week and it was so good that we made a full batch this week. We wanted a little more spice this time so we added two small jalapeno peppers and it was delicious! We planned on freezing some but there is no more left! 
Awesome chili recipe.  Thank you for this!

Great starter recipe. I added a finely chopped (seeded) jalapeno, a small can of tomato paste, a bottle of beer, can of drained corn, a dash of worcestershire sauce, and subbed pinto beans ( don't like kidney ).  Also added extra garlic and onion powder and a little cumin.  Went easy on the cayenne since I added the jap and also subbed a can of diced tomato with chilis.  Hmmmm.....this will be great with cornbread !

I used half of the cayenne the recipe called for and it was still very spicy. It was just the right amount for my family.  The entire Tablespoon would have been too much for us.  I used twice the amount of tomato sauce as well.

This was wonderful the only thing I changed was I browned the onions and peppers and garlic after browning the meat and I also used two tomato sauces.

First time making chili thought this would be easy. It was. And well worth it. I added about double the chili powder and added a chopped habanero pepper which gave it some good spice. Not too hot though. Might add some ghost chili extract next time.

Love it.  Super easy.  I backed off on the cayenne pepper to about 2/3 of what it called for because the rest of the family doesn't like it too spicy.  One still said it was a bit hot.  So next time I'll have to back off even more and just throw on some Texas Pete for myself to enjoy.

This is one of the best chili recipes I've ever made and I've tried dozens.  I made this with ground turkey for a healthier version.  My fiance said it was sooo delicious. I will definitely be making this again very soon and next time with extra lean ground beef so I can compare the two. The only thing I added was another can of tomato sauce as it was a bit chunky for our liking and it was perfect.

I left out the bell peppers and substituted with 3 cans of diced tomatoes with chilies instead of just 2 cans of diced tomatoes. I also used chili beans instead of kidney beans. Turned out great with a medium spicey heat.

Fantastic dish, everyone ate it up in minutes!!! Next time I would leave out the bell pepper. Also it is a spicy little dish so if you don't like the fire, maybe cut the cayenne in half.

I halved everything on this recipe and used the tomatoes with jalapenos and tried it once with the pinto beans and another time with the kidney beans. not sure which I liked better but found it a easy and tasty meal.

This is an excellent chili. I had some extra pork leftover from a recent dinner so I used that in place of the ground beef, and I added a couple extra tablespoons of the chili powder. This does not affect the spice level so much as most of spice will cook out, and adds that perfect little bit of extra flavour. To top it all off, I added a little bit of chili garlic sauce and the whole thing turned out great!

I found it a little too spicy without even adding any spice as it cooked, and had to add extra hamburger, tomato sauce and beans to tame it down. Ended up with a large amount of chili, but it was very good.  Froze a lot of it to enjoy later.

This is my new go to on chilli. I used to buy the 2 alarm chilli packet but this beats it hands down. We don't like a whole lot of pepper hot so I do leave out the cayenne pepper. 

You will find this is to much fresher tasting that any packet you can buy. Try it you will like it!

This is a very good chili.  Adding green chilies really helps.  I make this very often. Started halfing the cayenne and add a little beef broth.

This recipe was awesome and so easy!  I cut down on the cayenne a bit because my mum isn't a fan of spicy food.  I also added a couple teaspoons of cumin, and some brown sugar to taste.  Will definitely make again!

I will definitely make this again, I love spicy chili and my family loved it. I did make some changes though. I didn't add bell pepper, I used minced onions, and I used diced tomatoes with chilies. It was very good and if you have anyone eating it who prefers mild chili they will not enjoy it. :)

I used 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1 teaspoon red pepper. It was still so spicy hot no one would eat it. 
I'll try it again, but I'll cut back even more on the spice and I think it may be all right.

Great base chili recipe.  Typically I make two batches (large family).  I make it as is and reduce the cayenne as some of the folks in my house don't like a lot of heat.  For a spicier kick I add a small (I repeat small) jalapeño and a half tablespoon more cayenne to the second batch.  I also add a little flair to both batches by adding 12 oz of beer.  Adds a nice flavor.

Very good chili.  I found there was a lot of liquid so next time I'll drain the tomatoes.  Also I only used half the cayenne and chili suggested in the recipe and it was perfect for my heat resistant hubby.  I served it in a baked sweet potato and with a kale salad.  We had brownies from this site as well for dessert.  Yummy supper for a very cold night!

I used leftover beans from ham and red beans night. This gave a great flavor.  I threw in one can of chili beans. I only used 1.5  lb of hamburger  and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.   I used the (1) 8 oz can of tomato sauce and this was perfect consistency of thickness.  I used the recipe as a base and I liked the spices used.

Loves this recipe! I was only cooking for three people so I cut all the ingredients in half for everything except the 2 cans of diced tomatoes, which I didn't drain, and I added an extra can of tomato sauce. Glad I listened to the other reviews because those tweaks made it the perfect consistency. Will definitely cook this again!

Excellent chile.
We added 2 cups of water as my slow cooker heats more than average and it was fine by the time we got home.

This is great! I made it as is except I cut down the spice to 1 tbsp. chilli powder and 1 tsp. cayenne. It was still a tad spicy for my mild tastes, but it does say so in the title! Just take it seriously.

This is the one recipe that is used the most in my home. However, we use this generally as a base, with different modifications each time we make a new batch. We like our food extra extra spicy so we add lots more extra cayenne. Some additional modifications we've made are LOTS OF CUMIN, mix the beef with either pork or spicy italian sausage, less beans, and Harissa spice on top of the extra spices (about a TBS of Harissa) . 

I would like to try some freshly chopped habeneros for our next round, but this is a good base recipe to work on and adjust to your liking. 

One issue is despite draining all the juice after cooking the meat and draining the cans, it still has a thin consistency at the end of the 10 hours, so before serving we leave the lid off while its warming to reduce, and I skim the oil off too. 

Regardless, of its shortcomings, it gets 5 stars since its the most used recipe in my home.

Doubled the recipe for a larger group, added an orange pepper, 2 stalks of celery and a bit extra cayenne. Also used chili kidney beans. Most everyone loved it only complaints were that it was a bit too spicy from those that didn't go back for a third helping.

Awesome chili!  I usually add an extra can of tomato sauce so it's not dry.  I also like to sprinkle a little nutmeg on it and a cap full of liquid smoke towards the end of the cooking time to round out the flavor.  Tastes great using turkey as well.  My boyfriend constantly begs me to make more chili!

This is really good! I did change a couple of things though. I added one 12 oz can of tomato paste & two more 8 oz cans of tomato sauce. I only use 1/2 of the cayenne pepper the recipe called for since other reviewers thought that it was too spicy & I added one packet of chili seasoning mix. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was not outstanding but it was good enough for a weekday meal. I made it just as was written. Next time I would dress it up a bit by adding additional onions, chili peppers, fire roasted tomatoes and additional chili powder and red pepper. I did love the ease of this dish and having it ready at the end of a busy day. I would also serve it with sour cream and more shredded cheddar cheese.

What surprised me the most is that when this starts cooking it looks relatively dry.   The recipe contains almost no moisture (Drained beans, Drained tomatoes) so I was worried it might start burning to the bottom of the crock.   I added most of a beer and even with that the top half of it was still pretty dry looking.  But I let it cook on low for an hour or so and it definitely has moisture.
I also added Jalapenos and two Habaneros instead of the 1 bell pepper.     Yes it was spicy, but not bad, just enough "zest" in my opinion.
Tonight I'm cooking it for the second time.  This time I added a whole package of bacon, cooked, drained and crumbled.  I also did not drain 1 of the cans of tomatoes.     With the addition of the extra meat (bacon) I hope it won't hurt to have that extra moisture.    So far, 5 hours into the cooking cycle, it looks just great and my home smells delicious.

Great recipe!  This was my first chili without using a seasoning packet and I will definitely use this again and again.  At first, I thought it was a little bland, but added more salt and BOOM, perfection!!  The heat was just right.  I followed the recipe as written except I doubled the garlic (always do) and I used chili-ready diced tomatoes (did not drain).  And then a lot more salt after it was done.  Was hearty and chunky...not "thin" at all as someone complained.  Perfect topped with chopped onions and cheese.   My guy loves it too...the chili and the gas.  Next time I might sneak in some Beano.  ;-)

Great chili recipe! I halved the recipe, but still used the whole 8oz can of sauce because I like it a little more soupy. I cooked mine on high for about 3 - 3.5 hours (I would have cooked it the full 4 hours but it smelled so good, my boyfriend insisted it was done).  I served it over plain white rice and it was the perfect dinner!

Made this as written except used ground turkey and added a sprinkle of cumin toward the end of cooking time.  We were having a chili night at church on a Sunday evening, so  I assembled the night before, refrigerated it, and let it slow cook all day Sunday.  Just has a bowl for lunch, (it's now Tuesday), and I think it's even better today.

My family loved it! I used fresh diced tomatoes and just a little less red pepper. It still had a nice spicy taste, but not as hot.

I made it as advised.And.....   I LOVED IT!!!! Although, it was too spicy for my Beautiful Wife. As a result,  I have many leftovers to freeze and will enjoy it through the fall n winter as it lasts (and make it again as needed). Now on to Baked Mac n Cheese. I Love this website! ; )

I LOVE THIS RECIPE... i only use half the cayenne because i like it hot but there are kids that have to eat as well.... i cook it exactly as it says and it comes out as a wonderful chunky chili... not all liquid like can chili.. speaking of can chili, i wont even eat it anymore unless its chili dog night. Im making it again right now and it feels like 100 degrees outside....  again the only change i made was i halved the cayenne..(because other people have to eat too and not everybody likes it as hot as i do)

First time making chili in my slow cooker and it was fantastic! I made it for my roommates and some friends and everyone really loved it! Second and third bowls eaten! The ONLY thing is that I have a spice sensitive friend who found it hard to eat. I personally love spice and found it just spicy enough! Will for sure be making again!

I made this exactly as written except we shook our own Cayenne on the Chili since my kids aren't spicy fans and I added about a teaspoon or so of Cumin. The chili had great flavor and wasn't thin at all. I didn't add any extra juice and at the end of the cooking time, the chili was nice and thick. Very tasty and easy to make. I'm ashamed to say it, this was my first time making chili without a spice packet and it is the recipe I will make from now on. 
Thanks for sharing!

This chili is so yummy!  I did a few different things...I halved the recipe, used deer meat, added some cumin (about 1.5 teaspoons) some garlic powder and a little more tomato sauce than the recipe called for.  VERY VERY GOOD!  My hubby really liked it too.  Thanks!!!!

Best chili I've ever had or made. My husband even loved it, & he's picky. The only changes I made was I didn't drain the diced tomatoes, I used 2 cans of tomato sauce, & added a little bit of water. Would've been too thick for me otherwise. Has just enough kick without being too hot or spicy. This is the only recipe I'll use from now on. Thanks for posting!
