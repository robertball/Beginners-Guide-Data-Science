Thank you for an easy way to have asparagus soup! I'm the only one who eats it, and the other way isn't worth the trouble for just me. I used only a splash of ck broth, due to comments regarding the thinness, and also stirred in some sour cream to give it extra creaminess. I borrowed a couple other ideas for extra flavor, and added splashes of lemon juice and soy cauce, plus sprinkled in a little dill weed and onion salt. This was an easy fix to a major craving!

Wow!  I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is.  The only thing I added was a thin ring of yellow onion, diced and pureed with asparagus.  Very, very good.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I just added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of onion powder and 1/8 tsp salt. I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of chicken broth and a little olive oil instead of butter. I garnished it with chopped fresh chives on top. You might want to double the recipe. It just yields exactly 4 servings.

I'm giving this a 4*  although its  very good and I will make again. It was very easy and quick to make. I did change some things--I only used 1 cup chicken broth and  I used 1/2 cup evaporated milk. I microwaved 4 freshed chopped asparagus and added --we liked it and I would say it is  2 cereal bowls or 4 small servings.

Oh my!  This is delicious!  I'm not a big fan of asparagus soup so I got nervous and added a few extras.  I skipped the broth and used cream of chicken soup, I used fresh asparagus that I steamed.  Added onion powder, dill sead, soy sauce, and lemon juice based on others recommendations.  I used the milk but also added some light sour cream and some boiled fingerling potatoes.  Skipped the oil/butter all together.  It was amazing!  Will definitely make again!

I give this 5 stars for simplicity, and 4 stars for taste. I perfer a thicker soup, so next time I do this I will use two cans of asparagus. I used whole milk to give it a creamier texture. So easy!

AWESOME!!  So easy and yummy!!  My husband loves it and asks for it several times a week.  The only thing I do different is add hot peppers with the asparagus in the blender and do not add milk to keep the recipe low carb.

I reduced the broth down by about 1/3 before adding everything else - I used low sodium chicken broth.  Then top with a little fresh lemon juice at the end.

This was probably the first soup I've ever made from scratch, so it was nice to start with an easy one.
It was a bit thin (just a comment, not a complaint), but since I added the optional butter and milk, it was pretty tasty and rich. This was a nice soup to have on a cold winter day and I've added it to my recipe box so I can make it again sometime. Thanks!

I did not care for this at all.  The taste of the canned asparagus is still with me, and there was a bunch of stringy, hard pieces. Sorry...but go for the fresh asparagus.

I would have given this 3 stars, if it wasn't for all the suggestions people made. To make it creamy, I used 1 cup skim milk and instead of the chicken broth I used 1 1/2 teaspoon OXO chicken. I added 1 tbs "I can't believe it's not butter", this made a huge improvement on taste. Though, I still didn't like it that much, so I added 1/2 teaspoon dill, 10 drops lemon juice, 1 tsp soy sauce, and garlic, onion powder, and pepper to taste. I topped it off with mozzarella cheese. It was pretty good after all the changes.

This was pretty good, very low in fat, inexpensive to make, and quick. It was just a tad too high in sodium cause of all the canned food and it had a little too much of a canned food taste. But this is a great recipe when if you are home alone and have lots of work to can't spend time cooking. I believe it is 1 serving for 1 person, or maybe I need help with portion control!

I totally did not follow the directions on this but I still give it 5 stars.  I drained the asparagus, put it in the blender, added chicken broth to about halfway, added milk to almost the top of asparagus, a dollop of sour cream, a splash of lemon juice, and a pinch of cayenne and a little garlic powder>> blended it all up in the blender at once and microwaved individual servings.  Super good!  Update:  Tried to actually follow the directions this time and it wasn't nearly as good.  I did not drain the asparagus... bland.  I even used a good brand name (used generic the first time) and came out with so many strings it wasn't worth eating.  I even put it back in the blender 2-3 times and it didn't help.  I think I'll go back to the generic brand and drain it.

I made this with a bundle of fresh asparagus, salt free chicken broth and water and 1 tsp of Braggs seasoning.  I also put some onion flakes, garlic powder, old bay and onion powder in it.  I chopped the asparagus into 1.5" chunks, and boiled in liquid.  I used a hand held mixer to blend into a creamy texture.  I added a spoon full of fat free yogurt into it before serving to lighten the green color!  
Turned out great!!!!!

Many times have I whipped up a batch of this simple, yet surprisingly elegant soup. Mostly I like to eat it as a "pick me up" on days when I am feeling low.

Was short on time so I decided to try this recipe instead of using fresh asparagus. I made a few changes but it was yummy even before that. 

Here is my version:
Vegetable broth instead of chicken
Add 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
Add 1 clove fresh pressed garlic

Add 1 tbsp herbed goat chevre to each serving bowl and pour soup over..... Beautiful and decedant touch from a shmancy restaurant!

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I used two cans of asparagus to thicken it, but otherwise, it was perfect.  Thank you.

I just made this for lunch and it was wonderful.  I added just enough chicken broth for the consistency I wanted and added touch of cream near the end of heating.  Next time I'll probably skip the cream since it took away some of the asparagus taste.  I'm now wondering what other canned veggies might be transformed into a soup with so little effort.  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe

This was brilliant! I doubled the asparagus, cut down slightly on the chicken broth, and used half and half instead of milk. A dash of pepper, salt, cayenne, and worchesteshire spiced it up while finely diced peeled, boiled potatoes added heartiness.

Good taste.  Used fresh cooked asparagus in season.  Prefer a thicker soup.  Tried a tablespoon of flour while blending, but not enough.  Will try two-three tablespoons next time.  Could skip butter and not miss it.

Really good! Much better than I was expecting, actually, considering the simplicity of the ingredients. I only used 1 cup chicken broth and mixed in some salt, pepper, and dill - YUM.

I made this soup using  frozen organic asparagus spears and two chicken bouillon cubes instead of the canned soup. Omitted the salt, but it still ended up being too salty from the bullion. I liked the recipe, but it didn't wow me. I would give it a 3 for taste and a 5 for convenience.

This was awful.  It smelled terrible and was a sickly shade of green.  I made it with the optional milk and butter and, even then, it was WAY too thin to be a standalone soup.  I think that our leftovers (there were PLENTY) will be used as the cooking liquid for rice or something.

Really easy to do-- I doubled the recipe and sauteed some onions and added it to the asparagus mix-- instead of using a food processer I used one of those nifty immersion blenders-- Added a lot of garlic powder and also added some boiled orzo-- used skim instead of regular milk-- This recipe was a good "jumping off" point to create new recipes

This recipe was good. But it was very thin soup so if you are used to the creamy one you may not like this.  I think this soup is better for your health.  Thanks.

I had some fresh asparagus so I chopped that and cooked it in the broth.Then put in the food processor to smooth.Put back in pot and added 1/2 cup cream.It was very good and low carb.

This was such a quick and easy recipe to make and it really does taste good. The only thing I changed is I used a half a cup of heavy cream instead of a half a cup of milk. I wanted it to be a little bit richer.

I'll be honest, I thought it was ok but not that great. The texture, taste, and look reminded me of baby food. I used canned asparagus though, which doesn't taste nearly as good as fresh cooked asparagus in my opinion so that could be part of why I thought it was mediocre. Also, another reviewer mentioned that the soup was very rich as-is without the added milk, and I have to agree because I added milk to mine and it  ended up way too rich for my liking. All-in-all it wasn't inedible but it wasn't very appetizing either. I don't think I'll make it again.

I steamed asparagus, blended it with the broth, and strained it a few times to get a better consistency. I also used Rosemary And it's yummy!

I just made this recipe and it came out amazing! The only change I made was to add a little heavy cream instead of milk.

I used asparagus left over from a big meal thinking fresh asparagus would beat canned asparagus any day but this recipe missed the mark for me.

Very good and very fast! Instead of the chicken broth, I added two small chicken bouillon cubes and 1/2 cup of water. (I omitted the salt because of the bouillon.) In addition, I included the optional milk and butter. To make the soup more hearty, I stirred in 1/2 cup of instant rice and simmered it in the soup for 10 minutes. For a delicious garnish, I topped it with a tablespoon of light sour cream. Fantastic results! Even my kids loved it!
