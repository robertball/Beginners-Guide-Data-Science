Great smoothie! I froze my bananna first and left out the banana extract - I don't have any. I used skim milk and also added in some strawberries along with the strawberry yogurt to heighten the strawberry flavor. To make this a little extra frosty I threw in a little ice. Definitely a nice creamy treat!

As you can see from my name, I love smoothies! This one was to die for! I didn't have quite enough yogurt to make 2 batches so I did 1 1/2 batches and it was plenty for 2! I added ice to make it colder a little thicker, but that was all that I changed. THis was great!

Good Smoothie. I did change a few things though -- I didn't have banana extract so I used strawberry extract instead with an extra large banana. Also, I omitted the sugar. Still tasted yummy and a good healthy breakfast drink!

This was my first attempt ever at making a smoothie, and this was the PERFECT recipe! The only problem was I didn't have any banana extract so I just used two bananas. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added ice, but at 1 1/2 cups. I also left out the sugar as it was plenty sweet enough. Even the non-banana people in my house RAVED about this recipe! Thanks so much!

I really love this! I added about a cup of ice. I really loved the creamy consistency, and the yogurt added strawberry flavor without pesky seeds in every swallow!

Strawberries and banana together are a natural, so I knew I'd like this.  Didn't have banana extract and I don't know that I would have included it if I did. I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla instead.  I used Greek-style strawberry yogurt and replaced the white sugar with Splenda.  I also threw in a handful of fresh strawberries. Because I wanted it super cold, I chilled the banana for awhile, reduced the amount of milk a little and added ice cubes.

Well, I revised the recipe alot, so I'm not sure it's fair to rate this one.  But what I came up with is REALLY yummy.  I used 2 bananas, 1 6 oz vanilla yogurt, 1 6oz strawberry yogurt, 2 teaspoons banana extract, 3/4cup white milk and 3/4cup Nestle choc milk.  YUM!!

Pretty good smoothie, I did not have banana extract, so i just left it out, it still tasted great. I put 3 ice cubes in to make it more cold and thick. Will probably make again.

First things first... When I want a smootie, I expect one thing.... For it to be cold. Not room temperature. Second of all, there isn't enough strawberry flavor. I found the banana extract was highly unecessary and drowned out what little strawberry taste there actually was. To fix this, I sliced up about a half of cup of strawberries, a cup of crushed ice, 1 tsp Vanilla extract, and about 1/2 cup of plain non-fat yogurt. Once I was through with it, it was edible.

I replaced the sugar with honey and added ice as some other reviewers.  My boys added some peanut butter to theirs as they prefer that flavor in their smoothies but my daughter thought it tasted like a strawberry milkshake (before the PB was added)
Enjoyable.  Thanks

Loved this recipe!!!  Like some others I did make a few adjustments to lower to calories.
I used 2 bananas (no extract on hand), 1/2 skim milk, 7 fresh strawberries, 8 oz of non fat vanilla yogurt, and 2 t of raw honey. Plus I added fresh spinach & 1T of wheatgerm & 10 cubes of ice. If you have kids, this is a GREAT way to "hide" vegetables.  You can not taste them at all.  You can easily omit the wheatgerm and spinach.
Hope this helps!

Very good.  I had to make some changes because I didn't have exactly everything in the recipe.  Instead of 8 oz. of strawberry yogurt I used 6 oz. of vanilla yogurt.  I put in a cup of fresh strawberries to make up for not having the strawberry yogurt.  Being the yogurt was only 6 oz. instead of 8 oz. I put in 1 cup of milk rather then 3/4 cup.  I also put in only 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of 2.  All in all, it came out good.  I'd definitely make it again.

I just used what I had on hand: Hand full of frozen sliced strawberry's, one banana, a couple scoops of French Vinilla ice cream, and milk. Cold and tasty! Just about any variation of ice cream, vogurt, fruit and milk works great. Thanks for posting!

kids loved this and gobbled it right up! I think we'll also be experimenting with other yogurts (mixed berry ones especially). This recipe is pretty easy to switch up. We froze the banana first, worked well. Didnt add the extra sugar, you don't need it with the flavored yogurt and banana.

This really was fantastic and a great way to use up those over-ripe bananas.  I used others suggestions and added a few ice cubes and substituted honey for sugar.  A perfect, healthy snack.

Pretty good. My kids liked this a lot. I did add a tbsp. or so of flax seed. If I were to make this again, I'd omit the sugar. It's not needed, it's sweet enough on it's own.

I did liked this recipe. Only I figured that much yogurt would be too thick, so I added frozen strawberries to it, but it was still too thick. Next time I'll try 4oz of yogurt, 3/4 c of frozen strawberries, and about 1 cup of ice cubes. If you like thick, sweet and not too-sweet, you'll love this recipe. YUMMY :D

When looking for a strawberry banana smoothie, first thing I look for is the real fruit. I was shocked that the only strawberry in here is yogurt. I also never put extract in my smoothies so that can be left out. Using a banana is more than enough to give it a strong banana taste. It also doesn't need any sugar added. When blending smoothies with just fruit, it makes the fruit sugar more absorbable which leads to blood sugar spikes. (they advise adding a vegetable to slow that process down & avoid that). Adding some peanut butter also adds some protein. I also add protein powder and flaxseed powder to add protein & nutrients.

Very good smoothie!  I changed a few things...I didn't have banana extract so I didn't use that.  I used 1 cup of frozen strawberries instead of strawberry yogurt and instead of sugar, I used 1 pack of sweet n' low! I also added 2 ice cubes.  Great recipe!

This was really yummy. I made it first as written minus the extract which I didn't have and replaced with a few sliced strawberries. The second time I used only 4 oz. yogurt, omitted the extract & sugar and replaced milk  some crushed ice and about 1/3 cup of blueberry/acai juice..my new favorite breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy and yummy.  I did make some small changes.  No sugar.  Instead of banana extract I froze two bananas and used them.  It had a nice thick consistancy and just sweet enough.  My kids and I enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Very good! Small deviations from this recipe: I only used about 3/4 tsp banana extract and added no sugar. It was great! Thanks for posting.

This smoothie was very tasty! Instead of using banana extract, I used a large banana and also put in 4 ice cubes to make it a bit thicker.

This was so good!  My kids loved it!  As with others, I did not have banana extract, so I used 2 bananas instead of one.  I had Mixed Berry yogurt, so I used that in place of the strawberry yogurt and it tasted great.  I omitted the sugar, after reading others reviews that it tasted good.  I also added about a cup of ice - since my kids like it a little thicker and cold.  It was a hit here - made two batches, and it was gone!  Thanks for the recipe.

I would rate this 4 1/2 stars. 3 out of 5 really like it and 2 just dont have a taste for smoothies. I omitted the banana extract, I didnt have it and didnt really care to buy it just for this specific use. It didnt really need it anyways. I served this with banana nut bread off of this site for a nice school day breakfast. I am now the blend master queen according to the kids.

This was an awesome smoothie, even when I didn't have all of the necessary requirements.

This morning I was craving a Strawberry-Banana Smoothie and the first stop I made was AR.  I was lacking banana extract and yogurt.  Instead I used 1 cup fresh strawberries, 1 tsp vanilla extract and a glass of ice.  Delicious.

Great Smoothie Recipe! The only thing I did was add some ice and substitute Banana extract for Vanilla and used Splenda in place of Sugar. My bananas and Yogurt were frozen. Good consistency, not to thick or runny. Thanks!

I didn't use banana extract. It tasted more like a banana smoothie than a strawberry banana smoothie. It was still VERY good!!

Instead of using sugar try using some honey because it is naturally sweet and if there is any sugar in it I won't be much so the honey will be better for you

This was so good. I left out the banana extract and the sugar. I added ice to make it colder and thicker. It was such a great recipe.

I love this recipe!  My kids do not like eating fruit, so I have to find creative ways to get them  in.  This was simple and easy to make.  I substituted vanilla extract for the banana one.  I added cinnamon, too.  I used vanilla yogurt. The consistency was excellent, and it was super quick!  Thanks for sharing this!--Charla

Very tasty. I added 5 fresh strawberries and 2 cups of ice to stretch it and make it a bit colder.

very good, but this was for like 4 people!! Exellent flavor, though. I didnt have bannanna extract, but I think it would taste the same. Nice and quick, perfect for a lazy morning.

I didn't quite get this smoothie. It was more like strawberry milk and I even used a frozen banana. The flavor had a vitamin after taste too, for some reason. The only change, was I did not have banana extract so I subbed a little vanilla. Not sure that would affect the flavor that strongly. I was able to save it by adding some more frozen fruit, but the title is really misleading as it is not thick at all.

I liked it a lot but if you don't like a lot of banana I would either put more strawberries in or you less banana!

This recipe turned out awesome.  I made some changes, however, to lower the calorie count. I substituted soy milk for whole milk, fat free yogurt and  2 tsp splenda.  I figure it's about 170 calories per serving this way.  Enjoy.
