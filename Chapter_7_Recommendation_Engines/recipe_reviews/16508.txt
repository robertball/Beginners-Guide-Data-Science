the problem that everyone has with the cheesecake being runny is mostly attributed to the tofu. you need to press the tofu and remove a lot of its excess moisture prior to using it in the recipe. just draining the water from the tofu package isnt enough. after removing the tofu from the package and rinsing it off, wrap the tofu in some thick paper towels. then press down on the tofu, not so hard that it squishes, just enough to moisten the paper towels and remove some excess moisture. you may have to do this a few times over before youve removed a sufficient amount of water from the tofu.

This recipe, while delicious, is NOT vegan. Graham Crackers are made with honey, and thus not a vegan option. When I make this recipe I just line the finished cake with slivered almonds and unsweetened coconut. Please don't feed vegans graham cracker crust.

WAY BETTER than normal cheesecake.  I've made this several times and everyone loves it (even the kids who will never eat my cooking). To fix the texture issues others have mentioned, I used either medium or firm tofu (both worked), added a few tbsp flour, and backed WAY longer than specified (almost 50 minutes with medium tofu).  Also decreased the sugar a tad and sometimes add a splash of lemon juice to liven it up a bit. YUM!

This is excellent -- even the cheese-eaters loved it! I used half soft and half firm tofu, and also added a Tbsp of flour and a tsp of lemon juice, and used a pre-made shortbread crust. I made a simple berry sauce for the top. Unbelievably easy!

This tastes almost exactly like the real thing!! For me as a vegan, I love being able to have cheesecake without eating dairy.  I also found that if you don't have maple syrup or you want a different flavor, fruit flavored pancake syrup works just as well.

This cake is absolutely delicious, although it tastes more like a sort of custard than a cheesecake.  I baked mine closer to 45 mins, rather than 30 as the recipe suggests, because when  I looked in the oven after 30 minutes, it was still really pale.  Anyway, it turned out beautiful, and I can't believe how easy it is to make.

I used firm tofu that I drained for about 30 minutes, cut the sugar in half and baked for 50 minutes.  I did chill the pie overnight. It was so good I'm making another before I finish the first so I don't run out!  Next time I'm going to experiment with flavor and substitute coconut milk and top with pineapple.

This was fantastic. I read the other reviews and followed suggestions. I used vanilla soy milk, added extra vanilla, and baked longer than required. I didn't think it was going to turn out till I let it chill in the fridge for about 4 hours. I topped it with a homemade strawberry sauce and it disappeared in about 10 minutes. Everyone loved it.

The key to this cheesecake is to let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, otherwise all you can taste is the tofu.  Once the flavours have blended together i.e. once the sugar and vanilla have totally "infiltrated" the tofu, this pie is marvelous!

My brother who is a dairy-eating, meat-eating regular guy calls this "delicious pie"  He almost ate the whole thing. 

I, who am an always-vegetarian/ 80% vegan ( still can't always find vegan options with my lifestyle) ADORE this.  You can make it with stevia instead of sugar and cut down on some of the calories. 

Tip: Be sure to drain the tofu properly (press it on some papertowels ( put a papertowels, a cookbook, and a heavy can on top, and papertowels on the bottom) to avoid your pie/ cake getting runny.

This was just eh for us. I didn't think it tasted like cheesecake (yes more like a custartd), my dairy-allergic daugher (who's never had real cheesecake) didn't like it that much, won't make it again.

The flavor & texture were much more like a custard than cheesecake. But it tasted great. It did require almost an hr. of baking time to get it to set. After cooling I refrigerated it overnight and served it with cherry pie topping. The tartness of the cherries balanced out the sweetness of the cheesecake nicely. Thanks for posting this!  :)

This is a sweet, custard-like, vanilla flavoured cake. I made smaller tarts and they turned out well. They don't taste like tofu so this is even great to serve to proclaimed tofu haters. I'm going to keep experimenting with baking time for optimum moistness/firmness.

This is so so easy to make.  It takes me only 5-10 mins to mix and blend!  As I was using mini pie crusts, I cut the baking time to 15 mins. It tastes unexpectedly GOOD.  Now I can give a piece of Vegan Cheesecake to my son (who have problem with dairy and egg) when I'm eating the real cheesecake and not feeling guilty about it.

I drained the tofu and baked for fifty minutes.  I substituted xylitol and eriythilol (however that is spelled) for the sugar and I'm really pleased.  I'm making it again and adding in pumpkin puree.  This cheesecake is good as is and also a great base for variations.  Thank you for sharing

Pretty good recipe. It did take on the flavor of the maple syrup, but not bad for a vegan cheesecake! But I decorated the entire surface of the cheesecake with blueberries and strawberries which may have helped with the flavor (see picture). One of the reviews said that graham crackers were not vegan so I used sugar cookies instead for the crust..
I also used FIRM tofu which helped with the custard-like texture like another review said, but better custard-y then runny! :) Since the tofu is going to be blended anyways go ahead and squish that tofu up to remove the excess water.

I was very happy with this recipe! After doubting the maple syrup and reading negative comments about it, I changed the 1/4 cup maple syrup to 1/4 cup smashed banana. I cooked it for about 50 minutes, let it cool, drizzled lemon juice all over, and let it sit overnight, then topped with toasted coconut. It made a dreamy, creamy, banana/coconut cream combo. Divine! Not a cheesecake in the least, but I loved it.

Wooow, this cake was so good even my tofu-hating husband loved it!   I followed the suggestions and used only half the sugar, replaced the maple syrup for agave nectar (I didn't had maple syrup available) baked for 50 min and ended up chilling for 24 hours.  The result really was amazing, the color, the consistency were very similar to cheesecake, I also added a simple strawberry sauce and that really complements the pie, I would not try to make it without the sauce.  Will definitley make it again!

I made this for a friend who has a list of 72 severe food allergies. I used almond milk instead of soy, omitted the sugar, and used honey instead of maple syrup. The flavor was great, but the consistency was more of a custard, and almost half the volume was lost during baking.

Good cheesecake, except next time I will use less vanilla extract. In place of the maple syrup I used strawberry syrup. Not bad. I used silken firm tofu and the texture turned out great.

Well, I really just used this as a guideline because I WASN'T looking for a cheesecake type dessert, I just wanted to make a tofu-based dessert - and I try not to rate recipes that I totally change but in this case I felt the recipe deserved some credit for making a pretty good dessert, even WITH my drastic changes! I omitted soy milk and added 2 cups cooked pumpkin and some spices.  Ended up with a somewhat custardy-pumpkin pie dish that was excellent!  I think the term cheesecake is a misnomer here - maybe with added flour it would have that texture, and some lemon might give it the tartness... or maybe instead of the soy milk you used soy yogurt??? That might make it more cheesecake-like. Still, a good vegan dessert (if you use the right sugar) but more like a custard.  It has been added to my recipe box though!

This tasted just like sweet tofu--which is basically all it is. If you don't like tofu, don't even try this recipe. If you do, it's pretty tasty. If it wasn't for the crust, though, it'd have gotten 2 stars. Might have gotten 4 stars if I wasn't thrown off by somehow expecting this very simple recipe to be reminiscent of cheesecake... it wasn't.

the pie never really firmed up to desired texture although it could have been my oven. Also we thought it tasted more like flan than cheescake.

I made this last night & the flavor/texture when cooled were very unappealing. I tried it again today & it was much better. Make the day before! If you have someone with milk allergies this might be a nice treat for them... with fruit topping or maybe some walnuts. However, anyone who can have milk will only say they like it to be nice! Also~ mine baked 45 mins. before it was set. Normally I skip crusts, but decided to try one.

I usually don't rate when I alter a recipe, but I really liked this one.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used well drained firm tofu.  Also, instead of the soy milk, I used vanilla almond milk and a little lest of the vanilla extract.  I also baked it for 50 minutes.  The texture of the pie was really wonderful, but I'm not a fan of the taste of tofu and I could still distinctly taste it. But because this recipe is so easy and I liked the texture, I'm going to try it agin with other alterations, maybe adding some banana or, like another reviewer said, lemon.

I've never had tofu before, but I tried this recipe with an open mind because I LOVE cheesecake. The taste of sugar and syrup was just too strong for me. I'm not sure if the aftertaste I had was the tofu, or what, but it wasn't good. I followed the suggestion of pressing out some of the liquid in the tofu before using it, but the texture was still a little wattery and gritty. I can't say I liked it, but I love the IDEA of the recipe!

This definately tasted like a custard and the texture was all wrong. Next time (if there is a next time) I will use firm tofu because there was way too much moisture, even when I drained and pressed the tofu. It did taste good, especially with kiwis and strawberries, but it felt more like a breakfast food to me-i would never have labelled it cheesecake.

I used almond milk instead of soy, and made the crust myself (cookies, agave nectar, almonds, grapeseed oil in food processor) and I baked the cake about 15 mins extra. I wish the consistency was thicker. It was a bit too sweet, which is making me rethink the maple syrup in the future. I might just add a cup of blueberries instead, which may help gel up the consistency as well.

I'm not too sure about this recipe.  It didn't taste like cheesecake to me at all.  I mostly tasted maple syrup and the texture wasn't like a cheesecake.  It was light and whippy, not creamy like cheesecake.  Maybe it's because I used firm tofu?  I was hoping this would turn out like I expected.  I ate one piece and the rest of it sat in the fridge for a week. What a waste of ingredients.

I think I may have put a little too much sugar in - mine turned out very sweet. It was also almost bread-pudding like in texture. Tasty, but not quite what I expected!

I used a digestive crumb base and added flour and lemon juice like other reviewers suggested, and honey since I didn't have any maple syrup. The flavour was good, but I was hoping for a creamier texture. Maybe using firm tofu would have helped.

This was yummy, but came out more like a custard.  I made it with firm (not extra firm, just firm) tofu, which may have made it too dense.  It also was much sweeter than cheesecake.  I'm a little baffled.  This is a good dessert (and not terribly bad for you either), but just didn't come out anything like cheesecake for me!

good cake/pie in itself but not cheesecake or vegan...as someone else pointed out about the crust. Vegan cookie crusts can be found at Whole Foods or made from scratch. I added a splash of lemon juice and some nutritional yeast to get a cheesey flavor. The maple syrup adds a nice flavor too...if you use the real deal. Good toped with spiced apples/pears instead of berries with the heavy maple influence.

I always cook it for 30 min and place it directly in the fridge.  It is golden brown on top and firms up.  
I have made this several ways - thick with coconut, peanut buttery, adding chocolate syrup.  Often I end up putting in extra maple syrup.
I have loved this recipe for years.  It was even a huge part of my identity my freshman year of college.  I made at least one a week and often brought it to the dinning hall to share.  (While Salisbury University did a great job on meals, there wasn't much in the way of vegan desserts in 2001)

I forgot to read the comments. I usually do, but was in a hurry.  Not everybody is familiar with tofu (I was making this for my adult son who lives out of town and is vegan).  The recipe should state to press the tofu first.  After an hour of cooking, there is still a lot of liquid.  I took it out and am going to chill it overnight but I don't expect much to improve.  Oh, well.

Thought it turned out really great for a vegan cheesecake. My pan was bigger so it came out thinner which meant it baked in 30 minutes no problem. Made a black and blueberry compote to top it - yum. Made my own vegan graham cracker crust - 1st attempt, pretty crumbly but taste is good. Lowered sugar just a bit. Thanks so much!

i am not vegan. I just had a container of soft tofu to use up. I added one low fat cream cheese, 2 eggs and 1/3 cup of cacao powder and omitted the maple syrup and soy milk. i want to cut back on sugar and this recipe only had a 1/2 sugar instead of a 1.5 cups of sugar like some recipes

I am new to trying vegan recipes.  Have never used tofu.  I now have a runny cheesecake that won't set.  Looking at the older reviews, I didn't find the tofu very wet.  I used soft, I see that that could make a difference. I might try again if the family likes it.

My roommate and I made this for a girls night. It turned out runny, but we didn't press the tofu, so... We did, however, add a bit of cocoa powder to make the cheesecake chocolate, which was good. Honestly, I felt that it was more like mousse than cheesecake, but it was fun to make and pretty good.

I followed all of the instructions however adopted the advice of others and used firm tofu and cooked the cake for 45mins. I was worried during the coking process as the cake was literally boiling in the oven. It was very firm after I left it in the fridge for 3 hours. I found the flavor very average and still tasted quite strongly of tofu. I won't be making this again. For those who want to give it a go, I would stick to the silken tofu as I think it would give it a creamier texture which would be closer to true cheesecake. Firm tofu was a bit to firm.

Fantastic!  I used firm tofu, succanate sugar(dehydrated cane juice)and a shortbread crust and it is absolutely delicious.  A little sweet, could cut sugar to 1/4 cup.  Also, agree with cooking longer 50 min.  Great recipe and it's nice and easy.  Thanks
