This was a simple and yummy recipe.  I used canned marinara sauce and added sliced fresh mushrooms.  Served over angel hair.  Next time I might try to find a good, homemade tomato sauce.

I really liked this. I love bellpeppers. I made for only 2 people. 3 chicken breasts, 1 green bellpepper, 1 yellow bellpepper, 1/2 onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1 jar sauce, Italian seasoning, a little garlic salt, with whole wheat pasta. We will be eating the left overs for lunch.

This looked promising, but it was too bland. Simple, yes. Would require a lot of spices to tweak this to a palatable dish.

Easy enough, but way too bland! However, I substituted the recommended spaghetti sauce with another favorite that I had on hand. Still, I am going to try to rescue the rest of this tomorrow by adding tons of italian spices, red pepper flakes, and whatever else that looks promising.

This was very good and easy to prepare. I added a can of diced tomatoes to the sauce and topped it with pecorino romano cheese before serving. It turned out delicious.

This was the exact recipe I was searching for dinner today. I am 8mons pregnant and craving chicken with peppers and pasta. From the other reviews, I see its a bland recipe so I added plenty of spices and it tasted delishhhhh!!! Oh I used Penne pasta instead of spaghetti. :)
