These tasted great!  However, they could not be picked up to be eaten.  I will make them again using 1/2 cup more of the bisket mix and possibly one more egg.  My guests loved the flavor.

I took this to a cookout and it was gone in 30 minutes! I received numerous compliments and several recipe requests. I altered this recipe some, as I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and parmesan/romano cheese rather than just romano. Fabulous!

I followed the advise as suggested and added 1/2 c. of biscuit mix and an egg, and it was easier to pick up.  It took about 25 minutes to cook.  However, I was not impressed with this recipe.  I felt it was very so-so, nothing to write home about.  I probably won't make it again.  I took it to a picnic and it did get eaten, but no one made any comments about it.

Very tasty and a great way to use up some of my over abundance of zucchini!  I added 3 cloves of garlic, only because we love garlic. Even the kids loved this recipe!

The recipe was tasty but I found that it was too delicate to pick up.  I feel that it needs another egg and 20 min bake time is too short.  I will try it again with these modifications.  (BTW, I used Bisquick)

As other reviewers have advised, I increased the baking mix to 1 1/2 cup and added two eggs.  I used olive oil, a cup of cheese and 1/2 tsp cayenne.  I baked it in a loaf pan for 55 minutes and after it cooled, I sliced it as thin as I could and served it with steak and salad.  It was really very good, but I did make some changes from the original.

Great recipe! However I did make the changes as stated before 1 1/2 cup baking mix, 1 cup vegetable oil and 1 cup Romano and Parm. cheese. I added basil as well.

I read other reviews and made some changes. With my changes, the recipe is closer to 5. Changes were: 1. Mini muffins instead of cut squares. 2. Added1/2 cup more biscuit mix and another 1/2 egg. 3. Shredded the zucchini. 4. Olive oil. 5. A bit of cayenne pepper.    *it also took longer to cook than the recipe. Probably 30 minutes rather than 20.

This appetizer was a huge hit! I prepared it for a picnic and doubled the recipe. Fit perfectly in a large baking sheet pan. I did use a food processor and grated the zucchini. Allowed zucchini to drain before added to recipe. Flavor is great! Folks are always looking for fabulous zucchini recipes this time of year.

Followed several of the suggestions to insure that it stayed together and no luck. The flavor was also lacking. Pass on this one.

Turned out great, held together.  I added 1 more egg, substituted to olive oil, and changed to about 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  I also added store bought mango chutney to drizzle on individual bites.  Will make again!

I used shredded Zucchini and no oil at all.  I just mixed everything but the milk, then added milk until the dough was "biscuit-like".  It turned out a little drier, yes, but works well for my use; crumbled over scrambled eggs.

This was very quick, easy and tasty. My son is on a "no vegetables" kick and he ate most of this. If you let it cook for 5-7 minutes longer than suggested, you can get it separated a bit easier. Maybe it's my oven but that wasn't a huge problem for me. I also deviated a bit and used a Romano, Parmesan blend that I had on hand. It was very tasty and we used it for our Oscar party. There was a bit of tang that I didn't expect so I took off a star. Thank you for this recipe!

I should have read the reviews first before I made this.  Something is wrong with the recipe.  I will try and make it again.  It had a nice taste but the consistency was not good. I will use some of the changes that were previously suggested.

Very Tasty.  I grated 1 cup of zucchini and sliced 2 cups.  I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 applesauce.  I added bunches of fresh parsley and a little thyme instead of dried.  I used two big cloves of garlic and lots of fresh grated pepper.  I put a tad bit of parmesan and a little grated cheddar on top.  It held together and was tasty.

This came out pretty well but I will use grated zucchini next time instead of sliced.
