I was looking for something to do with the pork in my fridge when I came across this recipe. I had most of what it called for, so I gave it a shot. Very good! I didn't have any chilis though, so I felt like it might have been missing something. The dish was kind of overpowered by the cilantro. But both me and my boyfriend really enjoyed it and will probably make it again. Thanks!

Substitutions: Doubled the garlic, used sunflower oil instead of peanut, didn't use any fish sauce, chilis, or ground white pepper, and used chives in place of spring green onion.

This was very tasty.  I had two grilled and smoky rubbed pork chops to use up, so I diced them and used for this, modifying the prep a bit.  I also used tomato wedges VS cherries, as that's what I had on hand.  Simple and good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

I tried this recipe tonight as recommended except left out the tomatoes and lime juice. Next time I think I will put the white onion in when I put the garlic in, because I like my onion a little more cooked... I think this is excellent.. I have been looking for a fried rice recipe that taste like the pork fried rice we get When you follow all the directions with the oils, spices, etc, this has such a great taste you can literally eat a bowl full and want more...  Again, excellent.... Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

Pretty good... followed the recipe as instructed. Wasn't my favorite, and I haven't had the desire to make it again, but that could be just personal tastes, nothing wrong with the recipe itself.

I was using up cooked pork sirloin steaks and vegetables on hand.  I liked that it had less rice compared to other ingredients unlike more traditional fried rice.
