This recipe has it all. The glaze took all of 2 minutes to stir together. The chicken comes out tender. It has a sweet, salty, pungent, spicy glaze. The chicken goes great with rice and stir fried/steamed vegetables.

Absolutely delicious and so easy!  I used about 7 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and it worked just as well.

I just made this using a "harvest chutney" from my local farmers' market, and boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  My husband and I both LOVED it...this is finding a permanent spot in my recipe file!  Tender, juicy, and flavorful...this is good enough to serve to company!

This chicken recipe has it all.  It's sweet.  No - it's spicy.  No - it's tart.  An all out assault on your taste buds.  Fun to say, easy to make.  It has turned into a househould favorite.

This recipe was pretty good. It was easy to make, however my husband was not real impressed. The sauce is good if you like that sort of sweet taste.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the sauce didn't thicken at all, it tasted very bad, and the ingrediants just didn't seem to taste good together at all...we had to throw them on the grill with bbq sauce to save the chicken. Not going to attempt again.

I thought this was easy to make, but I eliminated the garlic and used red pepper flakes instead of the pepper sauce.  I think the recipe is good, the pepper came out strong the first time that I tried it.

It was disappointing and nothing sticky about it. The "sauce" was more like juice it was so runny. I see no point for all that oil also since there is always so much fat coming off the chicken and skin. It had no flavor.

Flavor was okay - sauce did not stick to the chicken like I thought it would.

Not bad!  Substituted hoisin and honey for the chutney...also added some fresh ginger.  Took a bit longer to bake 6 drumsticks...about 1 hour....and I left it at 400 degrees the whole time.

Good, but not outstanding.  It had a good flavor and was fairly easy to make, but nothing special.

Was looking for something to do with the mango chutney I picked up and this worked out great.  I used whole boneless, skinless breasts.  I'd recommend something cheesey on the side.  Scalloped potatoes or some such.  Very easy recipe.

Thanks sticky chicken!

I found this had great flavour but was way to saucy/runny.  I found cooking it more the second time in a flat open pan helped.

Not really very memorable. I liked the idea of being able to use frozen chicken and an easy sauce, but there are really better things to do with your chicken that are just as easy. Probably won't be making this again.

I made this recipe but left out the vegetable oil -- completely unnecessary. The sauce had a nice heat and  sweet caramelization. I cooked it for 45 minutes at 400 and then out it under the broiler for 5-10 minutes.
