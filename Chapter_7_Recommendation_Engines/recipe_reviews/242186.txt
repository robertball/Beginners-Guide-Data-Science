Another option for this is 1 pound hamburger, one pound sausage with no taco seasoning being added (this recipe was submitted by me years ago and I just realized it had been published) it does taste a little different done with the sausage, but both ways are delicious.  I was considering making this today already, logged on here and found notifications and reviews. Thanks for trying it everyone :) Angie

Good but it makes TONS.  I think I would half the recipe if I ever made it again.

Made as written except that I used the entire jalapeno pepper. This came out pretty good and I actually preferred it over similar cheese dips I've had in the past. Most use a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies such as Rotel and I've always thought the diced tomatoes overpower so the tomato sauce was a nice change. I thought the green chilies  might overpower in this one but they didn't. The one thing I think needs changed in this recipe is to drain the beef/onion mixture before adding the taco seasoning to eliminate some of the grease. Overall I was pleased and will definitely make this again for football parties.

Absolutely amazing!!! I added my own twist to it and my husband really loved it. Thanks to you I didnâ€™t have to make spaghetti, meatloaf, or hamburgers with the ground beef I got out for dinner!!
