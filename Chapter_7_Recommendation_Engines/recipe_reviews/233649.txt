This is a keeper!  Watch out though - this makes a LOT of dressing, more than one salads worth.  That is OK - it keeps well and is delicious.  A couple of notes:  for the salad dressing I used 2 tsp of kosher salt instead of the 1 Tablespoon called for and it was fine.  I also added about 2 Tablespoons fresh sweet onion to the dressing and blended it in.  That was a nice addition.  Thinly sliced red onion would be great in this salad and add even more color to a beautiful dish.  Thanks Rhonda - you have a winner here!

Light-tasting, lovely, delicious little salad!  I cut the dressing amount in half, and I have some left over to try on some cut-up fruit!  This is simply delicious.  However, I might cut back on the sugar a bit, next time.  I used avocado oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this salad. Made the dressing with about half the sugar and it still turned out great!

I made this a staple! I love it! It’s light but hearty. I do add a handful of spinach and some cabbage, carrot mix. I also add some sesame sticks to the top. Delicious
