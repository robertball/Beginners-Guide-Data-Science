Mmmmmmmmm these were so good! Made exactly as stated. I cooked them in a small amount of butter and they had such good flavor and texture. Hubby said "hmmm these are pretty good!" kids loved them too. Makes a lot so I'll be freezing the rest for busy school mornings to pop into the toaster. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent.  Since I didn't have poppy seeds and all purpose flour on hand, substitutions included 1 c buckwheat flour instead of whole wheat flour; 2 teaspoons of cardamom seeds instead of poppy seeds; and added 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom powder after reading a recipe blog about a banana bread paleo recipe, which incorporated cardamom. Next time will try adding the optional blueberries since the cardamom spice jar recommends using cardamom in blueberry muffin recipes.

Turned out very well. Substituted chia seeds for the poppy seeds because that's what I had on hand. Did 1/2 of a batch,  which was plenty for my 2 teenagers and me.  Thumbs up from me and 2 kids!

Delicious!!!! Had all the ingredients on hand, except two— coconut oil and blueberries!! So I used canola oil and raisins!!! Perfect!!! Also, 1 cup of really ripe mashed bananas worked!!!  Let the batter set  a few minutes to thicken while the griddle preheats.  My yield was 24- 4 inch pancakes!!! Reheat them in the toaster for a freshly made taste! Because of the honey used,  DEFINITELY cook at a lower griddle temp— medium low; 2 minutes per side worked perfectly!!!

These are delicious with half the coconut oil.  I agree that the honey isn't needed, but it does add flavor, and I think you can just use less syrup to compensate.

These were super tasty! I didn’t have poppy seeds so I subbed chia seeds. I also didn’t have milk so I subbed almond milk. Other than that I followed the recipe exact. Even my somewhat picky of pancakes three year approved! I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I saved this recipe almost a month ago and just now made it this morning. Why oh WHY did I wait so long?! This is a wonderful recipe that offers deeeelicious flavors but also fills the kitchen with mouthwatering aromas will cooking. Absolutely no need for any syrup and is perfect either with or without the blueberries.

This was really good. Made it exactly as stated. Better than what I would have expected. It was tasty, and the kids loved it.  I would like to try it again next time, without the coconut oil but just regular vegetable oil (i'm not a fan of coconut oil).
