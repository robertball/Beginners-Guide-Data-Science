I made this for a graduation brunch and it was a show stopper. Everyone wanted the recipe. VERY easy to make.

This was great and so easy! I took it to a carry in and everyone loved it! I increased the peaches by 1/3rd because it didn't have enough fruit for me. I must say don't use krispie creme donuts I thought it would make it over the top. It did, but was almost too sweet!

This is almost identical to Paula Deen's "Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding" recipe.  Not that there's anything wrong with that!  I love the name, and love the cobbler/bread pudding even more.

Super!  I halved the recipe and it was plenty.  It tasted like a peachy doughnut!  I think there is a mistake on the recipe.  If you follow the glaze recipe as written, it never gets to spreading consistency.  You have to add milk to thin it out.  But this recipe was unbelievably delicious and I can't wait to make it for my next potluck!

I made this for the office staff at our school and everyone loved it.  Personally, it was a little over-the-top sweet for me, but these ladies gobbled it up!!

The man loved it. I knew he would! It was so sweet I could barely eat a few bites. I will make this again, with a few changes - I will use day old cake donuts instead of the glazed ones so that they hold up a little better in the baking, more like bread pudding. I will add a little milk to the glaze, and probably only use 1/2 of it. I will also add more fruit. Thanks for a fun, well received  quick dessert!

A little too sweet for me.  It only took about 1 1/2 dozen doughnuts to fill the pan.  There must be a mistake in the recipe because you have to add milk to the glaze, otherwise its just a powdery paste.  My family seemed to like it and my niece and nephew loved helping tear up the doughnuts.  Might make it again, with unglazed doughnuts next time?

Got rave reviews at the fire station...made it for my hubby to take to work....the guys LOVED it....he even said he thinks he likes it better than a "regular" cobbler! What I did different was cut the recipe in half, used an 8x8 pan, used 2-16oz cans of LIGHT peaches in juice, not the one with heavy syrup, and omitted the salt, didn't need it. Also omitted the glaze on top. The dish rose so big and pretty, the donuts were SO sweet it didn't need anymore sweetness to it.  Such an easy dish to throw together and it was so delicious!!

It only needs a dozen and a half doughnuts.  I personally would add more peaches.  There just wasn't enough for me.  Also I would not make the glaze with butter.  When I added the butter to the confectioners sugar, it turned into a dough-like mass. I added milk tothe mixture, and then when I poured it over the cobbler, it turned to soup. Next time, I will just make it with milk instead. Other than that, great recipe!!! Tastes delicious. The family loved it.

Waited to try this until fresh peaches were available. I used 1/2 glazed donuts and 1/2 cake donuts, plus instead of canned peaches I sliced up 6-7 fresh peaches and added about 1/2 cup water to the mixture.  I didn't want the sweet sweet drizzle so didn't make that and the peach cobbler is VERY good.  Great with ice cream or just milk.

I used fewer donuts than called for, but other than that did it just the way it was written.  The people I made it for loved it.  One man said that he wouldn't be able to eat anything sweet for the rest of the day because he wanted to remember the taste of Cop Cobbler.  Another said that it was the best thing to come out of the kitchen since he could remember.  Very good.  Thanks for posting this.

A definite must try, as its very easy and tasty. I used real peaches, as I work on a farm and they're in season. I also used half plain donuts and half glazed(as suggested by other members).
The sauce is VERY sweet....so you may want to add a little less butter and a little milk to cut the richness.
Will make again!!

The colleagues I served this to loved it.  I did not make the glaze, but look forward to adding that next time.
