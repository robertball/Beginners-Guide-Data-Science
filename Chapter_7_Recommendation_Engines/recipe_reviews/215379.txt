I've never rated before, but this recipe is too good to go without stars!  These were so light and delicious, not heavy.  I was worried because the dough was so soft, but they came out perfect.  Nect time I'll add more cinnamon, that's literally the only flaw!

This rating is for the dough only.  It came out wonderful and the addition of the potatoes was new to me; I always like trying new things and this was easy.  I used a different filling:  1/3 cup butter, 1 cup packed brown sugar and 2 1/2 tbls of cinnamon.  YUM.

Excellent recipe.  The dough is indeed soft, but kneading on a floured service made it a workable dough for me.  Note for others like me without a kitchen aid mixer.  The dough crept up my hand mixer and almost ruined it.  Mix by hand after the first 4-5 cups of flour.  And like all allrecipe users, I changed the recipe.  I used 2 cups of potato water, since it was already hot, Added 2 tsp of vanilla to the dough, and used half brown half white sugar and added a pinch of cloves to the filling.    Definitely double the icing recipe.  (Next time I'm going to add orange zest)  Thank you for the recipe from a fellow Iowan!  :)

This has become my favorite recipe out of the many ones I've tried and they are a must for my bake sales. The Potatoes break up the gluten in the flour making the dough tender and melt in your mouth, so you don't have to worry about fussing with it so much. Its easy for first timers just don't over work your dough and it will stay tender. (Personally stickier the better!)  I usually make up my own "brown" sugar for the filling its cheaper just to add a tsp of molasses per cup of white sugar.  I also add some nutmeg to the dough for a nutty touch. A tip for even rising/baking I always slice them no more than 1 1/2 " thick with a long piece of floss (slide under and cross them over) and then gently smash them down in the pan so they are spread out evenly. That way they don't bake so lop sided. or one edge rises higher and burns.

If I could give this recipe 100 stars... I would.  These are by far the very best Cinnamon rolls that I have ever had.  This was also my first time ever attempting to make cinnamon rolls, and they were very easy to make.   One thing that I should mention though.  If you are using a standard size Kitchen Aid mixer, after you add all of the flour, your mixer will have trouble kneading the dough.  I kneaded it on my counter a few times, divided it in half, and proceeded to knead just one half of the dough at a time in the mixer.  Worked out great because then I just let the dough rise separated and didn't have to divide it later.  Awesome recipe!!  I wouldn't change a thing!!

Best Cinnamon Rolls EVER!!! I make them exactly how the recipe calls. I will put a dozen in the oven and preset my oven to start in the morning. The other dozen I cover and put in the freezer for the next weekend. Works out awesome!! One tip that was told to me, mix the butter and sugar/cinnamon together and spread together. When you cut the cinnamon/sugar doesn't fall out. Works great!!!

Only thing I suggest is using brown sugar in the middle rather then cinnamon, and using more then it suggests

With a less than stellar record with home made bread, I was reluctant to try this.  I was so glad I did!  They came out absolutely perfect.  I didn't change a single thing from the recipe and it came out great.  Just be aware that it makes a lot of cinnamon rolls.  they were melt in your mouth good!  They were even better than the renouned "Johnson's Corner" rolls...WAY BETTER!  I may tinker with this recipe by adding a few nuts or raisins but definitely worth trying without!

These cinnamon rolls are AWESOME!!!!!  I will admit the dough is very soft and sticky but the result is well worth it.  They are so light and fluffy that they literally melt in your mouth.  I will make these again and again and again.

I halved the recipe because I only need a dozen rolls, and even so I managed to get 14 nice sized rolls. The dough really is wonderful, light, melts in your mouth like everyone says. For the filling, I also used brown sugar and probably 2 tbsp of cinnamon, plus I added raisins and pecans. I also added cream cheese to the frosting. These looked at tasted professional if I do say so myself! This is going to be my go to recipe for cinnamon rolls! Next time I will probably make double the frosting (or not half what is listed) because we like our rolls gooey and smothered in it...they were a little dry with the halved recipe.

Delicious!! The actual bread part was super moist and flavorful even after a week. The dough was so soft and sticky I was afraid it wasnt going to bake properly but I just followed the recipe to a  T and it worked out perfectly! Only thing i got complaints about and didn't like was the icing. I ended up making a vanilla glaze with 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and enough (4-6 tsps)  milk to reach a drizzling consistency which was heavenly and went perfectly with the rolls oh and make sure you mix the waters, eggs, yeast and 2 cups flour by hand and then transfer to your mixer for the rest of the flour because I tried mixing all that in my kitchen aid mixer on the lowest spd and ended up with water flying everywhere!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe. Change nothing. Perfect as is. Wonderful, moist, sugary sweet, and melts in your mouth. What more could you ask for from a cinnamon roll?

I made the recipe exactly as directed for the dough.  The only tough part was rolling it out.  It was so sticky that I ended up adding almost a full cup of flour.  Also, I did put all items in a breadmaker on the dough cycle, so it was a snap.  Unfortunately, I ran an errand for the last 30 minutes and the dough overflowed a ton.  Except for the mess, the breadmaker will be the way to go if I cut the recipe in half or watch it carefully at the end.  Having tried the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe, I decided to try another because the only thing lacking for that recipe was a softer dough.  This was it!  For the filling, I used the "clone" filling of 1/3 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and 2   1/2 T cinnamon.  I also used the same frosting from that recipe too.  I have only tried the two recipes for cinnamon rolls, and this one definitely has a nice, soft dough.

Super tasty. Very, very soft. The roll breading perfect. Here's the deal. DOUBLE the sugar and the cinnamon for the "filling."  Another thing. I bake these in cast iron pans. That gives them a crispy bottom.

Very, very good cinnamon buns, allthough I altered the recipe a little bit. I used 1 cup of hot whole milk instead of 1 cup of hot water. (I'm used to using milk for more cake doughs and water for more bread type of doughs.)
The buns are so fluffy and have just the right sweetness.
Will deffently use this recipe again!!!

They turned out well.  I doubled the filling (using brown sugar not white) and added raisins in one batch and walnuts in the second.  I found using mashed potatoes finicky because it was quite a bit more work.  (I did save time by making extra and using them for supper.)  Also this isn't the 'best' recipe, but I haven't found the 'best yet either.  I am looking for one that has a bread like consistency and is very 'stretchy' - if that is the right description, when you are eating it. More like 'bread' than a 'pastry'.  My boss used to make cinnamon buns for the restaurant I worked at and they were the BEST. This recipe has a denser texture and the bun doesn't stretch when you pull it apart.  But worth making, no one will complain!! I also added cream cheese to the icing, and used just the potato water, as suggested. Like someone commented, 'the water was already hot' (plus I had enough because I made extra potatoes for supper) The recipe was too large for my Kitchen Aide, again like someone else noted, so I mixed it the best I could then turned it out on the counter and finished kneading it. You could probably get away with halving the recipe because it makes two large pans.

A few additional tips for improving these awesome rolls: For the 1 hour rise, place the dough in an OFF oven, with a small crockpot that is on and heating 2 cups of water. This will provide a warm, humid environment for your dough to rise. And for the filling,  definitely double the ingredients, use brown sugar, and substitute 1 tsp of the butter with 1 tsp of walnut oil, this will make it much more spreadable and will eliminate the problem of the filling falling out when cutting into circles. Hope these tips help!

This is the best recipe I have ever baked. The dough is so light and fluffy.  I doubled the amount of brown sugar and tripled the amount of cinnamon.  They are award winning!

I made mini-bons - about 6 dozen!!  Guess this should be called a custom recipe by the time I was done with the changes.  By the way, my first time cooking cinnamon rolls, and they turned out awesome!!!  Sooo easy!!! - kitchenaid mixer isn't big enough for increasing recipe size - cut the dough lengthwise after adding the filling and roll from the center edge out.   - Cinnamon instead of flour dusted on my working surface when rolling - I used sooo much more cinnamon than called for, (over a bottle) - heavy whipping cream instead of milk works fine (I was out of milk) - used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar - shook cinnamon onto the dough before adding the filling - added more filling to the top before baking...  - Cooked for an hour at 350, kicked it up to 400 for another 15 minutes or so.  Just looked at the edges, not sure why it took so long, but they turned out soft... My oven is not off on temp.

While they still are not Cinnabon quality they're pretty darn close. The main reasons they're NOT Cinnabons is the texture is more breadlike versus cake like. However I read one rater say they added milk instead of hot water to get that consistency. The other is there's not enough filling as others have mentioned. BUT this is definitely a keeper recipe, just wish they didn't take so long with all the different componenets. My tips are: make a big batch of taters, take what you need for rolls and freeze the rest and I also flash froze half this batch (12) on wax paper and then placed in freezer bag. When you're ready for a roll let them finish last rise buy letting them thaw until almost doubled and bake!

This recipe is fantastic. For the filling I use Browwn sugar instead of granulated sugar because I find that it melts better. I als add a lot more cinnamon. I have also added a can of pumpkin to it and took away the 1 cup of mashed potatoes. When I make the pumpkin ones I put pecans in the filling and make a maple icing.

WOW! You have got to try the rolls... truly fantastic! I took the advice one reviewer and mixed the butter, cinnamon and sugar (brown) together. It made sense that doing so would prevent the sugar from spilling out after they were cut. I would NOT recommend doing this. Mixing them all together formed a paste that was impossible to spread and started to tear the dough. I put the 'paste' to the side and followed the recipes instructions by spreading the butter and sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar. Before rolling it up, I lined the edge of the dough closest to me with a line of the sugar paste. I didn't want to completely waste the paste and figured lining the edge would ensure my rolls had a gooey center. It worked beautifully. I used a serrated knife in short sawing motion and the rolls retained their shape while cutting. My family prefers cream cheese icing so I added 8oz of cream cheese and only used 3T of milk. If you add cream cheese be sure to cream it with the butter before adding the other ingredients. I only needed 12 rolls so froze the rest as well as the left over icing. All in all these are the BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever had. My family also LOVED them so I'll definitely make them again.

Did anyone else have to add an awful lot of extra flour?  The dough seemed so sticky;  even after the first rising I had to add some more flour.  I let the dough rise a second time and then cut them into rolls.  The dough still seemed awfully sticky to me, but maybe this is part of what makes them so light and moist?  Anxous to try them in the morning.

I am not sure what happened to my dough but it turned out very sticky and I added more flour than what was called for.  Despite that, the dough came out pretty awesome!  So soft and not at all sweet so the dough can actually be used to make regular dinner rolls.

Very yummy! And a recipe that I will continue to go back to. I followed the recipe, except for using 1/2 cup brown sugar with 1/2 cup granulated sugar in the the filling. Because the recipe makes so much, I experimented and placed half of my rolls in the fridge to rise overnight for the second rise. The other half of the batch I let rise right away in a warm spot, for an hour or so and then baked. The ones that were refrigerated overnight didn't rise as much as the others. I think in the future that I will just let them rise and bake the same day, rather then doing the overnight refrigerator method. They can always be warmed in the microwave and taste just as good and are larger, that way.

Absolutely wonderful!!  This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and they are divine!  I didn't have real potatoes so I made a cup of instant potatoes and just used plain water in place of the potato water.  They turned out perfect.  My husband said they were the best he's ever had.
Just one note - next time I will wait the 15 minutes before putting on the frosting (as hard as that is).  I feel like it weighed down the soft centers while they were still hot and made them seem gooey.
I cut the recipe in half and got 16 rolls.  All of which will likely be gone by tomorrow.

This recipe is amazing and turns out great! I substituted whole wheat flour and added ground flax meal in with the cinnamon sugar mixture for an extra health kick - it tasted great and my friends didn't even know it was in there. Definitely a recipe that I'll use again.

Absolutely amazing!!! 5 stars is not enough. This is a 10 star recipe without a doubt. The addition of potatoes makes this recipe. I will never again make breads or rolls without adding mashed potatoes. Potatoes is what makes these rolls moist and tender. 

I have no idea why potatoes makes such an enormous difference, although I did attempt to find out why. If anyone knows the science behind mixing yeast and potatoes, please reply. I tried for a couple of hours yesterday to find the answer but came up empty.

When making these rolls I did follow a couple of tips from previous posters. Mixing the butter, sugar, and cinnamon really does help keep the filling in place when rolling. Also, dental floss for cutting is the best way to cut dough.

Loved this recipe, I did add instant vanilla pudding to the filling and used creamed cheese instead of butter. Rolls were light and fluffy and delicious.  Will make again.  I also got almost 3 doz. rolls and made a tea ring also.  Great.

I look forward to making these again.  As others suggested, I changed the filling to brown sugar and cinnamon.  I also made the rolls the night before and covered the slices in the pan with Saran wrap and a towel on top.  They still rose in the refrigerator and just baked them in the morning.  It was a huge time saver.

The BEST Cinnamon rolls ever...have been testing out recipes for years and this is the one to keep.  I used margarine instead of butter  and it turned out so well, I will stick with margarine for this recipe. Has anyone tried using this for dinner rolls?  Just minus all the filling?

The dough for this cinnamon rolls is the best I've made, hands down. However, I was worried they would not be sweet enough and added more sugar in the filling and increased the amount of frosting I used. I wished I had not done that. They are very sweet, and I'm sure the orignal recipe would've been perfect. Oh well, live and learn! Next time, I will make these exactly as written.

This is one of the finest cinnamon roll recipes in existence.  I don’t make them very often because they require some planning.  If I make cinnamon rolls it's usually on a whim and I either don't have potatoes or feel like taking the extra time to cook the potatoes. With the leaves starting to turn and Fall in the air, I felt it was time to pull out an old comfort food classic:  Cinnamon rolls and chili.  A combination that is customary in my neck of the woods.  I make the dough as written, but like so many others, I use brown sugar in the filling instead of white sugar.  Normally I would use a different icing, but was out of cream cheese so I followed the recipe.  I like a lot of icing, so I doubled the amount. It's o.k., but nothing beats a good cream cheese icing.   I’m always left asking myself why I don’t make these more often because they are definitely worth it.

This is the first time ever I have made cinnamon rolls.  I have always been a bit "scared" to make anything with yeast.  Oh my gosh, I cannot believe I made something so absolutely wonderful. Everyone loved them.  The recipe made over 24 rolls and the dough was soooo good. I agree the icing needs to be increased at least by half although, everyone said the bread was so wonderful they did not want to cover up the taste.  I would also give the recipe more stars if I could.

OMG!! I followed the recipe to the letter for the dough only and I can't believe it was I who made this. The texture of this was as if it came from a professional bakery.It would have never occured to me to use mashed potatoes and potato water in a dough. This is absolutely the best results I have received out of all the bread and dough recipes I have tried from this site. I usually achieve great results from most of the recipes submitted on this site. I'm pleased to say that this is now my "go to" recipe for the dough for making cinnamon rolls. As for the filling and the icing,I did my own thing adding more cinnamon to the filling and making a cream cheese frosting in the place of the icing.
Thank you for sharing this.

I read all the reviews and was almost afraid to make these rolls ;-) because everybody was talking about how good they were, how they were melting in the mouth. But it also encouraged me to try these. I'm so happy and relieved I did and that I can say the same: they ARE melting in your mouth and they ARE the best rolls ever! and it was easy and fun to make. I'm thrilled that I can make these myself now, many many many thanks for this recipe and all the reviews!

About the yeast:
I don't have here Fleischmann's yeast and my yeast must be mixed dry in the flour. So I mixed first the eggs and about 2 cups of flour in the potatomixture and added then the flour/yeast mix cup by cup. I also didn't use a kitchenaid, just first a whisk, then a wooden spoon and when this was also too heavy my hands.
From Annemarie in Hurghada in Egypt.

Wow, these rolls were a lot of work but soooo worth it, my husband ate 3 before I could snatch them away. I did make a few changes like adding a cup of chopped pecans that I toasted in butter before sprinkling over the warm frosting. And I used the Cinnabon Clone recipe for both the frosting and filling. I also had to add quite a bit more flour to the dough since it was too sticky to work with. I will definitely be making these again for guests over the holidays!

such an INCREDIBLE recipe. the formula is near to perfect & the rolls turn out so light and satisfying.

I added a little more cinnamon & a about 1/2 cup brown sugar to the filling.

I also added 3-4 tablespoons of sour cream to the icing recipe which added made for a delicious twist.

Definitely worth 5 stars!!

This is almost exactly the same recipe that I use.  My husband tells everyone they are the BEST cinnamon rolls he's ever had.  If you want something different and easy on the icing, try canned creamed cheese frosting, and put it on while the rolls are still warm. (I discovered this on Christmas morning when I was out of powdered sugar.) Very yummy!

Absolutely wonderful!! So moist and tender.  I made the dough exactly like the recipe and it came out perfect.  For the filling, I used half white sugar, half brown sugar and I tripled the cinnamon (no, it wasn't too much).  I made my own cream cheese icing.  This will be my staple cinnamon roll recipe for sure!

Best cinnamon rolls recipe ever!  I have tried several cinnamon roll recipes over the years, and they all turned out hard and tough.  1st time trying this recipe and they melt in your mouth, soft, tender and delicious.  I used brown sugar instead of white in the filling and doubled the filling and icing recipe, because you can't ever have too much cinnamon, brown sugary goodness.  The whole family LOVES them, The 4 of us will go through 24 of them in no time.

These were really good. I didn't change anything, except using more cinnamon and sugar for the filling. I didn't quite double it, but could have and it would have been fine. I loved the light and fluffy texture of these rolls, but my family preferred the Clone of a Cinnabon from this site that I made the weekend before. I do prefer the filling and the cream cheese frosting from that recipe, but I like the texture of this one!

These are so good!!  I did contemplate 4 stars though b/c I feel like they need to be baked with foil over top until the end... When I baked mine the outside was almost too done while the inside wasn't done enough.  I baked in the type of pan called for and checked them often.  I ended up taking them out of the oven even though the inside wasn't fully baked b/c they would have burned otherwise.  Aside from that though they really tasted great and next time I'll just cover with foil and bake until almost done, then remove to bake to a golden brown.

I don't know if I did something wrong but I wasn't blown away by these. They were decent though. I added more cinnamon sugar and I still thought they were lacking something. The dough was also a lot stickier than I thought it would be like a lot of others posted. It was my first time making cinnamon rolls though and I think they came out pretty good considering.

I love this recipe the rolls are so fluffy. Made as stated but have changed white sugar to brown and double the cinnamon. Absolutely wonderful!

They were very good!  Could definitely change them easily by adding different toppings, nuts...I just had a little trouble rolling them tight enough.  I'm sure I just need more practice...:)

Wow, great cinnamon rolls!  I've tried a dozen cinnamon roll recipes in my life time and this is by far the best.  The potato in this recipe creates a wonderful moist roll that keeps well in the refrigerator if they last longer than a day.  I sent a batch to my brother & wife for Christmas and they loved them also. These rolls won first place in our home!

They were satisfying, but not a big deal. My family said they were a little plain, and I agree. I was hoping for something a little thicker and and fluffy. It was disappointing. I probably wont make this again.

I realized early into making these that I only had 7 cups of flour, so I literally poured in half the already mixed potato butter sugar water mixture and proceeded to halve the remainder of the recipe (1 egg and 4 1/4 cup flour).  That was really plenty! 12 decent sized rolls!  I'd only do the full recipe if serving more than 6-8 people.  I have learned with first time using whole wheat flour in several recipes that it is heavier.  I think, from this point on, I'll mix regular and whole wheat flour. I also didn't get the rise I wanted (some but not awesome) in the time frame I needed (it is below zero outside and our house is at 67, even with the oven on, there isn't much "warm" air to help).  They were still fluffy, but not as fluffy if I had used standard flour and helped (& waited) with warmer air for rise. I mixed in raisins.  I added 1 tps of almond extract to the cinnamon sugar middle and cut some of the butter.  Mixed it together before spreading all together.  For the halved frosting, I used 2 tbs cream cheese, 1 tbs butter and vanilla flavored silk for the milk.  The frosting was perfect for me in amount and flavor.

Made them again with a few changes: used bread flour and buttermilk in place of the hot water. They were "absolutely positively the best cinnamon rolls ever!" (my husband's words) 

My husband said they were the best; my son rated them superb!  I used the filling from the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe along with their cream cheese icing.  It's amazing how simply adding mashed potatoes can make these cinnamon rolls so moist!

Delicious!! Really great recipe and easy to make. Perfect texture and taste. I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the icing. I didn't have bourbon vanilla extract so I just added 1/4 tsp bourbon to the icing. Also added fresh lemon juice to icing. This is a keeper!!!!

Very good. Probably not amazing enough to warrant the time it took to complete all of the steps in the recipe. I like to cook, so it was fun to put in the effort, but I must admit that a quality store bought roll is not that different. Trader Joe's "Jumbo Cinnamon Roles" are very similar, cheap, quick, and also non-hydrogenated. For this recipe, I definitely needed to double the icing, I used a brown sugar/cinnamon/chopped pecan filling, and I added raisins to some and not to others. Both versions were tasty.

Wow, success! ! This is a great recipe. I was able to make 3 dozen from the original recipe of 24 servings. Big, light and fluffy. I baked one pan and flash froze the other 2 pans before the last rise. I did add more of the cinnamon sugar/butter mixture per previous reviews and it was perfect for the size the dough swelled out to. They baked up more tender on the edges when I used the disposable aluminum type pan compared to my darker, everyday pan. This was my first try at cinnamon rolls and was pretty impressed with the results. You won't want to miss out on these, try it!!!

Wow...best cinnamon rolls I've ever made.  I halved the recipe for my family of 5...although next time I'll make the full recipe because everyone loved it so much!  They were light and fluffy and gooey and perfect!  I did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and added more cinnamon and walnuts to the filling.  I also added cream cheese to the frosting.  I also made these the night before and let the rise in the fridge overnight.  I took them for about 30 mins to warm up and then baked them.  They were divine!

Excellent. The only changes I made were to add chopped almonds and raisins to the filling. Easily the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. My Kitchen Aid mixer did not have any trouble, but if you have the smaller bowl watch that it doesn't overflow the flour. We usually do have mashed potatoes so this recipe uses up leftovers as well. Do not flip the pan as one rater suggested. It will smash the rolls. The icing is sufficient for the 20 rolls I ended up with.

WOW!! Best cinnamon rolls ive ever had! I halved the recipe to make 12 (24 seemed a bit much). For the filling i used brown sugar instead of white. And for the icing i made the full amount for 24 rolls, glad i did, each roll got a generous spread of icing.

Love it! Soft and delicious! This recipe is easy to follow and always a hit! 

I found I use brown sugar instead of white sugar in the filling and more cinnamon in the middle... but the dough is perfect!

I halved the recipe and it made 12 rolls.  Rolled the dough pretty thin because I like lots of cinnamon swirls. Put 6 in a pie plate.  Honestly they couldn't have turned ou any better.  So good!!

Truly the most perfect cinnamon roll, ever. The dough is so light and fluffy, and they impress guests without too much work to prepare. I use a cream cheese icing: equal parts butter and cream cheese, splash of milk, and a cup or two of powdered sugar to taste. I also double the cinnamon sugar filling as these have a pretty light flavor otherwise. Other variations--adding a sprinkle of ground walnuts or pecans gives it even better texture. Yum! A pan of these never lasts long.

Being a mid-western girl I have had some pretty wonderful cinnamon rolls!  (Thanks Mom!) I've eaten them at The Machine Shed and Amish Restaurants and THESE rolls were even better than those!  I used a roasting pan and made 12 giant rolls. (You should have seen the eyes!) Also, I mixed 1c. white sugar with 1/2c. brown sugar and used 2 tsp cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and a pinch (scant) of ground cloves.  That's a grandma's apple pie filling trick too!  I also used the potato water and a tsp. of sugar for my yeast mixture.  And I made cream cheese icing.  AWESOME!!

When I read the recipe, the mashed potatoes hooked me into trying it.  I followed the dough recipe (subbing more hot H2O and butter for potato H2O) and got at least 50% more after kneading and rolling (not a bad thing, just more product).  Instead of a cinnamon filling, I stewed down minced prunes (dried plums for the PR inclined) in juice and brown sugar.  I began with a qtr cup apple cider, ran out, went to OJ, ran out and then to Cran-grape.   I gently stewed the mix down into a paste.  Choice of juice did not seem to matter though I prefer the cider.  Made one dish of huge beautiful rolls and another 9x13 of a layered pastry.  Both are great and both have good presentation presence.   The rolls rival any I've had anywhere.  I intend to experiment with other fruits in the future.

These were my first go at making homemade cinnamon rolls. They were delicious once they were finally done. 

I forgot to reserve the potato water. I used more sugar and cinnamon in the filling than called for. And next time, I would make more icing. I do recommend using a stoneware cookie sheet or something that in non-stick, so they don't burn.

My husband loved these and took them to work this morning. Make these on a day off though when you have time to spare.

Oh my goodness! I can bake, but don't always have the best luck with breads. These came out perfectly! The whole family loved them. The bread is so moist and fluffy. I did add some orange zest to the dough batter, as that's a personal preference for recipes like this. Also, for the filling, I multiplied it by 1.5 and melted the butter and stirred in 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1 tb cinnamon. For the icing, I had leftover cream cheese icing from Christmas, though not enough. So I made this icing, again adding zest and a squeeze of orange and I used heavy cream as I had a little of that left in the fridge to use up. I combined the two icings and it was the best icing I've ever had. To note: I didn't have any trouble with this in my kitchenaid. I did end up with 9 cups flour in it, leaving it just a smidge sticky to rise, as I knew I'd be working in more flour in the next step. Do not overwork the dough. This one's a keeper. I'll be making it every Christmas.

These are wonderful.  I've been making cinnamon rolls for years and I do think these are the best yet.  I needed to add a bit more flour then called for but that was all.  I wasn't sure how many potatoes to use....I did 3 small-med and had leftover mashed potatoes.  I'll do 2 next time.  I used the frosting from the clone of a cinnnabon, which I think is the best.  Next time I'll add more filling....I think that was the only flaw to this recipe..  Thanks...I'll make them often.

So I'm not an expert in the kitchen by any means but this recipe gave me a bit of a confidence boost! I was intrigued by the use of potatoes. The rolls came out delicious!  Just as others have said, I tweaked the filling and used half brown sugar, half white, more cinnamon.  I was concerned about the sticky consistency of the dough but after adding up to an additional cup of flour and a bit more sugar the rolls came out light, fluffy and delicious! They are a labor of love but worth it.

This recipe is amazing!! I had never made cinnamon buns before and made them for my husband's birthday and everyone said they are the most amazing cinnamons buns they've ever had. For the filling I use the ratio of what is written of sugar to cinnamon and butter but I use 2 times the amount of sugar mixture recommended and it turns out amazing!

I love these rolls. I halved the recipe and don't know whether there was something in the air, but I ended up adding close to 6 cups of flour for half a recipe, otherwise it was too sticky to handle. Most of what I've read about bread says the amount of flour used can change from day to day depending on the weather and other factors. I even let it rest between kneadings and it was still too sticky, but was easier to handle after it went through the first rise. Also, for the second rise, I poured boiling water into a pan in the oven and placed the rolls in the oven for about 20 minutes (oven turned off). Not sure what this does, but I saw Alton Brown do this. I also used a cream cheese icing instead. Since I just made them, I hope they don't become rock hard by tomorrow considering all the flour I added. Overall, I think these were as good or better than Cinnabon's.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect the first time.  I have never had any luck with cinnamon rolls until now.  Soft, melt-in-your-mouth dough and great taste!  Even my husband commented on how good they were.  This will be a favorite in the recipe box!

This recipe is  sublime! It's very light and  billowy. Everyone is spot on, it really melts in your mouth. With just one bite, I knew I had to rate it, it's that good!! I did take some reviewers suggestion and I used the filling and icing from clone of Cinnabon recipe. What a fantastic recipe, I'll make it again and again, especially with the holidays around the corner. Try it out, it really is a winner!!

Giving this a 4 for the wonderful light texture.  The salt to flour ratio was low compared to other recipes I've used which probably accounts for the somewhat bland dough flavor.  Will definitely add a little more salt the next time.  For our tastes, I increased all of the filling ingredients.  Great way to use up some potatoes!

I loved how fluffy and light these cinnamon rolls were.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it definitely needed more cinnamon.  I think I would like it with some brown sugar, too.  If I make these again I will definitely follow the reviewers suggestions.  I just hate that people give a recipe five stars and basically change the entire recipe.

These are hands down the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made AND that I have ever tasted! I followed the dough recipe exactly as is but I did substitute Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing (5 stars) for the icing listed only because I like a little heavier icing on my cinnamon rolls. The recipe turned out perfect.

I have made this recipe several times! The family really enjoyed it and requested it today. I do add lots of brown sugar and cinnamon to the center though. I also add brown sugar to the top, just before baking. This makes them more like a sticky bun, but I have had rave reviews from my husbands work, from a lady that claims to be a cinnamon roll snob! She even sent me a thank you card! Great recipe! Will be using for many more years to come!

I love using this for all my holiday cooking. It is always requested... even by the neighbors. I altered the recipe by substituting Quail eggs (4-5 Quail eggs per Chicken egg) mostly because I raise Quail, and it comes out twice as fluffy and rich. I also add 1/2 tsp rum flavoring to the icing, then top with Black Walnuts  10 thumbs up. I have also used this recipe for donuts and they come out perfect.

This was an excellent recipe!  I did everything just as it is stated on the recipe and it was great!  My mom requested seconds and she is a tough critic.  I will definitely add this recipe to my recipe box!

I was leary about putting potatoes in cinnamon rolls, but they were great!  I halved the recipe and it turned out fine.  I gave it 4 stars because it takes such a long time to prepare.

First time using yeast.  Followed recipe as stated. Rolls turned out very good, except for mine, the bottoms burned.  I have a new oven and still testing it for times.  I had the rolls in for 21 minutes, so next time I will keep checking the bottoms earlier.  I will add more sugar and cinnamon, also.  Other than that, I have to say for my first time making cinnamon rolls, they turned out way better than I thought they would.

I made these on Christmas eve for us to eat on Christmas day. They came out of the oven around 4 pm by 8 pm there were 3 left. I had to hide those 3 for myself which I ate on Christmas Day with a cup of coffee. These have to be the best cinnamon rolls ever. I am about to make another batch for New Years. These rolls will become a part of my staple Holiday baking from this point forward.

These were SO SOFT and delicious. I added a splash of nutmeg to the mixture and used brown sugar instead of white. I also added plenty of raisins. I decided to go with a tried-and-true frosting recipe but I was SO HAPPY with the bun!! They were a huge hit Christmas morning with kids and adults alike!

I would gladly give this recipe 5 stars, but the filling was very weak.  The bread was WONDERFUL, and the topping was up to par.

My next time around, I will be using brown sugar instead of regular sugar, and double the cinnamon.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I've made these a few times now, and here are a few things I've tweaked:
1. The dough is very soft, and depending on humidity, you may end up having to knead in a fair amount more than called for in the recipe to keep it from being sticky.
2. I nearly doubled the amount of the filling, and I used brown sugar. 
3. I also doubled the icing.
4. DEFINITELY wait the 15 minutes before putting the icing on! Otherwise, they deflate (but are still yummy!)
These come out super sticky, gooey, and crazy delicious! They are 1/2 gone before they're done cooling!!

These are the best stinking cinnamon buns I've ever had in my whole life!! So light and fluffy and delicious. The only thing I changed was to use cream cheese frosting instead of just regular frosting. I can see why they won first prize though!

Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!   Who would have thought mashed potatoes could make such a difference!  The amount is almost too large for a bread maker on 'dough' setting.  Must take it out before it finishes rising.  I made 12 rolls, BUT, each were the size of my head!  6 put in a 9x13 pan to control size (billowed over) and 6 put on cookie sheet.  Drizzled with cream cheese frosting.  Light and airy.  PERFECT cinnamon roll recipe!

First time making my own cinnamon rolls and I am IMPRESSED! However, this made a LOT of rolls, 24, and they were so large they had to be eaten half at a time. In the future, I would make the entire recipe, but freeze half of them, and make the rolls smaller. The frosting/icing was delicious, but I would probably look for another one next time I make this... I'd try cream cheese. Also, no one could believe these had mashed potatos in them :) but I think it made a difference. I definitely recommend trying this recipe -- store bought/in a can rolls simply do not compare!!!

This were so delicious time consuming but so worth it, my kids fought over them, I really appreciate the review saying if you have a kitchen Aide mixer (i do) divide the dough in half then use hook to kneed the dough that was very good information thank you. I used sugar,brown sugar and cinnamon also melted butter and spreaded  it  on the dough then added the sugar mixture, also put cream cheese icing on rolls as soon as they came out of the oven.

Five stars just doesn't cut it! These are the absolute BEST cinnamon buns ever... so tender and delicious! Since I love cream cheese, I used a basic cream cheese frosting instead of the one provided with the recipe. They were amazing!

Added raisins and chopped pecans to the filling! Wonderful recipe, have made it twice in 2 weeks and doubled the recipe both times. Nothing left!!

Notes: We like extra filling, so consider halving or doubling it again. We also like the glaze - one batch wasn't enough! :)

o.m.g. these were AMAZING. i was totally thrown off by using mashed potatoes, but they turned out delicious! i had to use much more than 8.5 cups of flour - probably closer to 10.5! and they turned out delcious. also had closer to 35 (unevenly sized) rolls than 24 - which was great. :) thanks for the recipe - definitely a winner!!

They are great! Although I would double the filling next time and make them smaller as they really rose to become quite large and I found it difficult to finish one.

My whole family loved these! I also substituted cream cheese rather than butter and brown sugar instead of white sugar on the filling.

These are the BEST and EASIEST cinnamon rolls I have ever made. I've made them twice now and the first time I made the recipe exactly as written.  The second time I added 3 tblsps of cinnamon because I didn't think they had enough the first time.  ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!!

I totally agree with the other reviewers.   This was the best cinnamon roll I've ever had.  I cut the recipe in half because 24 rolls is too many for 2 of us and my stand mixer isn't big enough for 8 cups of flour.  It is a really soft dough, as others said, and that worried me a bit but it still turned out fantastic.

While I use another recipe for an overnight raising cinnamon roll, this one is BY FAR my favorite ever. If you’re making for morning you’ll want to rise early so these will rise long and fluff up prettily- but trust me it will be worth it.

I made exactly as directed and doubled the recipe.  It was a hit, the little I had left over was grilled with butter the next day and was another special treat.

We could not find our print recipe file for our usual cinnamon roll recipe for Christmas morning, so we tried this one. It was really good- it was a larger recipe than our usual one and our mixer struggled greatly, so we may just kneed by hand next time. We made “instant potatoes” with extra water for potatoes and potato water (this may have contributed to our need for adding more flour than called for) and we used brown sugar and twice the cinnamon as per our other favorite recipe and we made part of it sticky buns with nuts and  frosted the rest while warm - YUM! They were a hit . We also had enough dough to freeze a bit after the first rise/punch down to use another time. Saving to my recipe file here so we can’t misplace it!

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls from scratch and these were SO GOOD!!! I cut the recipe in half and wish I would've just done the whole thing. I did use a whole batch of icing for just half the recipe, so if I did the whole batch I would make extra icing. Otherwise, followed it exactly and it was pretty easy and so good!

Great recipe.  Only thing I did differently is use my bread machine on dough setting.  I always do that.  I halved recipe to fit plus I didn’t need that many rolls!   I am trying mother batch to take to my class later today.   Going to make them smaller and letting rise on large jelly roll pan.  I used Bakers Cinnamon filling mix from Kung Arthur Flour.  Best stuff ever for inside rolls like these.  Nice recipe with my little tweak.

No changes, and I will most likely never even bother trying another cinnamon roll recipe again! I took these to the family Thanksgiving dinner last week, and everyone raved about how tender and delicious these rolls were! I  used 9" round tinfoil cake pans so each family  could take theirs home with them, and it was a huge success!! I'm making them again today for a "Going away party" for a friend of mine who's moving out of state.

The bread was slightly heavier than we prefer so I will modify with less flour for a fluffier roll next time.  However, the rolls had a nice flavor and turned out beautifully.  The only other modification I made was I drizzled with a cream cheese frosting instead of the traditional icing listed in the receipt.

I've made this recipe several times, and just finished another batch.  Yes, I made the dough as written.  Like others, I opted for brown sugar in the filling and made extra.  I used the mixer to combine the softened butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.
The first 1/2 of dough I rolled out and spread the filling on.  Yes it was difficult to spread and took some time.  For the second 1/2 of the dough I decided to soften the mixture a bit more.  I put it in a small bowl in the microwave on 50% power for 10 seconds.  NOT to melt it, but to soften and keep the sugar granulated.  Doing this made spreading much faster and easier.  Also when rolling the down I found it much smoother to roll the second time.
My second tip is to roll the log onto floured wax paper.  Roll up and slide on cookie sheet.  I refrigerated the dough for 15-20 minutes and the rolls were so much easier to cut!
Love the recipe and recommend it often.

Best cinnamon rolls ever!! Followed the recipes to a T with the only tweak being making an orange icing for half of them (made a small batch regular icing as recipe stated- best roll icing ever btw and made a small batch orange icing by subbing milk in the original recipe with fresh squeezed orange juice and zest as well as omitting vanilla). The recipe is so fun and easy. Using string to cut the rolls (or unflavored dental tape) works wonders. I recommend this to all level of bakers and everyone looking for that perfectly flaky and moist roll.

I made them with Gluten free flour and used egg re placer and 1/2 cup applesauce for each egg, and water for milk. Was needing to make a vegan gluten free recipe. They turned out delicious. I will be using them this summer at Camp for all our special meals.

The ABSOLUTE BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever made!!!!  The only small change I made was putting the dry yeast into a glass measuring cup with the warm water and ~ ADD 2 Tablespoons of SUGAR.  Stir well, let set for 10 minutes.  It will foam up and nearly double in volume.  Continue as recipe states.

These cinnamon rolls are amazing! I bake for a living and am also a licensed Medical Marijuana patient/caregiver. The only substitutions I made were to use green butter instead of regular butter, brown sugar in place of the white in the filling, and if you can find "roasted" cinnamon, I suggest using at least a Tbs.  I've made them in 2 pans like suggested, 2 side by side in a loaf pan and 24 individuals in pot pie tins. It's a very flexible recipe and always turns out fantastic!

I made these on Christmas Eve to bake on Christmas morning. They rose up before baking so beautifully, better than any bread product I’ve baked before. Unfortunately, I put them in the fridge after shaping them into rolls, thinking they would stay nice and fluffy until morning. But a few hours later they had deflated a lot. They still tasted great after baking! Next time I guess I will try refrigerating the dough before the first rise. I’ll have to get up earlier to let it rise and make the rolls, but if they stay as fluffy as the first batch (before I mistakenly refrigerated them), it’ll be worth it!

These are amazing and super simple, they just take time. I doubled the recipe thinking I would need to and ended up with enough dough that I made dinner rolls and two loaves of bread that made some incredible french toast the next morning!!

Dough only is fabulous!! Made this with my kitchenaid stand mixer and used the kneading attachment and it worked great. I changed the filling to 1 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 cup softened butter, 3 T cinnamon- blend together then spread over the dough evenly. I used Chef Johns cream cheese frosting and these are always gone immediately. **hint- do NOT try to double the recipe; I learned the hard way and cleaned up far too much flour from my floors lol.

I gave this 5 stars because mine came out good but I did have trouble with the dough.  Not the receipes fault it was mine.  I do not have a good enough mixer so I had to do it by hand and the dough was very sticky so it did make a miss.  I put that on me and not the receipe.  Those who tried them loved them so that is why it gets 5 stars.  Thank you for the receipe!!!!

Just made these today. I didn't measure the cin/sug mix though. I just went with what looked good to me. I also substituted the milk in the icing mix with non dairy creamer. It makes it better, at least to me it did. I'm a happy guy. LoL

These are INCREDIBLE! I use a different filling though. 1 cup brown sugar, 2 1/2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon, &  3/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I also just spread on the butter till everything is covered nicely.  I typically use more then the recipe calls.  I love that this makes 2 dozen so my family and I can enjoy these delicious pieces of heaven throughout the week.

These were very good- much better bread texture than the last cinnamon roll recipe I tried. The dough was VERY wet- I had to add at least another cup of flour to make it workable- but other than that came out well. Next time I will cut the rolls thinner- they rose too much for my pans although I made as directed. Will also add more cinnamon sugar before rolling up (personal preference). But filling and icing are easy to play with: I will definitely use this sweet dough recipe again.

These are amazing! I woke up at 6am and didn’t get done until 9:30 but still worth it! I realized I forgot my potatoes at the store so I used sweet potatoes instead and I ended up with 32 rolls.  (Oh my gosh) I hade to make extra icing. I gave my mom a batch as she was leaving the house - It’s 12 pm - she’s just texted me a ladies email adress to share the recipe because they were the best cinnamon rolls she’s ever had. I think they need more stars.

This is the best cinn. roll I have ever made. It makes a large batch and keeps well, (only a day or two) my family couldn't leave them alone. The only thing I did the second time I made them was add double the cinn.

The dough tastes good but the filling leaves a lot to be desired. Very sugary not enough cinnamon. Will use the dough with different filling.

I’ve been baking for over 50 years and these are the very best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever made! I cut the recipe in half since they were just for my husband and myself. I used a lot more cinnamon than called for but otherwise followed the recipe. I’ve quit searching! This is the recipe I’ll always use now!

It was a hit! Very easy to make but time consuming, as it takes 3-3 1/2 hours from start to eating. It was very worth it though!  The recipe yielded about 2 dozen rolls. The bread was fluffy and soft and delicious! Will definitely make again and again.

4 stars for the dough, 2 stars for everything else.  These taste more like dinner rolls than cinnamon rolls!  I doubled the cinnamon and still could hardly see or taste it.  The icing is fairly standard.  By cooking this size of a batch in 9x13 baking dishes you will get rolls that are a full 2-1/2 inches tall.  Far too large to fit into a normal human mouth.  If you make this recipe in a 9x13 dish be prepared to eat these with a fork.  The dough is actually pretty good.  There's not near enough of the cinnamon filling though.  I would double the butter and sugar in the filling, and use 4-6 times as much cinnamon.  Instead of 1" slices I'd go closer to 3/4" and bake the rolls on a cookie sheet.  The thinner rolls will cook faster so the top doesn't dry out as much, and you'll be able to fit them in your mouth!

I’ve tried multiple recipes and this one is best by far. Softest cinnamon rolls! I halved the recipe and mixed all ingredients besides flour and yeast and dumped it into my bread machine. Placed flour and yeast on top. Worked perfectly! And it still made 23 decent sized rolls!

Good every time I made it, but this last time I substituted half of the sugar in the filling for an equal amount of brown sugar; it was even BETTER!!! Next time I'll try using ALL brown sugar in the filling.

We've made these cinnamon rolls numerous times. We love them! And we get rave reviews each time. Once we added a touch of orange juice to the frosting just to mix it up a bit but they are great as is. Our son enjoyed making them with me last time and he's 3- it takes time but it's not a difficult recipe to follow.

Excellent, very, very light. I cut the icing recipe down to 1/3 of the amount, and that was great.

I used half brown sugar for the filling as someone suggested, and shared them at church.  Several people said they were the best cinnamon rolls they had ever had.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a beautifully soft dough. Rolling out was a breeze because it didn't shrink up. I made the dough in my stand mixer, switching from paddle to hook. I did have to whisk by hand after the addition of egg, yeast, and flour, just to get lumps out, but after that, it was hands free. I've never had a dough proof so well... twice! These baked up and took all the empty space in the pan. My family and I were pleased with the texture of these rolls as they were not tough at all. The only change I made was in the filling. I did half granulated and half brown sugar with a full 2tbsp of Saigon cinnamon. These rolls could probably stand to have even a bit more swirl, so I may double up on those next time. I also liked that this recipe made a full 2doz of rolls. Perfect for gifting and sending home with guests. This recipe is a keeper, for sure!

These rolls were amazing and I will definitely be making them again.  I cut the recipe in half and that perfectly made 12 rolls.  I made a change to the frosting and added 1/4 cup of cream cheese and reduced butter by the same but that was the only change to this fabulous recipe.

I am making this recipe for the third time in less than two weeks!  These are the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made.  I made them for a bake sale last weekend and people were literally buying them by the bagful!  Now I am making them for a dessert auction.  I was surprised to see them made with potatoes but I think that may be what makes them so light and fluffy.  I usually have issues with baked recipes rising, but this dough rose so far out of the bowl, we thought it was hilarious.  Make sure you use a HUGE bowl!  The rolls were giant!  I did add a little extra cinnamon but other than that I didn't change a thing.  I have added this recipe to my collection to be passed on through the generations!

I've made a number of cinnamon roll recipes and this one by far is the best. My girlfriend is vegan and I made it using egg replacer and cashew milk and turned out wonderful.  I'd give this recipe more stars if I could.

This review is for the dough only. I halved the recipe and they turned out perfect! Soft and fluffy and everything a cinnamon roll should be. I was not impressed by the filling so I used 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and 2 tbsp cinnamon instead. To top them off I used The Best Cinnamon Roll Icing recipe on this site and they were perfect!

I don't think this recipe could have come out any better! I chose this because of the pictures I saw, these roles looked so flaky and moist. Well it turns out, they tasted even better than they looked. I only had to add A little more flour to pull it out of the bowl. Outstanding!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used 2 c. of potato water and did the filling with brown sugar and 2T. Cinnamon.  Probably the best cinnamon rolls I have made in the 45 years we have been married!

This is a wonderful recipe. The rolls were tender, moist, and light. The only change I made was at the suggestion of others, to use brown sugar in the filling instead of regular white.  This one is definitely finding a home in my recipe box.

This recipe was a hit!  I made exactly as written and will be my go to cinnamon roll recipe from now on.  It was very easy.  I made for overnight guests for the day after Thanksgiving on the weekend before.  I froze two dozen.   Before I served I thawed and warmed in oven and then frosted them.  It worked out great.

Made for the second time. I think I will increase the filling butter to 3/4 cup, double the sugar and double the cinnamon. First time I made as is. Second time I did add pecans and raisins.

The dough is great.  However, the changes I made really turned this into a crowd pleaser.   Use 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts to really wow your family.

Excellent!  I have been afraid to try making cinnamon rolls because I have  a terrible history of making yeast breads.  This was fun and easy.  I used leftover instant potatoes.   Also used coconut oil instead of butter for the glaze and it was very tasty!

Not bad for my first experiment with cinnamon rolls. I tried another person's suggestion and used brown sugar. I used both brown sugar and cinnamon. They came out okay. I should have better luck next time. Other than that, they were delicious when hot out of the oven!

I've made these rolls at least a dozen times - they are my go-to rolls for Christmas and Easter mornings and for sharing at work. Everyone raves about them!  I typically freeze one pan of rolls right after I shape them.  When I'm ready to make them, I take them out of the freezer the night before and let them sit, covered, at room temp.  In the morning, they are ready to bake.  This is the ONLY cinnamon roll recipe I use now.

i only used the dough recipe and used my filling and icing the dough is so easy and you can do this the night before  after you roll it cut and place in your pans cover and let rise over night and take out at least 30 minutes before you  bake and let warm up on your stove top while your oven preheats it helps warm the pan and then bake for the 30 minutes it is Delicious my filling is 2 cups sugar 2 cups not packed brown sugar and 3 teaspoons cinnamon and both butter and margarine to spread on dough frosting is 8 on cream cheese softened 1 stick butter softened 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup milk mix and spread on warm cooked rolls plus to make it even better add apples to the filling or blueberry

I will definetaly make them again. I guess i made a mistake with the potatos. I meshed them without cooking. Is this the right way? Furthermore the yeast didn't get enough time to rest, therefore the rolls are not as fluffy as expected. But the taste is awesome.

The best cinnamon rolls I've ever had!  The only thing I could see making these cinnamon rolls any better is a cream cheese frosting, because I am a sucker for cream cheese frostings...  I only made a couple of slight changes...   I used all potato water, instead of potato water and plain hot water (potato water was still very hot).  I also added a little bit of extra vanilla to the icing (maybe a 1/4 tsp).  I had the same issue as others in that the dough crept over the hook of my kitchen aid stand mixer, so I finished kneading by hand.  Also, the dough was stickier than I anticipated (first time baking anything outside of cookies), but when working on a floured surface, it was easily manageable.  All in all, a smash hit with family and friends.  Thanks for sharing an awesome recipe!

These are the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made.  I added chopped pecans and raisins for added flavor and texture.  I took them to work for a breakfast and everyone raved about them.  No need to search for another recipe...this is it!

The best cinnamon rolls ever! They turn out so light and fluffy, not heavy and dense like so many homemade ones can be. Will make this my go to cinnamon roll recipe from now on! I am going to try using the dough from this recipe to make caramel rolls next!

What caught my attention was the mashed potatoes ingredient...my mom uses same in her donut recipe and it's superb. I've made these buns 3 or four times, some attempts have turned out better than others, but it's my go-to for sure! I use a whipped recipe that I spread in the bottom of my pan instead of the glaze, and everyone loves it.  Thanks for sharing your cinnamon buns!

Great texture. Very light but my only complaint is that they go stale very fast.  If you don't eat them within a couple of hours, they start to go hard and forget about eating them the next day.  I wonder if using milk instead of water would prevent this?

This cinnamon roll is really good! I didn't save any potato water, so I just used regular water in addition to the water the recipe calls for. Also, I needed to add a lot more flour because the dough was way too sticky to be kneaded. I probably ended up with 10-11 cups of flour. 

They are so good, but there are SO MANY. Unless you are feeding a small group, be sure to halve the recipe. I added chopped pecans to half, and I thought that worked well. Also, I think I will double the cinnamon-sugar filling next time. The roll was slightly too bread-y, and I would have enjoyed more bites of cinnamon in mine.

I've wanted to try making cinnamon rolls for a long time. My mom makes them every year around Christmas, and they are so awesome. I looked specifically for a recipe that included mashed potatoes because that's something I remember from my mom's recipe. These rolls were really light and flaky, and the icing tastes really good, too! Just like my mom's! I used unsweetened almond milk (we don't buy regular milk) instead of regular milk in the icing, and it still turned out great. I will definitely add more cinnamon next time, though! Awesome recipe even for a beginner!

Love this recipe. The dough is very sticky and hard to work with until you get your own system down. I did add vanilla to the dough and extra cinnamon to the filling. Instead of using the icing recipe I made Carmel (sugar, butter, vanilla, corn syrup etc.) and put it in the bottom of my pan before placing the cinnamon rolls in it to raise and bake. They were amazing and everyone loved them. Only other thing is that the recipe makes way more dough then I needed, next time I will have to cut the recipe in half.

Delicious! I do keep coming back to this recipe each Christmas, but I think next time I'll use brown sugar rather than white sugar in the filling, and I'll double all filling ingredients as the original filling measurements resulted in a scarce amount once finished.

Great recipe. The dough is fantastic. I did find the filling was quite minimal when I started assembling. I would recommend doubling if not tripling the recipe suggestion here. 

I think this dough could be very versatile in the right hands! All in all a good, but not out of this world recipe. I will try the "clone of cinnabon" next go round.

These rolls are awesome! The dough was soft and moist. I do not like my cinnamon rolls to be dry and these were fantastic. I used brown sugar in the filling instead of white sugar and I added a little bit more cinnamon. I also forgot to save the potato water and I used warm milk instead.  They still came out great. Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome!  My first attempt at cinnamon rolls was a smashing success!  I used two reviewers tips to just use two cups of the potato water and replaced the white sugar in the filling with brown.  DELICIOUS!!!

I loved this recipe. They came out so soft and moist. I doubled the cinnamon and will probably add more next time. The dough was very sticky, but I read the other reviews, so I was prepared. These are worth taking to any get together or holiday!

I had to come back just to rate these. I live with 3 other people, 4 including myself and two of us aren't big on sweets but all 24 buns went in two days. So amazing, i'm making more tomorrow but im thinking of cutting the recipe in half and making one half with cocoa and chocolate chips.

This is a awesome recipe! I added more cinnamon and used sweet potato instead, also topped with cream cheese icing.
My wife told me this morning that she had a dream about them last night.
Guess I have to make again!!
