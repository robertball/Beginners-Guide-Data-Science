Very yummy pie, but the way to make it totally irresistible is to make a Nutter Butter crust (24 crushed Nutter Butter cookies & 5 Tbsp. of butter mixed together & pressed into bottom & sides of a pie plate).  I omit the milk, only use 8 oz. Cool Whip & use 3/4 cup sugar & 1 Tbsp. vanilla, which make only one, rich & creamy pie that holds together better.  This recipe is a great one, but if you know what Nutter Butter cookies are, you'll want to try the crust w/ this recipe!!  I have also added a layer of dessert fudge to the bottom of the pie and it went over very well.

As a professional Chef married to a diabetic Husband, I look for recipes that are easily converted to no-sugar or low-sugar without sacrificing taste or presentation.  

This recipe is FABULOUS made in a low sugar version and very very simple to do.  Substitute Splenda sweetener for the granulated sugar, substitute a low sugar graham cracker crust or make your own no sugar chocolate cookie crust like I did using store bought chocolate cookies crumbs with melted butter and pressed into a pie plate. Substiture low sugar peanut butter.  The whipped topping from the store is already low sugar and then top with pieces of sugar free Reeses Peanut Butter cups and drizzled with sugar-free chocolate sauce.

My family and friends never knew when I served it up that it was low sugar....until I told them!

Great recipe. Only it doesn't take a whole 16 oz tub of whipped topping. More like 3/4 that amount.

This pie is fantastic! I halved the recipe to make only one 9-inch pie, but kept some ingredients the same. I added one 8 oz. cream cheese, one cup of powdered sugar, one cup of peanut butter and one container of cool whip (the smaller one). I also added chopped Reese's Peanut Butter cups, both in the pie and sprinkled on top. It was very sweet and rich, I could only have a small piece, but enjoyed it very much! :) Thanks Megan.

I brought this to a post-New Year's party where we were all on diets, so I subbed in light Cool Whip, light cream cheese and skim milk.  The taste was awesome and we couldn't tell it was low fat!

Easy Dreamy Pie.  Reminds me of a frozen Peanut Butter Cup.  I used non fat milk, fat free cool whip, and low fat cream cheese. This pie is plush!

This pie is the best.  I have a family of peanut butter addicts and this is a necessity for us.  I however put in the fridge to set up rather than the freezer.  I don't change anything else.  If you are a peanut butter fan, this is the recipe for you.  It is also good if you want to bake a regular pie crust.

If you want a "refrigerator" pie instead of a "frozen" pie simply eliminate the 1 c. milk.  

An Oreo crust is the best - and topped with crushed Oreos it becomes Dirt Pie!

FABULOUS! If you love peanut butter like me you'll LOVEEEEEEEEE this, i couldn't wait for it to freeze, I sneaked some of the soft stuff and it's soooooooo good!  I made it with lite cool whip, reduced fat peanut butter (only 2/3 of the amount called for as well to cut down on the fat), skim milk and fat free cream cheese! PHENOMENAL! Warning: only if you love peanut butter though!

I don't like cool whip and wasn't sure how homemade whipped cream would work in this recipe but it was perfect. I whipped two cups heavy cream with 3/4 cup confectioners sugar and a teas. vanilla extract.(the key to perfect whipped cream is to put your bowl and beaters in the freezer before using so they are very cold)I Didn't add any additional sugar to the recipe and it was plenty sweet. I reserved some of the whipped cream for a garnish. I didnt measure the cream just mixed it in until I was happy with the consistency. So many possible variations. I used an oreo crust layered with chocolate sauce. Added crushed PB cups into the mix and sprinkled some on top before freezing. Delicious!

Great recipe - myself and my family love it!!  (I think it's much better than the Kraft Peanut Butter Cup Pie recipe!)  Overall, it looks great, tastes wonderful, and is easy to make!  I just have two recommendations:  1)  If you really like peanut butter or Reeses, use more (1.5 to 2 cups) peanut butter than the recipe calls for. 2)  A chocolate crust on this pie makes it soooo much better!!  Microwave 1 Hershey bar and 1.5 cups of Cool Whip, then pour it over the top of the (frozen) pie.  If you want to make it look a little fancy, microwave 1/4 a cup of peanut butter and drizzle over the melted chocolate.  Also, one tip - the cream cheese is doesn't mix in very quickly (it gets kind of lumpy).  Beating the mixture with an electric mixer should do the trick.  Just make sure the mix looks smooth/completely mixed together - it's worth the extra time!!

I have been making a recipe very similar to this for years. One thing different that adds immensely to it is to pour Reese's Shell over the crust before adding the filling. You pour just enough to moderately coat the bottom and sides. Use a spoon to push it up the sides until all is completely covered. Then you put the coated crust into the freezer for about 10 minutes or until it's hard.  This will make your pie taste just like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup.

Instead of making two pies, I bought the "2 Extra Servings" size graham crust and the filling fit perfectly!  My husband and teenage son both loved this.  It is a little hard to cut when frozen solid, though.

About as easy as an elegant, "wow" dessert can get! Cut the recipe in half to make only one pie. I made an Oreo crust for this one, using 1-1/2 cups Oreo crumbs and 2 Tb melted butter. Used low fat whipped topping and 1 cup Splenda (as no matter what it says on the package, I find that it takes more Splenda to equal the required amount of sugar.) Still, it was not overly sweet. Diced up Reese's Peanut Butter cups and sprinkled on the crust before adding filling, then garnished the top with PB Cup quarters, standing up, which dressed up the presentation of this deceptively easy dessert, making it look "gourmet." The slightly salty counterpoint of the PB Cups was the perfect foil for the sweet filling. I was going to make hot fudge to serve with it, but because of the excellent flavor and texture, this pie can easily stand on its own, without any embellishment. It set up very firmly in about 2-1/2 hours. Easier cutting if you let it stand for 10 minutes out of the freezer. Be sure to set an alarm so you don't overthaw it. A++

AWESOME! Make sure that you beat the ingredients for about 3-4 minutes which makes it really fluffy and then stir in the whipped cream. I made this into 1 large deep dish pie and it was perfect and nice and high. I topped it with 1/2 cup of peanuts and then drizzled chocolate over the top and froze it. Take out of the freezer at least 1/2 hour before serving. When I served it, I drizzled chocolate on the plate and placed the pie on top of it. It was beautiful to look at and sinful eating it. Great find and easy.

Delicious!  I am very health conscious so always try to look for ways to reduce calories and fat.  I used fat free cream cheese, skim milk, fat free whipped topping, reduced fat peanut butter and 1/2 Splenda 1/2 sugar.  Also used an Oreo crust and crushed low carb peanut butter cups on top with sugar free chocolate syrup.  Next time I will cut down on the sugar and maybe use all Splenda.  No one thought it was low fat at all!!  Everyone loved it and agreed it tasted great just the way I made it.  I feel good knowing I made something that tastes amazing plus I saved lots of calories.  I will DEFINITELY be making this one again.  Only 6 Weight Watchers points for 1/8 of the pie if made this way...believe me it's worth it!

Very good-made it as one desert for Christmas and tweaked the recipe a bit. Added mini reeses pieces candies in it and Oreo cookie crumbs on top. Finished it off after slicing with some chocolate syrup! A sure fire hit at parties and very simple. Make sure it stays frozen while transporting otherwise it is hard to cut and loose.

My husband and I love this recipe. I couldn't believe how easy it was to make and how great it turned out. I took the suggestions of the oreo pie crust, the 1/4 c. extra of peanut butter, the choc. sauce swirled on top, and garnishing w/peanut butter cups. This recipe has found a permanent home in our recipe box.

I made this pie using a spring form pan with parchment paper on the bottom, instead of the standard pie pan. I followed the instruction as written except, I used crushed oreo's with 3tbs of melted butter for the pie crust, and some Nutella swirled into the peanut butter mix at the end. Outstanding flavor!!

This was by far one of the best desserts I've made! (And I make lots) The taste was so creamy and yummy! I had requests from the people I brought it over to - that I would make it again!  Instead of using a store bought pie crust, I made mine own in a 9x12 pan with about 34 oreo cookies crumbled and about 3/4 cup blended together and pressed into bottom of pan, freezer for 5 mins, then mixture poured in and then back in freezer! So easy and worth the 5 stars!!!

This pie is fabulous!! Everyone that ate it just thought it was to die for.  My husband thought it was from a bakery!  It is very light and fluffy, not heavy at all.  When preparing it, I did cut down on the milk to about 2/3 of a cup and I rounded the cup of peanut butter instead of flattening it off, just to give it a little more peanut butter flavor.  I took other people's advice and smeared Smucker's ice cream fudge topping across the crust before filling it with filling.  Then, I crumbled up Reeses peanut butter cups and srpinkled them on top!! DELICIOUS.  Thanks for the great recipe.

i have been making a variation of this pie for years and always got rave reviews.I never heard of a version using milk and I understand why...it makes the pie very loose and runny as soon as it thaws.1 1/2 cups of sugar was WAY too much,it makes the pie almost tongue-numbingly sweet and the peanut butter flavor was minimal at best:/ The Cool-Whip adds some volume,but it also ups the sweetness,which this recipe does not need! Cut the sugar by half,add at least 1/2 cup more PB,omit the milk,mix it all up and pour it into an Oreo cookie crust,then freeze for 2 hours.Much better result.The one thing I do like is the ease at which you can make a lower-fat/calorie version;this pie is rich anyway so a small piece will usually do:)

Delicious! I've just moved and had to bring a dessert to a function, but had NO utensils to work with. This took me about five minutes to throw together. I halved the recipe to make only one pie. I used 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter and really liked the added texture, but I think next time I'll use around 3/4 cup as the peanut butter flavor wasn't quite strong enough for me. I reserved 1 cup of whipped topping to spread over the top, then drizzled with melted chocolate. I'm not a huge fan of Cool Whip, but its flavor didn't dominate, and it contributed a really nice texture. YUM YUM YUM.

Chose to make one of the pies in a vanilla wafer crust, which won unanimously. After years of trying to make a peanut butter pie that is not too sweet or not too runny or not sooo rich, this recipe is it! Just made this for 12 people and it was a hit! Everyone loved it and wanted more. This was so simple to make, too. My 11 yr old daughter made this in minutes. Freezing it took the longest. It made two pies so we chose to make one in a graham cracker crust and the other in a vanilla wafer crust. The vanilla wafer crust is 1 1/2 c crushed vanilla wafers (chopped in blender) with 1/3 c butter (softened) mixed and pressed into pie plate. Try it. Yummmm!

I have never wrote a review on anything before but after making this recipe I had to. If anyone has ever had Ben and Jerry's "chubby hubby" ice cream they will LOVE this. I didnt have any graham cracker crust or oreo crust that the recipe calls for and desperate to try this recipe because I love peanut butter pie my husband suggested using pretzels. OMG! I took 1 1/2 cups crushed pretzels w/ 1/3 cup sugar and 6 T butter and pressed in bottom of pie pan then made original recipe and froze and then drizzled chocolate syrup on top. If I could rate this higher I would.

Good stuff!  I made it for a birthday party at work and sad to say there was no cake left for the birthday boy to take home! :)  Instead of  two pies, I made one 8x12 pan.  A lot of people recommended using an oreo crust, so I crushed up most of a package of oreos, mixed that with 4T butter and baked at 350 degrees for five minutes to help it set.  (This worked really well.)   As for the topping, you're going to have to be the judge of your own peanut-butter saviness.  Tasting the batter as recipe recommended had too much of a cream-cheese taste for me.  I ended up adding an additional 3/4 cup peanut butter (and a splash more milk to make it moldable).  8oz of Cool Whip was plenty for my purposes, but a 9x13 pan may require a little bit more.  Top with chocolate/peanut butter chips for presentation and taste points.  This is RICH stuff - serve with coffee. :)

this was so rich and delicious- and i dont even like peanut butter! i wanted a quick dessert, and this was definitely it! i cut down to 1 8oz tub of cool whip and eyeballed about 1C of peanut butter and 1/4-1/2C of sugar. I used a store-bought 9" oreo crust and it was perfect proportions- i melted some chocolate chips and spread them in a thin layer over the crust before adding the pb mixture- yummy! topped with chopped reeses pieces and drizzled over with some more melted chocolate chips and melted peanut butter. i used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, reduced fat pb, fat free cool whip, splenda, and left out the milk. it did not taste 'off' from all the substitutions, and i was glad to be able to save some calories... try this recipe! it is soooooo easy and very rich- you won't need seconds :)

Yum, Yum, YUM! Very easy and delicious. Be sure to have a glass of milk or cup of coffee to sip, it is rich. My 6 year old loved it and we have been looking for a good recipe for months for her!
I folded in a few chocolate chips into half and sprinkled some on top of the half that had the chocolate chips. They were crunchy when frozen, what a treat!

Awesome pie...without the milk.  I wanted to do a refrigerated pie, not a frozen pie, so I just cut out the milk, and it was delicious!  It won first prize at my boyfriend's work Thanksgiving party! I used about a package and a half of cream cheese, because I noticed other recipes called for more than 8 oz (and I like cream cheese), but I kept the rest of the recipe the same (minus the milk).  Another review said it was too much PB, and some more people on here said too much sugar, but I thought it was perfect.  I was cautious after reading the reviews about it being super sweet, so I started with only a cup of sugar and it wasn't sweet enough, 1 1/4 still wasn't sweet enough, 1 1/2 (like the recipe calls for) was perfect.  Same with the PB, I started with 3/4 cup, and it wasn't enough, it was too whip creamy.  1 cup is perfect.  I highly recommend this pie, the refrigerated version is very good, especially with peanut butter cups added.  It was very very good, I would make it again and again!

This would have gotten five stars from me and ALL my guests if the pie would have been a better consistency.  BUT DELISH!! For about eight people, both pies we're gone in about an hour even after having a huge dinner!  Just wish it had been firmer =]

I've made this pie as written in years past and it quickly became my younger son's favorite request for his birthday pie (my only change was to make just one full pie, not two smaller ones, as the recipe states). This year due to health concerns I tried reducing the sugar and fat content and everyone loved the results. I used 1-8 oz. lite cream cheese, 1 C. Splenda, 1 C. Simply Jif, 1/4 C. lite soy milk and 1-8 oz. lite Cool Whip. I put this in a reduced-fat graham cracker crust and topped with sugar-free p.b. cups, cut up. Finally I drizzled it with sugar-free choc. syrup. When serving I garnished each piece with a little Redi-whip. It looked delicious and tasted great! Thanks to the submitter for a recipe that is so easy to customize!

I first made this pie at Thanksgiving. Since then it has been requested at every event...Christmas, New Year's Eve, Birthdays, Company Parties.  I've made 15 pies in the last 3 months and it's always a hit - which is great because it's easy to make!!

Made this for my son since he loves peanut butter pie.  After reading other reviews, I cut down the milk to 1/3 cup.  I didn't freeze it but refrigerated the pie.  The pie turned out creamy, but still well-formed and delicious.

I really changed this recipe around (I needed to make it gluten/dairy-free), but the base was still very good.  I cut the recipe in half and used soy cream cheese in place of the regular, and I used only 2 tbs. of powdered sugar, as I made an Italian meringue to use in place of the Cool Whip, and it requires 1/3 cup of sugar on its own.  I also used hemp milk in place of regular.  The quantity-change I made was in the peanut butter--after reading other reviews, I decided to use 3/4 cup of 100% PB (no added oils, salt or sugar!) instead of 1/2, and I'm glad I did.  Even with the additional peanut butter, it still could have used a bit more.  I'll add an additional 1/4 cup next time.  I made a chocolate crust using crushed gluten/dairy-free chocolate cookies, and I covered the filling with a dairy-free chocolate ganache.  An few hours in the freezer, and it came out beautifully, especially when allowed to soften for 5-10 minutes on the counter top before serving.  Light, creamy and not too sweet!  I served it today, and there's only one piece left (which I think I'm going to eat after this!).  Thank you Megan5 for the awesome base, and to everyone's great reviews!!!

Terrific recipe , one of those ones you will use over and over again. I lowered the calories by using fat-free cream cheese and light whipped topping. I also introduced the chocolate aspect, by using a chocolate crust and by drizzling chocolate syrup over the frozen pie when I served it. Company and family all agreed it was keeper!

I brought it to a potluck to rave reviews. Yes, it is rich & peanut buttery, but that is the intent, no?
I took the advice of many and only added about 1/4c milk & a little extra pb so it didn't run. I also made my own graham cracker crust & whipped cream & everything was fine.

Amazing! Perfect.  My husband requested a Peanut Butter Pie the other day.  So,  this is what I made and served it to him as a surprise.  He took one bite and was quiet.  Took another bite, this time with his eyes closed.  I waited.  He then says, "Honey,  oh my goodness.  This is heaven on a plate!"  Yay!  My girls loved it, also.  Me?  Well, I had two slices. :)

Great dessert for peanut butter lovers like myself!

I made a few changes: halved the recipe to make one pie, used the oreo premade crust, added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter, and used crushed up peanut butter cups throughout.

Absolutely delicious! BUT mine turned out soupy, it was way too soft. I don't know if it's because I initially softened the cream cheese because I wasn't sure or if I didn't let it freeze long enough or if there was too much cool whip, but regardless it tasted devine! I had way too many slices! Glad it made 2. Thanks for an awesome recipe. I even got comments it looked like it came from Marie Calendar, lol.

I made a lower-fat version of this and it was EXCELLENT I used neufachtel cream cheese (1/3 lower fat), light whipped cream (only 12 oz. instead of 16) and reduced fat peanut butter. However, I probably added all of those calories back by cutting up 3 peanut butter cups and layering them on top of the crust (next time I will use more because they weren't very noticeable) and I shaved some chocolate onto the top, which is a must! This is a keeper!

This is a FROZEN pie.  It stays in your freezer the whole time.  Don't put it in your refrigerator!    That being said, it was wonderful!  I cut the recipe in half because I didn't need 2 pies, but it went so fast we could have used another! Next time I'll make 2, and my kids have requested it this week.  I used a chocolate graham crust and added in crushed peanut butter cups.  It tasted delicious and was quite refreshing on a hot summer day!

Yummy...this was really good and extremely easy.  I bought ready-made oreo pie crust at Wal-Mart & made it even easier.  Followed the recipe exactly but did let the cream cheese sit out for about half an hour so it would mix easier.  Put the pies in the freezer for four hours before serving so they were set up but not frozen solid.  You cannot have any doubt that this is a peanut butter pie as the peanut butter is definitely dominating...so, if you don't like peanut butter you will not like this.  Thanks Megan for sharing this recipe.  It will go in my "special desserts" file.  Mary Jane...

This was excellent. As the other reviews mentioned, I used the oreo crust, half whip, extra peanut butter, diced reeces cups and a bag of cropped heath candy bar for topping.  I think that really did the trick.

My family raves about this pie. I chop up Reeces and mix it into the batter - it makes it extra yummy.  It's super easy to make.

This recipe is fantastic with moderations. Instead of prepared pie shells, I make my own crust with cookie graham crumbs. Then I make the cake as directed and finish by putting crunched up Oreos on top (like the picture). A big hit! And it's good right out of the freezer, or defrosted for a while.

I think I would have liked it more if I had an oreo crust or something. I don't feel compelled to give it a 5 star, I'm not sure why. It's pretty good though, I'm just not blown away.

Awesome pie. Very easy. I used only 1 cup of the confectioner's sugar as I figured a cup and 1/2 would be too sweet. Turned out perfect. Sweet but not over the top. I used a store bought Oreo crust. I garnished with mini peanut butter cups and a chocolate fudge drizzle.

I made this for dessert a few weeks back when we had friends over for dinner.  Everyone enjoyed it very much!  I followed the recipe except for using only about 3/4 of the cool whip called for, and reducing the milk a bit.  I used a graham cracker crust that had "2 extra servings" and it filled the one pie perfectly.  Folded in some crushed pb cups, topped with some of the remaining cool whip, and a few more whole pb cups.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, but definitely cut down on the sugar somewhat or it tastes too sweet and the peanut butter flavor doesn't come through as much.  I did the nutter butter crust (YUMMY), only 1 cup sugar, NO milk, and only 8 oz of whipped topping.  If you add in the milk and the extra container of cool whip it gets really runny.  Sooooo very yummy the way I made it!

Unbelievably delish!  It tastes like a frozen peanut butter cup!  I did make a couple personal adjustments. I used an Oreo chocolate pie crust.  I added a thin layer of hot fudge ice cream topping to the bottom of the crust along with one chopped peanut butter cup before adding the filling.  On top of the filling I added more hot fudge by using a fork, and also 2 chopped peanut butter cups.  For the finishing touch, I piped rosettes of whipped topping around the pie.  This was so easy to make and everyone loved it.  You definitely DO NOT need to let the pie sit out of the freezer before serving.

Oh My GOOODDDD....soooo good!  I brought one of the pies into work and it was gone in ten minutes.  Im not a good cook but this was easy and FAST!  I bought the oreo crust, put chocolate syrup on the bottom, and sprinkled with minature peanut butter cups and kisses and more chocolate syrup.  To Die For!  Don't look any further!!!  I wish I could've given it more stars!

This pie was so delicious, creamy, and satisfying. The fact that they can sit in the freezer for weeks (maybe months?) is a wonderful plus also, because you can pull one out whenever you feel like something sweet. Too bad it hasn't ever been able to sit in my freezer long enough for that to be a real advantage.
I added a *very* thin layer of melted milk chocolate to the bottom of the crust before pouring in the pie mixture (when frozen, chocolate can become hard as a rock), and also sprinkled crushed reeses cups on the top and a drizzle of more melted milk chocolate for presentation.

There were so many suggestions for changes to this recipe, but I think it is wonderful as is. Try it this way first before you add chocolate, if you are a true peanut butter lover. But, use a homemade graham cracker crust. Store bought ones generally have the flavor and consistency of sawdust.

This recipe was far too soupy for me. When the pie is frozen, it ends up being alright (except hard as a brick and impossible to cut) but I would definitely recommend reducing the amount of milk in it. It seems like most peanut butter pie recipes don't call for any milk. Some call for only a tablespoon or two. The flavor of the pie was fine, it was just the consistency that was bad.

Soooo good and really rich. If you add caramel and peanuts to the top it would taste just like a snickers ice cream bar! Be sure your cream cheese is soft or it will take you forever to beat out the lumps. And I also just beat everything together, including the whip cream till smooth and creamy. Love it

IF you like peanut butter, you will like this recipe.  I thought it was OK.  But I think it's because I am not a big peanut butter fan.  Otherwise, the recipe is easy to make...just wish I had made something different.

This pie was so easy and quick to make and was rich yet really light.  I think an addition of chocolate is definitely needed though.  I sprinkled ground up dark chocolate on the top along with some choclate syrup and it was delicious!

I have made this several times in just the last month!  I'm told it's "To Die For." Fabulous recipe.  The only additions I make is I buy hot fudge icecream topping, heat it and pour some in the bottom of the pie crust before freezing.  And then I take oreos, remove the cream and crush them to sprinkle on top.

If you like peanut butter, this pie is for you. IT IS REALLY RICH so have a glass of milk ready. I did as others suggested and only used 1 cup powdered sugar, One 8oz container of cool whip and 1 cup of milk. I made one for my son's pre school's teacher meeting and the director's comments were, "OH MY! That pie was DANGEROUS! It was really good!"  I made one for dinner at my brother in law's and they said it was good. Make sure you freeze it over night if you want it more like peanut butter ice cream, like an ice cream cake with the crushed oreo cookie crust. I used an entire bag of oreos and 5 tbs of melted butter, and cooked the crust for 15 minutes. DO NOT smash the cookies down into the pie pan too hard or the crust will be like a rock.  Good and easy but VERY PEANUT BUTTERY! It gets soft REALLY EASILY so don't let it sit out for too long or you have crust and soupy peanut butter mush all over.

Good recipe,but i prefer a more dense peanut butter pie so i cut the milk down to 1/2 cup and only use 8 ounces of cool whip and use only one graham cracker crust and grate a hershey chocolate bar on top.this makes a deep dish style thick silky dense peanut butter pie. my husband says it reminds him of homemade no bake peanut butter cheesecake.

I love this pie! My dad taught me this recipe a few years ago and I've been experimenting with since then. My favorite is in an oreo crust with chopped up peanut butter cups in it.

Yum! Halved ingredients and made one pie. Used Extra creamy Cool Whip & added only a few tablespoons of milk. Topped with chocolate syrup & chopped peanuts. Will try the Nutter Butter crust next time.

This was so tasty. Using a chocolate crust or crunchy topping would make it even better!

People LOVE this recipe!!!  SO GOOD! Made with nutter butter crust, as PP suggested, also cut back on powdered sugar to only 1 cup in the filling.  Before spreading the peanut butter filling in the crust, spread 1 jar of fudge ice cream topping in crust then spread the filling on top.
Made it like this last year & have 2 make more pies this year.  Tried to adjust the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan so it packs well in a cooler 4 picnic.
UPDATE:Made this recipe w/ low fat substitutions:  4 oz. low fat cream cheese & 4 oz. non fat cream cheese.  Also, poured off oil from natural creamy peanut butter & used what was left which intensified peanut butter flavor and cut the fat a little.  Used "free" whipped topping & added 1 tsp vanilla 2 the 1/2 cup milk that I use, (reduced from the original recipe).  DID make this in a rectangle pan, which resulted in a thinner dessert and will go back to using my springform pan as I did the first time I made it make a thicker dessert.
The next time I make this (for fam reunion again) I'll make sure to use a mix of non fat cream cheese and low fat cream cheese.  There's plenty of fat in the peanut butter to give you that luxurious mouth feel.
TIP:  freeze this dessert and take it out 1 hour before serving and slice & then let it rest at room temp. This also works well for taking this pie to outdoor get togethers.  Some folks prefer to eat it while still partially frozen as on a hot summer day it feels like an peanut butter ice cream pie.

I made this last weekend, and I can honestly say both pies were devoured in 24 hours.  I love this recipe it's so easy.  This called for 16 oz I only had a 12 or 13oz "frozen whipped topping carton"  and it was plenty.  I bought some chocolate Sundae syrup and squeeze over the top.  It got rave rave reviews by my family.  Highly recommend this recipe

Amazing! This is my go-to dessert whenever I'm entertaining friends. They're always impressed with the quality of the pie, especially when they find out how easy it is to make! I use Oreo crusts every time, only 1/4 cup of milk, 12 oz of Cool Whip instead of 16, and an extra dollop of peanut butter. My boyfriend works for a radio station and I made it for some of the on-air talent he works with. One of them called it "restaurant quality" pie!

Easy and delicious. Used graham cracker crust and sprinkled on chopped chocolate chips which was all we had. Oreo cookie crust or crumbled Oreos on top would have been even better,

LOVED this pie!  myself, 4 kids and even my husband (who hates peanut butter) loved it!  the only thing I did different was to add hazelnut coffee creamer instead of the milk.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was "OK". I made the pies as described in the recipe and I thought the whip topping took over the texture and flavor of the pie.

This is delicious and so easy. I like it in a chocolate cookie crust. I've made it into store-bought Oreo crusts, and once I put the whole recipe into a 9x13 Pyrex with a cookie crust I made. Both were great. I also sprinkle salted peanuts (love the sweet/salty combo) and drizzle with chocolate and caramel syrup. It looks great. You can make this days ahead and keep it in the freezer.

Delicious.  I tried it with the oreo crust and the graham crust from this site.  I think the oreo crust is too strong and takes away from the peanut butter flavor.  The graham was just perfect.  Topped with whipped cream and put peanut butter cups and drizzled chocolate on top of that!  This is my go to dessert.

This was delicious. I gave it 4 starts because I made modifications:  * Only used 1/2 the milk the recipe called for * Only used 1/2 the cool whip the recipe called for * Used Nutterbutters for the crust * Put a layer of chocolate dessert fudge on the crust before adding in the cream.

This is awesome.  I used  chocolate crust.  I put it in the freezer for about an hour and then I put a thin layer of hot fudge sauce.  Put back in the freezer for about 30 minutes and put a thin layer of cool whip on it.  It is so easy to make and people where fighting over the last piece.

It is delic.  I made it by the receipe except 8oz. of whipped topping and spooned it in to dessert dishes with crumbled nutter butter cookies to garnish.  Refrig., it is firmer with less whipped topping and makes a wonderful parfait.

Awesome!  SOOO easy and so tasty (I halved the recipe to make one pie).  I made my own graham cracker crust, added a tsp. or so of vanilla and maybe a little extra peanut butter (I didn't measure).  After it sat in the freezer for an hour or so, I "frosted" it with the following: In a bowl, put 1/4 dark chocolate chips, 1 1/2 tbsp. milk, and a tsp. of butter.  Microwave on 50% for a minute, and then stir stir stir until melted.  Spoon/spread on top, and freeze.  So good!

This is a great recipe!  I made the crust using Nutter Butters as someone else suggested and added a bottom layer of fudge ice cream topping.  It turned out awesome!  Went over great at the party I took it to!

This was a huge sucess! I made this for some friends, they all loved it. 3 asked for the recipe. I did add 1 1/2 cups of Peanut Butter, also did use the Oreo pie crust, and did add the hot fudge at the bottom of the crust and the top of the pie. I also did freeze the pie for over 2 hours.

This was excellent!  I used chocolate syrup in the bottom of my crust and also swirled some on top of the pie.  I used low fat whipped cream, low fat cream cheese and low fat milk and it was excellent!

AWESOME! Delicious, but easy recipe!  Made this several times over the holidays.  Changes that work well: spread about 1/4 cup chocolate fudge (NOT hot fudge) ice cream topping on bottom of each crust before adding filling, decorate top of pie with chocolate sprinkles.  A chocolate crust is also good!

This is an excellent pie recipe...especially if your a peanut butter lover like my kids and I.  I've been making this pie for a long time with just a few alterations.  I use sweetened condensed milk in place of the regular milk and add a tsp of vanilla.  Sometimes I don't even put it in a pie crust, I just eat it like a pudding.  It's so good either way.  There are so many things you could do with this recipe..just use your imagination.  Happy Cooking!!

YUM!  This pie is cool, creamy, peanut-buttery  and absolutely decadent!!!  I too used the Neufchatel cheese, low-fat cool whip and reduced fat peanut butter.  I poured everything into a Keebler chocolate crust and topped it with chocolate chips.  Sure glad it makes two pies!  A definite keeper - thanks Megan!!!!!

This was sooo good!  Everybody loved it.  I did make a few changes:  I used the chocolate graham crusts, I drizzled choclate syrup on the top and then swirled it with a knife, and then I chopped up some milk choclate chips in my food processor and sprinkled it on right before serving.  The only thing I'll do next time is make sure it has plenty of time to freeze.  I think I was a little too anxious and took it out too early because after a few minutes it got a little runny - my fault.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this and was met with demands I make another one pronto and share the recipe.  I swirled chcolate syrup into the top of the pie with a knife.  For one pie, use 3/4 C powdered sugar, just a tbsp or two of milk, and reduce Cool Whip to 8 oz. Also yummy with chunky pnut butter. Either way, this pie WILL go fast.  Delicious!

I have been looking for a peanut butter pie that resembled the kind my Grandmama made when I was a kid.  Next time I think I will add chocolate drizzle or chocolate crust!!  Thanks for the great recipe

I made this pie last year for the holidays and this year everyone has requested that I make it again.  I put a Jersey Milk chocolate bar through the food processor and sprinkle the pieces on top.  Tastes like a peanut butter cup.  Fabulous recipe, thank you!

I took another reviewer's advice and did not add milk. I also did not use a whole tub of cool whip. I added chopped mini unwrapped Reese's bites and drizzled Hershey's syrup on the top. The recipe as I made it did not fill 2 pies. Just one.
Edited to add: I also use a chocolate pie crust.

I made this recipe last year and it was  little runny.  I tried it again with a few changes (it was going to a picnic and wouldn't be eaten for an hour or so) and it was incredible.  First, I followed someone's advice and made a nutter butter crust - divine!  To make 2 crusts, use a whole package and 6-7 Tblsp of butter.  I baked it for 7 minutes at 375.  Next, I omitted the milk.  I ran a bit short for filling 2 pies but next time I would just add another 1/2 of the other ingredients. I received a lot of compliments.  I think the pie is fine (with the milk) if serving right away out of freezer - I just need it to hold up better.

I followed this exactly and we loved it!! I drizzled mine with Hersheys choc syrup and covered with peanut butter and chocolate chips on top. Its nice that the recipe leaves you to be creative with your own toppings, however the pie filling/mixture is just so yummy on its own. Thank you :)

It was great!  Followed recipe except I used 12 oz cool whip (which was enough), instead of two pies I just one deep 9". Had a little left over but the kiddos took care of it. They dipped their bananas in it!  I also made an Oreo crust bc I don't like graham cracker crusts. I mixed, 32 Oreos, crushed, and 1/4 cup melted butter. I also drizzled the top with Reese's peanut butter hard shell ice cream topper!  Yum!!

Delicious, I put a little less milk like other reviewers suggested and I only had an 8 oz tub of frozen whipped topping.  Still came out delicious and made two pies.  I topped with crushed oreo cookies! So easy too!

Made as is it is a tasty four star pie. But the second time I made it, I tweaked it a bit and I think it went up to a five star pie. I lowered the milk amount to 1/4 cup (perfect!), and added a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla extract. I doubled the cream cheese and the peanut butter and I used a chocolate cookie crust instead of graham cracker (what is better than chocolate and peanut butter???). I have also made this with a Nutter Butter cookie crust and drizzled chocolate sauce over the top before serving. Seriously, yum!!!

I've been making these pies for several years now.  I originally used the graham cracker crusts as specified in the recipe but now use Oreo cookie crusts.  I also "stripe" the top with chocolate syrup and use a knife to make a design on top.  I especially like that the recipe makes two pies so that I can use one and freeze the other.  Great recipe.

It was super light and airy! I made it for a summer BBQ and everyone loved it! I added mini peanut butter cups on top and I suggest buying big ones and chopping them up because the peanut butter to chocolate ratio was off.

Perfecto!It was creamy, peanut buttery goodness! Our tub of "cool whip" was a natural one from Whole Foods and it was only 10 oz. but the mix filled two 9" pie dishes. We did one graham cracker crust and one with chocolate MI-DEL chocolate snaps(crushed) from Whole Foods. Everyone preferred chocolate. My husband and kids loved it.

Also, don't forget to set out the cream cheese and let it come to room temperature. This will ensure that it will be smooth when you mix it.

Absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe in 1/2 to make 1 pie, but followed the recipe exactly other than that. It was wonderful! The filling is light and fluffy. I had no problem with it being runny or remaining set, but definitely mixed thoroughly. It was super good as written, but I think I'll use a chocolate cookie crust and maybe some crumbled peanut butter cups as a topping next time. Thanks for sharing!

As hot as its been for most of the US this summer, no-bake dessert options are ideal, and this one delivered a winning outcome. Only making one pie, I used the Nutter Butter crust idea along with reduced fat cream cheese, the entire 16oz container of light whipped topping, 1 1/4 c peanut butter, 1 Tbsp vanilla, as well as 1/8 c heavy cream (out of milk) to assist in the mixing process. I mixed everything together with a mixer rather than folding in certain ingredients, which rendered a perfect consistency. Popped the finished product in the freezer for 30 minutes to let it set up a bit more, and it was awesome! Perfectly peanut buttery and smooth as silk! Next time I make this treat, I would double the Nutter Butter crust (just personal preference), throw it in a 10" springform pan and drizzle the top with dessert fudge and additional Nutter Butter cookies, as well as some crushed up Snickers. Outstanding!

I didn't use the milk. I didn't make the pie crust. Mixed cream cheese, powdered sugar, PB, cool whip, and about 15 crushed up Oreos together. This mixture equals heaven in a giant bowl. I may or may not have eaten the whole thing 2 days before a 1/2 marathon.

This pie is good, and a light texture, but I prefer the creamier recipes made without milk.  I'll use this recipe without adding the 1 cup of milk in the future.

It was a hit. Made 1 pie with regular graham cracker crust and one with chocolate cookie crumb crust. The chocolate crust was the family favorite. I topped with chocolate syrup and a pinch of crushed peanuts.

I didn't this would turn out great actually.  I followed the recipe as is and it was really.  I was pleasantly surprized.  The only bad thing was waiting for the pie to set to I made it late and enjoyed it the next day.  Was Awesome.

My family loves this recipe! It's now a must have at all gatherings. However, we use a oreo cookie chocolate pie crust from the grocey store instead of a graham craker one and I like to use Reese's Peanut butter.

Amazing recipe, it truly is. I made this for my brother because he is a peanut-butter-oholic and he ADORED it. However, I did change up the recipe a little bit. I made my own oreo crust, increased PB to 1.25 cups, and used less whip cream (only about 80% of the container) and it was still very very very good. I didn't think any of the tastes (PB, Cream cheese, sugar) were too overpowering. A really delicious pie, frozen or thawed. I did not top it with anything, but I think reese's cups or shaved chocolate would be amazing. LOW FAT: Low fat PB, low fat milk, and low fat (not free) whip cream. I always find that FREE whip cream does not set up as well as lite or fully leaded, but that's just my personal opinion.

I tried this out a few days ago, I made a crust using Reese's Puffs Cereal (one box of this cereal has enough for about three pie crusts), about 6 cups ground down end up being roughly 1 and a half cups which fits perfectly in a 9-inch pie tin. I baked that crust and after it cooled I added the filling.

I replaced the milk with half & half to make it creamier, and it did wonders! I'm thinking of trying this out with whipping cream because the pie doesn't hold all that well, but regardless, it was delicious!

Very easy to make. Im not a huge fan of peanut butter but this was very yummy! I only added 1 8oz of whipped cream and it was still very good. Will make again for sure. =)

Time and aggravation saving tips; if you want to make only ONE pie to see if you like this first before making enough for two you can improve upon it by using a Nutter Butter crust (24 crushed Nutter Butter cookies & 5 Tbsp. of butter mixed together & pressed into bottom & sides of a pie plate) as rec'd by RX3, and instead use 1/2 cup sugar and 8 oz cool whip. Omit milk and add 1 Tbsp. vanilla. The milk causes pie to melt if left unfrozen. Overall I found this to be too sweet for my tastes, which is why I modified revision to 1/2 rather than 3/4 cup sugar but I wish I could like it more though those that tried it with me loved it so YMMV.

This is an delicious, easy recipe!  I cut the fat a little by using low-fat cream cheese.  I also use a chocolate crumb crust rather than regular graham cracker crust and top with chocolate shavings.  YUM!

Super easy and really yummy! Topped with crumbled peanut butter cups, and Hersey's syrup and it was perfect.

As was suggested by a few other reviewers I added only 3/4 of the cool whip, put a layer of fudge on the bottom of the crust, and added Reese cups halved to the top. Sweet and easy!

This recipe was FABULOUS!! I am obsessed with PB pie, and this tasted just as good as what you can get at a restaurant. My hubby loved it too! I'm going to try making this a few more times- one with a chocolate graham cracker pie crust and one with a home made Nutter Butter crust. Thanks for sharing this!!!

I kept the recipe essentially the same but added a few options like using chunky peanut butter for a different texture. I also cover the bottom of the piw crust with chocolate magic shell ice cream topping for more chocolate flavor!

It is imperative that chocolate ghram crust be used and the top be drizzled with chocolate, it provides an essential crunchy and bitter balance against the sweet/creamy peanutbutter filling.

The one word I read for this pie that fits it perfectly is 'plush', creamy and rich, best out of the freezer, not overly sweet or overly peanutbuttery. The texture is truly remarkable.

The real beauty of this recipe is in how easily it forms variations. One for diabetics, one for lower fat, mine used soft goat cheese and milk-free whipped topping to make it dairy free.

Amazing recipe, very easy to make. I Used half the amount of whipped topping, and used nutterbutter cookies for the crust, as someone else recommended. Half a cup of milk would've been better to use, as well.

Loved this!!  We made sure the cream cheese was softened at room temperature before we made the filling - the filling turned out smooth and velvety.  And we didn't add anything special to the top - I offered whipped cream and chocolate sauce, but no one wanted it.  It's perfect the way it is!  (Oh, but I did use an Oreo crust instead of graham cracker.)

Awesome! I made the whole recipe of pie filling but only made one pie. I used the rest of the filling for apple dip. I also made a milk chocolate ganache to top the pie with...so good.

This was excellent! My family loved it and the best part was it only takes a few minutes to make! I used an oreo crust and decorated the top with mini PB cups and mini oreo cookies...the pie didnt last long at ;). Just know that this pie needs to be served frozen and put back in the freezer if there are leftovers. The pie is similar to an icecream cake so if left out it does loose its shape.

This is so good and easy to make! It was in the freezer in about 5 minutes. I only used an 8 oz tub of whip topping. I filled 1 crust really full and saved the rest in the whip cream tub. I will definitley make this again but add somethind chololate to it.

Wow! This was amazing! I also would say the 16 ozs of whipped topping is too much or to add more peanut butter. At 12 ounces my pie started to look almost white. Tasted great!

This made 1 really rich decadent peanut butter pie! I took the advice one of the reviews & used only 3/4 c. conf. sugar, 1/2 c. milk, 1 (12 oz) cool whip and made only ONE pie. It had the best peanut butter flavor ever and it wasn't super sweet. I made an oreo crust for mine. Fantasic even when I used sugar free cool whip & reduced fat cream cheese!!

SUPER easy and TASTY pie!  I halved the recipe to make 1 pie, let it set in the freezer overnight, and then placed it in the fridge until ready to serve.  I little chocolate syrup on top and it was as pretty as can be!  Thanks!

Very easy to make and it is oh so rich. We like it in a chocolate crust with choc syrup drizzled on top and an extra dollop of whipped cream to cut the richness.

VERY easy!  My five year old did a lot of the work.  He chose an Oreo crust and then we topped it with Oreo crumbles.  Everyone loved it!

I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner and everybody RAVED about it and thought it must have been hard to make.  If you like peanut butter - you have to try this!

I made this for Mother's Day and my 82-year-old mom raved, and so did my kids and grands! I didn't use as much whipped topping, only because I misread the label on the tub I bought (12 oz) and I added maybe a couple tablespoons more peanut butter. I've already been warned this will be requested often.

I agree with another reviewer on this one.  You don't need the whole 16oz of whipped topping--you only need about 12oz.  For a lower fat version, I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, skim milk, fat free cool whip, and reduced fat Skippy peanut butter.  I added a layer of Hersheys hot dessert fudge on top of the crust and drizzled some on top of the peanut butter filling once it set, and the end result was delicious!

The recipe was absolutely above and beyond anything!  I made my own whipped cream (16oz heavy cream, whipped, then stir in 1 c sifted confectioners sugar -- enough for the 2 pies).  I also topped them with chopped Reeses Peanut Butter cups (6 cups per pie - covered the whole top).  A tip:  Freeze it, then let it thaw somewhat.  It's WAY too hard to eat right out of the freezer.

I used the Chocolate Wafer Crust recipe, which is also from this site and made it in a 9 inch square pan as one large pie, only because my fridge realty space is quite dear. I also used lite whipped topping and lite cream cheese. I won't touch this but am making treats for the hubs who complains that I make him all these delicious treats and he's getting fat. Easy enough for my oldest son to help make and almost all the ingredients I bought cheaply at my local grocery outlet. Anytime I can make something my husband loves and cut corners deserves at least four stars!

This was a HIT!  I followed KXR173's suggestions (nutter butter crust and omitting the milk, only using 8 oz. Cool Whip & using 3/4 cup sugar & 1 Tbsp. vanilla to make only 1 pie).  I added a thin layer of Magic Shell to the crust before adding the filling.  Then, I drizzled some more over the top, and added Reese's Peanut Butter cups (cut into quarters).  Looked great, and tasted even better.  Will be making it again this weekend for another get-together!

I made this in a 9x13 glass dish instead of making 2 pies.  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used half the milk and about 3/4 of the whipped topping and 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter.  I made an oreo crust out of 24 cookies and 5 Tablespoons of butter.  I layered half the filling and topped it with chopped up Reeses Peanut butter cups and hot fudge topping, put another layer of the filling and topped again with the hot fudge ice cream topping making a pretty swirly design then putting more Reeses on top.  It was delicious! Will definitely be making this again.

I made this with no changes. I really liked it, but I think I would give it 5 stars if there were some kind of inclusions like Reese's Pieces or Peanut ButterCups, maybe even chopped up Oreo Cookies. I will add something next time but can't give 5 stars since it's not in the recipe. Still very good and worth the tiny effort to make it since it is very easy. Liked that it made 2 pies so I could give one away =)

Lip licking good! I did this with my favorite chocolate cookie crust. I use 
1 1/2 cups crushed chocolate cookies.  Mix with 6 Tablespoons melted butter. Pressed in 9" pan. Set aside while making filling. I only use 1/4 cup milk. Every thing else the same. I put halfs of a peanut butter cups pin wheel fashion (cut side down)around pie edges.  When I serve I drizzle with hot fudge sauce. Each slice gets a peanut butter half.

The flavours of this pie are all wrong. I baked it on Christmas day and NOBODY ate it, including my 3 young children. Peanut butter is a savory taste, a distinct, stong flavour on buttered toast and even when you dip your finger in, the pb coats your upper palate. This pie combines it with cream. Icing sugar. Cream cheese. It is still sitting in my freezer and I know I will have to throw it away. I love pb, but mixed with cream, cream cheese and sugar it is inedible for us. My advice to all who need this pie for a special dessert - make it in advance and try it for yourself in case you don't like it.

I made this last night for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best dessert he's ever eaten! I did change it as follows: 1 1/4C Peanut Butter, 8oz of Cool Whip, Half a package of Nutter Butters + 5Tbsp butter for crust. I also poured Hershey's Chocolate sauce over the nutter butter crust. Froze in about 2 hours, took it out added a layer of Cool Whip and decorated with melted peanut butter, chocolate sauce, and crushed Reese's Cups. DELISH!

This is so easy and so delicious. I followed some recommendations and made changes. I made the filling with 1 8oz. package of cream cheese, 3/4 c. confectioners sugar, 1 c. peanut butter, and 3/4 container of Cool Whip (I use the rest to top the pie with). I use all low-fat ingredients and all natural peanut butter. I pour it all in a pre-made Oreo crust and decorate with fudge topping.

This is a great recipe.  I changed a few things and it was delicious!!!  I am not a big whipped cream fan, so in place of that I used heavy whipping cream and whipped that for several minutes then when it was time to fold in the whipped topping I folded in the heavy whipping cream.  I also poured a layer of hot fudge on the crust before I poured in the peanut butter mixture!  YUMM-O!

Excellent...you can't go wrong with this pie.  I used two small 9 inch pans and bought the roll out pie pastry.  I then chopped up 4 reese's peanut butter cups per pie and put them in the crust while they were still a bit warm so the chocolate would melt a bit.  I only used a small container of whipped cream and subsituted 1/2 a cup of half and half for the milk. I used magic shell chocolate fudge topping to create a pretty pattern on the top and sprinkled mixed nut peanut topping on each.  I served each slice with a squirt of redi whipped topping.  EXCELLENT!!!!!

I have been making PB pie for quite a few years now, this is the recipe I was given by my father.  I made this for Mother's Day lunch and did the suggestion of the other reviewer of Nutter Butter cookies and fudge topping at the bottom. OH MY GOODNESS!!!! To die for.  I didn't think Peanut Butter Pie could get any better, or any richer.  It was wonderful!!! If you are looking for a recipe to impress this is it.  Make sure there is cold milk nearby.

Ahh. So good. =)
A couple of suggestions:

- Don't go with a pre-made crust. Crush some Nutter Butters, mix with butter, and use that for a crust.

-Don't use the entire thing of cool whip. Using too much gives it no shape. It will get wobbly and runny very quickly.

And I also too the remaining Nutter Butters and dipped them in chocolate and rolled them in crushed pieces of Reese's cups to decorate.

Wonderful!!!  I folded in a cup of chocolate chips.  My son stuck his whole head in the bowl to lick the bowl out!  This recipe is a keeper.

This was VERY yummy.  My whole family loved it and it made enough for the neighbors too.  I used chocolate graham cracker crust and crushed up Reeses Peanut Butter cups and sprinkled them on top.  Very good.  We will make this again for sure.

This is a wonderful recipe. Very easy to make and affordable. Took it to Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I used one with graham cracker pie crust and the other with oreo. I actually liked the oreo better. I added chopped mini reese's cup on one and chocolate syrup on the other. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. For those debating over making this recipe, do not waste time reading reviews. It is excellent!

This was delicious!  It was very creamy and very tasty.  For the crust I used Nutter Butters crushed up in my food processor to stay consistent with a peanut butter taste.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I just add a teaspoon of vanilla, more peanut butter to taste and two chopped Reese peanut butter cups on top.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is definetly a keeper!!!  I love that it makes two pies- one for now, and one to keep in the freezer.  It is so simple and easy to prepare!  I made a couple of very minor changes- I used a store-bought chocolate oreo pie crust, and smoothed a layer of hot fudge over the crust before adding the peanut butter filling.  I garnished the top of the pie with chocolate shavings.  It came out looking so fancy, but was no effort at all.  Delicious without being overly rich!  Definetly a keeper!

This recipe is awesome! I used low fat cream cheese and low fat cool whip, and put in some extra peanut butter to the mixture.  I also crushed some nutter butter cookies for garnish on top, as well as swirled chocolate syrup on top for some color.  We couldn't wait long enough for it to cool in freezer, and it was wonderful!!! Will definitely make again.

Fabulous.  It goes together in less than 5 minutes and cuts perfectly even though its frozen.  I drizzled some chocolate and peanut butter, melted, over the top.  Got RAVE reviews.  This is my new favorite dessert recipe for when company is coming!!!

I substitute the cream cheese with low fat, sugar with splenda, non fat frozen whipped topping and milk with 1%, it still tastes awesome!!! I put them in the mini graham cracker crusts.

This is SO GOOD!  It is the same recipe as was (maybe still is) served at the Dockside Restaurant on the C&D Canal in Chesapeake, Maryland.  About 20 years ago when I lived in that area, I would occasionally dine there and would ALWAYS order this pie for dessert.  I was given this recipe by the restaurant and have made it ever since.  A DEFINITE KEEPER!

Five stars isn't enough!  This recipe was fast, easy, creamy, YUMMY!  I halved the recipe and made only one, and used the Oreo crust (as suggested by others), AND even used generic peanut butter (what I already had), and this was the best dessert ever!  Can't wait to make it again!

Yum!  This is awesome.  I took the advice of other reviewers and spread hot fudge at the bottom of the crust, glad I did!  It's very light, yet very rich at the same time.  We love it, Thanks!

Very good! I used fat-free cream cheese (it cut down the richness) & an Oreo crust - it was absolutely delicious!  I will make this again & again (but only on my cheat days of course)!!

Delicious! I added hot fudge to the bottom of the pie, as others have suggested. I wondered why this recipe received such great reviews.  Now that I have tasted the pie, I know why.  My husband was skepticle, but ended up loving it.  We thought that it was better frozen than refrigerated.

Absolutely Divine! I halved this and made one pie and put it in an Oreo crust. This is such a wonderful recipe. You can do so many variations with this since it is such a wonderful filling. Never again will I half this recipe - this is simply too good to make just one! Talk about easy - this is simplicity at its' yummiest!

So yummy! We shared one with some friends last night and she called today wanting the recipe! I
-used a chocolate pie shell (I think an oreo one would taste great!)
-Poured (spooned) a layer of fudge sauce on the crust before topping with the filling.
-Sprinkled w/ Autumn "sprinkles"....one could use whatever the season/holiday is at the time.
Thanks for sharing this recipe, Megan! It's a keeper!

A delicious dessert, and very easy, too. I followed others' recommendations and added fudge sauce to the bottom of a store bought graham cracker crust, and cut up mini peanut butter cups into four pieces and added them as a topping. Everybody loved it. It's also a dessert that looks like a lot of work when actually it's pretty easy.

Yummy!  Another fun way to add chocolate is to 
melt 1 cup semisweet morsels over a double boiler,
spread morsels over graham cracker crust, and chill until firm, BEFORE adding your peanut butter
mixture.  Almost like the candy!

WOW!!! THANKS REVIEWER GUNNHP! I only needed one pie so I followed Gunnhp's advice.  Turned out terrific! I would be the first to say a pie is too sweet but this was perfect! Plus, NO BAKING (desserts are still not my forte).  Also, a large thank you from my family goes out to the submitter, Megan! WE LOVED IT! I think I'll surprise my extended family this holiday season!!

This was a big hit at the office.  I also omitted the milk and used an Oreo crust.  I drizzled chocolate syrup at the bottom of the crust.  I only used about 3/4 of the cool whip. --- I have now made this a ton of times.  I always use Skippy All Natural Peanut Butter (otherwise it can be too sweet).  I only use about a tablespoon of milk.  It is a huge hit and no one knows how easy it is.   I top with chopped up peanut butter cups.  It freezes super well and I usually have one on hand for unexpected company.

Very creamy with a delicate peanut butter taste.  It wasn't too strong.  The only thing I would change is to maybe tint the filling with some food coloring because it appeared too light in color.  It's a psychological thing for me since PB is supposed to be dark brown! :)  I used a regular crust, and followed the directions exactly.

I'm not (wasn't) a peanut butter pie fan until my wife made this for our daughter. It is very creamy and rich. I think I will go and get the last piece now (he-he).

I’ve been making this pie for all our holiday dinners for 5-6 years now. We prefer this pie with a chocolate cookie crust [http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228792/mock-chocolate-cookie-crust], and top with chopped mini-reeses cups. I use low fat cream cheese and whipped topping, and nonfat milk, (but I only use 1/2 cup of milk), and upped the peanut butter to 1-1/2 cups. Everyone that tries this, loves it! **For the person that complained that it gets runny when it thaws, it's supposed to be a frozen pie, like ice cream. Just let it thaw long enough to be able to slice it, then serve, and freeze the rest!**

This is a great pie.  Easy and delicious plus no need to put the hot stove on during the summer.  My kids must of loved it too because there was an empty tin before the day was over.  At least I got to try a small piece.

I used spring-pan heart shape. Make Oreo cookie crust with 24pcs of  Oreo with 1/4 cup of margarine instead of graham pie crust. Used peanut butter chunky not creamy, my family loved it and will surely make another one soon

Fantastic! Made for a single pie and made some changes: 1c. peanut butter, 8oz cream cheese, 1c. icing sugar, 1/2 c. milk, 1 small whipped topping and 12 peanut butter cups (half for the filling and 1/2 for the top of the pie), also used a chocolate graham cracker crust.

The pie has an excellent flavor, but the milk can be omitted or reduced to 1/4 cup to improve the texture.  Like some other reviewers, I also found the pie became runny incredibly fast. It melts much quicker than ice cream, which unfortunately makes it impractical in many settings.  I have tried several other variations which were firmer with only refrigeration - this is the reason I did not give it four stars.

I followed the advice of several commenters and used twice the amount of peanut butter and cream cheese. I only had one graham cracker pie crust so I cut the whole recipe in half. I didn't have any whipped cream so I used 1.5 c heavy whipping cream & 3 tbsp white sugar and beat it on high for several minutes until it became whipped cream. I mixed some of the whipped cream in with the pie mix and put the rest on top. Also, I am a chocolate lover so I put a layer of sundae fudge on the bottom, before I poured in the pie filling. On top of the pie, I drizzled sundae fudge and melted peanut butter. I was heavy handed on that part and I'm glad because it added a lot to the pie. I did freeze it for two hours and then ate a piece. It was the perfect consistency, but the next time I ate a piece it had been in the freezer almost 24 hours and was hard as a rock so I moved it to the refrigerator. It did not get runny at all- it was the perfect consistency. I will definitely make this again!!!!

Excellent!! Hubs was sad when he went for seconds and someone beat him to it.  I used half the suggested amount of Cool Whip and only one quarter cup milk and kept perfectly in the fridge ( rather than freezer).

Love this recipe! This is my go to recipe when I need to bring a dessert somewhere at the last minute. Limited ingredients makes this pie inexpensive and easy to make. I always use a chocolate cookie crust instead of the graham cracker crust and it comes out delicious! I also chop up Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and sprinkle them on top. I love how it makes two pies, so I can take one to an event and have one to keep at home!!

Followed recipe. Which is very limited. Like how long do u freeze for, bc 3 hrs later it was still a bit runny when cut. I don't love this. There is another recipe on here that doesn't use milk and that one is perfect. The taste is good with this one but then again it's all sugar so it's to be expected.

I made this for home and took one to work. Everyone loved it! It is so creamy and yummy, not too sweet. I had some fudge covered oreos in the pantry so I crumbled some up and sprinkled them on top. Yum!

Delicious! I use low fat ingredients and it tastes just the same. I have made variations where I use an oreo cookie crust and crushed oreos on top but to be honest, I think I like it the original way best. This is a great go-to potluck recipe. I have never had anyone complain when I have brought it :)

I halved the recipe to make one pie and instead of traditional graham cracker crust, I used the already prepared chocolate Oreo crust. I also used 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and crumbled them with my food processor. I sprinkled them on the top for a little added crunch. It was delicious! Next time I may shave chocolate onto the top of the pie! Also, I couldn't wait for it to freeze for the first piece, but I must say that I like it better frozen.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Absolutely delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly, except scaled it back to only make one pie, and subbed in light whipped topping and light cream cheese. This pie was AMAZING.  I let it set up in the fridge (didn't really want a frozen dessert) and it turned out beautifully.  The flavor is incredibly rich, and it's really dangerous how easily this pie can be thrown together.  If you're looking for a super yummy dessert that doesn't require baking, this is it.

I LOVE this.  Probably too much! It's so good. I love that I can just store a few in the freezer to bring out when I have unexpected company.  Anyone I've made it for has flipped over it.

I absolutely loved this! (And my husband is a peanut butter fiend, so this got his stamp of approval.)  I will make it again!  I do have a couple of comments to be aware of, though: First of all, I was not able to fit all the filling in the pie crust...later, I noticed another recipe that called for half the peanut butter, and all else was the same.  However, I'm going to make it again with the same proportions because I LOVED how prevalent the peanut butter taste was.  I will probably just make little dessert cups with the excess.  Also, this took more than 2 hours to freeze.  In fact, mine was not totally solid at any point...perhaps another casualty of the deliciously excessive peanut butter.

Yumm, made this pie yesterday for my husbands birthday, everybody went ape crazy over it.  Soo easy to make and I even enjoyed it (not a peanut butter lover), I cut back on the milk and did not freeze it, turned out perfect. If left out too long it will get loose, put back in the fridge to firm it up.  Also, I garnished it with whipped cream, cut up Reese's cups and drizzled the fudge shell over it (the kind you put on ice cream, it's get hard when cold), everyone expects this pie now for all occasions.

This is almost like my recipe, so I tried it.  It was good, but I'll stick with mine: no milk, 12 oz of Cool Whip, and it absolutely needs an Oreo crust.  Drizzle some melted chocolate on top.  I don't freeze it, but do leave in refrigerator several hours before eating or even over night.  I'm requested to bring it to dinners all the time which is great because it's so easy.

I made the refrigerator version of the pie.  My family enjoyed it. The changes I made was add 1/2 cup or  less of milk melted chocolate chips and rubbed it on the bottom of a graham cracker crust. Sense my family loves peanut butter they thought I should add 1/2 cup more of peanut butter next time....will make again

I used some suggestions from others to make it Weight Watchers friendly.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, Splenda(1cup), Simply Jif peanut butter, 1/2 cup skim milk, ad 12 oz. Cool Whip.  I spread the remaining Cool Whip on top and decorated with chopped mini Reese Cups and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.  The result was absolutely delicious!

So easy and so delicious, there is a reason it has a 5 star rating with 1,200+ reviews.  I used all low-fat/sugar ingreidents and it worked fine.  Topped with crush graham crackers, pecans and mini chocholate chips.  Mmmmm.....

Yes, this is truly yummy. I was afraid it would be rock hard but it keeps a nice texture and is best as cold as you can get it! Tastes like peanut butter ice cream...I also used an Oreo piecrust!

much better when frozen - needs more than 2 hours to freeze and we couldn't wait :P.  Very easy to make, I followed recipe exactly.  If I were to make it again, I would decrease the sugar as it is quite sweet for my taste - family still went for seconds though!

Made exactly as said, it is an amazing pie! Very tasty and any peanut butter lover will love it.

Now when I make this pie I take it to the next level: I use a chocolate graham cracker crust, and before pouring in the pie mixture I spread a thin layer of peanut butter on the bottom of the crust. That way when I pop it in the freezer to set, there's a yummy layer of PB on the bottom of the pie! Sometimes I will put chocolate syrup on the bottom, that is good too. 

Also, I use Smucker's All Natural Creamy PB, and it's the BEST with this pie!

Good.  would have liked stronger PB flavor.  will increase PB next time (also used creamy, would have been better with crunchy as recipe states)  Also used Oreo crust.

Per other reviewers I didn't add the milk, used oreo crust and a tad bit more peanut butter.  Strong peanut butter taste. Yummy.

This was awesome!  I had a craving for cheesecake about 1/2 hour ago and I couldn't go out to get anything.  Between making a graham crust from scratch and making the filling, I was finished in 1/2 hour!  I halved all of the ingredients so I would only make one pie, it was a little difficult to mix with the blender the cream cheese and icing sugar because there wasn't alot to mix, but I figured it out.  I now have to wait for it to chill in the freezer, but by licking the bowls I have satisfied my cheesecake craving, and I know I have a delicious pie waiting for me for tomorrow!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I one and halved the recipe to give the pies more height and more fluffy "stuff".  Delicious otherwise and my family's favorite for birthdays instead of cake.

This was so yummy and very easy to make! I "doubled" the recipe amounts to make extra and actually had enough for 3 pies. Everyone really liked it. For my 3rd pie I used vanilla wafers as a crust since I wasn't prepared to make 3!

This pie is amazing!  It will now be a staple on our family's holiday table. I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat peanut butter, skim milk, lite whipped topping, and a reduced fat graham cracker pie crust. Amazingly delicious!!! If you happen to have any leftovers, store these in the refrigerator (not the freezer).

I followed the recipe exactly.  The pie was too sweet and all 5 adults agreed to that and it was lacking on peanut butter flavor.  It was overly sweet and wouldn't make it again.

Very good!  I don't eat Cool Whip so I whipped a pint of heavy whipping cream instead.  Rich and delicious!  I think the plain whipped cream added a richness without it being too sweet which made it really nice.

Wonderful no bake pie. My family loved it. The only thing I did different was to use lite whipped topping and  Oreo crust instead of graham cracker crust. It was rich even then. Really good, and no leftovers!

As all the other reviews state- INCREDIBLE. The top reviewer is right- You should definitely make the nutter butter crust! I put a dash of cinnamon into the crust mix (cause we love cinnamon in my house).  I also add an 1/8 of a tsp of vanilla extract. I only add half of the tub of cool whip into the mix, and reserve the rest for "plastic bag piping" over the top. I keep everything else the same. Pie is to die for.

Also- Used this same recipe with changes for my daughter with a peanut allergy: Used crushed oreos (halved and zapped in food processor) for crust. Omitted the peanut butter, and instead mixed about 4 heaping tbs. unsweetened cocoa powder with 2 tbs. brown sugar, and added to mix with a dash of cinnamon.

WOW! this pie was wonderful (i just hada slice for lunch;)! Although when i was at the store, i only got an 8 oz container of cool whip. i figured 'oh well' and i am sure the extra container wouldve made it creamier, mine is a little more dense. will be making many more!

This PB pie is amazing. I only used about 3/4 of a cup of sugar, low fat cream cheese and frozen topping, and I made an oreo cookie crust. It was so good, we ate it every night for a whole week and was sad that there wasn't any more! I will be making this again soon!

I made this for thanksgiving this year and it was a total hit! Everyone wanted the recipe. I actually "veganized" the recipe switching ingredients and NO ONE knew it was vegan! I used tofutti cream cheese, non dairy milk, and "healthy top" vegan whipped topping. It still tasted great!

This was WONDERFUL.  Cut in 1/2 to make 1 pie only as we had 3 other pies at our Thanksgiving dinner. I wished I had made 2 of these because it was gone almost immediately.  Positively RAVE reviews.  The only change I made was to spread a thin layer of choc. fudge topping on the crust before pouring the pie filling in.  Froze overnight and put in the fridge about 2 hours before eating to thaw slowly.
Wonderful pie.

This was awesome how it is written but this Thanksgiving I wanted only 1 pie since I had so many others.  I made the recipe as it says but I only used half of the Cool Whip.  It made for 1 mounded pie and the peanut butter flavor was way more intense. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I thought this was delicious. Silky smooth and yummy. If I ever make this again, I'll use a chocolate crust instead of graham.
I did change some of the recipe.
I made half for 1 pie, but I still used the entire pack of cream cheese b/c I didn't want to waste it, plus I thought it would give it a creamier texture.
I also used just a little more than half cup of peanut butter, and I used heavy cream instead of milk.

Awesome--this is my absolute favorite peanut butter pie.  This pie is awesome with either a graham cracker crust or an oreo crust.

Absolutely delicious. Made this for parties and had TONS of compliments. Used chunky peanut butter instead, and Cut powered sugar down to just 1 cup since the whip cream is already sweet. Garnished with chopped peanuts and once frozen, drizzled with hot fudge and refrozen.

I wish I could give this 10 stars. Words can not describe how delicious this is. I used an Oreo cookie crust and smeared hot fudge all over the pie crust before putting in the filling. I also used fat-free cool whip because it was all I had. Rave reviews from everyone!! Next time, I'm going to try a layer of hot fudge, a layer of caramel, a sprinkle of peanuts adn then the peanut butter mixture so it resembles a snickers. Delicious as originally made, but I can't wait to try those that version.

It was good! Easy to make, even without a Kitchen Aid machine - I don't have anything "Kitchen Aid spiffy" all I have is arm power and that worked fine. It tastes like a super creamy Reese's Pieces =]

This pie was amazing, I made it for some friends and we gobbled it up instantly. It was really rich and creamy, it's best if you let it freeze overnight, four hours isn't enough, and trust me this is way more amazing when it is frozen!!!

A must for the peanut butter lovers! Simple and easy to make.  I followed the directions as stated and came out perfectly.  I did, however, have some chocolate teddy grahams I crushed up and sprinkled on top to make it look pretty. (All I had on hand)  All in all, superb pie!

Amazing! I took others advice and used a chocolate crust also. The pie was very rich and sweet but still VERY good. I topped with crushed Heath. I think next time I will cut down on the amount of sugar and use splenda instead.

I bake a lot and this is my fiance's absolute FAVORITE. This is now on the top of his request list for any event. I definitely modified the recipe to suit our tastes: 2/3 of the tub of whipped topping, 1 cup powdered sugar, 2/3 cup creamy peanut butter, 2/3 cup crunchy peanut butter, 1/2 cup milk, 8 oz cream cheese. It made just over 1 pie so I spooned the rest into chocolate lined cupcake liners. The small ones were like homemade reese's! I will definitely try an entire batch of just the cupcake/reese's style with melted chocolate on top.

I made this pie, then was invited to a party nearby.  I didn't have anything to make, so I took the pie - I put my trust into all the great reviews.  I halved the recipe and definitely didn't even need to use the whole container of cool whip (smaller container), I think it all depends on the consistency you want.

We didn't end up eating it that night.  They called me  yesterday and said they had a confession.  They had planned on saving a piece for me, but it was so good they ate the whole thing.  I was told I either had to move in and make it once a week or was going to have to give them the recipe.

I was able to save a bit of the filling and we did try that and it was divine.  You can definitely customize this for your taste easily. Less cool whip, more or less peanut butter.  One of the people that ate the pie, hates peanut butter, but loved the pie.  

Next time, I will add a bit less cool whip, then will drizzle with some chocolate or might at the crushed up chocolate sandwich cookies.

Made one addition--a box of instant, sugar free chocolate pudding.   The recipe calls for a graham cracker crust, but I used an Oreo crust.  My husband said this is definitely a "DO AGAIN!".

Sooooo GOOD!!! And easy to make, I used a graham cracker crust and a chocolate cookie crust for the second pie. The texture of the pie filling remind me of  ice cream a little bit and it was sweet but not but not too sweet. I'm so happy I found this recipe, I dont need to go to the restaurant anymore to get delicious peanut butter pie :)

THis pie is the BOMB.  I made one for my son and sent it to the Fire dept he was working at.  it only took about 20 min for the guys to ask how often I'd make it if they bought the stuff.  you cant go wrong mix it just as directed.

I made this pie for the first time and entered it in a Pie contest and I WON first place !!!! I beat out several really great bakers !! I won a great prize !!
 I did use a lot less cool whip than the recipe called for. I used a oreo store bought crust and crushed up a few oreos on top.

Very rich, excellent pie.  I follow directions and this is always a hit.  If serving to company I make 3/4 of the recipe and pile it high into one crust for a very nice restaurant proportion pie.  For casual serving the filling is enough for 2 pies. Enjoy.

I have made this pie for 3 parties already and everyone has asked for the recipe! I like it because it is simple and quick. I've added PB M&Ms or some reese cups on the top looks, but think the cake is perfect as is.

I've gotten rave reviews both times I've made this recipe.  Most recently made for out-of-state guests.  They looked quite skeptical when I said we had peanut butter pie for dessert.  After the first bite, the sketicism was replaced with "make sure we get this recipe!"  I drizzled some Hershey's syrup over the top, but the other suggestions of an Orea crust or peanut butter cups on top would be awesome, too.  Also, I used light cream cheese and whipped topping and 1% milk - still rich and delicious without the extra calories.

For added yummy-ness, drizzle a little chocolate syrup on top. I usually set a bottle near the pie so guests can add as much or as little as they want.

I misplaced my recipe I normally make & this one is pretty close to it... I only made half serving size but kept the cream cheese to 1 package instead of half. & I didn't add the milk. I saved some of the whipped topping to add to the finished top & then drizzled it w/chocolate & caramel syrups :) YUM!

Yummy! I used the lower fat/less sugar versions described in other reviews.  Poured into two chocolate wafer crusts. Took both pies to church luncheon.  Not a crumb was left.

Yummy!!! The only thing I did differently was put it into a chocolate pie crust just because I love that peanut butter/chocolate combination.  I should mention though that I used 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese, light whipped topping, and skim milk to reduce calories and it was fabulous this way!! I also only made one pie since there was only me and my boyfriend eating it.  I would recommend waiting longer than the time listed though.  I made the pie two days ago and it's so much better today because it's more firm.  Soooooooo good!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow! So rich but so good!. I donate baked goods for the local senior centers monthly spaghetti dinners and they loved it. I did layer each of the crusts with a thin layer of hot fudge sauce (as if it weren't rich enough) and I did use the recipe from the reviewer for the Nutter Butter Cookie Crust.

This is the best peanut butter recipe, and I don't even like peanut butter(mainly I don't like the texture and the taste is too pea-nutty for me), but my family does and family and friends are the reason I love to cook.  I have made this several times and every time, I was asked for the recipe.  Even I like it, it's not too sweet, but sweet enough and light as well.  It's so fast and easy to make, the prep time of 20 minutes that the recipe states is too generous.  Five minutes is plenty.  Simply delicious.

Needed a dessert for a summer party and I did not want to turn on the oven. Very simple to make. Used a graham cracker crust and topped with PB cups. Tasted good but, not my favorite pie in the world. I think it would be a huge hit with kids though!

This was a very good dessert. I used one oreo pie crust, one tub (8oz) of light cool whip, 8oz reduced fat cream cheese, 1c powdered sugar, 1-1/12c peanut butter, and I added broken reese's cups and chocolate chips to the pie. My chocolate loving brother and grandfather raved over it!

This is very sweet but very good. I made my own graham cracker crust and topped the finished pie with crumbled Reeses Pnut butter cups and Hershey's chocolate syrup. it's also really good with chopped peanuts. Tastes just like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup!! My husband and nephew loved it.

Super easy to make, and tastes great! What more could you want? Great peanut butter taste. Easy recipe to alter with your own favorites like chopped mini peanut butter cups, m & m's,  chopped nuts, oreos etc can make great decorative toppings.

So, I LOVE peanut butter!  I took the advice about the nutter butter cook crust.  I used the whole package and a stick of butter and a 9 x 13 inch pan.  I made the peanut butter filing as directed and found it didn't really taste much; let alone taste like peanut butter.  So, I melted 2 cups of peanut butter and put it in the bottom and then had some chocolate which I melted and put over the peanut butter.  I put the whole thing in the fridge to cool and then put the peanut butter filing in . . . YUMMY.

Everyon loved this recipe!!  I loved it too.  Very easy and delicious.  I also followed some advice and used a predone chocolate crrumb base.  I mixed cut up peanut butter cups into the filling.  On one pie I topped with grated Crispy Crunch (like Skor bar), and on the other more cut up peanut butter cups...both were excellent.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very good. I took another reviewers suggestion and used the nuttter butter crust. Also didnt use a whole 16 ounce tub of cool whip, only used half of that. Very good recipe once again, and will be making again! Thanks!

Great, easy recipe. The great thing is that you can got LITE on almost all the ingredients (fat free cream cheese, low fat peanut butter, skim milk, whipped topping) and it STILL tastes great! thanks for the recipe!

Oh my.. this is a keeper!  I took this to a church eating and everyone raved about it.   Several asked me for the recipe.  The entire pie was GONE in minutes!  I will make 2 the next time.  I am not a big peanut butter fan so it is just the right amount.  Very creamy!

Very rich! Perfect for a special occasion.  I ended up being a little short on whip cream so I used extra cream cheese.  I cut up mini peanut butter cups and mixed them into the pie and also used them and chopped peanuts to decorate.  It was perfect for my husbands birthday.

A no fuss frozen treat.  I will try using real whipped cream next time as I don't like to use "edible oil products".  I hope it will still turn out.   Update Sept. 2010, I just tried this with real whipped cream and it is even better.

I made the pies according to the recipe.  I did chop up some Reese Cups and set out if anyone wanted to garnish their pie with them.  Also, had chocolate syrup if anyone wanted that, too.  If you like peanut butter you can't go wrong with this recipe.  I will make this again & again & again!

Amazing pie! The only thing I did wrong was I didn't keep it in the freezer long enough so it fell apart a little but it was awesome!  Make sure you freeze it for at least a couple hrs. before serving.

This pie was great and definately easy! I'm fifteen, so I'm not going to spend a bunch of time to make some elaborate pie, I'm patient, but to an extent, so when I found this I automatically thought, 'I love peanut butter, and this looks easy!'. So I made two pies, I kept one at home for my family and I, and then I took one to my friend Sarah's sweet sixteen party. I got great compliments on the pie and it was more than half gone when I had to leave a little early. If you're looking for a quick-fix pie with great taste, this is the pie for you!

I love this pie but I use chocolate crumb crusts.  To make it special, I drizzle the top back and forth with chocolate syrup.  Then go across back and forth with a toothpick to make a pretty design.  The first time I served it to my husband he kept asking me where I had bought it and didn't believe I had made it.

Delicious!!!  My only "complaint" is that it was WAY too rich for me.  I cut it in 8 pieces and at least half of us could not finish our piece.  I made an oreo crust with 35 oreos and 5T. melted butter which filled my large pie plate and one of my small pie plates.  I froze the crust for 30 minutes then spread a thin layer of hot fudge on the crust and then used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and lite cool whip, using only 12oz...and it was still so very rich.  I topped the pie with chopped up peanut butter cups and drizzled chocolate syrup.  The flavor was wonderful, but next time I will play around with it to decrease some of the richness.  I also would love to add more chocolate somehow, to have a good chocolate/pb combo instead of such a strong pb flavor...but that's just personal preference!  EDIT:  I have officially perfected this recipe for both flavor and richness.  I now do an Oreo crust that I bake, which molds it together better.  I lessened the sugar (1/2c. for the 8 serving ratio), used natural PB (JIF is my favorite PB but was WAY too sweet for this.  Smuckers Natural was perfect!)  And I halved the whipped topping and added 3 diced PB cups into the pie and topped the pie with another 3 diced PB cups.  This was truly restaurant quality!

This turned out very yummy! The whole family loved it ! Takes a long time to set though...as to be expected with this type of pie. I used 2 packets of Dream Whip instead of cool whip.

Oh wow this was definitely 5 stars not only because it was so  good but it was also so easy to make.  My only advice is to add some chocolate in the recipe.  I added chocolate sauce to the top. PERFECT!!  I also made my own graham cracker crust so that I could make just one large pie instead of 2 small.  My moms birthday is tomorrow so I will be making another for her.

I used a graham cracker crust (store bought) and felt like it was missing something...I think I'll try the nutterbutter cookie tip next time & add a layer of fudge topping to the bottom??  The filling was delicious as is!

Served this at a birthday party along with the cake and cupcakes, and this was demolished, while the others barely got touched. I followed other reviews and added melted chocolate chips onto the crust, which was nice, but really, really hard to cut. Next time I will add a tiny bit of crisco to the chocolate, so it has more of a consistency of the chocolate on chocolate covered strawberries (cutable) and all the flavor. Thanks for the recipe- it is a new hit at our house!

Awesome!  Made exactly as instructed & decorated the top with Oreos.  It was so easy to make that my 5-year-old son helped me & he had a great time.  What a delicious dessert!

My husband and I threw this together when I got home from work. What a fun and easy couple creation. Anyway, we pretty much followed the recipe until my pie shell shattered! So then we heated up some hot fudge topping and put that in the bottom of some individual serving cups. Then followed with the filling and sprinkled with the graham cracker crumbs from the crust. It's in the fridge now, but the tastes we snuck were pretty darn good. YUM! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the second time I have made this and the first time was amazing.  They are in the freezer now so I will have to chime in later to give the results because I used splenda instead of sugar in this batch.  I also used one chocolate crust and one graham cracker crust and neufchatel cheese instead of reg cream cheese.  My kids said the beaters were amazing so we shall see!!  Taking them to an end of summer bbq tonight.

This is super easy and SO GOOD. I seriously cannot tell you how YUMMY this pie is. It's pretty rich, so you can cut smaller slices and still be satisfied. I cut mine into 8 pieces and that was perfect.

I loved it, and so did our guests and kids.  I tried it with an oreo crust, and graham cracker crust.  I highly recommend the graham cracker crust, as the other just leaves you wondering what that flavor combination is as you eat it.

This pie was a big hit.  The only thing I did different was to drizzle "Hard Shell" ice cream topping on top before putting it into the freezer.  It added just the right amount of chocolate.

This is DELICIOUS! I used about 1/2 cup extra of peanut butter, and the smaller size container of cool whip. I used two store bought chocolate graham cracker crusts. I also crushed up some oreos and sprinkled them on top before freezing! SO GOOD! If you LOVE peanut butter (like I do) this is totally the perfect dessert!

Excellent with adjustments. I made an Oreo crust and it worked well. I also used 1.5 cups of peanut butter and only a 12 oz. (tub and a half) of whipped topping. Not too much for two pies then, and very peanut buttery!

This pie is amazing!  I do change it up a little bit though.  I like to add PB cups [crushed] and more PB.  Everyone that has tried it has raved on and on about this pie, it's steadily becoming a favorite get-together dish :3  Btw!  If anyone has any problems finding a pie crust, get a box of chocolate Teddy Grahams and crush them to a fine powder, melt 6 tbsp of butter and mix together; pack that into your pie plate and voila!  Delicious, perfect crust!

This is a good pie and very easy to make but I think it calls for less cool whip,my thoughts,you can try it how you want to.

Yummmy!! I used lowfat graham crusts, lowfat cream cheese, fat free cool whip, lowfat peanut butter and instead of confectioner's sugar I use splenda! Sounds gross but not ONE person knew they were eating lowfat when I made it, it was amazing!!

Easy & delicious. Followed the recipe and added some chopped up Reese's Peanut Butter cups to the filling. Sprinkled some Reese's pieces on the top and put in freezer.  I made 1 using an oreo crust and 1 using a graham cracker crust. I served the 1 with the oreo crust, the other is still in the freezer. Drizzled some hot fudge sauce over each slice as I was serving them. Every one said it was very good. Will probably try the Nutter Butter Crust as suggested by another reviewer next time even though the oreo crust was great with it. Will definitely make this again.

This was fabulous.  I used shortbread crusts instead of graham cracker.  I made my own whipping cream using 16 oz. of heavy cream and about 1/2 cup of sugar (beaten on high until peaks form).  I also took another reviewer's advice and chopped up about 1/2 bag of Reese's peanut butter cups and folded them at the end.  Both pies disappeared in one day!!

I had never tried peanut butter pie before, just didn't sound good to me. However, I was looking for something easy, cool, and different and tried this recipe. It is wonderful! My husband kind of turned his nose up when I said peanut butter pie, but I got him to try a bite of mine and he immediately went to the freezer to get his own. I usually make two of all desserts and take one to my daughter; hubby saw the second pie and said "You're not taking the other one to Brandi are you?". So, I had to make two more! My son and his GF took a piece to the hospital where her mom is a nurse, and she and her friend were "fork-fighting" over the last bite! Son came home with a request for a whole pie to take to them. I made two more and sent one to the hospital. He came home and gave me $20 that the friend insisted I take. I gave him the other pie to take to her! Thanks for the fabulous recipe. Oh, the only change I made was to use a Nutter Butter crust that another reviewer  suggested.

This is out of this world!!  I followed another reviewer who made a nutter butter crust, 24 nutter butter cookies crushed & mixed with 5 T melted butter, pressed into the bottom of a pie pan.  I also omitted the milk and used 8 oz cream cheese, 1 c. confectioners sugar, 3/4 tub cool whip, 1 T vanilla and 1 c peanut butter.  It was AMAZING!  I actually froze it and 2 days later pulled it out and was able to cut it right from the freezer.  I didn't even let my piece thaw before I ate it but it would be convenient if you wanted to just store it in the freezer and thaw/serve each piece as needed.  I will definitely make this again.

This was gone like ten minutes after I served it! I only made 1 pie, but the only thing I halved was the amount of whipped topping, and I decreased the milk to 1 tbsp. I kept the amounts of everything else the same. I topped it with a bunch of chopped peanut butter cups (hint: they chop easier if you refigerate them first), and tossed it in the freezer for only about an hour. It was definitely rich, but totally delicious.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make pie! I have a large Peanut Butter loving family and I made this pie for desert for Christmas and it was a huge hit. My family is begging me to make it for desert for our Easter dinner.  I did add a few things to this recipe however and I think that made it an even bigger hit.  What I did was took three regular sized Reeses Peanut Butter Cups and put them in a food chopper.  I then sprinkled the Peanut Butter Cup pieces over the top of the pie and then I added a swirl of Hershey's Chocolate milk syrup for added looks and taste.  It was mouth watering delicious!

Delicious! I also added peanut butter cups. I used 1 cup of the mini peanut butter cups. I chopped each one into quaters and then mixed them in with the filling before pouring it into the pie shell. I saved 6 whole peanut butter cups and decorated the top of the pie with them.

I brought this to a party.  It was good but kind of soupy.  It had partially thawed on the ride to the party so I kept it in the fridge for several hours before dessert was served, but it was still mushy and messy and sliding around in the pie dish.  I think a little more peanut butter would be good also to give it a little more pb taste.  But over all it had nice flavor.

Now this is good. I made the crust homemade and kept alittle crumb mixture to sprinkle on top. Also one peanut butter cup chopped for top adds a big show and flavor booster.

This pie is SOOOO FREAKING GOOD!!! I cut the recipe in half, as I only needed one pie and made some alternations: I used the oreo pie crust (absolutely the best!), and only used 1/2 the whip cream, and added just a little extra scoop of peanut butter then called for. I topped it with reese cups and drissled fudge sauce on the top of the crust and the bottom of the crust too. I froze this pie and it was just incredible.

This was absolutely divine!  I only made one pie and found the filling to be plenty for it. I only used 1/4 cup of milk and 1 - 8 oz container of whipped topping.  I drizzled the top with chocolate syrup and sprinkled some chopped up peanut butter cups on top.  I used a regular graham cracker crust, but I think it would be really good with a chocolate cookie crust.  Kept it in the fridge for about an hour before serving and it was nice and fluffy!  Excellent recipe!

This pie was awesome! I used reduced fat peanut butter, lite cream cheese and lite cool whip. Used both things of cool whip to make it super creamy and also crushed up two Butterfinger bars and put inside of it. Was great!

This turned out really well.  I had to halve the recipe since I was making this for just two people.  I decided to follow the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of peanut butter, used a little less cool whip, and used an Oreo crust.  I used nearly 1c. of PB in my half-recipe, but i think it actually still could have had more (I think this is due more to personal preference, though).  I also crushed some Oreos over the top of the pie before freezing; this was a nice touch, but I think it will taste even better if I stir them into the PB mixture next time.  As I come from a household of PB lovers - I will make this again!  Thanks!

My family loved this dessert! I followed the suggestions of others reviewers and cut back on the the Cool Whip and milk, but added 1/4 cup more of peanut butter. I also used chocolate cookie crumbs and drizzled chocolate sauce. This is definitely a do over!

I made this once over the summer, and once for one of our Thanksgiving desserts. The one I made in the summer, I listened to previous reviewers and didn't use all the required cool whip. It was frozen solid and hard to cut. The last one I made, I did use all the cool whip and it was much easier to cut and a creamier pie. I would definately be sure to use all 16 oz of cool whip. We all loved this in chocolate crust with Dove chocolate sauce on top. Delicious!

This recipe is delicious.  For a little variety I layer mine crushed choc. graham cracker crust, peanut butter filling, more crushed grahams and then the remaining filling.  Then I top it all off with chopped up peanut butter cups...sooooo good!  I make the recipe exactly as called for but leave out half the cool whip, this makes it perfect for a large dish (an oversized pie dish is perfect), just scoop it out by the spoonful.

I made this pie directly like the recipe stated, except for one thing: I only used 8oz of whipped cream instead of 16oz. It turned out perfect! Crumbling the Reese's on top is definitely an added bonus. YUM!

This recipe was a big hit at my son's confirmation party.  I added chopped reeses peanut butter cup and drizzled chocolate syrup on top. Looked as good as it tasted. Everyone loved it. I have had many requests to make it again.

So easy and soooo DELICIOUS!  I did one graham cracker crust and one chocolate crust.  I chopped peanut butter cups and sprinkled over the crusts before I added the filling.  The only change was that I am a huge fan of fresh whipped cream opposed to the cool whip (2 cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup conf sugar and a squirt of vanilla-whip for 5 minutes or until hard peaks form.)so that is what I used-reserving some to pipe on top of the pies once completed.  I also sprinkled some reeses pieces on the tops for some color and decoration.  WIll make over and over and over again.  YUM!

This was excellent - not too peanut butter-y.  I used nonfat milk, cream cheese, and Cool Whip to lighten things up a bit.

WOW! Very rich and yummy and peanut-buttery! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was so sloppy and messy - like yummy peanut butter pudding. The second time, I left out the milk and it held together much better. This really needs to chill for a few hours to actually hold together. Yum! So easy! I like to use a homemade chocolate graham cracker crust or Nutter Butter crust. :) I also reccomend leaving out the sugar, since all the ingredients contain sugar and it's very very sweet (especially with a Nutter Butter Crust). To garnish: peanut butter chips, chopped chocolate chips, chopped peanut butter cups, chocolate syrup, etc. Delish!

Instead of making 2 pies, I made an oreo cookie crust in a 9x13 pan.  Sprinkled top with crumbled Reeces peanut butter cups.  Next time will add a layer of fudge sauce over crumbs before adding mixture.  Thanks for sharing!

This is so good. It tastes better if you refrigerate for 24 hours before eating. I used Smart Balance peanut butter, low fat cream cheese, soy milk and fresh whipped cream. I know that still doesn't make this recipe healthy but the little things add up. Also I used chocolate graham crackers to make my own crust. It turned out great.

This pie was a great hit!  Not too much peanut butter taste--it was perfect.  I took the suggestions of some other members, and omitted the milk.  I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and only used an 8 oz tub of Cool Whip.  It froze up faster and stayed together better.

Incredible!! It's my boyfriends favorite pie! I can never try to make another pie because whenever I do, he begs for this one! I guess I'll never be able to make another apple or peach pie again! lol Here's what I did:
The top was way too boring, so I drizzled peanut butter over it and chopped up reeses cups. Sometimes I'll even through a few choc chips on top too. For anyone who eats healthy, I only use natural peanut butter and it takes great! Try it, you'll love it!

I used the larger-sized graham cracker crust, and I put Reese's Magic Shell topping in the crust. At HEB I found some chocolate-covered peanut butter cookies for only 98 cents/pkg. I chopped up 6 cookies and put them on top of the Magic Shell, then filled with the topping. I used 1/4 c more peanut butter and about 3/4 of a 12-oz tub of cool whip. After I put the filling in, I sprayed a whipped cream edge and sprinkled with 1/2c peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips. My peanut-butter-holic husband RAVED over this one, but be warned, it's really rich, and you should cut the slices small, maybe 1" at the crust. Enjoy! I'm keeping this one.

ok - so there's like 300 reviews for this - do you want to know why?? It's easy, tasty and something different.  You don't have to be a peanut butter fanatic to like this recipe.  It makes 2, so you'll take one to a function - it will get gobbled up, but that's ok - you know you have another one at home all for yourself!!!

This was just ok.   It actually tasted like something prepared commercially (like off-brand ice cream).  Not enough peanut butter flavor.   Can't put my finger on it, but it just didn't do it for us!

Very good and easy. I had bought a 12oz cool whip instead of a 16 oz and I actually think it worked out better than a larger one would have. Very good. Can't tell if I like it better frozen or just refrigerated??? Definately mix in some chopped up reese's peanut butter cups.

I made this for a party i was having the other day and all those who tried it, loved it.  There were 2 things i did differently though and i highly recommend them for those who like the chocolate/peanut butter combo: 1- I used an oreo crust.  (homemade or store bought, doesn't matter) & 2- I used double chocolate milk instead of regular milk.  The chocolate milk isn't overwhelming, but it adds a little something extra.

I took this to a potluck and everyone raved about it! I had many requests for the recipe/to make again. 
Perfect for a hot summer day both as a cool treat and the fact that it's no bake. It was SO EASY to make! The only addition I made was to cut up two peanut butter cups to decorate the top with. I did use a tad less whipped topping than the recipe called for too.
A keeper for sure! 5 stars for ease of preparation and final product.

You can't lose with this recipe!!  A crowd pleaser for sure!  I used Oreo premade crusts and added a layer of fudge to the crust.  I also add a tablespoon of vanilla to the peanut butter mixture which seemed to "heighten" and freshen up the flavor.  I garnished with more fudge and Reese cups.  Everything else I followed per the recipe and it turned out wonderful!

This is YUMMY and easy!  I'm not a big fan of cream cheesy tasting PB pies, so I double the PB.  Sometimes, I'll crush either Oreos or Snickers bars to mix ino the fillings and serve in an Oreo crust.  When I leave it plain PB filling, I prefer a Nilla wafer crust.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! If you love peanut butter, this is a great recipe!  I followed other posters' advice and used an oreo crumb crust.  I also put a thin layer of fudge topping on the crust with 2 chopped up peanut butter cups.  I drizzled more fudge topping on top of the pie and sprinkled it with one chopped peanut butter cup and a few chopped, unsalted peanuts.  (To ease the guilt a little, I used light whipped topping and light cream cheese.)  It looked impressive and tasted great!

Amazingly Decadent! I'm not a huge peanut butter fan but love Reese's. So I put this in a chocolate graham cracker crust, topped with a thin layer of hot fudge sauce and added the filling. On top I added a few drizzles of Hersheyls chocolate syrup, took a toothpick and made swirls all over. It was very pretty. When serving I drizzed the chocolate syrup over the pie and onto the plate, added whipped cream and topped with chopped Reese's cups.  This was for my hubby's bd and he thought I bought it so did my son. I didn't think I would like it but it was so amazing. I agree with others, I didn't expect it to be so good frozen but it was so cream and rich. One small slice is enough! Enjoy!!!

I liked this recipe but found it to be a little too soft.  Next time I will try the 12 oz package of whipped topping instead.  It was the best with an oreo crust (I tried the nutter butter crust as well), dessert fudge on the bottom of the pie and with some of it drizzled over the top.  Then I froze some peanut butter cups and crushed them up to sprinkle on top as well.

This is fabulous made exactly as is, except I use a deep dish chocolate crust and make one giant pie. It is a showstopper garnished with mini peanut butter cups or peanut butter filled hershey kisses. Is perfect for a potluck!

Scrumptious. I made my own crust with inexpensive oreo type cookies, adding a Tbs. of butter, pressing it into one 9 1/2" pie dish and baking the crust for 8 min.  For the filling, I used 1 1/2 C. natural peanut butter with the oil drained off, and reduced the whipped topping by 1 Cup.  I diced up 3 Reeses PB cups on top of the crust before adding the filling, and decorated with chunks of additional Reeses cups.  It was quite full, but I prefer it full and luscious like that.   Don't hesitate to try this. It's off the charts!

Excellent recipe. Thank you. Divided the recipe in 2 for 1 pie only. Added a little more peanut butter as per reviewers. To do if you wish to have a strong PB taste, otherwise stated amount would be good. Use 1/3 fat cream cheese. Used Graham Cracker Crust I from this site. Omitted the cinnamon. The crust was too thick for this recipe. Froze overnight. Make sure to take pie out 30 min before serving for optimal results.

Really delicious and easy.  Would definitely make this again.  Ready to eat right out of the freezer.  Made the mistake of letting it sit for a while before serving and it became a bit mushy.  Also definitely use the oreo pie crust.

This was good, I would use a little less than the whole container of Cool Whip.  Also, seems to turn to mush if allowed to defrost.

An absolute favorite and very easy.  The last time I took it to a dinner, people wondered where I had bought it.  I like to put a layer of butterscotch sauce over the graham crust before putting the peanut butter mixture in. Also, I juse all low fat ingredients.  Fantastic!

My fiance LOVES peanut better, so when I saw this I had to try it and I'm glad I did!!  Very easy, but great taste!  I made half a batch since it's just the two of us.  I used Lite cool whip and Reeses peanut better.  I put a layer of hotfudge on the crust before the peanut better filling as per another's suggestion and it was great!!  Only thing I might change is next time cut back on the sugar just a little.  Thanks for the great treat!!

Loved it!  Made it for my husband's coworkers who all are working in this July heat and it was a instant hit.  Made a few changes:  Chocolate graham crust, added a layer of melted canned fudge icing that I had left in the fridge to the middle of the pie (1/2 PB in the crust, fudge, 1/2 the PB) and crushed chocolate candies on top.  I'm sure that hot fudge topping or hershey's syrup could be substituted for the icing.

Oh my, delish! This tastes like restaurant quality!  I followed the recipe exactly but using all low fat ingredients (lite whipped cream, pie crust, pb, cream cheese), and it was heavenly!  The frozen texture is like that of ice cream. I drizzled some Hershey's syrup on top, and it was beautiful and tasted gourmet. Next time I might add just a little extra pb (1/4 cup). Hubby and I love this, and it will keep a long time in the freezer (not that we'll let it sit there very long!) Ally

Excellent and EASY!  I did add an extra scoop of peanut butter (about 1/4 cup) after mixing it up and it still wasn't overly rich, but just delicious.  Used the kitchen aid mixer and pre made oreo pie crust and graham cracker crust - next time I will put it all in one pie crust for that restaruant style presentation - I drizzeled the top with Hershey's syrup.

Everyone loved it... although i'm not a peanutbutter person myself :o) - Thanx!
Since I was trying it for the first time, I only made half a recipe (which calls for a 3/4 cup of sugar) however I lowered the sugar to a 1/2 cup instead. I also used a crushed oreo cookie base which is quite sweet by itself, so I'll consider lowering the sugar a 'lil more next time around... Yes! There IS going to be a 'next time' - Thanx again! :o)

I chose this recipe because of its ratings, but it was not at all what i expected a PEANUT BUTTER PIE to be like. It needs MORE peanut butter and actually would have tasted more like a peanut butter pie without the whipped cream added in. This is what I will do next time. Also, adding a layer of fudge on the bottom make it great too!

This was so yummy! I made a mistake that actually turned out delicious. I had put the filling in a oreo cookie pie crust. I had forgotten to mix in the whipped cream, and so I tried to pour the filling back into the bowl. Of course the whole thing including the crust went into the bowl. I ended up mixing the oreo crust into the pie filling and then pouring it back into the pie pan. It turned out fabulous! Everyone raved about my oreo peanut butter pie! I think that next time I make it I will just crush up oreos and add it to the filling. Delicious!

This was a very very good pie, needless to say I didn't realise until after the pie was in freezer that I didn't mix in the cool whip. So I just added it to the top. It was good to the last drop. Thanks for such a great recipe. My family loved it!!!

LOVE this!! As some others did, I used creamy pb (though on sandwiches I prefer crunchy - I love how smooth this was!) on a chocolate crust. Simply sprinkled chocolate chips on top and froze - looks great, tastes better, and SO simple with ingredients already on hand! THANK YOU!!**update as of 3/18 - made again, using crunchy pb, chopped reese's pb cups in the batter, lite cool-whip on top and sprinkled w/more chopped pb cups and drizzled with chocolate sundae sauce - all made in a Nutter Butter crust made as one reviewer suggested (had to add an extra T. of butter to make it stick together.) Phenomenal. Crazy phenomenal! Tastes all the more "homemade" with the NB crust - w/that and the double layer look w/ccol-whip, my F-I-L thought I bought it at some fancy bakery : )Have to let sit out a bit longer to cut, as the crust is thick but fabulous! My daughter went crazy over this.

Five Stars all the way. All 6 people in my house LOVE this. We like to put these in individual grahm cracker cups and just put in the fridge. Makes for a perfect after dinner treat. Nice and light on the belly. I could eat the whole pie. Which is both a good and bad thing ;)

After spooning in half of the mixture, I sprinkle in several chopped Reece's cups and then cover with the remaining mixture. Then I cut 2-3 Reece's cups into wedges and place them decoratively on top. This is a GREAT dessert-- everytime I make it, someone asks for the recipe.

This was pretty good, definitely needed chocolate sauce, will put it on the crust and then pour filling ontop next time- as spreading it on the top made it look like a mess.

This was excellent and SO easy! I even misread the recipe and made it with frozen cool whip and it came out just fine.  I also used the Oreo cookie pie crust and added chopped Reeses cups on top. A++

It was very simple to make, and it was mighty tasty. I am not crazy over peanut butter, but my boyfriend is. He loved the pie, and his roomates liked it too. It was pretty rich, yet light, fluffy, creamy, and just had the perfect peanutty flavor to it. I used an oreo pie crust and topped it off with milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. I also used the Cool Whip Extra Creamy topping and it was just perfect. Thanks!

I took longer to make than it did to disappear.

I thought this pie was great, and extremely easy to make.  I put chocolate sauce on the bottom, and used a chocolate graham cracker crust.  I accidently bought the 8 oz container of Cool Whip, instead of the 16 oz but it still tasted great!

This was yummy. I added chopped peanut butter cups to the top, and a little extra peanut butter in the pie. Make sure to let it set for the whole time or it will be too soft. Excellent, and easy.

I used a chocolate crust and used chocolate syrup to make a design on top of the pies, thus making a peanut butter cup pie.  I took one pie to work and left one at home for my husband.  It was a huge hit!

This was awesome!!  My whole family loved it.  I covered one with mini marshmallows and milk choc. chips, and drizzled choc sauce, and the other, I put marshmallows an inch from the crust and covered the middle with the choc chips and again the drizzled choc sauce and both were poured into the choc crusts.  Yummy yummy yummy!!!  These were amazing.  I am making them again for Thanksgiving and Xmas dinners.

I am just learning to cook, and this recipe was sooo...easy!  I only used 3/4 of the whipped cream and added 1/4 cup more peanut butter.  I put it in individual graham cracker cups for easy eating at work, and garnished with sliced almonds.  It tastes terrific and everyone really enjoyed it a lot.  I plan on using a chocolate graham cracker crust next time for a reese's PB cup taste.

This was delicious!  I added one bag of halved mini Reese's in the mixture and used an Oreo cookie crust (2).  I drizzled chocolate syrup on the top with a couple Reese's for decoration.  it definitely was soft not long after taking it out.  I'm going to try skipping the milk next time.  My family is already asking for it again!

This was really yummy! Only thing I changed was adding almost half of the “cool whip” that the recipe called for. It would have been a whipped cream pie otherwise.  Also drizzled chocolate along the top. Worth waiting for it to be completely frozen before eating.

Huge hit! Made this s few times now. We are huge peanut butter fans so I added lots.  I used an Oreo crust. Then I sprinkle a mix of peanut butter and milk chocolate chips on top & drizzle  with chocolate syrup. I froze until ready to serve. Makes 2 so if I don’t need both the other freezes well until I need a quick dessert for something.

Surprised at how good this was. This is a recipe I would ordinarily never make (I'm not one to use a store-made crust or cool whip in a pie), but my granddaughter wanted something like this for her birthday and I gave it a try. It could not have been more easy or tasted better. I drizzled chocolate syrup over the top. I do recommend letting it freeze for several hours -- or at least until it's firm. It's not nearly as good when it's not frozen. Also, I used 2 10-inch prepared graham cracker crusts -- house brand that I picked up at Walmart.

This is a great pie and it's easy to make.
I made these modifications to the half (one of the two 9") that most people favored: I used an Oreo pie crust rather than graham cracker; I added some chocolate chips in the filling; we had some fudge (the kind you put on ice cream) so I smothered it on top; it was served with whipped cream. Delicious.

I made this recipe but I altered it a tiny bit because a birthday recipient requested a Heath Bar peanut butter pie. I omitted the milk and added half a bag of Heath pieces into the mix, then sprinkled the remaining on top, then drizzled Torani caramel syrup on top. I also used extra creamy Cool Whip.  It was a huge hit.  I almost didn't get to have a piece for myself!  I've made the original recipe as noted and it is also 5 star delicious. Thank you to the cook who shared it!  My nieces and nephews request this recipe at every family gathering!

Well i was trying to pick a photo and they all ended up on. I'm new...
Excellent! 
I meant to follow the exact recipe except crust..
I made my own thick graham cracker crust and put it all in one 10’ deep dish pie crust!
I came home and only had the 8 oz container of whipped cream. 
It still turned out perfect! 
After baking my crust I put dark chocolate chips in the bottom while warm. 
After that cooled I spooned the filling in put it in the freezer for about 2 hours. 
Topped mine with left over crushed mint/chocolate cookies, drizzled milk chocolate syrup on and a couple shots of ready whip! 
Perfect for any occasion, stores easily in fridge/freezer!
I’m glad I read that it would melt!  Stored like a dream in the fridge however and I still have about ½ the pie frozen!

Addictive. Not sure what else to say. The filling is like a reece's pieces but its fluff and goes great with graham cracker crust (just make one its really not that hard). Simple recipe with crazy good results. I used crunchy peanut butter and didn't even notice the nuts, or that I was practically inhaling the pie. Awesome awesome awesome pie! As a note, if you think freeze until firm means leave it in there like I did, it doesn't. If you need to store a while sure. But you must thaw it like a normal frozen pie to cut and serve. Otherwise its an ice cube stuck in the pie pan.

I made this for a pot luck at work and now I am expected to bring this to all work pot lucks.  It is creamy and has wonderful flavor.  I like that the recipe makes two pies because one pie is just not enough.

Instead of making 1 pie, I made 16 individual pies in muffin tins. I also drizzled a little chocolate on the graham crumbs before adding the peanut butter filling and topped it with whipped cream and a mini peanut butter cup. They were a big hit!

Leave out the milk and use an Oreo or Nutter Butter cookie crust instead of boring old graham crackers.

LEAVE THE MILK OUT OF THIS PIE!  If you have to use milk to help mix down a little; use it very sparingly... As in a splash at most. 1 cup of milk is going to make this an extremely runny pie if serve times are longer than about 15-20 minutes out of the freezer or fridge.

The filling made here is quite rich, and VERY sweet.  Use a little less sugar and peanut butter to taste. A little vanilla will also smooth out the flavor a bit if desired.

I add a coating of dark chocolate ganache between the crust and the filling. It was the perfect addition to this delicious pie.

Made it for my boyfriends birthday, he loves chocolate peanut butter stuff! Super delicious! However, I only had to use half the amount of frozen whipped topping it called for. Topped it off with chocolate syrup drizzle and crushed Reese's!

I made this for my husbands birthday.  Wonderful. I am not a big fan of peanut butter but this I couldn't stop eating.  I made one with a regular graham cracker crust and one with a chocolate graham cracker crust.  Both were excellent.

I really liked this pie. It was quick and easy to prepare. I added some mini chocolate chips and sprinkled some on the top. However, the next time I make this, I will add only 12 oz of whipped topping because, it made way too much even for the large graham cracker pie crust. I had some left over and froze it to put  in mini pie crusts. A little on the sweet side, but  it  really  hit the peanut butter mark. I'll will definitely make this again.

I've made a similar pie like this and I've found the best milk to use for a pie that's going to "sit out"  is to substitute either Half & Half or heavy cream for the 'standing' effect.  Try that.

This is really good, however I thought it  was a bit rich. Made it exactly as the recipe stated except with a little more peanut butter.  The mixture completely filled (2) 9 inch crusts. Put them in the freezer and tried it the next day. I cut up a reeses peanut butter cup and sprinkled on part of it for my husband, which he really liked. For myself, I drizzled some chocolate syrup on it and it was really good!

I made the crust using 24 Nutterbutter cookies and 5 Tbs of butter. Added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the filling. Topped the pie off by sprinkling a chopped up king size Reece's on top of it. My husband loved it. It isn't super rich like some peanut butter pies tend to be.

I have know idea about folding something in, but I suppose it's kind of like mixing it slowly. Anyway, they came out so good, I didn't even share them. I was going to give one to my parents. Instead, we keep it for the next day all for ourselves. Loved it. I'll be making these for holiday get togethers. They really have a great taste and texture once they have frozen a bit. I didn't think it would make that big of a difference. But it did! Thanks for sharing this!

I made a graham cracker crust with 1 1/4 cups crumbs and 1/4 cup melted butter. I used a spring form pan. 

I made the recipe as stated however instead of frozen whipped topping I just whipped real whipping cream. It came out delicious! Very smooth, creamy and rich. 

Next time I will try something like crumbled skor bits on top, Reeces pieces bits, or frozen bananas.

I'll definitely make this one again--it was so good, even though I used Splenda and a sugar-free Cool Whip to make it a little friendlier for my diabetic parents. No one had any idea it was anything but a sweet treat until I told them they could indulge in a second piece.

LOVE THIS PIE!!!!!!!  When you make the filling it will look incredibly watery...this is ok!!!  Once it's frozen it firms up nicely and tastes AMAZING.  I only thawed it for maybe a half hour?  Depends how warm your house is.  I also had left over filling because I only made one pie.  I ended up freezing the left over in a container and got into it the next day.  IT'S LIKE PEANUT BUTTER ICE-CREAM!!!!!!  SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was amazing! I am 12 and this recipe is SO EASY! I made this for my beloved grandmother and she loved it. I tastes like Reese's  Peanut Butter Cups and it is low-fat.  One recommendation I have is that adding M&M's and Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. Even without the M&M's, Hershey's, crust; it would still taste good. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves chocolate and peanut butter!

This is absolutely delicious! I make it all the time for my co-workers, and bring it to family dinners. Not a smear is left in the pan! The only change I made is adding  just a little more peanut butter...fabulous!!

I've made this at least 20 times and it always comes out perfect.  I add a lot of crushed Reese's cups on top, along with swirls of chocolate and peanut butter syrup.  It's so easy to make, and absolutely delicious!

I suggest serving with a glass of milk ;)  This was so wonderful!  I made it for Thanksgiving with the only changes being half the whipped topping and an extra spoonful of peanut butter.  It was a big hit!

Wow! This was great! I made this in a 13 by 9 in. pan.  Used crunchy peanut butter. Yum! I took this out of the freezer half a hour before we served it. It was kinda melted but still good. I put my piece in the freezer and ate it later, frozen. That was the BEST! Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome peanut butter pie! I do wish the consistency was more solid. Next time I am going to try more cream cheese and sugar and less whip cream. Also, I think a pie crust would go well with the filling.

This is a very good dessert for all peanut butter lovers!! I use the milk to make whipped cream and fold into the filling. You don't have to freeze this pie, just chill it until it is set up. Top it off with Cool Whip drizzled with Magic Shell. You can garnish it with anything you like such as some of those things mentioned by others who rated this pie.

This is the real deal!  I made the filling and layered it with graham crackers and chocolate pudding, then topped it with chocolate frosting to make a sort of peanut butter cup inspired icebox cake.  Now after reading more reviews here, I realized maybe I should have used Nutter Butter cookies instead of graham crackers.  Think the family won't complain too much if I make this again.  :-)

I make this all the time. My friends ask for it at parties. My one trick is to use crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy. It gives it an amazing texture and just the right amount of crunch. Try it!! You won't be disappointed!!

We love peanut butter pie and I thought maybe try this recipe instead of the one I usually use. Mine old recipe did not use milk e does and it worried me about being runny. Well I made it anyways and froze it over night. Got it out and let it thaw for about 45 minutes before serving and it was not as firm as I like my pies and the longer it set out runnier it got. My guest wanted another piece but it was a mess by then. It had good flavor but gets runny if left out to long. Leave out the milk next time.

This was yummy! However, I mistakenly only put in half the amount of whipping cream and it came out VERY thin! Once frozen, this was much easier to eat. Thanks!

This recipe is so creamy and delicious. I followed a fellow reviewer's recommendation and omitted the milk, added 1 tbsp of Vanilla, and 8 oz of cool whip. I also crushed the nutter butter bars with some butter to make the crust. SO good!

This is now my fiancées favorite peanut butter pie. Very easy to make and turns out perfect. I get requests from family an neighbors to make it. I made a homemade crust using crumbled graham crackers and melted butter. Is a moister crust and always available!

My family loved this made just how it is! It is light and creamy, a perfect dessert with a big meal. I put it in the freezer overnight then took it to a family dinner. It stayed in the refrigerator until dessert time. I had no problems with it getting sloppy like some have mentioned. Next time I will cut out the milk though, I really don't think it's needed. Today I replaced the peanut butter with pumpkin, left out the milk and added pumpkin pie spice.  Can't wait to try it after our Thanksgiving meal!

Oh my gosh!  I just finished mixing this and putting it in the freezer, but from what I tasted on the beater and ultimately from licking the bowl, this is awesome!!!!  I could've just ate the mix right then and there!  I'm excited to try the frozen pie.  I have a feeling it's not going to last long!  If I had to choose between this and s**, I think I'd be putting on a lot of weight.

Made it with a gluten-free graham-cracker-and-butter crust, and it was raved about by children and adults alike. The top looks pretty plain; think of sprinkling chocolate curls or crumbled reeses on top.u

Loved it.  If I make it again, I would increase the amount of peanut butter, as the peanut butter taste didn't come through.  Would make my own pie crust as the store bought crust was to thin which throws off the balance.

Perfect!  Garnished with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups that I froze and then chopped.  My neighbors loved it!

The recipe is amazing, it's a perfect balance of sweet and peanut butter, but it's cute to make personal pies with mini pie crusts instead of 9-in crusts, and to drizzle almond bark or chocolate on top

So I did two pies Nutella, and PB.  I halved the ingredients so I can make2 seperate pies.   
1st one i did was the peanut butter. I halved the ingredients except i used only up to 1/3 of milk and 3/4 of one container of whip cream PER pie.  

The nutella pie instead of PB i used Nutella Hazelnut spread. and halved all the ingredients again not too much milk and whip cream.  I couldnt stop eating  both.  The easiest best pie ever.

Super easy and if you are in a peanut butter mood I'd highly recommend this one. But if not it will be peanut butter overkill.

I made this recipe for the first time last year and now it's requested ALL the time! I leave out the milk so I do not have to be concerned about it thawing "too much". If you do that you can typically let it set out for about an hour while people help themselves with out having to worry about it. My coworkers request this weekly and when I take it to picnics or gatherings, I get lots of wonderful compliments!

I only used 8 ounces of whipped topping and left the milk out, drizzled some chocolate on the top and YUM! This was wonderful. I used the remaining filling to layer brownies drizzle the brownies with chocolate and put a mini peanut butter cup on top.

Delicious as is, but I've made a few tweaks that make it perfect for me.  The first time I made this with milk and Cool Whip, and found that with the addition of Cool Whip some of the peanut butter flavor is lost.  On a whim, I decided to use heavy whipping cream instead of milk, beat the mixture (heavy whipping cream, peanut butter, cream cheese, and powdered sugar) until fluffy, and could thus use less Cool Whip.  Viola!  No PB flavor lost.  I've even made this without using any Cool Whip at all.  Also, I use a ratio of 1-1-1 (cups) when adding peanut butter, heavy whipping cream, and powdered sugar.  To decorate, I usually buy a Magic Shell Topping (Reese flavor), and prepare two melted down chip mixtures: one chocolate chip (made with chocolate chips, butter, and corn starch) and the other peanut butter chips (made the same as chocolate chip mixture).  Sometimes, if I want to make it really decadent, I'll crush up some chocolate chips in my food processor, and hand chop some peanut butter cups.  For the crust, I usually do a Oreo or Graham Cracker crust.  If I do Oreo, I'll just scoop the pie filling as normal.  If I do Graham Cracker, sometimes I'll make it a black-bottom pie, by pouring a little of the chocolate chip mixture to coat the bottom of the crust, then add the filling on top.  Whatever the case, I've gotten rave reviews any and all ways I've made this.

This pie is a wonderful light, cold dessert for a hot afternoon in the dessert.  However, it needs to be served straight from the freezer or it will begin to melt quickly.  I love just about anything peanut butter and added a bit more than the recipe called for.  I made one in a chocolate cookie crust, and we drizzled fudge sauce over it just before eating.  Couldn't have been easier to make, and it was gobbled right up!

This pie was DELICIOUS! I am a huge Reese Peanut Butter Cups fan and this tasted just like it, maybe better. Everyone liked this pie and I have since made 4! It is inexpensive to make as well. I crushed up some peanut butter cups and mixed them in with the filling and also sprinkled some generously on top. I used graham cracker crust which was delicious. I only used half of the whipped topping (cool whip) called for and it seemed to be plenty. Can't say enough good things about this pie! Try it, you'll really enjoy it!

O-m-g! Everyone from my 2 year old daughter to my 80 year old grandmother licked the plate clean! Plus I decreased the calorie count.... Low fat cream cheese, lite cool whip and only used about 12 ounces of the 16, 1 cup Splenda and only 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, also only needed about 3/4 cup milk or it will be a bit runny! AMAZING thanks for the recipe!!! Also decorated with whipped cream, Reese shell, and mini Reese's yummy

This pie was AMAZING.  I did have to alter the recipe slightly because I accidentally bought the 8 oz Cool Whip vs. the 16 oz.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of using 8 oz cool whip, 1 block cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 cup peanut butter. I also added the chopped up Reese's miniature peanut butter cups to the pie mixture before pouring it into the chocolate graham cracker pie shell.  I used more chopped peanut butter cups on the top for garnish.  Absolutely Fabulous!!  Keep in mind it is VERY rich and a little goes a long way......

Great pie -- quick and easy. I actually enjoyed it more as I had more of it (wasn't very into it at first, though). :) I used whipped cream instead of cool whip since that's what I had on hand.

We LOVE it!  My son ( he is 8years old ) always wants me to make it for Holidays, Birthdays etc..  He even wants me to make this pie to give to Uncle Danny for Christmas. It is very easy to make, I always half everything. One pie is enought for a family of four. Everyone should give it a try! :0)

So easy and soooo delicious! I agree with others -- an oreo crust really adds to the combo. I also liked it with chunky peanutbutter, and I used real whipping cream with a little bit of sugar added. yum! Not your low-cal dessert, but oh so worth the extra calories!

Delicious! I followed the recipe except I only used 8 oz of cool whip and made 1 pie and it turned out perfect. The whole family loved it. I had a little extra filling left and saved it for a treat fo another time. Will definitely make it again.

1. Used crushed nutter butter crust plus 5 TBSP. melted butter
2. included milk, still held together well
3. Did not use all of 16 oz whipped topping, saved some for pie topping
4. Use 1 1/4 cup of PB
5. Frozen cream cheese is ok to use.

My family, a people who tend to stray from peanut butter, tasted it and said they relished the graham cracker more than the peanut butter pie filling. But when I gave this to a few friends who didn't have any particular opinion on peanut butter, one said, "This pie is amazing." We all thought it was a delicious after-dinner sweet-tooth satisfier. 
I had trouble obtaining frozen whipped topping, and again when I tried to freeze whip cream. When I removed it from the freezer, the whip cream had just flattened into cream. I used it anyway. 
I filled up one pie crust with the filling. A second one wasn't necessary. And I wanted an extra crunch, so I smashed graham crackers and covered the pie with them.
It's quite tasty and simple to prepare. The instructions are straightforward, and I'm familiar with all the ingredients. My only negative comments: The peanut butter flavor can overwhelm those who aren't fond of peanut butter, and the directions here provide for a result lacking a needed crunchy texture.

I made this last weekend as a treat for my husband and two small kids.  THIS WAS GREAT.  We live in the south, and since it's been 100+ degrees every day this summer, a no-bake pie is a necessity.  If you are unsure, look no further than this recipe.  It's a keeper.  Remember to bring your cream cheese to room temperature or it will be awkward at first getting it mixed.  5 stars!!

I made this last night and I love it! The only changes I made were that I used a chocolate pie crust, Neufchatel cheese, and light whipped topping. I also added chocolate ice cream topping and Reese's miniatures to the top. I find that it sets up much nicer if I just leave it in the freezer and then serve it. It gets much too soft in the freezer, but then that also may be due to the fact that I halved the recipe so that it only made one pie. Overall, I love this recipe and I will definitely be making this dessert again!

This was really quick to make and very tasty!  Really sweet so just a sliver goes a long way.  I served with nutter butters.

Excellent recipe!  There is just enough cream cheese to cut the sweetness, definitely use a mixer for a perfectly smooth pie.  Can't wait to try some of the other reviewers tips...this would be great with a chocolate crust and a chocolate drizzle.

Amazing recipe! And so easy too, can't beat that :o)My DH adores this pie. It's easy to make half a recipe too if you only need one. It's great as is, but I wanted to spruce it up for the 4th of July so when I served it, I warmed some ice cream topping (hot fudge) and drizzled it over the pie before cutting it. So pretty! Also, I took the time to make my own graham cracker crust rather than buying a ready made one. I think this step really takes the yum factor up a notch!

wow you really can't get much simpler than this... so easy to make... i made one with an oreo crust and the other with a nutter butter crust... both 24 cookies and 1/4 cup butter than baked at 350 for 10 minutes and allowed to cool.... so easy to decorate and make look great.. and easy to make a healthy version too if you really wanted... I cut the whipped topping back to 12 oz i can't imagine using 16 oz... 12 oz seemed to work well though..

Absolutely wonderful.  It mixed up quickly and easy.  My only problem was that it doesn't set hard enough.  It makes it a mess to serve, but the taste can't be beat!  Maybe some extra sugar would solve the problem and make it a little more solid.

I melted some chocolate and caramel mixed with a little milk and drizzled it over the top of the pie.  It gave the perfect extra touch.

This is good, but I did change a few things to meet our taste.  I was generous with the peanut butter.  I added probably at least 2 extra TB.  I used a pre-made shortbread crust.  I'm not fond of graham cracker crusts and I was afraid a chocolate crust would compete too much with the peanut butter.  Since my hubby is an extreme peanut butter fan I only used 8 oz of frozen whipped topping so it wouldn't dilute the peanut butter taste too much.  Since I only used 8 oz of the whipped topping there was only enough filling for one pie crust, but there was plenty of filling left.  I put the extra in a container and refrigerated and my hubby ate it like a mousse.  Also, we don't like frozen pies so refrigerating it for a few hours or overnight is sufficient.  This is a very simple recipe that can be easily modified to meet your tastes.

Delicious!  I made it with a chocolate graham cracker pie crust, and I broke an Oreo into TINY crumbs, and sprinkled it all over the top.  It was really more for the design, but after tasting it, I realized that it DEFINITELY needed the chocolate!  Glad I chose to make it that way from the start.  Definitely going to make this again!  SUPER EASY!

I made one with graham cracker crust and one with Oreo crust. Both were delicious. I did not add candy or syrup on top. I used Splenda, light cream cheese, light whip cream, and crunchy peanut butter (I was out of creamy). Everyone loved it!! I will certainly make it again!

Great pie. Have made it many times and will make over and over. I also make it with butterfinger candy bars. I just add one king size to the batter and then one king for topping. I also make a oreo crust. I have to make two at holidays. One for dinner and one for my nephew who takes it home and eats.

I halved this recipe because we only needed one pie and it came out perfect!  Also recommend using a chocolate pie crust instead of graham cracker.  Delicious!!

Fabulous! And so easy. I could only give it 4 stars though since I'm not sure how it turns out with the whipped topping. I, per usual, did not have any on hand, nor did I have heavy whipping cream, which is rare. Being too lazy to go to the store and really craving such a dessert, I had to substitute a mix of additional milk + butter (enough to equal 1 cup). It turned out smooth, creamy and super rich and delicious! Thanks for this!!

Very delicious -- though I did compensate a bit, as I didn't have some of the exact incredients on hand. For instance, I didn't have a store bought oreo crust, so I made my own by crushing about 30 or so cookies in my Cuisinart, stirring in 1 stick of butter and pressing into pan. I also didn't have cool whip, so I made my own whipped cream. I took 2c. of whipped cream and whipped it into stiff peaks with my KitchenAid, then folded it into the PB mixture. If you let it set overnight in fridge, the consistency is best. I brought it to a get together and it was a HIT.

I halved this recipe to make one pie.  I made it the night before and put it in the freezer and didn't take it out until the following night during dinner time.  After about an hour and a half in the fridge it had thawed and was perfect to serve.  I only had natural peanut butter on hand and my friends said it was perfect and not too sweet.  Will definitely make again!

Very easy to make, and a great hit with my boyfriend and everyone else who eats it! I have made it exactly as the recipe is written, and that was great. The last time I made it, I followed one of the other tips about cutting out the milk for a richer pie, because I had to travel with it, and that worked out great. I've used Nutter Butter cookies for the crust, as suggested; I've used a layer of crushed Nutty Bars on top of the crust, and I normally top the pie with Miniature Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and/or Reese's Pieces. All have worked with this recipe, but it is great just the way it is!

This pie is DELICIOUS.  I am 13 and it was super easy for me.  Great for inexperienced chefs (not saying I am[: ) I got a store-bought chocolate cookie pie crust instead of graham cracker, much more fitting.  I must've skipped right over that the cool whip had to be thawed, I ended up microwaving it the soften it up.  Make sure all ingredients are room temperature for easy mixing.  I make this for a communion, and it was super duper fun and easy to prepare with my 11 year old cousin.  Instead of topping it with Oreos and chocolate cookie crumbs, I smashed up some chocolate chip cookies from a box, Chips Ahoy, and sprinkled the crumbs on top.  It was contrasting to the rich chocolate-peanut butteriness of the pie, went over extremely well.  I made the whole 2pies, and when one was gone, my aunt was nervous because everyone wanted some.  She was relieved to discover we had another, in the end there weren't ANY leftovers.  And I will tell you right now, if you are not usually a chocolate-peanut lover, you may still enjoy it.  ---Allie

YUMM
2 people made peanut butter pies for Easter, and I have to say I definetly enjoyed mine more. You can taste the peanut butter without it being overly overwehelming. It was light and tasty. I used an Oreo crust with Oreos on top, YUMM, will be making it again!!!

I usually don't make no-bake, quick recipes because I love to bake and I do it for fun. But I told my friend I would make peanut butter pie, and this one had the best reviews. I will make it over and over again. It was peanut buttery and rich and delicious, despite using skim milk, low-fat cream cheese and fat-free whipped topping. Next time I'm also gonna use half splenda for the sugar and low-fat peanut butter. I chopped up some reese's peanut butter cups as a garnish--pretty and very tasty!

I've made this recipe twice so far.  The first time I made two 9" pies and used the entire 16 oz package of whipped topping.  I had to keep them in the freezer or they would get "soupy" turn to puddles of mush.  The second one I made using a larger spring form pan and about half the amount of whipped topping and it turned out a lot better.  I'm still looking for a recipe that I had that's layered with more of a peanut butter pudding like base on the bottom and is made in a regular crust.

Very easy to make and tastes wonderful, didn't make any changes and the husband said it was the best pie he's ever had. Topped it off w/a bittersweet chocolate ganache from this website and it came out great.

Love this wonderful, creamy, easy pie to make. Made it for the first time for Christmas and it was a hit. Next time I think I will try 'crunchy' peanutbutter.

Big hit at the office Christmas party!  Even people who said they don't usually like peanut butter pie, were saying it was the best thing they'd ever tasted!

BEST Peanut Butter Pie I've Had! I made a few changes to the recipe so I would end up with just one pie instead of two. I took the advice of another review and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I also skipped the milk and added only 1/2 cup of peanut butter. This was my first time making a peanut butter pie so I was a little nervous on now it would turn out. I have no worries now this recipe is practically dummy proof!

Of the numerous pies and other desserts I made for Thanksgiving, this one was the favorite!  I was a little skeptical that I'd like it, but it's amost addictive.  You need to try it!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was an absolute hit.  I cut the recipe in half to only make one pie and it came out perfect.  I used a tiny bit less cool whip than it called for since it seemed like a lot and I also crushed up some pb cup candies to sprinkle on top.  YUM!  My family couldn't stop raving about it.  I also put it in the fridge instead of the freezer and it was the perfect consistency.  This is a new desert staple in our house.

The taste was delicious: I used a graham cracker crust and chopped Reese's cups to put on top. My only complaint was that the pie didn't set up as firmly as I would like. (It was too hard in the freezer and too soft in the fridge.) I think less cool whip might help. However, I would definitely make it again.

Delicious! I made it with the nutter butter crust, but next time I will use half nutter butter and half graham crackers. I also reduced the sugar and added vanilla.

I just served this for Thanksgiving and the word "phenomenal" was used more than once.  I took the opportunity to make two different crusts to see if one went over better.  I made a nutterbutter crust put real hot fudge on it before putting in filling and topped with chopped peanutbutter cups and swirled hot fudge.  I also made and oreo crust and topped with crushed oreos.   I think it was just people's preference as to what they liked more, but tasting them both I wouldn't recommend one over the other, they were both amazing.  I followed other reviewers and only used 3/4 of the cool whip other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I am sure this will be requested at all family gatherings from now on.

This is such a good pie - i was doing a "pantry pie" one night, cleaning out stuff left over from a party and i threw this together - i changed the recipe (because i was out of milk) instead of milk and confectioner's sugar, i added a can of sweetened condensed milk and WHOA, that's how i make it now.  all the other ingredients the same, just substitute a can of sweetened condensed milk for the milk and sugar and see what you think :) great recipe!

This was great! My husband and I both raised an eyebrow at how much coolwhip it calls for, but it was very creamy and nice. I may cut the amount just a bit to see if I can get a firmer texture and a richer peanut butter taste. (Just to test it out) Either way, I'll be making this again for sure!

VERY light and fluffy- which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. It was like eating diluted cool whip. It just didn't have enough substance and was not the consistancy I was looking for. The peanut butter flavor wasn't strong enough either.   My son and his classmates did like it so maybe it's just not for me and my husband?

This is where the phrase "Easy as Pie" comes from.  This was the easiest, tastiest pie I've made.  My only change was to use an Oreo crust as opposed to a graham cracker crust.  Made it for a peanut butter pie lover and he was extremely happy with the outcome.  Will probably be making this again for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

This was AMAZING! I honestly didnt even think a peanut butter pie sounded good, I just saw it had good ratings and decided to try something new. I brought it to a gathering and everyone loved it, plus it made two pies so it was perfect for the gathering!

THIS IS HEAVEN!!! i once went to a friends house for dinner, where they served peanut butter pie. when i got home, I immediately looked for a recipe, and this is the one i found. now i make it about once a week, and my family LOVES it!!!!!   We're not really such big peanut butter fans, so i put like 1/4 cup- 1/4 cup of peanut butter. it still has that peanut butter flavor, without it being too strong. I've had guests who said- I hate peanut butter, but this pie is awesome!!!  thanks for the recipe!!

Everyone raved about this pie!  I made a few changes, light cool whip only 12 ounces, 2% milk, and made my own crust by crushing chocolate graham crackers with nutter butter cookies and pressing them into a pie pan after mixing with melted butter.  Absolutely delicious.  Garnished with chopped peanut butter cups! Yum..and everyone loved it

This pie is probably the most delicious thing I have ever created, let alone eaten, in my whole life! The only thing I changed was to cut the whipped topping in half to only 8 oz. I'll be making this again very soon!

This is my favorite pie, ever. It is so rich and creamy. I do make my own crust out of chocolate graham crackers. I pound the crackers into crumbs and mix with just enough butter to moisten and press it into the pie plates. One of my coworkers had made a pie like this with a storebought crust and says the homemade crust makes it so much better.

This was amazing! Simply. I've had other peanut butter pies before, and  they always seem to be way too rich or too sweet. This pie was perfect. I used crunchy peanut butter to add a little texture. It was a big hit at my family reunion!

WOW!  I don't even care for peanut butter and I already finished one pie by myself.  I did as others said and used about 3/4 of the 16oz cool whip. I also used a heaping ( a lil more) cup of peanut butter. My peanut butter lover (hubby) loved it! This one is a keeper!

An absolute crowd-pleaser in our home. I reduce the sugar to about 3/4 cup and use neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese. Homemade whipped cream is THE BEST! I always buy one "regular" graham cracker crust and one chocoloate crust. You can't go wrong with this!

You cannot deny this is an amazing peanut butter pie, anyone who loves peanut butter will swoon to this! However, 16oz of Whipped Topping is too much and throws off the consistency. Only use 8oz!!

This was soooo easy and really good.  Tasted like a peanut butter ice cream pie.  Not too sweet- everyone else that I served it to also really liked it.  Refreshing on a hot summer's evening.

REALLY sweet. Was super simple to make, but no one could eat more than a sliver. If you like really rich desserts, you would love this, but it was a little too rich for me.

This pie (vaguely reminiscent of cheesecake, perhaps a cross between it and an ice cream cake...with peanut butter, thus making it even more irresistable) is delicious.    I actually reduced the amount of powdered sugar to a bit under 1 cup, and it still tasted fine. (I could probably even go down a bit farther; I think 1-1/2 would be too sweet for my tastes.) The second time I made it I substituted unflavored yogurt for some of the whipped topping, as well, and it also turned out nicely.    All in all, a great dessert! Next time I might try swirling in some melted chocolate and see how it tastes...

prepared with chocolate crust, with chocolate hardshell ice cream topping poured into the crust before pouring in the filling. SOOO YUMMY! Frozen, this is a fantastic, creamy treat. I made 2 and they were gone in a flash! Easy, creamy and NOM NOM!

This was a really great pie! Everyone that tried it, loved it! I made my own crust and it made one large pie. Next time, I will use oreo crumb crust. I decorated it with whip cream and mini peanut butter cups.

Great recipe! My boyfriend doesn't eat sweets but when he does, it's always peanut butter cups. I made a few changes though. First I only made one pie, but kept the amounts for the filling the same. I also took the advice of others and used oreo cookie crumbs for the crust. I substituted the milk for whipping cream to make the filling a little fluffier, therefore I didn't freeze it, just stuck it in the fridge for a couple hours.

I just made this pie after having it in my recipe box for forever. It's not frozen yet, but fortunately I saved a little extra filling in a bowl for me to snack on! It's amazing and super easy. I bought the ingredients and made it in no time, all the while talking on the phone!

This was really good and very creamy.  We used a regular graham shell and I do think a chocolate shell would be much better.  I softened hot fudge just enough to be spreadable and spread on the bottom and sides of the pie crust.  I then topped the pie with spoonfulls of the hot fudge and swirled through the top before freezing.  It was a beautiful presentation.  I'll definitely make this again, but, probably experiment with different toppings and maybe add some chopped reese cups to the filling.

Since this recipe yields 2 pies, I halved the recipe and prepared 2 different pies (one reduced sugar version for my diabetic dad and a regular one). For the reduced sugar version, I replaced the confectioner's sugar with splenda (in a blender mix 1 cup of granulated Splenda with about 1 tsp cornstarch, this makes about 3/4 cup of "confectioner's sugar") and made my own crust with chocolate baking crumbs (mix 1 1/2 cups of chocolate crumbs with 1/4 cup margarine).  For the other pie, I followed the recipe, except I made my own crust with crushed Pirate cookies (Pirate cookies are a peanut butter cream filled cookies made by Christie). The filling in the regular pie was definitely softer, but my boyfriend and I both prefered the reduced sugar version.

Very rich and decadent; tastes like an entire jar of PB was used.  Super easy, I will make this again, but only for a crowd of PB-lovers, such as myself.

I froze some regular sized Reeses Peanut butter cups and just before I popped the pies in the freezer, I garnished them with coarsely chopped Reesces Peanut Butter cups.  I used a chocolate cookie crust for this recipe (Keebler) although a chocolate graham cracker crust would be great with this.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and lite whipped topping and 2% milk.  Absolutely WONDERFUL dessert.  Will be making this often!

I just made this pie and it's Awesome!  I've made others similar to this but it always tasted too much like cream cheese.  Perhaps the milk added helps to avoid this.  I did add about 1/4 cup more Peanut butter to this as I read others did in other Reviews and it made it just perfect!  This is sure to please just about everyone!

For a very easy, no bake dessert, this is very good.  Made this using light cream cheese and light Cool Whip and it turned out great. You can use crunchy peanut butter if you like. I put this in an store bought Oreo Pie Crust because I like the combination of tastes.

We loved this recipe.  Keep this in the freezer and it'll keep for weeks-great presentation for company.  We used reeses peanut butter cups halved for the top of each slice and mixed some into the batter as well.

Used pre-made shortbread crust in place of graham cracker.  Chocolate crusts would be good also.  Refrigerated one pie and froze the other.  The refrigerated one is very light--good after a heavy meal and probably my favorite.  The frozen one is denser and heavier but good tasting also.

This pie rocks.  It is totally quick and simple but at the same time it is a real crowd pleaser.  When I make these I add crushed peanut butter cups when I fold in the cool whip.  I also fill 12 of the small Keebler individual pie crusts instead of the 9in pans.  This way everyone can have their own little dessert.  You can also dip a cookie cutter into Hersheys syrup and then lightly press into the top of the pie, this will leave a chocolate outline in the shap of the cookie cutter.

This was fantastic!  I added more peanutbutter and a layer of chocolate frosting atop the graham cracker crust.  Delish!  Next time we are going to try this with a layer of Nutella and top the peanutbutter cream with banana's  :)

Um... wow.    Just a warning - this turns out a little bit more like ice cream pie, but let me tell you it's delicious, and I've never had anything quite like it.   Mine maybe turned out more like ice cream because I put in a lot of whipped cream in the batter, and then put it in the freezer.  But now I wouldn't dream of eating it any other way than with extra whipped cream to harden it enough for an ice cream consistency.  Highly recommend for peanut butter AND ice cream lovers.

Un-be-lievable!  I bought 2 chocolate pie crusts and followed the recipe exactly.  Once the crusts were filled I topped the pies with crushed oreoes, crushed peanut butter cups and drizzled some chocolate syrup on top and stuck them in the freezer.  HUGE hit!!  Will definitely be making this again!

SO easy and so good! I made the recipe using an oreo crumb crust. I added half the filling to the pie and then added a layer of chopped peanut butter cups. I added the rest of the filling and topped the pie by making a pretty design using dark chocolate syrup I had on hand. I will definitely make again!

I modified the recipe by crushing chocolate covered grahams with melted butter and used that as the pie crust. I followed the recipe, except I omitted the cup of milk and folded in just 8 ounces of whipped topping. The pie turned out really delicious and was enjoyed by everyone.

This is my go to pie anytime I need to take a dessert!  Easy, inexpensive and it tastes divine!  I use the chocolate crust so it ends up tasting like a peanut butter cup.

I have now made this recipe twice (the first time I had a brainfart and used regular sugar instead of confectioners' but it still worked out wonderfully)  and the pie disappears incredibly quickly. My friend is a major Reese's cup lover, and this is her favorite pie. We use a chocolate crust, and then cover the top with chocolate syrup. Sooo goood.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was absolutely delicious. It did need more time in the freezer though. I would suggest 6 hours in the freezer instead of the 2. After serving each piece, I drizzled a little bit of chocolate over the top. It looked wonderful and tasted just as good!

This recipe is great and very easy to make.  It's a perfect recipe to make in advance and keep in the freezer for guests.  I make it look even better by adding some chopped reese's and drizzling melted dark chocolate on the top!  I know we wouldn't mind to have one of these in the freezer 24/7!

Really an excellent recipe.  I got several requests for the recipe after bringing it to a gathering.  Personally I'd prefer a more prominent peanut butter flavor, so I'll use more peanut butter the next time, but overall an excellent and EASY recipe.

This pie is so good, people I work with have put in their orders for Thanksgiving. I did make a few minor changes 1. Used chocolate cookie pie crust 2. Spread hot fudge on crust and on top of filling 3. Drizzled with a little peanut butter sauce on top. 4. Increased peanut butter to 1 cup. If I could give it 10 stars I certainly would. Thanks Megans.

This was very quick to make although I made my own cookie crust rather than using a premade crust. I also spread a small jar of hot fudge sauce onto the base before adding the mousse and sprinkled chopped mini peanut butter cups on top for a garnish. One recipe made plenty for a 9x13 pan and would feed over a dozen people because it is very rich. Be warned though, it does not hold up well out of the freezer and will get too soft to cut if left out for very long. Great flavor and texture, will make again!

Made this today & it was a big hit. I do agree with another reviewer that a 16 oz tub of whipped cream is too much. I used a 8oz and filled 2 crusts with no problem. Remember to leave it in the freezer though...we transported it and left it out too long and it was somewhat runny but delicious all the same. I used a graham cracker crust for one & a chocolate for the other but next time I'll try the Nutter Butter! Thanks for a easy, no fuss dessert!

This was a HUGE hit at the baby shower I took it to. I covered the top of my pie in lots of crumbled peanut butter cups. Everyone thought it was some kind of peanut butter cup icecream and one woman demanded the recipe!

AWESOME! I love peanut butter and this pie hits the spot without being overly sweet. I prepared just as the recipe is written and used 1 graham cracker crust and one chocoate crust. The chocolate crust is much better! I also topped with crushed peanut butter Oreo cookies. It was a huge hit!

Very yummy and so easy to make!  I used an orea crust instead.  Also froze reese's cups and chopped them up and added them on top.  Made this for a birthday dinner and everyone loved it.  Excellent frozen or in the fridge.

Absolutely the best!! I took it to a family outing and everyone wanted the recipe.  I made my in a 9x13 and made my own graham cracker crust (it's all I had on hand), I also topped it off with cut up reese's cups and drizzled a little chocolate syrup on top.  It looked amazing and tasted even better.  Husband says I have to make it again soon.

This was pretty good. My husband really enjoyed it. I made one with an oreo crust and one with a graham cracker crust, and then drizzled Hershey's syrup over the top. We preferred the Oreo crust.

This could easily be 5 stars, but needs a crust made of something other than graham crackers.  I think peanut butter desserts need chocolate, so I made some fudge sauce to spoon on top.  It was very easy to make, and I will again, trying out crust and mix in variations.  It is a great recipe when you do not want to turn on the oven.

Great recipe!  I made an Oreo crust and put mini chocolate-peanut butter cups on top.  I ended up making it into a no bake peanut butter cake, to save room in the freezer.  Soooo good!

I did follow the recipe as written and while I thought it was good, I didn’t think it was spectacular. Perhaps chunky peanut butter would have made it better, but after a bite or two it lost it’s appeal. I made it for adults but I have the feeling kids would really love it!

One word can sum this up: YUM.  I prepared this on a whim since I had a PB craving and wanted something to incorporate it into a dessert. I modified this to be low-fat/healthy: I used fat free cream cheese, Splenda in place of the sugar, fat free whipped topping, skim milk and reduced fat chunky peanut butter. I didn't change any of the measurements and was a bit concerned that the 'batter' was really soupy/runny, but once it was in the freezer for a few hours, it set up quite nicely. I actually took it to my BF's parents' house tonight and everyone raved about it! They  licked their plates clean! It tasted like a Snicker or butterfinger bar and had the consistency of ice cream...SOOO yummy, this recipe will be a permanent part of my collection!

Loved it. I halved the recipe to make one pie. added a little extra low fat crunchy peanut butter and a little less powdered sugar than recommended. I used light whipped topping and light cream cheese. i totally skipped the milk. not sure why it needs milk - it was delicious and creamy without it. I mashed graham crackers and mixed them with butter for the crust because i could not find a premade crust in NYC! topped it with mini choc chips because I had them in the fridge. Fast and easy to make.

This was amazing! I cut the recipe in half to make just one pie but other than that followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly! I was surprised by how strong the peanut butter taste really was even though there was only 1/2 a cup of it in the pie. I melted some chocolate and drizzled it on top as a garnish along with some oreo cookie crumbs as I didn't have any reese's peanut butter cups to chop and put on top like I'd wanted to. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is such a super simple dessert that you can easily change up buy switching out which crust you use, and which toppings you chose! My husband and his family LOVE when I bring this dessert to holiday meals! I make the filling exactly how the recipe states and it's worked out perfect every time!

Very good. I halved the recipe and it turned out great. I made my own whipping cream though (1 pint heavy whipping cream, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup sugar). I also took the suggestion of the nutter butter crust b/c I LOVE nutter butters. However, I thought it was too rich. I think a short bread crust would help balance out the peanut butter flavor.

My husband really enjoyed it.  It was abit rich for my taste but I'm sure it's because I made 1 pie, used a block of cream cheese, a small tub of cool whip, and 1 cup of peanut butter and no milk.  I think next time I'll make 2 and add the milk and it won't be quite as rich.  But it was still really good.

I was happy to see a review by another using Nutter Butter Cookies for their crust. I decided to add 8 mini butterfinger bars chopped up for the crust. YUM!!!! Then followed the recipe as directed.  My children loved it.

I hate to do this...I followed the directions 100% and it just did not turn out.  Perhaps it was not what we were expecting.  The flavor was nice but the texture was not working, frozen or refrigerated.

INCREDIBLE! I used the chocolate pie crust instead.  As per other suggestions, I only used 1/2 cup of milk and 3/4 of the tub of cool whip so it wouldn't get runny. I also used 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter to get a little bit more taste.  I did everything else the same according to the recipe and I must say... this is delicious.  I brought the second pie into work and it was enjoyed by many.

I took this to a July 4th party, and it was gone in a matter of minutes.  Taking a suggestion from another reviewer, I pulsed 24 Nutter Butters and 5 T. butter in the food processor for the crust.  Just to jazz it up a bit, I put the pie in a springform pan.  I sprinkled it with chopped peanut butter cups, drizzled with some hot fudge sauce, then stuck it in the freezer.  This was a huge party hit but with minimal effort on my part!

Oh so easy, and oh so delicious! I used two different pre-made crusts - one chocolate and the other shortbread. There was just the right amount of filling for each pie.  Plopped them in the freezer till filling started to lightly freeze, then topped each one with rough chopped Skor Bars and toasted almonds. Returned to freezer.

THIS RECIPE WAS A SUCCESS! QUICK, EASY & DEEELICIOUS. :) I used all the specified ingredients, although I did add some HEATH BAR MIX to sprinkle on top of the pie. My family and I enjoyed this pie so much that we've decided to have PEANUT BUTTER PIE once a month. I usually buy pie, cake, or cookies once a month for our after dinner desset, but I'll definitely be saving a little money making it myself. Thanks a bunch!

Cheap, quick, easy and tasty.  Nothing too sophisticated here but a definite keeper.  Used one pre-made graham crust from grocery store - still used 8 oz. cream cheese and 8 oz. of light cool whip but dropped amount of sugar to 3/4 cup and would use even a little less in future.  Used slightly more than one cup of peanut butter.  Layered bottom of crust with Hershey's Dessert Fudge but next time will either melt dark chocolate instead or will line bottom with peanut butter M&Ms - the fudge isn't the best.  To decorate I used colorful peanut butter M&Ms around the edge.  Firmed it up by putting in freezer but then decided to keep it in the fridge - tastes great - not too soft for my taste.

This recipe was a 3 for several reasons.  First, there is barely a peanut butter taste, it mostly tasted like cool whip and cream cheese to me.  Second, VERY fattening, and third, it's ugly.  If you make this and like the way it tastes, then plan on drizzling chocolate over it or crumbling reeses on top or something to make it look yummier.

This is very delicious! Only change I made was I only added 8oz of cool whip instead of 16ozs. By doing that the recipe only made 1 large pie instead of 2! It was  very*very good! I will make it often now! Thank you for sharing.

I used frozen deep dish pie shells and baked as directed before filling. I also used 6 pkgs or reese's peanut putter cups (regular size) and crumbled half over the bottom of pie shells before filling and the other half on top after being in freezer for about an hour, otherwise they would have sunk to the bottom. This was quick and easy and SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! Will be my go to dessert for potlucks! I even made another batch to keep in the freezer for company or for when I need to bring a dish> I wrapped in plastic wrap and put inside a large freezer bag and it fit perfect! I also garnished with whipped cream from a can and drizzled chocolate syrup over for a nice presentation! Hope this helps!

This is super delicious.  I usually add more cool whip and peanut butter to it.  After it is finished, I melt a little peanut butter and drizzle it which makes it really pretty.  Every time I make it people ask for the recipe!

This turned out really good.  My other half request this on a regular now.  The only change I made was adding a layer of hot fudge on the bottome and whipped cream on the top with shaved chocolate for cuteness.

Where has this dessert been all my life?!?  I made this for Easter dinner and it was a hit.  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust and decorated the top with chocolate syrup.  It is best served just slightly thawed.  This is a fast, easy and economical dessert - cost me about $5 to make this.

This became one of my favorite pies instantly! I've made it quite a few times now and have found a couple ingredients that really make it even more decadent. I use 8 oz. regular Cool Whip and 8 oz. Chocolate Cool Whip. I chop up about 10 mini Reeses peanut butter cups and mix them into the filling. I also chop up about 10 more mini Reeses pb cups and sprinkle them over the top of both pies. For the finishing touch, I create a lattice design on top of the pies with chocolate syrup, freeze or refrigerate until firm, then enjoy! The pies have just a hint of chocolate from the chocolate Cool Whip but peanut butter remains the strongest flavor--Delicious!!

Ummm.......SO GOOD!  I chose this dessert to make for my niece and her Hubby and he said, "I should give this recipe to professional chefs to make", He loved it that much!  I also halved the recipe.  I made a nutter butter cookie crust, used 8 oz. cream cheese, 8 oz. whipped topping, 1 cup of conf. sugar, 1 cup of pnt. butter, and omitted the milk.  I partially froze the pie (that's all the time I had) and it was great!  I then kept the remainder (which wasn't much!) in the fridge and it held up very well.  I think I even liked it better not frozen!!  I would recommend this and will definatly make again!  I can see why this would be good as a "lower-cal" version too!

YUM!!  My boyfriend made this for my birthday and it was AWESOME!!  He followed the directions exactly, exceptused 8 oz. real whipped cream and 8 oz. Cool Whip.  He made one pie with graham cracker crust and one with Oreo crust.  He used 5 regular sized Reese's PB Cups that he coarsley chopped and sprinkled over both pies.  Tastes like peanut butter ice cream.

I love this recipe, it is super easy and the recipe explains it well. The only thing I had a problem  with was the refrigeration, I had to keep the pies in the freezer because of the consistency. But it was just as well because it tasted like peanut butter ice cream pie!!

Delicious!!! I took an idea from a different recipe and coarsely chopped 5 peanut butter cups and added it to the pie filling.  I also read the instructions wrong and only added 8oz of cool-whip instead of 16oz.  Therefore I did not have enough filling for 2 pie crusts, but definately more than enough for one.  I've made it twice in the last week and everybody that has tried it has raved about it.  (Actually, the recipe is so easy to make that the second time my 7&9 yr. old daughters made it by themselves.) I'm sure we'll be making this again.

I did not change a thing. If you like peanut butter, this will be one of your favorite desserts! It freezes like ice cream and melts in your mouth! It is very easy to make.

This was pretty tasty, though a bit too sweet as written. If I made it again, I would decrease the sugar by half. I mixed in chocolate chips. While that addition made the pie taster, it also made it even sweeteer :) I used reduced fat peanut butter, reduced fat cream cheese, and light cool whip. I doubt anyone could tell the difference between the taste of this pie and one made with full fat ingredients. This pie has an ice cream consistency/texture once frozen... Judging by what it looked like when I put it in the Oreo crust, it probably wouldn't hold up very well in the fridge or at room temperature.

5-star for an easy recipe, and 4-1/2 stars for flavor. I did use 1/2 cream and half milk (just to use up some cream). And because of an oversight, we only used 1/2 the frozen whipped topping: no need next to use a whole 16 oz.:still had enough filling for two nicely filled pies. That error, just might have made it more flavorful. If this recipe wasn't flavorful enough for you...try my mistake!. Delicious outcome, to make again and again (with 1/2 the whipped topping). Also, this recipe gets a "brownie point" for stating to "freeze". That is, by far, the way we like, best... just out of the freezer a few minutes, and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I am so glad we made two!

I would use less cool whip, the amount the recipe called for really diluted the taste of the peanut butter and richness (which I wanted.)  I also used natural fresh ground honey roasted peanut butter which worked very well.  One last thing is the amount of sugar can be cut down a bit.  Overall, great and extremely easy pie to make.

My family thought it was the best pie ever. I only put in one 8 oz tub of whippped topping then made some fudge sauce and put it in the bottom of the pie crust and froze that for 1/2 hour before putting on the peanut butter mixture. It worked out perfectly. I cut peanut butter cups in half and arranged over the top.

Okay I have made this pie sooo many times now, and it is the best recipe. I did one thing different and that was making the whip cream instead of store bought, BIG difference. I also added a layer of hot fudge to the top of an oreo cookie crust, oh lord its like eating a creamy piece of heavenly chocolate peanut butter pie. everyone should try this pie. I have even had people who don't care for peanut butter tell me they love it. Good going with this one.

EXCELLENT!!! I made this recipe, but didn't write the ingredients down correctly...so I ended up adding only 1 container of Cool-whip rather than 2. It STILL turned out amazing! I also used the mini-pie graham cracker shells (my kids thought it was fun!) The texture of this dessert was really creamy, even right out of the freezer! This is a definite keeper for my recipe collection!!!

Easy and tasty. Very rich. Made with real whipping cream instead of frozen whipped topping and it turned out well. Decorated with chopped peanut butter cups. Thanks!

Really really rich but super good. It was so yummy! Tasted like a peanut butter cheesecake almost. Put crushed butterfinger on top. Very very good but definitely not something to have all the time.

I made this recipe for my hubby's birthday and it was a HUGE hit!  I made a few changes that we liked better than the original...

#1: Made an oreo crust instead of the graham cracker.  Just crushed the wafer part of the oreo and mixed with melted butter...then froze until ready to add filling. Do not add sugar!  
#2: Added a layer of fudge sauce on top of crust.
#3: Used Natural Peanut Butter instead of Jiffy- cuts down on the sweetness to make it just right!
Add filling and freeze until ready to eat!  Delicious!

This recipe is very yummy, I couldn't quit tasting the filling. I only used 1 8oz tub of whipped topping for my pies and they turned out delicious!

This was excellent. I added a pinch of salt to give it the taste of the popular peanut butter cups, and also used chocolate pie crusts. My husband and I both loved it! Once it has frozen overnight, it is the perfect consistency.

This was my first attempt at peanut butter pie for some friends. A few of them thought it was store-bought! I made one with a chocolate graham cracker crust and crushed peanut butter cups on top (that's the one they ate) and made the other with a regular crust and chocolate sauce swirled on top and froze it for later. It was delicious and easy. I will definitely be making this again!! Thanks!

Rave reviews from everyone at a party I just took this to!  SOOO Yummy!!!  Did the nutterbutter crust as mentioned from another reviewer, put some melted reeses cups (stirred up after they were melted in the microwave) on the bottom of the crust before pouring in the filling.  The filling was made with less sugar a little vanilla and NO milk and poured into one pie.  Cut into very small pieces since it is very rich.  Topped with a little cool whip, some chopped p-b cups and some chocolate whipped topping for a decorative edge.

Great Great Great Recipe! As other's have mentioned I used Fat free cream cheese, fat free milk and fat free cool whip (only used 8 ounces though) and used a frozen pie crust instead.  I also would recommend using organic all natural peanut butter to take away some of the extra sugar and such.  The texture of the pie was like ice cream extra smooth. My friends thought that I had purchased it from the store. :D PEANUT BUTTER ROCKS

I also did  a "lighter" version of this pie as well as add some other touches. I used light cream cheese, skim milk, and light cool whip but put a layer of the chocolate hard shell ice cream topping on the bottom, then covered that with chopped up p.b. cups, and then for the topping I used more chopped up p.b. cups and more chocolate shell. EVERYBODY loved it, no one could tell it used the lighter versions.

SOooooo good! I can't tell you how good this is. Only changes I made were as follows: halved the recipe, made Oreo cookie crust, drizzled chocolate syrup and crumbled peanut butter cups on top of pie. Delectable! Quick and Easy, thanks for this recipe.

This Peanut Butter Pie was easy to make. I substituted sweetened condense milk instead of milk, and used a graulated sugar. I also added vanilla flavoring. The substance was very creamy. It formed very well during refridgeration. The family loved it, now Im going to try it on my students.

This pie tastes so good!  Instead of using peanut butter, I used melted 3/4 cups of reeses (I halved the recipe to make just 1 pie) and also only used 8 oz of cool whip along with less that 1/4 cup of milk. I decorated the top with peanut butter cups and used a pre-made chocolate crust to save time. This is a great and easy recipe! I served this at Easter and the entire thing was eaten in minutes! People who said they havent eaten desserts for YEARS gobbled it up. I recieved so many compliments that people thought this was from a restaurant. Quick, easy and great!  I hope you like compliments because making this pie will certainly bring them pouring in!

This pie was really good and extremely easy to make.  I used a chocolate crust instead of graham cracker and sprinkled crushed up peanut butter cups on the top.  Also I only used 8 oz of cool whip instead of 16 and it came out perfectly.  The only thing is, this pie is very very rich.  I couldnt have more than a small slice in a sitting.

This was a pretty good recipe. I scaled it down just to make one pie. I used an oreo crust, added a layer of chocolate sauce on the bottom, and added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the peanut butter mixture. Then I stuck it in the freezer for about 2 hours. My husband really likes it... he says it tastes like a giant Reese's peanut butter cup.

I LOVE this pie! I followed the directions except I used crunchy peanut butter and I crushed up chocolate chip cookies & mixed with melted butter for the crust. I also drizzled the crust with hot fudge before putting in the filling. Then I drizzled the top with more hot fudge. I put my pies in the freezer, I don't think the consistency would have been right in the fridge.

This is unbelievable. I put it in an oreo crust, which I would definitely recommend. This does not take even close to how much whipped topping it asks for, so feel free to use between half and three-quarters the listed amount. SO SO good.

It was a hit at a recent gathering. I substituted store bought chocolate pie crust. Also, I think overnight freezing is best. It's still gloopy after a few hours. Excellent, will definitely make again.

Very good but it does turn out a little too soft. Next time I may use less cool whip to make it stiffer.

Perfect. My 14 year old mixed this up for me a day before company arrived. I considered having her use only one of the two 8oz Cool Whip pkgs I bought. Glad I didn't! The taste was smooth, rich & perfect. Since this makes 2 pies, though, I did try one oreo crust and one graham.  Each of the 7 of us had different opinions on which was the better crust.  Too good both ways!

Excellent! Great consistency and flavor. Delicious, quick & easy. I halved the recipe to make one pie, used half & half instead of milk, and whipped up the ingredients thoroughly before folding in the whipped topping. I froze it for about four hours before serving.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Easy to do, and really yummy.  You can eat it right out of the freezer and it is still pretty easy to put your fork through and it tastes great hard or soft!  Thanks!

I only made one pie for New Year's Day dinner. I omitted the milk and used the same ingredients for 2 pies, except I used 1, 8 oz. tub of chocolate cool whip. The filling was very thick, but after reading other reviews, I knew I didn't want a runny pie. It was even great just from the fridge instead of the freezer. I used a chocolate graham cracker crust. Everyone loved it!

I made this for Christmas Day and it was a hit.  My brother thought I bought it.  I only made one pie but used a chocolate pie crust, one package lite cream cheese, one cup extra creamy peanut butter and three quarters of one litre low fat Cool Whip.  I omitted the milk.  I crumbled two peanut butter cups and drizzled chocolate syrup on top.  I put the pie in the freezer for two hours before serving.

I brought this to a poker party and everyone loved it even one of the people who doesn't like peanut butter and chocolate together(which I think is a sin). I did take some other suggestions from the reviews. I made my own graham cracker crust, I lined the bottom crust with Reese's magic shell and crumbled Reese's PB cups and sprinkled on the bottom before adding the main recipe. I also drizzled more magic shell on the top and garnished with extra whipped cream. I also used lite cream cheese, fat free Cool Whip because everything else was so rich and it turned out perfectly. The poker players at the entire pie, no leftovers.

This recipe was THE favorite at last night's pie party.  I used a homemade oreo crust (20 crushed cookies and 4 T melted butter) because I wanted to.  I did add a bit more peanut butter and cream cheese, kept the rest of the ingredients the same, and topped it with chocolate curls.  Yummy!! Will be making again soon!

Terrific! I took some else's suggestion--added an extra 1/4 Peanut Butter, used oreo crusts, crushed 6 Mini-Reese PB Cups on the bottom & quarted 8 on the top of the pie--also crushing some in the center. (APPEARANCES are everything afterall...lol) & also drizzled he Reese candy "shell". Yummy! I gave one pie away out of fear my fiance & I would eat both...lol!

I made this pie for my boyfriend and we both love it.  I cut the recipe in half (except for the peanut butter) and only made one pie with an Oreo crust.  I also added a thin layer of fudge over the crust and drizzled the top of the pie with it.  I put it in the freezer and it was in there for three hours before we ate a quarter of it.  I kept the rest of it in the freezer and it kept fine for 4 days.  I am making another pie this weekend for a friend.  It's so easy to make and so good.

Absolutely delicious!  I halfed the recipe, made my own crust using peanut butter oreos and butter. I used extra creamy cool whip. I also broke up about six peanut butter cups for the top.  Will definitely be making again and again!

Oh, yum, yum, yum!  This pie was delicious and incredibly easy.  I used a store-bought oreo pie crust and used an extra fourth cup of Peanut butter.  To top it off, I sprinkled the pie with peanut butter and semi-sweet choc chips, as well as whipped topping.

This pie was fabulous! I made it to bring to my Mom's Fourth of July BBQ and it was a hit. She is the ultimate critic of my cooking and she loved it! Very rich and smooth. I also added crushed peanut butter cups to the top for a little design. Will definitely make this one again and again!

This pie definatly had more of a cream cheese flavor more so than a peanut butter flavor. I did make a few adjustments. I melted some bakers chocolate and brushed it over an oreo crust, then refrigerated it to let it harden for about 15 minutes. I also used fat free milk, reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat whipped topping and my boyfriend and I still found it to be a little too heavy and sweet. I think next time I will decrease the powdered sugar and cream cheese amount and increase the peanut butter amount. If I could have rated this 4.5 stars I would have.

Great pie, everyone loves it and wants the recipe everytime I make it! Last time I made this pie I substituted the same amount of vanilla bean icecream (Homeade brand) for the milk, This helps the pie to have a better, thicker consistency and still tastes great (maybe better!)!

The filling for this pie was really good. We weren't crazy about the crust though; I like the idea of using a homemade crust or the Oreo crust that others suggested. It was super easy to make as is though. We'll definitely make it again. We served it with whipped topping - good combo. I like the idea of drizzling it with hot fudge and will try that next time.

This fabulous pie got raves from all round the table. I served 10 easily and could have served 12 - it's so rich. I made it with an Oreo cookie crust but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee. I opted for crunchy peanut butter.  
However, in future, just to get a comparison, I'm going to try a graham crust as well as a traditional pastry.  Nov 27,'16 update: have made many many times.  Now make it exclusively with traditional pastry (my favourite is Never Never Fail Pie Pastry)- I prefer the texture in conjunction with the creamy pie. Also, I never use Cool Whip - always whipped cream.  
I don't use the extra pieces of candy.  Great presentation with the chocolate drizzle. I usually make two and put one in the freezer with nuts on top - the  nuts help protect the topping when wrapping and freezing.

Great recipe! I thought the whole tub of whipped cream was needed unlike some other reviewers. The nutter butter crust is great but you may also try a chocolate-flavored graham cracker crust which tastes divine as well. Also try decorating with hershey's syrup in some pretty design, looks fantastic and people can't get enough of it.  Tastes deceivingly light. Fastest, tastiest peanut butter pie by far!

This was so good! I halved the recipe and used a little extra peanut butter and a little less cool whip. I also used reduced fat cream cheese, peanut butter and cool whip. Yum!!

This was okay.  I did as others and used an oreo crust which was good.  I just wish there was more peanut butter flavor.  My husband suggested next time we spread peanut butter on the crust before the filling--we will see.

This is delicious...now another reason not to have to go out for dessert. I only used half the whipped cream called for and it was perfect. I might even make it with more peanut butter next time. Used an oreo cookie crust as others did. Light cool whip, too. It's a do-again!

This was a hit at the office! I made 2 pies & on the second one I topped it with Magic Shell chocolate syrup. It tasted like a cold Reeses Peanut Butter cup.  Both pies only lasted about a day!

My family goes crazy for this pie. I do make a few changes, sometimes I crush Oreo cookies in a food processor, add a little melted butter to it and press it firmly in a pie plate or I just buy the Oreo crust already made. I use Reese's peanut butter and add just about the whole jar. My family requested it after the first time that I made it. They love peanut butter. I also decorate the top with Reese's chocolate shell syrup and I cut regular size Reese's peanut butter cups in four's and place them on the pie around the crust. I'm glad that the recipe makes two at a time because my family devour's them.

I made this for a pie contest.  It won 3ed place out of about 40 pies.  It was 95 outside w/no A/c and it took 3 hours to judge (mine was last to taste)so when they tasted it was mushy, not cold like it be.  I always use sugar free pudding/cool-whip, less fat cream chesse-all that stuff.  We love it

I tailored this recipe up and it was a hit! I increased peanut butter to 1 3/4 cups. I halved the cool whip. I put it in a Oreo crust, topped with hot fudge and reese's cups. And I served it chilled, not frozen. Everyone loved it!

This was such a great recipie.  I made this for Christmas Eve, and it was one of the easiest desserts I've ever done.  I made it while my son was napping, and popped it into the freezer until it was ready to serve.  I did not change a single thing about this recipie, and it was yummy and enjoyed by all.

every time i make this, everyone raves.  it's one of those recipes that i don't think can be improved upon.   use low fat cream cheese and whipped topping and it still turns out great.  i love that it makes 2 pies.  for a little something different, you can pour the filling into nice bowls or crystal and serve with whipped cream.. . almost like a peanut butter mousse

Yummmm!!  This recipe was very easy, and everyone absolutly loved it.  I didn't have any cool whip, so I used heavy cream and whipped it myself.  At first I was only going to make one pie, but then I messed up and put the whole package of cream cheese, so I just ended up doing the full recipe for 2 pies.  Thank goodness I did that!!  My mom and dad alone ate all but once slice of one of the pies in an hour!  I'm sure by tomorrow night the second pie will be gone as well!  Deffinetly a good summer treat!!  A++

This pie has an even better texture/flavour when you make your own whipped cream. To make your own whipped cream - whip 500 ml whipping cream (35%) to a soft peak. Add a tsp vanilla and a couple tbsp of icing sugar and whip to a firm peak. The pie will taste amazing and it will set up very nicely.

Easy and delicious! I did what another reader suggested and put a layer of fudge sauce on the crust before the peanut butter filling. It was YUMMY! I make this whenever we are in the mood for something sweet, quick and easy...in other words, often! ;)

YUMMY! I MIXED UP A PACKAGE OF INSTANT CHOCOLATE PUDDING  MIXED IN 1 C. COOL WHIP AND POURED THAT INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIE. I POURED 1/2 THE PEANUT BUTTER MIXTURE ON TOP OF THAT. I ALSO MADE CHOCOLATE CURLS TO PUT ON TOP AND FROZE. MY KIDS CALLED IT 'REESES' PIE. THANKS FOR AN EASY RECIPE.

A hit with all I have made it for.  Tried it a year ago and it was requested again for the holidays this year.  You can spruce it up by using chocolate pie crusts and use chocolate shavings to decorate.  Very very easy to make!!   Just had to add that this has now been a hit for years running and almost booted Grandma's apple pie from Thanksgiving!!  I have now had to set a rule that it is a Christmas pie not an every holiday pie!!!!

Although the taste was creamy and absolutely delicious, the pie didn't hold up for very long after coming out of the freezer.  However, it was stored in the walk-in freezer of a busy restaurant, so the high traffic of the freezer may have warmed it up and be to blame for my slightly mushy pie.  Either way, it tastes awesome and I still salvaged marriage proposal from a coworker after serving the pie (contingent, of course, on the promise of making this creamy peanut butter dream on a regular basis)!

Yum Yum.  I made this for Easter and my family would not believe I made this myself.  They all asked for the recipe.  I used chocolate graham crust and crumbled peanut butter cups all over the top before I froze it.  Delicious.

My husband (who will eat anything) said it was 'just alright, nothing special'. It was extremely easy to make however. This would work well at a family gathering with a lot of kids...I bet they would love it. I don't like peanut butter very much, so my opinion wouldn't matter!

This is an amazing and delicious pie, and like most women, I'm trying to watch my weight, so I made my own whipped cream with vanilla extract and very little sugar, and I also used all natural peanut butter (absolutely no TRANS FAT) I felt good about eating half of the pie;)

This was SO FREAKEN GOOD, I fed it to a bunch of boys who helped me move, they loved it! Make your own crust though, pre made crusts taste like sawdust.i used mashed up triple-chunk chocolate chip cookies (1 bag, about 1/2 cup melted butter) and made it in a 9x13 cake pan instead of pie plates. I will be making this all the time. Great hot summer day treat! Next time I might mix in some Reese's Peices for some texture.

super pie!  Oreo crust works well and we put some choc syrup on the bottom on one pie, and on the top on the other (messy though, the syrup doesn't get hard when frozen).  The kids also put chocolate ice cream sprinkles on top.  Very yummy, not overly heavy. Reduced calorie whipped topping worked just fine.

Wow!!! This was awesome - sweet but not too rich. However, I only had the 8 inch pie crusts so I cut the ingredients a bit, using 6 oz. low fat cream cheese, 12 0z. Cool Whip lite, 1 1/14 C pwd sugar. I added a thin layer of fudge topping to bottom of crusts as other suggested and topped it off with chopped up peanut butter cups (6 for both pies). This made it both beautiful and delicious. The 8" pie crust is a good choice. The 8 slices are a bit smaller but not too small. Everyone loved it!

Cool, creamy and delicious!  I think this is a great recipe - really easy, fast, and tasty.  My husband is a bit more picky.  He said he would have liked it better if it had been a different flavor, maybe lemon.  I thought the cream cheese gave it a nice, smooth flavor, and the peanut butter wasn't too overpowering.  I will definitely make this again (maybe with lemon pudding next time)!

This recipe has been a great hit with the whole family.  I have four children of my own and my boyfriend has two children.  When all six children like something it is a blessing.  I make it for all special occasions and it's the first desert to go.  Thank you for the recipe.

This pie was yummy.  I did enjoy the creamy texture of the filling and the contrasting crunch of the graham cracker crust.  My husband also enjoyed this recipe as he is a BIG peanut butter fan.  Next time however, I will be sure to thaw it for a little while before serving, since it's rather difficult to cut otherwise.

I have never tried a peanut butter pie recipe even though it is my husband's favorite!  What a great recipe to start with!!  It was delicious!  I used Nilla wafer pie crust since that is also a favorite of my husband's!  It was just super!  Now maybe I can get my dining room painted??!!  :)

I followed the reviewer's suggestion on making a nutter butter crust and scaled it down to one pie as she had also since there are only two of us right now. That meant no milk, less sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla, and 8 oz of Cool Whip. The pie was thick and rich and the crust really made the difference...much better than a graham cracker crust.
And, this was very easy, great to make in a pinch when that sweet tooth is killing you! Thank you!

sooooo yummy! I made my own chocolate sandwich cookies, used them for tartlet crusts, put a layer of Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce (from this site) on the bottom, topped with the peanut butter mixture and froze.  I also used about 2 c whipped heavy cream instead of the cool whip.  Served frozen with a side of hot fudge sauce and everyone LOVED it.  Thanks!

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was a little disappointed.  It tasted fine, but not as good as I thought it might, primarily based on other reviewers comments.  Admittedly, I used low-fat peanut butter.  The taste may have been improved with the regular stuff.  I also used the regular crust, rather than graham cracker crust.  I didn't have any problem at all getting the filling to set-up properly in the freezer.  I enjoyed it and would make it again if my family also liked it, but my wife only ate 1/2 piece and my son only ate one bite.

Delicious!  I only used 8 ounces of whipped cream, spread a nice layer of hot fudge sauce on crust (then chilled before putting in filling).  Sprinkled with chocolate jimmies.

This is definitely a great pie for chocolate/peanut butter lovers (as I am).  I do suggest adding a touch more peanut butter and a little less Cool Whip.  I liked someone's idea about melting chocolate chips and spreading onto the crust before adding the peanut butter mixture.  I'll try it next time.  Has anyone found a good chocolate topping for it?  Pouring Hershey's syrup on it has made it kind of messy...?

Fantastic. I made two of them for Thanksgiving and they didn't last long. This is a super-easy recipe and when you let it freeze it is like easy peanut butter ice cream. Chocolate gravy or some kind of chocolate sauce makes this delicious recipe even better.

Excellent pie. It really does melt in your mouth. I also spread melted chocolate chips over the bottom of the crust and everyone seemed to enjoy that. It did, however, make the crust hard, so I would recommend using fudge sauce. Yum!

YUM!  This recipe has always been a hit with my family at the numerous family functions we have each year.  It is so easy to make that I allow my kiddos to join in the fun.  The recipe makes two pies,  which is nice since the first is usually gobbled up in no time.  For a smaller family I still suggest that you make the entire recipe, and give one away as a gift for the holiday!  The pies are very rich so one 9' pie could feed up to 10 people.

Excellent peanut better pie.  Quick and easy to make.  Also easy to 'dress up' a little too. I spread a thin layer of peanut butter on the pie crust before adding filling and drizzled chocolate syrup on top for a pretty design.

This is just like the recipe my grandma made for us when I was little. I made my own graham cracker crusts, which make it so much better. Very rich though, so don't eat a big piece.

I did what someone else had mentioned; adding a half cup more of the peanut butter and less of the whipped cream and it was great!  My husband usually doesn't go on and on about anything I make but he literally wouldn't shut up about how much he loved this pie.  Next time I may add a little more peanut butter and less whipped cream to give it a richer taste.

After reading all the great reviews, I had to try this but was very disappointed. The first couple of pieces we tried frozen and then put the rest in the fridge. I liked the texture of the peanut butter filling better when it was frozen however the crust was too hard. When I thawed it in the fridge the filling turned way too soft and too peanut butter tasting. My boyfriend likes peanut butter but he wouldn't even finish this. He said all he could taste is the peanut butter and it wasn't as good as eating peanut butter itself. I had to throw half of it away because neither one of us wanted the rest of it. It might have been better mixed with chocolate chips. It would add a little bit more texture and flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I have been making this for years.  The only thing that I do different is I use a cup of heavy cream and whip it up.   It really make the pie rich and wonderful.

I made it with a chocolate graham cracker crust, then followed the rest of the recipe. Those who were huge peanutbutter fans absolutely loved this and it was gone within minutes.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe, as written its pretty much an icebox pie and has to be served as such. I made it for Thanksgiving this year and substituted the milk for chocolate pudding and whipped by own cream to fold in. In my opinion, its now a five star recipe. Two family members said it was the best pie they had ever had. And just so were clear, the pumpkin pie was never even cut.

Really yummy pie! I needed a quick pie for a pie social at church.  We bought 2 Oreo crusts and added a little more (melted) peanut butter. We took both pies to church and there was not a crumb left over.

Delicious! I made it exactly as written and the only note I’d add is to thaw it out a bit before digging in...just like you would do with an ice cream cake. Will definitely making this during the holidays for family gatherings!

I made this recipe using crunchy peanut butter and Oreo pie crust shells. The only 'criticism' I have is that the recipe didn't state whether to remove from freezer and store in fridge or to keep in freezer. We're keeping in freezer, as the original mixture was quite soupy, and I don't know if the cream cheese by itself would necessarily keep it firm enough in the fridge. It was super simple to make and is absolutely delicious.

I used chocolate fudge pudding with this and it was amazing.  I made it for a party so I put some pretty designs on it with Hershey’s syrup.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Super easy to make and I looked like a rock star.

This was a massive hit by all who tried it, numerous people asked for the recipe! Made it twice in one week for 2 different groups and both times I made a cookie crust using nutter butter cookies as recommended by another reviewer (crushed 48 cookies with 12 tbs softened butter). I pressed the cookie crust into a 9 X 15 pan. For the filling, I omitted the milk, as another reviewer suggested, because I have a tiny freezer so could only refrigerate overnight. I used an entire tub of 16oz cool whip with 8oz cream cheese, 1.25c confectioner sugar and 1 cup creamy peanut butter. I'm sure you could kick up the peanut butter taste by adding another 1/2 c peanut butter... Anyway, despite leaving out the milk, the filling set up wonderfully. I just mention this alternative in case other folks don't have freezer space to freeze the dessert!

Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper. Definitely will be a hit for peanut butter lovers!

Made the following changes for my taste:  Reduced confectionary sugar to 3/4 c.  Increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 c.  Was going to omit the milk but found I needed to add a few Tablespoons to moisten the mixture to my  liking;  added a bit of vanilla. Used about  10-12 oz. whipped topping again for the texture and sweetness I wanted. I topped the pies with the rest of the cool whip and added shaved dark chocolate to decorate. Will make in 9x13 pan w crumb crust next time, as they went so fast.  LOVING THIS PIE!!!

I halved the recipe as another reviewer had done. Exceptional results! Family said a recipe keeper! I might add chopped Reese's on top and try making that nutter butter pie crust next. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!??

Amazing recipe. I added a chocolate ganache layer under the peanut butter mousse and it was just like a peanut butter cup. Became my husbands new favorite. Sorry lemon meringue...

It was fun and easy to make. Everyone liked it. I can see by other reviews that you can change it up and or substitute. I made as the recipe called for, except I used only a 8oz cool whip container.  I will make it again!!

I have made this pie several times. I've used low-fat milk and low-fat cream cheese. It turns out perfect every time. It's very easy to make and my family devours it!

Delicious! My family are big peanut butter eaters so I knew this would be a hit. Both my son and husband immediately got 2nd pieces. I thought it was really rich, so whipped cream made it stellar.

Very good! I use only 8oz of cool whip, creamy pb, and put it in a Nilla wafer or Oreo crust. My family likes it when it’s served slightly frozen which gives it an ice cream like consistency.

Made exactly to the recipe....a 5.  I step it up another notch and add Reese's peanut butter cups cut into small pieces and placed on crust and/or on top.  Once I got lazy and bought an Oreo crust....oh my!  Now my family wants it with an Oreo crust!  Also, I only add enough milk to help blend ingredients....so I just refrigerate it, not freeze.

Ohhh WOW!! My goodness is this scary good!  I saw a few reviews suggesting an Oreo crust and I almost did that, but in the end I made mine with a graham cracker crust.  If it were any sweeter, I think it would have been nauseating.  It was perfect with the graham cracker. Instead of a freezer pie, I wanted a refrigerator pie so I skipped the milk and used crunchy peanut butter and the consistency was perfect and held up outside the refrigerator with no problems.  I would suggest keeping it cold until serving though as the coldness adds to the ambiance.  I drizzled Hershey's chocolate syrup in a grid pattern over the top and sprinkled chopped Resses  on top.  I made this and pecan pie from this site for Christmas dinner and we all sat around rubbing our bellies after.  Just wonderful!

I made this with fat free cream cheese, splenda and sugar free cool whip.  It ended  up very decadent. I added a  chocolate top using a magic shell type of topping (made with butter and chocolate chips)  I did not use milk.

I used an Oreo crust:
For 2 pies, 1.5 packages Double Stuffed Oreos, crushed in a food processor, and mixed with 4-6 tbsp. butter. Place in 350F oven for 7-8 minutes. Cool. Spread cooled crust with hot fudge.

Meanwhile, I made the filling. I used 2 packages cream cheese, 1- 16 oz. container of Cool Whip, 2 cups of peanut butter, and the suggested 1.5 c. confectioners sugar. (I didn't use any milk!) When it was time to add the Cool Whip, I hand mixed at first, then mixed with the mixer until it was smooth.

I added some crushed peanut butter cups to the top, along with some drizzled hot fudge. Put in the freezer, and it was great!

A hit with guests, but I think it needs some work. Too thick and too sweet for my taste. I'll try it again with different ideas.

Wow. This was depressing. I wanted a pie, but this ended up being a soup instead (frozen like a brick in five minutes and back to a soup after a few minutes out of the freezer). I only had one pie crust, so I saved the rest in the fridge until I could get another today, but I think I'm going to throw out the rest and use a different recipe. Such a waste!

Easy and best no bake pie ever. It is better frozen solid. I love using a chocolate graham crust and drizzle hot fudge sauce on top.

This peanut butter pie was absolutely wonderful.   I first thought the peanut butter would overpower it.  It did not - it was so creamy and tasty.  I kept mine in the freezer and then served it with a sprinkle of fudge/chocolate topping.  Was so easy to make.  I used one chocolate graham crust and one regular graham crust since it made two pies.  Loved both!  Will definitely make often.

I used a low fat crust, low fat cream cheese, 1% milk low fat peanut butter, and fat free cool whip!
Everyone loved it and took the recipe!   Then I told them what I used!  It was great!

This recipe was awesome! I used the lite whipped tipping and reduced fat graham cracker crust to downsize the calories as much as possible. It was so yummy and light and just oh my goodness. I've made it several times now and it never lasts very long. I can't keep the pies around. Just be warned they're addictive!

Addictive!  I used fat-free cool whip and omitted the milk per other commenters.  It was good after a couple hours in the freezer while still soft.  It was great after completely frozen.  I'll try FF cream cheese next time.

LOVE this!!! I follow the recipe exact except I only use one pie pan I saw another reviewer who said it would it if you use the crust that says "2 extra serving" and most of it fit.  This is so easy and fast to make the longest time was waiting for it the couple hours I had it in the freezer.  My husband love and I will be making several again.  Next time I want to crush Reese's to put on top.

I  made only half of the  recipe and it came out a bit liquidy. I put the pie in the freezer and it turned out great! I added whipped cream and chocolate chips to the top.

This is so good. My husband loves peanut butter so I made him this pie. I added a can of sweetened condensed milk and topped it with Reece's peanut cups

This is incredibly good. Especially with the suggested Nutter Butter pie crust with a layer of fudge. Be sure to give it at least 4 hours to freeze for best results.

Instead of milk andwhipped topping, add 1 cup whip cream (NOT already whipped), 1 Tsp vanilla and leave out the whipped topping. Much creamier and richer tasting!

This pie was delicious! It is a great dessert for summer and you can cut calories by using fat free ingredients.  I will definitely be making this again.

yes one minor change since it made 2 pies I did one with the graham cracker crust and the other with a homemade pie crust the only thing I disliked was the fact that it did not stat keep frozen until ready to serve and refreeze immediately

I added extra peanut butter. It seemed to separate and became grainy . I will try it one more time and also use regular milk instead of almond milk.

This pie was a hit!  I used a chocolate cookie crumb crust instead. Also,  drizzled with chocolate syrup and spread chopped peanuts on top!  I took it out of freezer about 1 hour before serving and the consistency was perfect!  I will make again and again.

Super simple and simply delicious.  Not in the recipe but easy enough to correct.  Add two chilled chopped Reese's Peanut cups to the top of each pie and a drizzle of Hershey's chocolate syrup for the complete wow factor.

This pie was delicious. I used a chocolate crumb crust. One of the other reviewers said it got runny so I only added 1/2 cup milk. It held up very well.  I also got some hard shell ice cream topping and drizzled chocolate over pie. It was professional looking and tasted great.

No changes- I'm not a sweet eater but big hit with company and I love that it makes 2 - I can pull out the other when needed - I'll be making this again just to always have available to bring or for unexpected guests.

This is soooo good! I followed the recipe exactly and got two pies. One is still in the freezer (not for long!) and the other I put in the freezer for about 8 hours, then I moved it to the refrigerator about 3 hours before we cut into it. I also drizzled some ready made chocolate syrup over it and it was fantastic!  The texture was like a mousse and it was very peanuty. I will definitely make this again and again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this pie and it was so delicious.  I tried something different and put it in mini muffin pan in the cupcake papers.  After I froze them, I melted chocolate and drizzled  it on top and returned it to the freezer.  It makes a great treat, I take them to the nursing home and hand them out.

Like some others have written, the flavor is fantastic but the consistency is a bust. If you leave it in the freezer until it's frozen solid, it's too hard to cut but, at refrigerator temperature, it's too soft and is virtually impossible to serve. I brought this to a wedding party frozen, keeping it on ice, but it turned into a soupy mess. A couple of guests spooned some into a plate and tried it, saying it was delicious but messy. So, it has promise. I might try this again some time with less milk (as others have suggested) but if it won't stay solid at refrigerator temperature, it's a complete bust in my book because it's too difficult to cut frozen.

I just made this last evening. Very good! The filling is wonderful, almost reminds me of peanut butter cups. I used graham cracker pre made pie crust. half 2% milk, half almond milk (this was all I had on hand). My whipped topping was partially frozen still but it worked out just fine. just toss the ingredients into your kitchen aid mixer with the whisk attachment in the order they are written mix up and pour it in. Add fun toppings too! I added mini chocolate chips then popped them in the freezer covered for this weekends holiday party :)

This was one of the best desserts I've ever made! I used a frozen Pillsberry piecrust and I put a layer of the Guittard milk chocolate chips along the entire bottom of the piecrust halfway through baking it.  I also made a homemade whipped cream to put on the top.  I did use Cool Whip for mixing with the peanut butter & cream cheese mix. I only used about 2/3 of the container of 16 ounces of Cool Whip but I also only made one piecrust so it was just a really full pie & I actually have about 2 cups of the peanut butter cream cheese mix that I put in a Tupperware for later.  (It's so good, we may just eat it alone like chocolate mousse).  It was seriously amazing and I'll make this again and again!

I was looking for my Uncle's peanut butter pie recipe.  Was so excited to find this one - it's the same recipe.  We've enjoyed this pie many times.  I followed the recipe exactly - it's perfect as is.  I did add whipped cream on top and drizzled with chocolate syrup to make it look more dramatic.  Took to a friend's backyard bbq.  It was a definite hit!!! If you like quick, easy and recipes that will also get you rave reviews - definitely make this one!!

Tastes great! The only thing I did differently was use 8 oz cool whip instead of 16 oz but you'd never know it. It turned out perfect!

This was very good but not amazing.    I made it for guests as an extra dessert since it was easy and it did not shine.   I expected more from a cream-cheese base.     But you can't really go wrong with cream cheese and it didn't go to waste!   I think next time I will let it get to room temperature as the leftovers that sat out were tastier I thought when I scraped the pan clean ;-).    It gets major points for ease and lack of oven- great for summer time.    I did add a layer of chocolate shell when it came out of the freezer.     Also worth playing with recipe a bit to adjust for personal taste.

as for flavor (great) but has to be served straight out the freezer, if you let it sit to thaw it gets very runny.
if the consistency was as good as the flavor, I would give it a 5 star.

Overall this was good. I made it for my husband and substituted the crust with an Oreo cookie crust. The reason I gave it four stars was it could use more peanut butter flavor. I think I will increase the amount next time I make it.

Delicious pie! Made this for a dinner and everyone was raving about it. I'll definitely make it again. However, I did cut some of the sugar out. I used one package cream cheese, one cup milk, one cup sugar, and half of the whipped topping required. I also added a bit of hershey's chocolate sauce because who doesn't like chocolate? ;)

If you don't put in the milk, NO freezing is needed. Cream cheese, powder sugar, peanut butter, and cool whip in a 8 or 9' pie shell, graham cracker, chocolate crust, or shortbread crust is all that is needed...........NO MILK

Guess what! I forgot the milk. I didn't realize till I put it in the graham cracker crust. It's fluffy & great but only fills one9 in. Pie plate.??

Great recipe.  Made it a few times.  I like it with less confectionary sugar.  When I did have buy enough Cool Whip to double the recipe for more people, I used homemade plain, unsweet yogurt replacing half the Cool Whip (but I left the confectionary sugar amount based on original recipe.

Definitely use Oreos for the crust. I like to shave the chocolate onto the top and also melt and drizzle some over the rest of the unfrozen mix.

Excellent recipe but it needs some adjusting. The milk made it very runny. I followed the directions to the letter, and it still was a soupy mess after sitting out for 20 minutes. I don't add the milk. I save half of the Cool Whip and put it on top and the rest of it goes in the pie mix. With those adjustments, its amazing!

I made this exactly as the recipe called and it was great!  Lots of different things can be done to mix it up a bit like drizzle chocolate or add crushed up candy to it.  Yum.

fixed for a company potluck and they were all the rave - they do melt after some time sitting out so be prepared to dive in - regardless of melted quality later, people were still eating it. :)

This was so good!!  I tweaked a few things, but certain it would be delicious just as written.  I used 3/4 cup 2% milk (that's all I had of 2%.  Didn't want to use skim).  Used a prepared Oreo crust and stole the topping from another pie recipe--after the pie had frozen, I heated hot fudge and made a thin layer on top of the pie.  Put it in the freezer just until firm and then added about a 1/4 inch thick layer of Cool Whip on top of that and froze that.  Then piped hot fudge through a plastic ziptop bag, cutting a small hole in the corner and drizzling it in a zigzag decoration on top.  The pie does need to sit out for about 30 mins. before serving, but the consistency is so creamy!!  My whole family loved it!!!  The peanut butter filling is so good, that you really don't need to add all the topping that I did.  I just thought it would look pretty and I love hot fudge!

We love peanut butter so this pie is a must have for the holidays. I make mine a bit different tho, i use 1 (8 oz.) package of cream cheese, 1 cup creamy Teddies Old Fashioned peanut butter, 1 (8oz) True whip, and 1/3 cup sugar. I also make the crust, because i don't like the store bought graham cracker crust.

This pie was soooo good!  I use low fat crunchy peanut butter and low fat cream cheese because that is what I had on hand.  It was fabulous.  We ate one thawed and the other frozen.  Both were irresistible.  I could eat a whole pie in a day!!!! Thanks for sharing this simple yet delicious recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I used my own homemade graham crust -- it's very easy to do if anyone is wondering! Just search for it on this website and you'll find a recipe. This pie turned out great on it's own, but I added a swirl of melted chocolate to it. I microwaved chocolate chips then plopped little dollops of the melted chocolate onto the pie, then used a wire whisk to swirl it. I also chopped up some reese's peanut butter cups and sprinkled them on top, that made it even better! Great recipe overall, definitely making it again!

Very good. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix, and it turned out very well. Next time I will make my own crumb crust.

I changed the recipe to make only one pie as it was just me and my boyfriend last thanksgiving. He absolutely loved it! He kept going back for more. I found it very hard to cut so I had to let the pie sit out for a few minutes and use a knife run under hot water.

Love this recipe. I used an Oreo crust, put a tbs of dark coca powder in the sugar, and drizzled chocolate syrup on top. It was a hit!

This taste fantastic. I only had one pie crust so I cut everything in half and made it for one pie. Only complaint is after I took it out of the freezer it started to melt really fast. I had it in there over night so I wasn't expecting it to melt that quickly but all in all its very yummy.

I read some of the comments about the pie being runny.  I make this pie with out any milk and I never freeze it, just refrigerate.  I use 2 blocks of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar, a jar of crunchy peanut butter, a carton of Cool Whip and a graham cracker crust.  It is delicious, it is rich so a small slice will do, but if you have problems with the 1 cup of milk, just don't put it in, or add a little at a time to get the consistency you want.  I am making it right now for Mother's Day lunch.

Very good!  I halved the recipe for just one pie and made it as is a couple of times but then made a few changes. I used an oreo crust and topped the pie with a thin layer of whipped cream and drizzled with melted semisweet chocolate and peanut butter before freezing. I also added a cookie dough layer on the bottom that is 1/2 cup peanut butter and 3/4 cup powdered sugar.  Makes it very peanut buttery!

Followed the recipe exact and it came out perfect!  The only changes I made was I used an oreo crust (directions on box) and then crushed up oreo's and mixed them into the batter.  Froze for a couple hours, everyone loved it!

This pie is so delish!!  I substituted heavy whipping cream for the milk and it turned out great!  I always store it in the freezer, it never sets when just in the fridge.  Yummy!!! :)

Very good recipe but the hardest part was mixing the sugar and the cream cheese, I kept having little chunks left over

Wow!! It was so good! I made it for my husband and I and we ate the whole pie in literally two days! It was amazing! I tried to make it with lower calorie options; reduced fat PB, light cream cheese, and light whipped cream, very tasty! Good hint though, keep it in the freezer and serve it from the freezer..I originally took it out and put in the fridge and it made it very runny, a lot better when frozen!

Easy and delicious! Subbed low-fat ingredients for most of it and lost absolutely no flavor. My only caution is that it needs to stay in the freezer or at least in the fridge until just before serving. I had it out for only 20 minutes before we ate, and already it was very, very soft -- not beyond the point of being edible, but softer than you'd hope. Still a quick and scrumptious treat.

One of the best pies I have ever made or ever had. I think its my favorite. I gave some slices away to guys that my husband works with, and they are still talking about it to him. I think hinting for more.

I used extra peanut butter, half the sugar and did not add the milk. I only made one pie, in a store bought chocolate pie crust and drizzled chocolate syrup on top. About 2 hours in the freezer. This was simple to make and came out great.

Excellent no-bake pie! I used light whipped topping and neufchatel cheese in order to lower the fat and calories a bit. I also made a crust out of oreos and melted butter. This made the pie taste like a Butterfinger candy bar! Yum!

It turned out okay.  Mine seemed a bit runny even after freezing it overnight and was overly sweet!  Not sure if I will make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving after my sister requested a peanut butter pie. This recipe was light and fluffy. The flavor was not too overpowering and rich (as I have found some peanut butter pies to be). I used a pre-made graham cracker crust and then added a homemade chocolate ganache layer in the base before adding the pb filling. I finished the pie with homemade whipping cream and chopped Reese's candy. The pie turned out great and it was very simple to make. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this (with low fat and lactose free ingredients) for my team at work and it got, by far, the best reviews of anything I've ever brought. One even told me it was "everything [she] dreamed it could be!" :) Easy to make and I LOVE that you don't have to turn on an oven and  heat up your house to make it!

I decorated mine with a Halloween spider and web, but I could see it being used for any kind of event - fancy or themed!

One warning, don't let it thaw too much! It gets messy quick!

Awesome!!! I made 2 pies using ready prepared Oreo pie shells and sprinkled with crushed Oreos. I put them in the freezer until they were quite firm.  My family LOVED this pie!

Gave it 5 stars due to my alterations.  First change I made was I used a chocolate cookie pie crust.  It was store bought. :) I mixed everything together as directed except for the whipped cream.  Before adding the whipped cream I put 1/4 c of the mixture in the pie shell.  Then I folded the whipped cream into the remaining mixture making it much lighter.  However the consistency was thinner so I popped that bad boy into the freezer,after drizzling chocolate sauce and Reese's on top of course. Lol super yummy and way better than the original version which I also made. :)

Great sweet peanut butter taste. I added some chocolate syrup on the top and think it would be even better with a chocolate marble layer.

This is a very yummy pie! It taste like ice cream. I top it with extra creamy whipped topping and a mixture of powdered sugar and chunky peanut butter to make a crumble for the top and freeze! If you are a peanut butter lover you will love this pie.

I was able to cut down on the sugar a lot and it was still delicious. Used all natural peanut butter, no sugar or salt added, and increased it to about 2/3 cup, only added 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar. Everything else was as the recipe specified.

I made this today...I omitted the milk like several others had suggested, I added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter and made my own graham cracker crust. Also topped with chocolate shavings. It was very good with the changes made.

This pie was amazing and deserves many more stars then just 5! however, instead of using a store bought crust i used oreos and butter, enough to fill thinly to a pie plate.  Then, when it was done i sprinkled some oreo crumbs on top.  Delicious!

Light, fluffy pie. No Wow factor here. I used a chocolate pie crust. Make sure you put it in the freezer to set.

Delicious!  Everyone at my party loved it and asked for the recipe.  Update 4/2011:  I've since made this recipe 3 different times all following the recipe exactly except always subsituting low fat cream cheese, milk and whipped topping.  Great recipe for the upcoming summer!

This recipe is fantastic.  I bought mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and chopped up about 15 and added them to the mixture to give some texture.  I also put about 8 around the edge and one in the middle.  Amazing!

My husband is not much on peanut butter, but he really enjoys this. I have made this with graham cracker crust and pie crust. Just prebake the pie crust and let cool before placing peanut butter mixture in.

Very easy and very yummy!  I made it with all low fat ingredients and skim milk.  I did add chopped peanutbutter cups and drizzled chocolate syrup on top before freezing.  It made it look a little prettier!

This pie is absolutely amazing. I made it for my husband's Birthday party and everyone loved it. Thanks for posting this recipe. I will definitely make it again. As an extra touch, I chopped up some Reese's Peanut Butter cups and sprinkled them on top. Turned out great!!

Fantastic! Since I am such a peanut butter lover, I used the suggested nutter butter crust. BEST. DECISION. EVER. :-)

I love this pie and so does my family. I use about half of the whipped cream that it calls for and I just refrigerate it instead of freezing it. Is always a big hit at our family reunions.

Perfect dessert for a hot summer night! I added hot fudge ice cream topping to the crust, then the peanut butter filling, and topped it all with chopped up reese's, hot fudge topping, peanut butter and whipped cream, yum!

Excellent recipe, made as written.  Next time I probably will garnish with chopped reeces cups or a peanut butter sauce for presentation.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!  It's in my KEEPER book.

Holy peanut butter was this good!  I made a chocolate cookie crumb crust, used about 3/4 of the 16 oz tub of lite whipped topping & then followed many reviewers & topped with chopped peanut butter cups.  I didn't have any heavy cream or I would have whipped some up & made the top look pretty.  This is definitely for peanut butter lovers, which apparently I am because I think it's absolutely fantastic!  Now I know what I'm making next week for our out of town guests!

Was a hit at the pot luck and super easy to make.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used a chocolate graham cracker crust.  I also took two Reese's peanut butter cups, froze them, smashed them into chunks with a meat tenderizer, then sprinkled them on the finished pie for decoration.

This is so amazingly good! The only thing that I did differently was that  I use  Oreo chocolate crusts.  It really doesn't need anything else!  Whenever I bring this pie to a function, I am ALWAYS asked for the recipe.  Thanks!!

This is a great recipe! If you don't LOVE peanut butter I would recommend that you cut it by half or more. My family likes peanut butter so I figure halfing it would be enough but the peanut butter was still pretty potent and my family felt the peanut butter taste took over. Personally I love it. Great, quick and easy recipe!

My mother has been using this recipe for years! It's absolutely divine! It's also amazing just in a regular graham cracker crust. It's so rich and creamy. You'll want more than 1 piece but just be careful because it is very rich!

DELICIOUS!!!!!  Great pie and easy to make, however, when I made it..I really didn't add even half of the milk that the recipe called for..and even at that, I thought the pie was really soft..I'm wondering if you should just leave the milk out all together...??  I froze the pie right after making it, but have been keeping it in the fridge since..  Also, to my taste, it seemed really "rich", so I'm thinking about cutting back on some of the sugar too the next time I make it..??  But I will be making it again..!!!

This one gets 5 stars for 2 reasons; taste and simplicity! Ultra easy to put together and ultra YUMMY!!! However, I could not find a 16 oz. container of Cool Whip, so I bought the 12 oz. and it worked out just fine. Also, I chose the chocolate pie crusts instead of the graham and thought that worked out better as well. Be sure to let these set up in the freezer though rather than the fridge. The pies were light and creamy, not too thick or heavy. I would definitely recommend this recipe to one and all.

My family loves this pie, but I use an Oreo crust and a little more cream cheese and peanut butter and a little less whipped topping!  I don't freeze it, just refrigerate.  It is delicious and so easy to make! It always gets rave reviews!

My boyfriend loves peanut butter and loved this easy to make treat! We made two and left one in the freezer and one in the fridge. He liked his straight from the fridge because it was more like a pudding consistancy and I liked mine straight out of the freezer for a frozen treat :)

YUMMY!!  Only thing to mention, because this was a problem I encountered anyway, was let the cream cheese sit out and become room temperature. I didn't and mine was lumpy.  I blended and blended and blended and still lumps! I came on here and did a search in articles and found that the cream cheese should be room temperature.  Learnt something new today!   Still very delicious.

I hate to give this for stars because IMHO it was more like eating peanut butter cool whip than peanut butter pie.  But everyone raved about the pie and went back for seconds and for that I will give it 4 stars.

Yuuuuuuuuuum!!!!!!!  Why on earth did I make this when I am trying to lose some weight?!?  It is SO good, especially when it has been out of the freezer for about 20 minutes.  I had Nutter Butters on hand so I used these for the crust.

Winner, Winner Chicken Dinner!  This was so yummy!  I made 1 and 1/2 times the recipe and used the larger graham cracker crusts they have at the grocery.  But...I didn't read about the 16 oz packages of whipped topping, I needed 24 oz but only had 16 and it turned out great!  Work LOVED this and can't wait for me to make it again!

This pie is melt-in-your-mouth delicious! My husband and kids loved it; Since the recipe makes two pies, we gave one to my brother and sister-in-law - they also loved it. The taste of the filling is just irresistible and goes perfectly with a graham cracker crust. We'll make it again and again!!

This was really good and easy to make.  I used low fat products and chocolate crust.  I made one pie and would recommend that you make a bit more of the filling as it doesn't fill up the crust completely.

This recipe is so simple and yet tastes amazing. I followed the recipe exactly how it says the first time I made it. The last couple times I have been substituting low fat ingredients and can not taste a difference. Make sure you realize that this recipe makes TWO pies. I have put them in both the freezer and the refrigerator and I would have to say that either way tastes amazing, but prefer the firmer texture I get from freezing them. Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was good, but could use maybe a chocolate layer or something.  The filling tastes like whipped topping mixed with PB2, which is much easier to make and a lot fewer calories.    Also, it's MUCH better frozen than if you allow it to thaw a bit first.

my family loved this pie. I only made one so far but I wished I'd made 2 since the first one was devoured before it could ever freeze. Very easy to make and turned out perfectly. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

My boyfriend has been on me to make a peanut butter pie for a while now, so, of course, I came to Allrecipes to find that pie. He LOVES this one!!! I came out with a lot more filling though than the recipe says, so, since I have a surplus of pie shells in the cupboard, I ended up with 3 pies instead of 2. But that's no problem--These will disappear FAST!! Awesome pie, not a lot of work, and very GOOD!!

This is a super easy dessert to make and it tastes great too! For those of you looking for a non-dairy dessert, I successfully made this pie non-dairy with Tofutti cream cheese, soy milk and Rich's Whip Topping (I whipped up an 8 oz container).

I can not tell you how many times I have made this. It is ALWAYS a hit. Sometimes I put this in the freezer as recommended and other times I just put it in the fridge. When not frozen it is the lightest fluffiest - you just want to eat the whole thing. Frozen seems more filling. Good either way. Also good with chocolate crust. YUM

This was SO good!  I used a 10 inch spring form pan and the whole recipe worked very well in that.  I topped with some ganache.  I think it actually would have been better without it.

Great recipe. I halfed the recipe to make 1 pie. I used an oreo cookie crust, added a chocolate ice cream topping layer to the bottom of the pie as others recommended. I also mixed in 6 chopped up Reese Cups.

This pie is really great and easy to make!  I use an Oreo crust instead of the graham cracker crust & drizzle a little warm chocolate fudge over the top before serving.  I also omit the milk.  It tastes like a peanut butter cup pie!

Wow!!!! Is this good and so easy to make.  I used a chocolate pie crust and drizzled  chocolate sauce on top, a little topping and enjoyed every mouthful of it.  I might just put in a little more peanut butter next time.

I have made this many times. It is my husbands favorite. Now, we add a mashed banana to half the batter, so we have one pie with banana, and one without. Both ways are so yummy.

Absolutely amazing for being so simple.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used low-fat ingredients.  It was so rich and creamy even low fat I can't imagine how awesome it must be using regular ingredients!

This is so simple and easy to make. If I'm pressed for time, but need to bring a dish to a party, I always bring this and it's always the hit of the party. Once I brought two to a party and after the first pie was devoured, people literally dug their spoons into the second one and ate it right out of the pie tin.

I made two pies for the girls at my job. It was COMPLETELY GONE within a half Hour. This really is a great pie. Just don't let it sit out too long or it'll end up mushy (but it'll still taste great tho!!!) YUMMY!!!

Really GREAT! And yes, very peanut butter but light and nice. Used a chocolate sugar wafer crust which was nice and moist as opposed to a graham cracker crust just due to preference. Added Reece's cups and put in a 9x13 pan. Will definitely make again!

Made this for some friends for an all girls dinner party/sleepover.  We kept going back for more - it was incredible!!  used Nutter Butters for the crust instead to add more of that peanut buttery flavor.  MUST make!

Super easy, tasty, and kid-friendly!  I crushed up some mini Oreos and sprinkled them on top for some crunch.  It made a nice light, airy dessert after BBQ ribs!

I made this yesterday and it was a hit! I am a very "beginner" cook and this was such an easy pie to make. I made one alteration and used a chocolate graham crust instead of the regular graham cracker one and it was delicious!!

If Dairy Queen made a peanut butter flavored soft serve, it would taste just like the filling of this pie.  Yeah, it's that good.  It's great as a pie filling, but I'm looking forward to using it between layers of a chocolate cake (frozen cake, of course).  Another idea - drizzle the chocolate used for coating buckeyes.

Very easy and delicious! Great for kid chefs! I'm not the most experienced cook and I easily made it with my six year old. My son had help but an older child could make this all on their own. Everyone loved it at our house, I'll definitely make it again.

I added crushed peanut butter cups to each pie before pouring in the filling, then sprinkled some more on top. (I also keep a couple of these in the chest freezer now for future gatherings) Everyone raves over this pie...thanks for a great dessert!

Excellent pie - kids loved it. Even the grown ups thought it was great!! I chopped up reese's peanut butter cups and spinkled over crust then topped with pie filling and decorated with halves of peanut butter cups on top of pie. Yummy -the kids are begging me to make it again...not a problem as it is quick and easy to make.

Made 1/2 recipe and it was more than enough for one crust. Also used oreo crust and sprinkled oreo crumbs on top. My husband said some crumbled peanut butter cups in the filling would have made it better, but only if you love PB flavor. Its good but not an overwhelming PB taste. Others said they added more PB but I wanted to make it as is the first time. Def will make this again, probably in single serve cups. EDIT: made again and added crushed PB cups to the inside. This was a REAL crowd pleaser. My neighbors were infatuated with this pie. DH loved it too.

My peanut butter loving boys raved about this yummy pie! I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced the amount of fat free Cool-Whip as others suggested. Used a chocolate graham pre-made crust.  After the pie was frozen I drizzled sugar free hot fudge on top and added more whipped topping.

OMG very good pie! i used a regular graham cracker crust and it turned out awesome! i do think it is a bit too sweet, so maybe next time i will cut down on the sugar, and yes... there will be a next time... soon!

This is the best pie ever! I took others' advice and used Oreo pie crusts. I put crushed Oreos on top and drizzled it with chocolate syrup. Sooo good!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Good! Super sweet, but good. I used one chocolate crust and one graham cracker crust; the chocolate one seemed to be the favorite among people. I used Neufatchel, light Cool Whip, and skim milk. Thanks! :)

Very good with chunks of Reese's peanut butter cups sprinkled over them or mixed in. Also don't be afraid to try an Oreo crust, tasted pretty good.

This is a great dessert, I took 2 pies to a local function and they "disappeared" -good and bad, no leftovers to bring home -wah! The only thing I did a little different was to use a white chocolate peanut butter, and WOW it made this pie absolutely yummy!   I would have to suggest scaling back on the whipped topping, and perhaps the milk, you don't want the pie to be so "runny".  Other than that, great recipe!

very delicious and easy and also easy to make "low fat".  I added a layer of chocolate syrup on top of the crust and broken reeses cups to the top.  Everyone loved it.

Fantastic.  I had to fight off my brother-in-law for the last of it.  Warning:  You will feel like you can eat the whole pie without any problem.  But don't do it.  You'll eat away your entire calories for the day!

this recipe is great although the setup time is more like 6 hours in the freezer.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it.  It was a huge hit and I will absolutely make it again, but probably the night before.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! This was my first time making peanut butter pie, and everyone loved it! It was a very hot day and a perfect ending to a perfect dinner party! The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter. (People in my family LOVE peanut buttter)

My new favorite dessert!! Super rich & peanut-buttery, just the way I like it!! I didn't realize that my pie plates were deep dish(duh) so I had to double the recipe in order to get 2 pies out of it. I made chocolate graham crucker crust instead of regular. Topped the pies w/a little drizzle of Hersheys chocolate syrup & chopped Reese's peanut butter cups(used 3 on each pie). I DID NOT freeze these-just put them in the fridge overnight. I pulled them out & served immediately. Perfection!!

I've made this pie twice, changing it each time and it is awesome.  First of all, I use just a little less than 1/2 c of skim milk, otherwise it's too runny.  Secondly, I add 1/4 c of add'l peanut butter (chunky).  I also used less cool whip, low fat, about 3/4 of a tub.  Lastly, and most importantly... I combined 1 jar of Smucker's hot fudge, 1 c of milk chocolate chips and about 1 c of sundae caramel, melted it together and poured half in each pie crust.  It is so wonderful.  This is my substitute to Baker's Square, Peanut Butter Pie.  My only (very small) con is I wish I could get the peanut butter mixture a little thicker so it would freeze more completely.

This is super easy to make and it's a great dessert!  I ended up making the entire recipe as written but only used one over-sized deep dish graham cracker crust and ended up with a nice thick pie.  I had a little filling leftover, but that's okay.  I garnished with chopped peanut butter cups, Reese's chips and a drizzle of peanut butter that I made out of melted Reese's peanut butter chips with a little cream.  It was almost too pretty to cut in to, but we did and enjoyed very much.  Great recipe.

As written the recipe was not amazing for us. Yummy, but we've had other frozen desserts that we've liked better. I think I'll play with the ingredients a bit and use this as a base.

This is a great recipe but I did make some of the additions that were listed in the comments.  I used oreo cookie crust, extra creamy cool whip, 1/2 more peanut butter, added some vanilla and drizzeled choc. syrup on top.  I really do not see how the recipe made 2 whole pies!  My family likes them thick and fluffy.  It was a huge hit.

I made this pie using low fat cream cheese and low fat Cool Whip. I also used a store bought Oreo crust, which I highly reccommend. The pie came out delicious, and was very light (not heavy or too rich). Definately a keeper!

Delicious pie!  I even used fat free cool whip and it still tasted great.  I also took some of the chocolate and peanut butter chips, chopped them with my "Magic Bullet" and mixed them throughout the pie; it made it even prettier.

I halved the recipe and it turned out absolutely delicious!!! To top the pie, I chopped up two frozen Reese cups. I kept the pie in the freezer overnight and when I had a piece today it almost had a rich, ice cream consistency to it. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

This was good but I thought it had an overpowering powdered sugar taste.  No one else seemed to think so though.  I used an oreo cookie crust.

YUM! this is just like the peanut butter pie that I remember! A family friend used to bring her wonderful rich pies to our get-togethers and they were my FAVORITE thing! Everyone knew that those were MINE and they needed to get in line after Virginia showed up if they wanted a sliver. now I can't wait to travel home, as an inside family joke I will be toting peanut butter pies into grandmas house! she will have such a laugh! * i did do a few things differently. I used a tbsp Vanilla extract and I lined the crusts with Nestle hardening chocolate usually used for ice cream to have a gram cracker crust and a frozen chocolate crust and I also added chocolate chips to the top.  I hate pies but I love this one.

This was fabulous.  Not too heavy and full of peanut butter flavor.   I melted semisweet chocoloate chips and peanut butter chips and drizzled both over the top.  I also used a graham cracker crust.  This will be a keeper!!

Very rich and delish. I made exactly, but only had an 8 oz. tub of cool whip. I think it was fine that way. Made it a little bite more intense. I think you could add all sorts of yummy things to this to make even better!!

This pie is off the chart delicious! I crumbed one king size reeses cups in it. Top with crumbled reeses cups and chocolate syrup if desired. I only used 120z whip topping instead of 16. Easy and fast to make.

This was amazing!! I took the previous reviewer's advice and used sugar and artificial vanilla, and omitted the milk. I also used fat free cream cheese, and low fat cool whip. A nutter butter crust would have really sealed the deal, but I didn't have time. One addition I make was to drizzle Hershey's Whopper flavor syrup over the top of the pie. It was amazing!!

This is THE best peanut butter pie recipe you will ever prepare...I used this exact recipe for years and lost track of it.  I made it so many times over the years I didn't need the recipe.  My variation is to use a chocolate graham cracker crust and use half and half instead of milk. I also add a little extra peanut butter..maybe 1/4 cup more.  For an extra special touch top it with chopped peanuts.  Add the peanuts just before serving.

Yummo!  Made my own oreo crust (2/3 bag of oreos, 3 T room temp butter and 5 small peanut butter cups mixed in food processor for approx 20 seconds) for one of the pies and used pre-made graham cracker crust for the other pie.  My office mates devoured them both but preferred the pie with the oreao crust.

Resees in pie form! Oh my God this pie is so good. I made it once with all regular ingredients (like regular cream cheese, cool whip, etc) but this time I used fat free cream cheese, fat free cool whip, low fat peanut butter, a low fat pie crust and even splenda instead of powdered sugar and it's still DELICIOUS. Best pie ever

excellent and easy. I used low fat peanut butter, non fat cool whip and a low fat graham cracker crust. Everyone loved it.

Very good recipe. Family loved it. I would shave some chocolate bars on top of it like in the picture. The recipe did not call for it, but it adds the perfect touch to an excellent recipe.

I am not usually a fan of this type of dessert but the flavor, texture and ease of this pie make it a great hit. It really is a perfect option when an impressive dessert is needed and there is no time to fuss.

Soooo good! I used one graham cracker and one chocolate crust. We like the chocolate better. I also only used one 8oz whipped cream (my mistake). This pie is excellent. I think the peanut butter flavor really comes out the next day. Perfect for Valentine's Day. The boyfriend loved it.

This pie was easy to make and it tasted great.  I halved the recipe to make one pie and used an Oreo cookie crust and topped with crushed peanut butter cups and real whipped cream.  I also left mine in the fridge and didn't freeze it.  It was really like a mousse this way and did not hold the form to well but still tasted great.  Next time I will freeze it.

Good and very easy.  I used Oreo crusts and the regular size whipped topping instead of the monstrous vat called for and they turned out great.  The first slice was average, but that's because it was too soon.  It really needs to completely freeze and then it tastes great and holds together perfectly.

We froze one pie and refrigerated the other.  The refrigerated version was almost like a peanut butter mousse pie.  I also used 1/2 chocolate cool whip which gave it better color and a richer flavor.  Highly recommended!

I've made this pie about 5 or 6 times now and just realized I never rated it.  I never change a thing (except maybe adding more crushed reeses cups HA!) and it comes out perfect!

This is an awesome dessert.  My husband is a peanut butter fanatic and he loves it.  I actually made a few slight changes.  I used crunchy peanut butter and 8 oz of chocolate cool whip and 8 oz of original cool whip.  It was fantastic!

Quick easy and delicious. I fixed this in the mini pie shells and had left over filling about 1/3 of the recipe and I stood in my kitchen and finished it off. It was that good.

Holy cow, this was very good!  As other users suggested, I used a chocolate crust and added chocolate chips to the mix and garnished with peanut butter cups.  It is very heavenly, but only for those who enjoy peanut butter!

this is delicious, but to boost flavor and texture, i use natural peanut butter, and add more of it (to taste). i like to use an oreo crust, and i melt semi-sweet choc and pour a 1/4 inch layer over the crust before pouring the peanut filling. cutting down a bit on the sugar works for me too, what with the add'l choc and oreo goodness!

This was amazing and so easy to make. I drizzled some chocolate magic shell on top which added to the taste and the appearance.  I served this for company  and it was gone in a minute.  I will make this again for sure.

This was very good.  My husband said he'd like it with more peanut butter and that he would like chunks of peanuts in it.  I think next time I'll try chunky peanut butter and add a little extra.  My kids loved it.

This is a great pie and easy to make.  I would add 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips to the mix and another 1/2 -3/4 cup sprinkled over top. Also be sure to use a chocolate graham crust for more chocolate flavor.

This tasted sooooo yummy! The only reason I gave it four stars is that it was a bit too soft. Even after freezing it to get hard, when I served it it became way too soft very quickly. next time I will omit the milk. I have made this in the past with no milk and it was better that way.

Love this recipe!  I am asked to make this for most dinners I attend.  I never tell people how easy it is to make... :)  I always top mine with chopped Reese's cups.  I usually substitute fat free Cool Whip and fat free or reduced fat cream cheese and no one can tell the difference.  A definite keeper!

I used a store-bought chocolate graham cracker crust, put whipped cream over the top of it, and sprinkled with chocolate chips. My only complaint with this recipe is that it doesn't tell you what to do with it after it goes in the freezer, like how long does it stay there or when to take it out. I had to call my Grandma and ask her because she usually makes this for every holiday. Either way, it was perfect for my first Thanksgiving dinner away from home!

Made this weekend for a pie fest. I really wanted to like this pie a lot, but it turned out to be just ok. Could use a bit more peanut butter flavor and some contrasting texture. May try again with different crust or some kind of crunchy topping.

Went along with what everyone said and used 12 oz of cool whip. Also used reduced fat cream cheese. Worked out great.

This was yummie! Keep on ice if set out, it doesn't stay frozen long & melts. I took advice on using only 3/4 the amount of cream chesse. I made one with chocolate melted & spread over crust, then a little drizzled on top-even better! I think next time I'll even add a little more P/B. I'll have lots of fun trying it different ways.

This pie is the best! Its a peanut butter lovers dream come true.  My husband is a huge peanut butter lover and will eat peanut butter right from the jar if I let him. He thought this pie was the best he had ever eaten. The texture is smooth and creamy which I loved, but the flavor is not overwhelmingly rich, which is impressive given the ingredients.  Its an excellent dessert for any occasion and a real crowd pleaser.

OMG this is so easy to make and it tastes DELISH!!!  Other guests were right it's even better if you crumble up Reese's Cups and mix it through before freezing.  I used: Fat Free Cream Cheese, 3/4 Cup minus 2 TBS Splenda, Reduced Fat PB, Skim Milk, Fat free whipped topping.  I could not find nutter butter crust so used graham cracker.  It was sooo good. I didn't think it was rich at all and could easily eat the whole pie by myself ;-)

I have yet to try this, but my husband thought it was AMAZING! I used a Nutter Butter crust and only made one pie. I left out the milk and used 8 oz. of whip cream. I think I should have left the milk in and it would have been creamier and smoother. But I will be trying this again so I will do that next time. Thank you!

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half to make a smaller pie. I drizzled chocolate syrup on the bottom of the crust before pouring the filling.  Sprinkled the top with crushed Peanut Butter Cups.  Put in freezer for about an hour... VERY VERY good!  Thank you!

Super Delicious!!!  Made with chocolate cookie crust (about 20 crushed generic brand chocolate-chocolate cream filled sandwich cookies and mixed with 4 T melted butter, then pressed into 2 pie plates).  Added 1 T of vanilla to filling (I use vanilla in everything!) Sprinkled chopped peanut butter M&M's on top.  Froze overnight, put in fridge, served chilled.  Co-workers and family said this was the best thing I've ever made and I've made a lot! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe states.  My family loved it!  I'm not crazy about it, but I'm kind of funny that way, so I'm still giving it 5 stars.  Next time, they want something CHOCOLATE in it!  Maybe a layer of hot fudge or something.  It was a hit!

Another really great substitution you can make to this (especially if you're a fan of peanut butter cups) is chocolate milk instead of white milk.

This should be named the Reece's Pieces Pie because it tasted just like them. This pie was so decadent. A small piece went a long way. I made it with the nutter butter crust and the low fat cream cheese and it was great. Rave reviews from the whole family.

Versatile for those desiring low fat or low sugar substitutes. I substituted 1 (8 ounce) package neufatchel for cream cheese; 1 1/2 cups Splenda for sugar; 1 cup Peter Pan reduced fat peanut butter; and 1 cup unsweetened vanilla Almond Breeze non-dairy beverage. Brought to work and we agreed the pie was terrific! No one noticed the substitutes! Thank you!

Delicious taste and perfect texture....didn't need to change a thing.  My husband is quite the Peanut Butter Pie connoisseur and he loved it. I have tried a few variations....adding melted chocolate (milk or white) on top then freezing.  YUM!

This pie was rich and delicious!  I used an Oreo cookie crust, light cream cheese and cool whip, and added about 5 or 6 chopped up peanut butter cups, and only a splash of milk.  I may try to use a little less sugar next time as it was extremely rich.  But well worth the little amount of effort that went into making this.  The kids and adults both raved about it!

Wow! This is such a great and easy recipe. I purchased a crust only to tip it out and it broke all over. Much to my dismay and horror as it was 9;00 at night. I quickly made a homemade graham cracker crust (first one). It turned out great. I followed the other suggestion and put some hot fudge in the bottom before putting in the filling. I placed in the freezer overnight and took out in the morning to bring into work. It was quickly consumed. This recipe is certainly a keeper!

Oh. My. Goodness.  This was amazing. I used a graham-cracker crust and slathered a layer of hot fudge from a jar on the crust before adding the peanut butter filling. We ate it in 2 days - mmmmmmm.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Fantastic!  I carefully spread about 2/3 of a jar of Smuckers Hot Fudge (without heating) on the bottom of the shell before adding filling.  Then heated remaining hot fudge and drizzled some of it over top.  I'm not crazy about PB cups, too sweet, but this was the perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate.

I gave this 5 stars because it is simple and delicious. This dessert comes together in no time and after some time in the freezer my fiance could not get enough. This is great on hot summer nights when you need a cool treat. I think I would add some chocolate pb cups on top or inside to try something different. This tastes exactly like the inside of a pb ice cream treat and I am sure if it lasted for days before being eaten it would only get better. Truly great recipe.

I have had to make 4 of these in 2 days. Everyone LOVED it. My parents, my bf, my sisters, even my nieces (very picky eaters) LOVED it and thought it was absolutely delicious.

YUM YUM YUM!  i left out the milk and used low-fat cream cheese.  it also only filled 1 pie crust but that was fine because i only wanted 1 pie!  Maybe that was due to leaving out the milk and using lowfat cream cheese?

This is so easy and delicious!  I didn't use the milk it calls for, I loved the ice creamy texture of the finished pie. I also just put it all in one pie crust for one pie. I drizzled it with fudge sauce.  I will make this again, for sure!

This recipe was easy and oh so delicious! I absolutely love peanut butter so I knew this was going to be awesome. I made it for a 4th of July barbecue I had yesterday and everyone loved it. I will be making this again soon. Only thing different I did was to add chunks of chocolate to the top of the pie.

This was such an easy pie. My 8 yr old and I made this tonight.  The only changes I made was that I didn't have any whipped topping so I made some using whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla (whipped topping recipe from this site). And I drizzled a little chocolate syrup on top. It was very delicious! Rich & creamy. Thanks for sharing!!!!

What a quick easy wonderful recipe.  I made it last Sunday for Fathers Day and was begged to make it again yesterday. My husband says it's the best PB pie he's ever had. It's smooth and velvety with a nice PB taste. I did make some changes. I used a chocolate crust, folded in chopped PB cups and covered the bottom of the crust with lots of hot fudge before I poured in the pie filling. Next time I might add some strawberry jam to the bottom layer and use a PB crust like so many others suggested. Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!

I brought this pie to work and it got rave reviews.  It was gone by 10:00 and not everyone got a piece.  My husband and kids loved it too.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

Oh my ohh my. This is a 100 star recipe for sure. Especially good straight from the freezer on a hot day. My 10 year old son made it for a class project and got a A+. The whole class and teacher all wanted the recipe to make for their families and the only complaint was that there was not enough for seconds.

My father in law loved this pie. For me it was to rich with peanut butter. To make it fair I have never had peanut butter pie nor can I eat peanut butter without something with it. So I suggest if you can't handle alot of peanut butter at one time eat a small piece.

My husband like very few desserts so I figured I would try this out since he loves peanut butter and it turned out great. Very quick & easy. I used one regular graham cracker crust and one choc could not really tell the difference. Thanks!

This recipe was great! However, I did not think that a 16 oz. whipped topping was necessary. I ended up doubling the peanut butter to even out the taste. My fiancee and his whole marine platoon gobbled these up!! This is a crowd pleaser and so easy to make!

Wow! This is delicious. I made it using low fat cream cheese, skim milk, and fat free whipped topping and it was still delicious. This will definitely be a dessert that I make more often. 
Thank you for the great recipe.

An amazing pie. Even when melted it tastes great. Used one of those premade Oreo pie pans for the crust.

I FOLLOWED THE RECIPES EXACT...THIS WAS SO EASY AND DELICIOUS. IT WAS A HIT AT A FAMILY GATHERING. I LEFT IT IN THE FREEZER OVERNIGHT AND TOOK IT OUT AND PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE FOR A FEW HOURS. BUT, AFTER AWHILE OF SITTING ON THE DESSERT TABLE IT BECAME A BIT MUSHY.

I made this for my husband's birthday yesterday and we both really enjoyed the flavor, but agreed that the consistency was a bit too runny. I used two Oreo brand crusts and a package of Reese's ice cream topping that had cookie bits, peanut butter chips and chocolate sprinkles for the top. It turned out really pretty and the flavors worked well together. I'll make this again, but next time I will leave out the milk.

This recipe was delicious and I got nothing but good reviews for it. I accidentally picked up an 8 oz container of cool whip at the store instead of the reccommended 16 oz. But the consistency with just 8 oz was delicious, and I think I will make it the same way next time. I think 16 oz. might make it a little thin or less peanut-buttery. I also crushed up about 7 mini Reese's cups and sprinkled on top, and melted about 1/4 a bag of chocolate chips and drizzled over the top before freezing. I will be making this again this weekend! Delicious!

This pie is rich and delicious! I only used 8 ounces of whipped cream, as I liked the taste and texture after adding that much, and once it had solidified a bit, I topped it with chocolate syrup, Reese's PB chips, and a few peanuts all over, and whipped cream around the edge. I also made a homemade graham cracker crust. I took it to a gathering, and a friend of mine who's never that big on desserts commented 3 or 4 times on how much he loved it. He said, "This pie if OFF THE CHAIN." haha Would be great in summer.

Awesome recipe - easy and so delicious!  I halved it for one pie, followed directions exactly except I made the "nutter butter" crust described by an earlier reviewer (12 nutter butters and 2 1/2 tbs melted butter).  Thanks for sharing!

This was a big hit but I did spruce it up a bit, I used a ready made chocolate crust, and added in crushed Peanut butter cups, mixed in and sprinkled on top. Then I drizzled magic shell chocolate over the top.

This was SO delicious, and SO easy! I only made one pie so I halved the recipe. I just put a splash of milk in, froze it for 3 hours and it was perfect! I melted part of a Hershey bar and drizzled that on top just before serving to add to the look. I will make this again and again! Plus, my son is allergic to eggs so I am always looking for desserts that don't call for them - this was a winner!!

As for the filling, the first time i ate it, i didn't freeze it cuz the pie plate wouldn't fit in my freezer. So it was extremely runny and left a lot to be desired. However, that night, i cut the pie into slices and put them in a Tupperware. It was much better frozen! But then again, its melts pretty quickly... i wish the consistency was a little thicker! Any pointers? I really liked the flavor! The best part is that the Peanut Butter filling complements the banana graham cracker crust!!! Brings back awesome memories of PB and Banana sandwiches!

I followed the recipe, but still did not get the consistancy I thought this would have.  It was much more runny and less thick and fluffy than I thought it would be.  No one ate this, and I ended up throwing it out.

People love this pie! I usesd lowfat milk & lite whipped topping and they still loved it.  I am going to try light cream cheese next.  I aso drizzle some melted chocolate on top like in the photo and it tops it off nicely.

So tasty and easy...took this to work for our Thanksgiving meal and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I did what another reviewer did and crushed Nutter Butter cookies with 5 Tbsp. melted butter to make the crust. (A whole pack of Nutter Butters makes crust for 2 pies.) This pie needs to stay frozen or it will be kind of runny.

This turned out wonderfully.  I got good reviews even from the people I work with, who are incredibly picky eaters.  I made it with a chocolate crust instead of a graham cracker one.

I can only imagine what this would be like with "real" peanut butter. My youngest daughter has a peanut allergy, so I used her soy nut butter. (taste is very similar) I only used a half cup of milk and it was fine. I also made my own graham cracker crust which I put into a tart pan. The four kids (boyfriends included and I) went crazy over this and I thank you, Meg, for you submission!

This is excellent but OH SO sweet!  Cant eat too much or have a large piece.  Of course it could be the way I made mine...  I used two 9" graham cracker crust and lined the bottom with chocolate and crushed PB cups and kit kat.  I poured the PB batter and topped the pie with a layer of cool whip and more crushed PB cups and kit kat.  Very sweet but very good.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 1/4 cup of PB.  Very easy and very fast dessert (aside from the freezing) mine was "firm" in 2 hours.

YUM!  You really can't go wrong with these ingredients.  I used purchased Oreo cookie crusts and only used a 12oz container of Cool Whip. Chopped up Reeses peanut butter cups to decorate the top and also drizzled with a melted chocolate/peanut butter combo. Next time I want to make my own crust in a springform pan and make one big, tall pie instead of 2. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe!

Everyone I served this to seemed to like it, but I was not all that impressed by this pie.  There are so many other recipes out there that look good to try I don't know if this one will wind up on the repeat list.  Very fast and easy for the cook making a dessert in a hurry.

I have made this many times for friends and have never had leftovers! I've made the low-fat version of it and nobody could tell the difference. For diabetic purposes, I only use about 1 - 1 1/4 c. conf sugar, and about 1/2 c. peanut butter and actually prefer it being less peanut-buttery. Excellent recipe and so fast!! I love it!

I also melted reduced fat Jif Peanut Butter & semi sweet chocolate chips and put a thin layer on the bottom of each chocolate graham crust. I used reduced fat cream cheese and lite cool whip, and it was still very rich! Drizzled peanut butter and chocolate on the top and slivered reeses cups. SOOO WONDERFUL! Already requested for my brother's birthday "cake" next month!!

yummy. perfect balance of sweet peanut butter flavor.  good frozen, also good on the more thawed-side.  (but i personally think it tastes richer the more frozen/firm it is). yummy.

YUMMY! I thought about making one pie but decided on two and I'm glad I did! It was sooo simple and delicious. I used store bought pie crusts (one oreo & one nilla wafer) and added Reeses chocolate and peanut butter topping at the bottom of each crust. I wanted a little more peanut butter flavor so I added a little more, maybe 1/4 cup. I also sprinkled some chopped Reeses peanut butter cups over the top. It came out perfect. My mixer was broken so I hand mixed everthing and it turned out great.. nice and creamy. This one is a keeper! :)

Very, very good. I will be making this again but instead of peanut butter I think I will try Nutella for a chocolate treat. Thanks!

Yummy! I made it with lower fat and calorie itemds-including the peanut butter, cream cheese and cool whip. It still tasted fantastic!  I also filled the crust with chocolate Syrup before spooning in mixture-I think a little extra chocolate is always good :)

Pretty good. I'm not a huge peanut butter person but I made it for my boyfriend and he liked it. I put in a little more peanut butter than called for and decorated the top with peanut butter cups. It was really easy to make which was a plus, but I have to leave it out of the freezer for a bit before it's easy to cut. I bought a graham cracker crust and that wasn't very tasty so next time I might make one. Also I'd put chocolate on the top for sure next time - the peanut butter was a bit intense for me. But I'd never make a pb pie for me so I am probably not the right person to say that. Anyway, good recipe.

This Peanut Butter Pie tasted so delicious, and it was so easy to make!  Next time, I might put some chocolate syrup on top or use a chocolate crust like other reviewers have suggested.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Oh my goodness, this pie is sooo good.  I was doubtful about it when I poured it into the crusts and put it in the freezer.  I was afraid of what the frozen texture would be but it comes out creamy and melts in your mouth.  My kids and grandkis ate it up.  I froze some peanut butter cups and crushed them up to sprinkle on top.  It looked very pretty and tasted oh so good.

"New best Dessert" was the statement after my husband and the men he works with said after eating this.  I made one with graham cracker crust and the other with chocolate crust.  I know I will be making this many times. I think that I will put chopped Reese cups on them next time.  Yummy. Thank you for the recipe.  God bless you :)

Oh so yummy!  I made it with Oreo cookie crust and topped it with chopped Reeses Peanut Butter Cups.  Next time may even add the PB cups to the filling.  My entire family loved it.

Good - everyone enjoyed this.  However, I have made Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie I from this site and, while it takes more effort, the results are superior.  This gives a good result for the minimal effort.

This is excellent.  It was a hit at our New Year's party.  It's creamy, but the peanut butter isn't too overpowering.  Definitely a keeper.

YUM!  This was really good.  I too, used an oreo crust and drizzled chocolate syrup before putting the filling in, and some on top in a pretty swirly pattern.  I only used the small 8 oz tub of cool whip and it was PLENTY for two pies.  Otherwise i followed directions exactly, I can't imagine using that much cool whip!

What a wonderful pie this is!  I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it!  I used an oreo cookie crust and added in a bit more peanut butter.  I also drizzled chocolate on the top and added chocolate shavings.  It is light and fluffy and the taste is outstanding!  I finally found the perfect peanut butter pie recipe!

I have made this several times now - and my family and I just love it.  Instead of using the graham cracker crust, I crush up some nutter butter cookies and add in a couple tablespoons of melted butter.  Its so good!

This is a very good, very easy pie. I did not think that it would taste enough like peanut butter, so I used two cups instead of one and only used 8oz of whipped topping. There was still enough filling for two pies, and it had the perfect taste. I also used an oreo crust for one of the pies, and drizzled some chocolate on top. It was very much like a Reeses cup.

This was so good.  When I read the ingredients I thought it sounded awful but the reviews made me want to try it and all my kids LOVE peanut butter so I thought I'd give it a go.  Well it was the hit of Thanksgiving!  A definite keeper, I bet it'll be especially good on a hot summer day.  I can already see my kids begging me to make this.  I did get asked for the recipe.  YUMMY.  Thanks for sharing.

This pie really is all the good things people have been saying about it!Dinner guests even asked if they could take some home.I did however make some chocolate ganache and spread it over the top once it was frozen and froze again,and I made it in a chocolate crust.Thank you so much for the incredible filling.

so easy amd very yummy. I put 1 cup sugar and it was probably too  much. I also used a chocolate whole pie crust for one pie and induvidual graham cracker crusts (6) with the fudge sauce in the bottom. Both were topped with mini peanut butter cups YUM!

Excellent, but we prefer chocolate ready-made crusts and drizzle chocolate syrup over the top so it's more like a peant butter cup dessert.  I sometimes add chocolate curls (use a vegetable peeler on a candy bar) to dress it up for company.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it always turns out yummy.
I use a shortbread crust and put a layer of hot fudge sauce down.  Then I crumble up some peanut butter cups and lay them down.  After I put the filling in, I layer more peanut butter cups on top.  Everyone tells me this pie is the best ever..

Very easy.  Reminded me of a Dairy Queen Reese's P.B. Cup blizzard.  Kind of ice-creamy texture.  I added a little more peanut butter per some reviews, it ended up being a little too rich, maybe that's why?.  Added chopped p.b. cup to top for garnish.  I would suggest 1 pie for 10 servings (again, this was surprisingly rich).

Really yummy, I used all the normal "fattening" stuff, and whole milk, to make it extra special for my guests.  But I'll try the lower fat versions later b/c of the review that say it's so good that way too.

My husband & I love this pie. It works really well with a chocolate graham crust as well. I also added a little shaved chocolate on the top for a bit of flare.

This is a great PB pie.   I did not add the milk and did not miss it.   I also swirled softened Nutella into the top of the mixture and "YUMMY" would be the word!   Pretty, too!

Yum!  This was so good!  I usually use regular sugar in my peanut butter pies, but the powdered sugar made it so much smoother.  I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy and a chocolate pie crust instead of graham cracker, and it turned out fabulous.  Very EASY and not too rich.  A+

Really good pie! I made this tonight and it was a hit. I used Oreo pie crusts instead of the graham cracker crust. I also melted some semi-sweet chips and drizzled it on top. This is a great recipe and I will make again. Thanks Megan for the recipe.

Tastes excellent, however feels something is missing. It would be a lot better if some nuts were added in there.

This is a great recipe. I personally have not tried it but my family loves it and I love making it. It’s very rich and it’s also convenient to make, easy to prepare and simple ingredients.

PERFECT!!!  This recipe was so easy that I actually felt guilty.  The filling is so light...just the right mix of cream cheese and whipped topping that it does not taste like cheesecake.  I halved the recipe and made 1 in an Oreo crust. BIG MISTAKE!! MAKE 2 PIES!! They are so light and yummy, it goes quick. Thanks!

So yummy!  I brought this to work again and again last summer at the request of my collegues.  Sometimes, I would put melted chocolate chips or even plain chocolate sauce in the crust before the filling-but be careful that your pan is deep enough!

This pie is so good, rich, fattening, who cares!  Since I am a peanut butter freak I added a tsp. of peanut butter extract, which I swear by anyway when baking anything with peanut butter.

I have made this several times in the last month and it's become a family favorite.   I have always halved the recipe to make one pie.  Just my cup of tea, so easy to prepare and soooo delicious.  I brought it to a big gathering at Easter and there were so many desserts there that the only pieces that were taken were by my kids since they know how good it is.  That was fine with me, I got to bring the rest home.  Too bad nobody else got a chance to try it.  If they did, I would have been surely asked for the recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Terrific! Easy! This was a hit at the dinner table last night.  I took the advice of others and used an Oreo crust & chopped peanut butter cups for the top.  This dessert is extremely yummy!

Our new favorite pie!  This is a easy, light and creamy pie that packs a real peanut punch.  I added to the peanut overload by making the crust from crushed peanuts.  I'm glad it makes two, or my hubby would have fought me for the one I made for work.

This recipe is a favorite of mine.  I am a teacher and prepare it as a special treat for a job well done by my students.  They have specifically requested this recipe for their moms to make pie for them during the summer when they don't have good grades and me to rely on!

Heavenly!  I added light hot fudge to the crust and it tasted just like the peanut butter moo'd from jamba juice.  Rich, but not heavy like some other peanut butter pies.  This is lighter on the pb and cream cheese and more fluffy thanks to the whipped cream.  Delicious!

Excellent pie. All of my peanut butter lovers gobbled this up. The only flaw was that it was a bit salty. A cold glass of milk took care of that problem. :-)

I made this for my step-father for father's day since he is such a huge peanut butter fan.  He doesn't complipment very often and he could not stop talking about how wonderful it was.  The rest of the family enjoyed what he would part with.  Thanks Megan.

This was really easy & very tasty!  i used Oreo crust w/ hot fudge layer.  i also used half chunky peanut butter.  I prefered the texture of partially frozen pie rather then totally thawed pie.  The cream cheese makes it pretty rich so 1 slice is plenty.  Will definetly make again.
