This is one of my hubby's favorite dishes and he really enjoyed this. I slightly thickened the sauce, added more garlic and also threw in some white wine.  Thanks Janet!

This recipe delivers what it promises--quick and easy. Delicious, too! I did add an onion, sauteed it with the olive oil before adding the garlic and clams. Great!

Love this recipe, because it doesn't really call for anything I won't normally find in the pantry. I do add a can of whole baby clams as well as the minced clams, and I season with OLD BAY seasoning and minced onion. If I'm having company, I will increase the sauce with more clam juice, and add some tiger prawns and clams in the half shell. With some chopped parsley around the plate, it makes a nice presentation. Also great with a squirt of lemon juice before serving.

I give this one a 5 star because of it's ease and quickness.  Use fresh parsley if you can and I added onion also.  I sub'ed skim milk with a tbsp of cornstarch for the clam juice to obtain better color and thickness.  Great on wheat pasta, very healthy.  Will make again!

This was very tasteless and watery.  I can't imagine how bland it would be with water instead of clam juice.  It was a little better with a lot of extra salt, pepper, and italian seasoning, but overall, didn't offer much.  If I had to do it over, I would add cream or milk, some flour to thicken it, and some parmasan, onion, maybe bacon...something to add flavor and help it stick to the pasta.

Not all sauces are meant to stick to the pasta.  North Americans generally expect thick pasta sauces and usually red 'tomatoey' ones.  This is a thin version and a good basic recipe for altering t taste.  I add about 2 tbsp. olive oil, loads of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped, about 1/4 cup+.  The herby green flavour of the parsley is a delicious contrast to the briny clams.  A splash of white wine is good idea.  This has been a familly favourite for years. Thanks for your version, JANBLIDEN.

Made this recently for a thing at our church (we feed and house homeless families for a week at a time).  It was a big hit!  I didn't do anything other than what the recipe said, and it was as good or better than I have had at restaurants.  I will make this again -- often!

Very easy and quick and yummy.  I also thickened the sauce with just a little bit of flour and added parmesan while it was cooking.

I thought this lacked a lot of flavor. I had to add more salt and pepper just so I could taste SOMETHING besides cream and pasta.

Super easy and very good!!! My 4 year old ate it without any fuss!! I did add a little flour, Parmesan Cheese and crushed red pepper to the sauce while cooking it, to help it thicken and add a little spice.

I really enjoyed this! I did skip the extra 1/4 cup clam juice but I felt the juice from the minced clams was enough. I cheated on the parsley too by using dried, but if you have it, I'm sure fresh would be better. My favorite things about this recipe was how easy it was and that it uses very little oil - so it's not fatty or greasy. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  The entire family loves it!  Didn't change a thing.  I suggest you don't thicken this recipe.  It is not made for that.  Why do people always think sauces have to be thick?  It's excellent just like it is.  Thickening takes away the flavor.  Just make sure you use the extra clam juice instead of water.  MUCH better!

Very quick and easy. The only thing I'd change would be to make a thicker sauce with some flour or cornstarch at the end.

This is a good recipe and is really fast and easy to put together.  I added an onion and sauteed it before the garlic and then I also added cayenne pepper to give it some flavor.  It was very bland.  I added just a little flour to thicken the sauce.  This is something quick to throw together, but not something I would serve to guests.

Easy and delicious! Really, who can ask for more? I highly recommend this dish, especially on a night when you want a full meal but don't have a lot of time/energy to cook. Definitely add some white wine, though-- it really rounds out the recipe and makes it taste much more gormet.

I love this type of recipe but did a little study last year and couldn't find any canned clams that had more than 1.5 oz of clams. I use16 oz chopped frozen clams (13.5 oz dry weight $4.95) , but worth it. Or you could buy separate Quahogs and steam, chop them yourself. I like lotsa clams, and I make a large recipe, save 2C of the clam/pasta, add 8 beaten eggs, and make a 9" frittata to end the clam orgy.

This dish has a very subtle and delicious flavor. Some reviewers seem to need an explosion in their mouths to appreciate a dish. This is a very adaptable recipe and can be adjusted to personal tastes. When reviewing recipes try not to be a snobber.

I originally got this recipe from the lady who was convicted of insider trading. A pinch of cayenne and a 1/4 cup of dry white wine make it out of this world, my favorite pasta recipe ever. Also don't forget the generous Parmesan cheese on the plate and a high-quality sourdough or French bread to really round it out.

You can always use white wine instead of water if you don't have clam juice....

Quite healthy, I think. We enjoyed it. I wish I'd come up with a good side dish. We had low-fat cottage cheese and that just didn't do the trick. A salad with low-fat and/or low-cal dressing would have been better. My wife had two helpings and said she liked it, and I enjoyed it too. As recommended by other reviewers, I added a tablespoon of cornstarch, which was too much. The sauce became a little too thick.  1 1/2 teaspoons would be just about right.

This had absolutely no taste when made as the directions were specified. It didn't have enough sauce, or clams, and the taste was non-existent. Neither me or my husband enjoyed it one bit.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I use white wine for the extra clam juice and it give a little more flavor, I think.  My husband and I use this as a quick meal when we've been out for the day and forgot to take something out of the freezer.  With a tossed salad and Sourdough bread, it's a real pleaser.

The cupboard was bare since we just returned from my daughters' for Christmas. I used only 1 can of clams and added 1 can of chopped artichoke hearts. I also heated  the garlic with olive oil and butter and added 1 Tbs. flour then the clam juice to make a roux. It was delicious over linguine!

We loved this!  This was so easy and tasted great!  I added extra garlic as suggested but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  Maybe the other reviewers that said it was bland, didn't add enough salt & pepper?  I love these recipes that take minutes to make.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you Janet!

I've also been making something like this for years adding white wine and definitely more parsley and garlic.  Sometimes I use lemon juice .  One day I used the lemon juice and substituted the parsley with  CILANTRO, and that was awesome!

I used Cento minced clams and their Clam Juice as well as fresh garlic,  parsley and oregano from my herb garden and chardonnay and fresh lemon  juice.  Even the pasta was fresh and it was still ok,  not great but ok.  Oh,  I forgot the crushed red pepper flakes and freshly grated parmesan cheese.   Why bother?

Loved this in restaurants but was intimidated to make it at home. This looked so easy that I thought it was too good to be true. Added a can of whole baby clams and left out clam juice. It was terrific and unbelievably simple to make. Husband loved it. Will now make often.

I've wanted to try making this for years as it's my favourite Italian dish.  It turned out very well and I'd recommend it to anyone.  The only changes I made were to use baby rather than minced clams and I ground pepper into the dish rather than use the pre-ground variety.

The second and there after I experiment.
The first time was delicious - I don't know yet what the  next time will hold.

Good recipe.  So quick and, with crusty bread and white wine, a fancy  dinner.

I did add a small minced onion and some red pepper flakes.

This is a tasty rendition of a classic recipe. I added some clams in the shell to a little dry white wine and added the juices and clams to the sauce and it elevated it to restaurant class. This recipe works. Make it!

This was pretty darn good for a simple quick recipe - I was surprised myself.  I did not add the 1/4 cup of extra clam juice. Instead I just rinsed the 2 can out with a little water and put that in probably was close to am't requested.  
Course we topped it with Parmesan before indulging.
I'd definitely make again.  
This is a great recipe to play with and spruce it up with other seasonings that appeal to server.

I made this just as written and it was great. I made it again and added two more cloves of garlic and a generous squeeze of lemon, not enough to taste lemony, just enough to perk up the canned clams. It really is quick and easy and very tasty. FYI for some who are reading reviews; the instructions are to add salt and pepper to taste. I would guess that folks who reviewed this as bland needed to add more salt. Your pasta should be boiled in salted water (Italians say it should taste like sea water,) then add a pinch when you saute the garlic and add a bit more when you add the clams. If you taste as you go, you won't over salt, but not enough salt and the dish really does seem to lack taste. I also added a lot more garlic, but we are fans. The lemon helps if the canned clams seem a bit dull, often, but not always the case. White wine is more traditional, but I don't drink and lemon juice worked well. Additionally, yes, the sauce is thin, it really is more of a broth, and that is how it is supposed to be. In restaurants this dish is usually served in a big bowl with lots of squishy Italian bread to sop up the delicious garlicky clam broth. Easy and delicious! A keeper.

Oh boy, this tasted better than I thought it would! My hubby devoured it! I only added some chopped onion, a splash of milk (thinking it would thicken it - didn't work) and a sprinkle of parmesan (not necessary).  It is thin - if that's an issue for you then check other reviews for tips on that. Otherwise, it's great as is. Be sure to have parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes on hand for those who want to use those, but most importantly, some French (or other hearty) bread to sop up the delicious juices! BTW: I had left overs today for lunch. The sauces absorbed into the pasta overnight making it NOT runny. It was delicious the second day!!

Won't make it exactly like this.  Definitely don't use water or your flavor will be diluted.  Extra Garlic and a little butter helps.

I too took suggestions of other  reviewers and add a little more garlic as well as I bought a can of clam juice and used two cans of clams.  I put a little of white wine and a splash of heavy cream and them added flour to thicken it,  Topped off with fresh parsley and shaved parmesan cheese.  I was amazing.  My husband said it was a restaurant style presentation and taste.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years and it's my go to when I need to get something hearty on the table quickly. The sauce comes together in minutes. I always use chopped clams instead of minced and add a can of whole baby clams as well. I also use a couple of tablespoons of  minced  garlic from the jar (gasp!) -  much more than this recipe calls for, and a good pinch of cracked red pepper as well. Fresh parsley makes a huge difference. I've never added wine to this recipe and I usually use most or all of the juice from the 3 cans of clams , but no more than that. I do think plain water would dilute the flavor.  I also had the experience of a chef (Italian) being insulted by my request for grated parmesan but  I think it adds a lot to the flavor. Definitely a family favorite.

Easy  and uncomplicated,  a basic start that's quick to prep and cook.  Add a little Peccarino Romano, white wine, even some warm cream or 1/2 & 1/2 and let the sauce thicken a little.  More elegant...add small pits and pieces of seared squid, shrimp, clams....hell, just about any shellfish.

Start off with a chopped onion and garlic, sauté till softened; add some Italian seasoning, fresh chopped basil, some white wine, and even some mushrooms will add a bit of flair.  It is better when thickened a bit. Skip the water just use clam juice and some white wine for the base of the sauce.

Try sprucing it up by adding a dozen or two Littleneck clams and a cup of dry white wine when you cook the sauce.  Cover and cook until the clams open.

To make it less watery, add a tablespoon of flour once the oil is hot to make a roux and then add the clams and clam juice.  I also add basil.

I was at a restaurant in Japan once when I was eating a similar shellfish pasta and asked for Parmesan.  The waiter said the chef wouldn't allow it, because the Parmesan would over power the delicate flavor of the clams.  I'd add fresh clams to this in their shells for more wow factor if serving this to guests.

I have made this and it is delicious.  I often will steam some broccoli and add to the mix at the end and often will sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on it.  I probably use more garlic just because I enjoy the taste.  Easy quick meal for any day of the week.

Very easy and delicious. I didn't have fresh garlic or onion (gasp! What kind of cook am I!) but dried worked fine. Also added a little whole milk, cornstarch, butter, Parmesan, and some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. Will definitely keep in the recipe book.

I used wheat pasta too and it was a good combo. I halved the pasta and clams, and the juice in the can was enough. This wasn't the best white clam sauce I've ever had but it was certainly fast.

Thank you for the great recipe - I made this last night and it was great!!  Easy to make, too.  I added a little bit of white wine and it turned out to be great.  Thank you!
