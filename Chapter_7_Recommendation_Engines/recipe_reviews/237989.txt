Made it exactly as the recipe states and received RAVE reviews from my co-workers.

Altered it when I made them again, this time following the recipe but changing all things strawberry into all things Key Lime, and my co-workers lost their minds with joy.

This recipe rocks, and I plan on trying blueberry, peach, and cherry cupcakes in the future! (The icing is amazing in and by itself.)

I've never rated anything on this site until now. I've made it as a cake, not cupcakes and turned out great! Made as is except used fresh strawberries instead. One of the best desserts I e ever made!

I made these for my Memorial Day bbq. They were a  hit  and people commented on them all day! Mine weren’t as pretty but who cares when they are to die for. Thanks for the amazing recipe

I didn't have time to do the cheesecake filling, though I will next time. The cake and the buttercream with fresh strawberries was delicious according to my husband.

Recipe calls for an 18.25 ounce package of cake mix. I could only find a 15.25 ounce  package which stated that it makes 24 cupcakes. So I used 15,25 ounces, Using a 1/4 measuring cup to fill, I only got 18 cupcakes and not 24. I could not actually blend the strawberries in syrup with my electric mixer. Probable should puree them in a blender. Overall, they were moist but other than the strawberries on top of the icing, there really was no strawberry taste to the cupcake. Probably need to add strawberry extract to the cake mixture and use more of the strawberries in syrup both in the cake mixture and the icing. I will try this recipe again using 18.25 ounces of the cake mix this time instead of 15.25 ounces and add more of the syrup strawberries and the strawberry extract. I will need to buy 2 15.25 ounces of the cake mix to be able to get the required 18.25 ounces.

the icing was great, I did not care for the cupcakes themselves.  If i make it again I think I will  do it with butter instead of vegetable oil

Made into a 2 layer cake & made half the recipe for the icing. There was plenty of icing to use as a filling & to do the outside of the cake. Next time if making a strawberry cake again I'd add more strawberries to it. I didn't have strawberry extract so used part vanilla & part strawberry juice.  Different texture than a regular cake.

I added little more strawberries. It turned out to be a hit with the family. Will make it again.

Cupcakes were very moist.  The frosting was very good,not to sweet.  The cupcakes wasn’t as strawberry as I would have liked.  I’ll add  strawberry extract to the cupcake batter..
