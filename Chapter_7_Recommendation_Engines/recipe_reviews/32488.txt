Wooah, this was a bit too thick. I halved the recipe and ended up adding about 1/4 c of raspberry yogurt and about 1/4 c of cran-apple juice to make it a drinkable smoothie. I only added 1 packet of splenda to each cup of drink, and it came out just sweet enough. A really different but good recipe to try.

I used frozen blueberries and raspberries which eliminated the need for ice.  We didn't care for this smoothie. This was thick and oddly chunky, even with added milk. Noone drank it after the first sip. I'm sure this might be better with some fruit juice added.

Mine started off really thick too, so I just added some skim milk. This was ok, but it wasn't really worth the blueberries or raspberries. I think I would rather just make a fruit salad. Oh well, thanks anyway.

This is thick so I added about a pound of vanilla yogurt. Tastes pretty good now. I don't like this too much because the raspberries make it gritty. Overall, this is pretty good so I'll give it a 4/5.

Like other reviewers said, this turns out very thick.  I didn't have grapes on hand so I used strawberries instead and didn't add the extra sugar (extra empty calories).  I ended up using several large splashes of orange juice to thin it out, which also added some good flavor.

This was pretty good but it was way too thick and too sweet. I had to add some milk just to get it to blend. Next time I would leave the sugar out.

Used as a great starting point for my smoothie. No ice, no sugar, and used about a cup of light vanilla yogurt with a small squeeze of honey. Loved it.
