Okay, very simple to make this right; saute' the onions and celery (and fresh garlic- 2 cloves, minced-forget the garlic salt!) in about 2 tablespoons of corn oil until soft. Add diced Jalape√±o, stir and add 2 tablespoons of flour. Cook for about 3 minutes. (It's okay if it seems all clumpy. Just stir and cook.) Now slowly whisk in the chicken broth. bring it to a simmer for a few minutes. Now whisk in the 2 pounds of cheese, but use grated. Add 3 tablespoons of cream at the end. Now you will have a very silky smooth, creamy soup that does not break or separate. Liquid must have a thickening agent in order to incorporate any kind of fat, (such as cheese) I believe the cook here hopes that pulverizing it all with a blender will make it "mash" together enough, and hold just long enough for you to eat it, but it will never have the velvety texture you want for this kind of soup! Top each serving with a little more shredded cheese. Truly very easy and tasty! :)

Anyone with any cooking experience knows that you can't add cheese to an unthickened liquid and expect it to be smooth!  All you have to do is heat the soup; add a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken it BEFORE adding the cheese.  Add the GRATED cheese (not cubed) slowly and stir. It will be as smooth as silk.  If it turns out too thick, just thin it with milk to the right consistency.  If you're not afraid of MSG, add a teaspoon.

if you like hot peppers, you have to try this soup.  It is very good!  I dont have food processor, but my blender worked great!  Very Nummy, and good for my sore throat too!  :)

I love this recipe and the first time I made it I also had a separation issue when I put the cheese in. Instead of cheddar I use velveeta and I haven't had an issue with it again. I also added some white pepper to the recipe to give it an extra kick. Then I added some cubed chicken. That gave this recipe exactly what it was missing. My family and I love this recipe! Thanks!!

Well, I have made this twice now. I read the reviews before making it and made adjustments to avoid the separation issue but I still had it. I used Velveeta the 2nd go around and still had separation as you can see in my photo. Not sure what to do about that because I have never found Velveeta to do this? The taste is great if you can get past the separation. One thing I will say is that if you go the Velveeta route, lose the garlic salt and use low sodium broth because that batch ended up really salty. This one has potential for sure but needs tweaked and I haven't perfected the tweaking yet but plan to do so.

This is a good recipe for the most part but I had the problem with seperation also. What I did was I added half a stick of butter, 1 cup of flower and 1 cup of milk. This helped everything come back togather and also made it very creamy.

Mine separated too! :( I even did the flour trick and still had about half the cheese make a big glob in the bottom of the pan. The taste is WONDERFUL though, so I must give it 5 stars. It is very spicy. I used jalapeno cheddar cheese and I think that made it. Next time I will use half the cheese and add potato. Jalapeno cheddar potato soup? oh yes!

5 stars because I love the idea of this recipe! But 3 1/2 - 4 for how I made it.

Here's how I made this:

2 Cans Cream of Celery Soup
2 4 oz cans of diced jalapenos
1 C of Chicken Broth
1 C shredded Cheddar Cheese
Garlic and onion powder to taste

I didn't have the separation problems that everyone else has, probably because the cream of celery soup helped the cheese mix in nicely. The problem I had was it was way to spicy! As my husband said, "Pthis ith way thoo thpicy!" I'm going to make this again, but only with one can of jalapenos and more cheese. My husband did manage to eat all of his (he can't be defeated by spicy food!) I served it with tortillas and a dollop of sour cream on top.

For those who are having "separation problems" with this recipe, try an immersion blender. I find that it emulsifies most mixtures that would normally separate.  It's so much easier to use than transferring everything to a blender or FP. For another dimension in flavors, try roasted green chile peppers (poblano, anaheim, etc.) They are not as hot as jalapenos and you can truly appreciate the flavor of the chiles.

this soup is not for amateurs... the cheese is extremely difficult to work with, nothing i did (cornstarch, cream, flour, food processor, etc.) helped. I didn't even use half the amount of cheese as the first half I slowly added just clumped on the bottom and i thought it could only get worse.

Taste is amazing.When I read the recipe I assumed it called for velveta because of the lack of thickener. I hate velvita so I just threw all the ing. in the pot ( I used fresh garlic and only one large pepper) I also left the leaves on the celery. Gives a great taste to any soup. Added my thickener ( water and flower) to the pot and boiled for 30 min. Then added a splash of milk and a bad of shredded chz! MY NEW FAVORITE SOUP EVER! And really cheep!

Yes, mine did separate too. So it was not attractive, but it still tasted fine and wasn't to hot for us (well one bite was for my husband).  The soup did gain a little more heat as leftovers.  It is a rich soup - due to all the cheese, but that's what makes this soup.  I rate it a three not because I didn't care for it, but because it wasn't something we want to make over and over again.

This soup didn't turn out well for me.  I had to substitute half mozz. cheese since I didn't have enough cheddar, and used canned jalapeno peppers since I was out of fresh.... but I don't think those changes should have made much difference. (?)   I pureed it in my blender, but when it went back on the low heat for a just a few minutes, it became lumpy and seperated.  Finally I tried adding a bottle of beer and a 28oz can of cooked turkey (mixed in with my hand mixer) to give it better texture, but that didn't help, either.  Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

After growing peppers all summer, my balcony has been overtaken by hundreds (and I do mean hundreds) of peppers that I can't use up fast enough. I've had this recipe in my recipe box for a while now, and I was excited to test it out. I followed as is, however, I did take one reviewer's suggestion into account about thickening the soup with cold water and corn starch first. I too used shredded cheese (Mexican style blend), and I also added a few diced baby carrots. The end result is a fabulously spicy soup (even though mine separated a little bit, the taste is outstanding). I'll be looking forward to the colder months so I can make this again.

Wish I could be request a refund from whoever created this recipe. Do not make this according to the instructions. I made it as listed and ended up with a thin soupy liquid top and two lbs. of chunky cheese at the bottom‚Äîthere is no binding agent. Tried to add corn starch once I noticed it wasn‚Äôt going to work but it was too late.

I would give this 5 stars if I didn't have to read reviews in order to cook it right.  Also, don't double this recipe...I had thought it was a good idea until I remembered that it takes a lot longer to boil 3 gallons of water than 1 cup. :D

Ack!  I had the same problem with separation.  I followed the recipe exactly and got a lumpy mix of cheese and broth, very unappetizing.  Despite loving this soup at a restaurant, I am not making this one again!

I thought it was great.  The broth makes a nice base for a lot of variations.I didn't have any separation issues at all.
I used Velvetta cause that's what I had on hand.
I made sure I cooked the broth, celery and onion for the 10 minutes.  Was almost going to puree before I added the cheese but decided to follow instructions.
I had some cooked potatoes so I also had a potato when I pureed to thicken it up. I also only had 4 cups of broth, but I think I basically reduced everything else comparatively.  After eating we decided that adding some boiled potatoes would be good to give it some chunky.

This was delicious and useful for using up extra celery!  However, I did saute the vegetables in butter and then made a rue with about  1T of cornstarch per cup of broth. I thickened the broth then  I stirred in the cheese until melted. THEN I used my immersion blender.  It worked beautifully and I had nice cheese soup, no separation.

Didn't work for me.  The cheese separated from the soup and was gloopy.   I will continue my search for a great jalapeno cheddar soup.
