We loved this recipe! I do suggest to be careful towards the end of the cook time. You don’t want it to over cook. I made the recipe as is...except I added another 1/2 cup of cheese because we love cheese. I love that it’s a very easy recipe to double. I highly recommend this recipe and will be making it again.
