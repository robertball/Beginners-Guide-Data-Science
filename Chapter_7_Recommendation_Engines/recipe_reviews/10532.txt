These cookies go together fast and are beautiful when they come out of the oven.  I found that I liked them better when they were undercooked by 2 or 3 mintues so when they cool completely they will still be soft.  They do spread a little when they cook so make 'mounds' when you put the dough on the sheet.  I found this didn't give them edges and made them prettier.

Great recipe.  Easy and delicious.  Make sure to remove the cookies promptly or else they will stick to the cookie sheet.

These did not last long at the office.

I lined my baking sheets with parchment paper for easy removal and clean up; and used a pastry bag rather than the drop method to shape like Hershey's Kisses.

Maybe I missed something, but these came out to be like peanut butter meringue cookies, not soft, and very crumbly.  They tasted good but not what I expected.  Easy enough to make though

I just made these. I am glad I listened to a reviewer and took them out 4 minutes early- they were crunchy around the edges but still soft. I was dissapointed that they didn't taste more merangue like, but are by far a great peanut butter cookie- my son likes them better than the traditional ones. They needed so few ingredients, only dirtied one bowl, and were easy! Thanks!

Wow! I love these cookies! They have a great flavor and are super easy to make. Who knew four ingredients could end up like this? Just don't overbake them or they'll end up crumbly and somewhat crunchy.

These are a greeeeat invention! :0  i love the mild peanut butter flavor. This is a great, cheap cookie. I am a celiac and I can definitely appreciate this. I had 2 left over egg whites, and i had already messed up the kitchen, so i did them by hand. WHAT A WORK OUT! but totally worth it. All the people that had them come out flat. One of a few things happened. 1. You didn't whip egg whites long enough. 2. You added the sugar too quick or 3. You mixed the peanut butter too much. If the peanut butter is only partially mixed in, because then you have meringue with like swirls of peanut butter. Yum Yum. They are even good out right out of the oven! P.S. any recipe that calls for egg whites and cream of tartar and says to whip it into peaks=MERINGUE

I guess I might have enjoyed these more had I taken their advice to take these out early.  I baked for 25 minutes and ended up with a crunchy, crumbly cookie.  I might try these again if I ever have leftover egg whites.

These are the best cookies.  Finally a peanut butter cookie that keeps its super peanut butter flavor.  Added bonus, its nice and light and not greasy! I don't reccommend using natural peanut butter though, we just didn't like them as well. Jiffy for this all the way.

Mmmm Mmmm These are awesome!
I thought I'd just give them a try, but one taste and I was hooked. I've just given the rest of them away, cause I can't stop eating them.

Thanks so much for posting.

I used 3 eggs, 1 cup of sugar, 1/8 teaspoon of tartar and 1 cup of peanut butter. It's a fool proof recipe, one I've made for decades. People always ask for the recipe

Brings back memories of my favorite recipe I had years ago.  Doesn't seem to do too well with artificial sugar substitutes, but pretty good if you use at least 1/2 and 1/2.

OH MY!  Perfect cookies!  I made these two ways, one with a spoon and another batch with the pastry bag.  Both were perfect.  I'm going to use the pastry bag for the gift ones, nice and fancy.  I followed the directions for time on one batch and a review for the other, 25 min & 21 min.  Both ways turned out fine, I probably will not make regular PB cookies again these were so simple, quick and EASY!  Thank you for sharing this recipe and giving me a new baking gift to give!

Tasted really good!  YOU MUST USE a pastry bag, or if lacking that, a ziploc bag with the corner cut off.  I was in a mad rush making these for a party where the host was allergic to gluten. I didn't fully read through and just spooned the mixture onto the baking sheets.  They spread out and were like cement. I scraped them off as best as I could, and even mangled, they went SO FAST!  Guess it doesn't matter how they look.  :oP

We decided to split the difference & give this a 3 star rating. My husband liked these & I thought it was so so. We decided to try again but maybe add some chocolate chips or put a choc kiss on top.  I don't care for a heavy peanut butter taste & that was my complaint.

I may of done something wrong but these did not work out well for me. The sugary taste was overwhelming and the kisses turned into cookies by spreading out on the pan.

These are so light and delicious.  Very east to make.  I did melt some chocolate chips down and just drizzle the melted cholocate lightly over these cookies.  Really feels like you are over indulging!

OMG. I am eating one right now, hot out the oven...absolutely AMAZING....this was my first time cooking it, so I had a hard time getting the egg whites to form quickly-took a good 15 or 20 min! BUT, oh my oh my, was it worth it....I did bake them 20 min instead of 25...Um, I'm just not going to tell my husband about any cookies I bake tonight...shhhhh, he'll never know.... ; )

Go together fast and the fact the sugar stayed grainy in the batter concerned me...but wow what an easy simple cookie.  Taking them out a few minutes early left them chewy but done.  Love 'em!  Next time I'll try and put them in a decorator bag to dab 'em on the tray.

OMG - unbelievable!  I too, under cooked them by a few minutes. I can't quite see how you can get 3 dozen cookies out of this recipe but other than that this recipe is wonderful.

What a disaster. :( I read all the reviews before I cooked these and followed the suggestions - used a small cookie dropper to mound them, cooked for less time - but they still came out really flaky and thin. On top of that, I did as the directions say - I immediately removed them from the baking sheet, but they scrunched up and flaked apart... needless to say, I threw out the whole batch. I know how divinity is, but this just isn't the way to go. I guess I'll stick with traditional peanut butter cookies from now on! Thanks for the easy recipe, though!

Followed the recipe as shown when I made these except, I added some milk chocolate chips and only baked the cookies for 20 minutes.  They were so good, chewy and moist!  Can’t believe they are gluten free.

AWESOME. I had 6 egg whites left over from making Hollandaise sauce and decided to try these. So glad I did! I used 1/2 cup creamy Jif and 1 cup creamy natural peanut butter. Next time I'll use all natural -- the meringue is sweet enough without the extra sugar in the Jif. I scooped the batter into a gallon-sized zipper bag to pipe little kisses onto parchment-lined pans. Underbaked by 4 minutes as suggested and they were perfectly tender. Warning: These are irresistible.

PERFECT PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES! These are what I've been looking for! It's soft and chewy (bottom part of the cookie is almost caramely-like when it's fresh from the oven) but when it cools down, it becomes crunchy and crumbly. I shouldn't have used a teaspoon when scooping them onto the baking tray. The cookies turned out small and didn't 'puff out' like what I've seen on the pictures, but tastes great nonetheless. I would make this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I for the life of me couldn't figure out WHY the mixture was so soupy until I saw the date on my Cream of Tarter. Best if used by Mar 2008..LOL. I really wanted to try this recipe so I bought some more, and all I can say is WOW!! I made them larger because of the reviews and let them bake for 22 min. Light, fluffy and delicious!

I made these for our office and they were a hit! So easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as for the baking part but drizzled melted chocolate chips on top once they cooled.

Hubby liked them, I thought they were ok.  I used the stand mixer, that was useful. I used a ziploc bag to squeeze them on to parchment paper. They spread out a little bit.

So I made these exactly as the recipe said (not usually my thing, but I was intimidated by the egg whites and all) and they were a hit. My friends were in fact, in awe of the cookies. Unfortunately, I live in a temperate rainforest (in Alaska, if you'd believe it) and no airtight container can keep cookies like this nice for long-- they got sort of chewy with the humidity. They still tasted great, though, and it's not like there were any left over to fully become stale.

I'm going to try this recipe again because I must've done something wrong. The consistency was great but they didn't spread at all. I used "sweet 'n' low" instead of sugar and I guess I've become sensitive to the taste of artificial sweetener because I didn't taste the peanut butter at all. Also, I think I overmixed the PB and egg whites, so be careful.

These are easy to make and delicious!!! Like other reviewers said, I also prefer to cook them for 2 or 3 minutes less so that they are chewy on the inside... mmhmm!!! ENJOY... :)

These biscuits were the best I have ever had. I nearly ate the whole batch on my own. They were a hit with all the family. Definately best with a chewy centre, don't over cook them and make sure you have beaten the sugar right in. Check consistency between fingers to make sure all the sugar granules are dissolved. If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would!

Ehhh. So So. Don't get me wrong these were good. To me they tasted exactly like Mary Jane candy. They were good and all, just not something I would make all the time.
