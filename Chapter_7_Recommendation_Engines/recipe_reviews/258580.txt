Watery, but great potential...   I made it as instructed except for using brown rice and, accordingly, cooking the soup a bit longer.  (We don't eat white rice.)    It was good, but not great.  The next time I will delete the water and the chicken broth to substitute two containers of chicken stock.  If the family vegan is in town, I would substitute vegetable broth instead.  If it's the voracious nephews, I'll add a cup or more of pre cooked chicken.
