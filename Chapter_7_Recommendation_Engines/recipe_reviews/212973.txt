This recipe created so much batter that I baked one small cake (in one of those gigantic muffin-shaped cake pans) and a dozen muffin-sized cakes. I didn't have any oranges to zest, so I used lemons instead.   I first checked for doneness at 35 minutes and found that the muffin-sized cakes were overcooked and dried out, and my larger cake was right on.  The cake didn't taste like any mamon I've had before, but that's likely because I used lemon instead of orange peels. I thought the muffin-sized cakes were dry and probably won't make that size again. Having said that, the resulting lemon cake from the larger pan was absolutely delicious and won rave reviews from friends even three days after baking. It stayed moist and flavorful (those bits of fresh peel burst into every bite.   I frosted the cake with an airy, light buttercream, and the results were fantastic. I'm not a huge lemon cake fan, but I will make this again and again. And I'll be trying it with orange peel in the very near future.

This recipe doesn't taste like the store bought mamon I've had but it is still pretty good...fluffy and not too sweet. I believe using cake flour next time and folding in the egg whites a little at a time gradually along with the flour (instead of mixing it in with the egg yolks) will create a more delicate cake. I cut the recipe in half and was able to make 2- 6" rounds...baked in my Wilton aluminum pans at 325 degrees for 30 mins. They puffed up beautifully.  The only change I made was instead of the 1/3 cup of water and oj I used 2/3 cup of milk and omitted the grated orange peel because I don't care for citrus flavored cakes and pastries.

These are so light and delicate. They are also very moist if you are careful to not over-bake. I raise the temperature to 375 and they bake up in about eight minutes. They go from still jiggly to done VERY quickly, so make sure to watch them. Using a standard sized cupcake tin and a #16 (2.75oz) ice cream scoop, this recipe makes me 36 cakes. The number of cupcakes will vary, depending on how much volume is beaten into the egg whites and how much volume is lost while folding into the flour mixture.

A  VERY GOOD base for all kinds of desserts, depending on how you fill or glaze it. I made it in one BIG round cake and so needed  a 50 minutes cooking in the oven (last 15 minutes I reduced heat though).
My tiny changes : no cream of tartar, replaced half water-half orange juice by the whole orange juice.
My suggestions : served with strawberries and wiped cream : yumyumyum ! (orange and strawberries fit together prefectly), second time served with apricot jam inside and a dark chocolate coat : yumyumyum again ! :-D

I've made these several times now and they're just marvelous. The as-is recipe nets 3 8" round cakes. I've made the traditional small cake too, and always end up with more than 16 and they bake in ~25 minutes. My dad's Filipino girlfriend brought store-bought mamon over a few months ago and this absolutely satisfied the craving I've developed for them!

My Lola loved these, and she usually only likes what she makes herself. I followed the recipe exactly and the cakes came out light and fluffy. I brushed the tops w/ melted butter & added a little bit of sugar and cheese. Delicious!

I wish I could have given this recipe 10 stars...WOW! I followed the advice of another reader, and substituted the regular flour for cake flour, but added another 3 minutes to the baking time. ( Make sure you don't over bake them.)I made only half of this recipe, and got 3 1/2 dozen regular size cupcakes. Sooooo easy to put together, and the flavor is out-of-this world. I will make these over and over again. Thanks for sharing with us. You made my day!!!!

This is Not a sponge cake. It was Very Heavy and tasted eggy but moist. I was in need of a sponge cake and in the middle of making this I soon realized that it would not turn out to be a real sponge cake. I continued the process and hoped for the best. Did not tast horrible but was not the a light airy cake I was looking for.

AMAZING!  I used this recipe, as is, to make homemade twinkies.  I used the Marshmallow Buttercream Frosting recipe on this site and pumped it into the "twinkies" after they cooled.  Made at least 4 dozen.  My kids were over the moon.  I have a twinkie pan but I think a muffin pan would work fine too.  Next I'm going to make this as a layer cake, fill the layer with a strawberry compote and then use the same Marshmallow Buttercream Frosting recipe for the top.  Definitely a keeper.  By far the best sponge cake I've ever had.

I made it  beacause my mother in law requested to make a cake using her mango jam and  l tried using your recipe, thank you so much it was the best recipe pick , i will keep this recipe and find other ways to use it, it was delicious my whole family loved it. I used half of the recipe and used it to make a custard cake, i  used mango jam in replacement of grated orange peel and mango juice instead of orange juice and water. i baked it at 170 celsius for  60 mins.   The mango flavor didn't came out, so maybe i would use a mango puree instead of  mango jam. It was great recipe thanks again and to the person who made and shared this recipe thank you so much for sharing. More succeess to you.

I used this recipe this summer, and didn't get a chance to review it till now. I still remember how yummy and moist it was, it was just what I was looking for. I totally recommend using it! I was really happy with final result. It's a lot of batter, though; there was enough to make a medium sized cake and several cupcakes. I piped it using whipped cream, and it was excellent. Definitely a keeper!! :)

Made exactly as the recipe directed. Halved the recipe and it ended up making 12 cupcakes. This was wonderful! Not too sweet, yet moist, and it actually has no dairy! So, good for people who can't tolerate dairy. Thank you!

Didnt have orange zest so I used orange juice instead of water.  Cut the baking time to 20 min because I made cupcake size mamon.  All worked beautifully!

This was a great recipe! However, when my mom made mamon, it was dense and rich instead of light and fluffy. Looks like I need to ask my mom for her recipe still.

Had I read the top review more carefully, I wouldn't have my mamon come out so dry. The taste was good, but after 35 min of baking, it came out very dry. As long as you watch the time carefully, it should be very delicious. I would definitely try again.

I halfed the recipe, did NOT use the orange zest, replaced orange juice with heavy cream, oil with melted butter, and vanilla extract with almond extract. Baked in a cheesecake tin for 30 min (about 10in circumference). Delicious!
