Excellent idea!  I never thought of adding cucumber before, but it makes it lighter and so refreshing!!  I add diced tomatoes to mine before serving (after blending of course).  I leave out the water and add a little more lime juice and a dash of vinegar to give it a little extra zing.  You could add jalapenos or hot sauce, but since I'm the only one in my home who likes things spicy, I leave mine pretty mild.

This was very tasty.  I did modify it by leaving out the water and adding a 1/2 cup of Sour Cream, a splash of vinegar, dill, and a couple of jalepeno slices for a little kick.  Very very good!

I also modified this recipe as did Marti Y (on March 3rd) with sour cream, jalapenos, dill, a bit more lime juice  and seasoned rice vinegar. It got enthusiastic raves from everyone at our Father's Day gathering! Very light and refreshing for hot weather.

This was the best guacamole I've ever made, and I would have to say it was the cucumber that made it so amazing! Very yummy!

Oh my goodness, this is delicious! I guess I'm one of the few who actuallly made the recipe as written. Highly recommended! I was tempted to make some changes such as adding garlic and hot sauce. While I'm sure these would be tasty additions, the recipe is perfect as is. The cucumber gives it such a refreshing flavor. The flavors are all very well balanced. I wouldn't change a thing.

I may have rated it with 5 stars had I not used the water. It is very light though and without the water would be great on fish tacos. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt.

Thank you.  This is a great, healthier version of guacamole.  I did it as written except that I used 1/2 cup minced garlic juice instead of water, to give it more flavor.  It came out a little runny, so I would cut the liquid down to 1/4 cup if I made it again.
