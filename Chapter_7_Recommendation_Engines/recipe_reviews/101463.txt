This is exactly how I fry my chicken, however, I have to point out that it is best if you allow the chicken to soak in buttermilk or milk for at least an hour before you go to coat it. This was how I learned to make fried chicken as a young girl in the Appalachian mountains on an old wood stove with a cast iron skillet at my grandmothers house.

Definately an easy base recipe.  You should soak the chicken like Breeze says.  We also add some spices as well to the chicken.  It will coat much better and the taste is out of this world.  Simple and delicious.  Thanks for the post.

This was pretty good.  To cut down on a lot of the fat, I used boneless/skinless breast, and cooked for 5 minutes total.  Very tasty.  When I am up for extra fat, I will try this again with cut up chicken.  Also, will try soaking the chicken in milk or buttermilk first.

Yummy and Easy !!
I agree with Breeze another tip would be to put the chicken on a rack from the stove over your kitchen sink. And if you worry about clogging the sink with grease - Dawn Dish Soap Works Great!  This way the the chicken doesn't stick to the paper towels.
Enjoy !!!

I best fried chicken recipe I have ever made. My in-laws ask for this! I dip my chicken in milk before I drege it, otherwise make as written.
