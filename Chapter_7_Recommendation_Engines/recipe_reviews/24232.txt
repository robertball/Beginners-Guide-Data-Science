Easy to make.  Found the parmesan cheese very overpowering.  If I make again, would probably cut it back to 1/4 cup.

I made the low-fat version of this and it was still fantastic- however I did add a pack of dry italian dressing to give it a little zest, but overall a great recipe.

This is such a different dip from the usual cold spinach dips.  The parmesan cheese adds great flavor.  I used low-fat and fat-free ingredients.

This went over great on Moms day!  I didn't bake it, so I cut the parm cheese (tee-hee) down to about a 1/4 cup.  I had a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach that I chopped very fine and didn't cook (to lazy to drain) and it was perfect.  I also served it with a variety of crackers, which brought rave reviews.  Next time I will double the pimentos as they were tasty!  Thank you very much Julie!

I tried this recipe out a little intimidated because of the low fat ingredients.  In an effort to slim things out for a few of the guests that would be sharing it, I used all low fat dairy ingredients, and you never would have known it.  That's coming from someone who thinks low fat dairy is tasteless.  I used my magic bullet to cream the cottage cheese, and everything was done within a half hour.  There was such a unique combo of ingredients and the pumpernickel smelled wonderful in the oven.  I can't wait to make this again, this was gone in no time.

1/4 cup is   4    tablespoons  which is MORE than this calls for, how can they say "I cut the Parm cheese to a 1/4 C" ????

This was great! I made it for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it!!! I followed the recipe to a T and it was divine! We didn't have pumpernickle so I used sourdough bread bowl and it was just as good!

This was great and was gobbled up very quickly!  I didn't use the bread suggested... too expensive!  Instead I just made the dip and served it warm with french bread/crackers.

Very easy to throw together, and definitely a crowd please. BUT I found the parmesan to be a little bit much, so I only used half a cup instead of a full cup. Also, the sour cream didn't seem to really add much, so I stopped using that at all--still tastes just as great, and helps cut down the calories!

I made this recipe recently for a family gathering.  I thought the recipe tasted pretty good, but for whatever reason,  I didn't get a lot of takers on it.

This is the best hot spinach dip that I have ever eaten/made!  I made my own Pumpernickel Bread, from this site too. Actually, it was my first attempt at the Pumpernickel bread and I got rave reviews of both the dip and the bread! I did cut down on the amount of Parmesan. cheese, as suggested.  I took it to a dinner party and the Hostess requested that I leave the remains behind! I will be making this again for this Friday to take to a coffee party, because it was requested! Great recipes, Thank you.
