After reading the previous reviews, I agree that the dough is crumbly. So, as I was mixing, I added a few tablespoons of unsweetened coconut milk and a dollop of sugar free mayo to my batter. EXCELLENT!  The cookies were moist and chewy. I will definitely make these again!

These were very enjoyable. My only complaints are that it tastes more like a brownie thank it does a cookie, but that's okay! Also, I bought a jar of almond butter and it literally takes the whole jar to make these; which was annoying considering how expensive almond butter is! I also added a tablespoon of mayo into mine for moisture. But all in all, they were delicious.

Really good, I also add a couple of T of PB2 (powdered peanut butter) and a couple of T of melted Kerry gold butter - this way it isn't so dry. Another option would be to add some sugar free chocolate chips. The cookies have a different texture than a regular cookie, very light and airy, the perfect fix when you have a sweet craving and very low-carb! This is one of my go-2 recipes for sure!

Due to an egg allergy, we substituted chia and a bit of almond milk.  These were an easy and quick cookie to put together and it was nice to use up the last of a jar of almond butter from the pantry.  We made them in the food processor.

That was a waste of the good ingredients!
The dough is as crumbly as the cookies. No flavor, dry and nothing like that picture that made me believe they could be yummy!
Disappointing for sure!

Not good at all. Tasted like a super dry, bitter brownie. Took a bite and didn't like it, had some family members try it and they felt the same.

tastes quite good compared to the other keto cookies tried; made almost no changes except adding a bit of butter because I like it and hopefully would make the batter less crumbly. Yes, I will make it again

I have made these several times now with natural peanut butter and Truvia and they're great. The first time was a little too crumbly so I just make sure I measure the nut butter well and slightly generously. Don't overbake...better to slightly underbake.

Added wheat bran to increase the fiber. So good just as written though! I also used Sunflower Seed butter instead of almond butter because I had more of the Sunbutter. I would make these again!

The picture posted is NOT what these cookies look like at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were a huge disappointment. They were dry, crumbly, tasteless, and un-edible...

I might not have ground up the black beans well enough, because you could taste bits of hardened crunchy beans in them. Kids thought they tasted 'weird' because they weren't sweet like chocolate cookies are supposed to be.

Extremely dry, no flavor, not very tasty. If you make them,  do not use stevia drops, use powder. also, do not cook. Freeze them. The oven will cook all of the healthy oils out and dry them up.

Very good choc. fix.   Used 50% cashew butter/peanut butters.  Dutch cocoa, and added a little heavy cream to thin out the dough some.

I followed directions to the T and my batter was soupy. I ended up adding 2 1/2 cups of Almond flour to fix the texture issue before I got it to become a very wet dough. Tasted slightly bitter, maybe the sweetener I used? Anyone else use Stevia?
