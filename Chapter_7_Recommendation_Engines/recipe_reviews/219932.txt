Wonderful recipe, and had a followed it, would have been perfect! i didn't have chili powder in my cupboard, neither did i have a can of tomoates. I did add some carrot, celery, and bell peppers though. I also used fresh flowering oriental kale instead of the frozen green. great idea adding kale to the chili! Thank you!!

Pretty yummy and a great way to use kale! I used "rotel" tomatoes instead of plain diced, fresh kale instead of frozen, threw in some garlic with the onion, no cream and whatever chili-type seasonings I had laying around (cumin, paprika etc). Came out great. But noticed the kale ended up soaking up the flavors more than anything else (kale was pretty spicy, while broth and beans mild).

This was so easy to make on a night I really was too tired to cook anything with a lot of effort. I skipped the kale since my husband does not like it, and added green bell peppers and corn! I also used soy black beans which added a nice flavor to the chili. Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this, but hubby complained about the kale while he ate a big bowl... So normal meal times in my house!  I modified the recipe based on what I had, but I think still stayed true to recipe.  I had dry white beans, so I started them in the crock pot the night before with some chicken broth, and added the onion and garlic (no garlic and herb seasoning), half the chili powder, and a generous amount of cumin.  The next morning I proceeded with the recipe as written, adding kale, the rest of the chili powder, etc., and letting it slow cook for about 6 1/2 more hours.  I did use fresh kale, about 4 or 5 cups, rather than frozen pre-cooked, and left out the salt because of all the broth I used.  Because of dietary issues, I also subbed a brick of softened low fat cream cheese for the cream.  Saved on fat, and the blood sugar problems of lactose.  I garnished with a shredded queso and sliced avocado.  Thanks for sharing!  And tho the recipe didn't specify, I did not drain my tomatoes when I added them.

I have been wanting to make this for a while. I finally did last night. I turned out better than expected!! 
I did make some changes to the recipe:  I add carrot and celery and cooked the veggies and onion in the slow cooker because I wanted all the flavors in the chili (it also made it a one pot dish. instead of using cream to thicken it I pureed halve the beans and added a little corn starch. At the end I added a little brown sugar and cinnamon to make it sweet and spicy. I think the only thing I would change for next time is to add some cream corn to it.

I can't pinpoint it, but I didn't love it. Made exactly as it says, except for I added 3/4 c. of frozen corn.

I thought this was a good recipe for a one pot meal.  I substituted fat free evaporated milk for the heavy cream.  It has the same thickening/creaming without all the fat.  I also only used 3 cups of broth.  In addition, I added cumin instead of the herb mix and added corn.

I made this tonight for my family and we all loved it.  I did not have garlic and herb seasoning so used cumin instead.  I omited the heavy cream but served with cheese and sour cream.  I used a bunch of fresh turnip greens - instead of chopping them I blended them with some of the chicken stock in my vitamix.  Our only "complaint" was that this ended up more watery than we prefer (and I didn't want to transfer it to the stove to reduce it).  I think next time I will cut the chicken stock in half.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Made the recipe as written and it wasn't very flavorful - which is fine by me because I don't like spicy.  I liked that it incorporated the kale (it's so good for you and the kids had no idea it was there).  Easy to throw together for a weeknight dinner.  Thanks!

Made this pretty much exactly as is (but used minced garlic and cumin, as suggested by others) and approximated spice measurements. Even the kids loved it!

This is delicious, although I wouldn't call it a chili. It's more of a soup. I would half the broth if I wanted it to be more of a chili consistency, but I thought it was delicious as is. The only thing I changed was that I used frozen spinach instead of kale, added 2 tsp of salt. I will definitely be making this again!

This was really good.  I added garbanzo beans along with the white and black beans, one can of each.  Kale would've been good, but I didn't have any so I used frozen collard greens instead. I sautéed garlic with the onion and added frozen chicken breasts straight from the freezer.  I don't have any garlic and herb seasoning (and have no idea what's in it), so I generously added some garlic powder and a sprinkle of oregano.

This is one of my favorites. Please don't skip the cream, it makes it more delicious.  Easy to make and still great if you need to substitute some ingredients.

I did the lazy version of this- skipped the sautéed onions and just threw everything else in the crockpot. I used fresh kale and just tore it up into the crockpot. I added a bunch of cayenne and just realized I never added the cream, oops! But this was easy, pretty tasty, and healthy with leaving out the cream.

I made this as written.  It was okay but lacking in flavor.  I had to doctor it up with additional seasonings including garlic powder.  I then served it with cheese on top.  That made it much better.  It has potential,  so people who like adding their own twist should definitely make this and add all they want.

This is a great, versatile recipe.  I had a can of seasoned black beans that I used without draining, and then another can of black beans.  I used 1 can of white kidney beans and then that was plenty of beans!  Used a can of Rotel and a can of stewed tomatoes.  I only used 3 cups of liquid and that was more than enough.  Threw in some oregano and cumin and it was delicious!  I've made this twice - once using kale and once using a combo of swiss chard and spinach.  I prefer the kale.  I always use fresh and throw it in about an hour prior to dinner time.  I don't add the heavy cream.

We liked this recipe quite well. We sustituted sweet potato cubes for the canned beans and also added green chiles for extra chili flavor. Wonderful!

Had to make a few changes: Used 2C broth, added about a cup of frozen corn, cooked fresh kale with the onion, used fresh garlic (cooked with the onion/kale) and my own mix of herbs, and used a can of evap milk instead of cream.  This was good, but just a teeny bit bland.  It could really use the addition of a jalepeno, or more chili powder, or some hot sauce to bump up the flavor more to our taste.  A good way to use kale, though, and it is tasty.  My slow cooker was only big enough for 2C of broth and I think it would be too watery for us with 4C anyway.

Loved this. I used corn instead of black beans and did not add the heavy cream. Also used fresh kale. And I made on the stove - not in a slow cooker. Will definitely make again!

I love this after spicing it up.  I add a couple of jalepenos in addition to increasing the chili powder and the garlic and herb seasoning by 50-100%.  It's one of my faves!

This is wonderful. I just used a can of drained turnip greens instead of kale and used rotel tomatoes. I had some turned up noses when I told what it had in it but after my family tried it, they requested I make it again.

This was good, but a little too soupy for me.  Next time I will only add enough broth to cover the chicken, maybe half the amount called for.  I made a few changes, based on what I had on hand/preferred:  I used 1 box of drained frozen spinach in place of kale (did not have kale), used onion powder in place of onion, and used 1 can each of white and black beans instead of measuring 2 cups each.
