Very good whole wheat waffle and nothing beats the fresh blackberries.  I will make this again.  If you are too lazy to make the sauce try the waffles with a bit of maple syrup on top with fresh blackberries.  The flavors are incredible.  I did add a bit of vanilla to the batter when I've made this.

These were good.  Pretty light considering they are whole wheat.  I added about 3/4 tbsp of cinnamon, 1tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tbsp of sugar to the waffle mix.  This recipe makes about 8 classic waffles and are quite filling, for my family of 4 I could have made 1/2 a batch..  The black berry syrup is tasty - I used frozen berries and it worked out fine.  I accidentally let my syrup cook too long so it turned to jelly but I just added a little water.  My daughter liked these and she doesn't usually like waffles.

We love the blackberry sauce, Yum!  The waffles were delicious too.  I did add a heaping tablespoon of sugar to the waffle mix though and also added the optional cinnamon and vanilla extract and I'm glad I did.  The family loved these waffles!  Next time I might cut back to 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of a tablespoon because the cinnamon was a hint strong. The blackberry sauce was perfect!  We will definitely be making these again.  Thanks danae
