Made this today for Easter dinner. WAAAAY too sweet and buttery.  Would be so much better with half the sugar and butter, and twice the apples.  The flavor was good, just too rich and sweet.  The Grape Nuts is a good addition though.....oh well.  :/

Excellent apple crisp!!  I watched the video of Chef John preparing it and went exclusively on my own measurements (before I found the written recipe) and it turned out absolutely fabulous!  I added 1 1/2 lemon juice and more cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla. I highly recommend this recipe!  So good with vanilla ice cream!!

I used berries instead of apples but followed the recipe exactly for the crisp topping. Was a little disappointed. Don't think it was very good... First, it wasn't near enough to cover the 2 qt baking dish. I had to double the recipe to cover it and I thought the Grape Nuts became soggy instead...

This is the best apple crisp I have ever made.....Great great great recipe. I was thinking of using the topping on my sweet potato pie for the holidays cant wait to try it. This crisp did not last long in my house. If your a big apple crisp fan you have to try this recipe.

This recipe is simple and delicious.  I did not have any Grape Nuts cereal so substituted some oat cereal and walnuts after chopping them in the food chopper. Cooking the apples in a frying pan with the sauce before putting it in the oven really sped up the cooking time. Everyone enjoyed this dessert!

This was my first apple crisp to make, yet not eat.. and it was fabulous!  I am in canada and we do not have grape nuts sold in our city.. so I usedKellogg's Special K ...low fat granola Cereal... and I didnt know it was low fat till right now when i got the box to let you know what I used...lol so needless to say my two kids did not even notice.

I really liked this srispier topping in this recipe. I used peaches instead of apples and it came out very well. I added the melted butter to the sauce instead of to the topping and it worked great.

I made this recipe & the 2 qt baking dish isn't big enough ... it needed a 9x13.  It was really good, but I will use the larger baking dish in the future.

This is FANTASTIC!  Who ever thought Grape-Nuts could taste so good?  After loving it as a crisp we've started putting the topping on fruit pies as well.  A household favourite!

I made this and it was sweet and delicious. I didn’t have grapenuts, but I used Chef John’s technique of cooking the apples in butter and sugar before assembling the dish. I will try it with grapenuts next time! I also used female apples. Granny Smiths and Pink Ladies. Hahaha!!  It was amazing. Chef John is my “go to” recipe provider! Thank you!

Great Recipe.  I have food allergies so I substituted coconut oil for butter, quinoa flour for all purpose, and Enjoy Life Crunch Flax cereal for Grapenuts.  I used Cortland apples so I cut out the 1/4 C white sugar for the topping.  I thought it was still very sweet.  Tasted best after being chilled.  I used a 9 inch deep dish glass pie dish to bake in.  It ended up boiling over a little on me, so placed a dark pan under to catch the drippings.  Looked beautiful.

Excellent for breakfast or dessert. Our RCIA class just loved it.  I made it extra and use whole wheat flour and All Brand Buds. No one was the wiser. They just wanted more.

The grapenuts didn't soften and were to hard for me. I like the fact that Chef John had a very unique recipe, but I won't make this ever again, as I don't think my teeth can take it.  I also cut the sugar to half the amount and that was plenty of sugar for this recipe.  I don't like eating apple crisp where the only thing you can taste is sugar.

I tried this and loved it.  I didn't have any cereal such as Grape-Nuts so I substituted granola and cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup (the granola was sweet).  I used a mix of cortland apples and granny smith because I like a bit of tartness.  It's an outstanding recipe.  The crunch is excellent!

Made it for my family because me and my children love it. My husband hates cooked apples. Even HE loved it and that's saying something. Kept it in the fridge and when wanted some heated it up in the microwave for a min and put some ice cream on it and it was STILL crispy after being microwaved. great recipe! Going to try to make peach crisp with it now.

This was very good, and I like that the topping was crunchy (I used All-Bran Bran Buds for the cereal), but I think it could have had double the amount of apples for the amount of topping. The recipe says to use a 2-quart baking dish; I used a 1-1/2 quart casserole, which was too big. I increased the amount of cinnamon from 1/4 tsp. to 1 tsp. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt to the topping. Definitely serve hot with vanilla ice cream!

This was so yummy! I put a lid over the apples when cooking them to help soften them faster. Usually we end up having to throw out larger recipes like this because it's just two of us, but we ate all of this.

Turned out great. Only change was I added chopped pecans and walnuts to the topping, as I love nuts in anything.

Overall a great recipe! I took some of the other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the cinnamon, used slightly less sugar, a bit more apple, and skipped cooking the apples on the stove (less mess!). Instead, I mixed the sugars & cinnamon with the apples & lemon in a bowl, poured it into the casserole dish, dropped some pats of butter on top, and then topped with the crunchy topping mixture. Baked for 40 minutes until the edges were bubbling and it was perfectly done! Deliciously crunchy top and soft sweet apples underneath. I served with vanilla bean ice cream to cut the sweetness a bit. I probably could've used a few more apples (keeping in mind I was using freshly picked McIntosh that were on the smaller side). This will be my new default apple crisp recipe moving forward - you can't beat the crunch!

I’ll definitely make this again!!! It was so tasty, and the topping was certainly crispy.

I doubled the ingredients for the topping, and used 6 big Gala Apples as I was using a larger baking pan. I also couldn’t find Grape Nut cereal, so I used some crushed up granola instead. If anything I might reduce the amount of butter and sugar the next time around, and possibly less of the juice from the apple sugar mix.

It was delicious however the pan was too hot and my sugars in the pan turned hard. It was basically unusable (my mistake) in the pie dish. Flavor was still very good. I'll give it a try again.

I've made this exact recipe numerous times.  Tonight I'll be making again for our Thanksgiving desert.
There are many good deserts this is one of the best in my opinion.

My family absolutely loved this! I did modify it just a bit based on feedback from someone else that made it. I doubled the recipe so it could go in a 9 x 13 glass baking dish. I went with 7 large apples and doubled the ingredients for the topping.  Since someone said it was very sweet, I doubled the amount of water and cinnamon to the filling but didn't increase the sugar. It was just perfect!.  Didn't even need ice cream, but we added it anyway!

This was way too sweet for us (even though I added an extra apple). I also thought that there was too much topping. I liked the grape nuts though

I love this recipe. The only thing I changed was the grape nuts. They didn't taste that good to me so I used Honey Bunches Of Oats Granola ( Crunchy Honey Roasted). I just crushed them up a little so they would be smaller pieces. My family loved this apple crisp.

Didn't have grape nuts so just added more oats. Came out so delicious but a little too sweet for me.  I will definitely make again but will cut back on the sugar.

This is hands down the very BEST apple crisp recipe I have ever made! Chef John never disappoints! Adding the Grape Nuts is brilliant. For those who said the recipe is too sweet, remember that you should always use tart apples for an apple crisp recipe. I used a combination of Granny Smith and Macintosh. It was incredible! My only tweak was to add a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the topping. I can't wait to make this again!

The flavor  and texture of the apples are heavenly. Though very crunchy the Grape Nuts gave the topping too much of a "grain" flavor for my tastes.

Very, very good. And the crisp was the crispiest I've ever tasted. I stuck to the recipe with only one suggestion:  I sprinkled about one third cup of chopped pecans over the topping before baking. The result was fantastic!

Super yummy recipe and it cuts baking time in 1/2!  It's a little sweet so I like to use tart apples when I make it.  It's always been a big hit, everyone loves the extra "secret ingredient" crunch!

THIS WAS GREAT! I have to admit that I only made the crisp part as we had prepared frozen apples already. My review is essentially for the crisp. I had never thought to add GrapeNuts to a crisp before. AWESOME idea! The only thing I changed is that I added another 1/2c of both the oats and GrapeNuts (I like my crisp really dry and crunchy). I think I would decrease the sugar a bit due to the cereal having its own sweet and that I don't like overly-sweet desserts. My husband loved it as it was. 
Update: made the filling just apples  (10 small), lemon juice, some  cinn, approx 1/8c sugar

This is the best apple crisp I have ever had.  In fact is was so satisfying that I did not have to eat anything else in the evening.  It is filling and tastes marvelous.  I put some lemon zest just to perk it up, but nothing else only what was in the receipt. Natalie T

Love this recipe! I keep a large container of the topping in the freezer, and when I have extra apples, or if I need a small foodie gift is needed, this is excellent to whip up in small to medium batches. Just cut up 3-4 apples, cook as directed, top with the crisp topping and bake. Makes a really nice hostess gift...

i followed the recipe and the topping was very generous but it didn't brown...i baked it for 35 minutes and even the edges didn't brown...anyone tell me why?  i just took it out of the oven but haven't tasted it yet so don't know how it tastes... kinda anemic looking on top.  the top mixture was very dry when i put it on the apples mixture.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it many times.  I was first attracted to it because of the title.  (Crispiest Apple Crisp)  I tried this in its original state and with the grape nuts.  If I were to rate it with just that it would be a 3.  Yes it is crispy but really didn't care for the grape nuts.  However, Chef John does encourage any type of crispy cereal not just the grape nuts therefore I can't give it a 3.  In my photo I included the cereal topping I used.  It is very crunchy and oh so tasty.  It really is hard to screw up an apple crisp.  Now for those of you who have asked for gluten free topping here is what I used..... 1/2 cup almond flour 1/4 cup pecan pieces, 3 TBL splenda brown sugar, 1/4 cup splenda white sugar, 1/8-1/4 cup of melted butter, 1/3 cup of rolled oats/oatmeal, at least 1/2 cup of the nature valley honey and oats (pic of NV topping is included with my apple crisp)

Tastes great but the making of the sugar sauce for the apples is very finicky. It can turn into hard candy the moment the apples are added rendering it useless. I wish that Chef John would spend a bit more time explaining how to navigate the delicate balance between a delicious caramel sauce and burnt candy. 
In my opinion It's not a recipe for novices.

This is the absolute BEST apple crisp i've ever used!  The only thing I did different was to sprinkle a little more cinnamon over the apples before adding the topping and when cooking the apples i noticed the juice was very thin so i sprinkled a little flour into the pot til the juice was thick enough to coat the apples - a tsp or two.  The grape nuts are a great addition to the topping and it was very crisp but not hard.  Wonderful recipe!  I'm anxious to try it with other fruits.

Careful when you melt/caramelize the sugar! Its really easy to overdo. The crisp is pretty tasty. I think I will make it again, I think I would make more of the crisp on top.

I really liked the crispiest crisp part of this recipe.  I didn't use the rest of the recipe so didn't feel like should give it 5 stars. I had 3 qts. of homemade apple pie filling to use so used the serving adaption to get it right - that is so helpful-thanks ar.com for that feature. I made a 9x13" pan full of deliciousness! I served it for a ladies lunch of 15 so the servings were rather small, topping it with cinnamon cool whip. Yummy and then some - it's a keeper!
