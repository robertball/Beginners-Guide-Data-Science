This is quick and tasty recipe.  The spices give it a savory, complex flavor.  There is an error in the recipe, however, regarding the amount of chicken broth. The recipe calls for  only 2 tablespoons of chicken broth.  I used a quart of broth, judging from the amount of flour called for (Â½ cup). But I'd really rather the author  say what the correct amount is
Mama Laina, could you please let us know?   Thanks so much!

Hey OP here, yes there is a typo on the amount of broth. It should say 4 to 6 cups of low sodium broth. More if you like a thinner gravy, less if you prefer thick gravy.

Delicious low fat gravy, quick and easy, my husband loved it on his roasted chicken.   No point in making a saturated fat-laden gravy especially if you like crispy chicken skin and don't want to add to your load.  I have nothing negative to say about this recipe it is perfect as is,

This will definitely be my go-to for chicken gravy. I liked the consistency using the measurements in the recipe however,  I had a lot leftover. Will see how it reheats with leftovers tomorrow!

I really liked this and I loved the addition of smoked paprika. The bouillon gave it a really nice bright color even though it did make it a little on the salty side. This was excellent and worked perfectly as written. *****update***I totally read over the ingredient list calling  for 2 tbsp. of broth but just read the part about adding 1 cup at a time in the steps. I ended up using 3-4 cups if I had to guess. After the 2nd cup I quit measuring and just eyeballed it.  Start with 2 cups and go from there depending on how thin you like it.
