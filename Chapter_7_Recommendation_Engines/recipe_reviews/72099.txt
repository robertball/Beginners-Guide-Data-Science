I loved this recipe! I made sure to follow this recipe as closely as possible.  In order to shape them better i did have to use a little bit more flour. What else... after baking the first few, i realized how important it is to not get any of the egg on the cookie sheet. I'm going to make them again next week in the size recommended (i made this batch of cookies with more than a tbsp of cookie dough per cookie because i was in somewhat of a hurry).  Anyways, thanks for the recipe.

Scaled to half. Real mushy, even after adding more flour. Also, this seems like a cookie recipe rather than the traditional "snails" I was hoping for.

This is a cake-like cookie. They have a good flavor, but the dough is not as stiff as the recipe indicates. I had to use quite a bit of flour on my hands and board to form the snails. also chill the dough.
The mini-chocolate chips reminded me more of a snail's antenna than eyes.....very cute!!

These were good. i had no problem with them not having enough flavor (i added some extra cinnimon and nutmeg). A good cookie if your looking for something that isnt very sweet. very good to have with coffee.

These cookies were adorable.  I made them at around 2 o'clock and by 5 they were all gone.  I increased the cinnamon by fifty percent because a previous reviewer had said they weren't very cinnamony and we thought they were very tasty.  I didn't have any superfine sugar so I used granulated and I baked the cookies flat on the tray, I don't think they were meant to be baked standing up.  Will be making these often!

They were OK. the dough was fairly easy to make. I'd suggest mixing in the flour with your hands because it gets hard to stir. The powdered sugar mixture didn't stay on the cookies, and they fell over in the oven. They didn't taste very cinnamon-y to me. Maybe someone else will have better luck.

We do not bake cookies very often and my son wanted cinnamon cookies. I followed the recipe exactly, they turned out pretty good.  I would make some small changes if I make these again.  For me they turned out a little doughy and not quite as much of a cinnamon flavor as anticipated. Still very good though!
