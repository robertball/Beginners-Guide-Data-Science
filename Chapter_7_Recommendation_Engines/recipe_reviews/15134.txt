My husband and I both thought this was excellent, plus we loved the fact that the sauce wasn't full of butter.  I cooked the chicken thoroughly in the pan, removed it, then made the sauce...I didn't simmer them together as I think it would have made the breading very mushy.  We can't wait to have it again!  *UPDATE: As much as we liked the original recipe, we LOVE this version: Skip the whole chicken process and go straight to cooking the veggies and sauce.  After sauce has thickened, toss in a green vegetable (we use broccoli florets, snap peas or asparagus), then a bunch of peeled, raw shrimp.  The shrimp only need a few minutes to cook, and this will keep your green veggie from getting mushy.  Serve over pasta - YUM!

Absolutely delicious!  A note, if you decrease the amount of servings, do not change the amount of sauce ingredients, or will cook off all the sauce.

I dont think the egg is nescessary in the coating. I used chicken cutlets and browned them removed from pan added olive oil the sauteed shrooms shallots and garlic then deglazed with wine added lemon and mixed starch with broth added to pan until thickend returned chicken to pan and topped with parsley. Overall it was a easy one pan meal. served with rice pilaf

Awesome and SO easy. I added capers and took the chicken out while the sauce reduced, and then put it back in when I was almost done.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe, there were NO leftovers. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This was very good - I used chicken tenderloins which I pounded thin, then I floured, dipped in egg mixture then dregged again.  After browning the chicken, I removed them to a warm platter.  After sauteing the mushrooms and onions, I made the sauce, I added additional broth and wine, but did not increase the lemon.  As others, instead of using cornstarch, I used the leftover flour mixture to thicken the sauce.  Next time I will increase the lemon juice and that will probably bring this recipe up to 5 stars. Definitely, increase the sauce. I added the chicken back into the sauce just before serving.  Served over whole wheat thin spagetti.  I will make this again.

Liked this better than Chicken Marsala. Instead of paprika, used rosemary in the flour mixture.  After cooking chicken, removed it and cooked onions, mushrooms and garlic.  Added the wine and after few mins, added chicken broth with cornstarch already dissolved and lemon juice.   Served it over rosemary garlic mashed potatos. Excellent recipe - thank you.

All I can say is WOW!  I recently tasted veal piccata in a well known Chicago restaurant.  I came online to search for something similar but with chicken instead.  Not only did this recipe live up to my expectations...it exceeded them!  Tremendous recipe!  A must try!  Thank you Karen!

Another dinner I ate too much of because it was so darned good.  I followed the recipe loosely, not measuring, just cooking.  I pounded the chicken to about 1/2" thickness and cut it into smaller serving pieces.  (This chicken had huge breasts!)  That way it took just a few minutes on each side for the chicken to cook and the pieces were of a more reasonable size for serving.  I removed the almost-cooked chicken from the pan and returned it once I completed the remainder of the recipe.  I added fresh minced garlic to the mushrooms and onions.  The cornstarch isn't necessary - if you reduce the wine/broth/ lemon juice until it's nearly gone, then swirl in some butter off heat, you'll end up with a smooth, rich, velvety pan sauce.  I served with this with linguine, lightly dressed with butter, olive oil and garlic, and saut√©ed  fresh spinach.

We really liked this one. I've been looking for a good chicken piccata recipe, and this is it! Only thing missing from the recipe is capers - we added about a tablespoonful, and that really added to the flavor. Also added freshly ground black pepper to the flour mixture. I like the idea of adding artichoke hearts - will try that next time as others suggested. Served it with mushroom rice and steamed broccoli. We'll definitely make this one again.

Very good!!  I halved the recipe but kept the sauce the same...used Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio for the wine and added capers.  Chicken was fork tender and sauce was delicious - went perfect with a baked potato and some veggies.  Thanks...I will make this one again for sure.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions - removing the chicken from the pan after it browned, deglazing the pan with the wine after sauteeing the mushrooms, onion & garlic, and using some of the leftover flour mixture (instead of cornstarch) to thicken the sauce, then placing the chicken back in to simmer.  Yum!  I will be making this again.

This was great! I added more onions, probably half a cup, and after reading the reviews I added capers. I also added the zest from one lemon and a little rosemary. Finally, after tasting the sauce, I added extra wine. But these subtle changes were just to accommodate my personal preferences. Great recipe, Karen, Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I substituted flour for cornstarch and skipped the parsley garnish.  I served it with bowtie pasta (for kids).

This recipe was excellent.  The chicken was tender, the sauce was flavorful, and even my horrendously picky kids loved it!  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce in my opinion, so I will probably make more next time.  But very minor complaint!

We'll add this to our regular rotation!  I only wish there was something less fattening than butter for this, but then I'm guessing that's why it was so good.  :)

Very good.  I stuck with the ingredients except doubled the sauce and mushrooms.  Altered the methods somewhat:  cook and remove chicken and keep warm; use pan to make sauce; poor sauce over at serving.  To reduce cholesterol, used half as much butter to start but did have to add a bit of olive oil later. (March 8, 2012; March 11, 2017.)

I changed it slightly because I had thin sliced chicken breasts and mushrooms on hand.  I browned the chichen breasts and removed from pan and covered them.  Sauteed the mushrooms and onions and poured the rest of the ingredients over them.  Simmered on medium low for 11 minutes until it was beginning to thicken.  Then I put the chicken breasts back in and cooked for 2-3 minutes until they were warm.  Because there were more pieces of chicken, I did use more butter.  It was excellent.  I plan to try the recipe again as written.

I was really looking forward to this based on others' reviews but I found it to be very underwhelming and after I admitted my disappointment my boyfriend felt free to call it the blandest thing he has ever tasted. Not sure where others got all the flavor from, because we thought it was really blah. I kept it on stove longer than recipe called for and still didn't get the sauce to reduce; it was very runny (but on the positive side of things, there was plenty of sauce!).

Outstanding recipe!  I cut butter in half and replaced other half with olive oil.  Also, pounded chicken breast to about 1/2 inch.  They were large and only used four.  I did remove chicken before adding the onions and mushrooms...they were cooked through since thin, and added them back on top in last 10 minutes of cooking time.  Came out delicious!  Thanks, Karen, for a super recipe.

just made this for me & the hubby for dinner.  we both loved it.  i liked other suggestions about making the same amount of sauce, even though i cut down the recipe.  wasn't prepared with all the ingredients so i tried a couple of things.  didn't have white wine, so i used more chicken broth.  also didn't have a lemon & substituted dijon mustard.  thank you for sharing your recipe.  i get easily intimidated in the kitchen and this recipe is certainly a keeper!  thanks again.

I do not understand the string of poor reviews this recipe is receiving; and to give a poor review because you do not care for the photo is not fair to the recipe submitter.  I made this last week and it came out fine.  I skipped the milk/egg step as it seemed unnecessary and added (rinsed) capers because it sounded good.  I also used homemade chicken stock and added garlic to the onions.  Will make again.

This was fantastic!  I couldn't believe how much flavour came out of such basic ingredients.  I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the chicken stock before adding it to the skillet, and it added a nice tangy flavour to the dish.  I agree with previous reviewers about making more of the sauce mixture though -- I only used 4 chicken breasts (small skillet!), and the amount of sauce was perfect.

It was very good.  Easy, fast and full of flavor.  This one is a keeper.  Tip... be sure to use regular chicken broth.  Low sodium takes away from the flavor and you'll find yourself wanting to add salt later.

LOVED THIS!!!  It would be an easy company dish any day.  We served it over squash ribbons rather than rice or noodles, and I doubled the mushroom/sauce part.

I improvised a little (seasoned chicken with salt and pepper and then dusted with flour).  Added some capers (because I looooove them!) and used canned mushrooms b/c that's all I had on hand.  Loved the wine/broth/lemon juice flavors in the sauce

Oh my gosh!  This was so delicious! It is the perfect Italian dish to serve for two or for a party - the flavors are unreal.  I made it exactly as the recipe dictated and it turned out supurb!  I served mine over rice and it was a nice change. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely delish!!!!!!!! I used chicken tenders instead of full breasts, and removed them from the pan while the sauce reduced, and added them back about 7 minutes before serving.  I also doubled the sauce.  I also added about 4 tablespoons of capers and a small jar of artichoke hearts. served over angel hair.  Seriously better than my favorite restaurants!!!! I will make this again and again and have already given the recipe to many different people!!!!

I love this recipe.  Make it all the time.  I usually double the sauce as my husband is crazy about it.  Also add a few capers to top it off.

Well after the 1st 3 latest reviews.  I will stick with my chicken Marsala recipe I have.  No egg mixture to dip your chicken into before flour and I changed the butter to brown chicken and mushrooms to extra virgin olive oil and it comes out great with less fat and chol.

I like this one ... I haven't had much luck with breaded meats previously, but this one stuck well and colored nicely.
The flavor was good, and the mushrooms came out really well.
Next time I will add some more seasoning into the flour mixture as the chicken itself was a bit bland.

Very tasty!  I did not have fresh parsley so substituted with fresh cilantro.  I cut down the salt just a bit and increased the paprika-excellent!  Next time I will try without mushrooms but with capers.  I did remove the chicken after browning and before cooking the onion and mushrooms.  Kept the breading intact and the chicken moist.

Had a great flavor and will make again, although I think I will make the sauce separately and poor over sauteed meat (vs cooking the meat in the sauce).

This was "good."  Used 4 big fat chicken breasts and pounded them down thin.  Not all the breasts would fit in the pan, so I browned them in two batches and set aside.  As a reviewer suggested, I de-glazed the pan with white wine and cooked the mushrooms and onion separately.  Poured in the sauce (made extra since serving over dry angel hair pasta and it need some extra), and brought to a boil.  Tossed the chicken in and sauteed on low for about 20 minutes. Since the breasts were thin, they were very nearly done already.  I thought it turned out okay, but the husband raved.  The two kids, under 6, ate a few bites.  All and all, I would make this again, but maybe add capers.  I think that's what was missing for me. Thanks for this recipe!

Yum! I'm not big on lemon flavor....but this was nice - with a hint of lemon.  I had a couple of alterations - like deglazing the pan with the wine after frying the chicken and then making the sauce....and I didn't add the corn starch - I'd rather the flour from the chicken thicken the sauce. This was really good, I'm looking forward to leftovers when the flavors meld.

This is FABULOUS.  It it simple but sooo tasty.  I checked out a couple of recipes before deciding to use this one.  When making it, I added 1 T of lemon juice to the egg/milk mixture.  I floured the chicken, dipped it in the egg mixture, and dipped it again in the flour.  The chicken alone is fantastic.  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms and made the sauce as stated in the recipe, except I used all chicken stock instead of adding the white wine.  About 2 minutes before I was ready to serve it, I put the chicken back in the sauce to heat it a little and get some sauce on it.  I can't tell you how good and how simple this is to make.  You have to try this.

I made it as written, except maybe I used more mushrooms and I used less chicken... I wanted extra sauce and was cooking for four. It was a hit with everyone in the family (minus the picky 3 yr old).  It is very flavorful and the chicken was nice and tender.  The cooking time is perfect.  We served it with rice and vegies and the sauce is excellent over the rice as well.  I'm looking forward to my leftovers for lunch!

Very good!  I made about half this recipe.  I put the flour, salt and paprika in a bag and shook it up to combine.  Then added the chicken and shook again to coat.  I saut√©ed the mushrooms and onion and set them aside.  I then cooked the chicken completely and removed it to a warm oven.  I deglazed the pan with the broth and wine.  Simmered to thicken and then added back the mushrooms, onions and chicken.  No fear of over cooking the chicken this way.

Lemon and mushrooms...wasn't quite expecting the combination.  Not sure if I like it or not.  Otherwise, it was an easy dish to put together.  The only thing I did different was to bake the chicken instead of frying (I do not fry any meats whatsoever anymore) and I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of flour.   Will try it again but maybe cut down on the amount of lemon juice.

This was an excellent recipe. I ended up putting a little too much lemon, so I cut it with some cream at the very end and it was spectacular! Also added a TBSP of capers as I feel they are a staple ingredient in piccata.

Awesome. Followed the recipe exactly, except I did not bread the chicken. I simply fried it up in the pan with some butter and seasonings. I also added capers. Was wonderful.

This was outstanding.  I added a little extra broth and wine - and will add a little more next time, as we like sauce.  Also threw a few capers on top when serving - but could have added to sauce.

Very good after some tweaking.  I guess we're not "lemon people", and the sauce was WAY too lemony when made following the recipe.  We're trying to cut back on carbs so not serving with pasta or rice to "cut" it really brought the flavors to the forefront.  I ended up adding about a cup of milk and a half a cup of light sour cream to cut the acid, and used a flour slurry when I discovered we were out of cornstarch.  Wanted to add capers but found a whopping ten of them left in the bottom of the jar... sheesh.  I also did not cook the chicken with the sauce since I wanted the coating to remain as crispy as possible. I just spooned the sauce over the chicken once plated, and then sprinkled chopped black olives over everything.  Used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, and used more onion since I didn't have as many mushrooms as called for.  Also added two cloves of chopped fresh garlic. You most definitely want to double the sauce.  Very, very tasty!  Hubby loved it, too.

My husband declared I was a gourmet chef!  OK, so he loves me, but it WAS very good.  I pounded down the chicken so it would cook faster and since we like things saucy and garlic-y, I doubled the sauce and added some shredded garlic and some good quality balsamic vinegar.  YUMM-O!  Even the kids ate it.  Sauce is delish!

This is the first not so good review as I do not usually send the negative ones, but I was disappointed as the recipe and reviews sounded good.
Chicken and sauce was very bland and coating lost it's consistency once in the sauce. 
It sounded good and I should have tried it once before making for friends. 
Had to resort to Plan B.

I made it as written but without the flour, salt egg and milk on the chicken.    My husband loved it, but thought more salt and reduction of the sauce would be good.  My teenager doesn't like mushrooms, so. . . We served it over brown rice which was ideal for my husband and I.   This will definitely go into my chicken recipe rotation.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  The only real changes I made were to pound the chicken breasts thin before flouring, added the parsley to the sauce while it was cooking, and sprinkled some grated asiago cheese on top of the chicken.  Delicious and a keeper, thanks!

I cook a lot and was looking for something new. I made this recipe and it was GREAT! I sauteed the chicken in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter. That was the only thing I changed. This is a great recipe. A must try!

This recipe was okay.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added artichoke hearts.  I found that by leaving the chicken in to simmer it made the coating on the chicken rather mushy.  Next time I would remove the chicken for the majority of the cooking time and then return it to the pan.

Loved this with the mushrooms!  Don't let the breading put you off-its easy!  First flour, then the egg wash and back into the flour.  I kept the browned chicken warm while the sauce reduced, so they wouldn't get soggy.  Put them back in, topped with the parsley, and served over white rice.  Oh, I put some lemon zest in the flour mixture for extra flavor.

I had to double the recipe for company and ended up finishing the chicken off in the oven. I prepared the broth mixture and heated it in the skillet to deglaze the pan, then poured it over the chicken in a cassarole dish. It was wonderful!

This is a very tasty, fairly quick dish. I did not have onions, so I sprinkled in onion powder and it tasted just fine. Like other reviewers, I browned the chicken first, removed it from the pan, and then proceeded with the mushrooms and sauce. I also substituted 1/2 cup of Dry Sherry mixed with 1/2 cup of water in place of the white wine, likewise delicious. 

Tip: Use a fork to place the egg dipped chicken cutlets in the flour and then use the fork to get them out. If you use your fingers you will smear the egg/flour mix!

I absolutely love this.  A quick easy dinner that taste like I was at a restaurant.  I do add minced garlic in with the onions and mushrooms when sauteeing.  Serve over pasta with fresh grated parmesan and you might think you are at a great Italian bistro!

This was a great recipe! Although I did  tweak it. Instead of Chicken I used shrimp, just omit the chicken prep and add the shrimp at the end. I also added capers, garlic, and artichoke hearts. I served it over linguini. I also agree with others to double the sauce and reduce it. Turned out great. This will become a staple recipe in my home.

Excellent recipe and so simple! I served with a brown rice and quinoa blend - perfect and healthy! 

Recippe is easily altered for taste preferances.

I cut the butter a bit and used about 1 and 1/2 lbs chicken. Was liberal on the broth.

Pounded the breasts but they were still thick and required extra cooking time. I browned them on both sides in butter and then added lemon and broth to the pan and covered for about 7 minutes.

Like others I removed the chicken and sauted the onions and mushrooms seperately for about 5 minutes. Then added all the both to the mushrooms/onions and let that simmer and thicken on its own for about 5 more minutes. Lastly, added the chicken back in for the last 2 minutes.

1 hint - add the corn starch/flour before the broth is hot. If added while the liquid is boiling, it tends to clump up immediately.

Added capers in at the end...gave it a nice zing!

My family LOVED this and my kiddos are a little picky so that is a bonus! I only changed a few ingredients- I added garlic when I put in the onions and mushrooms to saute with the chicken. I also added a little Italian seasoning to the dry flour mixture (or you could use Rosemary or Oregano). I didn't add the lemon juice (only because my husband doesn't like the taste in recipes). Let the cornstarch dissolve in cool water before you add to the wine and chicken broth mixture. The bread coating is a little mushy when you sear it in the pan and then let it cook in the sauce but you don't want the skin to be hard so I thought it was still great. Definitely one of our favorites!!

Pretty good recipe. However I removed the chicken breasts and put them in the broiler after they were sufficiently browned on the outside (but still need some cooking on the inside). I put the chicken on a plater and spooned the sauce of it. I wanted to keep the chicken as crispy as possible!

It's very tasty, subtle. I didn't do the flour part and just started by browning the chicken. I used chicken thighs. I also used leftover champagne from New Years for the white wine. I am going to serve it with pilaf and spinach.

This was delicious. I made it because I was looking for a recipe to use up some stuff I had left over in my fridge at the end of the week (some chicken cutlets, wine, half a box of broth, half a package of mushrooms) and this was PERFECT. I did what other suggested - browned the chicken, removed it from the pan, sauteed the onions and mushrooms then added the wine to deglaze then added the broth and all the other ingredients. Had no problem thickening the sauce and in fact had to add more wine to make it a little more saucy about half way through. I used portabella mushrooms which worked great since they are tough enough to hold up to the heat and longer cooking time - not rubbery at all. I also added garlic in with the onions and mushrooms. I served the chicken just like this with a side of steamed broccolli. The only problem was I wish I had made more!! I cut the recipe in half since it was just me and my husband, but I'll definitely make this again for a larger crowd. Great for dinner guests - it's a restaurant quality meal that takes just a little time.

This was probably the best chicken Piccata I have made.  I don't use mushrooms, however I liked the rest of your ingredients.  I also changed just a couple things.  I used a little butter, but mostly olive oil to fry the chicken.   I added some garlic when frying the onions. I also doubled the sauce recipe, but only     used 1 extra tablespoon of lemon juice. Finally I added a small jar of rinsed capers to the pot before reducing.

It really came out wonderfully.  I will absolutely use this recipe again.  The only thing it needed was a little black pepper.
Otherwise 5*+

This was an excellent base recipe for Chicken Piccata.  My husband said it was one of the best things that we have had.  I found a couple of other users suggestions helpful:  1.  pound the chicken a little thinner  2. I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken before I coated it and 3.  added capers, of course, and artichoke hearts to the simmer stage.  VERY GOOD.  I actually dont eat chicken, so I substituted one piece of white fish in there for me - prepared it the same way as the chicken, and it was great as well.

My family loves this recipe! I omitted the wine because I was out of it and used a whole can of chicken broth instead.I also used margarine instead of butter and 4 chicken breasts instead of 6. The sauce and chicken can simmer longer and will be fork tender! We had it with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli. It was delicious!

Easy ad Delicious - I added capers and I did give it some extra time to simmer and develop a nice sauce - served with egg noodles.

I've had this in my recipe box for 3 years and finally decided to try.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written. It was phenomenal! This is definitely going into my rotation. Served with broad egg noodles and green beans. Maybe the best recipe I've used from this site. Thank you for sharing.

Thanks for sharing your outstanding piccata recipe, Karen, we loved everything about this!  The chicken was delicious, and the sauce had a perfect balance of lemon and wine.  I used the ingredients as published, but did a slight tweak on the method.  I used thin chicken cutlets, and after saute they were cooked through, so I removed them from the pan and sauteed the mushrooms and onion separately, then added the sauce and allowed to thicken for a few minutes.  I added a couple of tablespoons of capers, too, and back in the chicken went for a final warm in the sauce.  Easy enough for weeknights, but definitely a company worthy dish.  I'll make this again.

This was awesome!  Made it for friends and everyone raved!  I doubled the sauce because these recipes never seem to have enough sauce and I was serving whipped potatoes with the chicken and wanted enough to be able to use it as gravy for the potatoes.  I followed one reviewer who made the chicken as directed, save it on a platter in a warm oven while you make the sauce, then poured the sauce over the chicken and serve. Will definitely make again!

My family loves this dish.  I like to add extra mushrooms if I have them on hand.  Also, just before the chicken is cooked thru I put fresh spinach on top and put the lid on to wilt it.  The gravy from this dish is super on top of fresh steamed green beans for a healthy side dish.

I cut the chicken in bite size peaces ( I was cooking for only 2 and only used two chicken breast) and kept the other ingredients the same. My husband and I loved it. We think next time we should add peanuts or cashues. We poured it over rice like a stir fry. It was great.

Surprisingly simple to make!  This turned out to be much more delicious than I thought.  Made this with chicken tenderloins and that cut the cooking time down a lot.  By the time the broth and wine were added to the pan, the chicken was cooked, so it was just a matter or waiting on the sauce to thicken, which didn't take 25 minutes like it said.  Delicious and simple!  Would make a good romantic meal.

Added a little garlic powder, salt and pepper to the sauce.  Otherwise, made recipe as-is and it was wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

Much requested recipe in my home.  Will be making it again tonight - requested by my 11 yr. old daughter.  I always double the sauce and cut back a bit on the lemon juice.  Serve or brown rice (my favorite)or egg noodles.

Have made this twice so far for company and both times it was a hit.  Chicken is so tender cuts with a fork.  I first cut the chicken thin like a cutlet. Also, I saute mushrooms first.  For any recipe, I always cook mushrooms first or separately to rid the water and give mushrooms a less spongy taste.   I like to double the sauce, since it boils out and thickens. Using my large electric frying pan is perfect for this recipe.

Great recipe, simple and flavorful.

I wanted my chicken cooked and disregarded someone's comment to cook the chicken aside to keep it crispy, so after 5 minutes of the vegetables simmering, I added the chicken breasts and cooked them 10 minutes per side. The coating held nicely to the end.  I also added a few capers, just because I had them.  Hehe, I just realized I forgot the parsley, can't say we missed it.

It is a very nice dinner dish with uncomplicated ingredients; as a suggestion try it with a side of herbed oven-roasted potatoes as we did. Well worth it.

I skipped the breading and went straight to browning the breasts in the butter (I added a little olive oil as well) with the mushrooms, onions and added 1 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger.  I didn't need the cornstarch as I let the sauce reduce on its own.  I served this over rice seasoned with fresh parsley &fresh  basil.  It made a lovely dinner.  Thank you for the recipe.

OMG!  This reciped is great!  Thanks Karen
It turned out restaurant quality. If you're having a special occasion, this is the recipe to make. Taste fantastic, easy to fix and inexspensive.  I forgot to buy flour, so I used bisquick pancake mix. I can't imagine it would taste any better using flour : ).  I also used the leftover mixture instead of the cornstarch.

My husband and I give this 4.5 stars so we can add our own flair. I used three chicken breasts with this recipe because we used the sauce over whole grain pasta. Delicious! We took other advice and did not add chicken until the end after the sauce reduced. Also added capers as suggested and because my husband is "cheesy" he added feta cheese at the end and this was the perfect combination with the other flavors.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I reduced the amount of chicken to three breasts (because its what I had), but didn't modify the sauce portion. It turned out perfect. We served over jasmine rice (cooked with half water, half the rest of the can of broth) and there was a perfect amount of sauce. Delicious!

Was a great dish. I used baby bella mushrooms. As I reduced the sauce, I thought it could use a little more depth of flavor. I added a hint of brown sugar and a little basil and lots of pepper. For a richer dish, I would use a roux(flour) or cream instead of cornstarch.

This is a very tasty dish.  The chicken was so moist, you could cut it with your fork.  We served it with roasted baby potatoes and fresh sliced cucumber on the side.  Wouldn't change a thing.

To save time (and a few calories) I merely rinsed the chicken with water before dredging in the seasoned flour.  Next time I'll do the onion/mushroom saute first to add a bit more color to the veggies before adding to the chicken.  Did not particularly care for the cornstarch-thickened sauce.  I think it would be better to just reduce the sauce to intensify the flavors of the individual ingredients.

This was delicious. The only change I made was to cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces, which was a bit of a pain when it came to dipping into the egg and flour mixture, but well worth it. The chicken was fabulous! The sauce thickened up wonderfully, which i usually have a problem with. Also, I am not much of a mushroom person so I was a little afraid of using what seemed like too many mushrooms, but it wasn't too much at all. I served over mashed potatoes. My boyfriend loved it and asked if he could take the leftovers for lunch. The only thing I would recommend is making a little more sauce. Overall, it was fabulous. I will definitly be making this again. Thanks Karen for a great recipe!

I won't make it again.  Corn starch is gross and makes everything yucky.  I'll be looking for a new chicken piccata recipe that doesn't call for it.

Very good.  Coated chicken then refrigerated for 1 hr.  Think this really helped. Sauteed mushrooms and onions separately; made sauce separately & doubled it.  Fried chicken in butter till nearly done - got wonderfully crisp and golden.  Towards end, added mushroom/onions and then sauce.  Didn't need all the sauce. Was very tender and juicy.  Didn't have capers - darn.  Will make again.

This was alright.  Nothing spectacular, just a little more than bland.  Similar to Chicken Marsala but more on the sour side.

We love this one. I add asparagus, some garlic, and sometimes capers. I want to try artichoke hearts too. I don't bread the chicken; I just season and saute. WONDERFUL sauce!

This was SO good!  I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil to saute the chicken.  I kept the chicken separate from the sauce once cooked and added it back to the sauce when the sauce was done as others had recommended.  I used some chicken stock I had in the fridge and what a treat!  My husband said he thought it was too tart but I didn't think so.  I may reduce the lemon next time.  I only cooked 4 breasts and pounded them and then cut them into smaller pieces.  I did make the full amount of sauce as recommended.  I served this with brown rice and roasted asparagus.  It was awesome!!

The flavor was good and paired well with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. I added capers and doubled the amount of lemon juice. It only got 4 stars because the breading fell off as I was transferring it to plates.  I will probably not bread the chicken next time and will just saute it! I will be making again!

This recipe was amazing!  I followed the recipe pretty closely - added in the capers and because my chicken was taking some time to cook through, I eventually made the sauce in a separate pan while my chicken cooked.  Worked out great and my husband is raving about this dish!  This is definitely worth the wait and is a keeper!

Wow! This was great. The whole family loved it. I used olive oil instead of butter, added lemon pepper to the flour mixture, and omitted the cornstarch. This went very well with potatoes, although it would probably be great over rice as well.

MMM MMM MMM   THIS WAS SO YUMMY, I WISH I WOULD'VE REMEMBERED TO TAKE A PICTURE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DISH AND TASTY.  THE BREADING PROCESS IS TIME CONSUMING BUT WORTH IT.  I USED A CORN FLAKE AND BREAD CRUMBS FOR THE BREADING.  IT HAD A GREAT FLAVOR AND MADE FOR A VERY NICE BROWNING.

This was very delicious.  It was so full of great flavor.  I made this for my hubby and he couldn't get enough.  I altered the recipe by pounding the chicken breasts thin so they would cook faster.  Next time I will cut back on the amount of butter used.  Thanks!  I will make again!

This was excellent.  I was a little leary that the chicken would be tough after cooking for so long on the stove but it was really tender.  The kids liked it too.  Of course, minus the mushrooms.  I did as other reviewers said and dipped the chicken in the flour mixture then egg wash then back in the flour mixture.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and did need to make up a little bit more of the flour mixture.  I will definitley be making this again.

Chicken piccata is my daughter's favorite dish but without capers, mushrooms etc. I was pleasantly surprised when she not only ate a mushroom but declared it was good. This was a very nice recipe. Paired with lemon butter steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes.

Loved this. Outstanding recipe. Had it with linguine. The sauce is great with pasta. Cut the chicken back because there are only two of us, but not the sauce, because I am a real sauce person.

Good basic recipe. I would suggest pounding the breast to a flat cutlet and cooking the chicken first after step one. Then remove chicken and extra greese, and cook mushrooms and onion with a touch of butter.Then deglaze the pan with the liquids and reduce sauce.
(I prefer a little more wine)Finally thicken with starch or flour and return chicken to rewarm and for the flavors to meld on simmer for a few more minutes. I also add a touch of capers and lemmon zest to the sauce. Nice with pasta or rice! Even better left over as the taste intensifies.

I had two nice size chicken breast, so I butterflied them to make four. Added fresh minced garlic to the butter for extra flavor. Also added ground pepper and herbs de provence to the flour mixture, along with the paprika and salt. After reading the reviews I kept my sauce at the recipe's 6 servings, using homemade chicken broth and fresh lemon juice. Cooked my breast in garlic butter first for 3 minutes each side, then removed and kept warm on a plate while I cooked the mushroom mixture. I did toss in a few spoonfuls of capers too, why not? This was a wonderfully flavored chicken dish and not too hard to prepare. I would suggest if you do have six breast to increase the sauce, especially if you're serving over pasta or rice.

This recipe was excellent.  Didn't have the mushroom and left out the lemon juice because my DH doesn't like it.  Just added 1 tbs more of broth and wine.  I also added capers.   This was EXCELLENT!

I didn't care for this at all.  Definitely not a quick-easy meal.  I don't care for sauces made with lemon juice, either

Tried it ..Went over great with the Family.Doubled the stock and wine and added an extra 2 Tbl of corn starch and a large carrot cut on an angle and had the perfect amount of sauce to be served with a lb of pasta.

This was awesome! I did add capers and garlic. Next time I will add a bit more lemon juice. I only cooked it for about 15 minutes because the sauce was getting too thick. Chicken was moist and I can't wait to make it again!

Overall, okay, but I cooked the chicken and set it aside - I didn't want to let it simmer in the sauce because I wanted to preserve the texture of the breading.  Also, I think next time I'll add onion powder to the flour mixture to give it a little bit more flavor.

I made this exactly as written as we enjoyed it very much.  Served on spaghetti with a side of steamed lemon brocoli.   Four stars only because prep required a lot of dishes.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked it very much.  A quick and easy dish for those with not much time.  I found it a little sharp, because of the lemon or the white wine, I don't know.  But next time I must taste it before serving and add a couple of grains of sugar.  I don't want it sweet.

Superb!  But the breading on my chicken did get mushy from cooking in the sauce.  Think I'll try other suggestion of cooking chicken separately from the sauce next time.

Fixed this great and easy dish tonight for dinner. Had to use boneless skinless thighs because that is what I had. Served with brown rice and a lemon wedge. Will definitely prepare again.

I hate to review with changes, but Inthis case, I have to. I used thin cut chicken cutlets. I also omitted the mushrooms bc no one but me likes them.  I doubled the amounts as I was using over 2 lbs of chicken. I also saut√©ed the chicken in batches, then placed them into a baking pan. I saut√©ed the onions and added them to the baking pan. Then I made the sauce and cooked it in the same pan until it boiled for at  8-10 minutes to burn off the alcohol and to allow it to thicken. I then baked it for about 15 minutes at 400. It was a hit with my family. Even my picky 6 year old liked it, once I scraped off the onions. I would definitely make it again.

I made this recipe according to the directions and it was fabulous! My husband said that the only change he would make would be to pound the chicken breasts or use chicken cutlets. The flavors were wonderful!

I made this for the first time today and I can tell you I WILL be making it again!
Because I didn't have chicken breasts, I decided to use some thighs I had bought for a chicken stew.  I skinned and boned six thighs and proceeded with the recipe.  (I'm sorry I didn't make ALL of them with double the amount of sauce!)
My husband said it was THE BEST meal I've ever made for him --- and he likes everything I cook!  But I have to admit that he was right.  It was magnifique and the sauce was beyond description.  Just a marvelous treat!

Oh wow!  This was amazing!!  I made it exactly as said (beside adding 2 tablespoons capers)and it was soooooo good!  I was afraid because it wasn't a 'cream' sauce like typical but wow, what a gravy!  I laid the chicken and sauce over angel hair noodles, it was heavenly.  And so so easy, will make again, a for sure crowd pleaser!!

I liked the way the chicken turned out - it was tender and the gravy was pretty nice, but a couple of people I served it to said it was too bland.  I think adding capers might be one way to help it, but a lot of people don't like capers.  Overall, it still wasn't a decent dish.

I like the addition of mushrooms, but classic piccata is not piccata if there are no capers and they're one of the reasons I love this dish.

This was quite yummy! I followed the recipe except for wine I just used a cup and a half of chicken broth. My pan wasn't big enough for the chicken and mushrooms so I sauteed the chicken, took the chicken out, sauteed the mushrooms, took the mushrooms out, put the juice/broth in then the chicken then the mushrooms on top. My four year old said, "that's delicious!" Very tasty!

Great recipe - we loved it!  My husband made this dish and accidentally used beef broth instead of chicken and it was delicious! anyway!  Next time (and there will be a next time), we'll use the right ingredients to see how even more wonderful this meal can be.

The canned or boxed chicken broth all contain MSG and/or yeast.  Try substituting water or perhaps increasing the wine and lemon juice.

I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breast, cooked quicker and used Chardonnay. I also used a package of Baby Bella mushrooms and a package of Oyster mushrooms. Really delicious if your a mushroom lover!

This is simply delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  Perfect over rice. I wil definately make this again.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Probably one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had.  My family all said it was great.  Will definately add this to my favorite recipes.

Karen:  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  

I used 3 large Breast Halves, and followed your recipe to the tee after that.  They were high enough in the sauce that I didn't see any need to remove them.

Result - DELICIOUS!  Flavorful, over long grained rice.  YUMMY! I'm a sauce person, so if 6 breasts, I would have to increase the sauce ;).

Ugh! The lemon juice was over-powering! I tried to cut it with some sugar, but it was just bland...Will stick with my old recipe.

Very easy to make and delicious!! Will definitely make again! Made the recipe as written except didn't dip the chicken in the egg (didn't seem necessary) and left out the onion. We added a splash more lemon because when I tasted the sauce I couldn't really taste the lemon. We only made 3 chicken breasts but kept the other ingredients the same. Worked perfectly!

I work in a restaurant where we serve this dish & I thought I would try this recipe to see if I can make it at home.  I was pleasantly surprised by how easy and how delicious it turned out!  I did however, add garlic and omitted the onions just to make a fair comparison to the restaurant version.  It was actually better!!  Thank you for sharing . . . I will be using this recipe from now on!

I thought this was really good with a nice flavor combination, but my husband thought it was bland.  I made it exactly as written, so if (big if) I make it again I will try to zap it up with some extra spices or herbs.

This is one of the best chicken piccatas I have ever had, including restaurant versions.  It was very easy and quick to prepare.  I dipped in the wash and flour twice, and I used a bit more wine and lemon than called for.  It was excellent.

Very good! HOWEVER...family likes Chicken Marsala (recipe on this website) better...Like some, I would double sauce next time. We had red potatoes and sauce goes well over it, too. I added maybe 1/2 tsp garlic powder to sauce and used Herb Ox boullion packet instead of broth (I like the seasonings in it.)Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

Followed directions to the letter only I added some minced garlic with the mushrooms & onions.  My chicken only needed around 15 minutes of simmering time.  My husband & I loved it, though!  He said it was fantastic.  We will make again.  Thanks!

Fantastic. Made it almost as the recipe states, except I don't much care for corn starch thickened gravy, so I used flour. Served over egg noodles, with steamed broccoli on the side. Looking forward the leftovers. Will make this again.

This is always good.  I double the sauce and mushrooms.  Made it again last night and had to use red wine instead of white (had none and nearest liquor store is 400 miles away).  It was still good.

Good and relatively easy. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs, which was very tasty since thighs have more fat! Also used a combo butter/olive oil for saute. Served with a side of tortellini and was a great meal.

I didn't have any rice handy so I doubled the sauce recipe and put it over linguine. It worked great.  I also added capers and used 1 1/2 lemons instead f the two tablespoons of lemon juice. I used the zest too... I like lemon, what can I say. I also threw in red pepper with the onion and mushroom. I'm not sure I would do that again, but it made for a colorful dish. I did take the recommendation of the other reviewers and used crushed rosemary in the flour. I also added lemon pepper (see the theme) to the flour. All in all, a satisfying meal.

Yum!  I have been looking for a recipe similar to a dish at my favorite Italian restaurant and this is it!!!  It is SO good!  I did add minced garlic and some marinated artichokes to mimic the restaurant's version.  I agree with other reviewers that the chicken doesn't really need the breading.  Next time I will do without it.  Thanks for sharing!

This is great. I added chopped green onions instead of regular onions, and it had great flavor without overdoing it. It's excellent when served with white rice.

I didn't bread the chicken, but followed the recipe otherwise- it was very tasty, and the mushrooms were a nice add on.  Would definitely make again!

I made this tonight and both my dh and I loved it.  The sauce is so yummy.  Like others, I added the capers and pounded the chicken before coating it.  
The only change I might try next time is to add either some lemon juice to the egg wash or some lemon pepper to the flour - or maybe both.  I think the chicken itself would be even better with a bit more lemony taste - but we both love lemon.  However, it's great now, easy to fix, looks like you fussed for hours, and is a definite "keeper" for me.

I've made this recipe several times annd each time comes out great.  On 2 occasions, I did not have white wine and substituted it with red and it still came out great!  My neighbors and I had a party and I served this.  Everyone loved it!

Yum!!!  Doubled the sauce recipe and added more lemon juice and mushrooms than was called for.  Also just used the extra flour in place of the cornstarch and of course, added the all important CAPERS!!!  Fabulous meal!

I tried this recipe for the first time about a year ago and have since made it 5 or 6 times.  This is incredibly easy and also fairly quick.  Chicken picatta NEEDS capers and added them generously.  Someone else wrote this dish was bland and I must disagree! I remove the chicken and cover it with foil and add a little extra wine, lemon, and broth to the pan and let it reduce.  Then I toss trenette pasta with it and serve the chicken over the pasta.

One of my favorite meals. I made some changes though, I salted and peppered the chicken first then floured it to get some great flavor. I also left out the wine used more lemon and more broth to have more sauce with the chicken. And i add the ALL NECESSARY INGREDIENT: CAPERS... really adds the flavor. I added some mushrooms because I love them and threw it all over a bed of pasta! YUM!

It was good. Took cues from other reviewers; pounded the chicken thin and doubled the sauce. 
I also added Mrs. Dash Table Blend seasoning to both the flour and egg mixtures for more flavor. The only other thing I would change was the  cornstarch thickening.  Next time I'll just use the flour used for dredging.  I served the extra gravy over garlic smashed potatoes & a side of sauteed green beans. Turned out fine.

Ugh, this turned out horrible at first.  It tasted so bland and the chicken never cooked through within the 30 minutes of simmering, which ended up making the sauce way too thick and not enough.  To save it, I had to take the chicken off the skillet, put it in a pot, make up an extra batch of the liquid (broth, wine, lemon juice and cornstarch) and let it simmer for an extra 20 to 30 minutes.  A few dashes of garlic salt and black pepper really de-blanded it and it ended up being really tasty putting it with the extra sauce on top of some penne noodles.  Turned out great afterwards!  Would make it again, but definitely won't follow this recipe to the "t."

I made this dish with both boneless, skinless chicken thighs and thin-sliced chicken breasts, cooked separately in unsalted butter and kept warm in a 350¬∞ oven while I made the sauce.  I only had Sauvignon blanc, so I used that, and it gave the dish amazing flavor. I reduced the sauce for about 15 minutes before putting only the chicken thighs back in the pan, because they required more cooking time.  I simmered it for another 10-12 minutes before spooning the sauce over the chicken from the oven and served it all over pasta that was seasoned with butter, pink salt and pepper.  My husband had three helpings, and had nothing but good things to say about this recipe.  I think it's fantastic and it will be a regular dinner option in our house from now on.  I'll be experimenting with serving it over rice pilaf, on a bed of cooked spinach, etc.  Lots of possibilities with this fabulous dish!

Great basic recipe! A couple small changes I have made are removing the chicken after browning and then adding  a clove of garlic (minced) when I added the mushrooms and onion to the skillet. Once you saute the veggies, add the liquid, stir to mix well and place the chicken back in the skillet to simmer.

I followed other reviewers and removed the chicken from the pan before making the sauce. I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onion and I seasoned the chicken breasts before sauteing them.   I also doubled the sauce and made with thin spaghetti. With those changes everyone really enjoyed this dinner - I will definitely make it again.

Made it tonight using suggestions to double the sauce, add garlic and not cook the chicken in the sauce. Chicken was cooked perfectly but sauce was quite bland. It needs to be richer. I sauteed it down to a very thick consistency but I wont be making this again. If you decide to make it, test it with family before friends.

So delicious! I partially cooked the chicken removed from the pan After the mushrooms and onions were sauteed, I returned the chicken for the remainder of the cooking time. Also added minced garlic. Had with spaghetti with butter, oil and garlic, and a glass of wine, of course!

I made this with angel hair pasta and my wife and I loved it.  It's delicate yet tasty!  Next time I make it, I'll double up on the mushrooms and triple the onions to add more flavor and sustenance to the recipe.  Overall though, it's great!

Made this for guests.  It was a hit.  I too added capers, doubled the sauce recipe and removed the chicken before making the sauce. I also seasoned the chicken with some salt and pepper beforehand. Served it wish roasted vegetables and rice.  Amazing.

Delicious!  Cooked chicken (tenderloins) first, then removed from pan and kept warm (as other reviewers suggested).  Sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic until tender.  Added sauce and simmered 20 minutes, then added chicken back into the pan for the last 3-4 minutes.  It was tender and tasty.  Next time, I will increase the sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit at my house! I did make a few adjustments‚ÄîI pounded the large chicken breasts & also cut them in half, so they would be more tender. I also increased the sauce ingredients so there would be more sauce in the end, and I cooked the mushrooms and onions separately before spooning them over the cooked chicken and then baking it at 350 for about twenty minutes. Delicious! Served this over homemade risotto, which was perfect for soaking up the sauce. Fresh green beans rounded out our meal.

I made this exactly according to the instructions but didn't use the egg dip.  It is superb!  I added 2 TLB of H&H instead of the cornstarch bc we like "creamy" sauces.  The H&H is really not needed however.  This is an outstanding dish and my husband doesn't even like capers but eats them in this dish.  You will love it and this recipe is the BEST!

My wife loved it. I made a few variations by adding a little more smoked paprika, lemon zest and capers. Very flavorful. Left overs today!!! :-)

It gets a five star as my kids and husband loved the addition of the mushrooms. I don‚Äôt usually change the recipes here but in this case I had some heavy / double cream that was just lying around so I used it as a mix with the broth. Turned out quite nice. We omitted the wine since I was worried about the taste for the kids - turns out  this was the first time they‚Äôve asked me for seconds in a while. I had to make a second batch of sauce.

It was very good, but in my opinion lacked some flavor. I might add a bit more salt to the dredge and a bit to the sauce.  But otherwise it was delicious! I served it over fettuccini and my husband loved it.

This is a great recipe! I used chicken tenders instead of breasts  and also added a tablespoon of capers, then served it over linguine.  It is simple to make for week night meals, & special enough to make for company. Delicious!
The addition of an arugula salad with sliced onion, tomatoes,  tuscan-balsamic vinegar & olive oil made for a nice meal.

A delicious variation of chicken piccata.  I made it with no changes except I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  It was a big hit in my family. It had lots of sauce. Served it with linguini and roasted broccoli.  Definitely a keeper.

Love this receipt. My kids and I add a small amount of goat cheese or feta on top of the chicken while it‚Äôs hot and cover with mushroom sauce. It‚Äôs a regular in our dinner rotation.

I had baked chicken thighs to use somehow and choose this recipe.  I sauteed a one slice of diced onions in butter, added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and a sprinkle of paprika.  I sliced the chicken off the bone, used five and added to skillet.  I poured enough chardonnay in to cover the bottom of the skillet and allowed time to heat through.  I sliced mushrooms and decided to add artichoke hearts to the recipe.  How many you use depends on how much meat you use.  This recipe is easy to adjust to the number of people eating.  I added more wine for making enough gravy to coat all.  When the mushrooms were tender, I thickened the sauce with a tablespoon of flour mixed into cold water, added another sprinkle of paprika and salt.  When the sauce was thickened, I stirred to coat all with the gravy and sprinkled 1/3 cup fresh parsley over all. Any dish made in a wine sauce makes for a very special meal at my house.

My entire family loved this with these changes: I did not coat the chicken with the flour, egg, and milk. I cut the chicken into thick strips and sprinkled the pieces with salt and paprika then sauteed it with the butter, onions, and mushrooms. I also added more cornstarch for thickening since I didn't coat the chicken with flour.

Over all very good.  I didn't have white wine on hand so I subbed ACV, which was totally fine and acceptable for taste.  I think the corn starch thickened it a bit too much so I will use less next time.  I served over GF spaghetti because I didn't have angel hair on hand, which is my favorite pasta to pair with this recipe.

I cubed the chicken and flattened the chicken before coating in a mix of flour, paprika, pepper and some lemon zest then pan cooking  in the oil. For the sauce I used equal parts broth and wine to one-half part lemon juice, which gives it a nice lemony taste without the tartness. Also substitute artichoke hearts instead of the onion. One of my wife's favorite dishes (yes, I cook and clean up).

Very good. I browned the chicken, removed it, sauteed the mushrooms and onion, then replaced the chicken and poured the sauce on top. Perfect. I cut the salt in half as that is what I always do but for this recipe I would keep at 1 tsp especially since all the breading does not get used.  I used 4 half breasts and cut each in half so had 8 pieces (about 2.25 lbs of chicken). Agreed, a little bland - needs something to perk up.

I made this last night and it was excellent. I read almost all the reviews first to get a feel for what alterations may be needed. I did not have white wine so I used more of the broth. I actually did not use broth. I used fat free cream of chicken soup with water added. I always substitute Cream of chicken for chicken broth in anything I make. I think it adds flavor. I did take the chicken out of the pan while I put the sauce and mushrooms together like others stated. We will be having this again!

It turned out really well. I added about a cup extra chicken broth and about a half cup more wine and an extra tablespoon of cornstarch so I could mix angel hair noodles in with the sauce. I also still added in the capers while everything was simmering together.

This turned very well.  However, I may cut back on the amount of butter.  The recipe calls for 4 tablespoons.  The butter taste was a little overwhelming. I'm thinking of trying 2 tbsp of butter and 2 of olive oil or canola oil.

Turned out wonderful, chicken was moist I did boneless breasts and non boneless thighs and they cooked fine using the same time.  Did not make any changes to the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Outstanding. Moist chicken and the most flavorful mushroom, lemon, wine and butter sauce. Loved it! Pretty easy though you must pay attention. Cast iron made it I think.

Definitely caries out for capers.  Also I would mix corn starch with T.  of col water and add separately, not with other wet ingredients as noted.

I made this according to recipe and it was delicious!  Lots of compliments from my daughter & son in law.  I did slice my chicken breast in half lengthwise to get thinner pieces and then used a tenderizer mallet to give them uniform thickness.  I browned the chicken first in butter & avocado oil, and removed it to a plate to keep warm while I saut√©ed the onions & mushrooms and then added the rest of the sauce ingredients.  Put the chicken in the sauce for a couple minutes & served it. Delicious!

I used skinless chicken thighs. I also used clarified butter for frying which allowed me to fry the chicken at a higher temperature.  It really helped to get the chicken nicely browned. Served over jasmine rice.  I would definitely make this again.

Delicious!  My changes:  I sauteed the chicken on each side COVERED, then removed from pan so as not to overcook.  Then sauteed the onions and mushrooms with some garlic in the pan drippings.  Once those were soft, I deglazed with a cup of water and 3/4 cup of white sauvignon blanc (I didn't have broth on hand - a crime!).  Then I added the chicken back in and also added the lemon juice and grilled artichoke hearts with its own juice, a really premium quality out of a jar, that was just delicious.   Brought everything to a boil then lowered the heat to medium-low and simmered for 13 minutes.  The sauce tightened up, and the chicken was very, very tender.  It actually tasted better the next day, as the sauce all came together.  The flavors were WOW - and I did not miss the chicken broth at all.  Will DEFINITELY make this a staple recipe for my familia!

Not sure who owns one pan that can cook 6 chicken breast halves, half-pound of mushrooms, a cup of broth, onions, etc etc all in one pan.....without basically submerging the chicken in liquid and boiling it. My tip would be to cook the sauce and chicken separately and ensure the sauce isn't too thin. Use extra cornstarch and/or boil to reduce. I'd also go lighter on the broth and use more wine and/or lemon juice to help increase flavour. This dish is typically served with angel hair pasta.

Hubby actually exclaimed after first bite, "THIS IS AMAZING".  I very rarely get that kind of response. I usually have to ask. I will take the chicken out before making the sauce and put it back in to simmer next time. That will allow the sauce to thicken up better and allow me to see if I need additional cornstarch. Also, I made 3X three flour and egg mixtures. If i'm going to bread something then I want it super breaded.

Wonderful flavor. I substituted rosemary for the paprika. Used chicken cutlets in lieu of breasts, so I took the chicken out of the sauce for ten minutes of its cooking time, put it back in for the last ten minutes. Excellent!

I've made this quite a few times, and it's always a hit. The paprika in the flour is a nice touch, don't skip it! Sometimes I add capers, artichokes and/or sundried tomatoes. It's fast, easy, and the whole family likes it. I follow cooking instructions but will also remove chicken to make sauce then add it back in. A definite keeper and regular dish in our home.

This is a really good, easy recipe.

I did do a couple of things differently. I took the chicken out before making the sauce, as many others did. I also made a roux with 1T of the butter and some of the flour from the dredging.

This turned out fantastic!  I had to make a couple of changes.  Used unsalted chicken stock and added lemon pepper to the seasoned flour (didn't have any white wine or lemon juice).  Also added half of teaspoon poultry seasoning to the sauce.

very nice receipt cooked as instructed but added some extra butter to the sauce at end of cooking cycle to give sauce a smoother finish. Added some dry roasted garlic flakes about 1 teaspoon ,just 5 minutes before sauce was finished. Finished off with parsley

Very good.  Thanks for sharing.  I made it good but simple by coating only with panko and used some garlic.

I made this recipe last night and my husband and I thought it was delicious!  This is definitely a recipe I will make again.  I reduced the recipe to 3 breasts and had the perfect amount of sauce.  Do not reduce the amount of sauce, even if you only make 3 chicken breasts.  Also, I pounded my chicken to make it lay flatter.

This is a pretty nice recipe although it could use more seasoning.  I added spinach and sun dried tomatoes and a lot more lemon.  I doubled all the liquids and threw some lemon slices in for looks.  If I make this again I'll add garlic and more salt at a minimum.  It was very attractive and would make a nice meal for guests.

I have this dish when we attend functions at our local Italian hall and loved it so I thought I would give it a try. GREAT recipe!

I marinated the chicken in white wine and lemon zest for 8hrs. Turned out great!

I agree with other reviewers  that this was bland. I added fresh rosemary to the flour mix, but otherwise prepared as written. Sauce was runny and tasteless. I will probably not make this again.

I made exactly as written.  I didn't care for it at all.  I felt it was pretty bland. My husband said it was "alright".  I only made 3 chicken breast and there really was not enough sauce.  It was thickened enough right away but the recipe said to simmer it for 25 minutes. I knew I'd have no sauce left if I did so I turned it off at 20.  All I could taste was chicken and lemon.  Really needed more salt and flavoring.  Sorry, just not for me.

I loved this recipe, just the right amount of lemon, though I did put lemon slices in with the mushrooms and a tbsp of capers.

This was a very tasty easy to prepare dish.  The directions were clear and easy to follow.  My family enjoyed it.  We made it as directed with no substitutions or additions.  This is good served over rice or egg noodles with steamed vegetables.

Very, very good! Chicken was super moist and tasty.  I did  make changes: pumped up the seasonings in flour, per reviewers, and used Bisquick instead of flour, as I had a box that I wanted to finish. Unfortunately, I added capers, as suggested by some reviewers. This was an excellent dish, with the exception of the capers, which both my fiance and I found added an "off" flavor to the dish. Will make again, without the capers. Thank you for this recipe.

I was very excited about this recipe but was disappointed when I made it. I followed other recommendations by taking the chicken out setting it aside while I made the sauce. The chicken was tasty and I would make again. However, the sauce was disappointing. It was missing something. It almost tasted like the base of French onion soup but did not have enough depth. I do not think I will make this again.

Served over linguine...did add capers and some chopped fresh parsley to the sauce. I also removed chicken to warming oven so I could fully develop the sauce. I did return chicken to sauce  and turned and basted while the sauce simmered. Next time I make this I will add lemon zest to ramp up the lemon taste I also added salt and pepper to taste.

We are still eating it because I doubled the recipe and tripled the mushrooms. One thing I did was thinly slice a lemon into the dish before warming in the oven; People who like citrus can ingest it and people who don't, can put it aside. I made a roux with the fluids and flour and added pepper. If I did it again, I'd not dredge the chicken first and just cook it on a flatiron griddle. But who really can argue with such a successful belly warmer? Thanks.

Love love love this. It could use and increase in the sauce because it tends to cook away. I would probably at leadt double it

Very nice. I made it with just 2 chicken breasts but keeping the sauce amount. I used mushroom stock instead of chicken one and instead of wine. I will bake the chicken in the oven intead of frying it.

Very good dish. Simple and quick. I prepped everything and my 6 year old cooked it. Great dish for young chefs. He cooked the chicken then set it aside. Then added the mushroom onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Added the liquid and let simmer then returned chicken to the pan to finish cooking. However, the sauce wasn't lemony enough for us so next time I will be adding another tbsp of lemon and a 1/2 tsp salt to the sauce. We also added 2 tbsp capers.

Amazing! I went to crack an egg and...ooops....forgot I hard boiled them all. Worked just fine with milk only. Also, I didnt use any cornstarch, just a little flour and it was great! 
My picky 11 yr old son and I love this recipe. Will definitely make again soon.

So good...Just added a shallot and garlic when I added the onions. I add fround flax and chia to the flour to make it healthier. My 7yr old had no idea and love it. I saut√©ed in coconut  oil and light butter.

Was delicious. A little on the rich side. So next time, if I want something less rich, I may use olive oil instead of butter.

Seriously the most delicious dish EVER!  I started off and made it for Mother's Day last year and have since made it six times!  Every time someone new tries it they call it gourmet.  It's off the hook and the recipe is to the T which is so helpful when you are running out of time, you pull it up and print it and hope that it explains and works for you.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

I thought this was really good. I paired it with angel hair pasta. One suggestion I would make is to pound the chicken breasts to about 1/2" thick. This will make them cook faster. It took a long time to cook the chicken and I think mine dried out a little due to that. Other than that, the steps are great!

It was ok. i decided to cut the chicken into bites before cooking... my sauce turned out very thick. 

It was quite tasty despite the thickness... it would great with rice!

Really tasty and super easy. I modified it a tiny bit to make it a bit more flavorful. My changes: added 3 crushed garlic cloves with the onions; removed chicken from pan after initial saut√©ing.  Added them back in during last 10 minutes of simmering the gravy; a few minutes before serving I added sliced artichokes (from jar), capers and precooked asparagus. Added some additional salt and pepper. Voila!

Needed a last minute dinner for thin sliced chicken, and this did the trick! We didn't have mushrooms, but it was still crazy delicious. I can't wait for when we *do* have mushrooms! My husband took all of the leftovers for lunch today and said it was even better on the second day! lol

Loved it! To make it low carb, I eliminated the breading and cornstarch. On the side, I served  thin-sliced yellow squash and zucchini sauteed in butter and garlic. Really delicious.

This was a great recipe, however, I made a few changes to add some more flavor.

I used skinless dark meat thigh meat, as dark meat is more forgiving, and will not dry out like white meat.
Rather than making the sauce separately, I made it all together in the pan and it was fabulous!
No cornstarch used for my family, as we do not use this, and it was still great!

This dish was restaurant quality and enjoyed by the four of us. However, I think there are some pointers that can make a difference. I used thin breasts and chopped each into two pieces. (Total of 1.25 lbs) I didn't use the egg wash but added additional seasonings to the flour: Italian seasoning, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, pepper.  (I omitted onion from the dish.) The extra seasonings  added to the flavor. I fried the chicken until browned and removed them from the pan and kept them warm in the oven, preventing overcooking. After simmering  the wine, lemon juice, and chicken broth for a few minutes, I added capers, the chicken, and  previously saut√©ed mushrooms. (Taste the wine! If you don't like the taste,you won't like your dish.)  Capers are essential to the dish!  I  put a layer of fresh baby spinach on top, removed the pan from the burner, and let it sit for a few minutes. I served this with Parmesan orzo with a few cherry tomatoes and steamed broccoli. Both were perfect side dishes. Many reviewers doubled the sauce and served over angel hair pasta, but I thought the recipe had the perfect amount of sauce  for orzo and the flavors were superb together!

Being new to the world of cooking I found this recipe easy to follow, with not to many weird ingredients that I'd not even heard of. The outcome was a success, lovely tasty succulent chicken pieces with flavoursome rice. Will definitely be making this again.

I used chicken thighs and sherry to replace the white wine, will update on how everyone liked it. They all said it was good, I thought it was lacking flavor. Nothing really stood out and I actually added salt on my plate. I would flavor it up the next time.

I will make this again! We all loved it. I omitted the milk, because my son is lactose intolerant. I did throw in some garlic and added some steamed broccoli when we plated it. I had to pull out the chicken before adding mushrooms and onions, because I had no room in the pan. Followed everything else exactly and think it's a great recipe.

I adjusted this recipe just a tad, but I know the original way would be just as good. I didn't have any white wine so I just used chicken broth. The main change was after browning the chicken I put to the side and finished everything else up then put the chicken in the sauce just to heat through. My son (6) said, "Mom, this chicken is GREAT!". Everyone wanted seconds, that wins it for me.  Definitely will make this again.

So, so good!  I followed the directions exactly, except I cooked the chicken all the way through initially, and then set aside while the sauce simmered.  I didn't want the breading to become soggy.  Next time I will make 4x's the sauce and serve on a bed of angel hair pasta.  I could have licked the pan, the sauce was so good!  I used Barefoot, Pinot Grigio, which I think is a little too sweet to drink as is, but was prefect for the sauce.  Thank you!

I made this again and it was just as good as it was the first time! My only accident, I forgot to saut√©e the mushrooms with the chicken, and put them in the sauce.  They were really good, but would have been better saut√©ed!

Such good chicken.  The only changes we made were to use an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, seasoned salt, and the leftover breading flour instead of cornstarch (added to the mushrooms and onions first).  Chicken was tender and juicy, and the sauce was delicious.

I upped the lemon juice to 2.5 TSP and it still needed a little more. 3 TBS is probably about right.

So easy and really delicious. Very pleasantly surprised. Will definitely make this one again. Doubled the mushrooms. Could always use more. Served with brown rice and steamed green beans sprinkled with some margarine and bread crumbs.

I thought this was really good prepared as directed.  My kids (8 and 10) weren't overly impressed but they don't like mushrooms and picked them all off.  Next time I may try to add some garlic just because I like garlic but it was tasty as written.  I did use cooking white wine which is what I had on hand and since that has salt I should have cut back on the added salt in the flour mixture.

I did tweak this just slightly - I added some garlic powder to the flour mixture and increased the amount of sauce (1-1/2 cups chicken broth; 3/4 cup white wine; juice of 1 lemon). I'm glad I increased the sauce amount, otherwise I think it would have been short on sauce. I also added capers in the end, at hubby's request. Tasty meal! We served ours over linguine.

This dish was delicious.  I used thin cutlets and after  I saut√© them I put them on a cookie sheet in a low oven to cook a bit more (about 20 min).  I then saut√© the wet ingredients and I also used capers along with the mushrooms, poured it over the chicken ...5 more minutes in the oven, then done.  My family loved it.  This was the first time I made chicken piccata...loved it!

This was delicious.  Made it as is and the whole family loved it.  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand.  Tasted very much like the restaurant version.  Will definitely make again.

Overall this is a really great recipe!  Since we are gluten and dairy-free, I used GF all-purpose flour and replaced the butter with olive oil.  I also doubled all of the sauce ingredients because my family loves sauce.  Other than that, I stuck with the recipe.  The only change I would make is to NOT double the amount of lemon juice in the sauce...my family agreed that the sauce was too "lemony" for their taste.  I will definitely be making this one again though.

This was tasty. I decided to bake mine in the oven covered instead of on the stove top. Baked at 350 for about 25 mins. I added 2 cloves of garlic, a few sprigs of lemon thyme and used fresh chives for garnish in place of parsley.  Served with a green salad, and some baby yellow potatoes.

Delish!!! I followed the recipe adding in "Crazy Mixed-Up Salt" for the salt and "Gluten Free Flour" for the flour. I cut my chicken breast to 1/2" cutlets, then pounded out to 1/4" to get more out of the recipe for leftovers. I'm low carb-ing so this was wonderful. It was so tender and so delicious. It's a keeper!

Easy and delicious.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful.  The only difference I made from the original recipe was to add a can of mushroom pieces and stems in addition to the 1/2 pound fresh mushroom.  My guys love mushrooms and loved this chicken.

Absolutely delicious!  I had a bottle of chardonnay from a trip to Maryland which I used. Of course since I opened the bottle, we had the rest of it to drink with dinner.  Served this with baked potatoes and steamed asparagus.  It was so good!  I didn't change a thing. Hubby would comment every now and then thru dinner, "This is really good!"  So glad I have some to take for lunch tomorrow.

This was a delicious and easy dinner. The chicken was moist and the flavor wasn't too overpowering. I did add garlic powder and black pepper to the flour mix, which just added to the overall flavor.

Wonderful - easy - fast to fix. I made this twice in one week, it's so good.  Then I branched out and substituted center cut loin pork chops -- loved them, as well!

This is absolutely delicious! My husband who isn't a big chicken fan even loves it. I browned the chicken then removed it, saut√©ed onion and mushroom and added sauce then put chicken back in to simmer. I used fresh lemon and good white wine. Amazing. We have it at least once per month. Thank you Karen!

I made this recipe last night and followed the recipe without deviations. It smelled delicious, but when my husband and I ate it there was absolutely no flavor. I will not make it again.  Very disappointing.

We loved this! I followed the recipe for the most part other than just shaking the chicken in the flour mix in a zip-loc bag and  removing the chicken after browning as almost everyone seemed to do. I did place the breasts back in on the sauce, slightly reduced, and let it simmer about 10 more minutes to be sure the chicken was done. It had wonderful flavor and the chicken was so moist! I think a good salt/pepper ratio is needed in this recipe. It is a definite keeper and will make it again soon! Thank you!

My family loved this and thought it could be served at a fine dining restaurant. I added 1/4 cup sliced black olives to the sauce and instead of parsley, I garnished with capers.  I served it over Angel Hair pasta and will definitely serve this to guests.  Sooo good!

I really loved this!  I used sweet yellow onion and I added a tad more lemon juice than called for.  I also added a couple of TBS of capers!  Scrumptious!!  I would add even more lemon in the future as it wasn't very lemony, (and husband said he'd like it lemon-ier) but all in all...very, very good! Will def make again!

The only change I made to this recipe was using thighs instead of breasts.  So yummy.  Allowing it to simmer for 20 min. really allowed the chicken to soak up the flavor.  Served over noodles.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I used 8 chicken breast tenders in place of the 6 breast halves and served it over rice with steamed broccoli.  I didn't want to use so much butter, so I used 2 T butter with 2 T olive oil.  It worked great, but the butter was burning by the time the chicken was browned (perhaps because I had the heat too high).  So I wiped out the pan and added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil for sauteing the mushrooms and onions, then added the chicken back and poured the sauce over the top.  The chicken was so tender and delicious and the lemon/wine flavor was amazing!  Will definitely make this again!

I scaled this recipe down to two servings for my husband and I and it was fabulous!  I didn't have any white wine in the house so I substituted vermouth but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and this recipe was absolutely delicious!  A definite keeper!!!  Thanks so much for sharing it with us!!!  I'm making it again tonight and we just had it a few days ago!!!

Chicken: Flour, egg, flour again and then chilled before frying. I also first sauted the chicken and onion, transfered chicken to oven to keep warm and then made the sauce in the pan.  I also doubled the sauce, although I didn't double the wine. Had to use jarred mushrooms which I didn't saute but just put into the sauce. Added capers also.  Served with buttery, lemon pepper fettuccine.  With these changes, very good.  Really liked the sauce.

I began with step 3, reduced sauce mixture to desired consistency and kept it warm in pan of hot water on stove.  I also added some cayenne pepper to give the sauce a little zip.  I avoided step 1 by using (really!) supermarket-prepared chicken pieces.  After I saut√©ed the chicken, I removed pieces to a warming platter, saut√©ed the mushrooms and onions and removed them as well.  When ready to serve I returned warm chicken, mushrooms and onions to pan and poured heated mixture on top.  It worked out very well.

Had I read the reviews first, it would have turned out better. I am not an expert cook. I didn't know you needed to remove the chicken and then saute the veges separately. The directions didn't say to do this. Thus, running out of room in my pan. It wasn't horrible. Next time I'll remove the chicken.

Really delicious and easy to prepare.  I added green peppers since I needed to get some used and they 'fit' well.  Will make again.

This was alright.  The flavor was enjoyable, but I did add a few things just because the original recipe sounded bland.  I added extra onion as well as fresh garlic, black pepper, and Italian seasoning.  I was not amazed, but with these additions I might have rated it better except that, as another reviewer indicated, the sauce did not reduce and I ended up with a soupy mess.

My husband LOVED this dish. This was his first time eating piccata. I have always had veal piccata but decided to try this recipe out since I had chicken breasts on hand. I enjoyed it but my husband couldn't stop raving about it. I doubled the sauce because we love sauce and added doubled the paprika with the flour mixture. Also added capers at the end and husband found a new love for capers. He didn't use to like capers but in this dish it was perfect.

GREAT! the only thing I did different was I pounded the chicken to 1/4" thickness to cook quicker. This is definately a keeper.

Delicious!  I cut the chicken into 1" strips instead of halves, and used blueberry mead instead of white wine.  I also used twice as many onions as the recipe calls for.  It turned out looking beautiful, and tasted wonderful!  I would definitely make this recipe again!... and again... and again...

I'm not a great cook, but I can follow directions. This is the BEST chicken I have ever cooked in my life (I'm not kidding). I will definatly use this on a regular basis. It looks and tastes elegant but is quite easy.

I changed the recipe slightly after reading the other reviews. As the sauce simmered I added a sprig of rosemary and removed it before serving. It was just what the recipe needed to chase the blandness away. I'm saving this recipe to make over and over again!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We did think that the wine was a little over powering so will use a little less next time. I used a Chardanay. Maybe I used the wrong white wine. I will also add a little more cornstarch to the broth. We like a little thicker sauce. Will cook this again for sure.

Wow!!  This tastes better than some dishes I've had at Italian restaurants!   I used chicken tenderloins so they did cook up faster.   I didn't use an egg, just dredged them in the flour/paprika/salt mixture.   I will definitely make this again and again!  Thank you!

This didn't work out too well for me, unfortunately.  Followed the recipe exactly, but the lemon juice dominated all flavors.  If there were to be a next time, I would use a quarter of what the recipe calls for.

I'm serious, this recipe was out of control.  Very very good.  Might experiment with some other ingredients next time, but just because I like to try different variations.  This recipe was awesome as is presented in the main recipe.

I expected more rich flavors because of the butter and wine, but this dish was average.  I'll keep looking for the perfect piccata recipe.

The taste of wine was overpowering in the sauce, and the chicken flour coating didn't stay. Next time I'll reduce the wine and marinate the chicken with just paprika for a while.

Sauce is good but only the faintest taste of lemon.  If you are a lemon fan I would definately add more.  I made this recipe as stated except I removed the chicken while I browned the onion and mushrooms.  I think with more lemon and fresh garlic added this recipe would be 5 stars.

I followed the recipe as instructed but I baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees after combining all of the ingredients.  Excellent and served over home made egg noodles.

This was ok. Felt like it lacked flavor or something. If I were to make again, I would use Italian bread crumbs (possibly mixed with parmesean) instead of flour, add capers, use real lemon juice (squeezed from actual lemon), and use a chicken bouilian cube mixed in water. As of right now, I would not make this recipe again.

This was very tasty. The only changes that I made were I used arrow root instead of the corn starch and I did not cook the chicken as long as stated. By  not cooking as long the chicken was extremely moist. Very flavorful and a nice change from the regular chicken and mushrooms.

I didn't have chicken on hand (I know, when does that ever happen?) so I made this recipe with boneless pork chops. It was sooo good! The only thing I changed was to add a bit of garlic when cooking the other veggies and tossed in some capers toward the end of the simmering time. I also doubled the sauce ingredients so we'd have plenty to go over the mashed potatoes I made to go along with the chops. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a really good recipe!  I didn't want to use wine so I used all low-sodium Natural Goodness chicken broth. After sauteing the chicken, I removed it and cooked the onions and mushrooms by themselves...and then put in the chicken broth, lemon juice, and arrow root (instead of corn starch). I then put the chicken back in.  I did this because I was afraid the chicken would be overcooked.  It turned out perfect.  I will make this again!!

Oh my!!!! I came home from a hard day and started looking for a easy tasty chicken dish. Wow I found it. If I could give more stars I would. I didn't have corn starch in the house so I just used the leftover flour mixture to thicken the sauce. Thank you so much for sharing.

I've tried several piccata recipes and this one is by far my favorite. I add lots of capers and white wine.

This recipe was wonderful!! I doubled the sauce part, because we like the "gravy" on our mashed potatoes...Even my 7 year old daughter loved it!! She was bummed when she found out her dad ate the leftovers!!

Delicious! I made following the recipe exactly and it was great. Next time I will try without breading the chicken as some have suggested. Didn't really taste the lemon too much though

Turned out really good!  Only thing I would recommend is flattening chicken before frying to ensure thorough cooking or to slice into strips.  I put the whole breasts into the oven to bake since I wasn't sure they were cooked thru and it also crisped them up some more.  I then added them back to the sauce in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Will for sure make again!

I tried this recipe and loved it! I doubled the recipe and followed the exact directions except I used canned mushrooms. The only thing I will change next time, will be less lemon juice, it came out too lemony when doubling the recipe. I cannot wait to have this again. It's a great dinner choice for company, thanks for sharing!

Thanks for posting this recipe~we now have a new addition to our dinner options! I didn't have any wine, so I used more chicken broth. I also used Mrs. Dash, which really livens it up.

Gotta give this one all five stars.It was fabulous. Easy to make and very tasty. The only thing I did was add more garlic. Will definitely become a staple.

Fabulous!  I made it without mushrooms because I didn't have any on-hand, but I'm certain they would've added even more to this dish.  I also made it a bit more "heart healthy" by using 3 tablespoons  of Smart Balance spread in lieu of the butter/margarine and omiting entirely the  milk and egg (just tossed chicken cutlets in the flour mixture.  It still created a nice crust!)   My husband kept commenting on how great it smelled while I was cooking it.  Even my kids ate this!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Very good dish.  I also added capers and artichoke hearts - delicious almost a meal in itself.  I had no wine on hand so I used extra chicken broth and lemon juice.  Looks elegant and tastes great, a nice "company" dish.  Thank you Karen!

Great. I love the tang from the wine. I've made this multiple times and everyone seems to enjoy it! The capers added to it defenitly make it even more yummy
