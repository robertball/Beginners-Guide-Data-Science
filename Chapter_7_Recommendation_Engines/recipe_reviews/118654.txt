I made this recipe tonight, in attempts to get my kids to eat more veggies.  I can't say that I was all that impressed.  I love veggies myself and something about this recipe just wasn't right.  I'm thinking that maybe I marinated the veggies too long because they almost had a pickled taste?  Also, I attempted to make this two differne ways, I did half in the frying pan, and half in the oven (at 400 degrees).  Next time if I decide to try to adapt this recipe I'll put them in the oven at about 375.  Out of all the veggies I liked the white potato the best (I did summer squash, carrots, cauliflower and potatoes)  I might try this again without the lemon juice.
