Boy, I hate people that say they loved or hated a recipe and changed it... but here I go. 
I knew I wanted to make something like this- I had a graham cracker crust, strawberries, and whipping cream and an impromptu cookout with the neighbors in 2 hours. 
This worked perfectly. I made the following modifications: I didn't have unflavored gelatin, so I used strawberry flavored. I also really wanted more strawberry, so added an additional half cup. The filling was then pink, so I spread some plain white whipped topping on top, and topped with some sliced decorative strawberries and sugar.
The neighbors were quite impressed and happy with it. 
2 hours was enough to mostly solidify it, but more time would probably be better.
I'll definitely make it again- it was cool and refreshing for a cookout.
