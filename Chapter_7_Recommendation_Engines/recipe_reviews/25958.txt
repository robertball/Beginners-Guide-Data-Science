This recipe is very much like the one I have used for over 20 years.  To stop the cake from cracking while cooking, leave cake in oven after turning off the heat, leave oven door ajar. Ten minutes later, run a thin bladed knife around the edge to release the cake from the pan, put back in oven and let cool until oven is cold. Take out of oven and let cake cool completely to room temperature before placing in cooler or fridge.
I have used this method for many years professionally and found that it works every time. The main trick is not to overcook the cake, cook only until the centre is "jiggely" not firm. It will firm up as it cools.

I made this for a dinner party, and it turned out perfectly. No cracks-- the secret? Don't put the oven on 350. It's best to bake it at a lower temp. I put it on about 330 or so (and 55 minutes). Also, make sure that you cool it in the oven before you put it in the refridgerator: too soon and it will crack.

Okay this is for sure a 5 star recipie! A couple things though. If you do not add your own flavoring it can be pretty boring. I added lemon extract, lemon juice and lemon zest. I served it with ras puree. I also left out all the spices for the crust. Another time I made it I used sugar cookies for the crust. That was wonderful! As far as cracks go..LEAVE int he over for a couple hours after you turn the oven off. I never get cracks and I always follow that rule. Also, I had the oven on 340 and only cooked it with the oven on for 30 min. Left it in the oven for another 2 hours. It will continue to cook in the heat just don't open the door! Great recipie!

This was a good cheesecake.  BUT the top browned too much for my liking.  I read reviews about it cracking, so I let the cheesecake cool in the oven. Literally, once it was done, we went to a Christmas celebration and I didn't take it out until we got home(2 hours later)- no cracks!! I also didn't over mix the filling.  I used our mixer on the lowest setting the entire time. The crust is okay.  I agree with another review that stated it's kinda a distraction from tasting the flavor of the cheesecake. Next time I'll use a basic graham cracker crust.  I also looked into it browning on the top.  I found an article about the baking temp. Apparently cheesecakes should be baked at 250-300 degrees.  Next time I will bake it at 300 degrees for about 80-90 minutes.

Edit:  I just made this for Christmas yesterday.  I baked it at 300 degrees for about 80 minutes, and I had NO brown top!!  I left if in the oven to cool for 30 minutes, then cracked the door and left it in for another 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  NO cracks, and I didn't go through the trouble of using a water bath.

I usually make my own recipe cheesecake, but decided to try this one b/c this sounded really good, and is a 'high' cheesecake. Have yet to taste (still in oven), but smells heavenly. I normally dont use a waterbath, but what I do to avoid cracks is place the springform pan on a very sturdy baking sheet when cooking, and never open the oven door. You can easily watch it from using the light switch, of course. When done, turn off oven and leave it in there for an hour, or leave door open ajar. Always refrigerate cheesecake for at least a day or more for optimum flavor, before serving. Never use 'whipped' cream cheese, always buy the 'block' cream cheese, that should always be softened.

Great cheesecake!  I am on the Atkins diet, so I have modified this recipe slightly.  I use 1 1/2 cups almonds finely ground in the food processor for the crust and replace the sugar with 3 packets of Splenda.  I use Atkins bake mix in place of the flour in the filling and use 24 packets of Splenda in place of the sugar.  It is great and made that way has very few carbs.

Being a cheesecake fanatic, I found this recipe made a good cheesecake although not the best I have ever had.  The cheesecake filling was rich and extremely heavy (still waiting for it to digest).  This recipe was very easy to follow, although it made far too much cheesecake filling so I just made a second cheesecake to use up the extras. 
To avoid cracking, make sure you do not overbeat your cheesecake mixture, use a water bath whilst baking and bake at a lower temperature. After baking, cool cheesecake in oven with door open, once the oven has cooled down, take cheesecake out to finish off cooling. Once cooled, refrigerate overnight.

I have a bakery and am always looking for good recipes. I made 3 of the cheesecakes from this page and had people taste test them, they voted this one 2nd in taste.  However, this cheesecake cracked very badly, and since appearance is important, I won't make this one again.

I served this cheesecake for an occasion where it was very important to me that it turned out right.  I studied quite a few recipes before deciding on this one, which I chose because of the additions, significant ones at that, of both heavy cream and sour cream. I’m not a big fan of heavy, dense, dry cheesecakes and the smooth and creamy texture I anticipated was exactly what this delivered.  Because a basic cheesecake with a fresh raspberry sauce was what I planned, I used a standard chocolate wafer crust rather than the spiced up version directed in the recipe.  This cheesecake couldn’t have done me more proud.  I baked it in a water bath and even tho’ it appears condensation caused some water seepage, I don’t know how a cheesecake could have turned out any better.  I admit I was a little nervous about the rather large amounts of sour cream and heavy cream, but after making, serving and eating this cheesecake myself I’m convinced it IS the large amounts of sour cream and heavy cream that made this cheesecake such a hit, so extraordinarily delicious.

Easy to make and tasted great.  I lined the springform pan with foil and then placed pan into a 9 by 13 pan with 2 inches of water at the bottom.  There were no cracks when it came out.  Thanks!!

This was the first time I ever made a cheesecake and this one is out of this world.  I only have 1 question.  I have made it twice and both times I have cracks going through it.  What am I doing wrong.  I never see this in a store bought cheesecake.

Thank you for an incredible cheesecake.  This is the best tasting recipe I have ever found for cheesecake.  It turned out perfectly.  For my husband's birthday, I also used the same recipe and swirled strawberry juice into the batter after I had put it in the pan -very pretty.  I topped it with a strawberry sauce and it tasted great.  Better than any store-bought cheesecake!!

This recipe is just what I was looking for.  I wanted a New York style base to use for many different variations.  I've tried lemon biscotti with crushed biscotti and lemon zest for the crust.  Lemon zest in the batter and lemon curd on the top after it has cooled.  Oreo cookies for the crust and in the batter.  Melted dark Dove chocolate candy on the top.  I've tried it with lemon or lime.  Chocolate crust and semisweet chocolate bits in the batter and melted semisweet bits, pecan pieces and caramels on top.  The variations could be endless.  Orange and mango, peach and mango.  Triple chocolate and Grand Marnier.  White chocolate and raspberry.  Triple chocolate and raspberry.  Yep, this was the basic recipe I was looking for.  And I use the water bath while baking.  Also, I bake for 60 minutes, turn off the oven and leave it there for another hour with the door cracked.  It works like a charm.

You're overbeating your mixture.

This cheesecake is absolutely delicious! Since I
have a cholesterol problem and my husband is a
diabetic, I substituted 1/3 less fat cream cheese, lite sour cream, and evaporated skim milk
for the full fat ingredients; I used splenda in-
stead of sugar. It still turned out beautifully!

This recipe was very easy and delicious, and I made mine with a strawberry sauce.  Since it is towards the end of the strawberry season and my strawberries weren't that ripe, I soaked them in some water, Triple Sec (it has orange based acidity in it) and sugar for about 2 hours.  The strawberries were soft and plump, and sweet.  To make additional homemade sauce, I simmered another 10 strawberries, 1 cup water and sugar on the stove.  Then I removed it and added a TB of strawberry jelly. I  blended it all and added sugar to taste. Once it cooled I scooped some of the sauce over the strawberries on each individual slice cheesecake slice.

This is only the second cheesecake I've ever made, and I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  I did the water bath by wrapping the bottom of the springform pan with two layers of foil and setting inside a cookie sheet with sides.  After putting into the oven I carefully poured hot water into the cookie pan.  I did end up baking the crust for only 6 min. and the cheesecake for 50 min. because my oven seems to bake super fast.  After it was done baking, I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in there with the door cracked open for about 3 or 4 hours, and then I cooled it the rest of the way on the counter before putting it into the fridge over night.  I had no cracks and it came out of the pan perfectly.  I served it with cherry pie filling on the top.  Sooooo good!  It's a very light kind of cheesecake.  Thanks for a great recipe!

this recipie is a great basic cheesecake recipie. in order to stop it from cracking you should bake it in a water bath. that keep the air in your oven humid enough to prevent cracking.

Great recipe!!!  Wonderful crust and very smooth silky texture.  I used 2 Tbs. vanilla, I prefer a bolder vanilla flavor.   After baking, I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in to cool slowly for about an hour and a half.   No cracks and it de-paned  perfectly...   Thanks for this wonderful recipe...  It’s a “keeper”!

I have had problems with it cracking before, but I don't mind that. I have never used walnuts in the bottom before, but just a basic graham cracker crust. To get some variety out of this recipe I like to sub flavored yogurt for the heavy cream (like raspberry yogurt, then top with fresh raspberries). Also works to add lime zest and lime juice to make a key lime cheesecake.

I love this and so does my entire family. I love how it is lighter then normal cheesecake... or at least thats how mine comes out. It is a foolproof recipe for novice bakers. I have made three of these within a week. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

Yum. Very creamy. And everyone loved the crust! I don't like walnuts, so I used pecans instead. And also cut back a little on the spices (as suggested by other reviewers). I cut back a bit on the flour too. And I used the water bath...no cracks. After 1 hour, I turned off the oven, and left the cake in there for a few hours, before puttting in the fridge. I just saw a cooking show with a great tip on cutting a cheesecake...run a thin knife under hot water, wipe off, and when you cut, don't come back up, pull the knife out the side, no mess.

What a great cheesecake.  Baked wonderfully.  The crust is a little spicy, so if you're not crazy for that kind of thing I suggest cutting the spices in half.  I did find it took away from the true cheesecake flavor.

I just made the cheesecake part as we don't like graham cracker crusts so I used the crust from New York Cheesecake III. I only used 1/2 cup of cream as the batter was very liquidy. I did not use a water bath when baking, after 60 minutes it was still jiggly, I turned off the oven and let the cheesecake sit for another 60 minutes in the oven, then I chilled overnight in the fridge. No cracks and the texture was perfect, served with homemade cherry pie filling and whipped cream.

This turned out fantastic! If you use store bought graham cracker crusts, there will be enough for 2 pies.  I accidentally bought neufchatel cream cheese and it did not seem to matter.  This was a project that my teenage son and 2 friends did to take a break from homework. I did not help at all and it turned out delicious.  It went so well they are going to make another batch tomorrow.

I made this for dessert at our Christmas Eve dinner.  It was really good.  I did get a split in the top but I didn't have a springform pan to bake it in.  I had purchased some cherry pie filling for on top but this was so rich and delicious that no one used it.  I will make this again for sure after I purchase myself the proper pan so it looks as great as it tastes.

I had only purchased 3 packages of cream cheese, so that is why I tried this recipe.  It was wonderful!  I served it for guests, and they loved it too.  It is the only cheesecake that I have made that did not crack.  I will definitely be making this again.

Good recipe-I didn't care for the spices in the crust-found them distracting when at first I thought what a great idea. I'll stick with a plain crust from now on.

I am shocked that this cheescake got such rave reviews.  I baked it tonight (for Christmas Eve tomorrow) and it cracked everywhere and it blew up, sending cheesecake all over my oven.  I normally make one every year for Christmas Eve and I thought this was the recipe I'd been using.  I am really bummed!  I tasted it, it tastes fine.  The texture stinks.  It's wiggly like jello and was hard to get out of the pan!

An outstanding traditional cheesecake recipe.  I doubled the crust recipe and layered the bottom only.  Also, I highly recommend using a water bath.  If your not sure whether or not your springform pan is water tight you can take an oven bag, trim it leaving around 6 inches at the bottom, then place the pan inside. Or you can go buy a high dollar pan ;)

This recipe was excellent, very easy to make and delicious to eat.  Made as a gift for friends.  They loved it.  It's cheesecake, much lighter in texture and taste.  And the crust was terrific.  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent cheesecake.  I topped it with fresh berries.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp of lemon juice, just to add a little citrus flavor.  Yummy.

The cheesecake cracked badly, and the crust burned.  The flavor of both was good though, but I think adjustments need to be made to cooking temperature and length in order for me to try this recipe again.

Cheesecake is my favourite dessert, so I have very discerning tastes when it comes to this decadent delight.  This is a great basic cheesecake recipe! The cake has a very moist and smooth and texture.  The flavour is very rich and creamy.  The first time I made this was for Christmas dinner dessert and everyone thought it was a very nice recipe.

I did change the crust though; I used a ginger snap crust instead.  Crushed gingersnap cookies with butter.  

I further modified this recipe by making it gluten free, using gluten free flour and gluten free ginger snap cookies, there is really nothing comparable to graham crackers in the gluten free cookie world so I improvised and it was still wonderful!  Ginger snaps gave it quite a nice ‘festive’ flavour.

This is a great basic cheesecake recipe. I usually buy a crust for convenience. I have tried variations to this recipe, like adding a layer of chocolate or caramel at the bottom- and it's always a hit.

Do not sample this cheesecake while it is still warm - it tastes heavily of custard.  I served it right from the fridge so the flavour and texture would be genuine.

Gorgeous, thick and delicious!  Serve with pureed raspberries for a wowzer dessert!

Very good cheesecake!  I altered it to fit into a low-carb diet, so I eliminated the crust, put parchment paper on the bottom of the springform pan, and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I ate it warm and cold, and it was great both ways!  I took others' advice of cooking it in a water bath to prevent cracking, this worked.  It tased king of like a custard to me, not REALLY cheesy.  Next time I might increase the vanilla to give it more flavor, and/or add one more brick of cream cheese.

CHEESECAKE ATTEMPT #1. Result: Pretty good for a first attempt! Would recommend inexperienced cheesecake makers to check out the tips on this site. Used water bath so no cracks! Next time will bake crust for 10mins as stated b/c didnt the first time and crust was a little underbaked.
Also cut down cream cheese to 2 pkgs and 2 eggs. Works just as well.

I found that sifting the flour into the batter helped it blend more evenly.  The second timeI doubled up on the vanilla, which resulted in a cake we preferred to the first attempt--if you like the vanilla flavour to be less subtle you may want to do the same.

A dense, rich cake that wasn't too sweet.  The crust recipe is particularly good!

This cheesecake turned out really good! Normally I don't make cheesecakes but my dad insisted on me baking one since I have been starting to bake a lot more that usual! The amount of cream cheese was perfect, and I put 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of two to fit my moms diet and it turned out pretty good. I also had to put in one less egg because I was making cookies right after but it turned out great! My dad was practically looking over my shoulder the whole time and he was a little iffy about the one less egg, but when he tasted it... He loved it! (well he better have loved it because I made it just for him)

This cheesecake recipe turned out REALLY well! I gave some to family and friends and they were highly pleased with the results. My sister never liked cheesecake until she tasted the one I made. Its extremely simple to make and a definite crowd pleaser. The only change I made was to add a little more sugar than the recipe calls for.

Delicious.  Topped with the fruit glaze from Betty Crocker, pg. 183. Frozen tart cherries make a great topping for the glaze.  Also, start with room temperature cream cheese, sour cream, whipped cream and eggs and follow mixing directions.  Do not mix hard as will form bubbles. Grease sides of pan. Bake in hot water bath.....double wrap pan in foil, place pan in larger pan (I used the lasagna pan--good size) and pour boiling water into larger pan a couple inches up the side.  Baked at 310 for about 75 minutes.  Cooled in oven with door ajar for about 45 minutes- - then cool on a rack with inverted pie pan offset on top.  Then place in frig to cool for at least 6 hours or overnight before removing springform to serve.

Well Ladies and Gents, I made this recipe a few hours ago and I did a couple things to test a few ideas. I made my cheesecake with a ginger snap cookie crust, I increased the amount of filling made to test two different cooking methods. I used the turkey bag and water bath for my 10 inch and foil around the pan and no bath for the 8 inch. The 8 did experience cracking but the 10 didn't. I cooked both in a regular gas oven racks adjusted accordingly at 300 degrees, I also let the 10 cook for 90 min and the 8 for 60 min. Both cooled in the oven for 1 hour heat off door open. I will now put in the freezer for a couple hours for remainder of cooling time. I'm sure the flavor is superb, but the methods for cooking have given good insight. Thanks to all for your tips and comments. Happy Cooking!

Awesome!  So easy to make, my family loved it for Christmas dessert.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and baked it in a water bath, cooled it in  the oven, and it did not crack.  This will now be the only cheese cake I will bake!!

Very good.  I followed the modifications some people suggested in the comments such as cooking temperature and cooking it in a water bath.  It turned out perfect.  It was a huge hit with everyone.  I also added some snickers bar pieces on top of the crust below the cheese cake batter.

Turned out perfectly! It did puff up a lot, but sank back down when it cooled (I wonder if this is because I let the mixer go too long). I had one minimal crack. Delicious taste and texture. Love the crust too.

My co-workers agreed this was the best cheesecake they'd ever had in their lives!  I used all graham crackers (no nuts in the house - haha!) and used the full Tablespoon of cinnamon in the crust, and people commented on how much they liked the cinnamon.  I did not use a water bath, but instead tried reviewer Natalie's method (9/12/05) of simply placing the cheesecake on a sturdy cookie sheet.  I baked it @ 325 (my oven runs hot) for 50 minutes, turned oven off (not opening oven door), and let it sit in the closed oven for about 20 minutes more. Then I  let the cake cool for a couple hours or so in the oven with door ajar.  I was happy to see NO CRACKS!  Yay! Decorated the top with creme chantilly (sweetened whipped cream) and fresh blueberries with melted wild blueberry preserves drizzled atop. Very beautiful and delicious!

my son had a craving for cheesecake & this recipe definately fit the bill. i only made slight changes like using 1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs with an extra tablespoon butter for more crust, using half & half instead of heavy cream & baking the cheesecake with a waterbath. i also watched the informative allrecipes video on cheesecake making before hand & learned a few things! many thanks ronald!

Excellent recipe.  Creamy texture, great taste!  Definitely cook in water bath you will not be disappointed.  I too used a graham cracker crust instead of a dusting.  But I think this cheescake would be great with either.

Very heavy, rich cheesecake. Family members said it was a "real cheesecake".  I didn't like the crust too much so will try a different one next time I make this recipe - but I will make it again!

Wish I could give it 4.5 stars. Taste-wise it is 5 but in spite of being pretty careful and following reviews ideas, it cracked badly. I also did not like the crust much. Next time I will omit nuts from the crust. But will make it again for the taste.

This cheesecake is wonderful!  I made it for a dinner party and got lots of requests for the recipe.  It is a little firmer than I prefer, so next time I'll cut the amount of flour.  It has a very good flavor and texture.

This was soooo good.  My first time making a cheesecake, and I will make this one over and over again.  My family loved it too.  Great taste and texture...so smooth.  Didn't like the crust, too strong of a taste...next time will use less cinnamon and no nutmeg.  Also..only one tiny crack.  Simply the BEST!!

I did not care for this recipe.  The top cracked badly and collapsed.  The cooking time was also too long, and left the cake looking and tasting burnt.

This is the first time I have attempted to make a cheesecake. It came out perfect! I brought it to my church and everyone loved it. After reading everyone's review concering how the cake crackes, I decided to follow the advice of "pamcakes" and the cake looked beautiful. I will definitely use this receipe again. I am considering making this cake for someone as a gift. Can anyone recommed how to transport the cake from my springform pan to a cardboard with doilly without ruining the cake?

I absolutely love cheesecake and this is a great recipe--The name is deceiving, it underplays how fantastic this cheesecake is, and the CRUST is the best I've ever had--almost better than the cheesecake itself!

This is perfect!!!  I used a regular stovetop pan though because I don't have a springform.  Tastes perfectly creamy & just the right amount of sweetness.  Baked it at 330 for 55 as suggested by another reviewer but still got cracks.  Didn't look as pretty but still as tasty.

We thought this was a really good cheesecake.  It's creamy, and rich, with a hint of tang from the sour cream.  I personally like my cheesecakes less sweet than this was, but the kids thought it was the best!  Mine did crack pretty badly,but, I know that pulling a cheesecake out of the oven right away will cause that, so I expected it.  We just covered it with raspberry sauce.  This one is definitely going in the recipe box.

A very easy recipe to follow and is a hit with my family. I used pecans instead of walnuts for the crust without nutmeg. The only problem that I have had is keeping it from cracking in the oven and I have followed the advice of others of letting it stay in the oven until the oven is cool. Wonder if water bath would help with this isue ? Other then that the flavor is wonderful and has been added to my recipe collection for futur use. :0)

This was the first homemade cheesecake that I ever made and it came out perfect the first time I made it!!!  Appearance was perfect and the texture was too!! I have to say that this was one of the best cheesecakes that I ever tasted!  I made this for the Superbowl and everyone loved it!!  There was only one small piece left.

Yummy!!! My daughter's made this for me for Mother's Day dinner and the only downside I can see is that I probably gained ten lbs since I ate about half of this by myself! They made the topping from Lemon Blueberry Cheesecake from this site. But if you make the topping don't process in blender and double it.

I couldn't find my true and trusted cheesecake recipe so went searching for another.  I came across this recipe and decided to try it.  With some slight changes I made this cheesecake and it was amazing!  My son who loves cheesecake (it was for his birthday) and has eaten many in his life said it was the best one he's ever tasted. And other members of the family who don't even like cheesecake, loved it.  I did not use any walnuts.  For the filling I used non-fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese.  I put a cherry topping on top and I made 1 1/2 times the crust (we love crust!).  I put the cheesecake in a waterbath and after it was done in the oven, I let it sit for about 45 minutes before opening the door.  There were no cracks in the cheesecake.  This cheesecake was unbelievably good.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I like the texture of this cheesecake better than another recipe I made at the same time. This one had a cheesecake feel in your mouth and not just a smooth and creamy texture.

Excellent flavor and a real hit. Used store bought Graham cracker lines pans which lead to cracking. Will use a straight pan next time.

I had never made a cheesecake before because I always thought it would turn out crumbly and grainy instead of smooth and creamy. This recipe turned out better than expected. However, I cooked it differently. First off I omitted the nutmeg in the crust and cut the cinnamon in half. I baked the crust in a greased spring form pan at 400 for 10 minutes. I added 2 chopped snickers bars (should have done 3) and a half cup of milk chocolate chips to the filling. I turned the oven up to 475 and baked for 20 minutes, after which I turned the oven down to 200 and baked for 90 minutes. I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in for another hour to cool and prevent cracks- it worked. I ran a thin knife around the edge to loosen the crust and let the cheesecake cool on the counter for another hour and then put it in the fridge. Running the knife along the edge helped before it cooled on the counter because it continued to pull away from the pan on its own. I refrigerated it overnight and cut it the next day. It came away from the pan perfectly and was a luscious, smooth, creamy consistency- not grainy or dry in any way. The flavor is rich and delicious. Will definitely be saving this recipe to make again. Hope these tips help.

I made the recipe as is and my family said it was the best chesecake recipe I have made (I unsuccessfully tried many) I plan on making it again this Christmas. Followed the suggestions of leaving in the oven to cool and I did not get cracks in the top. Also did the water bath too.

This recipe merits more than five stars!!  I prepared this cheesecake exactly as written, and it turned out to be the creamiest, tastiest basic cheescake I've ever made.  The crust is outstanding as well.  The only different thing I did when it came to the crust was to use toasted, finely-chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner last evening.  Thought I would mention too, that this cheesecake is so delicious, and the top baked up so beautifully...no cracks or blemishes...that I served it plain.  As is, this recipe is perfection; thank you so much for posting it.

my whole family loved it. they are devouring the cake as I write this. I did make the crust with a couple changes. For the crust I added 1 teaspoon of ginger and excluded the walnuts. I would make again.

The flavors of this cheesecake are delicious. The crust is heavenly and the cheesy part is just perfect. I made one and a half times the crust. This was my first time making cheesecake and from reading articles on this website and re-reading some reviews, I have identified two mistakes I made: 1. I tried to make this in my regular 9" pan. I used parchment paper so it would be easy to take out (and it was), but it turned out not to be deep enough for all of the batter. Beware if you also try to do this! 2. I did not bake it in a water bath. The top of my cheesecake was cracked - this didn't bother me much (after all, it was still delicious) but it definitely would have looked nicer without the cracks. I recommend reading these two articles if you are baking a cheesecake for the first time: http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Perfect-Cheesecakes/Detail.aspx and http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Baking-Cheesecake-Step-by-Step/Detail.aspx. Good luck and enjoy!

Absolutely delicious!  The best cheesecake I have ever made.  I would put it above Chantal's NY cheesecake.  I love the addition of the sour cream and especially the heavy cream.  Everyone loved it.

This is a cery good cheesecake recipe!  I did make some changes though. I used a traditional graham cracker crust instead of the spiced one. Keep an eye on the cooking time, as the one in the recipe was about 15 minutes long for my oven.  Also, I follwed PAMSCAKES suggestions and found it still cracked badly.  I just made some streusel topping, popped it under the broiler for 2-3 minutes and it looked great!  I served it with fresh strawberries and a blueberry sauce and it was the hit of the Labor Day picnic!

Super creamy texture and very rich.  I made a few adjustments.I used store bought sugar cookies for the crust because my daughter doesn't like graham cracker crust.  I also added about 1/4 cup more sugar and half again as much vanilla as the recipe called for, but that's just because I like a pronounced vanilla flavor and a sweet cheesecake and I wanted to offset the tartness of the sour cream. I you like your cheesecake mildly sweet then I wouldn't add the extra sugar.  The whole family loved this one.  I will definately make it again.

This cheesecake was the hit of the evening!  Once it was placed on the table, it lasted no more than 10 minutes before it had been devoured!  Leave off any toppings...the cake is perfect as is.  :o)

Excellent cheesecake! And to think, it was the first time I had ever cooked ANYTHING! I now have people thinking I'm the next Betty Crocker! Thanks! - cheesecake was extremely good, the only problem is that after letting it cool off a while in the oven as suggested it still cracked.

Excellent cheesecake, although I haven't been successful at making it without a crack.  I've tried lowering the temperature in the last 15 to 20 minutes and it helped but didn't fix the problem.  

Great with Brandied Cranberry topping.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake in a springform pan.  Usually, I just make a cheesecake "pie" in a pie pan.  This was yummy!  I followed the tips but it still cracked.  I'll keep trying, and maybe I'll get one that doesn't crack someday.  Either way, it was delicious!

I've tried to make this cake twice, and both times it collapsed. It tasted good, though, and I'll be keeping the recipe for the crust even if I am throwing away the recipe for the actual cake.

This recipe was really wonderful.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he seemed to enjoy it very much!  Mine cracked a bit, too, like I see other people's version did, but it didn't make a bit of difference to the taste.  If I were to change anything, I think I'd cut down on the number of eggs used because you can almost taste them, which I think clashes a bit with the sweet idea of a cheesecake.  The crust is great and there's just a hint of flavor in the cheesecake -- 5 stars!

This recipe was okay.  I think I may have undercooked just a little.  The center was slightly set, but did not stiffen enough overnight.  I was worried about cracking, so I took it out early, but still had one large crack in the center by morning. Not much flavor, maybe needs more villina or sugar.  Crust was good, but too much nutmeg for my taste, would cut in half next time.

I have tried numerous cheesecake recipes that never seem to come out perfectly. This one is as near to perfection as I've found. (At our family gathering, my niece actually said it was better than her mom's! ouch)Smooth, creamy, not too heavy, not too sweet. I'll definitely make it again and again.

This cheesecake was excellent; the first one that I had made with sour cream as one of the ingredients.  The crust was excellent, too. I omitted the walnuts and added extra graham cracker crumbs.  I baked mine in a 9 1/2 inch springform pan for 55 minutes and it turned out perfectly, and, best of all, this recipe produced a cake that didn't crack when set.  YAY!  My husband had never had a "real" cheesecake, and he said this one was one of the best things--dessert or otherwise--he had ever eaten!! Great recipe!! Thanks! :o)

makes the most delicious cheesecake I have ever eaten.  I sometimes add french vanilla flavoring for a special kick to the cheesecake.  I do not use the spices in the crust.  I feel it takes away from the cheesecake flavor.

I made it today and it turned out quite bitter.
I live in Iran and I think perhaps our vanilla is too strong. perhaps eliminating the vanilla all together is better.

Very tasty recipe and isn't very difficult to make.  The information at the top of the page says that it's ready in 1 hr 40 minutes. I feel like that is "false advertising" to a certain degree, as the cheesecake needs to cool at least 6 hours (not that we waited that long!)

Yum yum yum. I love this recipe. My husband is not a fan of cheesecake but he raves about how good this one turns out! It's fluffy and so delicious. I cover it with a blueberry sauce that I make from scratch and it's out of this world! Best. Cheesecake. EVER.

I've used many cheesecake recipes over the years, but this is now my standard go-to recipe - and everyone who has eaten my cheesecakes absolutely loves it, too! I mix it up with toppings and add-ins - last year at Thanksgiving I used an Oreo crust  and stirred in mini chocolate chips. It was the first dessert to go!

I've made this using ginger snaps instead of graham crackers and it was phenomenal! I've made mini cupcake size ones as well, just using a whole ginger snap as the crust. It bakes for about 15mins. Delicious! They were the thank you favors for my baby shower last year. (:

I made this as a birthday cake. One huge crack in the middle.  Wasted my time and supplies. I followed this recipe completely letting it cool in oven. I should have used the recipe on the Philadelphia Cream Cheese package.

i added about 4 tblsp of fresh lemon juice and about 1 and 1/2 lemons worth of zest. i also added 1 additional tblsp of flour to make up for the extra juice. it gave it a really nice lemon zing! i plan to top it with blueberry compote with a tiny touch of fresh basil. it DID crack but im sure the flavor is spot on so oh well....

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made, but I bake often.  The flavor was spot on delicious!  I absolutely loved the crust which kind of reminded me of Christmas, but was still light enough for the summer.  I don't like walnuts so I used slivered almonds that I ground up in the food processor.  The cheesecake has a lighter flavor than what I'm used to, but that's what I like about it.  The only problem that I had was the HUGE split down the middle and it bubbled up and hardened around the edge of the pan.  Also the cream cheese mixture darkened and hardened around the edges.  I'm guessing this is because I mixed it too long...that's the only thing I can think of.  Also, I pulled it out of the oven after 45 minutes.  My oven usually cooks fast, but not that fast.  I think the splitting and rising are my fault so I still give this 4 stars and will definitely keep using this recipe.

The recipe worked out spectacularly! Since I just wanted to try out if I could do the recipe properly, I had the servings set to 6 servings. Also, instead of using vanilla extract, I used almond extract. Since almond extract is a tad strong, I only used  1/4 tsp. I also upped the sugar a bit. Otherwise, this recipe is the perfect base to work with and then add your own little touches to it! Thank you for posting it!

Great basic cheesecake recipe. The crust was really tasty. The only problem I had was my cheesecake puffed up a lot and then sank and the top got over-browned, it still tasted good!

Absolutely delicious.  I lowered the temp to 335, had a water bath and left it in the oven till it cooled w/the door slightly ajar- yet it STILL had massive cracks.  Any suggestions?  I also used lemom extract instead of vanilla for an added taste.

Wonderful! My first try at cheesecake, and a great success. I followed suggestions to let cool in oven and no cracks. It did puff significantly at the end of baking (but went down while cooling) and turned a little darker brown than I wanted (maybe it baked too long?), so a friend suggested mixing a little sour cream and sugar and spread on top. It was beautiful!

This is the easiest and best basic cheesecake I've ever made.  I took the other hints and left it in the oven a couple of hours after I turned it off so it wouldn't crack.  I got rave reviews on it and will definitely keep this one at the front of my recipe box.

I've never had this turn out bad. Just a great basic cheesecake..just as the title suggests. Just don't overmix and I always turn off the oven and let the oven door stay wide open after baking time so hopefully no cracking will occur and 99.9999% of the time it doesn't.

This cheesecake would be the love of my life if I hadn't met my husband!  It is so easy, and the perfect consistency-  firm, as a cheesecake should be!  Do NOT, I repeat, do not skip the crust and use a store-bought one.  The crust is half the reason this cheesecake is so heavenly!  The hot water bath is good if you're trying to impress someone, but it still tastes just as good if it is cracked, so it is a skippable step.  If you're looking to make it lower in fat, use fat free everything except use the Neufachatel cheese, found in the cream cheese section.  It still turns out firm with the same flavor, but slightly lighter.  I usually like the lower fat texture a little better.  The lower fat version is still firm, not mushy jello-pudding consistency.

This is one of the most delicious cheesecakes that I have ever made. I made it for a family "get-together" and everyone enjoyed it. I recommend it to any cheesecake lover.

This is a really lovely cheesecake! I made a couple changes though. Instead of sour cream I used plain greek yogurt, to which I added a bit more than was called for, and a little less cream. The only thing I didn't like was that it tasted ever so slighty "eggy". I think I'll only use two eggs next time.

This cheesecake is absolutely heavenly!  The only thing that I changed was I removed the walnuts and reduced the amount of nutmeg in the crust.  I took this to work and all of my co-workers asked for the recipe.  Thank you so much for putting this out!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made. The texture was perfect- very dense, not mushy. I added almond extract instead of vanilla, gave it a slight amaretto taste. I followed PAMSCAKES tips for not cracking and it worked!  The cake looked as good as it tasted. Also, I used a plain graham cracker crust, just sounded better than all those spices.

Thank you for a great recipe.  I baked it in a heart shaped springform pan, used a water bath and left it in the oven for several hours after baking, but it still had a large crack. I think next time I will turn the heat down to 325 and see if that makes a difference.  
I don't mind a crack or two, but if someone is looking for a "perfect presentation", it might be better to try another recipe. 
I made this last night as a surprise for my husband. Cheesecake is his favorite dessert. He prefers a dense, heavy cheesecake and pronounced this one "perfect". I opted to make a plain graham cracker crust. (the crust recipe did not sound like something my hubby would care for.)

This was only my second attempt at ever making a cheesecake, but the first time following this recipe.  It turned out really good!  It did crack, even though I tried to follow the advice of other reviewers, but it wasn't visible once I put a topping over it.  It was even still very rich even though I substituted 2 of 3 packages of real cream cheese with the fat free ones.  I also substituted an oreo crust for the graham cracker crust and it was really tasty.

Basic Cheesecake- definately basic and absolutely perfect. I made this cheesecake for a baby shower, it was easily the star of the afternoon! I was not attentive enough when I was cooking it - I let it go too long. The taste was still wonderful just cracked and crumbly. I think I will take Alton Brown's advice and use a water bath next time. I borrowed a springform pan- this cake has inspired me to buy my own pan. Thank you!!

Wow!!! This recipe is awesome.  I have tried several recipes looking for one I like to use in the cookbook I'm publishing... I did make a few changes, such as adding more vanilla and using pumpkin pie spice and pecans in the crust, but those are just personal preferences.  I made this cheesecake the day that a reporter from my local newspaper came to my house to interview me for an article, and she flipped.  I also made it for some friends who came over for a small dinner party.  I had to open the dishwasher and show them the dirty dishes to prove that it wasn't stre bought!!!  Thanks A Lot :)

I baked this recipe with my husband and daughter and they loved it! We didn't have a speingform pan and a mixer so we ended up making 3 9"inch pans which were thin but still very delicious... We'll be baking this again and again.

This cheesecake received rave reviews when I made it.  One suggestion would be to cover the cheesecake during the final 1/2 hour of baking to prevent browning.

Delicious.

This was the first cheesecake that I ever made & it turned out pretty ggod. The only reason I say that is because baking the crust the first 10 min, and then again with the cake, it came out very hard & burnt tasting. I think next time I will not bake it for the initial period, just with the cake. But the overall cheese portion was fabulous! Very dense and creamy.

My first "real" good cheesecake. Beats Jello by far :-)
I have a family of 5 impatient testers. It didn't cool all the way before it disappeared, I give in easy. We are all stuffed. My wife says I should go to the store and get started on another so it'll be cool for tomarrow. I'm considering a water bath and starting with room temp ingredients. Not for taste or texture but I want a perfect looking cake.

EXCELLENT!  Everyone thought it was store bought!  Texture and taste was amazing, cracked a little but easily hidden with fruit pie filling topping.  Crust was awesome even though I left out the nuts.

Excellent!!  A few modifications being new to cooking and baking especially. I used a pre- made graham crust brushed with butter. The filling was enough for two. One for a dinner party and one for my hubby to take to work for a potluck

I took this cheesecake to a party as a last minute request for my pregnant friend and it received rave reviews. The whole pie was gobbled up within minutes so I’m glad this yielded so much batter, because the next day I used the same mixture (stored in fridge overnight) to make cheesecake cups AND A CHEESECAKE SKILLET which ALSO got rave reviews all around. I was using a large pie crust, not springform pan; that’s why I had so much extra mixture. Will absolutely keep this in my rotation for plain cheesecakes from now on. But I have to agree with other reviewers about the temperature and timing; my large cake cracked severely. No one cared how it looked though because it tasted so amazing. Be careful not to over beat with electric mixture as that could add to cracking as well!

I am always trying new cheesecake recipes - my favorite dessert. I tried this recipe today as my husband requested cheesecake "to start the New Year". I  almost didn't try it because of the title... "Basic Cheesecake".  This cheesecake is anything but basic!  and I mean that in a good way!  I was attracted by the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand, that it required only 3 blocks of cream cheese, one of the ingredients was whipping cream (which I have found to be a critical ingredient in a really good cheesecake) AND I was also drawn by the ground walnuts in the crust.  (I love nuts!) This was a fantastic cheesecake!  The ground walnuts in the crust made the best crust I have ever had in a plain cheesecake and the filling was superb.  The only changes I made were regular sugar in the crust and no spices as well as adding a teaspoon of rum extract  in addition to the vanilla. A keeper I look forward to making again and again!

Made for our Christmas Eve Family Lunch. My son said it’s the best of any I’ve made. I didn’t add in the cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust mixture...just not a fan of the flavors. Will definitely make again.

Perfect cheesecake. Smooth and delicious.   I made a crust of pecan sandy cookies and vanilla wafers. Just a mood I was in. I took the hints to heart about cooking it a little less time. I did 10 minutes less. I opened the oven and let it cool about 30 minutes and ran a sharp knife around the edge to release it from the sides of the pan. Then I put it back in, to cook an cool for another hour.  Then I let it cool on the counter until completely cool. Absolutely no cracks. The knife around the edge did the trick.  My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Not too sweet and the flavor is very good. Very easy to dress up too.

This recipe turns out a stellar cheesecake. It’s absolutely wonderful, my friends have asked me to make it several times. Make sure to bake it at 330 degrees and leave it in the oven with no peeking for a good two hours. If you don’t it will not look very appetizing. Also mix it thoroughly, slowly.  I still get cracks in the surface now and then.

This was delicious. So rich, creamy and decadent! The crust was really good. The spices were a nice touch, gave it a good flavor. I followed advice of others and cooked it in a water bath at 300 for 50 minutes then shut the oven off and left the cheesecake in there for another hour. Perfect, no cracks! Next time I’ll probably make a fruit sauce (I’m thinking raspberry) to go with it!

Great cheesecake! I did follow one of the users reviews and it came out perfect! No cracks. 
I cooked it at 340 and only cooked it for 30 min. Left it in the oven for another 2 hours and don't open the door.

Fabulous. I left the walnuts out of the crust because I didn't have any - otherwise followed the recipe exactly.
I made them for a baby shower so I did them in mini muffin tins - just bite size. So I did the crust for 5 minutes at 325, and the whole thing for about 10 minutes at 325. Topped them with Chef John's raspberry sauce from this site. Big hit. And it made a TON

Simple and delicious! Very thick and creamy. A fruit topping would be perfect since it is plain. I can't stop eating it!! The crust is tasty and gives it a good texture. I will make it again.

First time trying out this recipe and it turned out great. The walnuts were a nice addition to it, and would consider using black walnuts next time to add more sourness to it.

Made this for Christmas dinner and had several recipe requests. Awesome and easy. I did make a couple changes. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added butter extract.

I used a regular store bought pie crust. You can make 3 cheesecakes using this recipe! I make it exactly as stated but I do double the vanilla because I like vanilla. Sometimes I cut recipe in half.

Delicious!  I made my first cheesecake using this recipe.  Very creamy and so light.  My mistake was removing it from the oven before it cooled.  Split!   I am making another today.  Keeping it in the oven until it cools is going to hopefully eliminate the splitting.

I made it! I read the reviews about this amazing cheese cake and took the advise of lowering the temp to avoid cracking! I set the oven to 300 for 80 min, let it cool in the oven and it cracked! Guess it didn't work for me, but looking forward to the taste! Just hoping it's firm enough! Next time I'll try it again!

I have make this cheesecake numerous times.  As this is a BASIC recipe I have varied the flavorings and crust to my liking.  I'm not a fan of water baths (don't know why) so I took  into account everyone's suggestions  and do the following:. 
1. Don't  overmix the  batter. If you use a mixer, combine all ingredients on low with the exception of creaming the cream cheese and sugar.  To help incorporate the eggs easier, I lightly whisk in a bowl prior to adding. 
2.  Lightly grease the pan.  I use a 9" springform. 
3.  Bake 330 for 50 min (depending on your oven) outer edges will look dry and slightly risen, center will look underdone and jiggly. 
4.  Turn off oven, prop oven door and leave cheesecake inside for 2 hours or more. 
5.  Cool completely before putting into fridge. 
Beautiful uncracked perfection!

Easy is right! This will be my go-to cheesecake recipe from now on. I tweaked this recipe and made it with crushed gingersnaps for the crust.  I also used homemade applesauce  on the top and swirled it into the cheesecake  prior to baking. Lots of compliments from co-workers.

I have made this cheesecake recipe many times now. It has no equal amongst store bought cakes. This is how a real (normal baking ingredients without the yuck) cheesecake should look, taste and present. Sometimes mine crack, sometimes they don't...doesn't really matter to the consumer. It is dense, rich and flavorful by itself...add a topping to enhance. Best basic cheesecake recipe I have found!

I added pureed mango and it was delicious!  Used an oreo crust and added slivered almonds as a topping, even made a mango flavored whipped cream to go with it!  Very yummy.

I made this last night and let it refrigerate over night.  Some tips I took to make this.  I used a water bath and baked at 300 degrees for 80 minutes, cut the oven off and left the door ajar to cool down.  No cracks anywhere.  A perfect looking cheesecake.  I omitted the spices in the crust as I didn't want anything to detract from the flavor of the cake itself.  I tried this recipe as a replacement of my old recipe and this one takes the cake so to speak.  My wife, the connoisseur of cheesecakes, loves this recipe.  Will definitely make this again.

Yum! This is so good. Instead of the suggested cookies base, I used leftover choc brownies as the base. A simple but delicious cheesecake.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever had! I used to make one very similar to this, but lost the recipe years ago. My family loves cheesecake and had recently begun asking for that cheesecake again. I just served this one for a Christmas dessert and it was a huge hit! They agreed it was even better than my old recipe!  The crust was especially delicious. Great flavor all the way through, I don't even think it needs a topping. Read other comments for tips on cooling after baking to prevent cracking, they were extremely helpful. Will make again for sure!

The cheesecake is delicious!!!!! Only reason for 3 stars is that the cheesecake takes more like 3 hrs cooking and overnight in the fridge. I wouldn't have known that if I didn't read others comments and suggestions. So this is not a day of kind of dessert... Prepare in advance!

Turned out really good and will make again! Only changes I made was I cooked it in a water bath for the time listed so it wouldn't crack on top. 

Best tip: Instead of adding one egg at a time like the instructions say, try this - Seperate your eggs and just add the yellow yolks first and mix in just until incorporated with the batter. In the other bowl that just has the egg whites take your mixer and beat them until they are white stiff peaks.  Then add the egg whites to the batter and mix only until they are incorporated into the batter.  The key being not to over mix it.  The cheesecake will be given a lighter-fluffier texture doing this.

The only change I made was buying graham crackers and crunching them up rather than buying crumbs (because now I have cheesecake AND a box of graham crackers!). It turned out amazing and was well worth the wait.

Not a fan of this recipe - I won't make it again. While baking it raised about an inch above the edge of my pan. I ended up baking it a bit longer because the entire thing was still jiggly. The top was too dark for my taste (even at the end of specified baking time). I don't use a water bath and typically don't have a problem with cracking. This cracked terribly and as soon as I took it out the center fell leaving a giant ridge around the edge. I followed the recipe to the letter although none of the other cheesecakes I've made bake at this high a temperature (which concerned me). I actually liked the spice in the crust and the cheesecake itself had decent flavor, though by far not as good as others I've made. I made it for Easter dinner dessert (covering the cracks with fruit topping) and had good reviews from family. I guess that's what I get for forgetting my list when I went shopping and trying to find a recipe on my phone at the last minute while in the middle of Wal-mart!

I love love love this cheesecake!  Substituted the spur cream for 1 cup plain yogurt. It was delicious!  My cheesecake did crack. I think next time I will bake it at a lower temp for longer as others have suggested....but the flavor was still spot on!

Very good cheesecake. Followed recipe except that I omitted nuts from the crust. I also at the suggestion of others left the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about two hours to avoid cracks. It worked well, no cracks but the top was a little well done. I wanted to serve a plain cheesecake and offer my guests different topping but it was just too brown so I used a can of strawberry filling on top. Looked very nice and tasted very good. I would definitely make again just need to figure out how  to get it not to brown so much on top.

I absolutely love this cheesecake recipe. I make a few small changes; I increase the crust by half because in love a thick crust, adjusting all other crust ingredients accordingly. I leave out the walnuts. For the cheesecake filling, my on,y addition is switching out 1/4 cup of the white sugar for light brown sugar. It's delicious! I use a water bath and bake at 310, rotating once, eyeballing for doneness (about an hour). I get compliments on it everywhere I take one.

Just as the name implies, its your basic cheesecake. Not as heavy as what Ive made in the past which was nice but also not as rich. It satisfied my craving and will be nice with additional toppings.

I used another crust for this - but my family and our company thought this was truly the best cheesecake they had ever experienced on the planet. Prepared it virtually exactly as described and it came out w/o cracks, looking flawless.  Water bath and sitting in oven for two hours is crucial. Let it sit overnight in frig. Taste is rich w/o being heavy. It may not be low-calorie - but it is a real treat. I fixed two easy sauces: raspberry and strawberry. But it was best all by itself.  The Cheesecake Factory has nothing on this recipe!

This was first attempt at making a cheesecake. It was delicious! Even my father, who doesn't usually like cheesecake, thought it tasted great. I did get a large crack in it, though, while cooling it in the oven. I used a different graham cracker crust recipe because I didn't want the nuts and spices in it. I will definitely make this again.

This is such a great basic recipe to begin so many different cheesecakes.  I've used pistachio, chili powder, ginger for crust, raspberry extract, and a raspberry, blackberry, blueberry mix stirred into mix prior to baking.  I also substitute a tub of marscapone for one of the cream cheese and I use Neufchâtel instead of cream cheese.  It turns out so good.  Sometimes I add pistaschio curd for a topping.  Just depends who I'm baking it for.  Key lime, raspberry, lemon, blueberry, cherry.... The variations are endless with this perfect basic starter.  I also use a water bath, allow it to rest in oven for two hours after baking 60-80 minutes at 340 degrees, cool on counter and chill at least overnight.  Baking time depends on how many ingredients are in the cake. Some add on's make for a longer baking time due to moisture content.  I'm thinking of using that hot raspberry jelly on my next one. With chili powder in the crust.  Pop!!!

The filling of the recipe is the best ever.  Creamy and still plenty of cream cheese flavor!  It's my new favorite!  I used two large store bought graham cracker crusts for the one batch of filling.  Perfect.  335 degree oven for about 45 minutes.  Cooled in oven and then fridge.  Yummmmmmmy!

I loved this recipe and received many compliments for the taste.  I did follow a simple graham cracker crust since I did not want the nuts or spices in it.  It did crack but it was easily covered with a cherry topping.  I will definitely use the recipe again.

I did it exactly as the recipe said and it had no flavor. It didn't tasted bad but it wasn't good either. the temperature was too high to cook it for so long so the top came out all black and I had to scratch it out.

I served this for Thanksgiving along with my pies.  I followed all of the tips but it still had 3 HUGE cracks in it.  I put a can of cherry pie filling on top and it was gorgeous and everyone loved it.  Very creamy and the crust was fantastic.

I also followed the cooling methods of other reviewers.
Keeping it the fridge over night was a great idea!

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made and it turned out beautifully! I took it to a friend's house for our dinner date and everyone loved it.  Even our friend gave it five stars (after I told them how I chose the recipe based on it's ratings here).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Ecellent Cheesecake and very simple to make. This recipe isn't too sweet like some recipes. I followed the baking suggestions and baked this cake around 340 for about 60 minutes then left in the oven to finish baking.

I will make this cheesecake again.

I bought 2 10" graham cracker crusts & a bag of chocolate chips. I mixed the filling exactly as it said but divided up the chocolate chips between each crust before adding the filling. This was a hit!

This cheesecake was really easy to put together. It was my first time making a cheesecake. My crust seemed kinda burnt though. Also I had very little cracking and I did not use a water bath. So rich and good. I will try to make this again.

Fantastic! I made this for our Christmas party and it was very popular. I doubled the crust mixture but skipped the walnuts. I also added strawberry glaze for a topping. It is easy to mix up, bakes up very thick and has a nice presentation when topped with a fruit mizture. I had no problems getting this to set up. I did leave it in the oven after it was done baking and there were a couple of small cracks but they covered up nicely with the fruit.

I made this for Thanksgiving at the request of my boyfriend.  He said it did not taste "cheesecake" enough, but was good w/ the cherry topping.  I am not a lover of cheesecake, but will try Chantel's NY Cheesecake next time.

This was exactly what I was looking for, I stirred in about 3/4 of a bag of the Andes candy pieces, and garnished it with the Easy Whipped Cream recipe from this site and the rest of the mints. Delicious!

loved it. nice dense texture and not overly sweet. perfect amount of crust. love the cinnamon in the crust; i left out the nutmeg. i used the advice of leaving the cheesecake in the oven to prevent cracking, but it still cracked some. however, i don't care at all about that. it was a nice golden brown on top, it looked great that way.

This just didn't workout for me.  It cracked horribly, burnt on the top, and the crust was good, but not great.  I probally did something wrong, but I'm not sure I'll be making this again.  The cheesecake itself however tasted very good.  Had a bit of a bite to it, due to the sour cream I guess.

I love this recipe! This was my first ever baked cheesecake! I followed pamscakes suggestions for not cracking and I didn't get a single crack! I scaled the recipe to serve 10, and made it in an 8" pan. Everybody loved it - I will definitely make this every time! Thanks!

I thought this cheesecake was very good, except it had too many cracks, was not very appealing, but it taste great...  I also used a ready bought pie crust, was great.

This cheesecake was very good. I added more sugar though. I wish I had read pamscakes review before I made this cake because it cracked so much, but overall it was delicious and easy to make.

This is the best cheesecake recipe ever invented.  THIS is real NY cheesecake, not that fluffy stuff.

Very Good recipe for cheesecake, but the crust was too strongly flavored for my taste. Will make again with my own crust. Also cooking time was too long, overly browned.

When using a pie dish this makes enough for two, so be ready with an extra baked crust. My husband loves cheesecake and usually eats the whole in a sitting. I thought this was pretty good, but it has been two days and he has only eaten two slices???? The cheesecake or my cooking - it could go either way...

I have never made cheesecake before and for my first attempt this was wonderful.  It did crack on top.  Not very pretty, oh but it was wonderful.  I added raspberries and whip cream to the top.  WONDERFUL!!!! a BIG hit with family and friends.  Thank you for sharing your treat Ronald.

I only baked it for 20min.  Maybe my oven is hotter than most.  I topped it with a blueberry drizzle and it was bangin'!  Scrumdidlyumptious!

Yay!  First cheesecake I have ever baked that worked.  It got rave reviews too.  There is a fine line between being done and overdoing where it cracks, but it still tastes fabulous!

This was my first attempt at making a homemade cheesecake.  The recipe was easy to follow and it tasted delicious!
