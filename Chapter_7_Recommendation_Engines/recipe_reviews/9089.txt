I have made something similar to this at Christmas for many years.  I start with a softened 8oz. cream cheese and mix it well with the condensed milk.  Then add a can of pineapple and the cherry pie filling and cool whip.  It is always a hit!  Very sweet, but wonderful with ham or ham balls.

I also add pineapple and walnuts, do not even consider leaving out the sweetened condensed milk as this will leave you with a sloppy mess.  The SC milk is what thickens it.  It will last days in the fridge without becoming runny.  It takes just minutes to make and items can be kept on hand for an easy dish to bring to any event.

This is good as is or as a good base for some additions.  It is wonderful with pecans or walnuts and some pineapple chucks (well drained or it gets runny).  I would recommend keeping it in the fridge for a couple of hours before servng to give it time to set up - it is much better cold....

Like others, I used this as a "starter" recipe and added the works -- pineapple, marshmellows, cream cheese and nuts. It turned out to be very pretty but not very flavorful. In the future I will cut out the condensed milk and add some cherry Jello to the mix.

I wasn't a big fan of this (wayy too sweet) but my daughter & her family was. I used dark sweet cherry pie filling & I only used 2/3 of a can of sweetened condensed milk (I used fat free). But I think 1/2 a can would have been plenty sweet. I garnished w/ a bit of sliced almonds. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making dump salad for more than 30 years.  I add to this l large can crushed pineapple although you can use pineapple tidbits, 1.5 cups flaked coconut, 1.5 cups pecans and sometimes 2 cups of miniature marshmallows.  Our family love dump salad during the holidays/other times also.  Can also sub the cherry pie filling with strawberry pie filling.

I loved this added chopped pecans and marshmallows. Used light cherry pie filling - it was a big hit on Thanksgiving - going to make it for Easter - perfect color and super yummy.

I absolutely love this salad. :)  It was simple to make and the only change I made was I added mini marshmallows.  I thought the presentation was pleasing and the taste delightful.

This was too sweet.  Like other, I added pecans and pineapple tidbits to try to cut some of the sweetness.  Even used reduced sugar cherry pie filling.  It was very good though.

Very simple and yummy! You can put it together in a snap. The only thing is that I'd halve the condensed milk next time, because it was almost too sweet.

This recipe was very good except I added marshmallows to it.  I would have added pineapples too, but my husband doesn't like them.  Next time I will try that though.

I was looking for something easy and festive. It was a runny mess, it couldn't not be dished on a plate with any other food. There did not seem to be enough substance even with the added pineapple. I would suggest freezing it.

I just made this salad earlier today, as is.  The overwhelming flavor that comes through is the sweetened condensed milk.  I love cherries and the flavor is overpowered by the milk.  Next time I will do as others suggested, and add cream cheese.  I may add maraschino cherries as well.  This recipes is so simple but needs adjustments for my taste.

I thought this was great!!! That being said, I would omit the condensed sweetened milk (uneccesary calories in my opinion) and maybe just add a couple drops of the liquid sweetner if you like things real sweet. I also think I would do two cans of pie filling and then the coolwhip! Great recipe thanks!

This has become a Thanksgiving staple with my family.  We add a small can of mandarin oranges and a can of crushed pineapple (both drained).  It is quite sweet, but that is what makes it yummy.

I wanted to like this but as the recipe is written, I don't see how anyone could serve this. Way too sweet. I could see using this as a pie filling (use a Graham cracker crust). I ended up adding heavy cream, skim milk and cinnamon to turn it into a chilled cherry soup.
