8.5.16   Followed the recipe instructions, but I really don't understand why the corn was first boiled and then put on the grill to brown?  Why not just completely grill the corn, getting more of the grilled flavor, and save yourself a dirty pot to wash later?  Lots of fresh flavors here, and that little pop of balsamic really brightens the salad.  I didn't miss the oil that you often find in grilled corn salads.  This has very good eye appeal and was a tasty side kick to grilled pork chops.

I had to substitute because it was so last minute.  I forgot to add the cheese, used canned corn instead of fresh, added green peppers b/c i didn't have orange peppers and added cilantro. Family loved it.  Will definitely be making it again with correct ingredients and adding cilantro

I made this as written and didn't find it too exciting, unfortunately.

I made this recipe to try and eat more vegetables.  Also, it was my first taste of cilantro. It was fair. Probably, a vegetable lover would praise this. I will make this again to increase my liking of vegetables.

It was easy and really good with a package of roasted sweet corn.
