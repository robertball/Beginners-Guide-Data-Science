Easy to make and very tasty. I used the cayenne and like the taste but it might be too much for some. I am saving this one as it has an excellent flavor and doesn't take much time to put together.

I loved this recipe, so simple yet so elegant!  I added in some cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese!  Great to serve for company!
