AND I DON'T EVEN EAT MUSHROOMS!

August 20, 2003 from Melissa: I made these Marinated Mushrooms last weekend to take to a niece's college graduation party.  What a hit they were!  I don't care for mushrooms myself, but can always recognize a good recipe when I see one!  

I had at least 8 people make a point of coming up to me to tell me EMPHATICALLY how much they loved the mushrooms.  They would say something like "I love those mushrooms you made" and I'd say "Oh, thanks, glad you like 'em." and they'd say something like "I mean I REALLY like 'em."  It's not that often that people go out of their way to comment TWICE on the same dish!  I'll definitely be making this one a staple of my "party dishes"!

I added just a bit more brown sugar to this marinade because it had a bitter aftertaste. A dash of orange juice could give this marinde an added touch of sweetness.  I thought the presentation was wonderful, with the colors of the red and green pepper.  Next time, though I am going to cut the peppers into long shoestrings to make the jarred presentation more dramtic.  This is the perfect thing to take to a Holiday gathering. They look and smell very inviting.

These are absolutely addicting!  I keep these on hand for a light snack.  this is kindof of a go by taste on the red wine and sugar as some red wines can be a bit more bitter and strong than other kinds so I usually go by how the strong the wine is and then adjust the brown sugar accordingly.

This is the best marinated mushroom recipe I have found. I prepare the recipe and let it marinate overnight. It really brings out the wonderful flavors. Will make again and again!

My husband liked these a lot better than I did. I thought the vinegar taste was very strong. Might try again with white wine and white wine vinegar. The red seemed 'heavy' for mushrooms.

Why spend so much time on a side dish? Put simply, it's worth it. The details make the difference and preparing these mushrooms will make you look like a cooking star. I used the mixture as a garnish for grilled pork chops using the allrecipes rub called Simple Pork Rib Dry Rub. It's as if these mushrooms were made for the grilled chops with this rub. They both bring a lot of heat and the taste explosion is spectacular. Do it!

I love mushrooms and I did not care for these.  Way too much red wine and red wine vinegar.  I couldn't even taste the mushrooms because the sauce was so pungent.  However, on the bright side, per others' suggestion, I've got some filet marinating in it right now so hopefully it will be a better marinade than an appetizer!

Color of mushrooms and taste was good with the addition of the red wine.  But I found that the recipe called for too much red wine vinegar. Even after cooking and sitting in fridge for a day the flavor of vinegar was overwhelming.

I LOVE marinated mushrooms but I only kind of liked this recipe. The red wine was just an odd choice. It made the marinade pink which did not look appetizing. The original flavor was not good so I added more sugar like some people suggested and it kind of saved it, but I will not be making this again.

This dish was stunning! I served it warm & it was a hit! I did serve it though with red bell pepper strips instead of diced & used white onion instead of green onions.

Super easy.  I like a little extra red pepper strips.  I think they are best room temp or warm but they are good on a salad as well.

I made these a few days ahead of Christmas intending to serve them. When I tested them Christmas morning they were a kind of unusual taste so I didn't serve them. My husband and I ate them heated a few days later, they were okay, with a quite strong vinegar flavor. I liked the little bit of zesty heat but would probably not make again.

I served these chilled the day I made them and they were awful. I don't know what was wrong. The alcohol/vinegar taste was so strong we could barely choke them down and I didn't even use all that it called for. I was the only one willing to try them again a few days later and they were much better, but still not as good as I had hoped.

These were fantastic!  Boiling the mushrooms, then allowing them to cool in the pot gave them a nice texture.  However, I realized too late that I had completely forgotten the brown sugar--but it didn't matter!!  So, I recommend trying them without the sugar--they were really zesty!  Next time, I will use the sugar, but they were great anyway.
