I made these this Fall for a potluck dinner of my husband's co-workers, none of whom I knew. That made them good guinea pigs as they weren't biased one way or the other toward my cooking. The end results: an appealing-looking plate that was totally different from anything other folks brought, a perfect complement to the warm, savory, cheesy, meaty dishes on the table, and many, many compliments and requests for the recipe.  :^)
The only alterations I made were to further chop the purchased chopped walnuts so they would adhere better to the goat cheese, and to use Ken's Steak House Balsamic with Honey Salad Dressing. I put the dressing in a plastic squeeze bottle (the ones used for catsup, mustard, BBQ sauce), and drizzled it over the plate before serving.

Needed smaller cheese balls, would roll them in herbs then roasted walnuts, finely chopped next time.  Used home grown beets, most people lived them & they were pretty.

Simple and delicious. I used it at a dinner party and also took it to a potluck. Both times it was a hit. It is easy, but looks beautiful and is a fun way to serve a salad
