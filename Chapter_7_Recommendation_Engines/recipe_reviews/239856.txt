I made these exactly like the recipe except I made mini muffins (cook only 13 minutes and keep an eye on them not to overcook). Used one T sugar only. I used half extra sharp and half medium sharp cheddar. I could only find a 7oz plain yogurt so I just used that with a little milk added. I also added 3-5 dashes of tabasco to liven the batter up. Not too much, just to give a hint of it. They were for a club meeting brunch, but they tasted so good my husband wanted me to keep them for us and pick something else for the brunch at the store. I had 30 so I put them in the freezer. As of now, I have had heated them up for five more meals, and it's time to make some more. They freeze well and heat in 15 seconds...or less.

This is a great recipe if you are looking to make a sweet cheddar cheese muffin, which is exactly what I was looking for. These are NOT a savoury muffin. The only change I made  was I used half vanilla yogurt and half sour cream instead of plain yogurt because it was all I had. Delicious, thanks for a wonderful  recipe!

I liked the consistency of the muffins but I didn't find they had a cheesy taste at all. Next time I will add more cheese. They were fairly sweet but I didn't mind that.

Great base for a full on savoury muffin too! I only used 1T of sugar and went to town on additions! Made up the cheese quantity with cheddar, feta, mozzarella and parmesan, added onion, spinach, pepper, grated zucchini, red onion, cayenne pepper and nutmeg. Absolutely divine!!

I followed the advice from other commenters and backed off a bit from the sugar and upped the cheese amount. The result was outstanding! My family devoured them. My stepdaughter ate two, even though she initially was going to skip dinner because she wasn't hungry. Definitely on my remake list.

these were so good! i scaled this down to three servings and it made 4 good size biscuits and one smallish one.. i reduced the sugar down to 1.5.. also added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese.. subbed canola oil for the butter.. added 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/8 tsp of cayenne.. bf said only thing he could think of adding would be the butter.. i thought maybe a little more salt.. either way these are near perfect.. ty for the recipe

BIG mistake, the amount of sugar. Overides all the other flavors, even the hefty amount of grain mustard I put in a batch.
Otherwise very fluffy consistency.

These muffins turned out just like the picture!  I mostly followed the recipe and it was moist and cheesy.  The only change I made was I increased the cheese to 3  cups since I was trying to use up all my shredded cheese with this recipe.   It seemed a little too sweet for me, so I'll probably cut back on the sugar next time.  This is one I will make for special breakfasts and  to have as a snack every once in awhile.  They won't last long, given how everyone in the household loves cheese!

I increased the cheese by half cup, reduced the sugar by half, added oregano and chopped tomatoes. Will definitely make again!

I added 1/2 cup more cheese plus a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. I also added some Rosemary, garlic, and onion powder. I added 1/2 cup more of yogurt and also a few tablespoons of vegetable oil.

Turned out awesome. :)

Made them today for lunch....sooo good and easy to make! I made some changes though, reduced the sugar,  used "paria" cheese, added bacon and a bit of grind pepper. Serving them warm made our minestrone just the perfect lunch for a cold winter day. Rico!!. Greetings from Lima-Perú.

a very consistent savory and yummy muffin! i've tried scaling it down to as low as just 1 serving and as high as the regular serving and it still turned out great. lovely for paring with soups and roast chicken or as an afternoon treat. will make it again and again. thanks...

A good muffin, really easy to make, with good texture and taste.  The cheese flavor was there, but not too strong, which worked for us.  I served this with beef vegetable stew, but I think they would go well with chili and other dishes as well.  The extras stored well in a Ziploc bag for 3 days and did not dry out, which is great so that they could be happily eaten over a few days time.

Easy method however could remove the sugar and definitely add more cheese and perhaps a large pinch of cayenne. Will definitely keep on my favourite list but with the changes.

Too much sugar. Makes it taste like cornmeal. Wish I would have read the reviews first but the recipe is rated so highly I went with the original recipe. I gave serious pause when filling a half cup of sugar but added it anyway and regret it.

I made Lima bean chili and my husband made the cheddar muffins. He substituted aged thick buttermilk for the yogurt and decreased the sugar by half. We served them warm with European butter to accompany the chili. Perfect pairing! Delicious! We’d make them again the with the same changes. Nice for a cool Hawaiian winter night. Aloha!

I subbed the butter with canola oil and ditched the sugar altogether. I added a fat handful of chopped green onions as well. These are lighter, fluffier and moister than my standard cheese biscuits, and my new standard.

Excellent! As per other reviewers, I halved the sugar and upped the cheese. I also added a bit of sour cream (1/4 cup perhaps) because the batter seemed too dry when initially mixing. I liked that this was a generous recipe- 12 nice big muffins!

This turned out surprisingly well! As some other users suggested, I halved the sugar. I also increased the cheese to 2 cups - 1 cup of shredded mixed mozzarella, parmesan and cheddar, and 1 cup of grated mature white cheddar. I added some thyme, pepper and dill, then spooned them into tins and topped with more dill. I'm a novice baker who had to sniff all my mum's spices before choosing which ones I wanted, so this could've very well been a disaster! Though next time, I'll probably skip the salt. Soft, cheesy and delicious when served warm. I think there's lots of room to explore and add your own flavours as well. :D

These are very tasty.  I made mini muffins. I added extra cheese as suggested by other reviewers, and just a T. of sugar.  Amazingly, they tasted better cold the next day. I think they would taste good with spaghetti.

I made with gluten free all purpose flour. They were great. The sugar in the recipe makes them like scones. We cut them in half and served with butter and jam. I would omit the sugar if I wanted to use a more savory filling, as they are sweet. The kids devoured them!

This was an instant hit! I made them while cleaning up my parents' house, and my mom ate three fresh out of the oven! They taste as good as they smell, and they're even better with a bit of cream and lingonberry jam!

These were good but not what I was hoping for. They were sweet (and I only used 2/3 recommended sugar) and not cheese enough even though I threw in an extra handful of cheese.

These muffins have a light texture and are delicious!  I didn't make any changes, though there might have been a bit of extra cheese and I sprinkled a bit of grated cheese on top after they came out of the oven.  I used sharp cheddar and the flavour was great.
I will be making them again.

I made these for a couple of foodie friends for lunch with soup and a salad. They tasted fabulous. I added 3/4 cup more cheese and they turned out perfectly. They wanted the recipe so they must have been good.  I will definitely be making these again soon.

This is a great recipe, but I made some changes, I added chopped fresh parsley , dry oregano and garlic powder, otherwise I used the same ingredients, except I added some olive oil with butter and I omitted the sugar and increased cheese to three cups.

I liked this recipe but made some modifications.. Instead of using cheddar cheese I used cubes of halloumi white cheese( about a cup and a half)and added fresh thyme leaves . I felt it was too sweet so I used only one tablespoon of sugar .. The result  was amazing .. Everyone loved it..

These are really good! Not quite what I expected though. Some of the reviews said they were to sweet so I reduced the suger. It was still pretty sweet. I definitely recommend putting more cheese in.
