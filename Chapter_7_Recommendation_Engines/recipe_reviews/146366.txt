I made these in the oven - placed Vidalia Onions in foil pouch and set them on a cookie sheet with edges - Just in case it leaked. Cooked at 400 for 1 hour. I sprinkled with garlic pepper.These were so yummy !!! Next time we grill steaks I will make these onions and put them over my steak. I know it seems like alot of butter but it prevents it from sticking and burning. Yumm Yumm

I actually made mine in the slow cooker and they turned out WONDERFUL! I had a bunch left over so I added them to mayonnaise and make a great burger/sandwich spread. Very very yummy.

Great with grilled steak!  I leave my onion bascially intact just cutting an "X" into it and peeling it back slightly. I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt because of the saltiness of the beef bouillon.  Be sure to poke holes in the foil to allow the steam to escape or you'll have a soupy mess on your hands.

I submitted this recipe and wanted to change something but couldn't so...
You don't have to use softened butter. You can use it right from the fridge and it is actually easier to cut from a cold stick of butter than when it's soft. And garlic powder works great too since the boullion is salty. We love ours a really dark color - almost burnt. Sometimes they take an hour and sometimes I leave them on for an hour and 15 minutes. It really depends on the grill. Hope you enjoy!

I have a friend who makes this but she leaves the onion whole and slices an x into. After she's done she adds mozzarella cheese to it. Now it's grilled onion soup.

Caramelized is definitely a misnomer in this recipe. Mine came out mushy and with a steamed quality.  I think that bouillon granules have a very artificial almost chemical taste so I subbed Penzey's beef soup base, which has a fresher, less salty flavor. Although grilling onions directly or slowly caramelizing them in a skillet is a lot more work, I think it is worth the effort.

Really good.  I cooked mine in the oven for 45 minutes at 400 degrees, in the foil on a cookie sheet.  Next time I will reduce the butter because there was a bit too much.

Excellent burger topping!!  Here are the things  I did differently . . . 1. DIDN'T GRILL THEM!  I didn't have the 40 minutes so I cooked them in a pan on the stove top.  2. Heated some oil in a pan on medium heat (not too much though - maybe about 1 tbsp?).  3. Added 1 cup of chopped onion.  Don't really remember how long I cooked them for exactly.  Maybe 10 minutes or until slightly soft.  4. Added in 1 tbsp butter and  1/2 tsp of beef bouillon granules (which was about 1/2 a cube for me).  5.  Sprinkled with garlic POWDER and pepper.  The bouillon is already pretty salty so just start there and add salt to taste.  6. Turned to low-medium and cooked/stirred until ready to use (probably less than 25 minutes)!!

Just delicious!  I didn't have any beef bouillon so left it out.  I started these in the oven and finished on the grill.  Cooked for an hour and they turned out perfectly!  Were great with our steaks!

An easier way to the same result is to put unpeeled smallish yellow onions directly on the grill. Turn occasionally to keep from burning.  When soft, remove from grill, squeeze them out of their skins, add seasoning of choice and serve.  Fabulous!

Made this for my hubby and he absolutely loved it; especially since Vidalias are back in season. Used garlic powder instead of the salt as the bouillon has plenty of it's own. Thank you!!!!

Mine turned out really soggy and I have no idea where the "caramelized" description comes from. The flavor however was really good, and SO perfect on top of a nice juicy steak. So next time I will try using less butter, a little brown sugar or corn syrup to get the caramelization, and make sure to watch the time..... I have tried recipes like this before and never had luck because they would never get tender enough so I couldn't believe I could overcook an onion on the very top part of the grill for only an hour.

Delicious! I did use olive oil instead of butter, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. What a great flavor with the beef bouillion. Grilled and served with grilled London broil. Used vidalia onions and cut the nice and thick to withstand the grill. Thanks!

Nothing beats these onions. My brother-in-law gave me this recipe with a little different version. I wanted to speed the process up a bit so I cut the cut into wedge but not completely to the bottom, then put in a microwave safe bowl and microwave for about 3 minutes. This starts cooking the onion. I make a "bowl" with foil and transfer (carefully) the onion to foil. Drizzle 2 Tablespoons of olive oil, 1 Tbls of Lemon Pepper, and 1 tbls of minced garlic(from a jar). Then cook in oven or on the grill. The microwave part decreases the cooking time by about 1/2. Enjoy with a good steak.

The only problem I had with this recipe is that I should've made more!!! I used two large Vidalia onions for a group of 6 people. I should've made 1 onion per person. I left out the beef bouillion cube (because I didn't have any) and instead sprinkled a generous amount of seasoning salt and garlic powder. Other than that I cooked just as the recipe says on the BBQ. One thing I will do differently next time is I won't cut up the onions as small as I did because when they cook they shrink down dramatically.  Other than that they were absolutely delicious and all of my guests loved them...even the picky eaters!

SO easy and SO delicious!  This is true comfort food.  Next time I make them I'll add a slice of swiss cheese to melt at the end and serve it in a bowl on top of a slice of texas toast garlic bread.

This is a simple method for caramelized onions.  I don’t think the beef granules added much, so I will probably ignore adding that next time; and I sliced the onion in thin slices so it would cook up quicker.  The onions turned out perfect.

These onions were good, but a bit salty, of course that has more to do with the bouillon I used than the recipe. I cooked the onions on a small baking sheet, covered in foil, over the grill. They caramelized perfectly! I think the pictures accompanying this recipe are very misleading because these onions don't turn out at all like the pics if made correctly (they come out better!). I will definitely make these again but I'd like to cut down on the salt.

Tried this for the first time on camping trip.  I cooked them as directed in the oven since my husband had not set up barbeque yet.  Absolutely delicious.....

If you love Vidalia's, you need to try this recipe - terrific!  I baked them in the oven for an hour - don't forget to stir after 30 minutes. . . we can't wait to try them on the grill for that charcoal flavor!  YUMMY!

WOW!  These were fantastic!!   I started these on the grill, but the gas ran out so finished them in the oven.  They were so flavorful!  Made exactly as directed.  Smelled like french onion soup when I opened the foil.  My family devoured these alongside their steaks.  Thanks for this GREAT recipe!  I will cook these everytime we make steak!

Packet was on fire after 20 minutes.  We're pretty handy with the grill, so I don't know what went wrong.

Can't say enough...YUM! We used them on top of grilled burgers along with bacon, mayo with melted jarlsberg cheese. Made for the best burger (my mouth is watering just thinking about it)!

This recipe rocks!  Best with large onion.  My boyfriend loved it and wants it now instead of baked potatoes!
I made this on the "Big Green Egg"  (outdoor grill) and it smelled wonderful!

This one is a keeper!

(I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt)

FANTASTIC! These were surprisingly sweet and delicious.  I halved the onions and baked them for 45 minutes at 400.  Next time I will quarter the onions to make serving easier.

I made these with very large red onions and vidalia onions. Instead of the butter is sprayed the onions with some pam and sprinkled Mrs. Dash and some salt on top of them. Make sure to oil the grill grate before placing the onions on - to prevent the onions from sticking to the grate and falling apart. Delicious!

My FIL gave me a little different recipe for onions on the grill.  He gets a big sweet onion and slices it almost all the way through (think Bloomin Onion from the Outback).  Stick slices of butter (1/2 stick) into the cut onion, add salt and pepper.  Top with shredded parmesean cheese and before you wrap it up in foil, add 2 icecubes.  Cook on the grill for at least 45 minutes.  It is so good - my wholed family loves it and they can be picky eaters!

Delicious!  Served with grilled steak, but I ate the onions all by themself they were so good.  I might try adding fresh mushrooms to it next time.  So simple, and so yummy. Also, I used Valida Onions and I think that made a difference.

I made these in the oven, as other reviews suggested.  40 minutes @ 400 degrees.  I used minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  They turned out great, and we will definitely be making them again.

I made this at camp this year and I figured, I had time to go for a short bike ride and it would be done by the time I got back, well I came back and there was hardly any left! Next time I will definitely make more then just 1 onion. My family told me that it was starting to smell so good that they couldn't hold back any longer. 

So delicious!!

After all the rave reviews for this recipe, I was super excited to try it out on our new Weber. Very true that it was easy, but the end result was not as good as I was hoping. May have been from our cooking technique, but the onions didn't get carmelized at all (no browning). They were soft and tasted OK, but I wanted some of that grill flavor. Next time will do in more direct heat and probably cut back on the butter, as I think the moisture limited the ability to brown maybe. I've done onions in foil on the grill in the past and just sprayed with a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and they turn out good, so maybe I'll do the same, but add the beef boullion for flavor instead of salt next time. Sorry for the bum review, but they just weren't all that great.

Hands down, the best grilling dish EVER! Even my friends who hate onions will gobble this dish up. Don't change a thing about this recipe, except that if you use a smaller onion, then you may want to halve the bouillon cube and the amt of butter.

I first found out about this recipe from 
Paula Deen's cooking show. I've made it 
almost every time I grill because they are SO wonderful. It's like having french onion soup but without all the work. Nommy.

I made this recipe along with baked chicken on the grill (from this site). They were both delicious. My picky children loved the onions. I will make these every time I grill and will probably try them in the oven as other reviewers suggested.  I saved the leftovers in a zip-lock bag along with the leftover chicken. Heated up together in the microwave the next day. It was wonderful!

awesome.  I prepared them, and then had to wait until the next evening to cook them. So even after 1 night in the refrigerator, they were great.  Would definitely make again.

These were fantastic.  I actually forgot to use the garlic salt, I'll try it again the next time, but they were still great.  I put them in the oven at 400 and intended on cooking them for 60 minutes, but after 40 our dinner was done.  They were very, very tender so we ate them anyway.  Delicious!

This is wonderful and easy. It makes a great compliment to any steak or poultry dish you may be fixing. I often times will cook this in the oven at 400 degrees for about an hour. Make sure to take the foil out half way or so,stir it a little,  and then return to oven.
