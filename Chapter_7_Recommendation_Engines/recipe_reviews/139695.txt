Tasty enough....of the two funny cake recipes on here...you're both doing it wrong. :D  Take it from a funny cake expert.  You put the batter in the pan FIRST, then you have to pour the chocolate ON TOP of the cake part.

We love this pie/cake! It's so easy my 11 year old makes it for us. You just have to be careful putting the chocolate layer on. That's the trick to getting it to set up right. But it is tasty, and we love that we usually have all the ingredients without having to go to the store. YUMMMMY

This tasted good, but it didn't flip.  Not sure what I did wrong.  The chocolate spilled out of the sides and onto the bottom of the oven.  It ended up a thin layer at the bottom of the cake between the cake and pie crust.  Love to hear how it went for others. I would try it again as it did taste yummy.  Thanks.

I thought when I tried this recipe something wasn't right - the funny cake white batter is supposed to be placed in the bottom of the pie plate then the chocolate goes on top - the chocolate layer sinks to the bottom as it bakes - this is where the term "Funny Cake" comes from.

This was ok. I put the sauce on the top of the cake before baking and then it ended up at the bottom, on top of the crust but under the cooked cake. I'm thinking that is how it is supposed to be done as it does flip if you do it that way. Anyway, I didn't mind it but no one else in my family seemed to enjoy it.

Doesn't really flip but intermingles with the cake layer.  Amish food is simple tasting, not pizzazy and this funny cake is very delicate on the palate.  It's not heavy on the stomach and not overpowering. I plan to make it on a regular basis.  Thanks for sharing!

mine did not flip either. Not even that tasty. I was very disapointed. For the precision it takes to spoon batter in was not worth it in the taste department.....and it didnt even flip!
