I served this when my son and his wife were visiting.  Everyone agreed it had good flavor, and made a good ADDITION to mayonnaise, but not a good substitute.  We mixed them half/half.  Tasty, but a lot of work.

This was a very nice twist from the usual butter or mayo dip. I replaced the garlic powder with garlic cloves and it was very delicious! I love how low in calories it is too!

I had high-hopes for this one as I'm a real fan of artichokes.  The flavor was weak: too lemony and not enough mustard.  And I may have to agree with an earlier comment about the flavor not being quite "right" for artichokes.

I am a weight watcher and just loved this recipe.  What a great dip for artichokes.  I used fresh garlic and dijon mustard.  My husband was even pleased.  I will make this one again!

I liked this dip and im not really a fan of mustard too much so i enjoyed the lemoney flavor. I used a seedy mustard that i have found i liked over others so it probably depends on themustard you use as to the flavor of the dip. Overall though i really did like this recipe.

This was good but not spectactular.  I don't know if I have artichokes again that I'll remember I used it.  I used minced garlic instead of the powder and added 1/4 cup of light mayonaisse.    It was still a very soupy consistency but worked okay for us.

This turned out really well, and had a good taste, but I did not like it with my artichoke, and reverted back to hollandiase. It would be good on something else, maybe as a sauce for a chicken dish...

I like mustard and lemon but did not like them together in this dip, which was also not complementary to the taste of the artichoke. Plus, all the corn starch gave the dip a gelatinous texture, which I did not enjoy.

It was a bit strong. Not really sure how to tone it down, maybe a little less lemon juice? Very tasty, just not my favorite.

It's really good... I don't know what people are complaining about.. people's pallets are use to artificial goopy mayo and oils I guess. Lemony and a good consistency knowing how much more healthy it is, makes it worth it.

This is a great dipping sauce for artichokes.  Made it exactly as written, and everyone loved it.

Was hoping the sauce would be predominately lemon flavored with a hint of mustard - not the case. The taste of mustard was overwhelming.  Won't make this one again. . .
