mmmmm! this was delicious! I wanted to make spaghetti for dinner but I didn't want to use our same old sauce. This was fantastic. I will definitly make it again soon The only reason that it isn't 5 stars, is because i didn't use the same proportions. I added about three cups of mushrooms (which was actually a little less than I wanted) and I didn't use 3/4 cups of wine. I think I probably used about half a cup maybe less, and I think more might have been too much. But other than that: AWESOME. Thank you grandma Maggio for this great recipe.

Oh my goodness, this was FABULOUS!

I unfortunately did not have the merlot (I had Lambrusco) nor did I have the amount of mushrooms (I only had 4oz canned) nor the amount of basil (my bush only had enough for 1/4 cup).

Regardless of these 3 items, the other items required I did have on hand. Since I have cooked my own version of a sauce with the higher amounts of these items, I know how much BETTER this recipe would have been.

I will make it again exactly as calls for, unless I prefer a lesser sweetness, but I found it quite enjoyable and a nice change form the standard type flavors.

THIS SAUCE ROCKS!! Try it exactly as written, so you can get a great idea of the taste.

Much thanks and appreciation for this wonderful keeper (at least in my family's cookbook) of a recipe.

EDIT 09/11/2011 - To really make it special try adding the meatballs from 'lovestohost' - "Meatball Nirvana". Yowsa.

This sauce is simply amazing. The flavors are fantastic. Its thick and rich. DONT leave out the wine. Its a very important part of the finished product and will affect the flavor outcome. I will never buy jar sauce again.

I was super excited to make this sauce and followed the directions to the letter.  While I did like the sauce, I have to say that I was a little disappointed.  I wanted to give it a fair shot and waited for two days to review it.  I know that often times, flavors need time to meld before the finished product can be judged fairly.  This sauce is just okay but not worthy of five stars.  I liked the flavor of the merlot wine -- it made a richer sauce.  However, I think I will keep my original recipe handed down through my paternal Italian side of the family and add the merlot as a boost to the flavors.

I left the salt out. just a pinch of sugar. I left this, after a quick boil, on a simmer for @7 hours. this was very good. I really should have doubled this. I wanted to use this sauce in lasagna. too many taste testings :) I used chef john's meatball recipe with this. a killer combination!

Delicious!  Wow!  I had a jar of minced garlic and only used 1 Tablespoon.  Also, instead of using a large can of whole peeled tomatoes,  I used two regular cans of petite diced tomatoes.  I thought it turned out great, and I didn't have to work to cut up the tomatoes.  I also used 3 tsp. dry basil because I didn't have fresh basil.  I omitted the mushrooms and added 1 lb. ground beef at the end.  It was great even without the ground beef,  I just wanted some protein for dinner, too!  Yummy!  I can't wait to make it again!

This is fantastic! I left out the tomato paste and wine and it was still great. Nice sweet and tangy balance. This is definitely a recipe I will use again.

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good sauce...just way too thick and chunky, and way too much garlic and onion for us.  I had a hard time chopping the tomatoes in the pot with a spoon, at the end of the cooking I still had huge blobs of tomato. I ended up putting it in the food processor to break up the chunks better.  This sauce turned out so thick that I could scoop it up with a fork.  Since I struggled with the thickness and broke out the extra equipment, it ended up being more work and more of a mess to clean up than I expected.   If I made it again I would try half the garlic and onion, and start with crushed or pureed tomatoes instead of whole.  Sadly my husband couldn't finish his because it was too garlicky for him.  I'm planning on blending the leftover sauce with plain tomato sauce to mellow and thin it out a bit more for us, since I still have quite a bit left.  At least I had fun trying something new!

Wow!  This sauce was amazing.  My hubby and daughter gobbled it up served over spaghetti with some Parmesan cheese.  I did not use the mushrooms because I don't care for them but followed the directions as written.  I used a white Merlot wine.

This was great!  I made this with only three cloves of garlic, crushed tomatoes instead of whole, and an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I used the cheapest Merlot I could find (only $3.50) and it turned out great!  My husband and I loved this sauce!  I cannot wait to make it again!

Have already made this twice in two weeks.  Very good. I only omitted the mushrooms but added green peppers.  The second time I didn't have fresh basil and it was still very good but it was better with it.

WAY Too much Garlic and oregano.  You could barely tell it was tomato sauce.  They overpowered the tomato completely, you couldn't taste anything but garlic and oregano.  Its great to dress a pizza, but overwhelming in a saucewhere you should be able to taste tomato.

This is my third year of canning this sauce. I love it. The flavors mix well and the red wine just adds a heartiness that pulls everything together. I follow the recipe except for reducing the salt, pepper, and the red wine by about 1/3rd. I use garden tomatoes and scale everything up to 70 servings. It yields over 9 quarts. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper!!

So very good, and so easy with a fresh homemade flavor. Used 1/4 cup sugar, a Syrah, and my own meatballs served over veggie penne. It makes a ton, so be prepared for multiple lunches or dinners from the one batch.

Super easy recipe I use all the time. I don't buy the bottled stuff anymore. And it's versatile. Sometimes I leave out the wine, mushrooms and garlic and it's still good!

Didn't have fresh basil so I used the regular spice. And I added some Italian sausage to the sauce and it was wonderful! My husband says the next time I make this, I should substitute the white sugar for brown sugar. Either way, this is a great sauce that I intend to make again and again.

This was a great basic sauce. The only changes I made was adding celery with the onion and red pepper for more veggies. Also added some red pepper flakes for heat and a bit more dried herbs to taste. It was fantastic and very easy. Next time I'd maybe cut the sugar down a little but other than that this is a keeper! We also made meatballs to go with it and I'd highly recommend doing that too if you can.

This sauce is amazing!! It tasted just like my moms. I did have to make a few alterations to fit what I had on hand. I used crushed tomatoes instead od whole. I was also out of fresh Basil so I used dry. I did double this recipe but not the sugar. I thought it was a bit too sweet which is why only four stars but the family and guests thought it was perfect. I will never use jarred sauce again.

I'm in love with this sauce. And I don't even like Italian. Have made it numerous times. Cook it in crock pot for 15 hrs. I used mushroom soup instead of fresh and all dried spices.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and it was one of the best I’ve ever had. My family is Italian so we have plenty of recipes that we always rely upon but I’m adding this to my rotation whether they like it or not.

I have been making this for years now Thank you I have added and taken away a few things.  I will never change or buy store again.  I use 4TBS of olive oil, 1TBS of butter in the saucepan.   Then I use diced tomatos instead of whole, I also double the diced tomatoes and extra half tomato paste. When it calls for wine I used half and the other half I used italian dressing (yes Italian) this makes the sauce pop.  After making the sauce, and before the other ingredients I put two cut up potatoes quartered let sit for 1 to 2 hrs to soak up  some of the acid. The meat I use is 1lb of hamburger and 1lb of italian sausage (sweet)cooked together and drained.  Then let it simmer for hours.  I have yet to find anybody to beat me at a cook off using this recipt.
Thanks again 
Jeff

Very good Spaghetti Sauce but I did cut down on the amount of sugar because our garden tomatoes turned out very sweet this year and I didn't feel it would be needed.

I left out the sugar and used dried herbs. I will use a little less wine next time as the taste seemed to overpowered the sauce a bit. I also added ground beef. Definitely a new favorite.

I've made this sauce many times, and it is always a hit. I've since starting adding ground turkey and diced Kalamata olives, which add another surprising kick. The repeated complimented (always), "This is the best sauce I have ever tasted!" Thank you, Sarah, for a super recipe.

Great sauce! I did substitute crushed tomatoes for the whole tomatoes and cut way back on the garlic (4 cloves). Didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used can button mushrooms and they were fantastic. Will make again but I think I'll cut the sugar in half. Was a little too sweet.

We use a dutch oven to cook the sauce in for 6 hours, the flavors and taste are amazing. We use this sauce for meatball sandwiches and sausage sandwiches. Other than adding a few extra spices, I would not change anything about this recipe. GREAT STUFF!

Growing up in an Italian Family I was taught how to make this gravy at a young age. We add mild / sweet Italian Sausage (spicy if it is just for myself and my husband) to the gravy and bay leaves. I  saute the onions and garlic in the left over fat from the sausage. Laying flavors! Also add Olive Oil to the gravy while simmering. The variations to add to the gravy can be adjusted according to what you like when it comes to meat and veggies to use.

This is actually very rich and good. The wine alone is enough sugar. I will make this again and use maybe 1/8th of a cup. The flavor is wonderful but you cannot handle more than 3 bites because of the richness. The wine does make it perfection and it is rich. Next time I will do my onions and mushrooms in butter and fresh garlic. Thanks for this recipe as I think I can make it to perfection.

Cut sugar in half as I think it was a bit too sweet. Otherwise the best I have ever made and a family favorite.

Delicious!  I skipped the merlot and oregano,sauteed the onions, garlic and mushrooms with butter instead of olive oil and quadrupled the amount of mushrooms.  Definitely one of the better spaghetti sauces I've had, much appreciated!

This is seriously the best homemade spaghetti sauce recipe. I've made it two times already, Its super versatile as well. Both times I've made it I've left out the Mushrooms and Basil because I never seem to have either of those, and its still so delicious, I also cut the sugar in half. It makes canned spaghetti sauce you buy taste like pizza sauce.

This was amazing and different than any other sauce I've ever had. I added red bell peppers to the mix and it was just right. Highly recommend!

It was very good! I'll definitely make it again! I add a little cayenne pepper for a little heat. Nothing major. This recipe definitely tastes a lot more fresh. If you don't like fresh, don't try this!

Easy to make and delicious, even without the mushrooms! I used a red blend instead of merlot and still came out great.

I added a sweet sausage and a mild Italian sausage, plus a pound of hamburger. The sauce was nice and thick. Everyone loved it on thin spaghetti.

Our girls love spaghetti night! Quite often we let them make spaghetti sauce from a jar since they started experimenting in the kitchen. They had quite a bit of homework tonight so I spun the spatula for the family this fine evening. I like a little heat in my sauce so I used one can of petite diced tomatoes and one can of petite diced tomatoes with green chilies. I personally despise sugar in spaghetti sauce so I eliminated that all together. I did not have any fresh basil on hand so I subbed with 1/8 cup of freeze dried basil. These ratings only allow for whole stars but we agreed as a family that this deserves 4.25!!! Will definitely be making this again. Thanks Grandma Maggio!

I made this tonight and it was scrumptious! The only diviation from the recipe above was that I used crushed tomatoes only because the store didn't have the whole. I think the next time, I would add more 'shrooms! Served it over angel hair.

It is only 4 stars because I actually combined your recipe with the recipe on this site,"italian meatballs and spaghetti," and omitted the tomato sauce from this recipe. I added more whole peeled tomatoes, added some red pepper to my taste(because I love spicy food), and it was so good!! I do simmer my sauce for a couple of hours to get the flavors combined very well. Thank you for your recipe!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing!  I can't say enough about this sauce.  

I have been making this for over a year now.  I always make exactly as written.  Do not skip on the wine or sugar, they add an interesting, special something that is different from most sauces.    I find that this is best with hot Italian sausage, (as opposed to meatballs) because the Heat from the sausage works well with the sweetness of the sauce.   Enjoy!

I made this tonight for dinner for extended family and absolutely loved it!!! I'm not a great cook even though I've tried several recipes they never seemed to turn out the way that I wanted...until this one.  The only changes that I made were that the grocery store was out of fresh basil so I bought a tomato sauce that already had basil in it (Hunt's), and I bought crushed tomatoes rather than whole tomatoes (as another reviewer suggested). I made it in the morning and threw it in the crockpot to simmer on low for the day.  It was SO MUCH BETTER than a store bought sauce doctored up (which is what I had done in the past)...and it really comes together quickly!  It was a beautiful color and clung to the pasta perfectly.  I made homemade meatballs and added them....Wow!! I'll try the fresh basil next time and update my review.  Thank you so much for submitting a recipe that actually lived up to its rating : )

A keeper.  Tasty and fairly easy.  My minor modifications:  I didn't add salt, plenty in all the tomato products; I replaced the black pepper with about 1/4 t. ground red pepper flakes; and I cut the sugar by half.  Perfect and vegetarian friendly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this tonight for dinner, followed the directions exactly and it was amazing! My husband  three year old both had seconds!
