This recipe is from topsecretrecipies.com under Soup Nazi

It's really good for an appetizer. Mild flavor. You may need to add more salt and thyme. Adding a little garlic can be fun too.

I really liked this, and so did The Fam. made it as an appetizer for a "formal" family dinner where new people were introduced to the family and it went over big! I only used 6 cups of water but doubled the half and half. next time I might try heavy cream instead. I offered sour cream,brown sugar and cinnamon as garnishes.

I liked it!

I made some variations because of lack of ingredient, and preference:

Instead of : new ingredient
tomato sauce & water : tomato juice
thyme : cayenne, turmeric, onion powder

extra:
salt, butter

skipped:
half & half, pepper, cashew

Also, to make it smooth, after simmering for 10 mins, let it cool a bit and pop it in the blender!

this soup was very bland and uninteresting. the cashews got very soggy and squishy and generally unpleasant. I would not recommend this soup.

This recipe was OK but it wasn't very interesting. Also you cannot get half and half in england.

I had difficulty mashing the yam using a fork. I suppose the yam can be baked longer than the specified amount of time. 

I won't be using this recipe again
