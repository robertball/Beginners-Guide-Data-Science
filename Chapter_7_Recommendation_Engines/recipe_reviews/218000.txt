This is our favorite base for strawberries (or any other fruit).   I prefer to use butter and this has to be extremely well creamed with sugar.   You can also cut back on sugar by 1/4 cup.   Do not overmix when adding flour and milk.  These are just a few tips on this little gem of a cake being successful.    Can also be used for an upside down cake - the possibilities are endless. Enjoy and thanks for submitting something straightforward and simple.

The submitter describes her grandmother's cake quite accurately, and Hubs and I were both pleased she decided to share the recipe with us as we enjoyed it a great deal. It's tender, sweet and moist, perfect as shortcake, but I could easily see this as cupcakes too.  Even a 9x9" cake tends to be too much for Hubs and me, so I baked these in a 6-heart shaped individual Wilton cakelet pan, which yielded 12, perfectly portioned little cakes.  One or two per serving is quite sufficient and the rest I simply froze for quick future desserts.  The recipe is perfect as is - those grandmas sure did know what they were doing!

Oh my gosh, this is so yummy!  The only change was, I made it with butter instead of shorting.  I served it with fresh strawberries and pineapple topped with homemade whipped cream with a bit of cream cheese in it. This is a dessert I will make again and again!

Fantastic recipe! I made it exactly as directed. I sprayed a 9x9 baking dish, sprayed it with non-stick spray, put down parchment paper, sprayed again, and it came out of the pan beautifully after cooling 10 min.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I also had to keep it in the oven longer. In total, almost 50 min in the oven for a toothpick "inserted into center comes out clean". It's late, and I'm really tired, BUT..I put my strawberry sauce and homemade whipped cream on top of a slice of it while it was still warm and my tummy is ooooooooh so happy! YUM! I would like to experiment with this recipe. Like adding perhaps 1/2 tsp of vanilla next time, maybe sub half the shortening with butter.  Just for fun, NOT because it needs it. OH, also, DO  NOT skimp on the sugar.  Thank you!  ps..I'd love to know why it's called Cottage Pudding cake lol

I admit I had reservations about this cake but wanted to try it because I wanted to make strawberry shortcake and wanted to try something other than my usual and this cake notes that it is for shortcake recipes. I still wasn't convinced when I made the batter, still wasn't convinced when the cake was baked but was overwhelmed when I put it all together because it made the best ever strawberry shortcake! Outstanding!! It's sorta like a cross between a sponge cake and pound cake, not one or the other but both somehow. It soaked up the liquid from the berries, had a perfect crumb, was moist, slightly sweet and just made the dessert. On it's own it doesn't seem to be anything special but when combined with sweet juicey fruit and whipped cream it's perfect. This would be good with peaches too. Thanks Kaylene for sharing your Grandmother's recipe! It's a keeper.

I have been making a recipe that is very similar, only thing different is that some of the measurements of the ingredients  are slightly less. I have been making this cake for 25+ years. Would not make anything  else for our shortcake, the recipe can be doubled with no problems, just use a 11 x 13 or similar size pan and I have always greased the pan with some spray Pam.

Wow this cake was fantastic!  A perfect intersection of biscuit and cake for strawberry shortcake.  It combines the sweet, delicateness of cake with the heartier texture and outer crust of biscuits.  The crust on this cake was actually the best part -- an almost caramelized, lightly crunchy exterior.  Awesome!  

I did use butter instead of shortening, which I suspect helped with the yummy carmelizing on the crust.  I put it in an 8"x11.5" pan (all I had available), which I'd sprayed, lined with parchment and sprayed again.  It needed about 33 minutes to come out toothpick clean and was perfect that way.  Came out of the pan with the crust in tact and beautiful.

I usually find strawberry shortcake bases too bland or too tough and biscuit-like. This one was none ot those things and will be my only base for shortcake from now on!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake is, unfortunately, too good.  I ate entirely more than my share!  At first I thought the taste of baking powder was too strong, but later decided that was part of why I liked it so much.  I did have to keep resetting the timer to get it done in the middle.  So,  my question is...should it be cake like in the center, or should I have pulled it out after 25 minutes, so it would be like pudding in the middle?  Whatever...I like it a lot!

I made this for the first time, and it is very good.  We did eat it as shortcake, but is good alone.  I even put too much shortening in by mistake and it still turned out good.  I would make it again.

This is a KEEPER!  The only swap I made was to use butter in place of the shortening.  This was perfectly moist w/ the right amount of sweetness.  I could see this being a great base to morph other recipes off of.

I've been looking for a simple but good shortcake recipe. I love strawberry shortcakes, and never made 1 myself. And this was my first 1 I made, and it seemed so easy compared to the rest. And so glad I picked this 1 to try.  You won't be sorry to try this! I didn't have any strawberries, I just wanted to try it before i went out and bought some. And this is good all by itself! Yummy, I'm sure even better with the strawberries! And I read some of the other reviews, and some had different timing then what the recipe had said. Mine came out right on time, 25mins exactly. I guess it just depends on your oven.

Made this exactly to the recipe and it was a hit.  I'm going to make it as a sheet cake sometime and frost it with a strawberry glaze and then whipped topping.  Should be awesome!

I made this last night for my bf's birthday cake.  I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out perfect.  I sliced it in half horizontally, filled & topped it with homemade strawberry whipped cream & strawberry purée. & ending it with sliced fresh strawberries on top.  Best strawberry shortcake ever!  Huge hit!  Thank you.  This is my go to from now on.

I have been making this recipe for years and years, I sometimes add blueberries in the recipe and then use it with a hot brown sugar sauce over it, delicious.  It is the only recipe I use for Strawberry shortcake. 
I have it in  y recipe box as a "one egg cake", but the recipe is the same as this one.

Fabulous! I can't stay out of it.  So, sooooo good! Mine did take an extra 14 min. to bake....not sure why. I double checked my oven temp & it was right on but maybe it wasn't hot enough to start?? IDK, just keep that in mind, just in case you have to bake longer also.

I followed others' suggestions and substituted butter for shortening and did not make any other changes to the batter ingredients.  I chose to make cupcakes (1 dozen) out of the batter.  I greased (w/shortening) and floured each cup in the pan.  I like to use a regular sized ice cream disher for measuring out batter into cupcake/muffin tins, and I was able to fit one leveled scoop of batter plus maybe a third into each cup in the tin.  **This did require a lot of scraping of the bowl and the disher to fill each of the 12 cups equally.  Baked at 350F for 20 minutes and they came out just barely browned around the edges.  The taste is plain for us just by itself, but it will be perfect for individual strawberry shortcakes.  **We live in Northern CO and also have a gas oven; I would watch carefully if you choose to bake these as cupcakes to make sure they don't get dried out.

This cake was delicious topped with strawberries and whipped cream for dessert and served plain as a coffeecake with breakfast the next morning.  I did sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar before baking it and I used softened butter in place of vegetable shortening.

GREASE AND FLOUR YOUR PANS!!! It just says grease in the instructions.  I had to make a second double batch because it stuck to the both pans.  BUT ~~~This was so good!  I doubled the recipe because I was going to do more of a double layer cake presentation with strawberries and whip cream.  My son wants it as his birthday cake with frosting (not a berries and whip cream kind of kid).  It did take longer than the time it says, but then again, I had to lower my oven temp by 25 degrees because I was using darker non stick pans.

While I only make strawberry shortcake a couple times each year, it's the dessert I enjoy most of all. Strawberries in season macerated in sugar, a big bowl of heavy cream whipped with a little bit of superfine sugar...but then came the problem of the shortcake. Over time, I've tried many kinds of 'shortcake' and while some were quite lovely, nothing made me stop searching for something better. Until now. THIS IS WHERE MY QUEST ENDS. The only modification I made to this recipe was to double it and bake it in a 10x14" pan. I didn't substitute anything, so as to be able to judge the recipe as written. It's perfection - a sticky, tender, just-sweet-enough crumb that happily soaks up strawberry juice and is the peerless hybrid of biscuit and cake. I'll never make another shortcake! Thank you so much to Kaylene for submitting this!

Made this a few days before Easter and I froze it for freshness. Once thawed I topped it with whipped cream and  strawberries.  It was dense and moist.  Really good for the whip creme and fresh strawberries.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  Made this for my mother's birthday after she told me this was her and my grandfathers favorite way for for any kind of fruit shortcake wither it be strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, etc.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 13x9 backing dish and it had to bake for 50+ minutes for the center to cook but came out great.  I even had a chunk with sausage gravy over it which was surprisingly quite excellent (course I had to have a second helping) LOL.

I used butter instead of shortening. And everyone L O V E, loved it! Added Fresh bluberry Compote, vanilla pudding, whipped cream. I will be using this recipe for years to come. Can't wait for strawberry season.

This is the One Egg Cake my mom would bake as an afterschool snack for us!(This was some fifty plus years ago!) It was the best! She would sometimes add orange or lemon zest to change it up! What a joy to find this recipe! I am going to bake one right now and surprise my mom w/ some!

I misread the size for the pan and I had to bake it another 15 minutes because I used an 8" square.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  Perfect for these strawberries and cream.

When I was looking for a cake for the strawberry shortcakes a client requested, I tried this one. It got such amazing reviews. The taste was somewhere between a biscuit and a cake, tender, moist, and just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the berries. Topped with homemade whipped cream and it's a hit! No changes needed.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made this for the first time over Labor Day weekend 2011.  The shortcake is very good...just what you would expect taste and consistency-wise.  I used my 9x9 inch metal pan and the baking time was 30 minutes (checked after 25 min as in directions).  I did not turn the cake out onto another plate...just left it in the pan.

AMAZING!! I was looking for a recipe that would be close to what my mmom makes for strawberry shortcake. She calls it one egg cake, but I didn't have luck searching for that. I am so glad I found this recipe. It is DELICIOUS! It's light and fluffy. Someone commented that it's not very sweet, so I sprinkled sugar on top before baking it in a pie pan. I loved the sugary crunch on top. Other than that I made no changes to the original recipe. I will be making this again and again!

This is a good shortcake for strawberries.  It rose up nicely and baked well, although I had to bake for 16 additional minutes as it was no where near done at the 25 minute mark.

Wonderful cake to serve as the base for strawberry shortcake. The cake soaked up the syrup nicely. We really enjoyed this easy to put together cake.

This is exactly the one egg cake recipe my mum,then sisters, then me, then my nieces - well, you get the picture - made for our favorite b-day cake! With this cake, cut right from the pan, we'd pour homemade chocolate sauce/syrup or a lemon sauce. Sometimes I'd cook up a batch of pudding and use that for the sauce. I believe the name and the dish is one example of many New England quirkly named items from way back in the day. Ever hear of blueberry slump? Apple pan dowdy? Johnnycake? I think mum's recipe did not even have a heat level or time! Right now I'm salivating at the memory....

perfect. I don't like the crumbly biscuit shortcake, this is a mix between that and cake!  Perfect with the strawberries that have been soaked in sugar, lime and tequila.

Lovely recipe! I did substitute butter for shortening, and it baked for much longer than 30min (about 40-50). I'm thinking next time I'll bake this in a half sheet pan to make serving strawberry shortcakes easier :)

Like other reviewers, it took about 50 min. to bake.  I believe I should have used two pans instead of one and of course, it probably would have cooked in 25 min.  In the directions, you will notice the person who submitted the recipe used the word PANS instead of pan.  Therefore, I believe two pans are needed instead of one.  I was not impressed with the cake, but my husband liked it.  He's like Mikey though, he will eat anything.

Delicious!  I made it as directed, and it was perfect with strawberries, lots of juice to soak into the cake with whipped cream on top.  I think I will serve it with peaches tomorrow.  This will always be my choice for shortcake.

I made the cake  without recipe changes. It has a nice dense texture suitable for shortcake. For me it was a bit on the  too sweet side, but other family members liked it as is. Next time, I might reduce the sugar.

I'd been looking for a shortcake recipe that wasn't dry and tasteless when I came across this one.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used the suggestion to add some butter with the shortening.  Perfection!  This will be my shortcake recipe from now on.  Thank you.

This was a nice little cake for strawberry shortcake! I made these as cupcakes (backed about 20 minutes) and they turned out nicely. They weren't too sweet, so it didn't overpower the strawberries. I would make this again!

I doubled the recipe to fit into a 9x13 pan, thinking a 9x9 amount would not be enough. But it certainly would have been - this goes a long way! It was quite good, crumbly, and soaked up my strawberry juice nicely. Next time I won't double the recipe as I will have to buy like 6 more containers of strawberries to use it all up. Also, I used butter rather than shortening.

I also used butter and this cake is amazing with strawberries. I'm going to make it now and serve with fresh blueberries!  No more box shortcake for my family!

Following other reviewer's advice, I changed this recipe a little, and it was perfect! I exchanged the shortening for butter, and since I used salted butter I left out the salt. I cut back just a tiny bit on the sugar, but I could have cut a little bit more. I would definitely recommend this recipe with that modification. I might even do half shortening half butter since it seemed very buttery, but since I haven't tried that I won't 'officially' recommend that modification. Just a little side note, and it should come out pretty fantastic.

MMMmmm. I followed this recipe to a tee. Can I say how good the batter was!? It pained me to even put it in the oven! I just wanted to eat the whole bowl!

Perfect!  I ran out of store bought shortcakes and didn't feel like running to the store.  This recipe is so easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I followed the recipe as it is but I used a Yorkshire pudding tin to make single serving cakes.  Popped them in the oven for 13 minutes.  Worked out great and the family can't stop eating them!

i would give this three stars,  I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary, but my husband loved it and ate 2 huge pieces after his first piece.  Followed the recipe exactly. Next time would likely add a little more vanilla. Very easy to make.

The cake didn't have much flavor. I'm going back to an old-fashioned sweet-biscuit type of strawberry shortcake.

I've made this a bunch of times- doubled it for a crowd, made it in muffin tins, used it for pineapple upside down cake. It's great no matter what you do to it.

This Cake is fantastic! It's easy to make, it's sweet, but not overly sweet. I didn't change a thing, didn't have to!

This was delicious.  Ran out of strawberries and whipped cream so we happily finished it off without.  Yummy!

Perfect!  Just what I was looking for in a shortcake to have with strawberries and whipped cream.  I  used butter-flavored shortening.
