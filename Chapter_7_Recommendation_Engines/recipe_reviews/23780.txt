I fixed this for a dinner party with vegetarians and it was a hit.  My husband did not like the dressing, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it.

This was a nice salad.  I didn't have champagne so I used extra virgin olive oil, a bit of sugar, 2 tsp of fresh lemon juice along with the other dressing ingredients listed on the recipe.

I would probably make this again.
