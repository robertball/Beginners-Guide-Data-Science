I tried this today and it was very easy and fast! I made some brown gravy and put them into it and served with mash potatoes and veggies. I also added some mexican spice with the italian spice and it was a great taste!

Quite good for such an easy recipe.  In the future I might add green pepper or garlic, but the flavor is very well balanced if made as described.  1lb. of beef doesn't go too far, so if you want to have extra for additional meals or have more than 2 people you want to feed more than twice off of this, you might want to double it.  Time saving, and a good idea.

These were simple and tasty.  I wouldn't call them sophisticated so if you are trying to impress someone, they wouldn't be my first choice - however, I'll probably make these for my family going forward because they are so simple.  I did add garlic powder and would possibly swap out the ketchup for spaghetti sauce.

Love how easy and effective this was!  My girls just discovered meatballs and I have been buying them in the frozen section.  I wanted something easy to make where I control the ingredients.  The technique is ingenious and it will be a staple in my house.  I look forward to playing with ingredients. I tripled this recipe and will be freezing many of them.  Thanks again!

I'm giving this 4 stars just for the sheer ease of making it.  But instead of putting the mixture into a 9 x 12 pan and shaping it into an 8" square, why don't you just bake it in an 8" square pan, which is what I did!  The taste was okay, nothing special, but very easy to make and the square meatballs look cute.

Easy and tasty! This was enjoyed by my whole family and my parents. I used Mrs. Dash Italian Blend Seasoning for my seasonings and I added it it plain bread crumbs as well. That gave it lots of good flavor and I didn't need the optional salt. I also used dried chopped onion.

Very delicious, I added more ingredients - Chopped Garlic, Worcestershire Sauce, and Garlic Salt.  Cooked in a loaf pan, also tried with a little A-1 when done, not bad either.  I will make it again, possibly with cheese on top or wrapped inside.

Meat mixture was too soupy to hold it's shape, added 3/4 c breadcrumbs. Taste was bland, added plenty of Lawry's Seasoning Salt.

Genius idea! Thank you!  This is the only way I'm going to make my meatballs from now on. Making in for the second time tonight. I tweak the recipe as I always do with any recipes.
