My husband and I made this and it came out super tasty.  It was thick, but that was okay for us  If you are like another reviewer and expect something not too thick, reduce the amount of flour and corn tortillas or add more stock.  

We added some mushrooms and canned corn when we added the chicken and those were really nice additions.  I will defintely make this again, but next time I am going to roast and peel the poblanos since I think that will add a nice roasted flavor and remove the tough texture of the skin.  
Enjoy!

This was very tasty and we enjoyed it very much - rather "substantial" and filling.  I took the advice of other reviewers and I used a good heaping 1/2 cup of the chopped peppers, and added more chicken stock to thin the soup a bit as it cooked to get it to a not overly thick consistency.  I also used closer to a cup of chopped chicken to make it even more of a meal.  My only other comment is it makes a lot less than I expected:  I do not know how Holly gets 9 servings from this unless they are very small.  I would say you get more like four salad/cereal bowl sized servings, so you may want to double this recipe if you want more for seconds or leftovers.

I have already made this 3 times.  Be warned... you have to add WAY more liquid to it.  I think I used about 8 cups of chicken broth last time.  As a result I had to up the tortilla and flour mixture, but just by a little.  I garnish it with cheddar cheese, the tortilla strips, and also cilantro and green onions.  Those garnishes make the flavor perfect, IMO.  I am in love with this soup!  It is really filling.

Need to make sure to make the tortillas really fine.  Mine turned out too thick, I also added more poblanos because it did not have enough flavor. I topped w/ some avocado, cilantro, lime, & black olives which seemed to help. It was actually better the second day.

I'd give it 3.5 if I could. It was good enough but just didn't do it for us.  I was a little turned off by the aroma but the taste was good. I had to double the recipe to get 5 1.5C servings. After eating a bowl, we agreed that it would benefit from more chicken or something. It reminded me of a creamy casserole without the "stuff".  I would use some ideas from it again but probably not remake it as written.

I really loved the flavor of this soup. I think the name is misleading because the cheese is simply a garnish, not a main ingredient. Of course, that was instantly evident from reading the recipe and I decided to go ahead. I liked the corn tortillas as the thickening agent and I decided to roast my poblano to add a depth of flavor. Based on most of the reviews, I added more chicken stock, but otherwise kept the ingredient amounts the same. This was made to go with chicken fajitas, so I didn't add the chicken either. I will definitely make this again.

This is a very good soup, but there are definitely a couple of problems with the recipe. First, the recipe has the word "Cheesy" in the title, but cheese is only used to garnish the soup. If you truly believe that this recipe makes nine servings, then you would have less than 1 TBS of cheese per serving. I added the half cup cheese to the soup and mixed in before serving, then I added more as a garnish. I used roasted poblanos as my garnish, as raw peppers are not my husband's favorite.  For the tortilla garnish, I sprayed the strips with cooking spray and sprinkled them with homemade taco seasoning before oven toasting. I did have to add a good bit of extra liquid to this recipe.

I love this soup, but the servings are WAY off!  I halved the recipe (for 2 people) and we didn't even get a full bowl each.  Great soup though... Only change was that I added about 1/2 cup chicken to the halved recipe.

This soup is really good, like the others I did add more chicken stock to lessen the thickness. My daughters loved it! Will make it again.

It wasn't worth the expense to make this soup. If you do decide to make it don't change the "Servings" otherwise the recipe doesn't make enough to serve. Did not have enough flavor and turned out too thick-I had to add more broth, seasoning and half/half to thin it out.

Really good! But not nine servings at all, three at most! I used milk instead of half -n-half, added cheese to soup as well as sprinkling on top. Will make again!

I enjoyed the flavor of this soup. First bite in and it instantly reminded me of a favorite childhood casserole (King Ranch Chicken) I had growing up. My only complaint is that it is NOWHERE near 9 servings; not even if was served in tiny cups. I ended up doubleing the recipe and it made 4 lunch size servings. The flavor is really great and I intend on making this often.

I doubled this recipe and it made enough for my husband and I to have lunches for three days.  Next time I will make four times what it calls for.  I used 1% milk instead of the half and half.  Also, I pureed the soup once it was done to make it less chunky.  We omitted the chicken.  It is just wonderful!!!

The title makes this sound like something other what it is, which is regular tortilla soup with cream. It's pretty good, I reduced the amount of half & half to save on calories but otherwise followed the directions.  As so many others have pointed out, this is not 9 servings, it's 2!  I roasted my peppers and removed the charred skin before chopping and adding to the soup.  Very tasty and might make again, but with less cumin.

I had to make a couple of adjustments due to what I had on hand. I didn't have half and half so I used milk and a little sour cream. I made it with a can of chicken that needed using; it was ok, but shredded chicken breast would be better. I topped the soup with a slice of Monterey Jack and a slice of Swiss, then broiled til bubbly. I then added the diced peppers, tortilla strips and some fresh cilantro. Good stuff. Thanks!

I have made this recipe many times and love it! I do make a few changes to make it more my own. First, I always at least double it. The recipe as is doesn't make very much when you are feeding 3 hungry adults. Second, I add way more chicken then it calls for to make it more of a meal. I usually use 2 chicken breast in a double batch. Third, I add roasted corn. It complements the other flavors well. And last, I melt some cheese into the soup at the end instead of just topping with cheese. Then I top it with some avocado, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips. So good!

Because so many reviewers mentioned the soup was too thick, I put in 4 cups of chicken stock, now it's too thin!  As it is, the soup is good but bland.  I put in 4 fire roasted, garden grown poblanos, and fire roasted corn.  It definately needs a litte more chili spice. Pretty simple to make also.
