This recipe was bland.  On top of that, the seed holes in the avocados aren't big enough to put much chicken in.  However, with a few tweaks, I would rate it 5 stars.  Here's what I did:  Used one large can of chicken, added more chili powder, plus a few good sprinkles of cumin, garlic and sea salt.  Then, I sliced two avocados, lay them flat on plates, and mounded the chicken on top of the slices.  this made a perfect lunch for two people.

The buttery avocado bowl came together with the chicken, cilantro, chili powder and lime to make the perfect nutritional meal. Be sure to keep the chicken moist so you don't have dry tasting chicken. This would work as well with leftover turkey or by adding diced onions.

These were delicious. I used store-bought baked chicken instead of canned but otherwise followed the recipe. This was a quick and flavorful dinner when I was staying in a hotel. It saved me from having to eat out and made for easy clean up! Thanks Kyleeann for sharing this great idea.

Surprised no one else mentioned this, but I scooped out the avocado from the skins, chopped it and added to the other ingredients, along with some fresh garlic & salt, then piled it back into the empty skins.  Looked good & tasted great!

Loved this!  Used left over chicken breast and added cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper and a little lime juice (to add some moisture) to the chicken mixture. Wondering how it would have been with a little dollop of sour cream on top.

I was worried the chicken would be bland, so I added some garlic salt and cumin like others suggested. You do have to make a heaping pile of the mixture in the avocado, but wow! This was great and so easy to make! I served it with a side of black beans. Super health meal. I will defininitely make again!

I really liked this lunch idea, the one thing I added was some mayo to the chicken and it was bomb, if you take some tostada chips and dip it - it's also pretty darn good

This was a great healthy dinner. I made it with chicken breast (vs. canned), chopped the avocado to make it easier to eat, added cut asparagus and served with a warm tortilla. The tortilla was a little too thin, but a flat bread might work better.

We loved how quick and easy this was! We used a rotisserie chicken from the store and it was a bit dry. It made the recipe even easier, but we needed a way to moisten the meat a bit more. The lime juice really helped the flavors pop!

Used 2 10 oz cans of oven roasted chicken, added little cumin and salt, and the juice of one whole lime to the chili powder. Easy and delicious lunch

I give it 4 starts with my modifications-Instead of using canned chicken,  I used roasted chicken from the store.  Still a time saver as the chicken is already cooked, but much better than canned meat.  Even my 6 year old liked this recipe!  I added more seasonings (like taco seasonings) to tasted, also.  I also would double or triple the recipe for any more than 2-3 people.

Tasty and healthy for a lunch! I found the recommended amount of chili powder wasn't enough. As well, only good for leftovers the next day, because of the browning of the avocado! Would definitely make this again.

Definitely use rotisserie chicken that you grab from Costco or elsewhere. Absolutely amazing meal my family devoured and asked to have once a week. It is NOT bland if you add enough chili powder and cilantro. Use the recipe as a guide only. I did drizzle olive oil into the mixture to help the favors blend and to keep the chicken moist. This dish was PERFECT. And, the mixture DOES scoop into and onto the avocado half for a beautiful presentation (the reviewer who said it didn’t must have had very tiny avocados because mine were not large). Each family member ate at least 2 halves... served with homemade Spanish rice made by another recipe on here called “perfect Spanish rice” I believe. Awesome dinner!

I read the reviews and made the following changes:
added cumin and garlic powder as well as the chili powder; chopped a green onion and a tablespoon of cilantro and added that in; added a tablespoon of sour cream and juiced half a lime to moisten it. Also sliced avocado and arranged on plate to facilitate eating. Husband and I both loved it!  Will make again!

LOVED IT!  I used frozen diced chicken, thawed of course. I diced the avocado, skipped the cilantro only because I didn't have any. I used a homemade chili powder that included red pepper flakes. After thawing the chicken, I cut into smaller bits, sprinkled with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and chili powder. I added the avocado, lime juice, chipotle hot sauce, and sliced black olives. Mix together. Can be served with tortilla chips or just eat the way it is.

Nice.  1st time I made it I felt it wasn't anything special.  However, my 82 year old mother loved it.  I added salt and garlic powder to the chicken after trying the recipe as is. The additions made it 4 stars then.  Good base  recipe however.

I was a little worried about this being flavorless, but even without the cilantro (I did not have any at home) it was so good.  My husband said this would become a weekly weekday meal.  Loved it.
