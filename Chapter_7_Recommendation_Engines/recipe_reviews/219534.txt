this was good.  we added 1/4 cup of cream cheese for a little more flavor (we love cheese)-but we did not need to.

This could be a foundation recipe.  As prescribed, it was bland.  I did the recipe without changes. The reviewer that added cream cheese, that would be a good call.  Maybe I'll try that, with some chili powder, mexican oregano, and diced tomatoes, next time.  Could use some shredded cheddar as a topping, too.

Very easy to put together. I added 1 fresh tomato, 1 green pepper, 3 cloves garlic and grated cheddar over the top in the pan. Put lid on for a couple of minutes to melt cheese. Added oregano and cumin as spices. Nice to know if I didn't have these extras I could put together in a snap

I made this for the first time when I needed something quickly at the last minute. My family loved it!  My husband kept raving about it, as did my kids. I added another 1/2 cup of salsa because I was using thick and chunky salsa, and it coated the pasta nicely. It's nice to know that I can whip this up and it will be a hit!
