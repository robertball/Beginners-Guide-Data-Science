Very tasty!  I'm not used to tuna in my deviled eggs, but it turned out well!

This looks really good. I put eggs in my tuna, so this is a reversal. I made these and they were very good. I did not have regular yellow mustard, so had to use dijon, but I do not think it probably changed the flavor much. I will definitely make these again and also serve to guests and family at gatherings. For decoration, you could put small goldfish crackers around the serving tray. Memorial Day is coming up very shortly, and these tuna stuffed eggs will be on my menu list for sure. Thank you Figueroas for sharing this recipe.

I rather enjoy tuna fish (when prepared how I like it) and I LOVE eggs. Scrambled, deviled, sunny side up, doesn't matter. So this recipe seemed like something I would absolutely love, but sadly I was disappointed. Not much flavor. These taste more like tuna than deviled eggs. To be honest I really couldn't taste much egg. If someone had served the mixture to me without telling me there was egg in it, I probably would've never known. I'm sure there are people out there who love tuna the way that I love eggs so this may be perfect for those people, but this recipe just wasn't for me. In the future I MAY attempt this one again only with half the tuna. It has potential.
