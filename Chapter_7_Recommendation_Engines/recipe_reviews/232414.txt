We really liked these little sandwiches.  The layers of pineapple cream cheese and the use of poppy seed dressing mixed into the chicken (instead of mayo) really added layers of flavor.  The only thing that I would do differently the next time is to open the rolls and brown them under the broiler briefly before assembling.  Would be very nice for brunch, a buffet, a reception, or a shower.  Terrific combination of flavors, and they look rather elegant!

I call these chick burgers.   My missus and my daughters loved these, and so did I.   I had to create my own pineapple cream cheese, but that turned out good.   I served on fresh buns.   YUM.

Had to do a little  tweaking on this (I'm lactose intolerant . I used mayo. instead of the poppy seed dressing, did not use cream cheese used orange marmalade, it went real well with the strawberries. Enjoyed this very much. Thanks HotGrandma.

Great for those that love chicken but not mayonnaise!  These are delicious and prep was really easy. I did not use the Hawaiian sweet rolls.  We LOVE our chicken salad on croissants.  These were served to company on Christmas Eve.  These will be even better for Mother's Day or July 4th.

Loved, loved, loved this sandwich! Very gourmet tasting. Used plain cream cheese because that's what I had, but can't wait to try it with the pineapple cream cheese. Will be a regular in my house. Thanks for sharing.

Loved these and so easy!  Wasn't sure I wanted to use the strawberries but glad I did!   They added to the flavor of the sandwich.  Great for a girls get together or luncheon. Thanks for posting this simple but delicious recipe!

Everyone in the family liked this. I could not find the pineapple cream cheese so I subbed strawberry. The only thing I would change is to chop the chicken finer so it did not fall off the rolls so easily. Very good! A crowd pleaser that will be made again.

The husband and the baby really liked this, but I was pretty neutral. I think it would be better on a heartier bread, or made with tenderloins onto a sandwich. It was hard to get enough meat into each bite to satisfy quickly enough and resulted in a lot of bread consumption, which is not what I was looking for in this meal. The flavor was good, largely dependent upon the poppyseed dressing, so try to find one you know you like, or make your own and adjust to taste. My DH took an entire row of rolls and slit it down the side and turned this into some sort of weird submarine sandwich made mostly of Hawaiian bread, and I wish I'd gotten a photo of that because I think it would've tickled HotGrandma to see it! Thanks for sharing.

My picky teenage son said he would only try a bite but ate the whole thing.  I took the readers suggestions and used sweet full size buns toasted, shredded and chopped the chicken which stayed on the bun well.  Made the pineapple cream cheese and made the dressing.  Do feel that a making an easy dressing gives it the pop vs a flavor lacking store bought variety.  Will save recipe and make again!!!

the taste of this chicken salad was a hit, delish!  However, I recommend you shred the chicken first, do Not cube it. Making tea sandwiches the chunks just fall off the bread, making for a messy handling

Loved this chicken salad variation.  I omitted the green onions and just used mini slider buns.   Very fresh and great flavor combinations.   I used Marzetti poppyseed dressing.  I didn't have any trouble finding the cream cheese--I bought the Philadelphia brand and was located where all the flavored cream cheeses are.   Will definitely make this over and over again.

This is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten.  I served it to company and they agreed and raved on it.  I added walnuts (just because I love nuts) and it was super quick and easy.  I couldn't find pineapple cream cheese so made my own by buying a tub of regular cream cheese spread and adding a small can of crushed pineapple.  It was DELICIOUS !!!  You have to try it to believe it, the poppy seed dressing was so much better than mayonnaise.
