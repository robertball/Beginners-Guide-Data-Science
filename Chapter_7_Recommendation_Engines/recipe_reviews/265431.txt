6.9.18  I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts (what I had on hand), otherwise, followed the recipe .  The magic happens when you cook down the sauce, it just gets lemon-y and super delicious.  Sooooo easy and sooooo good, thanks Lillian’s Kitchen for sharing your recipe, this one’s a keeper, for sure!

I made this for my family of four, including two children. Everyone loved it! We served it over pasta shells and with a side of sauteed green beans. I will definitely make this again.

Also, I followed the recipe as written. I used two large chicken breasts that I then cut in half for four thinner filets.

A keeper for certain! I did add a clove of garlic and next time will add fresh basil to garnish and further flavor the chicken. No additional seasonings needed if you are using a full salt chicken broth. Light lemony and yummy!

This was so  tasty and easy to make, I wish it would have produced more gravy, as it was just enough for three servings. I wanted more, more, and more gravy!  I am always trying to find tasty ways to make chicken and this is what we eat most. I made mine in my old faithful cast iron skillet so it made a nice crust on the chicken.  I served it over Cheese tortellini's with a side of green beans and salad. I'm definitely going to make this again

Good flavor and easy. If I made again, I will not cover the skillet at all during cooking. The chicken was tough, and I am pretty sure covering the pan was the cause.

I didn't bother to flatten the breasts and just cooked them longer.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it's delicious!

Easy enough recipe for a weeknight but it was far too acidic for us. Hubs, who will eat just about anything , didn't care for this. I added 1 tsp of unpasteurized honey to the liquid, after tasting,  and that balanced the recipe.

Such a great recipe! Quick and easy followed the recipe except I used frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts (what I had) cut into strips and added lemon pepper so so good:) I paired it with rice pilaf and sautéed asparagus

I made this last night with a couple minor changes.  I added 1/4 tsp salt and 12 rounds of fresh ground pepper to the flour before I tossed the chicken in it.  My family absolutely loved this dish, even my very picky 17-year-old.   I served it with just a tossed salad and everyone was happy on a hot summer evening.

The lemon and basil flavours make this chicken dish dance in your mouth. Juicy chicken, with a wonderful refreshing aftertaste is a winner.

I really thought I'd like this, but even my not fussy husband said it was just ok.  The chicken was tender and the sauce reduced nicely, still it seemed to be missing something, though we couldn't figure out what.  Not sure what I'd add, but until I figure that out, I'm not likely to make this again as we have other chicken recipes we  really enjoy.
