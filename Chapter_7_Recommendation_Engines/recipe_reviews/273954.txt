6.819  Made as written with the exception of using fresh chives.  Found the flavor just a bit weak, so I did add more garlic powder and dill (personal taste).  To really maximize flavor, do allow time for the dressing to sit in the fridge for the flavors to meld.  I like the simplicity of this recipe and the fact that I always have all ingredients on hand.  Enjoyed as a side salad to Zucchini Pizza Bake on this site.  Will be making this one again.
