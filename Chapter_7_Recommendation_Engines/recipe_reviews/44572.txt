Excellent!  But I chop the shrimp large, not small.

I couldn't find those herbs fresh, so I just added about a tbsp of each herb dried to the wine/oil mix, and used it as a dressing for the romaine/spinach combo.  I also just cut each shrimp in half, because I love big bites of shrimp.  The sauce was missing something, but I'm not sure what.

Followed the recipe precisely.  VERY bitter.  I think it was due to the fresh herbs.  Had to add sugar to make it edible.  Is definitely missing something.  Won't be making this one again.

I did a reduction of the beer first and omitted the flour.  Excellent flavors.  I only had red onion, but this was really yummy, will make this again!
