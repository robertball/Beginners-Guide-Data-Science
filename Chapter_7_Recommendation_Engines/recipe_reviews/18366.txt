Easy, excellent and refreshing summer dessert!  Please note that whipped topping comes in 8 oz. or 16 oz. containers - at least in my area.  I made the mistake of only buying an 8 oz. container and the topping was too stiff and difficult to spread.  I didn't pay close attention to the recipe.  Next time I will add TWO 8 oz. containers (or ONE 16 oz) and it should be perfecto!  I also think a touch of vanilla would be great.  I took it to a Labor Day party and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!   The second time around, I made the crust out of vanilla wafers, ground nuts, and confectioners sugar mixture (see the Cocoa Rum Balls recipe on this site).  I didn't add the cocoa.  It was so delicious and the nuts complemented the bananas perfectly.  Try it!

This was extremely simple to make and was a big hit. Everyone went for seconds! The pudding takes on the flavor of the bananas and it was just fabulous!

I used light whipped topping, sugar free CHEESECAKE pudding mix and reduced fat sour cream. This turned out so good! So simple and just really good. We loved it.

For a change, I added 1 8 oz. can of WELL DRAINED Crushed Pineapple to the "top layer" mixture of pudding, sour cream and whipped topping ...
In the past, I've also substituted the Graham Cracker Crust with a Toasted Coconut Crust for a real tropical treat ...

EVERYONE LOVED THIS.  I WAS SHORT ON TIME AND ENDED UP USING REAL WHIPPED CREAM...TASTED GREAT. ALSO I NEEDED 2 PUDDING MIXES (MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE WHIPPED CREAM--1 VANILLA 1 BANANA) I TOPPED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND TOASTED COCONUT.  I THINK THIS WOULD BE GOOD WITH MANDARAIN ORANGES AND PINEAPPLE TOO.  THANKS, I LOVE IT.

This recipe is a good one!!  This is a dessert I always make and everyone always loves.  It's not too rich, it's just right!!  What I do to make it even better is to add more graham cracker crumbs to the top of the pie (plus it makes it prettier) -- it tastes wonderful!!  Or you could even add a little pecan if you like nuts!!

I got rave reviews over this one!  Excelent flavor and lovely fluffy consistency!  My only difference to the recipe is that I'm lazy and bought a premade pie crust rather than make my own..lol

This is now a family favorite!  My mom requested Banana Cream pie for her birthday, and after seeing how easy this would be to whip up, I decided to make it!  I doubled the recipe and used one vanilla and one banana jello.  I also added two packages of cream cheese which made it AMAZING!  I have had multiple requests for the recipe and made it several more times for family gatherings.  Definitely a favorite!

Mmmm..mmmm good! Son in law won't let me come to potlucks with out this pie now. I used banana pudding instead of vanilla which I think gave it a little more pizazz...and I topped the pie with a layer of Cool Whip. Got rave reviews from all!

Not enough filling for the cake. Filling is difficult to spread over the graham crackers layer, sticking to it and ending up looking messy.

I used my own recipe for the crust: 1/3 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs (used chocolate graham crackers) and I baked it for 5 minutes.

Amazing recipe! The only thing I did differently was bake the crust, which I prefered. I took this to a family event and everyone was dying to know the recipe! Thanks...it's a keeper!

The cream part was ok, but the "crust" part was awful! It stuck to the pan, got VERY hard and was way too sweet. In my opinion, the extra sugar wasn't needed. My kids couldn't wait to eat this, but when the time came, they took 1 bite and said "thanks mom, but no thanks".

I am eating this at this very moment. This is a wonderful delightfully quick dessert. The vanilla totally compliments the banana. All the flavors just melted together. It's so creamy and fluffy. I did two layers of bananas to make sure I could really get the texture of the bananas.I also cheated and used a prepared crust. This is definitely a keeper. Love it!!!

We make banana pudding often so I figured this would be a little different but basically the same flavor.  My conclusion is that instant vanilla pudding isn't very good (we usually use the cook and serve)!  I'm sure I'll make this again in the future only with the cook and serve pudding instead.

Just amazing!  I made this in under 6 minutes.  I had baked two pie crusts and needed a quick recipe to utilize the remaining crust.  I came across this recipe and had everything on hand so I went for it.  I'm so glad I did.  I turns out that everyone raved over this instead of the strawberry pie.  Next time I'll try it with the Graham Cracker crust.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thank you MISSMOLLY!

This was featured back in the day as a Pampered Chef recipe, you made it in a springform pan. My whole family has always loved this recipe and I follow it exactly, except for maybe thinning the filling down a little bit with cream or milk. I also want to add that the homemade crust with real butter is on here for a reason, it makes it a Superstar dessert. I have made this both with real whipped cream and with Cool Whip or other whipped toppings, it tastes the same either way so don't be a Cool Whip snob!

My family cannot get enough of this!  It is so easy to make, and can be very healthy with the following changes:  use low fat ghram crackers, light butter, splenda, light sour cream and whip cream, sugar and fat free pudding.  Even with all the light products it still tastes great.  I didn't tell my hubby and son that it was light, they can't even tell.

Easy,  fast and tasty. I made individual puddings since there were only 2 of us for dinner. I layered with crunchy topping and bananas in the dish. Will make it again for company.

Did not care for this at all. The filling had a disagreeable texture and was way to rich and sweet, Plain old graham cracker crust, bananas, and vanilla pudding will do me much better. I'm surprised I didn't like it as all the rest of "Allrecipes" I've tried were great.

This was an excellent dessert! I made it for an Easter brunch and it was a HUGE hit. Preparation is very easy. I mixed the cream cheese and whipped topping together by hand however next time I may try the Kitchen Aid mixer in an attempt to make the mixture a bit more light and fluffy. Regardless, this was VERY tasty!

SO easy and SO good! I don't usually cut corners, but this time I did....I put the filling into a premade graham crust. I whipped up some heavy cream with vanilla extract and some confectioners sugar to put some around the edges of the pie and I put some mixed, chopped nuts on the whipped dollops. Since this is SO quick to make.....I will surely be making it again!

I didn't have any bananas on hand, so instead I put the entire amount of the pudding in the pie shell without the layer of bananas, and toasted some coconut to sprinkle on top.  Turned out really yummy, since I left out the bananas I couldn't be completely fair with the rating so I gave it a 4, but tasted like a 5.  Thanks for the recipe.

Simple and tasty. Used ground Vanilla Wafers and saltines for crust because we had no graham crackers. Cooked crust @325 while preparing the filling. Omitted nuts. Will make again. This out of 3 in my houe enjoyed this recipe a lot.

This is everything I was hoping it would be. I was looking for a whipped texture, but simultaneously slightly richer flavor than regular banana cream pie. Everyone at the party went back for seconds, and I had a tough time not going back for thirds! My go to from now on.

Oh, I like this a lot.  I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and I apologize for reviewing when I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I couldn't resist saying THIS IS GOOD.

Liked it but with a few changes. Mixing the dry pudding mix with whipped topping and sour cream left a gritty mixture so I added a little milk to the pudding mix which helped it combine.  I also used one vanilla pudding mix and half a banana pudding mix for more banana flavor. I also topped with True Whip for a separate flavor layer.

Great easy refreshing dessert. I recommend doubling the pudding mixture. There's wasn't enough for two layers.

My family loved it! It was gone before everyone could try it so I had to make another. Originally I only had banana pudding but it still worked wonders. I put the banana's in two layer's between the filling as well but it was a hit to be around for many occasions.

Wonderful recipe! I follow the ingredients exactly and it turn out great. I added sliced almonds on top to give it some crunch. And i chilled it overnight. I wanted to make this pie big enough for my family so I added an extra layer of bananas. I would totally make this again in the near future. Reason I only gave this 4 stars is because once I took it out of the fridge it melted pretty quick. So eat it right away once it's ready to be serve. ??

This was excellent.  I served it at our game night and it was a hit.  The only thing I did different was sprinkle some sliced almonds on top.  I felt it was missing.

May I say that this pie is so easy to make and so good! I tweeked it a little, by adding a cup of mashed banana's, used lite sour cream, fat free whipped topping and sugar free vanilla pudding mix. Very good!

I used a store bought graham cracker pie crust, and light sour cream, 3/4 of a 16oz container of cool whip and brought it to the office. It got rave reviews! Only suggestion I was given by a coworkers teenage son (which I found useful) is instead of just slicing the bananas cut them twice into fours for bite size pieces! DELICIOUS!

Wonderful!!! I made a Graham cracker crust, chilled it, then brushed on some melted chocolate.  Then made the filling with whipped cream (I didn't have frozen topping), 1/2 cup sour cream, and a pkg of banana pudding. I layered the filling with fresh banana slices and topped it with the remaining whipped cream (piped on with a large star tip). Sprinkled with mini chocolate chips, it was sooo good!

One of the best Banana Cream Pies I've ever tasted. I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the graham cracker crumbs and sugar before adding the butter. Yummy. I also added a container of Marscapone cheese to the pudding mixture as well as 2 ripe bananas and about 1/4 cup shredded coconut. Very creamy and flavorful. I garnished it with fresh bananas and coconut on top and a sprinkle of chopped hazelnuts. 

The added Marscapone cheese and bananas made it so that it didn't set up like a pie should so the next time I make it I'll do individual servings so it's more like a pudding. The other option is to freeze it before serving so that you can slice it and serve it before it thaws. It received rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy, especially when you use a prepared crust like I did.  I don't know that I'd want it all the time, but it tastes good for a change.  It didn't firm up at all in the fridge like I had expected/hoped, so it's really tough to get that first piece out without making a huge mess.  It would also be good with nuts or pineapple chunks.

I love this recipe! I do alter a few ingredients, but I follow just the same. I've made several times and the family just loves it. Very tasty, and has a wonderful creamy texture. My kids really enjoy it because bananas are about the only fruit they really like. This is a keeper!!

This recipe was easy to fix & a real crowd pleaser! I did bake my crust for 5 min. & added chopped walnuts to the banana layer & the top for decoration. I used 2 8oz cool-whip containers, one french vanilla & one regular. I also used banana pudding instead of vanilla. Some folks were calling it a slush cake, all I know is that it was very good!! Thanks for sharing this one!!

Perfect if you need something yummy and impressive if you are short on time!  I whipped this up in about 5 minutes, and had it chilling in the fridge while we made and had dinner.  Around dessert time, it was totally set, and tasted fantastic!  I made the following changes. 1) I used a store-bought graham cracker pie crust...worked great! 2) I used banana creme flavor instant pudding.  I thought it might possibly be an overpowering banana flavor, but it was PERFECT.  3)I only used two bananas since there wasn't much "surface area" in the pie shell.  Worked great. 4) I had some cool whip in the freezer, but didn't have the 4 hours to let it thaw. I actually used the new aerosol cool whip, and it worked great (and I wasn't sure that it would)!  5) Lastly, I used light sour cream, and it tasted great.  You can't tell the difference.  Thanks so much for such an easy, delicious recipe!

I had to read the recipe several times to be sure it was not supposed to include milk, which seemed like a missing ingredient (it's not).  I expected a creamier banana cream pie, with a custard filling and bananas.  Like other reviewers, I made this in a premade graham pie crust, and I'm not sure the filling would have filled a 9x13 inch pan.  The filling tastes a lot more like Cool Whip than like vanilla or sour cream.  This was tasty, but will not become a favorite in my recipe box.

This filling is wonderful and so easy!  You can add variety by changing the crust- graham cracker, traditional pie crust, oreo crust, etc.  It works well in a deep-dish 9 inch pie plate too.
