I used nectarines in place of the peaches only because they were on sale this week. I also used nonfat plain greek yogurt in this recipe. My kids and I loved this fruit salad--it was simple and delicious. NO leftovers.

This was nice but not really special. Basically it was just fruit with orange flavoured yoghurt on top. Good for breakfast / brunch or a light dessert.

I really liked this.  I made it for my son's summer birthday party and it was a hit.

What's not to like here?  I did use 2% Greek-style yogurt and all beautiful and fresh fruits!  I'd say this is as good as the fruit you use.  I hadn't thought of using orange juice concentrate in yogurt like this.  Nice and easy!  Thanks!

Love fruit salad. The orange juice concentrate was a nice addition to the yogurt. I had stopped at the local fruit stand in the morning and went a little overboard on what I bought so I ended up using a lot of different fruits than what was called for. Cherries, peaches, strawberries, blackberries, cantaloupe and more. But it was all fruit so it worked :)
