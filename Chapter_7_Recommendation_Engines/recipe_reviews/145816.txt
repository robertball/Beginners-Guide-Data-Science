This was a really good yet dense bread. I think mine was denser because i used spelt instead of white flour. It was bread thaat ate like a meal.

Not sure what went wrong, mommyjo - this bread turned out great. I used 4 Quaker Muffets for the cereal, and used 1 cup rye and 4 cups whole wheat flour. It baked up perfectly in 50 minutes. The loaves are dense but not overly dense and have a nice crust. Wonderful! I will make this again.

I made this bread according to the recipe and it was so dense that the outside cooked but the inside didn't.  It also didn't rise at all after I split it into the two pans, maybe this is why.

I make a lot of bread and really loved this one. I placed the shredded wheat in the KA bowl, waited the recommended 15 minutes. I used the dough hook to knead everything. I let the dough hook do the work for 10 minutes, the dough will ride up on the hook so I had to stop the mixer and push it back down. I then wiped out the bowl and lightly greased it with olive oil and put the dough back in. In exactly one hour the dough had doubled in size. I then put it on a floured counter, cut in half and put it on two prepared loaf pans, I sprinkled the bottom of the pans with corn meal. I made two small changes as I only had 1/4 cup of ground flax seed. I added two Tbs of vital wheat gluten and oat bran to measure 1/2 cup. Yes, the dough was very sticky but from past experience I know that this makes very moist bread. The cooking time was a bit off, it was done in 40 minutes. I will be making this one again. Thanks Abrux.

Very nice, flavorful bread.  My visiting family members loved the taste; it has a sweetness from the molasses and a graininess from the variety of flours and the cereal that makes for a nice little taste.  I made the dough in the bread machine, finished off in the oven, and did not have shredded wheat cereal so just used Grape Nuts.  If I ever have Shredded Wheat, I'll try that next time.  Overall, though, this was a lovely bread.  I made rolls and a free form loaf that turned out well.  Thanks for the recipe.
