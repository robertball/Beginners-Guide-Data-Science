Have been making this for every brunch I do for years.  Absolutely love it.  I usually double the sausage when making for men's groups.  I'm not one who measures well, but just and fyi - the chilis are not hot.  If the tomatoes are not good (off season), I let them add salsa to the top with sour cream and spicy peppers that are pickled.

Whoa, 4 cans of green chiles?  Maybe I'll get up the courage to try it that way in the future.  For the 1st time making it, I used 2 cans of drained Rotel tomatoes as datharp1 suggested, also adding part of the drained juice.  I like my breakfast casseroles with potatoes, so subbed 2 thin layers of frozen cubed potatoes for the tortillas.  It turned out pretty good, slightly spicy.  Will make it again.  Thanks for a new take on breakfast/egg casseroles.

I made this casserole for Christmas brunch and my family loved it. I substituted two cans of Rotel tomatoes drained instead of the green chilies and used half cheddar and Monterrey Jack cheese.

It was a big hit with my family (3 teenage boys and hubby), they all went in for seconds.  Delicious.  I did make a couple changes,  I added chorizo with the sausage, used only 2 cans of green chiles instead of 4, and I didn't have tomatoes so I spread salsa over the top instead.  I will definitely be making it again.

Just a general comment, AR's casserole recipes are generally way too large. Cut all ingredients by half and the results are about the correct size for a family of four.

You can change the type of sausage used to make this as the recipe calls for a sage sausage, but you can use regular Italian (hot or sweet) or Chorizo

Used chicken sausage, a high fiber tortilla and some lite Mexican blend cheese. This was very good... liked the use of tortillas instead of bread or potatoes
