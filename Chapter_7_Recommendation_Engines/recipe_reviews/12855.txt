This recipe was fabulous!  I cooked it on the grill, instead of in a skillet and served it on a bed of linguine in a garlic butter sauce.  The subtlty of the linguine balanced well with the boldness of the snapper.

I have been looking for a seasoning mix to use for blackened fish and chicken.  This was really easy and the snapper was great!  I also put the spice mix in my steamed cauliflower and it was wonderful, too.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was pretty good.  I used it on fresh Tilapia fillets since I couldn't find red snapper.  Using a cast iron skillet works great.

I cooked this tonight.  My husband and I were not pleased with it.  It tasted plain, didn't have any flavor, except burn taste.  I would recommend you to sprinkle some salt while the fish still hot from the skillet.  It might taste better with added salt.  I would not make this again.

Keeping Hubs' sensitive innards in mind, I cut back significantly on the cayenne pepper, to only 1/2 tsp., which worked out well. I used smoked paprika, but I'm sure sweet paprika would be equally as good.  Not wanting the odor, smoke and grease in the house, we do use the cast iron pan, but we get it screamin' hot on the outdoor charcoal grill. What was different for me with this recipe was the seasoning.  I use one consistently that we particularly enjoy, but we were pleased with this for something a little different.

It was excellent!!  My husband doesn't really like fish, but he raves about this recipe.  We're from and still live in New Orleans, so we're used to spice.  I must say that this recipe has a little too much pepper, but other than that, it is great!

I have used the spice blend in this recipe for years - professionally as a caterer and at home. It is beyond awesome on wings, as a general veggie seasoning, steak, whatever.  I usually cut the cayenne down to a quarter of the amount called for and make a triple batch to keep on hand.

Well, I made this recipe with tuna steaks instead of snapper. But it still turned out great. I also used canola oil instead of butter. But I did sear the tuna in a raging cast iron skillet with the cajun spices, so I really am quallfied to give this review! What I'm trying to say is, this is good fish!

This was very good and it was fun to cook!  I took the iron skillet on the outdoor grill route as my smoke alarm is very unforgiving.  I would agree to take it easy on the salt.  I also used olive oil instead of butter for dietary reasons.  Just delicious!

Extremely flavorful.  I ended up using white snapper as well, and made a sweet spinach salad to compliment the strong flavors of the fish.

I have never cooked at such high temperatures on my stove before.  Maybe it was my inexperience, but this was a disaster!!!  I got my skillet nice and hot on a high setting like the recipe called for, expecting to make a delicious dinner for my husband and as soon as the fish hit the skillet, it went up in flames!  Cajun Style Blackened Snapper fail! :(

OK.....I actually made this fish 3 times in one night.  When you have teenagers you fix dinner in shifts.  And then when people dropped in unannounced I just put more in the pan.  Every single person said it was the best blackened fish they had ever had.  I cut way back on the butter by just brushing it on the fish with a pastry brush and then dipped each filet in seasoning.  Tasted  wonderful.  Thank you

This recipe was a nice change for a fish dish. We're kind of weenies when it comes to spicy dishes, so I cut the cayenne pepper in half and added some Old Bay seasoning, and it was wonderful! My husband likes it and he rarely eats spicy food. Great recipe and thanks for sharing- will definitely make again!

We enjoyed the flavor of this one, but watch out for the smoke!  Next time, I will definitely cook this recipe outside on the grill burner!  My guests thought the house was on fire!

This recipe has just been added to my son's list of favorites (I made his snapper first with a little less cuyanne pepper), I really really making it.  I loved that a picture was with the recipe and I saw that snapper was place on top of tomatoe slices, what a wonderful taste and it made it look all the better.  Thank YOU Sandra!

This is an excellent recipe.  Very flavorful and SPICY.  I cut the amount of all the peppers in half and it was still quite spicy even for me being of Mexican decent and quite used to using various hot chiles in food preparations.  The family really enjoyed it though.  I will be making it regularly.

This is a great entry. I live in Australia now and miss some of this good ol' down home cooking.  One hint that I picked off from a very famous restaurant in 'NarLeans is to heat the cast iron skillet to a very very high heat.  When the butter goes over the top of the blackening fillets, it should flame for a second.  Not for the faint but lots of fun.

Thanks again.  Steve

great way to make fish.  I make the spice up in advance and have a whole batch ready for anytime, makes dinner preparation so much faster.

Easy. Yummy. Fast. And if you don't use a cast iron skillet, make sure to heat the pan for a good long time so it's hot enough.

I made this a few nights ago, and it definitely has potential.  I made some changes to it.  I wasn't sure why there was a need for so much butter.  I ended up coating the fillets in butter, then covering them with the cajun seasoning.  Once in the pan, I drizzeled some more butter.  But, in the end, I only ended up using about 3 tbs. of butter.  And, the fillets came out really tender.  Also, after blackening the fillets and cooking them through, my husband and I thought there was way too much seasoning.  So, we scraped it all off.  There was still a lot of the cajun taste because it got cooked in.  Next time I make it, I will still follow the recipe (minus all the butter) knowing that I will end up scraping the seasoning off, since I think that it helped make the fish really tender and tasty.  Oh, I also neded up slow cooking the snapper on a lower flame.  Another thing that I think made it tender.  I did initially place it on a high flame so it would blacken the seasoning.  But, once that was done, I lowered it to a low-med heat and cooked it for about 10 more minutes.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. It is very spicy, but it is a flavorful spicy. As mentioned in other reviews, it does really smoke up the house. Next time I'll try this one outside.

This was very easy and very tasty.  I highly recommend it.  I do recommend cooking on medium heat instead of high heat. If you like it hotter thaen just add more cayenne pepper. I am going to use it on Tilapia as well.

I hate to be the first one to say this, but I really didn't enjoy this dish at all.  I have had blackened fish on several occasions and this did not have the same flavor. I would say that I won't be making this again.

Excellent.  Have your exhaust on high when you put in the first fillet.  My family has requested that I make this again.  Next time, I will leave out the salt.

Excellent recipe. I altered it just a little bit but it still came out perfect. Instead of paprika, cayenne and salt I used a couple tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning which has some of those ingredients minus the cayenne. Everything else I had and used. I just didn't want it too spicy for the kids. It was absolutely delicious.

Excellent recipe.  I used my cast iron skillet and it came out perfectly!  I recommend using a butter/oil blend to fry, as butter has a lower browning temperature, and aids in the blackening process.

If you're using hot paprika, you might want to cut down to 1 tbsp instead of 2. I used the full 2 tbsp and it was so hot, it was almost inedible. I had to mix with mayo to cool down the spice. It smelled sooo good when it was cooking though!

Used this recipe with amberjack (thought I had snapper on hand but was wrong).  I didn't want the mess/smell in the kitchen, so we grilled it.  For those who thought this was not flavorful enough, I wonder if they did not coat with the herb/spice mixture enough.  I smothered the fillets in the spices, then we made a little tray out of foil for the grill and did just like the instructions say for the skillet.  This was absolutely KILLER!  Extremely flavorful and just the right combination of spices.  Thank you for the recipe!

i from new orleans and this is close to the true blackened fish. however,  i love spicy food, but this recipe is WAY too spicy! the original recipe calls for 1 tsp. black pep.,1/2 tsp. cayenne, and 1/2 tsp. white pepper...cooking it this way is still spicy.

I wouldn't recommend cooking this in the house.  Heat a dry cast iron skillet on high on the grill.  I let mine get white hot.  It does generate a lot of smoke, but fish cooks quickly.  This is a very good recipe, and cooks quickly.

Excellent recipe, and I used to live in New Orleans. I used swordfish instead of snapper, and finished in the oven for a few minutes at 350 b/c outside was blackened but swordfish needed a little more time. Do beware of the smoke, hubby thought I was burning downt the kitchen!

I've never been very successful at blackening fish until I came across this recipe.  The only thing I changed was using rockfish (will try it with salmon & halibut next time), it was excellent, spicy with that distinct flavor that you can only achieve from blackening.  It didn't smoke up as bad as I anticipated but my family could feel the "pepper" in their throats while I was cooking so make sure to open up the windows!!

Excellent recipe, very simple too.  Just one bit of warning, though.  When you fist place the fish into the pan, DO NOT hang your face directly over the pan and inhale.  I spent the next three minutes coughing and racing to open the kitchen door and turn the AC onto high to vent the kitchen!  This recipe DOES make smoke!

Very good.  However, I would caution agains getting the cast iron skillet too hot.  When I added the butter, I got some flames.  And, man, the smoke is crazy.

OUTSTANDING,GREAT! I followed the other reviews and cooked this outside on my electric burner to eliminate the smoke.I used catfish and tapila-I could not make it into the house cause my hubsand was eating the fish as I was taking it out of the cast iron skillet. Minor adj:added creole spices and squeeze fresh lemon juice as it was cooking. Pls note:Very SPICY I reduced the amount of cayenne,white and black pepper to suit my 4yr old she enjoyed this too - 5plus stars thks Sandra

This was a delicous recipe, after reading some of the reviews I expected and warned family members of a smoke filled kitchen but there was not much smoke. Maybe it was the butter, I used Land o Lakes soft baking butter with canola oil. The fish blackened beautifully without burning.  It is a hot and spicy dish, my husband loved it.  I used a large skillet but not cast iron, worked fine.

Easy to prepare and very tasty.  As good as any blackened snapper I have had in restaurants (and I come from the Gulf Coast where this dish is a common offering).  Just a note of caution - you need excellent ventilation while cooking as the fumes can be quite irritating to the nose and lungs.

Flavor was excellent and cook times were spot on.  The problem with this recipe is the HUGE amount of Cayenne. Unusual for me,  I made the recipe in a hurry without reading the reviews.  We don't shy away from spicy foods,  but this was nearly inedible due to the amount of heat. Even removing the skin from one side and scraping the seasoning from the other it was very, very hot. As another reviewer suggested, cut the Cayenne to 1/4 off what the recipe calls for.  Be prepared for the smoke!

As written this is a tasty, spicy dish. 
I used the cast iron. Used frozen snapper (I'm in Ohio most fish comes frozen). 
The taste is authentic. For my taste it was pretty spicy. I might go lighter on the cayanne and pepper. But really it was very good. 
Served with red beans and rice for cajun night.

I have to say I was skeptical about the cooking process but wow what an excellent dish.  I had to talk my husband into trying it and his comment was - I can't wait to have it again!    The hubby and I loved the spice blend just the way it is.   Thank you so much for sharing!

We love all kinds of fish, but this was best made with a thin filet of tilapia. The cumin was a bit overpowering of all the other flavors, and yes, the cooking process very smoky. Used a non-stick griddle pan which worked well. Would definitely make this again.

I didn't have cayenne pepper so I substituted Hot Hungarian Paprika.  If you use stick butter, it will burn, smoke and turn bitter.  You can either use clarified butter or a mixture of melted butter and Peanut or Canola oil.  I also did not have Oregano,(which I only use in Pizza sauce) but substituted Marjoram which is a close cousin. Served with a side of Ratatouille and Saffron rice. All were very pleased.

Used the recipe step by step and it turned out fantastic a little spicy but just enough to not make you cry. I ended up making a mango salsa to cut down the heat and added a little crunch plus flavor

This was my first try at blackening. The result was yummy (a bit on the spicy side for me but my husband LOVED it). Tasty as it was though, if I make it in the future (or anything blackened) it will be modified for the outdoor grill - made WAY too big a mess indoors with a lot of smoke that my infant son and pets didn't appreciate.

My hubby and I are not familiar with N'Orleans cooking...yet.. If this is indicative of the flavours, then we need to get there asap!
Spice mix I cut back some of the pepper, and half the salt..Used EVOO brushed on fillets, sprinkled light layer of spice on both sides, chilled for an hr as per another comment.. sprinkled a bit more before frying, used EVOO again in cast iron on med-high. Seared one side, flipped over, finished in a 350 oven for a bit..absolutely delicious!

Made 6 servings for 8 red snapper filets. I greatly decreased the cayenne pepper so the kids would eat it. A little too much pepper for me but my sister really liked it. Next time I would decrease the pepper by half.

Very good, spicy fish. I omitted the onions and garlic because of a food allergy and they weren't missed at all. If your snapper has skin on one side, cook it skin side down first. I also used vegan butter since we are dairy free. Looking forward to making it again.

I had a question, I am not sure if I am posting in the right place. I tried the blackened before it came out good but smokes up the place way to much, and winter coming around so opening up windows will not work. question can I blacken in the broiler? I am thinking this should be doable maybe seal the fish in thin foil so juices dont evaporate

Great cajun spices!  I too decreased the cayenne (1/2 tsp), omitted white pepper and only used 1/2 tsp of salt.  Just put the fillets on a baking pan, drizzled with olive oil and rubbed the spices all over the top.  Broiled for about 15 mins until the fish flaked.  Very good and healthy - there's no need for all that butter!

LOVED IT!!! Me and my hubs arent fish ppl-but this turned out AMAZING-even my boys ate it. changed up 2nd time around a little spicy-the spices overpowered the fish;
took out 1/2 the cyanne
took out 1/4 the peppers

I had 2 thick fillets of snapper so I broiled them (with the spices on) first for a bit, got them 1/2 way cooked then stuck them in the skillet to blacken them. 

SO GOOD-thank you for the recipe-my first attempt at making fish was a total success.

It's a very quick and easy recipe. Be sure to use lots of butter! I did 3 mins on one side and 2 on the other. 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper is way too spicy for me, so for 2 pieces of fish I used 1/3 tsp.

Delish!  You can get by with a lot less butter and spritz or two of cooking spray.  Other than decreasing the amount of butter, I didn't make any changes.

Whew! This is SPICY, almost to the point of being inedible. I followed the recipe exactly (except I reduced the amount of butter). I would make it again, but would cut the peppers, the salt, and the paprika. I'll also reduce the amount of spice on each fillet.

This was awesome! I accidentally added a picture of myself instead of the dinner, but it was a great dish anyhow. I'd never cooked snapper before, nor had I ever blackened fish before. It got pretty smokey in the house at first, so if you have a powerful stove, you don't need to let the pan heat for 10 minutes on high-- it could start glowing red!! I had to let the fish cook a little longer than the directions instructed, but overall, this dish was, well, delicious! And everyone in the household loved it, anyone who thought this tasted plain must not have used the same ingredients, or an iron skillet, you must not have taste buds if you missed this great flavor!

Whoo hoo! Makes your mouth hot all over. Tip: don't close your lips over the fork, else your lips will burn hot. Super-easy Monday night meal, served with Southwestern-style frozen vegetable blend (corn, green & red peppers, onions, black beans) & of course, ice cold beer. Tip: if your whole fillet renders portions of different thicknesses, filet the thicker portions further, so all your serving pieces are of equal thickness.

This was absolutely amazing! I had some major delays in being about to serve my dinner and was REALLY worried that the fish would be ruined, (2 1/2 hours in the oven) but it wasn't. My husband said, "Oh my! I would pay for this!" Now that is a HIGH compliment coming from him.. hehe THANKS!!!

Great meal - the method of cooking worked perfectly.  But don't mess with all those different spices;  just use Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning.  Also I used peanut oil instead of butter and it worked great.  (dairy allergy)

I made this tonight.  My boyfriend and I agree its one of the best fish we have had!!  The flavor was great!!  We thought it would have a "burnt" taste, but we were wrong!! I only added half the amount of salt, and still found it way too salty! (maybe from the butter).  Next time I am going to omit the salt all together!  There definitly will be a next time!!  This was DeLISH!!!

I have been making this recipe for 3 years.  I have young kids.  I use tilapia.  I only use 1/2c of butter.  I melt it in the pan then stir in the seasoning -- reducing the hot pepper to ~1/4 tsp and no white pepper.  I simply put the fillets on the mixture then flip it as it cooks once or twice.  Even the youngest loves it (and this is the only way he will eat fish).  Warning -- wear an old t-shirt.  If it spashes it will not come out of clothing.

This is good but is the predominant flavor of Cajun food just 'spicy'? It's quite similar to spicy 'rava (semolina) masala' fry Goan fish...
But watch out for the smoke-- asthma-attack inducing as we learned at my home!

I used Tilapia because my market was out of Snapper and it was deliciuos.  I also used olive oil instead of butter.  The blackening season was so yummy.  I am going to make a large batch up to have on hand!

This was probably the best way I've prepared fish.  i used talipia instead of snapper and I do also recommend a well ventilated area , the spices can make breathing a difficulty when the kitchen is smoking from searing the fish.

Made it pretty much exactly as the recipe says but substituted Olive Oil for the Butter.
Definitely a Keeper.

Great recipe. I deleted the butter all the way around and just rolled the fish in the seasoning. WOW. If you like it spicy like me, this was great.

Very good.  Authentic.  Used it on grouper to make blackened grouper caesar salad.  Use best quality paprika you can find since that is the main spice here.

This is a great dish.  My husband thought so too. I used a cast iron skillet and it really smoked up the house badly and the smoke smell really lingered, but the flavor is so worth it.  I think I'll try to put that skillet on the outside grill next time.  I plan to make this over and over! Thanks

This was really good, but we believe we'd prefer catfish over snapper.  The seasoning and directions for cooking worked out well.  Thank you!

Excellent. I used a heavy-bottomed non-stick skillet and it worked great. The spices adhered to the fish, and the amount of heat was perfect for us. Will definately make this again!

For the past 15 years three buddies and I have been going to Alaska.  We always bring home anywhere from 100 to 250 pounds of halibut.  I use this seasoning on the halibut.  Cook on each side for about three minutes as halibut dries out very quickly.  Outstanding!  I make up packets of the seasoning and keep it handy for a quick meal.

WHOOO! I love spicy food, but this was too much for me.  I did like the background flavor, but it was overwhelmed by heat.  We'll make it again, but cut the cayenne and pepper amounts.

I made this for New Years Eve, and the seasoning tasted great.  I left out the cayenne, and the fish still had a good kick.  I don't know if I'll make it again though...for some reason my red snapper got tough.

This must be good. My wife hates fish but she really liked this one. I toned it down on the pepper side for my family. It still had a pretty good kick regardless though(to them). This is a keeper, thanks!

This was fabulous.  I also took the iron skillet outside and put it on the gas grill to avoid smoking up the house.  Worked great!  I cut the red pepper in half and it was still hot enough.  For a wonderful Cajun Cream sauce to put on top, combine 2 T. cornstarch in 1/4 c. water.  Saute 1 chopped shallot in 2T dry white wine until softened.  Add 1 T. blackened spice mix (from above recipe), and stir in 2 cups heavy cream and heat.  Add cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring until thickened.  YUMMY!  Happy eating!

I love the flavor of the seasonings in this recipe. I eliminated some of the pepper and the cayenne (due to  a sensitive stomach) with great results. It is easy and I will definately serve this on a regular basis.

Easy to make. Quick. The right balance of spicy which the fish helps balance. The garlic and onion add nice undertones. Yes it is smoky but the fish is not dry. Very tasty. Will make again.

Excellent. Didn't change a thing in the recipe. Cooked in cast-iron skillet on the grill fearful of extremely hot skillet indoors. I don't think it call for it, but I put the seasoning on both sides of the fish.

Very tasty! We cooked it on the bbq on high on a flat grill for 5 and 3 minutes. We used a quarter cup of butter mixed with an eighth cup of canola oil and it was enough liquid. Next time, we will add more cayenne and less salt.

I loved it. Followed directions exactly,  except I cooked mine maybe a minute more to my preference. Too often premixed blackening seasonings are too salty. This was not salty, balanced spices, not too spicy. Lemon garnish is a must. Thanks for sharing another great recipe I'll use often.

Very tasty. I would definitely use less than the recipe indicates for cayenne and salt. I used 1 tsp of cayenne and no more than 1 tsp of salt.  Fish was sufficiently salted and spicy with these reductions.   In fact, I would use less cayenne next time. Glad I tried this recipe!

The fish was cooked well, but too much salt (my salt loving father in law said so) and there’s an after taste of seasoning (and not in a good way). Overall, would not be something I add to my recipe collection.

Spicy and just the right amount of crunch. Fish was tender on the inside. Flavor was amazing. Served it with a fresh off the tree mango for sweet/spicy dinner. I will definitely make this again.

I rarely cook fish , so I’m always nervous to cook it when I decide that it’s time to add it back into our meal planning .. that being said this recipe looked simple enough to try . It was very easy and straight forward to mix the seasonings together, and even more awesome that I had them all on hand (except for the white pepper).  I used my cast iron skillet and ghee

The blackening rub part is excellent flavor, however the recipe calls for 1.5 cups of butter for 4 portions. We had 3/4 cup left over, as we were able to use the butter that was in the skillet to spoon over the remaining 2 fillets.

So take note, you can likely get away with just a 1/2 cup melted butter total if you coat with what is in the pan.

A couple of things.  Don't over purchase the fish.  I followed the instructions and had a lot more fish than necessary.  And, listen to everyone else who's reviewing this meal.  It is NOT necessary to put so much of the spice on the fish.  It will light you up!  Also, the instructions said to give the cast iron skillet a good 10 minute warm up on high heat.  That's just asking for a fire.  Otherwise it was really good.  Will do it again, but thinner pieces of fish and less spice.

De-Lish!!!!! I made it exactly as instructed & came out great. Its the first time I cooked snapper that way. The flavor was great & i loved the crispy outside with the moist tender fish inside. My husband ate it just like that. I tried to add some of whatever I had at home. I cut my fillets small & ended up eating it as a simple lettuce wrap. Fish, sliced avocado, corn salsa from trader joes wrapped in a romaine lettuce leaf. Fresh & filling. I will be making this again:) Just know to heed the warnings from some of the other reviews.... this will smoke up you kitchen! So if you have a fan make sure its on!

Okay so I almost burnt my house down because of my cast iron skillet being on high heat. Smoke was billowing and my smoke alarms went off! I suggest putting the cast iron skillet on medium heat. And probably replace the butter with an oil of some sort because the butter burned.

Didn't have cayenne on hand so substituted Tony Chachere's . Also noted the smoke comments so put my iron skillet on the grill. PERFECT!! I'm definitely mixing more of this seasoning combo to have on hand for next time. Thanks for the Excellent Recipe! I had no clue how to cook snapper.

This was absolutely scrumptious! The only change I made was to sauté on medium heat in a nonstick pan instead of blackening.

This was a great recipe.  Cooked in a skillet and served with a couple of poached  eggs.  Eggs blended well with the flavor.   I found that the heat from the spice wasn't too much.

Easy to make and taste great (if you like spicy).  I substituted bay leaves for the thyme because I didn't have any thyme.  Next time I make it, I'll cook it a bit longer because following the times in the recipe left it a little undercooked.  I was concerned the fish might stick to the skillet so added additional butter to the bottom of the skillet.  I like spicy food, so this was great.

Yum! Blackened anything is a household favorite, but snapper is king. This spice mix has just enough heat without being overpowering. And the key with a dish like this is to use a dry skillet and really dredge the fish in melted butter. I rubbed the spice into the fish before the butter, and it came out great.

This turned out excellent !
Because I am a wimp,  I did cut the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp. and it was still plenty spicy. 
At 1 1/2 cups o butter, melted, we had some left over - so next time will cut that by half,too. 
Hubby cooked this out on the grill in my large cast iron skillet. Will be making this again for sure.

I very much so enjoyed this!! But! Make sure you have a ventilation system! We had to open all the windows as soon as the fish hit the skillet. Lots of smoke and combined with the spices we had air mace going on! Cooks quickly, great flavor! Don't just season and put it in the pan. Make sure you spoon the butter over it! Will definitely do again, but have a better vent plan in place!

I would make it again. I used olive oil, not butter and half the amount of pepper because of other reviewers. Would've used a tad more salt and cooking time should be closer to 5 minutes (def. not 3) on one side and about 3 on other. Easy peasy and good.

A tad spicy ,  I might use a bit less cayenne next time.  I softened the heat with a bit of sour cream.  Great blend of spices,  will definitely make this again.  Excellent flavour.

Good spicy seasoning. Could use half the cayenne for us mortals.

Not a bad recipe but I changed it up quite a bit to be healthier and even simpler. a) used Mccormik's Cajun seasoning  b) used olive oil instead of butter c) used small whole red snapper.

I dressed the fish in only the seasoning then fried it in the hot olive oil.

With that said, my version was much healthier, quicker and still tasty the same way. My cooking time each side was about 6 mins per side as the snapper was small. Easy and tasty!

I used lemon-thyme. Love the spicy-charred flavour.

We used the spice mix and skipped the butter and baked the salmon in the oven.  It was delish.

I actually used Old bay seasoning, works fine as well. Clarfying the butter will allow it to reach a hotter temp, and yes this WILL smoke up the house a bit. I got a big lung full of the first fillet and couldnt stop coughing for about 5 minutes. hah, everyone loved it, pretty quick and easy. set the rice cooker and blacken some fish. all said and done 35 minutes.

Tasty and easy to put together, but no need to use 1.5 cups of melted butter.  Melt 3/4 of a cup in a shallow bowl or plate and use them to dredge the fish through.  Most of it ends up staying on the plate, and there's plenty left to put over the fish whille it cooks.

This recipe is amazing! I bought 2 lbs of snapper (4 fillets), but I ran out of the dry mix. Next time, I'll just double the recipe. I didn't have onion or garlic powder, so I had to use a dry onion soup mix and it came out fantastically :)

Really good recipe! I did not have a cast iron skillet, so I used my heavy non-stick caphalon pan. I squeezed lemon over it before and after cooking to enhance the flavor of snapper. This recipe reminded me of the blackened snapper I used to order from the restaurants when I visited the coast.

This was a great dinner by itself (4 stars) but the next night when I made sandwiches with the left over fish on toasted kaiser buns, tomato, a little mayo and pieces of pineapple it was out of this world - 5 stars! A new family favorite. I enjoy cajun spicyness but I decreased the cayenne by 1/2 teaspoon and found the heat just right. We will definitely make this again but probably go straight to the sandwiches!

This recipe is fantastic. I am at a loss as to how "Lamcancook" could possibly have thought this had no flavor and needs salt. If you look at the ingredients (including the TB of salt!!!) you will see how unlikely that is.  I will use this recipe over and over.

This was very good.  It was my first time making blackened fish and I was surprised how easy it was to make. I cut way back on the pepper, I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne total, and for my family it was perfect. I also cut back on the butter, and didn't put any on the fish after the final flip.  I also used just a regular frying pan and while I did cook it on high I only waited about 2 minutes before putting the fish on.  There was no smoke in my kitchen and the fish cooked up beautifully.

This was great, with a few modifications:  no oregeno, 1/2 tsp. black, white, and cayenne pepper, 1 tsp Lawry's seasoned salt, extra light extra virgin olive oil instead of butter.  I love spicy food and with these modifications, the recipe was still spicy but without overpowering the fish.

Really good recipe. Always, always cook this type of Cajun food outside. When you buy Cajun seasoning at the store, there is usually a warning on it about the smoke that will come from it while it is cooking. The smoke can be harmful to your health as well as to any pet birds in your home.

Delicious!  This is such a great and different way to cook fish.  I don't like spicy food so I omitted the cayenne pepper and only did one tablespoon of paprika.  Will make this meal again.

This was my first time trying this recipe but it's a keeper.  I had to substitue Italian seasoning for oregano (my husband dislikes oregano) but it worked out great!  I also used bummel and brown spread due to a low carb lifestyle, it didnt take away from a delicious flavor.  Will definitely try again.

I used this on catfish fillets instead of red snapper, and it was absolutely wonderful. The flavor is amazing, and my wife absolutely loved it. The 2 teaspoons of cayenne does pack some heat, but you can easily reduce the amount for more timid eaters.

Overall, a wonderful spice mix. I will definitely be making this again.

Well I made this recipe twice, the first time it came out just alright, because I didn't use a cast-iron skillet, just a frying pan, and I had the heat on high.  I think I burned the fish instead of blackening it.  But it still tasted okay.  The second time I did everything the same but I cooked it on a lower heat.  It came out perfect!!!  I substituted the cayenne pepper with red chili pepper instead so that it wouldn't be too spicy.  My guest loved it even though my whole house was full of smoke, it was worth it.
