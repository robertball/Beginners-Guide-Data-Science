This was kind of a last minute-family dosen't want Burrito Pie kind of dinner. I cut this recipe down by half and used two very large BLSL chicken breasts that I pounded down semi-thin and cut into largish chunks. Before adding the chicken to the casserole, I did lightly bread it with a little whole-wheat white flour, onion/garlic powder, paprika, oregano and fresh ground pepper and browned it in a little EVOO. I did not have green onions so I used one small yellow onion. I did make my own cream of chicken soup from scratch (I try my best to make what I can from scratch without using processed products or high fat ingredients) while incorporating a little of the sour cream. I cooked the onions (with a few minced cloves of garlic) after I browned the chicken in the hot EVOO, then added a little glug of white wine to deglaze the pan, then a cup and a half or so of organic chicken broth. I let the sauce reduce, then wisked in about a 1/4 cup or so of reduced fat sour cream and just a touch of fat free half-n-half. Wa-la, cream of chicken soup without using processed foods! I'll tell you, my family loved this casserole. Even my picky kid who will darn near turn his nose up at anything scarfed two helpings. I had one bite and thought it was heaven. Next time, I'll serve this with homemade fluffy biscuits. Just a side salad wasn't enough for my boys. You needed something to soak up the extra sauce!

The flavor on this is very yummy, my son especially loved and he doesn't like mushrooms. What killed it for us was the corn flakes. 4 cups is way too much, they overtook the dish. It made it hard to eat and we all tried picking them out. Normally we like that type of thing. I wouldn't even make it with them again, I would use either Ritz if I wanted cracker, or broken biscuits, and I would only use half the amount.

I cut this recipe back and it was still a little bit too much for us. I cooked it exactly as it said, but it was lacking some flavor. I believe that some garlic and onions would up the flavor tremendously so the next time I try it I will be adding that. I also think that using shredded or ground chicken would work much better. Chunks/strips were a bit cumbersome, I also think that a cheese mixture would bump up of the flavor. All in all, it is a good recipe but it just needs some modifications for our household.

Oh my was this good! I served it tonight and got one comment that it tasted like a 5-star restaurant! I do think I will change a few things next time. There was too much of everything to fit in my 9x13 baking dish. I could probably have gotten by with about half of the chicken and half of the cheese. It also seemed like there wasn't quite enough of the soup/sour cream mixture, so will probably double up on that next time. i was worried about it spilling over in the oven, so put down a sheet of aluminum foil. Thankfully, it didn't spill over. Will enjoy this again and again. Thanks for sharing Holly!

This is the first time I've taken the time to review something on here, but this recipe was soo good, I wanted to make sure others tried it. It is the best casserole I've ever eaten!! My only alterations- I didn't use parmesean cheese because I didn't have any, I only used 4 (whole) chicken breasts, 4 cups of cheese (6 seemed like too much since I used less chicken, I used 98% fat free condensed soup, and I didn't add the extra butter at the end. It tasted perfect. I won't change anything for next time, except to maybe add an extra cup of cornflakes for the top. Also, don't leave out the green onions, they add A LOT of flavor! Thank you Holly S.!

Amazing! Had to do some substitution based on what I had: only used 6 chicken breasts substituted 5 cheese Italian blend cheese for 2 cups of the swiss and used crushed club crackers instead of cornflakes. I did saut√© the mushrooms & green onion together in the pan before I cooked the chicken breast.  Also, I deglazed the pan with white wine and mixed the cream of chicken soup & sour cream in the pan afterwards.  Will definitely make again & again. Thanks!
***still making it a couple years later. It's easy to throw chicken breasts in the oven while cleaning the kitchen, then slice and throw in the fridge for the next day.  Made it without sauteing the mushroom and onion, still don't use a full 10 chicken breasts, always sub 1 sleeve of club crackers, crushed for the corn flakes and is still a hit.  Thanks for your recipe!

On a scale of 1 - 10, this definitely got a 9 or 9.5.  It was even better the 2nd day after baking.  This was really easy, because I used leftover baked chicken that I had frozen, leftover ham, and sliced swiss cheese.  I was short of corn flake crumbs, so compensated by adding crushed Ritz crackers.  I cut the parm cheese down by 1/2, and used fat-free soup and sour cream.  We'll be making this again and again... it is so much easier than the traditional chicken cordon bleu, and every bit as good.  My son is already dropping a lot of hints about wanting me to make this again.

I made this for dinner last night - and the end result was just okay.  I added sauteed onion and garlic in with the chicken mixture, I cut the recipe in half and reduced the amount of cheese (to 2 cups), chicken (to 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts) and breadcrumbs (to 1.5 cups).  I found the dish to be good, but not great - just not worth the fat and calories IMHO.

Very good!  My son asked if he would Chicken Cordon Bleu since he never had it.  After one bite he was hooked!  Skipped the mushrooms.  Large recipe so I scaled most of it back and used a smaller dish.  I did make almost all of the topping/bottom layer.  It was good and crispy on both the top and the bottom.  Used fresh chicken breats that I cubed and cooked in a skillet first with a little olive oil and garlic.

I wanted to like this because I love  the Cordon Bleu, but this just turned out too salty.  Between the ham, the parm, cheese, etc it was just too much saltiness.  I'll look for reduced sodium everything and try again.

I made this tonight for my parents and the three of us ate every drop of it! You could tell that my dad was a little suspicious when I mentioned that I was gonna cook them dinner but I found this recipe and decided that it would fit well with everything else I had for the meal. It was absolutely delicious and fairly easy to make! I cut the recipe in half because there were only three of us eating it and there was more then enough. Made a few adjustments including ditching the cornflakes and using seasoned bread crumbs instead and they worked very well. Served it with a nice microbrewed IPA from Asheville,NC and it was heaven.   one note: The more cheese the better...i used swiss and parmesean and it worked incredibly.

This was excellent, to make it a bit healthier I used half the amount of cheese (swiss is strong anyways), fat free sour cream, fat free cream of chicken soup, and 1/4 the amount of butter. It turned out better than I thought and it was very quick and easy.

Auh-mazing recipes! The only changes I made where reducing everything by half since I didn't need 12 servings and didn't put the corn-flake mixture on the bottom solely because I forgot! Amazing taste and easy prep!

Wow ... I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I don't actually like Chicken Cordon Bleu. However, after reading the reviews and tweaking a bit, this turned out super yummy. It will be a favorite I am sure.
I halved the recipe as I am cooking for two but want lots of leftovers. I sauteed the green onions & mushrooms in EVOO and butter to begin with. (I also added a couple cloves of garlic.) I removed the veggies and sauteed the chicken breasts and then the cubed ham. After removing the meat, I deglazed the pan with white wine, reduced it, added flour, 1 tsp. powdered chicken stock, cream, milk & sour cream to create a yummy sauce rather than using the canned soup. I layered per the recipe and skipped the final melted butter. I opted to use the cornflake crumbs rather than substitute Ritz crackers as some others suggested and I am glad I did. We both felt the cornflake crumbs added a ton of flavor. All I can say is, "YUM!"

I just made this for dinner... it was FABULOUS!  so much flavour!  I needed a recipe to get rid of some left over ham from the night before.  I used low fat soup, fat free sour cream, and low fat swiss to help lighten the calorie load and it was delicious :)   will definitely make this one again!

Great recipe, though I will probably use a little less cheese next time.

This was a fantastic meal, easy to make, ingredients that were easy to find.  A unique blend of flavors that had everyone coming back for more! I had several requests for the recipe.  Only thing I did different was I used sliced (processed) swiss cheese and I did use a bit more parmesan cheese.  To say this is a fantastic and impressive meal is NOT doing it justice.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and loved it.  It is a big recipe so I made a half -- with plenty left over to freeze in serving portions.  This is going to be my new recipe for Book Club when it is my turn to be hostess, but it is not just a "ladies' luncheon" recipe.  My husband liked it a lot!  Because I was pressed for time I bought pre-grilled, seasoned and sliced chicken strips and they were good.  (I had never used them before.  I used 4 - 6 oz. bags from "Tyson's")  I did chop the ham because I had it on hand, but saw packages in the meat counter of pre-diced ham.  When in a pinch I will try that, too.

Update 4/29 - I am reducing this to 2 stars because this just continues to be a struggle for me with my family.  No one really likes this but me and the leftovers are a huge pain.  It seems like it needs carbs to counteract the heavy greasy cheesiness, but I haven't found a carb (rice, pasta, etc.) that seems to pair well with it for serving.  Leftovers are hard to reheat and greasy.  I will be removing this from my recipe box.  Original Review - This was very yummy but salty from the ham. I halved the recipe but kept the sauce as written. I ended up using bone boiled deli ham cut thick instead of cubed and it worked fine. I just chopped it coarse.  The recipe says to salt the first chicken layer, but I would skip that given the saltiness of the ham. I will also use regular onion cooked wit the chicken next time rather than green onion. It didn't look very pretty cooked and my DD has issues with "green things" in her food so I had to pick them out of her serving.

We were not a huge fan of this. I am glad I scaled down the recipe to six servings. I roasted two big chicken breasts w/ salt, pepper and olive oil in the oven. When cooled chopped it up into small chunks. Used good ham and no scallions. I even spiced it up with pepper, garlic powder, and dried onion. Instead of corn flakes I used Ritz which was good. 3 Cups of Swiss was a lot and only used 1 cup. I picked out the chicken and my husband ate the rest. I don't think I will be making this again and will stick to the traditional Chicken Cordon Bleu.

I will have to try it again as written. I didnt have cornflakes so I used bread crumbs - a mistake as they were quite mushy. Mine took longer to cook than stated. Sauce was ok. Worth another attempt.

I didn't change a thing and did exactly as the recipe said. Everyone in the family absolutely loved it and there were lots of leftovers after it fed 8 of us and those who weren't stuffed went back for seconds. Very filling and delicious. I served with greek salad (a family favourite) and biscuits.

I thought this was delicious. I served it to company this evening. It was a LOT of food! There were 8 of us and 7 went back for seconds, and i still had leftovers! My tips (based on others' reviews): measure the 4 cups of cornflakes, THEN crush them. I reduced the cheese to about 4 cups (1 lb.)  I added about 1/2 cup fresh chopped parsley along with onions & garlic. Also I diced the chicken (not sliced) and used diced ham, and sprinkled the chicken with salt & pepper as I was sauteeing it. I did not add any more salt & pepper after that, and it was plenty well seasoned. This was delicious and I WILL fix it again!

First off I may have messed this recipe up because adding the butter to the cornfalek crumbs just made balls. Next, Way too much cheese. The casserole ended up bland. I don't know how especially with sour cream. I am suresomething must have gone wrong but I went right along with the directions. I was hoping for chicken cordon blue but I ended up with a greesy, tastless chicken melt with a crumb topping that had a wierd texture. I threw it out. I won't try it again! I would have added veggies for sure!

This was great! A real keeper. NOTE: I scaled it to 6 servings not 12.

I followed the suggestions of other posts--  sauteed 8oz (not 4oz) mushrooms, added garlic, and a small onion and deglazed with 2/3c of wine. I skipped the scallions. I put paprika, onion powder, sage and mustard powder in plain bread crumbs and used extra butter in them for the crumb layer and I only put it on top. My scaled version called for 2c crumbs but I should have made only 1 cup+. I put peas in the mushroom layer. I used 16 oz of tyson grilled strips cut into chunks. I used only 2c swiss when my scaled version called for 3c, it was plenty of cheese.

It was creamy and very flavorful due to the extra mushrooms,garlic, and the wine deglazing. Also my crumb layer was delish.

Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  My husband loved it.  I would have given it five stars but it's just not a dish that I would make often because it is sort of "heavy".  The recipe was very easy.  The only change I made was only making one layer of each ingrediant.  It just seemed silly to layer the chicken twice.  Will def make again in the future.

I made this recipe as written, with the exception of cutting it in half. My personal taste.....I didn't care for the green onion in it and I would have preferred the mushrooms in smaller pieces but other than that it is a great recipe!! Very flavorful and a nice twist on chicken cordon bleu!!! Yummy!!

I fed a group of 7 with this recipe, and everyone loved it!  It's even great next day, reheated!  I used the precooked chicken and sliced ham that I then cut into squares.  I only used three or four green onions, too.  Other than that, I made it by the book, and it was certainly delicious!  It's a keeper!

I thought this recipe was delicious!  My husband prefers the variation with the stove top stuffing on top, by my 6-yr old son and I loved it.  I did half the recipe and it still filled up my 9 x 13 pyrex dish.  I only used 1.5lbs of chicken since I am a little conservative on the meat in our house and used a high quality ham (really yummuy).  I did cook my chicken breast most of the way through before adding to the dish as others suggested and the dish still took the entire time for the flavors to meld.  I used 8oz of muenster cheese slices in the middle and 8oz of mozzerella in the top layer because that's what I had at home.  I did omit the mushrooms, green onions and additional 2tb of butter on top as my family doesn't like these veges and I didn't want to open a new stick of butter.  Overall... yummy dish and will make again.  Maybe the veges will help blend some of the salty taste from the ham and cream of chicken soup.

What a clever idea.  Am so glad I came across this recipe!  It makes a ton,  in the future unless I am entertaining,  I  may have to cut in half.  I love Chicken Cordon Bleu,  it's a guilty pleasure of mine,  so this really hit the spot for me.  I did season it up more,  added more mushrooms,  etc.  It is extremely rich.  I served it as a topping for pasta.  I would think it would be extremely rich to just eat as a main course alone.  My husband has been begging for me to make this again.

This was very good. I baked the chicken breasts (and only used five) with heavy seasoning and pats of butter, and sliced the chicken per the recipe. I did pour the pan juices from the chicken into the soup/sour cream mixture. I think that gave it a lot more flavor. The only thing I will change next time is I will add an extra can of soup for a little more sauce, and maybe half Swiss cheese and half  Gruyere cheese next time. Great recipe!

It was pretty good. It was way too big for our family that night, so I scaled it for four people, but used the whole can of soup. My changes were that I used a rotisserie chicken and did not put corn flake crumbs on the bottom. It worked out pretty well. 

I definitely will make this again.

EASY CONVENIENT GOOD   I  used 1 1/2 cracker sleeve method,
and it was fine. Next time I will use panko. It was very good
and handy to freeze. I added a beet salad and all enjoyed.

This is AMAZING!!! One of our top favorite recipes. I used half and half Pepper Jack and Swiss. And threw in several cloves of roasted garlic just to spice it up a little. But the recipe is awesome just the way it is.

Excellent!   I followed directions, but instead of layering, mixed it all together with the soup, etc, then poured into a casserole dish with some crumb mixture on the bottom and the crumb mixture on the top.  The chicken was in cubes, like the ham.  It turned out great!  Definitely a do-over for my family.
