12.26.16  This is extremely quick and easy to make, but whoa, does it taste decadent!  Didn’t realize it until I got started, but I was out of brown sugar, so I had to sub Splenda® Brown Sugar blend.  It worked fine, and I even saved a few calories.  This syrup was the perfect topping today for Easy Banana Nut Pancakes, also on this site.  Very nice option for pancake syrup.

This was a perfect ice cream topping. Super yummy better than real Carmel. I’m totally going to make this again. Mmmhh. I’m in love with this recipe.

I'll make it again, it's quick and easy. It does separate, so shake it up again before using. It's yummy.

I ran out of maple syrup for our French toast so I searched for an easy syrup recipe I had all the ingredients for; this recipe was it! It is super simple and my kids LOVED it. The recipe made about 2 cups so I’m going to refrigerate some to use on another day. It would do well on ice cream too.
