I made this for company, my friend can only eat chicken and turkey, and I made it exactly as as the recipe said. Only had time to marinate for 6 hours. It had really, really strong flavor. I think it might be wise to rinse the chicken before skewering. 5 showed up for dinner, and I had alot of leftover chicken. Since she is still here, tonight we are trying a turkey recipe.

Bland and boring, this did not taste like tandoori at all. I gave it two stars because it was still edible, but the recipe is awful.
