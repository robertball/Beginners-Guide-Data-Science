This recipie was very good, however, the indicated baking time of between 10-15 minutes is totally unrealistic.  Try 20-25 minutes. I have made these muffins twice, and the second time I added the grated rind of a lemon and topped them with cinnamon and sugar.

Ok you guys, I got it. I tried this recipe on a whim this morning as I went strawberry picking yesterday and the muffins are FANTASTIC!!!  Follow the recipe as is (I used a little less sugar as my strawberries are very sweet and ripe),use a smidgen more cinnamon and only use 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.   As suggested my a previous reviewer use 1 egg, 1/4 cup oil, and 1 cup milk. Also mix in 1 and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries and 1 cup finely chopped (use food processor) pecans.  Use muffin tin liners and fill to top, quickly mix up heaping tbs. of flour, heaping tbs brown sugar and 1 tbs butter, mix until crumbly and sprinkle on top. *This crumble is magic, it wont stay on top, but sinks in a bit for a delicious little extra oomph!  BAKE FOR 20 MIN.   And voila! Moist, cakey, strawberry-y muffins!

I made these muffins earlier today and I found them to be a little on the dry tasting side. I used paper baking cups and the bottoms were very oily after they were baked. Next time I'm going to substitute either applesauce or mashed banana for 1/2 of the oil. I ended up with 19 muffins.

I had exactly a cup of berries left over from a dessert, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  I halved the amount of oil and replaced it with mango-applesauce. I was wary of the baking time indicated, it seemed too short. It took 20 minutes for the muffins to be ready. The recipe made 16 muffins. I thought they were "okay", however, my son loved them and ate three in a row. I might make them again, but I would add more of the cinnamon and nutmeg, and add a cinnamon-sugar topping.

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  They were very oily and I agree with the other reviews that the baking time needed to be increased by quite a bit.  I made another batch of muffins after using this recipe but I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added only 1 egg and 1 cup of milk.  This next batch came out much better.  I will not make the original recipe again.  Sorry.

Very nice basic muffin, with an overly nutmeggy taste (will need to decrease that next time).  Substituted 1 cup applesauce for the oil, and they came out very moist.  Took about 18 minutes to bake.  Will see what the others think tomorrow!

I thought this was a simple easy recipe and the muffins turned out well.  I used chopped almonds because I prefer those to walnuts.  They are not overly sweet which I think is a strong attribute considering this would typically be a breakfast item but when I brought them into the office, I sprinkled some powdered sugar on them for presentation and to ensure I met sweet expectations from fellow colleagues!

I followed some of the other reviews and added mashed bananas instead of a whole cup of oil. I thought the time was approximate, I cooked the muffins for 20 minutes and got 18 large muffins. My family was unsure how they felt about the taste. They said they were good but not something they want added to the regular menu. I thought they were very good and would give them a 5 star review but the average in my family was a 3 star.

While the recipe was very good, I found them to also be very oily. Next time I am going to try it with less!

I took the advice of other reviewers and basically came up with a much altered recipe but very yummy according to my guests.  I used half whole wheat flour for health.  To equal same amount of liquid I used 1 egg, 1/2 cup oil, 3/4 cup milk, and 1/4 cup apple sauce.  Baking time was 20 minutes.

I had to make several adjustments to the recipe: maybe my oven isn't great but 15 minutes wasn't nearly enough baking time. And 350 was too low. For the second try I preheated to 375 and baked mine for 40 minutes. I used 2 eggs instead of 3, and added a cup of oatmeal and they are fantastic.

I was torn whether or not to review this because I changed a lot of things after reading all the reviews. However, I felt it was important to say how amazing they are if you make a few adjustments. Like some other reviewers: I decreased the eggs to 1, decreased the oil to 1/4 cup, added 1 cup of milk, halved the nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon. The results were amazing and all five of my children have the adjusted recipe rave reviews.

These were good but I think next time I will add only half the oil as 1 cup is to much. l

Good flavor but very oily. Next time, I will replace half the oil with applesauce. Also, the strawberries need to be cut smaller than I did initially. The cooking time was about 20-25 minutes.

Good base recipe, it was just what was looking for. I wanted a simple recipe that i could easily modify. I used half the nutmeg called for, used 1 1/2 cups of rhubarb instead of strawberries, added an extra pinch of baking soda, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 envelope of raspberry jello (strawberry is good too but i didnt have any), I dont really like nuts very much so I didnt put any in but i did top it with some brown sugar, I also had to bake for about 20-25 minutes. I will definitely use this recipe agian.

The paper cups in which I baked the muffins came out drenched in oil and the muffins themselves were dry crumbles.

I made these muffins exactly to the recipe.  They were oily and not thoroughly baked after 17 minutes.  I had planned on taking them to a meeting, but not the way they turned out.  I dumped them in a bowl; figure maybe I could use them as a cobbler.  I believe the 1 cup of oil is too much.  A disappointment for All Recipes.  Everything else I have tried through the years have  been very good.  Recipe says 1 doz, but also mentioned 2 pans....I made 12 large, and 12 mini muffins.

My experience with this receipe was not what I had expected.  They were good to a degree but not sure if I will make again.  The batter was more of a dough form and finished product was a little dry & bland.  The cooking time definetely needs to be increased and I also got 18 muffins out of it.
