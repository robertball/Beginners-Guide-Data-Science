I made as is. I was concerned that it was a little thinner than I had expected (I had been looking for a recipe similar to one my grandmother used to make and this is pretty darn close!) but it set up fine, especially after it'd been out of the oven for a few minutes. The only thing I missed was butter IN the potatoes, more out of expecting the flavor than anything else. All in all, a very close second to my gramma's and I was not displeased.

I really enjoyed this!   I love the texture and the flavor!  I didn't have light cream on hand, so I had to substitute milk and butter for that part.  Definitely a make again for me!
