I used craisins instead of cranberries and added 1 cup of water. I used splenda instead of sugar. I used sugar free jello. I used as a cranberry sauce and I used as a dessert with fat free cool whip. Weight Watchers it came out to 3pts a serving for 8 servings

Normally, I'm not a big fan of jello but I loved this.  I loved the tang of the cranberry and raspberries. People loved this in place of cranberry sauce with turkey.  This simple recipe will be used often.

I love this salad partly because I love anything with raspberries. The cranberries give it a little tang in contrast to the sweet berries and sugar. For personal taste I always add celery for that extra texture. I frosted it with raspberry yogurt before serving. Yummy!

We didn't realize when we tried to make this that we wouldn't be able to find cranberries!  Even frozen.  We actually made it work by straining the gelatin off whole cranberry sauce. It was so good though even with the adjustment.  We did put a dab of raspberry yogurt on top and it looked so nice for our baby shower.  We did a plated lunch with a chicken salad croissant, pasta salad and this and everyone loved it.

If you like the tartness of cranberries, you will love this salad.  If you don't, this is not the recipe for you.

This salad was delicious, an excellent side dish for Thanksgiving dinner. I substituted the water with orange juice. It was a big hit and I will certainly be making it again.

This is delicious!  The cranberries add a nice amount of tart flavor to balance the sweet.

I make this recipe about six times a year.  I love it with barbecued chicken in the summer.  Instead of the raspberry I used frozen cherry with cherry Jell-O I've also used cans pineapple and pineapple to love.  But my favorite is the raspberry. Mary P., Thanks you for sharing this recipe.

I make this every year. Everyone loves it and its my favorite part of the meal. I don't even like cranberry sauce but it meshes wonderfully and deliciously with the raspberries..

Very very good, but this is almost too tart, even for me, and I love tart desserts.  I would make this again but either add sweetness in the form of a can of crushed pineapple (I have a cranberry salad that uses crushed pineapple and it is awesome) or cut back on the cranberries.  You could add more sugar, I suppose, but if I'm adding anything, I think I'd prefer it to be more fruit.  Or, instead of raspberries, you could do strawberries, which should also cut the tartness.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as written.  I wasted money on ingredients.  The texture is unpleasant due to the cranberry skins and I think it needs more sweetner, 1/2 cup sugar isn't enough to suit my tastes. I served with sweetened whipped cream, anticipating the sourness of the cranberries and it still wasn't sweet enough.  I was afraid to add more sugar to the cranberries because the raspberry jello had sweetner in it. I'm used to eating cranberries ground up with other fruits so maybe I just don't care for them cooked.  I would not make this again.

As described and very easy to prepare. It came out more tart than sweet.  I will make it again.

This was a great jello dish and it had rave reviews by my family.  I did make a few modifications that I'll share.  After the cranberries had boiled for a while and softened, I mashed them.  I tought this would be more preferable than eating them whole as it wouldn't be so tart if you bit into one.  I also added a little more sugar than the recipe called for as well as about 1/4 cup of orange juice.  I added a little less water to compensate for adding the orange juice.  It was delicious and will make it this same way again with the modifications.
