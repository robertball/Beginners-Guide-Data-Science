I have never prepared corned beef before until this past St. Patrick's Day. In fact, the only time I ever had it was "one" time in a military chow hall. Not a good experience. This recipe was easy to prepare and was really good! The recipe didn't state whether to use the spice pack that comes with many corned beef briskets. I assume I was supposed to use it since the recipe doesn't call for any spices at all. The man of the house (who is of Irish background) thought it was very good and has had leftovers two days in a row. He said it reminded him of his Mom, which is a true compliment indeed! We enjoyed the sauce too. Thank you for submitting, Mmnadiv!

My family loved this recipe!  No changes made to it since was my first time making it.  Easy to prepare and cook. Definitely use the season packet that comes with the corned beef. Add a little more salt/pepper for flavor. 

Goes great with cornbread!
Will make this again!

I cooked mine in a slow cooker instead of a dutch oven.  I used a variety pack of fingerling potatoes of varying colors.  I added celery I had left over from a pot roast.  Aside from that, I followed the recipe.  :-)

I thought it was kind of bland, but maybe I added too much water to the crock pot.  Horseradish to the rescue!  Otherwise, it was great!

The mustard sauce was surprisingly good.  I added a little 'Hot and Sweet' mustard to it as I didn't had any horseradish as the author suggested.  
Don't forget to reserve the cooking liquid to make the sauce. I also used some of the cooking liquid to cook the carrots as I didn't want them overcooked.  I would do that again with the cabbage as well.  
Overall, the family was pleased.

Excellent! The sauce combines sour cream for the potatoes and mustard for the corned beef. Delicious!

Another good recipe for corned beef and cabbage from this site.  The sauce is a very nice addition.

First time ever making or even eating this.  We decided to try it and it was fantastic!  The sauce was a really nice topper for the meat and the veggies.  Would highly recommend!

I make this every year and this is the best recipe! The sauce is amazing! For those of you who question whether or not to use the included season packet with the brisket, most definitely, u less you plan on seasoning it yourself.
