This recipie went well beyond my expecations. It was very easy, however, could definately use more flavor, salt definately helps. Also, it would be wise to use a little water when cooking chicken, it tends to become a bit dry (as ususal). I will try to marinade the chicken first, next time, I am sure it would be much more tender if that were done. Don't forget the Basmati Rice!

It would be better to add cooked chicken pieces rather than adding much water to the chicken dish, as it is a dry side dish!
And another suggestion would be to saute the onions first and then add the other ingredients as there are chances of the masala/powders getting burnt!

This was a fast, easy dish to make.  We added water as we cooked because it seemed that things would be too dry without it.
We added more chile pepper than called for, which made it especially hot. Seemed that the dish was too dry, maybe because of the extra pepper I added, but some sort of addition to make it more moist would've been welcomed.

I tried to make it exactly to the recipe except that I also added a splash of fish sauce for saltiness and I would have to give it five stars. I'm not sure if I would or not without the fish sauce though. The onions came out beautifully caramelized and I served it over rice with some fresh vegetables. My kids really enjoyed it too.

this was great, don't worry about the water, I added 1/4 cup and had lots of water when it finished. the trick is to cook at a low temp, it takes a little longer but it was melt in your mouth tender.

Great easy fast dish. Didn't have the nutmeg or cilantro and it still turned out great. Will make it on nights we needs something fast and tasty!

I sautéed the onions first, added sautéed diced tomatoes & red pepper, cut the chilli powder to half a teaspoon & omitted the green chillies but it still came out very spicy. I took out the sautéed veg, fried the chicken in strips, them added all the ingredients bavk into one pan. 

Overall a tasty meal that doesn’t take long to cook. it’s best to prep the ingredients in advance if you can, then it’d be fast to cook. Bon appetite

Very tasty, and very easy. I started with the onions, then added chicken in strips. I only had the garam marsala, and coriender. When it got a little dry I added a little olive oil and a little sweet chili sauce, lowered the temp, added even more garam, and coriender, and ended with a spicy, saucy dish that everyone loved!

Very good. I boiled the chicken beforehand to make it more tender.  Would recommend chopping it up into smaller bites.

I made this last night and it had no flavor. I used all the ingredients and even added a little extra chili pepper and salt and it was still very bland. I make Indian food all the time and I would never make this again.
