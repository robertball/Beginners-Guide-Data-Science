Had to make a few adjustments for my picky eaters.  We left out the onions but added everything else plus peas and carrots, oh and used dried parsley because that's all we had.  The only thing I think I would do different is let the pork cook for a few minutes on it's own and then add the vegetables.  They got very mushy because the pork took a little to long to cook.  But the kids loved it!

Update: We have figured out it's best to just cook the broccoli by itself and add right before serving.  Also, I am a salt lover but we had been using LaChoy soy sauce and it made this way to salty, we now use a low sodium soy sauce for this recipe.  With these changes this is a five star in our house.

I have made this for years now and I make it with a package of frozen california blend (family size) and I use 4 packages of pork ramen noodles and seasoning and increase the water as needed and add soy sauce to your taste. Oh and most importantly, I use pork steaks cut into bite size pieces!!! so yummy!!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!!! It is full of so many flavors and textures. The color is perfect for a summer meal!! I used a pork roast(slow cooked then shreaded) instead of the tenderloin since I don't care for that cut of pork, but other then that it was spectacular!!!!!!

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover pork and this was a perfect find for that use.  It was simple and quite tasty.  However, this wasn't special enough that I would make it without trying to use up the leftovers.

Tasted just like ramen noodles with meat and veggies added. Nothing special.
