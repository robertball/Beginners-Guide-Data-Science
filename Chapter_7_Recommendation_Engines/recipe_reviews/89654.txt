I thought this was pretty good but next time I think I will add a little more garlic and use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, leave out the flour and just allow it to 'cook down'.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe about 4 times in a span on 3 weeks and I love it.
I didn't add any flour to it and pureed 2-3 tomatoes in the blender...so very healthy, very quick ..very very tasty.
My DD likes raw celery and I thought this was easier to eat but she still prefers it raw and didn't care a whole lot for salsa..but my neighbour and her 4 year old loved this. Thank you for this quick tasty recipe!

I made this the other night along with a Beef Curry! Very yummy!! I served rice and maize rice with the two dishes. I made it for my sister because she's vegetarian, but the rest of the family dug in just as much (I came into the kitchen to find my nephew wiping the pot out with a piece of fresh bread I had baked :-)  ) GREAT RECIPE, thanks!

This was pretty good. I used a can of diced tomatoes, which i threw in the food processor for a few seconds to give it the tomato juice consistency. I omitted the flour, since the diced tomatoes were still thick enough to make this a good, chunky salsa. I also added a pinch of dill weed. However, the next day, it began to lose it's flavor, so I can imagine it doesn't keep very well in the fridge. Not a bad salsa substitute, thanks.

I added an obscene amount of pepper on top of this to bring out the taste a bit. It seemed a little bland without it, but the recipe does call for spices to taste, so I can't fault it for that! End product was good, it just might need some doctoring.

I loved it. Perfect textures. The only caution I have is that I added hot pepper sauce to suit my taste while it was cooking, which was perfect, but when it cooled and the sauce soaked in more, it got a little spicier, so I'd add slightly less than you think you actually need. Still yum though. Hubby didn't like it as much--thought it was too sweet.
