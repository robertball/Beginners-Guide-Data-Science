I used the meatball recipe, added a little ground pork, but did not make the eyeballs. Made a huge batch and froze them. Did not measure the ingredients, but pretty foolproof, and probably used more cheese than called for.  :) Very tasty. Great for a quick appetizer, pop them into homemade spaghetti sauce, brown gravy and rice. Have made several times. A winner.

Tripled.  Baked 35-40 minutes at 350 on two trays.  Used large ice cream scoop to make about 27.  Places on white tray, topped with a little spaghetti sauce and a candy eye.
