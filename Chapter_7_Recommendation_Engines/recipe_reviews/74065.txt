This recipe needs some serious tweaking. Even after adding extra fruit, extra milk and even some yogurt it still wasn't very good.

Was not good at all - really lacked a sweetness I thought would come from the strawberries.  Add some sugar???

It was okay at first.  I took out a few ice cubes because our strawberries were so frozen.  Then I added about a cup of plain yogurt and about a tablespoon of vanilla. To sweeten it up I also put about one fourth of a cup of strawberry syrup or a good amount. I made about three servings.

I believe there may be a misprint on this recipe. First, there is not enough milk to make the blender even move, and I have a good quality blender. The other problem is there is no sweetener added at all. As is I rate it about a 1. I am rating it a 3 for potential. I was able to fix it by adding 1/2 cup extra of milk and 2 tsp. of honey. Came pretty close to a 5 star recipe then.

This is a VERY good recipe. It doesn't taste like a smoothie! (In a good way!) Very yummy and delicious. I didn't give any to my family I just ate it all!

Awful.  Not enough liquid to blend smoothly, so I added 1/2 and that made it the right consistency, but it lacked flavor.  Disappointing and won't make again.

I ENJOYED THIS, AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FIVE STARS, BUT, I LIKE MY SMOOTHIES SWEET. I FOUND THIS NOT TO MY TOTAL LIKING BECAUSE OF THIS UNTIL I ADDED SOME SPLENDA, THEN IT WAS QUITE GOOD. WILL BE MAKING IT AGAIN.
