An all time favorite! My husband begged for me to make this again. Great, hearty meal to warm you up on a chilly day. Cheap and quick to make in bulk to freeze for those too crazy to cook days (this is a go to on our menu of bulk to make before baby arrives). Hint: a can of condensed cream of celery/chicken soup will make it creamier to change things up a bit if you make this a lot.

This is a keeper. It's also flexible. I used 12 oz. of uncured chorizo instead of smoked sausage or kielbasa. (Note that Bibi's original recipe includes kielbasa in the ingredient list, and here mentions it in Direction 2.) And 12 oz. was plenty for my purposes. (BTW, the smoked sausage and kielbasa products I saw in stores were all 12-oz packages. There weren't any 20-oz. packages, nor any of the uncured versions I would have preferred.) I also used canola oil, unpeeled red potatoes, and only the pale green cabbage leaves that are just below the unsalvageable dark green outer leaves (so no white inner leaves, either). I used 1 cup of unsalted chicken broth along with 4 cups of water â€“ all of which I drained completely away in a colander after cooking because I was only interested in the meat and vegetables, not the broth! (Plus I wanted to lose some of the chorizo's salt.) The results looked very much like Bibi's own photo. I also drizzled on some EVOO. Delicious and satisfying. From start to finish, 70 min. on my first try. I think any sausage labeled as "fully cooked" could work here.

I did not use avacado oil but used EVOOO. I will make this again. As good as "Cabbage Soup" but more hardy. Served with southern style cornbread. It would also be good with a crusty bread.
