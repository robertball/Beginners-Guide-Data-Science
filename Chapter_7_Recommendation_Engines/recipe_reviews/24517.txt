Wow Tim----Instead of raving, maybe the following scenario will tell you how I feel, regarding your cornbread recipe.  Last week I'd made a tried and true version, and popped the leftovers into my freezer.  Yesterday I tried your version, and proceeded to throw out what I had stored in my freezer from the prior week!  Yes, your version was that good!  My only tweakings were that I baked it in an 8 x 8 pan, and I added 1/2 tsp salt to the recipe.  Baked it for 25 minutes, and your recipe was the hit of my dinner!  The combination of cream with the oil yielded flavor and moistness. I don't think I need to try any other cornbread recipe.  This one will be made into muffins, cornbread, cornsticks, etc. many many times. 
Best wishes,
Jeff

Nice fluffy cornbread, not too crumbly, not too stiff.  I subbed 3/4 C milk and 1/3 C melted butter for the cream, as I didn't have any.  Turned out well with just the right hint of honey, not too overpowering.  Thanks

This IS the BEST cornbread on the site.  I will look no further!  I followed the recipe to the t, made no changes and it is perfect ('cept I had to cook it longer, but that's nothing).  Everyone said this is the best cornbread I've made from scratch yet (and I've made over 5 already from this site with 5 stars and 200+ ratings).  Thank you Tim!  P.S. I don't get reviews that only give 4 stars when they themselves say it's, "the best".  Beats me.

This is a great recipe. I tasted the baking powder so I'll scale it down to 2-1/2 tsp next time I cook it.  I used 2 percent milk instead of the cream.  Also, I felt it needed a little salt, so I'll start our with 1/2 teaspoon next time. All in all, I think the basic recipe lays the foundation for a great Cornbread.

Well, apparently this cornbread recipe can make cornbread lovers out of cornbread haters (Hubs).  Have to believe it's partly because this one is sweet, which he mentioned right away that he noticed and liked.  I added a minced jalapeno pepper and a cup of shredded pepper jack cheese, both of which were perfect fits for the sweeter cornbread. Nice balance of cornmeal and flour so that while these had a bold, cornmeal flavor, they were still light, fluffy and moist.  I also think this definitely needed the 1/2 tsp. salt I added to make the flavor come alive - it was glaringly missing from the recipe. This made 12, plump and nicely rounded muffins, perfectly golden and a little crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside - 400 degrees, about 19-20 minutes.

This was the best ever. I had been looking for a sweet corn bread recipe and this was it. After the first bite I looked at my husband and told him that we had found the recipe we will always use.

Since I didn't have heavy cream I just used milk and I added extra honey. It turned out great. Very sweet. I enjoyed eating it soaked in milk.

This was a fabulous recipe!  I used white, rising cornmeal and baked it in a cast iron pan.  It wasn't too crumbly or too sweet.  It was just right!

Hi Tim, I just wanted to thank you for this recipe. I am not known for my cooking ability but I made this for a dinner with friends and they all thought this was the BEST cornbread ever. It was so easy to follow! Thanks again and Happy Thanksgiving!- Jennifer

Love it, this is a great and SIMPLE cornbread recipe.  I had just used up all my honey the day before, so I just added an extra 1/8 cup of sugar in its place.  And actually, I think the bread would have been fine with only the 1/4 C. of sugar or the honey, either one on its own would have provided plenty of sweetness.  But it still turned out fantastic.  The only other thing I did differently was I added about 2/3 C. of sour cream.  I came across a recipe several years ago and had yogurt added, and ever since I can't stand to eat a cornbread that doesn't have either that or sour cream in it.  It comes out SUPER moist!  Oh...and I did not have heavy whipping cream on hand, so I subbed in buttermilk for that.  I was still thick and rich enough, and it tasted phenomenal.  I guess I did make more than one change!  But I kept everything pretty much the same.  I think recipe you can sort of do that with...the ingredients are very simple, and you can play around with different liquids and sweeteners to suit your tastes.  I did only bake mine at 375 rather than 400 just to make sure the edges didn't bake before the center.  I seem to have that problem sometimes when I go up to 400 degrees.

One of the better sweet cornbread recipes I've tried. I gave four stars rather than five because while it was moist and had great texture right after baking, the next day it was quite dry and crumbly. Wouldn't stop me from making it again, I'd just plan to not have leftovers :)

Overall, very nice cornbread that's slightly sweet and more traditional in flavor.  I used 1 & 1/4 cup of cornmeal and 3/4 cup of flour. I reduced the baking powder ot 2 tsp. and used buttermilk instead of heavy cream.  I also used 1/4 cup of melted butter vs. veg. oil.  This baked up nice and brown on top in 20 minutes.  This is a great side for a BBQ meal and the leftovers are great for breakfast with butter or jam!

Very Good cornbread.  Baked on spur of the moment, I didn't have cream on hand so I used half & half.  I decided to bake in my cast iron skillet, never have done that b4-I've always made muffins in the past.  I will make this again.

A nice, sweet cornbread! For an even moister version, I mix equal parts honey and butter and brush it on top as soon as it comes out of the oven. Generally I make individual muffins. Perfect for our summer BBQ every year!

This has become my favorite cornbread recipe. I've found that half and half,buttermilk,or whole milk works just fine instead of the cream.

The 4 star rating is for the actual recipe as posted.  The taste is fantastic, but it was just too crumbly for me.  So fiddled with the recipe some to get it bind better.  I recommend doubling the amount of egg.  This really helped hold the cornbread together for me.  Now its 5 stars!!

Good cornbread if you like it on the sweeter side.  I love honey, so enjoyed the flavor.  This is definitely best served hot with butter.  Didn't have cream so just used the skim (!) milk on hand and it came out fine.  Doubled the recipe and made in 13x9 pan.  Went a little light on the sugar and might used less next time.  Very nice with our stew.

This is now my go-to cornbread recipe. Wow was it ever good. I used 2% milk instead of the heavy cream simply because I did'nt have any cream on hand. Also maybe just a hint of salt next time. The honey added a wonderful twist and its crazy good with a bowl of chili. Thank you!

Wow.  My boyfriend grew up in Virginia and he was shocked to discover that this Northern girl made the best cornbread he has ever tasted using this recipe.  I used the suggestion someone else made earlier about substituting 3/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup butter for the cream.  Worked well

This recipe is unbelievable! I don't like cornbread but, I decided to make it to go with my chili for dinner because my daughter loves it...The recipe was so easy to make I let my 5 year old help with it. As soon as it was done, we tried it and now I have to make more for dinner because my kids devoured the pan already...Even I liked it! I also didn't have the cream on hand, so I substituted the 3/4C milk with 1/3 butter. I will be making this recipe all the time... Thank You.

I have yet to find the perfect cornbread recipe, until now! I've tried several recipes on this site, and no matter what, they always come out dry and crumbly.  This recipe is moist and lovely. Thank you Tim, I will use this recipe forever and ever!

I have made three or four different cornbread recipes on this site.  This one is my favorite!  Very moist and just a touch of sweetness.  I didn't have heavy cream, so I substituted with 1/4 c. melted butter and 3/4 c. milk.  Turned out great!  We'll be making this again -- goes great with the Slow Cooker Chili.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it came out moist, delicious, and not at all too crumbly. As previous reviewers recommended, I added 1/2 tsp of salt. Also, I baked the batter in a muffin pan for about 14 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Excellent recipe, will be using this from now on.

I made this recipe for a barbecue I had recently and it came out perfectly sweet, crumbly, and moist.   This will be my standard cornbread from now on.  It is so good it made my mom want to slap herself!  

I made a few small changes, substituting  ¾ cup milk ¼ cup butter for the heavy cream, and used a preheated cast iron skillet in lieu of the 9x9 baking pan.

Awesome....just awesome!!! I made this for my Southern in-laws, and they LOVED it! Very moist and light cornbread. If you like just a little sweetness in your cornbread, this is for you! My batter felt a little stiff for cornbread batter, but my cornbread cupcakes came out beautifully!

Hubby liked it much better than the box mix. He doesn't always comment on food, but this got his attention. He even had some for breakfast the next morning.

I made this tonight to go with Easy Chicken Enchiladas.  The enchiladas were great, but the corn bread was less than stellar. I was excited to try it because so many had given it 5 stars.  I did it exactly as written and it was not tasty at all.  I think it just needs salt.  It was very disappointing.  We will take the leftovers to the duck pond tomorrow for the ducks.  I am extra disappointed because I doubled the recipe, hoping for a 5 star recipe.

I used buttermilk instead of heavy cream. YUM! I think it works well with how sweet the bread is. I also used gluten free all-purpose flour and erythritol sweetener in place of the sugar. Worked perfectly for those with allergies or special needs. I served these with the Colorado Buffalo Chili from this site. Awesome! Top a piece with some grated Cheddar cheese and pop it in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Oh man! That alone is heavenly!

This is an awesome corn bread recipe!  I have made it many times, and it always turns out great!  I especially love it straight out of the oven!  I have made it using a 9 x 9 inch pan and also using a muffin tin.  For muffins, 15-17 minutes at the same temperature worked perfectly!  This is definitely my go-to for corn bread!

I have made this recipe.  But I made it a little different this time.  I use 1/2 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of apple sauce for the oil.  I also changed the heavy cream for 1% milk. It has been a hit with my family very since. It is always hit in my house.

Not that I have much experience with cornbread, but I really don't know how it could be better than this. I substituted milk for the cream and added 1/2 cup honey and omitted the sugar because I don't like overly sweet stuff and the honey flavor is better anyway. The texture and flavor were both great--perfectly moist and delicious.

I had the most amazing cornbread at my Southern themed wedding, and I wanted to attempt to mimic it.  This recipe isn't exact, but it was pretty close.  I really like it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it is good just the way it is.   I'm sure I will make this again.  I save my 5 stars for the most amazing dishes I have ever put in my mouth, and this one didn't have as much wow factor as some, so I'm only giving 4 stars, which I still consider very respectable.

Excellent cornbread!  I thought this was delicious.  It reminded me of Marie Callanders cornbread.  It was moist, sweet of course from the honey and everyone loved it.  The first time around, I did make the mistake of tripling it for a large group to go with a big pot of chili.  It took much longer to bake obviously and then never cooked all the way through in the middle.  So I should have lowered the temp a little and left it in longer.  But when I did it the second time, it was perfect and I doubled it in a large cake pan.  Adding a little more time to it of course.

Hands down the best cornbread recipe I ever made.  We like ours a bit sweeter.  I cut the recipe in half and it made 6 muffin cups...I like portion control.  Awesome recipe, I'll be making these often.

these were pretty ok, but still a bit dry. In the future I think I will let the cornmeal soak up the milk or cream for a bit first. And possibly trying to double the honey, I could barely taste it. these did go good with pumpkin creamcheese though :)

I wish I could give four and a half stars. I used butter in place of the oil and buttermilk in place of the cream. I wish I'd added more than a half tsp. of salt. I think that's what it's missing. It's not too sweet, it's not overly dry. It would have been better with more salt. After it came out of the oven, I did brush the top with butter. I'll make this again only with a full tsp. of salt.

Absolutely delicious. I used milk instead of cream to save calories, and used half oil/half water instead of full oil. Still awesome, this will probably be the recipe I use from here on. I made a corndog casserole type dish from adding a package of chopped veggie hot dogs and a handful of cheddar. I will make again.

I just made this cornbread and it is so good! The honey really adds something to it. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I think it's missing a little something..a pinch of salt, which I will try next time. Otherwise, best cornbread ever!!!

Very light and sweet with subtle honey overtures; bakes beautifully. You might need to eat this with a fork though, as pieces are so light, they do not hold when you pick them up.

This was a huge hit with the whole family! I didn't have heavy cream so I used 2/3 milk + 1/3 butter, as suggested by another reviewer. I can't wait to try this again with the cream, though!

Very, very good honey cornbread.  One of the best I've made with a few substitutions: (1) egg beaters, (2) canola oil and (3) almond milk instead of heavy cream.  I will definitely be making these again!

Delish!  My only change was to use Gluten Free Mama's Almond Blend instead of regular wheat flour.  These were spectacular!  We ate them with honey butter.

This was quite good. I did add a little extra flower and substituted the oil with applesauce. I also decreased the sugar.  It did not come out too crumbly

This is the best tasting cornbread by far.  I just do not like how crumbly it was.  I like a stronger bread.  Do not get me wrong but it does hold its shape.  Thanks for the formula.

I used 2% milk and this was still amazing. I can only imagine how good it would have been if I had actually used cream. Be prepared to for the massive temptation to over-indulge!

This was FABULOUS!!!!! This was my first time making cornbread and it turned out wonderful. My husband who doesn't even like cornbread....does now! I used whole grain flour instead of white, only used 2 tsp baking powder, and added about 2 tsp of salt. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully. Very moist and delicious!!!

Wow, simply wow.  I did add a bit of salt and had to substitute 3/4 C whole milk and 1/4 C melted butter since I did not have heavy cream and it was still amazing,  Nice crispy top.  I baked it in an 8 inch round pan for 25 minutes and it is just right.  Thanks for the recipe, I am deleting all my other cornbread recipies as they are no longer needed.

This was really good and my dad kept coming back for more haha. Right out of the oven, it smelt like heaven and was soooooo soft! But the next day, it had turned crumbly. So I guess you gotta eat this one then and there.

This is truly a wonder.  I have substituted melted butter for the oil (and had rave reviews from my husband who said he could live off of them) and also substituted 1/3 cup melted butter with 3/4 cup of milk for the heavy cream when I don't have any on hand and it still turns out fabulously.  I cook them in a mini-loaf pan (making 12 tiny corn cakes) for 18 minutes and they are fluffy and delicious!

This was fabulous! Agree with making it in an *X* pan for a little more thickness. After I took it out of the oven, I poked it with a fork and spread more honey over the top of it. It tastes as good as Dinosaur BBQ's recipe. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Really good cornbread. I made these as muffins by sprinkling some rosemary and frozen corn on top and then baking them for 18 minutes. Yielded 12 muffins.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is, by far, the best cornbread I have ever had. I will be deleting all other cornbread recipes in my recipe box. So moist, so delicate, so delicious! Followed recipe exactly, except I baked it in a 9" pie plate. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to add an extra TBSP of sugar, as my hubby said it wasn't quite sweet enough. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!! I will make this many, many times.

"Yankee" cornbread huh?  Well, I'm a Yankee and I do love this recipe!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and subsituted creamed corn for the heavy cream.  Cut fat and calories and tasted great!  I hope to enter this in my State Fair next year.  Thanks Tim for submitting a fabulous recipe!

This was a very good recipe. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used Fat Free half & half, I wasn't sure if it would work but it turned out just fine, very nice texture. I also added 1/2 tsp salt. I didn't have a 9x9 pan so I used an 8x8 and it was the perfect size. It is most definitely one of the best cornbreads I have ever made. Thanks!

YUM!  Most cornbread seems really dense to me, but this one was airy and light.  Mild flavor that worked great as muffins (15 minutes at same temperature).  Will definitely make again!

Hands down, this has got to be the best cornbread recipe around!!!  It's so moist with the right amount of sweet. If you like your cornbread like "cake" then this is the BEST.  Thank you Tim L. for sharing this fabulous recipe!!!

We loved this recipe!! I followed it exactly....except I poured the batter in a greased muffin tin rather than make a loaf....makes it easier to just 'grab and go'. Thanks Tim.....it's a 'keeper' for us!

This is incredible. I am eating it right now, warm and delicious. This is the best cornbread I have ever had. 5 guys are also raving about it as they eat. We don't like whole corn in cornbread so omitted that.

Really good! I found it a bit too sweet. Since the honey gives great flavor, I'd cut the white sugar in half. Works fine with milk instead of cream.

I accidentally doubled the sugar called for in this recipe, and it STILL wasn't quite sweet enough or honey-tasting enough for me.  When I ate it I poured honey on my piece and then it was good.  If you like cornbread really sweet, add more honey or sugar.

This cornbread is perfect as is. If you’re looking for a slightly sweet and moist cornbread. That’s exactly what I was looking for and got. I wouldn’t change it a bit. This recipe is a keeper.

Super good. Almost tastes like sweet cake. I added more sugar (brown sugar) and it came out beautiful! It browned quickly half way thru because of the honey but I just put a pixel of aluminum foil on top and turned the oven down to 375

I use melted butter and half can of corn.
I like creamed but my son likes whole kernels.
Either way it's delicious. It's moist and crumbly with the perfect amount of sweetness. If you use brown sugar cut back on amount. Enjoy

Meh.  Not that great.  I've made a lot of cornbread and this was just not that great.  The texture wasn't super, kinda crumbly.  Flavour was fine but I added salt.  I won't make again.

Made this tonight and it went over well with my grandma (who loves cornbread and is a very picky eater). I didn't use vegetable, I used a bit of coconut oil and a bit of smart balance and added an extra touch of cream. It could have used some extra honey, and I'll probably add extra next time, but overall this was good. Even I ate some, and I don't even like cornbread.

My whole family really loved this corn bread!  I only did 4 stars because I changed it up a bit.  I added 1/2 teaspoon salt, I also lowered the oven temp to 350 degrees and baked the corn bread for 35 minutes. I also poked holes in the bread after it cooled for 10 minutes and poured a mix of melted butter and honey (1/4 cup of each)over the top of the bread.  So good!  Thanks for the base recipe!

I've made this many times and it's wonderful!  Only 2 changes...gluten free flour (husband can't eat wheat) and melted butter instead of oil (personal preference). Best cornbread I've ever made!

I tried this recipe tonight and it was lackluster. I was excited because of all of the reviews but it was bland and you can barely taste the honey. I had to put butter on it just to have some flavor. Thank you for sharing, it just didn't work out for me.

This had the potential to win me over. The absence of salt in the recipe perplexes me as it enhances flavor and counters sweetness. Not a deal-breaker, I added 1/2 tsp of salt. It came out soft and just sweet enough but it was too crumbly for my taste, even after letting it cool. This was absolutely tasty and easy to make, but I will be trying a different recipe next time because I like my cornbread to not turn into breadcrumbs on top of my chili.

Overall a great cornbread... I would add a bit more honey to it to make it a little sweeter. It is better when warm, but still tastes very good cold. Thanks for this recipe!

Yummy.  I substituted milk for cream (1 cup) and added 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also added 1/2 t sea salt.  It only took my muffins 17 minutes to bake, so watch the time.

I give this recipe four stars as written, because we found it way too sweet. However, if you cut the sugar in half (1/8 cup instead of 1/4), it's a solid 4.5 stars. Thanks for the recipe!

it really didnt have flavor and what it had was.. I did exactly what the recipe said to do and I had everything down but it just wasnt sweet and it was dry and crumbly and lacking quite a bit.

This is a great recipe, but it definatley needs salt. At least 1 teaspoon. I spread some salted butter on the cornbread and it made a huge difference, and I also added 1 cup thawed frozen corn to the batter before cooking.  I will be making this again.....but next time, with the salt!!

I never made cornbread from scratch before and was looking for a nice recipe to begin with. I am very glad I stumbled upon this one because it turned out perfect and is very delicious. I made chili and we had this on the side. With the leftover cornbread we actually saved it for the next day and warmed it up in the microwave for a few seconds with a pat of butter on it and some fresh honey drizzled on top. It was divine. I will use this recipe from now on as I enjoyed it and had zero complaints from the family.

I really wish I could give this 5 stars. I decided to make this cornbread after researching many for a Superbowl Party to serve with my Chili.  I was excited because the recipe called for honey.  Which was exactly what I was looking for.  Unfortunatly what I found was a flavor lacking cornbread. I followed the recipe to the letter which is probably where I went wrong. I made the recipe again with just a couple of minor adjustments and I am happy to say...YUM!!!My suggestions are as follows: Need to add salt (1 teaspoon) and increase the sugar to either 1/2 or 2/3 depending on how sweet you want it.

Made this almost exactly per the recipe, except that I used half & half instead of heavy cream because that was what I had.  I thought it was ok, but not my favorite recipe.  It cooked up beautifully and I liked that it wasn't too crumbly, but the flavor and texture left a little to be desired.

Loved it! I have only ever made boxed cornbread and stepped out on faith on this one. Everyone loved it and told me that they liked it way better than the boxed stuff. Now I don't know what to do with my two last boxes of Jiffy. Guess I'll bless my mother-in-law with them.

I made these as muffins. They had a light honey flavor that my boyfriend liked a lot! Next time I will readjust the time/temp b/c it wasn't as moist as I'd like them to be in the middle.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but I didn't like this cornbread recipe.  It just didn't taste good to me which surprised me because I'm southern and I love sweet cornbread.  But even with both honey and sugar I just didn't like it.  In the recipes defense, this is only the 2nd time I've attempted cornbread and the first time didn't go so well either.

Awesome!  I was looking for a sweet corn muffin recipe, this was it.  Only changes I made, butter instead of oil, had no heavy cream - used skim milk I had, doubled the sugar!  Really sweet - really great!!!! Family loves em, this will be our cornbread recipe of choice!  I made muffins (my muffin pan is older and they were a little smaller but made 39 muffins) cooked for 13 min on 400 degrees.

Very good recipe. I made it exactly as it appears and it was delicious. I didn't have cream OR cornmeal and I went out on a limb and used a can of creamed corn instead or cornmeal and and cream.  It was PERFECT.  Try this variation for a cornier taste!

I really enjoyed this cornbread, which almost tastes like pound cake.  I paired it with chili, and it was a bit too sweet for that.  It is VERY crumbly, so just be prepared for that. But the taste is fantastic and it is very moist unlike a lot of cornbreads out there.  I would make it again as muffins to pair with some type of meat for breakfast.

Best.  Cornbread.  Ever.  I've made it to go with chili several times.  The left overs are great with soup the next day.  (If there are any.)  This is a new stand by recipe in my home.  Thanks!

This was the most incredible cornbread I have ever tasted! It was soft, and had a great texture! It even stayed soft after bing put in the fridge for a couple days! I did change a couple things, but they weren't too extreme. 

I used half & half instead of the heavy cream as others had mentioned. I also changed it from the 1/4 cup white sugar to 1/4 cup of Sugar Twin sweetener (I had my diabetic grandparents over for dinner that day). 

I served it in a 9 inch pie glass pie dish.

Everyone said it was the best cornbread they had every eaten!! Tasted great!! I will be making this again! This is the only cornbread recipe a person needs!

I hope I just made a mistake baking these, or maybe my cornmeal was too old, can it lose flavor??  It needed salt, flavor was bland and too dry.  Looked beautiful though.

A simple but very delicious recipe! I do believe that instead of using ¼ cup of sugar, I used ½ the first time. And right before measuring your honey, you should measure the oil that way the honey just slides right out! The second time I made it, it was not as sweet as the first time. That’s how I concluded that I probably added more sugar than called for. Also halfway through cooking, I found that  my oven was quite hot at 400 and almost burned the tops, so I lowered the oven to 350 the last 10 minutes of cooking. All ovens are different though, so adjust accordingly.

Very good.   A little sweeter than most cornbread recipes we've tried, but we liked it that way. I made these into muffins and they turned out perfectly domed and very moist.

Loved this recipe, best tasting cornbread I've ever had to date.  The only thing I did different was I added a couple of finely chopped jalapeno peppers because I love jalapenos in cornbread.  Great recipe Tim, thanks for sharing.

I made this for the first time last night - actually doubled the recipe. Followed the recipe as is and it was fantastic. Very light and fluffy and the honey added a wonderful flavor. Will definitely keep this as my cornbread recipe for the future.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe, only subbing coconut oil for the vegetable, since I didn't have any. Personally, I found it a little too sweet, but the hubby and kids loved it...and my kids (I have 6) usually don't like cornbread.  I want to play with it, some, and use milk instead of cream, to try to cut the fat some, but all in all, this is a keeper! I made it in a round 9" pan, and the texture and consistency were great. My husband thought I should put cream cheese frosting on it, and serve it as cake, lol!

I added frozen corn to the recipe. I came out ok. Would have liked it to be sweeter. Maybe next time I'll add a bit more honey.

They were good, but not as tasty as I had hoped after testing the batter.  I made one small change - replaced one of the eggs with about 1/2 C of sweet corn.  They're good, but very, VERY crumbly.

I really thought this was "the recipe" since it has such awesome reviews.  My family loves cornbread, but they wouldn't even eat this.  It was bland, blah and fell apart when we put took it out of the pan.  I thought I had done something wrong, but after review, I made it exactly according to the recipe.  I lost my normal recipe so thought I would try this, not again for sure.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, so don't follow my rating.  I just wanted to post a "heads-up" to others who may try the recipe.  I substituted polenta for corn flour because it's what I had on hand, but don't do this!  Polenta has a more coarse texture than flour and, as it turns out, does not bake the same way.  The taste was fine, but the consistency was very crumbly and hard to eat.  So note: follow the recipe!

Okay, this was really good. I mean REALLY good, and it's definitely a keeper. But I'm on Weight Watchers and at 8 points a serving, the recipe as written is just too indulgent. So after the initial go, I decided to make a couple of changes to make it a little more weight-friendly. Instead of heavy whipping cream, I used fat free evaporated milk. I also cut the white sugar in half. It was still plenty sweet enough for me (plus, I shaved 2 points off per serving). I also added 1/4 t. salt just because I think baked goods are just better with a little salt. Very yummy. Sure beats Jiffy mix!

Awesome recipe. When I make changes to an existing recipe, I rate according to how well it took my substitutions *grin*.  Substituted same amount of milk for heavy cream because that's all I had on hand. I also made this into muffins, for neater eating.  Makes a perfect dozen corn muffins with no extra batter left over.  They crested so nicely.  Next time, I will add some salt to the batter for taste.  Great recipe!

I've been living in the South, but I have not found any other cornbread better than this one! It is amazing as is, but I've experimented with a few other substitutions. To make it a little more moist and with texture, I substitute one egg with one can of creamed corn. Delicious! My batches never last more than two days. To make it with a little more kick, I add a tsp of tabasco sauce and minced jalapenos. A great addition to any meal.

Really good ! I've tried several AllRecipes cornbread recipes; some are quite dense, but this recipe is a bit more on the lighter side. For the cream, I used a 170 ml (5.7 oz) can of Thick Cream (25% m.f.), and topped up with Coffee Cream (18% m.f., "Half-and-Half" in the US). I used an 11 x 7-in. baking dish. Great accompaniment to the Wazzu Tailgate Chili recipe !

We have made this a couple of times, and it is simply delightful.  We have made it with milk (once) and buttermilk (once) rather than cream, as we didn't have any on hand - still came out great.  I've baked it in a square baking pan, and also "Southern Style" in a cast-iron skillet (in the oven).  It comes out great no matter what...

A-Mazing.  Everyone LOVED this.  I didnt have any cream so  I used 1/4 cup lite butter and 3/4 cup milk.  It was so pretty when it came out of the oven.  I tried a small slice with butter.  It was yuuum.  I tried a small slice with a honey butter mixture and it was yuuuum yummmm.  I also put a piece cut in half in the bottom of my bowl of 15 bean soup.  And later, I had a piece with nothing on it at all.  It was all so very good.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Very good! This is the one I was looking for! I took cues from the others and added some salt. I also had to use regular milk and butter for the cream, but it is absolutely fabulous. This will be "my" cornbread recipe from now on.

This cornbread was nicely sweetened but for me, a bit too crumbly. I like the cake-y type of cornbread like at Marie Callender's or Claim Jumper restaurants.  I made these in cupcake tins, doubled the recipe- they didn't rise much, but I also put some in mini-muffin pans and they rose nicely. I don't know if it was the cupcake liner that had something to do with it. I'm still on the search I think! Good and easy recipe in a pinch though.

This recipe is definitely 5 star even though I didn't have any cream. All I had was 1% milk. Next time I will try to have cream on hand, because I'm sure they're better that way. But try this recipe anyway, even if you don't have cream on hand. Also, I took the advice of other reviewers and added a scant 1/2 teaspoon of salt. These are great corn muffins!

Great recipe.  The first time I tried it I wanted it to be more moist--next time I added a combined 1/4 cup of milk and honey and it was perfect.

This cornbread is heavenly. It doesn't fall apart when you bite into it. Wonderful texture. This is the only recipe I will ever use.

Definitely "Yankee" style cornbread--light, fluffy, and very sweet.  Will keep searching for a better recipe.

Really good, super easy. Texture was great from my point of view. As some have said, butter on top while serving hot definitely adds to it, though it's certainly moist enough not to need it. And if (IF!) there's any left over, it's almost as good the next day after nuking on med. for a few seconds, and then of course, a bit more butter on top.

I subbed 1 cup of fat free yogurt for the heavy cream, and 1/4 cup of EVOO for the veg oil.  Also added a little sea salt.  This is a keeper!  Light, and just enough sweet and crumbly.  YUM!

I added actual corn to the recipe, substituted most of the cream for milk, added a bit more honey. My husband... raved over it, and he isn't much of a raver...  It was a bit crumbly, but I like my cornbread like that :)

it was wonderful.i made two batches one from a box and one from scratch but everyone loved these. i added orange honey for a little twist they disappeared before anyone had seconds. i used royall's tips but added the sugar recommended from the recipe because i like it sweet and creamed a little of the butter and honey to spread over the top. while it was still a little warm. yum. thanks for the recipe. and if your in a rush jiffy works just as well if you don't want to make it from scratch.

I've been looking for a recipe that is like what my mom used to make. This isn't it but it is close. I read the reviews and made the following changes. Used a shy 1/4c of sugar (didn't want it too sweet), added 1tsp of salt, (next time I'll cut back to 1/2tsp.) Used 3/4c of milk and a 1/3c salted butter instead of the cream, and cut the oven temperature back to 375* for the last 5 minutes of the bake. Texture is what I remember from mom's but the flavor isn't what I remembered but still VERY GOOD! Next time I'll shorten up a little more on the sugar and add a little more honey. Thanks for a great recipe Tim. ***Update*** I was still looking for a clone of what Mom used to make. Well I found it at last! Had a friend moving back to the mainland (he's from the south) and made a big pot of Black eyed peas and ham hock and a doubled recipe of this cornbread. This time I used the full amount of sugar left out the honey, and added a heaping tsp of salt. (remember, this is a doubled recipe). The taste and texture is just what I remember from Mom's cornbread! There are times when "sweet" cornbread just doesn't fit in. I am a happy camper now!!

This was delicious!  I didn't do a thing to change the recipe.  It was my first time making homemade cornbread.  It turned out moist, sweet, and perfect!  This is a recipe I will make time and time again.  Thank you, Tim!

It was fairly good...the recipe definitely needs salt though! And for our tastes, I think the flour to corn meal ratio is too low. More flour, less corn meal for a somewhat softer texture. Just a little too crumbly for us. I'd probably go 1 1/4 cups flour to 3/4 cup cornmeal or maybe 1 1/2 to 1/2 ratio.  The overall flavor is pretty good though. The honey is a nice touch and the bread isn't too sweet. Just that little bit of salt would really help round out the sweetness and give some depth.  Oh, and definitely make it in a 9x9, not an 8x8 because the 8x8 takes too long for the center to get done and by then your edges get a little too brown and dry.  Super easy recipe though...thanks!

Bland flavor, so crumbly there wasn't an actual "piece" to be taken out of the pan.  I followed the recipe to the T.  It needs butter first of all and probably more honey to give it a flavor.

Awesome Cornbread!!  I am so glad I have finally found a recipe from scratch that rivals any mix I've ever tried.  This is the best cornbread I've ever eaten.  I made it last night and it was a super hit.  I will put this recipe in my "KEEPER" file.  I must confess I didn't have any heavy cream so I followed the suggestion of another member who used milk and butter mixture.  It worked out fine.  I can't wait to try it with the heavy cream.  Thanks again for sharing this with everyone.

Really great recipe and easy to follow! The cornbread came out a beautiful color and moist.  Like other reviewers, I subbed 2% milk for the cream (that's all I had), and added a bit more honey.  I actually used a Jiffy corn muffin mix (how this project started) instead of plain cornmeal and it worked well.  Because there is a small amt of baking powder in the mix, I used 1/3tsp vs. 1tsp stated.  Will definitely make this again!

Perfect!!  Moist and sweet, not crumbly at all.  Just baked this one and love it.  The only thing i ended up doing was lowering the temp. to 375 about 5 min. before it was done.  Best cornbread ever!!! thanks

I found this cornbread to be bland in flavor.  I realized after trying it that there was no salt anywhere in the recipe.  This might help.  Somehow, though, I think using honey instead of all sugar kind of diluted the overall flavor.  I won't make it again.

Hmmmm...I followed this recipe almost exactly (using 2% milk instead of heavy cream) and was not impressed. I thought the texture was perfect - not crumbly as others has found - but it was rather bland.

delicious!  I substituted melted coconut oil for the vegetable oil and used only the egg yolks, no whites (due to allergies).  I also used whole milk instead of cream and added an extra splash of honey.  So yummy!

Just what you think homemade cornbread should be.  I only used 1/4 cup white sugar as I wanted the honey flavor to be stronger and it was still plenty sweet.  I also doubled the recipe and adjusted the cooking time.  Perfect -- thank you for this recipe.

Very tasty cornbread.  It is definitely sweet like stated.  Not overpowering though, just different.  This only bad part (and I know most would say this is a good thing) is just how crumbly it was.  We couldn't hold it to dip it in our soup because it would just fall apart.  Still very good though.

this was by far the best cornbread recipe I've tried. Better than Homesteader.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used milk.  I thought the honey gave it a great flavor and it wasn't crumbly but moist with just a hint of sweetness.  Will definitely make again.

This was the best cornbread I've made! I substituted milk for the heavy cream as  as I didn't have any on hand. Will make with the cream next time. Thanks!!

This is delicious, though next time I'll cut the sugar down a very small bit. Perfectly soft and slightly grainy, it was a good contrast and "soaker" for our chili. My little guy loved it warmed with butter and honey the next morning for breakfast, too.

I'm sorry, I didn't really like this recipe. It was very dry and pretty bland. I ended up using most of it for stuffing because no one was eating it. It did make decent stuffing:-) Adding some milk and sugar might help, but I don't think I'll make this one again.

This is a great recipe.  The texture is superb, and the honey taste is discreet yet distinct.  However, I discovered that I personally don't care for a honey flavor in my cornbread :)  Serve it hot slathered with butter.  Mmmm.

Very good.  I didn't have heavy cream so used the subsitute of milk & butter.(this isn't going to help my cholesterol very much) May try just using milk, but if it isn't as good will have to go back to original recipe.  Will make again though.

Excellent - it seems most cornbread recipes are either the traditional crumbly dry no sugar variety or are so sweet and soft that they should be dessert. I'd been looking for a happy medium and found it here. I might some day play around with replacements for the cream (since it's kind of expensive and I don't always have it on hand) but I'm not messing with any of the other ingredients.

Horrible!  Complete lack of flavor.  I added salt to bring out the honey taste & neither shined through.  I'll print this just to make sure I don't accidentally do a recipe search & make it again.

Made this to the T. 
The only thing missing, in my opinion, is salt.
Other than that, It went great with my butter beans today.

This was excellent! My daughter is very picky about her cornbread, and this is the one she says is closest to her grandma's, and we all love it! I had to substitute 3/4 c. milk and 1/3 c. melted butter for the heavy cream like another reviewer had said, since I didn't have any either-- but it came out great! Used my 8x8 pan & baked for 27 minutes-- perfection. Thank you so much for this recipe! We will enjoy it often!

Delicious! Not too crumbly, perfectly browned after 25 minutes at 375 degrees.
I halved the sugar but next time will omit as I think the honey is enough sweetness.
No cream so I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted 3/4 cup skim and 1/4 cup melted butter.
Had this cornbread with Black Bean and Salsa soup on this site.

Delicious!!!! I didn't have cream so i used what i had on hand. instead of the cream I did 1/2 cup of oat milk, 1/4 cup of nut pods non-dairy creamer, and 1/4 cup of melted butter. Best corn bread I've tried. perfectly firm and just crumbly enough without it getting everywhere. It melts in your mouth and is great with honey butter or herb butter. I can't wait to make this again. So easy to prepare!

I made it into muffins, this recipe yielded 18 small muffins that didn’t overflow. I baked them for 16 minutes. Although they were moist, not enough flavor, so next time I’ll add agave nectar and see. I also substituted the heavy cream because I didn’t have any, I used 3/4 c milk lactose and 1/4 c butter. Best recipe yet regardless of sweetness.

Made this exactly like the recipe.  It had an unusual texture and after taste.  It was light but then really gritty afterward.  Hard to describe.  I also made Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread.  Hands down the winner between these two recipes.

This was great. I added a half teaspoon of salt like many reviewers recommended and that worked well for me. Baked for 25 min. I used apricot syrup in place of the honey just to give it a try and it worked well, though not a distinctly different taste. Everyone loved it but just one person said it was too sweet. I will be using this again!!

Good, but I thought the taste was a bit flat - just a bit of salt would help.

This was awful, mainly because the cornmeal obviously needed to be soaked to soften it prior to baking.  As made, the cornbread went straight into the garbage. Hard cornmeal on the teeth=nasty.

Delicious! I wanted to make this Gluten Free so used corn flour and corn meal. Also baked in an oiled and heated (in the oven) iron skillet. Very light and flavorful.

This is my favorite recipe for cornbread and I've made it several times now, usually with a crockpot of chili. I make it exactly as directed but sometimes I use 1/2&1/2 instead of heavy cream, depending on what I have on hand.

Great. I followed one of the suggestions below and used 3/4 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of melted butter instead of the heavy cream. It turned out perfect and I have never liked cornbread.

If you haven't already try making pancakes with this batter! 

This recipe is delicious. I made muffins. I baked for 15 minutes. probably less time was needed. I had a little extra batter after 12 regular sized muffins. I decided to make a pancake with that. Me and my 2 kids gobbled that one pancake immediately. Will make pancakes next time using this recipe. The only changes I made are using 1/2 tsp salt and since I don't have cream, I substituted with equal amount evaporated milk.

I made this as a meal prep for a quick breakfast before work, and it turned out pretty good. 5 stars for flavor, however, I did mess up a bit and I used bread pans instead of the 9x9 recommended and baked at a lower temp for longer. Ended up making it more crumbly, however, it was somehow still most? Anywho, turned out pretty good. I also substituted the honey with homemade honey butter to make it a little buttery as well. Flavor was spot on!

I found this to be very bland.  I usually love cornbread but  I stopped eating this after a couple bites.  I expected it to be tasty given all the fat (cream) that is in it but it wasn't.

So sweet and tasty! The perfect addition to a hearty, spicy chili. Next time, I’m going to run the cornmeal through the food processor to get rid of the graininess.

Best cornbread ever! I did have to make a few changes because I didn't have heavy cream and am gluten free. I used 2/3 cup sour cream and 1 cup whole milk to replace the heavy cream. I used Bob's 1to1 Gluten Free AP Mix. The batter that didn't fit in my pan were cooked on a griddle like pancakes. So good Tim, thanks for sharing!

The last time I made cornbread, i used the recipe on the cornmeal box. Not good. This is the best cornbread I've ever made. Only change, I used half cream and half whole milk.

I make this all the time because it is so good, so quick, and so easy. I use skim milk and the cornbread turns out wonderfully. Thank you so much for the terrific recipe!! Love the hint of honey!!

I'm so glad I made this! A couple of weeks ago I tried another cornbread recipe from All Recipes and was  so disappointed. That recipe was everything that this recipe isn't! I loved the crumble to the bread and found that it wasn't as excessive as other reviews may have indicated. The sweetness of the honey was just right. Will be making this from now on.

This is a really tasty cornbread recipe if you're looking for a sweet cornbread.  Very moist and rich and delicious.  I followed this recipe to the "T" except I used canned milk instead of the whipping cream and I always add some canned corn to my cornbread as well for texture (simply dry fry some drained canned corn with a tiny pat of butter until slightly blistered/fragrant and then mix into the final batter).  Very good!

I didn't like it. Not sure why. The flavor just didn't work for me. Maybe it was the addition of honey. I like sweet cornbread but this was not for me.

My husband said it was the best cornbread he has ever had. Being that I am in Europe, I used Polenta instead of cornmeal. This gave it a real smooth texture. Then I used the cornbread to make a sausage dressing for Thanksgiving that was well received. Great recipe here that I will use for years to come.

substituted brown sugar, bacon grease added a shot of Wild Turkey 101 threw a hand full of organic frozen corn kernels in the batter poured into preheated cast iron skillet coated with more (you guessed it) bacon grease brushed with butter and waiting for it to cool IT SMELLS LIKE HEAVEN! Update, yeah pure heaven!

4 stars instead of  5 because I made alterations: I substituted the heavy cream with almond milk and the oil with butter; furthermore, I cut the sugar in half. Beyond that, I followed the recipe, and the results were phenomenal! Sweet but not cloyingly so, and the texture was very moist and cakey, but still flaky on the outside and held together very well. Love, love, love this cornbread -- will definitely make it again, hopefully soon lol!

This corn bread is good but very sweet. If you are craving sweet this will fit the bill. I find it a bit too sweet for my palate so next time I will have to play with reducing the sugar, honey or both.

I’ve never made cornbread before, but my boyfriend wanted some for dinner. I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT my boyfriend made me add salt (he’s a cook and claimed it wouldn’t cook right without it-so I sprinkled some in with the dry ingredients). It was delicious and perfect. I put it in a cast iron skillet since we don’t have a 9x9 pan, but it worked wonderfully. I cooked it for 22 minutes. Went perfectly with our butternut squash vegetarian chili (which I made from scratch). :)

It needed salt in the worst way.  It did bake up light and fluffy and was very sweet.  Too sweet for my tastes, but I don't like my cornbread that sweet.  I had added 1/4  tsp of salt when I noticed the lack of it and it still wasn't enough.  I suggest maybe 1/2 tsp of salt and it would be a winner.

This is a great cornbread recipe but I didn't use heavy cream the first few times and it tasted great. Decided to make it last time following the recipe verbatim and never really tasted the honey.

I made this recipe today and it was awful!  Strong tinny taste of baking powder, dense heavy cake, came out flat and eggy.  Not even butter and jam could save it.  I threw it all away.

This recipe is very easy, has readily available ingredients if you substitute milk for heavy cream, and is very quick.  I live in Guatemala and after 4 years found corn meal and began to try for a good recipe for a favorite food.  I think this is it.  Moist, slightly sweet, and really really good.  

When I made it, I added a bit of salt as others suggested, and had only 2% milk.  I suppose it would have been better with heavy cream or even plain yogurt,  but I have no complaints.  Try this, the first time as it is, then adapt to your tastes with cheese, canned corn, chilies, bacon, or whatever grabs your fancy.  I think you will be pleased.

Great sweet cornbread! I made this to go with a batch of pumpkin turkey chili from this site and the sweetness complemented well. I made as written except that I substituted unsweetened almond milk for the cream and I made them as muffins (baked for 20 mins). The batter was really runny and I was worried that my honey wasn't incorporated well enough, but they baked up beautiful and I could just taste the honey sweetness. A little dry but that's what I want for eating with soup!

I made this recipe and used muffin tins instead of a baking pan - it made 6 giant muffins. They were unbelievably good! And I guess making them in the muffin tins helped make them not so crumbly. They were moist and delicious. I will definitely make them again.

My family loves this cornbread. I made it according to the recipe but cooked it in small loaf pans then sliced it like bread when it was done. It came out so moist that slicing and buttering it was no easy task. Definitely will make this again.

This is super yummy!! Great texture and flavor. I've tried numerous corn bread recipes from this site and this is the best hands down. You won't be sorry you made it.

Always my go-to recipe for cornbread!  I follow the recipe exactly, but I add the zest of a lemon and a teaspoon of finely cracked black pepper.  The flavors come together so perfectly, and it's always a hit!  I've impressed pastry chefs with whom I've worked over the years, that's how good it is!

I didn't like this recipe as I found the muffins too gritty. The flavour was ok but just didn't like the grit.

I followed the ingredients exactly - though baked in cast iron muffin tin for 15 min.  For me this was not any better than similar recipes but used more expensive ingredients (honey and cream vs sugar and milk) and had more calories.  It was good, but not the best in my opinion.

Made a vegan version - about 3 tablespoons of ground flax instead of the eggs and soy milk instead of cream. It cooked up beautifully! I also omitted the sugar and included about 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels. Baked it in a round dish lined with parchment paper. Delicious vegan cornbread!

This is my go-to recipe now! I don't use the honey, I do use the sugar though, plenty sweet. I also add 1 teas of salt.  Instead of greasing your pan or cast iron skillet, put a heaping tablespoon of bacon grease or Crisco in the pan, put it in the oven and let it melt, then pour in your batter. You will get a nice crisp crust. Yum!

Awesome recipe Tim! My 8yr old helped me make these. All I did differently was sub applesauce for the oil and we used a mini muffin pan. Baked for 12 mins @ 375 and they are perfection. You can definitely taste the honey too. Thanks for posting this!

This was really good! I didn't have yellow cornmeal, but used white with great results. I do agree about adding 1/2 tsp of salt.  It was nice and moist and a little bit crumbly.  I baked it in a metal 8x8 pan. I took it out at exactly 20 mins and I think it could have been out sooner, maybe 16-17mins. I served this with honey butter. Wow, delish! This made a nice side to my rib dinner.

Delicious!!! Wonderfully sweet with a great texture. I did not have heavy cream so I used 3/4 cup milk with 1/3 cup melted butter. It was perfect. Definitely my go to recipe for cornbread now. Thank you for submitting it.

I made these in kind of a last minute situation, did not use heavy cream, instead whole milk and they came out great. Better than any instant quick mix available in stores.  This will become a regular in out house.

Needs a pinch of salt but other than that they were good and not crumbly. I made muffins and baked them for 15 minutes.  They were beautiful...until I bumped the muffin pan taking them out of the oven and they dumped all over the bottom of the oven.  LOL.  I was able to pick them up with tongs and they held together for the most part.

Decent cornbread, but needed salt. I almost added some when I noticed its absence from the ingredients list, and I should have listened to my instincts. I subbed whole milk for the heavy cream and the texture was still great.

Easy to mix, quick to bake. Almost too crumbly, but still moist. There's something odd about the taste, though. Maybe it needs salt?

This is my favorite corn bread recipe, so far!! So many recipes out there, and I've tried a lot of them.  I make the recipe with no alterations, and bake it in my cast iron skillet.  I serve it with white chicken chili, and I never have leftovers! I serve it when company comes over, and they rave about it.  Thanks, Tim L for the submission!

Definitely a keeper. I changed the recipe to meet a more healthy style flour for wheat pastry flour, oil for organic melted butter, white sugar for splenda, and heavy cream for almond milk.  These are wonderful. I will definitely be making these again!

Great recipe! I omitted the sugar, as I like my cornbread sweet, but not overly sweet. Once I didn't have corn meal on hand, so I used grits and still got good reviews on it (though, I'd only try it personally if you like a little...well...grit to your cornbread:). Great with chili!

It's utterly delicious! Not too sweet and very easy to put together!

I used white cornmeal and kept everything the same. I also forgot to beat the eggs before I added it, but it's still pretty good.

This a fantastic cornbread recipe!  We love our cornbread sweet, and this one is just perfect.  The only thing I change, is I use regular milk (whatever I have on hand) instead of heavy cream.  Still turns out delicious.  I usually cook these as muffins, and have found that they don't take as long as the recipe calls for to bake.  It usually doesn't take more than 12-15 minutes.

Awesome!  I grew up on Jiffy cornbread, but I recently moved to Canada where it is not sold.  I tried a different sweet cornbread recipe, and it just wasn't very good.  So, I tried this one.  OMG, this is BETTER than Jiffy....and you know it must be good for a southern girl to say so!  I made this as part of a dinner for some Canadian friends who had never even had cornbread (or who didn't like it), and they all raved over how amazing it was.

This is fantastic! Not too dense, with just the right sweetness. I did as another commenter suggested and substituted 3/4 C milk and 1/3 C melted butter for the cream. It's a keeper.

I have made this several times. I make it in a cast iron frying pan and cut into slices. I also add 2 tablespoons of salted butter to the top and let sit in the oven after turning off. It gives it the ppop of buttery goodness that makes it a keeper for me.

This was very good!  It wasn't crumbly or dry, just enough sweetness.  After I put it in the pan I sprinkled salt over the top, because some of the reviews said it needed salt.  I also cooked it at 350 for 5 min longer.  Very good warm with butter and honey!

I originally rated this recipe in 2012, but it's so great I wanted to update now (7/7/2017).

This has been my go-to cornbread recipe for the past 5 years. We love it! I read some of the other reviews, and I have a few suspicions on where people went wrong. 1) It's easy to accidentally pick up a "cornmeal mix" in the supermarket instead of "cornmeal". My local supermarket has about 5 different cornmeal mixes and only one actual cornmeal, and the word "mix" is usually in fine print. 2) Regarding crumbliness: It's important to only stir enough to combine the ingredients, don't overstir! It also helps to under bake slightly so it's just a hair underdone in the very middle -- then it's still moist and not crumbly even on day 2 or day 3 (on the rare occasion it makes it that far!) My husband and I love it so much that I always double the recipe and make 2 pans at a time. 

Doubled, the ingredient quantities are so easy! 2 c flour, 2 c cornmeal, 2c (1 pint container) cream, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c honey, 1/2 c oil, 2 tbsp baking powder, 4 eggs. I don't need to dirty 10 different measuring cups/spoons for this recipe, just a 2c measuring cup and a tablespoon! And there's not a bunch of oddball, perishable, leftover ingredients, which is a bonus.

I make this recipe exactly as stated (it's perfect as is, why change?), cept that I don't own any 9x9 pans, so I use either (2) 8x8 glass pans or (2) glass pie pans, and I don't bake it long enough for the toothpick to come out clean (I aim for

This was a definite HIT! Even my mother-in-law, who won't eat anything that is not Chinese, absolutely loved it! I can't get cream where I live, so I used "old yogurt" which is very thick, and mixed with the eggs using a mixer. very smooth! Baked in a 10" cast iron skillet ... results? WOW!
Can't thank you enough!!!

I have been baking for many years now and I am constantly looking for new and different recipes to try. The honey and cream in this recipe made it appealing to me and good enough, this cornbread is one of the best I've ever had. It is a keeper! Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe. I really enjoyed it.

Awesome! I made it just the way it's written and the cornbread turned out great. The only thing that I did have to change was the baking time since I used a mini loaf pan (that makes 9 mini loafs) instead of a muffin pan...so it only had to bake for 15 minutes.

Love it! Ive tried a bunch of cornbread from here and nothing even comes close. Very squishy, sweet but not too sweet. I did sub butter for the oil, Im not crazy about oil in my baked goods, but left everything else, it came out great! Kids LOVE it and they normally dont like cornbread! Thank you so much for posting it!!!

No need to try any other recipe. This is easy and fast! Instead of heavy cream, I used half & half - in place of veggie oil I used grape seed oil - and I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose white flour. It is delicious! Perhaps the only tweak I would make it to add a little salt and cut back on the sugar a bit. It is very sweet... not in a bad way. :)

I've made this version of honey cornbread a couple of times.  The first try, the honey was a bit overpowering.  For the second batch I dialed it back to half amount of honey the recipe calls for, which made for a naturally sweet dish.

Outstanding cornbread! I did have to change a bit since I didn't have any cream. I used buttermilk in place of cream and the cornbread was the best I've ever made. My husband thinks this is the only cornbread recipe we need to keep. Thanks for the super recipe Tim!

This was delicious. I also substituted milk (1%) for the cream. I baked it in a 9x9 glass dish and it wasn't too crumbly until the third day. The consistency was perfect to me. It went great with turkey chili.

Great sweet cornbread! I baked them in a muffin pan for a slightly shorter cooking time and they came out well. I didn't have cream so i used milk and a little extra butter. They  sweet, rich, and not too crumbly. Great served with spicy gumbo!

The best cornbread I've every done.   I did added a few extra ingredients (1 tablespoon of butter, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and instead of 1cup of heavy cream, I used 1/2 of the heavy cream and 1/2 of milk).  The results MAGNIFICENT.

Scaled the recipe down to 6 servings as I only had 3/4 corn meal on hand. Also, followed another's suggestion to add butter and use milk in lieu of heavy cream. Overall, recipe turned out great! Will definitely keep this recipe handy.

My family is not a huge cornbread fan but I do have one daughter who likes it.  This is my first time making it from scratch and even my hubby said it was the best he had ever had.  I used 2% milk instead of the heavy cream as that is what I had on hand but others wise I didn't change anything.  Thank you so much for sharing this.

This tasted too much like white sugar. I like the sweetness, but i felt like I just made non-sweet cornbread sprinkled with lots of white sugar. Also, it was a little too crumbly for me. It couldn't even stay together long enough to put a bit of butter on it.

Turned out AMazing!!! I used 1 1/4 cup 2% milk in place of heavy cream since I didn't have any and made sure to put in a very full 1/4 cup of honey. It was moist and delicious. Perfect for desserts, snacks, or dinner.

This is a fabulous cornbread recipe!  It came out really moist, but still a coarser texture - not like a cake.  My family loved it!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious, light cornbread.  The texture is great and it is not too crumbly like other recipes.  I substituted whole milk for cream.  I will be saving this to use again.

Very good cornbread! I meant to add salt like another reviewer suggested but forgot.  Definitely needs salt but otherwise great.  I used 1/2 + 1/2 because I didn't have heavy cream on hand...wonderful.

This cornbread is very good but maybe just a little  too sweet for me .  I like cornbread a little on the sweet side but this was just one step past that.  I also used regular milk instead of the heavy cream and the texture turned out fine.  Next time I may cut down on the sugar by 1/2.

Although I have a great recipe for cornbread, I wanted to try this one, based on the reviews. I didn't care for it. I love a sweet cornbread, so that wasn't the problem. There's no salt in this recipe, which I think is part of the reason why it's so bland. My family loves cornbread, and they didn't like this recipe at all. I'm sticking with my wonderful recipe, and will not be making this one again. Ever.

I love cornbread but usually don't like it sweet.    Based on other reviews, I decided to give it a try. Delicious!  I'm passing the recipe on to my daughter who much prefers sweet cornbread.   P. S.  I normally use a pre mixed packet but no more.  Actually, this recipe takes only a few minutes longer to prepare & the pay off is worth it!

This is delicious and not hard to make.  It made more than my husband and I needed ..... would probably cut recipe in half if I make again.  Having said that .... I must confess I LOVE Jiffy cornbread mix and will probably stick to that.  NOTHING wrong with this recipe - it is very, very good.  But Jiffy is easier and tastes great too.  :-)

OMG!  I know this won't be extremely helpful, but I made this last night and CANNOT stop eating it!  It's very moist and the honey gives it an amazing flavor.  I've been making another recipe for 20 yrs and won't be making any other cornbread but this one going forward.

Great texture, Fantastic taste. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand (used 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 cup sour cream in place of heavy cream, and a half cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar and honey) but this still turned out FANTASTIC. I'm putting heavy cream and honey on my shopping list for tomorrow so I can see if its possible for it to taste even better.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe.  I used MASCEA and added 1 tsp. salt.  I also did not have heavy cream but did have half and half.  I kept all the measurements the same.  I even added some frozen corn.  A canned of creamed corn would be dynamite in here as well.  Came out perfect.

Very moist cornbread--I baked the recipe in three mini-bread pans rather than muffin tins or a big pan.  Took out of oven when bread temperature was 185 degrees. I only had polenta on hand and not cornmeal--so I will try the recipe again using cornmeal.  This recipe is to cornbread what cream is to cream biscuits--adding cream as the fat and liquid without having to melt the butter.  That makes it a little easier to make.

This was great!  I did last-minute shopping, and no heavy cream was anywhere to be found.  I used 3/4 cup whole milk, and 1/3 cup butter.  Deliciousness ensued.

These were delicious! I usually make cornbread from the box but this tops all. Such a sweet flavor really pairs well with chili and it was easy to make. I added most of a can of sweet corn so there was actual corn pieces in it.

This cornbread had wonderful texture. It was really moist and not that crumbly. I do think the flavor was missing something, though. Perhaps it needed a little salt?

This cornbread was really good!  I didn't have heavy cream in the house, so I substituted 3/4 cup of the 1% milk I had and 1/4 cup butter.  It was really good.  I fixed it with our Halloween chili, and everyone loved it!  It will now be "my" cornbread recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was fantastic as is.  My only change was I added a few tablespoons of all natural maple syrup - only because I ran short on honey.  When baked it doesn't crumble and I have added this to my recipe box!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I read all the reviews for this recipe before I made it. I exchanged the heavy cream for evaporated milk and cut the baking powder down to 1 1/2 tsp and added 1/2tsp salt. I baked it in my cast iron skillet and my family and friends loved it. I am going to keep this recipe forever! Thanks!

Superb cornbread recipe- I made it into mini muffins and muffins... and it came out wonderfully.  I will add that I used the paper liners with the larger muffins- so even if it crumbled it did not matter :)

Delicious with an even, soft texture. This will be my go-to cornbread. Always trying to make things healthier, I used skim milk instead of cream and 100% whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and it turned out perfectly. Added 1/2 tsp salt as well. Remember to bake cornbread on the middle rack or it wont cook evenly!

This is by far the best Cornbread recipe I have ever made. I have not and would not change a thing. The first time I made it was camping, it went very well with the homemade chilli and cucumber salad we had for dinner that evening.

This recipe is really good! I expected a little more because the batter was awesome but not too bad! I would suggest lowering the stove temperature to 350 - 375 or it'll bake too fast. Overall good recipe. I will try again! Honey adds an extra special 'umph' to it! Thanks!

I can't believe how good this was! I'm sensitive to wheat, so I used oat flour instead. The middle was still soft when I followed the directions, so I put it back in on 350 and when it was finished it came out just fine. My family loved it - it was all gone in one day. GREAT recipe!

Seriously.  The best cornbread I've tasted.  It even got my ridiculously picky fiance, who doesn't like cornbread, to say "it tastes good" (trust me when I say this is high praise coming from him). The changes I made:  used 2/3 c of nonfat milk and 1/3 c of melted butter instead of cream, used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, used a cast-iron skillet pre-heated with canola oil (the same oil I used in the recipe - warmed up the oil in the oven in the cast-iron skillet, then poured the oil in the batter as called for, using the excess to grease the skillet before pouring in the batter). It cooked perfectly in exactly 20 minutes. Some other reviewers reported it was too crumbly but I didn't think so.  It was moist enough to hold the shape, and just as you put it in your mouth it crumbles up just right.  It was PERFECT!

FANTASTIC!  MOIST & LITE ! THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS THAT I COOKED IT IN A CAST IRON SKILLET THAT I PREHEATED IN THE OVEN WITH BACON GREASE.

I am a single guy and this recipe NEVER fails.  I make this in 5 small loaf pans (about 2" x 5") and freeze `em- A MOST EXCELLENT CHOICE!

WONDERFUL!I might be a bit biased only b/c this is the second time I have made cornbread and the first time you couldn't swallow the corn bread without drinking water it was soo dry:) This was the complete opposite, super moist, with a hint of sweet...yummmm Very good. The only change I made was halfed the oil and added a half a can of cream style corn to jazz it up...TWO THUMBS UP*

Excellent cornbread!  The honey adds just enough sweetness, and the texture is great--not overly crumbly.  Yum!

I had to add my review here. We are a cornbread-loving family and I have tried them all. This one, however, is the only one my family wants me to make anymore. My kids adore this and say nothing else comes close to it. Making it tonight with chicken chili!

My picky husband loved this Yankee cornbread.  The sweet, tender, not too crumbly final product made us all happy.  He wants me to bring it to the next family BBQ. We won't need to try another.

I had never made cornbread before but have always been a fan of it, especially the sweeter kind. This was the BEST I've ever had! I had white corn meal on hand and was a little nervous using it considering the recipe called for yellow but I don't think it made a difference at all. Made my pregnant belly happy! Thank you for the recipe won't need to look for another!

Oh, this was soooooooo good.  Nice and moist, good flavor.  Cut the baking powder down to a tsp, because I loathe being able to taste it.  Still had wonderful results.  Definitely the best I've ever had.

I've used this recipe many times and it is a hit always. I've made it both with half and half and 1% milk and the  'critics' have never noticed.  Cooks perfect everytime at 25 mins.

I just made a batch of this and it turned out great. I followed the advice of another reviewer and reduced the baking soda to 2 1/2 tsp, and since I had no cream on hand, did a mix of 1/3 cup butter and 2/3 cup milk. The flavor and texture are great. It is a higher calorie recipe, but I am treating it as a desert item. :o)

Excellent recipe.   Was out of cream so substitued skim milk.  Cooked in a muffin tin for 15 - 18 minutes.  These muffins were perfect.  My guests ate the whole dozen.  This was so easy.

Excellent cornbread!  Followed the suggestions of several others and used only 3/4 tablespoon baking powder and added 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Baked in an 8" pan, which required slightly longer cooking.  Did not have a problem with crumbling, as some others have mentioned - maybe they are not allowing it to cool a bit before slicing.  Thanks for sharing!

While this cornbread was a little crumbly when it first came out of the oven, it firmed up nicely once it cooled. My boyfriend said it tasted as good as cake, and I agree.

This is our new fav recipe for cornbread. I used creamed corn instead of heavy cream and it worked beautifully! Yum! My husband didn't even put butter or maple syrup on it and I have never seen him not do that before!

Tim,  This was absolutely delicious!  Unfortunately I did not have any heavy cream in the house, so I substituted half & half.  We enjoyed the Honey Cornbread with homemade vegetarian split pea soup!  Next time I'm going to make it with the heavy cream...could it possibly be any better?!?!

I found this cornbread to be bland. Not a lot of taste. I prefer the Homesteader Cornbread recipe from this site.  I wanted to try something new and this sounded good with the honey but it wasn't something I will make again.

This was pretty good. I expected it to be more cakelike, but I still enjoyed it. Took about 20 mins longer for mine to be completely done.

Good cornbread and moist, though nothing spectacular.  I used milk in place of the heavy cream but otherwise followed the recipe.

My children only eat their father's cornbread so this was a real test. Ordinarily, they won't even try anyone elses. I got my 10 year old to try it first and she loved it so the other three reluctantly had a piece. It passed with flying colors, they all loved it and I had no left overs. I added a little extra honey but other than that followed the recipe exactly. This is a definate keeper.

I forgot the eggs when I baked, but it tasted great otherwise! I used splenda instead of the sugar and half whole wheat and half white flour.

Use 1/4 cup splenda. Just as good! Use 2% evaporated milk if you have no milk in the house, and 1/3 c melted butter. So yummy. Not crumbly at all.

Amazing recipe. The only addition I made was about three pinches of salt to the batter. I made them into mini muffins and my family adores them.

Wonderful flavor.  I liked the fact that it was not too grainy.  All my boys loved it even my 9 year old who doesn't like regular cornbread.

I made these today and oh boy! I will NEVER buy another box of Jiffy. I did exactly as recipe called for except when they were almost done I put melted I can't believe it's not butter on top of each muffin. WOW! I will use this for my cornbread stuffing also. Went very well with my homemade vegetable soup. 5 stars could be more.

I followed the recipe as written.  This was a very nice and light muffin (14 muffins from this mix).  Generally scratch corn muffins are grainy, this was not.

I made a few changes to this and was pleased.  We don't eat dairy so I used rice milk for the cream.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  Still pretty good, but I have a feeling the version with dairy is better.

This is the best cornbread recipe I have ever made. The only change I made was using nonfat milk instead of the cream. I was worried it wouldn't turn out well, but it was delicious!

This is very exceptional cornbread. Super easy to make and really delicious. I did make a tiny adjustment since I didn't have any heavy whipping cream and wanted to cut down on the fat a little, I instead used 1/2c half and half and 1/2c 1% milk. I even probably could've gotten away with just using milk and it would have still been awesome.

Made into muffins. Baked for exactly 15 mins and they came out perfectly. Huge hit with everyone and was asked to make another batch the next day. Delicious! Added the suggested salt but other than that I wouldn't touch a thing.

Thought it had a very flat taste.  No salt in the recipe which I think was an issue.  The recipe on the back of the Quaker box of cornmeal is better!

Someone has to come and stop me from eating it all! lol :) Excellent recipe, very easy to make, I also used 3/4 c milk and 1/4 c melted butter (and also used the oil).  I sprinkled ancho chile powder and cumin on top and it browned up beautifully...now for another piece :)

I made this recipe to go along with red beans and rice, and it was soooo good. Everyone loved the cornbread especially. I even made more the next day for my in-laws and took it to them. Now everyone wants the recipe!!

OMG! This is the best cornbread I have ever had in my life!! It is moist and it doesn't even need butter. I think it's the first and only cornbread to where I didn't have to slab on the butter. I will never buy boxed cornbread again!!

This was just okay.  I was expecting much better from the reviews I read.  It didn't taste right...I made it exactly as written and it was too "floury".  My husband didn't like it at all...his comment was "this isn't cornbread...what is it?"  The texture was very cakelike and not crumbly like a cornbread is.  I Don't think I will make again.

This is delicious and especially satisfying when made with coarse-ground cornmeal and drizzled with raw wildflower honey. As an added bonus after you enjoy the cornbread itself you get to lick the honey and crumbs from your fingers and the plate afterward! I made some for company and it was a hit.

This recipe is excellent. It has great texture and flavor. The only changes I made were out of necessity- I used white corn meal instead of yellow and I substituted 3/4 C whole milk and 1/3 C melted butter for the cream as another reviewer suggested since I didn't have any. This is my new staple recipe for cornbread.

it was okay... a bit too dry, maybe needs a bit more oil or something to moisten it more and hold it together better.  flavor was good... not "great", just "good".  you definitely need to drink something with it whether it's milk or tea or something, to help get it down your throat!

Love it, love it love it! Usually follow the recipe exactly, except for when we don't have 1/2 & 1/2 on hand, then substitute just milk.  Notice no difference.  Also, will sprinkle sea salt on top before baking.  YUM!  A staple in this house now when eating a hearty soup!

Very good flavor with the addition of 1 tsp. salt.  Moist, tender and flavorful - you'll enjoy this recipe if you're looking for a cakelike texture in your cornbread.

These had a good flavor, but I found the batter to be very dense, so they didn't rise well. I will try these again to see how they turn out.  Kids and hubby gobbled them down.

This is an excellent recipe.  When I make it, I make it in a couple large cast iron pans in the oven.  It turns out great, and the other folks I live with at my co-op (all 16 of them) love it.  Thank you!

I don't get it. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was extremely dry. The flavor was good, but not good enough to convince me to try this again, unfortunately. It was the driest cornbread I've ever had.   My Husband said if someone had a problem with excessive perspiration, they could use this cornbread under their arms and their problems would be solved. That's a little extreme, but yeah, it kind of sucked the moisture out of your mouth when you ate it.  I used the correct sized baking pan and didn't overcook, so I just don't understand what went wrong. :(

Eh.  While the texture was good, we found the flavor a little odd, unsatisfying, and not particularly "corny."  I won't make this again.

This was fantastic - definitely replaces my usual recipe.  I doubled it, adding salt as others suggested, and baked it in a 13" x 9" pan (took longer to cook).  I brought this to a chili cook-off at the office, and people came back for second helpings until it was gone.

Hands down the best cornbread I've ever had.  I will cut the honey in half next time, though.  It is perfect for me, but a little too sweet for my wife's taste.  Also, I always cook my cornbread in a cast iron skillet.

I've been on a holiday cookie baking kick this evening and everything has turned out perfectly except for this cornbread.  Followed directions to a T and it was overly browned on top and almost black around the edges while the center was still raw.   I took it out of the oven and just let it sit and it finished baking on it's own.  I'm going to crumble it up for cornbread stuffing to have on hand.   In the center, it is very moist and had great potential but wither everything else turning out correctly, I just really don't know what to think about this one recipe.

I made a few changes to make this a bit more on the healthy side for our family. Instead of the cream I subbed it with skim milk, and instead of sugar used Splenda but left everything else the same and it turned out Great!  Very sweet!

This cornbread is pretty good, although not the best.  The flavor is good, however I found it somewhat dry and crumbly.  The honey gives it a nice flavor.

I thought the cornbread was way too thick, but cooked it anyway.  It came out super crumbly and fell into little tiny pieces.  I also could taste the baking powder and thought there was too much of it.  When you tasted the crust it tasted funny.  I would probably add milk and maybe margarine next time and less baking powder.

So Good! I added 1/2 tsp. salt based on another reviewer's comments. Baked the corn bread in an 8 x 8 pan for 26 mins and it came out light, fluffy and crumbly. Corn bread is supposed to be crumbly so I don't see why the other people who tried this recipe thought it was too crumbly! I also used 1/2 cup non-dairy creamer mixed with 1/2 cup water instead of cream because I am allergic to whey. Eating this bread right now with chili. Awesome!

Awesome cornbread! Made no changes and it baked up wonderful. Next day was even better, warmed with more honey and what a treat. Our 2 kids loved it and only wanted that for supper. As far as the crumbly comments I think they over mixed or something. To me cornbread should be a little crumbly. Have added this to my Family Favorites recipe folder and will be sharing it with my friends as well. TRUE KEEPER!

This is good.  I didn't have any cream, so I used milk instead.  It's still not quite as good as the recipe I have on hand, so I will continue to my own.  And I don't think I'd use cream for a cornbread recipe even if I did have it -- I'd use it on something else (i.e. more special) instead.

It tasted really great.  I agree that my family also thought it was a little more crumbly than they like but I liked it just fine.

This is a very yummy cornbread! We love honey cornbread but I would add more next time. It had a really good flavor and texture the first day, but the leftovers were pretty dry the next day, even when heated up.  Since there are only two of us and it takes a while to eat a pan of cornbread, I'm going to keep using the Homesteaders' Cornbread recipe with extra honey and more cornmeal because it stays soft longer.

This cornbread had a great flavor but it was too dry and crumbly.  I may change this up a bit and try again.

Used skim milk, as I hadn't any cream on hand. The bread came out great. It was really yummy. It wasn't overly sweet. Used white corn meal. Took no time to prepare.
Yumyumyum.  Edit: made this recipe again. Used heavy cream instead of milk- this bread came out super moist and sweet. I served it for breakfast and everyone loved it.

Excellent!  I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so sustituted butter and milk.  Didn't make any difference!  I couldn't really taste the honey, so might add more next time.  Very moist and tasty!

I really liked this bread.  It was easy enough for my 9 year old daughter and I to make together and came out moist and crumbly as promised.  It was a little bit sweeter than I like my cornbread.  I may try to omit the sugar the next time I make it.

I didn't have heavy cream so I had to use Allrecipe.com's substitution suggestion of 3/4 c milk and 1/3 c butter, so it wasn't as moist as it probably should have been, but it was still very good.

This has a nice, subtle, sweet flavor.
