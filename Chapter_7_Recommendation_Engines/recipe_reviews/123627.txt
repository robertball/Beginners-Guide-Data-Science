THIS STUFF WAS AWESOME.  TO CUT DOWN THE PREP TIME WE CUT THE TATERS AND BAKED FOR 30 MINUTES IN OVEN WITH 1/4 CUP OF OLIVE OIL TURNING TO COAT. JUST ADDED THE SAUCE MIXTURE FOR THE LAST 30 MINUTES.  OMMITTED THE CHEESE TOPING TO CUT THE CALORIES DOWN AND IT WAS STILL ONE OF THE BEST DISHES WEVE GOTTEN FROM THIS SITE.

This gets top rating because my picky 8 yr old son had thirds!!  I make a hashbrown casserole similar to this dish but with more ingredients.  This took a bit of time because there is whole potatoes involved that you need to prepare but they are so much worth it.  I also added about 1/4 cup of dried onions to this and also some cooked bacon sprinkled on top since I had some left over from another dish I had made.  Husband had seconds and I had a huge helping and am looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow!
You can never go wrong in my opinion with potatoes, cheese, and bacon!!!

This was good. Although I believe I will go back to the way I used to make this Cheesy potato dish. It takes a lot of time to prep this one, I usually use frozen cubed potatoes in a bag. Add everything together and throw in oven! Instead of cream of chicken I use cream of mushroom (much tastier) and add melted butter and more sour cream. I top it off with crunched up potato chips. Really yummy! (takes about 10 mins to prep! and is not as mushy as this recipe)

This was really good and liked by all. I like the creamy texture. However, I added some chives, a little seasoning salt and some garlic and it pumped it up even more (especially the chives).

ADD more flavor to this already awesome dish! I always use French Onion or Ranch sour cream based dips from the supermarket in place of regular sour cream.  Much more bang for your buck!!  (Actually I use french onion dip in all my potatoe recipes including cheesy potatoes and mashed...gets raves every time!)  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made these for Easter all but the onion because we have one anti-onion member of family. Also, this timeI used Edam cheese and a bit of mxed cheeses,to be holiday"fancy."I made them for Easter, putting them into the crock pot as we headed off for church. As my potatoes were small, made about 10. Turned out great- We had no leftovers and the recipe was great tasting with Easter ham. Definitely will become a tradition for holidays.

This was great! I usually make something similar to this with prepackaged hashbrowns. It never dawned on me to peel potatoes and make my own. I also used melted butter to give the potatoes that taste. I boiled them as well so they wouldn't have to cook as long and would be super tender.

I love this recipe! I don't like using frozen potatoes like so many recipes call for. I've made it as written (5stars!) and I've also made it with some additions: add cornflakes/butter to the top for some crunch and also added some chopped fried bacon in the mix. YUM! This recipe is very forgiving - you can add lots of your own favorite flavors to it.

I find these to be very rich, so instead I made these with a tossed homemade turkey stock and green onions. I waited to add the Parmesan until halfway through cooking time to stop it being too brown (but this could just be my oven). Great idea, and very versatile with other ingredients.

I ended up adding provolone and parmesan cheese because I ran out of cheddar cheese and it was delicious!  Next time I'm going to add chicken and broccoli.

This recipe was delicious, although I added a little garlic to flavor and used healthy request cream of chicken, fat free sour cream,  and 2% cheese. Mine turned out nothing like the picture however and resembled more of a mashed potato bake. Next time I will boil the potatoes but leave them a little firmer instead of tender. Great tasting though!

Absolutely delicious!  I served these potatoes to a die hard rice eater - She loved them, came back for more!  I sauteed some vidalia onion and then boiled it with the potatoes.  They had a wonderful flavor.  Used Cream of chicken with mushroom soup because that is what I had.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Making a baked potato and adding the toppings is probably easier, but this was a nice change up.  Only thing I added was crumbled bacon.  Very good.

I use "allrecipes.com" all the time...some I like, some I don't, but this one...wow, is awesome.  We renamed it in our family.  We call them "bangin potatoes".  The only change I have made is I use a whole medium regular onion chopped and instead of cheddar cheese, use the Velveeta crumble instead.  Its a great dish to bring to a picnic or party...I double it, prepare and have it all ready.  When you arrive, just have the host pop it in the oven and wait for the oooos and ahhhs that follow!

I also sauteed chopped onion & a bit of minced garlic...my husband and I decided it was too much.  Didn't even need it!  Next time I will make it as directed. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was looking for something a little different than regular old mashed potatoes, and this hit the spot.  Gooey and cheesy middle, with a kinda crust on the sides and top.  I even modified this to make it lower in fat, using 2% sharp cheddar, lf cream of mushroom, (didn't have chicken) and light sour cream.  Delicious, thank you!

I really didn't like this, sorry. I expect it was my fault though, I probably used more potatoes than the recipe stated as I only had small ones to hand, I did extra and probably did too many. It came out dry and bland. However, although I didn't like it my partner did so I will try again with less potato than I did before and give it another chance.
