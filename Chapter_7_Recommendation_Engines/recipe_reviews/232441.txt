This was super easy and was pretty good. One thing I want to point out is that the onions do not get softened and cooked. I love raw onion with my chili so it was perfect for me but if raw onions isn't your thing you might want to soften them in a skillet beforehand. Another suggestion I have is with the salsa. It waters the casserole down quite a bit. I suggest adding it to the top of the casserole after it is done. I'm thinking this might even work as a dip by cutting the tamales up and throwing it all in a crockpot. Just a thought....
