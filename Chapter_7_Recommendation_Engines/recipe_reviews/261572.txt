1.28.18 Piled this on top of a pulled chicken sandwich, but donâ€™t limit yourself to just serving it on sandwiches.  This coleslaw is tasty enough to stand on its own as a side dish to many entrees.  I cut back just a bit on the sugar and oil, otherwise, followed the directions.  As instructed, do allow some time in the fridge, because the flavor will be enhanced.  Karen Koppy, this is good stuff and a terrific option to mayo-based coleslaw!

I was looking for a recipe just like this. Personal preference, I cut back on the sugar and oil by more than half.  I'm sure it tastes better as listed but too many calories for my taste. Enjoy, you won't regret it if you like vinegar slaw instead of mayo.
