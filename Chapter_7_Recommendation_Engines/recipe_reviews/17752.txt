I used 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar and I added a capful of orange extract. I let it cook over low heat until it thickened some, then I poured over my Pumpkin Gingerbread from this site. Yummy :)

The flavor was good but it was too runny - I think that the proportions of each ingredient are off.  I was hoping for a thicker sugar glaze.

Made this to glaze Peach Cake II.  Really nice, fresh flavor that complemented the cake.

Great glaze not very orangy.  I added triple sec just to give it a kick.  Grand Marnier or Cointreau would be excellent.

As someone else did, I used powder sugar and brown sugar as well (eye-balled it), and being that some have said it needed more orange flavor, I added orange zest also, it was perfect.

I used lime juice instead of orange juice. Very tasty!

I let it simmer for a few minutes to get a little thicker after I read other comments. Added a drop of vanilla. It's delicious over an orange cake!

I made the recipe as written and used it on a honey cake I've made several times before. My family loved the addition of the Orange Glaze to an already favorite cake. The cake was wonderfully moist and was even better on days 2-4.

This was pretty good. I added extra juice and zest and I really tasted the orange. It wasn't as thick as I wanted it, but it worked out fine with the cake I baked. I actually liked the glaze better than the cake! Other than it being a tad too thin for my liking it was really yummy. I actually would have licked the pan if it wasn't hot :-)

absolutely loved it. perfect orangey flavor for a chocolate cake. I forgot about it for a few seconds on the stove and it started boiling but I quickly caught it and pulled it off the heat. It has stayed sticky so I feel like would be a beautiful addition to sticky buns.

Boil the glaze for five minutes, stirring constantly. That changes the consistency entirely.
