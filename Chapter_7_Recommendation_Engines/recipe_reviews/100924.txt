In lieu of bell pepper, I use fresh chopped green chili (grown right here in NM), or a can of rotel chili will work just the same.  I also use a can of white snopeg corn and add a can of chopped tomatoes.  Never heard of using half and half or butter.  I steam the zucchini and then add the rest of the ingredients.

Colorful, fresh and delicious! I used 2 zucchini and 2 yellow crookneck squash, a whole can of corn and shredded colby/jack cheese. Made a nice batch with leftovers!

This recipe turned out so good! You will need to be careful not to overcook the zucchini. First I sautéed the onions, garlic and green pepper with olive oil (I didn't use any butter), then I added the zucchini and cooked probably for 2 minutes, added corn, salt and pepper and cooked for an additional 2 minutes. I didn't add any half and half because I don't think it would go in this dish at all. Once cooked, I transferred to a plate and sprinkled cheese on. Thanks A.P. Newman this is a keeper!

This was such an interesting recipe that I prepared it exactly as written - and wasn't strongly moved one way or the other.  I don't often assign the overused word "bland" to a dish but in this case it is appropriate. While this dish doesn't offend the taste buds, it certainly doesn't excite them either.

Maybe it's a southwest thing? I don't understand all the comments about "never heard of adding 1/2 & 1/2 or any kind of milk to calabacitas."  It is the only way I've ever had it.  I like that it makes it creamy.  I also mix in my cheese, rather than just letting it melt on top.

I make this all the time but I've never heard of calabacitas with half and half or any kind of milk.   I add chicken (brown it in the same pan before adding all the veggies) and red pepper flakes for a slightly spicy complete meal and serve it over rice.

Very quick and tasty side dish. never heard of adding half and half to calabacitas so to cut the fat i didnt add cream and it wasnt missed. Used red bell pepper instead of green, and used a cheddar/monterey jack blend.

I make this for big parties all the time, always gone by the end.  I add green chili, and just slightly sautée the zucchini, squash, red onions and bell peppers in olive oil.  I add the steamed corn, cheese, cream, salt pepper, garlic powder and mix in large casserole dish.  Top with cheese and bake for 30 min at about 325 or so.

This is really good.  It was a touch bland for my taste, so since I like heat, so I added a half a seeded, finely chopped jalapeno pepper.  Yum.

Delicious dish. I added some summer squash & ro-tel. No half and half. Oh, it was so good! I also put cotija cheese on top, instead of monterey jack. Muy Bueno!

Great way to use zucchini.  I didn't add the half and half.  I have added a minced jalapeno or two, and once I roasted a bunch of jalapenos, diced them up, and added them.  When mixed with the other veggies, it isn't too hot at all.

Fantastic! Love, LOVE it!! I didn't add the half & half either-I can't imagine what it adds to this dish. Maybe I'll experiment next time but we absolutely loved it without this time around! It does make a lot-we'll be eating it for a few days! Thank you!

This was good, I have a vegetable garden for the first time this year and enjoy using zucchinis from it. I used chicken broth as opposed to cream, that was what I had on hand and also omitted the butter. I also didn't have Jack cheese, so used a grated cheese mix I always have. It was good, will likely make it again but might also try other Calabacitas recipes on the site.

Great recipe!  I did leave out the bell pepper and added yellow squash instead.  I also added a diced jalapeño and a touch of cumin.  We didn't have any left overs!

I liked it.  The man-child did not.  I won't make it again because I have enough trouble getting him to eat his veggies without turning him off with spiciness.

I used sour cream instead of the half and half and doubled the corn.  It was fantastic and my kids inhaled it!  For the adults, I topped it with chopped cilantro.  I would absolutely make this again and again and again.

This was a great side dish. It makes A LOT though since I am the only one that will eat these veggies. I did not add the half and half because I never have it on hand, and I don't think it was missed. I will use less oil and buter next time. Very good.

Use the freshest vegetables you can for this recipe, as those are the flavours that really come through. This was a nice, cooling, satisfying side dish for a fajita meal. I will definitely make it again with garden fresh zucchini and corn.

This was so comforting and delicious. I was a little unsure about the half and half, but after eating it I realized it really makes the dish  wonderful. If you are watchful with the amount of cheese, it is pretty healthy too. Serve it with some Mexican rice and you will have great easy weeknight dinner.

Followed all steps except two.  As other reviewers have mentioned the seasoning recommended is insufficient for the volume of the recipe. Instead of bell pepper I used roasted diced green chiles and swapped the salt and pepper for a teaspoon of chipotle seasoning mix, that has salt in it.  I also may have had a more generous hand with the cheese.

This recipe is a a tasty way to use up large quantities of zukes and bell peppers.  I tell people about it all the time as I offload my surplus veggies on them.  I skip the half-and-half and butter for my health's sake.

I've had calabacitas both with and without cheese sauce, and although it's good either way, the cheese sauce version is nice when the protein is simple (like a grilled chicken breast). This recipe was easy to make and pretty tasty but a little on the bland side. I added some chili powder at the end to liven it up then it was delicious. I will make this again and again.

I always fry in bacon grease with chopped onion and minced garlic.  Chop zucchini in circles unless I have fresh sweet corn I will use canned sweet corn drained.  I fry for about 10-15 minutes stirring occasionally until golden brown.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and enjoy.

We'll be having this for dinner often during zucchini season. I did leave out the salt as we need to have low sodium.
