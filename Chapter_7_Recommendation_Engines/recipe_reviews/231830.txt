These were absolutely delicious! - A couple of notes:
* 1/2 box of cake mix = 1-1/2 cups
* If you are measuring yeast from a jar rather than using packets, you need 5 teaspoons.
* I needed to add a total of about 1-1/2 cups of flour prior to rolling out, plus more needed for kneading/rolling.
* I prefer brown sugar, so I used that. I also like a lot of cinnamon, so I used 2 teaspoons rather than 1.
* I placed these in a jelly roll pan (10" X 16"), 3 across, 6 down for a total of 18. When they baked, they were all puffy and touching so the edges didn't all get brown, which IMHO is what you want with cinnamon rolls.

This is replacing my former "go-to" cinnamon roll recipe. Easy and delicious.

I've had cinnamon rolls made with part cake mix before and these do not disappoint. If you've never had any; the texture is pretty light and the flavor is great. There's a good chance you will need more flour as mentioned in directions, because they can be quite sticky. I paired them with the "Simple Orange Glaze" recipe on here. Delicious. Much faster to make than traditional cinnamon rolls too (love that part.)

super easy to make, soft & fluffy & delicous - why on earth would anyone buy dough in a can if you could create this in 15 minutes of waiting for the dough to rise?  100 times better than canned dough.  I used a Jiffy yellow cake mix because it's already only 1/2 a cake mix in size.  I think that is why they are called Jiffy in the name.  Thanks so much for sharing it.  I am looking forward to making them many many times in the future.

Stop the presses!  This is the most amazing cinnamon roll recipe, EVER!  I made these for my kids and they couldn't believe how good these were.  One of my kids said, "This is better than one of those bakery cinnamon rolls at the grocery store!".  My picky husband said that I should submit this recipe to the state-fair contest.  Seriously.  These were amazing.  Soft inside and perfect outside.  I did make two minor changes.  I doubled the cinnamon, and I baked at 375, so they were a tad brown on the top (baked for 18 mins).  I also made a simple icing recipe.  Just pour over the freshly baked cinnamon rolls after pulling them out of the oven, while still in the pan. (Mix 2 cups powdered sugar, 2 TB butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 TB milk).

I tried this recipe, and I was so amazed at the taste and texture of the cinnamon rolls. My family couldn't get enough. The recipe is easy to follow and very convenient. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my collection.

Used brown sugar instead of white, much thicker than what I expected/am used to.  I have only made cinnamon buns with biscuit dough before, these are well worth the little extra effort.

This is the first time I've made homemade cinnamon rolls. I made them the day before, let them rise, they doubled in size so make sure to give plenty of room on a tray. I got 15 large rolls and they were very good. This recipe was so easy for a beginner to make. I made it exactly and it turned out perfect. I have half the yellow cake mix left which gives me an excuse to make them again! Thanks for making our Christmas breakfast a tasty one!

These were outstanding!!  I had only white cake mix in pantry so used in place of yellow cake.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly and they were a huge hit. I mixed all w/ dough hook in bowl of Kitchenaid mixer and then kneaded only a few times to get right consistency.  It took a little longer than recipe stated to rise after cut into slices.  Iced w/ powered sugar/butter/milk/vanilla icing.  Yummmmmy!!

My cinnamon rolls turned out great even though I made a few mistakes!  Making them first thing upon waking was my first mistake!  Without reading the directions well and being early and all instead of spreading the softened butter over the dough and then sprinkling the cinn/sugar mixture over, I mixed the butter and cinn and sugar (brown sugar) together in a bowl then tried to spread that across the dough.  Obviously the mixture didn't spread well so I made more and sprinkled that on.  Long story short, after baking about 20 mins they turned out like sticky buns because the filling had oozed out into my 9x13 pan. That didn't stop me from pouring on homemade icing though!  Overall, they were wonderful!  The dough had a subtle cake flavor and was light.  I'll make these again!

I was so happy with how these turned out!  My family likes them better than non-cake mix recipes because they are fluffy and puffy (the rolls, not the family).  I like to knead the dough in my stand mixer and let rise until doubled before rolling out. This gives them slightly better flavor and texture and the dough is easier to work with.  I always use brown sugar and pile on the cinnamon. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

EXCELLENT AND EASY I MADE THEM FOR CHRISTMAS EVE AM AND AM MAKING THEN AGAIN NOW.  I USED BROWN SUGAR AND DID ADD AT LEAST 1-11/2 CUPS EXTRA FLOUR AND ADDITIONAL FOR KNEADING.  EVEN THOUGH I USED VIETNAMESE CINNAMON I WILL ADD MORE THAN ORIGINAL RECIPE.  MAYBE MORE BUTTER/MARGARINE AS WELL.  NUTS AND RAISINS IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE GREAT TOO

These rolls were just okay, they had a slightly artificial taste. My husband gave them three stars. I wish I had baked them at 375 for less time. I think they would have risen and browned better.

These were awesome! They were a lot better than I expected and so easy to make. I made them this morning for my family and they just couldn't stop eating them. The only thing that went a little wrong-but didn't affect anything-was that when I rolled it into a log, it started to flatten so I had to squish them back into a circle. This wasn't much trouble. I will definitely be making these again in the future!

These are amazing! And easy! As other reviewers said, they do require 1 1/2- 2 cups more flour...as written, the recipe makes a runny batter, not a rollable dough. I used caramel apple cake mix (pillsbury) instead of yellow and they were perfect! I fit them all into a 13x9-ish insulated pan, which made them take a few extra minutes, but they came out great with no hard burnt parts. HINT: I microwave a mug of water for 2 min and then put the whole pan into the microwave with the mug to rise. I do this with all bread doughs and I never have to cover them because they stay nice and moist and rise perfectly

Very good recipe. Easy to make. BIG PLUS!! Easy to work with. I added the remaking cup of flour to the 3 cups of flour from the start. In my opinion it needs more salt. I'll add 11/2 tsp. Next time. I made a paste with the butter, sugar. ( I used brown sugar, like the taste better)., and cinnamon. Wet the dough w/ water. Spread the paste on. Rolled as directed. Baked at 350.Baked for 9 minutes. Rotated trays on racks. Bottom to top, top on bottom. Baked for another 9 minutes. Rolls were brown in bottom but not on top. Took them out. Didn't want the bottoms any more brown. But every oven is different. It would have been 5 stars other than the color. But will make again.

This was my first time baking anything with yeast in it.  It was easy to follow and I had everything in my pantry to make it.  I made it in my stand mixer and it came out great.  It did start rising before I started to cut my rolls.  I kinda freaked.  But they turned out beautiful. I cut 2 inch rolls for my family.  By the way, this makes a great quick yeast roll with dinner.  Omit  sugar and cinnamon and pull 1-2 inch pieces and roll into a loose ball ands cook in 350° oven for 8-10 minutes.  Thank you for giving me two recipes in one.  :)

Well mine turned out terribly dense. They were nearly too tough to eat. I followed the instructions on the kneading, but I’m wondering if I made a mistake along the way.  I’m going to try again - I hope a white cake is just as good as a yellow cake.

I have a favourite cinnamon roll recipe I've been using for nearly twenty five years, but I was in a pinch, time wise, so I tried these and was pleasantly surprised at the texture and lightness of these rolls. I didn't care so much for the flavour while they were still warm, but after they completely cooled they were delicious! I have to confess that I accidentally put in the whole bag of cake mix so that gave it the cake mix-y flavor whie warm that I didn't care for. I like my roll dough soft but this needs more flour (or in my case cake mix:)) than called for. *tip 1: when preparing to roll out, instead of using flour whiçh will dry out your rolls, grease your rolling pin and table or countertop and you'll have soft rolls that stay fresher longer.
I used probably double the amount of butter, (brown) sugar, and cinnamon. I don't measure; I just slather and sprinkle a heavy layer of each. *tip 2: use a long piece of floss or thread to perfectly slice roll dough. Slide your string underneath the rolled up dough, bring it up and over till the string criss crosses and keep pulling till the roll is sliced off. These rolls were delicious finished off with a Carmel icing. My favorite is 4 T. butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and ¼ cup milk boiled together for 3 minutes ( time carefully ). cool down till room temperature, then add 2 cups powdered sugar and beat till smooth. Frost warm rolls. Or sometimes I leave out half the powdered sugar and add 4 ounces softened cream cheese. Fantastic!

These cinnamon rolls were amazing.  Light and fluffy and quite yummy.  Next time I will add some extra sugar and cinnamon in the filling to make them even more delicious!

I was really excited because I needed to make a bunch of cinnamon rolls in a hurry and this recipe fit the bill... These puppies NEVER browned. I think I baked them at least twice as long. Good thing I'm serving them to kids who really won't care as long as they are sweet :/

I weighed out the cake mix rather than go by volume, then sifted it into my flour. 

I didn't measure the cinnamon and sugar exactly, as I keep a big container of it in the pantry, I just shook it on until it looked great. 

The less flour you use, the lighter these will be, so be prepared to work quickly, and for them to be a little tricky to roll, but they're forgiving, so just mess with it as needed. The trick is to get them all about the same size. I baked mine in a 13x9x2 pan.

My kids gave this a five, but for me it was good but average. My kids like breads and desserts soft and sweet and this met that criteria. I like a little less bread like and more gooey and a mixture of textures. So a three for me and a five for my kids with an average score of 4.

Delicious cinnamon rolls, never thought I could make them myself but these were easy and taste very good, even without icing.  I used a vanilla cake mix and followed the rest as directed, started oven at 375 and then reduced it to 350 because my oven runs cold, but the result were golden brown,  crunchy on the top, soft inside and very flavorful.  This is a keeper!

Simply amazing we loved them I made the easy cream cheese icing and had to turn up my oven to 375 for the last 8 minutes. Will be making them again ??

This is my go to cinnamon roll recipe. Easy, fast, soft and tasty. Substituted yellow cake mix to butter pecan cake mix. Yum!

OK flavor and kind of dry.  Needs a glaze or frosting on top.
