Simple!  Tasty!  Throw some cilantro in there, man... don't be afraid.  Yeah, and some tomato too.  That's going to put this through the roof.  Add a little funky to it!  Don't forget to cumin up that rice, give it that zingy zang!

I think there may be a typo in the amount of water. According to the directions on the box of rice, you will need 2 1/2 cups of water. I thought this was delicious and easy. I served it with the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken from this site. A very nice weeknight meal!

I took it to pot luck at church and it had to be vegan.  So I managed to find yellow rice that did not have chicken broth.  That was not easy but the church loved it.  Everyone at church wanted the recipe so I posted it on the church web site.  I also made a version with mushrooms saut√©ed in vegan butter and soy sauce because my father loves mushrooms.  I made it with yellow rice (vegan) and one with brown rice and both were great.

This is a great recipe!  As others have mentioned it is very versatile.  It would make a nice side dish or great burrito fillings (we used it for burritos topped with shredded cheese and sour cream).  I make my own yellow rice (1 1/2 cups rice, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp onion flakes, 1/2 tsp garlic powder)  I put all ingredients both the recipe and my rice recipe in the rice cooker and it came out perfect!  My 9yr old LOVED it.  I agree with others that some fresh cilantro would dress it up; however, I made it as is and it was great.  This is also a PERFECT pantry/emergency dish since everything is shelf stable.

Instead of using water, I substituted homemade turkey broth. I also threw in a healthy amount of fresh cilantro when I folded the rice in to the remaining ingredients. One of the best rice dishes we've had in a long time, even the kids inhaled it. NO LEFTOVERS. I made Dee's Roast Pork for Tacos and served this with it to make filling for warmed tortilla-type dinner.......great pairing!

No surprises here with beans, corn and rice.  This is an inexpensive meal or side dish.  I did have to add an extra cup of water to the 8 oz. of rice I boiled which seemed to smoke up quite a bit.  I'm guessing that this was due to the olive oil?  Maybe, next time I will make the rice according to the box directions and proceed with the recipe as written.  As with anything you cook and add spices to, I anticipate this tasting better on day 2.

This was a good healthy alternative for those who are crazy about Chipotle.  However, it is bland.  I want to say it is missing one other spice, but not sure what.  In either case, I substitued the yellow rice for long grain brown rice, and sprinkled just a tad of lowfat mexican cheese on top.  I will make this again, but maybe add something else for flavor.

Good recipe and very simple. I sauted onions and garlic with olive oil, then I added brown basmati rice and water. After cooked, I added saffron and the other ingredients. Served this dish as a side dish for Chicken Enchiladas IV from this site.

This was very good. It hit the spot.  I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes but I added cooked shrimp to it when I ate it and it was very yummy!

Put in crock pot w/ vegetable stock, browned ground beef with taco seasoning, rinsed black beans, corn, and 1/2 can of rotel tomatoes (my hubby doesnt like hot so I only used 1/2) Was amazing in a flour tortilla! Cooked on low all day and ready when I got home. Great recipe!

Definately use Zatarain's yellow rice mix!  The seasonings in the mix is what this dish needed.  Follow the box directions; heat corn and black beans while rice is cooking.  I put the cumin in with the corn and black beans.  Mix together.  I served this as a side with fish tacos.  So delicious!!!

I gave this dish a three, but, I would probably rate it a 2-1/2.   I like all the ingredients that go into this dish, and I love tex-mex food, but, this recipe as is was too bland for us.  After tasting I even added more cumin and some chopped cilantro and still didn't have enough zing.  Don't plan on making again.

This is great!! Made it last night- added 1 small can diced tomatoes with green chiles (drained), chicken, and made burritos! I must admit, I sampled it while the chicken was cooking- couldn't get enough!!

This recipe is great- super simple and very tasty!  I used what I had on hand- we had no lime juice so I substituted lemon. I also did 2 tsp of cumin with 1 tsp of chili powder.  It was a big hit- even my 2 year old loved it!  We used leftovers as vegetarian taco filling. TASTY!

I've never seen a yellow rice mix and have no idea what is in that, but I had regular rice and all the other ingredients on hand so I figured, what the heck.  I seasoned small samples until I found my favorite combination.  I ended up using garlic, onion salt, and cumin.  Will definitely make this again.  It's too easy not too!

Made this as a side for dinner tonight.  The whole family loved it.  I used 1 cup of rice and seasoned it w/ a packet of Sazon to make it yellow...in a skillet I sauteed onions and garlic then added the rest of the ingredients.  I have a 3 year old and 5 year old and they both loved it.

3.5 - This was simple and quick to make.  I halved the recipe and it still made a ton!  Flavor was mild and felt like it was missing something.  Really enjoyed the corn in this though.

I really didn't know what to expect from this recipe as I've never made one of those yellow rice packages before.  But this got such good reviews I thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did!  I used home frozen corn (fresh off the cob before freezing) and the juice of a whole lime.  I also added some fresh cilantro.  I ate it plain for lunch but am looking forward to eating it in a tortilla shell tomorrow for lunch.  Thanks!

This was very simple and tasty.  I added Cilantro and fresh chopped tomatoes per suggestions above.  Only had lemon juice and white rice and it still a nice side dish.

I've never had nor prepared yellow rice before.  The one change I did make was to use fresh corn rather than canned.  My family really enjoyed the combination of the rice, corn and black beans.  I served this with another AR recipe 'Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas', and we had a delicious meal.  Thanks tahoegirl for sharing your recipe.

Love it, made this with Goya yellow rice.  While cooking added the beans, corn, cumin, and Goya Adobo.  Left out the lime juice.

The family loved this.  Super easy and Weight Watcher friendly.  I will be making this over and over.  I added cilantro and lime at the end for a fresh twist.  Thank you for posting this.

This is an easy dish to prepare and a great way to change up the usual boring rice.  I stuck with the directions on the package of rice and used 2 cups of water instead of 1 1/4.  Next time I will prepare the rice as directed on the package and then add the mixture of corn and beans.  I will also add some cilantro to give it a bit more flavor.  My family enjoyed it.

This was great! I added sauteed garlic and onion and topped with finely shredded Havarti cheese. Great meal or side dish, this will become a regular!

This is really good, but I think the cumin is a bit strong. I'd make this again with a little less cumin. Very tasty, my family enjoyed it.

I thought that this was pretty good as is. I think that I overcooked my rice though. I followed the package directions for that part so if I followed directions it probably would have been great. Definitely has to be made with the yellow rice or this would be bland!

Very good & quite easy. I added more water - I'm sure it depends on exactly which "mix" you choose - but this went really well with our spicy grilled fish & salsa.

This was super bland as written.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  No one else in my house at much either.  I just didn't have any UMPH.  Thank goodness I served it with Lime Chicken Tacos from this site, because they are ALWAYS delicious.

I followed directions, except added some red pepper flakes.  I thought it was a little bland still. I didn't care for the cold corn and beans against the warm rice.  maybe next time warm the bean and corn first.  Husband seemed to really like.  Adding some chicken and putting in a tortilla shell sounded pretty good for this, maybe next time.

This is very yummy and an easy side dish with tacos. I make a similar recipe and use chicken broth when cooking the rice instead of water. It gives it a bit more flavor. I love the addition of the lime in this one, though!

I cooked this for my family and it was enjoyed by everyone. I did change the recipe a bit though. I doubled the recipe because I have many to feed. I added in sauteed onions and garlic. I also added in an extra 2 teaspoons of lime juice and 1 teaspoon of cumin. I served it on tortilla shells with all the fixings for tacos. Everyone enjoyed it and the kids went back for seconds. It's always good when the kids go back for seconds.

It is a good basic dish. I used brown rice instead of yellow rice (it's what I had on hand.) I added some stredded pepperjack cheese to the top when I served it. Can't wait to try it the day after in a burrito!

I was not impressed. This was BLAND.  It tasted like the beans, rice and corn mixed together.  It needs more spice or something to give it a more exciting flavor.  I agree that it would be good for burritos.  Will not make again.

I made this with extra cumin, salt, pepper and lots of garlic. I sauted some shrimp with the above spices and served it atop the rice. My husband even liked it and said that it did not taste nearly as healthy as it was. I would make it again.

This really jazzed up my normally boring yellow rice. I, like many other reviewers, followed the directions on the box to cook the yellow rice. I was afraid the amount of water it called for wasn't going to be enough. I also added cilantro because I had it in the house and needed to use it up. I loved the cilantro in it! Thanks for the recipe tahoegirl.

I didn't see yellow rice at my grocery store so I just added a pinch of yellow food coloring to mine. I did sautee onion and garlic in the beginning and added more spices (cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, paprika, black pepper etc) to the rice for flavor. These were not anything really special imo, but they did look nice.

Yummy and cheap!  Will try with Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn for a bit more punch next time.  Added onions and garlic to the mix too!

I was looking for side dishes for the Salsa Chicken from this site.  I saw SunnyByrd's picture of this and had to try it.  I'm glad I did.  This is so simple and very good.  It came together in a snap.  My family enjoyed this.  I will make this again.

It is really good, but it is spectacular with some "frills" added. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes, a can of chopped green chilis,  more generous amount of cumin and a good amount of chili powder according to your heat tolerance.  Of course the lime juice (generously)

It is a great vegetarian dish, but I decided I wanted more of a main dish meal rather than a side. I cooked a pound of crumbled ground beef with onions and cumin and added that. I cooked it all together a short time to get it hot and meld flavors. It was spectacular as I said.

This is a good basic recipe.  I usually follow the recipe to the letter when I make it for the first time.  After reading the reviews, and considering my own instincts, I felt it needed something more.  I made the rice according to package directions (I can't imagine anything other than crunchy rice otherwise!), saut√©ed a stalk of celery (next time will use two), added two sliced green onions (will add two more next time), added two cloves of minced garlic, double the amount of cumin and lime juice.  I also added about of half cup of chopped cilantro (next time will add a full cup).  The corn I had on hand included diced poblano peppers and red bell pepper.  Next time (how many times have I said "next time"?  What does that tell you?) I'll add fresh poblano and red bell pepper.  I see this as a great side dish with chicken, as a stuffing for peppers or, as my husband recommended, a filling for omelets.  The only reason the recipe didn't get five stars is because I had to tinker with it.  For me, a five star rating means the dish is perfection as presented.  I think the rice would have been a little too bland for me as written...however the possibilities are endless!  Habanero pepper?  Serrano pepper?  thinly sliced pork? Ground beef mixed in?  Vegetarian tacos?  Next time....

This is a good recipe with the following additions: I sauted onion and garlic and added some diced tomato, I used 1/4 tsp of cumin but next time I will not put cumin at all. It turns out very good.

It was extremely bland unfortunately because the bean/corn/lime/cumin mix tasted so good. 

I added: mexican spice, paprika, salt and pepper, tabasco and slap ya mama spice to bring it up to taste better. Probably wouldn't make it again as a side.

Made as is, it's okay but pretty bland. I kept tasting it and tweaking and finally got it to where the family enjoyed it. Lots more lime juice, another tsp. of cumin, some chopped fresh tomato and sliced green onions and chopped cilantro did the trick. It's a good recipe to build on.

My family really enjoyed this and it was super easy to throw together.  I cooked the rice according to the directions on the mix. It was very good served warm and I had some leftover the next day and it was also good as a cold dish.

This recipe is amazing.  I made some substitutions, but not because it needed it.  I did not have yellow rice so I used basmati rice and substituted the water for chicken broth.  As other reviewers stated the amount of water is not enough so I added another cup of chicken broth.  Also, I did not have a lime so I used a lemon which was just as good.  This is a great recipe so enjoy it.

I prepared this recipe as written and it was excellent.  I think it could be stretched with more rice, and I wouldn't mind adding more cumin and lime juice because I like bold flavor.  The recipe seems to lend itself to variation, and I will likely try adobo seasoning in the next preparation and add green chiles or nopalitos.  I would also pass the hot sauce for those who like it.  All in all, it's a great vegetarian recipe.

I doctored this recipe so I'm only giving it 4 stars. I added some sauteed onion and minced garlic. I omitted the lime juice and cumin and used a packet of Goya sazon with cilantro. Really great side dish or vegetarian meal.

This was really good. I didn't have any yellow rice mix so I made my own. I used a bag of frozen southwest blend vegetables instead of the canned black beans and corn.

This recipe was very good and very easy.  I just wanted a simple recipe to serve with the marinated grilled shrimp from this site.  I had no idea how good it good be!  The only thing I would change is using the amount of water listed on the box.

It was a nice basic recipe, but I found it a little bland. When I made it the second time, I added some red bell peppers, onion, garlic, cilantro, and some taco seasoning, which definitely helped make it more flavorful.

What a tasty recipe!  We are big fans of yellow rice, black beans, and smoked summer sausage and have that as a meal quite often.  Tonight, I used your recipe, but tweeked it just a little.  Instead of 1 teaspoon of cumin, I used 2 teaspoons of cumin.  I also added fried/cut up smoked sausage links (we were out of smoked summer sausage), 1 cup of shredded (block) pepper jack cheese, and one can of diced (drained) tomatoes.  It turned out absolutely DELICIOUS!  My husband and son also loved it!

This was good. I used brown rice instead of package rice and I added a lot more cumin and added chopped tomato as well. Then to my own bowl I added dried chopped red chili pepper and cilantro and my husband added just the chili pepper. We all (including my children)added shredded mozzarella cheese on top. I am sure it would be just as good the way it was written. Would be good served with tortilla chips or as a side with enchiladas. It would be good with ground beef added as well.

I thought this was quite delicious.  It is an easy fast meal or side dish that goes well with an array of food.  I made it with the black bean cigars from here and they went perferct.  I did add some cilatnro as others recommended, but I think it would be just as good without it.  I used Zatarain's yellow rice mix and I think that made all the difference.  Thanks tahoe girl for a delcious recipe!

Delicious - would stir ingredients into rice on stove so it doesn't get cold so quickly. Added some cheese.

Not great.  No one liked it. Probably won't make again unless I do some fine tuning.

This is a very tasty recipe! Some of my picky younger siblings enjoyed it...that is saying a lot! I was a little disappointed, though, that I could not taste the lime juice or the cumin. Even so, this is a really tasty and super easy family-pleasing side dish. Thanks for sharing!

This is a simple easy favorite standby in our house!  I use Saffron flavored rice and add diced tomatoes.  For the meat eaters in my family I add some diced chicken (cooked in taco seasoning) and mixed in with the rice.  Easy, cost efficient and delicious!

This was delicious. Based on other reviews, I cooked the rice according to the package directions rather than this recipe's directions. I did everything else the same, except using frozen corn instead of canned (personal preference) and added a little cilantro. It was wonderful alongside Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken from this website. I will definitely make this again, maybe add some cheese and/or tomato too just to mix it up. Thanks for the submission.

Easy and yummy!  I used Zatarain's Yellow Rice Mix - prepared as directed on pkg, (instead of the suggested amounts of water & oil) and then added the other ingredients.  Great side dish!

I turned this into a crock pot recipe. My pot allows me to sautee as well so I browned 4 chicken thighs. Remove them when the skin was crisp and reserved.Then threw in a handful of cherry tomatoes sauteed in the chicken fat cooked them until they popped. Then I added the fresh corn that was cut from the cob (3 ears)  sauteed for a few minutes then added the can of black beans. Seasoned all with cumin added yellow rice and water put chicken back on top and put on low heat.

Kind of bland as is.  Definitely need to fix it up with more spices.  I will try it again but will use Jasmine rice next time instead of yellow rice and maybe a can of Rotel tomatoes.

Made this just the other night. Doubled everything listed in the directions plus one can of diced tomatoes just because I love them. I used Goya yellow rice. I added some smoky black pepper after I tasted it, felt I needed a little bit more zing. My granddaughter loved it and I took some to work today for my lunch and everybody was going crazy for the good smell in the office.

This recipe sounded so good to me, but my husband and I were disappointed in the final product.   It made a fairly good side dish but the strong spice made it too spicy to have as a main dish.

Good beans & rice base recipe. I made a few changes: used brown minute rice because it's what I had on hand, added saut√©ed onion and garlic, and added salt and pepper. For those who say it's too bland, I'd recommend adding saut√©ed onions, a little extra lime juice & topping with sour cream or salsa.

A very easy way to add a bit of variety to rice. It is a good basic recipe to which a variety of other ingredients could be added based on individual tastes.

I made this for a very picky vegetarian friend of ours (I'm not vegetarian nor cook much) and it was a smashing success, they could not get enough.   Instead of a chicken base like others suggested, I used a vegetable base and it added much more flavor than simply using water (and the amount of water shown in the recipe is way too low, use the amount shown on your rice package).    My wife just asked for this recipe so she could make it again, best thing I've ever made apparently!!!

I made it and followed the recipe to a T. My rice was burnt and it was quite bland.
If I make it again, I will do the usual 2 parts water to 1 part rice and leave the juice from the corn and or beans as an additional liquid to make the dish a little more flavorful. I doubled the cumin and used lemon juice instead of lime juice.

This was great! Super easy and tasty- perfect for a weeknight meal. I used about 2 cups chicken broth and about a 1/2c water and also added cilantro at the end. I then layered sour cream and cheese in a quesadilla and rolled it with the rice to eat. My 2 and 4 year gobbled this up with no complaints! I'll definitely make again!

This was good. I sauteed onion and garlic then added rice mix.Next time I will make my own yellow rice and add a can of rotels. Or will make  browned beef with taco seasoning and rotels and throw in crockpot on low for the day.

Soooo yummy!!! One of the top three recipes  my family loves.  I did change a few things but didn't deviate to much from the recipe. I used a rice cooker instead of my stove top, and used chicken stock or broth instead of water. I added about a tsp. More of lime juice, a half tsp. more of cumin.  Instead of regular canned corn I used the fiesta corn for a tad bit more flavor.  Don't forget the cilantro, it brings everything together.
Definitely will continue to make this.

I used the ingredients just to make blackbeans and corn for my chicken tacos...and whatever leftover bean and corn I had, I simply mixed it with rice the next day and added a little more cumin...turned out great..

Slight changes but it was great. Used mahatma spicy saffron yellow rice and made it according to the package, and I didn't have any canned corn so I used frozen. Added diced onion, tomato, and some chopped cilantro. Then topped it with some grated cojita cheese, it was delicious!

Just tried this tonight for dinner...and the hubby requested a container of it to take to work for his lunch tomorrow. To me, that says it all. I'll definitely make this again. BUT...I messed up the recipe, didn't read it all the way through and just put everything into the pot with the rice mix and cooked it. Didn't seem to matter, it came out wonderful! LOVE when that happens! lol Thanks for sharing, Tahoegirl!

This recipe was very good, quick and easy, and went great with our tacos last night!  One important thing... I decided I would skip rinsing the black beans.  Big mistake.  Although it didn't change the taste of the dish, it made the rice look gray, not appealing in appearance.  Don't hesitate to try this easy side dish, just be sure to rinse those black beans!

I have made this several times to serve with enchilladas, tacos, etc. and everyone always raves about it! Even my husband,who is not a big cumin fan, loves it! I always cook the rice according to the directions on the package, then add the other ingrediants. Delicious, easy & tastes so fresh - what more can you ask for? Making again tonight to serve with crockpot fajitas Thanks tahoegirl!

I love sweet potatoes and have a whole bunch of them on hand. I decided to try this recipe. Unfortunately I didn't have the chipotle spice so I just used curry  powder instead. I don't like hot foods anyway so this wasn't a problem for me.
I did roasted potatoes and just the smell alone make me hungry. Thank you so much for this very nice dinner meal  for a cold winter night.

Recipe will vary depending on what brand of rice you use. Where I live (SF Bay Area) the chain grocery stores carry 3 different kinds of "yellow rice": (1) Indian - mostly flavored with saffron, (2) New Orleans Style - their website has flavor ingredients listed as onion, salt, red/green bell pepper, MSG, sugar, garlic, spices (incl. tumeric & red pepper); & (3) Spanish Style - flavored with chicken bouillion, chicken flavor, chicken powder, garlic, celery, more chicken, onions, bell pepper, coriander...the point being brand #3 has a ton of chicken flavor & is likely quite different in flavor than #2. I used #3 Goya Spanish Style & found it to be quite flavorful, though I did use 2 cups of water plus 1 Tbsp oil because that's what it says to use on the package. Adding in corn, beans, cumin, lime enhances the packaged rice & I'd give the flavor of this brand of rice prepped according to pkg directions 3 1/2 stars bumped up to 4 stars for being so easy to prep with pantry ingredients.

There was no way that amount of water matched that amount of rice, so I adjusted accordingly. The flavor was okay - the corn made a nice crunch. I wouldn't add the beans next time. I found them too squishy and not very flavorful.

Fantastic!  We altered just the cooking method.  When we cook rice, we first boil the water and then add the rice.  We also use a 2:1 water to rice ratio, so we used two cups of boiling water, to one cup of seasoned rice.  This was fantastic, I loved the added sweetness of the corn. Unfortunately my three-year olds didn't eat it, but they haven't eaten much of anything lately.  My husband, who is not a a rice fan- did eat it (woo hoo).  My husband ate it as a side dish, and I pushed aside the pork chops to continue eating serving after serving of rice.  Thank you for a quick and easy side dish.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy.  I made it as a topping for nachos, but will make it again as a side dish.  I made it as stated in the recipe, but added some fresh cilantro.  Easy to do in electric rice cooker.  My whole family loved it, including my somewhat picky three year old!

Excellent as written -although the directions on my yellow rice called for 2 cups of water, and it needed it. I did however add some cilantro and quartered grape tomatoes, and a little garlic salt to our taste. My bf raved about it! A definite make-again.

I just made this for the first time.  The rice was not cooked long enough (crunchy) so I suggest following the directions on the box then add the other stuff.  It looked, smelled, and tasted yummy. But, after reading some other reviews who encouraged to add tomatoes, I decided to throw in my homemade pico di gallo I had in the fridge.  OMG!  I looked wonderful, and tasted just as good.  Definately a keeper!  Thank you for the base recipie and the suggestions.

As stated before, very flexable as to what you put in it.  A keeper for sure
