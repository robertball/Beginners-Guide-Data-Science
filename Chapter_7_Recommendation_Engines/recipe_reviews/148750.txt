I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out really great. I was reluctant because I usually go with chicken when ordering this at restaurants but in the end I felt that the carrots and bok choy made for an excellent alternative.

I made this last night for a dinner party along with some curry and it was so good! I used ginger instead of galangal because that was all I could find. I went to Thailand about 6 years ago and besides not having the traditional meat in it this was very close to what I had there. Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. I turned down the heat substantially because my wife can't eat spicy food. I substituted 3 teaspoons of dried ginger for the galangal slices. I doubled the recipe so the yield was 12 servings. I skipped the lime leaves and lemon grass. I substituted a 4 ounce can of (mild) diced chiles for the hot chile paste. Finally I cut the fish sauce down to 3 tablespoons. This was a delicious soup for a cold winter dinner.

I basically liked this recipe.  Normally I cheat and use Tom Yum paste from my Asian supermarket, so it was a nice surprise to approximate the taste myself.  I found it slightly too salty and sour, though.  Next time will cut back on the lime juice and fish sauce.  And I wanted some protein, so I added in deveined, shelled, raw prawn.  After we had eaten, I went back and tinkered with the broth some more to see if I could improve it.  I added sugar, and voila, all better!  The sweet element was the missing flavor that I was looking for.  I have to admit I also missed the bit of fat from coconut milk here, but I guess that's a whole different soup, isn't it?  Tom Ka Gai, anyone?  : )

Very tasty - however it was too hot for me. Normally I order medium spice when I order this out... So I would suggest small additions of the hot chili so that you can get it just right for you. I ended up adding milk (didn't have any coconut milk on hand) and it is still hot but still wonderfully yummy...

my wife loved it i loved it. cooking something like this is a good surprrise to the one you love. anyways some notes for me and for others as well. - may be put more than just 1 inch for lemon grass so for some who can't/won't eat the lemongrass it can easily be discarded. - adding shitaki mushrooms and/or button mushrooms just sliced it once - you can use baby bok choy sliced once - if you want hot 5 tbps of chilli paste - for the stock you can boil 2 pcs chicken thigh and use that liquid to for the soup and perhaps add 2 cans of non msg chicken broth. although this is a veggie soup i improvised by adding fresh large shrimps shrimp balls and the chicken pieces used for the stock and place that on a different serving plate.

This was absolutely delicious. I only changed the recipe slightly - I used chicken broth rather than stock and used ginger instead galangal. I also added one extra tablespoon of chili paste. Oh I added shrimp and chicken as well but it would have been great without either of those. I will be making this soup often!

The amount of fish sauce with the high amount of sodium did not work for me. Very disappointed.

I could not get this recipe to produce the Tom Yum flavor I was looking for. Probably my fault.

Loved the flavors. I added broccoli to it since the local Thai place always has them in their soup. I failed at locating Kaffir Leaves but now I am on a mission to find them for next time. Substituted Fish Sauce for Vegan Fish Sauce to make it Vegan Friendly. Very yummy and tasty!!

I made a vegan version of this (vegetable stock instead of chicken stock) for some friends (one of which was vegan) and it turned out amazing! It truly turned out just like the version I have had in Thai restaurants. I have been asked to make it again since because it is so good! Just be careful to actually measure the chili paste because I eye-balled it instead and had to suffer the spicy consequences!

Loved this recipe followed it exactly until the end. I added bean curd noodles to the soup. I was unsure about eating the lemon grass and galangal as they were both still very chewy after cooking for the listed time. Please add a few more details regarding those 2 items. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this one again for sure!

this was awesome with some modifications/deviations.. i halved this recipe since this was just for me and my bf.. i used chicken boullion for the chicken stock.. used 1.5 t of ground ginger instead of galangal used the zest of one small lemon since i didn't have the lime leaves added one more T of hot chile paste added 2 dried red chiles (we love spicy) substituted light soy sauce for fish sauce didn't have lime and used the juice of 1.5 small lemons diced half of a small onion in place of the shallots diced up some beefsteak tomato since that's what i had used regular shredded cabbage instead of bok choy sliced up the rest of my baby carrots i had in the fridge used at least twice the amount of cilantro and threw it in while the soup was simmering.. didn't bother adding the green onions.. basically made this work on the cheap.. ty for the inspiration

Believe me when I say I absolutely love Tom Yum soup. I've eaten it in California Nevada Missouri Colorado Texas and Oklahoma. Every state I visit I find a Thai restaurant with top ratings and try their Tom Yum. This soup is amazing! I tried the recipe step by step (besides tomatoes I hate tomatoes). It's the only recipe I use now! Sooo good!

It was super yummy! I only used one tbsp of chili paste any more would have been too much. It was perfect.

I liked it but needed to tweak it a tad to get it to my taste....was a bit too much chili and lime for me....lime was a tad too sour and I know it is Thai and usually spicy....but I did like mine toned down a tad...ended up likeing it to my taste using 2 TB chili paste and 6 TB lime...so 2/3 the amount called for.
