Very yummy and moist bread- trust me, you won't miss the oil in this bread! I had some pumpkin pie spice that I had mixed up on hand and used 1 1/2 tsp of that and it was perfectly spiced. My kids loved it, great after school treat, thanks for the recipe!

I was craving something sweet but healthy and this did the trick. The applesauce and pumpkin make this bread very moist and adding in the chocolate chips is a must if you need that extra kick of sweetness. It's good for breakfast as well as it has a lot of healthy goodness to start the morning.

Less fat and less sugar doesn't always taste good, but I am happy to find a healthy recipe that actually IS delicious.  I used my own pureed pumpkin, and upon the suggestion of another, added an extra 1/2 of sugar to make up for unseasoned puree.  But I might even try 1/4 cup instead, and see what happens.  I served it to friends, and they demanded the recipe.

Good low fat version. Very moist. I didn’t add chocolate chips and I added slightly more spice as a reviewer suggested and I sprinkled walnuts on top. Very flavourful. My mum loved it. She said it was as good as anything you would buy at a cafe.

I thought it was good for a healthier recipe. Definitely not sweet. If your looking for sweet, I would stick a more  traditional recipe. My kids liked it. That should say a lot. Picky eaters!

I just made this and it's excellent! Moist ad holds up just like a bread filled with oils and sugar. Definitely something worth trying. Could maybe use more spices, so feel free to toss a bit more than called for.

This was lighter than I thought it would be, and turned out very well. I only had pumpkin purée instead of pumpkin pie filling, so I added a half cup of sugar, and .5 times more spices. Great overall recipe! We'll make it again.

Wonderful taste and very moist. Very full flavor without all the calories and fat of comparable recipes.

This was wonderful! Very easy to make, flavourful and moist. Unfortunately all I had in the house was all-purpose white flour, so I had to use that instead of the whole wheat flour called for, but other than that I followed the recipe as is. It did need a full hour in the oven. A nice change of pace when you're tired of banana bread. It tastes even better the next day. Thanks for sharing!
