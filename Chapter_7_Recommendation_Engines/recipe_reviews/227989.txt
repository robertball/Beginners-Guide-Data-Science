Loved it!  cut the portions down for the first try but will make a much larger batch next time, maybe even try freezing some.

Don’t let the curry scare you. This is a very sweet dish even after doubling the amount of curry, which gets hidden with all the other sweet notes. We used chicken breasts, which worked well. Add salt. Serve over rice. This dish will not be on my regular rotation, but if I find myself with extra cranberry sauce, I’d make it again trying it in a crockpot.

I liked this recipe, the cranberries, apple, raisins & the curry., all combined makes a very interesting flavor. Tried it with the Jasmine rice ( which I've never had before) did not like it. So I switched it for brown wild rice.  And I added broccoli as my veggie.
