The concept was great and I only adapted it a little bit. I took the advice of another review and sauteed the onions in olive oil with oregano and salt until they were soft. I also, rather than use just tomatoes, I simmered the tomatoes with oregano, garlic, and the paprika that was mentioned. I did not boil the eggplant, rather used a covered casserole dish and left the entire thing in for a hour. I served it with rice and it was far from bland and VERY good. A super healthy dish.

Sooo delicious.  I had this same dish, or one very like it, at a restaurant in Russia and have been trying to recreate it since.  I made sure my onions were sliced very thin so that they would be sufficiently cooked in the oven, but still have some of the oomph which would be lost by sauteeing.  This is definitely going into a regular rotation in my kitchen.

I was somewhat surprised by how this dish turned out.  When I first cooked it, it seemed somewhat bland.  I am not sure what, but there was something about the flavor that was odd, not really full and savory, but not really unpleasant.  As suggested by other reviewers, I sauteed the onion, and instead of boiling the eggplant I simply put it in the casserole raw, covered the dish, and cooked it for a little over an hour.  (I don't like the idea of boiling veggies when other means of cooking exist because I want to preserve their nutrients and flavors as much as possible.) Otherwise I made no other modifications.  I think what surprises me the most is how I really like it a lot more after being reheated in the microwave.  This seems unusual to me.  There is still something missing IMO about the taste.  I am not sure what to suggest other than the flavors seem to come out underdeveloped.  I think this could be fantastic if the flavors were a little richer and full.  Perhaps seasoning the eggplant with pepper and cumin or coriander prior to putting them in the casserole might help.  I like the creaminess of the sauce combined with the subtleties of the onion and tomato, I just wish there was more of a savory accent to draw it all together.

I also sauteed onions in olive oil with spices, then did the same with tomatoes. Turned out great! Family loved it. 

It's a very famous recipe called "under the coat" or with literal translation "under the fur coat" (pod shoo-boy). You can cook many dishes under the coat (of sour cream or mayo).

So good! I made three of each layer, and due to others comments on blandness and not enough sauce, I used about 1 3/4 cups sour cream, 2 tsp salt, and 3 cloves of roasted garlic. I added some evaporated milk to stretch the sauce too but it didn't need it, it was a little watery (I forgot to sprinkle layers with flour per the recipe, I think that would've helped too). But it was savory and delicious, even people who didn't like eggplant or onions loved it and asked for the recipe. Thanks!

For the most part I agree with the others...rather bland. However, I am sitting here eating it for lunch and served it over a plate of spinach, bulgar and pine nuts. Much tastier. If I made this again I'd actually bake it with a layer of spinach and maybe a sprinkling of parm.

this recipe was great. The first time I boild my eggplant and sauteed onions in olive oil, next time I steamed onions and eggplant ,  i used a can of italian stewed tomatoes both times, and at each stage of steaming put garlic across teh top.  i was generous wth the paprika on top of the whole thing too.  it was far from bland.  i also used cottage cheese in with the sour cream as i was low on the sour cream the and didnt wish to run to teh store.  i am rating it a four because it does not say to steam or boil the veggies and i feel it should.

we really enjoy this simple dish, so much so that i make it on a regular basis. i never parboil the eggplant; i just layer the ingredients and season with salt and pepper on every layer. i add the lemon juice to the sour cream and about four cloves or a big tablespoon of garlic to the sour cream. super simple, creamy and not all that bad for you. bake it for about an hour or until the top is bubbly and golden. i really enjoy it over calrose.

We eat alot of tzitziki at our house. And sometimes I make it with sour cream instead of yogurt. I was looking for recipes that used sour cream and came across this one. So I used tzitzikti I made from sour cream in this recipe instead of just plain sour cream. I drizzled a little bit of olive oil on the bottom and on each layer. Also I sprinkled each layer with  some chopped up fresh parsley and crumbled feta. It was really good! If you like everything with a greek flare, you will love this. Also I did not boil my eggplant. I just cooked 20 mins longer.

Excellent dish! I would recommend a very large eggplant, as it shrinks significantly when you boil it. It's great served over rice!

I followed the recipe to a "t". We like it and probably will be the only way we eat eggplant again.  The only thing I had trouble with was that I did not get a nice sauce. I think it was because there was too much water from not draining the eggplant enough after boiling.  We'll certainly try it again and drain the eggplant longer.

Very delicious recipe.. although my girlfriend was born and raised in Russia and had never heard of it ;) Anyhow, I would definitely try it again, maybe with less onion next time though.

In my case, the sauce never really got  made, maybe cause I used yogurt instead of sour cream. I also believe that the onions would better if sauted a little. Its not a great recipe but certainly not bad either.

We did not enjoy this recipe at all. It was definitely way too bland. The eggplant was extremely mushy and was not enjoyable. My fiance is an eggplant-fan, but she had half of one, I had half (if that) of one.

Never again!!  There was no sauce, there was certainly no "sumptuousness". There is nothing positive to say about boiled eggplant and the sour cream topping turned to leather in the oven.

I've never cooked eggplant myself, but I figured I'd give it a go here. This. was. Delicious. I made small adjustments as other reviews suggested.  Sauteed onions in olive oil with salt pepper, oregano(and threw in a few mushrooms) and sauteed the tomato slices for maybe a minute each(added garlic powder and oregano there too.)  Did not boil the eggplant.  Will definitely make again

I don't really like eggplant, but I keep trying. I liked this. At first I wasn't sure, but with the second bowlful I figured I must like it. It has a tangy and pleasant flavor. I would not call it bland at all. I served it over millet. I actually liked it better leftover (for breakfast!). I did not boil the vegetable and mine came out watery I think because of that. I will broil or boil the eggplant next time. Also, it was not "creamy" I think because I used low fat sour cream. The onions should be sliced very thin and added raw - they really do add a nice texture and flavor. I will make it again but I will follow the recipe more closely. Yup, it was really good.

My family did not like this recipe, although I thought it was ok.  I even sauteed the onions like another reviewer suggested.  I might have given it a 4, but since my family didn't like it, I feel I have to give this recipe a 3.

This turned out pretty well, but the onions were not cooked at all. The sauce was delicious. I would reccomend sauteing the onions first the serving this dish with some cornbread or other type of bread.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, besides apparently not have the right size baking pan, but this came out kind of flat. No baking up or bubbling of the sauce, and I had a pile of onion left over, after covering it excessively. Flavor is good, just wish the sauce had turned out better.

I loved the combination of ingredients,  but it was kind of bland.  Next time I make this  (and I will!) I'll season and maybe brown the Eggplant before starting the layers.

The cooking time is too short, and with further cooking the onions are not sufficiently cooked. I did not like the sauce it made.

I used havarti and mozzarella cheese instead of the sour cream, but still it wasn't right for me! I think the flour can be eliminated from the recipe and 2 onions are too

I thought this was really tasty!  I've never boiled eggplant before but was willing to try it.  The lemon juice in the first step really complimented the overall taste.  Surprisingly I could still taste a hint of lemon even after I boiled it.  The only thing I did different was to microwave my onions for about a minute before layering them.  And I also added garlic salt on each of my layers.  Will make this again!

It was good, but it didn't get saucy enough. I think I'll add a can of mushroom soup to the sour cream next time.

We needed to cook it a lot longer than specified for some reason, like 2:30 before the onions got where we wanted them and by that time the eggplant had disintegrated into the sauce. It was still delicious and we're looking forward to our next trial. I also added some cauliflower and potatoes which were nice additions.

More eggplant less onion.  I would suggest 1 onion if you choose not to add extra eggplant. The 3 rating is for the overpowering onion. Need more of a eggplant presence versus onion.   I used diced tomatoes for the tomato layer and added fresh tomatoes on top.  I would not change this for next time.  Leaving the extra tomato and reducing the onion would make this better tasting.  Add dill too.

Love Love Loved it! I have eggplant and sour cream (admittedly, two of my favourite things) left over in my fridge and I thought I'd see if Allrecipes had anything that would use them both. I didn't boil the eggplant (I don't approve of boiling vegetables with the possible exception of potatoes) but I also had Asian eggplants, so I didn't need to salt them. I just cut them up, layered with the flour, tomato and onion, more flour, eggplant again. Then it turned out that I only had one c up of sour cream, so I topped it up with some mayo and I also threw some parmesan in there. It was so delicious!

I decided to make this even though there were multiple mediocre reviews. It was so bland.
