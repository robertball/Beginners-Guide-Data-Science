This sauce is soooo awesome.  I used salmon & broiled in oven - it caramelized the sauce & made the fish so tasty, especially over rice and steamed veggies.  I used light soy sauce.  Also boiled remaining marinade to use as sauce on the side.  Easy weeknight recipe, but I would definitely serve to friends too!

This is a really good sauce!  I used it to marinate a whole fish that had slits cut on the side.  I also added a bit more ginger, only because I do like my ginger :)  I steamed the fish and with the leftover sauce, I added some cornstarch and water to make a thicker sauce to drizzle over after serving.  Low fat and good!

We were given some free "just-caught" mackerel by some local fishermen - I had never eaten or cooked mackerel before - and this was a very tasty recipe! I cut slits in the skin of the mackerel as suggested by other reviewers. I didn't have mirin so substituted white wine. I thought the soya sauce would be overpowering but it wasn't at all. It is a good recipe to eat while watching a DVD at home, as you really do need to "pick through the bones" slowly with mackerel.

The sauce was good, but it was a bit too sweet for our taste since the mirin was already sweet to begin with. The taste also didn't stay with the fish, it was rather bland unless you dip it into the sauce... Next time I'd try slicing the side of the fish before marinating.

This was sooo good and easy! I omitted the extra sugar and added a tsp of chinese chili paste as well. Grilled it, basted it and ate it over steamed rice with Japanese broccoli. My husband wanted more, but I ate it all. :)

This recipe worked great on salmon. I used some of the cooked sauce on white rice and it was delicious. The salmon turned out juicy and well cooked.

Very good! I find mackerel very fatty, and this seemed to cut down on the greasy taste!  Easy to prepare too!

Terrific marinade.  I used this to marinate salmon fillet, and it was A-#1 in flavor.  Thanks for the great post, Jana.

The only thing I did differently is add 1 teaspoon of chili sauce to give it punch.  It was perfect.

I was hoping for something more crisp out of the broiler, but alas the fish came out with a soft texture, even with extra cooking time.  Salt (a lot) helps, but I'll pass this recipe next time and use the fry-pan instead.

My father-in-law really enjoyed this...and he is a boiled fish and potatoes kind of guy! I didn't have the Japanese wine, so I just used red wine that we had on hand. Next time I will  marinate overnight for more taste. I also thickened with a little cornstarch at the end and used it as a sauce with the fish. That was very popular with the family.Thanks!

For crispy skin, I pan-fried covered on MED-LO. 3 min each side. Remove fish, cook marinade liquid, pour over fish.

I used this on some King Mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico and grilled it. The end result was awesome. I believe using the sauce as both a marinade and a basting sauce as suggested made the difference between good and great.

Very easy, and I'd be willing to do this recipe again. I let my fillets marinate overnight, so the flavor sunk in well. It didn't completely saturate the fillets, which is good, because I still wanted to taste the fish. I cut waaay back on the sugar, since the mirin is so sweet, but that means I didn't really get a caramelized coating. Still tasted great, but if you're going for crunch, you might want to use the full amount of sugar. Some of the coating burned while under the broiler, but those bits scraped away very easily and the meat below was not overcooked. Just wanted to point that out for any other broiler newbies like me; don't panic when you see the black bubbles. My broiler has a low and high setting, and the recipe did not specify which to use. I did high, and it was fully cooked by the minimum suggested time. One more tip: leave the oven door open while it's broiling, if you can. It keeps steam from building up in the oven, and steam will prevent your fish from crisping up at all (you might as well have baked it at that point).

I am not a mackeral eater but my family went fishing yesterday and came home with about 5 pounds of mackeral filets. I used this marinade recipe substituting white wine for the Japanese wine, marinating for 1 hour & then I grilled the fish skin side down for about 7-8 minutes over high heat. It was surprisingly good. Would make again.

This "Japanese Broiled Mackerel" is excellent! It is also a perfect "quick and easy" meal for a busy day. I had bought some kingfish not knowing that it was a type of mackerel. This cooking method completely transformed a very smelly fish into a delicious treat in very little time (20 minutes of marination). I boiled the leftover marinade to make a sauce, and it was excellent with the addition of a little toasted sesame oil, but very salty. Next time I make this recipe I will use low-sodium soy sauce. Thank you Jana Marko for sharing your recipe.

Very good!  I used sherry instead of mirin and crystallized ginger.  Fish was caught earlier in the day by my boyfriend at the Sunshine Skyway fishing pier - Spanish Mackerel.  Fresh is best!

It is good but a little heavier than I prefer. The miso bass recipe from this site has a better lighter flavor so I will go back to that next time I make mackerel.

I didn't have any mirin but I had the mackerel so I used coconut vinegar instead of the mirin. The taste was wonderful.  Thanks so much for the springboard.
