We did not have any stew meat, but did have a ham bone left over, so used that instead.  Because we didn't need to cook the ham, it did not take as long to cook as the original recipe.  We think the butter is really the secret ingredient here.

This is delicious and filling.  However, it had a lot of meat in comparison to the black-eyed peas, even though I decreased the meat down to 2 lbs.  I think an extra package of black-eyed peas could be added since this is called Mom's Black-Eyed Peas" and not "Mom's Beef with Black-Eyed Peas".  The butter is the key to this tasty dish!

Hey this is really good! The beef is a nice change from the same old ham or pork. I will make this again and it will be before next new years! Thank you L. Milfon for sharing.

It was OK.  I have come to the conclusion that I am not a big fan of black-eyed-peas in general.  I don't really like the "earthy" flavor...kind of reminds me of eating dirt!  This recipe is sooooo not healthy.  While butter based anything is sure to be delicious, healthy, it is not!  So while it tasted OK, I would not make this again because of too many calories.

This was a good recipe, but very high in fat, cholesterol, sodium and carbs.

This recipe was extremely bland!
I wanted to try something different with the peas but I should've stuck with the 'Southern way' pork pork and more pork. There wasn't any flavor to these at all!

Really enjoyed this dish.  Added smoke turkey and had to let some liquid remain at the end to pour over my rice.
