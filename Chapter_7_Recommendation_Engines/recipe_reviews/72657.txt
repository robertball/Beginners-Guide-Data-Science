This really is the best tasting hamburger ever!  All the people here complaining that it tastes too much like meatloaf can just go back to eating their boring old meat burgers with salt and pepper, because this recipe if for folks who desire some real flavor in the meat.  I made this recipe exactly as described, except I ommited the garlic clove, and used only a teaspoon of powdered garlic.  For the onion I used a red onion.  I mixed all of the other ingredients together before adding the meat, and I knew I was in for a treat when I saw how thick and rich all of the flavor ingredients were.  I used a george foreman grill, and was very happy with the final results.  My only mistake was my condiments.  There is no need to add a slice of onion on the burger, because it will be too overpowering.  Keep it down to a minimal with maybe just a slice of lettuce and a slice of tomatoe, and enjoy this hamburger for the flavor already in it.  Looking forward to leftovers tonight!

Way toooooo SALTY!!! This recipe packs a lot of flavor but it's just NOT balanced.  Too much salt and I didn't even use salt.  Not one pinch!  Cut down on the onion soup mix...maybe this will help cut the salty flavor.

I served this recipe a month ago, and it was very good. We're doing it again tonight. The only changes I made were to go light on the herbs & spices--about half the asked-for amounts. And no salt at all. The onion soup mix and soy sauce add all that's needed.

Made them for Mother's Day because my mom loves hamburgers and she took one bite and couldn't eat the rest.  Way too many ingredients and the rosemary was dreadful in a hamburger.

This may be a good recipe if you want your burgers to taste like meatloaf.  -plus, that was without the onion soup mix. With the soup mix would be far too much seasoning.  Won't use this burger recipe again.

Maybe not the best, but very very good.  Maybe all the onion soup is a touch too much.  I'll make these again.

Too much salt.  The onion soup mix is basically nothing but salt and dried onions, then you have all the salt from the cheese, soy, and worcestershire. WAY too salty for anyone in my family to enjoy!

I should have paid attention to the negative reviews on this one.  This is definitely a case of less is more - way too much going on here and you end up with something that tastes more like meatloaf than a burger.  I even used low sodium soy sauce left out the salt and the rosemary. Don't get me wrong, I like meatloaf and this recipe would make a very good meatloaf if that's what you're looking for but when you want a burger - you WANT a burger.

Very good, very tasty, very moist patty.   After reading the other reviews, I did back off using the full amount of herbs ( and I had no dried rosemary).   However, next time, and there will be a next time, I'll use the recipe as is, and then assess where I need to cut back.
Update: I've now made over 300 patties using this recipe.  I use the recipe as written, cut nothing back, although I do add a crushed stack of Saltine (salted tops) crackers (as per another reviewer).  I use extra lean ground beef and there is no shrinkage. Raves all round from our diners.

I have to agree w/ one reviewer who said that they are good if you like meat loaf...For me, burgers w/ a little salt and pepper, maybe a bit of powdered garlic and that's it...Over hard wood charcoal, are excellent...No fluff, just good burgers....For all the grillers out there, if you haven't tryed a good hard wood charcoal, and are still using the brickettes, that have a lot of fillers, not to mention an oil base or some kind of petro-chemical, you haven't tasted the meat! Try it, you'll be amazed...

I modified this recipe a lot.  I knew I wasn't going to enjoy the basil, oregano, parsley and rosemary in my burger so I left those out.  I used 1.25lbs of ground beef.  I strained out the powder part of an onion soup mix leaving only the dried onion bits to add to the meat.  I added 1tsp of reduced sodium Worcestershire sauce, no soy sauce, 1tbsp on garlic powder, 1 egg, 1tsp of salt and about 1tbsp of fresh ground pepper and 1/3 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I fried up some bacon and fried my burgers in the rendered fat. I don't have a grill. :(   I mixed up some yellow mustard with ketchup as a condiment, a slice of bacon or two on them, slapped some cheese on it and had them like that.  We all liked them.  For our taste, they weren't too salty.  They were flavorful and moist that way.  Good recipe to adjust to your own tastes.  Thanks!

Too much salt and didn't care for the chemical taste of the onion soup mix. Just using onions and eliminating the garlic would be a big help. There is salt in that soy sauce and worchestshire sauce, too. Just way too much salt.

These were good, but I only gave them a rating of 3 stars becasue I did amend the recipe to fit my family's taste. I did not add the parsley, basil, and rosemary and only added a 1/2 clove of garlic and even left our the minced onion and used onion powder instead. Added all the green seasoning reminded us too much of meatloaf which most of my family members are not fans of and given the reviews which said this burger tasted like a mini meatloaf I decided to omit these items. i substituted the colby cheese for sharp cheddar and baked them on grill slates in my oven. These were nice flavorful juicy burgers.

best ever hamburger for those that say too salty remember it says 1 ounce of dry onion soup not whole package. But I leave out the cheese. so that could be the difference. Put on cheese for those that like it at the end.

Very similar to the Ranch Burger, but instead it is the Onion Burger.  It does taste a bit like meatloaf, but in my opinion, that's a good thing. I don't know what has happened to hamburger meat at the stores, but it just has almost no flavor anymore, so we have to add some flavor to it. I made a few changes to this recipe.  I used bleu cheese instead of colby or jack cheese.  I used 1/4 cup dry old fashioned oatmeal to make it a bit softer and moister. I also wanted to up the flavor a bit, but cut back on the salt, so I only used one fourth of a packet of onion soup mix, and to it I added 1/2 teaspoon dry curry powder (salt free), 1/2 teaspoon of Mrs. Dash seasoning (salt free), 1/4 teaspoon onion powder (salt free), 1/4 teaspoon ground celery seed (salt free), 1/4 teaspoon ground cayanne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper. I also added one heaping teaspoon of the finely minced garlic that comes in the little jars at the store (it's the garlic they use at most Chinese food restaurants). Wow! That was flavorful! Mix it all together with the finely chopped onion (I only used a small onion), oats and hamburger so that the seasoning is well distributed throughout.  I left all the other ingredients the same.  I think the dried oregano, basil, thyme, and rosemary made it so much better than I had even expected it to be.  They are such savory spices.

This is the first burger I can eat without loading condiments on it. I followed the recipe minus the salt and rather than shredding the cheese, I cut it into cubes and stuffed it in the middle of the patty. It made the lean ground beef a bit juicier. Absolutely delicious. I will definitely be making these again and I can't wait for next summer. This will be a fantastic recipe to make at the cottage!

Best burger ever! The title was true! The only thing that I added was saltine crackers. I put the whole stick of crackers to 1.3 pounds of ground beef. Yum!

I ended up omiting chopped onions- we like ours fresh, no garlic powder, no rosemarie and no salt - I made most of the patties thin and one thick as hubby like, the thin ones are the way to go- we found the thick one to much but we loved it! Would try again- if the kids love it, you know you are onto something!

These were really good!  I took the advice of others and used 2 lbs of meat for the 4 serving 1 1/2 lb recipe.  I  think that helped in making sure the flavor was not too over powering.  Using 2 lbs, I got 6 nice size burgers out of it.
   My only complaint would be that I thought there was a bit too much onion flavor.  Although it didn't taste bad, just maybe too much.  (I think 1/2 of an onion is up for interruption depending on how big the onion is in the first place.) So Next time I will not add real onion (or maybe just a little), just the soup mix.  
  We all enjoyed them. Even our 2 yr old gobbled up a whole burger !!  She never eats that much!
   Other than that, excellent burger.  i will use this recipe from now on!  Thanks!

I took other reviewer's advice, and cut back a little on the onion soup mix, and these truly are the best hamburgers!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic. There's a lot going on here, so it's not a burger for those who prefer a simpler taste... but that's not me!

These were okay... I didn't care for the herby flavor, and none of the toppings seemed to really go with this, even mayonnaise which pretty much goes with anything. Too much competition between flavors, and beef was lost in there. I didn't add the chopped onion as I felt the onion soup was oniony enough for us. Hubby grilled these with mesquite charcoal. I am surprised at the high star rating because I certainly am not impressed with these burgers.

If I could give this 00 stars I would. Positively disgusting!! Who puts rosemary, basil, and oregano in a hamburger?? I can see the cheese, egg, soy and Worchestersire sauce, onion, and maybe a little onion soup mix. But with all those herbs, it was positively inedible. It's a good thing I only made one burger as a trial burger. Or I would have wasted $10. In chopped meat!

Wow I absolutely loved this recipe.  Here's the thing. Leave out the onion soup mix and the rosemary.  If you do that you will have tasty delicious burgers.  I have no idea what everyone is talking about with the meatloaf.  Nothing resembling meatloaf ever hit my pallet.  I actually made these on the skillet on a medium high heat with butter as my lubricant (I usually use olive oil but I couldn't find it) and I used a 1/2 cup to help me measure out the meat.  I rounded the meat off though so it made a little mound on top of the measuring cup (Does that make sense?).  I wish I would've taken pics but everyone was eating them so fast that by the time I was done with the final patty, that one was mine by default.  By the way, the people eating them were 13, 12, 10 and me and my hubby.  We all agreed that they were fantastic!!

After reading reviews, I decided to make "hot hamburgers" out of it instead.  I browned the patties in a pan then added enough water to cover and simmered for 20 mins or so.  I removed the meat and thickened the "browned" water with a little flour and made a gravy.  Simmering the meat in the water cooked out some of the salt and flavoured the gravy nicley.  Still a little too salty for my taste but family enoyed it.  Served with fries and a veggie.

I left out the 1/2 onion and the clove of garlic (thank God!)  These burgers should be called the "Most Onion-y Burgers Ever"!  I had to force my kids to eat every bite. My husband politely smiled and at his.  When I said sheepishly that I left out the additional onion and garlic - he said, "wow! really?"  We ate them 8 hours ago, and I am still burping the hamburger up!  Yuck!

No one in my family liked them. Had a really off-putting kind'a soury taste---soy sauce? Worcestershire sauce? Either one or some or all of the ingredients, (who knows what combination?) did not like to play well with other's.

The name is absolutely perfect! This was the tastiest, juicy, moist burger I've ever had! I used 1/4C. dried onion instead of fresh (didn't have one), and changed nothing else. I love garlic, but don't like too much onion and still thought it was perfect. Didn't think the onion was too strong at all, and loved the flavor combo of the herbs. I also never had a problem with them falling apart as some others mentioned. I used a George Foreman grill and had no problems. They may have tasted more like meatloaf than hamburgers, but that's because most hamburgers are too dull! My husband and I each had 2 and my grandmother had a whole one instead of maybe half as is usual. They are great! We will definately be having these again soon-Bravo!!

I'm sure these are 5 star if they are actually made on the grill, but I don't have one and broiled mine 9 minutes on each side. They came out so-so that way, but overall were tasty. I used red onion and sharp cheddar, and I didn't have any rosemary.

Far too salty and that was without the onion soup mix. For the amount of meat 1'2 an onion isn't nearly enough - double it!

We don't like dairy with meat very often so I have looked far and wide for a hamburger recipe where while eating it you are not wishing you had added the cheese.  

I did not use the onion because I was too lazy to cut up an onion but I substituted onion powder (about a tablespoon).  I was also too lazy to mince up garlic.  Long day.  

Everything else was there except I used some Simply Organic Steak seasoning (1 Tablespoon).  The stuff rocks.   

I also HATE those msg packets of dry soup mix and keep a stack or Simply Organic french onion soup mix (added the entire packet) in my pantry.  I swear I do not work for Simply Organic.  ; )

These were soooooooo good.  I must confess that I used ground chuck 80/20.  I really do not see why you would use a lean ground beef for a hamburger.  Ever.  Oh, and my ground chuck was 1.41 lbs.  

YUM!  Liked it so much I printed it out.  

Thank you for such a yummy recipe the cheese was not missed at all!  Yay!

Definitely not the best hamburger ever.  I was so disappointed when I took a bite only to be overwhelmed by the taste of garlic.  I didn't have a clove of garlic, so I only used the tablespoon of garlic powder and the garlic was extremely strong.  I can't imagine how strong it would have been if I used a clove of garlic!  Not only is the garlic too much, I found that the burger is way too salty.  Definitely not the best burger ever.

I have used this recipe so many times in the past year, and every time these burgers turn out fabulous. I live in France so everyone wants me to make my American burgers for them in the summers. This recipe is my go to, and I am now known for these burgers. Thanks for the great recipe! Definitely Best Hamburger Ever.

I've made this several times now. The title speaks for itself.
-I don't add any extra salt.  The soup mix has enough.  I don't find the hamburgers too salty.
-You will develop toxic garlic breath

I'm not the world's best cook, but I've had my share of hamburgers in my long life and I have to say these were THE best hamburgers I ever had! I used ground chuck and followed the directions as given. No extra salt was needed. They came off the grill plump & juicy with very little shrinkage! We all loved 'em!

Very Good, but strong flavour...next time i am going to cut the spices in half but still very yummy. We added a bit more onion and cheese :)

I was true to the recipe, no changes. Except for how you might grill your burger. De Sterno said it best in 2008, meat loaf, yup, you bet.

While I try new recipes all the time and usually I'm not disappointed, we didn't like this one at all.  There was a taste there we didn't like and it stayed with us all night.  It might have been the rosemary.  Will not be making these again.

Sorry but did not care for them.  I like a hamburger to taste like...well, a hamburger! Too many ingredients resulting in too many calories, high sodium content and fat. My own version is extra lean ground beef, a couple shakes of Worchester and a drop or two of liquid smoke and the flavor is awesome. Add onion and non-fat cheese on top and you have a great tasting burger!

I really wanted to like this recipe but it tasted like grilled meat loaf. I'll stick with a little salt and pepper and good beef.

Each time I make this it turns out so good that our neighbor has to come over to eat a burger (or two).  I don't add the garlic powder and rather just put in extra fresh garlic and I also use two 1 pound packages of ground beef for the same ingredients and it always turns out perfect.  I also like to toss in extra cheese but I don't measure it I just add more then they call for.  I have tried this recipe on numerous guests and have not to this day heard on complaint but only comments on how good the burger is.

Everyone at my BBQ raved about these hamburgers. I omitted the onion soup mix (did not have on hand) and replaced with dried onion powder and eliminated the cheese all together. Still a great flavor. Thanks.

I reduced the amount of all the herbs, but still kept all of them in the recipe.  I would agree with another reviewer that says that it tastes like a meatloaf or would be an awesome meatball recipe.  We like the taste of our meat.  With the changes I made, I will make again.  Thanks for the post.

Sooo good!  I took others advice and tweaked the recipe by only adding the pouch of onion soup mix and not the chopped onion and leaving out the rosemary.  Also I didn't have any worcestershire and I used cheddar cheese and it turned out awesome!!  For a little extra kick I added a splash of cayenne pepper sauce...YUMMY!  Great recipe.

These were delicious! I added half the onion soup mix. They seemed a bit wet so I added 1/2 pound more of ground chuck.  I refrigerated them until ready to grill and they were perfect. Definitely a burger I would make again!

I tried it the first time exactly the way the reciepe instructs. It was a bit salty for me so I cut the Worcestershire and soy sauce and just added a couple tablespoons of water to keep the moisture in. Sooooooo yummy!! I will never go back to plain ground beef  hamburgers again!! I've made a couple of variations of this reciepe like adding chopped up jalapeños and the reciepe seems to handle pretty much everything I throw in it!

My first review,I enjoyed this recipe very much. My patties were only 4oz so I dialed back the ingredient amounts and it worked fine. The burgers were juicy and full of flavor. I also divided the hamburger and put the cheese in the middle before cooking a la Juicy Lucy. I bet this recipe would work well for meatloaf as well.

I have never found a Burger recipe I like. Well....I ate two Burgers! My husband said they were delicious. We did think they were slightly salty, next time I won't add my own salt, maybe even omit the soy sauce or cheese. Not a big deal, I will be making these again!

This a really good base recipe. I tweaked it a bit. I left out the cheese, onion soup mix, and rosemary. Subbed in 1 tsp each of Allegro sauce, onion powder, and beef boullion. Cooked for 3.5 min on George Foreman grill, flipping after 2.5 min. They were amazing!!

Totally worth trying and packed full of flavour. I added 1/2 the dry onion soup mix (which was ample) and shredded cheddar cheese instad of the Colby or Monterey Jack. Still a fan of the beef only burger... but this is good when you're having company and are looking for something a little more fancy.

Great flavor!  Didnt use the onion soup mix or the cheeze, and glad I didnt.  I would probably skip using the garlic powder next time.  It was almost too much garlic.

This recipes yields tasty, tasty burgers.  We used 80/20 ground beef.  We didn't even need to add salt and pepper--it was plenty seasoned by all the other ingredients.  I might even omit the soy sauce next time.  To prevent hockey-puck burgers, make indentations in the center of the raw patties before grilling.

I had most of the ingredents, had to substitue the cheese for regular sharp cheese, didn't have the parsley or oregano, so i used italian seasonings, The were Awesome! My husband said that in his younger days he would have had 2 of them because they were so good. But we only ate 1 each. Plus he said these were good all by themselves, that they didn't need a bun or condiments at all. Will make these again!!

Meatloaf?  It tastes like meatloaf, you say?  Hardly surprising as it shares so many of the same ingredients as a good meatloaf.    I thought they were great.  Even the cooking time - five minutes on each side until they are well done - worked out for me as I used decidedly NOT lean beef.    No, I don't usually go for a well-done burger.  Even my wife, who doesn't like burgers at all and doesn't like her meat done well, loved these.    This one is a keeper at our house.

I love onion ON my burger but I think the onion soup mix was way too much for a burger, and I thought it was a little too salty as well. My husband would not eat them after his first bite.

This has way too much dried spice in it. It didn't even taste anything like hamburgers. This amount of spices would be fine to use in a pot roast but mixed into burgers it was not good at all. I still gave it 2 stars because the concept was good and I think if you left out the dried spices these would be very good burgers. I will try it again without the spices.

I had a little less than 1.5 lb meat, so I reduced the servings to 3.  I kept the fresh onion and rosemary out--didn't have time for them.  These tasted FANTASTIC!  Hubby didn't like the cheese in the burger.  He said it gave it a bit of a "soggy/smooshy" texture.

was very excited about trying this recipe.  Would recommend cutting back on herbs or you end up with a big flat meatball burger. Good and dense for a meatball not so good as a burger.

these were awesome burgers, supposedly i'm not allowed to make burgers any other way anymore. We actually made moose burgers, so we didn't add any onion, they tend to crumble with the onion, and we omitted the salt and pepper. thx for this one

The meat flavor was masked by all the seasonings. Maybe just a personal preference, but I want something to enhance the flavor, not overpower it. On the other hand, my picky husband liked it. Thanks for the recipe.

I added all the ingredients in the Kitchen Aide on stir and let it rip!!  I also doubled the recipe, added a roll of 50%less fat pork sausage and froze them.  The kids just grabbed them out of the freezer and popped them on the grill.

I took other reviewers advice and halved the herbs & onion soup, but these were still way too herby.  In fact, they had so much herb taste that I was afraid to put any condiments on for fear of making burger downright inedible.  I think that may be first burger I ever didn't finish.  No one else seemed crazy about them either.  Won't make again.

Really outstanding burgers!  They were juicy and flavorful.  My husband said they were the best burgers hes ever had.  Just make sure to use ground beef with at least 10 - 15% fat and be really careful not to overcook or you will end up with dry yucky hockey pucks.

The best burgers is correct!I dont care for onion soup mix so I just omit it. I do add some seasoning salt and celery seed. I use only fresh garlic! Try them they are fabulous! My picky husband loves them. He loves food that has alot of flavour and these have that for sure!

If this isn't the "ultimate hamburger" it's pretty close.   I followed the recipe exactly except for the rosemary, which I didn't have.   My college-aged son rated it 5 stars, and he does know his hamburgers!  Will defintely make again and again.

Finally a hamburger I love! I am very picky about hamburgers and this one is a keeper. I think I left out the rosemary because I didn't have time to grind and don't like the texture. Lots of wonderful flavor! Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my family tonight.  My 4 year old liked them and my husband said that it was great.  He told me to stop looking around for more hamburger recipes!

I've tried several different recipes for making hamburgers and this one is the best one yet! I wouldn't recomend adding salt because the onion soup mix has enough already. I didn't want to fire up the BBQ so I fried these in a non stick skillet. Really a good recipe!

Great recipe and yes, cooking on the grill is essential. Left out the onion soup mix and put in minced onion instead. Also left out rosemary because it’s a wacky ingredient for a burger. PRO TIP: make the burgers early in the day and let them hang out in the fridge before cooking for dinner. The flavors blend better!

Tasted like a meatloaf sandwich. Wasn't easy to grill. Fell apart easily.  Won't make this one again.

Good burger, but way tooo much sodium.  My son, 19, said it is the second worse burger he ever ate.

I made these burgers for a Memorial Day BBQ yesterday, and they were literally the BEST burgers I've ever had.  I forgot to include the chopped onlon, and  we added a slice of cheddar cheese on top.  So incredibly yummy!  I'll definitely be making them again!

I made a couple minor changes:  low sodium soy sauce, 1 tsp. garlic powder instead a Tbl, and I added no salt or pepper.  I formed the meat into 5 patties instead of 4, and cooked them on a griddle indoors (gas grill ran out of gas).  We did not find them to be too salty.  I tasted my burger before adding any condiments, lettuce, tomato, etc-- and it was SO good, I ended up just eating it on the bun all by itself, nothing else added.  Honestly-- I ate way too much, just because it tasted so good!  Yes sometimes you just want a plain meat hamburger.  But sometimes you want something a little "more".  And THIS is that "more".  Will definitely be making these again.

This isn't a great "hamburger" recipe. It is more like a salty meatloaf sandwich recipe.  Take my advice and leave out the dried onion soup mix. It doesn't do anything positive for this recipe. Onion soup mix is way too salty and this comment is coming from a Saltaholic!

Best burger ever the only changes I made was cut back on 1/2 of the soy sauce and replace it with steak sauce and I added a pinch of Cajun seasoning and I used red onions instead of yellow.

I've made this recipe twice now.  It is very good and I always have the ingredients on hand.  I don't feel the need for both the minced garlic and the garlic powder.  One or the other is enough.  I also do not add any salt as the soup mix is more than enough salt.  But it is now on my favorites list!!  Great recipe!

These were probably the best burgers I have ever made.  I didn't add any salt as people said it was too salty.  They were perfect!  I did use low sodium soy sauce. I also used dried mined onion because I didn't feel like chopping one.  We call this recipe a "keeper" in our house!!!

I'm  not much of a burger person, but this recipe definitely makes a tasty burger.  I've made this several times, and it's always a hit with my family.  I've had to make changes based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have dried rosemary, so I omitted that.  And I ran out of garlic powder after the first time I made it, so I substituted with garlic salt the next time (only a tsp) and omitted the salt called for later in the recipe.  Two days later I made this again and substituted onion powder for the garlic powder and did the rest the same I had done previously, and it was probably even better the second time around.  Very easy, and so much better than what you'd get at a fast food joint.  Recommended.

My family raved about these burgers! i skipped the egg and onion soup mix, and used blended fresh herbs instead of dried. Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe with Ground Venison. I left out the garlic powder and used another garlic clove. It turned out delicious!

Easily the best burger in the world!! We've nicknamed them "gourmet burgers" because of all the flavorful ingredients. They take a little time to make, but they are so worth it! They're always the first to go at our cookouts and everyone loves them. This recipe says it makes 4, but those are GIANT burgers... I can easily get 8-9 out of what the recipe calls for. Try these and you'll never go back to store-bought ever again!! They taste almost like meatloaf on a bun, but better!

Fantastic burgers!  I used blue cheese instead of the cheese called for, otherwise did everything as written.  I did not add salt to it as I thought that with the onion soup mix and the blue cheese, there would be plenty.
I will definitely make these again! 
Thanks for the recipe!

I don't normally write reviews, but I had to defend this burger. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. My family LOVED them. My husband raved about them throughout dinner. Even my two-year-old, picky eater devoured one.

All four of us loved this , even the pickiest one among us, and that's a miracle in this house. But I did simplify for the kids' tastes: I subtracted the onion (substituted tablespoon of onion powder), cheese and rosemary as well as the onion soup mix (didn't have any). And that was it! Even without those tasty ingredients, this was loved all around. Yay!

I tried this w/o the Lipton soup because I did not have any.  It was a great flavor, awesome burger.  I then read the reviews and was glad I did not.  Not salty since I did to my taste. It was not over spiced and would have if I had the soup mix.   I have been searching for a good recepie for years and I think this may be it.  No bread crumbs was a good decision .

I have  to admit this is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  There was so much flavor.  I only used 1/2 pound of ground sirloin and added the rest of the ingredients without measuring reducing to what I thought it should be.  Did them on the George Foreman.

I made this with 1lb of ground beef, so I did 2/3 of everything, except I did a whole egg. I didn't have the rosemary or onion soup mix, so I took those out. I think they turned out perfectly. I will be making them again tonight they turned out so well. I'll make them the exact same way too. I doubt I would ever add those two ingredients as people complained about it being too salty. Glad I did that!

This makes a very salty meatloaf! Leave out the soy sauce and onion soup mix and you will cut the salt back to an acceptable level. If you like the onion taste add a tablespoon of dry minced onion.  It was an okay burger. I love the garlic but you must cut the salt to make it edible for my family.

True to it's name, was the best burger pattie I ever had, don't usually have condiments or hamburger buns with my pattie so it needs to be very tasty. Didn't have the soup mix so added some onion powder instead. Great recipe!

Based on other reviews, I eased back on the spices by cutting the 5 spices at the end of the ingredient list out entirely.   The rest was done as written and I loved these burgers.

Well, for the first time in my cooking career I found out I was out of Worcestershire sauce.  how did that happen? Anyways, I made this recipe except I subbed a tsp of A-1 Steak sauce for the Worcestershire sauce. I also halved the onion soup mix packet b/c of the salt content.  I didn't have rosemary (this is getting embarrassing) so I used... a bit of tarragon (only b/c I was also cooking portabella sauteed in olive oil with tarragon, so the meals would blend).  Lastly, I sauteed the onions briefly before cooling & adding to the mix.  My kids--and I--agree these burgers came out incredible.  So tasty, and so moist.  No one at the table tasted Meatloaf... Don't know what to say there.  Great job to UNIVSTUDENT. no lousy bread crumbs! Really liked this!

I made this exactly the way is written except I used shredded Mozzarella cheese instead of Colby or Monterey Jack because that's what I had. There was too much of an overwhelming taste of the dried spices for me to enjoy. I will either omit them next time or use another recipe.

just tried this recipe - my husband and i really didn't like it - it was too salty (i think because of the onion soup mix) and needed a lot of ketchup to mask its flavor

These are very good. I end up changing a few things to suit my taste (fresh garlic, more or less of certain ingredients I like/dislike), but I think this is a solid base for a tasty burger!

This is the second time I made these burgers.  The first time made as written.  I did use reduced sodium soy sauce and made the onion soup mix recipe from this site.  The second time I left out the oregano and rosemary.  We like it much better without it. This make 6-7 nice sized burgers.

After reading the reviews, I used 2 teaspoons of Onion powder in place of the onion soup mix. I also used pepper jack cheese(all I had available). I used 2 pounds of ground beef so the recipe would serve 6. Pepper jack gave it a nice zing and w/o the soup mix, it wasn't overly salty(the extra meat probably toned it down).

My family did not like this burger at all.  We ate it, but will not be using this recipe again.  Too many flavors competing with each other, and the burgers were quite salty without adding additional salt beyond the soup mix, soy sauce, and cheese.

Really good recipe, if you're looking for plenty of flavor this is the burger for you. I didn't have any grated cheese so I topped the hamburger with sliced cheese after grilling and it was just fine. I will be using this recipe again.

Have used the recipe many times before, but never put in a review. Excellent! I omitted the onion soup because of the high sodium content, but followed the recipe other than that. Also, didn't have a grill handy, so did 5 minutes on each side in a skillet. YUM@! Thanks for  a tasty "upgrade" to regular burgers.

These were very good hamburgers!! I used an all-purpose seasoning blend that was salt free but kept everything else the same. I might have forgot the cheese inside the burgers but I did top it with a slice of colby-jack cheese.

Very good burger recipe....only thing I did differently was NOT ADD the Onion soup mix....I balanced the flavors by adding a chipotle seasoning mix of my own invention but using a store bought chipotle seasoning works just as well....I also smoked it with hickory wood chips on the grill....overall after my changes in the recipe....it was Bombtastic!

I eliminated the salt from the recipe, and I had no oregano so I used Italian seasoning instead.  I also used cheddar cheese.  Very flavourful burgers with a nice conistnecy.  It was hard to go back to eating bland store bought burgers after eating these.

Great burgers for the grill. I did however make a few changes. I left out the cheese, added ketchup and bread crumbs. I will definitely be making these again soon.

My husband and I really enjoyed this burger. We loved the complexity of the flavor it had...much more interesting than just your usual burger. We just topped ours with mayo, fresh ripe tomatoes, and a couple pickles. I felt that too many toppings would have detracted from the nice blend of flavors the patty had. This will be my go-to burger recipe from now on. Thanks!

Yes, this is a GOOD burger!  I found the burgers flavoursome and moist; very satisfying, indeed!  I altered the recipe t a bit (in deference to  the contents of my spice rack!) but the result was very, very delicious.  Thanks for this, I will be making this again!

Way too strongly flavored for my family.  While my husband liked it my girls and I did not.  I guess we would have been happier with the "tasteless bread crumbs" or just plain ground beef burgers topped with cheese. Sorry.:(

The burgers aren't bad but they do taste a lot like meatloaf with all the seasonings,  We didn't think they were too salty, just didn't care for the seasonings.  We like our burgers to taste like burgers.

Absolutely the best hamburger ever. My family was looking for more! I doubled the recipe but only used half the garlic powder. I may up the garlic next time. I put all the ingredients (except hambuger) in a food processor and then mixed it with the meat. It made it very easy to mix and shape the burgers. I will definitely be sharing this recipe and making more!

After reading the other comment I decided to cut all the spices in half.  Tasted really good.  But more like meatloaf like others stated then a hamburger.  if I was making a meatloafburger I give it five stars but since this is suppose to be a hamburger thats why it got a 3 star.

Delicious!  This is very similar to a recipe for "frikadellen" that my German Oma taught me to make when I was little (50 years ago).  These make great homemade meatballs, too.  Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS!!!  Quick, easy, juicy and just plain yummy!  The only thing I did differently was use teriyaki in place of the soy sauce.  (Somehow we'd run out of soy.)  It was the perfect combination of flavors.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!!!

This was absolutely great tasting!  I used cheddar cheese instead, omitted the onion soup mix, used fresh rosemary, and used low sodium soy sauce.  I served this on a whole wheat bun and topped them off with a bit of A1 sauce.  This was a really great tasting burger.  I did have a problem with them falling apart on the grill though when I turned them.  I only turn my burgers once when grilling.  After the turn they stuck together better.

I used 2# of ground chuck, and cooked in my George Foreman grill, instead of on the grill. I really didn't like these very much, too many flavors (the oregano was especially overpowering), my husband thought they were OK though. Served on bakery fresh buns with onion slices, tomato, lettuce and pickles. I'm glad I tried the recipe, but for me this is really not a keeper.

This is my all-time favorite hamburger recipe! I get so many compliments when I make these and we never have leftovers! I do add 1 tsp of Liquid Smoke for that delicious smoky flavor but besides that it doesn't need anything else.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

BEST EVER. My boyfriend could not stop raving about these.I replaced the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce with bbq sauce. I aslo mince fresh garlic instead of powder and used shredded mexi cheese for the cheese. I let the meat sit and marinate for an hour and then grilled. They had the best flavor of any burger I have ever made.

This was a decent mix of spices but WAY TOO MUCH compared to the amount of beef used. We could barely taste the beef, I would consider cutting all ingredients (excusing the beef) in half. Other then that, this is a recipe worth giving a try.

Very good burgers.  After reading reviews I decided to use 1/2 pack of onion soup mix and to skip the basil & oregeno.  Used all other ingredients as listed.  My husband kept telling me he couldn't wait to eat them because they smelled fabulous while he was grilling.  They did not disappoint us.  He woofed down two and told me not to lose this recipe.

Made these tonight and I must say I love the flavour and they stayed together well on the BBQ.  However I only added about 1 tsp of the onion soup mix as I think it has a tendency to be pretty strong and I didn't want to taste only that.  But as I made them they were very yummy and flavourful and will definitely make them again.

One of my guests loved this recipe, but I thought there was too much flavor, ended up tasting like meatloaf. I normally love flavor, but not when you can not taste the beef at all.

Well, maybe not the BEST Hamburger EVER, but a good start.  Adding the onion, and also the dry onion soup packet, left a real "oniony" taste in your mouth, instead of a "meaty" taste, will be sure to leave out one of the onion parts next time, though onion lovers will like this recipe as is!

Very good flavor, but we prefer this taste in a meatloaf rather than a burger.  It is very hearty and flavorful, but just not our favorite.  Thanks for the recipe, though!

These are ever so yummy!  I have made this about 4 times, each time they always turn out great!  And on the George Foreman grill, they are delicious.  I didn't use the parsley or rosemary or dried onion soup mix.  Instead I replaced the onion soup mix with some dried onions you buy at the market.  It tastes great without it.  All the other seasonings I put in.  Yummy!

We loved this! It has a lot of flavor. It had a lot of garlic flavor - my boyfriend loved it, but I thought it was just a little strong. We will definitely be trying this again!

I think this was, as the name says, "Best Hamburger Ever." I did read the other reviews and did not add salt and pepper, but I used all fresh herbs instead, except basil.  This was great!  Thank you!!!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe?!  It wasnt bad but I dont think it totally hit the spot for my family and I.  It think that everything took too much away from the burger itself.  Not bad but I probably will not make it again....too salty for us..

The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (I've never had the turkey and wanted to try it in a burger). I don't know if the turkey changed the taste significantly, since I've never tried this with just beef (nor have I ever tasted plain ground turkey). But I do know that the all the seasonings, specifically the herbs, came through too strongly and overpowered the burger. I will definately cut those at least in half, and probably cut the rosemary completely out. I suppose I did only use half a package of onion soup mix, leftover from another recipe, and I felt the onion flavor was spot on. My husband really liked this burger.

This recipe was great! I used 1/2 the onion soup mix, turkey instead of beef, and no cheese. It was by far the best turkey burger I've had. Thanks for the recipe!

I also only used half the herbs and cut out the garlic powder.  I cut out the salt, used half a pkg of lipton's soup and I GRATED the onion into a strainer and let the juices run out.  What a hit!

Very good and tasty.  I only  had cheddar cheese and melted it on top rather than in the burgers.  I also added about 2 tbsp. finely ground bread crumbs to hold the meat together. Kids loved them.

I've made this recipe 3 times now-each time with some little changes.  We've decided that we like them just as the recipe goes but without the Lipton's onion soup mix, adding double the garlic and 1 t salt.  The soup mix seemed to make them a little to dense/dry?  If you are grilling make sure to really chop the onion fine.  These are really fantastic hamburgers!  Thanks!

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I made this for my husband yesterday for father's day, and he loved it so much, he ate 2 of them.  My kids loved them too.  My older son ate 3, and my other son ate 2.  Usually, my family eats no more than 1 hamburger.  Excellent!!!!

Really great.  My only complaint is that they wanted to fall apart on the grill.  But, we managed to keep them from totally crumbling.  I would definately make again.  The whole family loved them.

Pretty good. Too much onion though. I wasn't too crazy about how much they plumped up either, but oh well. Tastewise they were good. Will make again.

This is a great hamburger, but watch out for the gas afterwards.

These burgers had a nice taste, but I would definitely leave out the onion soup mix next time.  It was VERY powerful along with including the chopped onion as well.

This was alright, but I didn't think it was all that great, certainly not best ever. I would definitely make some adjustments if I made it again, such as omitting the spices, they just didn't taste right.

There were too many "weird" flavors for a good burger.  The rosemary may be overkill.  HOWEVER, I think this recipe would make fantastic meatballs!

I left out the onion soup mix and the rosemary. I didn’t have either of those but I wouldn’t have added them anyway (too much salt...and rosemary?!? Ew).. They were super yummy. Added a pinch of salt and pepper, Colby jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, lemon tarragon mustard and a simple white bun.  De-lish!

My husband and I both agree that this is the best burger we have ever eaten. They were so very juicy and flavorful. We had an unexpected storm so I had to cook them on stove top.  I did make two small changes. After adding the fresh garlic I decided to leave out the garlic powder. I also used only half the package of onion soup mix as we are watching our salt intake. We will be making these again very soon. We also plan on having them the next time our kids visit.

How do I keep it from falling apart when I try flipping it on a open flame grill?

I agree.  Great  great taste.    Will have to work on the flip.

I strongly disagree about it tasting like meatloaf.   Never any doubt.   A great hamburger.

I don't have a grille, so this recipe is also good for the stove. I used half of the soup packet just because it seemed like a lot of powder, served with spicy aioli.

I'll take the "tasteless bread crumbs" if it means these burgers will stick together.  They fell apart at the turn.  Flavor is okay.  We'll use the crumbles in tacos or wraps or something.  Won't make it again.

I liked this take on a burger. I made as per recipe first time and found too much salt as Nick mentioned so I cut back to half a pack and it worked great. Only made one mod since to allow for a guest who was not a crazy garlic person like my wife and I. Just trimmed the powder and minced garlic back and found it was a hit for them as well. I think it's always in the chefs hands to tweak as required

I thought this hamburger recipe was very good with a few tweaks.  I noticed that some said it was too salty so I decided to forgo the onion soup mix altogether, plus it didn't hurt that I actually didn't have any! Lol..  instead of using onion I tried using a  finely chopped shallot and two teaspoons of onion powder. I also decided that the rosemary didn't have any business being in my burger sooo... none of that either.  I added just a little bit of salt and some pepper . Also, decided to put the burgers on brioche buns and boy were they good!  I thought they were super easy and delicious.

I agree with some others , its too salty. Half the ingredients with much less onion soup mix or bread crumbs is what I will try next time.

Used the garlic powder, but not the garlic.  Wife does not care for a lot of garlic.  The burger was great, everyone thought so.

Haven't made burgers for a long time.  I added the herbs but reduced each by half and it still added deliciousness. I used Havarti since I didn't have Colby Jack.  The soy sauce and Worcestershire added flavor too.

I didn't have any Worcestershire so I used A1 instead. I would not call this the best burger but it is pretty good. I think if I cut back on the rosemary  and  garlic it would be better.

I wouldn't say the "best" ever, but it is really really good. I don't know why people complained about the saltiness or the "meatloaf" taste. First, you control the salt...so if you dumped a bunch of salt in after adding all the ingredients, then this must be your first time cooking. AND if you think this tastes like meatloaf, you don't know how to make a meatloaf. Anyway, it is flavorful and grills up nicely (I don't think it would pan fry as well).

My family all felt that this tasted more like meat-loaf.  The onion soup gave it a weird flavor.  It didn't taste horrible though, but wasn't the tasty hamburger that we were wanting.

I omitted the onion soup mix because I didn't see that ingredient until the last minute and didn't have any on hand, so the burgers sort of fell apart on the grill.  I rescued them and ended up frying them instead and they turned out great, but for future reference, is there an alternative to the onion soup mix? I'm gluten free and need something else to make the burgers firmer.

Turned out great. This will be our go to burger recipe. But I omitted the onion soup and soy sauce.  All the other seasonings make up so much of the flavor, I don’t understand why anyone would use the extra salty ingredients.  Used a high quality ground beef.  Really a great tasting burger.

Really good flavours though I tweaked it to suit. Double onion, double egg, liberal seasonings, no onion soup, added breadcrumbs & parmesan instead of cheddar. The result was a delicious flavour indeed! 

Thank you!

This recipe seems a bit heavy on garlic, so I eliminated the minced garlic. I use pre-shredded tex-mex cheese. Both changes reduce prep time.

The added ingredients  increase the total weight from 24 oz to 32 oz, so I make six burgers, each about 5.3 oz. Big enough for us.

Something I notice is that the burgers do not puff up in the centre when cooking (I guess because of the added ingredients), so no need to depress the centre before cooking.

I cook the burgers on a 400F griddle, which results in browning the  whole surface. I smear each side with butter and sprinkle on salt before placing on the griddle.

It was very good I used two pounds of hamburger so I added just a bit of extra of everything. I might use a lot more shredded cheese next time though because my family are definitely cheese lovers.

My family was highly impressed and my husband has worked in too many restaurants to count. He gave it a 10!!! I did 4# of ground beef because we are a family of 6 and wanted leftovers. It made 13 super large burgers. I only did 1 oz pkg of onion soup mix, 1 1/2 c onion, 1 1/2 c grated cheese, serving spoon of fresh garlic, 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 1 T soy sauce and double of spices only. No SALT!!!!! I measured everything out precisely and it is perfect!!! We only added mayo,  lettuce, tomato and pickles. Did them in the skillet because it got late on me. ***UPDATE*** had leftovers the next day and my family including my husband said they want these hamburgers every time!!! We will grill them too!! They are awesome!!!!!!

I have made this recipe at least two dozen times, we love it! In fact, I’m making it today, Father’s Day!  
Only change I must make, not including the cheese within the patty, I am very allergic to cheese. My family’s advice it MAKE THESE!

I left out the French onion mix and halved the garlic powder with 1/2 garlic salt 1/2 garlic powder. These are delicious! Definitely the best hamburgers for reals. My go to from now on! Thank you.

I made it with 80% ground chuck.  Mind you I NEVER EVER BUY GROUND BEEF.... I make the BEST turkey burgers.  A friend suggested that I try ground chuck so with it being on sale, I did!  I made it MINUS all of the dry seasonings.  I used the onion soup mix, the Worcestershire sauce, the minced garlic and the egg.  I figured the soup mix would be plenty salt....it was YUMMY.   My son said that he thinks he likes these BETTER than the turkey burgers (even though he loves my turkey burgers).   Sooooooo....I’m going to buy a couple of more packages to put in the freezer.

Great. I forgot cheese, will use next time. Full of flavor. I always mix in crushed ice to meat, I think it helps keep burgers from getting dry. Still wonderful the day after. The onions still had a little crunch to then. Smoked at 240 till burgers hit 150.

A hamburger should taste like beef, with all of these ingredients this is closer to a meatloaf. It's not horrible, but it's not a real burger.

I doubled the recipe and it turned out very well, I added a slice of Pepper jack cheese to the top of them when done. 
 Going forward, I would recommend a little less oregano perhaps.

I still add breadcrumbs to this recipe because it helps make the burger moist, but this recipe is by far the best tasting combination of seasonings for hamburgers I have ever tasted. I press and freeze 5 lbs of burgers following this recipe (with breadcrumbs added) and it works fantastic. My husband says the burgers I make are better than any fast food burgers.

The only change I made was to sauté the raw onion, personal preferences, and only added about 1/2 packet of onion soup mix.
Don't think I'd add the extra salt next time.

Best hamburger recipe I've used so far.  I did not add any salt  and skipped the rosemary;  I broiled them in the oven rather than grilling outside.  Time to throw out all my other hamburger recipes.

I made this exactly as printed, but used 1.5 lbs ground beef and doubled everything else.  I didn't have the ground rosemary so I didn't include it.  This was very tasty!!  And even tasted better  after resting a few hours!!!

I made it without rosemary and put italian dressing dry packet in it instead of onion soup mix. Also, I did not put cheese in it but offered cheese as an option on top of the burger. It was a hit especially because I made the burgers 5.5 oz each so that I could get 3 burgers out of a pound. 

Another trick I do is to put the burgers right off the grill in a large tupperware container with a half inch of hot water and a dissolved beef boullion cube in it. When the burgers sit in the hot spicy water before you serve them, they are so juicy and aren't dry. I even rotate the burgers to the bottom of the container so they get some of the water soaked in them.

I LOVED the flavor.  I didn't think it was too salty like others said but maybe I will hold back a bit on onion soup mix next time. The biggest problem was keeping them together on the grill so I finished them on a pan.  I suspected that would happen so I added 1/4 to 1/3 cup of bread crumbs but it didn't' help too much. I think my onions were not cut up small enough and I also used fresh parsley and cilantro  which didn't help in keeping them together.  I do think it would be a good meatloaf as well, and that's  a good thing.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I needed a good burger recipe in a hurry, therefore I didn't have all the ingredients but the result was...DELICIOUS! 

Used about 1/2 cups of grated cheddar, Filipino Soy Sauce, 4tbsp grated Parmesan Cheese, 1/8tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4cp Sweet Red Onion, 1/4cp Bermuda Onion, 1tsp kosher salt, 1/2tsp sugar, 1/2tsp seasoned salt & two cloves of minced garlic. 

I omitted the onion soup, garlic powder, ground basil and rosemary. 

Mix and taste ingredients together before adding meat so you can adjust flavor according to your palate.  Cooked on BBQ (I like a little charring) added slice of cheddar, lettuce, tomato and condamints...it was very yummy. Also toast inside of buns on BBQ. Good luck.

This is a great departure from the traditional burger. No need for any other toppings or condiments - just lettuce and tomato. Two recommendations: 1) don't add extra salt before grilling as the onion soup mix adds plenty. Taste first before adding salt. 2) Make more than four patties - at least six, maybe eight.

No need to add the salt. The onion soup mix makes it plenty salty.  I also left out the chopped onions because of picky eaters, and still delicious!  My family LOVES these burgers.

I don't know if this is the best hamburger ever, but it's the best hamburger that I've ever made.  Of course like many, I did doctor it a little.  I think that 1 T of garlic powder is too much, so I just 1 teaspoon.  I also try not to add all the soup base of the onion soup since that's mostly salt anyway.

I made changes based on reviews... didn't use onion soup mix, but used onion powder instead.  Didn't use soy sauce.  Those two things would cut back the saltiness others complained about.  Oh also left out the rosemary.  Burgers turned out great!!  Nice and juicy, good flavor.  Nice to not use breadcrumbs.

After reviewing the ingredients, and reading some of the comments on saltiness from this blog, I thought they sounded like legit criticisms, so I cut the garlic powder and onion soup mix by 1/3, then I added a package of real crumbled bacon to the mixture, and these burgers came out amazingly for a Tailgate this weekend.  I was a little concerned that there was too much going on here, but nearly everyone I made these for raved about them well into the game from the Parking lot. Highly advise a slightly adjusted version of this recipe, but all the bones of an epic burger are here.

This was ok. It was a lot of ingredients and there was no real distinct flavor from any of them. I didn't think the taste was worth the work.

I made this recipe into a MEATLOAF.  I used all the same ingredients EXCEPT I used 1 lb ground turkey+1/2 lb of ground beef; 1/2 pkg of beefy-onion soup mix, I also added approx. 2 tsp. of Italian bread crumbs.  Absolutely delicious!  This meatloaf was a great hit with the family; possibly the best meatloaf I've ever made.

Very nice recipe. Juicy, tangy and leaves a nice taste in your mouth. Used regular ground beef and had temperature too high on BBQ. Ooops. Still came out good. You don't need to add much salt or pepper. Spices work well together.

Outstanding. Like a grilled slice of meatloaf, though I didn't get mine quite brown enough over gas. Use 80% ground beef for the fullest flavor. I don't have all the green herbs, so I used 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning in a 2 lb batch. What surprised us was that the flavor was subtle despite the  strong seasonings (I used double minced garlic) - nothing stands out. You can't even detect the soup mix. The shredded cheese also disappears, so cheese on top is good. Very savory. As to the complainers, yes, if you don't enjoy a juicy, flavorful meatloaf, this would not be for you. Everybody in the fam, from four to sixty-four, loved them. Even our very organic-mom daughter couldn't resist.

A good and out-of-the-ordinary taste for a hamburger.  Tastes more like meatloaf.  But a good alternative burger.

This recipe, except for the soy sauce, rosemary & oregano, and a lack of quick oats, is my favorite meatloaf recipe!!!  I don't know what I should rate, but, even though I eat meatloaf sandwiches, I never thought of grilling!  Actually, that's not quite true...I was running late once, & just decided to make into patties to facilitate a quicker finish!  I later progressed to muffin pans !!!  Good stuff though!  Blessings!!!

They're good but a bit overboard with the ingredients for my taste.  I'm one of those 'less is more' types, having all of the herbs mentioned growing in the backyard.  I crumbled the meat and add half a tablespoon of fresh basil, Italian parsley and a teaspoon of fresh oregano.  Choped a clove of garlic fine, fresh ground black pepper and a little salt, tossed it all in the crumbled meat and refrigerate for an hour or more.   Also had great success with just the meat formed into patties and placed on the grill immediately after adding wet hickory chips to the charcoal, closing the cover to smoke the burger.  Awesome.  I never use gas. I consider charcoal as the final ingredient to successful outdoor grilling.

This recipe is fantastic. But i followed what others said that it was too salty if followed the recipe exactly as it says. So I cut down on all the seasonings!!! Especially the dry onion soup mix. I like onion but i don't love onion!!! I believe that a burger is not a great burger, if the bun is not yummy. I love Sara Lee hearty and delicious hamburger buns. So i totally rev omen those to put the cherry on top! But overall im a huge burger fan so this is going in my recipe box!!! Absolutely in love!!!

I liked these, but they weren't all that spectacular. The ingredients sure did make it look like a meatloaf recipe. I made this exactly as written (for the cheese, I actually used a Colby/Jack blend). For the first burger, I thought 5 minutes on each side wasn't enough, so after that I made it 6 minutes, or even more. This was on a countertop grill - I'm not a pro at grilling, so I'm sure a better job could have been done with this. This all made for 4 pretty big burgers - not the best hamburger ever, but at least worth trying.

My kids, and their friends who were over for dinner said the hamburgers were delicious. I thought that it was a bit too Italian for me. I like something more savory.

This is very good - FULL of flavor!  I did not use ANY salt or pepper (enough salt in the onion soup mix!) and I did not add garlic powder - I figured the garlic clove would be enough (and it was, for us).  It is a little salty, but not overly so.  I also cut up a red bell pepper and mixed it in for some nice color.  I loved all the flavor!  I was worried that my husband, who tends to like his food on the blander side, would think think these are too "herby," but he thought these were really good too!  We will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe, UNIVSTUDENT!

Delicious!  We didn't have onion soup mix, so I left it out. The remaining spice mixture still tasted great.

We love this burger! I have never added the Lipton onion dry mix because I do not have it on hand and it does not need it! We have varied the type of cheese and it never diminishes the taste! Super yummy and my kids like them too! I love that this is easy and can be made with ingredients I already have in my kitchen!

This was a good burger.  I had to substitute a little beef base stock in place of the onion soup mix because I didn't have onion soup mix.  Overall the burger tasted great and next time I'm shopping I'll grab an onion mix.

I am a vegetarian, cooked this recipe for my boyfriend and his buddy, they loved it and asked what was in it. I left out the Rosemary and garlic glove (used garlic powder instead). They scarfed them down and did not use the cheese I bought to put on top, the colby that was blended with the meat and the fresh onion was    oozing out and delish!

We really liked the added taste of this recipe. It makes a hamburger great whether on a bun or as a meal itself. These are great as a leftover too.

This recipe was a hit for everybody! (10 kids and me) I did not have rosemary, garlic powder, or basil and I only had cheddar cheese. It still came out great. I also added some bacon bits. AMAZING! Next time I will be sure to have all ingredients on hand. Thanks for sharing!

I am not a fan of homemade hamburgers, and was suprised at how much I enjoyed these. They were quick and easy to make, and my brother said he liked them better than store bought! To keep them extra moist, I added approximately 1 cup of oatmeal. I did not add any salt, since garlic powder has plenty in it, and did not have any onion soup when I made it. Instead, I substitued with steak spice for extra flavour.

Wow!  I made these last night for dinner.  I only changed one thing....besides the cheese in the recipe, just before I pulled them off the grill, I added a slice of American cheese to each one....OMG!!!
The recipe definitely has the right title,  cause it was the best hamburger we have ever had.  I realize the recipes said to make 4 patties, but I ended up with 10.  That's OK, Just means we had more to eat.  EXCELLENT.

This burger was awesome.  My kids and spouse liked it.  I normally use ketchup, egg, breadcrumbs, etc. and it always tastes like meatloaf.  Which isn't a bad thing but I was ready for something different.  I did not use the Lipton soup mix as I just didn't have any, and instead of the individual parsley/basil/oregano/rosemanry, I just used a heaping tablespoon of Italian seasoning mix.  The burgers were delicious.

This recipe was fantastic - everyone in our family loved it.  We did, however, use 1.5 kg of lean ground beef instead of the called for amount of 1.5 pounds.  (We didn't notice our error until afterwards.) 

That being said, there is really no need to adjust the seasoning.  They were perfect, and we will definitely make them again.

I followed the recipe exactly except for not using rosemary and using cheddar cheese instead of colby (I didn't have any colby on hand.) These were good and, if you like a saltier hamburger or if you love meatloaf, I'm sure you'd rate this 5 stars. I only rated it 3 because, as I discovered when I made these, I prefer my hamburgers with just beef and the toppings on top. :) But if you want to experiment with something different in a hamburger, this would be the recipe to use!

these were okay. i didn't like the taste of all those dried herbs, so i would definitely recommend cutting back on the parsley, basil, oregano, and rosemary. And what was the point of fresh garlic AND garlic powder?

I found the use of the rosemary, oregano & thyme to be operpowering.  I tried it without these seasonings and the product was much better.  I also substituted extra sharp chedder cheese and added bacon bit.  Much better!

This hamburger really was one of the best i've ever had!  The only things I changed were I used 2 tsp of soy sauce because I had no worcestershire sauce.  I also had no dry onion soup mix or minced garlic, but the burger was amazing without them.  Fortunately I had all of the spices and it was perfect!

These were really good, but I could've left the cheese out.  There were so many flavors going on, the cheese kind of took second place.  Still, very yummy!

Entire family liked these as sliders... We used Hawaiian Rolls as buns.  I decided to use McCormick's Garlic & Herb (No Salt) seasoning since it incorporated all of the herbs in the recipe. (Highly suggest this spice mix on chicken and turkey as well!  Really good stuff!!)   Overall I think this was a very good recipe.  Will be making this again.

These were so moist, and had a really good flavor. I can't imagine them being any better, but next time I'll add the ingredients I didn't have at the time, which were rosemary, soy sauce and the chopped onion. Very, very good anyway.

Excellent-These were my only changes:  used 1 lb. Lean beef, did not use an entire envelope of the onion soup mix, and did not put any onion.  We're not big onion fans!  Everything else I left the same.  SO good!

I cut the herbs in half and the flavor was still very good.  I didn't put in the salt as suggested and wasn't too salty.

I followed this recipe exactly except I added a couple of tablespoons of ketchup, and I made the mixture into meatballs which I baked and then mixed with brown gravy and served with mashed potatoes.  The meat is very tasty, but I don't know if I'd like it as a hamburger, I'll have to try it and see.  But the flavors are very good.

It may not be the "best burger ever" but it certainly was good. The second time i made it, I didn't add the cheese into the recipe ( I put the cheese on top after the burgers were grilled) and added less of the spices, since they were a little overpowering.

I increased the ground beef to 2 pounds, omitted the onion soup and the minced garlic. I added just a smidge more worsteschire and soy sauce. All remaining ingredients were left as is. The burgers were the best we've ever had.

Wonderful. I used 2.5 lbs. of ground top sirloin and substituted feta for the cheddar.  Also, I did not add the chopped onion.

This recipe was awesome! My husband usually does the grilling and seasoning of the grilled items but he had to work late. So I looked up a recipe and this is the one I used. I already had all ingredients! My husband loved it! He called them PERFECT! Thanks!

I used 2 lb ground hamburger and mixed it in a mixer on medium speed. I omitted the onion soup mix and added 1 tablespoon onion powder.  I froze the patties until right before broiling. I would definitely make it for company

These were very good.  Even with the onion mixed in the kids really liked them.  They mix up quick.  We left the cheese out of the mix as my daughter can not have dairy, and they still mixed and held together well.

These were ok. My husband and I thought the burgers tasted too "herby". We added a slice of swiss cheese on top of the burgers and that helped to cover up the overwhelming taste.

I Made these for the Super Bowl.  I formed them into small burgers to use on rolls.  They were very tasty but had way too much of the onion soup mix flavor coming through.   I will only use half the soup mix the next time around.  Other than that they were very good burgers.  Can’t wait to try them on the gas grill.

I agree that this recipe tastes exactly like meatloaf. still ok tasting though. A few notes: 1) This is enough to make 6 to 8 patties. 2)I used about 3/4 the spices called for, and no salt at all and next time I would use only 1/4 the spices and no onion soup mix at all. You can't really taste the meat at all - it's all spice and onion and garlic. This is an ok recipe but I think I will keep looking for another one.

Can i just say that these burgers are so yummy and juicy that you can and should use EXTRA lean ground beef.  Every other recipe i used the xtra lean and they come out a bit like hockey pucks.  This is my all time favorite and will be making them bi weekly - and half the recipe as they were huge - good for the hubby but a bit too big for little old me!

Delicious! I agree with the last response-- I would make 6 burgers instead of 4. Also, I used 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix and that was good enough!

These were huge, next time I'll make these into 6 or 8 burgers. I omitted the rosemary, and the garlic powder, but used 3 teaspoons of minced garlic, and subbed the colby-jack with cheddar. These are going to be wonderful for summer barbeques.

I didn't find this especially salty, as others warned about. Overall, it made a pretty good burger.

Very tasty burger recipe!  

I used 2 1/2 pounds of hamburger but kept everything else the same and the burgers had lots of flavor.  

Other reviews mentioned that the herbs were overpowering.  I have a feeling that would be true if only using 1 1/2 pounds of hamburger.

These burgers were a hit with my family.  You need to really like the herbs used as their flavors are quite noticable. Quite juicy and flavorful!

I'm not the best cook, but the recipe was easy for me to follow.  Even when I was too lazy to go back on the computer and print the recipe, I could swing my way through with the ingredients and they still were "da bomb!"

This was pretty good.  I made these for the 4th of july.  They were pretty tasty even after my husband burnt them. I'm not usre if I'll make again.  A little too "herby" for my tastes and i'm not sure i would serve them for guests as they did taste a little like meatloaf.  I'm not complaining though, we love meatloaf.

I thought the burgers were delicious.  I omitted the cheese and I used only a half packet of the onion soup mix (because it has SO much salt).  I also didn't add the additional salt the recipe calls for (only the pepper).  The burgers came out great and I will definitely make again!!  My husband loved them too.

I didn't have basil or rosemary and didn't use the soup mix.  I used Poultry seasoning instead (it's all I had).  Still, company thought it was great.

This really is the best hamburger ever.I was getting tired of my old hamburger recipe so I decided to give this a try.It is excellent on the BBQ.I made a couple of changes just for my own preferences.I omitted both the chopped onion and the garlic powder.The soup mix was enough onion taste for me and the minced garlic was enough without the powder too.I also omitted the salt.
But this burger was very moist and not dry at all,delicious!!

These were ok but I don't think we'll be making them again.  I think with so many ingredients we lost the burger flavor, they also came out a little on  on the dry side.  But I do think that anyone who shows an interest should try them because our preference may not be yours.  Great to have allrecipes around.  Thanks for the post.

I always used to just make hamburgers out of plain beef, adding nothing to it...I tried these and they're great! Just used cheddar cheese as I didn't have the other kinds! Will never make plain burgers again! I BBQ'ed them last night in the snow!

I used this recipe to make turkey burgers due to the fact that they tend to be a bit dry and don't carry a lot of flavor on their own. We enjoyed these burgers very much, but hubby cringes when he sees all kinds of fussy ingredients added to beef burgers. Good ground sirloin is flavorful enough on its own and these ingredients would only mask the beefs natural goodness. Thanks so much for helping to make our turkey burgers really delicious!

It's true that this hamburger has a very strong herby taste to it, but it's delicious!  I do agree that is more like grilled meatloaf, but I enjoyed that--it wasn't the typical hamburger and it was delicious!

This letter is a real keeper.  I ended up using all the listed spices but halved.  I also did not add the onion soup.  I did add a minced hot pepper and used horseradish cheese.  My boys and husband couldn't get enough.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

A very good recipe.  These hamburgers aren't your average burger b/c they're jam packed. They remind me of a meatball (switch the cheese to parmesan - there you have it!)  I don't care for onion soup mix so I left it out. Will have again!

Great recipe!  I love all the spices and flavors blending together.  The first time I made it, though, my husband thought it had too many flavors in one burger.  So the second time I made it, I halved the onion soup mix, spices, and garlic powder.  It turned out great!

With all of the listed ingredients this becomes too much like grilled meatloaf.  Not bad, but not hamburgers.

Our family has pared this down by removing the egg, rosemary, and oregano.

This recipe lives up to it's name!! I made 5 burgers NOT 4.I may never make regular hamburgers again. I did leave out the chopped onion in fear it would make the burger fall apart, I used a teaspoon not tablespoon of garlic powder (too much garlic powder when you put it with a garlic clove too) and I cut the rosemary spice in half. I will make these same changes next time. EXCELLENT - the burgers were great looking.

There were good hamburgers.  Because some of the reviews noted that they were rather onion-y, I used less onion soup mix than is called for, and they were still pretty onion-y, although we did not have any left over.

Enjoyed the taste and texture of the burger.  The added egg makes grilling easy, but I would reduce the amount of garlic powder to 2 teaspoons.  Combined with the garlic clove it was a bit much.
