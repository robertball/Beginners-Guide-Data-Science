Very good! Only differences I did was use a can of evaporated fat free milk (gives sauces a faux cream flavor) and about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. Defintely one I will make again.

We really enjoyed this sauce.  I used apple juice for the white wine as I didn't have any at the time.  It turned out great!  Thanks, Betty.

Great recipe!  My one very small variation was that I added an extra can (10 oz) of whole baby clams without the juice.  Highly recommend this one.  It is simple, inexpensive, and delicious!

Wonderful!  This was my first time to make clam sauce, and it was so good!  I cut down on the fat by using only 2 Tbl. olive oil, and skim milk. I read other reviews and decided to cut way down on the clam juice (I used 3 Tbl.), then added 1/2 cup of wine.  Very quick and easy recipe.  Serve with a side of steamed broccoli and crusty bread.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is easy to prepare, delicious and the ratio of linguine/sauce is perfect!  

The sauce is better if made the day before or frozen in jars then used over pasta as the flavors will have a chance to blend.  

Thank you Betty, my boyfriend thinks I can cook, little does he know I just know how to follow directions.  ;)

My husband fixed this, made a few slight modifications and it was the best dinner.  He used a 28 oz can of whole clams.  Put the reserved juice  in a pan and reduced it slightly while sauting the garlic and onions to give it even more clam flavor. Used fat free half and half instead of milk and dry sherry instead of white wine.  Added 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  Left out the parsley, since I didn't ahave any and this didn't need the additional salt and pepper. I didn't have enough regular linguini so added some multi-grain that I had bought.   It was really good.  Topped it with a sprinkle of parmesan.  This is going in our regular dinner rotation as it's so easy to make.

Great recipe, very easy to make and quick too.  I modify it a little by adding about 4 tbsp more white wine and then about a 1/2 cup of a light sweet juice just to cut a heavy taste if you don't want it to be too creamy.  To make it chunkier, I added a jar of mushrooms and more clams.  Also, I tried substituting evaporated milk light another user suggested and it was even better.

This was really different from how I'm used to making this dish, but we all enjoyed it very much. I used fat free half and half and in addition to the fresh garlic, I also added garlic and onion powders and a sprinkling of fresh chopped parsley. Also added more wine than suggested. Lovely recipe Betty and thanks!

Really good recipe, but I recommend using less clam juice and more wine  so it doesn't have such an overpowering  fishy taste.

This recipe is excellent!! Only changes I made were to use 1 tbsp. dried parsley since I had no fresh, 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes (we like spicy!) and since we are clam lovers, added 2 cans of baby clams along with the two cans of minced clams.  For my family, this recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is defintely a keeper.  The reason I have not given it five stars, is because the basic ingredients are some what bland, but they do make a great starting point.  However, it is so easy to tweak to your liking with a little bit of spice(old bay, chili powder, pepper flakes, etc...) and some extra clams.  Personally I like it with milk, but if you want a creamier sauce use half & half. This recipe will please all ages.  Don't forget to serve with garlic bread to soak up the wonderful sauce. Thank You Betty.

if there were 6 stars I'd give this dish them all! i've made this dozens of times for my family and the inlaws LOTS OF RAVES from ALL...including the kids. Yes i do tell them its chicken. I consistently swap out the milk for a can of skim evaporated...makes it a little sweet and extra creamy tasting

I love linguini with white clam sauce. Just not this one! I thought it was terrible. This sauce had no flavor at all. I will be looking for another recipe for sure! Sorry.

I love this recipe.  I never knew it was so easy to make such a delicious meal.  This one is requested by my family at least once a month, and never fails to please them.
I usually saute up some onions, mushrooms and shrimp to throw on top of the noodles, then sprinkle a little asiago cheese on top and melt it.  It doesn't get any better than that!

Was a great start, but I found it extremely bland! will warm up fresh cut herbs in the olive oil before everything else to infuse some flavor next time. I want this recipes to work so bad, because the technique is absolutely flawless! it came out looking and smelling restaurant quality, just lacked flavor!

Very tasty.  I have made this many times, but this time I had some fresh clam meat, but did not have the clam juice since it was fresh meat.   I have a toddler and a pre-schooler, so I decided to add about 6 oz of apple juice instead of the clam juice plus 2 tbsp apple juice instead of the wine.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, (about 2.5 tbsp) to make it healthier.   Lastly, I used 1 cup of 2% milk and 1/2 cup of skim milk and a non-stick pan to avoid having to use all of the oil.   Very tasty and made low fat.   A huge hit with our whole family.

I served this and got excellent reviews. The only change I made was to add Asiago grated cheese at the table and added another 10 oz can of whole baby clams without the juice, as another reviewed suggested and I found to be an excellent suggestion. This recipe is a keeper for me.

I like this recipe because it is quick and impressive to throw together for company as long as you have all the ingredients prepped and ready to go.  I am giving it 4 stars because I did have to tweak it to give it a little more flavor as it was a little bland for our taste.  I added freshly squeezed lemon juice and a little more wine.  I also doubled the garlic and added cherry stone clams that I steamed in wine in addition to the canned clams.  I think next time I will also add some hot pepper flakes.  I love the fact that this recipe doesn't use butter.  However, it definitely needs a little more seasoning to make up for it.  I will continue using this recipe as a guide.

I thought this was excellent! I did add some crushed red pepper flakes and I think it would be better with 1 more can of clams. But my husband and son both thought it was good, so I will be making this again.

I thought this recipe was very good, but it needed something...a little "umph" or more flavor...maybe a little more black pepper or maybe next time I'll add in a bit of red peppar flakes...but over all, we really enjoyed it.  I used 3 cans of clams and juice and used 1/2 milk, 1/2 cream to give it a little more creaminess.  But it was yummy and hubby enjoyed it also.  I'll make again.

This is one of my favorite recipes, it's so easy to make and tastes wonderful!  I add a couple of dashes of white pepper and a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper flakes...and it's even better the next day!

This is probably the best White Clam Sauce recipe I ever made. Followed the recipe as indicated, just added paprika for color and a pinch of cayenne pepper to kick it up a bit. Excellent! Thanks for sharing this one...Will only use this for clam sauce...

My family absolutely loves this sauce.  The first time I made it, I made it exactly as the directions said.  Everyone was happy.  After making it a couple of times, I decided to add more clams, garlic and used heavy cream instead of milk.......luscious.  I cannot understand why people need more seasonings in clam sauce. The clams are supposed shine through and this recipe does just that.  Thank you very much!

Like other people said, this clam sauce was very creamy. I doubled the garlic and added a half cup of parsley. It came out great.

Sorry to say but I did not like this recipe at all. Had no taste to it was very bland. My husband eats anything I put in front of him and likes/loves it but he told me never to make this again. Wish I liked it cause it seemed to have great reviews but unfortunately I didn't.

This sauce is so tasty, you would never guess it is so fast and easy to make.  I added 3TBS more wine and subbed half n half for the milk.  I also added some fresh basil right before serving.

Made for the in-laws. Was good, needed a little extra zing but still a big hit. I added an extra can of whole baby clams, used extra garlic, added mushrooms, used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, topped with parsley and parm chesse.

This was sooo good!  I used chicken stock in place of the white wine and doubled the salt.  I also put in a dash of italian seasoning and a dash of old bay.  My 2 year old ate two plates!  Served with salad.  Delicious!

One of my favorite meals when I don't have time to grocery shop- I keep all of the ingredients on hand.  I like a little extra garlic and white wine, which then means you need a little extra flour.

I love this recipe as a base - it is bland, but there are many possiblities for spicing it up - I used a bit of red pepper, seasoned salt and fresh spices - wish I had some Old Bay on hand - which should be a requirement as I'm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland - I'm going to give that a try next time.  Definitely a keeper!

This was not a bad recipe at all. I added 2 times the flour and 1/2 cup of wine. This thickened it a little more and the wine gave it a nice finish. Also I used more garlic adn added basil, oregano, and a little chili pepper to give it some kick. Great dinner, thanks for the recipe.

I am glad I decided to make this delicious dish! Only change  I made was adding a 1/2 c of white wine in place of the clam juice as I didn’t have it, also added old bay seasoning as I always do when making a sea food dish, tad more salt n pepper to suit our liking, it was certainly a hit with my husband and I. I suggest you do not Skimp on the Butter n Olive Oil as Written in the recipe as it was  perfect amount of sauce per pasta. I will definitely be making this amazing pasta dish again very easy to make and tasty Indeed’

I loved this recipe.  so nice and creamy.  The white wine in it was perfect.  I did add a little butter,  about 2 Tbl. just because I like butter. And a can of mushrooms, for the same reason. Other than that, perfect the way it is.  thank you!

Easy, creamy recipe. I did add a heavy hand of parmesan at serving. Based on other reviews, I also went heavy on the garlic and added a little seasoned salt.

OMG LOVED LOVED LOVED. I did make a few changes based on what I already had. I used one 6.5 car of minced clams and one 10iz of whole clams. I only used 2T EVOO, I used 3/4 cup 2% milk and 3/4 cup chicken broth. Since I used broth I didn't add any salt I did add red pepper flake. I didn't have any wine but I have a clam chowder recipe that uses red wine vinegar so I used 2T of that in place of the wine. The last thing I did was I used basil from the tube instead of parsley. I just squeezed until it looked like a good amount to me. I was going for a lighter version because I love clams and pasta so I'm going to serve this over spaghetti squash for me and regular spaghetti for the family. I think my modifications met my goal of not feeling guilty for indulging. This sauce is still creamy and so good I could eat it as chowder!!!! In fact Serve it in a bowl and you can have pasta and chowder at the end!!! Don't forget the crusty bread! Except for me :-( LOL

A little bland so if you have some tricks up your sleeve, use them. Easy to make, creamy consistency.

Fantastic! Delicious! Easy! The only thing I did different was I used unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk.

I used this recipe as my basic model for my FIRST try *ever* at Linguine With Clam Sauce. I am a big white sauce fan and I'm gratified to see it used here.

As usual, I found a way to add my own "spin" on the recipe BUT, for once, I did NOT use one of my FAVORITE ingredients, Pork Jowl Bacon, because I wanted to make this recipe honestly, to see if I COULD get along WITHOUT the bacon-and I did!

 

I am not afraid of REAL *anything* be it butter, milk, cream etc. If you want full on flavor, full on ingredients are a *must*.

But, too, I think I may have discovered an indispensable herb, which is not known for being used in clam sauce. I'm not giving it up here but I did use Dill Weed ( I've always associated Dill Weed with seafood) in my recipe for clam sauce in conjunction with my "mystery herb" and this combination may well be responsible for NOT having to use ANY parmesan cheese as a "helper" at all! When I finished my sauce and had myself a plate, I was surprised that I had not even MISSED the parmesan!

I mean, I use parmesan on EVERYTHING Italian- but , because of that mystery herb, I believe I found a "richer way"!

Thanks for the great "base recipe"!

Easy, but not the same as a white sauce with cream.  I didn't like it, but my fiance did.

Last night I made the Best linguini & clams I ever made In My Life.  This recipe is the Best.  

I made these changes:  

1.  I increased the parsley to one cup and added it with the clams when tossing the pasta & sauce.   

2.  I added a medium sweet onion with the garlic.

3.  I increased the garlic salt to ??

4.  I did not add cayenne.
