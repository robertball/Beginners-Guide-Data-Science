Great recipe for holiday gift tins or get togethers.  I used 2 cup corn Chex, 1 cup rice Chex, and 1 cup cinnamon rice Chex rather than just corn Chex.  I used mixed nuts rather than just peanuts.  I omitted the pumpkin seeds thanks to a previous review.   And I threw in a handful of gluten-free pretzels to give it the authentic Chex mix flavor.  Given the nuts (and pretzels) I recommend not adding any additional salt.  It took longer to bake than stated, but it needs to be stirred occasionally so you will be able to judge when it is done.

This was not a hit.  The pumpkin seeds were a definite miss.

I took it to our Christmas party.  The bowl was empty at the end of the evening. I would say it  wass a big hit.
