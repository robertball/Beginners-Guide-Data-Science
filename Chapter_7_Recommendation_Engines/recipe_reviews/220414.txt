Awesome recipe idea! I like another person used canned RoTel and I added minced garlic and onions while the meat cooked. I then topped it with sour cream when I served it!

This was really good! Based on all the reviews, I  took a little from everyone. (thanks to all the good cooks who took the time to write a review)
I used ground turkey, added chopped onion,garlic and serrano pepper to meat while it was cooking. I used Taco seasoning, oregano, Rotel diced tomato's and green chilies and a can of black beans rinsed and drained.   It was great!

All things considered, this is a simple but tasty recipe that I keep changing to find new combinations of ingredients. I think the cornbread on the top and bottom is a bit much for me but my son likes it this way. I have moved to putting the cornbread mixture on the top only making for less cornbread and more ingredients. The poblano peppers help make this dish different. This has become a regular in our meal rotation due to its simplicity.

Yep! It's a keeper! 
There are only two of us, so I cut the recipe in half, and baked in an 8 x 8 brownie pan. I was careful to keep the layers separate, so it looked as gorgeous as shown in Chef John's video (see photos: it was submitted by "Denise"-thanks)! I came close, but the Jiffy mix fools you: wet it looks like a thin layer, but cooked it puffs a LOT,  so it blends heartily with the meat layer. I still had a good layering going on when served, and it tasted delicious. Easy, worth-it recipe. Even great the next day.

this is a great place to start!  i used less ground beef, added a drained can of black beans, and used rotel instead of salsa and in place of the peppers i just used 1 green pepper. i pretty much doubled the cheese in both places.  it was FANTASTIC.  i'm going to divide it up and freeze it in single sized portions so i can enjoy this for a while! next time i'm going to use lentils instead of ground beef for a meat free meal.  to penny pinch you could leave the bottom layer of cornbread out and just make the top portion and it'd be just as good, but i like the extra layer in there.

Ok, took me awhile to find this recipe because I only saw the video once prior to making it lol. Thusly I did change a few things, relatively minor. First, we have no Jiffy cornmeal mix up here so I made a double cornbread recipe and split it. No Poblano's either so I chopped up a red and a green bell pepper. I didn't thaw my corn.  The spice amounts I guessed at and while I was a little light on the salt, it was fine. I subbed in just a very little bit of red pepper flakes instead of the chipotle powder because we like just a wee bit of heat. I upped it a bit more by using a pre-mixed bag of shredded cheddar, jack and colby cheese with hanbanero and jalapeno peppers. I used maybe a 1/2 cup of cheese. The end result was and is wonderfully edible. A dish that will go in the rotation!

Great starting place.  Easy to customize.  I gave it four stars because it calls for corn muffin mix.  I made my family corn bread (1 C flour, 2/3 C corn meal, 1/3 C sugar, 4 t. baking powder, 1 C milk, 2 eggs) and subbed 1 can Rotel tomatoes and 1 can enchilada sauce for the salsa because I didn't have enough salsa on hand.  I also left out the poblano peppers (didn't have any).  It turned out really great.  I baked for 40 minutes at 400 since that was what my corn bread recipe called for. It was perfect.

OMG!  I love this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  My 6 year old loved it also and she is a picky eater.  My only thing I would change next time is use more cornbread, only because I'm a cornbread fiend.  I'll also try next time using taco seasoning for the meat and see how that goes.  Glad I found this one.  Thanks

Great recipe. My family really liked it. I used 4 large poblano peppers, which was just under a pound total. I only cooked it 50 minutes, and I could have probably taken it out of the oven after about 40 minutes, because it seemed slightly dry. Other than that, great recipe. Thanks, Chef John...another winner!

I only made one alteration to this recipe. I baked the bottom layer of cornbread for 10 minutes before layering on the veggies and meat with sauce. The bottom was less soggy this way. I also used one recipe of Quaker Yellow Corn Meal, which worked for an 8x8 dish.

We didn't really enjoy this one. Was fun to try it and was very quick and easy to make.The poblano's didn't have much flavor.  Reading over this, I bought cornbread mix...is that different than corn muffin mix?  It wasn't a hit with the meat mixture.  Only two out of 6 enjoyed it and had seconds.  I threw some ghost pepper salsa on it to spice it up which was good.  We should have used more cheese too.

Very simple to make and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a bit of honey to my cornbread mixture.  Make sure to use the correct size of pan, otherwise it takes forever to cook all the way through.

My fiance told me to give this recipe five stars once I told him the scale only went from 1 to 5. This was easy to make, and we made it together. We don't eat spicy food due to IBS, so we just used green bell pepper and mild salsa. Turned out beautifully and gives us plenty of leftovers for the week!

I have enjoyed this recipe as written, but I had some italian sausage on hand and I decided to switch this up with an Itaian flare. I followed the recipe using a 19 oz. package of Johnsonville sweet italian sausage. Subbed Spaghetti sauce for salsa, basil and red pepper flakes for the chipotle, mozarella & parmesan for the cheddar, olives for the corn. Served with a dollop of marscapone cheese for yummy results. Try this rendition....it works!

Wonderful dish! I was tasked with cooking dinner for the family (17 year old) and was looking online for some simple yet tasty dishes, and found this! My family loves Mexican and Western oriented food, so this was a blast. Like many others, I used 1 1/2 cans of original spicy rotel tomatoes along with green pepper and about a cup of chopped onion and garlic. I substituted the chipotle powder with a pinch less of red pepper powder. I sauteed the peppers and onions in olive oil while the meat was cooking, and it gave it a nicer mixed taste in my opinion. Great easy meal. Hey, I've never made a full dinner like this before, so anyone could do it!

I've made this several times and my family loves it. The way we like it best is easier than the original recipe. I cook the ground beef as directed and use a 24oz jar of Pace medium picante sauce with the rest of the ingredients as listed. I add the corn to this mixture and pour it into the dish. Then I top it with the cheese, and then the two boxes of corn muffin mixture on top. Baking time is the same.

I will try this tonight...Although it's not listed...I think I'll drain the beef mixture before adding the salsa sauce.

Cooked it and it was great!!! My wife didn't let me drain the meat since it didn't say drain. Overall this dish will be added to our lineup.

This recipe is very forgiving & flexible.  I live overseas & could not get many of the ingredients for the meat mixture, but it was still very good.  I made this in a bread loaf pan & used only about 0.5 lbs meat & one recipe of corn bread divided into two.  Here's what I did based on local ingredients: Sauteed lean ground beef with onion, garlic & green pepper.  Added taco seasoning (hot) from the US.  Added half can of sweet corn to meat.  Made corn bread from scratch, adding rest of corn to the top crust.  I had a mild local cheese that I sprinkled on top of meat before adding top crust, but we couldn't taste it, so I may not add the calories next time.  Served with natural yogurt in place of sour cream (very good addition).  Yes, that's a lot of substitutions, but it was what I could find & it was still worth the effort.  A loaf pan served two adults & three kiddos 6,8, & 13.  Thanks, Chef John!

My BFF tried it with the black beans and rotel. OMG! It was the best simple dish that was so flavorful and tasty that I wanted to wrap up in it and fall asleep. That how comforting I found this dish. I'm making it tonight. So good, it makes you want to slap your Momma. :-)
Has anyone tried it with ground turkey?

Great recipe!  Brought this to a Cinco de Mayo party where others were already bringing the basic Mexican apps...wanted something different. Delicious & hearty, but I think the cornbread took over!  Will make again, but with less of the cornbread mixture on both layers, so the meat is the main ingredient.  I love cilantro, so I'd add some to the meat mixture too.

I too made some subs. I do not eat meat, so I used kidney beans (can't find black beans in the UK) I used green chillies (that my kids sent me from the US.) I made home made corn bread (don't have jiffy), lol. I left out the corn as I don't care for corn and it still came out great.

Johnsonville Sausage challenged some of us to do a makeover of a recipe substituting Italian Sausage for one of the ingredients.  I selected this recipe, and subbed Hot Italian Sausage for half of the ground beef which really elevated the flavor.  That hot sausage combined with the poblanos was a winning combination!

Excellent easy meal. I love how versatile it is. I would suggest to make sure you drain the grease from the meat before adding all your seasonings - The corn bread will soak it all up if you don't.

Followed recipe as written without making any changes and it came out perfectly. family and friends enjoyed it and i'm sure they will ask for it again. Next time i may add some jalapenos in place of some of the poblano pepper for a little bit of kick.

I've been a member of Allrecipes for many years but have never written a review.

I have to say that this dish was a HUGE hit with my family!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used 8 oz of a Mexican blend cheese because I couldn't find shredded Monterey Jack.  The recipe is very easy and tastes wonderful!  I served it with refried beans and chips and salsa.

Even my son-in-law, who's half Mexican, told me it was awesome.  He said he doesn't usually like Tex-Mex food, but loved this.  Thanks Chef John!

My whole family put this in their top five rotation dinners. Changes I made: cornbread from scratch, homemade taco seasoning instead of chipotle powder and salt...just because I didn't have it. Also omitted poblano for the same reason. Super yummo!!

My wife and I enjoyed this recipe. I used more cheese than the recipe called for, and instead of using dried chipotle pepper, I used a can of whole chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. I think that this definitely helped to bring out more flavor.

I thought this recipe was very tasty! I also added chopped onions, poblanos, the spices the recipe called for, in addition to cumin and 1 package of taco seasoning while the meat was cooking. I added cheese to both cornbread mixes and used 12 ounces of sweet corn. The spices and poblanos lend spice, while the corn and cornbread give sweetness. Next time, I will add a can of rotel because I love tomatoes and this recipe would be perfect with them. I did not think this recipe was spicey, so if you like hot, double the amount of chipotle powder and add a jalapeno.

My whole family loved it! I substituted two 7 oz cans of Market Pantry Mild Diced Green Chiles, drained for the poblano peppers, as my wife does not care for them. I also substituted the ground dried chipotle peppers for Victoria Taylor's Smoky Paprika Chipotle Seasoning. And lastly, I used Italian Seasoning instead of oregano. I recommend reducing salsa from 16 oz to 12 oz so that the meat mixture isn't watery, which I learned the hard way. This was a huge success and fed the family for several meals.

As one of the reviews, I think a small can od pinto beans would be great, I am not to fond of blk. beans. Thank you Chef John, I love the combination of the spicy meat, and cornbread, and my husband loves Jiffy, it has a slight sweet taste.:-) Thanks again...

Instead of 2 lbs ground beef I use 1 lb ground beef and 1lb spicy sausage, add pre sliced pepperoni and mild rotel. Don't forget the chopped onions.  Cornbread on top only. We love it this way. Been making it this way for 37 years everyone loves it.

I am always looking for new recipes to add to our rotation and this one fits the bill perfectly. My own rule of thumb is to follow the recipe exactly the first time, then any subsequent times I "make it my own". I definitely added more spice as we like heat and some kick. One thing I want to point out, this actually tastes better the next day. (like chili or sauces often do, this was even more delicious the next day so I intentionally made it in advance this last time. Wasn't mushy or anything as I had thought it may be.) Delicious base recipe.

I made some changes, but the basis of this recipe is a great idea,so 4 stars! First, I used homemade cornbread batter. It doesn't get as dry as the boxed stuff. Second, I added a can of black beans and some taco seasoning (instead of the spices) to my meat mixture. 
I've made it with a few other changes as well (no cheese, extra veg, etc) but the above changes were the ones we liked best. This recipe is one of those that you can adapt to what you have in your cupboards and fridge that day. I know it's a keeper when I actually print the recipe for my book, and with this one I did just that! Thanks for sharing :)

I found this to be a good meal for a change. Nothing I would rush to make again, however my son loved it. I used hot & sweet peppers from my garden instead of the poblanos and I decreased the chipotle pepper to 1/4 tsp. because I knew it would be too hot for my family. It was perfect and still had a kick. I also googled homemade Jiffy corn bread mix and used that instead of the box mix and I subbed the white sugar in the recipe for maple syrup (always looking for ways to make recipes healthier).

I have to tell you, this was amazing. I shared this with my family and they all loved it, now you know I love Mexican foods. So I had to spice it up the second time I made it and I added beans and jalapenos peppers, of course I had to add another box of jeff corn bread mix. I love this recipe the first time and the second time, try it you will enjoy this and your family will love this…. God bless you and enjoy

This was good but not good enough to add to the rotation; a bit too bland for us.  My husband would have preferred without the bottom layer of cornbread.  However, the top layer of Jiffy with the cheese mixed in is worth borrowing for another meat casserole.  Will probably make a variation of this with corn on the bottom, topped with cheese mixture, topped with a different spicier meat mixture, topped with the Jiffy/cheese mixture.

This was so good! A hit with my whole family. I left out the cheese, because of allergies, and used three boxes of Jiffy. It was really easy, although time consuming considering you have to cook it and then bake it. Using left overs would really speed up the meal. I would definitely make this again!

It doesn't taste like tamales, but yum yum!  Followed recipe exactly the first 4 or 5 times.  This will be great for potlucks.  I like the new 9x13 size recipe even better.  However, we really don't like the corn so I substituted a can of rinsed black beans this time and it was even better.  I think I will add more cheese to the cheese layer next time.

Minimal, incidental changes... Ground turkey for ground beef, serrano for poblano peppers, fresh market salsa from the grocery store instead of jarred salsa, canned corn for frozen, and butter for greasing the pan. Also I shredded my own queso blanco. So really I just made something based off of this recipe and it was great!
Its a great idea because you can put any fillers you want in the meat sauce. I might try chorizo next time, or a mix or chorizo and beef. In the video Chef John says to fill your meat sauce layer to the edge of the pan, and then on the next cornbread layer to avoid the edges in order to allow venting. I tried something different, and it works well to keep the meat sauce in the middle with a 0.5in space away from the edge of the pan all the way around. Then the next layer is filled as normal. That's how I got the layering pictured.

I also did half the recipe and still got two 9in circle baking pans out of it.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I tweaked it a bit.  I didn't add any peppers (the individuals I work with can't handle any heat), but added some cumin and ground coriander to the meat.  Instead of adding the corn as a separate layer, I cooked the corn in the meat mixture and tossed in a small can of black olives from the pantry.  For the top layer of the corn muffin mix, I added some diced green onions along with the cheese.  For condiments, we used salsa and sour cream.  The muffin layers had the right amount of moistness and I think the brand of muffin mix really helped the dish (I used Famous Dave's).  Will definitely make again. Thanks!

We use half the amount of cornbread suggested.

I really really liked this. My 17 year old thought the corn bread part was weird, but he just got over being sick. (We'll chock it up to that.) As soon as I tasted it, I said, "I'm going to put this in a regular rotation!" Made as stated amount wise, but had to sub Anaheim peppers because Poblanos weren't available at my grocery store, and also subbed ground turkey because I rarely use ground beef anymore. I cut up a little bit of the left over pepper, some green onions and some avocado to top it, plus a little sour cream and some crushed tortilla chips. (You know...those pieces left over at the bottom of the chip bag.) Can't wait to eat it tomorrow for lunch.

I make this easy casserole about twice a month from fall-spring. It's delicious, and you can add or subtract anything you want and it still comes out great. I have made it with beef and ground turkey as well. Can't go wrong with this recipe!

Was easy and tasty, whoch since we all work is a big deal. The only thing I did differently is I halved the recipe. We still got dinner and a couple of work lunches out of it. If you pack,it for lunch, remember to take some salsa, it is a great addition.

We loved it.  I didn't have 2 Jiffy corn bread mixes on hand so just mixed up a corn bread batter recipe from scratch (which equals 2 Jiffy mixes).  Nor did I have the poblano peppers so I substituted with finely chopped green pepper and onion.  Everything else followed the recipe.  It tasted good, looked good and I will be making it again.

Made a few little changes. Firstly, halved the recipe since there's just the two of use. Added diced onion to the ground beef. Used jalapeños since that was what I had on hand. And only used one box of Jiffy which I put all on top. So good!! Hubby was praising it the entire way thru dinner and helped himself to a second serving. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is excellent! I made as directed with the exception of using a larger box of cornbread mix (11oz) but still used 2 eggs and 2/3 cups milk. I am so glad I did not doctor the recipe, as the flavor is perfect if you follow the directions. The pablano peppers give it a unique flavor I don't think green peppers could. It's not very spicy, my 20 month old ate it. I baked 37 minutes. I did drain the fat from the meat (which was not mentioned in the directions). I baked in 2 8x8 pans so I can freeze one for later. Excellent!

Delicious.  The family loved it and asked that it be put in the rotation.  The poblanos were a great touch, adding to the picante sauce.  I doubled the recipe for sweet corn bread on this site as I had all the ingredients handy, and it was a perfect complement to the meat filling.

Thank you, Chef John, for another delicious, satisfying, yet simple weeknight meal.

I added  garlic and onion to the meat mixture per other reviews and our own taste.  If it is corn season, cut off the niblets from four ears of corn and it is even more delicious.

I made this last night and it was very good!  My daughter LOVED it!  I tweaked the recipe slightly because I didn't have Pablano Peppers.  I used a can of Chopped Green Chiles and 1/2 can of Chopped Jalapeno Peppers instead, and it came out really good.  I will definitely make this again!!

Fantastic!  I followed others with the Rotel instead of Salsa & cooked the meat with some onion.  I halved the recipe & made in an 8x8 pan (i divided the 1 box of cornbread after I mixed it up).  Topped it with sour cream & some chopped cilantro.  The cilantro really took it up a notch.  I used a full can of Rotel plus a little salsa.  The dried chipotle chile pepper really added a wonderful smokey flavor.  I do not think taco seasoning is necessary as others stated in reviews.  That would take away from the flavor of the chipotle.  I was concerned about the little thin layer of cornbread on top & bottom but it rose beautifully & was just the perfect amount.  My husband requested this recipe be in the weekly rotation.

This recipe was a fabulous guide! I did not have poblano peppers or chipotle peppers. I used instead Adams reserve Southwest rub found at H-E-B stores.

Great comfort food dish.  I did not use peppers in this dish since the kids don't like peppers.  Tastes great with a little hot sauce on it, some sour cream and a cold beer.

This was really, really good! We loved it. We did have to sub diced green chilies in place of the poblanos because the store was out of poblanos, but nevertheless, a very tasty recipe and we are saving it for future use!

Great recipe, and I made it gluten free! Here's how: instead of the Jiffy corn bread mix, buy two boxes of gluten free Bisquick (available at most stores now - either right next to the regular Bisquick or in the hippie area with all of the gluten free stuff). Make the recipe on the back for the biscuits and put one batch on the bottom, and a second batch on the top (with the cheese and all). Voila! Everything else in there is already gluten free. I ended up cooking for 40 mins because the top was already browning nicely.

Outstanding! We went back for seconds and thirds.  Our local store did not have Poblano peppers so I substituted a combination of green bell peppers and Jalapeno peppers. Also used Pace Picante sauce instead of Salsa, so it was pretty spicy!  Other than that, I followed recipe exactly. I will definitely make this recipe again. Thank you Chef John!

With other recipes, I often base my approach on the reviews as much as the original recipe, but not when the recipe comes from Chef John.  :-)  I followed it as written, except I used ground pork (we're not beef eaters).  The feedback was not the usual, "yeah, this is pretty good" that I am accustomed to with casseroles.  This was described as "killer" and "the best".  Definitely a keeper, but I knew that before I started.  I have learned so much from Chef John.

Excellent recipe!  I added onion and garlic to the meat while browning, drained off some of the fat, added in the poblano peppers  (sometimes incorrectly called pasilla chiles in the grocery stores I found out), oregano, salt, 1 can of Rotel drained and thick and chunky roasted garlic salsa to equal 2 cups. I used 1 tablespoon taco seasoning instead of the ground chipotle . Simmered  for about 10 min and stirred in some black olives and chopped fresh cilantro.  I followed the recipe, using more cheese than called for and mine was done baking in 45 minutes. Served with sour cream and salsa on top and on the side , a simple salad of iceberg and romaine lettuces , chopped tomatoes and Catalina dressing. We all loved it and can't wait to eat the rest tonight! This recipe is a keeper! My first time making a recipe by Chef John and it was great. Thank you!

I’ve made this recipe SEVERAL times and it’s always a hit. My husband requests it all year long, but it’s especially tasty when the weather gets colder. I use have chorizo and half ground turkey for the meat, adding onion, garlic, cayenne, and crushed red pepper flakes to the meat. I use black bean and corn salsa. You can’t go wrong with this one!

This turned out great, though I tweaked it. Instead of two pounds of beef I used one pound plus black and pinto beans.  I added onion and garlic and jalepeno (I had no chipotle).  I used only one package of corn bread, which was plenty.  It turned out delicious.

Yummy and family friendly!  Used 1.5 lbs of ground beef and less cheese.  Family really liked it.  A good base recipe - next time may add pinto or black beans, a bit more spice (taco seasoning?), and top it with taco sauce, sour cream, etc.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a very good recipe. I did do some tweaking, though. I eliminated the corn as I don't like it much and left out the oregano. I don't know what the oregano would add as it's not much of a Mexican-food flavor, in my opinion. I didn't use the chipotle pepper as I didn't have any.
Some raters wrote that the dish was bland so I added 2 teaspoons of taco seasoning to the meat, salt to the corn muffin mix, and extra cheese (at least a cup more). Also, I used 1 lb beef and 1 lb chicken sausage to kick things up. Once I mixed the top muffin mix part, I had to add more liquid, stock, to get it to spread at all. 
I baked the dish for only 40 minutes and it came out perfectly browned on top.
Really delicious dish but I felt it could do with more meat and without the bottom corn muffin layer. I will be making this again for sure.

Super yummy! :) Loved it. I did some things different...but the main recipe is amazing. I used green chilies instead...the last bit of instructions confused me (boys messing around in the kitchen while I was trying to cook...) and so I added the corn in with the meat mixture and added all the cheese in the one corn bread mixture. And I only used cheddar cheese. It was great. Thanks.

Perfect!  Followed recipe exactly.  My husband was so excited that he watched Chef John's tutorial (it's short and simple) and was able to begin preparing it ahead for us!!!  It was also so easy and inexpensive!

Wonderful recipe! I made some modifications with what I had on hand. Added a can of pinto beans and felt it needed a little more juice, so I put in a can a tomato paste with just enough water to keep it slightly runny. I didn’t want it too thick so the corn bread didn’t suck up all the juice!!! Added 1 & 1/2 t chipotle seasoning ( so it wouldn’t taste like tomato paste. Didn’t have boxed cornbread, so I mixed up a batch and poured it on the top, a couple handfuls of cheese sprinkled on top before baking for about 25-30 minuets. Served with a scoop of sour cream, a sprinkle of fresh cilantro & avocado wedges. There was 1 serving left after dinner, my son came home from work the next day and ate it while raving “ you GOT to make this again! Do try this, thanks for the great recipe!

I made no changes to this recipe.  My husband and I loved it.  The Jiffy mix was a little too sweet for my hubby  but not for me.  Next time I might try it with my  usual cornbread recipe which is not as sweet as the jiffy mix but I loved it just as is.

I always love Chef John's food. In the recipe intro, he admits its not akin to tamale... I didn't read the reviews... But I added diced onions and garlic while browning the beef. I ended up add cumin. Coriander. Paprika,  oregano, and Chili powder--basically taco seasoning. I also used canned freshcut corn as I prefer it to frozen. I also drained some of the fat off the beef... Nect time, I might use my own corn bread recipe.  Jiffy mix is too sweet. This is a great base for tamale pie!

Used 1lb of meat and added 1 can (drained/rinsed) red kidney beans. Added 3.8 oz (drained/rinsed) sliced olives, 1/2 the cheddar cheese, no jack. Did not layer the corn, just added it to the meat mixture. Browned the meat with 1/2 a yellow onion diced and about 5 or 6 minced garlic, salt and pepper . Did not use salsa, instead I used a small 8oz can  of tomato sauce and a small 8oz can of jalapeno tomato sauce . Added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and only 1/2 teaspoon of salt, a dash of paprika on the top corn meal before baking. Followed the recipe instructions. Came out GREAT!

Nope, I followed Chef John's instructions closely, using Pace Hot Picante Sauce in the recipe.  It is so good!  I will definitely be making this again.  and again.

Very good! I used ground turkey and followed some of the other reviews by using taco seasonings, rotel,  Worcestershire, onions, garlic,  black beans and corn. Jiffy on the top and bottom. We love cornbread! Anyway, great recipe...

Made this per the directions using medium salsa. It tasted really good but we thought it should be a little spicier (an easy fix). This recipe is real keeper!

We made it as directed and it was a big hit. I served it over some shredded lettuce and pico de gallo and then topped it with some more pico and cheese dip. This will definitely go into our family’s rotation of Mexican recipes!

A keeper for sure. We used Rotel instead of salsa, green and red peppers instead of poblanos, substituted a can of drained black beans for half the beef, and added 2 T of mole paste to the mix. A drained can of corn worked out just fine.

I made this for my regular game night.  It was such a big hit that other people wanted the recipe.  I will be keeping this recipe handy for future use.

I should mention I made this as a one pot meal.  I put the two boxes of cornbread on top of the mixture and used a heavy cast iron enameled pot.

I have made this many times for family and potluck parties. It always disappears. I substitute ground turkey for the beef, I use 2 jalapeño peppers in place of the poblanos, and use cumin powder in place of the chipotle powder. So easy, so inexpensive, and so good.

This is a simple and quick recipe that I now regularly prepare. Make sure to not make your meat mixture too thick so that a moist pie is your final result.

Great recipe! Couldn't find poblanos so used jalapenos instead. Holds up well for leftovers. We've been eating it for lunch for a couple days now. A little sour cream on the top...delish!

This recipe was delicious! I used a can of creamed corn instead of the frozen corn, and my fiance and I loved it! I also used red pepper flakes instead of an actual pepper since I did not have one on hand. It was still a good amount of spice!

I made the changes others suggested:  1. Substitute 2 10 oz. cans of Rotel for the salsa  2. Added a spoonful of chopped prepared garlic and two chopped onions.   The result was absolutely delicious!!!!  You need to like spicy food to enjoy this.  It's not mouth-hurting spicy, but it sure has a kick, whether it's due to the poblanos or chipotle powder I'm not sure. It has so, so much flavor.  I will be making this a lot.

Very good flavor only used 1 cup diced poblano pepper.  Twice the cheese inside both the casserole as well as the cornbread mix on top. Very good. Rotella adds a little too much kick for hubby. Next time will probably try 1/2 cup poblano & 1/2 cup green pepper to make a touch milder. Added small diced onion to the peppers with meat while cooking. Added salt as directed. Then salted again and shouldn't have. Salt in recipe is plenty. Definitely will make again.

This tasted amazing and was pretty easy to make.  Not  that the list of ingredients has an error -- I don't think it's really 2 cups of jalapenos.  I used two jalapenos and sweet peppers to make two cups.

I made just a few changes, otherwise follow exact directions.  I used chipotle cheese vs using cheddar and ground chipotle.  I also added garlic and onion to meat.  You should use a puree type salsa vs chunky as well.

My husband and I made this together. We added onion and garlic and less chilies. The pan was a bit larger so I used extra cornbread mix and cheese.

It was a great potluck dish.

Excellent dish! We loved it. This is going to become a regular in our house. It made several dinners. I only had 1 box of Jiffy and it turned out great. In fact, I think it would have been overflowing if I had used two.

This was an excellent recipe, except for one thing.  For ease, I used the Jiffy cornbread mix and it is just too sweet for me.  Next time I will use my own cornbread recipe.  The meat with the Poblano peppers and salsa was a great combination and was very good.  Will absolutely make it again, just with different cornbread.

This was really very good. I skipped the peppers and fried onion and garlic with the ground beef. I did a layer of cheese on top of the corn then layered the beef and mixed in the rest of the cheese in the cornbread for the top layer. Easy to make and was a quick week night dinner. It does make a large amount, next time I will cut recipe in half for just the two of us. Thanks Chef John.

We really loved this.  Only 2 of us so I did half the recipe and only cooked 40 mins.  Kept to the recipe except for just a couple of things. Used gr. turkey just because we prefer over gr. beef and I did add some onion and garlic while browning the meat.  Will make again!!  Oh, I didn't have any Chipotle gr. pepper so subbed some Chipotle hot sauce, worked well.

We added some extra garlic and onion. Our family just likes stronger flavors. We loved the use of Poblano peppers. I can' t recall every cooking with them before so the flavor was a nice surprise for us. So easy to throw together. I also tried this with some chopped up leftover roast and liked that even better. The whole family loves this but has unanimously agreed that two layers of cornbread is too much. Reducing the cornbread would definitely make this five stars. This WAS too spicy for my twelve year old as written. Not for the rest of us though. We loved it.

This was so delicious! I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had 1 lb of meat I also didn't have any cornbread mix so I had to make mine from scratch and you know what I think it's ten times better that way even though you dirty a few more dishes.

Liked this recipe, but made some adjustments.  Added 1 small can of tomato sauce instead of the salsa, added can of green chilis, and sliced
olives, plus some taco seasoning mix.
     I only added the one box of cornbread mix with the cheese over the
top of the meat mixture, and baked this for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.
     I will be making this again!

Good recipe. I did make some minor changes, but just based on history/personal preferences.(Used mild Rotel, instead of salsa and peppers, just Mexican cheese blend , taco seasoning, putting a tablespoon of oil in cornbread mix). If you're looking for something just like the 1st picture, then may want to consider halving cornbread, or just using one box, perhaps in a 9X9" pan. Ended up more bready than anticipated, but still good. Also the "layering" part was a little confusing as a 1st time preparer. Bake time ended up being only about 35 minutes. Other than that pretty tasty.

This was a great and easy dinner.  It's only the two of us so I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in a smaller dish.  We are not pepper people so I left them out but added a 1/4 of an onion, a package of taco seasoning and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. Turned out great.  Only used 1 box of muffin mix also.  Thanks for the recipe and all the ideas!

This recipe is amazing.  I changed things up a bit.... I used a bag of frozen mexican vegetables and added them to the beef when it was just about cooked.  I used Rot-tel instead of salsa and minced garlic.  Then to put an added spin on it.... I cubed up Philadelphia Cream Cheese and placed it on top of my meat mixture before adding the top layer or cornbread.  It gave it so much rich flavor that I will definetly make it like this again.  Fresh chopped cilantro with sour cream when served as well!!  Very Yummy!

There are so many possibilities that would make this dish perfect! I loved the sweetness of the corn muffin mixed with the peppery spices and salt in the meat. Very good! It was definitely delicious but, I know I could make it better suit my families tastes. I pretty much followed the recipe aside from adding a little garlic, cumin, and onion powder. It wasn't more than a pinch of each spice that I'd added and that's all it needed. I tasted the filling and I felt it needed more flavor. Adding a bit more cheese next time might be a possibility as well, because it was the tiniest bit dry this time around. I wonder if there is something you could add to take some of the dryness away. Maybe an extra egg in the bread mix? I don't know. What I do know, is that I'll definit make this again. You just can't go wrong with any of Chef Johns recipes.

It tasted great! This can easily feed 5 people, my husband and I not even half of the dish. 
Things I would do differently: I added onions to the menu and cooked the meat with the onions and green beans fully in a skillet before adding the salsa. I also added parsley to the salsa. I used just a palm-full of each cheese to the corn mixture then barely coated the meat with cheese while in the pan...next time I am going to add a lot more cheese.

This was AMAZING! I expected a throwback to the 80s but it was bright and spicy, with plenty of heat but the corn cooled it down some.

We served it with some Trader Joe's Enchilada sauce on top - yogurt might have been a better idea.

I love this recipe, I have made at least 2 dozen times. I make it vegetarian, so I substitute the meat for  morning star grillers. Highly recommended!!!

Very good. Mine was a bit dry, think I cooked the meat mixture too long thinking the bottom  would get soggy, next time I won't do that. Easy to make and a lot for just my husband and me.  We have eaten this for three days now, doubt that he would want 'the same old thing again!! We would have plenty for tonight and I also froze some of it. 

Wouldn't he be thrilled if I thawed it out a  couple days and have MORE of it? LOL... I'll wait a couple weeks...

I made this last night and my family absolutely loved it. I did add a package of taco seasoning,some homemade salsa and a can of blackbeans(drained & rinsed) and minced garlic. This will now be a part of my meal rotations...

Very good but I thought the top part was slightly dry. Don't know if it was because I used egg beaters instead? But my boyfriend loved it!

I'm sure this is amazing as written but I felt I needed to make it a bit more heart healthy. 1st I used 1# 93% ground beef, drained and rinsed (don't worry, the wet ingredients will make it moist enough). Mixed a can of fat free refried beans in along with fresh purchased store-made salsa and the spices. Added a 4 oz can of sliced olives as a layer. In the corn bread, I used egg substitute and skim milk. Used reduced fat cheeses. We enjoyed this dish quite a lot. Froze half since it was just for my DH and me!

Tried this recipe today for New Years Day dinner and it was delicious!  It was something different for us and fun to try.  My husband thought it was great also.  I made my own cornbread instead of using Jiffy.  The recipe is from allrecipes called "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread."  It is an easy way to make cornbread and very tasty.  I followed some other people's reviews and used only 1 pound of beef and added black beans.  I also chopped up some onion and garlic, which I added when I added the peppers.  I think the recipe is great as is but am also excited to try some variations.

Excellent! Substituted 2 cans Rotel, doubled the cheese, added about half can of black beans. My daughter, who doesn't like spicy food, loved it!

This is a great recipe and easy to adapt to whatever you have available. I often use leftover chili (with beans) for the meat mixture and beaten eggs for the bottom layer. Pepper, cheese, cornbread all good!!

I made this last night and it was a huge hit.  However, I didn't have any salsa or hot peppers, so I pretty much prepared the ground turkey the same way I would for spaghetti.  I browned it with garlic, onion, and red peppers, and seasoned it with garlic powder, pepper, salt, and Italian seasoning.  Then i poured tomato spaghetti sauce over it and let it simmer a bit.  I then followed the instructions for the cornbread, corn, cheese, meat, and cornbread again.  It was truly delicious.  I was a bit worried, because I deviated alot from the original recipe, but it still turned out great!  thanks!!

My husband and I really liked it, but I will have to lower the amount of poblano peppers for the kids -- it was a bit spicy. We served it with avocado slices, a bit of sour cream, and extra cheese on top.... definitely will make again, and it is definitely good as left-overs, too!

Loved this recipe!  I substituted the chipotle pepper with 1/2 tsp. of chili powder and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper.  Not too spicy - even my young kids ate it!  I used a chipotle salsa from a jar and it really added a lot of flavor!  I will definitely make this again!

My husband is mexican and he hated that this was called Tamale Pie, but he certainly did NOT complain after biting into the first bite! My family enjoyed this meal, asking me to keep it around to make again.  We added some HOT Salsa, and it wasn't spicy enough, going to amp it up some more next time. Otherwise wonderful.  I did not include the peppers and I used a Mixed Vegetable mix.

Didn't have poblanos so I added a couple of minced jalapenos, forgot the corn. All cheese inside and used 1.2 of ground turkey instead. Added a chopped up red bell and lots of black olive slices. Went back and forth trying to decide on half or full recipe. Went with full and so glad I did. LOVED it. And as I like to do, I drizzled with honey before eating.

We LOVED this recipe. The only changes I made were to drain the beef fat before adding the rest of the ingredients and we added chilli powder, cayane, red pepper flakes and a bit of cumin. It was a hit! It was an enormous amount of food though. Next time I will do 1lb beef, 1 pepper, and only make a top crust. 

I will definitely make this again and again.

This was the tastiest thing I've had in a while, and very simple to prepare!  I doubled the recipe and froze one, so I look forward to enjoying this meal again soon.  What's nice is that you can make it as spicy (or not) as you wish, depending on your salsa preference.  I was cooking for my kids, so I substituted chili powder for the chipotle seasoning and used a milder salsa.  I agree with some of the other reviewers on the baking time; 40 minutes was PERFECTION.  Any longer and I think it would've been over-browned and dried-out.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was super.  I made it as written.  Very flavorful.  I was afraid the meat mixture was going to be too spicy (it was very spicy upon tasting) but the double-layer of cornbread cooled things down.  I did think that the corn was delicious so for myself, I'll add more.  Also, one could probably leave out the  bottom layer of cornbread for calorie reasons, but it  truly was delish and I will make again, probably with the bottom cornbread intact.  I could NOT find the chipotle pepper in the supermarket and ended up buying "Spicy Chipotle Chicken" spices (those little cards with the spices attached, already pre-measured) because it had the perfect amount of Chipotle pepper in it.

Made this last night, WOW awesome!!!  2 boxes Jiffy cornbread mix (milk and eggs to make bread), 1 can mild rotel, taco seasoning, onion, small can corn, 1.5 - 2 lbs ground beef, 1 cup shredded cheese brown meat with diced onion drain if needed, add taco mix and drained Rotel simmer  to cook off moisture. In a casserole (mine cooked over in a loaf pan I recommend using a larger casserole dish) spray with butter spray, mix one box of muffin mix pour into bottom of pan. Pour drained corn then 1/2 cheese on top og mix, top with meat mix. Mix 2nd box of muffin mix according to directions add the rest of the cheese -top meat mix leaving space at the edges for steam to escape. 350 for 50 minutes did it for my oven. We ate it with salsa over it. OMG it was so good and crazy easy.

I added 1 can rotel tomatoes, 4 large cloves garlic, and 1 onion.  Didn't have chipotle powder so added chili powder.  My family liked it but thought maybe it needed something to make it more moist.  I liked it and will make again.

Made this tonight as I needed something easy and had the ingredients in the cupboard and it went over well! I did add some adobo and green chilis along with some red pepper flakes for lack of poblanos. I also used pepper jack cheese and extra minced garlic.
Next time, however, I may mix some chorizo for an extra kick, and a tad more cheese for spreading on the corn layer!

I made this recipe with very few changes to the recipe and it was excellent!!  I added a little more cheese because I don't think you can evey have too much cheese.  I also used roasted salsa, which gave it a little smokey flavor which was amazing.  The family loved it!  I will add this recipe to our dinner rotation for sure.

What a great recipe!  The cornbread came out great and my son thought it was better than chicken pot pie (which is his absolute favorite!)  I did add a bit more "hot" with plabanos because my family just loves spicy food!

I didn't have all the spices, but still worked out.  I should have drain ground beef before adding other ingredients so that the spices and juices of my homemade salsa remained in mix before I put in casserole with corn bread. It was a little dry but very tasty. just added more salsa on top when served. peppers were so sweet and good.

I've done something similar to this before, but with the cornbread only on the top.  I tried this recipe and it turned out just as good, if not better, than the recipe I was using before.  I didn't have the peppers, and I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the salsa (which I didn't have) so I had to simmer it for 30+ minutes to cook off the moisture.  For spices, I used chili powder, taco seasoning, garlic powder, oregano, and basil.  I also added a can of kidney beans.  The finished pie was delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

Made it for the family for Christmas eve dinner. Everyone loved it, and I was told I could make it again and again. Lots left over as it turned out way bigger than I expected. I am sure it will taste even better reheated.

Wow.  This was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  I added a tablespoon of my boyfriend's "secret" chili spice mix (he won't tell me his secret, said it's a hodge podge of 15 different spices though).  I omitted the chipotle powder and added a can of black beans and a 1/2 cup of onions which I sauteed with the meat (the onions).  I used a Mexican cheese mixture because it was on sale.  Seriously, this was soo good!  I highly recommend this to everyone!

It's good, worth making again. My husband eats such hot things that unless flames are shooting out his mouth it's "bland" to him.  Versatile, you can easily tweak and substitute whatever you want in the meat mixture (adding black beans and such). I have added diced fire-roasted jalapenos to the corn mix before and it was good. My biggest beef with this recipe: spreading the corn mix over the top. UGH! It seems like there isn't enough and when you spread it it has to take the meat mixture with it. Also, next time, more meat, less corn mix.

This is a fabulous recipe but since I changed the ingredients around, I'm rating it a 5 based on the changes I made because I didn't have all the ingredients. I substituted 2 packets of chipotle taco seasoning mix for the chipotle powder. I sauteed one fresh jalapeno pepper, 2 cloves of minced garlic and one large sweet onion in olive oil. Browned the two pounds of ground beef, added the sauteed veggies and poured 20 ounces of hot salsa in with the meat mixture. Husband LOVED the dish. He always bragged about his mom's tamale pie but he said that the one I prepared for him was the BEST he ever had. Whew! I also used canned corn instead of frozen corn. Didn't have poblano peppers at our grocery store and it's why I used a minced fresh jalapeno. I will certainly be making this recipe again. This is just a great website for wonderful recipes. I have never been disappointed. Thank you so much Chef John.

Oh man this is good!  Love the way the cornbread makes this a tasty meal and you can do what ever you want to the insides.  I didn't have a lot of what was listed on hand.  I threw in canned diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce, some sauted onions, fresh oregano and a package of taco seasoning and diced some Jalopenos.  Yummy!  It was great!

I didn't go the Jiffy route, I made my own cornbread from another recipe on here (Homesteader Cornbread). This is a great way to stretch out a small amount of meat and feed a lot of people for very little money. I'd like to try it with shredded pork next time. Thanks for a great recipe and fun video, Chef John!

While we adjusted the recipe from 8 servings to 4, this was fantastic! Unfortunately, we had no poblano peppers on hand, so we had to use the sweeter bulls-horn peppers and add cayenne for the heat. We made it 3 days ago, and already I'm craving more!

This was SOOOO Delish!  I make a Taco Pie as well and love it so much but thought I would try this as well.  The only changes I made was with the meat mixture.  I browned the meat, then drained and added taco seasoning and water and let it simmer.  Served it with sour cream and guacamole, YUM!!  The corn adds a nice flavor too.

Loved it!  This was so good my husband and I could not stop eating it.  I do not buy corn bread mix so I made some from scratch.  Used green peppers in place of poblano peppers.  Will definitely be making again and again.

I really liked this dish! My husband did not.  He thought there was too much corn bread and not enough meat.  I am going to make it again and not do corn bread on the bottom, just the top.  I also cooked my meat with some peppers for some extra flavor.  It was a tasty meal.  It was quick and easy

Made with ground turkey and green chiles. Jiffy is too sweet for this savory dish so I made 1 box and 1 scratch cornbread mixed.  Also used diced tomatoes and red enchilada sauce.

Made this exactly as recipe stated, and everyone liked it. Even the picky eaters enjoyed it.  All did say it could use a little more moisture and spice. I’m thinking that some Rotel tomatoes would have kicked it up a notch.

I would give a higher rating, but mine turned out dry.  Both filling and cornbread...I am making this for a church potluck and decided to try it out on my family......ugh!   Thank you!  We have quite a bit left over..when I make it for church I will use Rotel as suggested by others and a packet of taco seasoning...that should keep the heat down because mine was a bit spicy, although my salsa was Medium, I roasted the poblanos and pealed them and rinsed out the seed.  I think I will skip that step...

I spiced this up quite a bit and could have done even more. For our taste, it would have been pretty bland as written. I used hot salsa, extra chipotle chili powder, and seasoned the meat as I sautéed it. I did use ground turkey instead of the beef so that may have contributed.
I felt there was way too much cornbread and I will only put it on the top next time.
Having said all of that it was still quite tasty and made enough to freeze some plus have lunches for the two of us.

This was very good! The only change I did was add more grilled onions and poured in red enchilada sauce into the meat/salsa mix. The only enchilda sauce I would recommend is La Frontera sold in a pouch in the Mexican food section in most grocery stores. My guest LOVED this dish! Baked at 375 for 45 min and was perfect!

This recipe is delicious and my favorite kind of tamale pie I’ve made. I also include fresh cilantro and onion in the meat and vegetable mixture for a little more flavor and I use an extra 4 oz of cheese to make it a little more cheesy.

Used half hamburger and half veggie crumbles. Thought chili powder a little too much. Would use half as much next time. Loved crusty corn bread, could have doubled cheese. Used sour cream as garnish.

Think it would be good making meat with empanada seasoning. 

Will make it again.

This was an excellent recipe. It had just the right amount of heat. I did use jalapeños instead of the other peppers. Only four of them. Next time I think I would use both jalapeños and bell peppers.

This sounded so good, but the end result was not what I expected. WAY too much bread. I may try making it again using only one box of cornbread mix and either putting it on top or on the bottom. It turned out pretty.

Yum! I made this with venison because that's what we had, and used Rotel instead of salsa like others suggested. I used two cans but probably should have just done one because it was pretty wet, even after draining off some of the liquid. It still tasted delicious, it just wasn't really like a solid. Also added some chopped zucchini but hardly even noticed it once it was all together. Definitely added some extra spices too but my husband did that part so not even sure what all he added.

I used Jiffy cornbread mix and it was way too sweet-no one liked it. Recipe does not specify what brand to use-therefore,  1/3 cup milk and 1 egg  per box is subject to what mix you are using. Did not care for it at all.

Excellent flavors! Comes together quickly if you chop ingredients ahead of time. For us, the bottom layer of cornbread is plenty, and we LOVE cornbread. I’ll definitely make it again using just the bottom layer of cornbread.

This is a family and friends favorite! I make it in a lasagna pan so we can make it a bit larger. A cubenelle and orange or red pepper work great. I also use onion and garlic when cooking the meat. Extra salsa keeps the meat from drying out as well when reheating. Plus we use a 3rd Jiffy mix and split it between top and bottom. Seems to be gone way too fast in our house hold!
Chef John, your recipes are foolproof! Thank you!

Made this pretty much as is except I didn’t have poblano peppers so I substituted with 2 jalapeño peppers.  This is a great recipe will definitely make again and don’t plan on changing it.

I made 1/2 the recipe and used 10-1/2 cast iron pan.  I added green pepper and red onion.  This is a very forgiving recipe as you can add whatever you like.  I added black olives on top of the corn muffin mix(only used one box on top). The whole thing was cooked in c.i. from browning meat, draining the fat, adding the vegetables and then the corn muffin topping and baking for 15 mins.  I will make again.

I changed the servings to 4.  I did not put the corn muffin mix on the bottom.  Completed the rest of the recipe just like it stated.  It was awesome!  I will make this again and again.

I went totally off the reservation with recipe and loved the results. First, Poblanos, if not roasted, have all the charm and flavor of pieces of green plastic, and I didn't want to mess with roasting a pound of poblanos. Instead I used a 28 oz can of chilpotle peppers in adobo sauce. Since the peppers came in adobo sauce, I abandoned the salsa and just used the adobo. I had stewed tomatoes on hand, but there was plenty of moisture with just the can of peppers. Finally, I did home made corn bread (as other reviewers have mentioned), but for dishes like this I like the cake-like texture, and especially the flavor of Masa Harina, so I used that instead of corn meal in the corn bread portion of the recipe. I also added a small onion and clove of garlic when browning the meat. Other than that, the recipe was exactly as Chef John described it. This is definitely a Super Bowl or World Cup or World Series dish.

I halved the recipe as there's only 2 of us, it was tasty but next time I think I'll add some beans and just put the cornbread on top as some reviews have suggested. Will definitely make again.

So yummy. I cut the recipe in half and used a cast iron skillet. It made enough for at least 6 generous portions. I just added a can of black beans and used rotel instead of salsa. I left the meat mixture in the skillet, added the corn on top then spread the cornbread mixture on top and baked. Served with sour cream and black olives. Keeping this one for sure as it can be adjusted very easily to accommodate whatever mood or ingredients you have on hand.

Five stars, husband loved it.  It was so rich, I served the pie with lightly sautéed zucchini & onion on the side.  I love to read the reviews before I make recipes and decide if I want to tweak anything to my husband's taste.  In this case, I halved the recipe to 4 servings.  Chopped 1 1/2 poblanos and about half a large onion and sweat them, then put them aside and browned the ground beef a bit, mopped up the excess fat with a paper towel (a la Chef John).  Added in the onion/poblano mix along with the salsa, recipe seasonings, added garlic and onion powder and shakes of taco seasoning mix.  Then added in about 1/4 cup water and let it simmer down a bit for a few minutes.  I did add a squeeze of honey to the Jiffy mix.  Layered almost half the Jiffy mix in the buttered 9X9 casserole dish, baked that for about 7-8 minutes at 350, removed casserole dish, then put a 6 oz can of no salt added corn (drained!) over the par-cooked Jiffy mix, then extra jack cheese than the recipe calls for.  Poured the meat mixture over that, added extra jack cheese to the remaining Jiffy mixture and poured that over the meat, leaving the edges open and being careful NOT to get any of the meat/sauced mixture on it.  Baked for approximately 37 minutes.  Let sit for a good amount of time to set up before cutting.  So delicious!  I was leary of the meat mixture being bland, but, that was not the case.  And husband has two lunches for the rest of the week he's looking forward to!

This was terrific! I halved the recipe and culled additions/changes from other reviewers and mixed the beef with taco seasoning mix and a can of mild Rotel tomatoes with green chiles, and made the corn bread recipe from the back of my corn meal packaging. Next time I will use a smaller, deeper baking dish, as I was a bit shy of cornbread on top for the 9x13 rectangular baking dish I used. Another winner from Chef John!

We make this dish at least twice a year. It's absolutely delicious!  Of course I do add a few more ingredients  such as bellpeppers,garlic and just a small amount of sugar so the tomatoe sauce won't taste as bitter.

I really don't like tamales, but I thought this was somewhat different, so I gave it a try.  My husband and I really liked this dish!  I don't keep Jiffy mix on hand so I used a substitute recipe (2/3 c.flour, 1/2 c. cornmeal, 3 T. sugar, 1 T. baking powder, 1/2 t. salt and 2 T. veg. oil. Mix all together.  Equals 1 box Jiffy mix).  I made 2 of these recipes to equal the 2 boxes called for in this recipe.  Other than that, it was made exactly as written.  Served with a dollop of sour cream on the side.  I loved the "corny" taste combined with the seasoned beef.  It smelled like a corn dog while baking in the oven, which gave me a craving for corn dogs.  ;-)

Thanks once again Chef John!  Your recipes never fail me.  I needed to use up some corn and ground beef and came up with this recipe  when I searched for something with those ingredients.  The only changes I made (per other suggestions ) were substituting green and red bell pepper for the poblano peppers.  I also had only a partial jar of salsa so I supplemented with a can of Rotel.  I was worried that the bottom layer of corn bread would not cook but it did.  My family pronounced it delicious.  The sweetness of the cornbread makes a good combination with the spiciness of the meat mixture.  5 stars, at least!!

Everyone enjoyed this meal. I did make my own cornbread recipe as I had read that it was sweet. Turned out perfectly. There was a nice balance of heat and the flavors were well balanced. I used more cheese than the recipe called for. Served with extra salsa and sour cream.

I gave the recipe 2 stars because the ground beef mixture is really good.  I made the recipe as directed.  I should have just left it at eating the filling.  The cornbread is sweet and the combination is awful.  I wasted a lot of good cheese which was cooked into the cornbread - and I've thrown out the cornbread bottom and top trying to salvage the meat mixture.  I've added more salsa, cheese, corn and spices and we've been able to salvage the meat mixture.

This is so worth the calories! Made 2 options 1 Vegan and 1 ground beef. Used Jiffy Boxed corn bread mix and it is fabulous!

combined the corn with the meat, also combined the cheese with the top layer of cornbread. Next time will add black beans to the meat.

I have made it twice and it is great.  You can also do a little extra what ever you want to it to make it more your own.  Easy to do.  Did it for a Church pot luck.

Love Tex Mex and great to freeze.  Chill powder, cumin & fresh cilantro. Used a few pabano peppers in chipolata sauce for heat.  Tons of garlic & onion & used hot sausage instead of hamburger.  (not a fan)

This is a tasty casserole.  If you don't have any salsa on hand, you can add chopped onions when frying the beef.  Then add the peppers, some taco seasoning and a can of diced tomatoes when the ground beef is no longer pink.

I liked this, and it was easy. But hubby didn't care for the amount of cornbread. And i didn't use poblanos ( because we couldn't find) we used red bells and a can of diced green chilies. It definitely needed more seasoning, kind of bland- maybe with the poblanos it would of been better.

Awesome dish!!!! I love it! I changed it just a bit and use just one pound of beef and added a can of black beans. I use three peppers and a bit less on the cheese and it’s to die for!

Very good and easy! I used Carne Asada taco meat instead of hamburger. Let that cook for about an hour. Next time I will use Marie Callander corn bread mix instead of jiffy.

My family enjoyed this one! I used RoTel as recommended, and added taco seasoning to the meat instead of the oregano and chipotle. I also did not use Jiffy (made with lard), but instead used another boxed corn muffin mix. Very good overall.

Made with fresh tomatillo salsa and a package of "taco seasoning" instead for the suggested spices because I was feeling lazy. I doubled everything, except the cornbread mix which I tripled, so that it would fill my large baking pan.

Added several other ingredients as suggested by other reviews i.e. black beans, Rotel, sliced olives, onions, & garlic. added oregano, Italian seasoning, chili powder, cumin.

Used 3 lbs of meat.  Made my own cornbread mix: 2 eggs, 1 Cup milk & 1 1/2 cup corn meal. Only used it on the top.

The bottom was too soggy. Had drained some of the juices before baking but apparently not all of the juices was drained. 

Next time, need to drain the meat, drain the liquid of the Rotel . 
Flavor was pretty decent but I thought the meat would hold together. Maybe add some cheese w/in the meat mixture to hold it  together.

I have been making this tamale pie recipe for 20 yrs. 1 lbs beef,1/2 an onion, a can of mild chiles, a jar of salsa, a cup of shredded cheese, a can of corn, a small can of sliced black olives. Topped with jiffy cornbread and garnished with a dollop of sour cream. Baked in a 8X8 or double in a 9X13 for a potluck. It's a real crowed pleaser.

This was tasty however, mine was a little dry.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef so that may be part of the issue.  Will try again.

I used gluten free cornbread mix & substituted 1/4 cup club soda for each egg.  I also used chopped jalapenos instead of poblano peppers.  Instead of mixing the jalapenos with the meat mixture, I mixed it with the cornbread/cheese mixture that went on top.  It was delicious.

Great base recipe but I did make some changes to add depth of flavor! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (healthier, less greasy) and I drained the meat after browning. I ditched the listed seasonings and used one packet of prepared taco seasoning instead. I also added a small can of Rotel and a can of rinsed and drained black beans. I only put the cornbread mixture on top, not on the bottom of the pan,  and it was absolutely delicious! Serve with a dollop sour cream or guacamole on top. Yum!

Recipe was a 4.5.  I did add minced garlic and onions along with a packet of taco seasoning.  Next time I'll add more chipotle pepper.  I just guessed at the cheese so it was probably more than the recipe and used a can of well-drained mexicorn.  Served with black beans for Cinco de Mayo.  Thanks Chef John!

ADD TACO SEASONING! This is 3.5 but I rounded up to a 4 star review. I did the recipe as directed and added corn and black beans. There wasn't enough flavor and it was a little bland. I will definitely make this again, but add my usual organics taco seasoning when I make this again and it will be perfection. Will probably add cheese after the casserole is cooled as well.

A hit in our house.  We do like it on the spicy side.  I added a couple of canned Chipolte peppers, along with Rotel tomatoes with green chilis, suggested by others, to the meat mixture.  (I used ground chicken) I followed the directions for the corn bread mixes. I also used frozen fire roasted corn.  Probably used a little more cheese too.  This recipe is very adaptable to your families tastes.  I served it on a bed of lettuce, along with avocado slices, tomato, cilantro and a dollop of sour cream. Thanks for another home run Chef John!

This came out great !!!!  Wife and family loved it. I did  notice someone used Rotel instead of the chopped pablanos  ,I made this substitution ,this is a great shortcut when feeding the family on short notice.

I really, really, LOVED making this hot tamale pie because I just LOV-V-V-V-VE Mexican cuisine. I also chose to use the poblano peppers  being that I never ate them before.

Tasted great and very easy to customize as others have said. I used 4 poblano peppers as well as 3 jalapeno peppers to give it a little more spice. Overall a great recipe!

We used bob red mill's gluten free cornbread mix and it makes a bit more than two boxes of jiffy...we decided it would be better with just putting cornbread on the top or bottom only.  Really great flavors. thanks for the recipe.

This was a big hit with my 15 y.o.  Down here we regard sweet cornbread like Jiffy as "Yankee" cornbread but I used it as directed and I am glad I did.  I think the sweetness is a nice counterbalance to the slight heat and smoke of the chipotle chili powder.   We will definitely make this again.

Pretty good even with my substitutions.  I didn't have the right pepper so used a green pepper plus a can of peppers plus a handful of frozen garden peppers.  Used all cheddar cheese.  Served with sour cream, avocado, black olives and taco sauce (out of salsa).

Very  Good, Easy and Flexible recipe,  The corn bread really adds a bit of sweetness to the recipe. I was concerned about how spicy this might  turn out, but it  was not really very  hot, if you like spicy food, you'll need to increase  the "Hotness" factor on this one.  This one's a keeper.

Simple recipe would very good results.  The caution about testing poblano chile "heat" was a good one.  This provides two good meals for us.

This is the second recipe of Chef John's that i have made. (The other being his stuffed pepper recipe.) My finicky bf & picky 7 year old both loved it & had seconds. (Another reviewer mentioned this recipe being her first time using poblano peppers. It was mine too. I loved them so much, i made chili with some the next day.) I halved the recipe to a "t" & it turned out spectacular. 

Thank you for sharing, Chef John!

This was spectacular! I made it with the few changes suggested by others -- Rotel canned tomatoes and chiles instead of salsa.... But I used the Jiffy mix, and the poblano pepper (never cooked with that before!) and it was fantastic! Hubby and I fought over the leftovers, it was that good.

Just made this and it is delish. I'm not big on canned ingredients so I added several fresh veggies: tomatoes, bunch of Swiss chard, n garlic. I loved the poblano peppers. I also used taco seasoning and some cayenne. I feel that 2 packages of cornbread was too much. Next time I'll use just one on top. I used 1 lb ground beef, and 1 lb ground turkey to make it a little leaner.

Turned out great, I also added minced garlic and onions when the meat was cooking as I am not a fan of the smell of beef cooking. I also added a hot pepper to spice it up a little.

I have made this a couple of times.  The first as written and it had too much cornbread for my taste.  The next time I only used one box of cornbread, spread about a third of it in the dish, added a can of corn, then the hamburger mixture, finishing with the rest of the cornbread batter with added cheese.  30 minutes was too long for this version, making the top too brown.  But everyone that had some raved about how good it was!

I didn't have enough beef, so I used some ground chicken in with it.  It was pretty good.  But next time, I'll spice it up a little more.

I made this and it is very tasty!  I did modify the ingredients by using extra taco flavored shredded cheese and used yellow and orange sweet peppers.  Also, I used a tablespoon of chili powder (like you season chili with) instead of chipotle, which I didn't have on hand.

I made this for a party we had this weekend and my friends just gobbled it up!  A few things to note:
•	I used half & half instead of milk because the ground beef was so lean, I felt it wouldn’t hurt to have the extra fat. 
•	I used 2/3 traditional red salsa with about 1/3 salsa verde
•	I added three cloves of minced garlic, which the recipe does not call for and cooked that with the diced poblano peppers before adding the ground beef.
•	I had to buy a brand new jar of dried chipotle powder.   It is expensive!  I don't cook a lot with chipotle so not sure it was worth it.

I really enjoy this recipe. The chipotle with the pablano and corn bread is a great combination. If you don't have chipotle powder you can use some chipotle in adobo sauce from can, but not too much! And if you're trying to cut a few calories out of the recipe, I don't feel that the cheese in the top layer of corn bread adds all that much to the overall flavor of the dish.

I loved the idea of this recipe; corn bread and ground beef/salsa fillings are my favorite, but it was just okay as written. If I were to make it again, I would definitely add some seasoning, either chili powder or taco seasoning. The salsa alone didn't not add enough flavor. Since I like spicy food, I'd go with hot salsa, too; medium wasn't enough. I'd also add a can of black or pinto beans, and maybe some chopped red and/or green bell pepper. And maybe pepper jack cheese instead of Monterey. This was good, but could be really good with a few tweaks!

This was relatively easy and tasty. I added some cilantro and cumin. It is not necessary though to bake for as long as it states. I let mine bake for 45 mins and it was a little dry. I will not bake as long next time.

The first time I made it, I made NO changes (because you can't really rate a recipe if you've changed it). It was an EASY 5 stars.  The 2nd time I made it, I used ground turkey instead of beef, and a 7oz can of diced green chilis in place of the poblano peppers (since I had them on hand).  It was still absolutely delicious and my family has already requested it again...all four of them said they would eat this at LEAST once a week. We top it with a dab of sour cream, too. ;)  You really can't go wrong with this recipe. It's a definite family pleaser!!

This dish is one of my favorites, it's always a hit!  Every time I make it for a party people ask me to forward them the recipe!!!!  Someone here in the reviews said the poblano's didn't add enough flavor, I don't understand, they add so much flavor.  I like it spicy so I leave a few seeds in & I buy the hot salsa the recipe has you mix in to the meat mixture.  This recipe is packed with flavor!  Chef John is my favorite chef on this site!!!!!

This was a great dish to make because I already had everything on hand and I was surprised how good it was. Great recipe to make when your on a tight budget and your looking for something quick to make to fill your bellys.

I used hatch chili peppers instead of poblanos and a chunky style salsa. At first, it didn't appear to me that two cornbread mixes would be enough because the layers were so thin, but it filled in nicely upon baking. Really good.

Easy & yummy! I used some leftover shredded pork, skipped the salsa, and added taco seasoning and water instead (cheaper). Baked for less time - about 45 minutes. My 18-year-old son proclaimed it "magical"!

Followed this recipe except for the chipotle, as I do not like Chipotle. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical at first thinking this was not going to be very good, but I couldn't have been more wrong. This dish is fabulous. I did have to use Anaheim peppers since the market did not have poblano. But other than that it was very good, I think I might have used more peppers and spices than what it called for but this gave it a very good taste. Will make this gain

Loved this! So did everyone else in my family. I replaced the salt and chipotle peppers with two cubes of Knox chipotle bouillon, because that was what I had, and I also used canned corn, well drained. Still awesome!

Very good. There were some ingredients that I didn't have so I compromised .. I used a small 4oz can of green chilies, half of a 12oz jar of roasted red peppers, half of a 24 oz jar of salsa, canned corn instead of frozen and my homemade taco seasoning .. I also used all cheddar cheese.. Will make again but add some chopped onion, garlic and maybe even some black beans to the mixture .. served with refried beans on the side and tossed green salad

I loved the idea of it, but mine didn't turn out as well as I'd like.  It seemed the corn bread was too thin in this large of a dish, so it browned too quickly and made the ingredients dry.  I'm not a corn fan, so left that out, but might try a corn salsa or creamed corn in the bottom corn bread layer. Smaller dish and more experiments with the meat center.  I'd like to try it again.

Easy and delicious.  Added cumin, onion, used green bell pepper, jalapeño pepper, small can of diced chilies, bag of shredded Mexican mix cheese, added the frozen corn to the meat mixture.  It was a hit at the pot luck luncheon.

Whole family liked this recipe. Made a few simple changes but over all stayed with the basic recipe. Cornbread added a great taste to the Tamale Pie. We really liked it. If you like mexican food, you'll like this.

This came out really good! I couldn't find poblano peppers in the store, and since my boyfriend has a sensitive stomach anyway I ended up leaving them out. Still great, although I can see how the spice from the poblano peppers would have offset the sweetness of the cornbread a little better; I think next time I will add some serranos. I also did take it out of the oven about 10 minutes early and I'm glad I did - it was done and any longer would have completely dried it out. In any case, definitely a keeper!

I've been wanting to make it for a long time and finally got around to it. I did make a few changes because of the poblano peppers. I cook with them alot so I cooked those first along with the onions to ensure they were tender. I don't like chewing on onions or peppers if they are in my food. Then I added the meat and continued to cook everything, towards the end I added a small bunch of fresh chopped cilantro . I also used my own salsa recipe: 5slrings cilantro, 2 large tomatoes, 3 cloves garlic, 1tbs chx stock half onion 1 jalapeño boiled and blended. It made the meat taste more authentic and less ' Taco Bell '- but I'm Mexican- American so I know how to play with those flavores. I also added 2 tsp of canned chipotle juice instead of the dried stuff. My husband loved it and wants me to add it to the rotation. Oh! If you like a crunchy topped casserole, keep the cheese in the top mix, I like mine softer/ it's so I kept the cheese out and just sprinkled it under and over the meat then spread the jiffy over that.

I cut the recipie in half and baked in an 8 X 8 casserole dish, those were the only changes I made. It turned out so delicious and by using Chef John's techniques mine even looked presentable like his! This is such an easy recipie, watched the video a few times to give myself confidence that I could make it.  Thank you Chef John, I love your sense of humor about food!

One of the best new dishes I've made in a long time.  I did change 2 things though, I did not add the corn as that just didn't sound appetizing to me and instead of chipotle powder, I added about 3 whole canned chipotles- turned out awesome!

This recipe is a keeper.  I only added a little garlic and some red chili powder (we like spicy things).  Everyone at our group loved it.

Forgot the jar of salsa, the chippotle ground dried pepper was not able to located in the supermarket.
The corn, forgot to put it on top of the ground beef, any way it is on top of the corn muffin mix.
I found one box with the ingridients was too soupy, added another box and was much firm as it looked in the film.
Another smaller batch with the corn muffing mix, replaced with spinich, with beef chowmein from last night, tobasco sauce, onion salt.

I cut this recipe in half for just the two of us.  This was delicious and so easy to fix.  I did put the cheese on top of the meat mixture instead of in the cornbread topping.  I will try it with ground turkey the next time, and add a can of black beans with the meat mixture.

So disappointing! We thought it was dry and lacked flavor. Really easy but not something to get excited about at all.... Won't make this again.

This is very good. I cut it in half for our needs and bake it in an 8X8 pan. The cornbread batter will seem very thin but it rises well. The only change I made is to use Mexicorn now instead of fresh because it is easier to have on hand.

My biggest gripe with it is the Jiffy corn bread mix is too sweet for my taste in this recipe. I would have preferred the recipe on the back of a cornmeal box for this recipe. Still, not bad.

Que rico! I made this tonight for the first time and it was a hit with la familia! I made a few changes:
-Added fresh medium salsa to it
-Only added chopped Chipotle peppers and no other peppers
-Added black beans 
-Only used salt, pepper, garlic and cumin to the meat and I used chicken instead of beef

It was a winner in our house and I will definitely be making it again.

I did make some additions to the recipe. (Hopefully not too many. :) ) I added Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa, 2 cans of corn (undrained), 2 cans of pinto beans (drained and rinsed). I could not get poblano peppers, so I substituted anaheim peppers. I also added cumin, taco seasoning, chopped onion and minced garlic. I also cut the cooking time to 40 minutes at 350. It turned out very nicely...even my daughter liked it (she always complains of spicy food). Will definitely put this in the rotation.

I live abroad so having the muffin mix was no good, but I have a wonderful corn bread recipe I used instead. Corn bread with cheddar cheese in it was divine.

I made this because it looked like it was similar to what my mom made when we were kids, but her recipe was sweet, so this wasn't it. I can't really rate this fairly because I'm not sure I followed it exactly. I had chipotle chili powder, and I'm not sure if that's the same thing as just chipotle powder.  Also, since I halved the recipe, I skipped having the corn bread on the bottom, and just spread the mixture with the cheese over the meat mixture.  It only baked for about 25 minutes that way. Overall, it was much spicier than I would have liked, and it could have been that the chipotle chili powder wasn't the right spice. It had sort of a strange taste. Probably won't make again.

This recipe is so good!  I think roasting the poblano peppers & removing the skin prior to adding to the meat made a big difference in the flavor.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee and it was delicious!

This was a definite do again.  I took some other comments and added onion and used rotel.  I cut up jalapeno peppers.  Getting it into a bowl to eat my family added some salsa  and it really gave it a great flavor.  So easy and everybody loved it.

This was just okay. Nothing special. I halved the beef, and it was plenty. I only cooked it for 45 minutes and it came out pretty dry. Thankfully, I read other reviews and added tons of onion, garlic, and other spices to the beef. I also used my favorite spicy salsa, so it had a nice kick to it. But the crumbly-sweet cornbread was not style. If I tried this again I would make my own cornbread, with little or no sugar.

A burst of flavor...this was very good!!! My son and husband LOVED this. Not a fan of corn bread, so I divided the mixture between 2 double-crust pies and I doubled the corn and added extra cheese.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  I did modify the recipe in this way and found no difference in the quality or taste.  Instead of separating the cheeses, all the cheese can be added to the corn muffin mixes in one batch.  Then use half the batch for the bottom layer, and the remaining for the top layer.  The aroma and flavors are wonderful.  Add a salad, Spanish rice, or even a green bean casserole and this makes a great meal. Mimi

I had never had this before and I really loved it!  I made mine with ground turkey, some extra salsa, extra peppers, onions, and black beans with jalapeños.  I did not have the poblano peppers and it tasted just fine without, though I was happy that I went out and bought the dried chipotle pepper because it had a unique taste and added the heat that I wanted.  I did not add cheese to the cornbread, but just made a small layer in the meat.  I added two tablespoons of sugar to each of the Jiffy mixes because that is what tastes good to me (I can't stand plain cornbread for some reason).  

Since my hubby has GERD, I made his version different with just meat, kidney beans, and 1/2 cup of mayo in the middle, along with the corn and cheese.  He loved his as well!  We'll be having this again sometime soon!

This is so good!  I halved the recipe, subbed Rotel for salsa and poblano, used taco seasoning instead of ground chipotle, and baked in 2 bread loaf pans for 40 min (until corn bread began to brown).  I was very happy with the tasty results even though I forgot to throw some onions and garlic in with the browning meat as was my intention.

Great recipe! I used my immersion blender on the salsa and peppers before adding them to the meat. My kids don't like when they can see the chunks of peppers. I also added a little taco seasoning and they gobbled it right up.

This was a delicious recipe.  I did alter it some because it sounded like too much pepper heat to me.  I used bell pepper and cubed, pickled Jalapeno peppers and regular black pepper.  It was hot enough for my family and we loved it.

Great recipe. Fun to make. I added cilantro after spreading the meat. I doubled up on the cheese. Topped it with sour cream and avacado slices. A green salad on the side. Will make this again, for sure. Thanks Chef John.

Oh, this was a good meal! And the only thing I did different was to put jalapeno peppers in place of the plabano. It was Mexican comfort food to it's finest!

Delicious and so easy!! Only change was just because of supply, I used Cilantro instead of Chipolte.  This is a great quick supper. Also used picante sauce that was garlic and onion flavored.

This recipe was tasty and filling, which is what I look for in a quick meal, believe me.  The one thing I did change was that I added some jalapeno peppers along with the poblano.  I love the flavor of poblano, but we also like spice.  The jalapenos did the trick.  Very tasty and flavorful.

I've made this several times now and LOVE it, as do my husband and daughter. Great as is or change it up. Cut in half fits well in a 9" pie pan for 4-5 servings. I usually leave out the corn and add 1 1/2 cups or 1 can of drained kidney or black beans. Less cheese works fine, too. Tonight I'm trying it all vegetarian with lentils instead of the meat. Google recipes for make your own Jiffy corn bread so you don't have the processed corn. Can make extra filling and freeze it, set up your homemade corn bread mix, come home and throw it together and into the oven!

Awesome.  Softened chopped onion, push out to side of pan, brown ground beef on one side before breaking up meat and following Chef instructions.  Drained fat before step #4. Used garlic salt instead of salt.  As others have done, instead of Salsa I used one can Rotel Original (10 oz), and approximately 6 oz Rotel Hot. (Let the Rotel liquid reduce a bit before following the directions as written.) A nice blend of spices with just the right kick.  We are in Tamale Pie love. Thanks Chef John for a delicious dish!

Yum! Every year I look for new recipes to feed the guys during wheat harvest and this recipe will be added.  It's easy and pretty much a complete meal. Just add a salad and head out to the fields.  I did not have salsa so I also used a can of Rotel.  Had jalapenos from my garden and substituted those for the pablanos but used only three since they are much spicier than pablanos.  I had pepper jack cheese and that worked in place of plain monterey jack. Thanks for this yummy recipe.

At first I thought this recipe was too watery but when it's done you have something moist, heavy and very filling.  Warning!! this recipe is the kind of food that makes you want to eat more even when your full.  My family devoured this the two times I made it.  


I made this without the peppers as I had none and my 4yo doesn't like spicy food much, so I added a can of Hunts diced tomatoes with green pepper, added more cheese (about a handful, lol).  The second time I added peas, onion and diced green bell pepper for texture.  We are vegetable lovers here and I like to see a mixture of color on my plate.

I will try a vegetarian version of this as the little one isn't much of a fan of meat.

I modified this slightly using Hot Pico de Gallo instead of salsa, freshly shucked corn, no Chipotle and of course I roasted my poblanos. The recipe made MUCH more than my wife and I could eat for dinner plus leftovers. But as I ate the rest throughout the week without getting tired of it, I'd say it's pretty tasty. Making it again, I think I'll try 1/4 recipe.

Good easy recipe.  My husband loved it.  He said to mark it as a keeper!  I used a variety of peppers, not just poblano, Italian pepper being one of them.

My family loved this recipe.  The only changes that I made were to substitute ground chicken for the beef, and to sautee some garlic while the meat was cooking to add some flavor.  Very tasty new recipe to add to our rotation.  Thanks!

So easy to make. I loved this recipe because we made it our own. You can do any changes to it and still have it work out great. The only think I can say was that it took two boxes of cornbread mix to cover the top layer.

What a great recipe.  Easy to make and tastes great.  I came across the recipe in my daily email and thought it sounded great.  My wife is allergic to corn so I substituted Bush's chili beans instead.  Worked out ok.

This is really good!  The whole family loved it.  I like that you can hide veggies in here.  The mixture of tangy from the chiles combined with the sweetness of the cornbread was very good.

This is a great recipe. Adaptable. I halved everything and used a deep dish pie plate. It cooked in 30 minutes. I was out of corn. Used green pepper for poblano and added onion. My meat was precooked - leftover from another dish earlier this week - it was half chorizo and half beef. The corn bread added a sweetness, the chipotle pepper a smokiness and the chorizo a little spice. It was good and simple. We will make again - hope to have corn and poblano on hand - but this recipe is perfect for a wide variety of Tex-Mex type ingredients that you may have on hand.

Thank you Chef John for this simple but delicious recipe!  I couldn't find Monterey Jack cheese or ground dried chipotle pepper up north where I live, so ended up shredding Pepper Jack and using cyan (red) pepper.  Also added took the suggestion of adding the Taco Seasoning. It was great!  A can of diced chili peppers is a great substitute for the diced poblano peppers if you are in a hurry (or forget to put them in with the hamburger when it is browning - like I did.  Also, I mixed sour cream with salsa for a topping.  I made it for my parents and mom requested the recipe.  The next week they invited us over for supper and she had made it for us (and the relatives visiting from out of town)!  I think it is the new family favorite!

I did change a couple of ingredients to use what I had on hand.  I used a can of rotel and a small can of green chiles in place of the diced poblano peppers.  And I used 2% mexican blend cheese instead of the monterey and the cheddar.  This recipe was really good!  All my boys asked for this meal to be a regular.  My only comment on it is I thought the jiffy mix made it a little too sweet.  I think next time I will use mexican cornbread instead.

This recipe couldn't be easier to make and is great on the budget.  I made it exactly as called for except left off the olives because my teenagers don't like them and I left off the cheese to save the calories.  Even without these two items, it was still really great and it took no time to throw together.  We ate it with ketchup just as we eat our tamales.  We are actually Hispanic so I know that might sound odd, but it's totally normal for many Hispanic people to eat their tamales this way.  I served it with a side of green beans just to be sure we had some sort of vegetable.  The casserole itself is a protein and a starch so no need to serve it with anything else.  Next time I'll consider making refried beans.  Thanks for the post.  Great recipe and perfect for a busy night.

Used Pace Piquante for the salsa.  Pie was really hot but really good.

Definitely will make this again!  Has just enough "zip" without being too spicy -- drizzled just a little enchilada sauce over the top before serving

This is so good and I used a jar of the subway sandwich style pickles - could not find poblano. My husband can't get enough .....and I love it too!

This was a good recipe.  I made my own cornbread from scratch.  I also had sour cream on the side that really made it taste even better. I'm going to add a twist to it, but I would recommend this to others.

Made this as written but halved it and baked for 30 minutes instead of 50-60. Bottom was a little soft but top was perfect. Might try to cover with foil and cook a little longer. Used Herdez mild salsa which had plenty of flavor. I also sprinkled the meat mixture with a dash of granulated garlic at the last minute. You could spike it up by using medium or hot salsa. Very tasty without a lot of effort and easy enough for a weeknight dinner. Not 'to die for' but certainly a real keeper.

Totally a keeper; I didn't have ground dried chipotle pepper, so substituted something called "Mexicana", which is a blend of spices from New Zealand.  We also like to add sriracha hot chili sauce at the table, which really adds more depth to this dish.

Delicious!!!! We love it and I certainly will make this more often. I did at onions and garlic, and I could not find poblano peppers, so I took pasillas. It was delicious!!!! Thank you very much for posting this recipe!!!!

I loved the concept of this recipe. I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I had to improvise a bit. With the ground beef I sautéed onions, garlic, red & green peppers. I didn't have poblano peppers so I used about five or six squirts of sriracha hot chili sauce and a few dashes of cayenne pepper (we like it spicy). I had about a half of a tomato so I diced that up in it too. I didn't have salsa so I used about 1/2 cup of honey barbeque sauce to give a little moisture. I used mozzarella, shaved Parmesan, and mild cheddar because that is what I had. I assembled it as directed and drained off most of the fat rendered from the beef. I left some because I knew it would soak into the cornbread mixture. OMG this came out awesome! I had no leftovers! I'm gonna have to make it again because everyone was mad when it was done! Thanks Chef John for this fabulously easy and tasty recipe!

My family thought this was just OK.  I followed the recipe exactly and there was really nothing special about it.  I doubt that I'll try it again.

Made this for a potluck at church.  Was told I should only make THIS one from now on.  How about that?  It is delicious.
