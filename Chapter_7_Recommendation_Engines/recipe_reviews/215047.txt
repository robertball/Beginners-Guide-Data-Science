Since it's August, I substituted fresh tomatoes from the garden.  I diced the eggplant into 3/4" cubes, and it went over well with the family.  I also added a medium onion to give it a bit of added texture.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 an eggplant, and also 1/2 a zucchini, the two were great together. Instead of tomato paste, i used 1 cup of tomato/basil sauce (jar) with a bit of cream which I blended together. Overall, a very easy and delicious recipe!

pretty good, the recipe is vague on what size the "small pieces" of eggplant should be, the sauce is kind of bland, and tastes strongly of plain tomato sauce, but it was fast and used what we had on hand! next time i think i'll add some brown sugar and cayenne pepper to compensate for the tomato sauce flavour.

Very easy for my first time cooking eggplant.  I cut up the eggplant fairly small and though and it still took over 14 min to seem fully cooked.

Really yummy. I ended up making it a little different, but used this as my base recipe and it was really good. I just used jarred tomato basil sauce and diced sun dried tomatoes because that's what I had. Also added onion and zucchini. Delish!

Wonderful, quick, all the ingredients normally on hand. I did add 12 ounces of ground beef sauteed before adding the eggplant and garlic. Also used leftover brown rice instead of the pasta.

I have made this recipe a few times, almost exactly as written except for adding an onion and using chopped sundried tomatoes instead of a paste. I have to say it always takes me a lot longer than 5 minutes to make the eggplant soft. And you really do have to dice it finely to be able to cook it well in a pan; I guess that should have been obvious, but I had to learn from experience. Excellent pasta dish, I keep coming back to it! And yummy as leftovers.

We'll go back and make variations on this one! We used a jarred marinara sauce instead of the tomato called for, and added mushrooms. The end result was wonderful, especially topped with Parmesan.

This was just okay. I had higher expectations I guess. The eggplant was too tough after cooking it, maybe if you peel the skin and then cook it will be more tender? Also, this dish could def use some meat, I will use hamburger next time, it was just too plain.

Really a great recipe. I am an experienced cook. I fried the eggplant in 1/2 tablespoon oil only and stirred a few times to prevent sticking.  I could not find the sun dried  tomato spread and I used 'sun dried tomatoes in oil'  (small glass jar) instead. Tomato sauce replaced by tomato paste mixed with  1/4 cup  extra pasta water. The fresh basil is a nice touch. I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on the top.

I have to be on a heart healthy diet and this recipe has too much oil for me. I browned the eggplant and garlic in chicken broth, and drained whole sun dried tomatoes and processed them in a food processor. It came out DELICIOUS   Paired with my lentil-based pasta I’m good to go. My doctor would be proud.

Finally I can do something with the eggplant that’s always on sale near me. It was great! If you don’t like eggplant it’s not too strong, but the texture is there

Fresh eggplant and tomatoes from the garden.  Just made this and it is ready to plate up!  Delicious!  i did not have the sun-dried tomatoes soI  made a quick tomato sauce with the fresh tomatoes by cutting them in half and used my grater to "sauce them"  I even had fresh basil!  Wow this recipe is perfect.  I added a little  crushed red peppers and black olives to personalize it a bit.   Finish with grated parm. perfect summer dinner.

Used 1/3 eggplant and added 1 zucchini.  Otherwise, followed the recipe but sprinkled with shredded Parmesan at the end.

Fixed this recipe last night. I substituted Japanese eggplant (which are naturally smaller) and it worked wonderfully. I will make this again.

This was a great meatless meal. I had to make minor adjustments to utilize items on hand.  I used pesto instead of sun-dried tomato spread and whole wheat thin spaghetti instead of penne, added sauteed onions and bell peppers from the garden.  Excellent dish that will definately be made again.

I couldn't find sundried tomato spread, so I used chopped fresh tomatoes. And I added chopped onions and a little bit of red wine. We loved it! Delicious, and since I doubled the recipe, I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

Very tasty option for pasta. We love eggplant and can never find enough things to use it in. This is great!
