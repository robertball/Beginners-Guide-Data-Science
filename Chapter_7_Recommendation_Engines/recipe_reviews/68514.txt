Excellent recipe & its not very difficult to prepare. I doubled the amount of broccoli added about 1 tablespoon of Goya  seasoning salt, crushed red pepper and a lot more garlic to increase the flavor. Also instead of cream cheese I added low fat Greek yogurt to cut fat and increase protein. My husband loved this dish so much he ate the whole dish in 2 days!

This recipe was pretty good.  If I make it again, I will definitely add salt and pepper.  It was somewhat bland without it.

I just did not care for the idea of steamed onions.  I sauteed the onions in a small amount of olive oil with 1 clove garlic chopped and kept everything else as is.  I liked this as a nice alternative to the traditional green bean casserole we always serve at the holidays.

My daughter & her friends chose this recipe along with pork chops & surprised her dad & I with a candlelit dinner for two! This was a great casserole that I would have never tried if I hadn't been "gifted" with it. Now its one of our fav's!

Not bad, but the broccoli ends up being quite soft.  If  made it again, I think I'd maybe skip the steaming and/or bake it for less time.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2005 and it was very good and different. I made it exactly as the recipe says and I don't think I would change a thing when I make it again.

I read reviews before making.  The only thing I changed was instead of simmering onions in water I sauted in a little olive oil and fresh garlic and added salt and pepper before adding sauce to veggies.  This is amazing!!!!  I can't tell you enough how much we enjoyed this recipe.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  :)

I loved this.  And it was easy.  I used two 12oz steamer bags of broccoli.  Cooked them in the microwave.  I sliced one large onion and cooked that in the microwave with a couple of teaspoons of butter until tender.  Made the sauce as written except added 1 teaspoon of dry mustard and salt and pepper with the flour. The breadcrumbs and cheese made a nice crunchy topping. This all fit into a 7x11 pan.  Just because I had some, I sprinkled some sliced and toasted almonds on my serving. I am not a fan of the green bean casserole that is often served at Christmas.  I'm bringing this to the next holiday get together.

Very nice. I think a nice variation could incorporate little garlic as well. Maybe next time I will saute the onions in garlic rather than just boil them. A little cracked black pepper would be a nice addition to the sauce as well.

Made this for Easter, to rave reviews. I fried the onions in the butter. Did not pre-steam broccoli. Added half the cheddar to the sauce, sprinkled the rest on top. Used double the amount of panko bread crumbs. Baked until broccoli was tender, about 1 hour. Added 1/2 t salt, 1/4 pepper.

I think this would have been better if everything was mixed together instead of layered. I had two small heads of broccoli and used half a white onion. I still made all the sauce but only used half of it over the broccoli and didn't use 8 oz cheese just srpinkled enough on top to cover it. This was pretty good oh and I left off the topping.

I make this for holidays, and it always goes!  I half the amount of cream cheese (maybe I am not using big enough bunches of broccoli).  My mom especially likes it, and she is not a big broccoli fan.

I thought this was really good, but my husband came home and ate the rest of it! (That's his way of saying five stars!)  Made as directed, but my only opinion is that the broccoli and onion DO NOT need to be boiled, sauteed or anything else.  It cooks so long in the oven, the vegetables are perfect when they come out.  I think any additional cooking time makes them come out mushy.  Oh, I added garlic as well, because I can't make anything without it.  YUM!

This tasted like macaroni and cheese, if macaroni some how turned into vegetables. It's not the healthiest dish, but is really good and I could definitely see serving it for a holiday. I did change it and used a bag of frozen squash, a bag of frozen italian vegetable medley and a bag of frozen tri color peppers in place of the broccoli. It was so easy and yummy. I also saut√©ed the onions before hand instead of subjecting them to boiling. The sauce is a great base but is missing salt and seasoning! I added some Lawry's salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic powder as I cooked the sauce.

There are alot of foods that I will eat.  Really, I'm easy to please but this is my least favorite of all the dishes I have made from this site.  It's very bland, even with the S&P added to it.  The broccoli turned out mushy (even though I used fresh and steamed as directed).  I'm sorry but I won't be trying this one again.  Even the little ones didn't like it and it has cheese on top!

Quite b-l-a-n-d!!!! I'm not sure what type of flavoring this dish needs but I made this for a family gathering and the concensus was a rating of "so-so."  This is a great concept dish though and I may keep it around for future tweaking.

This was excellent and it is replacing the green bean casserole for this Christmas dinenr. 4 stars because I used the modifications of another reviewer: I sauteed onions in olive oil with 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 Tbs minced garlic.  This is a keeper. I couldn't stop eating it.

This recipe is delicious! Like others, I did make a few changes. I made it a lower carb meal by omitting the flour and bread crumbs. I also shredded an 8 oz block of PepperJack Cheese, rather than the cheddar, and added 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic powder.  This will definitely be a repeated recipe in my kitchen!

I HAVE to make this one every Christmas Day or nobody in the family would speak to me ever again. Instead of the 2 cups of milk though I use 1.5 cups cooking cream and 1/2 cup white wine and throw in a little garlic and onion powder for extra flavor. Because of the cream vs the milk I don't find the need to thicken with the butter and flour.

This was a hit with my husband.  I thought it was good, also, and will no doubt make it again. Like others, I saut√©ed the onions in a little olive oil instead of boiling them. I used half the amount of cream cheese ( because that's all I had) and I barely steamed the broccoli.   The broccoli turns out limp, but that's to be expected when it's baked for an hour. 
This would make a nice dish for a pot luck dinner.

I make this recipe, it is great but I changed it up, I usually double the recipe as it is a favorite of our family (especially 
My daughter who is 35 & this is the only way I could get her to
Eat broccoli since since she was 15). I add a 1/2 tsp of white pepper to the cream cheese sauce to give it a little kick. Some times I use half & half instead of milk.it makes it creamier, as
The broccoli holds water after you boil it. Then after I have the
Broccoli in a casserole dish & sprinkle the cheddar cheese on time.  I melt a tbsp or two of butter & sprinkle the bread crumbs in the melted butter & then add on top of the cheese.
This makes the bread crumbs come out more crunchy.
The other thing I do for a pot luck dish I add a cup or two of cooked chicken breast and mix in with the broccoli, cream cheese, let me tell you it sounds like a lot, but people go back for seconds & thirds.  As Mickey says TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT!

As written, 4 stars .  There were just a few tweeks with the method of preparation that I changed.  I don't like the idea of boiled onions so sauteed them in a little butter. Broccoli chopped small and did not parboil or blanch.  glad I didn't, as it was perfect consistency. Added 3/4 of the cheese to the dish itself rather than having it all sit on top. Didn't put the breadcrumbs on til the dish was uncovered during the second half of the baking and it was perfect.   Did add salt and pepper.  This sauce is very versatile and very rich tasting.  Loved the flavor of this dish, and can definitely see this being used with other vegetables as well, or preparing the sauce only with chicken breasts or shrimp and served over pasta.  Really nice recipe that I would definitely make again.  Makes a good amount for functions.  Great casserole dish for the holiday table, or a great potluck dish.  thanks for this very tasty recipe.

I followed this exactly except used a broccoli/cauliflower mix, and used chive & onion cream cheese per earlier reviews saying it was too bland.  I also didn't steam the veggies at all, the cooking time is more than enough and I know they would've been mushy if I'd steamed them first.  I thought there wasn't enough sauce- maybe next time I'll use less veggies?  It came out tasting very similar to plain steamed broccoli.  Its not necessarily bad, but definitely needs to be spiced up a little.  I'll probably try a different recipe before trying to fix this one.

Made this last night, and it was eh! Too much cream cheese and needs salt and pepper for flavor.  Broccoli was too mushy.  Don't think I'll make this again...

This was a good recipe.  There is only two of us so I cut the recipe down a bit.  Will use again.

I thought perhaps I would try this since it had good reviews...however, 3/4 of it went in the trash and everyone who tried it, didn't like it.  The broccoli was mushy and the entire dish was tasteless.  I won't be making this one again.  Save the ingredients and just steam your broccoli...

Had plenty of sauce.  Probably could add chicken and/or more veggies.  Used fat free cream cheese.  Probably would not miss cheddar on top, or could use half fat free cream cheese and half cheddar in sauce to cut down on the 18 grams of fat.

Onions were a little overpowering, may decrease it next time. But a great side dish for a holiday.
