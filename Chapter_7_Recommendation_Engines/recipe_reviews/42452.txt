I was looking for Reuben soup not Polish sausage soup. I'm sure your Polish sausage soup is good but this is false advertising. Why you are calling this Polish sausage soup Reuben soup is beyond me. Reuben soup has Corned beef in it, not Polish sausage. Please do not compare Polish sausage to Corned beef. That's like calling Prime rib, chicken.

Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe. The only things I changed is I diced my sausage (we like smaller pieces) and I browned the sausage with the onion in a little bit of olive oil before adding the other ingredients. My bf and I both loved it.

I used lite kielbasa and coleslaw mix (I removed the little carrot shreds so my husband wouldn't freak out -- not a carrot fan).  It was great to throw everything in the pot and ta-dah, soup in 15 minutes.  We forgot to add the swiss cheese the first time, and it was still tasty.  Good reheated also.

Very tasty. I used 2% milk instead of cream, added 1 Tablespoon of caraway seeds. Good way to use left-overs from St. Pat's Day.

This is a REALLY good soup! I left out the caraway and used turkey polish sausage, and it was perfect.  Made enough to serve about 5 people as the main course.  I will definitely make this again, but leave out the swiss cheese because it just clumped up on our spoons.

Quite tasty, especially for homemade soup that takes little more time than opening a can of the instant stuff! I used coleslaw mix to save even more time, and I believe the carrots and red cabbage further added to the flavor. Also used a spicy beef sausage with cheese and jalapenos - DH is a lover of hot. Resisted the urge to pre-saute the sausage and onions, which I think allowed all the flavors to fully meld in the broth.

Excellent tasting.  I left out the caraway seeds, though.  My daughter-in-law does not care for them.
