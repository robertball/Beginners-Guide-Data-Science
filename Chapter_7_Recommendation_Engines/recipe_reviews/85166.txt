I decided to try this because my husband is "Pennsylvania Dutch" and thought he might like to try it.  I LOVED IT, he HATED it and refused to eat it.  I made it as a "side" dish" and I ended up giving HIM the rest of my dinner and I ate his serving of the pie, along with my childrens servings!  

I still can't figure out WHY everyone at the table balked at it!!  I found it fantastic and actually had to FORCE myself to quit eating it because it just tasted so darn good!

Next time I make this (and I guess I would be making it for myself only) I plan on adding the chicken and just having that as a meal!

I gave this a five star rating, but I think this is one of those recipes that people will either LOVE... or HATE.

Ok, I’m sure I’m not the only person that when they first saw this recipe said to themselves.  Corn…pie…corn…pie…Corn Pie???  You have to admit, the words corn and pie usually don’t go together, until now!  This was great and I can’t wait to make it again so I can add chicken like it suggested some people do.  I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised recipes like this coming from Amish country, simple, hearty and delicious.  After all, among so many other wonderful things, they gave us buttermilk pie…hey wait a minute…

Good!  I made this exactly according to the recipe and it turned out yummy.  I'll tweak it a little next time I make it by adding more potato (my favorite part of the pie) as well as some spices (garlic, onion powder, parsley) as it was kind of plain.  But, it was definitely a success as written.  My only complaint was that when I added the hot filling to the pie crust, the crusts became very soft and hard to work with.  I poked through about 5 times while I was trying to seal the edges.  It would probably be better to let the filling cool before adding it to the pie crust, but it's already a recipe that takes a long time so I doubt I'll ever want to wait.  It didn't affect the taste, the pie just didn't look as good as a pie normally does because of all the leaky points around the edges.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!  I was just telling someone about corn pie 2 days ago!  They never heard of it and they're from PA. My grandma was a cook in Akron PA and made this all the time. Only difference is hers only had crust on top, she didn't use creamed corn and she put in some saffron. I am so making this!

Great recipe! Very easy. I only gave it 4 stars because I think the bake time is too long. I followed the recipe instructions using a ready made pie dough and the crust was really dark brown when the timer went off. I'll reduce the baking time next time I make this.

This was good. I stuck to the original recipe, and was quite pleased. I liked the sweetness of the pie crust, but it's a little too much crust (especially when reheating for leftovers). Next time I'll try it with more filling and just the top crust.

When I came across this recipe, I just had to make it. I am Pa. Dutch and my Nana used to make this.
This is excellent! She used to put chopped parsley in it. I tried it with the chicken too, so good. For the chicken I had to add a little more milk.The sweetness of the corn with the crust, just goes together so well. You have to try this with fresh sweet corn, also really good.Thanks for this recipe!

I chose this recipe because my husband is Pennsyvania Dutch and I am always looking for things to cook for him to remind him of home. He enjoyed this as did the rest of my family. It was very tasty. I followed the recipe as written. It was easy to make also.

Corn pie was always a favorite of mine growing up - never tried with a can of creamed corn - it was very good - the kids love it as well.

I'm from Central PA and grew up on corn pie and LOVE it!!  I've learned to make it from my grandma without the creamed corn and only a top crust.  Everything else is spot on.  I cringe at reading some of these reviews.  People, apparently not PA Dutch, adding celery, onion, bacon, cheese, sage, garlic.......OMG!!!!!!!  Why review a dish if so many changes are made.  Please don't ruin our Pennsylvania heritage!

I just moved to Pennsylvania from New York and when I saw this dish at a fair I immediately thought I wouldn't like it - but I was wrong! This version is deliscious and tastes just like the one I had at the fair.

This is very good. I used fresh corn since it was in season. You need about 6-8 ears of corn cut off cob. Take about 1/3 of the corn and put in blender to make cream corn. Also added a pinch of parsley to add a little color. You can also heat a little milk to put over each serving after it is done if you like more juice

While this is not bland, it is not full of flavor either. Although I like hard boiled eggs, their flavor did not blend with the rest of the ingredients.  This might be a once-a-year dish, definitely not a staple.

Something different for our family.  This was a good and unusual way to eat your vegetables.  We liked it, but thought it lacked celery and onions.  Need to go heavy handed when adding the pepper.  It baked up nicely and served well without falling apart.  Most definitely best when eaten the first time as the crust is not as good the next day.  Thanks Imlizard for sharing a Pennsylvania treat.  My husband has family there and that is why I chose your recipe.

Coming from Reading,PA and growing up on corn pie I found this recipe excellent. I did double the ingredients and used a bigger pan, then I put both crusts on top and none on bottom. I added chicken and also made it without. I was excellent both ways.

We live in the heart of "PA Dutch Country" and this recipe was perfect!  Spot on -- exactly like my great grandmother, my grandmother, my mother used to make.  I will now proudly pass this recipe on to my daughter.  Thanks for sharing!

My Dad is PA Dutch as well. He use to make this for us a lot when we were kids. He is now passed and I'm making it this year at our Christmas Eve get together. He only put crust on the top. It was absolutely fantastic! I would recommend this to everyone! Merry Christmas everyone!!

This is almost exactly how my Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother made corn pie - she didn't use a bottom crust, didn't use creamed corn, and mixed some crumbled saltine crackers in with the filling.  Otherwise, it's right on the nose and I love it!  To me it's not bland - true flavors of corn, potatoes and eggs come through.  Hearty, filling and delicious!

Coming from Lancaster, PA...I'm very familiar with corn pie, my husband however was not. He requested corn chowder and I figured I'd do him one better. It's such a great summer meal when served with a nice green salad topped with sweet & sour dressing. Next time I will be adding some celery and onion as well as just having a single crust to top it. Thank you IMLIZARD for posting this recipe, can't wait for corn season to get into full swing!

This is wonderful. I've made it as the recipe is here, and with chicken. My son liked it better with chicken. The taste is just incredible. Just because it sounds weird, don't knock it. It's amazing!

This recipe was okay.  Maybe if you grew up loving this, it would make a difference.  It just seemed to be lacking something.

I made this for my nephew’s birthday - he’s from PA & had grandparents from Lancaster County & grew up eating his grandmother’s Pennsylvania Dutch dishes. This was one of his favorites dishes, so I decided to give it a try.  He said it was just like he remembers, so I’m calling it a success!  So happy I found this recipe!  Thank you!

Very good base recipe.  I am PA Dutch and have enjoyed corn pie every summer since the 1960's.   First, try and use FRESH corn, it makes a huge flavor improvement.  I just cut the corn off 4 or 5 cobs and mix it with cooked potato, hard boiled eggs, butter and milk.  I do not cook the filling ~ after all it's being baked.  My favorite seasonings are 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. chicken bullion powder, 1/2 tsp celery salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.   Yummy favorite!

Living Pa Dutch Country we have always made this but using fresh corn from the cob when in season. I also has a little onion. And to top it off after it is baked we warm some milk with a little butter to pour over our individual servings.

I looked this recipe up to figure out how long to bake mine, ingredients were exactly the same. Only difference is I don’t put everything together in a pan and heat it up first. I layer mine in the pie pan by the bottom crust, potatoes, salt-and-pepper,, add the corn, cut up the hard-boiled eggs Top with creamed corn and a few slices of butter an add top crust.   My family also uses the juice from the corn to make almost a gravy to put on top afterwards by using the corn juice, milk, butter, salt pepper. Very very good!

When I was a child, my mother made Corn Pie.  I loved it! She died when I was ten, and so I didn't know how she made it. I'm finding that if I do searches on All Recipes, I am sometimes fortunate enough to find recipes that taste much like those I remember.  This for Corn Pie tastes muich like I remember.  I freeze my own sweet corn, so instead of using the cans of whole kernel corn and creamed corn, I used two quart bags of my own corn.  I added a bit of saffron and it tasted just like Mother's. When I find a recipe that tastes like hers, all kinds of wonderful memories come flooding back.  One small change I will make the next time -- instead of baking it for 30 minutes in the 425º pre-heated oven, I will bake it 20 minutes and then turn the oven down to 350º and continue baking for 20  min.  Mine got a little more brown than I would have liked, but was delicious, nevertheless.

I added a little more potato and one more hardball egg still this was very bland I even added more pepper and salt and paprika and still dish was to bland If anyone has come up with other seasons please let me know I have not been able to find a simple corn pie I also cut the time back because I have a conventional oven so the heat time on original recipe was to high  pie was very hearted but way to bland the other thing I did was I cooked the potatoes in some milk till they were denta drained put aside then mixed the corn and other ingredients in pot and cooked all together, then once potatoes were better cook poorer into crust . I will try again but need to know what other seasons would work

I added bite-sized chunks of chicken and about a half pound of diced bacon. The results were about as good as anything I've ever made...

With a little TLC (a little celery salt and a pinch of onion powder) this is the best corn pie recipe that I have found. I live in PA. near Lancaster and this tastes just as good as they make here. So try it and play around with it and trust me you will love it!

This is AMAZING. I live an was raised in East Central PA, right in Amish Country! I have heard of corn pie and but never had it... I was in the mood to try something different that was nice and hardy, and  would also please my husbands taste buds... This recipe was a winner! Between the two of us we ate 3/4 of the pie and then finished it off the next day for lunch. I made a few adjustments... 
1. I omitted the eggs... I just didn't feel like they were necessary.
2. I added chicken breasts... One good size breast is the right amount. I boiled and shredded it before I put together the filling.
3. I did 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup since I was adding chicken.
4. For some extra flavor I added 1 diced carrot, 1/2 of a chopped onion, and 2 large garlic cloves, minced. I also sprinkled in some ground sage, celery salt, and fresh parsley in addition to salt and pepper.

It was truly delicious and I will be adding it to the rotation!!

I did not try this recipe..because, my Grandmother's was only made with fresh corn..it was cut off the cob and then scraped to get the milky residue released  salt and pepper was added along with many pats of butter and a little half&Half ..this was always a summer dish and was served with great sliced tomatoes ,,it was the main dish.

Husband and 8 year old both said it was delicious!  I grew up eating this and always loved it.  I only had to bake it for 30 minutes.  The corn was a little too cooked at that point, but the potatoes were done perfectly.  Crust browned nicely.  Will definitely make again, especially on a cold night!

Very good! The only thing I did different is used real corn (that was in the freezer from the summer) instead of canned corn. I think that just gives it a great taste!! Very Very good!!

Very Good. Because I couldn't find proper ready-to-use pie crust, I used filo instead. Worked well. I also used 2 potatos instead of 1.

It sounded good but didnt have flavor at all and I even added garlic and onion. Used puffed pastry for the top seeing I was in a rush and didnt have time to make crust.
