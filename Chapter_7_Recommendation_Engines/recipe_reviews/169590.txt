Yum! Make sure you rinse the quinoa before you cook it. I sauteed the veggies for 3 1/2 minutes, instead of 7. I didn't want them too over cooked. I didn't use sage, and I'm glad I didn't. Use some chicken thighs with this, it really makes a tastier dish. I cooked the chicken in veggie stock, saved the remaining liquid after they were done, and drizzled it into the pilaf with the chicken for the last step. It helped incorporate the chicken flavor through out, instead of just pilaf with some chicken stirred in. I did reduce it to 2 carrots instead of 3, and didn't notice a carrot shortage at all. I find that an initial rinse of quinoa in a pour spout measuring cup, then pouring it into a cheese cloth, making like a tennis ball shape with it, works fantasticly. Then I can strain it and squeeze it right under the water, it's very quick and effective. (I don't have a mesh screen) Just add a little more quinoa, to make up for what gets stuck in the cloth. Next time I'm going to add some curry, or maybe some coconut milk.

Yum! This recipe was a real winner!  I made it with olive oil instead of coconut, added sliced garlic, had only two carrots and omitted the chicken.  It was hearty and flavourful.  Next time I will try it with chicken.

Exceptional for Quinoa! I'm not a huge fan of quinoa, but I like making it because it's extremely healthy for you. But, this is very tasty and my kids liked it too. I didn't use it as my main dish and I had to make a few changes. I didn't have any fresh celery so I used celery flakes. And I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I used Poultry seasoning. It was very good. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

I used light coconut milk and water instead of chicken broth. Added about 1 tsp of curry powder and a glove of garlic. Fantastic! Next time will add some coriander and/or cumin.

This was so good! Like another reviewer, I'm a vegetarian and my husband loves chicken. I made the recipe as listed except that I didn't have celery so I subbed a little celery salt and I used mixed French herbs instead of Italian seasoning.  At the end I put in cooked finely chopped chicken breast for hubby and the kids and chick peas for myself. It was so good, everyone ate it all up and I have a very fussy family.  As a side note, coconut oil does not provide much flavor, I use it as a healthier alternative to vegetable oil when I don't want that bitterness that olive oil can add.

I don't have coconut oil, so I just used canola oil.  I also did not add the celery, but did throw in some diced zucchini when I added the chicken.  This recipe was great tasting and healthy.  You could really add a variety of veggies to your own preference.  Will definitely make again - it makes a great weeknight dinner.

Thank you! I am a vegetarian and my husband does not believe a meal is complete without meat. This was a great recipe for us. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Then, when the recipe called for meat, I split the dish in two - adding turkey to his portion and edamame to mine. Everyone was satisfied. Even my son who is just starting with table food liked this. : ) One other note - I did not have coconut oil so I used a citrus flavored olive oil - still great.

The flavors just weren't right for me. Sorry. The coconut oil is an odd addition, and I didn't care for it in this.

I've had some success, but more failures, cooking with quinoa.  This was the BEST quinoa recipe I've tried so far!  I replaced the coconut oil with olive oil, the onion with red onion, the celery with asparagus, and the fresh sage with dried sage.  This was really tasty, and the picky men in my family actually liked it!!! This recipe could be easily used for a couple made up of a vegitarian and a carnivore, as the chicken could be thrown in at the last minute for the carnivore!

This was very tasty! Everyone in my house loved it, including my picky 7 yr old and father in law. My husband packed it for lunch and he said everyone kept complimenting the appearance and smell. I did not have fresh sage, I used ground sage. Before I realized I had that ground sage I had added thyme and rosemary as a substitute. Oh and I used olive oil since I had no coconut oil. We made this 2 weeks ago and we are making again today , but I will add more veggies. I would recommend this recipe!

This is good, though next time I'd add a bit more celery and stick with 3 carrots (2 wasn't enough for me). I didn't taste the coconut oil at all as one of the reviewers did- I did add a bit of soy sauce for added flavor though.

Vegetarians can also enjoy this dish. Just sub veg stock for chicken. Once quinoa is cooked separate into two dishes so chicken can be added to one dish and the other, you can add whatever meat substitute you wish. I took on the suggestion of another reviewer and added chick peas to mine. Yum!

I liked this recipe and I'm new at quinoa.  I did add garlic powder, deleted the sage and replaced a bit of the water with cream of chicken soup (not condensed) while slightly increasing liquid to 2 1/4.  Speaking as someone who is trying to like quinoa and hasn't fallen in love with previous recipes, this is one my teens and I would eat again.  I was creamy like a risotto.

I made this tonight in my Instant Pot. Sauteed the veggies for 2 minutes, added quinoa, broth and spices, sealed the lid, cooked for 2 minutes on high pressure, did a natural release and then added the chicken. Everyone liked it! It's a keeper!

My husband put a little salt on the final product and said I don't know what you did to this but you made quinoa that I actually enjoy.  I kept the shredded chicken on the side and used dried sage.  A keeper!

As a vegan, I made a few changes to this recipe and prepared my chicken on the side for the meat eaters in my house.  I diced some mushrooms and added that to the veg along with some garlic before I added vegetable stock and a little salt and pepper.  This dish got rave reviews!

Substituted the coconut oil for canola oil, but added 2 Tbsp coconut milk with the broth.  Did not have Italian seasoning, so I used 11/2 tsp dried thyme, 1/4 tsp dried rosemary, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Also, added the chicken before the long cooking period so it could absorb the herbs.  Nice stew-type texture.  Quinoa was helpful with my iron deficiency.

This was easy to make and pretty tasty. I'm giving it four stars because I really liked it but I didn't love it. My only thought is that I wish I would have read the reviews first. The sage was very overpowering so next time I will put in about 1/4 of what is called for.  And if that's too much, do what others have done - none at all. Good way to use up my leftover chicken from last night!!

The taste was amazing! I didn't have sage so I didn't use that, I seasoned with oregano, parsley, a little thyme and salt and pepper. I doubled it because I was a lot of mouths to feed but it was amazing and everyone loved it! Great gluten free/ dairy free recipe!

Everyone really liked this, including my 11 year old son. It reminded me of chicken and rice soup in its flavor. Didn't have any cocout oil, so I subbed olive oil. I did add a little minced garlic to the veggies after they had cooked a bit, and I added the chicken to the pot with the quinoa. May try adding a little stir-fried veggies after everything cooks. I missed a little crunch and the brighter colors, as the veggies had all cooked down. Thanks for a great recipe with many possibilities!

This was so delicious! My husband and I are on a cleanse which restricts many food items such as sugar, vinegar, dairy and wheat.  We brought it to our church potluck so there would be something we could eat, and everyone else enjoyed it too!

My 3 boys and hubby really liked this one.  Everyone voted on 4 stars. Would love to try with the addition of asparagus next time. I think any meat would go well.
 I doubled the batch for our family.  We have a little left over, but I know it will disappear after school today.  It is recommended to rinse your quinoa before making it.  Also, don't use too much oil or butter....it doesn't absorb well.

I personally thought the sage was an awful flavor to have in this dish. I added a ton of garlic and also some red pepper, per other review.  That helped immensely.

After reading the reviews I was afraid it might be bland so I omitted the Italian seasoning and sage and replaced with a citrus seasoning and then added a can of drained mandarin oranges when I added the chicken.  My family really enjoyed this and we even had my son's friend who ended up staying and eating with us and asked how to make it.  Will definitely make this again

I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception being that I used red quinoa rather than white. I love quinoa; however, I find this dish to be very bland. It's edible but not appetizing. I'll eat it this time to not waste the food, but I will not make this again.

I really liked this!  I had to use dried sage, because that is what I had on hand.  I can’t wait to try it with fresh, next time.  The only thing I changed was to add some white wine in at the end.  I felt it needed some acid to balance the flavors.

I made this recipe using couscous (I had no quinoa) and followed the tip of adding extra of the veggies plus I added some cayenne pepper for a good kick. The whole family loved it and want me to make it again. (My husband took some for lunch to work and my 16yo daughter took some for lunch to school)

Favorite in our house! Water sautéed the vegetables and skipped the chicken now that my family eats WFPB and the flavors are just as great as before when we made it as written. Thank you!

I made this in my Instant Pot. I sautéed the veggies on sauté function, then added the stock, quinoa and chicken and spices. I reduced the stock to 1 1/4 cups then cooked on the rice function with natural release...it was wonderful, fluffy and tasty.

My picky kids love Quinoa and this was a hit! They picked out the celery but my husband and I liked it. I think I'll add more variety of veggies next time though.

Not a big fan of quinoa, but this was the best one I've tried involving quinoa. Wife and I both liked it, even kids said it was good (son was lukewarm in his praise - said he "didn't NOT like it"). Next time will try adding scrambled eggs. All in all, a good meal - we'll make it again!

Didn't change a thing. Used a food processor to chop up the veggies and set aside some to use for chicken noodle soup another night this week. Extremely delicious flavor!

This was interesting; it reminded me of Thanksgiving, but my chicken broth was also infused with rosemary, thyme, and white wine, so that might be part of it. I had to tweak with what I had on hand, so I used olive oil, left out the celery and sage. I used it as a side for grilled chicken, so I didn't add any chicken. Overall I found the variety of flavors overwhelming (but again that might be due to the fancy chicken broth), and I prefer my Mediterranean-style quinoa salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, and feta with a red wine vinegar dressing).

This recipe is sumptuous! Like many of the other reviewers, I did not have coconut oil so I substituted olive oil.  It made so much we had it the next day too! Warning: It dries out a bit in the fridge, so I added some water to it when I warmed it back up. Still delicious! This recipe even works with fried tofu in it.

This was my first time trying quinoa.  I was very skeptical because I heard the texture is weird.  But I really liked it.  I rinsed it like someone else else said.  I also added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and only 1 tbl of coconut oil, which was plenty to sauté the veggies in.

OMG! So Fast! So Easy! So Delicious! Had all the ingredients on hand. My only switch was instead of Italian seasoning I used a tablespoon of Monterrey Chicken Grill Seasoning. Husband & 3 boys raved over it. My only complaint would be there were no leftovers!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I'm trying to find good recipes for quinoa because I don't like it plain (and I bought a bag at Costco so I have a lot of it). I used ground sage and added extra shredded chicken because I had a lot leftover from a previous meal.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This was so delicious! The only changes I made was using olive oil instead of coconut oil, and I added some sliced jalapenos from a jar with a little bit of the jalapeno juice along with the chicken just to give it some kick!! Soooo good, my husband loved it!!Definitely will be making again!

Delicious!  My kids and I loved it!
I used ghee instead of coconut oil and 1/2 tsp. dried sage instead of 2 tsp. fresh (I doubled the recipe).
I threw in the chicken with the quinoa so it could soak up some extra flavor.
Definitely one I will make again!

Really liked this.  Used dried rubbed sage and added a little lite coconut milk at the end as others suggested.  Will definitely make again.  If you've been wanting to try quinoa but are afraid - try this recipe!

This is very good! It's also easy to adapt to any lifestyle (like vegetarian or gluten-free ect) or vegetable additions! My 3 year old even liked it! Oh, and to cook the chicken, I had large chicken breasts, so I just used a small glass casserole dish and put some chicken broth in it with the chicken and baked on 375 for about 30 minutes for flavorful, moist chicken to add in.

My family thought this was very good. I did skip the sage as I don't really care for it. I also added green beans, using up what I had. Very yummy. My hubby and 4 year old thought it was great. Quinoa is becoming a staple in my house.

This dish was ok, but I dont think I will make it again.  It was a little bland and boring for me.  I didnt have italian seasoning so I used poultry seasoning as someone recommended.  I also eliminate the carrots and added mushrooms, since that is what I had.  I rinsed the quinoa prior to cooking but Im not sure what difference that made, if any.

Good flavor.  I used green onions instead of a regular onion.
