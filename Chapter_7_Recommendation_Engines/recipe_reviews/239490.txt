These are sooo good! I used a regular waffle iron (not Belgian), and the pancakes came out perfect--nice and fluffy. I've never whipped eggs in order to make waffle batter but it works and made the batter very light and airy. These will be on my fall menu for a long time!

These waffles were delicious!  Fluffy inside, and a little bit crispy on the outside.  We didn't have the individual spices, so used 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead.

I made these with some fresh puree I had in made previous in the week. Turned out to be a great recipe and made a lot of waffles. Froze several on a flat pan in the freezer with wax paper in between.

These were good but they didn't knock me over with their pumpkin flavor. I used 1T pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices. I'll try to stick to the recipe next time. Very light and fluffy!

I have been on a waffle kick all week. I tried gingerbread and apple cinnamon waffles, which were both good, before looking for a pumpkin recipe. This one is by far the best! I prepared the recipe exactly as is, and it is exactly what the submitter calls it--PERFECT.

I used the Cuisanart belgian waffle maker and cooked them at level 5 to get the perfect crispiness. I doubled it and it made 24 waffles. I recommend shifting your brown sugar with the dry before adding to the wet. I used pumpkin pie spice and added around 3 TBSP. I also added one teaspoon of extra ginger. I add enough spice so that I can clearly see it to know if it is enough. I like that these are not sweet despite the 1/3 cup of brown sugar added. We add caramel, Nutella, chocolate sauce and other toppings so extra sugar inside is not needed. 

You can reheat these later in your toaster. They are the perfect consistency for the batter, tender and fluffy inside like others have said. 

Make them into PB&J sandwiches the next day!

This is SUCH a great recipe. Love them. I always use my whole wheat flour for 1/2 the amount, this time for fun added 1/4 cup ooconut flour and 1/4 cup oat flour.....you can follow 100% or have fun and they always are GREAT. This time, I also used 3 tsp of cream of tartar to make my almond milk more like buttermilk.  Enjoy. (Of course nuts on top takes them over the top)

I substituted 3teaspoons pumpkin spice for the other spices, but should have added a bit more. Such fluffy waffles and lots of leftovers which we love.

These are some of the best waffles I’ve ever eaten, both fresh from the waffle iron and fresh from the toaster with a bit of warm syrup. Thanks for sharing this recipe of these wonderful waffles.

Made almost exact, but I have a large container of pumpkin pie spice that I wanted to get used up, so did 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice and 2 teaspoons cinnamon.  All the rest I kept the same.  Waffles took only 3 min. to cook in my waffle maker (I have a light that goes off when it is done).  I used a full 1/3 cup per waffle square (4 squares in my maker), and it made 16 square waffles.  Whole family gave it 5 stars.

Made recipe as written and was excellent! My kids and I thought it could use a little more sugar, so next time I would increase that to 1/2 cup. I always use whole wheat pastry flour (not the same as whole wheat flour!!) instead of all purpose for breakfast recipes. You can sub this for all purpose flour with no other changes and exactly the same result in recipes. My kids eat a lot of waffles and pancakes, so this makes me feel like they are getting a little more nutrition than dessert. This made 7 waffles in my Cuisinart Belgian waffle maker. Extras freeze well (between wax paper) and can be heated in toaster for a quick school/work day treat!

These are delicious! The batter is reasonably thick, so we never quite got round waffles, but that doesn't take away from the taste. Very fluffy, if you're looking for crisp on the outside, you may need to put it in a skillet with some butter after cooking.

I made this because had a cup of leftover mashed sweet potato.  I used that instead of the pumpkin.  It was good.  Not really sure what benefit I got from separating an beating the egg whites.  Seemed unnecessary.

The first batch was so-so but continued to get better as we went along. Next time we are definitely using some pumpkin pie spice as they overall tasted like bland pumpkin pie.

5+ stars!  I made these waffles exactly as directed and they were wonderful!  Just the right amount of spices and a wonderful fluffiness/density....so good with pure maple syrup, of course!  I like to sprinkle a few toasted, chopped walnuts or pecans in the batter also.  Love these!

The batter was a little too thick so I had to thin it out some, but the flavor was great! Topped them with cinnamon applesauce, maple syrup, whipped cream, and toasted pecans. Dessert for breakfast isn't always bad!

I used an egg substitute due to an egg allergy and substituted milk and vinegar for buttermilk since I didn't have any.  The waffles were great, this recipe offers a depth of flavor that most do not since it uses ginger and cloves.

Oh, my goodness!!! These were delicious!! I was craving pumpkin waffles and these satisfied my craving. The ones that I had before came from a mix. I didn't have any buttermilk so I substituted sour cream and milk and they came out perfect. I will definitely make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly. The waffles were light and fluffy, and perfectly spiced. Everybody loved them! I used a Belgian waffle maker, and the recipe made 9 waffles.
