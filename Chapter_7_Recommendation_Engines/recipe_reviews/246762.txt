BEAR IN MIND I AM NEW TO COOKING, MY WIFE JUST PASSED. The recipe was easy to follow, especially since i measured everything out and set items in order to be sure I did not omit.  the taste was excellent.  The issue I had with it was the sauce sort of separated, I had the white  sauce, but the butter sort of came out of suspension.  As noted .. tasted fine and likely to try again.

Easy to make. Boyfriend liked it and said he would eat it again if I made it. Only differences I did was did not have fettuccine so used spaghetti (I know-not a big deal). Also did not add onions due to allergy. We had about a pound of shrimp that was not peeled or deveined and used that--not sure how much it was (weight) after the peeling.  I kind of switched around the put this into that and fold this into that as it was easier with the pots and pans and bowls that were being used.  Added some garlic bread and salad. Overall a good dinner.   Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is above restaurant quality.  Best meal I have made in a while.  From now on, when I get a craving for alfredo, I will skip red lobster and go straight to the grocery store!

I used about a quarter of a large onion instead of the whole onion and used minced garlic instead of fresh but was it tasted just as good. I also added fresh crab for more flavor. I broke the fettuccine noodles in half before boiling and only used about half the serving the recipe called for.

I doubled the shrimp and added a few cups of sweet corn.  All I had was parmigiano cheese so that's what I used.  It turned out great.  The kids destroyed plate after plate.

I followed this recipe with only a couple changes...extra cheese and extra garlic, and a little less butter.  This was the best tasting alfredo I have ever had!! A keeper for sure, thanks to the person who shared it!! Yum yum :)

Love love loved it!  I used 1 1/4 c Romano/Parmesan mixture instead of  separately because that's all the Romano cheese the store had at the time.  I also added ~1 1/2 c broccoli in addition to the shrimp and mushrooms because I always ask for broccoli in the restaurants as my personal preference.   It was DELICIOUS and my family loved it too! Its a keeper for sure. The cream sauce was just the way I like it. It surely tasted like we were eating out at a restaurant. Served with parmesan cheese bread.   Thank you for a great recipe!

Deee liscous!!!!!   Easy to make.  Picked this recipe over another which called for bottled alfredo sauce.  The whole reason for home cooked is to control what's in my food.  Added no salt, my husband has kidney desease, other then that all was the same.  Loved it, thanks for the recipe.

Excellent - made as written except only used Parmesan - I had i very nice block I wanted to use.  And I used fresh shrimp. I always use white pepper in white / cheese sauces - I think it adds a little something. Thank you for great meal!

I find shrimp are too chewy if left in that long really can throw everything together and then the last few minutes the shrimp as I used thawed cooked shrimp. Otherwise amazing!

I loved it! To try to cut some calories...I used a little less butter, and half the cheese, and used 1% milk with flour instead of heavy cream. 
Would definitely make again!

I made as written.  I thought it was good but lacked something.  Heating up leftovers, I figured it out, if you add 1/2 cup dry Marsala wine to the sauce it really gives it a good flavor.  This will thin out the sauce so make a slurry with cornstarch and water.  One tablespoon of cornstarch for every cup of liquid you want to thicken.  Mix equal parts cornstarch and water, whisk together and add to the sauce and simmer.  This recipe makes a lot.  It needs more shrimp than the recipe calls for and I would double the mushrooms for my taste.  I would make it again.

Changed it slightly due to lack of ingredients. Used no.4 spaghetti pasta and made a rue instead of whipping cream and turned out good.

I made this pretty much according to the directions and it was delicious!  My family loved it!  The sauce was very creamy and not overpowered with the cheeses or garlic.  I am definitely going to make this again.

Thank you for this simple, delicious recipe! It's definitely a keeper.  I halved the recipe and, sinfully, doubled the shrimp.  Yummy!

It was very good.  I cut 1/4 cup of butter out of the recipe.  I used 1 1/4 in the sauce and the other 1/4 with the onions, mushrooms and shrimp,  I also didn't have any Romano Cheese so I used about 3/4 cup Parmesan and about 1/2 cup of a 6 Cheese Italian blend and it worked out great.

Very simple to make, yet completely from scratch. Made it exactly as writ, save I used pasta zero from the produce section of my supermarket. very delicious definite keeper.
