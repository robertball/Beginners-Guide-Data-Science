Delicious combination! I used a 9 x 13 dish and it was the perfect size. Brownies weren't too thick and came out soft and moist.

a creamy chocolate dream.  i only had a 8x8 pan which caused the brownies to be a tad thicker than i like.  if you can, use the 9x9 pan.  i also subbed heavy cream for the milk because i needed to use it up.  when performing the marble technique, do not be afraid to glob the cream cheese mixture on top of the chocolate mixture and spoon the chocolate overtop the cream cheese.  i tended to swirl the two, which didn't quite achieve the expected marble effect all the way through the brownie.  excellent taste -- not too sweet!

This is a delicious recipe that turns out marvelously when you follow the directions as listed. But I've found I like it a little different, too... Brownie batter: I subbed milk chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate, added a tbsp of Hershey's special dark cocoa powder for a richer flavor, and used 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4c white sugar instead of all white sugar. Cream cheese: I added 1/2tsp of almond extract. It turns out wonderfully either way, and I'm sure there are even more ways to "tweak" the recipe that will be great, too.

these were yummy and only lasted two days in our house... i used 44% dark chocolate instead of the 60% and they turned out fine however i found that the 9inch square baking tray is too small for the mixture... the brownie came out thick which was very nice but the bottom part ended up being slightly burnt in the process of cooking... which took about 40mins... all in all... i would definately make these again.

I doubled the recipe but put it in a 8x12 pan and it didn't really work out so good, they were too cooked on the outside and too raw on the inside. but the flavor was nice, thanks for the recipe

These are fantastic.  A big hit with friends, family & co-workers.  I added peanut butter to the cream cheese mixture for "peanut butter cream cheese marbled brownies".  Huge success!  Would definately recommend to others.

I made these for a Christmas Party and everyone loved them. I doubled the recipe. I would maybe add more cream cheese to the cheese mixture. I didn't get it to  swirl all the way through. Also, when making twice as much, I would reduce the number of eggs. Overall a good recipe. Will make this again.
