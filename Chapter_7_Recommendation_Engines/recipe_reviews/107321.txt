We do this as well and love it, but we call them "pie irons".  We trim off any extra bread that's sticking out and make sure it's closed completely and your bread is sealed together.  We do many variations though including using cherry, peach or blueberry pie filling; peanut butter, marshmallow and chocolate chips (or a piece of Hershey's chocolate bar); we also love the pizza ones we make with pizza sauce, pepperoni and mozzarella cheese (you can also add green pepper, mushrooms, onion or whatever you like on your pizza).  It also makes a great grilled cheese and ham 'pie'.  Just remember to place the ingredients in the center of the bread and don't overfill!  Use small amounts until you get the feel for it and know just how much you can put in it.  The variations are limitless with these- just use your imagination and create whatever your family likes!    Happy Camping!  :)

We always called these Pudgy Pies. They are wonderful made with biscuit dough and filled with fresh raspberries or strawberries. Refrigerated biscuits would work well, too,  I am sure. I have made them with biscuit dough,  cinnamon sugar and raisins - great little coffee cakes.  Whatever you call them , they are definitely a 5 star recipe.

We always called these Mountain Pies, and they are perfect for camping!  FYI - it is possible to make them with a George Foreman Grill or other countertop grill - lol.  We've also made them with Cherry pie filling, pizza-style, chipped-ham and cheese, and with pre-cooked scrambled eggs and bacon with a slice of cheese melted inside.  Mmmmm....

I love these! My family also calls them Hobo Pies. Our favorites are pizza pies & cherry pies. For pizza pies, butter the bread as usual, then use ready-to-use pizza sauce, mozarella cheese, and pepperoni. Another idea is to use peanut butter, a marshmallow, and a chocolate bar for a Rocky Road treat. Be careful with the irons and the pies because they are VERY HOT.

We also call these "Pudgie Pies" and often make pizza ones. There really is no need to butter the bread though, if you already sprayed the pan with the non-stick cooking spray. Save yourself a few calories!

Any pie filling will work.  Toasted cheese or ham and cheese is also good made this way.

We love Hobo Pies! These are also great with blueberry or pizza fillings. I spray the pie iron with cooking spray first and it helps a lot. These are a camping staple with us!

Hi we have made these for years as well. We have always called them camel chips. We make desert ones and savory ones for a meal. The favorites of my family are pizza pockets, ham and cheese, and cherry pie. They are always present at every camping trip. Have fun experimenting.

Great base recipe for hobo pies. We didn't have the "hobo pie toaster" referred to in the original recipe, we used a wonder bread "crustables" press to make the pie pockets. We used blueberry pie filling (our oldest son's request) and wrapped them in foil to cook on the coals. Worked out perfectly and SO GOOD. Next time I'm going to make a sugar butter to spread on the bread, to make a nice sweet glazed crust. Great camping staple instead of having the usual s'mores.

Thank you Adica....You made me smile BIG when I read, "Hobo Pie". :) I flashed back to my childhood when I met a friend from the U.S.A. Her family would invite me to their campsite and it was there, that I tasted the wonderful " Hobo Pie". A very nice treat for families who camp. Can be made with any fruit pie filling plus for a snack make a Hobo Pizza-add tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever you like on pizza's. ENJOY!!! and thx again for the memories :)

Kids love this! We make it whenever we camp as well as on a bonfire in the backyard now and then. I do however sprinkle them with powdered sugar before serving though. Cherry with chocolate chips, peanut butter chocolate and marshmallow is also really yummy.

We recently made these during our annual camping trip. They were a huge hit! Since we had a large group - over 20 people - we purchased a single and double pie iron. We used cherry, apple and blueberry pie fillings.  Be sure to allow time to season the pie irons (we did it the night before we planned to use them) and also decrease the cooking time as the irons heat up. The first batch of pies took around 5 minutes per side, but the last several only needed about 3 minutes per side. We served them with whipped cream. Hobo pies will now be part of our camping tradition.

Love the Hobo Pies!  Really takes me back to childhood days camping and fishing in the West Virginia mountains.  Nothing better than a sweet treat and a warm campfire after a hot day of fishing with my Dad.  We also called them Hobo Pies.

Yum! We had this every weekend as a kid! My family called them 'campfire pies'. My favorite are the ones with CHERRY filling! I always remembered how great they were but until this seeing this recipe, I forgot that they were made with bread. Also, if you're at Walmart & ask for a  hobo pie toaster, I doubt you'll be successful. Try a Camp Iron or Pie Iron. It looks like 2 metal pieces of bread attached to a stick.

Best pizza using the pie maker is to use English muffins, you can butter bottom( gets it crispier like a true pizza) pizza sauce, mozzarella slices, pepperoni or what ever other meat or veggies you want to use, family loves these and say they are better than a Little Ceasar's pizza... Awsome tasting...
