This was yummy!!  I made a few substitutions.  I browned  4 chicken breasts and added 3 Cups of stock., because I’ve run into my IP getting the burn function without more than 2C of liquid. I kept the times as written and when I opened the pot some of the noodles were hard but once I added the heavy cream and sour cream they softened up.  I did not have enough liquid to use the cornstarch so next time I’ll add 4C of stock and then use the cornstarch.  The sauce was delicious.  I’ll make this again!

Easy and delicious.  It's my kind of meal.  I added some red peppers but you don't need to.  I just wanted to jazz it up a bit.  I really like onions so I may add a second one when I make it again.  I will be making this again.  It's a perfect weeknight meal.

Reduced to 4 portions. To avoid the scorch warning I used 2 cups chicken broth, and for the sauce two tablespoons of corn starch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water, a cup of heavy cream and 2 tablespoons sour cream.

Also added a 4oz can of mushrooms (drained) with the noodles.

I really wanted to like this recipe but it was very bland. I followed it exactly so I’m unsure why. Maybe it needed more sour cream?  I’ll try a different recipe next time.
