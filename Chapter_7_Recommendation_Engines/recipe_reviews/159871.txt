i was very dubious of this recipe, but i had all the ingredients, so i tried it and was so pleasantly surprised!  i added mint instead of cilantro, because that's what i had, and the mint-carrot-peanut combination is much greater than the sum of its parts. try it, i bet you'll like it too!

Very nice salad to serve with spicy curry dishes.  I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of adding dressing right before serving, next time I will add and let chill for a few hours in refrigerator.  I found the salad nicer the next day after the dressing had time to marinate the carrots.  Next time I will also try to add some raisins.

Such as fabulous salad.  A great combination of flavors!  I omitted the sugar and it was just fine.

For the first time, when I made this salad I gave 4 stars, but now I want to change my rating, because I made this salad again and realized, how wonderful it is. Very refreshing, tasty, I added more lemon juice.

What an awesome side dish this turned out to be!  It was quick to make, tasty initially and even better the next day. So much more fun than the same old, same old roasted carrots. Each different flavor in the dressing sings out to you and the peanuty crunch makes your mouth happy.  This is definitely getting into a regular rotation!

It's a hard to find a good salad recipe that doesn't use any oil, but this salad is delicious.  I substituted honey for the sugar and replaced the peanuts with walnuts and sun flower seeds.

This was very easy to put together.  I made ahead as others suggested and added the peanuts just before serving.  We felt the lemon was overpowering but the salad had a nice fresh quality about it.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely astounding. This is honestly one of my favorite dishes of all time. It's tart, sweet, salty, and best of all is pretty dang good for you! I don't add quite as much lemon juice.  I recommend letting it sit for a few hours in the refrigerator or even overnight to let the carrots completely absorb the juices and seasonings. Great recipe!

Really liked this fresh and cooling salad. Made a few changes: used walnuts, jalepeno, and much more cilantro. Left out sugar - as I put 1/2 c. sweetened coconut flakes in as well. (the carrot and coconut together were awesome) Also added about a 2 Tbsp of coconut oil just to add flavor and help absorption of the fat soluable Vit A in carrots. Will be making this AGAIN!

This was very unusual for my family. I used 1/2 of a poblano as the "chili pepper". I agree that the flavors blend better overnight, but letting it sit makes the peanuts soggy.

It was good as a base, but a little plain for our liking. As a result, we added olive oil, olives and some greek - style "croutons" ('paksimadia'). Thanks for sharing!

If you will be eating this salad for multiple days, reserve the peanuts, and then sprinkle them over top when you're ready to eat. Otherwise, the peanuts get soggy.

Love this salad! Reminds me of a salad my aunt used to make for big family dinners. I did leave out the sugar, but other than that I followed the recipe.  This one brought back some great memories of home.  Thanks for sharing!

I used unsalted peanuts as that what I had and a Serrano chili. It tasted just like how I remembered it to be. Excellent complementary dish to the curry dish we had for dinner! Great summer salad too! Thank you so much for a tasty dish with just the right amount of kick!

This was sensational! My 5 yr old licked it up and said it was the best carrot salad he ever had! We particularly enjoyed the crunchy aspect. I added a bit of raspberry vinegar . I will definitely be making this recipe again real soon. Thanks for sharing it Priyanka!!!

Lovely, light and bright flavor profile.  I thought maybe it'd not be rich enough, since the dressing includes no oil.  But it was fabulous!

Very clean - no oil.  Used mild banana peppers.
