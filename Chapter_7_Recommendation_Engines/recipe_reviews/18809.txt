To save time, steps, and cleanup, while enhancing the flavor, I've always substituted the potatoes and onion with frozen Ore-Ida brand Potatoes O'Brien, which are the tiny cubed potatoes already mixed with onions as well as peppers. This way, you can eliminate the onion as well as the saute pan. The green and red bell peppers give it a little extra punch -- you can even eliminate the soup entirely.  I also like using sharp cheddar instead of the mild and, in addition, mix about 1/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar with the corn flakes; crushing together in a ziploc.  I use only one dish to mix and bake, and grease it with margarine or butter. Also, I've always baked it at 375 degrees to ensure there are no "cold spots". No one ever tires of this recipe!

My mom makes a similar dish without a recipe, and I was trying to find some formula to guide me. This helped. I recommend: boosting the cheese to 3 or 4 cups; replacing the first stick of butter with just enough olive oil to saute the onions; using only a half-stick for the corn flakes (moisten the flakes in skillet with the melted butter); and mixing all the contents together rather than layering them. Depending on your oven, you also can reduce the temp to 400, I'd say. I'd bake it 50 minutes before adding the butter-moistened corn flakes, and then bake for another 20 minutes.

I just about had my own heart attack when I saw much butter was in this.  So, I decided to experiment.  I sauteed the onions in a bit of olive oil.  I used full fat sour cream because sometimes the low fat stuff curdles when cooked.  I used fat free mushroom soup and only used 1/2 stick butter on the corn flakes.  I also added some turkey ham to make it a main dish.  This was really good and everything I was expecting.   Thanks for the basis to a new family favorite!

A friend from Louisiana gave us this recipe years ago.  It's one of those dishes that you can't stop eating!  I've made it lower fat by using Smart Balance instead of butter, lowfat sour cream, and less cheese, and although it doesn't hold a candle to the 'drenched in real butter' original, it's still good.  I bake it without the corn flakes for 40-45 minutes, then add them during the last 15.  They end up nice and crispy, but not burnt.

This is an excellent recipe for a family dinner, and the top is cripy. I waited a half hour to put the corn flakes on top and it made them golden brown instead of dark brown. Yum Yum Yum!  Thank you!

The proportions are really off in this recipe.  I had to make adjustments soon after I put mine in the oven because it became apparent that this was going to turn out more like potato soup than a casserole.  If you double the potatoes, omit or reduce the butter, and half the cheese then this will turn out great.  As written, this recipe doesn't work well.

I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom.  I was low on sour cream so I added milk.  Yummy!

This goes so well with baked ham, and other assorted side dishes for an easy buffet dinner. I serve it on Easter Sunday because it can be made up ahead of time then simply baked the day of the meal. I like to use Cream of Chicken soup instead of Cream of Mushroom however. I never use a whole onion in anything because I think it overpowers the flavor of the dish...half or less is enough. You can leave the cornflakes off too or use crushed Ritz crackers if you like. Adjust the temperature to your oven and watch so it doesn't burn.

Feel free to try these variations:

Use whatever "cream of" soup you like best.  They all work.  

Instead of sauteed onions, use French's Onions.  One cup, more or less to taste.  

Substitute chive flavored Top the Tater for plain sour cream.

Add cubed ham or sliced sausage (polish, keilbasa, etc.) to the recipe.  I used a 1 lb. keilbasa, cut into 3/4 inch slices.

This recipe is a good base and takes very well to variations.  It's also very quick and easy to prep.

This is a great recipe!  I have always made it with cream of chicken soup, but I didn't have any on hand this time.  Also didn't have enough sour cream so I used about half a cup and then used 4 oz. of cream cheese!  This turned out better than usual.  Did not use as much butter as the recipe called for--I put the original stick in and then brushed the top with a few Tablespoons softened butter.  Got great reviews from the fam! Thanks!!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  I used sharp cheddar and half the butter recommended.  Assembled it two days before, cooked it one day before (without corn flakes) and brought it up to temperature on Thanksgiving Day with corn flakes (350 degrees for 30 min or so).  There were no leftovers.

This was wonderful.  I've made it twice now, the first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, I didn't top the casserole with corn flakes or butter.  Instead, I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese and baked it.  Turned out great!

love this recipe. I doubled the frozen potatos- used 2 cans cream of celery, 1 16 oz sour cream, and 8oz bag of cheese (plus a lil more.) Added some salt & pepper for taste and an entire small raw chopped onion- no need to sautee anything. I covered with foil for 50 min to help it bake quicker  and uncovered for the last 10. Viola!

I brought this to my annual Christmas party and it was gone in a heartbeat. I did make a few changes 1) I used bagged hashbrowns (not frozen), 2) I added cooked chopped up bacon, 3) I used french fried onions on top instead of cornflakes, and 4) I cut back on the amount of butter. I'll be making this often.

Wow! awesome! These are the changes that I made, first I sautee the onion plus I added a clove of crushed garlic. then I mixed in a bowl the mushroom soup with the cheddar cheese and 2 TBSP of milk- NO sour cream- then I mixed in the hashbrowns ( I try no to get the tiny tiny ones but a more larger size hashbrowns) and then I just mixed this all together and put it in a greased dish. On top I sprinkled Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and this was amazing!! NO NEED FOR 1 CUP OF BUTTER!

Too greasy!  I wanted a Hashbrown Casserole recipe that tastes just like Cracker Barrel's - delicious & cheesy.  This sounded intriquing because who doesn't like butter, right?  I used 6TBS of the stick to saute the onions and the remaining 2TBS for the topping (I didn't have cornflakes so I used Panko breadcrumbs), so total that was 1/2 the stated amount!  The casserole was, literally, swimming in grease!  I'm trying to blot the remainder on paper towels in hope of salvaging it for leftovers.  The topping was very good & I will be using that on my other recipe but this is definitely NOT something that I will be making again.

This was my first time making a potato casserole. It was easy and turned out quite tasty. I think it would have been better if the soup mixture was mixed iwth the potatoes.  I fried my onions in a TB of light olive oil and warmed my corn flakes in a skillet with only 1/4 cup butter and it was plenty.  As suggested below I added the corn flakes on for the last 10 minutes of cooking. Yum Yum...will definetly make again.

I have been making this recipe for years, it is a must have at all family gatherings.  I have made it Many different ways over the years. My favourite is hash brown with onion flavour,  I like to use one can of low fat cream of celery and mushroom. I add plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and a little low fat milk. I use old cheddar to give it extra cheese flavour, and for topping I add more cheese along with Italian bread crumbs. If I do add onions, I sauté them until they are tender and add it to the mix along with fresh garlic. This recipe can be modified in so many ways...it is a keeper in my family.

This is a great recipe.  I use an extra cup of cheese (3 Cups) in the mixture and only half a large onion.  I've also found that if you lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees and cook it for the full hour you will not burn the cornflakes.  It reheats really well in the toaster oven too, the cornflakes get crispy again and everything.  Just cover it for the first few minutes in the toaster oven or they corn flakes will burn.

Mmmmm!!! I made this to take to a Potluck. I added some brocolli to it and it was a hit! Everyone loved it, but of course I was hesitant to tell anyone how much butter was in it! Oh, make sure you pour the butter evenly over the cornflakes or you might get some burned places where there's no butter. I could tell the areas that didn't get as much coverage.

My family and I love this recipe!  

I made a few changes to add color and extra flavor based on previous reviews.  I used Potatoes O'Brien instead of hash browns, as the package includes red and green pepper and onions.  I also used only one stick of butter, which seemed to be enough.  And the only other change I made was, I added the cornflakes and the rest (1/2 stick) of the melted butter during the last 30 minutes of cooking, the crust turned out crispy and perfectly browned.  

I will definitely continue to make these potatoes as a side-dish for my family and friends!  This casserole has such a strong, rich flavor; it's also very filling and belly-warming!

I loved this casserole. I combined the hash browns with the cheese/sour cream/soup and only used a pat of butter to saute the onions. A stick is way too much. Same for the corn flakes, just enough butter to coat the corn flakes before putting them on. I also had to cook at a lower temp to accommodate other items in the oven, but it wasn't even an issue.

The best potatoes on the planet. This is not the classiest recipe out there, seeing as you can get most of the ingredients at 7-11, but it is absolutely delicious. At my house these are simply known as the cheesy potatoes and we have them for every single holiday meal. I fix them for myself regularly, particularly on lousy days when I need comfort food. We make it a little differently: skip the onion, mix all the ingredients except the corn flakes together instead of layering it, and only use the butter on top. But it works great as written here also. You can use any type of cream soup you like to change up the flavor a little. I've used cream of broccoli and cream of potato. A++++++

I've been making this recipie for years, and you just can't beat it!  Try cream of celery soup instead of the chicken.... I always mix everything except the butter and cereal in a big bowl, then dump into the casserole.  Then I melt the butter and mix with the cereal and then dump all that on top and spread around... don't forget that Kosher Salt! ! !

It's great! I did do a few things differently. First I used just cheddar cheese soup. Then I did sour cream to taste I love sour cream and so tasting it within the dish is fine with me. Also I put in at 375 and checked in after about 30 minutes then let it go again for about another 20 or so. I put the corn flakes on about 15 minutes before I took it out of the over. There were a few burnt ones but it seemed to work good. I also used to butter at all besides using a spray to grease the pan. I omitted the onions as well.

This is a great recipe.  The pan disappeared in no time and there was only 9 of us.  I did add some garlic powder and some Tastefully Simple Onion Onion for more flavor.  My whole family loved this!  Even my mom who has been making fabulous cheese potatos for years said this is what she was serving for Christmas this year.  Thanks so much

always a classic - still a bit greasy but can use low/no fat alternatives of everything but cheese without any taste/texture changes.

Love this recipe! I know...it's bad for you...but it's oh so delicious. I do cut back the calories by using non fat cream of mushroom soup, low fat cheese, low fat sour cream, and light butter. It still tastes fantastic. This is a great side dish for a family meal or a great dish to take to a pot luck. It always goes fast.

We liked this recipe quite a bit, but did make some tweaks that worked out nicely.  I used the 16 ounces of sour cream, but used part of a dip packet to spice it up.  Also used cream of chicken and herb soup and swiss cheese.  We topped it with a sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers and poured half a stick of melted butter over it.  To assemble, I thawed out the potatoes and mixed the sour cream, soup and most of the cheese together before putting it in the pan.  Baked it for 40 minutes, and then topped with the rest of the cheese, crackers and butter.  This recipe certainly lends itself well to modifications!

This is a good, quick, easy dish for a crowd (I was cooking for 40). I made some adjustments to add additional flavor and nutrition, which I think was definitely needed. It would have been too bland w/o it. With the onions I sauteed finely chopped broccoli, diced bell pepper, and chunks of ham. I also stirred the hash browns into the mixture, instead of just laying mixture on top, and used fried onions as topping. I think corn flakes, bread crumbs, fried onions or additional cheese would all work nicely as a topping.

I did not have time to review the comments - which I wish I had done before making this recipe!  1st: way too much butter. I followed recipe & sauted onion in the stick of butter and added to soup/sr cream mixture.  Then continued directions and it said to add remaining stick of butter (where is THAT on extra stick on the ingredient list???).  It seemed too much so I only drisled a couple tablespoons.  I would recommend only using a tablespoon or two to saute onion and then use only a few tablespoons over the corn flakes.   I would also reduce sour cream to about 1/2 container and add a bit of milk.  It was tasty but the potato to cream mixture proportion was off.  A bit too goopy.

Absolutely one of my favorite splurge sides. Perfect for potlucks. Great with baked ham. Cornflakes are the best topping, but I have used Ritz crackers and breadcrumbs.

I made a couple of changes:  I added bacon bits.  I didn't have any cr mushroom soup, so used cream of chicken.  I also used crushed up potato chips on top.   The recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

Throw in a small can of chopped green chilis for a nice addition to the flavor of this dish.  Also, cream of celery soup, or other cream soups may be used.

Yummy comfort food!  Perfect side dish for a gathering or family dinner.  I used O'Brian potatoes which were soooo good, they had onions and peppers already cut up with the potatoes.  Easy, don't hesitate to try this.

This is a great recipe. Obviousy mls has not made it, because it does not come out soupy at all. I don't think recipes should be rated if they haven't been followed properly. The bad thing is, readers are heading that rating. Excellent dish, everyone asks for it at gatherings over and over again!!  :-)
12/17/16- After making this dish several times, I realized it calls for a lot of butter. I've cut back the total amount of butter to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup.

Made this to take for Thanksgiving at my in laws as well as my moms house. Used cream of chicken instead of mushroom, doubled the cheese, and omitted the onion. When it first comes out of the oven it's very soupy looking, but if you allow it to sit for a little while it does thicken up. Huge hit with no leftovers which made the hubby pout a bit..Will be making again soon for him.

Love the ease of this recipe compared to so many versions of this out there (pouring over potatoes).  My preference, I made a couple of changes.  I didn't have corn flakes so left them completely out (darn!..should have used Ritz) I cut down on butter by 1/2 and added a splash of olive oil.  I added fresh garlic to the onions too!  Oh, I like to use Cream of Chicken. Also, make sure your potatoes are completely thawed or they will be hard...baking longer using frozen potatoes will burn other ingredients.   Yummy stuff!

Too sour and didn't like the texture. If I ever make this again I would use a lot less sour cream.

My mother in law loved it, but I didn't like it as much.  Pouring the butter directly onto the corn flakes made it a little tough, and I didn't really care for that.  I also used a bag of little square cubed potatoes instead of the shredded ones.  It turned out, and I will try again.  Except maybe I'll mix the butter in with the corn flakes instead of just pouring it on.

I used 98% fat free soup, low fat sour cream, and 2% cheese. I also sauteed the onions in a tablespoon of butter, and then used only 1/3 cup melted over the topping. It was still gone faster than lightening and wasn't nearly as guilty of a pleasure!

Only complaint is the cooking time! It was charcoaled at 425. I would start checking at 45 mins. It really doesn't need more than 50 mins. I substituted the potato chips for corn flakes, and cream of chicken. Tossed in a bit of salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. GREAT recipe-just watch the cook time!

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch...very creamy and tasty! But this MUST be covered while baked, otherwise the cornflakes will burn, I also reduced the temp. to 400!

Great recipe to take to a potluck or family dinner.  Everyone will love it!  I know there's a lot of butter, but don't skimp - it's so delicious as is!  I do suggest covering it with foil for the first 20-30 minutes, then uncovering it for the remainder - otherwise, the cornflakes may burn.

Excellent! I halved the recipe for my family of 4 and it made just the right amount with no leftovers.  I gave the recipe 5 stars based on flavor and ease of preparation but, I did make a few alterations. The recipe calls for way too much butter.  You only need a few tablespoons of butter to saute the onion - not a whole stick.  Even though I halved the recipe, I still used the entire can of soup(didn't want it to go to waste).  The sauce seemed a little too thick so I added about 1/4 -1/3 cup (skim) milk. After pouring the sauce over the potatos, I dotted the top with a few pats of butter (approxe 3 TBSP)instead of using the remaining stick that the recipe called for.  I also substituted durkee french fried onions for the cornflakes which I added during the final 5 - 10 minutes of baking.  The whole casserole only took about 1/2 hr to cook.  I will definately make this again!

Oh boy, I don't even know where to begin with this casserole. I think this is one of the best thing I've ever laid my taste buds on. I think that my taste buds were even drooling.. haha!! I made this with meatloaf and corn on the cob. I followed the recipe to the exact, didn't change one thing. This casserole also makes for awesome leftovers... I honestly think I liked the leftovers more then I liked it when it came fresh out of the oven. I think that the ingredients had time to marinate overnight, to make for a even tastier treat... and I honestly thought it couldn't get any better. Lol!! Loved it and will definitely make again, thank you!! :o) Happy cooking!

This was really good. The only changes I made were using fresh cubed potato and less corn flake (All I had was the precrushed cornflakes used for breading which I will say I don't love)

Awesome! I've been making this recipe for years and lost my paper copy of recipe, so I had to find one on AllRecipes. Most of the time I do not add the crunchy topping.

Excellent recipe! I usually put a little garlic salt in the butter before melting it to mix with the cornflakes. Not much, just enough to give a hint of garlic. Nothing over powering. I also use Cream of Chicken with mine.

I love this recipe! It's great the way it's written but I often make it with half the sour cream, cubed hashbrown potatoes with onion in them and no cornflakes on top. I just cover them with foil while cooking so the stay moist. YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!

I loved this recipe! I used cream of mushroom soup instead. I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours. It turned out just as good- but I had forgotten the corn flakes. Everyone loved it! This is one of those classics that you just can't go wrong!

This recipe is delicious, but VERY rich.  I covered the casserole with foil so the corn flakes would not burn.  I recommend taking the foil off for the last 5 or 10 minutes, to brown the corn flakes a little.  Adding hamburger or chicken would be a nice twist.  I'm not giving this very good recipe five stars because it's a little typical of many other casserole recipes and somewhat routine.  Good stuff!

I’ve made this 5 or more times and learned a few tricks. 1) use cauliflower instead of potatoes for a low carb variety. I buy two 15 oz bags of frozen cauliflower and just thaw and rough chop - no precooking needed. 2) I use 1 stick of butter, not 2. I melt it in the microwave then add dried onion flakes and let them sit a bit to reconstitute then add all the other ingredients, stirring in the cauliflower last. I don’t recall it taking a full hour at 425 to bake. I think I do 400 for about 45 min. You can adjust to bake alongside meatloaf or other main dishes. Yummy!

Loved it!! There are so many Heart Attack potato recipes out there and they are all pretty similar. This recipe stood out to me because of the sauteed onions. So I tried it. It didn't say to thaw the hash browns which was great because I was under a time crunch. Party was in 1.5 hours. Quick shopping trip - $17.09. Easy prep. I did mix it all together even though the recipe calls to lay it on top of the hash browns. Cooked @ 350 instead of  420 accidentally just because all the other recipes said 350 and I never really checked the temp. Arrived at the party on time! 10 adults, 6 kids. Everyone that tried it, loved it!  Not even a spoonful was left. I will continue to make this for shindigs without changing a thing, except maybe making more lol. I will also try to make a low-fat version for my family. Oh and BTW I used Denny's frozen Hash Browns

1/2 recipe serves 6 easily.  After sautéing the onions, I drained 1/2 of them and mixed them with the other ingredients.  The remainder I mixed with the cornflakes and put on top of casserole.  Be sure to cover with foil until last 15 minutes.

I changed this a bit and it turned out amazing.  The huge lasagna pan was finished at the potluck.  I used potatoes o'brien, cream of chicken soup, dean's french onion dip, sour cream, salt/pepper and topped it with bacon flavored/regular flavored ritz crackers.  I baked it at 350 for an hour and it was a hit!  Enjoy!

My family absolutely loves this dish. We also always use Potatoes O'Brien in place of the hashbrowns. I don't follow amounts very well either. I add what I want until I like the flavor. It seems to always come out awesome! I'm not sure if you can screw these up! Though one tip I found is I never crush my corn flakes, and I add them closer to the end of cooking time. Yum!

Delicious! I used low fat sour cream. Next time, I would only put 2-2.5 cups of corn flakes over the top & I would reduce the oven temperature from 425 to 400. 

Recommendations I used from other reviews:

I used a tiny bit of olive oil to sauté the onion. I didn't use any butter. 

I only mixed the corn flakes w/ 1/2 stick of melted butter.

This recipe is delicious! I made it exactly as it was written and served it for company last night. It was a big hit! I'd like to try it again with diced green and red peppers in it just for variety.

Great recipe.  I substituted the sour cream and onion with french onion dip to save time and gives a little extra flavor.  Used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, and used fresh cubed potatoes, with a little extra cheese.  Also I added corn flakes latter and used spray butter to cut back on butter and saves a little time...but always good which ever way you make very forgiving recipe.

Big hit! Took this to a Thanksgiving dinner with friends and they said it was the highlight of the meal. Many people went back for seconds. I used Potatoes O'Brien instead of hashbrowns and mixed all of the ingredients together as another user recommended. I still did the Corn Flakes and butter on top but mixed in a little cheddar cheese on the topping as well. Still very rich with half the amount of butter. Definitely making this again. Super easy!!

I liked it very easy and simple. I added real mushrooms and cubed/dice ham to have more protein to the dish. instead of heating the onion i place in the bowl to mix up the ingredients. It was very good. My daughter had three helpings and always asks for me to make it again.

I made this to go with Christmas dinner and EVERYONE wanted the recipe!! It is so yummy! I used cream of chicken soup in stead of mushroom.I did put foil over the casserole for the last 20 minutes to prevent the cornflakes from burning, and I used two bags of fresh hashbrowns, not frozen. This was a big hit with everyone !

Great recipe! I add the frozen hash browns to some boiling water- just until they are tender and then add them to the casserole dish so they aren't as hard.  Crushed ritz crackers are great if you don't have corn flakes.

Took this camping and it was a hit. Used 2 packages of potatoes, a can of cream of potato soup, and 6 eggs with about 4 table spoons milk scrambled and mixed in. I found it easiest to bake this with foil cover so the corn flakes would not burn and only at 375.  For this big of a batch, I had to separate it and bake them at different times to heat throughout.  Also added more cheese before putting the corn flakes on top.

This is yummy and I would make it again but as a breakfast/brunch dish.  I would not serve this again with dinner.  It makes a ton and was also good left over the next day (with eggs for breakfast).

Delicious! Made this for Easter Sunday and it went very quick! The only thing I may change is to use low sodium soup. It was just a tad salty for my taste. But otherwise was yummo!

I used half the butter and omitted the soup and used green onions.  Should have added some milk to make consistency more like a sauce.

very good...but I changed a few things.  I cooked the onions in olive oil and only 1/4 cup of butter.  I also used a little olive oil to moisten the corn flakes and I did not put the flakes on top until the last 15 minutes of baking.  I just didnt like it with all that butter!

I love this recipe! I cut the butter and sour cream in half, use french fried onions on top, use the family size cream of chicken soup, sometimes use half pepper jack and half cheddar, add small ham cubes, and 3/4C low-fat cottage cheese, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2tsp onion powder and salt, fresh ground black pepper to taste. YUMMY!

I did change the recipe.  My husband has gluten intolerance, so I counld not use the cream of mushroom soup.  I did find recipes to make gluten free soup, but didn't have the time.  I used cream cheese as recommended by a reviewer, and the dish turned out great.

You can never go wrong with this.  It is best to saute the onions first though.  They are much more tender that way.

I really love this recipe... although I've used it for lunches and dinner side dishes, I usually make it for breakfast as a yummy side dish with pancakes and some bacon.  I make the recipe exactly as is... however, if I'm trying to make it a bit heartier, I'll add some diced ham to it.

Jeremy, this is an excellent recipe! It's so easy to make and the smell while it's in the oven was so great I couldn't keep my family out of the kitchen while it was baking!  Before it was ready to serve my son was digging in, and before I knew it... HALF the pan was gone.  Teenagers!  Anyway, the rest of my family and a few friends loved it too.  I'm making it again today for our Packer playoff party.  I'm sure it will be a hit!

I really loved this recipe. My husband absolutely went crazy over it. Like one of the other reviews, i mixed it all together instead of layering it. I lefts off the corn flakes and added extra shredded cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking. I also scaled this recipe down to 12 and mixed 3 cups of cheese instead of 2. I definitely recommend!

How can this recipe lose?  Pure comfort food, and must for the holidays.  I added creme of chicken soup rather than the creme of mushroom with good results.  Love it!

This is a quick and easy dish to make for parties or pot lucks.  The only suggestion that I would have is instead of pouring the soup mixture over the potatoes, to stir the potatoes into the mixture to coat them evenly.  The potatoes on the bottom didn't seem to bake with the mixture and ended up being a little dry.  Also, be sure to cover so that the cornflakes don't burn.  It fails to say this in the recipe!

This is a good base recipe to start.  I added 1/2 lb of bacon and sauteed the onion in the drippings and drained.  I added about 1/2 c of mayonaise, a bit more (1/2c.) cheese and used cream of celery soup, and it tasted much better. Nice and hearty when it is cold out.  I only make it about 2-3 times a year, because it is so high in calories.

Very easy, I added turkey and ham, increased the cheese by a little, and used Ritz crackers.  Definitely add the topping the last 15 minutes because it gets golden brown very quickly, so I covered it in foil the rest of the baking time.  I also mixed all together, instead of layering.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent dish to make when you're having a large crowd over for breakfast or brunch.  However, I will not use that much onion the next time and I also will not add the corn flakes until 20 or 30 minutes before it is time to remove from the oven. I have found that the cornflakes burn when using them as the recipe instructs.

This was so so good!  The corn flakes add the crunch that puts it over the top. I used the Ore Ida O'Brien Potatoes but still put onion sauted in butter.  I also added cheese to the corn flakes and I accidentally forgot to pour the melted butter over the corn flakes.  I still turned out great!  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. I had two ears of fresh corn (uncooked) so i cut the corn from them and used in place of the canned corn. I also added one egg (thought I remembered this when I made it years ago) and (before the last 10 minutes of baking) sprinkled the top with shredded Colby Jack cheese.  Baked until golden brown. Dee-licious!

I have been making this potato casserole for years. We love it.
I do it a little different than this recipe. I spray the pan mot butter it. I use cheddar and jack , sometimes I add a small can of mild green chilies or add some chopped mushrooms and green pepper. I sauté the onions in a sprayed oil or one tablespoon of butter. I also melt 1/4 -1/2 cup melted butter to the crushed cornflakes mix it then put on top. The other way is way to much butter for our taste.

Made it mostly to script, but used Potatoes O’Brian, so left out the onions and butter for the onions. I also added ham to give it more to fill the tummies as a main dish. While we served it on a Sunday, it would be a great mid-week meal. Easy to prep and throw in the oven. I skipped the bowl, made it all in the in the pan. Not sure that was a great idea, it was messy. Turned out great, but messy to make like that. Didn’t have any issues with the corn flakes being burnt or soggy. Everyone loved it.

I made this dish several times and I changed a few things. I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom,and I added 11/2 cup celery and extra shredded mild cheddar cheese. It’s more flavorful and a big hit at potlucks.

I followed the recipe as written and it was very good--everyone liked it.  I used O'brien cubed hash brown potatoes. Next time I'll mix the potatoes and wet ingredients together rather than layering--the potato layer  was bland compared to the soup/sour cream mixture.

Do this recipe exactly as said with only one change.  When putting the butter on at the end just slowly drizzle the butter on top of the cornflakes and slowly use your fingers to mix it  in until the cornflakes are glossy and covered. You may not need all the butter on top that it calls for.  As far as the inside of the recipe do not change a step ! It is perfect and everyone loves it!! It is my most requested recipe.

I made this for my husbands birthday dinner.  It was a big hit!  I followed a couple other suggestions and mixed it together instead of doing layers.  Added a pre cut up pkg of 3 types of peppers and also a good bit of garlic and sautéed it in butter.  Also did not add the corn flakes until the last 15 minutes and put a little cheese on top and popped it back in the oven.  I also added a few more seasonings to the bowl while mixing it.  Was absolutely great.

I made this as written. Thank you so much. A big hit. In fact we had it on Saturday and my wife insisted I make the next day when our daughters came for dinner. That time I added some red pepper flakes and still a hit.

I put a good white fish on top of the potatoes then the cheese mixture, I like to use a sharp cheese, brings out the flavor of the fish, this is a meal in my house not a side dish.

Made this casserole exactly as written other than using my Crock Pot Casserole Crock instead of baking in the oven. It may seem like a lot of butter but it works. This is a fabulous dish!!!

The best casserole I’ve ever made. I ended up using cream of broccoli bc I don’t like mushrooms and I put crunchy onions on top instead of cereal bc it’s what I had. So good!!!

This is one of my family’s all time favorites that evolved over time. I usually sauté onions until golden in half of stick of butter and add it to the potato, sour cream, cream of mushroom and cheese mix. Also, I discovered that using Mexican or El Salvadoran sour cream that is salty really enhanced the flavor along with some salt, black pepper and touch of cayenne. The rest of the directions are the same. None of the holiday gathering in our household go without this dish.

I followed one reviewers suggestion and used the frozen diced potatoes with peppers and onions. This allowed me to eliminate an entire stick of butter. Worked perfect. I also cooked it at 375 for a little longer than suggested to avoid cold spots in the middle.

This recipe ended up pretty bad... i recommend cutting the sour cream down to a half or even a fourth of what is called for. I ended up mixing in a box of jiffy cornbread mix (which made it pretty good)  after baking it & it looking more like a soup.

I used cream of celery soup, and the shredded hash brown potatoes, plain yogurt, instead of the sour cream.  Cut the butter a little less though.

Not sure what a person rating this recipe thought the ingredient portions were all wrong, but the measurements worked for me.

Family loved it - very creamy.  Makes a lot.  Easy to put together.

Not impressed.  All the flavors of the sour cream, cheese and cream of mushroom soup were lost.  A good thing I caramelized the onions. Otherwise the flavor of the onion would've been lost as well. I did not use one cup of butter. I  only used 3 tablespoons. 1 tablespoon to sauté the onion and the other two for the crushed cornflakes. I also added a ham steak which I diced up and add it to the soup mixture.  I was hoping for a nice creamy texture, similar to potatoes au graten, but to no avail.

Yummy.  Very rich, so I cut the amount of butter mixed into the potatoes by half.  I also used crushed club crackers instead of cornflakes and drizzled about 2 tbl. of butter instead of an entire stick.  Since the club crackers are already butter this worked fine.  Tasted great.

Large grated the onion. After sauteing onions in butter, added  can of cream of chicken  soup and the 2 cups of sour cream. Then i folded the thawed 30 oz of shredded hash browns in to everything in the skillet. Then put everything in the greased casserole pan. Will probably use ritz crackers or plain potato chips for the topping, since that's what i have on hand - but i know i love the corn flake  topping so would definitely do that next time.

My husband is allergic to onions so I left them out along with the butter that they would be sauted in.  It turned out a bit dry and not enough flavor for our taste.  The sour cream seemed to overpower the flavor of the mushroom soup.  I will try it again, but will use cream of chicken instead of the mushroom, and maybe add some garlic salt/pepper.

I actually saute the onion in about 1 T of butter, I use 8 oz. sour cream and about 1/2 stick butter for the topping. I mix the potatoes with all of the ingredients except the topping in a large bowl and drizzle 1/2 stick melted butter on top. Excellent recipe! My boyfriend loves it, and that's really all that matters to me. Thank you for the recipe.:)

Here in Utah these are called "funeral potatoes" and are a staple dish apparently. I loved them the first time I tried them and have tried several recipes to get the desired results. This is the one. The only thing I did differently is mix it all together first then put in the baking dish, and I rarely have corn flakes so I use penko mixed with melted butter and spread on top. Perfect with baked ham and green beans. :-) It is definitely my guilty pleasure.

Nothing more than sour cream taste. At a minimum of three times the sour cream necessary!

Loved by all... The only change I made was tossing crushed corn flakes w/the melted butter THEN, spreading on top

I love this recipe, great comfort food on cold days. I split my casserole into 2 parts because I wanted to see which we would like better, so half of it I layered as per these directions and the other half I mixed all together with the soup, sour cream,  and cheese mix. It was a draw, the layered side had more hashbrown flavor sure. However I will not put the cornflakes on the whole time again, we had to scrape off some pretty dark flakes! I n the past I added the flakes and butter halfway through and will do that from now on, and I think I will lower the temp to 375 - 400 degrees. I also thing the idea of mixing the cornflakes with the butter first is going to be the way to go next time! Thannks!

Primarily I find myself apprehensive concerning preparing a casserole, yet this simplistic technique with creating such a fine dish was ever-so worth it! I must say combining flavorful complimentary properties of nutrients with a lil sprinkle of green onions, fresh parmesan and parsley atop each portion, made this a fabulous side dish! Tantalizing the taste buds, scrumptious decadence adored with whatever phytonutrient, thus adding taste thereto any protein which fits the palate.. 

~Applause therefor the ideal into an imaginative concept that heretofore went into the creation of mastering this easy dish!~ Transmitting a projected balance thereto any hand created cuisine, with a nibble of spuds along the plate! 

Thank you!

Great Recipe! When I cook I have a habit of never completely following the exact directions, I love just subsituting ingredients or tweaking things here and there to fit what I like to have done in the recipe. This recipe is delicious and the only thing I changed was I took my own potatoes and shredded them. I'm sure the original is just as delicious but I decided to give it a go do a little change up. Simply delicious will be making this dish again for sure, and as usual I will probably change a little thing or two. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

My family love this dish. For my version, I brown some chopped bacon, sausage and onion. We like it cheesy so I added more cheese than recommended in this recipe. Also, I omit the butter from the cornflake. Grease from bacon and sausage is plenty enough. 
I  tried to bake it in the cupcake/ muffin pan to make individual serving for easy-serve at party or better yet for on the go breakfast. It was a hit. Kids loved it. With this recipe, I can make 22-24 pieces. Baking time is about 45 min. at 425F. Definitely keep with variation.

Great recipe. I "baked" about 10 potatoes in the microwave, removed the skins once baked and filed into small ( crushed ) pieces into my greased iced dish. To the sautéed onions I added 1 egg and additional all purpose seasoning. Everything else was as instructed!! Loved it... My first casserole

Ew. One serving and I am done. Judging by all the glowing reviews here, I'm guessing that anyone who's got a taste more interesting than mayo and sour cream might want to steer clear of this recipe. I've got an enormous 'casserole' sitting on my stove and I dont know who's going to eat it.

It taste delicious. The only major problem is that after even 30 minutes at 425 degrees, the cornflakes and butter got burned to a crisp. This is the second time this has happened and I am surprised that nobody else has reported the problem. Perhaps adding the corn flakes topped with butter just 15 minutes before the casserole is finished, might work out better. C. coven

This is an awesome, easy recipe. Some changes I made though, are: use half the corn flakes and add them the last 20 min of baking or they scorch, sautee mushrooms with the onions, and use 2 cans of soup. This is a great 'comfort food' recipe.

This recipe is absolutely great, I baked this dish uncovered for 45mins at 400°and then covered it with foil for the last 15 mins on 375°. I didn't cook it at 425° because I didn't want it to cook to fast and also didn't want the buttery frosted flakes to burn.

This is the best cheesy potato casserole I have tried.  It's not terribly healthy, but it is very good, quick and easy.  I ran out of corn flakes and used rice crispies and I only used a 1/2 stick of butter on top.  Still delicious.

I followed the cues from other reviews and substituted the potatoes and onions for Ore Ida Potatos Obrien. It's so easy to make and really delicious comfort food. My fiance went back for seconds (and thirds)!

The kids loved it and asked for more.  Next time I will mix the potatoes with the sauce before topping with crumb topping.  I'll also mix butter with crumbs before topping casserole.  I think I'll also start with fresh rather than frozen potatoes... just b/c I'm not a fan of processed foods.

This recipe is great! We had family from out of town and I needed a quick side dish for a baked ham and stumbled upon this dish.  We loved it. The only thing we did different was we doubled the potatoes, and used very little butter on the corn flakes. Turned out great!

Delicious and easy!  I did change some things.  I added some extra cheese to the mix.  I also did not saute the onions and add them.  I just added french fried onions to the corn flakes instead.  The last change was to spinkle salt on the tater tots before pouring on the mixture.

I love this recipe! I make it on all the holidays and take it to all the families. I use cream of chicken, and instead of shredded hash browns I use the hashbrown patties (McDonalds Stle) you can get from the store and crumble them into the bowl for mixing w/ the other ingredients. I also use potato chips crushed on top instead of cornflakes...and no extra butter on top. Some revisions to the recipe but it's essentially the same. :) & sooo yummy!

my aunt makes something like this...I call them cheesy tatoes :) I really only use this recipe for measurement purposes...b/c instead of cream of mushroom I use cream of chicken, and I leave out the corn flakes and onion completely...PERFECT comfort food!!!

I made a "healthified" version of this recipe. I used reduced fat cheese, light sour cream, reduced fat cream of chicken soup, and 2 tbsp non-hydrogenated butter spread to moisten the corn flakes.  I sauteed the onion (1/2 cup chopped) in a little olive oil. I mixed everything together instead of layering. Oven at 350 for 1 hour. I put on corn flakes after 30 min in the oven.  (Maybe using spray butter on the flakes would have cut even more calories, but I didn't have any on hand.)I brought this to Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it! They were all surprised when I told them it's a reduced fat version. There were no left overs!

I was only making enough for 4 plus a bit of leftovers for my husbands lunch, so I cut down on the amount of soup and sour cream to  half. I mixed in some mexican cheese blend that I had on hand along with some of Emerils Essence ( I prepare this spice blend rather than buying it to save money and can still use the spices for other recipes)   to kick it up a notch.  As with one other review I also used the Ore-Ida potatoes with peppers and onions and put the cornflakes, and some sharp cheddar cheese on top the last 15 min of cooking. To save on calories I sprayed the baking dish with pam instead of butter.

Tasted excellent. I skipped the cheese altogether and made it on stove top as I was in a hurry but the husband could not have enough of it. Thanks for a great idea.

Waaayyyy too much butter.  Next time, I'd use at least a 1/4 less butter than what is called for.  It was swimming in butter when pulled from the oven, but after it cooled a bit, it was less greasy. I've made similar recipes before that called for less butter and they turned out fine. Other than that, it was good.

i gave this 4 stars because it is simple and tastes pretty good, but it's not for special occasions with company. more like a crowd feeder at a barbeque. the flavor was just a little processed, perhaps because of the condensed soup. but it'll do in a pinch!

I used a cream of celery soup and I omitted the butter drizzled on the corn flakes and I didn't grease the pan. It didn't stick and was a little less greasy than other recipes that I have tried. Great recipe.

I made this for a family gathering and it was a huge hit!  As suggested, I used the O'Brian potatoes and it came out great.  I lowered the fat by using fat free sour cream and used about 4 tablespoons of butter over the corn flakes.  I will definitly make this again!

I didn't like this recipe too much because I have had potato casserole at parties and this did not taste as good.

Not very healthy, but a great pick for a barbeque or potluck.  The leftovers are good too, if there are any!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It is very simple to make and tastes great.  I would also reccommend covering the corn flakes as they have a tendency to burn.  Also, I skipped using sauted onions and just used normal onions.  Love that it takes 10 minutes to prepare.  A++++++

This was easy to make and was a hit for x-mas! I just mixed the potatoes with the other ingredients, and threw it in the casserole dish. Very good, thankyou!

This turned out great. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and the family liked it.

It's not something I would fix ALL the time, but def. nice for a change.

This is the most delicious thing you'll ever eat.  My friend introduced it to me as cheesy potato casserole but it doesn't matter what you call it, it is good!!

A bit bland the first time I made it so I made a few changes.  Extra cup of cheese, can of mushrooms, sauteed some green peppers with the onions, and a spoonful of canned jalapeno peppers.
Very yummy.

This Recipe was pretty good, I didnt add the cornflakes cause I dont care for them much....... I let the top get a golden brown and it was yummy. I took and made tacos out of the dish and added some fresh salsa that I made it was YUM =)

delush and extremely easy!  very good the following day reheated even though we lost the crunchy topping.  Next time I will reheat and make some more crunchies to add on top.
