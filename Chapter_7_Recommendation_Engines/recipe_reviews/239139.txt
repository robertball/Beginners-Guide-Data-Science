I wanted to try this recipe for the simplicity.  I used pepper bacon and cut into smaller strips.  I started browning the bacon with the garlic (increased to 2T), added 1/2C chopped onion, and used a whole jalapeno (with seeds, chopped).  When satisfied with the color, I deglazed the cooker with the beer (I used Corona), then poured the rest of the beer in and added a tablespoon of cumin.  I let that simmer for about 5 mins.  I'm a big fan of layering flavors.  I had just been to a local farm and bought fresh butter beans, which I added in with the water, but increased it to 6C.  My cooker has a button for beans, which is 14 mins, so I used that to start the cooking.  At 14 mins, the beans were just almost there, but while I could taste the start of some good flavor, it was really bland.  I added 2T pinto bean seasoning, 1T cumin, 1t salt, 1t garlic salt, and turned it back on for 5 mins.  The flavors came out really good.  This is a good base recipe, but next time I think I'll just double everything, (inluding the jalapeno!) and use a whole onion instead of half.  I also would throw in a ham hock or tasso, but I was all out...

I really enjoyed this recipe. I've made it twice. Both times, I skipped soaking the beans overnight. Instead, I added a cup of liquid and cooked them an extra 5 minutes. If you have gastric distress with lima beans, don't skip the soaking overnight part which reduces the chemicals that cause the distress. Instead of 4 cups of water, I substituted 2 14.5oz cans of low salt chicken broth plus 1 cup of water. A 14.5oz can contains a little less than 2 cups of broth. The second time I cooked this recipe, I used a whole jalapeno pepper instead of 1/2. The next time I cook it, I'll probably use 2 peppers.

I made this recipe with no alterations except I used the small limas and added a few additional jalapenos.   I'm going to apply an overused word.   Awesome!  The was outstanding and the beer really knocked the flavor out of the park.   I've canned several jars of this according to pressure canner directions and it cans well.  Next time, I'll be doubling the recipe and canning some to stock up on.

it was ok, the beer just didn't do it for me, it was easy for a beginner to follow though.

Followed the recipe the first time I made this and it was good.  Second time around I used a pound of hot breakfast sausage instead of the bacon.  Added an onion chopped and sautéed in bacon drippings and used a can of Rotel’s original in place of the jalapeño.  Both times the beans were super soft and velvety but I thought the tomatoes from the Rotel really added a nice dimension.
