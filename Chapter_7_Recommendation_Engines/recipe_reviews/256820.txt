I thought this was good, and I loved just using the pack of taco seasoning to season this soup, but the taste of the beer was a little overwhelming. I would use half as much beer next time.

I really liked this but you need to use low sodium chicken broth or it will be too salty. I had some leftover black olives from another dish and added those but that is the only change I made. This was good and super simple!

Except for using almost two pounds of chicken I followed the recipe exactly.  Both wifey and I really liked this and I’ll definitely be making  it again!

I made my enchilada sauce and taco seasoning from scratch to reduce the sodium and used low sodium chicken broth.  Very good!

I loved this soup!! Quick and easy. I’m glad I did the low sodium chicken stock that was suggested. Next time I make it I won’t use frozen since it came out a little on the watery side and add peppers. Thanks!!!

This recipe came out pretty good. I used low sodium chicken broth. I had a bigger can of enchilada sauce so I used a little more than the recipe calls for. Thank for the recipe:)
