This is what I have to say about this recipe.  I wept with joy at the first bite.  Do you know how hard it is to eat and cry at the same time?  Yet, I pressed on.  After that, I wept with sorrow, because there would be a last bite.  Knowing that I would soon finish the succulent tri-tip steak that I had left in the marinade for a full day because I forgot I was going to cook it left me in a pool of tears... it was even harder to chew as I sobbed and sobbed... but I managed, oh yes.  I managed.  After a few minutes, I awoke from my bittersweet bliss, wiped away my tears and resolved myself to make this recipe... again and again.  Oh joy!  One thing to mention, though, is that I didn't have worchestershire sauce in the house, so I opted to use a certain brand steak sauce in its place (begins with an "A")as the flavor of that reminds me of the original ingredient.  I'll be making this with the W sauce this week.  I'll bet it's even tastier...  Thanks for inventing it, YOU ROCK!!

Should leave out the oil as it prevents the tenderizing effect of the vinegar, oil meat just before grilling, otherwise perfect marinade.

This was excellent but after reading the review from the previous person I used balsamic vinegrette instead of the vinegar.  It didn't overpower the other ingredients and made an excellent marinade.  I will never buy marinade  again!

I usually double all ingredients except for the olive oil, marinate for 1-4 hours (depending on how far ahead I've planned! lol) and then, while the steaks are cooking, boil the leftover marinade with about 1 tsp. cornstarch to make a delicious sauce to put on top of the grilled meat! Mmmm.

Wow..this marinade was fantastic!  Don't let the simplicity of this recipe fool you..it really comes together.  I made it exactly as written, went easy on the salt and marinaded for 2 hours.  Hubby loved it and the kids asked when we could make steak like "that" again!  I will be making this marinade again for sure.

OH....MY....GOODNESS!!!!!
Soak a rib eye in this juice for about 5 hours, and DANG!  Best steak that's ever graced my table!  My wife, who DOESN'T LIKE STEAK, pounded a 16 oz. after tasting mine. Rich flavor, wonderful tenderizing, slight carmalization...what more can you ask for?  Without a doubt the best ever.  I've made this for approx 40 different people now, and literally each one has said that it's one of the best steaks that they have eaten.  I've also added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar at times to add a little sweetness and aid the caramelizing.  Top your hot steak with a pat of Blue Cheese Butter (softened butter whipped w/blue cheese crumbles & then refrigerated) and you'll swear you've died.  I'm making steaks again right now!

I'm not sure if this is the "best" steak marinade I've ever had, but it's very good.  I used low sodium soy sauce left out the salt and used a bit less oil for two good sized NY strips.  I also added some fresh rosemary.  I let these marinate all day before grilling and they had a very nice flavor.  If you use a good quality balsamic it won't over power the other flavors.

Made a good steak. The vinegar was the flavor that really stood out, maybe a bit more than it needed to. I think I'll try this again with a tad less vinegar and more garlic.

This is my go to marinade! I like to marinade my Tri-tip about two hours without the oil, in a zip type bag. Then pour the marinade into a pot and add the oil into the bag that the steak is still in (squish), then put it on the grill. Heat the marinade to a boil add 1/4 c butter and some brown sugar and make a reduction (add white wine if you have it). Cook it down for a while to cook off the strong vinegar taste and it will get thick. It makes a great reduction and I do not feel like I am wasting ingredients. My family loved the steak and the "sauce" that I served on the side!

I wouldn't change a THING, except to omit the salt as I feel the soya lends the perfect amount of salt to this marinade. I used it on some beautiful rib eye steaks which I was saving for a special occasion, and this marinade did the meat justice! Tx for a fab, fab, FAB recipe.

Well, the only thing better than this marinade was Kazoo's review!  LOVED this!  Family said its a keeper.  I made a mistake by only marinating one steak in it...not ALL!  Thanks SweetCravings! :)  Try it folks you will LOVE IT!

I did not and would not change a thing in this recipe.  This was the best I've made and far better than any bottled marinade that I've tried.  As my family and I are eating this we're thinking, "okay, when can we have this again?"  That's a sign of a good recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing this one.

Great! I was a little worried this would be too strong or salty, but it was really nice (I did not add any salt, though). I marinated sirloins for about 5 hours and they were tender and flavorful. Thanks for the recipe!

Any steak marinade that is heavy on salt is going to wreck a steak.  The salt will literally pull moisture out the the meat, causing it to be tough.  If you use this recipe, marinade steaks for just 20 minutes, or substitute low sodium soy sauce.  2 hrs will result in a dry steak.

Used this marinade on some skirt steak. I didn't have time to marinade for 2 hours, so it just marinade for like 30 minutes. It came out amazing! My husband kept on asking if I used a store bought marinade or something from the cooking website! He coudn't believe it! This marinade is definitely a keeper and will use over and over!

( Left in Ziplock bag from 5pm Saturday - 2pm Sunday ) I made this recipe on 5 flat iron steaks for a BBQ / Picnic and the meat was so tender it could be cut with plastic. My group actually said these were some of the best steaks they ever had. ($9.15 for 5 at Walmart / cheap cuts) I ran out of Worcestershire so I used A1.  Also sub minced Garlic with Garlic powder.  I will be using this moving forward for sure.

Note : I could not taste heavy balsamic or olive oil and I am a picky SOB

A tad too much oil. I left out the salt.  Why would you add that with soy sauce? Just sayin'. It was okay. Definitely not "the best". edit an hour and a half later: All I can "aftertaste" is balsamic vinegar. That and the oil. Not the way I want a Steak. If I wanted that lingering taste, i would have had a salad. Sorry.

Love it. I use this exactly as written most times.  I do love to experiment though and have, on occasion, added 1 Tb brown sugar (daughter loves it that way) for a little sweetness and it adds great color when grilling. I also will add 1 Tb pineapple juice for chicken or 1 Tb apple juice for chops. When I add juice I subtract from the balsamic to compensate.

What a fabulous marinade!  I omitted the oil since I had some pretty tough steak to tenderize and I wanted the full effect of the vinegar.  I also added about a tablespoon of brown sugar...because let's face it...that stuff is delicious with just about anything.  I was only able to marinate my steaks for about an hour and they were pretty moist.  I will definitely use this again and marinate for longer. I used the leftover marinade and simmered it down into a sauce to pour over the steaks before serving. Delicious.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and eliminated the extra salt, but followed all else as written...maybe added more garlic - but that is my thing! I had four large Top Sirloins and mixed the marinade and put it in a 2 gallon baggie with the steaks for 2 1/2 hours. Was wary it would be too strong per other reviews! I will definitely make this again, but will marinade for at least 4 hours. 2 1/2 was not enough time....it left me wanting more marinade flavor. Really good marinade. Both DH and I said, "Yum!"

This IS the best steak marinade on earth!!!  I mean seriously...super easy and OH MY GOSH SO GOOD!!!!  I did not have any problems with it tasting vinegary or anything - made exactly as written except for I didn't have the dijon mustard, but I just put some dried mustard in there and it was fabulous.  My whole family raved!

We enjoyed this marinade on a NY strip steak last night.  It has a nice blend of flavors, but doesn’t overpower the flavor of the meat.  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and marinated for about 8 hours.  One word of caution, the balsamic vinegar in this marinade will burn easily, so don’t get carried away with your searing temperature.  I would make this again and I’m thinking of trying it on chicken and pork.  A keeper!

we were skeptical at first but this recipe lived up to its name. Definitely a good idea to leave out the oil. Cut a 2 inch delmonico steak with a fork!! no lie!!

When I make steak, I use venison, as my husband and I are both hunters. Venison, if you haven't tried it before, is a very lean meat, but it can taste quite "gamey" when it comes to steaks, since it's just the slab of meat with no processing. This marinade makes the venison steaks have nearly the same taste of beef steaks. I let it marinade anywhere from 6-12 hours in the fridge and the steaks come out tender and juicy. It is a nice flavorful recipe and I don't think the vinegar is too strong at all.

Wonderful! I threw this together about 3 hours before I grilled my steaks. The only change I made was using Guldens Spicy Mustard instead of Dijon. While the steaks were grilling, I sliced some onions and opened a can of mushrooms and sauteed them with a little butter until they started to brown, then added the remainder of the marinade and cooked until most of the liquid was gone and served that on top of my steaks.  I also used a bit of mesquite chips on the charcoal and let them smoke while grilling. Incredible flavor.

If you have been using a gas grill for a while, you might want to try charcoal again. I think the extra work is worth the extra flavor charcoal gives.

Really great flavor. Only marinaded for 40 minutes and it came out great.  Can't wait to marinate overnight.

You know that hot sauce commercial that says "I put that s*** on everything!"?  Well, that now rings true of this marinade in our household.  I first made it for some sizzle steaks while on vacation with limited meat choices,  I didn't have mustard on hand, but you would have thought I'd bought high end filet it was so amazing.  I had a lot left over, so I cooked it down and used it on grilled veggies the next day.   I made it for pork yesterday (with mustard this time) and it was just as good!

I suggest using a low sodium soy. Was too salty for us, but the flavor itself was good.

Recipe turned out wonderful, never used it and was incredibly nervous because my mom wanted me to grill for her and several friends for her birthday! Only omitted the salt and pepper because I figured with the Worcestershire and soy sauce the extra salt would be overkill. Mixed up a few batches of marinade and poured into ziploc bags with the steaks and let marinade for 4 hours. Everybody loved it! *huge sigh of relief* The only thing I would have done different is let marinade 2-3 more hours max. The steaks turned out wonderful, everybody polished off their plates and thanked me with big satisfied grins, couldn't be happier!

I used 1/2 tea of oil, low sodium soy sauce and no salt and doubled the garlic.  Wow!  I used a 24 stainless steel blade meat tenderizer on 2 porterhouse steaks and it cut the marinate time down to 15 min. We have been using Moore's Steak Marinade for years but not any longer.  You gotta try this folks!!!!!  Salt is a killer for tender steaks if you marinate just a little too long, leave it out and be on the safe side!

my family all loved this recipe but I found it to be a tad too vinegarish for me; or maybe I will not put the mustard. I will tell you that the soy/balsamic/garlic combo is a winner. I followed the recipe exactly and now will be making my own modifications. UPDATE: with the addition of a pat of butter while the meat rests, it is delicious and cuts the vinegar taste tremendously. The color of the steak is terrific and is very impressive for guests.

This is VERY strong; therefore, I would suggest you really keep your marinating time down.  It did not "tenderize" our New York Stripe steaks at all.  We marinated them for about 4 hours.  They were just extremely flavorful, but borderline overpowering.  We said we’d use it again, but soak for only 30 minutes each side for flavor only.  If you like using “steak sauce” then do not use this because this stands alone.

Used this recipe for sirloin steaks, marinated for 8 hours.  All eating the steaks thought they were delicious.  Made the recipe exactly as written, except seasoned steaks with the salt and pepper before grilling, didn't add it to the marinade.

Good, not great. I have tried many steak marinades on the allrecipes site. This one is better than average but doesn't rise to the level of some of the others on the site and a few I've picked up elsewhere. I prefer a marinade with a flavor that has more of a citrus flavor going on. If you prefer a marinade that doesn't change the flavor of the meat significantly, this may be for you. It is very good.

We really liked this a lot. Nice marinade and very simple (as a marinade should be). I didn't have dijon mustard so I just used some yellow mustard. I've made it a couple of times now - once with filet and once with some cheaper steak that I cut into strips. I coarsely chopped some onions with the strip meat and let it all marinate all day in a plastic ziploc in the fridge. Then I tossed it all into a frying pay and served it over rice. Yum!

This was good! I used half the amount of soy sauce and omitted the salt since I usually eat a low-sodium diet and I figured it may be salty.  With those adjustments, it was perfect for me. Everyone enjoyed it (and they didn't have to reach for the salt shaker).

A good base recipe for making your own marinade, your typical main ingredients and with a bit of tweaking will almost always turn out delish :) I prefer to add a good amount of garlic to everything. 

(The oil is unnecessary, would make more sense when making a barbecue sauce)

This was alright but not impressive for us to want to use it again. DH didn't like the soy flavor at all. I thought it was rather bland and really didn't do a whole lot for the steak itself. It wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't a recipe I would use again. Thanks, I enjoyed trying out a new recipe.

I've used this recipe over and over...  it's by far the best marinade I've ever had. Way better than any of the bottled stuff!  I make the recipe exactly as it is and have even put the marinade in a ziplock bag with the raw steak and frozen it for later.  That way it's ready when I am!

I have made this recipe twice with different results.  Once, I marinated this a thin top sirloin for several hours and it was to die for!  The second time, I marinated a thick ribeye for about an hour.  I'm not sure if it was the short time or the thickness of the meat, but I couldn't even tell there was a marinade on it.  Either way, if left to marinate for a good time, this recipe is wonderful!  It's tangy, sort of sweet and takes a minute to prepare.

FANTASTIC ! I will use this again. I did change the ingredients slightly, used 2 cloves of fresh garlic halved and used 2 Tsp. of Mustard powder. I also left out the salt. I had 4 porterhouse steaks and put 2 steaks in a ziploc bag and added the marinade and let sit for 10 hours. Grilled the steaks and they melted in our mouths. Absolutely amazing marinade. Thank you for the recipe!

This is an awesome marinade for any steak. I always add a little brown sugar too just because I like the sweetness, and I use a little less soy, just for personal preference. This has become my go-to marinade. Thanks!

The males in my household love a good steak and were licking their lips for more when I made this. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the mix to add a touch of sweetness. It was perfect.

Marinade was great. Did not have fresh garlic substituted garlic powder followed everything else to the T. I wasn't able to marinade mine too long but they came out great! Seasoned with McCormick Montreal Steak while cooking on the grill and the results were fantastic will most definitely use again!

Two thumbs up. After one bite my husband asked me if I marinated the steaks. He said, "this is delicious, you should make sure you add it to your MacGourmet progra." This is a pretty good endorsement from a guy who has never noticed when I have marinated anything. I did use slightly less balsamic vinegar because I didn't want the steaks overpowered. Thanks for the great addition to my recipe box!!

This was fantastic on boneless beef ribs!!! I can't wait to try it on a nice strip steak! Incredibly tender, juicy meat with delicious flavor. I honestly did not think it would be good when I was making it, because when I dipped my finger in the marinde it was just "ok" however....after marinating and cooking on the grill, my beef was equal to fine restaurant quality!

This marinade was perfect!  I included every ingredient except the salt.  I peppered my steaks before I poured the marinade over it.  I let the steaks marinate for 2 hours before cooking.

This marinade was easy to make with things I had on hand and it helped to tenderize the steak. The flavor however, did not appeal to me.  If I were rating it on taste alone, I'm afraid it would be a one. The marinade was overpowering and it was all I could taste. I like all the ingredients in the recipe but somehow the combination of them did  not work for me.

It is good but I'm not sure if it is the "Best"... It does retain a lot of the beef taste and we like that more than marinades that sort of cover up the taste of the beef itself. Definitely worth a try. I did cut down on the balsamic vinegar as I don't have a very good quality one and many reviewers said that the vinegar came out too strong. Also, I cut down some soy sauce as we don't like too salty.

I didn't put the salt in since it had Soy Sauce.  It turned out wonderful.  I also used a cheaper cut of meat and tenderized it and it was very tasty.  Hubby loved it and so did I.

This is delicious!  I normally use a recipe that has a lot of A-1 in it, which we love, but I was out of it.  This tastes a little like A-1, and makes the steaks tender and juicy.  This is a great way to enjoy steaks!  Also, it's made with things I usually have on hand - bonus!

This is a delicious marinade. I used it on top sirloin & vegetable kebabs. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and left out the balsamic as my husband isn't a fan. I just added a bit more of the other ingredients to compensate. I also added onion powder and a few red pepper flakes and left out the salt. This will be our new marinade, so easy. Thanks for the recipe.

I would have given this 4.5 stars, if it were an option. I loved the balsamic vinegar/Worcestershire sauce/soy sauce combo. The amount of Dijon mustard was perfect. I knocked the minced garlic back to 1 tsp because while I enjoy garlic, I'm rather sensitive to it, so I usually have to reduce the quantities. Most people will not have to. I saved the olive oil (extra-virgin, please) to drizzle over the cooked steaks. Unless you're making an emulsion, the oil is just going to float to the top anyway, so it won't actually come in contact with the meat. I also added 1 tsp of ground ginger simply because I love the combination of beef and ginger. A little grated onion would have helped this along, too, but it's very nice as is. I garnished the grilled steaks (NY strip steaks) with chopped green onion and a little cracked black pepper. Yum!

Quick and easy and oh so good!  I left out the salt, but otherwise kept recipe as is.  I only had an hour to marinate the steak, but still turned out fabulous.  I even put some marinade aside and used it the next night to cook the leftover steak in for a Chicago Ceasar salad - FABULOUS!!

My second 5-star rating ever given. It's bonafide! I followed as is, incl olive oil. Marinated for 4+ hours, my ribeye didn't need forking. I took left over marinade and reduced down to a sauce. Drizzled some while the steak was resting.

I agreed with many of the reviewers that there was too much balsamic vinegar. I would take it even a step further by saying that the worcestershire sauce, only exacerbated the problem, as I see it. I am not saying that there shouldn't be any worcertershire sauce, but it should be less along with less balsamic vinegar. I marinaded three kinds of meats: Breast Chicken, Flank Steak, Sirloin Petite. By far, the chicken was the best taste...but for me, there will be no redo on this marinade. My search continues.

Absolutely loved this.  I did a 2 lb. boneless blade roast which I marinated for several hours.  Yes from a frozen state.  Roasted on top of carrots and parsnips with the marinate in the pan which I thinned with a little water.  Will be making again.

This is an old recipe! My grandparents & parents used this when I was little. The only difference is they used 1/4 c. whiskey instead of olive oil. My parents had a pool and would use this to marinade a lower price cut of meat to serve all our guests. It is good!!!

Some recipes have way to much salt. I used no salt and low sodium soy sauce.  I didn't want a heavy vinegar taste so I used white balsamic from trader joes. I also found that if you use a kiwi fruit peeled and sliced and mixed into this marinade it is perfect. The kiwi helps with tenderizing the meat, the best thing about this recipe is you can still taste the meat.

Fantastic!  I agree with some of the other reviews, I find that oil in a meat marinade is counter productive, so I omitted it.  I also substituted 1 tsp of BACON mustard (yes - check the grocery store) for one of the tsps of Dijon.  I marinated for four hours and the steak was tender and delicious.  I did not find the balsamic overpowering at all, but I did pat the steak dry before grilling.  Served with hasselback potatoes and lemon pepper green beans.

The only thing I changed on this was adding more garlic! I love a good med rare, charred steak and this does it for me!  I usually use a chimichurri recipe but decided we could use a change...this was a perfect choice!  For those not liking much of a "vinegar" taste - PLEASE, always taste what you make before throwing your steaks in! A very light to no vinegar taste at the beginning may be what you need once it's marinated for a couple hours....

Best Marinade ever!  Great on steak and even on chicken- easy to make also and it keeps well in the refrigerator! oh, and using the leftover marinade and reducing it on the stop top made a great little sauce that everyone loved! Thanks for the great recipe-its become a standard here and everyone who tries it wants the recipe, yet it blends so well with the meat I have to tell them I used a marinade!

I doubled the garlic and used 1/4 cup more balsamic vinegar and it was amazing! I marinated the steaks for three hours. My four year old doesn't like steak but ate both mine and his when he tried it.

Marinating the steaks is usually my husband’s job so I didn’t know what ingredients to use. Found this recipe on allrecipes.com  and it turned out awesome!  I followed the advice of several reviewers and cut the vinegar in half. Very easy and quick to mix up the marinade. My steaks marinated for about 4 hours before cooking on the grill. They were tender with a bold savory flavor.  My son even had two servings of steak which is completely out of character! Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Everyone commented how beautiful the meat was and asked for the marinade recipe. I was thrilled as I have tinkled with marinades before and none were nearly as good as this one. I only marinaded for an hour too.  I couldn't be happier. This is certainly a keeper..

I made this last weekend and going to make again this weekend!  Def. not an overpowering taste at all. I usually like steak on it's own but this gave the steak great flavor...I used filet Mignon and broiled...melted in your mouth!  I did not use any salt just because I try not to cook with it.  I doubled the recipe this time because I have 3 large steaks, so we'll see how that comes out.  Yum so good. I made with the roasted veggies recipe on this site which also has balsamic...went very well together!

I was disappointed with this recipe, as the tri tip was quite bland. Moreover, the marinade didn't seem to really penetrate into the muscle tissue even though I marinated it over night. I made a rub for the other tri tip, and everyone preferred that one. I will not use this recipe as written again.

Absolutely excellent. I took it one step further bringing it to a boil and then simmering it, stirring frequently until it thickens.? Note I use a very deep chocolaty balsamic vinegar I get from the Olive Pit in Corning California.

Made it just as the recipe called for.  I did make extra marinade and mixed it with some melted butter and used that as drizzle while the steaks cooked over open charcoal flame.  Best steaks I have EVER made!!

Marinated Steaks (Beef - Top Side) over night.  They were VERY tender but balsamic vinegar was too intense for my taste and also was a little too salty.  I did it again by replacing balsamic vinegar with lemon juice, half the dijon and half the soy sauce (used light).  Seasoned only with pepper.  Used half of the marinade (plus wine, butter) for a muschroom and onion  sauce.  Result is unbelievable.  Will make the same with rump.

A little olive oil in a sizzling hot cast iron skillet...marinated steaks...1 min on each side, then into a 350'F oven for ten minutes with the marinade (put in pan and bring to a boil quickly before oven).  Cut up red and yellow peppers on top.  Was absolutely fantastic!

Good, the Worcestershire flavoring seemed to really dominate in spite of using half of what it calls for. If you're a big fan of Worcestershire then you'll like it.

Ok, so normally I use a bottle of italian dressing but I only had the fancy ones i like on my salad, so I looked this up.  I took this a step further and I didn't measure I just dumped from the shaker bottles about seven shakes into my ziplocs as I went because I had three thick steaks and I wanted to use premixed seasoning in the liquids listing but --because I didn't have enough Montreal Steak for all three steaks, I mixed up dry mustard, black pepper, shallots, garlic salt, chile and garlic powder, fennel seeds, and cumin seed I shook it up really well in an empty container and sprinkled some in each ziploc baggie, maybe a large serving spoonful in each.  I left out the soy sauce for the extra salt but I used extra worcestershire because I like the rich flavor.  By basalmic was chunky (oops) so I used apple cider and rice vinegars and I put a HUGE serving spoon full of garlic in because I have the preminced stuff in the fridge and you cannot have too much garlic.  Smells Awesome!

I make this but omit the salt and oil and use hot mustard powder instead. I heat up the grill and put my cast iron skillet in to get hot. I smear a little butter on the steaks right before they go into the pan for a good sear, then serve the steak nice and rare! De-glaze the pan and you'll have a nice au jus. This marinade works well on skirt steak. Even works with chicken!

Update! Made it again. Once again, no oil since olive oil has a low smoke point and I sear my steaks at 600°. I added cayenne pepper this time and a dash of Thai fish sauce for umami.  Believe me, you won't taste the fish sauce once it's been mixed in with the other ingredients!

Very flavorful steak.  Unlike some other reviewers, I don't change a thing.  Let the steaks marinade in this mixture for half a day and you'll have beautifully flavored steaks.  The combination of this marinade and grilling over hot coals makes for some of the best tasting steaks I've ever had.  The marinade perfectly complements the beef flavor without in any way overpowering it.

We had some carnivorous friends over for a BBQ dinner so I gave this marinade a try on their T-Bones with a few modifications: no dijon, so I left that out, and I left out the salt (unnecessary on top of all the soy). I also added a heaping tbsp of brown sugar for some nice caramelization.  Everybody raved!

This was sooooo good. I followed directions exactly and marinated steaks 24 hours. They came out perfectly with so much tenderness and flavor. I skipped the steak sauce and just ate mine with blue cheese which is something we used to order at restaurants when we lived in Germany. This is a real keeper!

This is the most amazing marinade I;ve had in a long time!!! Thank you SweetCravings!  Didn't change much except omitted the salt (to taste) as I thought the soy sauce would be enough for me and I did use a low sodium soy sauce. I also used a low fat balsamic vinaigrette instead of the balsamic vinegar. It was excellent.

I don't eat steak but I used this recipe to make some for guests. They loved it!! I didn't have the dijon mustard, so I had to improvise. I used a tablespoon of Golden Brown mustard and a tablespoon of honey mustard instead. I also used light soy. I skipped out on the salt because the soy is pretty salty all on its own. Definitely easy and worth it!

This was ok, but not the best I've ever had. Was kind of disappointed I used it on good steaks. All I could really taste was the soy sauce...big disappointment after reading the high reviews.

Excellent marinade.  The first time I made this, I didn't change the recipe at all; however, we found the balsamic vinegar at little too over powering.  The next time I used red wine vinegar and it was excellent!  I also add 1/2 tsp baking soda to break down a little of the fat during the marinade process. I typically like to marinade my steaks overnight.  The flavours are way more intense and flavourful!!!

My family of picky eaters absolutely loves this sauce.  It's the standard we use each time - no changes except that I doubled the amounts so that we would have extra for dipping!  Thank you!!

absolutely the best marinade I have ever had! I have kept this as my favorite marinade for the last 2 years. I have tried others but keep coming back to this one! I dont use salt or pepper to taste as I think this marinade is perfect without it. Delicious!

These was a great marinade.  I did leave out the Olive Oil and I used less Balsamic Vinegar.  All and All it was very good.  My husband loved the steaks.

Wow.  I literally just got done eating a rib-eye marinated in this exact mixture for an hour or so.  Wow.  The second I got done I had to write this review.  It really is the best.

I agree with many others... way too much balsamic vinegar. I would use half that amount and double the garlic next time

Even though I'm not a real chef, just someone with a knack for cooking, I just finished cooking and eating steak made using this recipe and it was the best steak I've ever made and ate. The only thing I did not have was the Dijon Mustard and it still came out sooooo tender and flavorful, and I had some cheap flat iron chucks !!! I will definitely be doing this marinade again and again. Thank you

These were good, but not great. The balsamic taste stood out over the other flavors. I generally enjoy balsamic vinegars in cooking, but they need to be cooked in a way in which the vinegar can reduce and turn in the the sweet balsamic glaze taste. These just tasted like balsamic vinegar. They were very tender, however. I marinaded them for about a day and a half.

My family really enjoyed this! Heck even my 2yr old eats all of his steak now and normally he doesn't eat steak! This is now my go to marinade and I love that I always have everything on hand to make it! I throw it all into the magic bullet and then let the steaks marinate overnight!  thanks for a great marinade recipe!

I LOVE this recipe - it's so easy and tastes fantastic!  I use it frequently and marinate steak tips overnight for the best taste.  I also use Horseradish Dijon mustard for an extra little kick (not overpowering) and 4 big cloves of garlic when marinating a little over 1lb. of steak tips.

Great recipe except I did not add any oil at all.  I only had it marinade for 2 hours and it was still awesome. I am making it again today and am excited to see how it will taste marinating for the whole day.

Great recipe. I marinated two steaks and onions for a little over 2 hours. BBQ'd the steaks and cooked the leftover marinade and onions in a pan with some red wine and EVOO to thicken it up and serve as a sauce. It tasted AMAZING. This is my boyfriends favourite meal now.

I use this marinade all the time - with all cuts of meat.  London Broil, NY Strip, Rib Eyes, etc.  I get compliments all the time.  The only thing extra I do is add Season All to steak while it is cooking.  And, marinate for as long as you can.  The longer it marinates, the better the flavor will be.

Absolutely the best marinade I have ever used! The sirloin (London Broil) was the most tender and best tasting we have ever had! I sliced it very thin and used it for hot beef sandwiches. Wonderful! Be sure to save some of the marinade, heat it and mix with the steak juices for an au jus if you make sandwiches.

First off, this is my first steak marinade, always opting for Montreal steack seasoning, but after using this one, may never make it "dry" again! Made the marinade exactly as written and found it to be fantastic! No one even used steak sauce. Cooked it over a wood fire and between the marinade and the smoke, felt like we were eating at the best steakhouse out there! Very yummy!!

I've tried many marinades and this one, so far, has been the best.  I, like some of the other reviewers, used a balsamic salad dressing and it turned out really well.  None of the vinegary taste other have talked about.  I would recommend this tasty, very easy to make marinade.

Delicious and perfect addition to steak - yummy
Cooked marinade on the stovetop (bring to boil) along with cut mushrooms.  Sauce will thicken and pour over steak with the mushrooms - outstanding!!

I rarely leave reviews, but this marinade is amazing and easy! I didn’t have balsamic vinegar so I substituted red wine vinegar. The flavor of the steak was amazing and it was so tender. This will be my go to marinade from now on.??

Best marinade ever! I’ve never written a review on this site but this one was worth it. I’ve used this on anything from sirloin to ribeyes and it is simply amazing. The vinegar helps to tenderize it (don’t listen to the review that says the olive oil hurts that) and if you have a ribeye then you’ll have the most amazing steak ever. I’ve used it on porterhouses too but ribeye is the best. I will say that I’ve also used it on pork tenderloin and that is pretty good too. Be sure to let it sit for at least two hours on steak and overnight for pork.

We really liked this marinade. My fellas come on my son and husband, are not big fans of anything spicy. I left out balsamic vinegar and garlic. Use 1/2 oil. I don’t like it marinade these for 30 minutes but they turned out so tasty! I highly recommend this recipe.

Not good but not horrible. To much salt for my liking. I marinated my steak in it all afternoon. Tried to make the leftover marinade into a sauce but it just has so much salt taste to it. Probably will try a different recipe next time.

This recipe is by far the best Marinade i have made ! I made it exact to the recipe only cutting back a splash of the vinegar. I let the steaks sit in the bag for about 6 hrs & then started grilling . I could tell the steaks were gonna be tender just by the way the fork went through them while grilling . I usually don't prefer to using any flavor for steaks & letting them just taste great on their own , but this was outstanding & I will prob be hooked doing this every time since it's staples I have in my pantry .

Best marinade that touched steak. I never go with a recipe exactly, and this is the BOMB!! Nothing bottled can match it. I marinate about 4 hours and use a charcoal grill. Amazing!!

Very good marinade but very bitter vinegar taste like others were saying, I added 3/4 teaspoons of brown sugar to counteract the vinegar and this made it absolutely perfect.

Used this marinade for steak fajitas. Only changes I made were no salt, a little extra garlic (garlic lovers in this house), and used Liquid Aminos All Purpose Seasoning (320 mg/1 tsp) in place of soy sauce (roughly 230 mg/1 tsp) wrongfully  assuming it was lower in sodium. All in all, great recipe!

Hubby likes this as a marinade, I cut the vinegar in half or sometimes sub with lemon for pork and chicken marinades. Is very useful you can throw anything in it depending on what your making. I’ve always used it with a 4hr minimum soak, to up to 36 hrs later. Just makes a moist tasty piece of meaty goodness

Marinated our sirloins for about 4 to 5 hours before grilling. They were melt-in-your-mouth and an excellent first experience for my six year old who agreed to eat steak for the first time. She ate almost a whole thing - this never happens. However, I think I'm going to cut back the vinegar a little bit the next time. It was overpowering. Otherwise, really delicious and worth a try.

Wowsers! I don't usually leave reviews, but this is so good! I made it exactly as written, opting not to add salt and pepper. I marinated 1 1/4 inch sirloin for 5 hours and grilled about 14 minutes total. The flavors blended well, and it was very tender. I will make steak like this from now on.

Probably THE best marinade I've used/tasted! I used it to marinade tenderloins; and like another reviewer suggested, I added beer until they were covered. Guests said it was the best beef tenderloin they've ever tasted ??

Loved it!!! Made this for Fathers day dinner and we all enjoyed this very much!!!! Smelled spectacular when the steaks kissed the grill!!!! Even my neighbors got a bit jelly!!!  Maybe one thing I would have done differently, maybe let the meat steep a little long in the marinade......I dunno, I'll have to play with it. But no question, this was the best simple and easy marinade for steak!

Seriously good! Made almost as written. I doubled the recipe and made two adjustments, one out of preference and one out of necessity. 1) did not double oil as I felt the original 1/4 cup would be sufficient and 2) used 1/4 cup standard balsamic and 1/4 cup fig balsamic because I did not have enough of the regular. Marinaded 4 rib eyes for 8 hours and 2 for 2 hours. 2 hours is not enough IMO at least not when compared to those marinaded for 8 hours. Would probably be equally as good at 4 hours. The only change I'll make next time, and there will be many, is I'll try using all regular balsamic. However, I have to say the 50/50 with fig balsamic was pretty amazing. I'll bet this would take a less expensive cut of meat from just ok to wow! Try this, you won't regret it.

This is a really nice, very easy-to-make marinade. I don't cook much, but when I need a quick marinade for kabobs, I always come back to this one.

First time using this recipe and will use again.  My husband loved it.  The juices I spooned over top of steak with onions and mushrooms and it had a sweet taste .  My husband loves it.  Leftovers going in his lunch and to my mother-in-law. The only change I made was used a honey Dijon as that’s all I had on hand.  Also took other reviewers suggestions and drained off the marinade then added just under a 1/4 cup olive oil to ziplock bag before cooking steak. Fried on high heat in cast Orion pan for 3 min each side then topped with onions and mushrooms before putting under the grill for 5 min. Amazing taste and texture was so tender.

Delicious!  Used this on a rib eye boneless steak and marinated for about 6 hours. We had purchased the steak from a new source and weren't sure just what to expect on tenderness and flavor.  Well, the marinade sure helped put the steak way up in flavor and tenderness!  I used low sodium soy sauce, and not additional salt or pepper.  Other than that, recipe was as written.  Not sure what some reviewers were referring to about the vingery taste, we never noticed anything like that.  Next time I'll try this on chicken.  Thank you very much for this great marinade.

Worked well flavor wise but I marinaded my “top sirloin” from 7am to 5pm fully submersed in the marinade in the fridge.  Taste was great but meat was still a little bit tougher than I hoped.   I will marinade overnight next time. Overall easy recipe and good flavor... not what I expected based on the ingredients. Thanks!

First time I made this I didn't marinade for very long, maybe 30 minutes, but it still gave some good flavour. This recipe is nice and easy and I had the ingredients all on hand without having to buy anything special which is great. I have 2 striploin steaks marinating in it right now and I'm looking forward to dinner!

I used apple cider vinegar but if you do you need to cut the amount to 1/3 cup 
I added 1/3 cup of brown sugar marinade steaks overnight.
My grandkids said it was delicious

I had been searching and searching for a marinade that you could use with various cuts of steak and I stumbled onto this one and I'm sure glad I did!!! My husband and I LOVED it!! He usually does the marinade instead of me and I told him I wanted to try it this time and afterwards he goes I will never marinade another steak again, this was excellent. he was actually a little shocked that it was better than his. haha I followed the receipe exactly but I didn't have Dijon mustard so I just used regular Frenchs mustard. After reading some reviews about using balsamic vinaigrette dressing I decided to use Newman's Own Balsamic. It's a great tasting dressing and I think went fantastic with the marinade. This receipe is so simple yet very tasty. All of these ingredients together were just perfect! This is my go to marinade now!!

I followed the recipe but I think next time I'll use less vinegar or use a vinegarette instead. It wasn't overpowering but you could definitely taste the vinegar after it was cooked. I think I'll add some crushed red peppers to the mix to add a spicy kick to the marinade too.

Good flavor and easy to make. I actually had all of the ingredients!  I used the leftover marinade as a sauce over the cooked meat when it was served.  Definitely will make it again.

I made it per the recipe, though I was not rigorous, and was generous, with the measurement of garlic and mustard. My wife is the one with more discriminating taste, and she liked it, enthusiastically. So, yeah, it's good.

Marinated two 8 ounce - 3/4 inch  rib eyes for three hours,   Great flavor that goes nicely with beef.   I used only 1tbs.  of each liquid in the recipe and proportional amounts  of the other ingredients.  Sealed in a ziplock with air removed for  3 hours, then  Seared in very hot skillet with olive oil and butter 2 minutes  per side. Then moved skillet to 415 oven to finish for 3 minutes.

Followed the recipe exactly and used it on t-bones steaks, marinated them for about  4hrs.
I found it to vinegary and my family found the soya sauce was very powerful, not  sure if i would make it again.

Perhaps a low five for us, but we lost our favorite marinade recipe (*gasp!*), and .... this is really close. Perhaps with a few tweaks to this recipe, we'll find the right adjustment to fit what we are used to, but this is awfully close to what we lost.....

Oh what a joy finding this recipe. I’m not a cook...but I’m trying hard, however I impressed my family with my rib eye steak. I followed this recipe and marinated my steak overnight and the result was just great. Everybody enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. This is a keeper.

Not a fan. We live in Mexico half the year and the beef is often tough and flavorless.  I thought this would help tenderize and flavor the rib eyes. Very very tender but we absolutely did not like the flavor.  We often grill steaks and this marinade did not cut it. Two stars because it did a great job tenderizing

This is excellent!!   I let my steak marinade for two days and cooked it in the oven for 1 hour at 400.  It was some of the tenderest, best tasting steak I’ve ever eaten.  My kids licked their plates!

Great recipe. I marinade sirloin steaks for 3 hours and grilled them on a gas BBQ on high for 3 minutes on each side and they came out tender with excellent flavor. No additional salt was needed for the marinade. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent! I made this marinade according to the recipe. However, I did not marinate my steak as long as some said in the comments; only an hour and a half. Nevertheless, the steak came out wonderfully flavorful. Thanks for sharing.

I used this marinade on some sirloin steaks for a group of farmers. I have never marinated steaks before so was a little worried how they would turn out. I got so many compliments and the steak turned out awesome!!  I will definitely be using it again and again!

Very tasty, I love what it did to the sirloin I bought at my local market.  I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used a little dry mustard.  Used garlic powder because I was too hungry to chop garlic!  This was delicious and my son and I devoured it.

I marinated 2 1/2 pounds of London Broil cut into strips across the grain for 6 hours in this for six hours and then skewered them. Grilled them on foil and they were perfect. Even every picky kid loved them. I did not use any salt.

This is the best.  Made per recipe and my husband and I thought the steaks were the best ever.  I used top sirloin filet, which is an inexpensive cut of meat, and the steaks were tender and delicious.

I made this as directed and vacuum sealed it for three hours.  Was a great steak.  Would also be good to seal and freeze fresh meats for a quick fix.  Just thaw.

I thought I rated this years ago. This really is the best and I am one who believes that a good steak can stand on its own.  Make sure you use low sodium  soy sauce. Makes all the difference!

Super tasty! We used it on a top sirloin steak and I think it helped with the tenderness.

After reading previous reviews, I added 2 tsps of brown sugar. Marinated for 5 hours and steaks were unbelievably tender. Definitely will make again but maybe add a bit more brown sugar as my husband found the vinegar taste a bit strong.

Marinated 2 rib steaks for 3 hours. Grilled them and reduced the marinade for a delicious sauce. We both loved it! Made no changes to the recipe. Did not add any salt.

Very very amazing! The only thing I did change was not putting olive oil at all! And adding Knorr Liquid Seasoning substitute for low sodium soy sauce.... however the saltiness was just right to my taste. Really recommend!!!!

I didn't beleive the reviewer who said they wept with joy but decided to try this anyway because I ran out of my usual spices. Wow. Like, seriously. I created this allrecipes account just to make this review.  

Doubled the recipe for 6 sirloin steaks. Marinating time 15 minutes at tropical room temp. Not enough worc sauce, so I added 2 tbs mirin. Don't ask me why. Half of the vinegar is sherry instead of balsamic because i picked up the wrong bottle the second time round (as you can tell, doubling the recipe was done on the fly). Dijon mustard is probably short of the amount in the recipe (3 instead of 4 tbs, after doubling up).

I let this marinate for about 6 hours. I followed the recipe as is, I did mistakenly put more garlic in here...  though the taste was not altered at all.  It tasted great, and I didn't even need steak sauce. I will defiantly make this a keeper.

Yes, didn't have Dijon mustard, but I had mustard seeds.  I crushed them using mortar and pestle and put into the marinade and also rubbed some of the marinade on the steaks so they would have the crushed mustard seeds on them.  I also substituted lemon juice for the vinegar, because I love, love lemon.  I also love vinegar but just wanted to use lemon.  Out of this world yummy good.

I’ve been using this marinade for over a year and I LOVE it!!  I see that most people marinade for a few hours but I like to marinade mine for significantly longer. Normally about 48 hours. I use a covered Pyrex in the fridge and flip the ribeyes a couple times a day. Not gonna lie ... I’ve gone even longer than that before because ... life happens and I’m not tossing a couple thick cut Greenwise angus ribeyes. Lol. They are still good but the balsamic vinegar will begin to overpower the steaks at some point. The USDA deems 5 days safe so I’m very comfortable with 2.

We've tried this twice in the past two weeks using hanger steak; marinating overnight in a Ziploc bag and then 3-5 minutes each side on the barbecue at medium-high heat. Delicious!

I was really looking forward to this recipe with all the wonderful reviews. I followed directions to the letter and when I tasted the marinade, I didn't feel like it was the greatest. But I thought maybe once it marinates in the steak it might taste better. NOT. It was the most BLAND flavor I have EVER tasted on a steak. I wasted "4" Ribeye Steaks!! I threw them in the trash!!

This recipe made my steaks tender and so full of flavor we didn't even have to addd any spices before cooking.  Soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce all compliment the overall outcome.  I did add liquid smoke for the smoky flavor . This will be my go to for all my steaks!!!! Love this!!

A great marinade, I used it on rib steaks.  It was the best bbq steak I've had in years!  I made no changes to the recipe.

I did this marinade about 2 days ago, for very lean sirloin steaks to marinate in,inside a zip-lock bag.  It did about 5 good sized steaks. We grilled them on the BBQ.  Only beef (pun) was we might have overcooked a little to long the thinner steaks, the thick one was great with pink interior.   It worked well, I did whiz all ingredients in the blender, used a lot more minced garlic, and tried the red wine vinegar with it.  No salt needed, we used Aminos Soy, which is natural, and less sodium, and black pepper.  Everyone loved it this fourth of July!

Made the meat tender and great! I used it on rump steak a normally tough cut of meat. I marinated it for 5 hours or so and left it out of fridge last two hours. After reading others recommendations I slightly reduced the vinegar and oil amounts. Would make again!

I have a very picky eater for a husband. I made this for our wedding anniversary. Nervous about the outcome, I did what one review said and used basalmic vinegar instead. OMG he loved it and so did I. The flavor was out of this world.

This was a great marinade, we used a balsamic vinaigrette in place of the vinegar and oil and added chopped onion. Marinated for about 18 hours. So tender and flavor was great! Will definitely make this again!

Too much vinegar for my taste, I used half the amount and low salt soy for the other half.  It was great, I split the recipe and used half for marinating fresh mushrooms.

1st time I made this, followed recipe almost exactly, just added a couple more cloves garlic and reduced oil a bit. thought it was very good but could taste the balsamic which  I didn't mind but hubby doesnt care for. Second time reduced balsamic by half and added 1 Tbsp. brown sugar and had a scant bit (like a rounded Tbsp) of Bulls eye bbq sauce left in a bottle so just threw that in there to get rid of it. and omited salt as soya sauce made it plenty salty. It was absolutely perfect for our taste and steaks were superb.  marinated steaks in ziploc bag in fridge for about 3 hrs each time.Deffinitely a keeper. Thanks for this recipe

I followed the recipe exactly, marinaded my steak for about three hours and it was horrible. I would not want to serve this to anyone. The balsamic vinegar was super overwhelming. I will not make this again.

This recipe was awesome!! The only thing I added was that I drizzled a little reduced balsamic vinegar and then used the remaining as a dipping sauce and it tasted amazing. Just heat up a 8 oz of balsamic vinegar, once it starts to boil, reduce the heat until it becomes more of a syrup than liquid. Great recipe! Definitely will make this again.

I marinated sirloin steaks for about 6 hours. They were so tender and juicy. What I really liked about it was that the taste of the marinate didn't overpower the taste of the meat. Will use again.

My husband is a beef lover and a purist who believes you should never mess with the taste of a good steak.  I talked him into letting me try this marinade, though, and he absolutely raved!  Told me I'd hit dinner outta the ballpark tonight!  I followed the suggestion and let the meat sit in the marinade for a good two hours, then put it on the grill.  The flavors enhanced the steak, made it more tender, and locked in the juices.  Made a believer out of both of us!

I've been using this basic recipe for several years and it's a winner. You can also add 2 TBSP  of Montreal's Steak seasoning and 2 TBSP of Italian seasoning to up the complexity of flavor. I often add a 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar as well. I put it all in a gallon size ziplock  bag with the steaks and turn it over  every few hours  as it chills in the fridge. Great as written here though. Beats almost any flavor I get out of local steak houses.

The absolute best marinade ever!!!  I made this recipe to a T and tried it on steak last week and today on pork chops.  Both times I only had it marinating for less than couple of hours.  I can't wait to let it marinate overnite.  My family loves it.   It is now my go-to marinade for any kind of meat. Thanks for sharing!

This is THEE BEST marinade recipe for steak the only thing I changed is I added brown sugar I would not marinade a ribeye because it's naturally? tender but I always use this marinade on strip steaks and top sirloin and any lean cut that has little marbling (the white fat on the outside barrier and through it)  it is superb it's my to go marianade any time I make shiskabobs or any lean beef  on the grill it not only flavors the meat but the veggies too on my shiskabobs

Have fixed this recipe "as is" and have served it many times now.  Our guests go crazy for it and all ask for the recipe themselves.  It is also a great tenderizer.  I don't add salt as that can be added at the table.  We find reasons to use this marinade now on several dishes.   "Love" it!!!  Enjoy!

I would rate it a 4 1/2 star, as I did make a change.  I added 1 Tbsp maple syrup for some slight sweetness.  Although, I only marinaded the recipe for 30 minutes, it was still delicious.  It is definitely a "make again" recipe in our household.

This is my go-to marinade of choice. I generally prefer to use less oil. And from experience, I know that if I want to change up the marinade, I only need to tweak the proportions (I've made the marinade not realizing until too late that I didn't have enough of one ingredient or another - still ended up phenomenal!)

The title for this recipe is dead on. I never leave reviews, but I have to comment on how amazing this steak marinade is. I follow the recipe to a T, but I also make sure to add a lot of grilled onions. :) As long as you're not sensitive to salt, this recipe is to die for.

I made this marinade today but had no Dijon mustard on hand so just skipped that item. And didn't use salt as the soy sauce is plenty salty. Our one large ribeye was so delicious after marinating for about 4 hours. I'll be using this recipe for marinating steak often.

Great flavor!  My entire family loved it.  I used New Yorks and a Sirloin--3 big steaks, and marinaded them in a ziplock bag for 5 hours.

So, I've only made this recipe once.  I made it for a summer dinner party for 10 last month.   We all agreed that this is one of the BEST marinades ever.  I marinated flank steaks that I served sliced on a big platter with grilled sweet red/orange/yellow peppers as an accompaniment.   Best dish of the summer!

I used the recipe as stated and it was simply delicious. I am a steak lover and this marinade tenderized the steak to an unbelievable level, (I did grill a filet minion however) and the taste made my tongue slap my brain. Simply delicious.

Wow, this is really good!  and it's so  simple.  This is a manly marinade, the mustard comes out with a bit of soy and almost makes it taste like a really high quality hot dog, just very rich and unlike anything else you'll taste...this already jumped over the other top rated marinade on google..

We love this marinade with a very good quality balsamic vinegar.  I marinade for 5 hours minimum. It's great with tri tip roast which I am doing again this month. The first one was so good our company loved it!!!  We can't wait to have leftovers this time as I sent them home with our young married couple for the next day,

I followed the direction  exactly as it says,i went easy on salt,but the portion of vinegar made my steak  too sour..I made an experimention by marinating my steak the whole night and marinating some for 2 hours,it appears that marinating the whole night is better,more tender and more tasty. Not bad at all!!

I LOVE THIS MARINADE!!!!! I am a 24 year old guy and I love steak. I've never cooked it in my life. I usually like to order steaks when I go out to restaurants but I have NEVER had a steak as delicious and savory as this one. Best steak I ever made for myself. All I did was go to my local grocery store,  bought 4 strips of  rump steaks for almost 20 bucks, mixed all the ingredients in a gallon ziplock bag and threw two steaks in to one and another two in another bag. We let one pair of steaks marinate for one hour, the other for 2 hours. There was extra marinade to add in for mid cooking. OH!! I cooked it on the stovetop on med-high heat for about 5-7 minutes each side! So no grill necessary!! 

I added a teeny tiny bit of cilantro at the end... And I ate my heart  out. I appreciate this recipe so very much.

The key to this marinade is using a good balsamic vinegar.  I bought the cheap stuff the first time and it was only ok.  Then, I got gifted some really good stuff.  Wowza, what a difference!  I have used this recipe a few dozen times over several years, so even the mid-range balsamic will do.  Marinating all day is ideal, but even an hour and you have one amazingly yummy steak!

I made it as  directed, marinated meat for 16 hours, steaks were delicious, tender and got rave reviews from all 9 dinner guests. I did double the recipe due to volume of steaks and took the advise of another recipe user to make a steak sauce using the marinade and cornstarch. Sauce was delicious!

This was ok, but nothing that we found to be awesome.  I made recipe exactly as stated, but did not add extra salt as I knew we would be fine with the salt from the soy sauce.

Great taste. I buy good sized cuts of steak, and this recipe is a bit on the small side. So I double all ingredients except for the balsamic vinegar. It makes for a great steak, even if you're missing an ingredient or two.  I would recommend to all.

I am not a big meat eater but I would gobble down any piece of meat if it was marinated in this!  So delicious!  I didn't find it vinegary at all. As one reviewer suggested I left out the oil and meant to put it on the steak before barbecuing but forgot. It didn't seem to lack anything but I will try to remember doing that next time. I also applied another suggestion to top it with blue cheese butter. That was a nice addition too!  My husband loved it.  Thank you for the great recipe. This is now my go to marinade!

I used this marinade on 1.5 inch boneless shell steak.  I made no changes and let it set overnight in a ziploc bag.  I flipped the bag before I went to bed.  After pulling them out, I patted them dry, stuck them in an oven on a cooling rack setting on a cookie sheet at 250, adding a bit of garlic and herb butter to the steak at 100 degree, until the internal temperature was 130.  I wrapped and rested for 10-15 minutes.  Using a cast iron skillet, I seared both sides for 30-45 seconds.  Plate and add course black pepper and course sea salt.  By far.....the best steak me and my family ever had.  Happy Mother's Day.

My personal favourite is to rub salt and oregano 1hr before cooking and to brush a little olive oil just before putting the meat on the grill.

However, this recipe produces a nice flavour, here are my changes:
- no garlic (I find it overpowers everything else).
- no oil in the marinate; add it just before cooking.
- replace vinegar with a little lemon juice or red wine.

I used all the ingredients listed but I did have the time to marinade the  meat for 2 hours. I sliced the top sirloin thin then marinaded it for one hour. I then used a grill pan to cook the steaks. Wonderful!!!! My husband is a very picky eater and he wants me to make this again tomorrow. Thank you for saving my night!

Love this marinade.  I use it with chuck eye steaks which I then cook in a cast iron grill pan on the stove.  I have made it with regular yellow mustard when I had no dijon and it is still delicious!  Whole family loves it!

I made this as written and loved it (except salt: I never add salt when there is soy sauce)!  I put some thin, cheaper cuts of steak in the marinade the evening before, then rolled them around asparagus & slices of peppers & grilled.  It was a hit with my family.  This is a keeper! I've uploaded a photo of my roll-ups prior to grilling.

Very good.  I used it on a NY strip, which normally is not my favorite cut of steak, but this marinade made it much better. I tasted it before putting it on the steak and thought it a little vinegar-ee for me, so just added some more of the other ingredients.  That's the only adjustment I made. This is much better than dumping Italian dressing on this or any cut of steak. Thanks for sharing.

Just reading the ingredients made it jump out to me.  To be honest, after tasting the marinade after blending,  I wasn't so sure if I was CRAZY about it...but gave it a shot anyways.  The marinade definitely tasted a lot better than the one I had just wasted down the drain that had 2k likes.  I only had 1hr to marinate a 1" ribeye and wish it had marinated even longer.  Great flavor on the outside and in the fat.  Made as written and will definitely make again!

Wonderful go to marinade for not only steak but I have tried it on chicken and pork.  Family of four absolutely love it.  Only recommendation is to limit additional salt added. Once I added additional salt and the meat became to salty for my taste.

I found this marinade tasty but too overpowering. A marinade should enhance the flavor of the meat, not take it over.

I would give it 5 stars but sadly I was unable to make as written. The only ingredient I did not have was the soy sauce so I made it omitting it. We loved the flavor! I will definitely use the recipe again and try it with soy sauce as well.

I made this for my wife & daughter 3 weekends ago.  The only difference was that I used this marinade for bone-in, skinless chicken thighs on the grill.  I'm not sure how much time I have to tell you how Amazing it turned out for them as I forgot where I saved this & I'm supposed to be marinating right now!  I did marinate for 24 hrs. & tweaked a few things only because I'm a guy and you 5-star people never invite me to dinner!

I made this but did not have dijon mustard so substituted 2 tsp of mild Jamaican jerk and about 2 tbsp of brown sugar. I marinated portabella mushrooms and steak and it was amazing.

If you don't know anything about balsamic vinegar, use balsamic vinaigrette, then, use the leftover to mix with mushrooms that you simmer. I rarely eat steak any other way! Simply awesome. If you want to play with a flavor for a change, use a flavored balsamic, or season with only white pepper. This really is the base for the best marinade....and I normally hate marinades. Simple and quick, too!

This is by far the best steak marinade that I have ever used! It is my go to now--I'll never have to go out to the restaurant to order steak again, because it tastes so much better now at home!! Just be careful with the balsamic vinegar. More expensive brands that are aged longer are much stronger and may require a little less (about 25% less) particularly if you are leaving it to marinate overnight. Thanks for a great recipe!

By total chance I had all of the ingredients in the house (although I did subsititute Henderson's Relish for Worcestershire Sauce). Just time to marinade my steak for 2 hours. Did it on the barby. Perfect. Far better than I expected if I'm honest.

The best marinade ever!  Family loved it, simple to make, and great flavor even after a short marinating time.  I think you could even use this with chicken or pork. Will definitely make this again.

This marinade was delicious! I expected it to be sour or vinegary like some mentioned, but ours tasted juicy and delicious can't exact describe the flavor but exactly how I would want a steak to taste. Hubby said the "Steak was really good" and " What steak marinade did I use".  Will definitely use again. (I liked that it wasn't sweet most of the store bought marinades come out tasting sweet or making the meat taste like hotdogs.

It's a great marinade.   I think next time instead of the garlic I'll add some Montreal Steak Spice which will probably jazz it up a bit more.  Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing!

I made this marinade 3 weeks ago for dinner for my Mom and she absolutely LOVED her steak. So much that she ate two. Which is really rare for her to even finish eating one steak.  I'd never cooked steak before, but have eaten tough steak. This steak was delicious and the best steak I've eaten ever! I owe it all to this marinade and look forward to using it again! Thanks for sharing!

New LOVE!  Trying something different turned into a new FAV!  My hubby and son said I have to make it again.  No steak sauce for this family!  
Didn't use dijon mustard.  And used only a few drops of oil as to let the meat get more tender.  Will need to try it with dijon next time!

There were a lot of mixed reviews so I wasn't sure what to expect,, I marinated a flank steak with this for about 8 hours then grilled it on the barbeque, it was delicious !!  I did the 1/4 cup of everything listed except no oil and as one suggested added 1 tbl of liquid hickory smoke,, I only added a bit of meat tenderizer being it was a good sized steak,, definitely saving this to the recipe box,, I think it might be too strong for a thin steak or chicken but on a flank was perfect !!

pretty much followed the recipe exact.  I used low sodium soy because it had for extra salt in recipe.  I did this for a sirloin tri tip.  Marinaded for 24 plus hours.  I roasted the steak in the oven following some general roasting directions.  Was wonderful taste and tender.  I will use again for london broil and tri tips that need marinades.  I think it might be more than needed on a good rib eye but it could work.  Thanks for a great marinade

This marinade is very good. I had to make do with what I had swapping the balsamic vinegar for raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar and adding 2tsp. liquid smoke it still was a wonderful marinade. Will definitely use again.

This is a great! A couple things I change is I don't use the oil and I put more dijon mustard in it. I even have marinated chicken in it many times... so good!

This is the best low carb beef marinade I have tried. I put 1/3 C olive oil, 1/2 C balsamic vinegar, 1/2 C Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 C Dijon mustard in a 1 gallon ziploc bag. I then generously seasoned a package of two tri tip steaks from Costco with Montreal Steak seasoning and rubbed the seasoning into meat. I placed both steaks in the ziploc mixture and marinated them for about 2 hours. This marinade tasted great! I liked how the subtle sweetness of the balsamic vinegar came through without overpowering the meat. No extra sweetening ingredient such as. sugar, honey or molasses was needed.

Just love it! have made it on numerous ocassions now and always comes out perfect, but I do leave out the oil until it's on the grill as another member noted (marinade doesn't penetrate as well with oil). My wife isn't a a steak fan which is tough because I love a juicy steak once a week or so. The toughest part is she likes her steak well done (sheesh), so it's tough to make it taste nearly as good as my med rare steak. But this marinade produces a deep flavor throughout, even if it's well done! Takes 2 min but just so worth it. Thanks for the great recipe. cheers!

I prepared 4 juicy fillet steaks using this marinade recipe for our Son's special birthday meal and it really was absolutely delicious. I made the marinade up and marinated the steaks in the fridge 4 hours before removing to rest for afew hours before cooking. The steaks were really moist and tasted divine.....Will look forward to using this again for our first bbq of 2015, as I think this would be a winner over hot rocks....enjoy :)

Have used this now three times with very good results.  Recipe makes more than enough for do two steaks, so boke it into two portions, using one to marinade current steak and saving the rest in the refrigerator for next bbq.  Worked fine!

This was a good marinade.  Very simple and delicious.  I found that you only really need to marinate for about 4 hours or so.  It doesn't take long to soak in.  Also, adding chopped scallions after you turn your stake over for the last time was a nice touch with the flavor of this marinade.

Loved this. I was using a cheap sirloin cut and marinated it for 3 or 4 hours. The only change I made was that I was out of balsamic vinegar, so I used Nonna Pia's Strawberry/Fig Balsamic Reduction (sweet and thick) that I had in the cupboard. I used half as much as the recipe called for. Did not add salt because our soy sauce (China Lily) is very salty.

No vinegar taste reported by anyone, but using the reduction, I suppose that makes a lot of sense.

While my husband barbecued the steaks, I stirred some corn starch into the remaining marinade and boiled it down for serving at the table. Lovely poured over the steak.

Great marinade!!! Only downfall was it had a very salty taste. Next time I might go easy on the soy sauce and might add some brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe to use on a 2 lb. sirloin and left it in the fridge all day. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes for a little heat, but it was delicious just the way it is.

This is absolutely delicious!!  
I had to make a minor change....I didn't have Soy Sauce so I changed it to low sodium Teriyaki Sauce. 
Other than that I did it right by the recipe.  
The Balsamic Vinegar gives it a much better quality than just simply using Red Wine Vinegar. 
I will definitely be using this as my go to beef marinade!!

This is the beat marinades I have ever tried. I made it just like the recipe said minus the hot sauce and garlic powder (because I was out). I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic in place of the garlic powder. I marinated for 5 hours. I dredged in flour and browned on both sides, then baked at 350 degrees for one hour. I topped with sliced mushrooms and onions that were also marinated. Delish!! I don't think I'll use another marinade.

This marinade was delicious.  I put the steak in the marinade and let it sit in the refrigerator for a day or two and then threw it in the freezer.  I defrosted a few days later and broiled it to medium.  Topped with gorganzola and served with garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed asparagus.  Was an amazing dinner.

I used this on a T-bone tonight!  I marinated for about 4 hours.  The flavor of the steak was great!  I feel on my part I could have added a touch more salt, but it's kind of hard to taste a marinade (blech) so my fault.  This did get eaten up and it was delicious!

I've really never done a steak well. I tenderized my steak, marinaded it with this, seared on each side for 2-3 min. On a high grill, cooked till medium well on medium heat, and let sit covered for 10-15 minutes. Everyone loved it! This is my new go to.

I apologize for accidentally uploading my pic instead of one of the steak I cooked...but in my delirium over the pure exquisite taste of this marinade, I made a mistake. This is by far the best marinade EVER!

I HAVE PREPARED THIS MARINADE SEVERAL TIMES AND WE REALLY ENJOY IT.   I MAKE NO CHANGES TO IT AND IT'S PERFECT EVERY TIME.  TONIGHT WE HAD VENISON TENDERLOIN AND IT WAS DELICIOUS.  IT'S A KEEPER.

Yes I tried it, I didn't have any balsamic, so I used just plain vinegar, but only half of what was called for. We loved it, very nice flavour, a little sweet, must be the Dijon, very good. Will definitely try this with ribs also. Thanks for sharing.

Simplistic recipe yet taste was far from simple - I prepared this for the pickiest eater on the planet & not only did he love it but devoured it leaving my lunch for the next day well non-existent which is the best compliments to the chef I suppose.  The only thing I didn't add was salt since I figured the soy sauce had that domain covered.  I've added this one to my recipe box & fully intend to prepare it again, well done SweetCravings!!!

This was ok, I let it go for 2 hours, maybe should've let it sit longer. I would cut back on the vinegar if I used this again.

Great flavor and had rave reviews from relatives at my BBQ.  I substituted heaping teaspoons of spicy brown mustard for the Dijon and the steaks were incredible.  This is definitely a keeper!

My daughter said these were the best steaks she had every had.  They were tender and had lots of flavor.  I used Porterhouse.  I did add the salt and pepper directly to the steaks instead of the marinade. I marinated for 3hrs and after cooking I took the marinade and made a sauce by adding some butter and cornstarch to thicken.  Many of the other comments mentioned being to salty or vinegary but I didn't think so. I would recommend putting the sauce on the side instead of directly on the steaks for there I could see them being overpowering on those levels.  This way each person uses as they need.  Will use again!

This is the best steak marinade I have ever tried. I've tried it on many different types of steaks and they all turned out amazing!  I would definitely recommend letting the steaks marinade for at least two hours as the recipe states.  It is worth the wait!

FANTASTIC!  I didn't have worchesterchire sauce, so I left it out.  Even without the worchesterchire this marindade is awesome.  The steak was so tender and flavourful.  For once my husband didn't slather his steak in BBQ sauce.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I cut the olive oil in half and subbed sesame oil for it, left out the vinegar (mostly cause I didn't have any), and added a little teriyaki sauce. The sesame oil gave it a nice aroma and great flavor. I almost had to laugh at myself for how good it was. Adding the garlic and mustard was what topped it off though. I'm going to try adding red pepper flakes to it next time to see how it changes things. But overall, SO GOOD!!!!!

I used balsamic vinegar and left out the salt (figured soy sauce and worchester would be salty enough and I was right) I added a little lime juice and chili paste because we like a bit of tang and heat. I also added tsp of smokey hungarian paprika for a little extra smoke .. the marinade tastes good by itself - the steaks are marinating now and I'm looking forward to eating them later.

This was SO YUMMY!! We put steaks in to marinate the night before and cooked them about 24 hours later - DELICIOUS recipe. I really liked this on the thicker cut steak - it was a little strong in flavor on the thinner pieces but really perfect for a thick cut of meat.

The marinade smelled great, but it didn't have any taste. It was bland and gave me a false hope that my husband wouldn't go for the barbecue sauce.

I LOVED THIS!!! I'm making this for the third time and planing to give everyone a bite of my amazing steak at tonight's Braai!!! I did a variation of this recipe where i added honey to it instead of the balsamic. Both are equally yummy.

We don't typically marinate steaks, but, wanted to try something a little different.   This was really flavorful!   I reduced the soy sauce slightly so it wouldn't be too salty.   I marinated about 2 hours, but, next time would probably marinate a few more hours.   Definitely will be using this again!

Had a nice steak and wanted to marinade it for a stir-fry and didn't have dijon mustard but had horseradish mustard and the steak just burst with  flavor.. Personalizing recipes is a favourite thing for me to do and this just worked very well.

My wife and I tried this marinade today.  We mixed it up and let it marinate for 3 hours.  This marinade produced the juicest steaks we have ever made at home.  We would highly recommend it.

Deeeelicious! Balsamic vinegar adds the perfect amount of tang and sweetness to this recipe. I did not find the vinegar flavor too strong. All my husband and I talked about during dinner was how delicious the marinade was.

This is good as it is, but the second time around, I added some fresh basil, 1 tsp of ground ginger, 1 tsp cayanne pepper, and 1/4 cup pulp free orange juice....add everything to the blender for 30 seconds.

If your a flavor loving person as I am, you will enjoy adding these extra ingrediants it adds a little bit to it that changes alot and adds to the palate!!

I just made this, while watching the NCAA hoops started it at the start of the first game and let it marinate for about  6 hrs... Very GOOD...  I made it as written and it turned out Great... I used a bone in rib eye, served it with a lobster tail... It was a great memorable meal...  Another good marinate to add to the recipe book... THANKS

I was dieing to find a truly good marinade for my steaks since dear husband and I like steaks totally different. We both loved it. I added fresh thyme and fresh oregano just because I had bought it for another recipe. I loved it!

This was sooooooo good.  I used a little less balsamic vinegar than called for and i didn't have any mustard.  Marinated steaks for about 6 hours, and the flavor was amazing.  This will be my staple steak marinade!

I love this marinade! It may not be the best (as others have stated), but it is the simplest. The only difference I made was that I rubbed my steaks in my own secret recipe of spices before adding the marinade. It came out delicious!

Absolutely delicious marinade!  We just made this steak marinade two weeks ago for the first time and have already made it again.  I love that it requires ingredients that I typically have in the pantry and that it keeps the steak moist while grilling!

I didn't try this exactly, I used cider vinegar and omitted the soy sauce, but it still turned out well.  The flavor was good and the meat was nice and tender.

I cut my sirloin steak into strips for salad. Only changes was the use of grainy Dijon mustard and a teaspoon of garlic powder in lieu of regular Dijon and minced garlic. I marinated my meat overnight. I overcooked it by accident, but it still tasted fine. Nothing special, though so I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

This was an excellent, very easy marinade.  I didn't have Dijon on hand, so I used yellow mustard, but I am certain the Dijon would make it even better.

This was really good, we marinated a london broil for about 5 hours. The kids asked me what I did different and they said the flavor was awesome. We will surely use this marinade again. Thanks

Huge hit at our house! My kids said it was the BEST steak I had ever made! I made the recipe as written & marinated 3 ribeyes for 3 hrs.
