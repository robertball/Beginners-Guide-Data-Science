I LOVE simple pasta dishes like this! Very easy to prepare and uses ingredients that most of us have on hand at all times. I suggest not putting the entire teaspoon of seasoned salt, but just sprinkle to taste b/c I found that I only needed a fraction of what was called for. This would make a great side dish or I could even see adding some grilled shrimp to this for a great, light summer meal. This is a definite keeper for us~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

All my favorite traits in a recipe: fast,easy, delicious! It was a better, homemade version of the garlic and herb pasta roni...next time I will try angel hair, add Parmesan and double or triple the recipe!! I didn't read the servings before starting so it was gone too fast!!!

I think this was an excellent recipe. However, I made one addition of Parmesan cheese and it was delicious! :) Will definitely make this again!

Delicious. I originally did this by the book, but it was too much butter for me. I made it for a whole pound of pasta and most recently used angel hair. I did 3/4 cup of butter, a cup of chicken broth, and only 1/2 tbsp of seasoned salt. I also made it with caramelized onion, broccoli, and chicken. Big hit.

This recipe is simple and easy  but also packed wth flavour. I found I had to increase amounts in all the ingredients as I like my pasta really well coated. Also I increased the amount of garlic added but thatâ€™s just too my personal taste.

I made a double batch. Super simple to make and tastes great!  I'm not a salt person, so I let the fam add their own to their liking.

I needed a side dish for my Parmesan chicken & I didn't want to make some boxed noodle dish, so I made this Garlic-Herb Linguine & my family loved it--especially with the linguine noodles. It was easy & favorable.
