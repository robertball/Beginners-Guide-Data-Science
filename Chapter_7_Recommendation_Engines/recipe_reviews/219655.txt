Very close to our old family recipe. We've always used round steak, pounded very thin.  You gotta serve this with grits, though!  Actually, it's an old traditional breakfast dish, from plantation days. Thanks for posting this!

I learned to cook from my grandmother who was raised in the South.  She add okra to all her soups and stews.  So I added whole dried "mini" okra to mine, and let it cook for an extra hour, and it was fantastic!!

I added about a cup more oil and made a thicker roux.  Absolutely Fantastic.  Also used thin cut pork Grillades not beef.

This was delicious!  My husband told me it was company worthy.  I added only one can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers instead of two.  I sauteed the beef and later the onion and peppers in the Instant Pot and then at the end pressure cooked everything for 35 minutes.  I also made grits to pour it over.  We loved the texture from that mixture.  YUM!
