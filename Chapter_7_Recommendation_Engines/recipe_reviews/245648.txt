I  AM POSTING BECAUSE THE MOST HELPFUL CRITICAL REVIEW IS INCORRECT!  TRY THIS! (in my eyes; none of that happened when I  followed the recipe exactly) I have made it twice now and would definitely make it again- doubling and cutting the recipe in half worked great. I also tried both evaporated and regular milk, both of which will work fantastic.. I've seen many similar reviews on here but wanted to write this one because this is so good and simple anyone can do it, The most critical review that says they put the sauce in the fridge and it separated/didn't taste right almost stopped me from making this after I didn't listen reviews on a brownie recipe and having bad results. THAT'S NOT THE CASE!  Maybe it was the heavy cream, maybe she put it in the fridge warm/hot (always cool everything before refrigerating). Or maybe she just didn't cook it long enough as  2 minutes isn't the total cooking time. After bringing it to a full boil and cooking, it took more like 5-7 minutes which made it just right. It stayed perfect in the fridge. Great texture before and after refrigeration; just like a caramel dipping sauce. Just a little microwaving and its ready to drizzle. SO glad I made this. Literally so simple and tastes just like the caramel sauce on the french  roast at iHop!

We used Evaporated milk… Doubled the recipe and It came out amazing. Everyone loves it! Only thing is, I believe this is actually butterscotch sauce. What I have read is that caramel sauce is made with white sugar and butterscotch is made with brown. FYI!

I made this to go with bread pudding as a Christmas dinner dessert.   Sauce was easy to make.  I made it ahead of time then just heated it up.   The combo was a hit with everyone - even our 'non dessert' eaters.  Thanks!

a snap to prepare, rich and good.  the only thing I did differently was to brown the butter slightly for a deeper caramel flavor, before adding the other ingredients.  I didn't have milk so used fat free half and half and it was perfect.  so many uses.  I made it to pour as a glaze over an apple cake.  thanks for this easy recipe with great flavor!  a keeper.

I made it just as specified in the recipe and found it was a bit thin, even after it had cooled. I reheated and boiled it another 3 minutes and that helped. It is good tasting, but next time I will use evaporated milk or cream as others suggest, and hope it will be a bit thicker.

I love caramel!  I made this recipe as stated.  The end product tasted wonderful!  But it had a grainy texture when it wasn't hot.  I looked that up, and it may have been caused by stirring it.  The recipe doesn't say to stir it, just to bring it to a boil...I just assumed it was supposed to be stirred until it was smooth.  Apparently stirring causes the sugar to crystallize.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I won't stir it.  The flavor is incredible, even with the sugar crystallized .

This sauce is incredible! Very easy to make, took me maybe 5 minutes. It tastes amazing as well! The recipe called for 1/4 cup of milk, but I substituted about of a quarter of that with heavy whipping cream! I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I just used the butter, milk, and brown sugar as I followed the directions(heating my sauce to about 225 Fahrenheit). I cannot believe how simple, yet ambrosial this recipe is! It's so rich and buttery... definitely a keeper.  I drizzled this over some apple slices and sprinkled with a small amount of coarsely ground pink salt for an extra "kick" in flavor. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Made this sauce with no deviations, and it made for an excellent topping for homemade flan. My family loved it, and this will now be my go-to recipe when making flan, as the consistency was perfect for what I needed it for, and the flavor was delicious! Since first making this recipe, I have discovered that it also goes WONDERFULLY in a mug of hot Earl Grey tea! Just added a couple spoonfuls, stirred, and found myself enjoying a cup of pure heaven!! This sauce refridgerates well with no separation, and a few seconds in the microwave brings it right back to drizzling goodness! This sauce is so quick & simple to make, it's become my new guilty pleasure, as I'm slightly ashamed to admit that I've been caught eating it straight from a spoon! I only say "slightly ashamed" as I do cardio daily, which helps burn off any indulgences I may occasionally succumb to! With these ingredients, it's not the healthiest thing one could be snacking on, and my health-nut husband teases me about this, but I'll be damned if it's not delicious!!

I made this yesterday and used heavy cream instead of milk. After it cooled I put it in the refrigerator  so I could add a spoonful to my morning coffee. Well it separated and didn't taste like caramel at all. It tasted more like butter. I cooked it for the right amount of time also.

I loved how this turned out for me!! The second time I made it, I added a bit of sweetened condensed milk and salt for a more traditional flavour and feel. Currently my favorite go to ice cream sauce.

This was a very easy and tasty caramel sauce. The only problem I had with it was it crystalized quickly which may have my own fault because I added a little too much brown sugar,otherwise, wonderful recipe!

PLEASE HELP.. I’ve tried making this twice now and it turns into really thick grainy paste and NOT a sauce. I’m using the exact measurements and ingredients specified as well. I’ve even watched the video and it still turns out horrible and inedible. What am I doing wrong?

Didn't actually thicken until I took it off the heat. I probably watched for it to thicken for about 10 minutes.  It's pretty sweet, but I think it'll still be good with brownies and ice cream.

When I read this recipe, I knew that 1/2 cup of margarine was too much.  I used only 1/4 cup of margarine and it was SO good. Let your mi xture boil for at least 2 minutes.  After adding the vanilla,  set the pan in sink of cold water and stir until cooled. Very good when made with the right amount of  margarine.

I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe to the letter and, while the sauce was tasty, it was gritty because the sugar didn't melt.   I used 2% milk.

Very good! Would probably make it again! Made a slight change  - I couldn't get it to thicken so I added a little icing sugar and flour (max 1 tbsp of each!) and that seemed to help! I used this over top of a white cake that I had made, but didn't feel like icing! Delicious!

Good flavor.  It was a bit thin as people said - even after I used cream instead of milk.  I'll do it again and make modifications.  Good in a pinch though!

Used heavy whopping cream and cooked until sugar dissolves which is longer than 2 minutes. Might get rid of the grainy issue somebody mentioned

Because this is actually a recipe for butterscotch, I've always switched out the brown sugar for white and made scrumptious caramel sauce. Today I followed the recipe, substituting cream for milk as always, and now I have sweet and silky butterscotch sauce to top my cookies!!!

I've never been a fan of Caramel,  But making it from scratch has chas changed my  thinking. 
I'll make it verses buying ..It's addicting.

Did we make changes- no. The question that needs to be asked is should’ve we have made changes? That answer is yes. The ratio of (optional) vanilla to karmal is quite staggered. A little on the moist side, my taste buds would’ve perferrerd a little more girth to the saucy compound. We are currently freezing to see if texture will unify, so far no results. Overall, based on our expertise in karmal tasting/ making we would...NOT make this again. Quite tasty, but sometimes apperence is important. This is a sometimes scenario. Although it’s not the best looking,  it will fulfill its duty of being drizzled over apples as a 1:20am munch. Thanks for the recipe...however I would do a little more research on the topic before sharing it with the professional karmal making/tasting community.

I needed easy and ingredients that I had on hand. (Did not have heavy whipping cream like other recipes call for.) This fit the bill! Didn't take too long to boil and finish even using a frozen stick of butter. I did use the vanilla. Needed this to make a samoa cupcake like recipe, and this got the job done. Appreciate the posted recipe!

I've made this to serve over brownies and vanilla ice cream, baked French toast bread pudding, bananas foster, and cinnamon rolls.   It is delicious!   Whatever you decide to call it, either butterscotch or caramel, it is wonderful!  I used cream and/ or heavy cream instead of milk and only used enough to bring the sugar and butter together and never had a problem with separation when rewarming on the stove.

I made this with coconut palm sugar because that was all I had on hand. It worked out great! It was more of a butterscotch but it was perfect! I drizzled some sauce over popcorn and added nuts and pretzels and mini choc chips!

I have always struggled with getting the perfect ratios for a basic caramel sauce. This recipe helped simplify things for me.

I tweaked it a bit by using half and half instead of milk. And a slightly higher ratio of butter and sugar. I added a few pinches of salt for depth. Unfortunately I didn't really measure accurately so I'll have to try again to get my preferred proportions perfect. (Say that five times fast. Ha!)

I also used raw/turbinado sugar instead of packed brown sugar. So the flavor was slightly different. 

I drizzled the sauce over some popcorn and popped it in the oven for a bit. Yum!

This was easy to make and tasty.  A second day I found it was a bit  grainy maybe due to something I did wrong.

Turned out great! Super easy & fast to make!  This was a very light caramel, not overly sweet like the ones you buy in a jar for ice cream.  Added a bit of salt to taste. I think I'm going to make my caramel sauce for now on since it's so easy!

This is such an easy recipe, that it's hard to believe that it would be so good! I made a slight change by using half and half cream instead of milk, just because I had some to use up, but it would be just as good with milk.  
Update: I found that the sauce went grainy after I put it in the fridge. Maybe my fault, I don't know, but I did reduce my rating to 4 stars because of this.

Despite the simple ingredients and prep time it still tasted pretty good! It was delicious over my pumpkin spice cheesecake. I boiled it for 7 minutes, added evaporated milk instead, and didn't stir to prevent the sugar from crystallizing.

Very easy to make ! I was actually skeptical about those recipe since I’ve always known the art of making caramel is difficult and not easy to master on a first try. However, I followed the directions and literally just let it sit there . There was no constant stirring involved needed to get that “right color”.  If you’re in a hurry this is surely the way to go.  The only thing I did different was I used evaporated milk. Also the timing it takes to thicken is very off.  It’s definitely more than 2 minutes. I had to stop and put it back to boil a few times to get it to a thick state. I would say it would have  taken about 12 minutes or so if I hadn’t stopped to check It.  I would suggest leave it to boil for 10min straight then remove pot from heat,  stir , and see if the consistency is how you want it to be. Good luck !

It tastes good but because the instructions are poor, and I believe that when you are giving recipe you should be explicit and specific as you can I lost two Stars off. 

I boiled it and boiled and boiled until it still wouldn't thicken! I stared at it for like 5 to 10 minutes stirring until I went to go read other reviews because it was not thickening only to find out that the only way for it to start thickening is to cool the sauce. 

Bottom line take the pan off the stove, put some cold water in the sink and stir until it's cool. 

Then it will have thickened.

Thanks for the recipe. I've made it a few times and it is lovely! I do use heavy cream, and cook the sugar in the butter for a bit before adding the milk. It gives it a deeper caramelized taste. It's spectacular.

Love it! So simple to make. I ran out of butter so I used half butter, half MOVE OVER BUTTER spread and about a teaspoon of coconut oil. Lol! Thats what I had on hand. Only had skim milk so that's why I added a bit of coconut oil to replace some fat.I also added a pinch of salt. This came out lovely. I also did cook it an additional few minutes because it was a tad thin. I will definitely make again!

This was soooo easy and quick to make! And it’s delish! Putting it on top of a banana cream pie! I halved the recipe and it came out perfect. I think the key is to know how you get to a rolling boil. Only took 2-3 minutes to thicken once it was at that low boil! Going to make it again for my bread pudding!

After searching for an easy caramel sauce I decided to go with this one! Seemed easy and I had all the ingredients (I used fat free milk btw). And it was easy! And it's GOOOD! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and only added 1/4 cup butter (1/2 cup is a lot of butter) which I heated in a sauce pan with the milk before I added it to a separate pot with the brown sugar. I then used a whisk to mix the butter and milk mixture into the brown sugar while over the heat. I then let it cook for 2 minutes without touching it.  Removed from heat after 2 minutes and put in a bowl. I whisked it a little more and let it sit for about 10 mins to thicken up. Its perfect! I also read this is a butterscotch not a true caramel because of the brown sugar, but I can't tell the difference.  Time to make my ice (butterscotch?) macchiato!

The recipe was good, easy to make and turned out good, not grainy or anything. It is a bit thinner than I’d like, I may try to re-boil it to see if that helps like another user suggested. HOWEVER, this is not caramel nor does it taste like caramel. If you want a recipe for BUTTERSCOTCH, then this is it. Other than that very pleased with the recipe.

I love to serve this sauce with apple wedges.  It's incredibly delicious as an ice cream topping or drizzled on apple pie!  I made one change that I believe  gives the sauce a smoother consistency.  I took out 2 tablespoons full of the brown sugar and added 2 tablespoons full of corn syrup.

I used this for on top of a cheesecake. Altered it abit to make sure it stayed on top of cake. Added 4 marshmallows during cooking stage. At slight cool stage I added 1/2 of coarse salt. Sweet and salty caramel sauce :). Followed xlyssbakedit  directions....no problems. I agree 5-7 mins of cooking. I stopped at 5 mins.

This sauce is terrible and tastes nothing like caramel. It is way too much butter and the brown sugar makes the sauce gritty. The butter separates to the top—even after it’s cooled.

Excellent! Truly simple and easy. Did minor modifications - cooked for 3 minutes because I wanted a bit thicker. I added 1/2 cup of half and half as opposed to the 1/4 cup of milk. And..this  I think really made it - a pinch of kosher salt. Really delicious and my friends raved over it!

I did exactly as it said, but it took me way,way longer than 1-2 minutes to thicken it. I didn't even get it to get thick, it just burned. I wish recipes told exactly how long it takes to thicken it!

I don't know what I did wrong but I made it twice and it turned out to be a gloopy mess both times I made it.  The caramel became very thick with a buttery film floating around it.  The caramel tasted good, but it was too thick to be a sauce and the separated butter just made it seems greasy.

I made this to pour over a Dutch apple pie and everyone thought it was the best caramel apple pie they've ever had. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk to make it more creamier. Thank you for this recipe.

I used evaporated milk, and added a teaspoon of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum in addition to the vanilla. I also stirred in a little bit of Fleur de Sal to give it that salted caramel flavor. This is a very delicious sauce that can be eaten right out of a spoon, or as a topping for ice cream, cake, bread pudding, etc. It's delicious and simple to prepare. Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly using vanilla extract, 2% milk, salted butter, and light brown sugar.  It was AMAZING! I added it to the top of cookies after they baked cause I love that chewy caramel texture once it cools.  I also added it to my hot cocoa. Yummy! I had to stop myself from eating it from the pan. :)

I chose this recipe because it looked easy and had just a few ingredients. I'm sure as is, it is probably amazing; but since we are always on a diet around here, I made several changes to accommodate what I had on hand. So I am basically sharing the changes I made.
Used white sugar, I Can't Believe Its Butter light, and fat free half & half. Did not stir once everything was combined as some here suggested, boiled for 3 minutes. Turned out fine, just what I needed to top my fat free brownies and light whipped topping! Thank you for sharing.

This was decadent. I forgot to add the vanilla and it was still very good. The recipe does not indicate the temperature at which to cook the sauce. I started at medium and stirred until sugar was dissolved. I wasn’t boiling so I turned it up to med high, but then when it began to boil it was too high(recipe states gentle boil) so I kept turning it down and picking up the pan to keep it under control. As other suggested I placed the pan in cold water to cool and it thickened.

O. M. G!!! This is too good. Someone in the re iews said this taste like butterscotch, I have to disagree, taste just like caramels you buy at store, even better, thank you for this recipe, I will never buy it again, this was so easy, I followed this recipe exactly and I love it ok I needed to add my 2 cents In here for a person, I won't give her name, but she said she didn't stir it, because recipe didn't say to, lol I'm sorry but common sense when you cooking with sugar, you have to stir it, did you watch the video? The uploader probably assumed everyone would know to stir it lol guess not everyone haha

This sauce is tasty but it is a butterscotch sauce, not caramel sauce. Caramel sauce is made with granulated sugar, not brown sugar. There is a taste difference.
I too had problems with the butter separating and a grainy texture.

I didnt have too much regular milk so I decided to give it a try with buttermilk. Caramel came out perfect. While it appears to be watery at first, after you boil it for more like 5-6 minutes vs 2 minutes in the directions it started to thicken up with the slow boil. After it cooled for a few minutes it was the perfect consistency.

After making this twice and having it turn out grainy, I did a few things differently and it came out great! First, I used a name brand brown sugar, which was noticeably finer than the generic I had used before. Also, I added a few tablespoons of light corn syrup to discourage crystallization. I stirred it only initially, then when the ingredients were mixed I stopped stirring. After it began to bubble, I gently swirled the pan to be sure it was heating evenly. I also used a candy thermometer. After about 5 minutes of cooking/bubbling, the temperature was 205 degrees. I removed the pan from the heat at this point, added the vanilla and cooled it before refrigerating. Smooth, no graininess, and great texture cold or hot!

This would be a great recipe....if you were making candy. I let it boil longer because it was the consistency of water. Then, once taken off the heat, it started to harden. Thankfully I was using it as part of a slow cooker recipe and was able to spoon it in but as it cooled it COMPLETED hardened. I've made caramel sauce before that was lucious and creamy but couldn't find the recipe. Clearly this one was not the one I used before.

I made this but cooked it far too long (15 mins) and the result was the most amazing caramel candy I've ever had! When warmed up it was perfect for drizzling over the apple pie I'd made but it was also really good just out of the container I put it in. Absolutely will use this recipe again for my next apple pie.

Made this but used whipping cream instead of milk and boiled for 7 minutes because I wanted it thick.  Added toasted pecans to it as well.
Great on ice cream!

Delicious! In fact, a small amount got "lost" in the fridge and my husband thought it was some sort of gravy... I opened the jar and the scent was delightful - and so was the last of it! Made a double batch today to bring to my children/grandchildren for Christmas. It's THAT good!

I cooked it at boiling for 3 minutes instead of 2 and I am very happy with the consistency and flavour. I also used salted butter and added a little bit of pink rock salt for salted caramel.  So yummy! Thank you!

This did taste different than caramel, so this must be butterscotch. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but as other reviewers mentioned, my sauce also came out gritty. I *think* this happened after I added the imitation vanilla extract. I can’t say for sure, because I did not taste it prior to adding the vanilla, but it seems like the color and texture changed right after adding it. I stirred often too throughout the whole process, so again, I don’t know why it was gritty. It was still super yummy and I added this caramel on top of  Paula Deen’s “Caramel apple cheesecake bars with streusel topping” and everyone said they were in heaven!

I added some sliced bananas and a pinch of salt. It takes on the banana flavor and it’s nice. Add the bananas at the end, then let it come back to a boil, then turn off the heat. It probably won’t store as long with bananas.

Delicious and easy to make. A couple of tips for success. Cook over low heat to make sure the sugar dissolves so you won't end up with gritty caramel sauce. Stir constantly, although not necessarily vigorously. Just keep it moving. I used a thermometer and cooked it to about 250* which took about three minutes from when it started boiling. Also, add a couple of teaspoons of corn syrup with the other ingredients. It also helps with the grittiness. 
If you want a salted caramel sauce add 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Start with 1/8 teaspoons and add according to your taste. Enjoy!

Recipe worked great!
I used evaporated milk and cooked it for probably 10 mins.
The longer you let it cook the thicker it gets.
Definitely would recommend, tasted great too!

While this tastes fine, it is very grainy and doesnt taste like caramel. So it was the first try of the night. Heres a tip: if you are struggling with grainy caramel doing it the normal way with white sugar, add a couple tsp of corn syrup. It keeps the molecules from forming crystals like magic. Or science ;)

This recipe was very easy to make, tasty and passed the husband test. I used the recipe exactly like it is written.  It is going to a meeting tonight so my friends can drizzle (or slather) it on my freshly made, homemade apple cake.

I’ve made this sauce at work and at home and everyone loved it. I had it with just apples as a dipping sauce finished the apple and just kept eating the sauce right out of the bowl. DELICIOUS!!!

I have made this recipe several times and loved it;I just forget to review it all the time. However this time I have to share with everyone, I made this recipe today as I was craving something sweet over my ice cream, but I decided to add something to it. Ladies and gentlemen I added some Hickory Smoked Sea salt to this caramel sauce and it literally BLEW MY MIND. I just added a small amount at first but then as the sauce thickened I added more. I didn’t measure but eyeballed I would say about 1/2 teaspoon total to the sauce. The depth of Hickory smoke flavor with the buttery caramel is to die for. Y’all should give it a try!

Sooooo easy!! I made a double batch, used evaporated milk, and boiled rapidly for two minutes. I removed it from the heat and allowed it to cool a little before adding vanilla. I also added a teaspoon of coarse sea salt after it had cooled on the counter about a half an hour. Delicious on vanilla bean ice cream.

I tried to make caramel sauce before, it has never turned out right. It never really tastes like caramel sauce, usually just taste like sugar. But this one was really good. In fact, I doubt I will ever Buy store bought again. I will probably just stick with this recipe. It was so easy and it tastes so good. I accidentally added the vanilla at the beginning, and I thought for sure this was ruin it. But it came out just fine. I did add a little bit of freshly ground sea salt.

You're not kidding, oh so easy!!!  I was getting ready to make a hot fudge sundae and thought " oh, i shoulda bought caramel sauce". Buy it? NEVER AGAIN!!! It took less than 5 minutes and cost about 2 bucks and it is the most ridiculously delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth! I layered it with vanilla icecream and hot fudge. Melty, sweet and yummy! I poured the rest in a small jar and had a bit left over that I ate with a spoon! Now i just need to find an easy, yummy hot fudge recipe

This would probably be best on cake or fruit.  It tastes good but turns hard and chewy when used on ice cream.

This sauce is delicious and really very easy to make.  I added 1/4 t of sea salt which really brought out the flavor of the caramel.  This will be my new go to caramel sauce!

Used 1/4 cup half and half in replace of milk because it a about to expire. It was delicious and easy. Make sure you cook it long enough so it thickens.

I have made this twice.  The first time using brown sugar as per the recipe (which is butterscotch sauce), and it crystallized as soon as I put the vanilla in.  It had to be microwaved each time we wanted to use it to liquify it.  The second time, I tried granular sugar for true caramel sauce, and it too crystallized as soon as I added the vanilla, so much so that it would not liquify even when microwaved.  Bummer!  Won't try this recipe again : (

It wasn’t the consistency I was looking for to top my cake, so I took powdered sugar and mixed it into the caramel, right after taking it off the stove, to make an icing. I didn’t measure. I’m an amateur baker that’s made icing before so if you’re like me or more advanced I’m sure you could just eye it too. It made the most delicious caramel icing. I highly recommend this little tweak. Also, I cooked the caramel about 2 minutes longer than the recipe.

So I had a little trouble with my Caramel Sauce, maybe someone can help. The taste was superb BUT the texture is  grainy. I cooked it thoroughly and heated it to the boiling point (continued stirring). Comments on the grainy texture would be appreciated as again the taste was great!

So simple, so quick and so good. The sauce it's thick and sweet. I've added different ingredients in different batches and was surprised. First I got spicy and added cayenne pepper, then I tried a batch of black pepper (surprisingly fantastic), next I'm planning on using chai spices. This sauce is perfect plain or dressed up.

This was sooooo much better than the recipe posted by Laura on fifteenspatulas.com which crystallized and never turned amber colored.  It just evaporated the water in the pan and the sugar returned to a solid state.  It also ruined my new Calphalon sauce pan.

Super easy and delicious. I used heavy whipping cream and a touch over 1 cup of sugar. Cooking time is closer to 4-5 minutes, not 1-2. It was the perfect topping for my panna cotta.

Made as is, this recipe is very good but I had the problem with sauce crystallizing.  I know some reviewers said to just heat up and it’s  fine but mine went on top of a cheesecake so heating up was not an option. I think if I need caramel sauce again I’ll just buy it.

Can someone please  elaborate on what maybe went wrong!?... plus the recipe didn’t say what kinda butter to use. So I just used salted.

Very easy to make with ingredients that I had on hand. This made a really rich caramel sauce that we used as an ice cream topping. We will definitely be making this again!

I'm giving this recipe one star because it didn't turn out, but I must have done something wrong. Anyone, feel free to enlighten me! I was unsure how many minutes to let the mixture boil because some people said 2 minutes was not long enough. I think I boiled it about 3 minutes--I didn't start counting until the edge boiling moved to the whole surface. It came out very thick and quickly hardened on the sides of the jar I put it in. It did taste very good. I'm guessing I boiled it too hard?

I made this caramel three times now as a topping for different desserts and the flavor was great every time although the first time I didn't let it cool completely before refrigerating it and it separated slightly while in the fridge. After that I let it cool to room temp before storing it in the fridge and it kept well and was creamy and DELICIOUS for a week till it was completly gone.

This was wonderful. I made it to put on vanilla ice cream. It was a bit liquidy right away but tasted great with ice cream. The next day it had thickened up and I had the brilliant idea to dip apple slices in it. Yummmm! I am actually just going into the kitchen to make some more as I have lots of apples to eat. Lol! Make it and enjoy

My family loved it.  We used it for apple dip.  I used half the amount of milk (and used canned milk) to try to make it more
thick--not sure if it mattered.  Then I added 1/8 tsp baking soda to make it foamy.

I have never made any kind of sauce before....and this was PERFECT!  So easy and so tasty.  I made it to go on top of an apple coffee cake to make it a little more "desserty".  Hubby said we could just eat the sauce and skip the cake. haha  (I did cook it at a low boil for about 7 minutes and allowed it  to completely cool before refrigerating it.)  Thanks for  posting such a good  recipe!

Such a great recipe. I love to make caramel, but finding a recipe without heavy cream has been difficult (I never have heavy cream in the house). But this recipe is amazing and so simple. The caramel turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!

I didn't know that you shouldn't stir caramels. So my first two batches turned out "gritty" with very fine crystalized sugar. Third time's the charm. It was delicious with a very good caramel flavor n

This recipe was super easy and tasted amazing, but for me, I boiled for about 5 minutes and still it did not thicken. I’m not sure why, I followed the recipe exactly, but it did not work out for me :( that’s why 4/5 stars, because it does taste good but it’s very thin...

I've made this a few times and it's always great. Easy to make and super yummy ! Put it on Apple Crisp recently and it was wonderful. 
I think the key is to cook it long enough...if you don't it could be grainy when cooled. But when you warm it up that goes away !  Just try it...its so worth it !

I made it as was suggested. It was way too sweet for my liking. Maybe cream instead of milk would help balance out the flavor.
It was good overall.

I would definitely make it again. I have essentially made this on my own already, but I wanted to make sure that I was doing it correctly. I had also made another little thing from scratch that I just came up with. I was wanting something sweet so I got some crescent rolls and cut up apples and stewed those w/ cinnamon and nutmeg  with a little bit of lemon juice and drained that and then put them in the crescent rolls and added a little bit of the caramel sauce in the middle then kind of folded them up kind of like a little packet and then added more caramel sauce on it When I pulled them out and it was scrumptious I did add a tiny bit of milk I would’ve added a little bit of half-and-half but I didn’t have any so I just added a tiny bit of milk and it turned out really well for me

I added less brown sugar...but it was still plenty sweet! I would definitely make it again with that same variation.

I really liked this recipe.  I make a caramel sauce to put on top of bread pudding before it is cooked but I l found it separated if it wasn't used right away.  I like this one better.  It's very simple and takes minutes.  I loved it over ice cream.  Very creamy and tasty.

What a fantastic recipe. I will never ever purchase caramel sauce again. I followed this recipe exactly and the results were absolutely delicious. I used it to drizzle over apple cupcakes with a cream cheese frosting - the rest in in the fridge waiting for some vanilla ice cream! Thank you for a great recipe.

This came out smooth and creamy, and is so easy to make. I did use heavy cream instead of milk, and I boiled it for 3 minutes.  Definitely add the vanilla and use salted butter. I will be making this again.

Followed the directions exactly and although the taste was right, it was very grainy.  From reading other reviews it seems I'm not the only one with this problem. 
Update: Tried it again a second time using very low heat thinking that maybe I'd rushed it the first time but ran into the same problem. Will not try this recipe again.

Very good, thank you for sharing. It’s great with my cinnamon rolls. I place this on bottom of pan with walnuts then place my rolls on top and bake. Invert when done cooking and cooled approx 5 min. Makes for tasty rolls.

So easy and yummy.  I boiled it for two minutes but probably could go another minute to thicken a little more.  Had it on chopped apples and then tried mixing it half and half with natural peanut butter.  Thank you, was just what I was looking for.

I specially used this recipe because I ran out of heavy whipping cream. It’s a very easy and yummy recipe but as others have mentioned, it has a very grainy texture. It also was thin but I added a bit for powdered sugar and flour like someone suggested

Perfect, quick and smooth caramel sauce. I traded out the milk for International Delights Cinnabon coffee creamer. It added a really nice flavor!

Not sure where I went wrong, but mine came out like a gritty kind of hard paste when it cooled. I can heat it up and it tastes stellar, but it's not my father-in-laws super smooth (no grit) caramel syrup that never gets solid.

Goes amazingly with pumpkin cheesecake. The solidity of this depends largely on simmering time, be sure to take it off the heat just when you think it could get a "bit thicker" as it thickens up in the fridge quite drastically, ended up having to add a bit of extra milk after simmering and whisking for 5'ish mins.

I'm not sure what some of the fuss is about regarding how this turns out.  It was absolutely fabulous for us!  I stirred the brown sugar and butter constantly with a whisk as the butter was melting.  I had my flame medium low while the butter and brown sugar cooked.  I added my vanilla about 3 or 4 minutes into the brown sugar/butter cooking time.  I then s-l-o-w-l-y added 1/2 and 1/2 (1/4 cup as instructed) instead of milk.  I continued to stir it while I added it to ensure it was well incorporated.  I then let the mixture simply bubble for 2 minutes.  Stirred again and let it bubble another 2 minutes.  I then turned off the gas and didn't touch it.  WOW!!!  I used it to make a caramel topping for a flan dish I was making.  I'll definitely make this caramel topping for a host of things in the future!  It really is incredibly simple and absolutely yummy!

I followed the recipe with slight adjustments. I added 1 teaspoon of flour and left it on for 5 minutes after it came to a boil. It was very thick by the time I took it off the stove. Will make again.

Simple, rich and creamy.  Refrigerates well. Took a few minutes longer than noted.  I used evaporated milk and extra brown sugar.  Great with nuts or apples mixed in.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I've used it as an icing on spice cake.   It's very easy and a bit addictive.

I made it exactly as directed.  I'm still amazed how simple it is to make!  I used it on top of bread pudding and refrigerated the leftovers.  I plan on dipping Apple slices in it later.  I'd love to try it as an ice cream topper.  who knew it would be so easy?

Really good and simple to make. I halved it and added 2TB total almond milk. Didn’t have extract... FYI butter gets a caramely flavor when it’s cooked (browned). I didn’t do that (forgot), but in case you wondered.

This turned out great!  My goal was to make a Caramel sauce with a sugar substitute since I try not to use any real sugar. I chose Truvia brown sugar blend, and I used half-and-half since it’s way lower in carbs. This combination turned out perfectly. I let it boil for at least 5 to 6 minutes,  stirring gently but constantly. This is going to be fantastic in my keto friendly, low-carb desserts!

Ok it tastes like caramel flavored butter...  IDK WHAT I done wrong but its just liquid.. Thin as water.. I read some of the reviews saying cook longer well it just got that much more liquified! I even tried to add corn starch to thicken it (like in gravy) but NO, No, no. I still used some on some on my ice cream.. I do like the flavor. Guess, I'll add it my coffee in the morning. Buttery Caramel Coffee.. Hummm... I gave 3 stars for flavor & few ingredients. But I'd say 1 for creamy think sauce.

Love this sauce. After reading the reviews I boiled it about 4 minutes and added a scant teaspoon of cornstarch for thickening. What an easy perfect recipe and the best part... It requires  ingredients that we probably have on a daily basis.

SUPER easy and yummy! I had never made caramel and wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but it was a success! I wanted it to be a little bit thicker so I added 4 tablespoons of flour and it still tasted amazing!

Amazingly simple and easy to make. I was out of brown sugar, but substituted same amount of white sugar + 2 tablespoons of molasses. I'll be making this again and again - better than store bought at a fraction of the price!

Easy to make and very tasty.  I added Jamaican rum cream to it to make a rum cream caramel sauce.  Delicious.

Well, this is absolutely a butterscotch...but I'm not mad ;) It gets 5 stars for ease and close to that for taste. I forgot to add the vanilla ... that was fine. I toasted some walnuts and added a touch of sea salt, then coated in some of the sauce to top an apple pie...and I still have a small mason jar of the sauce left. It will be very nice on some ice cream...or maybe ill try making butterbeer :)

Good base recipe! Per the other reviewers, I used cream instead of milk, but I bet milk would be just fine (perhaps just boil a bit longer, per the other suggestions). I also added a pinch of sea salt at the end with the vanilla. Thank you!

The sauce as such tastes fine, I added a bit of salt to round it out but ultimately this is not a caramel sauce. There is no caramelization involved anywhere so what you get is a brown sugar / butter sauce. That is certainly sweet and tastes good but if it's caramel flavor you are after you will be disappointed.
If you want caramel flavor you need to caramelize white sugar to get it.

when I took it off the stove it looked good, as caramel should look. after waiting for another 20 minutes, is solidified a bit. when I ate it, the sugar crystals hadn't dissolved even though I let it boil for a while on the stove. it tastes very, very sweet and has a nasty texture.

I made it just as the recipe states, except I cooked it for a bit longer. Everything looked like it was going well but when I allowed the caramel to cool, it instantly started crystallizing. Now I have a bowl of-- what I could best describe it as-- brown sugar mush.

Just made a batch of this!  Took literally minutes!  I used heavy cream and added a dash of vanilla and salt.  Then I burnt my tongue....??   Try it!  On ice cream, on bread pudding, on waffles, on your finger...just try it!

I've never felt so compelled to write a review as I did when i tasted this. Oh good gracious at the deliciousness! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and boiled a little closer to 4 minutes stirring constantly for it to have a chance to thicken. This stuff is amazing, I'm currently eating it over apple slices but would also  just eat it with a spoon.

Just made half a batch (just wanted to drizzle on top of some apple sauce muffins) and just LOVE this sauce!  Tastes just like Werther's candies, but better.  Had to boil it for 5 minutes though, not 2, to get the thickness we wanted.

This was AWESOME! The only caveat is that you have to heat it for much longer if using white sugar (which works perfectly fine). Just watch the pot to see when the sugar browns. Also, a some more milk if the sugar clumps up after as it heats up.

I used some over cookies with sea salt - DELICIOUS! Thank you!

I mixed 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and it came out absolutely wonderful! My only problem with it is how grainy it was when it cooled, but next time I'll just try letting it boil a little longer (that might even add an extra dimension to it).

Like other reviewers, despite several minutes boiling the sauce didn't thicken. I added a slurry of a tiny bit of water with a couple teaspoons of corn starch and boiled it again. It came out nicely and held up well after baking in a pan of caramel bars.

The only "change" I made was that I doubled the recipe. It was a delicious complement on the pumpkin cheesecake with pecans scattered across the top.

JUST finished making this, to use in the Samoa Pie recipe. Holy moly, this is amazing. I DID brown the butter first, and I think it made a good difference. Also, I doubled the recipe, no problem. Thank you for such a terrific -and easy - recipe!

Wonderful caramel sauce. Used as a glaze for brownies. Added a touch of vanilla and cinnamon.

Made this exactly as written and it was so easy, quick and delicious! I thought the flavor was similar to the hardened caramel used on popcorn. For those having issues with it thickening, remember when boiling sugar the longer it boils the thicker (harder) it becomes. You may just need to let it boil a bit longer.  I also put mine in the fridge and had no issues with separation. I just warmed it back up in the microwave when I used it again. Will make it again, thanks!

Turned out great didn't change anything except using apples from my tree. Also great if you poke holes in it with a fork and pour a Carmel sauce over the top!! Will be making again.

Quick and easy to make however i found that I had to cook it longer than a minute or two before it started to thicken.  
All in all though, it tastes very nice and i will make it again! 
Thank you for sharing your recipe :)

i didnt have quite enough enough brown sugar so i used white sugar and molasses to help make up the difference.  its going our homemade coconut milk and bana ice cream we churned.   this sauce is so yummy i was burning my fingers testing lol.  will be amazing with the banana!
