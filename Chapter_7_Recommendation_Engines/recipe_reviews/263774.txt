Made a double batch of these and froze them in batches of two.  Quick and easy to prepare for breakfast. My husband and I love the flavor.

I made a few substitutions because of my husband’s dietary restrictions. I used Hillshire’s turkey sausage and low fat mozzarella cheese, everything else stayed the same. It was delicious so I can only imagine how good it would be with the regular sausage and Gouda cheese. I think this is going to be one of our Christmas brunch items this year.

Great basic recipe.  I tried frozen Potatoes O’brien which worked well.   I also used Pepper Jack cheese.  There are unlimited possibilities with different sausages and cheese combinations.  Great recipe!

I should have used a 16oz pkg of sausage.  It needed a little more.  Don't skip the oregano.  I used 1 tea of dry.  Didn't have fresh oregano.

I used skinny precooked sausage patties broken up in pieces, swiss cheese slices, diced, etc.., I used my own proportions based upon what I thought looked like the right amt.. I halved the recipe to get 6 muffins. Tasty with the addition of hash browns and sausage.  This is a 'kitchen sink' recipe if need be, clean out fridge and use up that little extra pepper, or a few cut up olives, etc.. I added some diced sundried tomatoes, the sky's the limit.  They came out of the pan beautifully, no sticking at all. I don't know if it's the recipe or my pan, but I'll be making a dozen next time.  It's good portion control for new year's dieting.  I leave a few in fridge, then in the morning, I nuke it about 20 seconds to warm it up.

I read the recipe on a post in Facebook and thought it sounded very good. I an very pleased with how it turned out. It is a keeper although next batch I will use half the sausage called for as someone else mentioned. I would like to try it with other meats and cheeses like chorizo and Pepper Jack.

Recipe has too much sausage in it.  I used only half.  Recipe made 18 muffins instead of 12.

I felt these were just fair. I upped the cheese and still didn’t notice it in them. I did like the green onion and red bell pepper in it. I decreased amount of sausage, if I’d used amount stated in recipe it would have been way too much.

I made the recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't make any adjustments.   They came out perfectly with great flavor and texture, just the way we like.  I'm going to follow the other reviewers suggestions and freeze the remainder for a quick and delicious lunch for the future.

3.3.20 The  Cook’s Note said it was OK to sub Monterey Jack for the Gouda, so that’s what I did.  I don’t buy frozen hash brown potatoes (too easy to shred your own), so I just used some freshly-shredded potatoes.   I also used Egg Beaters® to lower the cholesterol which I'm watching a little more closely these days.  I ended up baking an additional 5 minutes, but they turned out very well.  Next time think I’ll try some sharp cheddar and add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a  variation.  I love mini frittatas and quiches because you can pull one out of the freezer, and pop it in the microwave for an easy grab-and-go breakfast.  Will make these again.

The only changes I made was to substitute dried oregano for fresh, and use one additional egg. My breakfast company was wowed!

Like most people on here I used less sausage. Overall this recipe was great. I got 18 muffins as well, it didn’t bother me. Eat some now have some later

I’ll make this again! I didn’t have frozen hash browns so I used shredded red skin potatoes (used my julienne shredder) and dried spices instead of fresh (sadly) but these turned out great! Oh and goat milk and goat cheese instead since my little one is cow milk protein intolerant. The oregano really adds a unique flavor.

These are really good! We used a silicone muffin pan and it worked out great. We used a coconut oil spray just in case it tried to stick, bad idea- this particular brand made the lining of the frittatas slightly bitter. The recipe itself is great though and I highly recommend it, maybe use a little extra cheese next time.

These look yummy, can't wait to make them.
If you freeze them how long do you microwave them to heat them up? Thanks
