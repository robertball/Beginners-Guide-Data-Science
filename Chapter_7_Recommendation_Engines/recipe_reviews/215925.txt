I followed this recipe to the T and it turned out really soupy. Tried it twice and both times, same result. It almost seeems to me you should bake the polenta and then top it with sauce if it is suppose to look anything like the picture. The taste was wonderful but I thought polenta was suppose to be firm.

This is easy and yummy! I've made this at least 5 times and even messed it up once.  Not sure about why it was soupy for other reviewer but you need to cook and mix until it starts to  get really thick.  When you almost can't stir it anymore (maybe 3-5 minutes) you pour it into a dish, let it sit for about 5 minutes so it firms up more and then put the sauce on top.  I use a little less than 2 cups on mine.
