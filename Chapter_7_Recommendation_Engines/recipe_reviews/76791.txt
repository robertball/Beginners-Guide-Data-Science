(this is my own recipe, just noticed some omissions in the final published version)... You can use 1/2 lb. of soaked dried black eyed peas if you want. This is more of a main dish than a side dish, but I didn't pick the catagory it ended up being listed in. This is also good with salsa on top.

I thought this was really good.  The only  thing is that I added a lot to it.  I added to minced garlic cloves in the beginning.  I also put at least 2 TB of creole and almost 1TB of chili powder.  I would give it five stars if it weren't for the blandness I tasted before adding to it.  I also used ground turkey.

This reminded me of dirty rice, and the black-eyed peas were a great enhancement - yum.  I did make a few modifications though.  I used ground sausage instead of ground beef, and I used 1/2 c. of chopped onions and 1/2 c. of chopped green pepper.  I will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic!  I didn't have a green pepper, so I used a can of Ro*Tel tomatoes and chiles and the result was great.  I might try adding a bit more seasoning next time, but all in all, this is a keeper!  Thank you!!

Made this for new years day.  No one really cared that much for it until we took SSink's advice, and added the salsa on top...then everyone thought it was great.  Served with cornbread.

This dish is delicious!    I don't add the ground beef, kick up the cajun seasoning and serve it as a side dish.  It's a real hit in my house!

tasty, easy, healthy - this is what I love in a recipe.  I too added a bit of minced garlic to the beef, onions, and pepper during browning.  just a nice overall mix of flavors and textures.  

for one helping i squirted some lime juice over my bowl (I don't know why) and I thought that tasted pretty good too.

Very good dish. I made mine a with brown rice instead of white and frozen black-eye peas and it still came out delicious. I'm not a huge fan of creole dishes but this was one was great.

This was superb!  I used up some leftover taco meat with this recipe; I wasn't sure how the flavors would mix, but the result was delicious.  Just like my grandmother makes!

I added a can of tomatoes with green chilies and lots of cayenne pepper. I don't think it would have been as good without it.

This dish had a lot of flavor and turned out well. I used brown rice, however, and upped the cooking time. Next time, I'm going to add more water if I use brown rice, because the extra cooking time did dry it out a bit.

Wow! This is delicious (if you don't mind hot spicy food). Wouldn't change a thing but maybe cut seasoning in half.

This was easy and delicious, but the second time I made it I turned it into a casserole. I browned the ground meat with a dash of worchesteshire sauce. The hubby doesn't like the onion and pepper "bits" so I subsituted with seasonings. I took the ground beef, the two cans of peas, one can of cream of chicken soup, 3/4 cup water, the rice, and 1tbsp creole seasoning, 1 tbsp onion powder, garlic powder (we like a lot of garlic) and a dash of cayenne pepper and mixed it all up together in a bowl. Spread the mixture into a 9x13 baking dish and baked it at 350 F for about 30 minutes. Then sprinkled a bit of cheddar cheese on top and covered with foil to let the cheese melt and the casserole set up. It was yummy! Thanks for the great Recipe!

Very filling and tasty, but not a quick and easy meal.  This makes a very large dish, so be prepared for leftovers.  It took a little time for me to chop the onion and bell pepper, but I'm slow at chopping and dicing.  I only used one onion because I'm not a big onion fan.  I bought 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef, so I added a little more rice and water than what was called for.  I used minute rice and it turned out fine.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and about 1/4 cup salsa...would've added more salsa, but that was all I had.  I sauteed 2 cloves minced garlic with the onion, pepper, and meat.  I used a lot more seasoning than what was called for and it turned out delicious.  I think that ground sausage would be good to use in place of the ground beef.  I served it with cornbread.  My brother commented that it would be a great tailgate food and my mom said that she liked it better than my jambalaya.  If you use the tailgate idea, you could serve it with corn bread muffins.

I made black eyed peas last night and no one ate it.  So, tonight I had tons of leftovers and I tried using them on this recipe.  I made it without the rice and we ate it with fresh tomatoe slices on the side.  It was delicious!  These were the best black eyed peas we have ever had!

We were a major budget so we used what we had. We used deer meat mixed with sausage instead of beef and instead of Using a saucepan we cooked the meat and threw everything into the rice cooker. I used a little chili powder like a tsp and turned out amazing!! I love how flexible this recipe is.

I'm made this with 1/2 lb bacon instead of the ground meat, replaced the creole seasoning with spices from my garden - and used chicken broth I make and always have on hand.  I made cornbread as a side. This is a wonderful, easy recipe and I can see other variations, such as using leftover ham or even chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

On the evening I made this, I would have given it about 2 ¬Ω stars ... but the next day ... WOW! Very good .. it just needs time for the flavors to blend and mellow. By the way ... it was great with guacamole!

Only 3 stars because I'm from Texas and love it hot and spicy, so that said, I added not only three stalks of celery and three carrots, but "slap your mama hot" cajun spice and plain cayenne as well as chili powder (prob 3T+) and 1 large jalepeno.  I used chicken stock vs. water and did add several dashes of Louisiana hot sauce.  I added more stock and then thickened with powdered cajun roux.  Also added fresh garlic 4 cloves.  It's tasting pretty flavorful now,  but need alot for my Cajun/Mexican palette.  Mexican Cornbread in oven to accompany my New Year's Eve lucky feast.

a lot like dirty rice, and the black-eyed peas were a great addition. Did not change a thing. Will make again.

I love one dish meals but some how the great creole flavor got lost in the other flavors resulting in a pretty bland dish with less than spectacular texture.  I ended up sauteeing in 2 diced garlic cloves and 2 teaspoons diced fresh jalepeno, substituting the water with chicken broth (I used ground chicken + tbsp oil instead of beef) and adding extra paprika and 2 different chili powders before I thought it was a tasty dish.

This was yummy. Next time for personal taste I will cut back a bit on the black pepper and add a bit more creole seasoning. A keeper for sure!!

This was superb and very easy!  I didn't use any meat since I was in charge of the side dish to go with our ribs.  I also used dry beans that had been soaked and cooked already.  I didn't have Creole seasoning, per se, so I used Blackened seasoning (1 tbsp) and Jalepeno seasoning (~1/2 tbsp) instead.  It definately had some kick to it!

This was great!  We ate this dish with filet mignon, so I omitted the ground beef.  Also, because my kids were also eating this, I scaled back the Cajun seasoning to 2 teaspoons.  Thank you for sharing.

This dish was different and delicious.  I used Bush's Black-eyed Peas and instant rice to save time.  It was great.  This is a keeper.

This was pretty good.  It definitely needs more of the creole seasoning, otherwise it is a little bland.  Very onion-y and could use more meat to compensate for the amount of rice and peas.

Excellent recipe! Big hit with my family. I substituted one pound of ground turkey and added one pound of smoked turkey sausage, sliced, and substituted 2 cups chicken broth for the water. I'll definitely make this again!

Not bad, I thought it was kinda bland. I used frozen black eyed peas instead of canned. Maybe canned ones are already seasoned?

I thought this was a very good, very easy dish to whip up and not only that but everyone ate it. I did add a bit more spice on the advice of the other reviews. I also added canned diced tomato, gotta get those veggies in any way you can!

I've made this a number of times now, and am just getting around to reviewing it. It's not fantastic, but still a pretty good, hearty dish with a variety of good ingredients. I always make it exactly as written, except that a couple of times I didn't "drain the grease" since I used 96% ground beef - but I think that the draining is indeed preferable. Also, the cans of "blackeye peas" (written like that) that I used were 15 oz. not 15.5 oz., so I get a little less of them than the recipe says. Actually, this was my first time ever cooking with black-eyed peas, and I'd only ever eaten them a couple of times in my life. The spices were a little bit unusual, to my taste, so I can see why so many previous reviewers have fiddled with them. All in all, I'll give this 4 stars.

This was good, but one teaspoon of black pepper is too much. I'll try 1/2 teaspoon next time. We will probably also add a drop or two of hot sauce to our individual plates at the table.

Every year our family gets together for Thanksgiving dinner. Each family is in charge of bringing a variety of things. I usually like to think outside the box and bring something I have never cooked before or bring something we haven't eaten before. I found this recipe and decided to try it out for this special occasion. To my delight it smelled absolutely delicious and tasted better than any (dirty rice) combination I have eaten. I received lots of compliments on this dish and was asked for the recipe... I even make it for dinner sometimes with some cornbread!!! Matter of fact... I think we will have it tonight! LOL.... This is an excellent quick and simple meal!

Substituted ground turkey and added some stewed tomatoes to make up for the lost meat fat flavour and it was wonderful.  Will definitely make this one again.

I made this to up hold the New Years Black Eye Pea tradition.  What a geat dish!!  I did double the creole and added chilli pepper, I liked the kick.  I also used ground turkey instead of the beef, and chopped garlic in place of garlic powder.  It made a lot of food, and everyone was pleasantly surprised that Black Eye Peas can actually taste good!  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to have leftovers today!

Always looking for ways to get my 2 year old to eat veggies and this one was a hit! We like a lot of flavor, so I added an extra tsp of creole seasoning and doubled the garlic powder, used the canned black-eyed peas that are seasoned with bacon and added two crumbled up slices of bacon left from breakfast. My daughter declared it "DEE-lisus!" so what more could I ask for??  LOL!  Will cut the ingredients in half next time, because this made a TON of food.

Wow, so much better than I anticipated.  I thought it kind of smelled peculiar while it cooked but it tastes great.  This isn't Zataran's, but then again what is. ;P  I accually think I muffed the recipe and it still tasted good.  I was out of long grain rice so I used instant with the same amount of water and I had to use cooked dried peas because no one had peas without pork in them around here.  I overcooked the beans so I ended up with a pretty sloppy dish but I had seconds anyway.

Excellent! I love all dishes when you don't have to precook the rice or pasta. Not only easy, but yummy.

This one was easy and good. But it needed alot more spice than 1 T Creole Seasoning. I used ground turkey and about 3 Tablespoons of Creole Seasoning. Added more fresh ground pepper.

Will make great leftovers to take to work for lunch and heat up.

This is really popular with my family. I do add garlic to it at the beginning, and I do see why some might think that it's a little bland but for my kids it's perfect.  Believe me, it is a challenge to find a recipe that every person in my family likes but this one definitely fits the bill!

I made this for New Year's Day dinner.  I didn't have creole seasoning (thought I did ) so I used Cajun seasoning instead and it came out just fine.  Had it for lunch the next day and it tasted even better.

Just made this today and it was devoured by my somewhat picky husband and kids. Luckily they like spicy foods so this was perfect. The only adjustments I made were using 90/10 ground turkey and 3 cups of  low sodium chicken broth in place of the 2 cups water called for - 2 reasons for that. 1,  the people that said it was bland probably used water, and the chicken broth gives it that extra flavor you are probably missing, and 2, I used an extra cup of liquid because it helped the recipe keep from being sticky and dry - which can also detract from flavor. Used Trappey's black-eyed-peas w/ bacon flavor. Will absolutely make this part of regular rotation!

This recipe was really easy to make, it made a lot, and it was very tasty. I used Slap Yo' Mama creole seasoning, and it was spicy but really good. I also couldn't find black-eyed peas at our local grocery store, but they did have pigeon peas and it was a great substitute. We'll be making and enjoying this recipe again!

This was quite good!  I used this recipe as a guide and substituted the ingredients with what I had.  I made 2 cups of rice separately, browned 1lb ground beef and sauteed one diced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic together, added 2 cans of Rotel with juices after draining the beef as I didn't have bell peppers, combined the rice and spices with the beef mixture, added some hot sauce to taste, and added a smoked sausage at the end.  Topped with grated parmesan and served with grilled bread.  Filling and delicious.  Adding this one to my rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just tried this on New Year's Day and my whole family agrees it is a keeper.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Very tasty, satisfying, healthy and (hopefully) lucky!

I used the dried black eyed peas, and despite what the bag says about soaking them over night, they were still super firm. Other than that, this was Terrific!!

I cooked this for my fiance and he absoulutly loved it. We're from down south so we love spicy food & this was a great recipe for our pea's & rice. We added cayenne pepper & brocolli. Its a must try.

My husband thought this recipe was okay, but I didn't like it.  I used 2 T of seasoning and Bush's canned peas.  It was too salty - I would recommend using 1T of seasoning and adding cayenne pepper to increase flavor and decrease salt.
