I used the proportions of another recipe and this came out pretty good.  1/2 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup hot water.  It was not as runny and thickened up a little more as it cooled.

This has a lovely taste, but my only complaint it was extremely thin - like water. It doesn't really have the texture of a "sauce". I ended up adding 3 tablespoons of flour to thicken it up and it came out perfect. I really enjoyed it! It tasted just like toffee sauce, very smooth and delicious! and not the least bit grainy.

This is really good. I adjusted the water a little so it was a bit thicker (used maybe 1/2 cup)  and served it over strawberry shortcake in place of whipped cream. Very good!
