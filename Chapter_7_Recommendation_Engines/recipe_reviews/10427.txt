Great recipe.  My kids love this cookie.  I find that chilling the dough for an hour or two makes it easier to work with.

This is the molasses cookie recipe of my many molasses cookie dreams. High altitude: left out cold water; substituted dark brown sugar, rolling in light brown. Sub butter for shortning so left out salt. Wish I added more raisins! Yummy!! Thank you so much!

I did not care for these cookies. Followed the recipe to the letter. I have been searching for a good chewy molasses cookie, and read the reviews. Thought this looked promising. Hesitated strongly at 2 tsp of baking soda for 2 1/4 cups flour, but none of the reviews mentioned an off taste. Ours tasted STRONGLY of baking soda. If I were to make them again, I would use 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda.

I thought these turned out good. Of course I did tweek them a little. I added 1 cup brown sugar,2 teaspoons cinnamom and only 1/2 teaspoon ginger. I did roll them in sugar before baking.Next time i will use a darker molasses,then it will be more like my mom used to make.  i will be maing these again

Good, but a little strong. Probably my fault because I used dark molasses.

These are a cookie.  That is all I can say.  Not much flavor.  400 degrees!  I should have used my own head.  TOO HOT!  Even at 9 minutes they were too dark and the bottom dark dark brown if not black.
  I will not be making these again.  Sorry I wasted my time and ingredients

Not a very sweet cookie, but still a really great taste.  I love the walnut/molasses combination!

They are dry, unflavorful, and burnt, even if I only cooked them for 11 and 10 minutes for my 2 batches.

I have been searching for a cookie like my Gramm made when I was a child, these came out as light as air,,like a sponge cake.. not what I was looking for. Oh well she did not have today's ovens either,, she had a wood/coal stove. will continue  on with the search..
