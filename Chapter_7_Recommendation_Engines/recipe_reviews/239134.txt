I had never had kale braised before because I typically saute it.   I thought it was really good and had great flavor.  The onions and garlic were a nice addition and the balsamic vinegar was the perfect ending.  It does get softer, but, retains some of the crunchiness and doesn't get as soft as spinach. I do wish the recipe was more clear on the amount of kale to add.  A bunch of kale can be anywhere from a couple of cups to 5-6 cups depending on the size of the bunch.    I bought a 16 oz bag of prewashed and cut kale and ended up using about 3/4 of the bag.   I just kept adding as it wilted until I thought I had a good amount in relation to the liquid.  I also used an entire onion since mine was on the small side.  Thanks for the recipe - I will be making this again.

Delicious!!! I used chicken broth, a whole bag of kale added after the onions and garlic sauteed in butter. Added just salt and pepper and let simmer on low, for about an hour or so. Made it soupier than the picture cause I wanted more of a chicken broth with kale soup..

Delicious and easy side dish! I used a Vidalia onion to add some sweetness and half vegetable broth for liquid to add more flavor. I used 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and drained liquid before serving. Very tasty!

I used a whole onion, 1/4 cup olive oil and no balsamic vinegar or almonds. It was tasty, easy to digest and I'll make it again.
