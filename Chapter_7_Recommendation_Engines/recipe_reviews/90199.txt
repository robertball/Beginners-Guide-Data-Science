Incredibly rich.  Very easy to make.  The taste is mouth-watering and addicting.  I gave this 4-stars, however, because of the texture and consistency. Either I did not use the correct pan size or my proportions were off, because the consistency did not turn out how I expected.  It was soft and there were not enough cashews...certain portions of the pan were just sugar/butter solidified. (I, like another reviewer, expected a brittle.  Ended up taking their suggestion and refridgerated for a few minutes.)

Very Good! I used a candy thermometer and brought it up to about 305*.  It was very crunchy!  I would stir more often than suggested, though.  I had to stir almost constantly to keep the cashews from burning.

This was amazing.  My husband and son couldn't get enough of it.  We bought some cashew crunch from the local Amish store and this was exactly the same.  Thanks so much.  I will definitely be making this again.

I've been making this Cashew Crunch for several years now.  However, I only use 1 cup of sugar, and 2 cups of cashews.  I melt the butter, sugar and corn syrup and bring it to 290 degrees.  Then quickly add the cashews and spread on the baking sheet.  Use 2 forks to spread thin and you have to work quick!  Delish!

WONDERFUL!! I don't trust candy thermometers-so I use the cold water test. I also put it in the fridge while it cools (mostly to keep my children from putting their fingers in it) have never had a problem with it turning out chewy as other reveiwers have. This is a wonderful recipe and VERY ADDICTIVE!! Thanks Nat!

I used the cold water test along with the thermometer and it still came out soft.  After 10 minutes I put it in the fridge for an hour and it hardened up a bit...but, no where near the amount for it to be called a crunch.  Other than that it's absolutely delicious and everyone loved it.  I just called it a Cashew Melt-in-your-mouth instead.

Tasted great. Like others have posted though, it wasn't a crunch. It was chewy. I even put it in the fridge like another poster suggested. Maybe it needs to be heated to a higher temp? I'll try that next time.

Natalie is my daughter, and I'm not saying this stuff is out of this world for that reason. We all love when she makes this, it always goes pretty fast in the house.  Best ever cashew crunch :)

I too had an issue on the correct temp. If you do not trust your gauge, I would suggest going by the water test or better yet the color of the crunch. Mine was a bit lighter than the photo. The next time I made it, I let it go past the 290 mark and it turned out much better.

Me and my wife and are great friend Meghann had soooo much fun.  Think we will make this every year.  Meghann said she loved the smell of it.  I think we like it with mix nuts, but we will shake it up ever year and use different types.  Thanks Nat!!!

Great recipe! I am a baker and just started experimenting with candies and this is a great recipe. make sure when doing any candies like this to use a thermometer to ensure good end product. Ice water procedure is good too. When testing drops in ice water just remember that what comes out of the ice water is what your end product will be.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!! I can't stop eating it - that might be the only downside :)  I had accidentally purchased a large quantity of unsalted cashews and this turned out to be a fantastic way to use them.

This is GREAT!!! I just made it, and it came out crunchy, and perfect. If yours doesn't come out crunchy you didn't boil it long enough. When you are ready to pour it out leave in on the stove boiling for about 3 - 10 more min. Don't quit stiring it!!! Pour it out, and in a little while it breaks off, and it is YUMMY!!!

Perfect recipe.  Use the cold water method for testing.  Thermometer doesn't catch the moment before it gets too dark.

This is a GREAT recipe. The only thing I did differently was increase the amount of cashews because it seemed like there was too much liquid in relation to the amount of nuts. In any case, it turned out awesome, and everybody I've made it for has raved about it! This stuff is like something you find in a gourmet shop. It's sinfully delicious and highly addictive!

Fantastic!  Every time I make this, people just can't get enough of it.  I use whatever nuts are handy, although many times I just mixed nuts.

Recipe started out as a disaster but ended up as one of the best candies I've ever tasted. To start off, I added 2 cups of sugar by accident so I decided to add an extra 1/4 cup butter to even out the flavors. When I transferred it to a cookie sheet to set,I expected it to harden like a brittle would. It didn't so I put it in the fridge for a few hours. I ended up with a very firm but not quite a brittle-like texture but I don't care because it's so good I can't stop eating it and I don't want to share. This is one mistake I'll gladly make again and again.

Doubled the recipe, and pour into generously buttered 11x16 cookie tray.   Through multiple attempts, realized it's quite important to bring to temp, under medium heat, and to stir as often as possible, especially as it gets closer to that "hard crack" temp...

...so far, tried as my mix ins - cashews; cocktail peanuts; WM Cajun Trl Mix; macadamia nuts - all with great feedback, with many a variation on not being able to stay away from it...

...I've also modified further, with chocolate or dark chocolate drizzle, after melting, or spreading the chips over the tray before pouring, and adding a bunch after the pour...

...the Cashew Butter Crunch (aka "adult candy crack" by more than a few) has been the most popular, and of the "variations" I've tried, around the holidays, this recipe,  but using macadamia nuts, dark chocolate, and toasted coconut has been very well received.

Thx so much, Miss Natalie, for sharing! :)

Great recipe! I love that it's not as stick-to-my-teeth as a regular brittle would be. I followed the recipe except I didn't quite have 10 oz of cashews and didn't want to run to the store and it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper! 

FYI-I cooked until about 315° since I read some reviews about it being chewy.

I have a couple of people in my life who can’t eat peanuts. So I went looking for some other kind of nut brittle.  Ran across this and made it. Everybody raves is always gone in one day.

This was my first time making any kind of brittle or crunch or candy, so I made it exactly as the recipe indicated. I had trouble stirring and seeing the line on my candy thermometer and holding the pan still, so I let the nuts get too brown - totally my fault, not the recipe. It tastes a little toasty because of that, but still - the texture is great, and if not for the toastiness, I’d call it perfect. I’ll try it again and I’m sure it will be fantastic.

Made my own butter for this. Also doubled the recipe for a 3 quart pot, used salted peanuts and crushed walnuts. Add a teaspoon of baking soda before pouring out for brittle consistency. A good candy thermometer is a must!

Followed the reviewers and stirred often (first time candy maker) and went to 305ish.   I used Trader Joe's Thai Lime & Chili Cashews.

We love this and make it often. I heat it to 314' and stir in 1 tsp of baking soda just before I pour it on parchment paper to add crunchiness.

This is amazing! I made it for a church function and we kept sneaking pieces out to the point we almost didn't have any to take. I used salted butter instead and only added a pinch of salt. I substituted 10 ounces of pecans for the cashews. I did stir it almost constantly so the pecans wouldn't burn. Will be keeping this recipe close!

We LOVED this! My husband and I had a great time making this together! We let it cook to 305 like the lady above suggested. It came out nice and crunchy! We continuously stirred it. Thank you!

Iv'e made plenty of brittle in the past... I was a little reluctant with no baking soda to activate the crunch in this recipe but it turned out Fantastic. Raves from all who tried it. Perfectly crunchy and buttery delicious!! My new go to recipe.

My first batch burned. I tried a second batch (I used closer to 16 oz of cashews when I made this batch because the first batch seemed like it could have used more) and found that when the thermometer reached about 280 degrees F I had to pull it off of the heat because it was reaching the point where it would start to burn.  Glad I pulled it off then . . . .  it was FABULOUS and didn't last long at our house.  Not sure if our thermometer (which is fairly new) is that far off or what.  I made a note on my printed copy of the recipe to stop cooking it at that point.  This recipe makes a wonderful, melt in your mouth candy.  It's not as brittle as peanut brittle would be.  I will be making another batch this weekend.  Thank you for this great recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  My family will be forever grateful!

The flavor was great but it was a little thicker than I prefer. I did not have a candy thermometer so perhaps I did not cook it long enough.

Mmmmm- yes very easy and delicious. Watch it close with your candy thermometer - mine went fast at the end.  Tilt the buttered pan a little to help it spread thinner.  Ignore it while it cools and then break into pieces - even looks special!

I made this for Easter this year. We have a friend that makes really good buttery brittle but she would never give us her recipe.  I was determined to make a better brittle.  This recipe was a hit!  I don't have to worry about getting the friends recipe anymore.  Thanks for sharing Natalie!  You rock!~

Excellent!  Tastes great and everyone loves it. I used almonds the first time and am trying cashews on the next batch. Turned out great, but do keep stirring. It would be easy to burn. This is a nice simple  recipe that I will use repeatedly.

I have never made brittle before, but this turned out well for me once I figured out a couple of elements.  Notes: Use a heavy-bottomed, smaller size sauce pan.  I cooked on medium heat instead of high and heated it up more slowly to prevent scorching.  I think this also helps ensure a more "crisp" brittle.  I did not have any issues with chewiness.  I think stirring continually is also important. My cashews were the chopped up variety instead of whole pieces which made it easier to stir.

This is awesome!  It came out perfect the first time.  (I do not have a candy thermometer so when it thickened and was golden I took it off the heat and put it on buttered foil.). I did throw in extra cashews and let it cool in the freezer because we couldn't wait to try it.  Will have to hide it next time...I could not keep my family out of it!

Turned out perfect the second time around.  The only change made was to stir constantly.  After it cooled I coated the pieces in white chocalate.  A definite keeper.

I tried the recipe over the holidays and it was well received by everyone that tried it.  I will definitely be making it again!
