Made receipe as directed. Lamb was very, very flavorful (but I love lamb). My wife, who's not a lamb fan, enjoyed it but didn't think it was the best lamb she's ever had. Potatoes were very dry on top, and completely mushy under the lamb. Top cover potatoes weren't covered by the broth, and I didn't add any so they dried out. I think they were supposed to be covered. Lamb was better the next day after sitting overnight in the fridge. Recommended changes: Add a tablespoon of sage. Add some carrots. Completely drain the lamb and onions of all the oil. Add more salt on the potatoes. Maybe add mushrooms for those who like them.

Simple and delicious.  How strange that an English woman should find such a good Lancashire Hot Pot recipe on a US website.  Best Lancashire Hot Pot I've ever eaten (including my Mother-in-Law's)!  It needs lots of salt on the potatoes.

Delicious!  I had leftover lamb from Easter, already cooked, so I skipped step 1, pre-cooked the potatoes in the microwave, didn't pre-cook the chopped onions, layered the casserole as directed, used beef broth rather than chicken, added frozen peas in the layer with the meat and onions, and covered the casserole dish. Baked for just under an hour and YUM!  Hubby loved it, too!

I don't like lamb.  My wife had me make some for Christmas dinner for her mother.  I had a lot of left overs & made this recipe.  IT WAS EXCELLENT !  My 16 year old son asked for seconds!  I couldn't find lamb or chicken stock so I substituted chicken broth (1 10oz can).  Cooked in a convection oven @ 375 for 1 1/2 hourc (cuz I was in a hurry)...Worked out & tasted GR8 !

I have made this for years, you definitely need to add bay leaves to the liquid and worstersauce, a couple of tablespoons.  I also use lamb cutlets either neck, and other cuts with bone for flavour and i cover this in seasoned flour before lightly frying, this helps thicken the gravy while cooking.  I cover the dish in tinfoil until the potatoes are soft and only take off at the end to crisp them up, maybe adding a bit more butter.... very delicious!

Pretty good.  Very filling but I would have preferred a vegetable or two added to it.  I used seasoned salt throughtout.

Wow! Lots of lamb stew flavor going on without it being a stew! The meat and potato guy said, "Add this one to the recipe box!" Can see us having this many more times. I did use leftover lamb from Easter and cut the oven temp. halfway through. I also covered with foil for a time. You will like this one! Thanks for a great recipe!

3.5 stars.  I feel like it needed an additional something...maybe a bit of wine, spice, je ne se quoi? I added peas and a bit of sage which gave it a nice flavor.  I also browned ground lamb with the onions, added spices, and then layered.  It was nice. Definitely a comfort food.  I'll make again for another rainy day by the fire.  It's a nice change...just needs a bit of tweaking...

I couldn't give this a better review.  My family simply devoured it, and thought it was one of the best meals they had ever had.  I have also made it with veal and it was just as good.

I really liked this recipe.  It was simple to prepare and tasted great.  I used round steak and a little bit of smoked sausage instead of the lamb.  Delicious.

I usually add 1-2 sliced Carrots to my hot pot, and I fry the potatoes in the Lamb juice. Then I put them on top of the Lamb, carrots, onions and stock (but not in the stock) Then bake for an hour. And I also add a tablespoon of mint sauce too, tastes great!!

This was my husband's attempt at creativity. I was nervous. It was so good that we ate ourselves sick and continue to do so each time he has made it. We have made it with stock and with broth. Comes out the same to us. Otherwise he follows the recipe to a tee.

My husband and I liked this but we both felt it was lacking something. If I where to make this again I would have to add things to amp up the flavor. Also potatoes on top were hard and crispy, Maybe it needs more stock.

Overall quite good.  The only thing I wish I had done was cook it a bit longer so that the meat was more tender.  I think it would have been wonderful then.

I like the idea of it - the simplicity of it but, it's boring - definitely needs a little something more, I'll make it again using it as a base but, will play around with different additions (ie: wine, another root vegetable or two...); also, and more importantly "4-servings"  I don't think so, try 8.

This was absolutely delicious.  After reading some other reviews I made the following changes:  I did not used sliced potatoes underneath, but put chunks of raw potatoes in with the meat and added carrot pieces.  I used dried thyme and oregano, added a bay leaf and a splash of Worcestershire sauce..  I used beef broth and thickened it with flour to make the gravy thicker.  I enjoyed the crunchy potato topping.  Leftovers are amazing!

I used leftover cooked lamb so I had to modify cooking times.  I should have also reduced the amount of liquid if I wanted consistency of a stew, but the flavours were just great as a lamb soup.  I added green beans for  colour and nutrition.

this recipe was so delicious! I had lamb shanks, lamb chops (which are tiny, btw) and lamb shoulder steaks (about 2 of each), so instead of cutting the meat off the bone, I just browned these with the onion and put them into the casserole, bones and all!

I've made it twice now and really enjoyed it.  As an American, I made a slight tweak in that I substituted sweet potatoes for the white potatoes.  They cooked very nicely and kept their shape.  I added bay leaves and used beef broth rather than chicken (no lamb stock available).  I also added some dry sack and Worchestershire sauce.  Both added a real depth of flavor.

Great recipe, we nearly cleaned the pot which is amazing as my hubby is harder to please than most. I did make a few changes based on the other reviews.

,  good.  Easy, delicious, it made it's own gravy.  I added a bunch of garlic. Exquisitely captures the magic that it meat-and-potatoes.   It would be amenable to adding more, hardy veg, like Brussels sprouts, carrots, roots &, green beans.
