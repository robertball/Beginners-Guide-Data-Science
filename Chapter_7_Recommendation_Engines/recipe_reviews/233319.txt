Haighter's 19th Hole Chili Haiku: "Hubs and daughter loved. To me, it was a bit 'yawn', and needed some jazz!" Halved the recipe for 1 lb. turkey, and used a can of black beans; kept the rest the same, but found that just chili powder, sugar, garlic s&p weren't quite enough to make this chili sing to me, so I added Chipotle Tabasco to mine, along w/ cheese and Fritos and was happier. Definitely liked it enough to make again, just w/ some additions.
