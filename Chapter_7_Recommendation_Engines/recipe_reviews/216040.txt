My 13 year old son LOVES them - changed serving from 8 to 3 - used 4 oz of FRESH GREEN ROASTED CHILIES and topped with TRADER JOES SALSA VERDE.  Tortillas were fresh white corn from FOOD CITY... YUMMMMMM

Tasty and easy to make.  Will be making again soon.
Family loves it and I will definitely put this recipe into the rotation of meals. I made 4 trays of 4 and freeze for busy days.

these were great! wouldn't change a thing about them. just remember how hot they are depends of the sauce you buy. Cuz of my little babies i buy the mild red sauce. but keep everything else the same. Also if using flour tortillas don't sauce them right away. let them cook for about 15 minutes then add the sauce and top with cheese and olives if you like them, put back in the oven till cheese is melted on top. mm mmm good ! thanks for the recipe!
