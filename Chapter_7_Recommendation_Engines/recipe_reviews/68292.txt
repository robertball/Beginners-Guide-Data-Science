I've made this recipe several times and it's always a hit.  The mix of all the different flavors is a tasty combo.  To keep the top from drying out and the bottom from being too soupy, take out and stir 2-3 times during baking.  Also, I leave out the bacon since the instructions do not say what to do with it.

It looks good, and it sounded good, but was really nothing special. Since I dislike chopping up chicken, I'd have to say not really worth it for me.  But it was OK.  I left out the olives since I don't care for them, and also the raisins.  I put the bacon on top just before adding the chicken broth.  It does need to be cooked until the liquid is almost gone, but the cheese doesn't need anything like 15 extra minutes.

Deeeelish! If you're a tamale lover that is ;) Pretty much like the enchilada pie to enchiladas. Me and the hubby added some jalapenos to the mix (because we love jalapenos) and it turned out fantastic! A simple recipe with a great taste :) Thanks!

My kids really love this.  To please them, I replace the green olives with black olives and omit the raisins, we are not big on raisins, turns out great!!! I have also added a little onion powder too.
