We didnâ€™t love this recipe. It really needed something. Made it exactly and was lacking flavor. We all agreed.

The beauty of this dish is that not only is it tasty, but it's very versatile and could be used at any meal. I cut the recipe way back because  a  9x13 pan is just too much for us, but it was easy to do and we had excellent results.  I don't really care for mustard and I wish I hadn't added it, but it was still very good.
