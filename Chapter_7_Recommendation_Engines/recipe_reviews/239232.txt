If you are looking for a baseline recipe for any veg soup, this is IT. Chef John's recipes are always easy to follow, and this one is perfect as is. I like to modify recipes, but always after I've explicitly followed the directions thru once. 
The second time I doubled the recipe, and doubled the cayenne (just 'cause) and it was just fantastic.

Excellent!  Quick and simple.  I did add one finely diced shallot with the garlic & butter.   I used both the cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp white pepper.  Pure comfort food & pretty healthy too.

UPDATE:  Now when I make this soup I don't use heavy cream, just a bit of 2% milk does the trick, with less fat.  I use Vegetable Broth too.  It is such a healthy soup, and SO GOOD!

I made this exactly as written and it was great.  Well wait... I used Swiss Cheese on my toasted Sourdough bread and let it melt under the broiler in my Toaster Oven, and chopped it up into little crouton-like squares before I added it to my soup to fit on the spoon easier.  This is pretty guilt-free goodness, Thank you Chef John!!

Great recipe. Quick and simple! Instead of the cheesy bread I added about 1 1\2 cups of shredded cheddar to the soup and a squeeze of lemon. Delish.

This was a good recipe that we enjoyed. Pureeing it elevates it to a more elegant level. I made it as directed. The only deviation was to use low sodium chicken stock. That being said, at first taste, it was quite bland. Adding  the salt helped bring out the flavors. My broccoli took double the time to be soft enough for the immersion blender.....I guess they were mighty fresh. The finished product was very good and seemed to taste woodsy. I used the Chef John no knead ciabatta as the toasted bread for this recipe and it was perfect.

Fantastic! I might have added too much broccoli as it was very thick. Almost like spit pea soup thick. For extra flavor I fried up 1/2 an onion along with 2 cloves of garlic. It was not over flavorful. The salt, cayenne, cream, and broccoli are the star flavors in this soup. I sprinkled extra cayenne over the top when serving. Loved the cheese crouton touch! Delicious.

I totally agree with Chef John's philosophy - thicken the vegetable soup with more of the vegetable, NOT flour! The only thing I change basically is that instead of cheddar, which is fine, of course, I use Stilton cheese, and I stir it into the soup a few minutes before serving up. With the cheese in the soup, it's totally unnecessary to add salt. Stilton and broccoli go together in a totally magical way!

I usually make this soup in early autumn when my broccoli patch has nothing left but a lot of small sprouts. In a soup, they're equally as good as a couple of large heads. I use the stalk as far down as it is still un-woody, as well as all the leaves attached - gives it a deeper flavour. Make sure to add plenty of freshly ground black pepper!

Loved this Soup as it is. I also make a low cal version omitting the butter(use EVOO) and the cream as well as the cheese. Reduce the broth to 1/2 Qt. This makes a thick delicious soup with minimal fat and great taste and texture. It is the consistency of pea soup, ie less creamy but very hearty and flavorful. Who needs the fat and calories. It is still fashioned after the original Recipe which is simply devine!  Enjoy! Either way!

I made this twice in the past month, yummy!  I sauteed a chopped onion first then cooked that on medium heat.  Then I added in the garlic and followed the directions as written.  The only other things I did differently were to put the cheese directly into the soup at the end of cooking and skip the bread entirely.

I just made this soup as I had one large head of broccoli in the fridge that I bought at the market. The head had all the leaves and a very healthy looking stock on it so I chopped up everything and put the heavier stock and leaves into the broth before I put in the florets. Other than that all ingredients exactly as Chef John wrote........excellent soup!! Thank you and I will use this recipe for other vegetable soups in the future.I'd like to add a note re the garlic....be sure you are using fresh local garlic.....not that China stuff which has no flavour whatsoever. I love quick, uncomplicated recipes that taste wonderful!!

I made this soup in less than an hour. It was delish, although I need a bit more depth. I added broccoli trunks and asparagus stems. Next time I will add kale or spinach for depth and maybe a few mushrooms. I also used almond milk instead of cream and it was great. I love to use Chef John's recipes as they're easy to follow, explicit and taste great!

Easy to make, quick, and delicious.  I didn't have whipping cream, so I substituted a 1/3 cup of half n half mixed with a half tablespoon of melted butter.  I also added some chopped Canadian bacon for texture, but it probably wasn't needed.  Chef John's recipes are the best.

Delicious just as is. A perfect simple broccoli soup. A great way to add cheese without putting it in the soup. The toasted cheese breads really make this even better.
