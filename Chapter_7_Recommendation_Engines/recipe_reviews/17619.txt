Having grown up in Springfield, the home of every type of chinese cuisine,(every business that goes under a new chinese place is born) THIS IS EXCELLENT!!! I have used a recipe for years but the sauce was not the right stuff! This one is!!!
The recipe does not specify but you should fry the chicken pieces in peanut oil. Thanks Brad, this one is a keeper!!!!!

Brad, thanks so much for this recipe.  My 3 sisters and I have been working on a good recipe for cashew chicken after eating it weekly for 15 years or so I miss it and have to travel home to get it at least once a year.  And Mexican Villa too.  haha We were using way too much oyster sauce yours is right on.  You would think people would realize it is supposed to be salty hence the 8 b. cubes, soy sauce and oyster sauce.  Thanks again.

Thank you Brad!!!  I initially thought it was a bit too salty, so I have left all of the actual salt out of the recipt ... there is enough Soy & Oyster sauce sodium for me.

I've made this so many times and my hubby will eat it for days on end.  Perfect for those who don't like all the veggies that come in Chinese food.  Since the sauce is seperate you can add as much or little as you like.

THE ONLY GOOD EXPERIENCE I HAD IN SPRINGFIELD WAS EATING THE CASHEW CHICKEN! THIS RECIPE WAS REALLY CLOSE, BUT A LITTLE TOO SALTY.

The sauce has a Super taste! Not too bitter or too sweet.     When I double breaded in the past, I never waited ~ This time I did like the recipe said to do and WOW  the nuggets turned out wonderful. ~GREAT TIP!!!   The breading stayed on and only a little bit remained in the fryer (The only changes I made to this recipe were:I added corn starch to the flour and I used peanut oil to fry in a deep fryer)

will do again next time i will cook chicken and make the sauce as the recipe calls for but i will put the chicken directly in the sauce and let the chicken soak up more of the sauce that way the chicken needed more of the sauce taste to it then i will pour this over some white rice i added the rice we think it was a good add to this recipe thanks

I have lived in Springfield pretty much all of my life, and this recipe is GREAT!!! I did make a few changes though, after seeing people thought it was too salty (I can't stand salty stuff!!). I used low sodium chicken bouillon cubes, I omitted the salt the recipe called for, and used 1 Lb. of chicken... and it turned out wonderful!!! My husband and I thought it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make this again!!!

My family seems to like this recipe, even though I am the only Cashew lover in the house.  I reduced the amount of sauce and cut down on the green onions the second time I made it and the kids seemed to like it better.  Overall a decent meal when served with stir fried noodles.

I made this last night. I used 2 tblsp oyster sauce (because who wants to measure 1/3 tblsp?) Also I used 1 box of chicken broth and added 2 cubes of chicken bullion to it. With the changes I made it tasted exactly like I remembered it. Now I can ease the cravings of things from my home in Springfield MO, except Schlotzky's. Man I miss that place!

I grew up in Springfield and worked at a chinese food restaurant for 4 years during high school. I must say this is a pretty great recipe and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I now live in MI and cannot get good chinese very often! I only made a couple modifications: I added a spoonful of chopped garlic to the sauce. And for those of you who like it hot I added some chili paste to make it a spicy cashew chicken!

This recipe is amazing! I move to MI from MO about  a year ago & have been so frustrated anytime I go to a Chinese restaurant and order Cashew Chicken - it is never what I had growing up. This is exactly what I've been looking for. We've made it twice already & will never try to order Chinese out (at least up here) again. THANK YOU SO MUCH! note: I was told to add the cornstarch to the water while it's cold and stir it in really good, then boil to prevent clumping, works great! A+++++++++++++ recipe!

I love going to Springfield for cashew chicken because it is the only place I know of that you can get it like this.  This was a very good version.  A bit labor intensive but totally worth it.

The chicken nuggets were good, but I found that the sauce was not to my liking, although my Mother liked it.

Having recently moved from Springfield, Missouri to Michigan I have been sorely disappointed by any order of 'cashew chicken' in any restaurant around here.  This recipe is very, very close to what I grew up with.  Quite good!

I made this according to the instructions.  I live in Springfield and this is not how it is in Springfield at all.  The sauce was nothing more than flavored brown water and had very little flavor.

We moved from MO (lebanon about 45 miles from sprfld)to North Carolina where to my dissappointment they don't even have cashew chicken here. But I have a recipe just like this but instead we omit the pepper in the sauce and put it in the batter and only use 3tsp. of soy sauce. and intead of white sugar use brown but other than that its pretty much what we have been using for years. oh yeah and peanut oil is the key for the chicken.but its a wonderful recipe everyone always comes over to eat on cashew chicken night!

Great recipe! I do have to make one very important suggestion. The sauce seemed to be lacking an important flavor...SESAME OIL! A little drizzle stirred in at the end really made it authentic "Springfield Style". Honestly, it wouldn't have been the same without it. Oh, and I garnished w/ green onion. I'll definitely be making this again...the whole family loved it!

I am so very excited to have come accross this!!! I have only been out of the Springfield area for about 9 months and am going into withdrawl! I stupidly ordered cashew chicken from our local chinese place and was so sad to see what I got. Now all we need is a Mexican Villa burrito enchilada style and our home will be set. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I love this cashew chicken recipe and was so happy to find it on here. It is true you can't find it made the same anywhere else. Ive spent many summers there.  And it is one my all time favorites and now my families.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I grew up in the springfield area and really miss cashew chicken. Loved how easy this recipe is. However, next time I'll probably use a little less suger and 1 less bouillon. It was a little to sweet and the chicken taste is a little stronger than I remember. Other than that great recipe!

It's next to impossible to find a restaraunt worthy cashew chicken. I couldn't tell you how many recipes we've went through to finally find this one.  Omitting the salt I do have to agree with, the soy sauce has more than enough.  And we like our sauce a little bit thicker so we used more cornstarch (always mix your cornstarch in cold water first it will be lumpy if you add it straight to the hot sauce).  Making the chicken is more that half the battle so when i'm craving it on a work night I pull out the precooked, unbreaded diced chicken meat from the freezer, fry it in some soy sauce and whalla :)  15 minute meal for our busy busy weeks.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Good Recipe, Ive lived in springfield all my life and find that the best you simply can't make at home. However, This runs a close second in my book. I think that Small Medalions of green onions are way better than roughyly chopped.

This recipes is great! My husband and I went to college in Springfield, so this tastes like home. I just use the sauce, as we like our chicken nuggets flurrier. I use the breading from Mr. Food's Honey Chicken. You can google that to find it. Very simple. 
For this sauce, we use chicken stock instead of chicken bouillons, but everything else the same. Don't forget the green onions, as it really makes the meal. Thanks for the great recipe!

The sauce was not liked in our house but the chcken was devoured!! I think that I will try another type of sauce but everyone agrees that the chicken was the best; I think that the secret is leaving the chicken in the flour for 15 minutes it does make a difference

This is delicious. It makes A LOT of sauce, so definitely make sure you cook up some rice with it.

I went to college near a Springfield and Master Wong’s was a regular stop for us. This recipe is dead-on. I added some cornstarch to the flour dredge and some garlic powder to the sauce.

This was very good. More work than I want to go to on a week night, but good for a special weekend meal. My sauce could have been a little thicker. My cornstarch seemed to clump no matter how long I mixed it. But that is no fault of the recipe! I served it over rice and enjoyed the meal.

Having grown up near Springfield, Mo. This was the cashew chicken I grew up eating.  I was thrilled to get this recipe, and it does taste very, very close to the restaurant Cashew Chicken.

We tried this recipe, pretty much as is, today, and my boyfriend, a born and bred Springfield native, gave it two thumbs up lifted high.  In fact, we both enjoyed it so much that we overindulged resulting in a food coma nap-a-thon, but there are worse problems to have!   In short, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I made this last night and it was fabulous!!! I read previous reviewers' comments and omitted the salt altogether, and I honestly didn't miss it! I also steamed broccoli on the side and put some of the sauce on it...so YUMMY!!! Definitely making this the next time I'm craving cashew chicken!

This is a very good start, however I found it way too salty so next time I am going to back off on the bouillon.  This was liked by everybody in my family & that is a tall order.  I will definitely make it again!

"A bit labor intensive but totally worth it."  - My sentiments exactly, but SO totally worth it!! I've been jonesing for a Springfield cashew chicken fix for over a year now and last night I just got down and dirty and made this recipe. I used 2 Knorr chicken bouillon cubes (they're larger than other kinds) to the 4 cups of water. It turned out *so* good...I'll probably eat some for breakfast this morning! LOL  Seriously, you have to try this recipe - especially if you've never had Springfield-style cashew chicken.
