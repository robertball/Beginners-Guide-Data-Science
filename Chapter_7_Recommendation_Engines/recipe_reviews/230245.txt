I’ve made cream cheese frosting countless times and have never had any issues doing so – until the last time I made cream cheese frosting.  It was considerably gloppier than I wanted it, and this was a big concern because rather than spreading it onto a sheet cake I wanted to pipe it onto cupcakes.  I had to do a LOT of doctoring to get it to an acceptable thickness and it wasn’t “a piece of cake” (ha!)  to get it there.  I’ve been spooked ever since.  Today was the day to give it another shot and I was determined not to have a repeat of this.  I did some snooping around online and came up with a couple of tricks I was eager to try.  I chose to use them on this recipe for its lesser amount of powdered sugar than most.  So…tips I tried were to mix the butter and powdered sugar together first, just till the mixture is smooth. Then add the COLD cream cheese, which of course is still malleable, piece by piece, being careful only to mix just till smooth and not overbeating.  One last thing I did, just for good measure, was to limit the vanilla to just one teaspoon, as I didn’t want to add any more liquid than necessary.  It all worked!  The frosting was thick, luscious and perfect for piping – it really held its shape.  I love this frosting flavor-wise too - not too sweet, yet not too tangy, but still a good, pleasantly sweet cream cheese flavor.  Since I used this to frost lime cupcakes, I infused it with a tablespoon of grated lime zest.  This stuff is goooood.

One of my favorite frostings EVER. I like to use pure vanilla extract in this recipe and add a pinch of salt only because Grandma always taught me to add a little salt when making frosting. It's so good you want to eat it out of the mixer bowl.

My official taste-tester gives his seal of approval on this recipe! After years of making cream cheese frosting, I've ALWAYS been annoyed by the hassle of bringing the cream cheese to room temp before being able to make the frosting. Well, I decided to follow Naples suggestion of mixing the butter and sugar FIRST, then add COLD cream cheese...what an awesome idea! And it WORKS!! This recipe (and Naples method) is a keeper!

A good and straight forward start, but you really are going to need more powdered sugar anyway, to get the texture right, unless you just want a sort of glaze.

Never made cream cheese frosting myself though my mama did when I was a child. This was a very easy recipe to do.  I did follow the suggestions made by naples34102, and doubled the recipe to ensure a good amount for my two layer, red and green velvet cake.  The frosting came out really good.  My husband approved and he is not a frosting kind of guy.  It was a thick creamy result.  I also added the pinch of salt to the mixture while the butter and sugar were creaming.  Excellent recipe, I will make this again when I make my black magic cake.

I really liked this recipe. I only added half of the sugar because I prefer mine less sweet. Delicious on the Applesauce Cake VI!

It was just okay. It had a hint of sweetness that just wasn't robust enough for us. I didn't add the salt like recommended by others and perhaps I should have. I may try this again, but do plan to enhance it maybe with more sugar and some salt.

Easy and delicious! I let the butter and cream cheese warm up on my counter instead of the microwave (I always tend to overdue it in the microwave and then regret it).

Super simple, tasty and if you add a pinch of salt (1/4 tsp) it balances the sweetness perfectly.  I added cinnamon extract and you can easily take this recipe and add almond, lemon, peppermint - whatever compliments what you are baking.

I whipped it too much in my KitchenAid mixer, and it STILL turned out great!!  I followed the recipe except I used an 8 oz block of cream cheese instead of the 6 oz it called for.  It was very yummy and light (because it was whipped). I used it as the frosting on a spice cake I made and shared it with a friend  -- we ended up eating 1/4 of the bundt cake between us. I think the frosting is perfect for spice cakes.

I loved how easy it was. I made an Apple cake today and frosted it with this. I only used 1 cup of sugar because we don't like things to sweet. Love how easy and perfect this recipe turned out.. room temperature butter and cold cream cheese. Did as directions said and mixed those until creamy then added 1 cup of shifted powdered sugar and a Teaspoon almond and vanilla flavor. Perfect consistency..and delicious as written. Thank yu

We loved this frosting, we used it on a banana snake cake and decorated with toasted chopped walnuts.  This recipe is perfect because it is not too sweet!

I think cream cheese frostings need to be tailored to the cake or quick bread they're meant for. I used this on the banana banana bread recipe in this site and added more confectioners sugar till it perfectly complemented the strong  banana taste. 

With a sweeter  cake I'd have left the frosting recipe alone. This is an excellent base, easy to tweak as needed or just fine ( (depending on what you'll use it on ) )  as it is. 

Make this your own.. Cooking is a matter of personal taste  and a great frosting base is adaptable---as it should be.

I really like it and used it to make the rainbow cake on the pictures. The only thing I change is the sugar. Two cups of sugar is too sweet for most people. I make it with only one cup of sugar and I thinks it's perfect. The consistency is great!! I will use it from now on.

This recipe was easy to make and I enjoyed the outcome. To make it easier to spread however I added about 1- 2 and 1/2 tablespoons of sour cream. I would add these in one at a time  to watch out for consistency. You can always add more later if needed . I also found that if you use a non fat sour cream for me anyways it is a bit chunkier which makes it harder to decorate with however if you are just throwing it on top of a muffin to spice things up and don't care much for consistency then I wouldn't worry about it. I also found that it was best to beat the cream cheese and butter together first and then add the sugar slowly. Shifting out the sugar first also helps prevent chunks. If you do add the 3 tablespoons of sour cream I would add them in before the powdered sugar but be careful to watch for that consistency so you may want to start out with two and then add more later as I said above . This made a huge difference and helped in giving a much more malleable and creamier texture without  messing up the taste.  To me it only tasted a bit creamier  and gave the sugar a little bit less of a sweet kick which was actually preferable since sometimes with cakes you get a sugar shock from all that icing and sweet stuff. The sour cream helps balance out the sweet taste to bring just the right amount of sweetness without messing up the hint of cream cheese. All in all great recipe and was a huge hit at our birthday party. Also is great on top of blueberry muffins

Thanks go to naples34102. It was this review that gave me the confidence to try this recipe. Not really sure how much icing this would make and knowing I only needed to pipe 12 cupcakes I made just a half recipe. It was awesome. Sweet enough yet the dream cheese taste was still there. Will definitely use this frosting again.

Delicious!! I have made this 3 times. I use a little more brown sugar and cinnamon mixture, about 1/2 cup. I use some of this and coat my chopped apples in it. I also make the easy cream cheese frosting recipe (with 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 cups that the recipe calls for), and put it on top of the Apple Loaf. Yummy!!!

Was perfect for some cookies I was making! I halved it and it still turned out great. I loved that it didn't have too much powdered sugar because I love the cream cheese taste and this was so simple and easy. I had it made in less than five minutes!

I doubled the recipe and added 4 oz extra cream cheese (I used the whole packages, instead of cutting 2oz off each). I ended up added an extra cup of confectioner's sugar as well. This turned out so well! I am so pleased, and so are all of my guests!! Thank you for a great recipe, and thanks to the reviewers for the advice! This is a keeper!

Delicious and creamy. Make sure not to melt the butter; better to just let it sit out to room temp rather than microwave it. Otherwise, frosting will be greasy.

absolutely delicious!! I used the advice of another reviewer and beat the cream cheese in one cube at a time. the texture was divine... smooth and creamy, and it has a great cream cheese flavor, not too sweet. It wasn't super stiff, but my kids were able to pipe this onto cupcakes without a problem. This will be my go-to frosting from now on.

Super yummy, and so easy. My daughter says it tastes just like strawberry space ice cream. I added 2 drops of strawberry essence.

I will Definitely be making this recipe again. It's light, fluffy, and delicious. Not to mention super easy. I wasn't careful with the sugar. I just let the cheese and butter soften and dumped everything in the bowl and mixed. Great recipe.

I liked the recipe and went with the adjustments that Naples suggested, Thank you for that.  I will make it again but will add a little cool whip to the recipe to see how that turns out.

Really tasty.  I used salted butter and followed the directions as written.  I eyeballed the vanilla so possibly I added a bit less, but otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Creamed the butter and vanilla together and then cream cheese, slowly added the sugar. Delicious and rich without being super sweet.   It came out just like a normal cream cheese frosting in consistency as well.  No added sugar needed.

WAY.
TOO.
SWEET.

Consistency was good, though.

Would suggest reducing sugar by half to 3/4 cup. Seriously, it was that bad.

This turned out pretty good. The consistency was good, but was very sweet. Next time I will taste it before adding all the sugar and use less. It piped well though.

Quick,  easy and delicious.  Added the pinch of salt as recommended though I don't know why because I'm not an experienced home baker.  Thank you so much to the poster of this recipe!

Not my favorite.  It tasted too sweet and too vanilla-y without enough tang from the cream cheese.  I also ended up with tiny lumps of cream cheese embedded in frosting despite following the directions given.  It was edible, but not something I will make again.

Made according to directions and was nice to frost with.  Found it a bit to sweet and didn't have the cream cheese flavor I was hoping for.

I made a butter pecan cake this evening and was looking for an easy cream cheese frosting recipe to use. I made this with the substitution of 2 tsp. of butter pecan flavoring for the vanilla. I'll definitely be using this recipe again. Delicious!

I have not tried the recipe, but after looking at several different ones, I decided this looks like the best one for increased cream cheese taste. I have a question related to some of the posts. One of the recipes I saw indicated specifically unsalted butter. Is that why people are talking about adding salt to the recipe? If so, why couldn't one just use salted butter? Gave it only a 4 star rating since I haven't tried it yet. I also like the suggestion to mix butter and sugar first, but will see if it is "lumpy".
