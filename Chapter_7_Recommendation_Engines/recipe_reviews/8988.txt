I love this recipe. However I have made some changes to simplifiy it. For example I place the chicken and sauce mixure on the bottom. I omitted the alomond and mixed the stuffing and broth in a bowl ahead of time and then placed it over the chicken mixture. I is absolutely Delicious!

What is not to like about this recipe it is like a leftover Thanksgiving casserole!  I scaled this by 1/2 because I didn't want alot of leftovers. I used leftover roasted turkey in place of chicken, in lieu of seperate cans of veggies I used veg-all also I didn't have plain stuffing crumbs so I used a box of stove-top if you were making the whole recipe you would need 2 boxes. I wonder if you would really need to cook the chicken first since you bake it for over an hour? I served it with green beans and cranberry sauce, my family enjoyed this recipe thanks for submitting it.

i made this tonight. my family said it was best thing i have ever made. i did  not use all of my soup mixture and i used alot more stuffing than the recipe called for. i made the chicken breasts very thin and sauteed them with garlic and olive oil to cook them. this recipe had alot of flavor. next time i make this i might substitute the mayo for some ranch dressing for a little more kick. very goood overall!

MY FIRST CHICKEN CASSEROLE THAT I HAVE EVER MADE ... and it was a success thanks to this recipe.     Very easy to make.    I boiled the chicken and then pulled it apart using a big fork.     Please continue to post easy, family recipes for us that do not have a lot of time to cook.   God Bless.

The stuffing was nothing like stuffing, it in no way fit in the 9X13 it calls for. We did not like this dish.

My kids do not like peas and carrots but I liked the idea of a vegetable in the dish.  I substuted chopped brocolli and shredded a couple of carrots instead of the peas and carrots.  They loved it.  I will use this again for potlucks and gathering.

This is a great recipe. I did change it a bit though. I did not use the almonds and subtituted broccoli for the peas and layered potato and onion perogies above the first layer of stuffing. It was awesome.

I found this recipe a little too bland even after I followed other reviewers tips and added seasoning.  Maybe the 2 cans of soup are just a little too much.  My husband said it was okay.  I loved the concept and may make a few changes and see if it can be improved.

This is an excellent dish and served beautifully to my in-laws.  My father in-law is not a mushroom fan, so I did the following substitutions:  Cream of Celery soup instead of Cream of Mushroom soup, and used a can of cut asparagus tips drained instead of the fresh mushrooms.  Next time I will use 2 cans of the asparagus (one for the bottom layer and the other for the top).  I also used a can of roasted garlic chicken broth in lieu of the regular can.  I used light sour cream and will try light mayo next time.  Overall this was a clear winner at my dinner table. Left-overs taste just as good if not better than the first go around.  Thanks for this great recipe Janet!

My sister served this recipe at a family gathering and it got rave reviews from all.She says she used canned mushrooms, and added diced celery and onion microwaved in butter. My family has requested this for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was delicious. I cut the recipie in half and didn't find it too soupy or goopy. I used up some homemade bread that was starting to go stale in place of the stuffing and just added my own spices. That worked very well and kept the bread from going to waste. I really liked the flavor and texture of the toasted bread cubes on top of the casserole. My husband enjoyed it so much he had three servings.

This is the best chicken casserole I've ever tasted.  Definitely will do again.  The only change I made was using 2 small cans of mushrooms instead of fresh ones and frozen peas and carrots rather than canned.  Delicious!

For taking as long to make and bake as it does, I expected it to be a lot better.  The soup mixture is very over-powering.

This is sooooo yummy. THe only thing I do different is leave out the carrots (personal preference). It makes a LOT. You might make it in the next bigger sized pan because 9x13 is usually overflowing. GREAT recipe.

This casserole was just what I was looking for! It has Thanksgiving dinner all over it. Didn't change a thing and it came out perfect! Everyone loved it and had it the next night as well. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Excellent!  My family loved this and it was a great way to get them to eat veggies!  I decided to use the chicken tender strips.  I cooked them in a little butter on the stove.  This makes plenty for left-overs.  This remindes me of Chicken Divan.  I will make this again!

A very good casserole. I also used frozen peas and carrots, low sodium broth and 98% Fat Free Cream of Mushroom. Still very tasty. I served it with mashed potatoes and salad. A great Comfort Dinner. It tasted very "Thanksgiving"-ish. Next time I'm going to put alittle Cranberry Jelly on the side.

This recipe tasted okay. I think that there is too much condensed soup mixture, so it's sort of goopy with a wierd aftertaste (condensed soup straight from the can is not too tasty--this is almost the same!). I think I would use more "starch" to balance out the sauce, like extra stuffing, mashed potatoes or maybe rice. More veggies would have been good, too.

Ohhhh Yumm!  A few notes though.  The almonds aren't really necessary.  If you're serving this at a party, it makes it look a little prettier.  However, they don't add much to the dish otherwise, except the $2 the bag will cost you.  Next, you need a big bowl - medium's not big enough - to mix the whole 16 oz stuffing.  Finally, a 9 X 13 pan for this isn't quite big enough.  It's pretty much overflowing.  Otherwise, OMG the flavor is perfect!  This is serious, filling, comfort food, and it makes a ton!

I tried this recipe and I put it together like Zuleika75, I used less, as I was making it for 2.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup,and I also put in 2/3 cup of the sour cream and 1/4 c of ranch dressing, as someone else suggested, rather than the mayo.  I didn't think I needed the extra butter with the stuffing. I put the broth (about 2/3 c)in the stuffing mix before I added it like Zuleika75 did to the chicken, soup mixture, peas, carrots and mushrooms (canned) on the bottom. I had the broth from cooking the 1 lb.of breasts in water for about 45 or so minutes. We liked it.

Good recipe.  What I do is save my ends of bread in the freezer. I break them up and add them to the bread wrapper.  It is amazing how many ends/bread chunks you get ina short time. I make my own Cream of Whatever Soup.....Cut the recipe in half.  I bet it would be good with stale 
corn bread.  Also I toast the bread chunks in the oven...........

Yuck!  I followed the recipe to the letter, boiled the chicken first then used a fork to take the meat off the bone.  Did not substitute any ingredients.  It was so creamy and mayonaisey and rich.  It really grossed me out.  Not AT ALL what I expected and I wasted 2 whole chickens in this recipe.  I am out $15 in all for all the recipe ingredients including the chicken.  I will never try to make a casserole again........
