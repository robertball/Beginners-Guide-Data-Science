Tried this last night...what a great recipe to be so easy to make! I used frozen blackberries but was careful to drain very well.

This is scrumptious! The sweet tangy berries and wonderful crumble is the perfect mixture! I have to leave out the cinnamon though - I'm allergic. I don't miss it. ;-)

This was good but definitely not 5 star worthy.  However, I could not find fresh blackberries so maybee that is why.  Not sure.  I will make it again as it was good.

Had to use 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk with the poppy seed muffin mix to be able to spread it on the blackberries. This turned out perfect!
