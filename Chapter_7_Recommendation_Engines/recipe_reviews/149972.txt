Absolutely fabulous! Who would have thought a steak sandwich could taste so good?  I cut the recipe down to 2 servings for about 1 & 1/4 lb. steak. For the marinade I basically cut all the seasonings down to 1 tsp. each and used smoked paprika vs. regular paprika and used minced garlic vs. garlic powder and added a little more olive oil.  For the avocado salad I grilled some thick red onion slices along with a red pepper before combining it with the other ingredients to give it a smoky flavor. Definitely toast your roll first before piling everything on and dig in because you're in for a real treat!

Wow!  That is some spicy stuff!  First time I've ever made something with too much spice for my husband!  If I do this again, I'm going to rinse some of the excess spice/paste off the meat before cooking it. I think the flavor will still be there.  We ate this wrapped in tortillas.

This was so good, the avocado salad cools down the spicy meat.  I marinated the meat overnight.  We sliced thinly after grilling and used for fajitas.  Will definitely make this again!

Amazing!!! things I did differently, I didnt marinate the meat so I put oil on the steak then drenched it in seasoning and cooked it on my grill pan on the stove. Toasted the bread in the toaster. came out fantastic!!! My only complaint is the avacado salad kept falling out so I had to keep putting it back on! Next time I'll cut the bread differently so it stays on! :)

Amazing. However, I feel that you definitly need to scrape some of the rub off before you grill. It was super spicy. A new week nite dinner for the fam.

I give this recipe a 5.  It was absolutely delicious!  The flavors of the meat, and the outrageous salsa was to die for.  It wasn't spicy to me at all, I love spicy food.  I did follow the recipe to the tee.  I think next time I wouldn't add as much paprika, but what I cooked and what I ate was great.  I substituted pepper jack cheese in place of the cheddar cheese.
