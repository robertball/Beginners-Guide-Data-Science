Loved this.  Moist, tender, full of flavor, and adding some finely chopped red bell pepper made it pretty to boot.  I don't care for sweet corn bread, so using just two tablespoons of sugar rather than 1/3 cup was just right.  Can't say I would have enjoyed this nearly as much had I used that much sugar.   The size of the loaf pan wasn't specified - I used an 8x4," baking about 27 minutes.

We thought this was great! Made as written and would not change a thing. Loved the kick from the jalapeno (I did seed it b/c it was super hot), and the light onion and beer flavor. I made this to go w/ soup, but it would def be best w/ a nice big bowl of chili. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is an excellent recipe.  I only made 2 changes, did not have green onions so left that out and used 4 tsp. baking powder instead of 1 tsp. soda 1 tsp. powder.  This one I will definitely make again.  The beer I used was Shock Top Belgian White.....love the flavor that the beer adds!

I used an egg substitute, vegan buttermilk (almond milk & vinegar), and an IPA. I may have also dumped a little vegan cheddar into the mix with some oregano and cayenne.

Really, really good. I made a double batch so my family could munch on it for a few days, and the jalapeños and green onion completely lost their flavor by the next day...it just tasted like corn bread. It was great the day of though!

I made it exactly as is with no changes and it was awesome! Actually I take that back..I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I soured some regular milk with vinegar which is always a great substitute when you run out of buttermilk. The cornbread was a little sweet but not too sweet & a little spicy but not too spicy. The balance was perfect. I made this to go with chili and it was a great combo together. I will definitely make again & will not change a thing.

We enjoyed this corn bread served with 'Pork and Black Bean Stew' from AR.  I made a half batch and baked it in a casserole dish in the toaster oven.  My jalapeños had turned red, so they were warm but not as warm as a green one would have been.  A tasty corn bread that I will be making again.

Didn't have jalapeno on hand so used thai green chilis, seeded. What a great recipe, so delicious. I'll make this one again for sure.  Thanks!

This had a strange, almost musty flavor from the peppers. I used a standard American pilsner, so I suppose I could change to a better quality beer, which may make it taste a bit richer, but I don't think it would change the odd flavor.

This is a winner!  We are on a low salt diet, so I left out the salt, and cut the buttermilk to ¼ cup.  Used beer for the additional  liquid needed.  Used 2 jalapeno peppers, and a whole bunch of green onions. Also added some red pepper flakes. (We like heat!)  Cooked in a cast iron skillet and made sure oil was smoking hot before pouring in the batter so that the bottom would fry and form a good crust.  Hubby said this was the best cornbread I had ever made, and not to make any other cornbread in future.  We loved it!

This is a good recipe. I baked for 30 minutes and it was underdone. The toothpick came out clean but there was a squishy spot in the middle. Definitely need to be careful with corn bread because I think the batter may be less likely to stick to the toothpick. I used Great Lakes Eliot Ness Amber Lager and that was perfect. I only used half the pepper's seeds and ribs and it was only  mildly spicy, but that can depend on the pepper. I made 3 different corn bread recipes that night this included. I'll be looking for a slightly less dense recipe for next time.

Stellar!  Only changes we made were to substitute honey for the sugar, dice up some jarred jalepeno slices in place of a fresh pepper, and top with some cheddar cheese. Took a little longer to bake, but SO delicious!

Delicious!!  We mad this with some homemade chicken chili and it was the bomb.  We also added some mild roasted red peppers and sprinkled a little grated cheddar across the top.  Wish I'd doubled the batch---It was that good!

Made it as directed. Very nice texture- not too crumbly. Good flavor.

Awesome flavor.  I made it into mini muffins as part of a Mexican fiesta.  Also added chopped red peppers for color.

I made it per the recipe and took it to a party.  It got good reviews, but personally I wasn't crazy about it.  I am going to make it again, but not with the ale.  It gave it a taste I wasn't crazy about.  I am sure it is a personal preference. And the loaf was moist.  And I sprinkled cheese on top as another cook suggested which  was good.  I am going to make it again, but add more "heat",  and no ale.
