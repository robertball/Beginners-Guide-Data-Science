A delicious soup, which also has great eye appeal due to the lovely color.   I used regular sea salt as I didn't have grey, and skipped the gremolata.   Well received by adults and teens!   Will definitely make again.  Thank you!

As with the other reviews, I made some changes myself.  I substituted sea salt for grey salt, and used ground thyme instead of fresh.  Honestly, I'm not sure this recipe even needed the cream - it was the best broccoli soup I've ever had without it.  Next time, I'm going cream-free.

I didn't make the gremolata (served with hot garlicky rolls) but this soup was excellent. I chose the buttermilk option with the full complement of lemon zest and it was terrific. I did wind up adding more salt, but it does specify "to taste" so that wasn't a problem for me. Also, "gray salt" just sounds like a pretentious ingredient, so I used Morton's garlic sea salt like always, nomnom.  Thanks for the recipe, we'll definitely use this again!

Peeled the stocks from 2 bunches of broccoli , and omitted the florets because I was using them in a salad. Didn't have the fresh spinach, so substituted fresh kale, it was just as good.

Very good! I made some adjustments. I left out the garlic - my husband is allergic - didn't have fresh thyme, so used dried, used half chicken broth, and half vegetable broth, and wanted to cut the fat, so used 2% milk instead of whipping cream. The result was still great! Don't skip the Gremolata - it really added some elegance to the dish.

Great recipe! I have made this without the whipping cream and love the fresh flavor and that it also lowers the calorie count. Have subbed cauliflower too and it was just as good.

Used Swiss chard in place of celery & spinach since I didn't have them. Very good.

This is a beautiful, tasty soup. I made it as the recipe stated except for the gremolata... I didn't have any panko so I made some quick croutons while the soup was cooking. The soup looked spectacular with the croutons, toasted pine nuts and chopped fresh parsley on the top. Thank you for the recipe! It's a keeper.
