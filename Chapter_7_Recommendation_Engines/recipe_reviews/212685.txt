I had a similar dish a few years ago at an upscale Washington DC party. When I made this, the butcher de-boned the turkey. I also used apricots and prunes which were a great addition and flavour booster. Threw in some Port wine with cider AND used fresh sage because it pairs well with celery. Also used Italian Pannetone bread, however, I think that any good fruit bread will do the trick. If you use good day-old rustic Italian bread, just throw in more fruit. I also threw in some Port wine!!! This recipe is flexible and NOT difficult yet delivers great flavour. Don't be too concerned about using the "exact" measurements...go with your heart on this one!!
