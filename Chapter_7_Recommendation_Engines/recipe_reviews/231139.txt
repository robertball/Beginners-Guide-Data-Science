I just used the crepe recipe itself for some nutella and banana crepes. You have to flip them really fast, or lower the temp given otherwise you will burn the crepe.

I added Herbs de Provence and a pinch of salt to the eggs prior to scrambling and shredded sharp white cheddar and the resulting dish was enjoyable.  For company or special occasions I would top with a Hollandaise or at least some additional cheese.  I like that these are make ahead possible for those times when you want to make ahead.  Also, being that I am getting 6-7 eggs a day avg from my hens, a dish that uses this many eggs is a welcome addition to my rotation!

I think this recipe is good. I did however used full eggs as I wanted to make half the recipe and use less eggs. I made it for 6 using 4 full eggs. I must say that I did add salt and pepper to the mushrooms while I sautéed them. I only had shredded mild Cheddar cheese so I used it. The flavor was good and definitely I would recommend to add salt and pepper as others suggest. This recipe in my opinion could be made better tasting by using shredded Gruyère cheese. It's mild tangyness will boost this entire recipe to a five star one.

It says 5T sugar, divided, but I only found a use for 3T.   I think I'll add meat next time.

Good crepe recipe base.  I changed  up the topping, but whatever you want to stuff in your crepe, this recipe will satisfy your needs.
