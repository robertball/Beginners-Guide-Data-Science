So so so good!  The candied ginger is what did it for me.  If you can't find it, don't worry!  It's very easy (and cheap) to make.  Here's what I did: bring 1 1/3C sugar and 1C water to a boil.  Add 1C chopped, peeled ginger and simmer for 20 minutes.  Drain, dry and sprinkle with sugar.  It's quite strong when eated alone but when baked into this bread, it just adds a super rich flavor and a fun chewy texture.

I have looked high and low...experimenting with various gingerbread recipes, and finally I have found this one! It is wonderful! The taste is superb and so is the moist texture. It might look like a lot of work, but it's not, and any work is WELL worth it!!

This is a delicious, moist, dark, rich molasses- flavorful gingerbread cake that is not too sweet.  I use butter instead of oil.  On occasion applesauce is added instead of the juice due to what I have on hand.  My family and friends have enjoyed this cake many times.  My family doesn't care for crystallized ginger so don't use it.  Great with Cool Whip.

WATCH OUT!! This is Addictive!!! I baked it as muffins for the band members and they all LOVED it!  I also did not include the crystalized ginger.  I used 1 1/2 cup flour & 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and added 5 Tbsp. melted butter for  more moisture.  I am making more tomorrow because its all gone!

This has got to be the absolute BEST recipe for gingerbread I have ever tasted.  I can't stop making it...it's addicting!  I don't use the crystallized ginger because I cannot seem to find it, however it is great with homemade cream cheese frosting on top and fridgerated.  This beats STARBUCKS' a million to one!!

Yummmmm! This ginger bread is exactly what I was looking for.. I used half WW half AP flour, half brown half white sugar, applesause instead of juice, and reduced the molasses by about 1/3. I also didn't have fresh ginger so I doubled the ground ginger, and I had to sub nutmeg for the cloves and it was fine. I only baked it for 30 mins, then I turned the oven off and left it to cool inside. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it was to die for! Love it, thank you for the great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe, reminiscent of the one I used to make in a wholesale bakery.  I couldn't find crystallized ginger, so I had to omit it.  And I only used 1/2 cup molasses instead of the full cup.  It was perfect!  The only thing I'd change next time is baking it for 45-50 minutes, as mine is slightly overbaked.  It's still a keeper though -- thanks for the recipe!

My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it!  I baked it in small loaves for him to take to work, the cook time was reduced this way to about 35 min.

Very nice!  I made this as a cake for a cake walk fundraiser we are having next week, so I made in an angel food bundt pan.  I also don't have fresh ginger so I just used two teaspoons of ground ginger total.  I don't remember if crystalized ginger and candied ginger are the same (I think not, but like I said I can't remember) but I have candied, so I used that.  I didn't have enough molasses, but I used the amount I had (at little over 1/2 c I think).  I set a little bit of the batter aside and made a cupcake so I could try.  So good! I really like this gingerbread taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

UCK - don't know what went wrong - great creative ingredients, after 90 minute of baking in the 10"springform (didn't say 10: springform TUBE pan) the thing was still an uncooked glob except for the burnt edges.  Spooned some of the goo out into a pie pan hoping that at least both pans full of goo would bake and be tasty - turned into TWO pans of greasy mess.  Threw it away.  Will add the grated fresh ginger and crystalized ginger to one of my tried and true gingerbread recipes.

You have to make this gingerbread! I made it last week, into cupcakes, and it is fantastic. I adore the gingerbread at Starbucks and this really is better. I'm back to the site because I'm making this again for Christmas Eve. I'm going to use the round springform pan as suggested. Like another reviewer, I used OJ instead of apple & it came out just fine. Candied/Crystalized ginger was a challenge to find, so I may leave it out this time if I can't find it. I made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting to go with this... (2 blocks of cream cheese, tsp cinnamon & cup of powered sugar, tsp of vanilla) although a nice big scoop of whipped cream would do the trick, too.  

Anyway!  Great recipe!  Just Delicious!

Oh, yes, this is a keeper.  I made two different gingerbreads yesterday to let the family decide on the best, and this was it.  Dark and spicy and yummmm.  I messed up on the recipe and accidently put the fresh ginger in the other bread (whoops) and I didn't put in the candied ginger either, but the flavor in this cake was still exceptional.  The only thing my kids requested for next time was to add chocolate chips :)

Just one note (a year later).  I have brought this to a few gatherings and the adults love it, but I think it is a bit too spicy for most kids.

I thought this was really good!  I loved using three types of ginger.  I had a golden delicious apple on hand and so I diced half of it and added it in.  It was a pleasure to make and to eat.  Thank you for sharing this recipe; I intend to bake it again.

Dark, rich and fabulous!  The bits of candied ginger are wonderful flavor bursts.  I might use even more next time.

The only change I made, by necessity, was to use orange juice instead of apple.  Served with a cream cheese frosting dotted with more candied ginger.  I'll be making this again frequently, especially as holidays approach.

This is a superb, easy recipe that goes great with a cuppa joe.  I've added this to my recipe box, because I'll be making this again.  The fresh ginger adds extra zing and just a bit of bite.  I made this in a 9x13 pan, because I like to cut my gingerbread in squares.  I used one cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added an extra teaspoon of ground ginger, and used two cups of white flour and one cup whole wheat.  I couldn't find candied ginger, but I'll bet that would add a nice flavor note.  Next time I'll try adding a half stick of butter to see what happens.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  Many reviewer have left out the crystallized ginger because they can't find it. In my opinion the crystallized ginger makes this recipe extra special, so don't leave it out.  It is also called candied ginger and can be found in the bulk section of many supermarkets.  Thanks for sharing!

amazing! I substitued orange juice since that's what I had on hand and it was incredibly good.  A great mix and better than the gingerbread I regularly buy at Whole Foods Market (but to be fair, that is really good stuff!)

This turned out ok. I cooked it for only 50 minutes and at a lower temp and the edges turned out too hard. The inside cake was soft and moist. Not too sweet, which balances nicely with cinnamon icing mentioned below (loved it BTW). I'll still make this again.

I took this to my office and it was gone by lunch, with a lot of people asking for the recipe. It's really wonderful and very gingery, which I like, especially the candied ginger. It's fantastic with black coffee. I baked it in two loaf pans for about 45 minutes, and served it over the next two days with butter. I didn't have apple juice so I used white grape juice, and I ran out of molasses at about 3/4 cup so I topped it off with maple syrup. Otherwise the recipe stayed the same. I'll try this again, and I'd like to see how it turns out if I replace some of the oil with applesauce. Thanks very much!

From all the absolutely glowing reviews I expected to like this cake more than I did.  I'm an absolute ginger NUT so the prospect of three sources of that spicy delight was tantelizing.  The thought that people decreased the oil and still found it to be moist was promising.  I followed the recipe as written and it *was* good, but not the WOW experience I had hoped for.  I glazed it (as suggested) with powdered sugar and juice (orange rather than lemon because I had just squeezed some oranges).  Don't know what to do differently next time (yes, there *will* be a next time) but I'll fiddle around with it.  THANK YOU for sharing the recipe and for all the reviewers comments!

Perfect as is!  I frosted the top with a Grand Marnier buttercream. Next time I do that I will cut the sugar in the bread.  Frosted or plain, it's delicious!

This recipe makes the very best gingerbread ever!  I made it a bit better, nutrition-wise, by substituting applesauce for the oil, splenda for sugar, and using one-half whole wheat flour.  I also put a lemon glaze (1 3/4 cups powdered sugar mixed w/ 5 tbs lemon juice) on top as soon as it came out of the over.  Mmmmmm!  To me and my mom, this gingerbread is Christmas!

This should have been great, with all that ginger, but I thought the flavor was so-so, and the texture was very heavy -- all that oil!!!!

I made this last night using a bunt pan.  I read in other reviews where it sunk in the middle, so I only used 1 teaspoon baking soda, then added 1 teaspoon baking powder.  It still sunk some in the middle, however being it was in a bunt pan, it wasn't a bid deal at all for me as it was on the bottom once flipping it out.  The only other changes I made to the recipe was I traded one cup of the white flour for one cup of whole wheat flour, and I used orange juice instead of apple.  This has a very gingery flavor.  I love it, especially if you heat it up in the microwave for 20 or 30 seconds.  I will definitely make again!

This is an awesome recipe!!  Very gingery and not too heavy. BUT, mine sank in the middle??! I Googled the problem and the answer was probably too much baking soda.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen?  It does call for 2 teaspoons which did seem high, and I'm pretty sure I measured correctly.  I'm going to try it again and cut it to 1 teaspoon.  Also recommended on Google was to be sure to use a pre-heated oven which I did.  Any comments

I used nutmeg in place of cloves because I didn't have any cloves and used the squeeze ginger since I didn't have candied ginger. Also, used brown sugar in place of the molasses. I made muffins instead of bread  and they turned out great.

Very gingery and moist ... I made it exactly as written to use up some crystalized ginger I had on hand. My partner loved it

What a great recipe! I topped frosted it with Janni's Cream Cheese Frosting II and it was a hit.  The Starbuck's aficionados in the group loved it.  I substituted the apple juice for orange as nobody drinks apple juice in the house and the leftovers would have been wasted.  I was also concerned about guests biting into the crystallized ginger so I pulsed it in my Magic Bullet which formed a paste and added the paste. Lastly, I baked it in a loaf pan and sliced it like bread.  I had to bake it almost 1.5 hours this way but I preferred the appearance....flip it upside down and its a perfect shape for frosting and slicing.  Definite keeper

I feel like I wasted my time grinding spices for this recipe, because all I can taste is molasses and sugar. Ten minutes out of the oven (still warm), this unfortunately tastes and smells too strongly of molasses - and the apple juice adds an extra, fruity undertone that pushes the sweetness of this recipe over the top.

Nice recipe!  I used whole wheat flour, and substituted ginger candy that I crushed for the crystalized ginger which I couldn't find.  The bread had a dark, rich color and really carried the molasses flavor.  The ginger flavor was nice but next time I'll add more for my liking.  The only problem was the middle sank when I opened the oven door.  The edges get quite hard but the taste is quite delicious.  I'll try this recipe again!

The flavor of the finished product is excellent if you are looking for a strong and dark ginger flavor.  I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions - replacing 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce (which I always do when baking breads like this) and using pear cider instead of apple juice.  The three sources of ginger plus the molasses produces an intense flavor that cannot be ignored and smells amazing during the baking process.  That said, I had the same problem some others did though not to the same extent.  Because I was using this to form the base of another recipe (The British Baker's Ginger Pear Trifle which you should make!!)aesthetics weren't really an issue.  So, I went with a loaf pan and a round stoneware baking pan in an attempt to avoid the overdone/underdone issue.  It worked part way.  In the round pan, by the time the center was done the edges were definitely overdone.  I ended up cutting about one to 1 1/2 inches off the outside and just using the middle section. In the loaf pan it was a half inch edging that needed to come off and the center also fell when I first tested it so I ended up with a bit of a sunken middle.  If you can find the correct pan size to avoid that issue, the taste of this bread is worth the effort.

I had some candied ginger in the fridge that I wanted to use up, and thought this would be a good way to use some of what I had. The recipe was pretty simple to follow, and I even used my springform pan too cook it. HOWEVER, it turned out horrible (and I am not a novice baker)!! Once my cake reached the higher end of the time range for baking, the center of my cake was still not cooked. I left it in for another 10 minutes. The center still didn't seem set, but I took it out anyway to prevent the outside from burning. While cooling, the entire cake sank in the middle. I still cut into it to see if I would be able to salvage it. The outer edge of it was hard, the middle of it was completely sunk in, and it wasn't even completely cooked. I will never make this recipe again. Such a waste of great ingredients.

Loved this recipe.  I made cupcakes to take into work and everyone else quite enjoyed them as well.  Reduced cooking time to 18-20 minutes for cupcakes.  I didn’t use the oil at all, substituted ¼ cup butter and a splash more apple juice.  I thought the cupcakes turned out well and moist enough for everyone.

Thank you for a great recipe!  I made mine into muffins, with half wholemeal and half white flour, half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar and only half a cup of molasses and they turned out great.  I got 12 large muffins... they rose beautifully and gave crunchy muffin tops straight from the oven.  I cut back on the spices as these were for my 3 year old... I only used 1 tspn cinnamon and 1 tspn cloves and I didn't have any crystallised ginger, but they still tasted fantastic.  After a night in the fridge they tasted even better as the flavours really blended in.  I never found out whether they tasted even better after 2 days cos they were all gone by then!! I'll definitely be making these again.
