Good recipe - just a little adjustment would make it even better.   Per drink -  1 oz. Vodka,  1 oz. Triple Sec, and 1/2 oz. of Rose's Lime Juice makes the perfect Kamikaze.

I made these as cocktails before a dinner party last week. We sat on the patio & sipped & all 6 of us raved about the taste......a keeper for sure! Having the glasses chilled really helps keep it cool for those hot summer days!
Thanks for a great recipe!

It was very good.  Virtually, a vodka margarita.  I had to quadruple the recipe, as I was serving 4.  Great with a lime wedge.
