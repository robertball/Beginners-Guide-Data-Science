I just prepared it yesterday and everybody loved it. I used minced garlic and ground ginger and it worked well. It was a little bitter because of the grapefruit but the ginger gives it a great taste.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated (with the exception of marinating it for 2 hours rather than only 1), and my husband and I found it to be quite bland. I'm not sure why, but there was no grapefruit, garlic, or ginger taste at all, just a hint of the soy sauce. If I make it again, I will make extra sauce, and boil it down as a reduction to pour  on top after cooking.

I really loved the flavors.  I had a piece of young ginger (totally different from ground ginger or even regular ginger root, so I changed the recipe a bit) that went perfectly with the salmon and grapefruit.  I also used fresh garlic that I made into a paste with a bit of salt, and I added a pinch of monk fruit sugar to balance the bitterness of the grapefruit.  Regular caster sugar would have been fine, but I happened to have a sample packet of monkfruit sugar on hand.  I'll make this recipe again.

I made this recipe solely for the marinade. I didn’t have salmon but I had tilapia. I used the juice of a whole grapefruit and the rest of the ingredients stayed the same. The cooking time didn’t fit for the tilapia so I adjusted the time. I feel the cooking time for any type of fish will vary by the size and thickness of the fish, so this recipe for me was just an estimate. The tilapia came out perfectly! Very flavorful and tasty. I’ve made this marinade twice now with no issues and perfect flavor.

Very bland. Followed exact instructions. I love salmon, and this is definitely not the right way to make salmon. Temperature, cooking time, marinating, etc was all wrong.
