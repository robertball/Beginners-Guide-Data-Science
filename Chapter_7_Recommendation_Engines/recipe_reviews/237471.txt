A northeastern ohio/ western PA classic!  I remember asking a butcher in NC for city chicken and he looked at me like I was crazy.  This is exactly how we make city chicken.  Sometimes we serve with a package of chicken gravy but usually not.  Just yum... If you aren't familiar with this dish give it a try.

I've made City Chicken for 30 years. . .but with one twist.  After frying, I put it in a covered oven safe dish and sprinkle liberally with water.  Then bake for 2 hours in a low oven 275 - 300.  While baking sprinkle 2 or 3 more times with water.  This causes steam in the covered dish and makes the meat so tender it melts in your mouth.  Everyone that tries these says they are the best!  This trick came from a little polish lady from the old country who said this is how the did it way back then and believe me the extra time waiting for it to cook is well worth the wait!

My mother and grandmother used to make this for me as a kid.  I loved it with mashed potatoes and gravy.  It was a simpler recipe minus the pepper and thyme and alternating cubes of veal, but delicious anyway. 
As a note, I like to use hardwood skewers rather than bamboo.  The bamboo tends to splinter which punctures fingers and remains in the meat.

After reading some other recipes for city chicken I decided to improvise.  After I browned everything I put a rack in my skillet, added some chicken broth and white wine to the bottom.  I put the skewers back on top of the rack, put a lid on and simmered until the liquid evaporated.  I removed the rack, put the city chicken skewers back in to crisp up again.  They were tender and tasty.
