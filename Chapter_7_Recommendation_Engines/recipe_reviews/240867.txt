If you are doing a Daniel Fast, note that brown rice syrup is not allowed. Also, some people do not use vanilla extract on the fast as it contains alcohol. That being said, I made this recipe without the brown rice syrup, but with vanilla extract and a little almond extract. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Both my husband and I found it very tasty!

I added chia seeds, hemp hearts, ground almond and toasted cocoanut and switched to real maple syrup. Also added another 20gms protein powder for the extra bang and I really like the taste of them!
