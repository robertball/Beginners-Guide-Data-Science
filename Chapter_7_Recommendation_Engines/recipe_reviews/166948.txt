This is now my new favorite dressing.  I absolutely love it.  The only change I made was it needed a little mustard. But other than that it was brilliant.

This is very good and got lots of great reviews! The only change I would make is to maybe up the honey to balsamic ratio. Thanks!

Loved this....I halved the recipe and found it to be a really good balance between the vinegar and honey.....I only used 1 tblspn. on my Simple Spinach Salad (on this site) and found it to be perfect. Will make this again!

I've been skeptical in the past about putting soy sauce and balsamic vinegar together, but I was pleasantly suprised. My balsamic isn't the greatest quality, so I reduced it on the stove then added the honey while it was warm, this helped the honey melt in. Served this while the dressing was still warm on a salad of baby greens, caramelized red onions, fresh blueberries, goat cheese and toasted walnuts and it tasted amazing!

Very, very sweet - next time I might cut down on the amount of honey.  I added a bit of yellow mustard like a couple of other reviewers which was a perfect addition. As the submitter states, a little does go a long way....

Excellent dressing!  I have made the original recipe in the past and loved it but today I felt adventurous and I added 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon of onion powder, the juice of a 1/4 lemon and a pinch of dried parsley.  With this, who needs store bought dressing!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I like that if you need to do dressing for one, it is perfectly portioned to break down that way. That said, it would be one big salad, for it is potent. Dressing for one, will likely do twice for me. Good stuff though. Thank you.

A delicious dressing made with simple pantry items. I made an amazing tomato basil salad with the dressing. I will be making this dressing again.  As another reviewer stated - a little of this dressing goes a long way.

I enjoyed the flavor of this vinaigrette as per the recipe, but added just a small amount of sour cream so that the dressing would cling better to my salad greens.  My photo is not representative of what this recipe should look like as I also used blush balsamic vinegar instead of the usual dark red.

Is it too strong of a statement to say this dressing changed my life?!  I ate only bottled thousand island dressing for many years and thought it was the only thing I'd ever like.  I was sure I wouldn't like "healthy dressings" so I never bothered to make them myself because I thought it would taste bland.
However, this dressing is absolutely delicious.  It's probably not low fat or low calorie, but I consider it more healthy than bottled because it doesn't have the preservatives, and I know exactly what's going into it.  And I'm not getting overloaded with sugar, as there's just a small amount from the honey and soy.
It couldn't be simpler to make, and the recipe scales easily to a single serving.
Perfection!

I absolutely love this recipe! I've been making this for a while and just today realized that I never left a comment. There is no need to change anything on this recipe; all the ingredients are just well balanced. Thanks Madenish, this is one of our favorites!

This is an extremely simple and decadent, delicious dressing. I used it last night over a salad with crumbled feta and a side of pita bread.  I find it also delicious without any soy sauce at all; I am salt-sensitive, and I noticed my tongue shrinking from the small amount the first time I had tried it. But it still holds well, with or without it - and I've tried it both ways.  For a single-serving, I use one spoon honey, one spoon balsamic vinegar, to two spoonfuls olive oil.

I 'invented' this recipe back in 1994, although I'm sure it was just a case of serendipity. 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup honey, and 1 tsp. soy sauce. I also added 1/2 tsp. of Dijon mustard. Wonderfully savory on all kinds of salads. The key to this is that less is more. If I overdo it, I strain and reuse the surplus.

Delicious!  Makes me want to eat salad everyday.  Especially good with an avocado, tomato, walnut, goat cheese, shredded carrots and lettuce mix.

Such and simple and delicious dressing!  I made exactly as written for a party sized salad, and still had a little left in the jar.  Recieved a ton of compliments on the salad, and many mentioned the dressing, too.  Thanks for sharing with AR!  OH, BTW, here is the salad I used it on. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/parrothead-salad/Detail.aspx

This is absolutely delicious!!  Normally I'm a vinegar snob, I use only the best balsamic vinegar in salad dressings and cooking (good balsamic is so much sweeter!).  This actually tastes just as good with the cheap balsamic vinegar, probably because of the honey.  I usually make this dressing when I need a batch of salad dressing, but I don't want to use my expensive balsamic!

Great Dressing!!! I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. It tasted so good had it on a plain mixed of spring and spinach paired with strawberries and a sandwich. Has it for lunch today at school, bringing out the jealousy in people.

This is an awesome vinaigrette recipe!  I ate salad everyday last week since I made the dressing, and I'm not usually a "salad" person...it was just so good!  The nice thing is, it can be tweaked to suit your individual taste.  I personally like it just the way it is!

Maybe because I used expensive balsamic, this dressing turned out too strong.  I gave it three stars based on this exact recipe.  Once I tweaked it and added more oil and honey to balance, it was a 4-5 star recipe.

This was a touch too sweet for me.  I omitted the soy sauce and added 1 T. Dijon mustard, 1/4 t. garlic powder and 1/8 t. black pepper.  It is perfect served with bitter greens and feta cheese.

Excellent and simple. Didn't have soy sauce on hand so I added a pinch of kosher salt and was little heavy w/ the honey 'cause I like its' sweetness and it turned out great. Served on a bed of baby spinach, some grated mazorella cheese and toasted almonds...DEVINE!

I usually don't care much for vinaigrettes, but this is my new favorite dressing!  I didn't change a thing and I love it.  I did find it to be better from the second day on, the flavor of the honey seemed to mellow a bit and all the flavors blended to perfection!

I absolutely LOVED this dressing.  I didn't find it too strong for my tastes, but a little did go a long way, so don't drench your salad in it.  I used it on a leafy salad that had some goat cheese in it as suggested and it was outstanding.  I want to make this in a larger batch to keep on hand!

This is a great dressing. It is very strong, so like other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way! I added about 2 tsp of honey mustard and it really made the consistency much better.

Though I'm not a big balsalmic vinegar person, this recipe looked okay, plus, I intended to use the mustard modifications from other reviewers.  Just not for me -- way too sweet, and it didn't have the right balance to the vinegar.  I doubt even modifying the honey would make me like it.

My new favorite dressing; it goes well with a all green salad with veggies or fruit (strawberries).  I keep tightly sealed bottle on the counter for use at any time.

There's a proper way to dress a salad. Rightly so, a little DOES go a long way! The only change I made was to omit the soy sauce and replace it with 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard. It emulsified nicely and tasted great on a spinach salad with roma tomatoes, english cucumber, walnuts and goat cheese! (I store my leftover dressing in a glass jar at room temperature for a few days until I use it all up.)

Balsamic vinaigrette is my favourite and I always buy them from the store. I got tired of it and start looking for a home made recipes but none of them seems to stand out..... until I came across this recipe! I've made it time and time again over the last year and is always a hit when I have visitors. People keep asking me for the recipe, its thay good! Thank you for sharing it with us. I don't buy dressing anymore. 
I made a couple changes  and this is personal preference : I use 1:3 ratio of vinegar to oil and I left out the sugar. I find that honey alone is sweet enough for my family.

Delicious!!  I am not a big fan of soy sauce so I used a teaspoon of Dijon mustard instead.  I put all the ingredients in a jar with a screw on lid and shook until blended.  Easy to store in the fridge and a quick shake before using reblends the ingredients.  I like how this dressing clings to the greens  better than a typical vinaigrette.

This dressing is very good. I added about a teaspoon or so of Dijon mustard based on some of the other comments. I also used a little more EVO.

I upped the vinegar and honey to taste and added garlic powder. I wish I could add notes to this recipe like I used to in what used to be my recipe box but I cant stand this new format

Added some Dijon mustard (about 1 Tbsp)and just a tiny bit more olive oil than called for because I don't like my dressings too strong, but I really liked this.  The soy sauce is a great addition that I don't usually use in my dressings.

This was delicious and will be making this often!! I used the dressing with a spinach/baby green lettuce mix with red onion, sliced, toasted walnuts, chopped, strawberries and kiwi, along with goat cheese, it was tasty but makes plenty for leftovers!! It got rave reviews from my last party that I served this at this summer!!

This dressing was so easy, and tasted great! I didn't have quite enough vinegar though, so I substituted the rest with lemon. I also added a little yellow mustard. This beats any store bought vinaigrette!

GREAT! I only made enough for one small bowl of salad, so I just used less of each ingredient in a 2:1:1 ratio with a tiny bit of soy sauce. I didn't have olive oil so I just used veg. oil, which was ok for such a small amount.

Fast, easy, and delicious.  You can easily customize it. If you want more sweetness-add more honey.  More tang-add more vinegar.  A few grinds of black pepper add an extra zip, too.

This was good but I wanted it a little sweeter and flavorful so used equal parts  honey and balsamic.  I also added salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  This improved the taste tremendously!

Nice dressing.  I scaled this to 2 servings for lunch for bf and I.  I put it on salad that I added leftover potatoes and steak to.  The dressing is good but it didn't wow us.  I added some garlic powder for a bit more flavor; I think something stronger has to go in this though in order to get through the vinegar flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great variation on a regular olive oil/balsamic dressing I'd grown tired of. If I would change anything the next time I make it, I might cut back on the vinegar a bit and add a little freshly ground black pepper to give it a little more zip.

Great dressing. I halved the recipe, and still had enough for two salads for two seperate meals. As per reviewer's suggestion I added a tiny bit of dijon mustard. I served it with mixed greens, dried cranberries, and goat cheese with rave reviews from everyone!

Something about this dressing tasted very weak and flat to me. The oil/vinegar ratio was too low and left the dressing without any mouth feel. It also lacked a certain "zip" to it and would have been better with something pungent like mustard and/or garlic.
