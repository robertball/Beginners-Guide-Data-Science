Yum! This is how I changed it.
Browned a lb of ground turkey, drained and set aside. Cooked a medium onion and a few cloves of garlic in some olive oil, then added the turkey back to the skillet. Added a can of cream of chicken soup, a few splashes of chicken broth to thin to the consistency I like, about a half a cup of sour cream. I also added a can of peas and a few generous shakes of paprika and cayenne pepper. Turned out wonderful and very thick!

This was a pretty good base recipe.  With my additiond it was a 5.  I think that it would be a bit bland if made as stated.  I added a whole onion diced fine, 2 cloves of garlic, 8 oz sliced mushrooms, I used water instead of milk and added sour cream at the end.  Oh, I also added peas for color and nutrition. This was quite tasty and quick.  My son ate his with ketchup!  Two servings, whatever works!

With a few modifications, this was great!  I used 1 can of chicken broth insted of the water.  I also added 1 clove of fresh garlic with the onion and the meat.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper and some garlic salt to spice it up s bit.  During the last minute of cooking, I added about 2 Tbs. of sour cream.  It was wonderful and very quick & easy!  I will definitely make again!

This recipe tasted really good, but like many others, I altered the recipe. I sauteed 1/4 onion with one clove of garlic in some EVOO. I transferred it to another dish and cooked up the ground turkey. After that was cooked I added back the onion and garlic, then used a 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup, 3/4 cup of light sour cream, and a splash or two of salt free chicken broth. Once mixed in I added sliced mushrooms and peas. I didn't need to add any salt, but my husband did add cracked pepper to his serving. We also used egg noodles. For the amount of turkey we had, it only made 3 good size servings.
I typically don't have sour cream around, so this is a meal I will have to prepare for.

This was a good start, but I read through all the other reviews and added a lot of what others did and it came out great. I used chicken broth, and I added some merlot and sour cream until it tasted just right. I also added some fresh garlic while I cooked the ground turkey and I think that really helped to season the meat. After all the adjustments, it was awesome and even my husband said that he liked it way better than any hamgurger helper...(ha ha).

I thought this was a great basic recipe.  I omitted the water and the onion flakes.  Instead, I slivered one small white onion and one clove garlic, then sauteed the turkey with that.  I also added about 2 tbsps. dried parsley flakesfor flavor and color, and one can of sliced mushrooms, drained, then salted with a bit of garlic salt. At the end, I added one cup sour cream, which you really need to do  if you want this to taste anything like stroganoff and not just ground turkey gravy.  I did like how it turned out, served it over wide egg noodles, and will be making it again. Thanks for the idea!  SUPER easy to pull together.

I followed recipe exactly as stated (but did add peas for color).  My family was very happy with how it turned out (all had seconds!) and I loved that it was quick, easy and fairly healthy!!

I made this recipe, but changed a few things.  I added a little butter,it made it taste richer, fat free half and half, instead of water,a half a container of fat free sour cream, then for even more flavor, I added a little sage and a pinch of thyme.  It turned out wonderfully.  Nice for a cold night.

I then added a tbs of dijon to the cooked turkey.  When it was all melded I added the cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 c of sour cream,onion, mushrooms and garlic to the pot and then a dash of paprika.  Yummy, yummy and great for anyone on a budget. Added fresh parsley and butter to the egg noodles.   Thanks for the recipe, keeper in my book!

This recipe was very good.  i did do a few minor adjustments.  I added extra onions and a clove of garlic to the meat mixture.  And used a can of roasted garlic and cream of mushroom soup.  My husband and I enjoyed this.  And I will make it again.

I took this recipes one step further and turned it into a casserole. I added 1/2 large onion and 2 garlic cloves (minced) to the meat while browning plus seasoning. I then added a can of cream of celery soup in addition to the cream of mushroom soup, some fresh mushrooms, a bag of frozen peas, 1/4 cup water and 1/2 cup of shredded chedder cheese. Baked it for 20-25 min at 350 with shredded chedder cheese on top (about 1/2 cup). Great recipe. Definately a keeper.

I really wanted to like this.  After all, it is very similar to a recipe I make using ground beef.  But no one at my house liked it.  It just tasted very bland, and the paprika made it taste really strange.

Man was this a quick meal!  I added an onion to the meat while cooking and a little garlic powder/black pepper in addition to the paprika and salt.  Was a hit with the hubby and kids....definitely a keeper for busy weeknights.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I fixed this dish just the other day for the first time.  I read the reviews and decided to try it out for myself.  The Stroganoff was Great!  I added a few more onions than the recipe called for and I also added about a 1/3 cup of sour cream.  It was eyeballed so I am not sure of the measurement.  Before the sourcream was added I tasted it, and it was good...my husband loves to have the sour cream in his stroganoff so I added it... YUMM YUMM it made it a bit more creamy and yet wasn't too overpowering!  Very quick and simple to cook! Great when you are in a hurry!

This has become a regular dinner in my home- we made it for the first time in Fall of 2009 and I've made it many times since then! It is often my go-to recipe when I don't know what to cook because I always have the ingredients on hand and my hubby and son rave about how good it is every time! I usually use wheat pasta and sometimes I leave the bouillon or onion out and it is still great. I will often use a larger can or double the cream or mushroom soup to stretch it a little further since we devour this dish! I've also passed this recipe onto a friend and her family loves it too! Thank so much!

Any time you cook ground turkey, you have to season it like crazy, otherwise it will be bland.  I made some additions, and found this dish tasty.  I used more paprika, and also seasoned with Italian seasoning, Lawry's Seasoned Pepper & Seasoning salt.  I sauteed the onion and some minced garlic before adding the turkey & spices.  Drain the cooked turkey, add 3 cups of chicken broth & soup, bring to a boil then add thawed chopped spinach and uncooked noodles (I used wheat).  Let simmer until noodles are tender.  Garnish with shredded Italian cheese.  Came out great!  Easy and somewhat healthy.

I had some ground turkey in the fridge and didn't know what to do with it.  This recipe did the trick! Because i was too lazy to cut up an onion and crumble a bouillon cube, I used a dry onion soup mix instead.  My husband, a picky eater, liked the meal.

Delicious! Of course, I read the other reviews before I started cooking. This lead to a few changes: added peas (for color), cayenne pepper (for kick), used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup (because it was what I had) and a dash of sage and thyme. Great basic recipe that can be tweaked as needed. Thanks a million!

Save yourself the headache and DOUBLE this. It is so good that you will want leftovers. My Mom said she could eat the gravy over rice and still love it. I never cook with ground turkey, but it absorbs seasonings so well that you will prefer it over red meat.

I used real chopped onions, a few tablespoons worth; chicken stock instead of water and bouillon; and cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  I also sauteed a few tbsp minced garlic along with the chopped onion before adding the turkey.  We loved it! I wish we had had time to eat the leftovers but we had events all weekend.  Definitely would feed about 4 people and we are only two.

With a few tweaks, this was amazingly tasty as well as quick and easy.

I replaced the chicken bullion for a reduction of beef stock and a bit of dark beer, the water in the cream of mushroom mixture was replaced with 1% milk and I added a health bit of pepper.

These minor changes certainly made it into a "beefy" meal without the actual beef.

This is a definite keeper!  So easy, quick and tasty makes it 5 star in my book.  It is the kind of recipie which handles substitutions  and variations very well.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken.  I'm looking forward to trying it with the mushroom soup.  I did use broth instead of water and will add some sour cream next time.  Maybe some grated carrots, a dash of worchestershire......whatever! Thanks Lazygirl!  You're my kind of cook!

I used this recipe as a starting place for my Stroganoff. I sauteed half an onion, and about a tablespoon of minced garlic with the meat. I also added a small can of mushrooms, about a tablespoon of butter, a little cayenne pepper, plenty of fresh cracked black pepper, and threw in about a half cup of sour cream towards the end. It was FABULOUS!

I don't know that I would make it for holiday company or anything, but this recipe turned out GREAT and so quick and easy! Everyone in my family loved it, from my super picky husband to my toddler and 4 year old. It was really good and took less than half an hour to make with stuff I had on hand. Perfect for weeknight rush dinners.

I used dried onion flakes as they were what I had, and I added some extra onion powder (we like onion!) I also added a fair amount of minced garlic and some parsley flakes, put it over linguine and topped it with a handful of crushed fried onions, and really it was soooo delicious! Don't be stingy with the spices or I think it would turn out too bland. But as I made it it was perfect for our family.

For using ingredients I'm likely to have on hand, ease of cooking and speed of preparation time, plus a nice filling protein punch with great flavor, it gets 5 stars from me!

Yummy!  Loved this recipe.  Added some garlic & shallots.  Kept everything else as written.  Got rave reviews.  Next time I will leave out the oil because I did not think it was necessary.  Thanks!!

Added more flavor...more chopped onion, 2 cloves of minced garlic and fresh ground black pepper in with the turkey.  Used 1/2 cup of milk instead of water, and a couple dollops of fat free sour cream to thin the sauce a bit.  Also added in dill and caraway along with the paprika.  It was plenty salty already, no extra salt was needed.  Served over whole wheat noodles, tasty!

I would have given this a five, but after reading the reviews, I too felt it needed more life. I sautéed the onions in butter instead of oil,  I added 2 cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of smoked Hungarian paprika instead of regular. I had a red pepper and a large portobello mushroom hanging out in the fridge, so I diced  them up and tossed them in with the mushroom soup. I added a cup of my home made chicken broth instead of bouillon and water.  Lastly, I also added half a cup of sour cream. Super, super tasty and I will make it again!!! Thanks for the recipe and all of your reviews and tips!!

This tasted amazing!!!  Like some of the other reviewers, I added a can of peas to the mix and some sour cream.  Also, I didn't have noodles, so I broke up the angel hair pasta I had into 3 inch lengths, boiled it and served it with the Stroganoff, and I thought it was wonderful that way.  Certainly, this is the best recipe for ground turkey that I have ever tried.

Not bad... I didn't have bouillon so just more water for us.    And we had to use spaghetti.   I also added a very small amount of sour cream and cream cheese.

This is one of the few recipes my picky kids all liked. I used ground chicken because that is all I can get in China. I also added worstichire sauce, sour cream and Italian Seasoning. I just mixed it all together.  Finally a recipe we all liked.

More 3.5.  I added worcester sauce to the ground turkey with a pinch of oregano.  I also added white wine to the meat as it was cooking.  And used fresh mushrooms.  This was a very filling dish, and I could see myself making it again if I need to use up some ground turkey.

Increased onion to 1/2 of a chopped onion, and used about 1/2 a can of chicken broth instead of bouillon and water.  I also seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and added peas at the end.  It was very good, but it did need a little extra pepper at the table to give it some more kick!

yum!  I mondified:  Sauteed the turkey meat with onion, garlic, and a tiny bit of finely chopped celery.  For seasoning I used a dash of onion soup mix, cayenne pepper, parsley, and a dash of chicken boullion.  I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and added some canned mushrooms.  For liquid I used half cup skim milk and half cup water, and ended up thickening at the end with a flour roux.  Yum!

I am giving this 5 stars because I thought this was a great recipe to make when you are in a hurry to make something for dinner and have little time. It was fast and easy and you can add other items to it, such as mushrooms. We had enough for leftovers the next day too and since I was playing tennis 2 days in a row, this was a great recipe to come home too and not worry about what to make. Thanks!

I didn't tell anyone this recipe contained ground turkey rather that ground beef and they liked it!  Some would have never even tried it had they known it contained ground turkey.  I did add more onion, a couple of big cloves of minced garlic and a couple of big spoonful's of sour cream.  Will have this again.

This was yummy!  I ended up lightly browning half a chopped onion and a 2 tsp. garlic,  mixing in milk instead of water, adding a diced bell pepper (for a little color and crunch) and about a cup of sour cream.  I also made this with corkscrew pasta.  Filling and yummy!

We have made this at least a dozen times and it is always a hit with my husband.  Depending on our tastes that day, we will follow the recipe exactly or add more garlic, onion, etc.  The taste comes from the mushroom soup and bouillon, so don't leave it out.  For a quick stroganoff, I definitely give this five stars!

I had to make a coupe of changes due to what I didn't have available.   I browned the turkey, drained it, and poured the soup (I used cream of mushroom and roasted garlic) over the turkey with a can of mushrooms. I added chicken broth in place of the water and a small amount of butter and sour cream, some cayenne pepper and paprika. We added more sour cream to taste upon serving.  Great recipe! My husband had seconds - we will use it again!  :)  Thanks a lot!

This recipe is a great idea and tastes great.  Ground turkey is a great ground beef substitute, it sacrifices very little taste and gets rid of a lot of calories.  I cooked the recipe exactly like it said and had no troubles.

This was a good recipe, but I made some changes. I didn't have any chicken broth so I used Lipton's onion soup mix and water and a few dabs of Worsteshire sauce and cooked it with the ground turkey. Then I added the cream of mushroom soup. I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream and some salt and ground pepper. Absolutely delicious!! I'm going to try this with beef next time!

I made this dish three times, once sharing it with The Woman I Love. She gave it a 3-star rating, but I'll give it 4 stars. This is an easy-to-make comfort-food dish. It's the kind of thing that I just wolf down. But it's nothing particularly fancy, though - just good eating.
I did notice that the recipe doesn't call for draining the fat from the browned turkey. In my case, I used 85%-lean turkey, and the sauce wound up somewhat oily. Next time, I'll opt for the lean ground turkey (7% fat) that I saw in the store, and that should make the situation much better.

Great meal!  I also spiced it up a bit by using 1 whole (medium) finely chopped onlon, and added 3 Tbs. of fresh minced garlic to the Turkey while sauteing.  I added some Everglades seasoning, red pepper flakes, a few dashes of Texas Pete hot sauce, and paprika.  I did use milk and sour cream as others suggested, which created a perfect consistancy.  I put it over mashed potatoes instead of noodles, which was awesome, and peas to the side.

This was a good, fairly simple meal to prepare.  Even my mother, who doesn't care for the taste of ground turkey (especially in dishes where she's used to ground beef) enjoyed this.  As other reviewers suggested, I added a small onion and some garlic.  I also added some Bisto powdered gravy, to taste (didn't have any paprika, and wanted to season the turkey mixture a little bit)and a little bit of sour cream at the end.  My mom poured a little splash of Merlot over hers, which she said gave it a richer flavor.  Overall, a good way to use up ground turkey when you don't know what to make other than turkey burgers.

Although I added my own twist on this, it was absolutely delicious! First off, I did use all of the ingredients for the "stroganoff", but I added an envelope of onion soup mix and a generous amount of garlic & herb seasoning. I also substituted milk for the water, and increased it to about 2 cups. I added a can of sweet corn, and a can of sweet peas, and we had the mixture over mashed potatoes instead of noodles. It was wonderful....sort of like an inside-out sheperd's pie. My kid's couldn't get enough of it!

Made this recipe twice now - first time added some fat free half & half, second time some fat free sour cream.  Either way, add more liquid like the other commenters have suggested  My boyfriend and I love it. It's the new comfort food and I look forward to making it a lot this winter!

I used ground beef instead of turkey (hubbie's preference), added a couple of cloves of garlic and a few tablespoons of sour cream.  I still felt it was lacking, so I added some coriander, chili powder, and garlic powder.  Even after all the additions, we thought it was pretty bland.

I'm giving 4 stars because I did have to change a few things. First of all, I had to cut the recipe down to only 2 servings (just for me and hubby). I let the ground turkey and onions cook for about 15 minutes to make sure the onions were completely cooked through. I then added some garlic powder to the skillet along with the chicken bouillon. I also added about 1 to 2 tsp of chili powder, I just felt like the meat mixture needed a little something extra. I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup, so I added cream of chicken. Instead of using water I used some low sodium chicken broth. I let all of the above simmer for about 30-40 minutes. I always enjoy foods that have been cooked longer for some reason. My husband and I really liked this recipe with my modifications. I served the meat mixture over cooked wide egg noodles. I think next time I will have to incorporate some mushrooms into the meat mixture. All in all, this is a keeper and I will definitely make again soon! Thanks from one lazy girl to another!!!

Yum! I made a few changes...Using cream of chicken instead of mushroom...fried up the onions with a a couple cloves of minced fresh garlic..cooked it for double the time, all the while adding low sodium chicken broth. Added sour cream at the end...My hubby loved it, and he's picky!

This is an excellent, very tasty recipe. The only changes I made were to use chicken granules (handful) instead of the cube and only 1/4 cup of water. It needed no salt. This will be a favorite of mine. It would be good over toast, rice noodles, chow mein noodles or potato.

This was just not good to us, and once prepared I couldn't find the fix to make it semi-redeemable although tons of sour cream made it easier to eat. Sorry, I will keep looking.

Fairly good...husband said it reminded him of what his mother used to make in his childhood.  I didn't strictly adhere to the recipe though....sauteed 3 cloves garlic along with the onion and turkey and seasoned with salt and pepper as well as a little garlic powder.  I completely bypassed the boullion (didn't have any on hand..imagine that!) so as I added the mushroom soup I also added a small 8 oz. container of light sour cream and a small can of sliced mushrooms along with the paprika, didn't add any water at all.  It was very creamy and thick, next time I might add some fresh peas for color and to add another veggie to the table.  We served ours with garlic toast and broccoli/cauliflower medley.  Will surely make this again.

I made this recipe last night with great success.  My husband who refuses to eat Hamburger Helper said this was good.  This is a easy, delicious dinner.  I made a few very minor changes.  I used a little more onion than 1 TBL, added 2 tsp minced garlic (from a jar), added a 4 oz can of mushrooms, added 1 additional crushed cube of chicken bouillon and reduced the paprika to 1/2 TBL.  Also, I melted about 1/3 c. butter into egg noodles.  This is really worth a try!  My picky family ate it!

Great for a quick weekday meal, I used cream of chix soup and 1/2 C milk, instead of water. Add salt, pepper, parsley and a roll. It's a great meal, when you dont feel like spending to much time in the kitchen.

I made a lot of changes. I caramelized an onion, added celery mushrooms and a red pepper. I only wanted the pepper for colour. Next time I will use peas. Also added Worcestershire sauce(1 tbls)  some garlic and a tsp of Montreal chicken spice.  After reading some of the other reviews I also used chicken stock instead of water. Turned out pretty good, the family ate it up:) Cheers to all.

To me, it was just okay. I made exactly like the recipe read. I may play with the recipe a little next time to see if my taste buds agree more next time.  Great idea though.

I doubled the recipe... I used a combo of ground turkey and chicken. I also used cream of chicken.  And instead of paprika I used portuguese seasoning...

This was surprisingly good. At first I was a tad skeptical since I've yet to find any recipe that can make ground turkey flavorful and make me want seconds. This was really yummy and I'll make again.

My first time making any stroganoff! I made some slight adjustments and it turned out great! I used ground chicken (that is what I had), cream of broccoli soup (I don't like mushrooms) and I added in some fresh broccoli. I had drained the ground chicken after browning it and I had to add more water later, so next time I'll skip doing that.

Three stars as written; it was a little bland. Five stars with the changes I made. I changed it to substitute chicken broth for the water. I also substituted one onion sautéed in butter and cooked with the ground turkey. I added two teaspoons of minced garlic. I added 4 oz of cream cheese after everything else was added and mixed together and simmered until the cream cheese was melted. I gave it five stars because it is tasty this way AND because it was quick and easy.

I'm sorry, normally I wouldn't even bother but this really is terrible. I came across this recipe because I  was in a pinch needing to get dinner on the table with no notice and prep. These are all ingredients I always have so I threw it together. It was literally inedible and it wasn't me, I made it as directed except subbing chicken broth for water because I never add plain water to a recipe. To make it edible, I ended up adding a second bullion cube, 1/2 cream cheese and 2 cloves crushed garlic.

This is a great recipe and perfect for those nights when you don't feel like cooking.  I made it exactly as it was originally written, and my only complaint is that it needs to be a little more saucy which is very easily remedied.  Other than that, it is a delicious, easy, and fast meal to whip up.

The hubby and 3 yo liked this. I definitely had to kick up the seasonings because this recipe as is is quite bland. With some cayenne, Italian seasoning, white wine & Worcestershire this was an easy, fast, and yummy dish.

Delicious! Of course, made my own little tweaks and it turned out incredible! My husband was making "mmm" sounds and doing his yummy dance! haha.. Used about a tablespoon of minced garlic and a small onion when cooking the ground turkey. Also, used a good amount of pepper, paprika and garlic salt in the mix throughout, making sure to season each step as it cooked. WIll definitely be making it again!

I thought this was a perfect quick tasty supper. Made wheat noodles, chopped one small onion fine, cooked that with a little oil and two cloves of garlic, minced. After about 5 minutes, I added the ground turkey, cooked thoroughly, added the bullion cube, soup and water. Super excellent in my opinion. Left out the paprika and salt, but didn't miss it due to salt in bullion. Served with steamed broccoli. Husband had multiple helpings which = GOOD! Thanks for the recipe!

I was originally looking for a recipe using ground chicken and came across this. So instead of using the ground turkey, I used what I was intending to use: ground chicken. I also used whole wheat penne pasta (thats all I had on hand). I think if I thought of how watery chicken is I would have cut some the liquid ingredience in half but all in all this meal was pretty good and VERY easy! I followed the reviews on adding sour cream and I also didnt have a bouillon I used 3/4 can of chicken stock, and added fresh chopped garlic as well as some itailin seasonings. I will definitely make this again with another meat choice and if I use ground chicken then Ill cut the liquid in half it was too watery for me with the chicken.

This was okay. I did use onion powder and added all the seasonings into the meat while I cooked it.  I think the fresh onion would have made a difference. Also, the paprika was too much, I'd reduce it next time.

A good quick and easy to fix recipe! A nice healthier alternative to ground beef. I had mine over brown rice, though the rest of the family preferred the egg noodles. Will make again and often I'm sure!

I have made this recipe many times already for all the tough critics in the family (husband, parents, in-laws, myself) and everyone loves it.  It is super easy and always a hit.  

I do tweak it by adding real mushrooms.

after skimming over the reviews, it didnt seem possible to over season this, but after going a little crazy with every mention seasoning, mine was just a little too salty. But not the creators fault..just got a lil carried away with oregano and chicken bouillion. I still ate it though!

So I read the other reviews, and added garlic, onions, a small can of sliced mushrooms and chicken boullion powder to the ground turkey as well, but not having sour cream I used cream of tarter for the sour taste I associate with stroganoff.  It turned out really well!  I dissolved it in about a cup of milk with arrowroot and cornstarch for thickening, and stirred that mixture in with the cream of mushroom soup. I also didn't bother draining the turkey since it was lean, and added thyme cumin and white pepper to the turkey while it was browning.  Really easy and yes so much more realistic than hamburger helper!! yum! (5 stars with my add ins)  ;>

AMAZING!!! I love to cook and of course I changed a few things up, including, adding mushrooms, sweet onion, can of campbells mushroom garlic and a can of cream of chicken and mushrooms. I also didnt have any sour cream though it doesnt call for it, mixed flour and milk for that extra creamy taste!! I seasoned the meat while it was cooking of course to ensure it held in the flavor. Very good, warm and fuzzy meal!!

I needed to make adjustments with what was available. I seasoned with garlic, smoked paprika, shallots, parsley, scallions, rosemary and salt and pepper.  Additions to the meat were corn, peas and shredded carrot. Added a small amount of golden rum.  Omitted water.  Used cream, sour cream and cheddar cheese.

I'm sorry, but I thought this was extremely bland and a total waste of ingredients!  I tried to "doctor" it up, but it just got worse!

I made this the first time and it was delicious. However, the second time I made it, I changed a couple of things.
I used onion and garlic powder to my taste, no paprika, a can of cream of chicken and mushroom, no bouillon, and I didn't have egg noodles, so I just used bowtie noodles. Either way, it was really good and the guests for both meals loved it!

This was a fine meal - and my family all got seconds - but all rated it '3' and no more.  I added more onion, the garlic, the fresh mushrooms, and used milk instead of water, and it was still just a simple, plain, easy, tasty dish.  Nice but nothing terribly exciting.

Very good and so easy. I used beef bouillon instead of chicken, 1/2 a medium yellow onion chopped, 2 tbsp minced fresh garlic, 3 tbsp worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 cup chopped fresh mushrooms. My husband doesn't usually like ground turkey, but he really liked this. I think I might add 3/4 cup light sour cream next time. Will let you know!

This stuff tastes fantastic!!  My only complaint is that it didn't have enough cream to offset the meat.  I halved the recipe, and it still made enough for 3 meals (one person household).  The leftovers are also good.  Were I to make this again, I'd probably substitute milk for the water, and increase the amount of mushroom soup by half.  Maybe also add in some sour cream to round it out.

I used some of the tips provided by other reveiwers, but still thought this meal was bland. I added shallots, garlic, thyme and salt. My husband liked it, after he nearly emptied the pepper shaker on it. I might use this as a base recipe in the future, but it's just as likely I'll find another stroganoff recipe to work from.

I have been using this recipe for about 3 yrs now and it started off as my "learning" base for making stroganoff since my b/f loves it and I had never made it.  I've since learned what I like and don't like and how to make it my own, but this is definitely a great stroganoff recipe in a pinch!  To make it a little more "special" consider using cubed steak, carmelized onions, sauted mushrooms, and some sour cream ... I use all of these and just add to the existing main ingredients in this recipe, it's become one of our favorite dishes!

Everyone loved it!! I added milk instead of water and took the advice of others and added sour cream and a little of red crushed pepper flakes. And I mixed in peas so the kids would eat there vegi's and they have no choice when mixed into the meal. We all ended up having seconds!! This is def a keeper!!!

This was fast and easy. I used green peppers, onions, lawry's seasoning salt, garlic,pepper, and paprika. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken which added more flavor. I will keep this recipe on hand.

This was a great base recipe! I gave it four stars because like most reviewers suggested, I had to add some things. This is a quick and easy meal for weeknights. In a skillet I cooked 1/2 a small white onion and 2 cloves of garlic in a couple of tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil (I enjoy the flavor better than vegetable oil). Once soft, I added the ground turkey (I buy the leanest kind, so there isn't much to drain). Once the turkey was cooked all the way, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, some chicken broth, black pepper, a tiny bit of salt, parsley, rosemary, and thyme. I didn't have any paprika.

This was okay. It reminded me of hamburger helper but with turkey. My family ate it without complaints but I don't think it was their favorite thing. It was good but I don't think I would make it again.

This recipe was a little bland to begin with. I added an additional can of cream of mushroom soup and used a can of chicken broth instead of the bouillon cube and water. After that, I added a good bit of galic salt and pepper. After those changes, my family really enjoyed the recipe.

Quick, easy and pleases the entire family.  I use the Barilla rotini noodles (with the Omega-3).  Adding in garlic and the occasional shake of cayenne just to mix it up.

Love love love this! These are my notes I made to myself in my recipe box for this dish:

*Since I don't used condensed COM soup, I skip the water. *May want to add a smidge of milk for more sauce. *So far I have only used 1/2 TBS of paprika. Can use more, but a full TBS is not necessary. ** The following is a must for this dish: *Add about 1/3 onion to turkey when cooking in skillet (step number 2). *Add Minced Garlic in step #2. *Add garlic powder in step #2. *Add Thyme in step #2 *Add about 1/2c. of sour cream in step #3

Very easy! I altered it by adding some sour cream, onion, garlic, sage, and thyme based off the suggestions in other reviews. With those additions I think this would count as a 5 star recipe.

Very good! The first time I made this the only change I made was to add 1/2 cup sour cream and it was delicious. This time I added a few splashes of worcerstershire and fresh garlic, along with the sour cream. Great base recipe. Thanks!

I cooked before I read the reviews ( silly me )and it was fast but needed some zip so like many I spiced it up with minced garlic and some dijon mustard but skipped the sour cream for health reasons and it turned out way better hen I expected.

Not bad.  I added alot of seasoning to this recipe, though.  Dry mustard, tarragon and garlic.   This is a good pantry-staple recipe for a night when you can't run to the grocery.

It was pretty good easy meal. i had to make some changes due to what I had on hand. I used lean ground beef and omitted the bouilion. I also added corn to kind of stretch the meal. I would definately try it again with the proper ingredients.

My hubby & I really liked this recipe. The only thing I changed was I used about 1 tsp onion powder because I don't like sauteed onions, and I added a couple dashes garlic powder as well. It's incredibly easy & quick, and very filling. Thanks for sharing.

This wasn't "amazing" but good as a quick meal after work with things I already had on hand.  When I browned the turkey I also sprinkled garlic salt on to give a hint of flavor.  I used cream of celery because my husband hates mushroom, threw in some garlic pepper, and also added about 2 cups of frozen peas and 3/4c of sour cream when mixing everything together because to me its not stroganoff without sour cream!

I made this receipe and it was great.  I made one substitution - I substitued the Spagetti Squash for the pasta, to make it a little healthier.  Cook the spagetti squash the normal way and serve as you would the pasta....so good!

I thought this was very tasty.  I used half a large onion and an 8oz package of mushrooms, which I sliced.  I added these with the ground turkey and sauteed until tender.  I also added 1/3 cup of sour cream and eliminated the water.  I cooked it for a good ten minutes after it was totally assembled to cook off some of the water.  All in all, a good recipe, though.

With the additions I made, I'd give this recipe 4 stars. It's super easy-it took less than 15 minutes total. I thought the sauce really required sour cream for a fuller flavor. I also added half an onion, mushrooms, garlic salt and some fresh parsley. I used linguine instead of egg noodles because that's all I had on hand. I also added a bouillon cube to the pasta for a little added flavor.

I would give this a 5 just for being so cheap to make. That's great for someone on a budget like my family. I liked it & so did my hubby kinda, but the kids hated it and threw it in the trash. I liked it, i added a whole onion, 2 garlic cloves, and the sour cream like the other users and added a little more soup, and some poultry seasoning, garlic powder. I may make again someday~

This is definately a quick and easy recipe, a nice change from turkey burgers. I don't think it took more than about 20 minutes to make in total. I made it exactly as the recipe states. It's a bit salty on its own, but the blandness of the noodles cuts that down nicely, making overall a decent dish. I'd rate it 3.5 if I could.

It needed a little more "something else" for my taste.... I did not have the buillion, so I used chicken broth instead (and omitted the water), I added about 2 ounces of lowfat cream cheese, which seemed to do the trick! maybe next time I'll add some garlic for some more flavor. But everyone in the family gobbled it up!

Wow! This was amazing! I was just finishing up my five day fast and thought I'd go for another day. One wiff of this and that was the end of that! I just could'nt resist and I was baking the whole week! I've never had ground turkey before. I added an extra can of mushrooms (we like it saucy). I put extra onions (half) and I forgot to put the salt and I'm glad I did because I think there's enough in the mushroom soup. This is fast and easy and fantastic! A keeper.

I read some of the other reviews and made some of the suggested adjustments.  I used a whole onion. and used Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom, but added 3 cans of button mushrooms while cooking the onions.  I also added some minced garlic, and used whole milk instead of water.  I stirred in about 1/2 cup sour cream towards the end.  VERY TASTY!  I will make this again, and continue to experiment.

This was excellent and very easy. A couple of changes I made: 
Add a whole chopped onion instead of just one Tablespoon. Add a couple cloves of minced garlic. And substitute milk for the water. Mmmmm!

Very easy to make. I took the advice of others and added some extras for more flavor(more chopped onion, 2 cloves of minced garlic and fresh ground black pepper in with the turkey. Used 1/2 cup of milk instead of water, and a couple dollops of fat free sour cream). Still something missing.
Would not make it again.

I gave it four stars because (personally) I thought it a little plain for my taste.  My husband, however, loved it!  The recipe was very easy to make, and a good, hearty, hot meal.  Cleanup was easy as well.  I had to use farfaille (bow tie) pasta because we didn't have any egg noodles.  I will be making this again.

This was quick and easy. Although I enjoyed it, my husband did not. The turkey needs to be pepped up a bit(not enough flavor)and the dish itself needs to be saucier to cover the noodles. I will try this again and add some sour cream(?)to expand the sauce. As for the turkey seasonings, well, that is an individual thing. Everyone has their own tastes. It's worth a try.

Very easy but a bit bland for my tastes.  I seasoned the turkey as I browned it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Next time I will add more seasoning to it.  But overall, very good!

This a fast and easy recipe, I added fresh portobello mushrooms, fresh garlic, fresh red onion, and instead of packaged noodles I made home made noodles, I’ve also made it the way it’s posted, both were delicious!

I doubled the recipe and used two teaspoons of Better than Bouillon to season the turkey and onion.  I added salt and paprika at the end but it still came out fairly bland; I also added baby bella mushrooms and about 3/4 cup of sour cream to the mixture, as I was having trouble with it being excessively watery from the turkey and soup.  I drained the water once but I think the next time after adding soup I might also add some flour to thicken the sauce.

I personal don’t like turkey but this recipe has become a household staple in this house! Kids don’t even realize they are eating turkey. I have made this on more then one occasion and I have added a cup of sour cream and two tablespoons of soy sauce! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I added mushrooms and sauteed garlic(jarred) onion with ground chicken I needed to use.  Used Campbell's Healthy Request Golden Mushroom soup and 2 tablespoons of light sour cream at the end. Yummy!!

Whoah, this was surprisingly good! I made the recipe mostly as it, but salted/peppered my ground turkey and added a little garlic powder and a pinch of red pepper. I served it over brown rice since that’s what I had. Definitely going in my easy, delicious weeknight meals recipe box!

I added mushrooms and peas as it is a way to get my hubby too eat veggies. I also added an additional can of mushroom soup. Pretty good meal for such simple ingredients.

My family really liked it. I added 3 cloves of garlic and sliced fresh mushrooms. I also increased the onion to a medium onion finely diced, and used a full cup of chicken broth instead of water. I’ll definitely make it again.

While the turkey was browning I added about 1/2 teaspoon of beef BetterThanBoullion into the meat and juices, stirring thoroughly. I also used BetterThanBoullion dissolved into the 1/2 cup of added water, the result being a LazyGals Stroganoff.

Yes I made some changes, I added garlic powder and 8 oz of sliced mushroom and simmered it down for 2 hours and thickened it up with Wonder and served over broccoli instead of noodles and it was totally awesome!!! Loved it and I will totally make it again, my husband loved it!!!

It was a cold night in March and a snow storm was raging outside. I decided that stroganoff would be an excellent meal to have. Since we don’t eat beef, this recipe was a perfect choice and boy, was it delicious! The only change I made was using chicken broth instead of bullion. It made a thick, rich gravy that we all loved!   I would definitely make this again. Yummo!!

I used dried minced onions instead of a real onion (in true lazy girl fashion) and I also added a dash of garlic powder. I did this as a meal prep lunch so I made enough for 4 servings and then stored it by serving amount in the fridge. Heats up well and definitely easy to make. Will make it again!

I omitted the oil because the turkey had enough fat for my liking. I also changed the 1/2 cup water for 1/2 cup low-fat sour cream (how can you have a proper stroganoff without sour cream?) and served it over rice (not a pasta fan). Simple, easy, and totally tasty!

Followed the recipe and just added 3/4 cup of frozen peas and 3/4 cup of French's Fried onions, and a little sprinkle of the onions on top for garnish.

Husband Loved it... Thank you.

Four stars as is, five stars when enhanced with a diced onion and  3-4 minced garlic cloves sautéed with the meat and a cup of peas and a cup of sour cream added at the end.  It could also use more color, maybe 1/4 cup of finely diced red bell pepper or pimentos, and maybe a few favorite herbs (for us rosemary and thyme).  We'll definitely make this again - it was delicious!!

The only changes I made were cooking the onions after browning the turkey and  sprinkling nutmeg on top at the end (just personal preferences). My husband and I both gobbled it down and agreed it was a "repeat".  Thanks for sharing!

Easy, quick and easy to add alittle here and there to work with flavors. Being on a low sodium and low cholesterol diet, I added onion and garlic to my taste without the salt. I also used low sodium chicken broth in place of the bullion.  Will definitely make again.

To make it less runny, I added 1/2 cup water with 2 heaping teaspoons of corn starch, whisked.  I stirred in the cornstarch mixture with the Stroganoff when it was finished cooking.  I let it thicken and It turned out great!

I have a couple of picky eaters in my household and this recipe has become a fave. Not only to I have to goad them to eat it, they come back for seconds and thirds... Amazing recipe that's so easy to make after working all day.

This recipe reminds me of a dish my grandmother made when I was a child. Its delicious. 
After making it a few times I altered the recipe slightly, I added 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 2 tbs cream cheese and ommited the paprika. 
My family loves this recipe and its quick and easy. Two thumbs way up ???

I gave it 4 starts but it could have easily been fine.  I read several reviews and used broth instead of water and chicken bullion.  I also added about 2/3 cups of sour cream.  My whole family ate it.  My kids won't touch anything that has onions in it and they loved it.  My picky daughter had seconds.  Great Recipe!

Came out great, just added 1/4 cup of chopped canned mushrooms, 1/4 cup all together green yellow and red chopped peppers. I swapped out bone broth as a replacement for the water, added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 tablespoon of dried parsley flakes Served it with peas on the side.  Was a hit in my house I will be making this again.

Today I prepared for you a Creamy Shiitake Mushroom Turkey Stroganoff and Tomato-Spinach Rotini.  I didn't have any Mushroom soup so I made some using  freeze dried shiitake and made a roux cream from scratch.  I used the water that the mushrooms seeped in, added an (extra ) chicken bouillon cube to it and mixed the mushroom-chicken brine into the roux and continued to add milk, garlic, salt and pepper.  I glazed the pan with butter and fresh chopped garlic and added 2/3 cup of onion (instead of a tablespoon) to a pound of turkey and browned it really well while the roux thickened.  Dont be afraid to brown the turkey well because once it goes into the roux it will absorb a lot. These methods injected flavor into the dish and given turkey burger is notorious for being dry and tasteless -- I impressed myself.  Yum-yum.

3 stars as written, but I made some changes that other suggested and it is now a favorite. First, I brown the turkey with 2 cloves garlic, then set it aside. I then cook about 8 oz fresh brown mushrooms sliced or quartered (done it both ways, up to preference) with 1/2 an onion diced thin, along with 2 more cloves of garlic until the mushrooms start to brown and the onion is soft. I then add the turkey back, add the soup, add 2 tbls of sour cream, a dash of milk or cream, dash of paprika, black pepper, and salt to taste (depending on the soup used, may not need to add any salt). My wife loves it, as does my son!

The first time I made this recipe it was a little bland, so I made a few additions. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and a tablespoon of Ms. Dash to the ground turkey. Once the mixture is brown I added an 8 oz. package of cream cheese and an 8 oz. container of sour cream. These changes made the dish creamy and delicious!

Made this for my son's lunch.  I wanted to try something different and simple.  It was quick.  I added red pepper, garlic powder, and a little salt to the ground turkey.  Drained it and added only a half can of water.  Season my noodles with butter and garlic and parsley salt mix.   It taste great!  Not bland at all.

I love this recipe! It's quick, easy, and tasty. I added garlic and an extra can of cream of mushroom soup- roasted garlic flavor. It's a great afterwork recipe when you're hungry and tired.

This is a great recipe. I changed the minced onion for half a medium onion diced. I also add 1/2 cup of sour cream right before the paprika. It tastes great! My husband can't tell the difference between this and beef stroganoff and this costs less to make. :-) I make this about 2 times a month. Leftovers freeze well.

Awesome, but instead of cream of mushroom soup I used golden mushroom soup (which some stores don't carry) and added a dash of worchestershire sauce and sour cream to make it closer to traditional stroganoff.  I personally prefer it over rice, but it would be fine over egg noodles as well.

Made this recipe with the changes that other people made.  Browned the turkey with some garlic and herb mix and removed.  Then cooked some fresh onion ands fresh garlic in olive oil.  Added turkey back to pan and added a can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of peas, chicken broth, black pepper, crushed red pepper, seasoned salt, Rosemary, garlic powder and paprika.    I also had a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream.  Simmered for a few minutes then stirred in cooked egg noodles.  Let the whole thing simmer for a while adding more chicken broth as it thickened a bit.  Right before I served I added some more paprika and mor sour cream.  Was very good and loved the difference the ground turkey made versus ground beef.  I was looking for a recipe to use up egg noodles and this hit the spot.  Husband loved it and it was definitely 4 stars with the changes I made.  The orginal recipe is a good start but way to bland for our tastes!

My changes were: chicken broth instead of water, added peas, garlic and extra salt.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream.

Tasted good but my daughter (7)  would not eat it.

This was really good. My 5 and 7 year old loved it as well. I used canola oil and also added 3 gloves of garlic. After browning the turkey I added a package of dry onion soup mix. Also used milk instead of water. I wanted to add some sour cream but realized I was out. I will make this again!

Husband approved.  I sautéed onion and garlic in extra virgin olive oil in a separate skillet from the ground turkey then combined them. Used chicken broth instead of water.  Added a little cayenne pepper, a couple tablespoons of non-fat plain greek yogurt, and about a 1/2 cup of frozen lima beans in the mixture.  I will definitely make this one again!

I was skeptical even after reading the reviews because ground turkey does not usually pick up flavoring from anything and tends to be so dry. Boy was I wrong! This was so flavorful.  My husband even loved it and wanted seconds! I did change it a bit after reading other reviews. I added sliced mushrooms, cooked the onion, garlic and mushrooms half way then added the ground turkey. I also added about a cup of low sodium chicken broth and just a couple tablespoons of light sour cream. Served it over egg noodles. Quick and easy and great flavor! Thanks so much for sharing hotmama!

Like some other folks advised, I used several cloves of garlic, a whole onion and even threw in some cilantro that I had. Turned out very good.

I added garlic along with the onion and meat. I also added a tablespoon of flour after all the ingredients were together to thicken the sauce-but it did not necessarily need it. Followed all other directions exactly and it was fantastic! My husband thought there was cheese in it because it tasted so creamy and delicious.

Really good!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't add the 1/2 cup of water.  I was happy with the consistency so didn't add it.  The dish was WAY YUMMY!  Will make again...soon.

This was really good.  I did like some of the other reviewers and added some garlic while I was browning the meat.  I also added some garlic powder and some onion powder for some extra taste.  Next time, I will also add an extra bullion cube.  My son said it was one of his favorites!!  This woulld also be good served over rice and served with sweet peas.  The only reason I am giving this 4 starts is because I had to add so many ingredients to give it the flavor I like.  Will be making again =)

Good recipe...with a few modifications...I followed some others suggestions and after browning the turkey, i removed it from the pan and browned the onion and garlic alone (smells amazing!!).  I added it all together with soup, etc.  I also added a 1" portion of velvetta and also a pound of fresh spinach during the last minutes.

Good recipe, very much like a homemade hamburger helper.  Very easy so it is great for a quick weekday meal.  I used ground chicken which came out very tender.  I also added minced garlic while cooking it and use fresh chopped onions instead of dried.  I added a dollop of sour cream to the finished product along with a few chopped green onions to pretty it up.  Will make again.

I made a few changes to the recipe to spread it out a bit more.  I added a green pepper, mushrooms, and some garlic in with the onions to saute. For the sauce I put 1 can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken and about 1 1/2 cups chicken broth to thin it out.  This turned out great.  The stretched the meal a little further and gave it some veggies too!

I really liked this, but as others stated, it is bland.  Since chili powder is paprika and several spices, I used it instead of just paprika and that really kicked it  up a bit.

I used some suggestions and changed it a bit using 1 can cream of chx soup ( made it a little too oily), added 1 cup reduced fats sour cream, added bread crumb crumble topper ( crumbs and butter sauted) to give it some texture. Despite the oil, pretty darn good & light!

I added a couple cloves minced garlic and used fresh chopped onion. We preferred it served over rice too.  Fast, easy and kid friendly. I might stir in some frozen peas next time too.

surprisingly good.  quick & easy. My kids ate 3rds - UNHEARD OF. I made some of the recommended improvements - added garlic & sour cream, used broth since I don't have bouillon, didn't need salt, & added frozen cut green beans to noodle water during last 3 minutes to get some veggies into my kids.

This was pretty darn good!  I thought it was a little bland but I also did not add salt, so that would probably take it up to 5 stars (except for the added sodium!).

I added sour cream and cream of chicken soup instead because I dont like mushrooms.  I also used 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tbls of paprika. Very good and an easy dinner to make for the family after work.

This was easy and very good. I thought it needed more seasoning so I added 2 beef bullion cubes instead of one chicken. Instead of sour cream I used nonfat yogurt and it was yummy and healthy.

Very Tasty!  I love using ground turkey rather than hamburger and with the flavor it tastes just fine using the turkey.  The only thing I added was a package of sauteed fresh mushrooms.

I added mushrooms and some extra spices to this recipe, but something was still missing from the taste. It was ok, but I don't know if I will make this again.

Good base recipe you can alter.  I used wheat pasta, 1/2 an onion, milk in place of the water & added some garlic seasoning so I could have a quick meal tonight.

This was pretty good based on a number of changes suggested by others.  I used about half an onion and4  cloves of garlic to brown the turkey with.  I used chicken  broth instead of water.  I added peas and sliced mushrooms and about half a cup of sour cream to thicken it.  It was pretty tasty and easy to make.

Awesome!  Loved this meal.  After reading the different reviews, I cooked my turkey with onion salt and garlic powder.  Then I added a half container of sour cream and a can of drained peas and mushrooms.  My husband loved it!  This meal is being added to the rotation!

Pretty good... though not spectacular.  I made it because it was the only recipe for ground turkey that I had all of the ingredients for.  It was very quick and easy to make and my family liked it. I put some spinach in mine for a little more nutrition and flavor.  I think a  tablespoon of paprika was a little was  too much and it was kind of overpowering.  I will add less the next time.  Overall this was good and I will probably make it again.

Easy to make.  Tasted great.  Used half & half instead of water.  Added garlic and more onion, a can of mushrooms and a can of baby peas.  My husband added tabasco to his plate and I added Maggi liquid seasoning to my plate.  We both like it and I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I did not care for this recipe as-is at all.  Even implementing some of the modifications recommended by other reviewers I would give it a three at best. It beats Hamburger Helper, but that's about it.

I have made this several times. It is very good as is, but lacks some spice. I usually add more garlic, and some  paprika, pepper, red pepper to taste. I play with the spices depending on my mood, but without them it is too bland.

I ended up mixing this all together before work.[for when I got home] Put in the oven 350 for an hr. I diced up a stalk of celery with the onion, when I browned the turkey. I used one packet of powdered mushroom gravy mix with the cream of mushroom soup, and 1c. of milk instead of 1\2c. of water, and just threw some peas in for color, and a can of drained mushrooms. It was good.

Overall happy with this recipe.  Very easy to make, especially for those of us just starting our cooking adventures.  I made a few changes: sauteed onions and mushrooms, added the turkey and some mesquite chicken seasoning, browned and drained.  I added chicken bouillon, the cream of mushroom soup, half and half, parmesan cheese and parsley flakes for color.  It was a hit, will make again

Fixed this for dinner tonight.  My husband recently was diagnosed with some health problems so I've been changing the way I cook, including cutting way way down on ground beef, even if it's ground steak.  He loved this recipe.  Asked me what was in it, and when he found out it had ground turkey instead of ground beef, he was really surprised, but said it was great anyway.  I did read some of the reviews and added a little sour cream.  I'm not a big fan of paprika so I didn't put as much as the recipe called for, and I used broth instead of water.  I also added some garlic salt and more pepper.

So delicious!!!!!  I also did add some sour cream, about 3/4 cup towards the end, and I added sliced fresh mushrooms while browning the turkey meat.  YUMMY!  A must if you love mushrooms!!  Shockingly enough my very picky husband and daughter gobbled it up, even the leftovers which never happens in our house!!

It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.  It tasted a little odd, I am not sure why.  I added the garlic, extra onion, and chicken broth like the others advised, but we still didn't care much for it.  We won't be making it again.

I had no idea how to prepare stroganoff as I was used to preparing from the boxed meal. I was really happy to run across this recipe. After a few tweeks from the other posters it came out great! My b/f really liked it. Thanks for the idea.

Very good, quick and easy. I had ground turkey and at 5pm I wasn't sure what to make for dinner. I found this recipe and loved that I had everything in my pantry that I needed to make it. I prepared it almost exactly as described except I added peas for color and when it came time to add the paprika I used Emeril's Original Essence to give it kick it up a bit. My very picky husband went back for seconds so I know this recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

This was great. I first cooked a large onion and lots of chopped garlic then added the Turkey, yum! I think that made it a 5 to me. My kids (4 & 5) and husband loved it. I served it over egg noodles!

Wonderful recipe.  I use 2 tablespoons on freshly diced onion in place of minced onion.  One time when I made this, I substituted 4 oz. of sour cream and a few splashes of chicken broth.  I used just a tad of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce to my desired consistancy.  The family loves it!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 1 whole onion diced, minced garlic, sliced baby portabello mushrooms, and a bag of frozen peas to the ground turkey mixture while cooking. I also made 12 oz. of Whole Wheat Egg Noodles, changed out the full fat cream of mushroom to fat free, added a can of fat free cream of chicken and about 4 Tablespoons of low fat sour cream. I also used chicken broth in the place of the water. My boyfriend loved this and it made 6 servings. Enough for left overs to take to work:-)

I didn't use the bouillon as my husband had a heart attack at 49- gotta watch sodium these days.  Used less sodium chicken broth instead and would put more garlic, onion, etc...into it.  I am making it again tonight for supper.  I also sub the Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup for the regular and add a rinsed and chopped can of sliced shrooms.

This was pretty good, used the suggestions of others and added garlic powder, fresh mushrooms, chicken broth instead of water, sherry, frozen peas and a little gravy master for seasoning and to give it a more appetizing color. :)

I'm giving this 3 stars based on the original recipe.  After tasting it, I had to doctor the recipe to get my husband to eat it.   I also added onions, garlic, chicken broth and sour cream to the mixture.  At the end, I still wasnt satisfied so I threw in a handful of fresh bacon bits.  That did the trick!  After all the extras, I would give this  a 4 star.  Its still not a favorite.

Good recipe after making some changes. This is a great lower calorie and lower fat recipe for stroganoff. I used chix broth instead of the water and added fresh minced garlic. It is an absolute MUST to add light sour cream about 5 minutes before serving. It makes a HUGE difference. My hubby loved it and I'm sure I'll be making it again

This was so bland.  I tried it when it was done and ended up needing to add some 6 Pepper Blend and garlic powder to make it something I thought my family would eat.  We still thought it wasn't that great.

with a few modifications, this as a great meal.  I used broth instead of water and parsley flakes. I minced a small onion instead of using onion flakes. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken, and added one can of drained, sliced mushrooms.  I will use this again. It's a wonderful stand-by for those unexpected rainy days!!

Very good but missing something. Can't put my finger on it. I skipped the oil and used cooking spray instead. I didn't use the bouillon or any salt. Overall though I loved it, very filling.

This recipe was quite tasty, and a little fancier with a couple modifications. I used the ground turkey, some onions, an egg and some spices to make meatballs, then rolled them in flour and fryed them. To the sauce I added garlic powder, fresh parsley, chicken brother and heavy whipping cream (instead of water). A comforting food accompanied by egg noodles that have some butter, milk and salt added to them.

Fast and good -- a great weeknight supper.    I took the advice of other reviewers and added minced garlic to the turkey and onions, and then a pinch of sage to the bubbling sauce.  I tossed the noodles (about 8 oz) into the meat and gravy and stirred it all up.  Very good!

This was really, really, good. My husband and children thought it was good. I did not have noodles on hand, so I served it over brown rice instead. I also used low sodium cream soup just to cut some of the salt out of our diet. I will make it again!

This recipe was really quick and good.  I did make some changes, I used low fat cream soup, I actually forgot the chicken base, but added about 2T light sour cream, and 2t dijon mustard.  It turned out really good...and super fast.  My daughter who is a year and half old ate it up!

I made it exactly as is except without the bouillon - simply because I forgot it. My two boys - 8&9 yrs old - who are so picky, gobbled it up! They loved it and had no idea what they ate. DELICIOUS and SO SIMPLE. I did add some adobo at the end and a nice amount of salt.

I make this all the time. I typically use more onions and add sliced mushrooms and some lite sour cream. It always turns out great!

The stroganoff was good, except it needed a little more cream of mushroom soup than the recipie called for. I guess it just depends on how you like the texture of your food.

This was great! My husband loves Stroganoff, but I'm not big on red meat, so this was a great recipe for both of us!

I love this recipe! However, like a couple other people, I thought it was a little bland the first time I made it. I added an extra boullion cube, used 1/4 cup of onion instead of a tablespoon, and an extra tablespoon of paprika... try it...

I found this recipe a little lackluster. I'm a big stroganoff fan (though usually hamburger) but the sauce just had such an odd flavor, I really couldn't eat much of it. Could be operator error :-)

It wasn't terrible, but a bit too bland for my family's taste. I made it exactly as the recipe called, only I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. 

Perhaps others have advice on spicing up the flava!

I don't have the time to prepare a lot of fancy meals, but this was yummy and was ready quickly. For that it gets top ratings. 
I added more onion and replaced milk for water, as suggested, I left out the cube-o-salt, BUT I added lots of mushrooms and a can of cream of chicken soup.  YUMMY for a non-fancy meal!

I made this but I changed a couple things.  Instead of using ground turkey I used the shredded chicken out of the can.  I also added mushrooms and used milk instead of water.  It turned out great but was too salty.

In fear of the dish being too salty, I had purchased low or no salt ingredients. I substitued the water for chicken stock and omitted the chicken bullion. I did find it a bit bland and wound up adding salt and the meal did remind me of 'hamburger helper'. But quick and easy for a weeknight.

This recipe is quick and easy, yet the end result was a bit too much like "Hamburger Helper" to me. I added extra onion and seasoning (garlic and paprika) to this and also about a cup of sour cream. It would have been too dry otherwise if I hadn't have. I think that next time I make this, I will doctor it up a bit with some mushrooms, and peas.

I thought this was pretty tasty.  I didn't have all the ingredients but I did the best I could and with the right seasonings this was quick and easy meal that I'll make again.  Plus it was cheap enough for a poor student like me!  Hooray for an inexpensive warm meal!

This was not so good.  The sauce was not thick enough, with a little love, we made it taste okay.  It just does not have a ton of flavor.

This was very easy and quick to make (a necessity for me).  My husband and 13 month old really liked it.  I added frozen peas for a veggie and didn't add any paprika as my spices are packed up to move.  Next time I'd probably add a little less water so it would be thicker.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was easy to make, but not thrilling to eat.  I had to add a lot of extra spices and it still tasted like, as many others have already said, like hamburger helper.  The good part about this instead of hamburger helper is that is didn't taste as salty.

This recipe bears a faint similarity to Hamburger Helper, only with less flavor. It was very easy and very fast, but the bland, processed flavor is not something I care to experience again. Perhaps more fresh vegetables and sour cream would make it more palatable.

My boyfriend loved this quick and easy dish. I added some extra spices to the turkey because the other comments said it needed more taste, and next time I will make more sauce.

Very simple to make.  Decent flavor but nothing to write home about.  Great for a quick dinner with the family.  Reminds me of hamburger helper.
