The "snowballs" are delicious! Very easy to package and make! I added white chocolate chips and coconut and put them in snowflake covered bags calling them "snowballs in a bag"...they were a big hit to all who recieved them and then again when they were baked and eaten!

Did this for a church bake & craft sale.  Decorated the jar, put it on a tray and surrounded it with baked cookies.  The cookies were sort of dry and bland with all of the shortening, so for the second batch I used 1/2 cup of butter, 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup margarine.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of salt.  Tips:  1) The powered sugar sticks better if you let cookies cool slightly then roll; let them completely cool and roll again.  Can also add sugar sprinkles to the powered sugar for some color.  2) Mix did not completely fill the quart jar, so I put some powered sugar with colored sprinkles in a baggie, tied it with a ribbon and set it on top of mix.

I couldn't stand the thought of using all that shortening(yuck)so I used butter and it was much like my shortbread recipe. They do need to be rolled in sugar while slightly warm, sugar sticks better. overall very good.

Very good - I always make these and teh saltine toffee cookies found on this site. They are awsome, one tip, though, when you roll the cookies, first sprinle in water, then roll - much more sugar and better taste.Delish!

I made four gift jars with this recipe and I made a batch for my house, too. They're good cookies and they're especially appropriate for this time of year. I tried adding coconut and white chocolate chips. I liked the chips but the coconut didn't add much to the cookie. I put just a little less than a cup of pecans in the jars and topped them with white chips. I used quart-sized jars for this and can't wait to send snowballs in a jar to my friends who live in warmer climates.

Note: Once mixed, the ingredients form a crumble rather than a dough and I made the balls bigger than 1" and got about 2 dozen cookies.

Wow!  These cookies are absolutely delicious, I've only had two so far but they are great!  Right up there in my top 3 cookie recipes, and that's saying a lot.  I really like cookies that have a rather shortbread like texture like these and the flavor is perfect.  I used half butter and half shortening because that's what I had, and I decided to make 2 types of snowballs by splitting the dough in half.  In one half, I put the teaspoon of vanilla and half a cup chocolate chips (we don't like nuts).  In the other, I put a teaspoon of peppermint extract and half a cup of white chips.  I got exactly 24 cookies and rolled them in powdered sugar while still warm.  Just great, thanks for the recipe!

I decided to follow one rater's suggestion of snowballs in a bag and thought it would be good to make and try them before giving away the jar version.  They taste great - a lot like shortbread but much easier to make.  My dough was crumbly but they formed into balls easily.

I just rolled these in balls and flattened with a fork.  I sprinkled with sugar and baked at 375 for 8 to 10 minutes.  Pretty good!

I was scared at first that these would be hard to make, but it is a Very easy recipe. I have made several batches and like to sometimes substitute ground up hershey bar in place of the nuts for my niece who doesn't like nuts.

Delicious with or without nuts or raisins.  I gave this to my 10 year old niece.  She made them by herself and they were awsome.  Thank you for the wonderful Christmas idea.

I've made several batches of these cookies, and have given a dozen at a time along with an additional batch of mix to follow the "Snowballs in a Bag" suggestion given below.  People love them!  Thanks for the great idea.

If you like mexican wedding cookies you will Love these, the snowball recipe has a little less sugar and uses shortening in it but otherwise they taste very similar.  I like them and they are a inexpensive gift for winter holidays & Winter birthdays.

I didn't give jars as gifts, but I did make the recipe and these are absolutely delicious.  A bit time consuming to roll all the little balls, but worth the effort!
