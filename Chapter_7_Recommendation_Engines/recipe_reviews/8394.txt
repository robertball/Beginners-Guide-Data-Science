I wanted to make muffins, but had no eggs in the house. this recipe was a great starting point.

substituted:
- 1/2 c of the flour for 1/2 c rolled oats.
- 1 c of the sour cream for 1/2 c plain yogurt and 1/2 c milk.

omitted:
- salt 
- half the sugar

added:
- 1/2 c bran
- 1/2 tsp baking powder (i knew these would be heavy)
- 1 tbsp cooking oil
- 1 c rasins
- 1 c frozen mized berries

these muffins turned our SUPER, and i will definitely make them again. you can not tell the difference without the eggs.

This recipe was awesome after I tweeked it a little.
I added 1- 15ounce container of sugar free frozen strawberries, thawed, with the juice. I used 6 packets of sugar substitute in place of the sugar and used fat free sour cream. I also used a full teaspoon of baking soda. My boys love them and they're a great healthy sugar free snack!

These muffins were very tasty.  My 10 month old daughter is allergic to eggs, and this was a perfect "eggless" treat for her.  I added a few ingredients though because the mix seemed so dry without them.  
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon Olive Oil
This was a good recipe!

My husband's allergic to eggs, and this recipe has become the foundation of weekly muffin sessions!  I add lots of other stuff - cinnamon and whatever fruit I've at hand that would be good in a muffin, but most importantly a heaping spoonful of runny honey mixed in with the sour cream. I've made these muffins for lots of people, and they've all been amazed that they're so moist and tasty without any eggs - plus they stay good for a day or two after baking (that's thanks to the honey).   I think I've started an egg-free muffin trend in my part of the country!

Like the other reviewers, I tweaked the recipe, and it was great. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used white flour plus I added rolled oats, 2 peeled, cored, and diced apples, 1/4 cup fresh honey, and 1/8 cup canola oil, as well as a little extra cinnamon and some dried cranberries. Thanks to the person who provided this recipe for giving me the inspiration to try an eggless muffin for the first time. You really couldn't tell it was eggless! I shared with friends and co-workers, and everyone loved it.

i ended up having to make these completely different as not only was i out of eggs, but out of sour cream as well. so here is my totally crazy recipe.  2 cups whole wheat flour 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp baking soda 2 tsp baking powder 1 tbsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp nutmeg 1 cup white sugar 1 1/2 cup applesauce 1/2 cup plain yogurt 1 mashed banana 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tsp honey 1/4 cup milk  i whisked together all dry ingredients. in a separate bowl, i blended all the wet ingredients. then i stirred the dry into the wet.  stirred in: 1/4 cup raisins 1/4 cup chopped walnuts  topped with: toasted wheat germ rolled oats.  baked on 350 for 30 min.  so i know its a totally different recipe, but its still eggless muffins and they came out incredible. so i figured i'd share!

I was impressed by these muffins. I didn't have sour cream so I used soy milk instead, and required just a little over one cup to make the batter the correct muffin texture. Very good taste and satisfying. Quick and easy.

We use this recipe as a base for many kinds of muffins - banana, carrot, blueberry, applesause, etc.  One of the children in my daycare is allergic to eggs and we love to bake muffins for snack time, so this has become a favourite of ours.  I love that it is so healthy as well.

Is this recipe an April Fool's joke or something? These are bad! They are dense and taste awful.

This did not turn out for me at all!!  I think that it needed more sour cream maybe.  I gave the muffins to my dog as dog treats!

Not Horrible but not great.  Played with the recipe a couple of different times and could never perfect it.  Definitely a good base recipe for someone who has an egg allergy to play with.

These didn't turn out for me, I will try and experiment with the recipe but all in all a bad experience following the recipe as is. They turned out dry and tasteless.

Well, I didn't quite follow the recipe. I needed to get rid of a cup and a half of sour cream before it went bad, so I used the whole thing. I also didn't have a muffin pan, so I used a round cake pan. I also added a couple tablespoons of water so all the (white, all-purpose) flour would fix in. Then I baked at 400 F for 30 minutes, cut the results into eighths, and baked again for 2 minutes. They ended up tasting kinda like dry, biscuity pancakes. Accordingly, they will be eaten with maple syrup and a little butter. Awesome.

This very basic recipe is the foundation for a new favourite muffin loaf that my family loves.  Like many I altered this to suit our tastes:  1/4 C. brown sugar instead of 3 Tbsp. white, 60 mL water, 3 Tbsp. margarine; turning it into a loaf was more convenient for me as the batter became a moist ball of dough; I also added about a 1/4 C. of walnut pieces and some cinnamon sugar sprinkled between layers of the dough and on top.  "Yummy"  And, not letting it bake longer than the 25 minutes made a big difference by keeping the centre moist.

These muffins were fantastic! The batter was a bit dry, but a little milk fixed that. By themselves, they have very little taste (to me), but they are one of those foods that once you add a little bit of jam or something, the taste comes out. These reminded me of a recipe I've had that was like authentic British cakes, except this is a whole-wheat version.

Dry and tasteless. After reading other reviews, I was really expecting a lot : (
