The recipe would be fine without the
dreaded MSG, and the red food coloring.

I adore this recipe! I use it for sweet and sour chicken at least once every two weeks. My husband and I are addicted to it! :) I don't add the msg or food coloring and the color is fine with me, but if I were serving it to company I would probably add the color just to make it brighter. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I tried this sauce tonight for use in my new restaurant.  It was exactly what I was looking for and tasted GREAT!  I omitted the MSG and food coloring.  I reduced the vinegar by a 1/4 cup and used salt sparingly.  A must have recipe for any sweet & sour dish.

I did not use the MSG or the food coloring but I did add a touch of red pepper flake. Even without that, this tasted pretty close to restaurant-made sweet and sour sauce. My husband thought it was a little too sour and I thought it was a touch too salty so I might play with the vinegar and salt a little.

This was an easy and tasty sauce. If MSG bothers you, (as it does me) leave it out! The sauce is just as good. I also left out the food colouring. The teensiest bit out onion powder is great too. Great, easy, and tasty sauce!

This was a tasty sauce. A little too vinegary for me, but my family says it is one to keep for my regular meal list.  I will adjust it just slightly next time, a bit less vinegar and a bit more cornstartch.  ***  Remade last week (11/8) reducing vinegar by 1/4 c, increased juice (canned) by 1/4 c, increased soy to 1/4 c and cornstarch to 3 TBSP.  We liked it better this way.

I really liked this recipe for a classic S&S sauce.  I made a few adjustments to fit what I had on hand.  I reduced the vinegar as suggested to 3/4c.  Did not have pineapple concentrate so I used the liquid from 1 can of pineapple.  As a result I had to slightly increase the cornstarch but I mixed it with some of the pineapple liquid so it would not "water down" my sauce.  I also slightly increased the salt.  I do not cook with MSG and I don't think it was needed.  I served over sauted veggies,pineapple, chicken, and rice.  My two year old even enjoyed this one.

This is really good although I think maybe just a little too much on the sour side.  I found a little less vinegar fixes that.  Also, buying a whole can of pineapple juice concentrate is a bit of a waste considering the amount required in the recipe.  I found that any pineapple juice I happen to have on hand works fine.  This is definitely a good recipe to keep on hand.

Just made this sauce for a "TRUE BLOOD" party tonight and I'm here to say this is "broke da mout Ono!" that is to say "this is one tasty sauce!" I like it much, much, better than what is served here on the Big Island. Only mad two changes. Used only 3/4c of vinegar and no MSG. I did use the red dye and I'm glad I did as it gave it a pleasant color and I think a little "eye appeal" goes along way with presentation. I'm mean come on people, what harm is 3 little drops going of food coloring going to do? This is being pared with Uncle Bills Chicken Strips from this site. A Hui HO!!

This is really good tasting.  I had to reduce the vinegar by half. I had no pineapple concentrate and had only a 1/2 c. of  juice from some canned pineapple.  I didn't use the red food coloring either - my finished product is such a dark brown due to the soy sauce, that no amount of food coloring could have had an impact.  However, even with all of the above, this is excellent and I will be making it again.  I served it with shrimp  cooked in Unbelievable Fish Batter from this website.  Great dinner.

thanks for sharing this recipe! its the closest to the one i had (and lost and had been making for yrs)and use it to make sweet n sour chicken. i reduced the vinegar and sugar (used half cup each), omitted the salt, msg, and food colouring and substituted the pineapple concentrate for the juice that comes in the pineapple can.

This recipe was easy to make, everyone loved it. I am going to make a big batch and pour it over meatballs and bring to a stag that I am going to next weekend. I also left out the msg & food colouring, I took other reviewers advice and decreased the vinegar.  Thanks for a simple recipe that even I can make.

Just made this and it is a keeper. My husband loved it but I found it was too much vinegar, so will cut down to 3/4 cup next time. I did not have garlic powder so substituted garlic salt and omitted the seasoned salt. I added a little marachino cherry juice in place of the red food dye and omitted the msg. I added chunked pineapple, green pepper and onion and served it over brown rice and breaded chicken chunks. Do need to thicken a little more next time. Will also use garlic powder and seasoned salt next time. Lynn

Excellent recipe. Made minor alterations (salt reduced, no msg)
Little bit more sour then sweet, but still good and sticky. Kids loved it.

GREAT!  I was leary about trying to make my own sauce but I think it came out wonderfully!  Thank you also for the tip of making the corn starch paste first, make the sauce come out very smooth with zero lumps!  I can't wait to make this for my next party!

Been searching for a sweet and sour recipe for a while, and this one is perfect!  I did not add the MSG or the red food coloring. I did add sesame oil, only like a few drops since it is super strong.

With the exception of not having the pineapple concentrate on hand, I made no adjustments to the recipe and it was truly very tasty. The authors comments about chicken and ribs are a clue to its use however. This is a more sour sauce that is best with meat. I made this as a dipping sauce for some crab puffs we made and it was not a good fit. We keep small 6 oz. cans of pineapple juice in our liquor cabinet so I used one of those and therefore needed a bit extra cornstarch. Next time I make this for anything not 'meat glaze' based, I will drop the vinegar to 1/2 C, 1/4 water, and use extra pineapple juice for the other liquid.

Very tangy and flavorful, with a fine balance of sweet to sour. I chose to omit the MSG and the food coloring. The coloring is not necessary, as the sauce is an appealing color naturally. I'm not sure why the submitter thought MSG was needed, as this simple sauce is more than fine without it. Otherwise, this recipe was made as written, and is one I will use again. Thank you.

I only used 1/2 cup of vinegar but followed the rest of the directions. Closest recipe I have found to our favorite Chinese takeout.  My husband even said he though it was better.

Nice, but i think that it tastes better with apple vinegar, which adds a little somethin' to the flavor...

I altered this a bit due to other reviewers.  I added 1/2 cup vinegar instead of 1 cup and still next time I think I'd use a little less than 1/2 cup. I tasted the vinegar and my husband hates vinegar taste lol so I added more sugar and he says it was the perfect amount of sweet/sour.  I would say that I added an extra 1/3 cup of sugar to mine.  My husband and children loved it.  It's not like my all time favorite restaurant's sauce but it isn't meant to be so it's definitely a good and easy sauce to make.  I would make it again.  Thank you so much for sharing it.

Delicious! I left out the MSG and red food colouring (didn't seem important) and it was amazing!  Oh, I also used pineapple juice instead of the frozen concentrate (didn't have any on hand) and also didn't have garlic salt.
I added in some chopped pineapple also.
Recipe is great and if you don't have MSG, red food colouring or frozen pineapple concentrate, your sauce will still turn out amazing.

This is a great recipe and very easy to make!  I used 1 1/2 C pineapple juice rather than the concentrate, and had to use more cornstarch.  I also left out the MSG and red food coloring.  Served it over meatballs at a luau and it was a big hit!

This is the first time I made a sauce from scratch and was thinking 'If this works out alright it will be a miracle' and it did.  I didn't use the MSG or FOOD COLOURING and still tasted great!

This was so good.  My boys tore into this.  I didn't add the food coloring or MSG and I don't think that I ever would now.  It was a little sweet and will try cutting down the sugar next time.  Because it was an easy meal that everybody loved, I gave it 5 stars.

This was very tasty but because I had no pineapple juice concentrate nor did it make sufficient sauce, I had to use regular pineapple juice and the drained juice from a can of pineapple...making it a tad too sweet.  I may make it again with the concentrate.

Nice sauce. Left out the MSG and food colouring as I found them both pointless. Served this over meatballs and rice, and it was very nice :)

This sauce was delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I omitted the MSG and simmered leftover pork loin chunks in it.  I garnished with maraschino cherries and pineapple chunks, then I served it over white rice.  This one is a definite keeper!!  Thanks!!

Very good!  The chicken was excellent.  The sauce was decent.  I'm not  a cook, so I can't really say what was missing.  I'll try it again and see if maybe I did something to mess it up (very possible!) :-)

Tastes better than the store! Wonderful dipping for fried chicken drummets and fried shrimp. I loved it! My mother-in-law raved about the sauce and could not believe it wasn't store bought. The only thing I had to do was add more soy sauce.

SO YUMMY! I did reduce the vinegar as others had. This was fabulous. For a quick sweet and sour chicken: make this sauce, cook up some rice and some chicken nuggets. Cut the chicken nuggets in bite-sized pieces and add them as well as pineapple, green peppers, and finely diced green onions (a definite must!) to the sauce. Really quick, really easy, and definitely delicious!

I love this recipe. I doubled the recipe up but only used 1 & 1/4 cup of vinegar. Instead of regualar MSG, I used a Seasoned Meat Tenderizer. I also added some Chili powder & crushed hot red peppers. SO yummy on Meatballs & white rice!

This is the best.  We used it for sweet and sour chicken.  I added pineapple chunks to the finished product.  I might try leaving out the garlic next time or use the real stuff.  I used salt instead of seasoning salt (because I didn't have any) and I did't think it would make that much difference.

My only comment is that MSG can be very dangerous to anyone, like me, who is allergic to it.  I don't think anyone should recommend using it without including a warning. MSG may cause a moderate to severe headache! 
Otherwise your recipe sounds great. I'm going to try it without the MSG.

Easy and delicious.  Like a lot of reviewers, I skipped the msg and food coloring. I added a tiny bit of fresh ginger, and pepper chunks, onion slices and pineapple before serving on our sweet and sour chicken.

When I make this, I reduce the ketchup to a 1/4 cup and use brown sugar instead of white. I also add a heaping 1/2 tsp each of ground ginger and granulated onion pwdr, along with 1/2 tsp of toasted sesame oil. It is a fantastic sweet and sour sauce for Chinese entrees or dipping ... very versatile.

If you're looking for a recipe like what you get at the Chinese restaurant, LOOK NO MORE!  This was very easy and turned out wonderful.  I did make adjustments suggested by previous reviews such as used only 3/4 cup vinegar, left out the MSG, however, I did put a few drops of red coloring in it. I also add a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce, plum sauce from the pack you get from the chinese restaurant, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Also, I didn't have Pineapple concetrate using Pineapple juice from the can adding 1 teaspoon of cornstarch for thickening at the end. I served it my own fried rice recipe I like to make. This is definitely a keeper and I love the fact that the ingredients required I usually have these on hand, so anytime I get that crave for some chinese food I can easily throw it together and VIOLA!

My fourteen year old daughter made this on her own about 5 min. ago. This was fabulous. She used the juice from a can of pineapple chunks and it was great. It required all the cornstarch/water mixture. No MSG or food coloring used or needed. Would recommend 3/4cp of vinegar next time as the vinegar is very strong. Tastes great though. Will be making this one again.

I have been making my own sweet and sour sauce using frozen pineapple juice for some time now. My recipe is similar, but I do not add red food coloring or MSG. I add about 1/3 tsp ground ginger and some garlic and onion powder. After removing rrom heat, I add a few drops of sesame oil. Sesame oil is very strong, so a few drops is plenty. Also, sesame oil must be kept refrigerated after opening.

Too much vinegar!!! I used half of the vinegar and it was still just too much. I used cider vinegar. I may try this again with changes-- I liked the pineapple juice in it.

I am rating this recipe a 4* with the reduction in vinegar that was called for by other reviewers.  I can't imagine a whole cup of the stuff...it was still pretty potent.  Some people had suggested leaving out the 1/4 cup water as to not water-down the sauce, I say it definitely needs it to tame the taste a little.  Didn't use the msg or coloring and overall my family thought this was a keeper!  Thanks for submitting.

This sauce served its purpose, but for one thing, you don't need the food coloring or MSG - also, the vinegar was too strong and just about burned my nostrils when I smelled it! Next time, I will cut back on the vinegar, or look for another recipe.

I made it tonight, and it got rave reviews. As others did, I omitted the food coloring and MSG, and used just the pineapple juice from a can of pineapple...but was still a hit.  I also used more of the cornstarch mixture. I thought it was really east to make.
