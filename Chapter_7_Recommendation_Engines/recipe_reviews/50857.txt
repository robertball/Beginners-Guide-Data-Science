This was a good recipe.  The second time I made it I doubled the garlic and caramelized the lime so I could drizzle it over the chichen just before serving.  To caramelize the lime: remove chicken from skillet and add approximately 2 tablespoons sugar and the lime juice. (I used 4 tablespoons lime juice.) Heat at medium, while stirring until sugar has dissolved.  Then raise the heat and allow to bubble for 2 minutes.  Yum!

some changes:  juice of one whole lime, and one whole lemon.   used 5 garlic cloves, and next time will use more.   didnt cut up chicken, just kept breasts whole.  was delicious but next time i will only use 2 Tbsp of olive oil, had a bunch left over that seemed unnecessary taste and calorie wise.   husband and company loved this, and was very easy.  good stuff, thank you.

This was just great - a simple yet tasty dish that the whole family enjoyed.  Because there are so few ingredients, I was expecting a somewhat bland meal, but the combination of cilantro and lime juice really eliminated the need for any other spices.  I used quite a bit more garlic than the recipe called for (we're garlic-aholics!), and used pre-cut chicken strips for a super quick meal.  Definitely a meal we'll have again and again!

pound out the chicken if you want it to fall apart in your mouth.  also, you can use lemon instead of lime juice and its good to go overboard with it.  consider adding a splash of white cooking wine to the recipe.  lastly, i like to add the cilantro right before I serve it, so it still has that beautiful green color and isn't wilted.

I have some picky eaters in my house and this was a smash. I used twice as much garlic and a little more lime and it was just to die for.  I also used white and dark meat chicken and it was great.

Very simple and easy.  Doesn't make a lot a sauce for the rice so I made the rice with chicken broth and onions.  Very good leftovers.

Tasty and fast, a great last minute meal!  We usually serve it over a packaged flavored rice, since there is a not a lot of sauce created by this recipe.

This was a good meal, served with Uncle Ben's original wild rice and steamed broccoli.
It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, though. My family enjoyed it as is, but I found it a bit lacking. If I make it again, I think I will add a little lemon juice as well to balance out the sweetness of the lime, or maybe a sprinkle of cayenne. I also think I will leave the chicken breasts whole, too, cutting them up was rather time consuming. Thanks for the recipe Nini, I am going to hang onto it.

The chicken itself was very tasty, but there was no sauce at all for rice.  I'll try cooking whole boneless skinless pieces next and add side dishes of my own.  Thanks!

My husband and I love lots of flavor, so we used 5 cloves of garlic and an entire lime's juice for two servings. It was SO delicious-- we're making it again very soon.

My husband hated this recipe - said it was way too bland.  I thought it could make a nice base - but a lot needs to be done with it to make it good.  Won't be making this again.

I had skinless boneless thighs on hand, which I cut into strips, not exactly bite-size.  Browned in 2 batches, then decided to add 2 med chopped onions.  Then at least double the garlic (more the better!) plus the zest from 1 lime and 1 lemon, which I used for the juice (why just use 2 T?  makes more sauce).   Great easy dinner.  I served with a rice/lentil mix, but white rice would be good too.

i used parsley instead of cilantro & chicken thighs instead of breast meat.  because it's what i had on hand.  my 6 year old said she wants the recipe for her kids...lol.  i also used the juice of 1 whole lime and twice the garlic.  overall a good dish, very quick and easy!

Not bad. If I make it again, I would use parsley instead of cilantro as I find the cilantro too overpowering of a flavour. I doubled the garlic which was a good thing because even at that it wasn't too garlicky. Very easy to make.

Even with the juice of a whole lemon and lime, this was kind of plain -- and dry served over rice. If there were some way to make a sauce of these ingredients, it might be yummy because the flavors are good. Watch your chicken closely because overcooking will make this dish even more dry.

Everyone liked it including my 8 yr old that is the pickiest eater I have seen.  I didn't put the cilantro on her portion though.  I doubled the garlic.  I think  next time I will double the lime juice too.

This recipe was very simple and easy, I had all the ingredients on hand.  I didn't use fresh cilantro, I'm not sure how much of difference that made but it was very tasty, extremely quick meal. Usiing this recipe for fajitas sounds like a great idea.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe. This recipe is great for people who love garlic and don't have a lot of time. Serving this disk with rice and green beans guarantees this recipe stays near the front of my recipe box.

I followed the recipe exactly, but still didn't care for it.  However, I think it's just my taste buds.  The rest of the family raved about it.  Must husband really liked it.  I think I will try it again in fajitas as another user suggested.

Only rating this 4 because it was slightly forgettable, and Ive made it a few times already. I love garlic, lime, and cilantro though so it is good. I double the garlic and serve with rice to make a quick dinner.

There is a lot of cilantro in it. We do not care that much for cilantro, so it was really too much.

I decided to use halved chicken breasts instead of chunks. It came out good but I would consider this more of a lime chicken recipe rather than garlic. It was quick and easy and the flavor was good. Just not the flavor I was in the mood for. That's the only reason for the three, otherwise I'd give it more.

This is a keeper.  Loved the flavor and the zip.  I had to use 2 limes to get enough juice.  Had a pita, salad and veggie with great for a low carb dinner.

I really love this one.  It's so easy to put together for a fantastic taste.  I get those tubes of herb pastes from stop and shop for the red chili and the cilantro.

Very easy, simple and quick. You definitely need to add a side dish for it  to be a dinner. I added all of the ingredients while the pan was still on so that the flavor was released and absorbed by the chicken. Also, I added more lime and cilantro, plus some lemon pepper. I served this dish with couscous. A great, quick and last minute meal.

Made this tonight and the family LOVED it. I loved how easy it was... I stuck to the recipe pretty much, just used chicken tenders and cilantro paste instead of fresh. I thought this had GREAT flavor and served with spanish rice and black beans, topped with some cheese, salsa, and crushed tortilla chips. Awesome, awesome, awesome.

This recipe was really easy and everyone loved it!! It was a great recipe to make after a long day at work because it did not require a lot. I did add just a little bit extra lime juice to give it a tad bit more flavor but other then that really good!!

Great recipe. My husband and I love it. I agree with everyone else, use more garlic and lime, and I didn't cut the chicken into pieces. I guess that's if you have kids. Still, it's my new favorite recipe!
