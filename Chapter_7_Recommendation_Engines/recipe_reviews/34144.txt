I made this the day after Thanksgiving with leftover smoked turkey breast and have been craving it since. My only change was to use poblano pepper instead of green...I don't like green pepper at all. No one else in the family would try it, but I loved it and ate it for breakfast for three days in a row. I'm making another batch tomorrow and plan to eat it for breakfast all week. Delicious!

Didn't flatten and crisp. Used red and orange peppers, fresh minced garlic and a minced jalapeno. In the end I stirred in 2 big spoons of turkey gravy.

I liked this a lot with a few changes.  I used turkey cutlets and seasoned them and broiled them.  Only used 2 sweet potatoes and the skillet did not work as indicated in the recipe so I put the mixture on a foil covered pan and broiled for 4 minutes.

I have been making something very close to this for many years. Instead of green bell peppers I always use red, yellow or orange, they just taste much better and to the mix I use about 1 1/2 cups of left over home made stuffing that was cooked inside the turkey, add an egg as a binder and we love it. Great way to use up the leftovers.

It didn't work out like the crispy pancake I expected. This needed a "binding" ingredient. Eggs maybe?

Super healthy, low sodium, and really good!  Some healthy recopies make you miss the unhealthy flavors, this is not one!  Also, it's easy to make which is always nice.

Made for my athlete daughter for breakfast. She made eggs too. Delicious.  I could not taste cumin and might add a bit more,  makes a lot . Fed us for two days and she brought some on the plane returning home.  Best if you darken the bottom before flipping.  It will have a better taste.

I added more olive oil as I found it to be too dry.  Otherwise I was pleased with how healthy and tasty it is.

Ok, so I made some changes, but we loved it! I diced the sweet potatoes and microwaved them til they were soft while I sauteed the onions. I diced 2 apples and added them, and omitted the peppers. Added the diced turkey and cooked it all in a cast iron skillet until the sweet potatoes were toasty. Yummy! I renamed it "Thanksgiving hash".

This was pretty good. I used ground beef instead of turkey. I didn't flip it to crisp both sides. I just crisped the bottom. Hubby liked it but kids didn't.
