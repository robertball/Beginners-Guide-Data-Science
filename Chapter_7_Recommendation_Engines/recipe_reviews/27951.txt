Easy. However, I cooked the chicken completely before "stuffing the pastry" and the pastry is what needed the extra cooking time, no less than 15 minutes, but probably more. I added mushrooms, Yummy! Overall good, not quite a 5, but very good!

This dish sounded like a nice recipe for a quiet, romantic dinner.  Unfortunately, 12-15 minutes isn't even close to long enough to cook the chicken breasts.  Even after browning, when they're wrapped in the pastry they take a good 40 minutes to cook through.  Everything else was cold by the time they were done - not to mention they were somewhat flavorless.  A let down.

Based on previous reviews, I baked longer (30 min)- at a lower temp (375) and it was excellent.

I followed the recipe except I cut the chicken in smaller pieces and the puff pastry in smaller squares. Then I brought the corners together and pinched the sides together.  I told my chidren we were having "chicken donuts" for diner and they loved them LOL!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I served it with Mushroom Rice from this site.  I saved a little extra shallots, minced garlic and mushrooms from that recipe for the chicken.  I cooked the garlic an shallots briefly and then added the chicken on top. Just as the chicken was finishing, I threw in the mushrooms.  I used the mushrooms to make a bed for the chicken on the puff pastry and then added cream cheese with fine herbs.  FANTASTIC MEAN!  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good. I used a plain cream cheese and mixed it with fresh chopped chives and 2 cloves of garlic. An easy, tasty and impressive looking meal.

This was great. I actually marinated  my chicken breast the day ahead I also cut into bite size peices . I added shredded gouda to the cream cheese and chives. VERY tasty. My only porblem was with the bottom of the puff pastry getting a little soggy, still very good !
Like others suggested I cooked longer then specified.

I've made something very similar to this for many years.  I use defrosted puff pastry sheets, rolled to 12x14 and then cut into 7x6 rectangles.  I place the UNCOOKED chicken (fold the lower tip on itself to make a uniform thickness) and herb cream cheese on the pastry and then fold it into little packages.  Overlap the edges and seal with egg wash.  Coat the outside with egg wash for a nice shine.  Place on baking sheet with folded edges down.  Bake at 400 for 30 minutes.  The pastry is beautifully browned and the chicken is nicely cooked.

This is a great base recipe that can be made into whatever variation you mind can conjure. Mine involved using Buttermilk Bisquits and rolling them out individually into a very thin sheet, placing the ingredients into the middle and folding up with a slight twist ( think of an onion ).  Then I used the garlic butter recipe found on this site ( fresh garlic and Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, etc ) and spread it over the very tops and then baked.  The garlic butter really gave the recipe a nice added flavor and was an even bigger hit with the family than the basic recipe.  If you precook your ingredients for the filling, the cooking time is measured only by the cooking of the biscuits.  Very easy meal to prepare, and tasty as leftovers ( make sure you get 2 packages of biscuits! )

try this...cube and cook your chicken and then fold into a mixture of cream cheese, green onions, mushrooms...a little sour cream...crushed pecans opt. and spoon into a spread out refrigerator cresent and roll up and bake for 20 mins on 350. Then spoon some cream of chicken soup diluted with milk over them as you eat them like gravy. My family loves these!

I have been making this for years with a slight difference.  I use crescent rolls and pinch two of the triangles together.  I place the chicken filling in the middle and then seal it up like a pocket.  For appetizers I just use one triangle and it makes a two bite size.  I brush the tops with melted butter and sprinke seasoned italian bread crumbs and parmesan on top!  Yummy!

The idea is great, but this recipe does have one error. Puff pastry SHEETS should be used, if you're going to roll it out -- not SHELLS! OR, this is how I did it: 1. Bake puff pastry shells (following directions on box).   2. Cut chicken into pieces and cook in skillet with oil & salt & pepper.   3. Combine cooked chicken with cream cheese (I used regular cream cheese plus fresh chives).   4. Fill shells with chicken/cream cheese mixture.   5. Pop them back in the oven for a few minutes to make sure they're nice and hot.   DELISH!!

I've made a version of this for many years. What I do is cook the chicken all the way thru and the chop it up. You can chop it as fine as you like and then mix it with softened cream cheese. You can use either the kind with the chives or plain and the add your own minced onion to taste. Also I have used Pillsbury crescent rolls instead of the puff pastry.Just pinch the 2 triangles into 1 square and then place the filling in the center. Bring all 4 corners together to form a pouch like package. Just make sure you pinch the corners together so the filling doesn't leak out. Since the chicken is already cooked you just need to bake until golden brown. This is a great way to use leftover chicken or turkey.  They are great with chicken or turkey gravy on the side!

I decided to do some modifications and boy is this TASTY! I had phyllo dough on hand, so I laid out a few layers, brushed with melted butter, put balls of stuffing evenly apart then layered more phyllo on top, pressed together between the stuffing and cut to form what looked like ravioli pastries.  Also, the changes I made to the stuffing were DELICIOUS!!!!  I boiled and shredded chicken breast, and mixed it with sauteed mushrooms and garlic.  I didn't have herbed cream cheese so I added sliced green onion to neufchatel.  I baked the pastries as directed and the results are WONDERFUL!  My husband loves them and I like how it's something different than the 'old usual.'

This was a good recipe that got me thinking so I ended up making a bunch of changes to this recipe. I fried the chicken in some olive oil with spices. Then I added another 4oz of cream cheese and mixed thawed frozen spinach into it. I put the spinach and chicken onto the pastry shell and rolled it. WARNING: It does take longer to cook than the recipe calls for.

This was great!  I took some suggestions from others and cooked the chicken entirely prior to putting it in pastry shell.  I diced it and sauteed it with some garlic, onions, mushrooms and spinach.  This was a great new twist on chicken for dinner!

I make this recipe with crescent rolls (keep the rolls in them in rectangles, fill with cream cheese mixture and then fold them up and pinch the rolls together). I also brush the tops with egg whites and sprinkle breadcrumbs on top for that little extra crunch. :) Yummy!

In order to cook the chicken thoroughly, in the time allowed on the recipe, the breasts must be pounded thinly or use chicken cutlets or tenders. This is an ok dish. Fine for a luncheon with the "girls."

It was really good.  Based on other reviews, I fully cooked the chicken and seasoned it liberally to make sure there was lots of flavor (some people said it was bland).  I think I may have over cooked the chicken, so next time I'll try to be more careful about that.  I added green onions and spinach inside as that is what I had on hand.  Also, because there were a lot of kids around, I cut each chicken breast into fourths and wrapped smaller "packages."  Great!  I will make again.  Very versatile.

Delicious!! As a cautionary tale, however, I should mention some of my failed modification attempts: I cubed the chicken before cooking, hoping that would cut down on the time, but then when I went to wrap up the pastries I couldn't exactly spread the cream cheese on the chicken, so I just put a dollop on each, assuming it would melt and spread out in the oven. It doesn't! So next time I will spread it out on the other side of the puff pastry before I fold it over (I cut the sheets into triangles to make little turnovers). Still tasted fantastic, though. I found baking 30 min at 400 browned them perfectly in my oven. An easy way to make something that seems so fancy! I made a double batch using a "family pack" of chicken breasts, two packages of puff pastry sheets, but just one pkg. of cream cheese, and I put the other 4 pastries (unbaked) in the freezer for another quick meal!

This is fabulous! In addition to stuffing this with chicken I stuffed with mushrooms and onions. It was a great change from the same ol' same ol' chicken dish. However, next time I'll make some rough puff instead of using store bought. My husband is quite a big eater and I went through a box and a half of pastry just for our meal and that's a bit much for our budget these days.

This was very good. The whole family liked it, which is saying a lot. The only changes I made (after reading reviews) was cutting the chiken up and cooking it in a skillet, and using cresent rolls. I was afraid that the chicken wouldn't get done in the oven. I couldn't find the pastry, so I used cresent rolls like some other reviewers. I cut up 3 chicken breasts, but had a lot of chicken left over. I put 2 cresents together to make a rectangle, spread the cream cheese on the cresents, then added some chicken on one half of the cresent, folded over the other half and pressed the ends together. One can of cresent rolls made 4 chicken puffs. This was enough for our family b/c we are trying to watch our portion sizes. Will add this to our dinner menu.

Impressive dish to make for company.  It was a rich dish.  I am thinking next time I make it I will add a little less cream cheese.  Don't make the mistake of cooking it with a cover on, as my husband did because that pan turned out a little pale and soggy.  The ones without the lid looked nice.

I made these, then tweeked it to our liking second time around.  I rated it on the recipe as is, but we like "ours" 5 stars.  I cubed and cooked the chicken, then stuffed the pastry w/ chicken, boursin (or allouette) and cooked, dried spinach.  DELICIOUS!

I got this recipe from the puff pastry box.  The only difference was that that recipe called for garlic and herb cheese spread, rather than flavored cream cheese.  I cooked my chicken almost through, and then wrapped in the puff pastry.  I plan on making this again, although next time I might try crescent roll dough instead.

I topped cream cheese  with fresh chopped green onions instead of using chived cream cheese. I pulled the dough up making a little pouch, brushed outside with a beaten egg yolk and made tiny slits for steam. I put it on a RACK so it wouldn't stick to bottom of pan. My husband said it was a definite keeper. Easy to make, tasted delicious and looked very impressive!

this was YUMMY! I added sauteed onions and used a rolled out puff pastry sheet instead of the shells. Turned out fantastic though I did have to cook it a little longer.

This is a great recipe-- it is now a regular in our house.  I cook it longer at lower temperature, otherwise the pastry burns before the chicken cooks through--darn growth hormones!  Aside from the cook time, the recipe is perfect.  Wonderful flavor and very hearty!

I used phyllo dough and a green onions and chive cream cheese to which I added heaps of fresh tarragon and some rosemary and garlic seasoning.  As suggested by a previous reviewer, I pounded the breasts thin and thus the cooking instructions produced a tender, perfectly cooked chicken breast and crisp, flaky pastry.  I served with steamed red potatoes and sauteed green beans with almonds.  I will make again, perhaps add some lemon tarragon sauce.

This was suprisingly good & super easy!  My boyfriend says its a keeper.  I cooked the chicken partially before wrapping in pastry, added garlic & cooked for 20 mins @ 425.  Maybe next time we will try Marinating  the chicken over night.

This was top notch! I made it this in my tiny dorm room kitchen and me and my roommates loved it! I couldn't find chive flavored cream cheese so i substituted it for garden vegetable cream cheese and it was BOSS.

I felt there was WAY too much cream cheese in each of the puffs.  BTW, I also cooked the chicken all the way through before putting them in the oven.

Very good and simple recipe.  Make sure your chicken has cooled a bit before wrapping in pastry shells...it will melt them and make holes when you fold it over.  My young kids liked it...we called it chicken in a doughnut.

Made this for my husband as a surprise. I used others' suggestions of cutting up the chicken, and I made sure they were cooked mostly through before the baking began. I also added some spinach. We LOVED this - hubby wanted THIRDS!

We thought this was just okay.  It looked great and the chicken was juicy and tender, but it lacked flavour, even though I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour before browning, and added Dijon mustard and fresh parsley to the herbed cheese.  It definitely needed the lemon sauce I served on the side for a flavour boost.

As is we gave it a 3 star but we want to try with some changes & see if it'll be more for our taste.  We decided to use mushrooms, garlic power, little tarragon & possibly some type of mixed cheddar cheese.  Otherwise we'd use herb de provence  for flavor.

Very good dish! Easy to make. The only change I would make would be to use puff pastry sheets rather than shells as they would be easier to work with.  The shells barely covered the chicken and I had to dice the chicken which worked out better.  I might add a little garlic to the chicken as well before putting the creme cheese in.

Very good.  A nice different way to cook chicken.  Looked beautiful. I flattened chicken slightly for even cooking and probably used a little less cheese, but it was Yummy!

Really, really great recipe! However I did make some changes. I cooked the chicken breasts thoroughly (with some minced onions)and chopped the chicken. I also added mushrooms. Next time I will add spinach as well.

Delicious combination of flavors. I used leftover chopped rotisserie chicken and mixed withthe cream cheese and a bit of shredded Monterey Jack and sour cream I needed to use up. My very picky seven year old gave this one a thumbs up.

This was a good dish. Next time I will use the pasrty sheets istead of the shells as mine didnt turn out looking all that pretty. Will make again. I cut the breast in half for smaller portions, took longer to cook than stated.

This was delicious.  I cooked the chicken in bite size pieces.  I used garlic and herb spreadable cheese,  as I had no cream cheese.  I added fresh spinach.  Thirds were asked for!  We made some in appetizer sizes and they were great, too!  My 6 year old had fun making them with me.

Cut chicken in one inch squares, brown and cook through first then proceed with recipe.  Very good.  Cook pastry until completely done.  Everyone's oven is different.  Beverly Jane

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used smaller pieces of chicken and instead of using an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese with chives, I bought a 3 oz plain cream cheese, softened it, and mixed in my own chives & onions.  Came out pretty good but I probably could have flattened out the pastry even more.  I think I will add a clove of garlic when cooking the chicken the next time, just for some additional flavor.  All in all it's a very good recipe.  I served it with peas & onions on the side.  I had left over puff pastry so I cut up some red pepper and onions, wrapped that in the left over pastry and stuck that in the oven with the chicken.  That was excellent too!

This recipe is great!  Especially made in smaller bites to set before hungry teens for a late evening nutritious snack! I also cooked the chicken before making and shredded it into smaller bite size pieces.  It has some room for flavor variations that was suggested by my dau.  Next time she wants me to add some cheddar cheese and experiment with some spices such as garlic.

So I seasoned my chicken in garlic powder and salt and added the mushrooms like someone else suggested. Then, after rolling out the puffs I spread the cream cheese on there and added the mixture. It came out delicious, but I do have to say that it did not stay pinched together. But, definitely was good!

The children and I thought this was delicious.  However, my husband peeled off the puff pastry and picked at the chicken. I gave the recipe 4 stars because it is good. However, because of the extra work involved with the puff pastry, will probably save it for impressing company.
