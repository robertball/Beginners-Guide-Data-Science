I've used this same recipe for years with one change. I do add one Tablespoon of flour after the onion is cooked before adding the milk and seasonings. This is a really wonderful recipe - simple and delicious. Oh and I use the white Worchester Sauce rather than the dark.

I also added in leftover broccoli, diced baked potatos, carrots juliened and left over spinach leaves and a can of mushooms.  Really turned out good and smelled delicious.

Super easy to make and pretty delicious, just a little too much Worcestershire sauce for me. I would maybe use 1 T next time instead of 2.

I made this for my family to try on Christmas Eve night and all my siblings loved it, even the one who criticizes my cooking. I think they loved it mostly because I substituted oysters with muscles. I did that because that was all we had, and I wanted to use them up.

Very Bland to me.  I love oyster stew but have never tried making it before.  This is missing something but because i have not made prior I could not put my finger on it.
