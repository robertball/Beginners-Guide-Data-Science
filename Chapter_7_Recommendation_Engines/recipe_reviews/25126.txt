I usually try recipes to the 'T' the first time, which I believe is necessary to properly write a review, then tweak it to what I think it needs or doesn't. Since I didn't have almond extract the first time, that's the only thing I left out. The second time, I used the almond extract and found it didn't complement the peanut butter taste. I recommend leaving it out & using vanilla extract. I also recommend using a cookie scoop to insure uniformity in appearance and cooking time; I use a reusable Silpat -- cookies are perfectly browned & slide off, without need for greasing or parchment. For a more defined criss-cross, use a pastry blender instead of a fork. If you don't have margarine, use unsalted butter instead; salted or a blend of both is OK also, but unsalted is just a bit healthier (as if cookies are healthy...haha). All in all, this is a great recipe, it's the one I use all the time.

What a great recipe for a light, crispy yet chewy cookie.  I didn't have the almond extract, so like others, just used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead.  I highly recommend refridgerating the dough before using, it made it so much easier since mine was soft.  I added chocolate chips to 1/4 of the dough, and boy, they were good. Everyone at work keeps coming back for more.

These are the best PB cookies I've had, and I've had some good ones. I usually use shortening and less soda in my PB cookies, and I've never used almond flavoring. So although I thought I had already found my favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies on AR, this one interested me. The almond extract does something subtle, not strong, to the flavor--enhances it & mellows it out at the same time. They are buttery, slightly crisp, and chewy. Try it as written, you won't be sorry. Excellent recipe, and thanks for sharing, Stephanie.

Excellent recipe! I used natural peanut butter since that's what I had at home, and added an extra half teaspoon each of the vanilla and almond extracts to compensate for the reduced sweetness. Also I only had a 1/2 cup of brown sugar at home so I upped the white sugar to a cup and a half instead of a cup. The one warning I would offer is if you are making these cookies for company, pay attention to the directions about how far apart to spread the cookies and make sure you shape them into a ball, otherwise they will run into each other and you won't see the criss cross design as well. My later batches were much more attractive than the first one when I put the balls too close together and didn't fully shape the balls of dough. If they are just for you and your family, though, it doesn't really matter, you will love these cookies no matter what they look like!

OMG, these are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  I just made a batch last week off the Crisco package and they were so so...I didn't have any more shortening and found this recipe.  These are soooo Good.  My whole family loves them including me who usually dislikes peanut butter.  Definitely a keeper.  Followed recipe as is only omitted the almond extract since I did not have any and put in 1-1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Great recipe.

I made these last night and had to come back today to write a review. They are absolutely irresistable...I can't stop eating them. Made the recipe exactly as stated except one change: Used Butter instead of margarine (I never use margarine. yuck.) I consider myself a bit of a cookie connoisseur and these taste fabulous. Perfect texture with crispy edges/soft, chewy centers. Oops I did make one more change...I added mini peanut better melts chips (kindof like tiny reese cups) to the batter. Perfectly done in my convection oven in 7-8 min. Yum!

These peanut butter cookies are the best! I baked them at 350 degrees for 12 minutes and instead of greasing the pans I used parchment paper. I used a floured fork to criss cross the tops instead of a wet sugared one and left out the almond extract because I didn't have any. Also I used 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder instead of the 1 1/2 tsp baking soda. Usually I add some semi-sweet chocolate chips to half of the dough because some of us prefer them that way.

Very easy.  Classic peanut butter cookie, as far as I am concerned.  I used Bestlife buttery baking sticks instead of margarine.  Had never tried them before.  Seemed to work just fine.  I looked at all the jars of peanut butter on the store shelf and the only one I could find without added sugar was Smucker's Natural Peanut Butter.  I did not want sugar in the peanut butter...I can add it myself!  Thought perhaps I'd get a better peanut taste.  They're good.

These cookies were delicious. I did not have any almond extract so I had to leave that out but what a great recipe!! My dough was a bit soft so I had to refrigerate it before shaping. I also used a pastry blender dipped in sugar to make the criss-crosses as it gives a bit more definition than using a fork. Family and office workers all loved them!

These are so yummy and easy! I did not use the almond extract,but they were perfect. I also just wanted to say that the second time we made them we covered the dough and kept it in the fridge for 2 days,and they still came out de-lish. I definately recommend chilling the dough before you work with it because they will come out on the thin side if you don't. We also made a half batch where we did not press the cookies with a fork and they cooked just as good,chewy but the edges did not crisp-and I prefer them that way! Thank you so much for such an easy,great tasting recipe!

The taste and texture are 5 stars, but the dough was too loose to roll into balls, so I had to make them as "drop" cookies and then criss-cross.  They came out very thin and flat.  I added oats and chocolate chips to the remaining dough and they came out delicious!!

these are pretty good, although a bit to sweet for my taste.  next time i'll reduce the white sugar to 3/4 cup and see if they're less 'gritty'. i used butter rather than margarine, and i did not use almond extract because it didn't seem like something i would want in a peanut butter cookie. i baked them at 350 degrees on a non-greased sheet for about 8 minutes which was perfect for my oven. the bottoms were beautifully golden and the centers were still soft.

Super yummy! I did refrigerate my later batches, and they were easier to shape than the first, which was too soft to make into balls.

This recipe is fabulous! I followed precisely, including using the almond extract.  If you aren't accustomed to baking with almond, you won't miss it, but if you use it regularly (like I do) you'll know it's there! Wonderful addition to the recipe.  After baking 1/2 the recipe, I added mini-choco chips to the second 1/2.  Good stuff! Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

I usually don't enjoy cookies after the first day, and more times than not only eat them right out of the oven.  These cookies were even more tasty to me the second day but that is as far as I got with them between me and the kids.  Great recipe.  Thanks for the keeper!

I have no idea what I am doing wrong with these cookies.  I have made them twice (using butter instead of margarine each time) and the dough is so wet that it is hard to roll them into a ball.  Also after baked they are thin and fall apart when you try to hold them.  Taste good though.  I wonder if anyone else has this problem with the consistency.

Very, Very good recipe. Except I would strongly suggest to use natural peanut butter like simply Jif and real butter..eliminating the hydrogenated oils makes all the difference. Otherwise YUM!

Being English I'm not really a frequent cookie baker! I'll usually make a cake or biscuits... But an American friend of mine had a really crappy day and I tried a batch... Took me a while to get the size of dollops right, and them being perfectly cooked etc. But I would be interested to know whether this is actually supposed to make a dough? Like one you work with your hands into balls? Did I just have too littel flour or something?
Anyway regardless of my amateur American baking skills the cookies were lovely I would definately make them again :D

These were a hit! I substituted whole wheat flour for the flour and dark brown sugar for white. They didn't last a day!!!! Next time I'm going to try them with All Natural Peanut Butter.

I am not experienced at making peanut butter  cookies, so thought I would try this recipe. I followed the recipe, but was dissapointed. Think I will keep looking. I might try one I saw made with baking powder. 
8/26/13...I am changing my rating from 2 to 4 stars because once these cookies cooled completely they were awesome. The recipe does state to cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes and then cool completely, and these instructions have to be followed!! They cannot be handled until cooled completely or they will just fall apart. This information just needs to be stressed!! Another helpful tip is to refrigerate the dough at least 2 hours before baking as I do with almost all of my cookie recipes to make it easier to handle.  I then use a cookie scoop and flatten the cookie Very Lightly(not completely) with a fork and make criss crosses. Use parchment paper and bake as directed!!

Perfect amount of sweet, salty, & peanut buttery w/o overdoing the PB cookie.  Doesn't send my blood sugar quite as high!!

These cookies are the bomb!   Even my oldest that doesn't like peanut butter ate these.   Easy to make and my little ones helped with the dough.  These cookies are a keeper.

I thought these were good. I also didn't think they had a very strong peanut taste, but I'm not sure how to make it more pronounced. I've noticed that this happens with many peanut butter dessert recipes I've tried.  I made only one change in the recipe, using butter instead of margarine (I'm not a margarine fan). I will also omit the almond extract the next time I make these; my family and I like almond flavor, but it just seemed to detract from the peanut flavor. All in all, tho, I will keep this recipe as it is easy to prepare, makes several dozen cookies, and my family gave it a "thumbs up".

I don't know if I'm missing something, but I wasn't impressed with these cookies at all.  I love almond flavoring, but it causes these cookies to taste like a Christmas cookie instead of a peanut butter cookie!  I used chunky peanut butter in the hopes of creating an even more peanut buttery tasting cookie.  But not so with this recipe.  Watch the cooking time listed, these cookies bake fast and can easily burn.  I won't be making this one again.

What an easy recipe!!!  I doubled it and got 6 dozen extra large cookies.  I did use the whole jar (18oz) of peanut butter because I hate dealing with the cleanup of peanut butter afterwards. (recipe called for 2 cups if doubled or 16 oz) I also used parchment paper sheets on my baking pans (used the same 3 sheets the entire time), let them cool on the tray and they came off beautifully.  I did not notice a difference rolling them in sugar so I didn't do anymore this way.  What a joy to work with!!!

These are super simple to make and delicious too!  I changed the recipe a little bit.  After I decided I was going to make this recipe, I discovered I had no butter - so I used shortening plus 1/4tsp. salt instead.  I was afraid that using shortening instead of butter would not give them that delicious buttery taste, but they tasted delicious....probally all that peanut butter.  I also added about 1/2c. of chocolate chips to the recipe.  It was DELICIOUS!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to skip the sugar coated fork.  I'll still push them down with the fork, but not bother with the sugar on top.  I didn't think it added much to the recipe, and I enjoyed the few that didn't have a sugar coating on the(my daughter forgot to recoat the fork a few times).  *** update - after trying a few cookies without the chocolate chips, I would keep the sugar coating if I wasn't addin chocolate chips.

This was a pretty good recipe even with my mistake. I add a tablespoon of vanila instead of a teaspoon.  The only problem that I had was that it was not peanuty enough for me.

These cookies are delicious and so simple to make. I will substitute whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour the next time I make them, with honey in place of the white sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my husband because he loves cookies.  He loved them.  He said they were nice and soft and have a great taste.  The almond extract overpowers the peanut butter so it doesn't have a strong peanut butter cookie taste, but very tasty anyway. I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again many times.  Thanks for sharing.

Peanut butter cookies are my favorite.  I am always making different ones in search of the best, and so far, this one is it.  I made them as written and they came out perfect.  Light and crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  I will surely be making these over and over.  My happy tummy thanks you for such a wonderful recipe.  :)

I couldn't find the almond extract so I ended up using all vanilla.  We baked some at 350 10 minutes --- liked chewy texture.  375 10-12 minutes --- very crunchy but 4 year old did not like the "salt" texture.  Decided to add oatmeal to remaining batter (couldn't tell you how much).  Chilled overnight, preheated oven to 375 but cooked at 350 for 10 minutes.  We all thought these were the best and I WILL make them again!

These are without a doubt the BEST peanut butter cookies I have ever had! I just started learning how to cook and they were so easy to make and my family couldn't beleive that I cooked them! Thank you so much for this recipe!! 
Plus...they are really good if you add chocolate chips and/or chopped walnuts!!

I think I've eaten like nine of these since they came out of the oven. I didn't have margarine, and ran out of salted butter, so I used a stick of salted, and a stick of unsalted...they still were awesome. They won't look or feel done,  but cool on the cookie sheet and they turn out great.

These cookies were fabulous! Chewy and melt in your mouth! Next time, I will roll them in sugar then press out with a wet fork instead of dipping my wet fork in sugar. My sugar tended to clump, which only altered the looks not the delicious taste!

Really good, I like the almond extract. I only had half a cup of brown sugar and used a full cup of white and added crushed smarties. Really good, nice and light. I whipped the first ingredients before adding flour.

These cookies got a 5 star from my husband, the peanut butter cookie monster.  I was out of crisco so was searching for a p.b. cookie recipe using butter instead of shortening.  This one looked good so i tried it.  Used salted butter instead of margarine, added 1 teaspoon peanut butter flavoring instead of almond flavoring, and added 1/2 t. of baking powder.  They are delicious.  perfect texture, a bit crunchy just like my dh likes them.  I give them a five star rating and they are my new go to recipe for p..b. cookies.

I used both almond and vanilla extract and the two compliment each other in this AMAZING cookie. I use Jiff peanut butter and I did not refrigerate the dough prior to baking. These cookies did not last long at all in my home ??.

Soooo good!  Added Reese's peanut butter chips.  Second batch also added chocolate chips.  Used an organic creamy peanut butter and butter instead of margarine.  Did not use Almond extract, just I don't like it.  Dipped some in chocolate. Those were my fav.!!! Per others, I refrigerated dough which helps forming the balls.  My son would not believe I made them, thought I bought them!
Definitely making again!!

I love peanut butter cookies and these are no exception.  The only thing I did different was to use butter.  They turned out crisp and delicate.

I made them exactly as directed and these cookies are the best I have ever made. My husband tried them and he said he couldn't believe how much peanut butter taste they have. I made a second batch for my son and put in some mini peanut butter chips just because I had to use them up before they went bad. Wow made an already awesome cookie into an even better cookie. You can't go wrong with this recipe. I cooked the first batch at 9 minutes and the second batch at 10 minutes. Both are great. Thus recipe made over 32 cookies. I did stick the cookie dough in the fridge for an hour before I cooked them to firm up the dough to make it easier to scoop.

These are amazing. I definitely recommend using almond extract. It makes a world of difference. This will be one of my go to recipes from now on.

These are so delicious! Somehow they are chewy and crispy and light all at once. Normally I don't use margarine (I like butter for baking) but wanted to follow the recipe exactly. I did use the almond extract and I love the flavor it added - I will use from now on in my peanut butter cookies. My dough was very soft and they did spread in they oven more than other photos show, not sure why, but I like how they turned out. I'm sure the party I'm taking them to will finish them off. :)

Great, easy recipe. Followed instructions. Ended up adding 1/3 cup more flour but I can attribute that to many factors. Cookie is soft, good flavor and exactly what I was looking for. I am not sure if the almond extract is common in all PB cookie recipes, but I thought it was a great hint of flavor.

Fantastic! I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. And used natural peanut butter. Added a touch more sugar to compensate. Must must try! The almond extract is Delish! (Even after I accidentally poured what I'm thinking was 2 teaspoons in lol)

I don't care for almond extract so I used only vanilla. I also used butter because I don't use margarine, and used all whole wheat flour. They came out the perfect texture for us, baking 350 for about 12 minutes giving them lightly crisped edges and soft middles. My only complaint is they weren't peanut-buttery enough for us so I might add an additional 1/2 cup peanut butter next time.

This is my 2nd time making these because my husband loves them. I follow the recipe except for adding chocolate chips to the batter. I refrigerate the batter while the rest are baking. It makes the batter easier to handle. Great recipe!

I love the texture, crisp at the outside edge with a chewy center.  But they didn't seem like they had very much flavor.  Maybe it was because I used chunky peanut butter.  Otherwise I followed the directions to a T.  Even the almond extract.  This made so much dough I had to refrigerate some to bake the next day.  Maybe I can add some chocolate chips or something to spruce the rest up.

I am not a big fan of PB cookies however the wife wanted me to make some for her to make to work so. based on the reviews I figured to try out this recipe and I am glad I did. These are some great cookies! Easy to make and they taste great. I liked them as the taste of PB was not overwhelming. They were at big hit with the kids and other teachers at the school (my wife is a teacher) I will definitely keep these on my best cookies recipe list! list.

Made these almost as written, only used butter instead of marg. & omitted the almond extract - just personal preference.  I added PB chips for that extra PB kick.  Made larger cookies and baked for 11-12 minutes.  Perfect.  Great basic cookie recipe, thanks!!

These are some straight up good cookies. The fat to flour ratio is right on. These are a good basic peanut butter cookie to start with ready for variations. 

I did not add the almond extract, as I am allergic. I added 2 cups of white chocolate chips to the dough and sprinkled the top of the cookie with kosher salt just before baking. 

Delicious.

Absolutely outstanding recipe. I love the almond extract in this cookie.   I used chunky peanut butter - and probably a little more than a cup.  I also used organic sugars, butter instead of margarine; AND... I used 1/2 cup organic flour and 2 cups of almond meal.  Substitutions are to satisfy my desire for a healthy lifestyle and made these cookies excellent.  Oh, and I added chocolate chips too!

Thought I reviewed this, but don't see it. OMG! YUMMY! Batter is so easy to work with. Added a bit of Heath toffee bits and rolled in sugar before the criss-cross.  Wish I could find a good choc chip cookie! Mine are always flat. Beginning to think the guys my husband works with will eat ANY homemade cookie! Thanks again for this p butter recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  These cookies bake up to perfection.  I did sub butter for margarine.  I rolled each ball in sugar before baking and did not press with a fork.  Also, I baked them for  8 minutes, put a Hershey Kiss in each center, and baked another two minutes.  Perfect, absolutely perfect.

Great Easy Quick recipe. A little floury tasting though. My kids made them one rainy evening and my daughter tossed chocolate chips in some. Those turned out the best! Overall a must try and the kids loved them.

I remembered a peanut butter cookie from when I was a very young girl that I loved. (Normally, I hated peanut butter cookies). This cookie was what I thought was the greatest thing since sliced bread! All I knew was that it had almond extract and thought I'd never find it. Well, lo and behold-- if this isn't it, it the closest thing to it. I made them and they were as I remembered-- a light, not heavy peanut butter tasting, cookies---absolutely wonderful!

I doubled the amount of Almond Essence (only recommended if you love almond flavour as much as my dad) I also used baking powder instead of bicarb of soda (terminology sometimes confuses me!) so they were a little more "cakey". Everyone loved them, including me, just got to go to the gym 2 more times this week! haha! Small price to pay. (",)

These came out really good. I added a 1/3 cup of flax seeds tho' to make them somewhat less sinful (with all the fats and sugar they aren't the healthiest - BUT WHO CARES!!!). This recipe yielded me over 6 dozen as well.
