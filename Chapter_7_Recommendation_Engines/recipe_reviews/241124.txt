We put in 1/4 c honey and none of the brown sugar. We also mixed all the ingredients together (except butter) and smashed the berries with a potato masher. Then stirred in the melted butter. Will definitely be making this again!

I didn't mash the blackberries but divided them in the tart shells to make sure they were evenly distributed. I used 1 tsp each of lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla. The lemon really emphasises the blackberry flavour, very springy and fresh tasting. My tarts baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Enjoyed by my family!

I made this but instead of individual tarts, i did so as one pie-sized tart. The taste is delicious but with the increased size/ and the high altitute I live at I had to compensate as the tart was far too liquidous if following the recipe and would never set. I increased the baking time to 37 minutes on the lowest oven rack with the crust shielded to prevent over-browning. if done in pie-size, I recommend using a glass pie tin (not a aluminum one), use shortening/crisco on the pie plate and sprinkle with flower before putting the crust down, so the bottom crust isn't soggy and pulls out when served easier.  to help it set, 2 tsp of cornstarch will do the trick. Also, if your blackberries are sweet rather than tart, i'd recommend mixing some cranberries in for tartness (about a cup) and using 1 tsp of vanilla instead of a tablespoon, otherwise it's too sweet. let set at least 2 hours, overnight is better. Also, When I made it I did not mash the baerries and lemon zest together as the recipe suggests, i stirred gently, it ends up for a prettier (and more colorful-if you add cranberries) tart and has a better texture I think.

I love this recipe. The extra sauce mixture really gives the tarts flavor. The tarts did taste a little too lemony, I would recommend putting lest lemon zest in these tarts. Otherwise, very delicious!

I made this as written, except I added lemon juice instead of the lemon zest.   The came out wonderful, very tasty.   For my oven 400 was a bit much, baked at 375.   Thanks!
