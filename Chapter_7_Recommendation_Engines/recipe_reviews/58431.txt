I am probably one of the world's biggest buffalo chicken fans on the planet and found this just super!! I added a touch more hot sauce and just a little garlic powder and served with homemade blue cheese dip and celery sticks and a garden salad-Delicious!!!

This recipe is really good. I love really hot food so I added extra hot sauce to suit my taste. I couldn't find provolone cheese to shred so I just used slices. I only used one and that was not enough for me so I will probably add another next time. Thank you for the great recipe!*****

*****I have been making this recipe for three years now!!! And will continue for years to come. Of course I have switched it up now and then and my favorite way is to pound out the chicken, mix up some cream cheese and shredded mozzarella, place of ball of the cream cheese mixture in the center and roll the chicken over, secure with toothpicks. I love the flavor of the cream cheese and hot flavored chicken. Yum! Yum! Yum!

If you like Buffalo wings, you'll love this recipe!!   I did not use the provolone cheese, rather I chose Pepper Jack cheese (we love spicy food).  The other change I made, was I tied the rolls with string instead of using toothpicks to secure the rolls during cooking.  This dish was easy to make and was a hit at my house.  My 2 year old even liked it!  We are not big blue cheese or Ranch dressing fans so I served Goya yellow rice and a fresh garden salad with it.  

Thank you D and S Parker!!  I hope you have some additional recipes to share.

This came out really good, although I thought it was even better the next day.  I didn't bother pounding out the chicken breast - it was still tender the next day after baking and microwaving.  Delicious with Paul Newman Ranch dressing.  I just cut each chicken breast in half, then marinated in a zip lock bag.  5 minute prep time, seriously.  I actually forgot about it for a while so I left it in there for about a day and a half.  Still good!  Because I made this for lunches this week, I left the cheese off, and threw a piece on before microwaving it (40 seconds).  This freezes well - I made a bunch (and froze them) for my boyfriend and sent it back on a 5 hour flight, and it worked great.  Served it with ranch dressing, what a QUICK and easy meal!

Had planned on trying this recipe, but found that I had bought chicken tenders instead.  I marinated the tenders in the Tabasco for about 5 hours and sauted them and used in a warm tortilla with cheese, lettuce, tomato, black olives and green onions.  Wonderful.  Reminded me of the Southwest Chicken rollups from Applebee's.  The next morning my husband make southwest chicken and eggs in a tortilla with the leftover chicken.  Thanks for heading me in the right direction for new recipes.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! Chicken came out moist and full of flavor. I let mine marinate in the fridge and hour and a half or so while I ran errands. The mixture solidified a little, but it was still good. Not to spicy at all. Used sliced prolone instead of shredded because its easier to roll. Only used about 1 1/2 slices per breast, next time I will double. Served with blue cheese. This will now become a regular on my dinner menu. I am also on a low-carb diet and I am going to take the other reviewers suggestion of putting this chicken on salad. I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed these and they were so simple. 2 forks up!!

These were pretty tasty!  I didn't have any provolone on hand so instead I used string cheese mozzarella which the chicken wrapped around perfectly.

Messy & cheese is unneccessary. Tried again and found the best was to pound the chicken breast so it wasn't so thick and then coat in hot/buffalo sauce. It was better.

My fiance and I loved this recipe. We are huge buffalo chicken fans, so we thought this receipe had the perfect "kick" to it. We ate ours with a dollup of sour cream. Mmmmm! I will definitely make this again!

I marinated mine for over an hour. They came out moist with great buffalo flavor. I used franks sauce and sliced swiss cheese. Delish!

YUMMY! I'm not sure if I should rate this because I changed it up so much...but here's what I did: I pounded two chicken breasts and put in a ziplock and I poured about 1/2 cup of Frank's redhot sauce in there (no butter.) I marinated for 24 hours due to everyone saying it had no flavor. The night I went to prepare it, I mixed shredded mozzerella with about 4 oz of cream cheese and stuffed and rolled my chickn breasts with that. I toothpicked and placed seam side down and baked according to instructions however I think the recipe is a bit too long - check them before the times says as they will likely be done. All in all, it was a delicious, flavorful and I'll certainly make again. Next time instead of pounding, I might just cut a slit in the breasts and do the rest the same.

Delicious.  I made some very small changes.  I marinated the chicken for a few hours in the baking dish, then baked.  I didn't roll the chicken, simply laid the cheese on top.  Very easy and wonderful for my superbowl "party".

Thought it was wonderful, and didn't change much. Didn't bother to mess around with rolling it up. I just pounded the breasts slightly, and after marinading, baked in the oven with a probe thermometer to 150. Took out, added mozzarella baked it until it was 170. So good with ranch dressing. Thought it had plenty of flavor.

These were great!  I took the advise of other cooks and used hot wings sauce instead of hot sauce.  I also cut the chicken down into smaller strips and used pepper jack cheese.  This would be great as an appetizer too.

Yum! I used pepper jack cheese as another reviewer suggested. Another recipe on this site is almost the same as this.  It is called Buffalo Jack Chicken.  Learned from that recipe that in this one you can leave the butter out and it wouldn't make a difference. Save yourself some calories.

Tastes great!  Wish it was sorta 'crispy' on the outside instead of chicken boiling in sauce.  Just can't beat grilled buffalo wings!

The chicken ended up being a bit dry.  I also added jalepenos and used pepper jack cheese, to make it spicy (following advice of other reviewers). I would make again, but will adjust the cooking time.

this was really good, my only complaint is it wasnt all that buffalo-saucy! i think it would be awesome if there was more sauce. also, used colby-jack instead of provolone. i'll still make it again no doubt! i love buffalo chicken anything!
EDIT: i cut and warmed up a leftover piece of this and put it over a salad with romaine lettuce, tomatoes, mozzarela cheese, and ranch. it was probably the best salad that i have ever had!!!

This was SO GOOD.  I had 9 breasts that I marinated on Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce for almost 48 hours.  I rolled some with pepperjack, some with mozzarela and some with provolone.  Then dipped in melted butter and coated with a mixture of dry ranch party dip and bread crumbs wich really helped to keep it moist, uncovered just long enough for breading to crisp and turn golden.  So easy to make and tasted wonderful.  Can't wait to try with stuffing and gravy.

This is the classic buffalo chicken wing flavor minus the minced garic. I pound the breasts flat before marinating to allow for better rolling and spread some minced garlic on the breast before the cheese. Great recipe.

These were a huge hit at our Super Bowl party! Butterflied the chicken, pounded it until it was about 1/2'' thick, marinated it in Emeril's Buffalo Wing Sauce for about two hours. Used mozzerella and blue cheese, rolled into spirals, cooked at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. Sliced into 1'' thick slices, baked for another 10 minutes at 400 degrees. Served with chunky blue cheese and ranch dressing. A great way to have the taste of wings without all the fat and calories!

Terrific! This is a must have recipe for those on a low carb diet ( and for everyone else who loves buffalo chicken)

I found I had to cook  longer than 5 minutes (about 15) to brown the chicken in the final step, but that could be my oven. The chicken was still moist though. I also used sliced provolone rather than shredded.

This is very easy ,takes few ingredients, and has great flavor. My family really liked it and I will be making again soon.

This was very tasty and popular with the whole family.  I think next time I might bake the marinated breasts on a rack to make it a little more crispy.  All in all, a definite "do again".

This was a very tasty dish. I made it exactly as written, except I didn't serve it with ranch or blue cheese dressing, as I don't really like either. I think this was the first time I'd ever flattened chicken breast halves - I'm not sure I got them as thin as they should've been, but they were able to be rolled up well enough to be secured by toothpicks. I also freshly shredded the provolone from a block I had on hand. The heating instructions seemed a little confusing though - the part about letting it brown 8 inches from the heat. Was this intended to mean switching to the "broil" oven setting? Placing the dish closer to the bottom of a bottom-heating oven wouldn't make much difference, I wouldn't think, so my rolls didn't really get browned. All in all, though, these were great to eat, and a pretty good approximation of a full-fledged buffalo chicken sauce, given the simple list of ingredients. (I usually read all prior reviews before posting my own, but I'm skipping the 116 prior reviews here.)

This was ok.  The chicken needs to marinate a little longer in the hot sauce.  We thought the hot sauce would leave more of a taste.  Otherwise it was good, we dipped in ranch dressing with celery and carrot sticks.

I made this for my fiance for his birthday dinner because he is obsessed with Frank's Red Hot Sauce. I marinated the chicken for about 2.5 hours in the butter/hot sauce mixture, stuffed with pepperjack cheese instead of provolone, and baked seam side up. A little of the cheese seeped out, but not too much. I didn't try this, as I don't do spicy food, but my fiance *LOVED* it... he used the word 'amazing' alot. hehe. Thank you :)

I made this years ago with crumbled blue cheese inside.  I don't think you need the extra browning, you wind up drying out the chicken.  Tonight I sliced the chicken in half to make 2 thin pieces (no pounding).  I laid them flat in the dish and poured the sauce over it. After cooking 30 minutes, I spread some cream cheese on a flour tortilla, added the chicken (cut up small), crumbled blue cheese and diced celery.  Really yummy wraps!

Well, after reading wonderful reviews for this recipe, I am going to give a poor review. We love Buffalo anything. And, I make awesome buffalo wings and buffalo chicken sandwiches. That being said, this tasted like bland, boring baked chicken with hot sauce. My husband, who lived in Buffalo, also thought it was boring and bland. Try just pounding your chicken breast, double dip it in egg/milk and flour, fry and coat in Frank's hot sauce simmered with melted butter. Put it on a bun with blue cheese and fixins. I will stick with that when I want something quick and spicy - sorry!

My son and I love anything that has buffalo flavor so these were awesome! I used double the amount of hot sauce (Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce) and used pepperjack cheese in my son's rolls and blue cheese crumbles in mine. My son ate his rolls with store bought ranch and I ate mine with homemade blue cheese dressing! Amazing!

This was a great recipe. I used the sauce from Restaurant Style Buffalo wings and since I hate pounding chicken, I just cut a slit in each breast and stuffed the cheese in the pocket. Next time, I think that I'll use gorgonzola or bleu cheese rather than provolone. Thanks D & S Parker!

I used buffalo wing sauce instead of the hot sauce butter combo.  Also substituted mozzarella for provalone.  Turned out good, a neat idea and a tasty dish.  Thanks!

These were good, but throwing a piece of cheese on top of a hot sauce marinated chicken breast would have produced the same result.  It did have a good presentation because I layed large leaves of iceberg lettuce on each plate with diced tomatoes sprinkled on top.  Then drippled blue cheese dressing and more hot sauce over the lettuce leaves.  After that, just laid the chicken rolls on the lettuce leaves and it dressed it up a lot.  Was very yummy too:)

Very good!  Used pepper jack cheese and added some sliced jalapenos- very spicey and yummy.  Also, before baking I coated chicken rolls in crushed tortilla chips.  This is a new favorite of mine :)

A tasty altenative for wing lovers. I used pre-flattened breasts from my grocer's butcher counter, and next time will use blue cheese or cheddar. The provolone was a little mild for my taste. Also would serve with blue cheese sauce for dipping!

As written, this recipe is not very good, but with some changes, it can be fantastic. We shred pepperjack cheese and mix it into an 8 oz container of cream cheese. We then add red crushed pepper and chili powder. Spread the mixture over thinly sliced strips of raw chicken, roll into a ball and secure with toothpick. Cover the entire dish liberally in buffalo wing sauce and bake. Has so much more flavor than the original recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe. For the thin cutlets I adjusted the cook time to 375 degrees for 25 mins covered and then added another slice of provolone cheese and put it under the broiler for 1 min. 

I also spooned a little of the sauce over it before cooking. Served with white rice and a cool crisp salad with light ranch for dipping!

I did not care for this recipe. The chicken ends up dry and tasteless. I can barely taste the cheese or the buffalo sauce. I was disappointed in the recipe both times I made it.

Pretty good.  Seemed like the chicken got a little overly salty by absorbing the buffalo sauce.  I used Frank's.  Next time I will try a different one!

Very easy recipe. I used Siracha sauce (sp?) instead of buffalo or franks red hot sauce -- very spicy! I also left it in the sauce when I baked it to keep a lot of the heat. I put the cheese mixture on top instead of doing rolls because we were out of toothpicks, but it worked wonderfully as well.

These were ok. I marinated them over night and used pepperjack cheese in place of the provolone. They were a little dry not too dry but a little dry. I poured some of the marinade on them before baking and the rest when I took them out and upped the temp. on the oven. Not bad, might make again. Thanks.

*Drool* This was great! Its pretty salty because of all of the hot sauce, but its still wonderful.  I used half of a string cheese in the middle of each breast and shredded mozz on top.  Next time I will try pepperjack cheese, like others suggested, and minced jalapenos on the inside.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  I let mine marinade for 1 day and poked holes in my chicken breasts.  I could hardly taste the marinade and had expected it to be more spicey.  I used the Buffalo Chicken Sauce recipe from this site.

a healthy alternative to buffalo chicken since it's not breaded and it's baked! I did pile on the cheese though haha! we really enjoyed this but both agreed it would be better while watching football or something like that rather than for dinner...very easy though and tasty!

I give these 10 stars.  I made this dish for a NASCAR Party yesterday and they were gone in no time at all.  I wished I had made more of them because there was not enough for everyone.  I doubled the sauce and used Pepper Jack cheese.  I also cheated and bought thin sliced chicken breasts to omit having to pound out regular chicken breasts.  This dish took no time to make.  Will definitely make again.

This was a great idea but I didn't have anything but tenderloins and I put the cheese on the top.   It was scrumptious!  I would have really LOVED it if I could have used bleu cheese, but husband won't go near it, however,  the provolone was really yummy too!

These turned out really good! I would give the recipe 4 stars alone, but after dipping it in some ranch combined with the leftover hot sauce mixture in the pan it is definitely 5 stars! I used both provolone and pepper jack cheese. Both were great and I couldn't really tell a difference.Also, completely carb free and not too spicy (when usuing Louisiana hot sauce) for those of you who don't like real spicy.

This was a great quick and easy meal, but  I felt as though it was missing something. Will probably make again, with some tweaks.

I am not a big buffalo sauce girl, but this recipe turned out fantastic!!! The only complaint for me was that it was pretty salty. Also, I used shredded cheese (you can stuff more in there!). It makes it harder to roll, but totally worth it! Great recipe!

Love this stuff. Since I'm the only one in my house that likes buffalo chicken I only made one serving. I made extra sauce and used extra cheese and then put it on a green salad with peppercorn ranch dressing. This made me very happy.

My husband and I love buffalo wing sauce so this was right up our alley!!  It was good but not great.  I think next time I will take other advice and use blue cheese crumbles to give  it more zing.  The provolone can be a bit blah.

This meal was very easy to prepare. I let the chicken marinate for about 2 hours. I also had a problem with the sauce becoming very watery as it was baking. Next time I make this I'm thinking about adding some corn starch to the buffalo sauce and adding small amounts of the sauce every 10 minutes or so as the chicken bakes.

This was really good and easy.  I marinated the chicken for about 3 hours and added a little garlic powder. I used Monterey jack cheese which was very tasty.  I will make again.

This is a very simple dinner to make, yet still a big hit with my husband.  The first time I made it with hot sauce, which is what the recipe calls for.  This really didn't have that much flavor (besides just being hot).  Since then, I've been making it with buffalo wing sauce and we like this version a lot more!

We actually changed this recipe quite a bit, but it was delicious. We used Hooter's buffalo sauce. We cut up the chicken into strips, put it in the glass baking dish and poured the sauce (plus butter) over it and baked as directed. When it was done, we put the cheese on it and dipped in Ranch. It was really good, though next time I think we'll forgoe the butter.

Good! Nothing fancy, and we feel that the cheese is lost in the spicy chicken...will leave out the cheese next time...otherwise this was a healthy alternative wings.

Edible but certainly not tasty.  We love hot wings but this recipe was not as good as wings.  Chicken was dry and lacked much flavor.  I will not make this again- Sorry :(

this recipe was good, my boyfriend went crazy over it.  I didn't have any toothpicks, so i didn't roll them up, i just pounded them and laid the provalone to melt on top.  it was good and i would make it again.

Mmmmm.....really good.  I used mozzarella instead of provolone, and after uncovering it I basted it with more hot sauce for the last 5 minutes.  I found that there was a LOT of liquid in the dish when they were done, but it didn't affect the taste at all.

Very good although next time I will skip the broiling, as it dried out the chicken.  I used blue cheese crumbles for the cheese.

Really good and fairly easy to make. I put a more hot sauce on the chicken before baking rather than just the marinade. I am not a spicy food kind of person, but it needs more than just the marinade to keep the Chicken Wing taste.

I used mozzerella cheese because that was all I had.  The flavor of the chicken was wonderful.  Next time I will try with blue cheese and regardless of what kind of cheese I use, I may just flatten the chicken and instead of rolling it, just leave it flat and sprinkle the cheese on top as it leaked out any way.  But this recipe is a favorite already!

These were good for a different way to eat our favorite wing sauce.  I used chicken tenders (3-4 per person) and mozzarella cheese as that's what I had in the house.  The breasts would definitely be easier to work with, but I'm sure the flavor was basically the same.  Overall, I wasn't really excited by the recipe but it wasn't bad, either, so I'll give it three stars.

If you like buffalo wings, you will DEFINITELY like this recipe (plus, you get more meat than with wings)!  I didn't change a thing with this recipe - it was an EXCELLENT recipe. Will definitely make again, probably using a bit more of the cheese. I served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. Thanks for the great recipe!

I tried this and was very disappointed. How do you keep the cheese from melting away into the pan?? I was looking forward to cheesey chicken, but it ended up just being chicken.

Looking for something to satisfy my husband's low-carb diet and my low-points diet, I used this recipe to marinate "unpounded" chicken breasts overnight.  Then I baked them, sliced them and served them over a salad with blue cheese dressing for him and lite dressing for me. Everyone was happy.  I'll hang onto this one!

This was so easy and delicious.  My family loved it.  I've made it twice already.  The second time I didn't bother rolling them.  I just layered the chicken and cheese in the baking dish.  Worked the same and was less messy than trying to roll them.  Thanks for a quick delish meal!

Liked this a lot.  Since we are blue cheese lovers, I used blue cheese crumbles instead of provolone.  Didn't find the need for serving with blue cheese dressing.  The amount of heat from the Frank's Wing Sauce was perfect for our taste.  Will be making this again.

Very tasty and quick to whip up. I served them over a bed of mashed potatoes that I mixed 1/2 a packet of ranch seasoning and a bit of sour cream into. It made for a nice contrast. My only suggestion is that you sprinkle a bit of the provolone on top of each roll prior to removing from the oven. Much of what you put on the inside melts out while baking.

I love blue cheese, so I just stuffed the chicken with that. I didn't marinate the chicken in the sauce to cut down on the heat a bit (sometimes it doesn't sit so well with my husband). It still had good flavor from just pouring the sauce over it before baking.

Loved these!  I'm always trying to find ideas for chicken that my fiancee will enjoy (he's not a fan of chicken, but loves chicken wings.)  I used swiss cheese (all I had) and it tasted great.  We both loved it, so I know I will be making them again soon!

Loved it! The only thing I did different was instead of rolling up the chicken, I just layed it flat on a baking sheet and put the cheese on top during the last 5 min of baking.  We had ranch for dipping sauce and it tasted just like hot wings!  I will definitely be making this again!

My sons really liked this recipe. Only reason I'm giving it a 4 is, like other posters mentioned, it's not spicy enough. I'll add cayenne to it next time and it'll probably be a 5. Thanks for sharing!

I love buffalo wings but this was not a near comparison in my book. I thought for sure that with it being so highly rated it would be a hit, but I found it dry and just bland.

I made this for our Super Bowl Party. What a Hit! They were better than the wings. Like other reviewers, I didn't have shredded Provolone, just sliced. It made it a little harder to roll but still delicious. We had a few left over, and they were great the next day as well.

This was so delicious. I used mozzerella chz instead bc I like that better. I also placed the rolls of ck back into the marinade and cooked it covered in the juices. That last 10min or so I broiled it to make the top brown and then placed a piece of mozzerella on top until it melted. I used the juices and a bit of blue cheese as dip. This is one of my and my boyfriend's new favorites!!!

I absolutely love buffalo anything. These were good...very moist. However, I wish the hot sauce held to the chicken more. I had to use the mixture left in the pan for dipping. Very good and will try to make again, I just wish the hot sauce adhered more to the chicken.

This was good but nothing fantastic.  It just tastes like hot sauce covered chicken with a little bit of cheese.  I probably wont make this again just because I have a lot better recipes for stuffed chicken breasts with more flavor.  Hot sauce and butter is better if your making chicken wings.  It doesnt exactly coat chicken breast well, which results in it running off and making a runny mess while cooking.  This is a good start to a buffalo chicken recipe, but I think if its going to be coating the chicken it needs to be a heavier sauce with more flavor or the chicken needs to be breaded for it to coat.

This recipe was amazing....my husband actually moaned while eating it....it would be a great dish for company as you can make it ahead of time.  I opted for both provolone and crumbled bleu cheese in the middle...it gave it a little more kick!  Wonderful!

I thought this was kind of bland and too watery.  Next time I'll try not rolling the chicken and using a buffalo wing sauce instead of hot sauce.

Took advice and didn't roll them. I thought they were good. I used pepper jack cheese and drained the sauce. It was way too runny. Served with ranch dressing. I love spicy food so I added crushed red pepper and pepper jack cheese to give it more of a kick.

This was so yummy! I substituted a mixture of softened cream cheese and crumbled bleu cheese for the provolone, and served with bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks. The "buffalo" flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked, but I'm a wing fanatic, so next time I'll either marinate longer or do as one reviewer suggested and hit 'em with extra hot sauce during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Just like everyone else, my cheese leaked out into the pan, but we just spooned some of the cheesy buffalo sauce pan juices on top of the finished chicken and it was still great. I might try not rolling them next time, just laying them flat in the pan and topping with the cheese mixture, maybe that will retain the cheese a little better. Still, an awesome dinner for two buffalo wing lovers! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really easy and the chicken turned out very tender.  I cooked it for another 5-6 minutes uncovered though instead of using the broiler and I melted more provolone on top.  Next time I think I'll use blue cheese though to give it more bite!

I combined this with another recipe on the site. Flattened chicken, laid cheese inside, poured wing sauce all over and cooked in oven for 20 minutes. My hubby loved it! Careful, it's spicy.

I go ahead and add Ranch dressing to the hot sauce mix, and use whatever white cheese we have on hand. An insanely easy dish to make, and much more heart healthy than going out for (fried) wings!

very tasty.  It was a little too much hot sauce for me but My husband LOVED it!  I would rather make them into smaller little bite sized ones and serve them for an appetizer.   Still a very good recipe

This was great! I used a little less hot sauce because the one that we had was more like a paste. After the chicken browned for a little while I put the extra cheese on the chicken and left it in the oven until the cheese melted since some of the cheese melted out of the chicken. Will be a regular in our house. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was wonderful and quick and easy.  I eliminated the butter and added diced bannana peppers with the cheese.  I'm a huge blue cheese fan so I made mine with blue cheese and my husbands with provolone.  He declared it his official new favorite

In our house, my husband does the dishes when I make a difficult meal.  After dinner he started right in on the dishes without even asking!  Little does he know that this is one of the easiest meals to cook!

The only problem I had was keeping the cheese in the chicken.  I used 1/4 inch (or so) slices of monterey jack.  It seeped out but was easy to scoop up and put in or on the chicken rolls.  Any suggestions?

I gave these a try for dinner since my boyfriend is on a low-carb diet.  I used both provolone and mozzarella (just my preference).  I really wasn't all that impressed with the final result.  The preparing and cooking was very easy and although some of the cheese did seep out, it was still usable.  I didn't think these were bad, just not as great as others raved about.  We are big buffalo wing fans and were hoping for the same result, these were close, but not the same.  Personally, I would only rate them three stars, boyfriend says four stars, and since this was for him, his rating wins. :)

I thought these were great!  I made them with crumbled blue cheese instead of provolone.  Next time I may just lay them flat in the baking dish and sprinkle the cheese on top, but I will definately make these again!  Thanks!

My family loved this recipe.  My computer was down on the day I decided to make it, so I had to depend on my memory to get me through.  I used way too much hot sauce to marinate the chicken in, and the vinegar from the sauce began to "cook" the chicken almost immediatly.  But the flavor was wonderful!

This was so delicious!  I marinated the chicken overnight!  I served it with a salad and light Bleu cheese dressing.  The Provolone cheese is a great flavor sensation with the Buffalo sauce.  YUM!

**Just wanted to add that I made it again, and this time I substituted low-fat Ken's Italian dressing for the butter.  It was very good as well!!

My hubby loves the buffalo chicken pizza off this site so I knew this one would be a hit too!!! I cut down to two chicken breasts but should have made more! I served with a side of blue cheese and curly fries. Very easy and very good!!! Try this one!!
