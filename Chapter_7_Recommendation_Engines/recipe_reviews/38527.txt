Great recipe! I used it to marinade and cook venison steaks they turned out great. But I recc. low sodium soy sauce because it was a little to salty.

This is restaurant quality teriyaki sauce.  Mirin is not available in my area, so I used 1 1/2 cups Holland House White Cooking White and 6 tsp of sugar as a substitute. 

Marinate the meat a maximum of 6 hours.

i used all natural sweet soy sauce, which has a consistency similar to oyster sauce, but everything else was the same, came out perfect.

Just wonderful. This is nice and tangy/sweet. I only needed aboit 2.5 Tbsp of sugar. It thickens upon cooling. Thank you for the recipe.
