I love the simplicity of this recipe, and it is a good, basic chicken dish, but when the family mixed it in with the rice pilaf I made, they loved it.

I used peas, added cream cheese for the cheddar and put slices of Colby jack on the top.  It was delicious!  Definite comfort food for a cold winter meal.  Very rich.

It was good. I didn't have any milk so I used water. Substituted peas for the corn. My four year loved it and my one year old ate three helpings. It was definitely a winner. Thanks for the recipe!
