I'm an admitted peanut butter addict and love to find new ways to eat the stuff and boy was this good!  Sometimes the simplest things in life turn out to be some of the best and this was no exception.  There's nothing like a classic pb&j sandwich, but once you get the peanut butter nice and melty and add some oohey, gooey marshmallow cream - well you have yourself a nice little treat. If you love peanut butter and jelly sanwiches give this a try, you'll be glad you did.  Definitely have an ice cold glass of milk handy...

A grilled pb&j can only be made better by the addition of marshmallow creme. I'd forgotten how good these are! They really are more like a dessert than anything else, but oh, the memories of the lunch before heading back to the pool in summer as a kid! Thanks for the memories! (Be sure to use white bread for best effect!)

This is my recipe, and  my kids absolute favorite thing to eat.  These can be messy, so make sure you have napkins nearby!  Tip: Don't cut the sandwiches - they are much less messy when left whole.  These are also wonderful without the jelly, and a little less messy too.  Don't pile on the ingredients - just a little of everything is enough once cooked!

I made this sandwich while camping with just peanut butter and torn up marshmallows on cinnamon raisin bread.  I used Pam to spray the bread in the frying pan.  This was simply delicious and tasted like dessert for dinner!

I love these... ALWAYS a hit with the kids! I leave out the marshmallow creme, though. Too sweet for me.

I couldn't finish it - too sweet.  That's saying a lot considering I have a major sweet tooth.
