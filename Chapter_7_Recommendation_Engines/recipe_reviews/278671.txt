Amazing! This was my first time making a proper dashi broth, but definitely not the last. Perfect appetizer for a Valentineâ€™s Day dinner. I definitely got a ton of ...compliments... Thanks Chef John!

Savory, sweet, and very sexy.  I added mirin, soy sauce,  and rice wine vinegar to the broth.

I made this for a special dinner. It worked out great. The flavor was amazing.
And, by the way, I learned why my dashi never quite met expectations. All these years I have been way too skimpy adding the bonito flakes. That problem is now solved. My family can now enjoy a proper serving of dashi and miso soup.
So glad I tried this!
