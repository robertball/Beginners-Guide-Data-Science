Very easy and very good! What more could you ask for from three little ingredients that you have around the house? It's slightly sweet with a nice hint of orange. It's a great way to perk up bagels, biscuits, scones or toast. But, I could definitely see many uses for this - over pancakes, waffles, muffins or thick slices of warm pumpkin or cranberry breads.

Fresh tasting, light citrusy taste and pleasantly sweet.  Pretty too, with its pale yellow color and flecks of orange zest. I know it will be good on a lot of things - toast, biscuits, even pancakes - but tonight it was wonderful slathered on a warmed slice of pumpkin bread. Nice treat!

I really enjoyed this butter. I was looking for something to make my homemade bread a little more special and this worked fabulous!  I did add a little more honey for more sweetness. I love the orange flavoring!

Very good.  I did add just a little more honey to make it a little sweeter.  We ate this on muffins for breakfast...thanks for something a little different.

This was delicious and very easy to make. After mixing, place it in the fridge for about 5 minutes to firm up a little bit. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very nice. I added a little more honey, but the orange zest was just right for us. Wonderful on toasted English muffins. Thanks!

I used agave syrup instead of the honey, and my family thought it was too sweet.  I loved it!  It was a nice flavored butter to put on pancakes!

This was good. Mild taste. Easy to fix. however, I had another recipe that came with some sour cream biscuits that I was making and it turned out far better tasting. If I hadn't done both to compare I would have been perfectly happy with this recipe, but as it is the other one was the winner. Thanks, this was good on my biscuits.

I made it exactly as directed. It was OK. Not great, not bad. Could use more honey.

Loved it!  This is a nicely, sweetened butter with a pretty orange tint.  Loved that it had the hint of citrus taste without overpowering.  We had it with 'Sweet Dinner Rolls' from AR and used the leftovers on pancakes and waffles.  I don't usually make flavored butters, unless I have company, but this is a nice one to have in the fridge.

Very good sweet butter.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the orange rind.  This goes well with biscuits.  I served it as an after thought with some friends and they all loved it!
