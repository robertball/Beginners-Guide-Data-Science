I substituted olive oil, green peppers, and vegetable broth. Added a tablespoon of each of mined garlic and onion for more flavor. Very good recipe. Will make again! Thanks for sharing this great recipe! Cheers

If you cook rice frequently like I do, you know that just by looking at this recipe there is way too much liquid for 1 cup of rice. You need to keep in mind that aside from the 2 cups of chicken broth, you are adding 1 can of green chiles, which adds to the liquid to rice ratio. I made this with all the ingredients except I added and extra 1/2 cup of rice to absorb the extra liquids and it was perfect!  of course, if you like sticky rice, then leave the recipe as is.

This had pretty good flavor.  I erred on the side of caution and only used 1/2 tsp of pepper, which for me was perfect.  The chilies are a nice touch. The rice did turn out kinda sticky and mushy, and I even rinsed my rice before I started (something I always do to get rid of starch).  I think the added moisture from the chilies contributed to the wetness of the rice, and I had even removed excess liquid from chilies.  If I make this again, I'll definitely cut back on the chicken broth (probably use 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups instead of 2) and cook for less time (15 mins or so). An easy way to kick up plain rice!

Perfect, easy side dish.  Others suggested adding onion, salt, and garlic.  I was trying to save time and opted to add 1 Tbsp dried chopped onion, and 1 tsp garlic salt.  I halved the amount of black pepper the recipe called for and was very pleased with the outcome and will use those same substitutions again.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

For the first time in my life I cooked rice correctly using this recipe! Making rice seems easy but it actually takes some getting used to for it to come out good. My rice usually is very sticky, gooey, broken and tastes bland. This recipe the rice stays together, and comes out fluffy and perfect! So glad I found this recipe. I will use this from now on. Thanks for the great recipe!

AMAZING! I love this rice. My husband couldn't get enough of it. Followed the recipe only thing I did different was add more chilies and ground pepper. Other then that it was perfect. I paired this rice with sweet hot mustard chicken thighs (recipe from this site chef john) and with cornbread casserole from this site as well. Will be making again soon.

I added some onion and garlic as was suggested by another reviewer (and because I think onions and garlic make everything better).  We loved it!  I had brown rice in my cupboard so I used that, and it seemed to take forever to cook, but it was worth the wait!  Also, instead of chicken broth, I've been using Better Than Bullion to make my own broth.  It  adds a lot more flavor than regular canned chicken broth.  Great stuff!!

This was an excellent recipe./  Family liked it and I will make it again.  Made no changes but may try adding onion and garlic next time.  Always looking for new ways to do rice.

It was okay.  Not as flavorful as I had hoped.  But it maybe that I did not get the spiciest of chilies.  I will try again.

I loved this rice, I didn't have fresh chillis so I substituted 1 teaspoon of Very Lazy chillies.
Nice and spicy very sticky with lots of flavour, it needed more water during cooking.
I will be making this again!

We didn't love this rice.  It was OK and had a nice kick, but needed some additional flavor.  If I make it again I may add garlic and/or onion.

The effort/taste ratio on this was good. My family of 6 all enjoyed it. I did do a couple of things. I usually rinse my rice remove excess starch, but knowing I needed to brown the rice, I did *not*. Fry rice dry & you'll get a better result 100% of the time. To try and be a bit healthier, I've mixed white and brown rice in a pail. This made it a little harder to tell when my rice was browned, but no big deal. Where I noticed this was an issue was at the end, when my brown rice was still a little crunchy. I wasn't thinking; I knew this & should've added a little more water in the first place. I threw in more water & let it cook a few more mins. Turned out fine. I also threw in about a 1/4 cup of onions to partially sauté in the oil first, then the rice, & then a clove of garlic (so it didn't burn). Canned chilies have a little moisture in them, so I waited for my rice to brown a bit before adding them. When I did, I pushed the rice to one side of the pan, dropped the chilies in the other & waited for the moisture to cook off a bit before incorporating them. I only used half a tsp. of pepper, because a whole tsp. seemed like an awful lot. Figured if people wanted more they could add it in after. Glad I did! My hubby (who loves spice) said it wouldn't have been palatable if I'd added it all. To me it needed a little more salt but I just added it once it was on my plate.

This rice was great for what I needed to pair it with, other than that it is a bit one dimensional. If you want to bring an extra level of flavoring to the rice, during the browning period add a 1/4 to a 1/2 of limes juice. To me, it added the extra flavor that the rice was missing. Other than that, if you want a backdrop rice dish that you want to support rather than shine, this recipe will do great.

The spicy chilies made the dish tasty. Might add one small can of tomato sauce to give more flavor. It’s a winner either way!

I substituted olive oil and sauteed about 3/4 cup chopped onion with the rice.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric to add flavor and color.  It came out really well and was not sticky at all.

I made this tonight and it was just a little flat tasting.  I could doctor it up but what's the point.  I'll just keep making my sister's rice that her Mexican mother-in-law taught her to make.
