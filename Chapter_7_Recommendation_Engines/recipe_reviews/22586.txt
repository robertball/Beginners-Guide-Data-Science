Confession -- my dh cheated and used (gasp!) a BOX MIX for the cake part.  Still quite tasty.  THe decorating was fun for him.  Use Reese Sticks for the goal posts.  Licorice just seemed impossible without even knowing others had tried it... that stuff won't hold a shape!  The chocolate Reese sticks hold together fairly well.  DH used one long stick, topped by a sideways-long stick, then a half-stick on each end to make the post, and this worked well.  A dab of icing at the joints helps, too.  And dh used gold-foil-wrapped mini Reese cups for the goal post holders, and stuck a toothpick down through them for stability.  THe tiny tip of toothpick sticking through the top and bottom help secure this to the cake and to the Reese stick goal post.  One last suggestion:  a 1st down marker (2 toothpicks and a string), a score board (dh was out of control!), and Hershey kiss cheerleaders (dh had them stacked in a little pyramid, in their foil wrappers, with the little "kiss' paper representing a pom-pom, I guess!)  Dh also had a "bench" on each side of field (another Reese stick) with benched players.  And two choc chips, stuck together at the fat ends, made a super football.  THis cake was fun to watch him prepare, because HE DOESN"T BAKE.  I guess the theme just inspired him!

I just made this cake for my son's 5th birthday. It turned out sooooooo incredibly cute, not to mention delicious. I'm planning on making another one for my Super Bowl get together.

I have the secret on how to bend the goal post (thanks to my husband!).  Pull the licorice in the microwave 6-8 secs.  The licorice will be soft, then you form the goal posts & let it set for 10-15 minutes.  If you microwave too long the licorice will be really hard and unable to eat.  I had lots of fun with this receipe, even my husband joined in on the decorating.  I also used Raiders & Bucs in the endzone.  Great Receipe!

Okay, I'm the biggest cheater! I've been so busy preparing other dishes for the annual superbowl bash that making a cake from scratch is what I PREFER but do not have much time for...thus, I used a boxed chocolate cake mix. BUT, I followed the decorating instructions and the cake looks sooo cute. No one will want to eat it tommorrow! I'm sure that the cake-from-scratch portion of this recipe will taste just as good (if not better) than any boxed version but the idea is the coolest! I'm not a huge football fan but with the Reeces, we spelled "Raiders" and "Bucks" in each endzone. As usual, thanks Hersheys for the great idea!

This is so much fun to make--and even more fun to show off!  I brought it to a SuperBowl party for our church youth group and they used it as a centerpiece.  They even took my picture with it for the church bulletin board!  The goalposts are the hardest thing about this cake.  I had to shape them with broken toothpicks, but that worked quite well.  My husband enjoyed putting the "players" on the field in official football formations!

Made for the Superbowl and was a big hit!  Cake tasted great and everyone loved the decorating.  Two things:  The frosting doesn't come out the right color, more pastel but still okay and next time I will melt chocolate and pipe the goal posts because the twizzlers did not work.  Still, a very fun and festive cake!

If you have the time, this cake is really great. You will not believe how well received it will be at parties. You will be the hit! Definitely go with boxed cake mix to save time! And yeah, the goal posts are impossible. I too would suggest broken toothpicks, or even take some cutters to a wire hanger. That worked perfectly. Just make sure no one bites into them... good luck with this cake and have a great SuperBowl!

The cake itself was truly awesome.  It's super moist and would be great even without frosting, if you wanted to use it in another recipe. I gave it only a four star rating because of the cost(all those candies add up quick), but mostly because I think that Hershey's Kitchens should let us know exactly how they got those licorice goal posts to stand up.  I even tried "Red Vines" to no avail.  It was all fine in the end and my hubby loved his birthday/Super Bowl cake.  Also, I'd like to mention a few other things, I purchased a disposable pan but was unable to find the exact size that was called for.  My pan was a bit bigger so I doubled the cake and that was just what it needed, otherwise once it was baked it wouldn't have been up high  enough in the pan to look like a football field.  I got a little creative and decided to decorate the end zones to say "RAIDERS" (with white frosting and reg. chocolate chips) and "BUCS" (with red frosting and white chocolate chips.)  Either way you decide to do it, it's sure to taste great and be alot of fun to decorate.  By the way my husband was surprised that I knew where exactly to put the players.  I'll never tell ;-)!!!

I think I probably cheated the worst on this cake.  I usually bake from scratch, but figured since I would be putting the effort to decorate, Id just make a box.  Used 1 1/2 cans of frosting.  Baked the cake in a 9x13.  Instead of using white chocolate chips to write and make yard lines, I used white frosting and piped with a pastry bag.  Instead of ripping my hair out with the licorice, I took the safe route and used kit kats.  Glued two kit kats together for the goal post stand, then a whole kit kat on top, and two half kit kats for the uprights.  Also, made this as a birthday cake, so in the Endzones I wrote "Happy" and "Birthday" and midfield wrote out the name.  Everyone ooohed and awwwed over my cake.  Thanks so much for this recipe that really wasn't as difficult as I was afraid of(even though I did cheat A LOT)

This cake was a hit for a 12 yr old birthday party! I used a regular cake mix & I do agree it gets alittle pricey with all the little candies.For the goal post I used flexible straws.I cut them down & made one the post to stand in the cake & 2 with flexible corners as the top fitting one side end inside the other.Then I cut a slit on the top of the post then hot glued very gently the top to the post. I then laid it on a flat surface to cool & it worked great. I would make this cake again.

This was a hit at the superbowl party I went to. However, I had to resize the cake for just 8 people - things looked a little crowded.  Also, buying all the candy that decorates this cake makes it an expensive venture.

I made this for a superbowl party last weekend.  The cake came out really well and looked great with all the candy.  I agree with everyone else...the licorice doesn't stay bent well. Other than that, it was a hit.

My husband and son and I had a great time decorating this cake.  The comments about the goal posts are all well taken.  We ended up "sticking" the twizzlers on the cake itelf, after getting frustrated with them.  The cake was really moist and it stayed that way for almost a week.  (We nibbled on it a little each day).  This will be a staple at our parties each year.

The cake wasn't that difficult to make, but it took a while to get all the candy decorations on.  My only complaint was using licorice for the goal post.  I couldn't figure out how anyone could shape it properly and make it stay up there.  Besides that, everyone thought the cake was adorable.

SUPER CUTE!!!!  However, be warned this is not a easy cake, you will need a lot of patience and time to get it ready.  Plus, be prepared to spend a small fortune on candy, unless you are able to track down smaller sized bags (like you'd give to a child as a gift).  Was a huge hit at the Superbowl party.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the time commitment was a bit more than I would have liked.  Oh, I didn't get the hints to make the goal posts work, so I used kit-kats on the rolos..... : )

I cheated, too, and used a box chocolate cake mix to save some time and effort.  After all, the decoration takes forever.  It's worth it, though.  I used more icing than in the recipe, but my family likes icing.  I also substituted for the Twizzlers with Kit Kats stacked on the Rolos and held together with peanut butter.  It kept falling over, but worked out well enough.  Also, the icing colors don't come out as dark as in the picture.  We had a gathering and everyone said it "looked too good to eat."  Trust me, though, it got eaten.

What a hit!  I'm giving it 5 stars for the decorating idea because I didn't make the cake.  I cheated by ordering 1/2 a sheet cake and asked them to ice it in light green to save me some time.  My husband wanted to help so we decided to use Rolos and Reeses so that he could write the numbers of the players on them.  We turned the Rolos upside down so there was more room for the numbers.  I made the football out of two choc chips held together with icing and placed the ball on Donovan.  I sprinkled some green crystal-like sprinkles in the end zones then wrote Eagles in green and Patriots in red. I couldn't figure out the Kit Kat OR the Twizzler goal posts but used another person's idea and melted choc chips, put in ziploc, cut off tip and "draw" goal posts on wax paper and freeze.  I didn't put them in the cake until ready to serve.  It looked awesome!

Easy enough at the beginning, I used a cake mix instead of making it from scratch, but the decorations were so intricate for me! Mine definitly did not turn out like the perfect picture and I missed a whole quarter of the super bowl decorating this cake. It was really cute though and my family enjoyed the little candies as players. Takes a long time, but if you have the time, definitly go for it.

I made this for our annual superbowl party, and everyone loved it.  It was fun and easy to make with the exception of the licorice field goal posts.  I had to put toothpicks in them to make them stay up.

Absolutely Darling Idea - Thank You! Since we are rooting for the Steelers it was so simple to do the Black and Gold theme. We just used our own cake mix and did our own thing on the candy pieces. I have to confess, I didn't attempt the goal posts! Thanks for the 5 star idea!

Made it for our Superbowl party -- everyone loved the look of it! Cake was very moist. Takes awhile to decorate but the overlook was terrific. Goal post idea needs help, I ended up using thin wire to position them making them unable to be eaten, then had trouble getting them to stick to the Rolo candy - frosting didn't hold. Overall -- I would definetly make it again!

Yum! Plus, the decorations are so cute and fun!  
1)After I made the cake (I used a box mix plus some other stuff) I flipped it over so I could use the flat bottom as a better surface 2)I saved about 1/2 cup of the white icing and set aside, 1/3 cup of frosting in each endzone was a little too much 3)Instead of buying all those Reeses, u can go on your computer and print out a big letter of your team (aka P for Panthers), cut it out like a stencil and gently place it over the endzone frosting, then use powdered sugar or sprinkles to dust on top of the letter and remove the paper (make sure not 2 totally cover the letter in heaps of sugar/sprinkles as they go every where when you lift off the paper), the imprint of your team will now b on the frosting

I used this in my office for our Superbowl Party and everyone loved it.  I did use a box cake mix instead of making one from scratch.  Instead of using the hershey's kisses and peanut butter cups, I used blue M&Ms (Panthers) and red M&Ms (Patriots).  I also used coconut for the yard lines instead of white choc. chips.  I was able to find goal posts at a local party store.  Everything turned out great!! Thanks for the idea!!

I made this cake for Super Bowl weekend, and everyone loved it!  I used boxed cake mix to save time, and I cut down on the cost by using piped frosting for both the lettering and yard lines.  Like many of the other reviewers, I used Kit Kats instead of Twizzlers on the goal posts (much easier to handle).  This cake was a HUGE hit, and everyone had fun nibbling on their favorite teams!  A fantastic recipe idea!

Great recipe!! It was the hit of my Super Bowl party.  It did take a bit of time to decorate, but it was worth it. I too used Kit Kats for the goal posts--worked great. I found it easier to use mini m&ms to spell out the team names--Reese's pieces are too big. My football fanatic 10 year old has requested this cake for his birthday. Thanks for the great idea!!

Excellent cake! Very moist and tasty.
I cheated a little and used frosting to make the lines (as opposed to choc.chips). They were not as straight and perfect as they would have been had I followed the recipe exactly. I just stuck a couple KitKat sections in the cake for the uprights (didn't have time to fiddle with licorice) Otherwise, a great hit at the Superbowl party!

This cake was so much fun to make. The decorations were a little time consuming but, that was half the fun! The only thing we had a hard time with was the "Twizzler" goal posts-we couldn't get them to stay up (anyone have another idea??) It was a huge hit at the party there wasn't a piece left.

This cake was a huge hit for a birthday party!!  Instead of the Twizzler goal post idea, I melted some chocolate chips and spooned the melted chocolate into a Ziploc bag.  I let it stiffen up for a few minutes and snipped off a pretty good sized edge of the bag.  Then I piped the shape of "thick" goal posts on wax paper lined baking sheet.  I made 4 just in case.  Pop these in the freezer for a half hour and peel off the wax paper for perfect goal posts that you can stick into the cake.

This cake was good. It is a cute idea.  I had trouble with the goal posts though even after freezing them because once they started to get at room temp, they started to fall.  Also, it was hard to spell out the teams with the reeses, I would maybe try mini m and m's next time.  Otherwise, fun recipe.

This was so fun to make! You can really personalize it and do things that work best for you. I made the goal posts out of melted hershey kisses that I piped through a ziploc and froze, it worked perfect! I couldn't find the right size cake pan so I ended up using 2 box cake mixes together in a disposable turkey pan, that worked out perfect as well! So fun!

This was an impressive super bowl cake,although it took longer to decorate than I had anticipated.  I decided that it would look better if you didn't see the pan, so I baked three 8x8 layers and cut one in half to put alongside the first two so my field was 12x16.  I frosted the cake green except for the endzones which I did in the team's colors.  I had problems with that dreaded goal post, so I bought plastic ones from a cake decorating store. A lot of work, but worth it, especially when your team wins!
