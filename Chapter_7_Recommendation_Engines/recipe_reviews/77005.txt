I always cringed whenever I heard we were having lamb for dinner - I hated lamb - period - so I avoided eating it at all costs while growing up and well into my adult life.  However, my husband loves it so I decided to give it a try.  I found this recipe right here online and gave it a go.  I ABSOLUTELY  loved it.  LOVED it!  The recipe was fabulous (although I added plenty more garlic to mine).  I took this photo of my first ever pride and joy lamb roast and have served it to guests three times now.  They all raved about how delicious, juicy and tender it was.  So, I thought I'd share my photo with all of you.   I threw the potatoes and carrots in just to add some color to the photo.  Enjoy!

I followed the directions perfectly. This recipe turned out to be an excellent way to ruin a good piece of meat from my favorite butcher. It turned out tasting like chicken liver.

A wonderful dish!  Even the kids liked it.  I rubbed the "gloop" into the meat the night before and it was wonderful.  A great preparation for even a cheap cut of lamb (I was using a leg from Sam's club so not the best quality and this recipe made it taste like $15 a pound lamb!)  Tender and juicy - the searing keeps the juices in.  I served it with new potatoes and asparagus and got rave reviews from my picky crowd.

I prepared the recipe according to the directions and ended up enjoying it very much.  The lemon juice / broth mixture lightened the earthy taste of the lamb, which some in my family find overpowering.

I made this few days ago, it was the best leg of lamb I have ever had, and I have been eating lamb all my life.  My whole family loved it, they said it was very flavorful. I used a whole head of garlic because we all love garlic, and also threw in some baby yellow, red, and purple potatoes, and some parsnip in the bottom of the pan they absorbed  some of the juice and so much flavor from the roast.  Great recipe, I will deffinetly make again and again.  Thank you... I give it five stars

Absolutely delicious!  I was fearful that the rub was going to be too salty, but I followed the recipe exactly.  Since my roast was smaller, I used only half of the rub.  I cooked to 145 degrees, and it was perfect!  We will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty. My guests loved it. I seared the lamb on the BBQ then roasted it in the BBQ with the hood down. Very easy.

This lamb recipe is great.  I did the seasoning mixture as directed except for adding more garlic.  I pierced the lamb several times and rubbed the blend into the cuts in hopes of getting the flavor to permeate better as per another reviewer's observations.  In the end the cumin wasn't overbearing at all and the flavors went nicely with the meat.  It was salty and savory but not overly so.  My range's broiler is broken, so I had to modify the cooking a little, but it wound up taking less time.  (I used 'bake' at 550F for 8 min/ side in place of broiling and then turned the temp down to 325F.  My meat thermometer said it was done after only 30 minutes, but I was using a somewhat smaller leg- just shy of 4lb instead of 4-1/2 to 5 lb.)

I make this once a year for my husband.  We all love it!  Even his sister loved this recipe, and she's pretty picky.  It is easy and quick.  Just make sure not to broil for too long.

The lamb was tender and I loved the coating the spices gave, just wish their flavours sunk into the lamb a little more.  Maybe if small cuts were made into the meat and the spice mix was stuffed in.  All in all it was lovely lamb.

I didn't cook this recipe, another person did at the food bank that I work in; for our soup kitchen on Friday. I have eaten leg of lamb, lamb chops, and lamb all of my life at excellent 5 star restaurants and this recipe was delicious. She prepared 4 legs and served over 40 people lunch (which included homemade rice pilaf and a carrot, parsnip, onion vegetable dish with a Dijon butter sauce as accompaniments) and there were only 2 people who didn't like it and they don't like lamb to begin with, there were no leftovers and some of our volunteers didn't eat because we wanted to make sure that all the people who came in could eat.... This recipe is so great that I ran out and bought 2 boneless lamb legs and they are dinner for Sunday night. I do admit that I made a huge mistake and forgot the garlic in the paste-rub. I adore garlic and even have minced garlic in the fridge, I just got so excited that I did everything but that....anyway, I'll let you know how it turns out. 140 degrees will get you a nicely rare leg, don't go to much higher because at 150 it's over done and can taste like leather....  By the way, I like my lamb with a touch of mint jelly, if you can find it, but this is so good that you don't even have to have it.   Thank you for an amazing recipe.

First effort at making lamb. Came out great! Only had a 2 pound boneless, butterflied leg of lamb and didn't know I should try to remove all fat. Followed recipe as given but since I had a smaller cut of meat - next time I would half the oil and lemon so would have made more of a paste. I liked the intense flavor and meat was moist. The optional fresh minced mint as garnish was good on top of it too.

Excellent recipie!  Made this for the first time for guests we were having for dinner and it was the hit of the dinner! Flavor was wonderful- cumin/garlic crust was amazing!  Definitely will make again.  I served with roasted color peppers, eggplant, onion, and carrots sprinkled with fresh herbs at end.  Couscous on the side.  Also had a yogurt, cucumber, dill, mint, garlic dip on the side which was nice compliment.

Perfect cooking approach although I shortened broil time to 6 min per side for my 1.5 lb piece of butterflied meat.  Had cooking probe and
time to 140 was only 20-25min. Will try again with simpler marinade or seasoning or maybe yogurt.

I added some stock to the baking pan so that the lamb didn't dry out too much during the long cook. Turned out beautifully. Great flavours and so easy for a big group.

Made this recipe for Easter yesterday. Didn't add the cumin as I am not too fond of the spice and broiled for about 25 minutes total (but I like my meat blackened). Turned out excellent!

This is the first time I have ever made lamb. I followed the directions and it came out perfect! I didn't have a meat thermometer, so I cut the meat to check, and left in the oven until it was pink in the center (my piece was slightly larger, so it took about 1 hour and 30 minutes to cook). This was super delicious, will definitely make it again!

When I first saw this recipe that called for Cumin I was intrigued. An avid lamb lover, both my husband and I were looking for a new "spice" combination and this was just what we were looking for. I only used half of the amount of cumin, and was very glad I did, as I think 2 tablespoons would have over powered the flavour of the meat. For those who dont really appreciate the gaminess of lamb, then go for the full amount. The next time I prepare this recipe, I will use half the amount of salt, as I found it to be too much. Overall though, it was a great recipe!

Oh my goodness this was delicious. I am a seasoned cook and this is the best recipe for a butterflied lamb leg. I usually cook a butterflied lamb leg on my grille. Since we are out of grilling season I opted to cook it in my oven. I was a little nervous about the rub but it turned out to be a winner. Followed the recipe exactly which I usually do first time out. It came out perfect. Very flavorful. Hubs raved and stated this is a keeper! I opted to sprinkle parsley along with the lemon juice over the meat which made for a very attractive presentation.

This is just fabulous! I am going to try this paste on other proteins. I will try it on chicken maybe using some rosemary. Be careful not to overcook your lamb. I got the last butterflied leg and it was smaller than this recipe specified. So do check the temp after 30 minutes and stop it at 140 deg. This helped to make our Easter dinner a huge success. Thank you Allrecipes!

Everyone loved this--even people who don't normally like lamb. The cumin is strong enough to hide any foreign lamb flavor that those new to lamb might not like. It is important to start broiling with the fat side down--lots of flames if you don't! I broiled it & roasted mine for less time than called for. Watch it carefully so that it's not overdone.

I enjoyed it! I used recipe on s lamb leg roast, it was saltier than I expected but still delicious. I will just modify the amount of salt next time. It was easy to make and I will be making again for my family to feast!

I also cut up some potatoes into small chunks and added them to the bottom of the roasting pan with some extra marinade.  After I took the roast out and let it rest, I put the potatoes back in and upped the oven temp to 450 for about 15 minutes - they were delicious!

This was easy and tasty. After reading the other reviews, I did shorten the broil time,  and the roasting time was considerably less also, so it was done much earlier than expected. It still had good flavor but was not at moist as I expected.

This was a great recipe!  Was a little uncertain of all the cumin so I went easy on it.  Very tasty!  I added wilted mustard greens sauteed with onions garlic dash of balsamic and dijon mustard. Put in middle of Lamb and rolled it up. Tricky to net and toothpick in place but so worth it!.  Added small white potatoes to pan and roasted. Great meal.
