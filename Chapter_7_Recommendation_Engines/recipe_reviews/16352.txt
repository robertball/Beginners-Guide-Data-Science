I read almost all of the 400+ reviews and made modifications based on them.  To save everyone else some time, here's what they say to do (and what I did...and it came out great):  (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.  I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted others and I think it helped.  Great slow-cooker recipe.  I froze the leftovers (egg noodles and all) in my Seal-a-Meal and then just boiled the bag to reheat.  It was great the second time around!

I think i made it through about 900 reviews until i started to get a headache :) I cant stand having to go through dozens of pages of reviews to find the "5 star " version of the recipe! I am going to make this short and sweet.  The recipe that is posted originally is really only a 1 star meal.  After all the adjustments, substitutions, etc .. its 5 star fabulous.  I have taken all the suggestions and advice from all the reviews and created this:
 
INGREDIENTS
2 pound cubed beef stew meat or chuck roast 
2 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup 
3/4 cup chopped onion 
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
1/4 cup water (more if needed) 
1/4 cup low sodium beef stock (more if needed) 
1/3 cup sour cream 
2 ounces cream cheese (reduced fat works well) 
1/2 pack French onion soup mix 
Salt and pepper, to taste 
3 cloves garlic, minced 
8oz. mushrooms, sliced 
Pat of butter 

DIRECTIONS
1. In slow cooker, combine meat, mushroom soup, chopped onions, minced garlic, Worcestershire, dry soup mix, pepper, stock and water.
2. Cook on low setting for 5-6 hours.
3. During cooking time, sauté the mushrooms in butter about 4 mins. 
4. Put sautéed mushrooms in slow cooker last 30 minutes of cooking time
5. Check sauce if it needs salt or extra pepper.
6. Best served over buttered egg noodles.

I think this came out fantastic.  But again, its all about personal opinions and tastes.  Let me know how this works out for everyone!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! Make sure you do these 5 things, however:
1. Use "Condensed Golden Mushroom" soup. The regular Cream of Mushroom doesn't have the larger pieces of mushrooms.
2. Substitute 1/4 cup beef broth for 1/4 water.
3. Use 4 oz. sour cream instead of cream cheese.
4. Add 1/2 t. pepper for a tiny little (but necessary) kick.
4. Just before adding the sour cream, mix 1 T. corn starch with 2 T. cold water, then add this mixture to stroganoff. This gives it the necessary extra thickness.
Then, enjoy this FABULOUSLY delicious and simple to make dish!

This recipe (and the reviewers of it) makes me very angry.  If you change a bunch of things (or even one or two critical things) about a recipe IT IS NO LONGER THIS RECIPE!!  I should not have to read through 50 reviews to know how to make this recipe at the rating it has received.  I made no changes at all.  It is awful.  It is super concentrated with absolutely no sauce.  The meat was all shredded up from cooking so long, and the flavor was FAR too salty.  Don't make this recipe.  If you've tried it with all the million alterations people have insisted you need to do in order for it to be good, then go ahead and submit that recipe to Allrecipes.com  I'll try it -- and maybe it will deserve the nearly 5 stars this recipe has.

Wow!  For my husband and I to agree that a dish is worthy of 5 stars is very rare. This was a great comfort food dinner, perfect after a very long day, so easy to make.  And I have never made homemade stroganoff before!  I made some changes, based on Jillybean14's review, who summed up the 500+ reviews on here (thank you!).  To do what Jillybean did, and save others some time, here is what all these reviews say to do: 1)Add some salt,pepper, and garlic to the pot. 2) Double the meat. 3) Double the soup and water but keep worchestshire and cream cheese the same. 4)Add 1/2 packet onion soup mix to mixture. 5)Cook on LOW only for 5 hours. 6) Add a dollop of sour cream also when adding cream cheese. 7) Add sauteed fresh mushrooms (about 4-6 oz) 1/2 hr before serving.  8) Serve over egg noodles.  I followed these suggestions, and now my husband, who is a big fan of Hamburger Helper, wants this instead and thinks I am the stroganoff goddess. =) A keeper for the recipe box! I will make this often.

I think I've found my new favorite comfort food. This was really good. I used 2 pounds of round steak (just don't like stew meat), 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, added some onion soup mix (for flavor), and 1/2 cup water (I like gravy). To help the cream cheese melt easier, cube and soften it before adding. I like the idea of using cream cheese rather than the traditional sour cream because if you're lucky enough to have leftvovers, it reheats nicer than sour cream. I can't wait to make it again!

5 stars for a great easy recipe for the busy on-the-go parent!  Doubled the sauce!!!  Added 1/2 tsp of fresh minced garlic,  1/2 packet of dry Italian-style salad dressing and 1/2 packet of Lipton's dry onion/ beefy/ mushroom soup mix to give the stroganoff extra flavor complexity.  Subbed low sodium beef broth for the water, and low sodium worcestershire for the regular.  Added sauteed mushrooms 1/2 hour prior to the finish and stirred in sour cream to taste prior to serving!  Helpful hint:  Check the intensity of your crockpot as some are "hotter" than others and you may not need to cook the stroganoff the full 8 hours as the recipe lists.   Thanks Jessica - great recipe!

This tastes really good, but I found that because I floured and browned the meat (which naturally thickens the sauce) and added fresh mushrooms (which absorb a LOT of moisture), I increased the water to a full cup and still would have been happy with a thinner sauce.  I liked the flavor enough to give this another try - this time no mushrooms and with a full soup can of water.  I also think I'll use traditional sour cream instead - the cream cheese tasted very good, but I think the texture of the sour cream will suit my tastes better.  That's the beauty of this recipe - it's a great place to take off & tinker to your preferences!

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! My husband is the pickiest eater there is and he loved this. Hamburger Helper Stroganoff has been my husband's favorite since he was a little boy. I hated making it but did for him, till last night, I put my foot down and told I wanted to try this recipe. He hates mushroom and I did not really think he would like it. He ate a HUGE bowl at dinner, then pulled out the leftovers shortly before going to bed and ate ANOTHER HUGE BOWL. He told me he like this more than his favorite stroganoff. I used some of the other suggestions. I keep the meat(1 lb.), worcestershire(1 tbls.), and cream cheese(4 oz) the same. I doubled the soup(2 cans) and water(1/2 cup).I omitted the onions (husband hates them) but I did add half a pack of the lipton onion soup mix. Thank you so much for this recipe. I am sure I will be making this for a LONG time.

I am thrilled, thrilled, THRILLED to have found this recipe. My husband loves when I make stroganoff, but I hate all the work involved.  Per the other reviewers' suggestions, I used sour cream, as well as the onion soup packet. Wonderful! I threw in a jar of mushrooms toward the end of cooking - I had a very happy hubby! Thanks for the EASY and delicious recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  It was soooo easy, AND, much better than other stroganoff recipes that I have used (I've used one recipe that called for sour cream, cream cheese, and cream soup.........clogged arteries!!!)  I took the advice of some other reviews and I added a packet of dried onion soup mix.  When I added the cream cheese at the end, I also threw in two handfuls of fresh mushrooms.  It was the perfect touch.  I will be adding this recipe to my permanent collection!!

I am only giving this 4 stars since I did take the advice of many reviewers and modified the recipe quite a bit.  Instead of using a slow cooker, I cooked this in a dutch oven on top of the stove and it turned out really good.  I served it over egg noodles, but my family likes it on rice better.  I love the addition of the cream cheese instead of sour cream, too!  Instead of buying exspensive stew meat, I bought a chuck roast and cut it up myself. ***Update:  I made this again and didn't add the cream cheese due to not having any.  It was still delicious.  Probably not truly considered stroganoff, though.  My family prefers it on rice, too.

Jessica, thank you for posting this fantastic base recipe, I like many others did not follow it to the letter, but without your recipe wouldnt have tried it at all! I give this 5 stars because your base recipe is the cornerstone of it all!
I always read the reviews of whatever recipe I am going to try, and then make my own changes accordingly. I had a few pounds of cube steak that I wanted to use up and make tender, and this fit the bill...I sliced some onions thick and layered them first, then I cut up the cube steak, didnt brown or flour it at all....put in half a pack of beefy onion soup, tablespoon of Lea and perrins, cup of water, two cans of golden mushroom soup (we like a thick gravy here, lol) and about a heaping teaspoon of ground pepper....let that all simmer in the crock pot for about 5 hours...then added about 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms...let it cook on low another hour...then added half a bar of low fat cream cheese then 8oz of sour cream...served over wide egg noodles and it was a HUGE hit in my household of three...made enough that we had it again last night and it tasted even better! Great use for cube steak btw, a good cheap option...Thanks again Jessica, this will be a staple in my house this winter!

So many reviewers said follow jillybean14's suggestions - I finally found her on page 45.  To help out, here is what she suggests:  (1) add salt, pepper and garlic, (2)double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worchestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hrs. on low (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a boullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles (9) add sauteed mushrooms, about 1/2 an hour before serving.

Hubby's first words were..."This is awesome." This turned out great and was super easy. Perfect for a cold winter evening or company! However I did add a few things and made a few simple changes after looking at a couple of the other recipes. Here is what I did. 1 can of golden mushroom soup and half can of cream of mushroom, whole package of fresh sliced mushrooms, 3 sliced green onions and half a chopped yellow onion. 1 can of beef broth instead of any water. I seasoned the cubed stew beef with seasoning salt ( and if you cook it on low for 6-8 hours it does NOT toughen up, ours was sooo tender! So save a few bucks and get the stew meat!). Cooked on low for 6 hours and served over buttered noodles with parsley. I would actually add more mushrooms next time. The last hour I put in 8 oz of low fat sour cream and 3 heaping tablespoons of nonfat cream cheese. I then took 1 tbls of corn starch (you could use flour) and mixed it with milk to thicken the sauce. It was pretty thick already so I would only add it if you like a thicker sauce. Putting the cream cheese in the last hour gave it plenty of time to combine and cook down so it was not chunky. Perfection!!

Great recipe! I did change it a little bit. I used a round steak and coated it with flour and browned it before I put it in the crock pot. I also added a can of beef broth to the mix and used the whole brick of cream cheese. Turns out great every time!

Always on the lookout for sure-fire slow cooker meals and this was great, so thanks Jessica and also JILLYBEAN14 and other reviewers. (Given that I followed Jilly's modifications.) Received compliments all around for this. Definitely a keeper to make again, nice comfort fare.

I made a lot of changes based on reviews. I use following: 2 lbs stew meat, 2 cans golden cream of mushroom, 1 med onion diced, 2 cloves garlic minced, 1 beef bullion, 2T Worcestershire. Sauce, 1 pkt onion soup mix, 1/2 c.-ish beef broth, sliced mushrooms, & 4 oz. cream cheese. Cook 8 hours on low and add cream cheese about 30-60 minutes before serving. I've made this dozens of times and I no longer measure and it always turns out great. Since there is only two of us and I don't want left overs I use 1 lb stew meat, 1 can golden mushroom soup in a smaller crockpot on low for 5-6 hours and everything else the same and it's still good.

My husband thought it to be a bit bland as far as flavor goes, but I just added some more Worcestershire sauce to the dish once it was done and it tasted a lot better, other than that I just used sour cream instead of cream cheese and this dish was super yummy! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make it again!

Wow! Just delicious! We will for sure make this again and again. I did all the alterations recommended by other reviewers though. 2 lb stew meat, 2 cans soup, 1/2 cup beef broth instead of water, added salt, pepper and garlic powder, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, sauteed mushrooms in butter and added at end and dollop of sour cream. Cooked on low 5 hrs. It was to DIE for! We served over egg noodles with a side of boiled potatoes with a butter/dill sauce. Its also great warmed up the next day!

I found this recipe 5 years ago and just now deciding I should add my two cents - I like to think I've perfected it, somewhat.

For the more picky cook, it helps to brown your beef. No need to, but it definitely brings out more flavor. We're two guys so one pound of beef just doesn't cut it for wanting to have this for dinner for a few nights, so I sometimes double or triple the recipe, especially if we're having company.

I toss in a bit more extra worcestershire sauce, like about one tablespoon extra. I've spent quite a bit of time in Russia and can tell you this little recipe would (and HAS) satisfied a picky Russian... and those Russians know their stroganoff! ;-)

As others have said, a cube of beef bouillon doesn't hurt but if you think it needs more seasoning, go for it! I always add a touch of Cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit, but I have Cajun roots so, that's just me.

Finally, I ALWAYS add mushrooms near the end. Take an 8oz or more pack of baby bellas, slices em up, toss them in a pan and sauté with some butter, then set aside. In the last hour or two of cooking, toss them in and stir. Seriously, you gotta do this. It adds the authentic stroganoff taste and texture and jacks up the recipe a bit if you're feeding a hungry family.

Excellent recipe - this recipe is the reason I've become a slow cooker guy and I'd love to meet the person who posted it and shake their hands or give 'em a hug. It's just that good!!

And I have never made homemade stroganoff before! I made some changes, based on Jillybean14's review, who summed up the 500+ reviews on here (thank you!). To do what Jillybean did, and save others some time, here is what all these reviews say to do: 1)Add some salt,pepper, and garlic to the pot. 2) Double the meat. 3) Double the soup and water but keep worchestshire and cream cheese the same. 4)Add 1/2 packet onion soup mix to mixture. 5)Cook on LOW only for 5 hours. 6) Add a dollop of sour cream also when adding cream cheese. 7) Add sauteed fresh mushrooms (about 4-6 oz) 1/2 hr before serving. 8) Serve over egg noodles.

See JillyBean14's Review which I copied here:     I read almost all of the 400+ reviews and made modifications based on them.  To save everyone else some time, here's what they say to do (and what I did...and it came out great):  (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.  I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted others and I think it helped.  Great slow-cooker recipe.  I froze the leftovers (egg noodles and all) in my Seal-a-Meal and then just boiled the bag to reheat.  It was great the second time around!

The only thing I did differently was skip the onion soupd mix - can't stand it.  Whole family LOVED this recipe.  Highly recommend it!!

I took some of the suggestions from other readers and added some extra mushrooms and more meat.  I used the golden mushroom soup and also added a can of beefy mushroom soup and eliminated the suggestion of onion soup.  I added some pepper and garlic.  I did not use Cream Cheese as I don't care for the cream cheese flavor in casseroles - it just seems to overpower everything else.  I used about a cup of sour cream as I had a lot of sauce.  If I were to make it again, I'd probably not use the second can of soup as there was just so much sauce.  That said, hubby and I enjoyed this a lot and I'll probably make it again with a few adjustments to strive for that 5th. star.

I made this using the exact recipe.  Because of my work schedule mine ended up cooking on low for about 10 hours.  My only regret is that for some reason my onions never got soft.  Next time I'll saute them a bit first.  The ingredients were simple, and we liked the end result.  We'll definately be making this again!

Okay this is a good basic recipe.  I double the recipe.  Used half golden mushroom and half roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup.  Added one package beefy onion soup mix.  Also added some cooking sherry (1/4 cup).  An hour or so before serving, added fresh sliced mushrooms (about 1.5 cups).

Extremely bland, and the cream cheese left little chunks because of combining it with heat (didn't consider at the time).

this is really good AS LONG AS YOU MAKE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES:  (Jillybean14 read all the reviews and summarized the changes that needed to be made.  These are her changes)  2 pounds cubed beef stew meat 2 cans golden mushroom soup 1/2 cup chopped onion 1/2 packet of dry onion soup mix 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup water 4 ounces cream cheese spoonful of sour cream  Follow the directions listed on the recipe.  Add a bit of salt, pepper & garlic to the pot along with everything else.  Stir in spoonful of sour cream at the same time you stir in cream cheese.  my 4 year old and 2 year old couldn't get enough of this.  I served it over wide-cut egg noodles.  It was done in exactly 5 hours on low.  I will definitely make this again.  remember - don't sub the golden mushroom soup.  it has to be golden mushroom.

I cannot believe this is five stars. My husband and I did not like this at all. I have been cooking since I was twelve and I am known by family and friends to be an awesome cook, so I was a little embarrassed when hubby asked me not to make this again.

I tried this adding 8 oz. of mushrooms,a cup of red wine and 2 tbsp. of beef bullion. I seared the meat, browning it but not fully cooking it. Best stroganoff we've ever had.

Awesome. I like simple recipes with a lot of leftovers, so I read over some reviews and came up with this. 2lbs stew meat, 3 cans Golden Mushroom soup, 4oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1tbs Worcestershire sauce, and instead of onions or water, I substituted in a can of french onion soup. This also eliminated the onion soup mix. Pepper to taste. I LITERALLY dropped everything in the crockpot on high and went to work for 5 hours. Came back later, prepared the noodles and spooned over the yummy mixture. Super easy, super yum.

Amazing, this is so absolutely wonderful, very easy.  The cream cheese was lumpy though, next time I will take out some sauce and whisk the cream cheese into that then add to the mixture.  I also added 2tbsp of sour cream, sauteed mushrooms, salt pepper, garlic and boullion.  I would double the recipe if you are making this for 4 or more adults.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The premise of this recipe is fine but it lacks seasoning. I added 1 TBL extra worstershire, 1/3 cup white wine, 1 TBL dijon mustard, .5 TSP dried dill, .75 TSP nutmeg, salt and pepper, 1 can drained mushrooms. I also substituted light sour cream for cream cheese. It was excellent.

My husband said this is the best stroganoff he has ever had.  I used ground meat instead of the cube meat (only because my kids will eat the ground meat).  I also could not find golden mushroom soup so I used roasted garlic and mushroom soup instead.  And I used beef broth in place of the water.  The taste was wonderful and I will be making this version from now on.

Always looking for something new to make cause the simpler it is the better my husband likes it.  We both enjoyed this meal, I had a package of beef ribs in the freezer I used for the meat.  I almost forget the cream cheese and because it wasn't thick at that point, I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the gravy, then I remembered the cream chesse.  I like mushrooms, he doesn't so I sauteed them and put them on my portion only.  Both of us were happy!  I'll be adding this to my recipes.  Thank you for sharing!

So Good!! Cooked overnight on low in the crock pot. I left it on warm until dinner time. Doubled the recipe since I only had a 2 1/2 lb roast instead of the stew meat. But, really good anyways.

I read almost all of the reviews and made modifications based on them; and here they are (and what I did...and it came out absolutely delicious!): (1) add salt, pepper, and 3 cloves minced garlic, (2) double the soup (3) use Golden Mushroom, NOT cream of mushroom! (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) use 2 oz cream cheese and a dollop sour cream (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix (8) add sautéed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving. Mine came out rather thin, so it might help if you coat the meat in flour before cooking it. Oh, and I used Venison instead of beef, and none of my family could tell. I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted the other reviews and I’m glad I did! 5 stars to the modified recipie, but 3 to this basic (and rather bland) recipie! (Special thanks to Jillybean14 and MomSavedbyGrace!)

I followed the first reviewer's suggestions.  They were great.  Added pepper and 3 cloves garlic. Doubled the soup and water.  Do not use Cream of Mushroom.  Reduced the cooking time to about 6 hours on low and 1/2 hour on high.  Added a "dollup" of sour cream when I added the cream cheese.  Added a beef bullion cube.  Added a half packet of onion soup mix.  Added 8 oz package of sauteed mushrooms 1/2 hour before serving.  Served over egg noodles.    Absolutely loved it!  The beef was so tender and the sauce was tasty!  I also served it with bread to soak up the extra sauce.  I froze the leftovers.

Made this for the first time for company, and it was a hit! I used 2lbs. bottom round steak cut into cubes, 2 cans golden mush soup, 1/2 package dry onion soup mix, and sauted 6 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, and poured it in pot with juices, and a little xtra cream cheese since I used 2 cans soup. Followed recipe for the rest. Served over buttered noodles with a side of green peas, and bread for dipping up the delicious gravy! Can't go wrong with this winner...

This is a good, easy recipe, although I do think that it's missing something.  It needs some spices to jazz it up.  I will make it again, but the next time I will add oregano and maybe some flour to thicken the gravy.  I'll also double the recipe, since it made enough for my husband and I to share for dinner with a little left over for his lunch the next day.  I used sour cream instead of cream cheese.  Rather than adding the cream to the crock pot, I served it on the side so we could add as much or as little as we wanted.  I found that it was just as good without.  I served this over egg noodles which I prefer (more hearty).  My husband gave this a 7 on a scale of 1-10.

WOW!!  A real keeper!  I added canned mushrooms, salt and pepper.  At the end I added the cream cheese (3 oz) first and then added about a 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I think the combo of the cream cheese and sour cream is perfect.

I don't normally care for beef stroganoff; however, I made this last night (with the recommendations from billyjean14)and loved it.  I am reposting the recommendations from billyjean14 that I followed: 

I read almost all of the 400+ reviews and made modifications based on them. To save everyone else some time, here's what they say to do (and what I did...and it came out great): (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving. I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted others and I think it helped. Great slow-cooker recipe. I froze the leftovers (egg noodles and all) in my Seal-a-Meal and then just boiled the bag to reheat. It was great the second time around!

This is my least favorite Stroganoff recipe that I have made.  I prefer regular cream of mushroom soup over the golden mushroom soup in this recipe.  I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce mixture as the recipe as written didn't make enough for 4 servings.

This was actually really good! I doubled the sauce but left the worcestershire and cream cheese the same. Had it 2 nights in a row and it was delicious.

I seasoned my beef prior to putting in the slow cooker with paprika, garlic powder and s&p. I also added a beef bouillon cube for extra flavor. Next time may add the onion soup mix to see how it tastes. Added sauteed mushrooms about 45 minutes before it was finished. Overall it was really yummy. My only complaint is that meat was a little tough though (cooked 8 hours on low).

Served this for dinner last night. My whole crew..even my picky daughter loved it..yay!! I had some left over grilled steak that I used, rather than the stew meat. I didn't have golden mushroom soup, so I used reg. mushroom soup. I added a package of french onion soup mix, garlic, basil & paprika. I used beef broth, rather than water. I cooked on low for 4 hours. I didn't see you weren't supposed to add the cream cheese until the end, but it still turned out great. I served over homestyle noodles & topped with fresh basil. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

OK this is an awesome base recipe.  As I was reading the other reviews and preparing it, I did make some suggested adjustments.  My family asked for this all the time.  (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a beef bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.

this recipe is perfect the way it is.  to everyone that feels the need to rate it based on changes that they have made personally, why don't you submit your own recipe and rate this one for what it is?  how insulting.  and, lastly, thanks, jessica!  our family (of 6) all love this recipe exactly like you wrote it!

I made a double batch of this the first time.  I am expecting our first baby, so I wanted to put some meals in the freezer.  I split it and froze it in two separate foodsaver bags to make reheating in boiling water easy.

We had it last night.  It's FABULOUS.  Since I made a double batch, I took some suggestions from previous reviewers.  I added a package of onion soup mix, some garlic and two jars of mushrooms.  I also browned the meat before flinging it in the slow cooker.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours.  

It reheats beautifully.  We weren't sure about the cream cheese, but it really is quite good!  Try this one with no reservations.  Will make over and over again (I'm going to make a lot since I have a huge slow cooker.)

I jazzed this recipe up, following the advice of some others. First, I coated the beef with the flour, salt, and pepper and browned it. I added beef broth instead of water; I eliminated the onion and used a packet of onion soup mix instead; I also added one Tbs. of tomato paste and 1 Tbs. of horseradish. I placed fresh thyme and sage while it was cooking, but removed them when I added 2 oz. of onion and chive cream cheese and 2 oz. sour cream.

I agree with the previous reviewer:  this dish has little taste.  The recipe is sorely lacking in seasoning and creating flavor depth.  The one thing I did like was how tender the meat came out through the slow cooking process.  Seasonings are really needed, such as salt and pepper, garlic, beef bouillon and/or broth, perhaps even a touch of tomato paste.  I also think that browning the meat and onions (as well as mushrooms) would result in a much fuller flavor, so I’ll do that next time.  And, the cream cheese just does not work in stroganoff – sour cream would much improve and authenticate this dish.  Although I wasn’t impressed, it’s definitely a dish I can tinker with.     : )    Folks - see “Daria’s Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff” on this site.  That recipe looks MUCH better.

This recipe was very good.  I made just as it was written.  Next time I will use sour cream instead of cream cheese and I will try white wine in place of the water.

Great!  Extremely easy - there is nothing to this, I kept on staring at the recipe to see what I was forgetting to do/add to the pot but didn't find anything.  Sometimes I think we forget that simple make-up leads to severely simple tastes extroadinaire! Perfect consistency and perfectly delicious! I through in some carrots and added a little cumin to the slow cooker then served with some egg noodles that I coated with butter and salt. Next time I might throw in some potatoes into the slow cooker with the stroganoff for more of a stew like all-in-one meal.  Note I use egg noodles b/c my husband prefers noodles to rice however, I think this would be awesome over rice. Delicioso!

Tried this twice... Once as written and once again with modifications. As written, it's a good basic recipe. With additions that I made, it's outstanding. Add 1/2 pkt onion soup mix, 1/4 cup red wine and a good sprinkle of garlic powder. Cooked 1 lb frozen venison steaks on high for four hours. Shredded the meat and added the cream cheese. Dynamite! Couldn't stop licking the spoon :)

I don't think I will ever make beef stroganoff with sour cream again. This was so delicious and both me, my fiance and best friend said it was amazing! I did make a couple of adjustments but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I used 2lbs of meat, 2 cans of the golden mushroom soup and added some chicken bullion powder, garlic salt, steak house seasoning and some pepper. I didn't measure 1/2 cup of onion; instead I just used half of a large yellow onion and finally added a third of a 16oz package chopped mushrooms. 
Right before I added the cream cheese I sauted the remainder of the mushrooms and added to the crock pot. Then added the 4oz of cream cheese. I took out a large amount (about half or a little more) of the liquid in the crockpot and boiled it in a sauce pan, adding a teeny bit of butter (less then a tbsp) and some corn starch until it thickened up a bit and poured it back into the crockpot, turned off the heat and let sit for about 10 minutes to continue thickening. Served over egg noodles and was amazing! I am making some tonight and am going to serve it with some grilled asparagus.

I made this recipe as written in the beginning and though it very bland. Tried to spice it up with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper, still not very flavorful, although we did like it.  Sorry, but I have to give it only 3 stars.

This recipe was a hit with my zoo crew tonight for supper!! I didn't use fresh onions I adjusted the recipe for 10 servings which made the amount of onions 1 and 1/4 cups of onion...and I have a daughter staying at home right now that is breastfeeding sooo I made a small adjustment I substituted one package of lipton beefy onion soup mix. and just as I was adding the cream cheese I added some freshly cooked wide egg noodles poured them right in the crock pot and stirred them in dash of salt and a dash of garlic powder and the kids and adults alike loved this...from my grandbaby who is 2 and my dad who is 66 thanks so much!!

This recipe as is its bland and overcooked.  If you have to add 15 things to make it edible then this recipe should never have gotten the rating it has.  Save your food and make something else.

Yummy!  I made this with no changes except I got in a hurry and put the cream cheese in at the start time instead of at the end.  It still worked out! And thanks to the Buzz folks that assured me it would be fine despite my error.

This recipe is great as is! The only other thing I added was pepper. You guys are nuts to add onion soup mix to this when there is already 700 milligrams of sodium per serving. Plenty of flavor without it.

The original recipe seemed a bit plain so I added sauteed mushrooms, extra onions, and some garlic. This probably helped a little. I enjoyed the sauce a lot. The meat wasn't as tender as I would have thought (cooked 5 hours on high), so next time I think I'll use ground beef...

Made this for my family coming over for dinner.  Had no Golden Mushroom so just used the regular Cream of Mushroom soup and it was still great.  Everyone gobbled it down.  Served with homemade broad noodles and garnished with a little sour cream and parsley.  I wonder if the Golden Mushroom soup would have made that much of a difference.

I've made this a couple times now and each time theirs never any leftovers! The recipe is GREAT AS IS. Don't worry if you don't have any golden mushroom soup because the only difference is the added mushrooms. So if you like mushrooms in yours just add some towards the end, unless you use fresh ones, then you can put them in in the beginning. The only thing I changed was to add garlic salt. We love salty food and I cook with garlic in just about everything! Thanks for a great easy comfort food!

i made the original recipe and wasnt crazy over it, thought it was bland, so i tweaked iti used two cans of condensed onion soup since i dont like mushrooms in  the first place, but i still added the chopped onion since i thought it added a bit of freshness to it. Also used half sour cream half cream cheese, to get it out of my fridge, and added some garlic, black pepper and just a few drops of hot sauce, and put it over some white rice. not a traditional stroganoff, but it tasted nice, and since im never home its nice to have something you can dump in and leave for a few hours.

This is one of my favourite recipes.  The husband loves it and it's so nice to come home to dinner already made when I walk in the door, just cook some egg noodles and it's on the table.  I throw this together at night and put the whole crock pot in the fridge and just plug it in on my way out the door in the morning.I usually make it with chicken instead of beef, add mushrooms and use herb and garlic flavoured cream cheese.

Easy and delicious. I added Lipton Onion Soup as suggested by others instead of an onion and will definitely make this again. It would be good over mashed potatoes too!

Turned out great...As per prior suggestion, I substitued beef broth for the water in the original recipe. I also substituted the golden mushroom for Campbells Condensed Mushroom with Garlic for a little extra kick. I browned the meat first for about 5 min., then cooked on high in crockpot for about 5 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night and it came out great. I seasoned beef with salt and pepper and cooked on low 6 hours instead of 8 and meat was very tender. Also added a splash of cooking sherry. Better than I expected.

This recipe was so good! The meat was so tender and the cream cheese made it taste so much better than sour cream. My boyfriend loved it too! This is going down as one of my favorite dishes.

We did not like this recipe at all.  I love Beef Stroganoff; it's one of my favorite meals.  But I don't make it often because of the time involved.  I thought I'd try this shortcut recipe.  It was a complete disappointment to both my husband & me.  I really don't understand why people are raving about it.

We liked this recipe a great deal, and I did some of the things that other reviewers suggested. My only issue was that with the addition of the bouillon and the onion soup packet, it became very salty, so on my second go round I added a beef onion soup packet, didn't add any salt, and cut the bouillon in 1/2. We loved the cream cheese versus the sour cream. It also freezes well and the leftovers are even better -- as are most things!

So SO good! My husband absolutely loved it, too. A huge winner that will be in regular rotation. I did use JILLYBEAN14's suggestions, however, so I really can't comment on the recipe on top. The only thing that I could think of to make this better is to double the recipe so there are plenty of leftovers! :)

The Golden Mushroom Soup didn't have enough mushrooms for my liking, so I'll probably add more the next time I make this. I threw in some lightly-sauteed, leftover bell pepper strips, and am enjoying those in the mix. This is a personalization-friendly recipe, so have fun!

I recently served this at a dinner party for 18 and it was a huge hit! This super easy recipe is wonderful as is, but I have also added mushrooms in the last hour, to suit our taste.  It has a nice thick sauce and plenty of it! I'm very sensitive to saltiness and didn't find it overly salty...in fact my husband and I (and a lot of friends) thought the flavor & consistency to be perfect! This one is a keeper!

This is a great base recipe but I would do the following additions to add those layers of flavors. Salt and pepper and sprinkle flour into your meat. In a iron skillet with a little EVOO brown your meat. Don't crowd the pan. Add the meat to the crockpot. Then using the same skillet through in your onions and garlic, I mix it around bringing up those juices and meat leftovers on the bottom if the skillet. After a few minutes I add the beef stock to the skillet to bring up all that flavor from the bottom of the skillet. Transfer to the crockpot. Then add your soup with 1 can of water. Add your Worcestershire, salt and pepper to taste, rosemary, thyme and a dab of kitchen bouquet. I cook it for 8 hours in the slow cooker. Then 30 minutes or so prior to eating I sauté the mushrooms with some butter in an iron skillet then add that to the crockpot. Add Sour cream and a little cream cheese right before serving. I serve it over extra broad egg noodles.

My first thoughts when reading this recipe were: "Mmmm! But me thinks it needs some salt, pepper, and garlic."  Then I read some of the reviews and decided to try it based on the modifications by some reviewers.  It was fabulous!  The sauce was perfect the way it turned out, so I didn't thicken it.  Especially loved all the sauce with the egg noodles.

2 lbs bottom blade roast cut into large chunks, 2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1 pkg lipton onion soup mix, half cup low sodium beef broth, 1 large yellow onion, 4 cloves garlic, 1 tbsp worcestershire, half tsp salt, 2 tsp fresh ground black pepper, cooked on low 5 hours.  Then 30 mins before finish time, added 4 oz cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream, 1 lb sauteed mushrooms in butter.  Next time, will try 8 oz cream cheese, add a beef bullion cube, 2 tbsp worcestershire, and lots more black pepper.

One helpful hint for time savings and less stress that worked for me...cut the beef and mix with all the ingredients (except cream cheese, sour cream, and sauteed mushrooms) in a mixing bowl, then cover, and refrigerate.  Remove from fridge and pour into slow cooker when you're ready to start cooking.  You could do this the night before so you don't have to rush in the morning, or prepare this in the early morning and throw in the slow cooker around 1:00PM so dinner will be ready around 6:00PM...you get the idea, have it all ready to pour in the slow cooker at whatever time is suitable for you so it will finish at least 5 hours later.

Easiest beef stroganoff ever. Just dump it all in, set it, and walk away until dinnertime. I used a chuck roast still frozen, dried minced onion and some onion powder instead of fresh and added some chopped parsley in at the very end. My husband loves beef stroganoff and this dish was a winner. He devoured every bit on his plate. Thanks for the recipe, I will be using this again with a sirloin roast at hubby's request instead of chuck.

I was excited to try this especially with such high ratings. I guess we are out of the norm here. My DH and I both agree that this just wasn't that good. Maybe it's because I don't usually cook with canned cream soups. This is basically meat and soup. I will stick with my old standby recipe starting with a roux. Sorry.

This was a wow for us, especially with such simple ingrediants.  I always make as-is the first time;  I might add some water chestnuts next time around just for some texture contrast.   But it is delicious and simple just as-written!

My fiance and I really really enjoyed this last night during our first snow.  It was also my 1st time making beef stroganoff.   However, I did follow the advice a lot of other reviewers, and changed/added my own ingredients.

Used 2 lbs of beef
added 2 cans of golden mushroom soup
2- 1/4 cups beef broth instead of water
minced garlic
Salt&Pepper
a little bit Garlic powder (i love garlic)
1/2 packet of onion seasoning (lipton)
Kept the cream cheese the same and added a dollop of sour cream.
I kept the 1/2 cup onion and I added sauteed mushrooms to it about an 1 hour before I served it.
Served over egg noodles

I am not sure how this would cook on high for 8 hours?  I think it would have fried the "sauce"/my crock pot.  5 hours on low was good enough.  It may not even need that in our crock pot, though....

This is an awesome base recipe to tweak and add other flavors you may like to include.  But I will definitely be making it again and I appreciate the head start on perfecting it!  Oh, and I don't think I will ever use just sour cream in a beef stroganoff recipe.  Loved the cream cheese in it!!!

Thank you!!!

Read numerous reviews and took their suggestions and this was really, really good.  I will actually use 16 oz. mushrooms (read reviews) next time as that was my favorite part.  I could eat the sauce with just mushrooms and be content but my husband would miss the beef.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and very good.  My 5 and 7 year old both loved it.  I did not mention that it had mushrooms in it though and so they would not automatically say they don't like it.  It worked.  They had seconds.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written - only fair to do it this way if I'm going to rate it.  When I think of stroganoff I think of a creamy sauce with a sour cream flavor and this recipe was not even a little bit creamy creamy but more gravy like.  The golden mushroom soup almost gives it a bit of a bite/tartness that I didn't care for at all - personal preference.  The recipe calls for 8 hours on low, which I did, but this was way too long as the gravy like sauce and meat were overcooked and slighly burned.  This is not a recipe I will try again.

this was the best recipes for stroganoff my husband and I ever had. First I sub. 1/4 cup of beef broth for the 1/4 cup water then..I added some fresh mushrooms about 1 hour before cookin was finished and used sour cream instead of the cream cheese just before serving. and added 1/2 tsp pepper for kick just before adding the sour cream I added 1 tbsp of corn starch mixed w/ 2tsp of water for thickness. It was wonderful

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I took some of the advice of others but not all... I basically doubled the meat, the golden mushroom soup, the water and worcestershire sauce.  About an hour before it was done, I added a package of sliced fresh mushrooms to the crockpot.  I kept the cream cheese the same (4 oz) and added 4 oz of sour cream.  It produced a lot of liquid so next time I may even use 3 lbs of meat.

This was delicious! My family loved it and it is my favorite to date! I took it out about 30 minutes early because the edges were getting black.  I also used wheat noodles and they tasted just fine! More than fine :) I cooked for four people though... and the serving size is six and we barely had enough... just something to think about.

Definitely a 5 star recipe with our family. I took JILLYBEAN14's recommendations into consideration and was not disappointed.  I would add sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions next time when adding in the cream cheese and sour cream though.  Delicious, was hoping for leftevers, but not the case.

I made this for my parents and husband and they all raved about it.  I used 2 lbs cubed stew meat, 2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1 chopped onion, 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1 bouillon cube, part of a package of onion soup mix, and 1lb sliced mushrooms.  After cooking on low all day, I added a little over 4oz sour cream just before serving.  I served over egg noodles and it made about 6-8 servings.  Wonderful!

Have enjoyed this recipe for years (with minor variations as mentioned by others) but accidently stumbled on a new favorite version:  I only had soft onion & chive cream cheese on hand so gave it a whirl.  Best ever - give it a try!

Wow ... we love this recipe in both its ease of preparation and taste!  I did take into consideration the suggestions of the reviewers (look at JILLYBEAN14's review!) and I always double the amount of mushrooms (and just throw them in ... don't saute them).  This was one of the only dishes my mom could stomach when she was going through chemotherapy (the noodles and sauce actually .. not the beef) so I thank you for giving me something I could feed her!  Yum!

doubled the sauce, mushrooms, used beef broth and exchanged the cream cheese for sour cream per other reader's suggestions.  You MUST use golden mushroom soup.  Absolutely delicious!

We love this and have made it several times. First time I made it I used cream cheese, second time - a combination of cream cheese and sour cream.  While the cream cheese is fine, I think the tartness of the sour cream is far better.  I do double the meat and quadruple the sauce because it tastes so great on those noodles and leftovers are wonderful.

Loved it. I do add a little Burgundy Wine to give it an authentic Stroganoff flavor. I also use half cream cheese and half sour cream.

This was very good. I cooked it on high for 5 hours and included the onion soup mixture and beef bouillon as others did. I doubled everything so I would have more to eat on over the week and it turned out to be a good portion. Idid not add the onion because of the soup mix and added no extra mushrooms because I don't dig them. I would recommend cutting the cream cheese up if you are going to use it, it helps it to melt more evenly in the stew. Great winter meal and I picked the perfect day since it is about 15 degrees here today.

Super easy way to make Stroganoff. I added one packet of Lipton onion soup mix and sauteed the onions with some sliced mushrooms and added them to the slow cooker 30 minutes before serving. Yum!

We enjoyed this recipe very much. I took the condensed list of recommendations and added the following to an 8 serving recipe: garlic salt to taste, onion soup mix, and a dollop of sour cream when adding the cream cheese.  I couldn't find "golden" mushroom soup and used cream of mushroom instead and it came out just fine.  I substituted non-fat cream cheese and non-fat sour cream to try to reduce the fat/calories by a bit and served over no-yolk egg noodles.  I also reduced the cook time to five hours on low.  We even dug out our old bread machine and made a loaf of buttermilk white bread to go with it!  A great recipe for a blustery winter day.

This recipe was sooooo easy.  I used leftover primerib from Christmas and only cooked it for 4 hours.  I also used all the suggestions on the sauce and adding mushrooms and spices.  I didn't have 2 cans of Golden Mushroom soup, so used an entire envelope of onion munshroom soup mix and a little extra water.  Rave reviews from kids and neighbors alike.

I rated this recipe only 3 stars because this recipe had to be adjusted to JELLYBEAN14 recommendations to meet the the 5 star quality. With JELLYBEAN14 modifications the Beef Stroganoff was 5 stars "The BEST!". 

Here are JELLYBEAN14 recommendations & Thanks again ;-)

(1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.

Coming from a German-Russian family beef stroganoff has been a staple for as long as I can remember. I have a couple timeless recipes that are better- but more time consuming. I will hang on to this when I am looking for something quick- which is pretty often. It came out great with all of the changes that were suggested in previous reviews- thank you JILLYBEAN14 for putting them all together. It saved a lot of time. The only change I made was to add one can of Golden Mushroom and on of Cream of Mushroom when doubling the sauce. Serve with homemade egg noodles if you have them available... so much better than store bought!

I have tried a lot of different beef stroganoff recipes, and this is one of the best!

As suggested by many of the other reviewers, I made some tweaks to adjust for my particular palate and a quantity based on the serving of four adults, but these were nothing extraordinary.  They were as follows:

I tend to have lousy luck with stew meat, regardless of where I buy it, so I always use steak.  In this case, I used 1 1/2 lbs top round which I trimmed, cubed, and browned prior.

As suggested by others, I increased the Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup to (2) cans and the water to 1/2 cup.  At first I had my doubts about specifying that particular brand and flavor soup (as it seemed a bit tomato-ey) but "definitely" only use Campbell's Golden Mushroom. It is perfect for this recipe.

I added one can (sliced) mushrooms, but sliced fresh mushrooms would probably have been best.

I prefer a zip, so I added 1/2 tsp pepper.

I served this over extra wide egg noodles, which of course, I prepared separately, al dente, with a touch of melted butter and a pinch of parsley.  I held off on the sour cream and added a small dollop to each individual serving.

Accompanied by a salad (vinaigrette dressing recommended) and some fresh sourdough... marvelous!

This was really good.  I did do a few things differently.  I covered the meat into flour and just fried it up in the pan for a minute or two to get some color.  Then added it to the slow cooker.  Also sauted some mushrooms with that too...since I knew that I wanted more than the soup would provide.  It turned out really well.  The meat was very tender and had tons of flavor.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for the post.

This stroganoff was excellent! I have tips to cut the time way down in making this. 1st, read Jillybean's & momsavedbygrace's reveiws on what to do different with ingredients. In addition to the above changes, I did the following with mine: 1) used TENDERIZED ROUND STEAK instead of stew meat. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOLKS!! You can cook stew meat until the cows come home & it will rarely get really tender. My mom buys pre-tenderized round steak and uses it in stews and similar dishes; it always turns out fantastic. Just cube the meat yourself in 5 minutes & you'll shave hours off the cook time. 2)I added onion & garlic powder, salt & pepper 3) Added about a TBSPN of beef granuals 4) One eight oz package of pre-sliced mushrooms, sauteed in cooking spray & 1 TBSPN or so of Olivio. Don't sautee mushrooms until they were soggy; leave a little texture and bite to them as the soup mushrooms tend to disappear. 5) Added one very generous dallop of fat free sour cream (use Breakstones; you'll never miss the fat). I have a new KitchenAid slow cooker which might be a little more efficient than most but I think the meat is the key to less cook time. I cooked this for an hour & 15min on high, then two hours on slightly higher than low. It was perfect in 3 hours, 20 minutes (probably was done sooner but I wasn't home to check it). Tossed in the mushrooms right before serving as well as cream cheese and sour cream; no further cooking needed once that dissovles. FABULOUS!

This recipe was very good. I doubled the sauce and I glad I did. I also added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms before cooking, substituted beef broth for the water and I used sour cream instead of cream cheese. This was very easy and turned out great. I will make this again.

What a wonderful surprise!  Such great flavor and texture from so few ingredients and little effort.  I had 1.5 lbs. of beef and only one can of golden mushroom soup so I improvised by adding 1 1/3 cups beef broth instead of the water.  Started with frozen beef cubes.

Excellent stroganoff. I doubled the recipe to provide enough for leftovers but a neighbor who joined us for the meal had FOUR huge servings, so there was none left! I did add fresh sliced mushrooms and half a cup of sour cream with the cream cheese. Make sure the cream cheese is softened before adding it (I forgot to), or little tiny white lumps will appear, nearly impossible to get rid of. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, this is a great, easy dish to make! Although it definitely needs some changes. For a serving of 4, I used about 2 pounds of cubed stew beef, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup beef broth, 1/2 cup onion, 1 package of onion soup mix, 1.5 tbps worcestershire sauce, 2 garlic cloves, and 4 oz of cream cheese. Using a whole brick of cream cheese makes it WAYYYY too rich and creamy. When I added the cream cheese to it (about half an hour before serving) I added 1/4 sour cream to the pot as well. MMMM It turns out great this way! I then served over egg noodles, and it was a huge hit!

Very good!  I followed all of JILLYBEAN14's recommendations (except for the bullion cube).  (Sort the reviews by Most Helpful and she should be at the top.)  As good as my mom's recipe, and this recipe is much easier to make and more dependable.  (My mom's recipe requires a lot of modifications depending on how it looks as it is cooking.)  But I am still slightly bothered by the fact the stroganoff ends up brown and not white... (my mom's was white)  Oh, and the leftovers reheat well, just as good as right out of the pot.

Tried this for dh and in-laws.  DH turned up his nose until he tasted this and he was pleasantly surprised.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and so EASY.  I did follow some of the other reviewers recommendations by using 2 cans of the soup, 1/2 pkg onion soup mix, small amount of salt (the soup mix and can soup have TONS of salt), pepper and garlic powder, and added sauteed mushrooms in butter the last 30 minutes of cooking.  Used the rest of the ingredients as outlined in the recipe and added a "dollop" of sour cream.  I wish I had doubled the meat so I would've had more left over.  This ranks on the top of my list of favorite recipes!!!!

OK, I alterd this recipe a little after reading several reviews and it was AWESOME!  I used 1 lb of lean beef stew meat, 2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1 entire can of beef broth, i small can of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 onion and 1 TBSN of Worcheshire.  I put it in the crock pot on high for one hour then turned it down for 4-5 more.  I stirred in 1/2 C of sour cream at the end and it was amazing served over egg noodles.  TRY IT - YOU WILL LOVE IT!

THis was a wonderful slow cooker version of beef stroganoff!  I did make a change, however, since I had 2 pounds of meat, I omitted the chopped onion and added a dry onion soup mix in place of another can of condensed soup and the raw onion.  Delicious!!

House smelled wonderful when I arrived home from work! I used burgundy wine instead of water, and being a Monday, I was a bit heavy handed and used more like 3/4 -1 cup (I just poured it in until it felt right)! Gave me something to look forward to for after work! ;-) Anyhoo, I didn't use onion but a pack of Lipton Dry Onion Soup Mix, I thought that this made it tasty but a tad salty for me. Next time I will use 1/2 of the packet. I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup since I am out of mushroom and I used 2# of meat. I didn't measure out the worc. sauce but liberally sprinkled the Lea & Perrins in. This was DELICIOUS! The gravy is super awesome! This is for sure to become a regular at my house, thank you so much for sharing!

This was amazing.  I don't understand how anyone could say it has no flavor, unless they used cream of mushroom soup rather than golden mushroom b/c they taste very different.  I added more onions and sliced mushrooms and more water to cover everything.  I also added 1 T. cornstarch when I added the cream cheese to thicken it a bit.  Even better the second day.  I even used elk meat and couldn't tell!!  My new favorite dish!

Unlike everyone else, I don't want more "sauce."  I've made this numerous times, tweaking the recipe as I went, and this is the finale recipe I've ended up with:   I usually make this with 3 lbs of stew meat (my stores sell in 1.5 lb packages).  I double the onions and Worcester sauce, and substitute half beef broth, half decent red wine for the water.  I use half cream cheese, half sour cream, and add sauteed mushrooms with the dairy at the end.  At the same time, I also add about 2 tbl corn starch mixed with water, to thicken.  That seems to be the ideal recipe for me.  Just enough sauce to cover the noodles or rice, without being too much.

This recipe was fantastic! I doubled the recipe for my large, hungry family and there was just enough left over for my husband to take to work the next day for lunch. I made a few changes based on other users comments. I added 1/4 cup cooking sherry & a pkg of onion soup mix and the result was very flavorful. I will definately be making this again at the request of my family.

I really wouldn't change a thing except to add some fresh mushrooms next time and maybe just alittle more water. I used the low setting for 8 hours. It resulted in tender, flaky beef ! I used regular "cream of mush. soup w/ roasted garlic" and served it all over 12 oz.(dry) egg noodles .....cooked and tossed with butter and some steamed broccoli on the side. I would say this serves 3 hungry people (with the noodles). Very good and so easy !!! Thanks Jessica !

Very delicious and easy to prepare. I used strips of steak and I took the advice of others and used low-fat cream of mushroom soup and substituted cooking sherry for the water.  Then two hours before serving, I stirred in fresh mushrooms.  I used the light cream cheese to stir in before serving, then served light sour cream on the table to be used as desired.  My stroganoff was served over a bed of fluffy white rice and made for a beautiful, delicious dinner.  I highly recommend.

I made this recipe exactly as it said, and found it very easy to do and it tasted great. I loved the cream cheese substitute for sour cream. I only made a single recipe because there are only two of us and I didn't want a lot of leftover until I made sure we liked it. So with only a pound of stew meat, and with us both having seconds, we had nothing left but lots of gravy which our dog also liked. When I make it again--and I will, but I'll serve it over quinoa instead of noodles, I am going to double the meat, use beef broth instead of water, and maybe toss in a handful of mushrooms during the last hour of cooking. It would probably also cook just fine in only 5 hours although I left it on for 8.

Very easy to make.  I browned the meat and didn't use cream cheese because I don't like creamy dishes.  I wanted more of a beef and gravy noodle dish.  I did add a little red wine and au jus.

Doubled everything except the cream cheese, added salt pepper garlic, and a crumbled beef buillion cube. Added in a cup of sliced mushrooms sautéed in butter at the end, and used 4 oz scream cheese and 1/3 c sour cream. Cooked for 6 hrs on low. It was delicious and I'm sure the flavors will develop more with leftovers tomorrow!

Couldn't eat this recipe as written.  However, some tweaks make for a very tasty dish.  The recipe includes two interesting ideas: use of mushroom soup and cream cheese instead of sour cream.  However, I would suggest significant changes to the recipe.  I would dip the beef in flour and brown it in olive oil and garlic before putting it into the slow cooker.  I would deglace the frying pan with red wine and I would replace the water with about half the amount of beef broth.  Also, I preferred cream of mushroom soup - personal preference but I found the result was excellent.

Easy & very tasty. I think I stayed true to the spirit of the recipe but needed a double batch & had to work with what i had. 2#browned hamburger, 1 can golden mushroom, 1 can cream of mushroom, whole onion diced, sliced fresh mushrooms (b/c we like them), worchestershire, H2O, 6 oz cream cheese, I saved some for the mashed spuds this was going over.

About 9 hours later we fested. We almost made ourselves sick it was so good. So much for haveing a freezer meal too, this stuff was gone in about 24 hours, 2 people ate it all & we usually don't eat that much. Cook this recipe as is or it's also tweekable ( my fav kind). but try it. Happy cooking!

The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because following the suggestions from other raters is how I got the very best stroganoff I've had! 2 cans of soup, add sour cream and 1/2 an onion soup packet,  it is easy and amazing!

After reading the reviews, we cooked this on LOW for 5-6 hours and added a beef bouillon while cooking. While I was cooking the egg noodles at the end, I added another can of golden mushroom soup, the 4 oz of cream cheese, a dollop of sour cream, some garlic powder and black pepper. I loved the sauce. Next time I’ll add at least one more onion.

Delicious! I only changed a couple of things as I didn't have all the ingredients, but still turned out amazing! Instead of golden mushroom I did cream of mushroom, and instead of water I did chicken broth (I have used beef broth before, but I was out). I also added about 1 1/2 TBSP of the Worcestershire sauce to compensate for the chicken broth and served it over egg noodles. I normally use the golden mushroom however, today I preferred it with the cream of mushroom so I might make it this way from now on. My husband who doesn't like mushrooms at all, had two helpings of this!

This was a good recipe and I agree with the review that recommends the following (BUT I think adding bouillon makes it too salty):  (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.

This by far is THEE BEST stroganoff recipe I've ever used.  I've been using it for the past few years and the response from my BF the first time I made it was "This is the BEST Strognanoff I've ever had"!  I always use the modifications suggested by others, but honestly I've done it in a crockpot and made it quick after work.  Either way it comes out awesome! 

(1) add salt, pepper, and garlic to the meat while cooking (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half to a whole packet of onion soup mix (depending on your tastes (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.

I used ground beef and golden cream of mushroom with this amazing recipe. I doubled the sauce and mixed with 1 bag of egg noodles after 4 hours in crockpot.  I forgot to add worcestershire sauce but still came out so yummy. I served it with warm biscuits. My family of 5 ate it all!!!! No left overs.

I've made my beef stroganoff this way for years and it's the only way the family likes it. I use beef sirloin instead of stew meat and marinate it after I thinly slice it and I add a 4oz. can of sliced mushrooms. I also agree the cream cheese works better than sour cream though you may want to thin it with some milk or it will be too thick. I found this recipe on the back of a can of Campbell's golden mushroom soup in the early 70's but it called for using hamburger meat and sour cream. It's so easy to make and so delicious.

I have made this recipe numerous times, both as written, and with changes. My own take...double the meat, then mix the meat, onions and mushrooms in the crock (the mushrooms WILL absorb moisture, but then give it back).  Two cans of the Golden Mushroom soup, one can of Campbell's French Onion Soup, one can of water (more if needed).  I cook on high for the first hour, then on low for 3 hours. The last half hour I stir in sour cream.  I love the cream cheese addition, but don't always have it and I do love the sour cream.  Fat free works well, but we don't really have leftovers when I do this dish so I can't say how well it reheats.

This was easy, but the canned soup made it salty. I can't imagine how much saltier it would have been with beef bouillon or onion soup mix. Once I mixed in egg noodles, some of the saltiness disappeared. Since I added fresh mushrooms, I may try the  Healthy Request mushroom soup next time. It did take some tweaking before I got to the flavor I was looking for. I added some sweet paprika, then some garlic, then some sour cream, then (just a smidgen of dill and brown mustard). This seems to be a good basic recipe, but you'll need to season it to your taste. It seemed quite bland before that.

This is a great recipe to tweak.  Based on other reviews I increased water to 1/2 cup, added 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 beef boullion cube, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and substituted 1/3 c sour cream for the cream cheese.  I think next time instead of the bouillion I'm going to use low sodium beef broth in place of the water because it was a little salty.  Very yummy!

I liked this recipe but I found the cook time to be way off. I believe I ended up cooking it for around 6 hours on low and that was plenty of time. At that point it was starting to get too thick. I followed the recipe with the exceptions of substituting beef broth for water and adding a splash of red wine. The flavor was good and I think I would make this again; just keep an eye on it!

How could anyone NOT like this? This recipe has the perfect amount of flavor. A great every day recipe that you can jazz up IF you want to (mushrooms, a little sour cream for some tang) but it's totally not necessary. Oh, and adding onion soup mix like other reviewers mentioned would make this overly salty-the condensed soup has enough of it already!

This was OK. the cook time is way too long. It was perfect after 5 hours. It truly only feeds about 4 people. I should definitley have doubled it. I will make again because it was simple and still tasted good.

There's nothing better than coming home on a cold day to smell something like this simmering in the slow cooker.  The beef becomes so tender.  A little too much sauce left over though.

This was fabulous after I made the recommended adjustments.  I used cream of mushroom and cream of onion (because I couldn't find the golden mushroom).  I used about 1 1/2 cups water, a packet of onion soup mix.  At the end I added sauteed mushrooms and the cream cheese and a dollup of sour cream.

The recipe as posted is not good. I'm sorry, but it's bland, boring.
Some of the reviews do offer great tips to "fix" this recipe. However, most of us don't have time to read 2,200 reviews to determine what has worked best.

My first review was rated wrong..this is most definitely a FIVE STAR. This was really delicious.  I too read a lot of the reviews, then based on the comments  of Jillybean14 -  Jul6, 2005, and jessily -  Oct 15, 2008. I prepared a Five Star dish...thanks to all for your input...will definitely make this again.

Fantastic, with a few changes!  This was my first homemade beef stroganoff and it will definitely not be my last.  I followed Jilly's changes:  double golden mushroom soup; double meat; double water; added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix, a beef bullion cube, fresh cracked black pepper and garlic powder; added sauteed portabello mushrooms during last half hour; added a good scoop of sour cream as I stirred in the cream cheese; served over wide egg noodles.  I ran short on time so I started the slow cooker on high for 2 hours, then turned it down to low for another 2.5 hours.  Absolute perfection, and there was not a bite left afterward.

This was a very good basic recipe.  I did make some changes for more taste.  I exchanged beef broth for the water, added part of a packet of onion soup mix and added another can of soup.  I used cream of mushroom because I did not want large mushrooms or my husband will not eat it.  I sauteed the onion with garlic and browned the meat on the stove which gave the beef more flavor.  I had used 3 inch strips of beef.  I had also added a large spoon of sour cream in the end of cooking.  I did not tell my husband that I used mushroom soup...Thanks for the formula Jessica.

Deliciouss!! I doubled the recipe but did not double the Worcestershire sauce. Sauteed some sliced mushrooms 30 or so before the Stroganoff was done. Added 8 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of sour cream when done. I love garlic, however, the first time I made this I added garlic and I felt it just wasn't needed. Second time did not add garlic and we liked it much better. I know shock and dismay! But leave the garlic out. There are times when garlic adds to a dish and times when it distracts from it and it definately distracted from this dish.  Did add salt and pepper to taste.  Was a great meal. Family loved and it is not in our printed recipe book of favorites.  Thank you Jessica.

I was the only person who liked this meal. I used one whole sliced onion and beef broth instead of water. Maybe with some spices this would have been more successful? I don't know. But when making a meal and there's only one person who likes it, that's a waste. I'm sorry. Perhaps using this recipe as a base and adding a few things, this might be better.

I'm giving 5 stars because this recipe is so easy.  I would recommend adding more soup than recommended also could use a bit more flavor but a really good base recipe.

Pretty good. I like easy recipes with minimal ingredients (and like it or not ya'll, campbell's cream of whatever soups save our butts and taste good doing it), ESPECIALLY crock pot recipes, afterall who wants to come home after working 8 hours and slave over the stove for an hour? My stroganoff smelled wonderful when I walked in the house, tasted almost as good. I seasoned it with tons of seasoned salt and garlic powder and even more ground pepper, and added a can of mushrooms. Cream cheese was an EXCELLENT sub for sour cream (granted, I'm not a big sour cream fan anyway). Serve over egg noodles. I suggest this recipe as an almost weekly family dinner, wouldn't try to impress company with it though.

I made this for dinner on Thursday night.  It was pretty good. Kind of bland but before I served it we doctored it up.  Used sour cream instead of cream cheese.  I will make again but with some other changes.

I was ok, I tried doubling the sauce like some of the comments said, and it wasn't meaty enough. I also floured and browned the meat and added a little sour cream. My kids gave this one a thumb down.

My boyfriend and I love all kinds of food and are not picky but this dish was just "ok." we were let down because it was our first slow cooker meal. It wasn't bad by any means but I also probably won't make it again.

Really amazing stroganoff, with the following modifications (mostly based on others' reviews so far):

1) Sliced up a london broil instead of using stew meat
2) Doubled the rest of the recipe, except for the Worchestshire and cream cheese (the latter of which I omitted entirely)
3) Added powered garlic (maybe half a tablespoon), pepper to taste, 3 beef bullion cubes, about a 1/4 c. of beef stock and a full pack of dry onion soup
4) Used sour cream to taste instead of cream cheese, regular cream of mushroom soup and a pint of fresh mushrooms wrapped in cheesecloth (which I left in throughout the cooking process, so I could hold some of the stroganoff back --for those of us who really do not like mushrooms --before returning them freely to the sauce).

Everyone cleaned their plates.

To be clear, doubling the recipe meant using a cup of chopped onion. However, I used three cans of condensed mushroom soup because it was smelling so onion-y and since I had so much meat in there, but the fresh mushrooms surely also helped the overall flavor of this dish for us. Also, I forgot to add any water, but it did not need it anyway.

Really, the way I made it varies quite a bit from the original recipe, but if not for this recipe I would have just been using the same old seasoning packets we have relied on for years and this is so much better I have to give it five stars regardless for inspiring me to tinker with it.


Thanks for sharing it!

This is the best beef Stroganoff I have ever had. I usually don't get into "comfort food" but this had enough flavor to keep it interesting. I followed the directions as written, but my husband got into it before I had put the cream cheese in, and he said it was great without it too...

I wanted to try this recipe but had everything on hand except beef.  So I used cut up chicken breasts instead. It worked great, actually.  I followed other suggestions and used onion soup mix but I also threw in a packet of beefy mushroom soup.  Then I did add about a 1/4 cup of sour cream with the cream cheese.  Loved this recipe!  Can't wait to try this with beef.  I will probably add some garlic powder next time.

Super yummy! This is so good and so easy. I did make some changes: I added 2 cans of Golden Mushroom Soup, doubled the meat, 1 chopped onion, a dollop of sour cream, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 bouillon cube and I sauteed some mushrooms that I put on top of each dish. I used egg noodles. It was wonderful and I will defiantly make this again! I froze the left over sauce and alls I will have to do is cook some noodles and I will have another delicious meal!

This was very good.  I used beef broth instead of water and added 1/2 pkt of Onion soup mix and mushrooms.  Everyone went back for seconds!!  Will definitely make again!!

Yum, this was good! And so easy! We doubled the recipe and did a little bit of tweaking, but not much, after reading other reviews -- it came out so tasty! Next time we make this (and there will definitely be a next time!) we'll triple it and freeze the leftovers. Excellent cold weather food!

I made this recipe as written, and it was pretty good, although a little bland for my tastes. The recipe is a great foundation though--the texture of the sauce and tenderness of the meat is right, it could just stand more seasoning. If I make this again, I will follow the advice of the other reviewers and possibly add some plain tomato sauce to add depth to the flavor.

OMG - you need to make this one!  I've made a couple times now, although the last time I couldn't find golden mushroom soup - its really hard to find here in Ottawa now!  Anyway, I found out that cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, tablespoon of tomato paste and some sauteed mushrooms work just as well as original recipe.  This one is great comfort food!

Awesome dish!  I added a few seasonings and that's it.  Important note: use a whisk after putting in the cream cheese.  All those little cream cheese pieces will dissolve much quicker!

Added sauted mushrooms in at the beginning instead of waiting until the end as originally suggested followed all of the previous suggestions from JILLYBEAN...very fragrant and full of flavor. I'm not a stroganoff eater, but this was delicious!

I used Jillybean14's recommendations and the husband and kids all liked it. Reheated it mixing in italian meatballs and it was even better. Will try it with the meatballs instead of stew meat next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was super delicious and will make again! I didn't add onion and I used cream of mushroom soup because it was what I had on hand. I used the rest of the ingredients in the recipe and also added half a package of onion soup and 1 bullion cube as suggested. I added canned mushrooms and the cream cheese 15 minutes prior and served it over egg noodles. In all honesty I never had stroganoff before but whatever I got was outstanding! thanks for sharing!

My husband (who is a huge fan of the Hamburger Helper beef stroganoff) absolutely raved about this!  I think I've converted him for good!  I followed the advice of MomSavedByGrace and thanks to the changes - this was an excellent dinner that we'll be making for years to come!

It was very good. I have been looking for a good beef stroganoff recipe for some time now. It was better than I expected. I do make all the reccomendations that were given. It was very helpful, I still found it a little runny so I think I will not add as much water to it next time. But this will surely be in my recipe book forever.  Thanks

This recipe served as a double duty dinner. I served out two portions of meat and sauce, just before adding the cream cheese, to be used as a stew. The addition of carrots and potatoes completed a supper for two people.

Delicious and easy slow cooker recipe!  I read JillyBean14's review and followed most of the recommendations she made, with the exception of adding a bouillon cube or half a packet of onion soup mix, simply because I didn't have either on hand.  With the modifications I made, my husband loved it.  He had it for dinner and then ate the leftovers until I made him throw them out.  Very delicious :)

This was very tasty! I am not a professional by no means but when I saw the 1/4 cup of water, I wondered what I could do to make it better. So I looked around and I saw I had beef broth. I substituted it instead of water and I added mushrooms to the mix and it turned out wonderfully. MOM tested, FAMILY approved!!

(1) add salt, pepper, and garlic,  (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same,  (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all,  (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low,  (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang" 6) add a half packet of onion soup mix,  7) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.

Wow!!  Couldn't believe how great this meal was!  My husband & kids couldn't stop eating it.  I followed most of Jillybean14's suggestions, but didn't have all the ingredients, so I improvised.  I pretty much followed the ingredients list as marked in the original recipe, but added salt, pepper & garlic powder to the meat (1.5 lbs stew meat).  Cooked on low for 5 hours.  Added 1 beef bouillion cube, along with the cream cheese.  Served over egg noodles.  Delish!!

This was excellent.  Cooked on high for 5 hrs and low for 2 hrs.  Doubled the recipe and added some red wine.  Added cream cheese and sour cream to the meat.  Served over mashed potatoes and noodles with some cheesy cauliflower on the side.  Will make again.

**** 5 stars,   I used veal instead of beef, I used Marsala wine instead of water, I added fresh mushrooms, It was fantastic!  To the reviewer who is annoyed at people like me who modify the recipe and report results, too bad for you!  I use what I have in the house, or what is on sale. works for me.

I read a few of the reviews and would have followed those recomendations but did not have all the ingredients, so my version is closer to the original.  I used: 1)  condensed potatoe soup (because hubby does not like mushrooms) 2)  used onion powder (because I did not have an oniion) 3) 1 tbs Worchtershire (as original) 4) beef boullion cubes (as some recommended) 5) 4 oz cream cheese (as original) 6) Added salt, pepper and garlic powder (this was just logical to me)  Cooked for 5 hours on low.  Turned out great!!!!!  Thanks for posting!

We really enjoyed this version of beef stroganoff.  Next time I will use sour cream rather than cream cheese as I prefer the sour cream flavor.  Adding the mushrooms at the end was a great idea; they really cook down though so err on the side of adding more rather than less.

delicious! After reading several reviews, I made the following changes- I added baby bella mushrooms in the crock pot, doubled the meat and soup, kept cream cheese the same and added 1/2 cup of sour cream, and served over buttered egg noodles. My family has already requested that I make this again!

This was yummy.  Already gave out the recipe to someone I made it for.  I doubled the sauce, added baby carrots and small red potatoes served over egg noodles.  For the big people, I added a habenero finishing salt to spice it up.  Wow!

I wanted to try something other than my tried-and-true, very simple recipe that Mama used to make. I was SO not loving the golden mushroom thing! After the first meal, I did not eat the rest. Maybe this is what others grew up with for Beef Stroganoff, but I did not care for this. Usually I don't write negative reviews...but I don't want others misled like I was. Sorry, Jessica...

This is so good! I was close to getting rid of my slow cooker because I had yet to find a recipe we liked to make in it. This was so easy and I look forward to making it again. I cooked it on high for 5 hours and added fresh mushrooms for the last hour. Yum! Yum! Love it!

This was excellent. I doubled everything except the cream cheese. I did not have onion so I used a pkg. of the Lipton Onion Soup Mix and added a dollop of sour cream with the cream cheese as suggested. Will definitely be making this again, very easy recipe. I served it over Whole Wheat Noodles.

This was a very good recipe with added changes. Without changes a little bland.

I added two cans of mushroom soup instead of one.
2 lbs. of beef instead of one
1tsp. of onion powder
6 oz. of sliced mushrooms
1 beef bouillon cube
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup of sour cream along with the cream cheese

Many reviewers added onion soup mix, but I was out, next time I'll give that a try. My husband said that the recipe was a keeper!

I took suggestions of others and improvised in my own ways as well. Wow!  What a flavorful dish.  I thought that this was packed full of flavor and was delicious. MY ALTERATIONS: #1 I doubled the recipe keeping cream cheese and worch.sauce measurments the same. #2 I also added Salt,Pepper,Garlic and since I only had one can of golden mushroom soup (and I was doubling) I used Cream of Chicken for my second can.  You would never know.  
#3 Added 2 Heaping Tbsp Sour Cream
Add A Bullion Cube
Add 1/2 Packet of Onion Soup Mix
#4 I also used chicken instead of Beef.  I cooked my cubed chicken in a pan with 2 Tbsp Oil and seasoned it with garlic pwdr, onion pwdr, salt,pepper,cayenne and steak seasoning.  The meat was a wonderful compliment to the sauce and egg noodles.
I definitely will be remaking this dish.  Thanks so much for the recipe and thanks to those that gave other flavor suggestions.

Good recipe.  I made a couple of changes: I use Beef Broth in place of the water and used sour cream in place of the cream cheese (since that's what I had).  Served it over brown rice... yummy.

Wonderful, easy recipe!  I made the recipe exactly according to the directions and it turned out great.  The meat was sooo tender.  I served it over egg noodles and with a side salad and a bottle of red wine.  While it's not the prettiest of dishes, it is sure one of the tastiest.  I will definitely make this again, only I will add a carton of sliced fresh mushrooms next time.

Ok, as another reviewer said, this recipe is NOT five stars, however, the recipe created with all the alterations may well be worthy of it.  But it is not the recipe listed.  Rating a recipe based on severe modifications made by you and not the exact recipe isn't fair.  

I made this recipe twice, one with the exact recipe and one with the recommended modifications.  The original recipe is very bland, it just needed something. You can tell by the recipe itself there is a lack of spice and seasoning. I do love the idea of cream cheese in it though, it made it very creamy.  The modified stroganoff was excellent and I do recommend people try it. Do exactly what is told in the reviews. Just don't come back here and rate the dish you made, because it's not the author's recipe.

Ok, first of all...the reviewers who hated this recipe and said it didn't taste like stroganoff, confused me.  What kind of stroganoff have YOU been eating?  This recipe is amazing!!!  You MUST follow Jillybean14's directions though, also add 4oz sr cream along with everything else and 2 packages fresh mushrooms, OH and use 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup beef broth.  I am the pickiest eater in the world and this is the best stroganoff I've ever had!  My boyfriend and father also agreed.  my boyfriend said it was the best thing he has ever eaten!  I added 2 tblsp butter and parsley to the egg noodles before serving as well.
I wasn't sure about the Golden Mushroom soup.  it had a tomato base and didn't smell like stroganoff to me.  I added the sour cream and cream cheese, and  It became stroganoff!  Definitely use the condensed Golden mushroom soup.  It has so much flavor!  Trust me, with Jillybeans additions and 4 oz sr cream with extra mushrooms this dish is exquisite!

This is SO good and really "week-day meal friendly" since I can make it in the crock pot.  I doubled the meat and soup and added a little garlic. The sauce was really thin, so, after cooking I poured the sauce into a frying pan on the stovetop and added the cream cheese and a spoonful of sour cream.  After that is combined I dissolved 1 tbsp. of cornstarch into 2 tbsp. of water and added to the mixture.  I heated until it was the desired consistency I liked and then added the meat back into the sauce and served.  My husband doesn't like egg noodles so I have served this over white rice or garlic mashed potatoes.  This is real comfort food to me!

I was really disappointed in this one.  I followed ALL of the suggestions given by others, and it still didn't turn out.  For one, the cream cheese was a bad idea-I won't make that mistake again.  It never fully incorporated with the rest of the sauce and wasn't smooth.  I'm glad I was home to watch this one because it kept wanting to burn, even on low.  Not sure what else I can do to make this one work.  Will stick with recipe I normally use for stroganoff.

Oh my gosh...so, so easy and really, really good.  I followed the recipe but made a few changes.  I used stew meat that was cut in thin strips (found it at the grocery store and thought it would be perfect...and it was!) and browned it before I put it in the crock pot.  I doubled everything EXCEPT the meat.  Served over noodles with fresh corn on the cobb, seasoned green beans and Cherry Pie III from all recipes! Really simple dinner and Ohhhhhh, sooooo good!

I've made this a few times and its always come out wonderful!  But I don't make it in a crock pot.  I use (important b/c stew meat toughens up) Sirloin Steak cut into chunks, saute with onion, garlic, sliced fresh mushrooms and salt and pepper, stir in the golden mushroom soup, water, and worchestershire sauce and let simmer until the meat is tender.  Then stir in the cream cheese at the end.  I serve over lightly buttered noodles.  Doesn't take very long and its awesome!  If you do not use the golden mushroom soup, it will not be the same.  It cracks me up how people always substitute different ingredients and can't understand why it didn't come out.  DUH!

I am not a huge fan of stroganoffs, but this one was pretty good. Definitely enjoyed the golden mushroom flavor. Added sauteed mushrooms and a bit of sour cream with the cream cheese. Served over egg noodles.

My very picky husband asks me to make this recipe often.  He even told someone at work and asked me to pass it on.  It's nice and simple and I can have it ready to go before I leave in the morning.  I have added some extra mushrooms, and put in more beef than called for.  The cream cheese stirs in better if cubed first.

update 06/17/2015:  in an effort to get dinner on the table in 5 minutes after we walked in the door I added the cream cheese in with the soup and other ingredients (I heated it up a little) it worked wonderfully, nice and thick, but that way it could use two cans of soup.

I made this for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it.  I did change a couple of things; I added 1 lb of sliced mushrooms, I used 1.5 lbs of beef stew meat and instead of regular cream cheese, I used herb and garlic.  We really enjoyed this and will make it again.

I thought this was great! I added some extras a splash of Red wine vinegar,about 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix instead of real onion, garlic lots of salt & pepper. I doubled the recipe and towards the end added 8 ounces of cream cheese onion and chive.. soo good! next time I will make sure to have some type of bread/rolls to dip in sauce.

My husband really liked this, so I'll give it 4 stars, but I personally thought it was too rich and salty.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It had good flavor, but I think the cream cheese was just a bit "too much" for me.  Also, be very careful what size crockpot you use for this.  Mine was too big (I have a 6 quart size) and it cooked too quickly.  I turned it down to warm for most of the afternoon, then back up to low in the last half an hour before I added the cream cheese.  Definitely calls for a smaller sized crock pot.

Great recipe!  Very tasty & easy to make.  I browned the meat w/flour & used the bits of good stuff on the bottom of the pan & cooked the onions (1 whole onion) and tomato paste in the pan until it was deglazed..added a bit more beef broth (not water) than added & a little sour cream as well.  Will definitely make again!

We love this, I have made this now maybe 8 times and we really like it.  I do put in it fresh mushrooms but other then that its excellent just the way it is.  I have tried it with sour cream also but for us we really enjoy the cream cheese.  Thanks for the great (and easy) recipe!

This is an easy and really delicious recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  I'm embarrassed to say that my husband and I ate nearly the whole pot in one sitting.  I better double it next time so we can have some leftovers!  Also, I'll probably add some fresh mushrooms next time since we're both big mushroom fans.  But, the recipe is definitely a success as is!

We really enjoyed this. Not only did it taste good but it was so easy to make! I might try sour cream instead of the cream cheese next time as I had little white flakes of unmelted cream cheese in the end. Tasted great, just not too appealing to the eye.

I made this today and it was GREAT!  I followed the suggestions that are echoed throughout many users here: 1) doubled soup 2) used both cream cheese (3 oz) and about 1/4c sour cream 3) added sauteed fresh mushrooms the last 30mins (could add earlier...I was running late) and 4) used a packet of onion soup mix in place of onion.  Next time I think I'll try the actual onion or just use half of the onion soup mix as most users have noted.  I also used all beef broth and no water. The flavor was great to me, but my husband thought it was a little overpowering so half the soup mix would be more than fine. There were enough flavors from everything else that made this taste great.  I served ours over rice and I'm sure this tastes just as great over the egg noodles.  I added just a bit of nutmeg to it when first putting it in the crock....I'd say about two shakes and that was it. Gave it a little "hmmmmm??" taste.  I liked it.  This is a great recipe and I'll make it again for sure.

This was the best beef stroganoff that I have ever had.  I did make the same substitutions as others had: 2 cans of soup, 1 can of mushrooms, 2 pounds of beef, and beef broth instead of the water.  I did add some cream cheese at the end, but I think it was fine even without the cream cheese.  I may just use sour cream next time because the cream cheese was a little lumpy even though I had let it come to room temp.  Wonderful and very easy...

This is absolutely fabulous! I told my boyfriend he needed to get a slow cooker, but he didn't believe me, so I took my mom's over to his place and made this.  It was both of our days off, so all I did was chuck all the ingredient, except the cream cheese into the crock pot and off we went.  When we got home the apartment was filled with lovely smells (usually thet are comming from someone else's!).  I chucked the cream cheese in and turned in down on low and covered it.  By the time our show was of it was ready.  The beef get so tender and I really like the cream cheese more than the usual sour cream also.

We wanted leftovers so I doubled the recipe.  Wow am I glad I did, the leftovers are just as good if not better!  Could not find golden mushroom soup mix so substituted regular cream of mushroom instead and it came out great.  I in advertently added the cream cheese when I initially mixed the ingredients so it was in there the whole 8 hours.  It didn't seem to have an adverse affect on the end product.

Fantastic recipe!  We loved it!  My husband just raved and raved! I used 1 1/2 lbs. stew beef, but next time I'll use more and double the gravy recipe. This was awesome for dipping nice fresh bread into!  I used reg. cream of mushroom soup combined with a 1/2 can Campbells condensed French Onion Soup, 1/2 packet Lipton Golden Onion dry Soup Mix, a generous splashing of marsala wine (as that's all I had on hand...ran out of cooking wine as well as the real stuff).  I like Worcestershire, so I added more than called for.  The cream cheese was wonderful, I used Neufchatel or light cream cheese, and a couple of tablespoons of low fat sour cream, and a dash or two of Wildtree Herbs' brand Onion and Chive seasoning blend.  Wonderful flavor and texture.  Served over hot egg noodles with fresh broccoli on the side.  Mmmmmmmmm!

Like others, I also used red wine instead of water and sour cream instead of cream cheese.  I added garlic too and chopped portabello mushrooms. It was great and will be my new beef stroganoff recipe!

I read the review and the first review was very helpful.  Doubling the sauce is a must as well as the beef cubes.  I add a splash of sherry and add sauteed mushrooms and a dallop of sour cream 1/2 hour before serving.

This is excellent served over wide egg noodles.  I don't use cream cheese however, I feel that it tastes better with sour cream.  Also I use 1/4 cup red cooking wine for the water, 98% fat free condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom soup, and one package of Lipton Onion soup mix for the onion.  This does not make enough for four servings...it makes enough for my boyfriend and me.  This is easily a keeper!

I love this recipe!  It was easy to prepare and more affordable than other recipes I have tired.  We are big on mushrooms around here, so I added 4 oz of fresh mushrooms.  I will definitly keep this recipe around!!  It will come in handy with our busy life.

I am fairly new to crock pot cooking and tried this recipe because of all the great reviews.  It was fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was increase the water to a cup because I have a fairly long commute to/from work, so it cooked for 12 hours and I didn't want it to get burnt or dried out.  It made a really nice gravy/sauce and I served it over egg noodles.  YUM!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I love slow cooker recipes, and this one did not disappoint.  I did not have on hand any cream cheese, nor any golden mushroom soup, so of course, I improvised with sour cream, and some cream of mushroom soup.  I could definitely taste the worchestershire sauce in this one, but it was not overpowering, and in fact, this is the ingredient that lets you know you are eating straganoff.  The meat was succulent and delicious and the flavors melded together nicely.  Works very well for leftovers.  I have made more time intensive versions of stroganoff, and this one is just as impressive with little effort on your part.  I served mine with a nice salad, and it was a great meal.  Give it a try, it's good.

This is pretty good. Per other reviews I only added 3 oz cream cheese and a little sour cream. I also added a little red wine and sub onion soup mix. I also found the cooking time to be too long. I have since made it several times with shorter cooking times and the results have been better.

This is probably the best slow cooker meal I have made outside of a good pot of chili.  I did make one adjustment because of what I had on hand - I used creamed mushroom soup with roaster garlic instead of the golden.  It was very good.  Also I would suggest using softened cream cheese so that it mixes a little smoother and easier.  Whole family loved it!

I didn't like this at all.  I thought the cream cheese was just too much at the end. Althought, I still followed the recipe.  I also wasn't fond of the golden mushroom soup either.  My husband did like it, but unless he makes it I will not have it again.

This turned out great!  I did question the cream cheese, but I really liked the texture it gave.  Also, I added some cooking sherry to the recipe (no more than 1/4 cup) because I didn't think that it looked like there was enough water to cover the meat.

This was very easy to make in the crock pot, but I wasn't thrilled with the taste. I think it was the golden mushroom soup. If I made it again, I'd probably try cream of mushtroom soup.

Stroganoff does NOT get any easier than this.  A restaraunt near us serves a prime beef stroganoff that's wonderful, and still this beats it out by a mile.  Who would have thought cream cheese would make such a difference! Thanks for the submission!

Excellent, and so easy!  I used onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion like others did, and that made it even easier.  I also used the wine instead of the water, but think it made the overall taste a tad too strong.  Maybe I used a wine that was too dry.  I'll use water next time.  Makes 4 servings very generously!  I plan to make this many times.  Thank you!

I love to cook and find it difficult to find slow cooker recipes that I like.  This was excellent.  I added a pinch of salt, plenty of pepper and probably doubled the amount of Worcestershire, and doubled the amount of meat.  Plenty of tasty sauce with a perfect consistency.  My teenage daughter said it was one of her favorite meals that I have made.  I might try browning the meat next time to add the pan juices and carmelized flavor to the dish.

This recipe was highlighted in an email so I took a look. What I found was lots of 5-star ratings but they slammed the default recipe and everyone had their own version. I'm so stressed out after reading these reviews that I'm not even going to try this one.

Not a good recipe, even with doctoring.  Golden Cream of Mushroom is not good in this.  What does cream cheese add?  Nothing.

This was easy and delicious to put in the morning and have ready at the end of a busy work day. The only changes I made was to replace the cream of golden mushroom soup,(I dislike cream of anything soup) with a 12 oz package of frozen mushroom medley,and I used light whipped cream cheese. My picky husband even liked it,and asked for seconds. ;)

Made this a couple of times from JillyBean's changes. Family loves it! Used 3 small packages of stew meat (or one big and one small). (1) add salt, pepper, and 2 cloves garlic, (2) 2 cans golden mushroom and 1 can cream of mushroom. (3) Put it in the night before on low, (4) 1 table spoon Better Than Bullion (5) half packet of onion soup mix, (6) 1/2 can of water, because it did not look wet enough to last 20 hours. (7) serve over egg noodles. Will try to add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving and freezing the leftovers together.

I followed the directions of Jillbean14 and it came out great. Used two cans golden mushroom soup, a half packet of onion soup powder, and reduced cooking time to 6hrs on low kept everything else the same. I like to serve this over giant shell pasta as it holds maximum sauce. There is lots of room to play with this recipe. Enjoy!

As another reviewer wrote, don't bother making this recipe without the Golden Mushroom soup that it calls for. It is truly the secret ingredient that makes this stroganoff different from others. This is a wonderful recipe that turns out every single time. Yummy!

I used almost double (1.9 lbs) of stew meat & added about 6 oz of beef broth, substituted onion powder for onion, 8 oz cream cheese (instead of the 4) & left the water out & it turned out excellent. I may try a little sour cream next time (I was out), but it was really good like this!

I have never made stroganoff before. I decided to use 5 oz of cream cheese, instead of the 4 oz it calls for. WOW amazingly good!! Everyone loved it, and the house smelled great!

I pounded and browned 2lbs beef, S and P, 1 sautéed onion, 1 tsp. garlic and 1 cup chicken stock, 1 tsp Worcestershire at the start.  At the 4 hour mark on low I added 1/3 cup cream cheese, 1 pack dry onion soup, 1 tsp dry garlic pieces and simmered for 1 more hour.  Added sautéed large chunks of white mushrooms and 2 dollops of sour cream and served over wild rice.  It was delicious!  Just right for us.  Thanks All for your feedback

I make this about once every 2 weeks my kids love it....This is a classic base recipe...if you are looking for an alternative to a box meal this one is pretty good.  But like I said it is a base recipe you should taste it before you serve it and adjust the flavor profile to what you know you/your family will like...if it is too thick (cuz your crockpot cooks hot) add water/beef broth....if it lacks flavor add it...dont like cream cheese use sour cream....

My old recipe calls for tomato paste and has more of that flavor - this one is far simpler and delicious.  It's also ironically perfect for my husband who loves this dish but doesn't like mushrooms!  Season meat with Nature's and brown before putting in crockpot.  Add 1/2 tsp. garlic, chopped.  Substitute beef broth for the water and add 2 Tbs. sour cream. (I've also forgotten the cream cheese and substituted sour cream instead - very good!)

This sauce is so good! I did add the sour cream just because that is my preference. Also the 1/2 packet of onion soup mix. I thought that the meat was pretty bland so next time I will try and do something more with it before putting it in the crock pot. Didn't have egg noodles but rotini worked just as well. Will make this again!

It was ok as far as Stroganoffs go. Maybe if I had paid attention to the reviews and done all the tweaks that people made, it would have had more flavor. May use this recipe again, if I'm desperate for something different.

This is an easy meal to cook during the week.  I made too many noodles which overtook the cream of mushroom.  I enjoyed this recipe and have made this several times.  It's amazing to see what cream cheese will do to a recipe.

Excellent, except for the cream cheese. It does not mix in well, as creme fresh (or even sour cream). In fact, it ruined the dish.

I used my 6 qt crockpot and came home to find that half of my beef had burned because there wasn't enough liquid.  I did double the sauce as other reviewers had suggested, I used two cans of soup, half a cup or water, half a cup of onion and other seasonings.  I also added the boullion cube and found the sauce to be SO salty!  I will try this again but I will add at least one cup of water (possibly more) next time.  If you're going to follow this recipe as is or even if you're going to double the sauce use a crockpot that is smaller than 6 qt.  A 4 qt would probably be perfect!

I made all the substitution and additions suggested. It was ho-hum. The meat wasn't tender after 7 hours of cooking. The sauce was lacking something.

Followed jellybean14's recommendations, but I would not add the salt.  There is plenty of salt with the soups and soup mix. I also doubled the meat and used regular cream of mushroom and that was fine.  Good & easy meal.   Will make again

I added an extra can of golden mushroom soup, half a packet of dry onion soup mix, 3 teaspoons of minced garlic, generous amount of black pepper, a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms, and a dollop of sour cream at the end.  With those additions, it was delicious;  we had it over buttered noodles.

Very good taste.  I did as others suggested and added beef broth, a little onion soup mix, garlic and dollop of light sour cream.  I also added just a little red wine.  Have made twice and my husband loves.  And as working gal, love having dinner just about ready when done.

Ive made some alterations to this recipe, instead of water and chopped onion I use a cup of french onion soup for every 2 cans of golden mushroom (two cans for every pound of meat). I also add 2 cloves of garlic, crushed as well as salt, pepper and basil. And use half sour cream half cream cheese. Ive gotten so many complements on it, and its perfect for when you have guests over! I always make a bunch because people are dying for seconds.

Everyone loved it !  I followed another reviewer and added a dollop of sour cream in addition to the cream cheese to add tang and used the golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I think you could reduce the amount of cream cheese and it would still be great.

I also doctored up this recipe based on reviews by adding wine, beef broth, etc., cooked it in the crock pot and ate it over noodles. My family enjoyed it and the leftovers were scarfed up. Banner day and great recipe!

I have to agree with those who thought the recipe as written needed a bit of tweaking. My variations: added another tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, plus a tablespoon of crushed garlic, along with a drained can of mushrooms, two packets of Swanson Flavor Boost, and some pepper.

Good concept that does call for some adjustments, but worth making again, especially if I do a multiple batch to freeze.

The whole family really liked this. The only variation I made was using onion and chive cream cheese instead of plain. It's all I had at the time.  Overall, super easy and delicious!

This was delicious! I doubled it so we could have leftovers. I made it exactly no substitutions. It was super easy to put together. I was a bit nervous about the cream cheese, thinking it would be too rich,  but there was no other fat in the recipe, the golden mushroom is a low fat soup so I gave it a try. It was very smooth and creamy, I think I should have let the cream cheese come to room temperature because I had a hard time getting it all to "melt" even though I added it in pieces. Will make again.

There is a cheese spread made by Rondele.  One of the flavors is Garlic and Herb.  I find adding that to soup and recipes like this one is great.

Not a good recipe unless you make all the adjustments listed in the reviews.  A recipe should not receive this high rating when you have to sift thru all the reviews as to why.  Thanks JillyBean for doing the work for us.  Also, you nead paprika and lots of garlic for any decent stroganoff.  Very disappointing.

Simple and quick. Easy to get ready in the morning for a busy night. I used Cream of mushroom when I couldn't find golden mushroom soup and it works well too. I also add mushrooms.

Instead of stew meat I used ribeye steak and cut it up. The flavor was on the bland side. I expected a little more tastiness.

I cooked this for a friend who is suffering from a debilitating disease.  She LOVED it.  Said she was going to "put her face" into the reheated leftovers and just gobble.  I'm so glad I tried it, and so grateful for all of the advice on changes.

This was excellent.  A few things.  I think 1 pound of stew meat does not make enough for 4 servings.  This was more like a generous 2 servings or a medium 3 servings.  So I plan to make this again, but will buy more meat next time so that I have more meat to serve and not so much left over, unused sauce.  This is a recipe I plan to make and share because it was easy, delicious and smelled so wonderful while it was cooking.  Next time I will throw in some sauteed mushrooms.

Super easy. My husband came back for thirds!  The meat was extremely tender.  

I added some rehydrated mushrooms in last 15 minutes with the cream cheese. Used the slow cooker seasoning packet instead of the worhshire.

Like others have said, if you modify this recipe you shouldn't rate it with your modifications. As written this recipe isn't all that good, yet, it's rating high.... I made modifications similar to Jessilynn who reviewed it on Oct 15 2008. Here's my recipe (with modifications made to simplify it even more). 

INGREDIENTS:
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat or chuck roast 
2 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup 
1 cooking onion (chopped)
1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
1/2 cup low sodium beef stock (more if needed) 
1 package French onion soup mix  
1 teaspoon dehydrated minced garlic
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 can sliced mushrooms (drained)
2 ounces cream cheese (reduced fat works well)
1/3 cup sour cream
Pat of butter 
DIRECTIONS:
1. In slow cooker, combine meat, mushroom soup, chopped onion, Worcestershire, stock, dry soup mix, garlic, pepper and dill weed. 
2. Cook on low setting for 5-6 hours, stirring occasionally. 
3. Add canned mushrooms in slow cooker during the last 30 minutes of cooking time. 
4. Add cream cheese and sour cream just before serving allowing it to warm through.
5. Check sauce for seasoning. 
6. Best served over buttered egg noodles.

I read the popular reviews and tweaked the recipe by adding salt, pepper, garlic, onion soup mix, fresh mushroom, beef broth and sour cream. Quite a few changes! But everyone got seconds and loved it.

With some of the suggested variations, this recipe was OK. However, I'm glad I checked the meat after 3 hours because it was already cooked through and getting tough by then.

This was so good and easy to make! I followed the reviewers suggestions and it came out perfect! I wrote down the alterations so I do not have to scour the reviews again when I want to make it. Whew, there are a lot of reviews! I served fresh sauted mushrooms over it and it was awesome! I used london broil that I thick sliced and it cooked nicely, some pieces did fall apart. I could not find golden mushroom soup, so I just used cream of mushroom and it worked well. I will definately make this again!!

Super easy and pretty darn tasty! Cooked it just as the recipe instructed. Even my husband that doesn't really care for beef stroganoff enjoyed it. He said he liked it because the sauce wasn't as "soupy" as what he had before. My only issue was that I would have liked more sauce. I think next time, I'll add another can of soup.

This was a good recipe.  I added garlic, salt, pepper, and half a package of onion soup mix.  It was still missing something.  Maybe fresh mushrooms, so I'll try that next time.

I started this before going to work.  I read many of the reviews and doubled the stew meat, used the soup mix in lieu of the chopped onions, and sea salt.  I used regular cream of mushroom soup since we're not mushroom eaters.  This was so easy that my husband finished cooking it, adding the cream cheese and a few tbsp sour cream.  My 4 and 5 1/2 year olds ate adult sized portions.  I reheated it after work and it was great!  We froze the rest for another night since it was so good my husband, who doesn't like leftovers, actually wanted to save it for another night.  Absolutely will be made again!

I doubled the sauce and it still burned in the crock pot. I also added sauteed mushrooms right before serving. It was okay.

I've made this before and had wonderful results! I decided to make it again today and I made the necessary changes as suggested by Jillybean again. I doubled the recipe but it came out a bit salty... I should have been more cautious!

Used cut up round steak.  It was good and tender. The kids ate it plain we had it over mashed potatoes. Used maybe 2 oz cream cheese and 1 lg tbls sour cream.  Had to add more water.

Awesome! I tenderized the meat with a powdered meat tenderizer so I didn't add salt. I added chives, a packet of onion soup mix and in addition to the golden mushroom soup I added a can of beefy mushroom as well and doubled the water. I also added minced garlic and chives. At the end i added 3 tbl spoons of flour. The other change I made was I used half cream cheese and half sour cream. It was sooo delicious! I can't wait to make it again!

Wonderful! It gets rave reviews every time and is so easy! A dollop of sour cream at the end does make it a little better, but without it, it's still wonderful.

I'm not sure what went wrong.  I left the meat in the crockpot all day, which ended up being closer to 10 hours (that's probably the issue).  When I stirred in the cream cheese, the meat fell apart and shredded.  It was a creamy, salty mess.

This was a good, fast, and easy recipe but didn't have that authentic stroganoff flavor.  I would probably opt to make from scratch with fresh herbs but if short on time, this is still a good recipe.

this recipe is great.  I've made it twice now.  The first time i followed recommendations to use Golden Mushroom condensed soup (2 cans) and kept the cream cheese amt the same.  The second time I used left over pot roast meat from the night before and was able to skip out on the slow cooker part.  Instead I sauteed fresh mushrooms, added 2 cans Golden Mushroom soup, and only 2 oz cream cheese.  Since my pot roast meat was extra salty, I opted to throw in some milk.  In the end, my husband loved it both times and even told me that it tasted like real stroganoff!

We had a visitor when I made this and he loved them.  I added a couple tablespoons of sour cream at the end.  I like to cook extra when I cook to freeze some and this froze and reheated very well.  The only thing I would do different next time is either to mix in in the pasta before freezing instead of spooning it on top or I would cook the pasta seperately.

A 5 star recipe should not need improvement.  Without the additions the others had made, this recipe would be just ok, 3 stars.  I don't understand why people give 5 stars but completely change the recipe, just make a new one.

Only 3 stars (or less) as written... I've never seen or heard of golden mushroom soup, so I found a brand that makes a roasted garlic mushroom soup, so I used that. When I began adding the cream cheese and first tasted it (I had only added about a 1/3 of the called for amt) it tasted awful! I stopped putting cream cheese in, luckily I had sour cream to replace it with! Also, was missing a real beefy flavor so I added a pkt of beefy onion soup mix and some beef boullion dissolved in water and corn starch, because it was really runny. I hope this helps someone get this recipe right!

This recipe is always a part of our monthly dinner rotation.  I use sour cream instead of the cream cheese.  I just like it better that way.  I put if over mashed potatoes, and everyone LOVES it.

I love beef stroganoff, and so does my husband, but this was a first try for the kids.  Unfortunately the sauce had TOO much of a mushroomy taste and the kids didn't like it.  Sometimes I can sneak mushrooms past my kids in recipes...but it definitely shone through on this recipe.  I enjoyed it though...but it probably won't make it into the rotation though.  Thanks for sharing!!

This continues to be my kids' all time favorite meal.  Yes, I make the additions but I would have never found this in the first place without the original recipe so thank you!  (and thanks for those extra comments regarding the additions!)

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  We put the meat and sauce over jasmine rice instead of egg noodles.  Excellent flavor! This will be a go to recipe in my kitchen :-)

Tasty recipe. I doubled the recipe and added fresh mushrooms and onion soup mix since I omitted the salt. Since I couldn't find golden mushroom soup (and didn't want to shop around for it), I used cream of mushroom soup instead and it still turned out great. SOO easy to make - and the aroma throughout the house was awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

OH MY GOSH! Fantastic. And a crock pot meal!! I really wanted to try the recipe as is but there were so many good ideas to spice it up a bit that I couldn't refrain. However, the base of this recipe is 5 stars in my book, the added twists, a dollop of sour cream, sauteed mushroom, and an extra can of soup just put it over the top! Try it!!

I've made this a few times and really enjoy it (It's painfully easy and a great cold-day dinner!). I'd rate this 5 stars with the folling adjustments: I add 1- 8oz package of sliced white mushrooms; 1-large sweet onion, sliced; I use 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom to be health conscious. Per others' suggestions, I added the 1/2 packet French onion soup mix, and it made a BIG difference!

I followed this recipes almost as written. I doubled the water and golden mushroom soup (I like the gravy). I did add sauteed mushrooms the last 30 minutes of cooking. this dish had amazing flavor and it was so easy. I will be adding this to the rotation of favorites.

This is so simple and easy to make. We have make this twice now and the only thing I added was some extra mushrooms. Also make certain you use the Golden Mushroom soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom. Trust me we have tried both versions. Also double the recipe as the leftovers are wonderful. It goes great over toast or noodles. Thanks for sharing.

The flavor was missing something.  The texture of the meat and consistency of the sauce was good, but it needed something to kick up the flavor.

It tasted ok like something you would get from the freezer section instead of a nice homemade meal. Making stroganoff from scratch is not much work, and tastes ten times better.

I've been wanting to try a stroganoff recipe for a long time. Both my husband and I are not really fans of beef stroganoff in the first place, but since this recipe got 5 stars from so many people, I figured this was the one to try. As far as stroganoff goes, it was ok. Just not our cup of tea.

I took some advice from other reviewers and tweaked this a bit:
- I lightly floured the meat and then browned it first
- I added some minced garlic
- I used cream of mushroom soup (2 cans) since that's all I had
- I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire
- I added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix
- I cooked on low for 6 hours

Great results! I served it with egg noodles nad it was amazing.

I hate to give a shotty review but the reason is because the slow cooker breaks the ground beef down to tiny bits and makes my recipie less creamy and more soupy. I find that when made in a regular pot for about 2 hours makes for a creamier, chunkier and all around yummier stroganoff.

This was really good and sooooo easy. Taking suggestions from the other reviewers I doubled the meat, used 2 cans of the soup, 1/2 cup low sodium beef broth instead of the water, and a dollop of sour cream. I would not add any salt until you are ready to add the cream cheese.  Cooking on low for about 6 hours and then another 1/2 hour to let the cream cheese melt worked great.

i took the suggestion and added a french onion soup packet and it was way too salty with the cream of mushroom soup. I did also add sour cream and not the cream cheese. In my opinion, this was not the best recipe. I'd give it 6 out of 10 if I had to rate it that way. with some tweaking, it could be very good, but this time, not so much.

Meh. It's easy, yes, but bland. I wonder why cream cheese instead of the usual sour cream in stroganoff? I might try this again with sour cream, but the cream cheese just didn't quite work in terms of texture or flavor. I served it over egg noodles. The meat was very good, but overall the dish lacked flavor.

Excellent, easy recipe.  Could not find Golden Mushroom soup so I used regular.  I also added sliced, fresh mushrooms.  This is a winner!

Super easy to follow, and it turned out delicious.  I added a little more Worcestershire sauce and about a 1/4 cup more onions.

The best Stroganoff ever. The meat is nice and tender, the flavor and the consistency is great. I did add some mushrooms. A+

I made this recipe and it was not good. It was so bland. I made it doing the modifications that others suggested, still didn't taste that great and the sodium content was 10 days worth!  Plus, all those time consuming modifications and there is a simple solution. I was going down an aisle in the supermarket and saw McCormick's Slow Cookers Beef Stroganoff seasoning packet and tried it.  Only thing I did was add cream cheese in addition to the sour cream (it isn't beef stroganoff w/o sour cream!). I also made this with ground beef and chicken breast..all three were delicious! I couldn't believe the teeny tiny packet had so much flavor. Try it and I swear you will love it!

I made the recommended adjustments. I added garlic, extra onion, used beef broth instead of water, added half a packet of onion soup mix, and used sour cream instead of cream cheese. It turned out flavorful. However, I think 8 hours was a little too long. The meat was a little over cooked in my opinion. I think 6 hours would be better.

So easy to prepare and has become one of our favorite dinners! I pretty much stick to the recipe, but do use more Worcestershire because I usually have more than a pound of meat, add a can of beef broth, and garlic salt and pepper. I add in the cooked egg noodles after the 8 hours, then  stir in the cream cheese until melted and a bag of steamed peas for a complete dinner. Delicious!

Tasty!  Used regular cream of mushroom (couldn't find Golden Mushroom), but will try that next time.  Added 1/2 cup onion, 1/2 packet of onion soup mix, 1 tsp beef boullion.  Cooked on low for 4 hours, then on high for 45 minutes before added sauteed mushrooms and 4 oz cream cheese.  Served over rigatoni.

I double all the sauce ingredients and added a can of mustrooms and about 2T of sour cream with the cream cheese. It was amazing. Even my picky daughter that hates mushrooms had seconds. Was super easy to throw together before work and made the house smell amazing when I got home from work. Will totally make again.

Excellent recipe with the modifications as listed by others (add onion soup mix, double the soup, double the meat, use both sour cream & cream cheese).  I cooked on high for approx. 4 hours and it was more than ready to eat.  Thanks for submitting.

This is probably the best stroganoff I've ever made/had.  I tweaked it a bit - sauteed the onions with a can of mushrooms and browned the stew beef before putting it in the pot.  I also used sour cream instead of cream cheese because I had some on hand.  The meat turned out VERY tender - even my picky teenage daughter liked it!

This was very filling I will double the recipe next time we all enjoyed it very much. I will however add some green pepper next time. The only thing I did differently was skillet fry the meat a little before adding it to the crock and a little extra (whats this here sauce) folks call it Worcestershire up north. All in all very easy and tasty.

Super yummy!

I continue to make this every couple weeks and still love it. We have tried sautéing the steak, onions and mushrooms as well and that just intensifies the flavor. Excellent recipe!!!!

Interestingly I made this recipe last night and I found it on a Weight Watchers website.  The minor differences were regular cream of mushroom soup, 1 can water, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1 tsp salt, and half an onion.  The recipe called for sour cream, which I did not have, so I also used 4 ozs.. neuchatel (light cream cheese).   I cooked it four hours on high and the last 15 minutes I turned it to low and added the cream cheese. The house smelled fantastic and the recipe is a "keeper."

I don’t usually eat beef stroganoff, and I’ve never cooked it before. This recipe looked so easy that I had to try it. I don’t like mushrooms or onions, so I used a can of cream of celery soup and a spoonful of garlic salt instead (just a regular spoon, not a measuring spoon, so probably almost a teaspoon). I also tossed in a bouillon cube based on some reviews. It cooked while I slept, and then I took it to work for lunch. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti noodles because that’s what I had on-hand. I probably didn’t have to add the cream cheese since it was already creamy from the soup, but I suppose that gave it a little extra zing. It was really good & super easy. Maybe it was a tiny bit salty, but I like salt, and I knew it would be by adding the extra bullion and the garlic salt. I didn’t even defrost the beef strips before putting them in the crock pot, which made me really happy (I’m impatient about defrosting)… the only issue was that it was a little difficult to fit that frozen brick of chopped beef into my 2 quart stoneware crock, ha! I’ll be making this again.

This was good, just wish the meat would have kept some flavor to it.  I've alway had that problem when cooking with a crockpot though.  We all ate it up, even my 8 year old.  Served over multi-grain egg noodles :)

Me and hubby both loved this!!  I wanted to keep eating until I exploded!!!  I took a few suggestions and mixed them up.  1st, I browned the beef 1st (salted and peppered), I just have an issue with throwing meat raw into the crockpot.  2nd, I added 1/2 a package of onion soup mix, 8oz of sauteed mushrooms, and did 1/2 cream cheese  and 1/2 sour cream.  Served over buttered parsley egg noodles.  It was delicious!!!!

I made a few changes: I used 2 cans of condensed golden mushroom soup, a little pepper, half a packet of onion soup mix, and I used 3/4 cup of beef broth instead of water.  I also browned the meat before adding (it was so much more tender and flavorful), and I added a dollup of sour cream at the end of cooking.  I'm sure there are better stroganoff recipes out there, but this one is pretty good.

This gets five stars because of the other reviewers suggestions-I used London broil cut into cubes, 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, 1/2 packet of dry onion soup mix, 1 1/4 cup beef broth, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire and 4 ounces of cream cheese. I eliminated the onion, and salt and pepper. Served it over egg noodles and my husband and I loved it. Excellent.

Uh... muh... gawd!!  This was exceptionally delicious and out-of-this-world tasty!!!!  I followed the advice of the first 4 reviewers, and SO glad I did.  I never really like beef stroganoff.  I keep thinking of excuses to make this again though.  I cooked it for 5.5 hours, and just had it sit on 'keep warm' setting for about 4 more hours- perfect!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe Jessica!!!

This was excellent!  Family loved it.  I used Beefy Mushroom soup instead of golden, just a preference of mine, and since it was already 'beefy', I backed off the Worcestershire sauce.  This is delicious!

I loved this recipe! I took other reviewers suggestions of substituting 1/2 cup onion with 1 pkg of dried onion soup.  Instead of water used 1 can of Beef Consume.  I added some garlic powder and some onion flakes.  Also added sour cream with the cream cheese! The family loved it! I can't wait to make it again!  I think I'll double it next time! YUM YUM YUM!!!!

This was so simple and easy I was in shock. I would say for sure make sure that you use the golden mushroom soup ot makes all the differnece. I added a tad bit of garlic, cuz we love it and forgot the onion and they didn't seem to care. I served it over egg noddles and what a dinner we had. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great with the modifications of doubling all the ingredients except cream cheese and worstershire.  I added sauted mushrooms in last 30 minutes, the 4 oz of cream cheese and a big dollap of sour cream.  I served it over mashed potatoes.  I used stew meat and but it up in small pieces.  On low for 3-4 hours was sufficient.  Great dish that was as good on day 2 as leftovers.

Have made this many many times and I absolutely love it. I did make a few changes or rather additions to make it a little better, IMO.   I usually double everything up since this makes great leftovers, but maybe use a little more onion. Instead of using water I use a beer such as a Porter or Stout. A good widely available choice would be Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout or Anchor Porter. Regionally Bell's Kalamazoo Stout (midwest), Deschutes Obsidian Stout (west), or Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter (east) are great choices. Just make sure it's not a hoppier stout such as Sierra Nevada. You want the malty flavors from the beer to add depth to the dish. Something such as Okocim Porter (a Baltic Porter) might be a good choice, though I have yet to try it myself.   In addition to the beer, I add a packet of onion soup, 3-4 cloves of garlic, a bit of Bisto beef gravy mix to thicken it up and add some extra flavor, a beef bouillon cube, and a little bit of sour cream at the end when I add the cream cheese.  FANTASTIC!

This was so GREAT~~~! I did it according to the directions. Added 1/4 cup water and 1/2 envelope of dry onion soup mix in addition to the golden onion. I doubled the recipe, used nice chuck stew pieces. I added a nice dollop of sour cream in addition to the cream cheese and served it over wide egg noodles. A real HIT!! Nice for a cold winter day.

I made this recipe exactly as it's written.  While it has potential, it was rather bland.  I would definitely recommend adding the bullion cube and onion soup mix!

The recipe in its original form was pretty good. However, like others, I had to change it up quite a bit in order to make it more flavorful. I added an extra can of golden mushroom and a packet of dry onion soup mix to the crock pot at the beginning as well as 2 cloves of garlic.  Near the end of the cooking time, I threw in a package of sliced mushrooms.  Before serving I added 8oz. sour cream in addition to the cream cheese to give it the tang that is expected when eating stroganoff. Overall, good recipe. Thanks!

Very good. I did add about half a teaspoon of salt and pepper, and a teaspoon of garlic powder. I also let the cream cheese mix and cook in it for about 10mins before serving over some egg noodles. Very good. I'll make this again. Maybe add in some mushrooms to the mix next time.

Good base recipe, but as usual I had to tweak it to fit what I had in the pantry. I used 2lbs of beef cube steak, one can of beefy mushroom soup, one bag of Westpac's frozen seasoning blend (onions, celery, etc) about two cups of water and two beef bullion cubes. I cooked everything on low for about 8-9 hours while I was away at work. When I got home I drained most of the liquid into a large stock pot. I added additional water to the stock pot and set it to boil on the stove. Meanwhile I added a package of fresh sliced baby bellas and 8 oz. of cream cheese to the beef mixture in the crockpot. I boiled linguine noodles in the stock pot and then served them under the stroganoff. Delicious!

Very good.  The meat is a little different from what I think of as stroganoff meat -- more fall-apart-y like stew meat, but I guess that's the effect of the slow cooker.  I followed most of the recommended changes except I don't think it's necessary to saute the mushrooms and add them at the end.  Putting sliced ones in raw at the beginning worked wonderfully.  I used two containers of them and loved it.

Very good. I added salt, pepper and little garlic powder. Based on other reviews, I also substituted 1/4 cup of water with 1/4 cup of beef stock and added about 4 tbs of sour cream.

After following JILLYBEAN14's shortcut to all the additions, this turned out great!  1 mistake on my part, forgot to thoroughly mix in the cream cheese.  I ended up with cream cheese chunks in my sauce!

This is some good eatin'!  I have four kids, ages 10 and under, and they love it as well. Can't beat a meal that tastes great and your kids will eat! I followed other reviews and added the following to the initial recipe: Salt and Pepper to Taste 1/2 packet of onoin soup mix Garlic - I use one clove chopped Many use bullion, but I found that it makes the recipe very salty.  Double the sauce, except for the worcestershire and cream cheese. I would also double the meat. One pound does not feed my family of six, one of whom is 18 months.  Serves over noodles and prepare to fall in love!

Sounds really good and its in the slow cooker as I type. However, the recipe assumes too much intuition. It does't even mention the noodles at all. Plus, the picture has mushrooms which are not included in the recipe. I always thought this dish is supposed to have mushrooms...

Wow this was amazing. My MIL who makes this was so impressed which was a real big compliment since Stroganoff is one of her specialties. I followed the suggestions of Jillybean14 except I did not add mushrooms at the end(not a huge mushroom fan) and I browned the meat making sure I dryed the meat  first, make sure the olive oil(2 tablespoons)  heats up a bit before adding the meat, I then set the meat aside and then browned the onions before combining it with the rest of the ingredients and back with the meat. The cream cheese and sour cream combo was divine. Thank You so much!

The taste of the condensed golden mushroom soup made it taste fake and artificial. Good if the only thing you want is to mitigate your hunger.

I followed other reviewers recommendations and added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix, beef bouillion, garlic powder, doubled the water and worchestershire, and dollup of sour cream.  This was awesome.  Not even a big fan of beef stroganoff but totally a keeper.  Can't wait to make again.  (someone probably just needs to make a new recipe with these recommendations...)

Made the first time with no adjustments and it was missing something.  Second time around I added half a packet of dry onion soup mix, dissolved 1 beef bouillon cube in the water, and last I added a large spoonful of sour cream at the very end.  WOW!  It took from kind of boring to the best thing I have ever eaten and I am a chicken fan.  Got to try this with changes and it will knock your socks off.

This was pretty good!  Doesn't make a lot of sauce but it was plenty for my family of 4.  I added some salt and pepper as well as garlic to add some flavor.  My 8 & 6 year old really enjoyed this.  Not your normal stroganoff, and that's why we enjoyed it!  Good over top of egg noddles and/or rice.  Yum!  Thanks for the super quick meal my family loved.

The five-star rating is for the modified version of this recipe.  I made this last night and it was fantastic!  I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the pot, doubled the soup and water, and added 1/2 envelope of dry onion soup.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

Easy quick meal. I suggest browning the meat before adding it to the crockpot. Add a dollap of sour cream to each serving.

Made this for the first time today. Yummy! Only thing I added was a few fresh mushrooms. Put it all in the crockpot, was out all day and when I came home all I had to do was add the cream cheese, cook some noodles, add a salad and instant dinner. This is a keeper!

Awesome comfort food!  I made some changes from other suggestions.  I used 2 golden mushroom soups and added 1/2 packet of french onion soup mix.  Kept everything else the same.  I forgot to put it in a crock pot so I seared the beef in flour and added it to the soup mix on low for 1.5 hours.  The beef was tender and delicious!

It was just okay. It got kinda burned, and the meat was just pulverized. I think I will stick to making my stroganoff w/o the slow cooker.

very good! I used a pound and a half of cubed stew meat. I browned the seasoned  meat before adding it into the slow cooker. I s&p and rubbed it with minced garlic for the seasoning. I doubled the sauce, kept the cream cheese the same, and added 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end. I cooked it on low for 6 hours and when I stirred it the meat fell apart in tiny pieces. It was really good!

This is so awesome and so easy.   I used red wine (merlot) in place of the water which is always delightful with red meat.  And just as a personal preference I used 4oz. of sour cream instead of cream cheese and also added parsley when adding the sour cream to make it look pretty.  Oh, and please add mushrooms or you will kick yourself. I served mine on rice but I can't wait to try on noodles.

Really delicious with the changes suggested by Jillybean. I used Beef Broth instead of boullion cube and waited until the end to add salt as I wasn't sure how salty this would be. I did add more pepper and salt at the end. I also used 1 cup of sour cream instead of cream cheese. I'll definitely make this again.

Very good.  I browned meat first & then put in cooker.  I used sour cream but just put a dollup on top, otherwise it melts in the sauce.  Had green beans , egg noodles & salad.  I will print this out as it is a saver.  I rate this a 5.

This was really delicious and so easy to put together.  I substituted the golden mushroom soup (don't have in the UK)  with cream of mushroom soup and added a tin of sliced mushrooms which i previously sauteed in a little butter.   Have cooked this several times now and my husband loves it.  Thank you Jessica!  Oh,  also added sherry instead of water as recommended by another reviewer.

Awesome.  Will cook again.  Did take others advice,2 cans of golden soup, broth instead of water, added onion soup mix, bullion cube and some fresh mushrooms.  Also a bit of sour cream when I added the cream cheese.  Delish over egg noodles.

Wow, the best stroganoff I've had! I don't usually eat red meat but decided to buy $5.00 worth stew meat (2.2 lbs) just for this recipe. I took others' advise and used beef boullion, added fresh garlic, eliminated onion and instead of sour cream, I added 1/4 C plain yogurt and 2 oz low fat cream cheese (it's soft straight from the fridge unlike the regular cream cheese). I also used healthy choice CREAM of mushroom soup and did NOT add any salt. I added 10-12 sliced white button mushrooms 1/2 h before I was planning to serve, but they needed another 30 min to be as soft as we like them. The sauce itself is a total treat with rice. I'm in love with this recipe after the modifications.

This is simple and amazing.  I followed it exactly, although doubled all ingredients and added a few spoonfuls of sour cream because I like the rich taste!  One of the easiest meals I've made and definitely the best!  Thanks!

AWESOME!  Some minor adjustments I made....I doubled the mushroom soup and worchestershire sauce and onion.  I also used an entire bar of lowfat cream cheese and added a small can of mushrooms.  Then I served over rotini noodles.  It was fantastic.  This will be one of my regulars from now on.

Very Tasty, It only took about 5 1/2 hours in the slow cooker on low, and I too doubled the Golden Mushroom and Water. I used less cream cheese and more sour cream because I noticed the cream cheese had a hard time breaking down. I may use a little less onion next time. But over all I am very please and would make this again. Thanks!

This a great and easy meal. I added a cup of red wine, fresh mushrooms, and garlic. It was great and the family loved it.

So amazing.  I did follow the advice of some and made some changes.  I added salt and pepper, onion soup mix, and a boullion cube.  Also, I added fresh mushrooms, and served it over egg noodles.  I also cooked it on low for 6 hours.  I was a little paranoid about cooking it too long, but I think next time I will cook it longer because the meat was a little tough.  The flavor was really good, and I had the leftovers the next day.  This will go into the regular rotation.

I followed the instructions fairly closely, and it turned out WONDERFULLY!  I did add some sauteed mushrooms and a dollop of sour cream along with the cream cheese.  With a glass of red wine, this was a real winner.

This has easily become one of our favorite slow cooker meals.  The cream cheese is a great touch.  Don't be afraid to use hamburger meat in a pinch!

I made this dish for my husband and kids, I didn't have any as I don't eat red meat but they really loved it. As suggested by other reviewers, I made a few changes and additions: First I browned the cubed beef with garlic and onions and added to the crockpot. I added beef buillon and sliced mushrooms just 1/2 hour before serving. My husband asked me to save this recipe in our favorite recipes. Thanks Jessica!

I am only giving this 5 stars because of the review I read on here. Without it, this recipe is only 1 star. I bought a nice cut of sirloin from my butcher, cooked for 5 hours in my crockpot and the meat melted in your mouth. I added 2 3oz packages of cream cheese and no sour cream. WOW-- This is a restaurant quality recipe. I will be making this on a regular basis. Thank you to the person who read 900 reviews and figured it out!

This is a fantastic recipe. I was so hungry that I forgot to add the cream cheese and it still tasted great. Then I added the cheese and it was just as great. (So if you want a little less fat, skip the cream cheese.) I listened to Jillybean and added a bouillon cube, pepper, garlic and sauteed mushrooms and served it over egg noodles. I didn't add extra salt though and I really don't recommend it. Wow, this was a super easy and super tasty meal that I will make often. It tasted even better the next day.

A super simple way to make this yummy dish.  I also changed things a bit.  Had to double, plus I added garlic, salt, pepper and beef broth instead of water. Will make again many times!

Must use golden mushroom, and I throw in whole portabella's at the start, cook on low for 10 hours and at the end, I throw in a block of cream cheese while the noodles are boiling.  My PICKY husband could eat this every night and I have started to double the recipe so we have leftovers.

I tasted this right before I put the cream cheese and it was GREAT!!  I wish I had not added the cream cheese because it really did nothing for it. It was still delicious however.  It is 4 star with cream cheese, and 5 star without.. I also took advice and added 1/4 sherry instead of water, a bullion cube, and about 1/2 packet onion soup mix.  Will make next time with sour cream instead cream cheese.

Very good.  My 2 year old loved it too. My husband said I can make that again anytime. I did add 1/2 packet of Lipton onion soup because I had to use it up and a few cloves of garlic and salt/pepper.  I also added more water since I added the onion soup.

This was a fantastic recipe the first time round. It's a 4* recipe as it is. I made it a 5* recipe by substituting normal cream cheese with onion & chive cream cheese. It gave the 'zang' that sour cream can never do! (Might try galic & her next time). I also used milk instead of water to keep it creamy, pepper & salt, and added extra mushrooms (sauteed) halfway through. So far I've service this over noodles, rice and mash! All 3 were brilliant bases for this sauce.

Excellent.  Sometimes slow cooker recipes are disappointing because they turn out greasy, but this is one of the best slow cooker recipes I've run across - delicious and not greasy in the least.

I read reviews for half an hour and then decided to just make it the way the recipe calls for.  It was great. the only thing I used different was a no salt worcestershire because I can't have salt.  The flavor was still great.

I really do not like hamburger helper and am quickly getting tired of any cream of mushroom base.... however what would American Cuisine be without it... I was very disappointed in this recipe... Evidentally I do not share the same taste buds of many reviewers. Stew meat drowned in golden cream of mushroom soup... Not good to eatnor resembles a stroganff.  I will look for something from scratch and I am steering away from Cream of Mushroom .

My husband absolutely adored it!  I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the meat and golden mushroom soup, added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix, and I added a dollop of sour cream to the sauce in addition to the cream cheese.  I do not care for mushrooms so I didn't add any extra mushrooms (although my husband would have liked that)!  This was both easy and very good.  I cooked for 5 hours on low and that was perfect.  I served it over buttered egg noodles.  I will make this again.

The modified version of this recipe was fantastic --- double soup and water, add sauteed mushrooms and a "dollup" of sour cream with cream cheese. I will certainly make this recipe again.

After reading other reviews I doubled all but the worcestershire, added (too much) garlic, threw it all in the crockpot (no browning), added sauteed mushrooms just before serving. Pulled some sauce and whisked with softened cream cheese before stirring into pot.  Will make again with little or no garlic!

I made this using the modifications listed in the other reviews, plus added a can of mushrooms (at the start of cooking) and used light sour cream.  It is now a family favorite.  I also doubled the batch and 12 yo son is also eating for breakfast!!  Definately add the pepper.

I doubled this recipe so I could set half aside to serve to my daycare. I ended up having to get into what I set aside because my kids were asking for seconds. So I had to make a meal the next day for daycare, but it was worth it. Will make this again for sure!

Didn't change a thing; came out great.  Husband and step-kids loved it over some egg noodles.  Good comfort food, easiest thing to prepare, and good for the budget too at about $8 for a double recipe.

All the 5 star reviews were right.  A huge hit with my family. I did not think I could find a recipe that would replace my mom's stroganoff but I did! I can't wait to try it out on friends.  I did make the changes that MOMSAVEDBYGRACE called for.  Thanks for your help

I normally don't like slow cooker meals, but continue to make them in hopes of finding something I like.  This was DELICIOUS! I made exactly as directed (make sure you use beef chuck meat because it cooks very tender and falls apart).  This will DEFINITELY go into the rotation.

So easy and delicious!! We were scraping our plates clean!! I used broth instead of water, and added a dallop of sour cream at the end.

This was pretty good, a little on the too creamy side, missing that extra zip.

5 stars from us also - followed the advice of other reviews and doubled the sauce. I left out the onions (hate onions) and subbed red wine for the water, and added close to a 1/2 c of sour cream towards the end of the cook time. Sauteed mushrooms and added to my plate (BF doesn't like mushrooms - shhh he doesn't know about the 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, lol). The response from my BF was , 'YUM!!!' Then he gobbled up 2 plates. I'll make this again - it was quick, easy and yummy comfort food.

I will definitely make this again!
I made some alterations based on other reviews. Adding salt, pepper and garlic, doubling the sauce but not the cream cheese or sour cream, adding a half packet of onion soup mix and a bullion cube, and my favorite part adding Mushrooms! I didn't sauté the mushrooms like some people did, I just threw them in raw and let them cook in the crockpot till they were soft. I served over egg noodles. It turned out perfectly!

In a plastic bag i added some flour,salt and pepper. Added the beef to the flour mix to coat it. Browned the beef in olive oil on the stove top. I  chopped some fresh mushrooms, onions and garlic. I used one can of Cream of Mushroom and one can of Cream of celery. Last but not least i added 1-2  Tablespoon of Kitchen Bouquet.(browning and seasoning sauce) This added color and flavor. Thanks for the starter!   The Morrison's

Made recipe "as is".  It is perfect and fast!  A wonderful, mid-week meal served with noodles and a fresh vegie!  I wouldn't say this is a "stoganoff" I have made before, but it is still yummy for a mid-week meal.  Meat fork-tender after 6 hours on low in the crock.  I might perhaps throw in some fresh 'shrooms next time, even a bag of frozen vegies in the last half hour.  Thank you!  I like.

Here is how I changed the recipe:  1)2lbs of cubed beef stew meat 2)2 cans golden mush. soup 3) Added pepper, 1 clove of garlic, along with 3 green onions (in addition to the 1/2 onion that's in the recipe) 4) 1/2 packet onion soup mix 5) 1/2 cup water 6) 1/2 cup sour cream.  Amounts for Worcestershire and cream cheese stayed the same.  5 hours on low was perfect, but at hour 4 I added the cream cheese and sour cream, stirring occasionally the last hour. Turned out great!!

We add baby carrots to the bottom of the slow cooker before adding the beef to make this a one dish meal for the kids.  I also use red wine instead of water, add 1/2 packet of onion soup mix, use 2 pounds of beef, 2 cans of soup, add a dollop of sour cream and keep everything else the same.  We love this recipe.

I want to say that I *LOVED* this recipe exactly as it was. But, as cooks have a tendency to do, I did start tweeking it here and there to suit my own family.

What I did was double the meat and add 16oz whole mushrooms, chunked, at the onset of cooking. I also added one envelope of dry onion soup mix along with the 1/2 cup chopped onion the recipe calls for and I omitted the water completely to allow for a nice thick sauce. We are watching our weight and I have used fat-free cream cheese with no noticeable change in flavor. Mmmmm!

I followed Jillybeans suggestions as almost everyone else has done and was very pleased with this dish.  My boyfriend doesn't care for mushrooms that much so I did not add the canned mushrooms but did double the sauce (Golden Mushroom soup) and he still loved it.  I used frozen egg noodles instead of packaged and I think that made the dish that much more appealing.  Plenty of left overs sealed and patiently waiting in the freezer for a cold wintery Minnesota night!

I hate that this recipe has been completely revised and now is complicated to follow or I would give it 5 stars.  I just kinda tried to follow most recommendations and did my own thing half the time.  I will make it again, but not let myself get stressed about all the new recommendations by reviewers.

When you read these reviews, you will see many references to JELLYBEAN14. I searched forever to find that review! So to save you the frustration, she posted it on page 25! ( July 2005)  Turned out great BTW.

This was very good with a few modifications.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 a packet of dry onion soup mix, 1 cup of beef broth instead of water, most of a container of fresh sliced mushrooms and plenty of fresh cracked pepper.  I served it over whole wheat noodle style pasta and it was delicious!  I have a 3-quart crock pot and this made plenty (I live alone), I wouldn't double any of the ingrediants unless I was serving a crowd.  I will absolutely make this again.

Seasoned the meat with salt and pepper, doubled the mushroom soup, added half pack of onion mix.  Cooked on high for first 2 hours, then low for the next three.  Sauteed mushrooms in garlic and onions, then added these in during the 2nd hour of cooking.  Best stroganoff I've ever cooked!  Thanks for the recipe!

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it required so many changes to the original recipe. I followed the advice of many other reviewers and made a couple of changes. I used Golden Mushroom instead of Cream of Mushroom soup. I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the Worcesteshire and cream cheese. I added onion and garlic soup mix, as well as a beef boullion cube and salt and pepper. Within the last half hour of cooking, I added the required cream cheese as well and a 1/2 cup of sour cream. I served it over extra-broad egg noodles. This turned out so good that my husband called me from work just to say thank-you for the leftovers. I will make this again although I think next time I may add fresh sliced mushrooms to the slow cooker about an hour before dinner is to be served.

I couldn't find "golden mushroom soup", so I used roasted garlic mushroom soup instead and I thought the sauce was very good.  I doubled the recipe, using 2 lbs. beef, 3 cans of soup, 1 1/4 cup of water, 1 onion, 1 onion soup packet, 1 beef boullion.  My husband, son (age 3), AND daughter (age 1), devoured it!

I did everything that JillyBean suggested, but thought the flavor was still a little lacking so I added a splash of white wine. I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I added a can of them at the beginning before cooking for 5 hours on low. Served over No Yolks extra broad noodles. The flavor was really nice. Will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe doubled many times and have had great results.  Today I tried the recipe as written and the results weren't what I expected.  I used a 6 qt. crock pot so I'm guessing it's too large for a single batch.  If you have a large crock pot I would recommend doubling the recipe for much better results...

I was looking for slow cooker recipes and ran across this, it caught my attention because it had over 800 reviews.  Wow, it must be good if over 800 people were compelled to come back and review it.  I put it together before work and I was pretty skeptical.  Came home after work and did the finishing touches and OMG I couldn't believe how good it was.  My whole family loved it including my VERY picky 2 year old. Next time I will double the recipes so that we can have leftovers.

Simply Scrumptious! This was so easy to prepare & cooked within 5 hours easy!  I only made 2 changes: 1)Bottom Round Steak cut into 1" strips 2) Substitute Onion Soup Mix for the onion (as was suggested by another cook) Definitely make twice the sauce  and use the golden mushroom soup. This is now the only beef stroganoff recipe for my family.  Thanks Jessica...way to cook!

This was so easy and wonderful.  My husband said it was the best stroganoff he has ever tasted.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of Golden mushroom soup and I also added a can of Beef gravy.  This is defintely a keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as it says and it was great! We all loved it but we ended up making it our own one evening we needed to be somewhere and fast. I browned 1lb ground turkey with onion powder in a pan. I doubled the golden mushroom soup, Worcestershire sauce and the water and put it in the same pan. We let that sit until the noodles were close to being ready then I added 8 oz cream cheese. While I got the plates and every thing else ready the cream cheese melted and it is a quick and easy meal. No need for the crock-pot if you just need a quick meal on an unexpected busy night.

This has become one of my go-to recipes. The only thing I modify is I add cream cheese AND sour cream. I also add a bit more worch sauce and about 1/2cup ketchup (when I add the creams) to give it a tomato base flavor. EXCELLENT.

I used ground beef instead of the beef stew cubed meat. It came really good. I used 2 lbs. of ground beef of course I cooked and crumbled the meat before placing the meat in crock pot. I also sauteed mushrooms in a little butter in the same pan I used for the meat. I add 1/2 cup of white wine to the mushrooms and I added a beef boullion cube to dissolve. I did use Golden Mushroom soup and that makes the difference in the taste. I doubled the sauce ingredients for the 2 lbs. of ground beef and it came delicious.

It was alright and had an ok flavor.  I think it was missing something to add more to its delicate flavor

I made this for dinner last night.  I added a package of Lipton Onion Soup and also a 16 oz package of sliced mushrooms.  Overall it was very good.  But with the two soups it is very, very salty.  I had to add extra water because it was so thick.  
Next time I think I will add a can of Sodium Free Beef Broth and the 16 oz sliced mushrooms to the original recipe.  I will not add the Lipton Onion Soup..too salty.

By the way it does not make much at all.  You might want to double the recipe.

I am a newlywed and a beginner cook, and my husband has always LOVED his mom's beef stroganoff.  I didn't think I'd be able to make hers, but I tried this recipe and it came out FABULOUS.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and I added a packet of onion soup mix and I used beef broth instead of water.  I cooked it in the crock pot on low for about 7 hours and added the cream cheese at the end.  My husband said this was the best beef stroganoff he's ever had (we won't tell his mom!)!

My hubby and I enjoyed this dish, though we found it a little on the bland side.  Still satisfied with the meal, so I'll give this 4-stars.  I added 2 cloves of mince garlic and a can of sliced mushrooms (fresh would have been better).  I think next time, to add some more flavor, I'll add onion soup mix, like others had suggested.

This was good, added fresh mushrooms half way thru, also added some cooking sherry.  I was skeptical about the cream cheese, I normally use sour cream, but the cream cheese added a good flavor.   Mixed in some egg noodles and all was good.  Will do this again for sure.

Since finding this recipe a few weeks ago, I have made this dish at least 3 times!  It's a great base recipe; the key is to use golden mushroom soup and to soften the cream cheese before adding it to the slow cooker.  I also added sliced fresh mushrooms and fresh minced garlic, along with a little brown mustard and a splash of red wine at the beginning of cooking.  I could make this 3 times a week and my husband would be thrilled!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I didn't like this recipe at all.  It was like a soup gone wrong.  The cream cheese did not melt as desired.  My boyfriend, who eats everything, would not even eat it.

This was fantastic!  The only thing I changed is, I used seasoned flour on the stew meat and browned in a skillet before adding it to the crock.  I made a double batch with 3 TSP Worcestershire, about 3/4 cup water, and a nice splash of red wine (whatever you've got open - I used Merlot).

I made this and we loved it.  I used 2 lbs. of meat, doubled the soup,added beef broth instead of the water, and used 4 oz. cream cheese and 1/3 cup sour cream.   It was so delicious and can't wait to make it again.

This is an OK recipe...we doctored it alot to make it great.  I added ketchup, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, fresh mushrooms, and used cream of mushroom soup along with the golden mushroom.  Make sure the stew meat is cut into larger chunks or it dries out.

Good easy and simple recipe to prepare and servre.Can stay in the pot for a while too. I used Creame Fraise rather than cream cheese and that worked just great.With a nice wild rice just cooked it filled our family very well.I did not use the worcester sauce and it appeared to not matter.

My family loved this recipe!  Many previous reviewers have given great suggestions on modifying ingredients.  However, the comments recommending doubling the recipe don't really communicate that the recipe as written doesn't easily feed 4.  I suggest that you double the recipe, not just for leftovers, but so that you have enough for one family meal.

This was very good. The only changes I made were to add a can of mushrooms an hour before done and sour cream instead of cream cheese. Next time I'll try the cream cheese and definitely double the recipe. As previous reviewers have noted - it will serve 3 hungry folks. I can't imagine adding soup mix to this - too salty! Thanks for a recipe I'll make again.

Wow!  I followed Jillybean14 (7/6/05) suggestions, and forgot the cream cheese and sour cream (on accident).  It was wonderful!  I browned the meat first, and cooked for close to 8 hours, and the meat was very tender.  I am not sure that I would add the cream cheese next time...it was so good without it, why add the extra calories?  My sauce was more brownish, and I guess the cream cheese would make it creamier, more stroganoff like.  I served with a red leaf salad, some red wine, and everyone was happy as can be!  It worked out well...cooked all day while we were at a football game.  Came home to a wonderful smelling house, and dinner was ready!
11/17/08 have made this numerous times and it is just wonderful.

I took the advice of others and doubled the meat and golden mushroom soup, added 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, pepper, and a beef bouillon cube.  I also stirred in a dollop of sour cream and a 7oz can of sliced mushrooms (drained) at the same time as the cream cheese.  Served over egg noodles with balsamic and parmesan asparagus on the side.  I served this to a couple of friends who LOVED it; I thought it was pretty good, and will make it again.

Hmmmm, this is good, but I thought Stroganoff was made with sour cream--not cream cheese.  I made this recipe with cream cheese as stated.  It is good, but has anyone tried this substituting sour cream for cream cheese for the more traditional stroganoff taste?

This was excellent and truly as easy as it looks! I didn't have the golden mushroom soup, so I used regular mushroom soup and it turned out great. I sauted some extra mushrooms and added them about 30 minutes before I served it.

Excellent.  The only modification I made was to add a couple cloves of garlic and lots of mushrooms.

My family enjoys this a great deal. It's not high cuisine, but it's great comfort food. In response to some other reviews, it's VERY important to use the Golden Mushroom soup. The soup has a completely different flavor -- it's a beef-based soup, instead of cream-based. Do try and do this with the Golden Mushroom first, especially before you pass judgement on the recipe. It's also really important to use cream cheese, because the consistency creates more body in the recipe than just sour cream. (Sour cream has too high a water content.) The modification I make is to add black pepper, which helps increase the "oomph". No, it's not a particularly "spicy" dish, but if you will use the soup as directed, it's also not as bland as it would be with the cream of mushroom soup.

I added a half packet of onion soup mix instead of the onion b/c my husband does not like them and a jar of mushrooms. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a real hit with my husbad. Although we found it too rich with the cream cheese, so I used light sour cream instead, and it really made the dish lighter. I also added fresh mushrooms and used lipton onion soup mix instead of the onion.  This dish is easy to prepare and great served on rice.

This was excellent. Haven't had Beef Stoganoff in a long while and this was a pleasant rememberance of how good it is. I did double the sauce as others suggested. Added 1/4 cup of beef broth and 1/4 cup red wine instead of water. 1 package of french onion soup mix. I added mushrooms about 1 hour before serving. I didn't have any cream cheese so used sour cream instead. I cooked it on low for 8 or 9 hours and it was perfect.Thank you for a good comfort food on a cold January night.

This was delicious! I made it for "girl's night" and my friends ate it all up and wanted the recipe. I listened to others suggestions and seasoned the meat beforehand, I used garlic salt, garlic pepper and seasoning salt. I added a packet of dry onion soup mix. It added great flavor, but I think next time I'll only use half the packet cause it seemed like too much.

This has become a staple in our household. I've been craving it the last couple days. I use fat free cream cheese and add red wine instead of water. My house smells delicious already and I have about 3 hrs to go!

Good flavor, obviously easy.  I would double the sauce so it serves better with noodles.  I have also made this with cream of chicken soup, when I was out of mushroom and it tasted just as good.

Awesome! I wasn't too sure about it while it as cooking, but it came out GREAT! I took somebody else's suggestion and used onion & chive cream cheese at the end, and that gave it some extra zip. My husband loved it.

I did just as the recipe called for.  However, I added some mushrooms.  I also cooked the egg noodles al dente, and then added them to the crock pot to absorb some of that juice.  Then added the cream cheese.  OH MY GOD.  It was wonderful.  Next time I make this I am going to throw some whole cloves of garlic in it.  That will "KICK IT UP A NOTCH".  Enjoy.

Delicious.  I did add five, sauted, sliced button mushrooms to the recipe to add more flavor.  I put them in the last half hour of cooking to prevent it from getting limp.  I also noticed the sauce was a little too soupy, so I cooked my egg noodles al dente then added them to the mixture at the same time as the mushrooms.  It soaked up the extra sauce, which then created the perfect consistency.  The meat, of course, was very tender which is a given, since it was cooked in a crockpot.  My husband and I both enjoyed this.  The cream cheese was an unusual addition that added the perfect "tart" taste we associate with this dish.  Needless to say, I won't be using sour cream in stroganoff any time soon.

Absolutely delicious!!  Substituted beef broth for water and added the following at the very end; 4 oz cream cheese, 4 oz sour cream and made a mixture of 2 tbl cornstarch to 3 tbl water.  Very rich - would make an excellent dish for company!

This is a great slow cooker meal.  I am a very health concious eater so I used low-sodium mushroom soup (couldn't find "golden") and also used light cream cheese. Additionally, this took literally 5 minutes to assemble and I only cooked on High for 5 hours. Despite all my substitutions and adjustments it was still delicious!!!!

This was really good! Not quite as good as my normal beef stroganoff recipe, but it was so much easier to make in the crockpot! I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted beef broth for the water and added a jar of whole mushrooms. I served it over medium egg noodles. The cream cheese was a nice and different addition, but next time I'll probably try it with sour cream instead. Oh, and the leftovers were GREAT the next day! Overall a great and EASY recipe... Thanks Jessica!

Delicious!!  I've made similar recipes w/ stew meat, roasts, or round steak for many years, but I have never seen one using cream cheese.  What a nice change!  I'll try adding it to my other recipes!  My hubby ate this one right up!

This was really good and quick! I added extra worcestershire (about a 1/4 cup), 8 oz. of FRESH sliced mushrooms and a package of onion soup mix. At the end of cooking I added a packet of brown gravy mix to thicken it up. I served it on a bed of rice and my husband loved it!

I thought this was excellent, and so easy too. I used regular cream of mushroom, not the golden variety and cubes of stew meat that I cut up a little smaller than what was in the grocery store package. I didn't have noodles so I used rice. To my surprise it tasted great that way.  Next time I will add some fresh mushrooms to boost the "mushroom factor" and serve over noodles.  Definitely a recipe destined for a repeat performance in my house.

This is such an easy and tasty recipe. Even my picky nine-year-old loved it! I am always looking for recipes to throw in the slow cooker before I go to evening class.  My family doesn't even wait for me to get home before they start eating this!

This was just okay tasting although it is an easy way to make stroganoff.  Next time I will use sour cream instead of cream cheese.  It's just creamier and gives it a better taste.

We love stroganoff in our house, and this is the only way it will be made from now on. It was SOO tasty, and I loved the fact that I didn't have to slice and cook thin steak.  The only problem I had was the cream cheese did not seem to disolve properly.  Next time I might try the trusty sour cream instead.

My fiancee and I noticed that although the sauce tasted like it was suppose to, the meat (although tender) did not taste as good as a sirloin steak meat traditionally does....I would love to find a crockpot recipe that uses a more appropriate meat.

Today will be my fourth time to make this recipe.  I did add fresh mushrooms and red wine instead of water.  The real test will be when my son arrives home from college today.  He considers himself an "expert" on beef stroganoff.

My family just LOVED this recipe.  I did add a drained can of sliced mushrooms 
and a bit more Worcestershire sauce for some extra "zip".  It was so easy to put
together and forget about while it cooked.  The meat was so tender and delicious.
We served it with buttered noodles, some baked acorn squash from our garden,
a nice green salad, and fresh crusty hard rolls.  This will definitely be added to
my permanent recipe collection.

Excellent way to use stew meat. While I wouldn't try to pass this off as traditional stoganoff (I usually use sirloin for that), it was very tasty nevertheless. I added a couple of cans of mushrooms, which really added to the flavor.

Be careful not to put too much cream cheese, it makes it too rich.  Otherwise it's a good recipe.  Meat is nice and tender.

This is great!  The cream cheese gives the recipe great flavor and texture.  I actually used Neufchatel cheese and it worked equally well.  My family cleaned it up.

This is addictive, I did as one reviewer said onion soup mix and I used sour cream as I didn’t have cream cheese, but once you add the onion soup mix it really gives it something . I made it in the slow cooker, sautéed the onions first and then added everything including noodles and walked away 5 hours later it was amazing. The entire pot was gone and I had a request to make an additional pot the next day to serve to my sons friends. Anything that was left over I food sealed it and froze it. 
Excellent !

I did all the modifications suggested by Jessilynn, so it is not really this basic recipe. Broccoli was a good side.

Family members ranked it 3.5, 4.5, and 5.0 stars.

Great recipe! I made a few changes to personalize it. Instead of stew meat, I used shrimp. I replaced the mushroom soup with tomato soup. I used hot sauce instead of Worcestershire, and sour cream instead of cream cheese. Seriously, this recipe is awesome without any changes.

Really easy to make.  The recipe is a great base but I did make some adjustments based on reviews and my personal preferences.  I added double of everything  and seasoned my meat with garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne and garlic.  I also added to beef bouillon cubes and then at the end of the cook time added in sliced mushrooms and broccoli and then served over egg noodles.  Will definitely make again! Great recipe!

I swapped the 300g of golden mushroom soup for 400 g of cream of mushroom and a tin of sliced mushrooms. I also added salt, garlic and pepper. Finally I used a bit of cornflour to thicken. It was OK, I should have used more cheese to make up for the extra mushroom.

Simple and easy to make. Prepped everything before work, checked it on lunch break, and it was ready for my girlfriend and I to eat when we got home. Next time I would like to change it from beef to chicken, maybe even add in some broccoli with it.

Made it today.  Doubled the recipe and the only thing I did different was to add 8oz of fresh cut up baby bellas.  It could use a wee bit of salt.  It's a "keeper"!  Served it over noodles.

The use of cream cheese instead of sour cream is fantastic! Will only be making it with cream cheese from now on. This also works well with venison.

Great flavor and the soup makes it creamy!! I add mushrooms and garlic! Skip the cream cheese and just top each bowl with a dollop of sour cream!

Ive tried it as is, and loved it.  But I now use this base for swedish meatballs.  its out of this world.  Instead of the onion though, I add 1 packet of dry onion soup mix.  so simple, and so delicious with my changes or without!

Simple and good. Fam. Loved it. I used two cans of Golden Mushroom and few shakes of garlic. Next time I'm going to make double and freeze some.... Hope it will freeze well. Fot the egg noodles, add the amount your fam. Likes, 
Definitely worth making, it's a keeper in our house. Thank you.

This was super easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly, and both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. The only thing we both agreed it needed was a little more salt, but you can always add that at the end.

We loved this recipe! I tried the slow cooker's high setting for five hours instead of the recommended low for eight hours. The meat was a little tough, so I'll go with the low setting for eight hours next time. Otherwise it was incredible and is sure to become a family staple! Thanks to the author!

I have made this a few times. The recipe as is is very good. My husband had the idea to add half cream cheese and half brie. Wow...that made it fantastic! Very easy recipe. I double the batch for leftovers since the 2nd time around is as good as the first. Enjoy!

The cream cheese curdled and the sauce was full of little white globs. The sauce and meat were both a disgusting gray color. The smell was nauseating. It tasted like mud.

This is a good basic recipe, but I did make changes per other reviews. I seasoned the meat that was actually in strips v/s chunks with a steak mix, garlic and onion powder. Used regular cream of 'shroom soup added extra worcestershire sauce, and beef broth. Then near the end, added sour cream, which really made it tasty. Oh yea, I made it on the stove since I didn't have a slow cooker. The family ate it up! Thanks for sharing.

This was fabulous. My husband,who loves beef stroganoff, kept making "yummy" noise. I will add a bit more onion & mushrooms next time for an earthier flavor. Fabulous recipe though.

This was delicious but I did take advice from other reviewers. I doubled the recipe and I added about half cream cheese and an 8 oz container of sour cream. I liked the texture of the sour cream better. I also added a pack of Lipton onion soup mix, a little minced garlic, and I added a bouillon cube to the water before adding as well as a little cornstarch to thicken and a pinch of black pepper. It came out very good but a little salty. I will definitely make this again but I will look for lower sodium soup mix and bouillon to reduce the salt. I know when you change a recipe it's not really a fair assessment to rate it as written but I will say this was a good base to start from and it's very customizable.

I loved this dish. I followed JILLYBEAN14 suggestions and it turned out wonderful. My slow cooker but be fast because it was done in 3-4 hours. I did not use a bullion cube. It may need a little more liquid at the end and I did not sautéed mushrooms but just dumped in the sliced mushrooms raw and they cooked nicely without disappearing. Will make this again and for company what a treat.

I think it would have been better with sour cream and not cream cheese. I didn't use golden mushroom soup but it still turned out good.

This recipe was just OK.  I followed it as written (except I added extra mushrooms for an hour at the end).  I was really disappointed that the meat was severely overcooked and burnt to the bottom of the slow cooker.  The flavor was pretty good, albeit a bit salty.  My BF loved it and wants me to make it again, so I will.  But I will not cook it for that long maybe add less Worcestershire sauce to see if that helps with the saltiness.

I liked it, my husband thought it was nothing special - generic diner food was his description.    I used most of jellybean14 hints except for adding the Lipton's mix and bullion cubes.   Instead I just used beef broth instead of water.  A pretty easy recipe that made a lot of food.   I won't be able to make it again, but I would tell others to try it.  (TB / koriander)

Ranch dressing (homemade or jar) also makes a good substitute for the cream cheese or sour cream in stroganoff.

I too read a lot of the reviews here and decided to make changes based on jillybean14. Amazing...! I cut the meat I used myself in cubes smaller than what was at the store. I followed the advice of jillybean14 and could not be happier I did. I cut and paste her recommendations and put them with the base recipe. My son is not a steak person and has only had his stroganoff via Hamburger Helper....he absolutely loved this version. I will be sure to share and make it again.

This recipe is so easy and super delicious! It was easy enough that my husband was able to make it before heading off to his 2nd shift job and it was ready when I got home from work. I was greeted at the door with the delicious aroma. I added some dried parsley, dried rosemary and cracked black pepper.

This is good! Mixed original recipe & reviews. Use original recipe add: 1/4c beef broth, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, thyme, ground white pepper, & a dollop of sour cream when I added the cream cheese. Cook on low 4-4 1/2 hrs. I doubled the recipe then mixed in one bag of cooked egg noodles.

Doubled the entire recipe and threw in a beef bouillon cube for flavor.  Really good.  Very easy prep on a busy morning when you're trying to get out the door.

Really good. I liked the cream cheese so much better than the traditional sour cream. Instead of using a crock pot, I sautéed the onions and thinly sliced sirloin first in a skillet, then added soup, water, and Worchestershire and simmered with lid on for 20 mins. I added cream cheese at the end.

Yum! Based on other reviews I tweaked the recipe a bit. I added 2 beef bullion cube, salt, pepper, garlic, and an extra can of the soup when putting all into the crock pot. I added a dollop of sour cream with the cream cheese and sautéed mushrooms. Will definitely make again.

It is bland and very salty.  I did make a few modifications to enhance this recipe but like another person posted, this is a new recipe now and not the same one as this one posted here.  I might make this again with my modifications but not sure as there are other stroganoff recipes I like way better than this!

If I could give this 6 stars it would truly earn it.  Best Stroganoff ever and I've had many.  The good aroma through out the day ending with the meat melting in your mouth.  And the cream cheese adds a special flavor you'd never think would work but does.

I made some serious changes to this recipe, I used three pounds of stew meat, I used two cans of golden mushroom soup.  1 whole pack of French onion soup.  I sautéed the steak first in butter and vegetable oil.  After the steak was sautéed I put the steak, soup, soup mix into the crock pot, then I cut up garlic and onion...added two tbsps flour to the steak/butter dripping and made a roux...I then added the onions and garlic to the drippings and stirred for about ten minutes on medium/high heat.  I then added that to the crock pot with a dash of Worcestershire and 1/4 cup water, stirred and cooked for 6 hours...last hour of cooking I added sautéed mushrooms to the crock pot.  Last five minutes of cooking I added sour cream and cream cheese (to taste).  Served over egg noodles.  The roux makes the difference here!

I'm sorry for the ones that did not like this recipe, First I only read a few comments/reviews about this recipe. Pretty much it was a liked recipe. So I did alter it a little bit. I added fresh garlic, I used a different name brand of mushroom soup, I cooked fresh mushrooms and added that, with some beef broth and onion. I mixed all of these ingredients and then tasted it to get the right amount of salt and pepper then I added my meat that I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, And let that set for a few hours. At the end of the cooking time that was when I thicken up the gravy. ....... My husband LOVED it and so did I. This is now in my recipe box.

I made this recipe on a whim and really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, I did not know that my husband does not like anything with mushroom soup in it, so he didn't have any of it, no worries, though, he commented that it smelled really good and made the house smell wonderful on a cold night.  I'll definitely make it again when I know he's not going to be around.

My husband LOVES this! I did, however, use sour cream instead of the cream cheese, because I already had the sour cream. I wonder if using cream cheese would make it too rich and take away that "tang" from the sour cream. At any rate, the recipe was super easy and would make a great meal for a large family if the amounts were increased (although as it is it easily serves 4-6, depending on the size of your servings and if anyone wants seconds!).

One suggestion:  substitute 1 can of Beef Consumee for the water and instead of beef brig or cornstarch!  The Consumee has thickner in it therefore one does not need cornstarch.  Delicious!

I made this exactly like the instructions called for and it was.......AMAZING!  My family and I loved it and I will definitely make it over and over again.  This is simple, few ingredients, and tastes very good.  I can't ask for more.

I love easy new crock recipes. This had so few items and you just throw them in and stir,so I threw this together practically on my way out the door to work, that's how easy it was to prepare. It was a little burnt when I got home, it was on for 8hrs at least, on low. I used the cream cheese but I believe it would have been better with sour cream. The onion soup mix I put in as per many other cooks here, made it taste better but the burnt taste over powered it. I also think a little wine would have improved the taste, it was a little bit bland. Because of the ease of preparation I probably will make it again but not for so long.

I read some of the other reviews with the adjustments - all I did was add sliced mushrooms and a little crushe red pepper. Otherwise, followed to a T. It was very easy and came out pretty tasty!

I've been making this recipe for years and it is still a 5 star rating for me and my family! I, like many other people, like to "tweek" recipes on occassion otherwise it's like everyone walking around with the same hairstyle, certain people need to "loosen up!"

Tender, rich and flavorful!!  I've made stroganoff a number of ways over the years but no more - This will be the only way I will make it from now on.  Using the slow cooker is a bonus!  I doubled the meat, onion, water and soup plus I added a couple of minced garlic cloves, one beef bouillon cube, 1/2 packet of french onion soup mix before cooking.  Cooked 6 1/2 hours on low then stirred in 6 oz (3/4 of a package) cream cheese and a large dollop of sour cream.  I sauteed some fresh mushrooms in butter and stirred those in too.  Cooked another 1/2 hr on low and it was ready to serve - the beef was very tender and moist and the flavors rich and creamy.  Perfect consistency as a topping for noodles, toast, rice, etc.  Easy & delicious which means 5 Stars in my house!!

Whoops did you forget the Mee? Add 16-oz package of Fancy Egg Noodles, and Wait to Stir in cream cheese and boiled mee just before serving.

This was a great recipe! I did make a few adjustments. I generally shop on a budget and found cream of mushroom soup cheaper and it works just as well instead of the Golden mushroom soup and cream cheese. When everything was finished, I stirred in a 8 oz. container of sour cream. Viola! It was delicious!!

Pretty average, simple recipe. I add sour cream anyway, even though this is more of a stroganoff for people who don't like stroganoff.

I'm a 'use what you have' cook, and had to substitute golden mushroom with a cream of mushroom and half can of sliced mushrooms. Also I did make a couple of adjustments based off of Jillybeans's review.  I most definitely will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty and oh so simple. Gave this five stars because it was so quick. You just toss the ingrediants in and 5 hours later on high yiuve got dinner. I did change it up but the was a good base recipe. I used beef broth instead of water, onion soup mix instead of onions (my fiance hates onions), and I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery. This was a big hit the meat just fell apart.

Still my favorite slow cooker meal ever.  It's good just as is, but of course people will add or change things to suit their tastes.  I only change it by adding a packet of onion soup mix and I do add some garlic and I use more worchestershire sauce.  Love this meal!

I used sour cream instead of cream cheese because its what I had, next time I'd probably use cream cheese because I think it would have given then dish more flavor.

I was disappointed in the outcome of this recipe. I followed the directions to a T but the end result lacked flavor and was far too runny. runny had to do quite a bit of doctoring to serve. I would not make this again.

I was really disappointed with how this turned out. I followed recommendations from jillybean. It had a very generic "preservative" salty taste to it.  Sort of reminded me of how hamburger helper tastes... It's my first attempt at making a beef stroganoff so I'm willing to give it another try, but maybe a different recipe.

I'm delighted with this;  Hubby doesn't like tangy foods, and the cream cheese adds a lovely richness without adding 'zing'.  Highly recommended!

The recipe is a solid start - but if it was made exactly as written, it would turn out as a pretty average stroganoff! As many other reviewers have said, however, when the modifications suggested in the reviews are included, it truly does turn into an extraordinary recipe!

I have made this exactly as stated and while my family enjoyed it this time I did opt to make some changes. I used red wine instead of water, regular cream of mushroom soup, sauteed mushrooms an hour before it was done and Philly Herb and Garlic cooking cream instead of cream cheese and/or sour cream. It was terrific!

I read through a lot of the "most helpful positive reviews" and made a few changes based on them and this turned out great. 

1. Seasoned meat with salt and pepper.
2. Added a clove of chopped garlic.
3. Added 1/2 cup of water instead of 1/4 cup.
4. Added sauteed mushrooms in the last half hour of cooking.
5. Added a dollop of sour cream along with the cream cheese.

Really enjoyed this, can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today!

This is a super easy recipe, A few varations make it have some real flavor. Many of the reviews changed almost everything about the recipe! This is the base recipe and it is adjusted to personal taste (like most recipes are!) You can use what ever kind of beef you desire just adjust cooking time. I used ground round, browned and drained then cooked with onions before adding to the slow cooker. I used cream of mushroom soup( i dont care for large pieces of mushroom) added a little bit more water then called for and a beef boullion cube and a shake or two of garlic powder and some pepper. cooked for about 2 hours and then added the cream cheese and a dollop of sour cream served over egg noodles. it hit the spot.

I have made this recipe several times using JILLYBEAN14 suggestions, it is amazing.  This time I sauteed the mushrooms and spooned over the top of the stroganoff and noodles on the plate.  It was delicious.

Scrumptious!  LOVE THIS!  My hubby isn't a fan of Stroganoff cuz it made him sick but that changed real fast with this recipe!  Great comfort food.  I had to stop myself going for 3rds.  Instead of water I did use beef broth and added the salt, pepper and garlic.  AMAZING!

I too used 2 cans of the soup and a scoop of sour cream when adding the cream cheese,  it turned out great!  I also add some fresh baby Bella mushrooms about an hour before serving.

Oh my goodness! I love that I ran into this recipe! I love a nice bowl of buttery egg noodles with some beef stroganoff on top. The cream cheese is genius and really makes the dish to die for! I followed the recipe exactly! No reason to change perfection, in my opinion!

This recipe is on regular rotation in our house. Since it's just 2 of us, this is the perfect amount for dinner with leftovers for lunch the next day. I don't make all of the alterations that are suggested in the reviews, but usually I'll throw in some extra spices and herbs as I see fit (usually some minced garlic and a sprinkling of parsley and oregano). Sometimes I get 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, but sometimes I forget. If I do, it just makes the sauce stretch for more noodles, so may be a good idea to do for a family. This takes 10 min to throw in the crock pot before work and is amazing to have soon as we walk in the door and cook up a batch of egg noodles! Highly recommend- whether you feel like doing the alterations or not!

Followed Jillybean14's advice - did not like this beef stroganoff at all, so the 3 stars are based on that review's recipe (which I actually would have given 1 star, but didn't want to penalize the original recipe so much).  Will try original recipe next time; however, I much more prefer Beef Stroganoff III by Donna to this.

Have made this a few times now and have been pleased each time.  Very nice recipe for making changes per taste preferences.  We definitely like it over noodles and adding fresh (sauteed) noodles just before serving.

Was good.  I added 1/2 envelope onion soup mix and pepper in beginning.  Also used both sour cream and cream cheese at the end,  Took about six hours on high to get more tender.

Excellent!  I'm rating this recipe 5 stars as is, but I've also made this sauce on the stove top for Hamburger Stroganoff.  I also substituted the canned mushroom soup for the homemade Cream of Mushroom Soup I recipe from this site.  Well worth the effort!  This recipe is perfect for a weeknight meal or on chilly winter nights.  Thank you for sharing!

I was really disappointed in the lack of flavour in this meal. It wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't make it again. Felt that it was missing ingredients! (Only thing I had added was 4 sliced mushrooms)

I have received numerous compliments on this dish.  It is so easy to make.  I did not add water because crockpot dishes tend to be juicy enough.  I liked the consistency without the water.  Added 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms the last 2 hours, yum.

Fantastic!  Creamy, beefy noodly.  Reminds me of Mom's every Thursday night dinner.  5 ingredients plus 1/4 cup of water.   Now that's easy!  I served it over buttered noodles and a handful of chopped flat leaf parsley.  This was my first time making it but it's so easy I'll make it again.

Very, very good. Used a full can of water, doubled the Worcestershire sauce, and added a big dollop of sour cream at the end. Also used a flat iron steak. Tastes fantastic the next day too.

Super good flavor but in my opinion I wouldn't add as much sour cream next time.  Maybe 3/4 of what the recipe calls for.

Hmmm, very tasty, but it came out "soupy" (maybe it was my fault as I subed water for canned onion soup rather than the mix. However, the original version is right: I should have cooked this for more than 5-6 hours, contrary to what other reviewers have said. After 5 1/2 hours my meat was still tough.

OMG this is so simple to make and taste so good. For the 4 serving recipe I added 1 1/2 more tablespoons Worcestershire sauce for a total of 2 1/2 Tablespoons. As well as a little salt and pepper. I also used the fat free creamed cheese.

Very good. I used 2 cans of Golden Mushroom soup and added a half cup sour cream. I like to throw in some fresh sliced mushrooms too. Even my picky kids like this meal.

I LOVE slow cooker recipes; after working all day, the last thing I want to do is go home and spend a long time cooking a meal...  This recipe is IDEAL for when I want some good home cooking without the time commitment.  It was easy to make and a nice change to our usual weekday supper routine.  I served over noodles because my husband prefers that to rice, but I think either way would work very well.

This recipe is outstanding and so easy. I took a couple of JillyBean's tips and added salt & pepper, a bullion cube, dollop of sour cream and 1/2 pkg onion soup mix.  Next time I'll use my smaller crock pot unless I'm doubling the recipe. It was cooked in less time using the big crock. I also added a splash of white zinfandel and some sauteed mushrooms. Smells divine while cooking!

This wasn't bad... it pretty much just tasted like any roast I have done in the crock pot. I was not overly excited about it. I will keep my oven -top stroganoff recipe from now on.

The basic recipe is good, but I modified it a bit. Instead of water I used beef broth for more flavor and I added red wine for a more traditional Stroganoff. I also added more onions, yellow and red, thinly sliced. I smashed a garlic clove and added some other seasonings. My family loved it! My only complaint is that you have to double it to feed a family.But I will be making it again

I will never buy that junk in the box as long as I breathe! This is the best stroganoff I've ever had, both homemade and store bought alike. The first time I made it, I wished it was a bit thicker. A few adjustments after the second time making it around and it's nothing short of perfect! Thank you for sharing this. My family never leaves leftovers!

Amazing dish!! Did not tell hubby what it was called as he is not a fan of Beef Stroganoff.  After a few bites he was commenting on how good it was, it was then that I told him it was Beef Stroganoff.  Everyone in the house had 3 helpings!  Used Beef Broth instead of water, added salt, pepper, and garlic.

I followed the suggestions made by others for this recipe and it was fantastic- I added a little flour b/c the sauce was a little runny and that thickened it up perfectly.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars, because I did make some changes. I couldn't find golden mushroom soup, so I used one can of cream of mushroom, one can of cream of mushroom with garlic, and one can of beef broth, and I didn't add any water. I then added a packet of Lipton's Beefy Onion soup mix, and let the soups, Worcestershire sauce and beef cook for about 6 hours on low. I added 4 oz of cream cheese (I bought the kind in stick form, not in the bowl, so it equals one stick) and about 1/2 cup of sour cream. I let that melt for about 30 minutes. While that was finishing, I made egg noodles and mixed it all together in one pot. It was absolutely fantastic. My husband, who hates mushrooms and beef stroganoff, ate two bowls of it and raved about it. So with the changes, it was amazing.

Nummmmmy! The whole family scarfed it down! The only things I changed were to add minced garlic, beef broth (1 can) and golden mushroom soup. Perfection!

Very good.  I made several changes.  Added 2 lbs of stew meet, used 2 cans garlic mushroom soup, beef broth and sour cream instead of cream cheese.  My family loved it.

This was phenomenal and SO EASY! My whole family (most of whom are quite picky) just loved it! Even after several helpings, there was enough for my DH to take some to work, where everyone commented on how great it smelled. Thanks to the original poster, and those who summarized all the tweaks to make a great recipe even better! :)

I just made this recipe last night and it came out great. I do recommend using the golden mushroom soup. I made a few modifications such as, substituting 1 cup of chicken broth for 1/4 cup of water, adding 3 cloves of minced garlic, and adding salt and pepper. The whole house smelled delicious! It was easy to make. I highly recommend it.

Excellent recipe! I use beef broth instead of water- I think it really adds some extra flavor. The cream cheese adds a different, delicious kick to this dish. I cook egg noodles and mix them right in the slow cooker before serving. Easy, delicious comfort food!

We tried this last week and my husaband and I both loved it.  I did two things suggested by other reviewers - use beef broth instead of water and add fresh mushrooms about an hour before it's done cooking.  My husband got home later than expected, so it cooked about 1-1/2 hrs longer than the recipe says, and it was still great.  Served over whole wheat egg noodles.  Yummy leftovers the next day!

I wasn't impressed with this.  I tried to zip it up with mushrooms, extra worcestershire and some sour cream, but it just wasn't that great.  The meat was very tender though.

I made this recipe almost exactly as is.  I only changed the water to beef broth.  I agree that you'll have to double the meat if you want 4 servings....but, it was perfect for the 2 of us.   Also make sure to add some fresh mushrooms.  It was very thick and rich, so no need for any cornstarch.  The only problem I saw was the cream cheese does not melt uniformly in the sauce....sour cream might look better.

I cooked this at summer camp and the kids were crazy over it!  I was surprised that they would eat the dish, especially since I added fresh mushrooms into the mix, but the kids LOVED it!  This recipe is a simple one and a big hit with all.

I followed the suggestions of others and added a bouillon cube during cooking.  I also reduced the amount of cream cheese and added a little sour cream, as well as sauteed mushrooms at the end.  Very good, but in my opinion, would have been lacking without the mushrooms.

Delicious! This is so easy to make, and it comes out tasting like I slaved all day. Made only minor changes: added black pepper, used chicken broth instead of water, threw in some mushrooms 40 minutes before it was done, and used a mix of sour cream and cream cheese. Serve over buttered egg noodles. My fiance scraped the plate clean!

Bland - where are the spices?  It was better leftover once the egg noodles had a chance to soak up the sauce.  It does have a really nice flavor but I had to add LOTS of black pepper and some salt to make it enjoyable.

I've made this several times and our family really enjoys it.  The meat is very tender.  I did go back to sour cream instead of cream cheese as it is difficult to get the cream cheese to blend in smoothly.  I always end up with specks of cheese throughout the stroganoff.  I added 3/4 cup of sour cream and it was delicious!

This was good, not great.  I added most of the things recommended.  Flavour was nice, but I just do not like the texture of beef stew.  I had guests and they like this. would I recommend this?  Probably not.

This was so easy to do.  I added sliced mushrooms about 20 minutes before serving and didn't need to add the cream cheese so it saved calories and fat.  Made noodles and served it over the noodles.  Will definitely make again and share the recipe with family and friends.

Easy & tasty!  I didn't have golden mushroom soup, so I used low fat cream of mushroom soup.  I subbed beef broth for the water as previous reviewers suggested.  I also used sour cream instead of cream cheese at the end -  just a personal preference.  Added a bunch of sliced fresh mushrooms and let them simmer for an hour before serving.  Awesome comfort food - husband loved it!

This is a great simple recipe that you can alter to your liking. I love basic recipes that people can build on. I added a whole onion, doubled the soup, meat, and water. I also added seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic) and included a packet of dry onion and mushroom soup. This is great, makes quite a bit. Also added a beef cube.

It's really good just the way it is.  You'd be suprised.  Ignore all the changes and keep it simple.  I used fat free sour cream.  The fat free cream cheese was REALLY nasty.

This is now my one and only stroganoff recipe!  The cream cheese makes this recipe AMAZING.  Great comfort food for a cold night.  Throw it in the crockpot early morning, come home to delicious-smelling house and wonderful dinner at night.  A definite keeper.

Not sure how this recipe got such high ratings, because as-is the cooking time & temp is way off, it's very bland, & it's way too watery.  I added minced garlic, a 1/4 packet of Beefy Onion soup packet, 1/4 cup of beef broth to substitute the water, & a little less than the full can of golden mushroom.  At 4hrs low, is was a little overdone and still too soupy so I added a bit of flour and sour cream instead of the cream cheese.  I will not be trying this recipe again.

Easy & Yummy!  I looked at some of the other reviews & I did add 1/2 packet of onion soup mix & I added in the extra sauteed  mushrooms. My husband & both loved it & will make it again.

Great base recipe! Liked recommendations from comments to add sour cream & double the mushroom soup. However adding any water to this recipe made it WAY TOO THIN & in my opionion the addition of onion soup mix overpowers; heavy on the onion flavor and masks the mushroon flavor and tang of sour cream. Will definitely try again with trial & errors in mind.

It was delicious with all the suggestions. But I am trying again without the onion soup packet. It was way too salty. It almost ruins the flavors that are already there.

VERY easy to prepare, and the onions do make a difference! I made two batches...the first one turned out so well that I made another one for my co-workers. I forgot the onions the second time, and it makes a big difference in my opinion. 

I also boiled egg noodles separately, getting them to "al dente/almost done", and mixed them directly into the stroganoff for the last 15 minutes. This works for getting the noodles well coated with the sauce, but any leftovers sitting in the pot will turn to mush quickly so I wouldn't recommend that.

Disappointed with this recipe. It was easy & edible but rather bland & too watery.  I would cut the water quantity in half or perhaps use beef broth instead.  It also needs garlic, mushrooms, seasoning and sour cream instead of cream cheese.

Using a half package of onion soup mix, beef bouillon & more water which I then thickened toward the end with some flour, the stroganoff was very good.

I added fresh sliced mushrooms and thickened it up a bit with a flour and water mixture. Next time, I'll sear the beef before putting it in the crockpot and use a bit of salt and pepper.

This recipe is awesome, especially for being so easy! I added a pack of onion soup mix, omitted the water, and used 2 golden mushroom soups with a little extra worchestire. I also used cream cheese and sour cream with a package of fresh mushrooms at the end. We've made it twice in about a month's time. Red Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon goes perfectly, too!

I love a true slow cooker dinner. Something that can cook while I'm at work & I can do minimal work when I get home. Yum!! I added a can of mushrooms to the mix as well as 8 oz sourcream right before serving.

I made this recipe gluten-free by using a gluten-free cream of muschroom soup from Progresso and adding some GF beef broth for flavor.  Put it on rice or GF noodles for a great meal.

Delicious!  I've made this many times now and I'd advise people to add some coarsely chopped mushrooms to the mix.  It takes the dish from 4 stars to a shining 5.  I wouldn't make it at all without the extra mushrooms, but that's just me. Also, using cream of mushroom soup is good too.  A little different taste but still a great meal.  Add the whorechester sauce to taste.

I  have made this a few times now and even my kids will eat it (that says A LOT!)  I used the person's advise that listed the 6 or 7 things to it, the only thing I didn't do was use Golden Mushroom soup, I can't find it anywhere here in WI, so I used cream of mush with roasted garlic.  We LOVE this and it is so easy!!

This is a GREAT recipe for the whole family. I made this last week with the some modifications suggested by other members and my husband and 2 sons absolutely loved this dish. I used 2 pounds of stew beef, 2 cans of the Golden Mushroom Soup, large chopped onion, Worcestershire, and a can of Progresso Onion Soup (that was in my cupboard). I was going to thicken it with cornstarch at the end, but after adding the sour cream and cream cheese there was no need! Served it over egg noodles and sat back and let the compliments roll in.

This is an easy and excellent recipe!  I made this for the first time and I was thinking of changing a few things to spice it up a bit but my teenage son told me that it was perfect.  It must have, because he polished it off while I was asleep that night!

My whole family enjoyed this. I used a chuck roast and doubled the recipe. It was very tender and flavorful. I added a 12oz package of noodles at the last 1/2 hour. If you do this, I recommend adding extra liquid, because it ended up quite thick.

This way soooo easy and sooo wonderful. My husband loved it so much he requests it for his birthday now.  I would DEFINITELY recommend the golden mushroom soup and not cream of mushroom. I also added a beef boullion cube, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, garlic, salt, pepper. Next time i might used less salt because there was plenty with the soups and boullion cube. Then I added the dollop of sour cream and 4 oz of cream cheese with a can of mushrooms about an hour before serving.  I could probably have stood less cream cheese because it made it very rich but my husband likes it that way.  I served it over egg noodles and it was excellent. but i think it would be very good over mashed potatos or a biscuit as well.  Definitely added to my "fool-proof" recipe list for when company comes.

Great recipe, I did use the advice of other reviewers and I double worchestershire, add fresh ground pepper and garlic powder.  I also add a tsp of beef bullion granules, and a can of mushrooms, drained and when ready to serve, add a "dollup" of sour cream.

This is the best beef stroganoff I have ever had!  I did make a few changes, though.  I needed to double the sauce and meat.  I used 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, 2 Tbsp worcestershire, 1/2 c beef broth (instead of water), and 2 lbs of meat.  I kept the cream cheese and onion the same.  I also added sauteed mushrooms about an hour before done, and added a dollup of sour cream with the cream cheese.  We ate this over egg noodles.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Very good, however I did make a couple of changes. Added a cup of sour cream, doubled the meat, 1/2 envelope of onion soup, 1/2 cup of beef broth along w/ the 1/4 cup of water, 2 cans of cream of mush, sauted mushroom, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. You will need to season this dish. Family loved it!

Very disappointing...although I think it was probably more the slow cooker than anything. Everything turned to mush, the meat all fell apart and burned at the bottom. I even used one of those slow cooker bags...I think I just hate the slow cooker.

O.M.G.  Good!  I should've increased the recipe because my family loved it.  I added "Mural of Flavor" to it - wonderful!  I am a beginner and this was easy and terrific tasting.

SO delicious! One note - I took all the advice of the wonderful reviewers who summed everything up and used cream cheese right before the finish.  Perhaps it was the fact that I used reduced-fat cream cheese, but it didn't melt very well and I ended up having to sift the un-melted pieces out.  Not very pretty, but super tasty!  (Though next time I fully intend to try it without the cream cheese!)

Only two changes - I used 2 cans of soup and then added about 1/2 cup greek yogurt(or you could use sour cream) with the cream cheese.  Oh, and I added mushrooms too!  It was fabulous!

If i could, i would give this 0 out of 5 stars.  The smell of this cooking was actually making my husband and I gag.  I think it might have been the onion soup...not really sure.  I sampled it and it tastes NOTHING like real beef stroganoff.  I was really excited to try something different but this whole meal went in the trash.  We will stick to the traditional beef stroganoff in our home.  We need to get the bad memory of this meal outta our heads before we even think about making the true stroganoff again.

Took the advice of all the most helpful reviews (they said it turned out great when they did so), but me and my husband both didn't care for it at all- an my husband isn't picky. I think because it was just so rich. I really wanted to like it. Pity.

Beef Stroganoff is my favorite dish and this recipe was absolutely delicious with the recommended changes!!  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and doubled the soup and water, added 1/2 pkg dried onion soup and 1/2 tsp garlic powder and I left out the onions entirely.  I added sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 hour before serving and only cooked the meat for 5 hours on low.  I added 1/3 cup of sour cream when I added the cream cheese, along with a slurry of 2 Tsp cold water and 1 Tsp corn starch to thicken everything up.  Instead of serving on top of egg noodles, I mixed it all up together in the crock pot before serving.  A - MA - ZING!!!

I always like to give the recipe a fair shot so instead of listening to others I stuck to the recipe. It was not as good as I expected. I had to be on top of it all day because it kept wanting to burn even on low heat. when it was finally finished it was really chunky. all in all the taste was OK but I will add more soup and water next time.

I love this!  I let the cream cheese sit on my counter all day so when I come home it's just right to mix in.  I also throw in a can of mushroom pieces, and I increase the stew meat to 1.5 pounds - we love our meat :)

Very good but not quite a 5 star.  The suggestion of doubling the soup for a more saucy stroganoff was quite helpful as well as adding sauteed mushrooms the last 1/2 hour.  The cream cheese did not melt and stir into the stew as nice as I would have thought - you could see minor clumps here and there.

i made it during the week when I work. I had to cook it for 8 hours on slow so I quadrupled the amount of water. Tasty.

Absolutely delicious!!  I'm going to throw out our old family recipe because this beats it hands down.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  Everyone loved it and I'll definately make this again.

This is 5 stars, but only if you follow JILLYBEAN14's recommendations.  I agree with other posters that it shouldn't be left in the crockpot all day.  I normally made this for a Sunday dinner and it was fabulous, but one day I made it in the morning before work and left it only to return to badly burned sides and meat that completely fell apart and became a meaty saucy mess.  6 hours is perfect.  Great comfort food.

Great recipe - you definitely need the GOLDEN mushroom soup.  I added 2 small containers of rinsed and chopped fresh button mushrooms (or you could use pre-sliced baby bellas) toward the end of cooking, and added cream cheese and sour cream until it looked like the right consistency.  If you're watching your sodium intake, don't make this dish...it's salty!!  But in a good way.  I also doubled the meat like some other people suggested.  Great winter recipe!

I make this all the time when we are having company, people love it! I took the advice of others here and use golden mushroom soup, but sometimes I use roasted garlic cream of mushroom and that turns out really well, too. Thanks for this great recipe!

Very good with the few suggested changes.  I used 2 cans of Golden Mushroom Soup, 1/2 cup water, garlic clove, pepper.  I also put 1/2 cup of sour cream in.  I might double the meat next time.  Wonderful recipe.  My 15 year old son asked me to pack it in his lunch.  That means it is two thumbs up for him!

I've never made beef stroganoff before, and this recipe is so easy! My husband and daughter both cleaned their plates with no complaint! The sauce was creamy, the meat was tender. Overall a very tasty and time efficient meal!

Excellent dish! Very easy, especially for cooking-incompetents like myself. The cooking time (5 hours on High) was way too high. Ours was done in 3.5 hours on high - it was starting to dry out and stick to the crock. Otherwise, PERFECT!!!

This was just OK for me.  I was so tempted to stray and use sour cream instead of the cream cheese but I wanted to stay true to the recipe.  I really had issues with getting the cream cheese to melt and I even softened it in the microwave first.  I like the idea and it is simple, but next time, I think I will use sour cream, and add some seasonings. Great base idea though, thanks for the recipe.

We just finished eating this dish. It was yummy. Followed JillyBean14 suggestions with few changes. We had 1/3 less fat cream cheese, no fresh mushrooms and dollup of lite sour cream. We will definitely make this one again.

This was pretty good. The meat was awesome!!! I usually make a similar stroganoff on the stove. I like the cream of mushroom sauce more than golden mushroom, so maybe I'll use 1 of each next time.  If you plan on eating this for more than 1 day, I'd double the recipe. It fed our family of 4, and left 1 bowl leftover.

This is a 5 star recipe with changes. Use 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup water, add a boullion cube and half a packet of dried onion soup mix. Add sauteed mushrooms at the end as well as a dollop of sour cream if you have it on hand. Only needs to cook for 5-6 hours on low. Serve over whole wheat wide noodles. I might add a little more meat next time.

I thought that this recipe was just okay.  It was a little bland, and lacked flavour.  My son didn't like it at all, he said it tasted sour.  I think that if I were to make it again, I would omit the cream cheese and add cream instead.

I followed another reviewer's modifications and it came out great!  The only change I made was I added a can of mushrooms instead of fresh because that's all I had. Whole family loved it!  I will definately make again.

I'm giving this 3 stars based only on flavor - and flavor I had to doctor up myself from reading other reviews. Overall, however, the sauce was WAY too runny (my fault for adding a bit more liquid than called for) and GLOPPY. I used 1+ lb beef stew meat which I diced into bite sized pieces (as I have a 17 month old), 1 can Golden mushroom condensed soup, 1 sweet onion, 1 T Worchestershire, 1/4 beef stock, 1/4 water (which I'll leave out next time), 1/4 tsp black pepper, salt, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 pck. dry Lipton Onion soup mix. I cooked on low for 7 hours total - beef was VERY tender and the sauce and beef both delicious in flavor. At 6 hours I added 4 oz. cream cheese and that's when I noticed how liquidy the sauce was. My cream cheese never fully melded with the sauce and there were flecks and gloppy chunks of cream cheese throughout even after an hour more of cooking. I attempted to thicken the sauce with 1/2 c. cold water mixed with 1 T. cornstarch, however, this had absolutely no affect on the liquidy sauce. Again, the flavor of the sauce after my seasoning a bit more was EXCELLENT. The liquidness (I accept blame) and the gloppiness...not good. Will I make it again? Yes. I will either cut back on the liquid next time when preparing w/1 lb meat OR add a second 1 lb of meat to my recipe above. My husband commented there was too little beef and too much onion. Also, I'll try sour cream at the end instead of cream cheese, I think.

Okay I did change this a bit. I wanted to make sure I had enough for left overs so I used 2 cans of the Golden Mushroom soup, plus I also added 1 packet of Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix. I had this in the slow cooker for about 6 hours. Only about an hour and half was on high. Wow, this was so good! My 6 year old son, who thinks that if something is a funny color or looks odd, will not eat it. It took some coaxing but I got him to try it and now he is begging me to make enough next time so that left overs will last a week! That makes this recipe a winner in my book! I should mention that my kids and I don't even like mushrooms but we all loved this and ate the mushrooms. They tasted like the egg noodles.

This is great dish!  Thank you, Jessica. I checked most of reviewers' comments, and it worked so good.   I would like to share my tip: before putting chopped onion in the cooker, I fry them with butter (I use healthy bar) until gets brown. This would give great taste.  Also, I made this both by slow cooker and ordinary deep pan.  The results are good for both!

Very Yummy.  I also changed the recipe based on what I had in the house.  I used the regular mushroom soup, but instead of onions, I used the Lipton "Beefy Onion" dry soup, which gave this a great flavor.  I also added a can of mushrooms (drained), which meant I didn't need to add any salt - the flavor was perfect!

Very good!  I made this according to the recipe except I did add a packet of onion soup mix and some sliced mushrooms (it probably would have been a little bland without them).  I also added a couple of ounces of sour cream instead of cream cheese.  To me, the cream cheese would have made this too rich, but that's just my opinion.  It turned out great!

My first attempt at using a slow cooker.  Easy.  Hearty.  Tasted good.  If you're like me, and get home late from work a lot, please note that the dish will dehydrate beyond all recognition after 10 hrs.  I managed to bring it back from the dead by stirring in another can of soup, and to my surprise, it still tasted fine.  I might try it again and double the liquids for good measure...

Sooo good! Just added a little salt and pepper to taste. I loved that it was extremely simple to make; some slow cooker recipes have a tendancy to be just as difficult as a regular recipe and that definitely wasn't the case with this one!

Good... would make again with few minor changes.  Brown meat in skillet before putting in slow cooker.  Add two beef bouillon, sliced mushrooms, and tablespoon garlic.

I used 2 pounds of sirloin tip steak instead of stew meat.  I also added 8 ounces of sliced baby portabello mushrooms.  I did not increase any of the liquids.  This was fabulous.

If I were to make this again I would cut the cream cheese in half as other viewers suggested.  I was not crazy about the way the canned soup made this taste, but that is just me. I don't like any canned soup recipes.  this one had that taste.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on all the favorable reviews and its ease of preparation. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. While it smelled great cooking, the flavor and texture left a lot to be desired. The cream cheese made the meat/soup mixture extremely thick, so I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream to try to thin it out a bit (per other reviewers). My kids didn't like it either. Definitely not a stroganoff as I know it. I will not be making this recipe again. :(

not bad, but too salty! If I make again, I will use a different mushroom soup, (low sodium). Cream cheese did not mix up completely either.

Delicious!  I read some reviews and made changes accordingly.  I used dried minced onion, golden mushroom soup and half a small container of sour cream, 4 cloves of minced garlic and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Also added mushrooms.  The sauce was very thick, even with the amount of water recommended so I added about 1/2 C. more throughout cooking.  When it came time to add the cream cheese, I added the amount said and also the rest of the container of sour cream.  It was really great, I will make this recipe a regular.

This was pretty good once the cream cheese was added. However, I let it cook all day so once I mixed it, the meat more less fell apart.

I had a frozen (about 1 1/3 lb) rump beef roast in the freezer.  I thawed it in the fridge about 24 hours, then cut it into about 2-3" cubes, cutting out the big chunks of fat, too.  I threw the cubes in the crock pot & the called-for ingredients, along with double the called for amount of both golden mushroom soup & water.  I also added garlic, salt and a generous amount of black pepper.  I didn't measure the ingredients, just eyeballed it.  I thought it was cooking on low but thanks to a loose knob on my crock pot, was actually cooking on High.  I checked it after about 4 hours and it looked pretty done.  Turned it down to Low after realizing the mistake, then took the big chunks of meat out with a slotted spoon and shred them into smaller bits and eliminated the rest of the major fat chunks.  I threw the meat back in the crock pot & added my brick of cream cheese,  sliced into about 5 chunks, a dollop of sour cream & about two Tbps of beef broth.  I cooked it about 10 more minutes on Low, stirring occasionally for the cream cheese to mix well, before eating over No Yolk noodles.  Delicious!!!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is make sure I let it cook a bit longer with the cream cheese in it because I could see the little white chunks, even though it tasted smooth & great!

This is so easy in a slow cooker and such comforting food.  First time I followed recipe exactly and stew meat turned out sort of bland.  Second time I made it, I adjusted the recipe with four additional ingredients which I already had on hand. 1) Garlic salt and 2) black pepper for seasoning(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to reduce blandness of stew meat), rub all over the lovely tender meat. 3) Beef broth instead of water.  4) Sliced white mushrooms to add to slow cooker in last 30 minutes of cooking.  They all made this dish so much more tastier.  The next time I will add sour cream as some reviewers have suggested.  Keeper for all those busy working days but still want to eat home cooked food.  Serve over No Yolks Noodles.

Made in a crockpot at work on day for a potluck meal and it cooked well.  I think maybe my next run will not have cream cheese, sour cream only.

Made this tonight for dinner.  I like to have SCS - Slow Cooker Sundays.  Only change I made was to add a packet of dry onion soup mix rather than the chopped onion.  This.Is.Awesome.

This turned out great with just one revisiont - you certainly should add the 4 oz of cream cheese as stated, but also add about 1/2 cup of sour cream as well. This adds the sourness that I think beef stroganoff requires. Other than that, this turned out delicious and my husband raved about it.

This is a very easy very tasty recipe. My family and I however enjoy more "gravy" so we double up on all the ingredients except the meat. We also use regular cream of mushroom soup and simply add 1 tsp of beef Better than Bouillon. Thanks for the recipe it's definitely a keeper!

Doubled the soup and added some onion soup mix as many suggested.  I thought it was quite good.  The kids liked it more than I for some reason.  Will make again though.

I don't think I have ever left a review, but this one deserves it! This was the best best stroganoff I have ever had. I followed the advice of Momsavedbygrace and Jillybean14 and doubled the meat, and soup. I used 2 cups of onions, diced very fine, light cream cheese, 1/4 c reduced fat sour cream and a whole packet of Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix. I sauteed 24 oz of mushrooms, drained the liqiud, and added it in the last 1/2 hour. I also added 2 TBLS cornstarch 10 minutes before I added the cream cheese and sour cream. Served over whole wheat egg noodles and it was so delicious! Thanks for a great starting point, Jessica, and thank you to the reviewers who modified!

Fantastic!  I doubled the sauce as many posted but left the cream cheese and worcestershire sauce the same, added a tablespoon of sour cream as well and fresh mushrooms during the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I also left this for 5½ hours on low, no need to leave it on for 8 as the original instructions say.  Oh, and don't forget to season the meat before you add it to the cooker.

I was disappointed in this. It tastes like beef gravy and not stroganoff. Even with the addition of a lot of sour cream, this recipe just fell flat. Won't make it again.

this was very good though next time I will omit additional salt (my mistake) it was salty enough with the worcestershire sauce & soup. I did flour & brown the meat and it did thicken the sauce. I used a dallop of sour cream a few minutes before I served it. My kids went nuts, they loved it! They normally like Hamburger Helper and this was 100x more delicious (and probably way better for them too!) Great recipe, thanks!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it is a tasty and very easy recipe that is great for busy people.  I wasn't amazed by the taste ( I basically followed the recipe as is and did not use all of the suggestions from the many reviewers) but my husband and I definitely enjoyed it and I appreciated the simplicity.  I could see that it could be improved with the other additions suggested if you have a little extra time.

This is THE stroganoff recipe!!  I added the cream cheese with the other ingredients to start and it didn't make any difference.  I also added beefy onion dry soup mix and a boullion cube and a dollop of sour cream at the end with the noodles.  This was the best stroganoff I've ever had and amazing comfort food!

This was the best stroganoff i've ever tasted.  The cream cheese give it a nice smooth flavor.  Not like the sour cream which I always thought was a bit too tart.  I used 2 pounds of stew meat, but did not double the ingredients and it turned out great.  My son and his friend even liked it!

Made this last night for my husband and some friends, everyone loved it! A great recipe for people (like me) who can't make anything with more that 5 ingredients lol. I doubled the recipe, used 3 cans of golden mushroom, beef broth instead of water. Put in pepper and two cloves of garlic, and used 8 oz of cream cheese and about 2 oz of sour cream right before serving. OH and you can't forget the mushrooms! With a bottle of Merlot...Perfect!

Yum! I used ground turkey instead of stew meat, browned it with the onions and paprika, and threw it in the slow cooker with the golden mushroom soup. It smelled so good when I got home! I added the cream cheese and I happened to have some sour cream so I tossed that in there as well. This is some of the easiest and best stroganoff I've had at home!

I loved this recipe, with a few modifications.  I seasoned the meat with black pepper and garlic powder then toss with about a Tbsp of flour as this helps thicken the sauce while cooking.  I used 2 cans of Campbell's Condensed Golden Mushroom soup, 2 beef bouillon cubes dissolved in 1/2 cup water and I also added a dollop of sour cream with the cream cheese just before serving.  This is "true" comfort food, in my opinion!

With reviews 5 stars++!! YUM!!  In crock-pot combine meat, golden mushroom soup, onion, Worcestershire, water, and bouillon cube.  Season with salt, pepper, and garlic.  Cook on LOW setting for 6 hours. During the last hour of cooking, stir in cream cheese and a large dollop of sour cream. Sauté mushrooms in butter and set aside.   Cook noodles and drain water.  Serve stroganoff over egg noodles and top each serving with the sautéed mushrooms.

I thought it watery and like another reviewer said, the cream cheese clumped and didn't melt.  Will try again but will do it with the sour cream instead and less liquidy.

For some reason, this recipe came out watery, and the cream cheese never seemed to melt properly in the mixture. It was more like cream cheese clumps in a watery stew. Maybe cream would have worked better. It just didn't work for me.

This was very easy and tasty! My boyfriend doctored it up a bit after I left for work (sneaky...) but his changes were pretty good! He apparently added a can of mushrooms, a chopped onion, and some extra beef. I ate mine over a piece of warm french bread and added sour cream with the cream cheese. The beef was super tender and it was a good meal for a cozy night on the couch. Will definitely try this again!

A very good recipe - quick, easy, cost effective, and a treat to come home to. I found out at the last minute that I didn't have cream cheese so I served it with sour cream and noodles -delish!  Oh and I put 8 oz sliced mushrooms in at the beginning with the half packet of onion soup and they turned out fine.

I've finally found the best Stroganoff recipe known to man! I took the advice of other reviewers and added a 1/2 packet of onion soup mix to the sauce. I decided that since I had over a pound of stew meat I would increase the sauce by adding another can of mushroom soup as well. I only had one can of golden mushroom, so the other can ended up being plain old cream of mushroom. I was in such a hurry the morning I made this I did not add any additional seasonings, not even pepper, (which I put in everything!) and it still had enough flavor (I also kinda eyeballed the water and Worcestershire) for me. I did cheat and use 4oz of sour cream instead of cream cheese--I had an open container of the stuff and decided to get rid of it instead of cracking open a brand new package of Philly. Next time I will try it with the cream cheese for sure. I served this over buttered egg noodles--the best!

Excellent!  We use low fat cream cheese and low fat soup and it turns out great.  We also use No Yolks noodles to keep the cholesterol down.

My family really liked this recipe.  I did take into account the other reviews such as doubling the soup and water and add 1/2 pack of onion soup mix, but didn't add the mushrooms as our kids don't like them. Thanks for sharing

This was great!  We don't like mushrooms, so I made the following adjustments: 2 lbs cubed beef, 1/2 chopped onion, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 TBSP worcestershire, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, 3 beef buillon cubes, 2/3 c water.  Added 8 oz sour cream just before serving.

My family liked it a lot.  It was ok for me.  I can't decide why...I used Jillybean14's suggestions.  Maybe too many onions and the cream cheese. I will use a different recipe next time.

this came out decent - I maded the following changes: TWO cans of golden mushroom soup, added salt, pepper, garlic powder, minced pickled garlic, and used beef broth instead of water. Then added fresh mushrooms half an hour before done and sour cream before serving. Even with all of this, I would marinate the meat overnight to make it more tender. Probably use Lawry's Pepper and Onion Steak Marinade and my wife suggests chopped parsley on top before serving and maybe adding some red wine while slow cooking.

Great recipe! My husband has never been a big fan...but he loved it! Can't wait to make it again. Oh yeah, i used cream of mushroom because i couldn't find the cream of golden mushroom soup that the recipe had originally called for...no worries, it was just as good!

I thought this was WONDERFUL. Smelled SO good while it was cooking and tasted just as yummy when it was done. Doubled Golden Mushroom soup, added garlic and sauteed baby portebella mushrooms 30 minutes before done. This will be a regular in my household. Great recipe!

Out of this world.  The meat will come out tender no matter what cut of meat you use.  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed. I added fresh mushrooms that I had cooked in a little butter and added them at the end.

Yum. This isn't hard. Double the recipe like others have suggested. I don't use fresh onions. A half of a packet of the onion soup mix works very well. I have made this at least 5 times now. If you don't double it the ingredients dry out in the crock pot.

Yummy! I used both sour cream and cream cheese. Added Dijon mustard and some beef boullion. Used only fresh sliced mushrooms, added 1/2 cup of brewed coffee and 1/4 cup red wine in the crock pot to make more liquid for extra sauce. Still not as good as Grandma used to make, and I doubt I will ever find anything as good.

This was really good.  I used sour cream in place of cream cheese and used one package of onion soup mix with water added.  It was so easy.  Warmed it up for lunch today and it was even better in my opinion the second day.

I wish I would have made this recipe as it stated instead of reading others reviews.  I added onion soup mix as suggested and yuck!  It doesn't belong in there.  I also reduce the cream cheese as suggested and ending up using the full amount it called for.  This recipe it good as it, I don't know why people change it so much.  Adding sour cream and sauteed mushrooms was a good idea, just personal preference.  Thanks!

Wow this dish was amazing !!! I did as everyone does, and read the reviews for suggestions and the things i did different were; added an extra can of CREAM of Mushroom (regular), garlic powder, onion powder, fresh sliced mushrooms ( i did NOT saute them first)and i made the water very hot and added a beef bouillon cube and no cream cheese (it was way rich enough with out it) it was outstanding and something i would make again !!!!

This was easy and tasty.  I have a large family, so I doubled the recipe.  There were some leftovers, which heated up nicely for lunch at work the next day.  The only small issue I encountered was that the cream cheese didn't entirely dissolve when I stirred it in, but that could be because I used an off brand.  I definately will make this again and would recommend it!

This was very good but I prefer the Simple Hamburger Stroganoff recipe from this site. I am giving it a 5 star still because my hubby liked it but not exactly what my taste buds were wanting.

VERY GOOD!!!!  I changed some things because of other reviewers comments and it came out perfect!  (2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1/2 cup water, garlic, 1/2 packet onion soup, beef bouillion cube, fresh mushrooms & everything else the same)  Served it over egg noodles.

I love this recipe! I make the original recipe (No need to change it) and I've also used others suggestions. Both are excellent! I make it on the stovetop when I'm pressed for time using leftover roast beef & keeping all the ingredients the same. The only thing I add when cooking on the stove is 1/2 packet of onion soup mix - only because the meat needs a boost of extra flavor since the simmering time is shorter than the crockpot.  My family gobbles it up!

I had never had, nor had I ever made Beef Stroganoff. I have made this 4x now. The 1st time I made it just like the recipe. It was surprisingly good, so I decided to make it again using the help of reviewers. I followed the suggestions of JILLYBEAN14, with the exception of sautéing the mushrooms and adding sour cream. I put everything in at once in the crock-pot and I served it over al dente egg noodles. It.Was.Fantastic. So good you don't even know, you have to make it! Because I now make it using those suggestions I give it 4 stars.

Turned out great.  I agree that you should double the sauce by adding 2 cans of the golden mushroom soup, doubling the amount of water, and doubling the meat.  Also add spices, such as salt, pepper, and garlic.  Also, it was definitely done after cooking for 5 hours on low, no need to cook for 8 hours.  I found it odd that one of the main ingredients was not included in the original recipe: mushrooms!  Definitely a must.  I will be making this again.

very very good- I nanny a one and two year old and they are very picky, but ate this! I don't have a slow cooker and all I had in the house was gr beef so I cookes that on the stove with 2 cans of the golden mushroom soup, and 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix.  Also I cooked it with a whole onion and fresh garlic. I love the cream cheese in it!  I added 2 tbs of sour cream.  I have already made this twice in a week for my boyfriend and the kids- both are tough sceptics and both liked it! thankyou

Jessica, thank you A ZILLION times over for this recipe!!! If I could eat this every day I would!  I followed most of Jillybean14's suggestions (below) - add a little salt, pepper, garlic, double the golden mushroom soup to two cans, water to 1/2 cup, added a bullion cube, added a dollop of sour cream in when i added the cream cheese, and of course served over egg noodles - and it has been a huge hit with everyone I've served it to!  again, thank you thank you thank you!!!

I doubled the soup, onion and water.  Kept the worchester sauce and cream cheese the same.  Added a dallop of sour cream with the cream cheese and served with sauteed green and red peppers over egg noodles.  Very good!

I have made this recipe a few times, and I follow the reviewers advice with all the additions, and I really find this dish plain. After it cooked and everyone ate, I added crushed red pepper, cayanne, and a healthy dose of black pepper. Leftovers were better.

This is what beef stroganoff should taste like.  I used top round steak sliced into small pieces, and shallot instead of regular onion.  Also threw in a beef bouillion cube.  Served it over bowtie noodles.  Comforting and profoundly delicious.

Following JILLYBEAN14's review, this was awesome!!! The only difference from her tips was omitting the bouillon, using half pack of BEEFY ONION soup mix, and serving over Barilla Plus Rotini Noodles.  Going in the "paper" recipe box.

I wouldn't make this again... The meat is very tender, but I felt the rest of the dish was completely flavorless. If you read the recommended alterations, I'm sure it would be better, but definitely not the recipe that's listed here!

This was so yummy.  I made a few changes tho.  Doubled the cream of mushroom soup (did not have golden cr. of mush) added a jar of sliced mushrooms, doubled water and worstershire sauce and added a beef stew season packet with cut up beef stew meat and chopped onions.  I cooked in slow cooker on high for 3-4 hrs. then turned down to low for about 2 hrs. I used about 2oz. of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream near the end.  Served over buttered noodles and baby peas on the side.  I took some over for my mom and dad and they loved it.  This is a keeper. thanks

My husband really liked this but I was not a fan.  The sides started burning about 2 hours into cooking, even on the lowest setting, not sure if it's my crock pots fault or not though.  I don't plan on making this one again.

It's a keeper! I used a round steak cut up and followed the changes in the popular reviews.  Blended the cooked mixture with cooked egg noodles. Yum-O!

My kids ate it and that says a lot! My hubby liked it too, but he would prefer it with about half the cream cheese.  I will make it again, but add a few spices next time.  I'm also planning on making it for a freezer meal swap with some friends.

I have used this website for recipies for about 4 years. I have never reviewed anything until now. I acually created an account just to review this.

This is so yummy I just do not know what to say. I always follow the recipie to the T with one exeption, I DOUBLE IT because the serving size sugsested is not enough. My Mom who is the best cook ever never thought of using cream cheese instead of sour cream...trust me this makes it so tasty. As usual with all recipies adjust to your liking but just try as is first. I have thrown in an extra beef boullion cube and maybe a little sour cream to thicken (or more cream cheese if I have it) but this is just awesome as is. My daughter even brags about my stroganoff to her friends...sorry Jessica but since my kid knows no better I have to take your claim to fame on this! Thanks for the recipie, I would have not thought of cream cheese vs. sour cream, now I will never go back!

Excellent! I would give five but I had to add spices to make it perfect. Great starter though. I love the sour cream in it, certainly couldn't skimp on that for it makes the recipe what it is.
Thanks for this awesome recipe!

OMG...First time my family said delicious to something I tried. They loved it . I did follow the modifications stated .  I have 3 boys and a very picky husband. They all loved it . I recommend boiling an entire package of nooodles with this.It was really good. I used sour cream instead of cream cheese just becasue I knew the taste would be too strong for us ..Turned out perfect . Will do this one again for sure

I followed the list of modifications of the review right below this, and it was delicious! The only thing I did differently was stir in about 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream for a creamier consistency and a smoother taste. Next time I'd double or triple the recipe to make it last more than two days (it really does only make about four servings).

I have read many reviews and my first change was I made this a "Pressure Cooker Stroganoff", rather than a "Slow Cooker".  I used double the meat and double the gravy ingredients... this was my only mistake.  There was too much gravy.  I also didn't have mushrooms, but will add them next time.  That will be my only other modification to what I had done already.  I coated the meat in flour and browned it in a separate pot.  At the same time, I sweat the onions in the pressure cooker.  I used a boullion cube and an entire package of onion soup mix.  I added garlic, worstechire and pepper, but no salt because the onion soup, worstechire and boullion have plenty.  I added the browned meat to the gravy mixture and heat the pressure cooker on high until full pressure and then turned it down low for 60 minutes.  The meat just fell apart in your mouth.  Delicious!  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

I only gave this four stars because this recipe does need a few modifications. I really liked another recipe on this website, beef stroganoff II, but liked the idea of just throwing everything into my slow cooker and letting it do the work. So it was pretty good, but could use some work.

Yum, yum!  I've made this a few times now.  I use onion soup mix and beef broth. I may add real mushrooms next time.  My hubby loves it and we are always looking for more!!  I may double it next time so that there are leftovers.  I cook it on low for just 5 hours or so.  Sooooo easy to make and delicious!!

I followed some of the reviewer's suggestions by doubling the golden mushroom soup and water. I browned the beef with onions and then mixed half a pouch of liption onion soup mix with a beef bouillion. Added salt, pepper and garlic and cooked on high for about 5 hours. It was delish! Served with noodles. I also added sauteed mushrooms.

Very easy on the cook meal. Added salt and pepper, garlic, and sliced mushrooms. Cooked for 5 hours on low and stirred in some sour cream at the end. Also doubled the soup and water, as per other reviewers' suggestions. Next time I will sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley to add to the eye appeal. Thanks!

Great recipe. I doubled the sauce using beef broth instead of water leaving the cream cheese the same and really just didnt feel like chopping onions so I used a half of a packet of onion soup mix, next time I'll throw the whole packet or chop some onions. I also threw in some peas at the end, I only had a little over half a cup and not enough to serve as a side. Served over egg noodles and it was great.

Did this recipe with some changes just because this is what I had on hand. Use italian meatballs instead. Recipe pretty much stayed the same except that I doubled it. It was fantastic and got great reviews from family and friends.

Tried this recipe for the 1st time, and my husband went for THIRDS! :)  I incorporated the changes suggested by others (1.  double the meat, soup & water, 2.  add salt, pepper, one clove of chopped garlic, and 1/2 packet of onion soup mix to the mixture, 3.  add fresh mushrooms 30 minutes before serving and 4.  add 2 large dallups of sour cream when mixing in the cream cheese).  The meal came out really fantastic served over egg noodles.  I'd recommend this easy recipe in a heartbeat!

I followed the advice of JILLYBEAN14 and I did the following modifications: (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.

Everyone really liked this one.  I wasn't to hip on the stew meat.  I usually like ground beef in stroganoff.  But, the sauce was delicious.  We will make it again.

This just didn't taste like the stroganoff I'm used too. My cream cheese didn't blend, and the taste was not tangy. I wish I'd have skipped the cheese and just put in sour cream. I ended up adding a splash of white vinegar for some added tang. We ate it, but I won't make again.

I am only giving the orginal recipe a 4 b/c it needed a few things added to it.  I agree with the other reviews it needs the sour cream to give it the right "tang" and the addition of fresh sauteed mushrooms and Lipton onion soup really helped with the flavor.  All in all pretty good.  It won over my 6 year old son who usually doesn't like anything!

Will make again. I did make some changes based on what I had on hand at the time. I used regular cream of mushroom soup, no water, added a can of french onion soup, used a little over half a cup of sour cream in place of the cream cheese and added a little corn starch to thicken up the sauce at the end of cooking time.

This was really good.  I added a few things, such as a little extra beef stock and garlic.  No mushrooms because our family doesn't like them.  I put it on a little late in the day and the meat was still a bit tough when we ate it, but the sauce more than made up for it.  I would put it in for longer next time.

this was really good. i used beef broth instead of water. i hadnt ever cooked w/ golden mushroom soup before. it gave the sauce a really great flavor. almost tasted like i used sherry in it. i would make it on a day when you are home so you can check on the sauce and make sure it doesnt dry out

I loved the golden mushroom soup gravy. I did add some wine and I served with parsley buttered egg noodles. This was super easy and super good with the cream cheese! I did add a spoonful of sour cream before serving but how could anyone not?

I gotta say, this was good.  But, it's becoming a big pet peeve of mine when there are like 8 modified ingredients to a recipe listed in the reviews.  I don't mean this in a crabby way, but I read the reviews after adding the recipe to my shopping list and shopping for the stuff - then to find out the changes were things that I didn't have on hand (in this case I couldn't find golden mushroom soup and just got cream of mushroom soup THEN read the reviews).  I'd love to start a movement....if there are many changes to a recipe - post an 'improved' version so I can avoid the frustration of seeing that I shouldn't have bothered making it with plain mushroom soup :)

This recipe is yummy!! I kept the amount of beef, (fat-free) cream cheese, and Worcestershire sauce the same as directed on the recipe. I increased the gravy by using two cans of golden mushroom soup and a half cup of water. I chopped up a medium onion and added a generous amount of fresh, sliced mushrooms--probably 8oz as we love mushrooms.  I also added a packet of onion soup mix and some cayenne pepper.  I set the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Love this recipe and will make again soon!

This beef stroganoff is amazing! I did everything according to JILLYBEAN14 and it turned out great. I made it before but used cream of mushroom soup and it wasn't as good. Definitely use golden mushroom soup. This is now my favorite dinner!

I am reviewing this recipe using the changes made by JILLYBEAN 14 left on July 6,2005. I have not used just the orginal recipe. With the additions it is truly a wonderful recipe.  So I give credit to both who contribed to this recipe.  I loved it and my family loved it.  It will be made again and again.  It is now one of my all time favorites.  I want to thank both Jessica and JILLYBEAN 14 for a truly great recipe.

This is a very good recipe, but after using other reviewers' advice my dad said it was his number 1, favorite thing I have ever made him!  I used beef stock instead of water, added a pack of onion soup mix, pepper and garlic powder.  Kept the cream cheese as is, but also served it with sour cream!  Amazing!

I loved this recipe! It's so easy and oh so good. I did double the soup and water but not the worchestershire sauce or cream cheese. I added about half a cup of sour cream also at the end. I served it over egg noodles with a salad.  Can't wait to make it again.

YUMMY! This was flat AWESOME. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly except for the cream cheese -- I thought 8 oz would be too much, so I only put in 4 oz and it came out perfectly.  It was better than I thought it would be.  I will definitly be making this one again!

I usually make a stroganoff that does not have canned soup or cream cheese in it, but this had good reviews so I gave it a try.  I did all the adjustments that the reviews suggested.  It tasted like a hamburger helper sauce.  I added wine as well but it still lacked any complexity, very disappointed.

I followed the recipe pretty close with a few modifications.  I substituted beef broth for water and doubled the measurements on the broth and the cream of mush soup.  I also added garlic, salt, pepper and a few tablespoons of red wine.  I didn't read many reviews that added red wine, but I thought it made a huge difference...definitely add it!  All in all...it was a huge hit and I highly recommend this dish!

This was an awesome recipe!  I did follow Jillybeans14 review and modified it like she said.  In case you can't find her review this is what I did.  I added garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 2 cans of the Golden Mushroom soup, 1 beef bouillon cube, and sauteed mushrooms 1/2 hour before serving. I also cubed the cream cheese and stirred in and put my crock pot on warm and let it sit for about 15 minutes.  It was very tasty!  Even my very picky 7-year-old loved it!

Hubby's fave meal is stroganoff, I don't like it personally but he loves it and says this recipe is a keeper! I followed others advice in last few reviews and it turned out great...never tried the original recipe, sorry.

I took the advice of JILLYBEAN14's list of recommendations and it came out excellent.  My only future change would be to try the recipe without (#7) the half-package of onion soup mix.  I tasted these ingredients right away and, to me, it gave it an altogether different flavor than I'm used to with a beef stroganoff. Still, this is an excellent variation of the original recipe.

I've looked for a good beef stroganoff for some time but this one just wasn't good. I guess I listened to other reviewers and put onion soup mix which made it terrible, especially the after taste. The cream cheese didn't dissolve and was floating around  in small chunks. Golden mushroom soup is also not a good idea for this recipe, has weird flavor. I won't make it again. Maybe I should've just followed the original recipe but I was turned off completely by others' ideas. I guess I'm still looking for a good beef stroganoff recipe...

My hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe!. The Golden Mushroom Soup is the key to this receipe.  Don't subsitute it with Cream of Mushroom Soup. I used 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese it worked really well. I also added in extra mushroom at the end to make it more chucky. Will definitely make it again!

This was top notch! Will be making again and again. I cooked it on high and needed to add some water around the third hour. I also added a few tablespoons of red wine a bit later. Completely forgot the cream cheese (actually, I was going to add sour cream but forgot). Even my one year old couldn't get enough! Thanks!!

This was good and I would definitely make it again.  I followed the advice of others and used double meat & soup, and a whole onion.  To ensure that it did not burn I cooked it on low (8 hour setting) for only 6 hours.  Cooked the meal for 6 hours and put it in the refrigerator for the next day (without the cream cheese).  Warmed up the meal on the stove for dinner the next day and added about 8 oz. of cream cheese for texture.  Next time I will probably use 2 small onions and fresh mushrooms.

I use allrecipes.com because I love the feedback and rating scale...tried and true, right? Not so much for me in this case. I think that it possibly burned? I had it on low for about 6 hours. Flavor was terrible.

Delicious!  I love beef stroganoff with ground beef, but now that I've had with stew meat, I'll never go back.  I did follow some of the suggestions to add salt, pepper, boullion cube, garlic, a tbsp or so of sour cream when you add the cream cheese.  Turns out perfectly every time, the meat is so tender!

This really is the best beef stroganoff recipe, but keep in mind that there are 890 mg's of sodium per can of soup. The worchestershire sauce, boullion, onion soup mix and additional salt may not be necessary, especially for those watching their blood pressure. Loved it, though, of course!

I got a slow cooker for Christmas and this was the first recipe I made in it.  I only made a few changes.  I used beef broth instead of water and increased the amount to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup.  I added a little black pepper and some garlic.  My family loved it.  No leftovers!  Thanks for the great recipe

So my review is based on the recipe as written.  It is pretty decent.  I didn't really miss the sour cream like I thought I would.  I did have to add salt to taste while I was eating it.  Next time I will add more onions and some mushrooms.  For a quick and basic recipe, this was all right.

This was good for a slow cooker meal; however, I was raised on meatball stroganoff and prefer the taste so much better.  Also, the 4 oz of sour cream was not enough for my taste so I added another 4 oz, but this could be a preference.  Overall a semi-good meal.

OK I know this recipe doesn't need another review, but it was just OK.  i did all the reccomended modifications (but thankfully did not add salt), I used more sour cream than a "dollap" and used whipped cream cheese which blended well.  It was OK but not memorable.  My husband thought it looked like cat food (but he cleaned his plate, MEOW!)

A very well received recipe in my family, the only changes I made were seasoning the beef then brown on the stove before adding the crock-pot also during the last hour I added frozen peas. Thank You for the ***** 5star recipe everyone loves it!

I love this recipe, but the only reason I've given it 4 stars is because I think it's almost impossible to add cream cheese without having it clump.  I add some red wine (1/4 cup) at the beginning, and I substitute sour cream for cream cheese.

I'm sorry but In my opinion, this recipe is missing a lot of what makes stroganoff, stroganoff.  I just found it to be standardish so-so  hum drum crock pot fare
HOWEVER, the idea of using some cream cheese in place of or even combined with the sour cream does give it something.  Personally, I'd rather make stroganoff with tons of fresh mushrooms, oregano, sherry etc.  It is very easy to make and offers a simple ingredient list and isn't horrible tasting....so I'll give it 3 stars.

I added a little more water because the previous reviews had me worried that it would burn, plus I had to use cream of celery b/c hubby won't eat mushrooms.  He didn't like it - I thought it was good!

Woo-hoo! made this for dinner tonight and it goooood! i didn't use water, used 1/2 a package of McCormick mushroom flavored gravy and mixed with 1/2 a cup of water and stirred in a couple of tablesoopns of sour cream  w/ the cream cheese at the end. Also I recomend 4hrs. on high in a slowcooker, any more than that the meat gets a little dry. but overall a great recipie thanks!

I'll make this again, but make these changes: More beef. At LEAST double the sauce mix. Cook on Low for 8 hours and watch it closely (mine burned on Low for 10 hours) Add: Pepper Beef broth, Minced garlic. Sour cream instead of cream cheese. It had a good taste, but there's not enough, which is why I'm pretty sure it burned.....

Fantastic!  I used JilyBean's 7/2005 suggestions,
"(1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same,(3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving.",  minus the onion soup mix and it came out very good but I think next time I will try it with the onion soup. Thanks for the recipe and the advice!  Everyone in my house loved it! Even my 2 year old had 2 servings :o).

This was really delicious & easy to make. The cream cheese is really key & make sure you get exactly the mushroom soup that it calls for.

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it.  I added my seasonings to taste.  I could not find the golden mushroom soup so I just use campbell's cream of mushroom soup.  I did increase the sauce by using 3 cans of soup.  I keot the cream cheese the same and used 4 ounces of sour cream at the end.  I did not add the onions until about an hour before it was done and they came out fine.  I did add 2 small cans of mushrooms.  I will definetly make this again.  Very easy, very good.

I honestly can't think of an easier stroganoff recipe!  This was delicious!  My mistake was that I didn't trust the recipe and added more water.  I put it on before going to bed and thought it would cook down too much by morning.  It had more than enough sauce and I will follow the proportions to a tee next time!  I also did as one other person suggested and added some McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning.  Very good!!

I followed the other reviews here and added half a pkt of onion soup mix,( I diddnt omit the onion entirely, I used maybe a 1/4 cup of it)and dbled the condensed soup. Next time I won't double that because we had so much sauce left over. I diddnt add water,I used half a can of wine instead, and sauteed a jar of mushrooms I had on hand and threw them the last hour of cooking. I added a tablespoon of tomato paste,and some garlic, and a tsp. of boullion paste. I used sliced/cubed chuck steak, because it was on sale and I seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper and shook it in flour and seared it in the skillet for a bit before adding it to the crockpot. The meat was so tender and delicious. I did add extra pepper to the sauce.
I did use 4 oz of cream cheese, I even cubed it and there were still some little lumps in the sauce. I added sour cream as well. I enjoyed it and the family liked it too.

I thought this was a great, easy recipe. I used top sirloin instead of stew meat, and sliced it into strips. I doubled the recipe, left out the onions, and added 1/4 cup white wine and a packet of onion soup mix. I cooked it on high for an hour, then on low for a few hours. When it was time to mix the cream cheese in, I took out the beef so I could mix up the sauce easier (there are a lot of clumps) then I put the beef back in. Served it with egg noodles.

Absolutely delicious! This is definately a meal to satisfy the whole family. My whole family went back for seconds and thirds!  I added 1 packet of French onion soup mix, salt, pepper and a dollup of sour cream with the cream cheese as suggested by other reviewers and it came out perfect.

Husband LOVES this. I also added in about 1.5 tbsp of sour cream and not quite so much cream cheese. Doesn't make all that much, so double it if you're feeding a family or want leftovers.

I follow the directs and mine came out soupy. Didn't taste much like stroganoff, but the meat was tender, and the overall recipe was o.k. I guess i was looking forward to the real thing. Thanks anyway.

This recipe was just ok. The flavor was decent (I've had better) and the convenience factor would have been great - EXCEPT that I found the amount of ingredients didn't lend itself to an 8 hour simmer fest in my crock pot. By the time I came home after work, half the beef mixture was crusted over and burnt to the sides of the crock pot. And it was on it's lowest setting. Perhaps next time if I double it there will be more food to cook through. Ahh, who am I kidding? I won't be making this again. I'm compiling great recipes to wow my future husband when we get married. This one definetly doesn't make the cut! I'll keep looking.

This was REALLY good and so easy.  I did replace some of the cream cheese with sour cream.  I dumped the cooked egg noodles in the slow cooker along with 2T butter and a little Parmesan cheese and it was absolutley delicious.

This was great!  Like other reviewers I added the cream cheese towards the end and let it cook for a little over 30 minutes to get the lumps to "melt" and blend in, plus I added fresh sliced mushrooms about 2 hours before it was finished.  Good stuff on a cold winter day!

Whenever I make this recipe it is a sure fire hit.  The only thing I do differently is use about 2/3 of the cream cheese and 1/3 sour cream.

It's very, very good.  I would almost give it 5 stars but my own pressure cooker stroganoff recipe just refuses to be upstaged.  Did you know you can add a little yellow food coloring to the water you boil your egg noodles in to make a nicer presentation?  I added about a half a 4oz jar of mushrooms to this to give a little more body.  But you won't go wrong with this recipe.  It's delicious!

This was another great meal.  I love that it took less than 5 minutes to prepare in the morning.  I used cream of mushroom as my store doesn't carry golden mushroom.  I also used beef broth instead of water.  I cooked on low for 9 hours and it did not burn at all, but made the meat nice and tender.  When I got home I turned it on high and added 2 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms while I waited for my pasta to cook.  I loved it while my family ate it but didn't care for it.

This was absolutely delicious!! I solved the problem of the cream cheese that other people noted, but putting in the softened cream cheese an hour before the stroganoff was done. I also pressed out any lumps that I could find. After an hour of cooking, the cheese became very smooth. I also added 1/8 cup red wine (replacing half of the water), some garlic powder and mushrooms to the recipe. This was quick, easy and delicous!!

Recipe was easy to follow - and it came out fairly good, however, it lacked any real good flavor, all you could taste was salt. I did add some red wine and that boosted the flavor a little. I will probaly try another recipe next time.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Never was a big stroganoff fan, until I made this one for my wife, who is.  Will definitely add this one to the rotation.

I used a packet of onion soup mix in place of the chopped onion, otherwise I didn't change anything. Absolutely fantastic, and a great amount if you are cooking for two.

This was yummy and made the house smell great while simmering throughout the day. There are some good suggestions, use beef broth instead of water and  substitute the onion with a packet of onion soup mix - but don't do both, the result will be a bit salty, choose one or the other and you can't go wrong. I also added some mushrooms and served over egg noodles - Delish!

Every stroganoff recipe I tried was terrible so I never bothered to look for another..  But since my husband bought me a slow cooker, I searched for slow cooker recipes...came across this one & decided to try it, thanks to all the reviews--  Without them I would've just passed this one by.  GREAT TASTE & VERY EASY.  Husband loved it!! THANKS!

I scaled this recipe for 24 for a family party.  I cooked it in a roaster pan in the oven at 275 for 4 hours.  It was delicious and had many compliments. It was very simple and easy to make for a large group. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good.  I read the other reviews and added a packet of onion soup mix.  Also about 1 hour before serving I added a can of mushrooms.  I don't feel like it made very much, the recipe says it serves 4, but it was just me and my boyfriend. I always like to make enough to have leftovers, I will definitely make this again, doubling the recipe.

My husband and I LOVED this one! I did add fresh mushrooms, and at the end I had to thicken with some cornstarch. The kids weren't sure about the looks of it, but once they gave it a chance they ate it up!

I would have enjoyed the addition of sliced mushrooms in this; couldn't give it 5 stars for cosmetic reasons. Little white flecks of cream cheese just wouldn't go away and looked a little strange.

I seasoned the beef a bit (with pepper and adobo) before adding it to the crock. I also added some pepper to the gravy. The sauce was nice, but the beef was very dry. I think the cooking time was way too long for only 1 lb of beef.

It smelled good all day as it was cooking, but after I added the cream cheese at the end, I wasn't as excited about it. A little too creamy and rich. Next time I'll either add cream cheese to taste or try adding corn starch to thicken it without changing the taste.

This recipe was great. It takes alot for me to give a five star rating. (everyone in my home has to like it with no complants.)This recipe gets a five star rating from me. I doubled the recipe and did not have enough for everyone. (shock never happens) Thank you for such a great recipe. This will be made all the time.

Jessica this is the best stroganoff ever!  I usually make the Good Housekeeping recipe on the stove-top.  This is by far easier and tastes a lot better!  I did add a can of chopped mushrooms to it and as other reviewers stated, used sour cream instead of the cream cheese.  Thanks again for the great recipe!

Oh my goodness!  This tasted great!  I didn't have any Worcestire, and I added mushrooms for more substance.  I like a creamy texture, so I added 3oz fat free cream cheese and 3oz regular cream cheese.  I served it over whole wheat egg noodles, and I have to say that it was wonderful having this to come home to.

This was really good and simple, the only thing is that it doesn't make as much as the recipe states! i doubled the recipe and it still only fed my husband and i and my 2 small children with only a small amount left over,(about one more serving.) Next time i will probably triple the recipe because we like to have left overs:)

I just don't like stroganoff. I never liked it as a child and decided to try it- I eat alot of things now that I wounldn't when I was young. I still don't like it. The rest of the household does- they inhaled it.

YUMMY!!!!!!!!! The only thing I changed was I put in 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of pepper, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic, and 2 small cans of mushrooms. The meat was very tender. It was delicious! I will definitely  make this again

This was good, especially considering what little time it took to prepare.  I added about two teaspoons of minced garlic, and sprinkled in some garlic salt, garlic powder and paprika.  I also used sour cream instead of cream cheese.  If I make it again, I'd use the cream cheese and add some extra salt, pepper and other seasonings.  Then, I'd consider giving it a five star rating.

I just made this tonight. My husband licked his plate, so I decided that meant he would give it five stars. I added fresh mushrooms instead of canned (eww!) and some pepper. I normally shy away from anything with a canned soup. And the cream cheese sounded weird to me. But it was good! Yummy over toast too, the way my mom used to serve it. A good keeper :)

This was awesome!  The flavor was great and it was "oh so easy" to make.  I served over red mashed potatoes w/roasted garlic, sour cream and butter.  In my slow cooker, this recipe was ready in 6 hours low temp.

Oh my goodness! My husband (who once lived in Germany and traveled Europe) has been begging me to make beef stroganoff. Since I didn't have a recipe, I searched for one here. I decided to try this one since it seemed simple. The only thing I did different was I added mushrooms. (DH said he's never had stroganoff without them.) He took one bite and was completely delighted! He said it tasted just as he remembered. And I fell in love with it with the very first bite! We both give it 5 stars (and would give it more if we could!) and agreed that it's going on our regular rotation. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe! :o)

Excellent!  I made this yesterday, tripled the amount of cubes and soup, serving it over hot, cooked egg noodles -it was a hit with the entire family!  Thank you - it's a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this website.  My family raves when I make this for dinner! I also took Jillybean's advise, like so many others have.  This is one truly awesome dinner I'll make for years to come!

I just made this recipe tonight.  It was so yummy!!  Only changes I did was add some soy sauce and some minced garlic. Oh and I didn't have golden mushroom soup so I just used cream of mushroom soup, it worked fine though. I had to restrain myself from eating seconds.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is an excellent recipe!  I doubled it, substituted beef broth for the water, and added some fresh mushrooms near the end of the cooking time.  A definite "make again" at our house!

Don't change a thing. This is a great easy recipe that tastes perfect. Wonderful to walk in the door and smell how delicious this is. I have used golden mushroom soup (as called for in the recipe) and regular cream of mushroom. Stick with the recipe, it's the best.

I made this last week & it tasted fabulous.  I doubled the meat & the soup, added a tablespoon or so of sour cream, some pepper to taste, I followed the rest of the recipe. This is a favorite!  thanks!

This was excellent.  Instead of beef, I used Alaskan Caribou.  I followed all the recommendations submitted by others and it was amazing.  Instead of reading through all the reviews, just sort the reviews by most helpful.  Enjoy! This is a keeper.

This was fantastic!!! Beyond fantastic! I actually found myself getting the last bits out of the crockpot with my finger! Did all of the changes per Jillybean14's review from 7/6 (thank you for taking the time!) Gave it acouple of hours on high for kicks- we like the meat falling apart. This may be the best thing we've tried off this site- and that's obviously saying a lot! Thanks again!

This was so easy and absolutely fantastic!!!!  Definitely follow the changes recommended in these reviews (extra can of soup, extra sauteed mushrooms, less cream cheese, add sour cream etc, etc.) Even my super-picky husband adored it.  Wonderful!

Although this recipe was very simple to make which in itself is worthy of 3 stars, I definitely prefer sour cream over cream cheese in stroganoff.  The taste to me seemed much too tangy for one of my favorite meals.

I think this is sooo good. I'm making it again tonight for my sister and her husband. I told her she has to try it because she thinks her ground beef version of stroganoff is good. I have made the ground beef stroganoff and it doesnt even compare to this. I also put onion soup mix in it and canned mushrooms in it at the end. Sooo goood!!!!

This was a huge hit in my house. I will definitely make this often. I followed other suggestions and added double the soup and water with the onion soup mix. I also only used about 3 oz cream cheese and a big dollop of sour cream at the end. Awesome recipe!

It's really easy and very tastey.  I added a little white wine to it and that seemed to brighten it up a little bit.  But otherwise I made it as stated.  Served it over egg noodles.  I didn't find the meat tough at all.  Just used plain old stewing beef.  Didn't brown it or anything.  Left everything in the slow cooker for about 6 hours. Beef was nice and tender!

This was a great recipe.  I followed the suggestions from below and it turned out great...even better the next day!  I sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter and garlic and added on the top which went well with the sauce.  I didn't use any sour cream, very rich on its own!  Will definately make again!  My 2 picky boys (7 & 4 yrs) even went..mmmmmmm!

Wow, this was FANTASTIC! It was also one of the easiest recipes one could hope for--just dump in a few ingredients and come back several hours later. :) This is sure to become a favorite in our household. I did double the amount of Worcestershire sauce, but that's only because I can never get enough Worcestershire! Thanks for the outstanding recipe, Jessica.

This wasn't as sour as I would have liked, and it was much too soupy. Everyone in the family commented that it needed much more flavor.  I'll try it again, tweaking the seasonings and monitoring the liquid more carefully.

EXCELLENT!  I substituted 1/2 can of beef broth instead of the water; omitted the worchester sauce; added a jar of sliced mushrooms, and 2 Tablespoons of ground black pepper.  Then  thickened with 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch before adding 2 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of sour cream.  Served over hot extra wide egg noodles.  It was fabulous.  My picky family LOVED it!

So incredibly easy!  The hubby and kids loved it!  This one will be a staple meal!  If you're on the fence about trying this one out (I was), JUST DO IT!  You will NOT be sorry.

WONDERFUL RECIPE!  THE CREAM CHEESE WAS AN EXCELLENT TOUCH.  MUCH RICHER THAN SOUR CREAM.  FAMILY REALLY LIKED IT.  SERVED OVER EGG NOODLES WITH MASHED POTATOES AND MIXED VEGGIES!

Great recipe!  Nice for a busy week night.  Even my 3 year old ate it and sometimes that's a feat in itself.  I used beef broth instead of water and added some garlic for a little extra flavor.

This is yummy.  No, it's not dinner party fare, but it's perfect for a good family meal.  My Mom has dentures and needs soft, chewable meat, and this is it!  My picky husband eats seconds.  I could just binge on the gravy.  A few thoughts.  I found the original recipe a bit thin, so I doubled the meat and thickened it a bit.  I recommend thickening with corn starch rather than flour, because flour dims the sharp flavor.  I also served it over mashed potatoes the second time and my husband liked it better than with noodles.  Mmmm.  I'll serve this again, and soon.

This is a lick-the-plate-clean sort of dish, that's for sure!  I doubled everything, with no ill effects, because I have a bigger crockpot.  Leftovers actually freeze well, too!

My husband LOVED this, as Stroganoff is one of his all time favorite dishes.  This is BY FAR the easiest recipe I have ever used to make it for him.  I browned the meat and onions first, and I think I used more cream cheese (reduced fat) than the recipe called for, but otherwise I stuck with the VERY SIMPLE ingredient list and directions.  No doubt the other variations from the other reviewers would be equally good, perhaps even better!  I will definitely make this again, and try some of the other variations.

My family loves this recipe!  The only changes I have made is to add 1/4 cup white wine (red would work too) and substitute chive & onion flavored cream cheese for the plain cream cheese.  I also add some fresh ground sea salt & pepper to the pot as well.  Thanks Jessica!

Husband doesn't like stroganoff, but loved it and had it for lunch today.  I doubled the recipe as I always do anytime there is a sauce involved and also added one full pack of onion soup mix, used the whole 16oz. of cream cheese and put in fresh mushrooms the last 1/2 hr. and it turned out fabulous.  Will make this next time I'm craving stroganoff!

Thank you Jessica for this recipe and thank you to the other reviewers as well. I too added a package of onion soup mix and used boullion instead of water (1/2 cup).  In addition, I sauteed a package of sliced mushrooms with the onion and browned the beef after seasoning with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  6.5 hours was fine in a 4.5 quart slow cooker. A nice Sunday meal and one of the first I really liked from the slow cooker.

My 11 yr. old son mastered this one to a five star level. He subbed the soup for the crm. of mushroom, added a  sm. can of sliced mushrooms, and added a splash of reg. soya sauce for added color and rich flavour. He forgot the sour cream at the end.....lol....but nobody noticed. Super Easy and Delicous.......

This was good, but not as fantastic as I would have thought by the other reviews. I, too, agree that with the cream cheese, the dish is missing that "stroganoff" feel to it. Also, it was very thin to me so I will probably try to thicken it with corn starch next time. I did, however, gave it "4 stars" because my fiancee' specifically asked for it in his lunch the next day. All-in-all, very easy slow-cooker recipe for busy nights.

This was very easy to prepare.  Also my very picky 15 year old said this was the best stroganoff he every had and to quit making the others.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The only thing I would change is the cooking time. By the time it was 5-6 hours, the stroganoff was ready.

Wonderful recipe! Very easy to put together, and delightful to the taste buds. I sauteed mushrooms in some butter and added at the end. The cream cheese was a nice change. My husband couldn't stop raving about it. Thanks Jessica, will definately be a regular at our house.

Just made it and it turned out great! Doubled the recipe and also used Cream of Mushroom w/ a packet of French Onion soup/dip mix as others have. The only thing I am going to change next time is to use less Cream Cheese. By doubling the recipe it called for 1/2 pound. Was a bit too cheesy and heavy. Meat was tender, taste was great. 
  A definite keeper!

I have made this many times and am just now getting around to review it.  The only thing I do differently is add mushrooms and beef broth instead of water.  I think using golden mushroom soup makes a difference. Great slow cooker recipe!

This is the best beef stroganoff I've ever had!  Cooking the beef cubes in the slow cooker makes the meat incredibly tender.  I served it over hearty egg noodles and served with crusty dinner rolls and green beans.

This was a great recipe and has just become a family favorite!!!  The prep time on this was 10 minutes max and then it's ready and has your house filled with a yummy aroma when you walk in the door from work!  You can't get any easier! I changed it just a bit though.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup (and added 2 cans of water instead of the 1/4 cup of water) instead of golden mushroom soup because I had it on hand, added 2 bouillon cubes, 1 pkg of Lipton onion soup mix in addition to the chopped onion and instead of cream cheese used 8oz of sour cream.  After it had cooked all day I boiled up egg noodles and stirred them in a few minutes before serving.  It was excellent and my family loved it.  Next time I will add fresh mushrooms for an extra kick.

This recipe was great with cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I will definatley make it this way from now.  The only variation I did was use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Excellent!!

I used two pounds of meat and two cans of soup. I also added 3/4 can of beef broth instead of water. I added a can of mushrooms and I added the cream cheese about 45 mins before serving and I kept stirring it to make it smooth. Got a major thumbs up from the hubby! Great recipe. We served it over egg noodles.

Delicious!  I was so excited to try this recipe after reading all the good reviews.  I also used red wine instead of water, added salt, pepper, and garlic, and doubled the liquids.  Next time I plan to double the whole recipe so I can freeze the extras.

I took some advice from previous notes. I added garlic, salt, and pepper. I also did half water, half red wine. The taste was really good. The only thing I will change next time is a different type of meat.

Okay, it's a winner - and so easy too.  At first I didn't think the sauce was thick enough, and the color was a bit dark.  After adding the cream cheese (I went with the "low fat" variety)the sauce thickened up to the correct consistancy and the color came out right too.  Needless to say, the cream cheese added to the flavor.  Served it over noodles, and it was great, we'll be making this one again.

Everyone loved this recipe. I took one reviewers advice and added garlic and instead of water used wine. I think the wine was the perfect choice, otherwise I don't think it would have a great flavor. Also with the cream cheese chunks, I sprayed a pot w/ Pam and melted the cream cheese in a small saucepan, it helped minimize. Will make again!!!

Very good!  Just make sure to use very good, trim stew meat.  Made the mistake of using some stew meat from Sam's Club, and it ruined the flavor.  Otherwise, a fantastic recipe.  I added 8-oz sliced fresh mushrooms and subsituted half of the cream cheese for sour cream.  Using chive and onion cream cheese made for wonderful added flavor!

My favorite recipe of all time!!  I've made this about 20 times now and every time it's turned out great.  Due to an MSG allergy in the family I've substituted Potato & Leek soup, added fresh mushrooms and/or red wine.  No matter what I do it's still one of my families favorites, served over egg noodles.

I did tweak this recipe per other suggestions in the review section. I used 3/4 cup red wine instead of water, four cloves of garlic, doubled the liquid, used extra onion, and season salt and pepper. It turned out wonderful! I also had the white chunks from the cream cheese at the end (I even softened the cream cheese first), but it certainly didn't affect the taste. Thank you for this outstanding recipe!

Easy and Delicious!  The second time I made it I used 1 can of onion soup instead of the dry soup mix.  It was a lot less salty.

This was pretty good.  I added two cloves minced garlic and used pre-cut round strips for stir-fry and it turned out very tender.  Couldn't have been easier.

This was very good & very easy to make.  I doubled the sauce since we have a large crockpot & used sirloin tips.  Also added one cube of beef boullion and a little garlic powder and red wine while cooking.  Will use again...thanks!

This really had a great flavor!!!  The ONLY problem I had with this recipie was the texture of the sauce.  It was a bit runny for me.    Next time I will add a bit of flour to thicken it up. I used 98% fat free soup and fat free cream cheese and it took nothing away from the flavor. My husband mentioned that next time we should marinade the meat before cooking for added flavor.  I served this over rotini noodels and the leftovers are just as good if not better.

I've made this several times now. It's one of my family's favorites and makes for great leftovers. I double the stew meat to 2 pounds, add a little more onion, and throw in a small can of mushrooms (drained). We like it over egg noodles or brown rice.

My family really liked this where there was not a bite left.  I did change a few things by adding half a cup of water and half a cup of beef broth.  Instead of onions I added a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.  The gravy for this was wonderful and it was delicious served with a rye bread.

The best my husband ever had!  I used round steak and browned the meat in flour, salt, and pepper before placing in the crock pot (this cut the cooking time down quite a bit though).  I substituted light onion and chive cream cheese, added an additional 1/2 cup of beef broth, and added lots of mushrooms.  Excellent recipe!

This meal came out OK - although I changed the recipe quite a bit - used sour cream, fresh onions, celery, potatoes and carrots....lots of salt and pepper - served over egg noodles...added flour to the gravy - still didn't seem thick enough....maybe it was me - I added some extra water as well - since I wanted to make sure that the veggies and meat were covered.  All in all - quick, easy and yummy!

I loved the sauce this recipe makes. I tried the cream cheese the 1st time but I never could get it to melt right so the 2nd time I made it I used sour cream. Very Good! Wish it could be made a little thicker but if you wanted to mix it all together like I do with the leftovers it works really good.

This was very easy to prepare and tasted Great! I cut up Round Steak - Used 1 can of goldem Mushroom soup and 1 can cream of mushroom (thats what I had) I added extra onion, mushrooms, pepper and 1 1/2 TBS Worcestershire.I also added 1/4 cup of Low sodium beef broth rather then water. About 15 minutes before serving I added 4 OZ softened cream cheese and a few tablespoons of sour cream. The meat was melt in your mouth tender and had great taste and texture. Thank you for sharing - Great recipe !

Great easy dish. Along with the cream cheese I added about a half pint of sour cream I had in the fridge and it came out very tasty. I will be using this one again.

Thought this recipe was easy and outstanding.  I browned the beef before adding and doubled the onions.  I followed others suggestions and added some pizazz to the flavor by using Burgandy wine in place of the water.  Only used 2 ounces of cream cheese and felt that was plenty.  Will definitely make this again!!

This recipe was excellent.  I can't believe there are reviews that say it lacks flavor!  The only adjustments I made were to add beef boullion to the water and I also added about 15 whole mushrooms.  Very easy and quick!  I sent the pot over to my mom's house and everyone loved it.  My 4 year old also can't get enough! Try it- you'll love it!
Thanks!

I did not like this recipe at all.  I made it using all of the suggestions, and my husband and I found it VERY "bland".  No real taste to it and it wasn't very flavorful.  I added cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden one, and I added sour cream as well as the cream cheese.  Will never make this again.

Very easy and even the picky eater ate her whole serving! Will try with Low Fat soup and Low Fat cream cheese next time, and see if it changes the taste. If not, this is going to be a regular for my family!

fast and no effort to throw together! Flavor melds all day. I used half wine, half water for the liquid. Also added to the recipe garlic salt, pepper, paprika on the meat and a good pinch of dill for an authentic flavor to the sauce. Cream cheese gave it a nice thick creaminess. Sour cream will be equally as tasty. I love "easy"...this is just that!!

Yum, Yum...Made exactly to recipe and it was wonderful.  The only change I think I will make next time is to use red wine in place of water.  This is so easy to prepare and would go great with pasta, potatoes or rice.

This recipe was GREAT. I doubled it and could have quadrupled it for my guys since they asked for seconds and thirds and wish I had made more. I used shallots instead of onions and skipped the Worschestershire sauce but this is definitely a do-over any day of the week. It was so comforting and so very easy in the slow cooker. Thanks Jessica.

This recipe is quick, simple, and delicious.  I really enjoy the flavor of the cream cheese instead of sour cream.  We have this pretty often.

Fabulous!  I make it all the time, and it was a big hit with the 20-somethings on a recent ski trip.  Threw the stuff in the crock in the morning, and had a great dinner waiting at the end of a day of skiing.
Great over rice or noodles, and I always add mushrooms and a bit of sherry.

ANOTHER KEEPER!   My husband enjoyed it and I definitely will prepare it again.  I passed it along to my friend and she added extra mushrooms, 1/4 cup of Merlot wine and one 16 oz. can of Del Monte Petit-Cut Jalepano Tomatoes.  She said it was an Absolute Hit for her family.

Delicious!!! Made the whole house smell great, and it tasted wonderful.  I used sour cream - but more because I'm cheap, and cream cheese is more expensive.  I did add some mushrooms and onion soup mix - but more b/c I really like mushrooms.

Excellent slow cooker recipe.  Doubled the recipe and added 2 large cans of drained mushrooms, some sherry and at the end added 8 oz cream cheese and about 1/2 c or so of sour cream.  Delish!  Had to add a little salt though but other than that a definate keeper.

Made a mistake at the store and bought red cooking wine instead of cooking sherry.  I used 1/4 cup of this instead of the water and substituted dry onion soup mix for the onion.  Also I used cream of mushroom soup and sour cream instead of golden mushroom soup and cream cheese.  I made the recipe for a potluck so I stirred the egg noodles in prior to serving.  This was incredibly easy and to my surprise actually tastes like stroganoff!  (5 hours on high is too long.  It was probably ready after 3 or 4 hours.)

This recipe taste great! I did make a few adjustments based on other reviews: I added 1/4 cup of cooking Sherry, Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Golden Mushroom, and I did not add Mushrooms. I also used Sour Cream at the end just because I am so use to the flavor but next time I will try the Cream Cheese. This is delicious and a definite keeper in my household. Thanks for sharing!!

The first time I made this, we left out the onion and used plain mushroom soup.  It was so good, we didn't have enough to satisfy all my family.  This time we are including the onion and using mushroom soup again and doubling the recipe.  I never have golden mushroom soup on hand, but it's great with plain.  I was really impressed how well this turned out.

What could be easier than a 6-ingredient recipe?  This was a snap to make and was delicious (especially when I substituted Sherry for the water, to get that "Stroganoff" taste).  Thanks Jessica!

incredible!  First thing I even made in my new slow cooker and it came out great.  I did substitute sour cream and added 2 tbs of flour to thicken it and a good deal of seasoned salt but the original recipe is great!!!  This will be a repeated dish!

Well, it's not every day that your boyfriend actually takes the time to says "Wow, this is REALLY good".  Four thumbs up for this one.  I did have to add a little water though, after adding the cream cheese....delicious though.

This certainly wasn't the prettiest dish I've ever made but it sure was tasty! I also used a packet of dry onion soup in place of the onion and 1/4 cup of red wine which brought out a beautiful flavor in the meat. Only thing I would change is adding more water/wine as the sauce was a bit too thick.

I will make this again and again.  I floured the beef cubes and browned them first.  I didn't have golden mushroom soup and used the regular mushroom soup and I used half sour cream and half cream cheese and also added a can of beef broth.  Everyone loved this recipe - even my daughter who HATES mushrooms.  She even had a second helping.  So easy to prepare.  I loved it.

I prepared this for my all-women Bunco group and increased the recipe to serve 12.  I bought very lean stew meat and added two small cans of mushrooms. It was very easy and I served with a choice of rice or egg noodles. The leftovers were even better several days later.  Received rave reviews.

This is the best Beef Stroganoff my husband & i both have ever had. It's very easy to put together before work then have it ready to eat when we get home. Our favorite is over rice.

Being someone who hates to cook but loves to slow cook, this recipe was wonderful! I put the ingredients together the night before and by morning my home had the wonderful smell of an excellent dish. I have shared this recipe with co-workers who give it a "thumbs-up." I have substituted chicken and it was just as good.

Delicious.  My husband says he wants to add this to our "favorite meals".  Using the slow cooker is always convenient...just come home from work and it's ready.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe. I floured the beef and browned it first which helped thicken the gravy. Next time I think I will just add a little flour at the end for thickening and not bother with browning. The family really liked it. Also, per reviewer's advice added a little wine, mushrooms and 3 oz of cream cheese. Carol R

This is a great recipe and so easy to make!  I've made it several times, following the instructions to the letter, and it has always been a big hit with my family.  Most recently, I took advice from another reviewer and used Marsala wine instead of water....what a great flavor!  I also add 1/2 a jar of capers, for a little extra zing.  LOVE this recipe, and will continue making it for years to come.

All I've gotta say is that my 18 month old LOVED it!  He gobbled every bite and wanted seconds.  We've been experimenting in the kitchen lately to find kid friendly crockpot recipes, and this one is the best I've made!  Oh yeah, the adults in the house also loved it.  Only substitution was for light cream cheese and 8 oz package of presliced mushrooms.  We served it on a cauliflower-potatoe puree.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

The sauce was great, but the meat was extremely chewy and not good at all.  I'll definitely try this again with a different grade of beef.

This was so "homey" and delicious.  I added a can of sliced mushrooms (with juice) also, and served it over mashed potatoes.  Wonderful and SO easy.

The condensed soup was the perfect base for this dish! I added mushroom to the recipe this time and would also like to try white wine in place of the water next time.

I must of a warped sense of what beef stroganoff taste like because it was just edible. I figure that it must of been the blood that was given off by the beef into the mushroom soup gravy during cooking. Otherwise easy and quicky to make.

Very quick and easy to bring together and had good flavor. I do wish I had read the reviews first, but had to get it going. I would definitely have added some bullion. I love slow cooker recipes, this for sure will go into my rotation.

I MADE THIS EXACTLY AS WRITTEN.... IT'S GROSS! Not one member of my family of 5 finished their serving. First off, the Worcestershire is overbearing, and the cream cheese makes it even worse. This recipe does not deserve 5 stars by any means, and if you're going to modify a recipe, you have no business reviewing it in the first place.

I substituted a red wine vinegar for the Worchester sauce, the cream cheese was a good tip and so I split the cream cheese and sour cream.  I also used minced garlic and minced onion [converted]. One more, corn starch is much better than flour.  My mom taught me that one.  I served it over wide buttered noodles and a salad.  My picky grandchildren who are never appreciative thought it was "OK" but I noticed they took seconds.

Turned out amazing! The flavor is awesome and super easy. I add a buttload of pepper, a little garlic powder and serve with rice. I've made it several times. We get about two generous portions out of it , so I'm doubling the recipe tonight for lunch tomorrow.

So quick to throw together with a delicious result. I toss in a can of mushrooms at the end with the cream cheese. I'll also use beef broth instead of water if I happen to have some opened in the fridge. We like it served
 over hot noodles...yum!

My college sons love this! At the end of breaks, I made a double batch and pack them up the beef stroganoff with noodles. This never goes to waste! One is a very fussy eater and he loves it. This dish is also super easy to make. Regular rotation is an understatement :)

I made some changes based on personal preferences and some of the recommended changes in the reviews.  First off, is used a sirloin steak (it was on sale), aded pepper and some garlic powder, used sour cream instead of cream cheese,  used 1/2 cup of beef broth (we like extra sauce) and mixed 1 Tbs. corn starch with 2 Tbs. water and used that to thicken the sauce just before adding the sour cream.  Results: delicious -hubby said I could make that again anytime.  Might saute some extra mushrooms to add next time.

This was ok.  I would definitely make some changes.  There wasn't enough salt so def add salt.  I served this over a bag of  egg noodles and there was not enough sauce or meat.

My husband actually made this delicious stroganoff, but with a few changes with the ingredients. Instead of using beef stew meat, he used venison. Instead of using golden mushroom soup, he used cream of mushroom soup, plus he added 2 (6-5 ounce) cans of mushrooms (pieces & stems), drained well. Cooked it on LOW for 8 hours in the Crock Pot, and just when it's close to serving, my husband will turn the Crock Pot on the HIGH setting to be sure the stroganoff is hot.

I make this recipe with a couple of additions.  It's ready in 5-6 hrs.
 I make it with ground meat because my kids prefer it.  
2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.
1 clove of garlic.
1/2 cup of water, instead of 1/4.
This is such a yummy recipe!!

I doubled the recipe, added mushrooms, salt, and pepper and cooked it in my Instant Pot for 45min!! Oh and then added sour cream and “sauté” for about 5min and done!! This is our go-to dinner and even my picky hubby likes this a lot! Instead of egg noodles, we serve it over white rice.

I think it needs a little more zing... so maybe more   Worcestershire Sauce... but aside from that.... easy and tasty!

I've made this before my recipe  very similar.
However I followed her  EXACT recipe (doubled the stew meat )
it came out delish.
Even better the leftovers 2nd night.
Thank you for sharing recipe

Good recipe! When I cook egg noodles and I drain the water, I'll add about a teaspoon of butter to the hot noodles and gently stir. It gives the noodles a creamier taste.

This was a hit. Will definitely be making this again. Used low sodium cream of mushroom, chopped the onions fine, and cooked a couple hours less on low.  Meat was very tender at about 6 hours. You do not need to make the many changes others are recommending. This is a very delicious recipe.

This was absolutely wonderful using JillyBean14's suggestions.  I did switch out the suggestion for bouillon cubes with Better Than Bouillon as it has less salt in it.  You are getting enough salt from the golden mushroom soup and onion soup mix you really don't need more.  You can also leave out the suggestion of adding more salt.  It just depends on how much salt you like.  Definitely add pepper though.  Next time, I plan sear/brown the meat, but not cooking it all the way before adding to the slow cooker for more flavor and to reduce cooking time.  We like the meat to be falling apart which requires a longer cooking time so searing the meat will reduce it.  We didn't use any sour cream as we thought it was amazing without it.  Maybe next time, one of us will add a bit to their plate just to see. I love the extra sauce too.  We will definitely be making this again.

As many other reviews state, modification to this  recipe is necessary. I agree with adding a 1/2 packet of onion soup mix. I  added one portobello mushroom cap, sliced in thick chunks. I peppered the meat before it went in. I added another pack of variety mushrooms when there was 30 minutes cook time left. I think 2 cans of soup are necessary. In my cylinder crock pot, the liquid in the recipe barely covered the 1 lb of meat and onions. Perhaps a low sodium beef stock would also work to have enough liquid. Make sure you temper the sour cream or cream cheese. You cannot add cold cream to the hot dish. The premise of a good recipe is the ingredient list- the enhancements make a meal you would want to have again.

I used beef broth instead of water as another review recommended and it was too salty (I didn’t add extra salt). I didn’t love the stew meat but if I make it again I will have use water or low sodium broth and either hamburger or chuck roast.

Easy recipe that tastes great. Adding corn starch to thicken is recommended, as is pepper. I’ll mix in a little hot sauce next time for added flavor.

My family loved this recipe.  The cream cheese just brings out the best flavors and it reheats up really well too.  The meat was so tender after being slow cooked it melted in our mouths.

If you like mushrooms, you could add more mushrooms to the recipe.

Don't change a thing unless you double the recipe which we do around here for 2 teenagers and a hungry dad.  Sometimes Dad requests extra mushrooms, but it's fine with just the soup mushrooms too. We make it at least 2x a month. Winner!

Definitely a keeper! I browned the meat with onions and garlic. Added a tsp. of beef buillion, used 1 full soup can of water, and left out the dairy.  It was delicious. We didn't have any leftovers, so next time I will more than likely double the recipe.

I've made this recipe SEVERAL times, though I use cream of chicken soup because my family doesn't like mushrooms, and my family LOVES LOVES LOVES it! This is my definite go to for a one pot meal (two if you count the pot for the noodles :) ).

Delish.  Made as is but cooked much less time.  1 hour high and 5 hours low.

As others have commented I doubled the soup, I also lightly sautéed mushrooms a the onion was finishing, and added 1/2 envelope of dry onion soup mix. Last, I cooked the ingredients in my instant pot on high pressure for 15 minutes, then stirred in a package of egg noodles and cooked for another 5 minutes. The instant pot is entirely empty, two kids cleaned every bit of their plates!

I also modified this by using 2 cans of soup 1/4 cup beef broth salt and pepper, mushrooms. However it tasted VERY salty. I would skip the salt next time and look for reduced sodium soup/broth.  Overall I was pleased as was my family.

Like others I doubled the sauce but left the cream cheese at 4 oz. My family devoured this! (I did add mushrooms and then sour cream to individual servings.) So tasty and will put this in my regular rotation.

I substituted grated parmesan for 1/4 cup of powered parmesan,
I diced my zucchini instead of grating it; and
I added 1 tsp of garlic salt.
The patties turned out very tasty with a lightly crunchy crust.

This came out incredible. I used golden mushroom instead of cream of mushroom. I used organic ground beef because that reminds me of the hamburger helper kind, I will definitely try beef tips next time. Also added Sriracha to give it a kick and organic coconut flour to help with the thickness. It was yummy.

I find the stew meat almost a bit dry and the cream cheese doesn't melt smoothly in the slow cooker leaving unappealing little white dots in the sauce. Think I prefer my mom's old recipe.

Not good as written. Over cooked and not a good sauce. There are many recommendations in the reviews here that turn this into a very good recipe but that should not give this recipe a good rating.

made the revised recipe after reading the comments. only thing I changed was I didn't  have onion soup mix so replaced the 1/4 cup of water with French onion soup.  cooked fresh mushrooms the night before. just before serving added the mushrooms, sour cream, and cream cheese. I was worried about the cream cheese being too sweet, but it was great. this is the first recipe I have made from here that my husband thought was great. we both cleaned the bowls with our bread and the leftovers are going to be supper tomorrow night. so glad I took the chance and made this and I will definitely make again.

Very easy and my family loved it! I used 1 1/2 blocks of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream. Served over egg noodles. There was a lot of it so plenty left over for the next day. Didn’t last past that because they gobbled it down.

I had to add a lot to the recipe.  I added more cream cheese, another can of the golden mushroom soup, two more cups of water, a squeeze of sour cream, and more pepper.  I think thats about it.  The original recipe had the right idea, but their would not be enough sauce to cover the noodles.  With the additions, the beef stroganoff was amazing.

The Cream Cheese is a great addition, but I also but about a cup of sour cream with it.  Was very creamy and with super flavor.

It was good over egg noodles however I wasn't thrilled about it. It may have been I wasn't in the mood for dish. After reading through the reviews it sound like it lacks some seasoning. I usually add mushrooms to this dish.

I made this pretty much as described, and it was fantastic.  I added an extra 1/4c water and used "regular" cream of mushroom soup.  It was delicious and I would make again in a heartbeat!

Have made this numerous times, and it always turns out. I recommend using the suggestions from Jillybean14 (usually at the top of the reviews) - great additions to the main recipe. This dish is loved by even the pickiest eaters in our home, never any leftovers.

The beef stroganoff cooked for seven hours and had excellent flavor.  However, I used the cream cheese and there were white lumps in the gravy. I put the cooker on high to help stir in the cream cheese, but it did not make a difference.
Next time, I will use the sour cream which will dissolve easiliy.

I used all of "Jillybean14's" recommendations, which were almost perfect.  To make it perfect, I need a lot of dried dill weed sprinkled in at the end.  That gives it a perfect finish, and reminds me of how my mom used to make it.  I hope some of you will try it with the dill weed...and don't be bashful in how much you add.  Love this recipe with Jillybean14's additions and mine; a keeper.

I doubled the recipe, because I don't want to spend 8 hours in a slow cooker for only a few servings!  Made as noted, using cream cheese, but had to turn it to warm after 6 hour.  The meat was cooked, but we weren't ready to eat.  It was tender, there was plenty of 'juice', and egg noodles the way to go.  Husband doesn't step out of the box much (and this is for him!), and he loved it.  Even mentioned it again this morning.

This is a great base recipe. Sure, there’s tweaks I do for our family’s taste, but it has provided a meal that everyone likes and looks forward to. I always double the sauce so there’s plenty of leftovers. I have found that 5-6 hours on low is the sweet spot for cooking time in my crockpot.

This was pretty good... easy to make. I did add extra worcestershire, salt, pepper and used sour cream. The store didn't have the golden mushroom soup, so I had to use regular. If I were to make it again, I think I'd add some fresh mushrooms. Served it over egg noodles.

This was delicious. I sauteed the meat is olive oil & garlic first.  I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  I added 8oz of cream cheese instead of 4oz. had enough for leftovers.

This is repeatable.  Made it just like the recipe calls for it (although I used the golden mushroom soup).  Served it over egg noodles and my very picky family ate it!  All of them!  That is a compliment as I usually get at least one kid that won't eat whatever I cook.  Therefore, this is repeatable which ranks a solid "4 stars".  (A 5 star recipe is one where everyone licks their plates! - or at least their fingers :))

This recipe was wonderful and my husband and I really enjoyed it!  Best beef stroganoff recipe ever.
I made a few changes but pretty much followed to a "T".
Following revisions:
Used 2 lb chuck roast cut up into cubes.  
I thickened the gravy, at the end of cook time before adding sour cream,  with one T of cornstarch mixed with two T of water by recommendation of another reviewer.
I also used sour cream instead of cream cheese, 1/4 C.
Next time, I would like to add fresh mushrooms for more depth and texture.
You have to try this at least once!  This is truly amazing.  Thank you, Jessica!

Couldn't bring myself to use the cream cheese so went with sour cream. My other stroganoff recipe calls for lots of mushrooms and white wine. this was good for a crock pot option.

I loved this recipe... I was a bit weary with the ingredients, but my whole family loved it... (Children 10, 10, & 7). I used wide egg noodles, extra fluffy,  and white rice.  The kids mixed it all together. Thank you for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except added salt--the taste was delicious, but I think my cuts of beef were bad or my crockpot overcooked them because they were just dry and tough. We ended up shredding up as much of the beef as we could removing the rest and enjoying the delicious sauce and noodles.

It was great.  I used some  wild game steaks ( which I browned before adding to the crock pot) and i used about 1/2 cup red wine instead of 1/4 cup water. I added a can of sliced organic mushrooms with the creamed cheese and served over wide egg noodles. 

I probably didn't have as much meat so it cooked in half the time on low. 

The recipe was excellent

Very Simple.  I doubled the recipe so used one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. 
The meat, this time, (i've used the recipe at least 4 times) was a roast that ended up being too tough for us to eat.

This was pretty easy, but turned out a little bland.  The part that definitely didn't work was the cream cheese....it did not completely melt.  Plus I miss that tang that comes from sour cream.  So next time.......a little more seasoning and sour cream!

As is, this recipe is bland, tasteless, and disgusting. The meat cooked for so long it shredded itself once the cream cheese was mixed in. I rarely skip reading reviews first, and sorely regret not reading them this time around. No one in my family is happy with this disappointing experience. I can't imagine canned dog food being worse.

Very good beefy gravy dish and easy to make. Four stars because it was tasty and hubby liked it. But didn't have the stroganoff flavor I love.  Might try sour cream instead of cream cheese next time. Also, doubled sauce was too much.  Think the recipe was right on there.

Honestly, my entire family didn't like this at all.  We ate enough to be full and I threw the rest away.  We like Stroganoff III better.

I made this with pork instead of beef and was just as good. Alot less fat to deal with. I just added beef boulion to flavor.

Ok, a lot of blended recipes here.  Just from my experience, I doubled the meat, added the mushrooms, bullion, blah blah blah.. it was cooking up awesome... I mean really nice.  Just before serving I added the cream cheese (low fat) and sour cream (low fat) and my recipe dropped about 4 notches... Seasoned well + the golden mushroom soup, meat selection, this was going to be good... I will make again soon.. sans the creamy stuff.... yuck!

My fave!  Been a winter staple in our house for a few years now. I don't like to change recipes others have provided so I will say I made it exactly as written. I added the noodles directly into the crockpot for about 15 mins and everything was ready to serve. Yummy!

CAN BE ALTERED WITH CHICKEN TOO!  Here are some changes we made:

4 chicken breasts (I place them in frozen)
1 10.75oz can golden mushroom soup
1 can cream celery soup
2 tbs Worcestershire sauce
1 tbs yellow mustard
1-2 tbs sherry cooking wine
1/2 cup chicken or veg broth
1/2 lb cream cheese

Add all ingredients except the cream cheese (add this about 30 min before serving)  Cook low 8hrs and about 10 if starting from frozen.  I also switch to high once i add the cream cheese and i shred the chicken using 2 forks before adding cream cheese. enjoy!

Made this for my wife and 2 other couples - all three of the ladies being much more experienced cooks than me, so I was a little worried.  Everybody LOVED it!  Two guests even went back for 3rds!  Sorry Pheobe, but I like reading the reviews to see how people have made recipes their own.  I took the advice of many reviewers and made changes as I went.  I've  never been a big fan of stewing beef, but I bought two packs and cut about 1/3 of it away, leaving only the good parts and marinated it overnight so the flavours had lots of time to meld.  Added the cream cheese, sour cream and sauteed onions/mushrooms 45 minutes before it was done cooking.  The sauce was thick and tasty and the meat was the most tender I'd eaten in a long time after the 6 and 1/2 hours in the slow cooker, on low.  The guests want it again next week!  LOL

This is the best crock pot meal I have ever made! I made it for Christmas dinner and served with French bread. I doubled the recipe, marinated the meat overnight with salt, pepper, garlic and Worcestershire sauce, Lipton onion soup mix, 2 beef bullion cubes, water and soup. Did the 4 ounces cream cheese and 2 serving spoonfuls of sour cream. Very full of flavor. I'm been making recipes from all recipe for a long time and have never been disappointed but this is the first recipe I'm willing to take the time to rate and review! Served it with egg noodles and sauted mushrooms and onions.

This recipe is both very simple to make and exceptionally good tasting.

I cooked this 5 hours on high and it came out perfectly.

Easy to make and very good. I cut up sirloin tip steaks for my meat and used fat free cream cheese. It was ready in under 4 hours by cooking on high.

This was easy and very good. Definitely a keeper. The only change I made was add a tsp of cayenne pepper. My family like a little spice in their meals.

Unfortunately I need to agree with some of the more critical of reviewers. You really DO have to modify this recipe to max out it's potential. It was a hit with the boyfriends two children (9 year old and 14 year old boy). Here's the mods: 
I had two medium packages  of stewing beef (3-4 pnds). I dredged the beef in flour and browned it on the outside. 
I kept the onion (used sweet onion and sauteed it before putting in slow-cooker) and added fresh sauteed garlic.
I did not add water - but put the mushroom soup, onion and cream cheese in the crock pot, cooking on low for the entire workday. 
When I came home I tasted the copious broth and added some Dijon mustard. I too served over egg noodles. Fantastic!

This was fabulous, really thickened up after adding the cream cheese at the end. We like mushrooms so instead of the water I added a can of mushrooms without draining. My 10 year old son had thirds!

Love this recipe. It's very easy and comes out great. I use beef broth instead of water and add an onion soup mix.

Could this be any easier?!? Great comfort food! I threw in some fresh mushrooms, some extra spices, and used Heavy Cream. Everyone cleaned their plates. This will be a recipe we go back to! Thanks!

Absolutely loved this recipe however I did read the reviews and made changes accordingly.  I doubled the sauce except the cream cheese and the Worcestershire sauce.  I added a full onion, garlic, pepper and instead of the water used beef stock instead (double the amount it calls for).  30 minutes prior to it being done, I sautéed fresh sliced mushrooms with butter, pepper, a touch of herb de Provence and sherry for about 5 minutes over medium heat then added to the slow cooker mixing thoroughly.  Cooked extra wide egg noodles according to directions on package, adding butter when done and drained.  While noodles are cooking, added 4-5 ounces cream cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  My husband raved about this!! And he is a phenomenal cook himself so I'm always nervous doing something for him because he is MacGyver in the kitchen. Only thing I would do differently next time is double the meat!

Easy and delicious! I found it only took 3-4 hours on high. I just seasoned to taste and served over egg noodles. Wonderful recipe!

Meat was nice and tender! I did a some spices, garlic powder, salt, pepper, etc. I also had some sour cream in the fridge so I threw that in too, made it really creamy with just a touch of tangyness.

I will definitely be making this again!  So Easy, So Good!  I served over Spatzle...  even my picky husband loved it just as the recipe is.  I'll make this easy version, not get caught up in adding a bunch of things (I don't have the time), it's as good as it gets with minimal fuss!

It came out really tasty!  The only changes I made was that I made my own Golden Mushroom soup (did a search online) since I had none in the house and I didn't feel like going to the store to buy something with a bunch of preservatives and sodium in it.  Rather than adding the onions later I put them in my soup with fresh mushrooms.  I didn't add any extra salt since the Worcestershire sauce is salty (it has anchovies in it).  Also I seared the beef before adding to the crock pot since I prefer to do that.  I cooked on high for 4 hours and it was on warm for another hour.  It was the best I've ever had, the meat was super tender but not mealy and I'll make it again, with my own mushroom soup of course.

I made this last night for a large family...tripled the recipe. Followed it exactly.... for all the people changing it and adding....just stop. It was really good. It's not my recipe that I normally use which is totally from scratch, but takes a long long time to prepare... but this is perfect for a quick throw together recipe!

I made it exactly as the recipe was written. It was great! After the first couple of times doing it that way, I did add about 2 T sour cream. It adds a bit of tangyness... just enough. That's how I've made it ever since.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this and loved it.  And yes, I made changes.  Like JILLYBEAN14, I personalized it.  I added some granulated garlic,   a big dolop of sour cream and extra black pepper.  Since I love mushrooms, I sliced and sauteed 8 oz of baby portabellas in some red wine and butter and added them during the final 30 minutes.  It was excellent.

I made this last night to cook overnight as we are having a real hot spell right now. It was a bit salty but with the noodles it was good. I like sour cream so I added that. Will someone explain to me why it is necessary to write really rude things about recipes? The 'alleged' most helpful review is simply a nasty rant by someone who didn't like the recipe. Didn't like it shut up and let someone try it without your 'helpful' comments. Personally I don't bother reading the comments usually as they are either really good or really bad.

I made this with cream of mushroom soup as I have used the one suggested in the past and I was not fussy about.....otherwise the ingredients were the same.  I enjoyed the flavour of the dish and how simple it was to prepare.  It will be my go-to Beef Stroganoff dish though as I get braver, there are apt to be modifications

I made this the first time as its listed here, and my rating is based on that. Great base for a recipe, however lacks a bit of flavor. What I've done is I do not add the water (I've found most recipes here that call for adding water usually don't need it), add a cube of beef broth, and a packet of french onion soup mix. The flavor comes out pretty good this way. I also add sliced mushrooms to mine in the last 3-4 hours.

Great recipe! Make sure to modify it like some reviewers said. Next time I will add sour cream instead of cream cheese. Yummy

Delicious! I followed some reviews and made some slight changes. I used fresh sliced beef in strips for fajitas (just because it's all that was available at my grocery store), added the can of water with the soup (maybe that was implied?), half a packet of beefy onion soup mix, garlic salt and pepper. Cooked on low for 8 hours (work day). Added a spoonful of sour cream with the cream cheese. Served over egg noodles with green beans.

This dish was excellent!  It fit all my requirements - easy, tasty and quick to prepare.  I loved it even more with the cream cheese replacing the sour cream.  I highly recommend! I accidently added dry onion soup (which I'd do again) and mushrooms (just because we love them).

Loved it! I followed Jillybean14's directions (including doubling sauce but not cream cheese & Worcestershire). I had leftover ribeye, so I sautéed the onion & added mushroom in a stockpot, then the rest of the ingredients (plus a little extra water) & simmered about 20 minutes before adding in the cooked meat. Simmered a bit more, then added cream cheese & sour cream. Husband said he preferred more sour cream, so next time I may increase the sour cream & decrease the cream cheese.

I have made this quite a few times,  i did use some of the readers suggestions and tweaked it a bit.  I use regular mushroom soup and i think its still great.( I have an allergy to tomatoes and golden mushroom soup has tomato in it). 
i do find this recipe does better with only cooking it for 4-5 hours.

This recipe was so delicious, I will definitely make this again.  I revised the original recipe per some suggestions.  Here is how I made it: Used fresh mushrooms and put them in the bottom of the slow cooker as the first layer.  They came out wonderful.  I used tbone steak, trimmed and deboned.  Wow it was fantastic.  Added fresh garlic, sweet peppers,  salt and pepper.  I also doubled the soup and water.  Next time I will likely use 1.5 cans of soup and see how it comes out.  I cooked on high for 5 hours.  When adding the cream cheese, I also added a heaping table spoon of onion dip.  I didn't have sour cream on hand but had chip dip.  My guests were happy and I guess that is all you can ask!  Can't wait to eat the left overs tonight!

It was very good.  I only cooked it in the slow cooker for about 3 hours and it was just fine.  I used cubed chuck and it was  very tender.  I used light sour cream not cream cheese.  The only change I would make next time, is to add a  bouillon cube or a little onion soup mix, as this recipe is just slightly a little bland.  Needs a little "something" but still good.

Delicious!  My husband loves beef stroganoff, I am usually not a fan.  This was a recipe both of us loved and he said it was better than any he'd had at a restaurant.  The only change I made was to make the condensed golden mushroom soup myself, I don't ever buy the canned stuff any more.  I just sauteed some mushrooms and onions in a little butter, added in some flour & spices and then whisked in some beef stock and the Worcestershire sauce called for and poured it over the beef.  When it was almost ready to serve, I added in the cream cheese and a little bit of milk and then served it over egg noodles.  Even my kids liked it - this recipe is a keeper!  Goes great served with some buttered carrots on the side.  UPDATE:  I now substitute plain yogurt for the cream cheese and it is just as delicious only better for you.

Good.  This was easy to double and was a hit for family visiting from out of town.  I'm making it for the second time tonight.  Excited to have found gluten free egg noodles at the grocery store.

LOVED this recipe!!!!  I doubled it since I was cooking for 6 people.   The only things I changed were substituting beef stock for water, added 2 garlic cloves finely chopped.  I put it on top of buttered egg noodles and topped it with a dollop of sour cream for a bit of a tang.  AMAZING!!!!!  Had asparagus with hollandaise  sauce as the side to make the meal complete.  :-)

Super easy and tasty!  I made this once this winter and will make again tonight as our family has multiple activities and everyone is eating dinner at a different time.  I prefer sour cream to the cream cheese, and will use light sour cream to make it a bit healthier.

I followed JILLYBEAN's edits and the dish came out so salty, thick, and the meat was extremely tough. Will not make this again.

Followed JILLYBEAN 14's reviews and it was the best beef stroganoff I have ever had. My bf  loved it and packed his lunch immediately after dinner! :-)

After reading through the reviews, I decided to double the sauce as well. I did this by making the following changes: added a can of cream of onion soup in addition to the golden mushroom soup, added an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, used 1/2 cup of beef broth instead of water, added a few cloves of garlic, used 8 ounces of cream cheese, and added a spoonful of sour cream at the end. It was very good and I plan to make this again!

Used recommendations from another reviewer.  The meat was tender but the flavor was off.  Not like stroganoff at all.

AWESOME! I've made this twice now, once on low for 8 hrs and last time for 5 1/2 and it sat on warm for 4. If I could get home on time 6 would probably be perfect! Tasted great both times either way. Used 1 can golden mushroom, 1 can cream of mushroom with garlic. Used the Worcestershire, pepper and a packet of beef bullion to season. Cream cheese melted in it before serving and a hefty dollop of sour cream. Serve over egg noodles- voila! delicious

Followed the recipe but added beef bouillon to the water and added 3 cloves of garlic.  It was delicious. Some reviews stated that they added onion soup mix. I am glad that I did not add it as I think it would have made this  too salty.  It was perfect without it.

I've made this a bunch of times a always forget to review it. I agree with others that there is not enough liquid, I use a whole can of beef broth, no water, and in addition to a dash of sherry wine and a little garlic. I use a combo of sour cream and cream cheese, serve over egg noodles with green onions on top. This is a keeper for us!

This was a pretty good, pretty easy dish to make.  It was just a tad bit on the bland side, but still quite good.  I think it will definitely need to be salted to taste.  If I were to modify the recipe, I think there should be something along the lines of sour cream added in with the cream cheese.  That would give it the little needed boost of flavor, I think.

I didn't have a chance to read any reviews on this dish prior to making it; I simply went off the star rating. I made it exactly per the recipe, and it was "fine" at best. Confused by the rave reviews, I started reading through them, and was amazed that most reviewers gave this a five star rating after making 5-6 modifications to the original recipe. It IS an easy recipe to make, and the taste was fine as originally submitted. I'm still on the hunt for a great stroganoff recipe, though!

Fantastic dish. Though many of the reviewers changed the ingredients, I only added two things: half a packet of onion soup mix and sauteed mushrooms. The recipe came out perfectly, so I suggest you add these as well. The mushrooms add a nice consistency, and they're delicious anyway. Next time, I'm adding even more.

I couldn't find Golden Mushroom soup, so I used cream of mushroom. I used 2 cans, 1/2 onion soup mix, 3 t minced garlic, salt, pepper, and 1 T worcestershire sauce. I forgot the water - glad I did, because it was a little runny when it was done. I will make it again - all my little kids ate it up happily. But it's not a recipe to rave about.

I followed edited recipe and used pepper garlic powder and salt, 1/2 cup beef broth, 2 cans of soup, half packet onion dip mix, kept Worcestershire the same (also added almost a Tbs of ketchup) I didn't have an onion so I added some minced onion instead. Used about a pound and a half of stew meat. I added 4 oz of fresh mushrooms towards the end and the cream cheese I kept the same (added an hour before it was done cooking to blend) and also added at least as much sourcream at the end. This was... OK. Next time I think it needs a large can of mushrooms instead of fresh. Also I cooked it for the 6 hours instead of 5 because I was waiting for the cream cheese to blend, and the meat was kinda dry. Not bad though. Ate it with egg noodles. My boyfriend liked it more than I did.

We used all the changes that jiilybean14 recommended and it was really good. The meat was a bit overcooked which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars! The mushrooms and bullion cube was a GREAT CHOICE! 
We will def. make again!

I realized that I did not have beef broth but I did have a can of French onion soup so I used that and left out the chopped onions. It was easy and good. I did  cook it on low for 6 hours.

This has become a family favorite.  Who'd of thought that a crockpot meal with 5 ingredients and very little effort would taste this good!
By the way, I didn't change a single ingredient...

This turned out really bland. The final product needed salt and pepper. It was interesting using cream cheese instead of sour cream. If I use this recipe again, it will need some revisions.

I agree that once recipes are tweaked they are no longer "the recipe" that is being rated, but I did make this recipe using the review notes from jessilyn. It was by far the best crock pot beef stroganoff I've ever made. This will now be the only recipe I use for beef stroganoff and I will be sharing it with others. Thanks jessilyn!

The cook time is far too long and the sauce never thickens. It's just a soupy mess.

This was very good, and easy to make!  I did brown the beef in a little olive oil before placing in the crockpot.  This sealed in the juices of the beef.  Delicious!

Loved this recipe. Use beef stock instead of water and if you find out more people are coming than anticipated (and it is too late to add more beef) then simply add a pound of mushrooms and another can of soup. These additions only need a couple of hours in the slow cooker.

I was really disappointed when I made this for Sunday dinner! I followed every step and I did not change any of the ingredients, and I also cooked it on low and let it cook for the amount of time it called for! When I was making our plates for dinner I put the egg noodles on the plate first then I opened my crockpot and was going to use a fork to pull the out and place it over the noodles when I seen that it looked like a big gray pile of shredded beef, I had to use a spoon to get it out and it had no taste whatsoever! I did not like to much of anything about this recipe except for the fact I used my crockpot and didn't have to be on my feet constantly watching the pot on the stove! I will never make this again!

This recipe was easy, delicious and a real crowd pleaser.  I ended up using an entire 8 oz. bar of cream cheese (just so I could get rid of it) and the dish turned out amazing.  It was creamy with tons of flavor.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This recipe was good once you made some additions, as others suggested.  One suggestion I have is, if you're going to write a review please make sure you know how to spell.  It doesn't make you look very credible if you can't spell simple words when writing anything.

Oh my GOSH! Could this get any easier?!

I followed one suggestion and added a dollop of sour cream to the mixture because somehow that makes beef stroganoff have that special, 'TANG'. YUMMY!

Took some suggestions from other reviews, adding sour cream just before serving. I also added a bay leaf in the begging and two cans of sliced mushrooms with the juice. It came out perfect and tasted delicious!

The recipe itself is easy and delicious. I have always found stew meat to have a funny (low quality?) taste to it. Next time I will choose a higher quality cut of meat. Other than that, the flavor and the smells are great!!! I served mine with egg noodles.

I used what I had on hand and my family enjoyed it. I used thin cut shoulder steak and regular cream of mushroom soup (not golden), I had a 12 oz tub of cream cheese spread that was maybe only 3/4 full and I put all of that in.  I used a tablespoon and 1/2 Worcestershire and I used chicken broth instead of water.  I added a little black pepper and a teaspoon or so of minced garlic. I put the cream cheese in the crockpot at the same time I put all the other ingredients in. I cooked on high for about an hour and turned it down to low for another 4 hours and then stirred in cooked elbow macaroni and served.

I read the reviews and added some extras like garlic and used cream cheese and a little sour cream my husband liked it and he is the cook in our house. I also used the suggestion of onion soup mix but I used the whole packet . I believe I used about 2 1/2 lbs of London broil cut up came out nice snd tender . I myself don't like to give 5 stars to a recipe if it is changed from original but the recipe had a good base and o believe it would of been oj like that but had to go with some of the suggestions ! Thanks Allrecipes live this site

Creamy and flavorful sauce. The beef was so tender that it no longer maintained its cubed form. Very easy.

I have a similar one except with chicken.  Can either use 4 chicken breasts or chicken tenders.
Put chicken in crock pot with 1/2 to 1 pkg of dry Italian salad dressing, 1 can cream of chicken soup.  Cook for 3-4 hours, then add 4-8 oz cream cheese, cook for another 1/2 hour.
We found the full pkg of Italian salad dressing was too strong, so use only 1/2 pkg.  Depending on the number of chicken breasts or tenders, use your judgment on the amount of cream cheese.

OK...I read the first two reviews and did make the changes.  I HATE making changes to a recipe because I want to respect it.  However, I don't have time for mistakes or issues with this family. With the slight changes, it was FABULOUS! Changed out water with beef broth. Sherry might actually make it good.  Threw in half package of onion soup mix.  Threw in beef cube.  The one other thing...I'm going to DOUBLE the meat and possibly triple the sauce!  :)  It was gone too fast and I wanted leftovers!

I made this dish exactly like the recipe. This recipe is easy, but there wasn't enough meat. The Worcestershire gives it an unappealing after taste. Using cream cheese was not a good idea. The recipe should have called for sour cream. I will not be making this recipe again.

The whole family loved this one, even the picky eater.  Changes I made: use 1/4 c beef bouillon instead of water, add 1/2 tsp each salt & pepper, add 1 clove minced garlic, use sour cream instead of cream cheese.  I also mixed 1 T corn starch with 2T cold water & mixed in with sour cream as a thickener.  Next time I'll use 1.5 pounds of meat and keep all other measurements the same.

I made this with a couple of changes suggested by other reviewers. I used a chuck roast that I cubed, added some garlic, 1/2 package of Beefy Onion soup mix and 1/3 c sour cream. I used beef broth instead of water. I also added sliced mushrooms about 30 mins before serving. Served over hot buttered egg noodles. It had lots of flavor and the sour cream & cream cheese mix gave a nice tangy sauce. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious with the following adjustments based on others feedback:
Double recipe - 2 pounds good sirloin 
Low setting 5-6 hours.
No water, only beef broth - 1 can.
No chopped onions. Use 1 packet of Onion soup mix. 
Add a large dollop (1/2 cup) of sour cream at the end.
Add sauteed mushrooms near end.

Made this last night for dinner and loved it! I did make it with chicken as that's all I had, added a can of mushrooms and a bit of seasoning (salt, pepper, thyme and garlic)  and it was delicious! Can't wait to try it again with beef!

This turned out really good...definitely a keeper for the crock pot.  I doulbled this recipe and it translated really well.  Like most other users, I made some modifications like adding onion soup mix and sour cream.   Since I was doubling, I used 1 packet of onion soup mix, and two heaping TB's of sour cream along with 8 ozs. of cream cheese.  I used a large can of Progresso's "Recipe Starters" cream of mushroom soup and even though it wasn't golden mushroom, it still turned out really good.  Also, I sauteed slices of portobello mushroom in butter and topped it when serving.  Delish!!

I read a bunch of the reviews and followed some of the alterations.  I sauteed the onion with some fresh garlic and added the meat to just brown the outside, not cook all the way through, before adding it to the sauce in the slow cooker.  I added about a half cup of sour cream for an extra tang. Served it over egg noodles and it was pretty good.  I'll probably make it again as it was easy and my kids also ate it.  It was very good as left overs the next day for lunch too :)

Great and easy recipe!  Added black pepper and garlic salt at the outset.  About an hour from serving we decided it needed more seasoning, so I added a t. of beef granules (to a doubled recipe).  Perfectly seasoned at that point!  Also like I said, I needed to double the recipe, but I only used 4 oz of cream cheese (reduced fat) and threw in just a bit of reduced fat sour cream that I had on hand (maybe 2 T.).  Very simple and I loved the fact that we didn't need to brown the beef before putting it in the crock pot.  Yeah sure, that may have made it better, but for its simplicity, this was wonderful.

This was awful. Stroganoff isn't salty. This was unbelievably salty. 
I made this exactly to the directions and found the meat was overcooked. 
But more than anything the saltiness put me off.

Made this the other night for the kiddos while husband was out of town.  I doubled for my family of six.  Came out beautifully as written - I just seasoned meat before throwing it in.  Has made great leftovers too!

Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I used a chuck roast that I cut up.  I floured and browned the meat slightly (in vegetable oil) before adding to the slow cooker.  I used 2 cans of the soup and added a good 1 cup of beef broth instead of water.  I used cream cheese and sour cream at the end.  I also added some fresh mushrooms (without saute first) to the last hour of cooking and they added nicely to the dish.

Used all the recommendations from jessilynn, Oct 15, 2008 review and it came out delicious! Only addition, 1/4 cup sherry added in the last half hour of cooking.

This.... was not good. Flavorless, the cream cheese was overwhelming....A star for being super easy, but, that's it.

I don't like the flavor or the Golden Mushroom Soup. I fixed it as stated the last time and with added ingredients this time. I didn't like it either time.

This recipe was very good and very easy to make. The meat was so tender. I followed the recipe exact except I had to omit the onion because I didn't have any on hand. But the taste was still excellent without it. My family doesn't really like mushrooms so next time I will try this recipe with regular Cream of Mushroom soup. Thank You for a great, easy, and inexpensive meal.

1. 8 hrs is too long.  5 hours at most on low.

2. Too salty for those with low sodium restrictions.

3. To be honest, cream of mushroom would taste so much better.

Just didn't like it, not a "true" stroganoff taste.

I loved this recipe, but I made a few of the suggested changes... hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. I doubled the recipe and added salt and pepper, a packet of dry onion soup stuff, a beef bouillion cube, used London Broil, and added sauteed mushrooms a half hour before serving. I also only cooked it on low for 6 hours.

First, I've never had beef stroganoff so I don't really know what it's supposed to be like.  My husband seems to like it just fine.  But I don't know what it is, this recipe doesn't seem to work well for me.  It always seems to come out a little dry for me.  The meat is fine and the flavors seem fine but it is not very saucy?  I've tried using beef broth for more flavor and I've increased the amount of water/broth and it still seems to come out a little dry.  Maybe it's my crock pot?  But the other things I make with the crock pot comes out fine.  I don't know.  I'll still make it since my husband likes it and it's easy to make.

I needed a quick meal so I used lightly browned ground beef instead of stew meat and heated everything in a large stock pot -- it took about 30 minutes total and had a nice flavor. The kids liked it served over rice.

I generally find that crockpot stews have too much sauce so I used 1 1/2 pounds of meat, which seemed about right. I made no enhancements this time. Next time I will try adding part of an envelope of onion soup mix and some mushrooms.

this was absolutely amazing, i love that it called for cream cheese. was extremely rich and creamy. i should have read other reviews and doubled the sauce ingredients. After 8 hrs on low in the slow cooker, it seemed like there wasn't as much and it was pretty thick. i had to add water at the end when adding the cream cheese so it would thin out a bit. PERFECT recipe, just needed more sauce :)

I made a double batch. I used cream of mushroom soup only because my small town store didn't have Golden Mushroom.  We all loved this meal!  My kids have ask me to make it again.  I put it together while home on my lunch hour and it was ready when we got home, I just cooked some egg noodles and rolls to go with it.  DELISH!!!

I made this almost to the recipe, but I used ground beef as that is what I had thawed. Also, I don't stock cream cheese or sour cream so I used plain unsweetened greek yogurt. I thought it was a nice stroganoff taste. I will probably use this recipe again if I cook stroganoff again.

I tried it for the first time last week.....it is FANTASTIC!!! I just bought a slow cooker to replace my broken one, and this recipe is the first one I tried! I substituted a little bit of Country Bob's Sauce for the Worcestershire (which I did not have), and it turned out great! Will make this again!

We tried this recipe for dinner tonight.  It was good, but I had to jazz it up a bit before it was done cooking.  I added one clove pressed garlic, and another tablespoon worstershire.  I think you could easily replace the 1/4 cup water for 1/4 cup red wine.  It would richer up the sauce a little more!

Tasted great and super easy. Didn't have cream cheese so I used sour cream and it turned out fine. Glad to add a new slow cooker recipe to my box!

I used a whole onion and two cans of soup but this recipe was really bland.  The meat was also tough, which I realize is the meat and not the recipe, but the way it's prepared doesn't help.  I may try it in the future with the huge list of modifications to see if that's any better.

I have been having beef stroganoff for years, it is my favorite meal. I did make the variations, I have made it twice, the first time I used regular mushroom soup and it was amazing (adding in garlic, sliced mushrooms, onion dip packet, and half sour cream half cream cheese) the second time I basically did the same but with the golden soup, MUCH better the first time. (:

I add salt,pepper,garlic powder,flour and brown the beef stew or chuck roast. 1/2 cup or more beef broth in place of water. I use 2 cans of soup (condensed golden mushroom soup)Cook in slow cooker 3 hours on low .If i do not have onion,use packet onion soup mix.Add a little sour cream and a little cream cheese and stir very good just before serving. I serve over noodles or rice

It was okay. I didn't like the cream cheese and if I make it again, I will leave it out. I prefer sour cream and I did add nearly a half cup to the recipe. I wish I would have taken the time to flour and brown the meat as another reviewer did. It might have improved the flavor.

I followed JillyBean14's ideas with the exception of adding the additional onion soup. In addition to the onion soup, I omitted the mushrooms. I also swapped cream of celery for cream of mushroom soup because I hate mushrooms. Using JillyBean14's suggestions made for a delicious dinner!

I have used this recipe many times over the last year, this EXACT recipe.  It is a huge hit with both of my children AND my husband and for all three of them to love and request ANY dish is a miracle so bravo Jessica, I tip my virtual hat to you my dear.  I now make this recipe twice every month and I have to keep it unpredictable, otherwise we have friends and family who "randomly" pop over for a dinner visit on stroganoff night!

this came out really really well!  Used a 6 lb, trimmed, eye of round roast. Also added the onion soup, used two cans of Golden Mushroom Soup. I did brown the cubes of meat first and reduced the drippings before I put it in the crock pot. Really really good and EASY.

Love this recipe!  Used the suggestions of others and doubled the soup and water, added a package of onion soup mix, sauteed about 4 cremini  mushrooms and added them at the end plus added a large dallop of sour cream to the cream cheese.

This was easy, but kind of bland. I used regular mushroom soup though. I added sauteed mushrooms at the end and that helped a lot. I didn't like the cream cheese, I think I'd replace it with sour cream next time. HOWEVER, it was easy, used things in my fridge, and though I wouldn't serve it to friends it was perfectly good for a one off dinner.

This was only "okay". Although it had good flavor, the cream cheese did not melt properly, and it was a little too watery. I even put the dinner plates back in the cabinet and, instead, served it over noodles in soup bowls due to the consistency. Even though I only gave it 3 stars, I may make it again...but would try a shorter cook time, and would not add the 1/4 c water. Was definitely an easy recipe, though...which is nice!!

not as good as I had hoped.  Too salty, maybe making it with a low sodium soup would be good.

Would have rated this 5-stars, but the original recipe needs all of the tweaks & tips from other reviewers in order to really make it 5-star worthy!  This is a super easy stroganoff recipe & my family loved it!

Thank you JILLYBEAN14 for the summary. I followed all your suggestions except I increased the beef to 3 pounds.  This is excellent! My husband isn't a sour cream fan, so this really made a hit with him to minimize use of sour cream to obtain a wonderful stroganoff. Whenever I find a good deal on beef stew meat or chuck roast, this is the meal of week!

This was ok but we didn't love it. The cream cheese didn't mix in very easily (not sure if I did something wrong there) and I wasn't too happy with the flavor it gave. I actually liked it better before I added the cream cheese and I found myself wishing I had skipped it. I think I will try another recipe next time.

I skipped the crock pot and made the sauce on the stove (only because I forgot to start it in the morning).  The only modification I made was to use about 4 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and no water.  It was a hit at my house.  Hubby, two boys, and ZERO leftovers!

Just made this today!  Wow!  great flavor for such an easy recipe!  My 10 year old ate it without complaint.  I used 2 pounds of beef stew meat instead of 1 pound and did not double the other ingredients.  Highly recommend this recipe.  I've already shared it with a few friends and my family has asked me to make it again!!!  ENJOY

I liked this, it's really easy though I used small pieces of stew beef and it was done in 2 hrs on high!  I added some garlic, pepper and 1/3 package of lipton soup onion mix.  Not sure it needed the mix, made it very dippy, but it was still good AND easy.  I also added a package of sliced mushrooms and they were good.  Next time I think maybe broccoli or peas too.

Excellent.  Following another reviewers advice, I did double the soup, add 1/2 pack onion soup mix, and threw in sauted mushrooms 30 min before serving.  I don't think it matters whether you add sour cream or cream cheese.

Good flavor without sour cream. Balanced taste with heartiness. Cooked on high for 5 hours in the crock pot. Meat was shredded when it was time to eat, but that was fine with us. Added frozen peas/carrot mix that I cooked the night before. Also, added fresh mushrooms when it was time to add the fat-free cream cheese.

Loved it! I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce and it was fantastic. Adding the golden mushroom soup was a nice change from the traditional sauce used for beef stroganoff. Will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you Jessica!

This was a good recipe, but I did double the golden mushroom soup, added a cup of onions and also added fresh mushrooms.  After I added the cream cheese, it was really bland.  I then added 4 oz of sour cream and it really helped.  In my opinion the cream cheese makes it creamy, but does nothing for the flavor and adding sour cream is a must otherwise to me it was bland.  My husband really liked it which is great.  I thought it was just fine or okay.

I made this not knowing that stroganoff is one of my husband's few dislikes... I personally thought the sauce tasted pretty good, HOWEVER, the meat was dry and practically inedible. I don't know what I did wrong (I always follow the recipe closely the first time, then make changes), but I will have to disagree with most of the reviews. We went to Subway for dinner

I loved this recipe. As a college student with a tight budget and a crock pot, it was perfect. I added a lot of seasoning like garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, etc. It turned out so well.

Listened to some of the reviews, added more golden mushroom, added sauteed mushrooms, used 2 lbs. beef, added garlic, added 1/2 packet french onion soup.  Used Beef Broth instead of Water.  It was really yummy and great comfort food.

My best friend gave me this recipe and I had to become an allrecipes.com member just to say how great this is!   It's so easy to make and incredibly tasty.  The texture is what gets me.  Perfect!  The best thing about it is that it reheats wonderfully.  It doesn't separate and keeps its consistency.  Very flavorful!

Made this for supper tonight and my VERY picky kids actually ate it without much complaint - one even said that it was good which is huge in my house. Very simple and extremely easy to make. I even quadrupled the recipe and packaged up the raw ingredients and threw them in the freezer for those rushed days where I have little time to make dinner.

After reading other reviews (thank-you JILLYBEAN14!), I made this dish with all the changes and it was delicious! My husband also enjoyed it (he's a hard one to crack). I'm not sure how it would've turned out had I not modified. Definitely a 5-star with the modifications though.

This was not as good as I'd hoped. While simple, it may be too simple. It was alright on the taste scale, a little salty but nothing spectacular. If i choose to make beef stroganoff again, i'll choose another recipe.

A great recipe if you use JILLIEBEAN14's recommendations.  I agree with another review that says the original recipe is not 5 star.  I normally make the recipe from my BHG Cookbook, but was looking for a slow cooker recipe.  This was delicious, but a little saltier than I prefer (due to the canned soup and onion mix).  Will make again when I need a slow cooker dinner, but will be sticking to my original recipe as well.

I made this tonight with the following additions (from other reviews):  3 10.75 can Golden mushroom soup 1 cup beef broth 1 clove of minced garlic 1 envelope of beefy onion soup A doll-up of sour cream before serving Salt & Pepper  It was 4 stars, not 5, but 4. My mother makes this with 2 large cans of Cream of Chicken and 1 large can of water where the meat is totally drowning in liquid and the meat is better that way in my opinion.

This recipe was pretty good, but definitley not like a traditional beef stroganoff.  I omitted the chopped onion, used 2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1/2 cup water, 1 packet beef bouillion, few dashes garlic powder, few dashes black pepper, used 4 oz cream cheese and few tbsps sour cream then thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  5-6 hours on low was long enough to cook it, sauce started burning around edges around 5-1/2 hours on low so adjust cooking time.

Really good!  Followed other reviewers so that I would have leftovers.  Used 2 1/2 lbs stew meat, 3 cans of golden mushroom soup, half a pack of onion soup mixture, 1cup of beef broth. Added 4ozs of cream cheese at the end along with a large dollop of sour cream.  Tossed the noodles with some butter. Yum!

Great recipe for a slow cooker as the beef gets very tender.  I suggest adding a can of mushrooms and cooking your onions until tender before dropping them in the pot.  I also browned the meat but don't know if that was necessary.

I read some of the other reviews before making this recipe and decided to follow their lead and make some substitutions/additions.  I used beef broth instead of water, sour cream instead of cream cheese, and I added a 1/2 packet of dried onion soup mix.  The soup mix made my condo reek!  I was concerned that this would end up tasting strongly of onions but it turned out really well!  I will definitely make this again, but omit the soup mix.

A World Class dish!  My wife, who's generally just happy with my cooking, raved about this.  My only variation was using red onion, it being milder.

Made this for dinner tonight. The husband had 2 plates and I thought it was pretty tastey. The store didn't have golden cream mushroom so I used the garlic cream of mushroom instead. Also took other reviewers advice and used 1/2 pkt of french onion soup mix and threw in a dollop of sour cream in the end with the cream cheese. I didn't double the sauce I thought it was fine and mixed it with a half a bag of egg noodles. It's a make again for sure! I liked the garlic cream of mushroom so I think I'll stick with that.

This was very good as well as economical.  I did as the first reviewer who read over 400 reviews.  My parents really loved this and my boyfriend thought it was good too.  I'd recommend for easy and satisfying and cheap dinner.

When I made this, I used the recipe everyone tweaked a bit.  What came out was a great starting point, next time I'm going to use 2 lbs of THAWED meat (mine was still a bit frozen when I put in this morning and my husband dropped his fork when he saw the meat was still quite pink,) and cut back on either the soup or onion dry soup because it was very salty.  Everything else had good consistency and flavor!

Used many of the most popular suggestions. Besides suggestions, cooked this on stove top. Was short on time so cooked meat in pressure cooker. Also reduced the amount of onions because of picky kids. FANTASTIC taste!!!

Wondeful!  Cut a plain old arm roast into bite sized pieces, added a package of dry leek soup, fresh garlic clove, 2 mushroom soups, 1/4 cup vegable broth instead of water and ll the other ingredients.  Added a couple of spoons of sour cream at the end too.  Absolutely unbelieveable!

I made this and instead of the golden mushroom soup i had to use cream of mushroom without msg in it which was the healthy choice, and omg it was delicious my husband ate 3 helpings. Also we used the bowtie pasta because i actually forgot to get any pasta at the store and i added mushrooms, used philadephia cream cheese and we just loved it.

This was so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe, but substituted beef broth for the water and reduced fat sour cream for the cream cheese. I added a little garlic powder, salt, and pepper (it's not listed in the recipe, but I think it's a given). Next time I'll make sure to add some mushrooms at the end. I cooked it on low for about 6 hrs and the meat was so tender and juicy!

I thought it was good but the husband did not.  I made it exactly as stated but added some mushrooms (because I love mushrooms!!).  I would make it again for myself but my husband prefers recipes with sour cream as opposed to cream cheese.

Excellent recipe!  A new addition to my repertoire.  Also, if you don't want to use noodles, put the mix over some dark toast and make it a sophisticated version of you-know-what on a shingle :]]]

I made this recipe with the suggestions I gained from the other reviews (1/2 sour cream/ 1/2 cream cheese; 1/2 packet of onion soup mix; 8oz of sauted mushrooms; turned the quarter cup into beef broth). The major difference I did was instead of beef I made this with venison. Since I prefer beef over venison but want to make my hunting husband happy I wanted to find a recipe that we would both enjoy. I didn't have all the ingredients and needed to run to the store while still getting this going in the crockpot for dinner -- I browned the venison in some vegetable oil and 5 minced garlic cloves and then put that in the crockpot. Then I sauted 3/4 of an onion and added that to the pan. When I got back from the store I added the remaining ingredients and let it cook for 1 hour more (6-7 hours total for the meat). The meat was super tender and we loved the rich flavor. I doubled the batch so that we could have have lunches for a couple of days. Will definitely be making again using either beef or venison. We ate ours over wide egg noodles.

This dish was very good! I took a reviewers tip to add a bouillion cube to the mix. I also had to thickien the sauce up a bit with cornstarch, but otherwise was delicious!

I made this with 1 and 1/2 lbs of meat and added the noodles directly to the dish after cooking and it was a huge hit!  I serve left overs on Friday evening and this was the first one to go!  My husband liked it better the day after...

I thought this recipe was easy to make and tasted great.  I did use a little variation based on JILLYBEAN's review that I think made it much better.  I did forget to use the sauteed mushrooms and really think that would have made it just so much better.  Also, instead of cubed beef stew meat I actually took 3 steaks out of the freezer and cut those into cubes and added them to the slow cooker still moderately frozen.  Stew meat would probably have been fine but I'm always concerned it will come out tough.  I also added uncooked Egg Noodles to the pot about 20 minutes before serving (enough time to let them cook).  I used an entire bag.  This worked well if you don't want to dirty an additional pot but next time I'll try just putting the stroganoff on top of the noodles and see how that works out.  All in all a great recipe and my husband loved it.

Never had beef stroganoff, was tasty.  Wouldn't really consider this enough for 4 though.  Fortunately it was just my husband and I.

This was a hit at dinner last night.  I am a house mother at a children's home and ihave 7 boys that I take care of, some of who are very picky eaters.  I think only 2 of them didn't have seconds or thirds.  I was afraid I had made too much but there was only a little left over.  My husband had it for lunch today and said it was just as good as last night.  The consensus was  that we have it again.

I followed JillyBean's review directions exactly (add 1 beef bouillon cube, half a packet of lipton onion soup mix, plus a package of fresh mushrooms, garlic powder, salt, pep, etc.) and it came out perfectly! A little salty because of the soup but was still delicious and flavorful.

I made this using all the suggestions from the top 2 or 3 reviews and my family LOVED it. Comments were "You can make this any time" and "I'm having seconds, thirds, fourths, fifths.... until I'm full".  Thank you for a rare treat - a meal EVERYONE loved! This is going into the "keep forever" box.

This dish was amazing! Even my husband liked it. I did add some chopped onions and a clove of garlic (which i took out before we ate). added some salt and pepper and used sour cream and a little bit of cream cheese. the golden mushroom soup was a must and i did double that after reading others reviews. YUM!

This was by far the best beef stroganoff that I have ever had. I used 2 lbs of stew beef and the same amount of ingredients for everything else. I also added a dollop of reduced fat sour cream and instead of original sour cream, I used 1/3 less fat. Delicious over egg noodles. Will make again and again. Thank you!

This was very good. I made a few changes also as others did. My first change was to flour the stew meat prior to placing in the crock pot.  I just shook it in a ziploc bag with flour until coated. As per other suggestions I used double the mushroom soup, I used half a packet of onion soup mix, and half a packet of beef gravy mix. I also added 3 tsp of minced garlic. In addition, I used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup beef broth, although next time I may try using less liquid and perhaps using a little red wine as well for flavor (I had to use a little cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken the sauce). I also added some mushrooms to this as well. I opted to use sourcream versus cream cheese. I used 4 oz initially and added more to taste. I served over buttered egg noodles. This was an easy base recipe that can be easily tweaked to specific preferences. Loved it and even the picky children in the family enjoyed it! It's on their "make again list"!

Only changes I made was to saute 1/3 small onion and 2 garlic. I dumped that into the crock. I also doubled the soup and water to make extra sauce. add a little salt and pepper then the cream cheese at the end with a big spoonful of sour cream.

Loved the cream cheese!  The only way I've ever made this at all is with cream of mushroom soup and hamburger, so I loved this one but my son said he likes the old way better.  The taste is very rich, and I made the meat one day and the noodles the next night.  It made a huge batch and went together very quickly the second night.  Thanks!  It's a keeper!

I made this on the stovetop instead of in the slowcooker. I added onions and mushrooms that I sauteed in butter, red wine, salt, pepper and garlic. Very good recipe, Super salty though!

I tried with golden mushroom once, and cream of mushroom and actually liked cream of mushroom better. We served over brown rice instead of noodles and it was great.

I only did four stars because I didn't get to eat any!  The kids ended up eating it all while I had a hot date with my husband.  One did say it would be better with more mushrooms.

I made this exactly as written (upped the quantity to increase portions).  Excellent! More than enough sauce, cream cheese was a nice alternative.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe. This will definately be a keeper for the weekday crockpot.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Should have tasted it before it was served.  I found the flavor to be very boring and because it was in a crock pot, the cream cheese was lumpy.  Next time I will use this as a basic recipe and add more flavor, i,e., garlic, onion seasonings.

This is a quick and simple way to make beef stroganoff.  Throw everything in the pot in the morning and you have a delicious meal for dinner.  All you need to do at dinner time and boil egg noodles.  I always double this recipe so that you use a full block of cream cheese and two cans of soup.  A must try!

Excellent!!  I doubled the recipe so I could have some leftovers (which also where great).  Some changes I made were:  I used Cream of Mushroom soup because that is all I had and I substituted one can of beef broth for the water.  I also added two cans of mushrooms (drained; I would have used fresh, but didn't have any on hand).  I also forgot the worcestershire.  I will definitely make this again and next time I will try to remember the worcestershire :) and am going to try the Golden Mushroom soup and decide which soup I like best.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a keeper.  Very good.  For those of you that didn't think it was very oriental, I add 1/2 ginger. I also reduced the suger. It was tasty and my family ate every bite.

Some people said to double the sauce, but that made it seem like i didn't have enough meat to go with all the sauce. I did 2x meat and 3x sauce (soup+water) and I need to add more meat to be able to use up the rest of the sauce. I also did what some suggested and used both sour cream and cream cheese and it was tasty.

This recipe has a good flavor but a tad too salty for me.  The gravy turned into a paste.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add beef broth and fresh portabello mushrooms.

This was suprisingly good for how easy it was.  Next time, I think I would replace the cream cheese with sour cream. I was just a little too creamy for us. I did add a jar of sliced mushrooms I had in the fridge just to use them up.  This was a perfect meal to have in the crock pot for hubby when Im working in the evening.  All he has to do is boil noodles (make a vegetable- yeah, right!) and dinner is served!

Cooking time seemed off. The cubed stew meat turned into a stringy mess. The flavor of the gravy was delicious, however.

I alter this recipe so much based on other reviewer's suggestions that the original recipe cannot be rated 5 stars. The altered recipe is fantastic, using the "most useful" reviews as a guide.

I followed other reviews and make the following changes: doubled the meat, soup, and water, and used 1/2 onion chopped (did not measure). I also added pepper and 1/2 T minced garlic. I cooked on low for 6 hours. 30 minutes before serving, I sauteed 8 oz fresh white mushrooms in butter and added to the slow cooker. I added a big spoonful of sour cream and the cream chese (4 oz) right before serving. I served it over egg noodles. It was delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

Yum!  Even better as leftovers!  The only modification that I made was that I added some sour cream as other reviews had suggested.

Sooooooo good, and so easy!  I left out the mushrooms since I'm the only one in the family that likes them.  I followed the changes suggested by Jillybean14...it's perfect!!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  Even my picky 10 year old ate two BIG helpings.  I browned my stew  meat  along with the onions first and added a package of dry onion soup mix into the mixture.  We will have this a LOT.

Made for the first time tonight and my boyfriend loved it! After reading some of the reviews I did make the following adjustments; added burgundy wine, used 2 ounces cream cheese, 2 ounces sour cream, added fresh ground pepper and salt, and half a packet of beef onion mix.

Mine came out a little more soupy than I expected, so I will use less water and broth next time, but the overall taste was good.

OMGosh, my family loved this! I used stew meat and had 1 frozen steak that I thawed and added also. Will be making many more times! Creamy and tender, good on a cold winter night! Add a green veggie & fruit to round out the meal!

This was a great recipe!  I followed another reviewers suggestions in using 2 cans of soup and doubling the water.  I also added salt and pepper, garlic and some onion soup mix.  I found it a bit salty for my taste, so I would omit the extra salt next time I make it.  I let it cook on high for 5.5 hrs and added in some sauteed mushrooms at the end with the cream cheese and some sour cream.  If this is your first time using beef stew meat like it was for me, don't worry... the longer you cook the meat, the more tender it gets.  I was afraid because at the beginning the meat seemed really tough, but by the end, it was very tender and started to fall apart.  Can't wait to make it again!!

I followed the suggestions of JBean and it turned out like sauce with bits of meat hiding in it somewhere.  I liked the taste but too soupy this way.  Will go back to the orig. recipe next time and just add the 1/2 packet of onion soup, a little sour cream and s&p.  Simple and pretty good.

I'm giving this one a 4 because I loved it but my husband thought it was "ok".  I think he wants it more traditional, and I'm not sure what that entails but since a lot of people have mentioned sour cream I think I'll try it next time.  I'm starting to think the cream cheese thing is a hit or miss, though.  Also, the sauce DOES need to be doubled, otherwise its not nearly enough to properly cook your meat and coat your noodles.  We had fettucinne so we just ate it over that and it was yummy.  This is such a great recipe and SO easy that I'm going to keep trying to suit it to my husband's taste.

I do not like Been Stroganoff. My mom made this recipe last night for dinner. Let me tell you it was AMAZING. I am now getting the recipe myself to make for dinner later this week. I can't wait to have it again!

My family loved this ....even the picky eaters ....  I have a large family so I pretty much tripled this recipe ....  the only thing I did different was I seasoned the meat with our preferred seasonings and I used "Cream of Mushroom and Garlic"  soup instead of just Golden Mushroom or Cream of mushroom ....this was very tasty and leftovers reheated well.

This was really good. I first browned my meat, then added it to the crock pot. Then as others have suggested I doubled up on the sauce, but omitted the onions. I did however use the entire packet of Onion soup mix.  Served over egg noodles, definetly a keeper.

This was such an easy recipe to follow and cook. My husband and his friend just raved about this one. It felt really good to be able to make a homemade stroganoff that tasted so good!! This is definitely a keeper and will probably be a staple in my house for years to come. I followed the recipe to the letter the first time, I think I may dress it up a bit next time by adding sauteed mushrooms and sour cream.

This was great!  First I tried it following the recipe exactly.  I was okay, but the second time I tried it I added the onion soup mix as suggested.  Everyone devoured it.  Even my husband who could usually take or leave beef stroganoff.  This one is a keeper!

Great stroganoff!   I made a few changes though. I used 1 1/2 lbs of stew meat, I put 3 cubes of beef bouillon in 2 cups of water along with the golden mushroom soup. 10 minutes before serving I mixed in 8 oz. of cream cheese and 1 cup of sour cream - this thickened the sauce and made that classic stroganoff flavor really come out.   If I had extra mushrooms on hand, I would have definetely sauteed and added them to the dish. I served this over egg noodles and everyone ate it up!

Good, I followed recommendations of adding some onion soup mix, beef bouillion, and garlic, but not extra salt (lots in the bouillion and soup mix already) I added a nice dash of sherry as well (sounded like a good idea, but didn't really taste it..next time i'll put two dashes in). Smelled SOOOOO Good while it was cooking, and tasted great.

The only thing I did differently from the recipe was added pepper (did not add salt as so many others suggested as condensed soup is usually plenty salty and it was a good call IMO). I also sautéed 8 oz of mushrooms and added at end plus a spoonful of sour cream.  It really is the perfect amount of sauce to meat ratio and the right amount for 4 servings. I did double it as I was feeding 5 adults and 2 kids and I had about 3 servings leftover.  It was a definite hit!

Oh my goodness! This was so good, I couldn't stop eating it! Smelled it cooking all day and couldn't wait... it definitely lived up! I did add a little more water to it, and some mushrooms as well. Definitely recommend this recipe!

He loves this!  I used plain yogurt the first time as I didn't have cream cheese, and regular cream of mushroom soup.  It was great, but then I used sour cream the next time and it was even better.  left out the water as we like a richer sauce, but added more onion.  this is a fantastic recipe!

Made this recipe according to Jillybean14's suggestions, the only resemblance to  true Beef Stroganoff is that it has beef and a creamy texture. This recipe is okay in it's own right but beef stroganoff it is not. The original recipe does not even contain mushrooms. Like I said okay in it's own right. Will not make again as I do have a great stroganoff recipe that I make with beef tenderloin.

I made this exactly as the recipe states (with the exception of winging a  few measurements) and this is the best stroganoff ever. I've tried to sneak in McCormick's slow-cooker packet on my boyfriend, feeling lazy, and he thought I'd burned a great meal... I had to tell him I cheated. Go with this one.. How hard is it to throw ingredients into a slow cooker? Awesome, awesome recipe!

This is decent, but nothing to write home about. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added sauteed mushrooms toward the end (so glad I did), doubled the soup, water, and onion (also glad I did that), and added a bullion cube, as well as garlic, salt, and pepper. This would have been quite bland (and not saucey enough) without those changes. I don't plan on making this recipe again, but it does inspire me to try to come up with a crock pot version of my mom's stroganoff recipe.

Very good, and so easy. I added some garlic powder, salt and pepper. Perfect for a cold fall evening!

I gave this recipe four stars because the cut of meat listed but this still turned out very good.  I made adjustments according to jillybeans review only I didn't double the sauce because I didn't need very much.  I also used cream of mushroom because that was all I had on hand and opted for the sour cream instead of the cream cheese.  I used the soup mix, garlic, pepper and bullion cube as well.  It was a little salty but not to bad I think next time I will opt for the broth instead of the worc and probably cut sirloin strips.  All in all I give this recipe a great review. :)  Thanks!

I wouldn't make this again. The juice was greasy from the stew meat...and it was a lean cut.

I did use some suggestions - such as add some spices, but I did enjoy this - I cooked it one night and we got invited out - so I put in fridge and brought to boil over stove the next night = it was still good! :)

This recipe could not be easier. There is practically no prep. The whole house smelled yummy after this dish was in the crock pot for two hours.    We will definitely make this again!

Absolutely loved this dish.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.  I took the other reviewers suggestions into consideration before preparing. I used the two cans of soup as directed, instead of two cans of water I used 1 1/2 and 1/2 beef broth. The last 2 hours I sauteed the fresh mushrooms in a tablespoon of butter and sprinkled garlic powder over them and then added them into the crock pot.  Finally, I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to make it just a little thicker gravy. A keeper in the favorites - I will definitely make this one again!.Thank you!

Cream cheese is not Stroganoff, sour cream is.  Traditionally made Stroganoff tastes MUCH better and is not that much harder, it just takes a more expesive cut of meat. Not a saver for us.

This was really good, double the meat, the soup, and the water, add half pkg dry onion soup mix, I didn't use onion because of that, I added a small can of mushrooms and served over buttered egg noodles. The sauce could be a little thicker but it was very good, only needs to cook on LOW for 5 hours. I used 4 oz of ONLY sour cream, no cream cheese. Def a good dish with these changes!

This recipe was fantastic using JillBean14's and Momsavedbygrace's modifications. I did add salt,pepper and garlic powder to the floured meat before I browned it. I Mixed 1 Tbs. cornstarch in 2 Tbs. cold water and added that, then put in the sour cream and cream cheese. The sauce thickened up very nicely after about half an hour on high. Will make again and again!

Another good recipe! Use 2 1/2 pounds of stew meat, two cans of golden mushroom soup and one can of beef broth.  Browned the meat (used a little flour, garlic powder and salt and pepper to coat) and sauteed the onions before putting it in the slow cooker. Very tasty for a little effort.

This was ok. I followed Jillian's recommendations, and although it turned out ok and was very easy to put together I probably will look for another recipe to try as well. I did, because of time, have to cook on high..will try again one day cooking all day and see if it is better!

First off here are the changes I made (1st time making it and I doubled the recipe): Used 2 pounds of london broil (cubed), 1 can of Golden Mushroom & 1 can of Cream of Onion Soups, 1 cup small diced onion, 1T Worcestershire, 1/2 cup of water, 2T minced garlic, 1 beef bullion cube, and 1 can sliced mushrooms (drained the water). At the end I added 5 ounces low-fat cream cheese and 1T cornstarch + 2T water.  Served over buttered egg noodles. **Result** The sauce was a bit too thick (although I wanted a thicker sauce). The meat was wonderful but something was a bit off.. it was missing something that I couldn't pin-point. It was great as leftovers too. I will make again if I can figure out what was missing :)

I'm sorry to only give this a three.  I followed directions except I added some red wine to the meat to make it more tendor.  I did add some dry french onion soup as one poster suggested. I don't think I would do that again.  I will make this again but not with stew meat.  I think this calls for a much better peice of meat.

Made as directed except I used sour cream instead of the cream cheese. My family loved it and was happily surprised with the chunky stew meat vs the ordinary think steak you usually use in beef stroganoff. Will make again.

yum! for a healthier take, sub greek yogurt (usually in the organic section at the grocery store) for the cream cheese. I suppose you could sub regular yogurt too, but greak yogurt isn't sweet at all and tastes much truer to sour cream/cream cheese. this was a great recipe. thanks!

This recipe is great!  I used cubed venison steak since  we have so much of that and it tasted wonderful!  I added 3 cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper.  Per other reviews I also sauteed about 4 oz of fresh mushrooms to go on top.  I will definitely make this again.

We LOVED this recipe.  I used half cream cheese and half sour cream, and I used boneless beef short ribs which turned out SO GOOD. They were tender and shredded perfectly.  Great dinner.  Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. After leaving the first part of the recipe all day in my crock pot I walked up to the door wondering who in the neighborhood had the great smelling food. Once I opened my door, I was very excited to see that it was me. I added just a little bit of milk at the same time as I added the cream cheese. So good, hmmm, hmmm.

This was a very good stroganoff.  Put the cream cheese and 1/4 cup sour cream in 1 hour before done and it was not lumpy or watery.  One reviewer said to make it with golden mushroom soup or don't make it at all.  I absolutely could not find golden mushroom soup, so used cream of mushroom and it tasted great.

A huge hit with my husband.  Easy to prepare. I increased the amounts to serve 6.  Next time will increase to serve 8 so we have plenty of leftovers.

My daughter and I give this a 5-star rating because of how yummy it is and how easy it is to make!  We put it over rice - it's one of our new favorite "comfort" foods!  Definitely a keeper.

This was good. I am not sure I am used to the cream cheese flavoring. I might try using sour cream and half and half next time. I also put it over rice because I like rice, but you definitely loose the conceptual taste of beef stroganoff by doing this. it was a nice way to just put most all things in a pot and leave it. The family really liked this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This is by far the best stroganoff my husband and I have ever tasted!  We thought it was better made with sour cream though.

I did not care for this recipe at all... for one it was like soup in the end.  I followed the reviews and it just didn't turn out good... I don't think if you have to adjust the recipe by following the reviews that it deserves 5 stars... It was just too soupy for my taste

I used 2 cans of lower sodium soup and it still had too much salt for my taste. My boyfriend really liked it though...I'm just not a huge stroganoff fan.  I also added 1/2 a packet of onion soup so that probably added more salt as well

This was awesome! My family loved it! I did take some of the advice from past reviews. Only problem was it seemed a little salty with the soup mix and salt, next time I may omit the salt.

This meal was a HUGE hit in our house!! My hubby and I absolutely LOVED it!! I followed the tips from MomSavedByGrace and Jillybean.... It was awesome!! Perfect flavor. I agree to soften the creame cheese first...wasnt any big deal but it did have a couple unmelted chunks..next time I think I will add a smidge more cream cheese and sour cream. This has made our top 5 list for sure! YUM!! :0)

This was allright, but certainly nothing special - even with my ch. As many others have, I also took JILLYBEAN & jessilynn's advice. Here's what I did: a) tossed my meat w/ a generous sprinkling of pepper & seasoned salt, b) doubled the sauce ing. (i.e. 2 cans of golden mushroom soup AND 1/2 cup H2O) & c) add. an extra 1/4 c. chopped onion, 3 (minced) garlic cloves, 1/2 of a Lipton onion soup pk., a beef bullion cube & a "dollup" of sour cream (at the very end - w/ the cream cheese). Please note: it helps to soften your cream cheese in the micro. B4 adding it to the sc; it will melt much easier this way. I didn't think to do this, and, as a result, my stroganoff had tiny lumps in it (my fiance couldn't get past the "gross" lumps lol...). Oh, and you MUST use golden mushroom soup. It is very diff. from the standard cream of mushroom soup. For one, it has lg. chunks of mushroom in it. Since this recipe doesn't call for fresh mushrooms, it is imperative, then, to use the correct type of soup. My fiance & I don't like mushrooms (we like mushroom soups tho - go figure!), so we didn't add any, but if you like them, you should (they will enhance the end product,IMHO)! Served over buttered egg noodles w/ peas & croissants on the side, this was an "OK" dinner. I will not be making it again (I like my Can Opener Gourmet cookbook recipe much better), but if you like stroganoff, please give this a try! Tx. Jessica :)

This recipe (and most other Stroganoff recipes) is not tasty at all, no matter what quality of canned soup you use. Just do NOT ever use any canned or powdered soup in a stew! Just go through a little bit more trouble and make it all yourself. It is worth it!

This was pretty good. Although, I found it to be a bit bland and too creamy tasting. I tried to sub the water with beef broth and used spices and garlic, but still just not what I was looking for. Lacking the tang.

If you own a crock pot, you owe it to yourself to try this.  Cook on low setting for 4 1/2 hours and the beef will fall apart.  I used low fat cream cheese and my boyfriend didn't notice the difference.  We love this!  It's the perfect comfort food.

This was good, but a little salty!  I added a teaspoon of extra salt and I would NOT recommend doing that. I used cream of mushroom soup and added extra mushrooms. I will probably try this again, minus the salt.

I printed this out in 2003 and finally made it.  Now I am sorry I didn't find it earlier.  This couldn't be easier to make and it is a great recipe.  Maybe I'll try to mix in an herb or two next time but just as written, we enjoyed it.

This was a very easy and tasty meal.  My husband said it was OK and when I asked if I should make it again he said "if you want to".  Which means he wasn't thrilled.  BUT he actually ate it, so that's a good sign!

Had a good taste, but I am not fond of mushrooms (I can handle the tiny ones in cream of mushroom and I like the flavor of the soups, just not the big sized mushrooms).  I substituted beef broth for the water and added about 1/3 packet of onion soup mix.  I like my stroganoff to be more runny, I guess gravy-like, so I would add more beef broth.

I doubled this recipe, added a minced clove of garlic and used a good sirloin cut. If you are a loyal stroganoff person you wont be overly impressed. My kids did like it, but my husband and I preferred the original. We still added sourcream because cream cheese did not give it the added tang we like. It was good for a crock pot recipe but if you are a loyal stroganoff person you wont be overly impressed.

I was looking forward to making this, not only because it was easy but because the reviews made it seem so great. I followed JillyBean’s suggestions and I must admit I am very disappointed. Doubling the sauce, but leaving the cream cheese the same makes it almost impossible to taste the cream cheese. Same for the worchestershire sauce. Frankly, the whole thing just tastes like onion soup mix. I wouldn’t make this again.

I love this recipe.  At first, I was reluctant to use cream because I have always used sour cream but trust me, the cream cheese "hits the spot" more than the sour cream.   Just way better, In my opinion.

Good meal and so easy.  Chop up the meat into small pieces if the stew meat you buy is in big chunks.  They are hard to eat without a knife if they are in big pieces.

Easy and awesome. I added a package of chopped spinach and a package sliced fresh mushrooms to get some extra veggies. I served it on egg noodles, then on top of rice. A new favorite meal.

Wow!  I can't believe how good this recipe is.  I started everything yesterday morning, left the house to run a bunch of errands, came back in the evening and it was ready to go.  I added about 1 tsp. of paprika and a little bit of seasoning mix and it was delicious.  This will defnitely become a part of my "go-to" recipe file!  Thank you.

I thought with all the fav reviews this recipe would be amazing. Pretty bland though. (And made with all "extras" - sour cream, garlic, salt/pepper, etc.). You definitely need to cook more than 5 hours on low. That's crazy. It's stew beef, it's a tough cut. Follow original recipe on cooking times. But add in sliced fresh mushrooms. Much better. Not the best though. Disappointed. :(

I was a little dissapointed in this recipe. I chose this because it does not use sour cream. I found that it was way too runny and not creamy enough. I appreciate you sharing it though.

I made this yesterday/last night. It was VERY easy to through together--that was a plus. It is really nice to have it cooking when you get home. I love walking into the house and there are already good smells coming from the kitchen!  I made it as written (I HATE when people completely alter a recipe and then rate it--rate the recipe as it was written and then alter it if you feel the need.) Next time I would add more mushrooms. My wife is a HUGE mushroom fan and there just weren't enough in the soup. I will probably also add a good shot of paprika to give it a little more kick.  Thanks for a good/very quick and easy recipe

Wow! I did not expect this recipe to be THIS good.  After reading and reading past reviews, I took a chance on Jillypie's version and it was outstanding.  Three little things:  I had a problem getting the cream cheese to melt evenly, so next time I will soften it up in the microwave a little before adding it.  I also think that I will make two little changes, I'd like to try it with more sour cream - maybe 4 oz sour cream and 2 oz cream cheese - because I really like that sour cream flavor.  Also, next time I will add more sauteed mushrooms at the very end.  All-in-all a great recipe!

Excellent base recipe...tweaked it a bit like other reviewers. Came out the best Stroganoff ever, and my 4 yr old asked if we could have it for dinner every night! Loved the tang of cream cheese in it! My changes...I used blade steak and browned the meat first,frying the onions as well. Added a bit of beef boullion to the water, and sprinkled 1/4 packet of onion soup mix over the meat in the slow cooker. I used cream of mushroom soup and canned mushrooms, and I wouldn't change it! Also tossed in a couple of tablespoons of sour cream with the cream cheese at the end. Served it on whole wheat broad noodles the first night with steamed veggies, and the next night I served it over boiled, slightly mashed baby white potatoes with a salad. Two totally different meals.  Absolutely delicious!!

Wow, delicious! this dish has become a staple at my house. I add a clove of minced garlic with the meat, and use half sour cream/ half cream cheese at the end. Serve over a half bag of cooked egg noodles (if you double the recipe, use a full bag!)

As a quick and easy beef stroganoff, this is ok. For a 2 1/2 pound roast, thinly sliced, I used 2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1 can regular cream of mushroom soup, 1 soup can of water  along with some additonal garlic and onion powder.  I used the 4 oz cream cheese and added a dollop of sour cream.

This just didn't taste like beef stroganoff. The meat tasted good, and it was a good consistency (added an extra can of soup), but I have tried other recipes for this that were much more to my liking, and I won't be using this one again.

I gave this five stars because it is so easy and doesn't take a lot of time, but was delicious!  I didn't use cream cheese, though, just sour cream.  I did increase the sauce ingredients at other reviewers suggested and also added fresh mushrooms near the end.  The kids weren't huge fans, so I gave them the meat separately (drained the "gravy") and noodles with butter and parmesan. I figured the sauce isn't exactly healthy anyway!

This was awesome! YUMMY! My husband, the meat eater, loved this and said this one is a keeper. I used 2 cans of the soup, half a pack of the onion soup mix, a can of mushrooms, 4 oz of cream cheese (low fat), and a heaping tablespoon of low fat sour cream. I cooked it on med for 8 hrs and served w/ egg noodles. AWESOME, YUMMY! Try it

It was okay.  I thought it was very bland and I followed the recipe exactly.  However, my really picky kids loved it and are eating leftovers for lunch.  If I make it again, I'd definately follow some of the other suggestions (I don't like to rate it if it isn't made exactly..) to perk up the flavor.  Nice base though.

This was good, it was a little lacking in the flavor department but is a great base recipe. Next time I will use beef broth instead of water,  add sour cream and garlic.  I will saute mushrooms with the onions first and I will double up on the recipe, my bf got most of this

I was very happy to find a recipe for slow cooker beef stroganoff. I did make some changes based on what I had at home. I used ground beef, had no idea where to find golden mushroom soup so I used regular and added extra mushrooms (tasted fine), and I used sour cream instead of cream cheese for the extra tang. Make sure you had it at the end, though, or you wont taste it!

I love this idea! I added my own spin on it, I did away with the onions and added 1/2 tbs onion powder, I dont usually have worcestershire sauce on hand so I added another 1/4 cup water, added garlic and when I put the cream cheese in, I also put in sour cream. We have it 2 or 3 times a month A+++

So, so good!  I followed the recommendation about the bouillon cube, salt, pepper, garlic and dry onion soup mix.  Also, 5 hours on low (even with frozen meat) was long enough.  Served over egg noodles.

It was tasty stick-to-your-ribs comfort food.  A word of caution:  I think many of the newer slow cookers have a much higher temperature than the older ones.  Mine does, anyhow.  Parts of this recipe ended up charred to the edges of the cooker, and it was way under the recommended time.  The middle was still edible though, and enjoyable:)

This was great!  Although, I did make a few changes. In addition to the meat and can of GOLDEN Mushroom soup I also added 1 can of Campbell's french onion soup.  I was running late for work and didn't have time to chop an onion and this worked great.  I had already added the water, but next time I will skip the water and just put in the onion soup.  I also doubled the Worcestershire sauce and added 6 large mushrooms sliced.  I let all this cook in the crock pot for about 5  hours and then it went to the keep warm setting for a couple more hours.  It looked a bit overcooked on the edges, but it was fine after I stired it.  When I got home, I turned the crock pot to high from the keep warm setting. Then I added salt, the cream cheese and about 1/2c of sour cream for the kick beef stroganoff needs.  This was very good!  Next time I will use 2 pounds of stew meat.  One was just not enough after adding the extra can of soup.  This is a great work night meal!!

I use meatballs instead of the beef suggested in the recipe.  Only due to the fact that my kids love meatballs.  It turned out really nice although I had to add plenty of water towards the end as the sauce was soaked up by the meatballs.  super delish!

I loved this recipe AS IS! Next time I would add additional mushrooms cuz we like them. I do not think it needs any bouillon or additional salt. The gravy is thick enuf once the cream cheese is added. The house smelled yummy when I came home from work! Thanks Jessica!

Pretty good, fast and simple.  I followed all the extra ideas and it turned out great - golden mushroom soup, onion mix, bouillon.  It did still need a little more salt.  I used neufatchel cheese which is lower in fat.

yummy! i loved the ease of the crock pot. I stayed with the original recipe for the most part, but i doubled. So i used 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken. I also browned the steak and seasoned with steak seasoning before adding to the pot. Added garlic pwdr, onion pwdr, pepper and cayenne to soup mixture. Last i used the tub of cream cheese, let it get to room temp and it folded right in at the end of cooking. no lumps. i enjoyed this very much and will def be making again. ++ used water and didnt add beef broth or the onion soup mix like some suggested. That, with Healthy Choice cans of soup, and the sodium was reduced and still very flavorful.

This has become a regular meal at our house.  However - I use sour cream instead of cream cheese. The sour cream breaks down better than the cream cheese and the appearance is better

I haven't tried it but my husband just called me from home to tell me it was amazing! I made my own adjustments of course... doubled the meat, doubled the mushroom soup, added half a pkg of onion soup mix and 1/2 cup beef broth. He LOVED it!

This was not very impressive.  I added exta mushrooms and sour cream.  Perhaps that was the cause of mine turning out so runny that I had to thicken it with corn starch, otherwise it would have just been...beef in mushroom soup.

This was the best beef stroganoff I've ever had! I used 2 pounds of chuck roast and cut it myself. I used 3/4 cup of onions. I didn't have golden mushroom soup, so I used two cans of cream of mushroom(it was still delicious!) I did use the same amount of water and Worcestershire sauce that the recipe calls for. I also used 2 ounces of cream cheese and about half of a small container of sour cream. I cooked it on high for 1 hour and low for a little less than 4 hours. It was SO SO SO yummy! I cannot wait to make this again! The whole family loved it!

Didn't make any changes to recipe, and it was ok.. but will probably change it up a bit next time like other reviewers suggested. It seemed like it was missing something.

My 14 year old daughter won't try anything new.  When she does, she has decided before she tastes it that she does not like it.  This recipe (using sour cream, not cream cheese), got a literal two thumbs up from the toughest critic I know.  Fantastic and easy, easy, easy!

I never used to eat stroganoff.  I didn't even know what it was until my husband requested it.  I tried this recipe and it is to die for!  They're right, definitely use the "golden" mushroom soup, it's fabulous!

I'm added an extra little can of mushrooms, add some onion soup mix used fat free cream cheese instead of sour cream or regular cream cheese and replaced the meat with lean Round steak to make this a lot healthier. I've used wheat pasta instead of regular pasta or rice. Served with some carrots.

This recipe turned out REALLY well despite my concerns because of the seemingly basic ingredients.  My whole family loved it!!!  I would, however, recommend making two batches at the same time.  I have two growing boys and a hubby - all who like seconds.  With two batches, I had enough leftover to make 2 - 3 good lunch dishes for one person.  The only thing I'd recommend is using a little less water.  We like our stroganoff more like a gravy and dished over egg noodles.  So I ended up adding a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.    Otherwise - GREAT GREAT - my sons gave it a 9+ out of 10 - a rare rating for picky kids.  Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband who doesn't like beef stroganoff loved this!  I did what some other people had recommended and doubled the sauce part of the recipe.  I also sliced up a bunch of mushrooms with it and topped it with some fresh cut parsley.  Really good!  Thanks

Had the stew meat and all other  ingredients except golden muchroom soup so ended up baking this in a 325 degree oven for 3 - 4 hrs. Added extra water about halfway during the cooking time and again when I added sauteed mushrooms. Yummy!

Loved it....so easy and so delicious.  I used jillybean's recommendations minus the sour cream or mushrooms, which I didn't have on hand.  Still turned out fantastic-and very kid friendly!  Thanks!

I love this recipe and have made it on several occasions.  I did make a few changes found in the suggestions.  I brown the beef after coating it with flour and a little seasoning salt mixture.  I also substitute beef broth for the water.  I do not like mushrooms that much but my family does so I also add a small can of mushrooms to the mix.  It is one of my husbands favorites and it is easy.

GREAT RECIPE! I made a several changes to it after reading the reviews. I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, doubled the amount of water, added one can of drained mushroom and substituted the onions for 1/2 pack of dry onion soup mix. My husband hates pasta and this was a huge hit! Will definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe.  I followed the earlier suggestions of doubling the sauce but not the cream cheese, added salt and pepper and a dab of sour cream.  It was really good.  I always love a great crockpot recipe.

After reading all the reviews I thought this would be great, I followed the recommended steps of the other reviewers to the letter.  I'm sorry, but I didn't think it was very good at all.  My family ate it, but none of us loved it and most barely liked it at all.

Excellent recipe! This is so tasty after a long day. I added 2 cloves of garlic, doubled the soup, 1/2 pack onion soup, and substituted broth for the water. So tasty!   PS this recipe really only serves two.

I'm rating this even though I shouldn't because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  Instead, I substituted 2 cups of milk in place of the cream cheese to make a sort of stroganoff soup (watching the waistline).  Also, doubled everything except for the meat, added garlic and 1 lb of lightly sauteed mushrooms.  Simple and delicious!  Great stroganoff taste without all the calories.  Very hearty, don't even need egg noodles (I prefer it without).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe, but read some of the reviews and made some modifications - I used extra beef stock as well as some sauteed mushrooms. At the end of the cooking I also added some sour cream as a couple people suggested. It really needs another 20 minutes after adding the sour cream to let the flavors come together. This was MUCH better as leftovers than the first time. I will let it cook a little longer after adding the sour cream the next time.

So easy, and delicious.  Next time I will double the recipe.  I shortened the cooking time by 1 hour -- it was turning brown around the edges and the beef was definitely done.  We added a little sour cream at the end, too!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was VERY good, and of course easy.  I've made traditional beef stroganoff on the stove, flouring meat and browning for years.  I have to say this was so much more tender and flavorful.  I did add some seasonings to the meat. I used London Broil and cut in strips instead. I used 2 cans of soup. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms. I also added about 1/2 cup of red wine. Will definitly make it in crock pot from now on!

Very good, very easy, as promised. I did put in a full cup of yellow onion instead of the 1/2 cup. I also threw in some green onion and portabellas since I had some handy. I will definitely make this again since it was so easy.

very good! my husband really loved this recipe. since this was my first attempt at stroganoff i went ahead and did sour cream instead of cream cheese.   this amount left only a little extra for the two of us - make sure to double it if you are feeding more.

Yummy! I have a "tried & true" beef stroganoff recipe, but this is my new favorite. Using the slow cooker is fantastic because the meat comes out super tender. I only had 5 hours to cook mine (still did it on low) and the meat was still quite tender.  I added 1/2c beef broth and 1/2c red wine because for my taste there wasn't nearly enough sauce and with just the soup and 1/4 liquid it's really thick. I also added 1/2 packet onion soup mix for some extra flavor. The was the best stroganoff I've ever had, thanks!

Delicious! (with the modifications - 2 cans of Golden Mushroom, Lipton Onion Mix (I used a full mix, but 1/2 probably would've have been better), add'l sour cream, garlic, fresh mushrooms). Definitely will make again! Just might reduce the cream cheese for more sour cream.

I rated this 2 stars because I followed the recipe "as is" the 1st time I made it. VERY bland! 

I again made it after following other reviewers recommendations (onion soup mix, salt, pepper, garlic, mushrooms and doubling the sauce) it was perfect!

I followed the recommendations and doubled the gravy and added pepper and a half a packet of onion soup. I also sauteed my onions and garlic and browned my stew meat before putting into the crockpot and I substituted beef broth for the water. I kept the cream cheese and worcestershire sauce amounts the same. I don't know why, but my crockpot seemed to cook as if it were on high instead of low, so my gravy kept sticking to the sides of the pot (burning) and meat got so tender it began to break up in the gravy. This was still good and I definitely will make it again, but I'm only giving 4 stars because I think it needs more liquid. The consistency was a little off in my opinion, but the taste was really good. Also be careful with adding the soup mix and subbing broth for the water--it can get salty. Next time I probably will not use the soup mix since I used fresh onions anyway.

One word: INCREDIBLE. This was a really, really awesome meal and so easy. I followed all the recommended substitutions since they seemed to be a hit for everyone else: I used two cans golden mushroom soup and 1/2 cup beef broth (instead of water & bouillion cubes) so I'd have double the sauce. And  I added 1/2 packet of Lipton onion soup mix, fresh sauteed mushrooms, garlic, salt and pepper and served over egg noodles. I thought the cream cheese was super in it and only added it to the main pot. My husband opted to add a dollop of sour cream on top of his bowl. Either way, INCREDIBLE! Will make again and again.

I made this recipe last night with all the suggestions (thank you for condensing them into one review)and we absolutely loved it.  I could have licked the plate clean and my fiance had to control himself to not go back for a third helping.  I would love to serve this for guests.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Outstanding!! What a great recipe. Everyone went wild when it was finally time to eat dinner. I doubled up cause we had family over and it was still not enough. It was totally worth the 8 hr. wait. Now I want to try more slow cooker recipe's. Thank you so much for sharing this dish, it will now be a family favorite.

I felt this was pretty good, but the kids and wife all really enjoyed it. As suggested, ensured I used the golden mushroom soup. Also doubled the meat, added garlic, used some beef bouillon. Added fresh mushrooms about 1/2 hour before eating. Used a 1/2 portion of cream cheese, & added sour cream. Next time will double sour cream &skip the cream cheese.

This was really good, and I followed most of the reccomendations made my other reviewers.  I will say to definitely increase the meat, as I had a lot of left over gravy.  With 1 lb of meat, we only got 2 servings out of it.  But it was tasty and easy!

I made this recipe following many of the suggestions from other reviewers, and it came out perfect!  I have not seen my kids clean their plates so quickly.  Next time I would double the mushrooms (b/c I love them).  I served this w/ whole wheat egg noodles.

Excellent!  Very easy to make, and came out great.  My family enjoyed it, including my 2- and 6- year olds.  I followed the recipe as is, and served on egg noodles with asparagus on the side.

Excellent!  I cut my meat into small 1/4 inch cubes and sauteed with garlic.  I also used Knorr's vegetable soup instead of the onion soup - as another reviewer suggested.  The next time I make this I would make more sauce (as recommended) and also add some sauteeed mushrooms before serving.  I don't think this recipe, as stated, can easily serve 4.

Really really great weekday meal! I accidentally tossed in a can of regular cream of mushroom soup to start with, THEN started reading through the comments! I ran back out grabed a can of cream of golden mushroom and tossed that in as well. Everything else was by the recipe Turned out great! Next time I will probably use 2oz sour cream and 2oz cream cheese just to get that extra tang!

Made this last night for dinner and it thought it was wonderful! I took ALL the advice of JILLYBEAN14 and it was very tasty! The only thing I did different was used a low fat sour cream to add to the top. Perfect! Will make again!

I made this for the first time tonight.  My husband had 2 servings.  My oldest son cleaned off his plate and my youngest who doesn't usually like meat ate all the beef on his plate. I followed the advice of SavedbyGrace and Jillybean and it was excellent.  Will be making this dish very often.

Great Beef Stroganoff. So easy and so good.  After putting meat in crock pot I salt and peppered the meat.   I doubled the following ingredients, golden mushroom soup and water.  I used 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix, I also added 2 chopped garlic cloves.  I cooked on low for 6 hours, then put in sauteed onions and mushrooms.  Next time I will add 1/4 of sour cream to add to the flavor.

It was good until I added the cream cheese. It never really blended in, clumped up. Will use sour cream next time. Meat was very tender.

This had a good taste, but it was just so unbelievably rich, to the point where my boyfriend couldn't even finish it. If he can't finish something, you KNOW it's rich!  I'm assuming the cream cheese is what did it in.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used low fat cream cheese and stewing beef.  The beef turned out to be tough, but I think it was because my slow cooker cooked it to fast.  Next time I am going to try it with fat free cream cheese.

Loved it! I used a beef round roast and put it in the slow cooker for about 2-3 hours, then took it out and cut it into bite sited pieces. Otherwise I followed the recipes and it got great reviews by my family.

This dish was awesome!  Wished I had doubled the meat but I only had one pound on hand. I did follow other people's suggestions except I only had one can of golden mushroom soup so I used one can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  The gravy was very tasty.  I used it over egg noodles.  YUM!!!

Fantastic with the doubling of the soup and meat; and addition of half a packet of onion mix, garlic and pepper. I served over whole grain egg noodles and put the rest in the freezer for an even easier meal later! My kids loved it!

This recipe, as written, I imagine would be a 2-3 star recipe.  I followed others recommendations and doubled sauce, added half onion soup packet, fresh mushrooms in last 30 minutes, s&p, garlic, and 2 dallops of sour cream.  Honestly, I still didn't think it was worthy of 5 stars, but 4.  Next time I will add the entire onion soup packet...I think that will help.

One of my fiancee's faves. I usually add a few spoonfuls of sour cream for a little extra tanginess, and use about 1/2 the amount of cream cheese... it's heavenly!

This was good, and I will make it again.  I would give 5 stars, but I had to add some things to make this work for our tastes.  After mixing the soup, onion, and meat as the recipe states, I brought it up to temp on high for a couple of hours then down to low for the rest of the cooking process.  Rather than just water, I added a can of mushrooms undrained, and a beef bouillion cube.  Tasted the sauce and thought it needed something...  added garlic, a touch of salt, and pepper.  The sauce seemed a little thin, even after adding the cream cheese, so I made a corn starch slurry and that thickened it up nicely.  This also needed a healthy spoonful of sour cream for our tastes.  Served over buttered egg noodles.  Will make again, but with the changes I used this time.

I haven't made stroganoff in years. This was an awesome recipe.  I can always tell when my boyfriend thinks something is fabulous, he might not say it but he takes all of the leftovers in to work for lunch the next day.  This one was a goner.  Will definately make again.  Thanks!

Just made it last night and loved it!  I thought it tasted just as great if not better than the packet you buy to make the seasoning.  Did due some modifications as suggested: salt and pepper to taste, garlic, powder onion, and 1/2 pk onion soup mix(which I accidentally dumped all in)still tasted  great.  Double the meat and the sauce but keep cream cheese the same and worcestshire same.  Then also add a good dollop of sourcream with the cream cheese.  Loved it

so good, I could hardly stop eating it. take suggestions from others.  Coat meat with flour and salt and pepper and brown in skillet, add onions at last minutes to get a bit of brown on onions.  Added beef broth instead of water, stir in fresh mushrooms, about 1/2 hour before serving.  I also tempered my sour cream with a bit of sauce before adding to whole mixture.  Will be making again soon, really good for cold weather.

My husband thought it was way too salty.  Loved the size of the stew meat though as he says my pieces are always way too big.  I usually use round steak in my Mom's recipe that I have always made.  I liked this, but not nearly as well as my Mom's and her's is fast.  Will stick with my Mom's.  Always gotta try new recipes though, you never know when you may find a new favorite!  This was just not it this time.  It did cook up too much on the sides & I had to turn off finally & that was beore 5 hours on high.  The meat was really tender though & I loved that!  I would eat again, but not my hubby.

Very good!! I did follow some other viewers suggestions and made a few modifications.  The only issue that I had was the gravy was too thick.  The next time I make this I may try to add some beef broth to thin it out a bit.  Otherwise great recipe.  My son loved it.

This is a 5 star simple comfort food.  Nothing complicated, but my entire family of five loved it (which makes it worth 5 stars in my book)!  I made the recipe EXACTLY as stated with the single exception of cutting my stew meat into smaller bite sized pieces.  It doesn't make a lot (believe it when it says it serves 4), so next time I will probably double the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I hate to give this recipe 3 stars because of all the other reviews but it was lacking something.  I followed the recipe as written, I should've followed the suggestions of the other reviews.

EASY, PERFECT STROGANOFF! I especially like the tender meat, it just falls apart & mixes with the sauce. Mmm!  I doubled the sauce and left the amount of cream cheese the same, as other reviews suggested, plus the dollup of sour cream.  I also added sauteed mushrooms in a white wine reduction toward the end.  I used 2 cans of "Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic" soup instead of Golden Mushroom, added 1/2 packet of dry onion soup, slightly more water, & some black pepper. 
I didn't even tell my boyfriend it was "Stroganoff" for fear he would compare it to his mother's, but he LOVES it and wants it every week!

As written this isn't very good. But it did provide a good base to make changes & create my own version of Slow Cooked Beef Stroganoff. As we can't get Golden Mushroom Soup I just googled what was in it (beef stock, tomato paste & mushrooms) & added that along with some paprika & a packet of French Onion Soup mix. I added the cream cheese but it just didn't turn it into a creamy sauce so I added sour cream as well. This made the whole thing too rich so I would just use sour cream in the future.

Ok, I'm going to be one of those people that irritate me...I am rating the recipe after making changes. Following the advice of so many before me, I used half a packet of Onion soup mix in addition to the chopped onion. I used one can of Golden Mushroom soup, but also used half a can of Cream of Mushroom soup. I added garlic, salt and pepper also. Right before serving, I added the cream cheese along with a tablespoon or two of sour cream. If my husband was more of a mushroom fan, I would have added some additional mushrooms at the end as well. Great recipe!

Thank you Jillybean and MomSavedbyGrace!  I combined their tips and came up with this (8 servings).
For more sauce to save for later...
1) I doubled the meat, soup, and onion but kept the rest the same
2) 4/5 cloves of garlic
3) 1 teaspoon of pepper
4) Half a packet of Lipton's Onion Soup mix
6) 8 fresh mushrooms, sliced
7) Added a dollop of sour cream at end

I still cooked it on low for 8 hours.  Served over egg noodles, it was absolutely perfect.  I loved it and my boyfriend loved it.

This was just OK.  I expected much more by the rating.  It didn't compare to the stroganoff recipe I typicaly make.  But in all fairness this was much easier.  Not bad for a quick throw it in the crockpot day.

I was not a fan of this dish. I made it as written plus added some garlic, black pepper and boullion as another reviewer had suggested. I thought it was way too salty and the stew meat I used was hard and overdone at 8 hours on low. I will not be making this again.

This was very good even with the large mistake I made! I actually added two packages of lipton golden onion soup to this recipes instead of the cans. It turned out great and had lots of flavor. I followed jillybeans tips and also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and another 1/4 water b/c of my mistake. It turned out wonderful and was easy. Gave it four stars due to the change in recipe.

I thought this was a good recipe but you HAVE to make all the changes to it for it to come out.  I didn't make all the changes but I did use the onion soup mix.  You have to double the recipe because there is not enough sauce at all.  Mine came out really thick also.  I would make this again but make a lot of changes to it.

My family LOVES this recipe!!  We have it about once a week as it's so easy to make and it tastes so good.  I add 2 Golden Mushroom soups instead of one and also a 1/2 packet of Lipton Dry Onion Soup Mix as well.  I don't add water though.  We love it over egg noodles.

This had  good flavor and the crockpot made it easy and convenient, but I think I'll stick with my other recipe for Stroganoff.  It has a much better flavor and it actually pretty simple!

OK, this is the best recipe I've ever made from this website, quite possibly one of the best darn tasting things I've ever made - period!  I used Jillybean's instructions but I didn't add in sour cream because I didn't have it and it really didn't need it...I just put 1/2 stick of cream cheese (4oz) and 1 tbsp of worcestershire like the original recipe said and doubled the golden mushroom soup and water.  I used two pounds of cubed beef.  I added the garlic, onion, 1/2 packet of onion soup and 1 8oz can of mushroom stems and pieces at the end, about 15 minute before I put the cream cheese in.  Put the cream cheese in about 15 minutes before you eat it, because it takes a few minutes to all break down.  Honestly people, this was so good it was like dessert...my boyfriend and I seriously could not get enough.  Next time I want to try it with low fat cream cheese and whole wheat egg noodles just to make it a little healthier.

This had no flavor at all. Maybe a packet of beefy onion soup mix and some extra mushrooms would help, but as written, it's pretty blah.

I followed the altered recipies that are listed below. (bullion cube, double sauce, mushrooms, sour cream)
The BEST stroganoff I've ever tasted.My toddler who's in the not eating stage LOVED it. My hubby who hates mushrooms said it was worth picking them out because the sauce was so good.

This is an excellent slow cooker recipe! I made all the changes suggested by jillybean such as doubling the sauce but not the cream cheese etc. Although, I do think I used 6oz of cream cheese instead of 4 oz. I did not add a packet of onion soup mix as I feel that would have been salt overload (not sure if jillybean suggested that but a lot of folks did) but I did replace the water with reduced sodium beef broth. Lastly I added some fresh thyme, and instead of buying stew meat I cubed a 2.25 pound eye round roast. This is one of the easiest recipes ever and the results are fabulous!

This stuff was great - a nice change from the 'norm' stroganoff...either a)the stuff made w/crm of mushroom soup & ground beef, or b)the Hamburger Helper variety. Followed jillybean's suggestions, and had great results.

This recipe rocks! Use the special changes that the others have suggested (no need in repeating) but i personally used 8 oz of cream cheese. I LOVE crockpot stroganoff and the cream cheese was a welcome alternative! YUMM!!!

I'm not sure to rate this recipe because it needed alot of help. I added lots of garlic, salt and pepper, 2 cans of soup, extra onions,and sauteed mushrooms. Then at the end added the cream cheese and some sour cream. It was wonderful with the changes, however it's not really sticking to the recipe but it would have been really bland if I did.

Added salt, pepper and garlic and a big spoonful of sour cream at the end.  Still could've used a bit more seasoning.  I'll try a tsp of italian seasoning next time.

EASY... DELICIOUS...HEARTY...  Great recipe. I added 1 lb. of fresh mushrooms. They paired well with the sauce. The only thing I would change next time, is to DOUBLE the amount.

For low carb cookers, I served this over cauliflower rice and it was great.  I also added all other suggestions except for the dry onion soup since it has monosodium glutamate.

I made the recipe with all the changes Jillybean suggested and it turned out very well.  Even my husband liked it and he isn' partial to anything from the crockpot.  There is only one thing I would do differently.  I accidently added a whole packet of onion soup mix and it made it a bit salty.  I will stick to 1/2 packet next time.

The flavors in the sauce were fantastic, but the slow cooker made the meat very stringy.  I have had this problem with other meat in the slow cooker.  I think this recipe would have been 5 stars if not for the slow cooker making the meat strange.

If you are looking for an easy-to-make, stay at home for diner recipe, then this is it.  For how easy this recipe is, the taste is good.  However, I would not use this beef stroganoff recipe to serve to guests, it is a little on the bland side.

Wonderful recipe! Adding it to my family favorites. I didn't double meat and soup, but didn't have left overs. So I might do that next time. I followed all other suggestions written in previous reviews.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at my house.  Leftovers hardly lasted overnight.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, and it tasted awesome.  The only other thing I changed, was I added about 4 oz of sour cream.  DELICIOUS!

Used Jillybean's reccomendations and my husband just loved it! BTW I am a vegetarian so I have no way of taste-testing it along the way.  I did double the sauce as he loves any type of gravy so I know that went over well.

Followed jillybean's instructions, but used cream of chicken instead of the mushroom stuff. Since I don't like mushrooms, I left them out, but the stroganoff still turned out great! Served it up with egg noodles, broccoli and crescent rolls on the side.

I made this for a group dinner last week, with a few changes:
I used ground turkey instead of stew beef and added frozen broccoli for nutrition and color. Everyone raved about it. It was very quick and easy to prepare.

Next time I'll follow Jillybean's version.  First time I did the straight version and wondered why it's a slow cooker recipe when all you need to do is pretty much just heat everything up except the stew meat, and even that you can buy pre-tenderized, although it costs more.  

It was edible, but I'm not fussy about my own cooking, especially when I'm hungry.  If I try the straight version again, I won't bother with the slow cooker and use either pre-tenderized stew meat or some other meat that doesn't need much tenderizing (cut-up round steak would probably work just as well).

So yummy! I used all suggestions made by jillybean and it was delicious!  I accidentally put in the entire envelope of onion soup mix, but it didn't make it too salty at all.  It took a long time for the reduced fat cream cheese to melt, so I think next time I will let it sit out at room temperature for a while to soften.  Will make again and again!  Even my 19-month-old loved it!

Great Recipe!  I have made it with Golden Mushroom and with Lowfat Cream of Mushroom soup - my husband and I prefer the lowfat version.  I also substituted lowfat sour cream for the cream cheese, added minced garlic, and added mushrooms (sauteed in butter) 1/2 hour before serving.

This was FREAKING AMAZING.

I did the following changes, though:
- doubled the recipe to accommodate the beef roast i had
- didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I threw in a splash of soy sauce and steak sauce
- added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder
- left out the chopped onion
- used one can of golden mushroom soup, one can of cream of mushroom
- added some fresh thyme
- used neufachtel cheese instead of cream cheese (lower in fat, tastes just as good)

Minor chnages based on input from others...
Doubled the liquid and went 6 hrs on low.
Very, very nice dish. Meat came out tender!
Will do again.

I did the recipe with cream of mushroom and it was still very good! I cooked whole mushrooms along with all the ingredients to add chunky bits, it wsa delicious. No need to add salt or pepper, Next time I will put less Worcerstershire sauce to have the taste of mushrooms come out more.

Wonderful recipe! I goofed up and used Cream of Mushroom instead of Golden Mushroom Soup, but it still turned out so good. I had started making this for dinner and friends called to have an impromptu pot luck at their house. They loved it!!! There wasn't anything left. I used beef broth and I added some corn starch. I also added onion powder, basil, pepper and garlic.

This is now the way I cook beef strog. I still use sour cream though and add some powered beef stock to the water and also add some freshly chopped mushrooms.  I also use oyster(blade) steak and it is always so tender.  Thanks for the great recipe :)

I also followed all of jillybean14's suggestions and it was very very good. I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 5 1/2 hours. Next time I will cook for 8 so the meat is a bit more tender.

Fantastic, simply the best stroganoff I have ever had. I used many of 'JillyBean's recommendations. The leftovers rocked just the same. I really liked mine served over white rice. It was very homey, comforting and filling. I can't wait to make it again.

MADE IT DAIRY FREE VERSION....AWESOME!!!  
I have never rated a recipe before but after the popularity of this recipe in my house I wanted to.I followed the extra advice given adding garlic,mushrooms ,salt and pepper and 1 pack of onion soup(no fresh onions at all)But what was awesome was that I MADE A DAIRY FREE VERSION ,and it still was sooo good. I bought tofutti cream cheese at trader joes ,added the same amount as the cream cheese and then didn't add sour cream at the end.... and me a dairy lover loved it as well as my hubby and friends. You can get dairy free sour cream but I didnt feel it really needed it. This is a awesome,easy recipeIll be making 4 ever

This was good and simple to make. The only thing I did differently was add half of a jar of mushrooms. I will definitely make this again, but next time I might try sour cream instead of cream cheese--just to see which I like better.

Very good!  I wasn't feeling well, so my husband (who normally doesn't cook) followed the instructions and it turned out wonderful!  We added in 1 cup sour cream instead of cream cheese, because that's all that was in the house.  The beef was fork tender; great recipe for round steak!!

This is really good and really easy.  I also followed others suggestions.  I doubled the soup, doubled the water and changed it to beef broth for more flavor.  Same amt worchestire and cream cheese.  Added lipton soup mix and seasoning.  Great and I will definitely make again and add fresh mushrooms.

Very good Beef Stroganoff.  I cooked some noodles and added them along with the cream chese to add more substance and flavor.  It was also tasty warmed up the next couple of days

My family didn't care for this,  probably because I followed the suggestion to add onion soup mix.  It just didn't taste like stroganoff should.  I also don't think the cream cheese adds anything except some smoothness, and isn't worth the fat and calories.  My favorite stroganoff recipe on this website is Daria's Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff.  It's delicious with sherry instead of white wine and 8 oz  lite sour cream (14 oz is too much).  You don't need the water or flour, but if it's not quite thick enough for you, just mix a little water and cornstarch to add in.  Wait awhile though, because it will thicken as it cooks.  Also, you can use a different cut of meat than round steak.  I usually use sirloin that's on sale, and if you partially freeze or defrost it first, it's easier to cut into strips.  I'm not a purist, but cubed beef doesn't fit with stroganoff.  For a great cubed beef recipe, try the Hungarian Goulash II on noodles that's here on Allrecipes.

I've never made stroganoff before but my husband grew up on it & he LOVED this recipe...so it's a keeper! I did brown the meat in a pan before putting it in the slow cooker.

This was great!  I gave it 4 stars because it needs some modification.

What I did differently: seasoned the meat before putting it in, doubled the soup and water, added about half a packet of french onion soup mix.  Served over buttered egg noodles.  YUM!!

Yummy! Used a 3 1/2 lb. Chuck roast, two cans of Golden Mushroom Soup, a soup can of red wine and added fresh sliced mushrooms at the end.  I did not use cream cheese; instead added sour cream at the end, after adding the mushrooms.  After 6 hours in the crock pot the meat was easy to shred with two forks; I did this before the addition of mushrooms and sour cream. Served over egg noodles.

Very tasty with following Jillybean's tips.  We ate this over fettuccini noodles one night and brown rice the the other.  My husband thought this dish would be great with just sauce and meat and serve with garlic mash potatoes.  Will have to try that next time.

This is a great recipe. I do use onion soup mix instead of fresh onions for more flavor and convenience but I am sure it will still be good either way. This is a great meal to pop in the crock pot before work

Easy recipe. It looked gross, but tasted good. Serve over egg noodles and mix with corn. Second time, I made it  I added 1 cream of mushroom plus half a package of lipton soup as suggested.Both ways it was good. Don't forget to add the cream cheese.

My family loves this recipe! I add a dash of garlic, salt and pepper, a beef bouillon cube, and half a packet of onion soup mix while it's cooking on low for 5-6 hours. When it's time to add the cream cheese I also add a dollop of sour cream. Delish!

Super easy and delicious.  I have a baby, so I do make a lot of meals at one time and then freeze them.  This worked perfectly for that.  I simply took it out the day before and then popped it in the slow cooker for a no-fuss meal.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe as is but added a little chopped mushroom. It was just a tad blah for my taste. I think next time I'll try a little sour cream and maybe some garlic.

I didnt think this was that good. I would recommend NOT adding any more salt to it. Following the reviews of others I added some bullion to it and it was WAY too salty.  Even without the bullion I dont think this tastes like stroganoff. More like beef tips of some sort. I will be using my recipe for beef stroganoff on the stove from now on.

My family LOVED this dish!  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a dollop of sour cream (at the end).  You really need to stir it a couple of times to prevent burning.  I used organic beef stew meat and it was very tender/falling apart.  This is so much easier than my classic stove top recipe, which I am now replacing with this one!  LOVED IT!!

I too followed JillyBean14, with the exception of using 1.5lbs stew meat and beef broth instead of the water.  I thought the gravy was great before I added the cream cheese.  I was afraid it would not taste as good.  But I was wrong, the sauce was fab!  This will be a staple in our household from now on!

Im giving this recipe 5 stars for the taste because it did WOW me, but if it was based on texture, it would be 3 stars. It wasn't thick like I wanted it to be plus, it wanted to burn to my crockpot. I would have hated to see how it would have turned out, if I wouldn't have been around to stir it and keep an eye out on it. I think from now on I will stick to my recipe for the stove top version!

Wonderful Meal! I will make again and again!  I did use 2 cans of Golden Cream of Mushroom soup, added half an envelope french onion soup mix, added beef boulion, added sour cream with the cream cheese.  This is even better with Pork Butt!!!

Really good.  It came out a little salty as I added 1 beef boullion cube and 1/4 packet of soup onion mix.  Next time I will omit either the beef boullion or soup mix altogether.  Also added a tbls or two of sour cream at the end.  Beef was tender and base was flavorful.  Would use this as part of rotation.

I gave this a four for the convenience, but it was really only a three for taste.  I had to doctor it a little to make it work for my husband and I.  I will keep this recipe in my back pocket, but will still continue to search for the "perfect" stroganoff recipe.

This is the best stroganoff ever!  I love the cream cheese in it rather than sour cream.  I do find that I prefer my sauce thicker than what it turns out to like, so I usually just add some cornstarch to thicken it up.  Also, I cannot usually find the golden mushroom soup, so I just buy a can of cream of mushroom soup and a small can of mushrooms (drained) that I cut up before putting in the crockpot.  Defiently try out this recipe.  It's easy and oh so delicious!

We made this according to the recipe word for word and we thought it was pretty good. Our only complaint about it was that the sauce was pretty thin. Next time I think we will use more meat and probably use some cornstarch at the end of the cooking time. Other than that a good easy recipe.

Good recipe for busy working parents. This is worth making again. I used 2 lbs of beef, one packet Liptons onion soup, a little splash of red wine because it was in my hand at the time and sour cream instead of cream cheese because thats what I had. I also threw in some sliced fresh mushrooms. I threw it together in the crockpot the night before(kept it in the fridge) and turned it on in the morning. Came out great with some noodles and a salad.

Ok, like many others I, too, used JellyBean14's changes.  They are as follows: 
"(1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same,(3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a "dollup" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra "tang", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before"
I did not add the mushrooms nor the sour cream.  My family ate it, but didn't rush for seconds.  In my opinion it was WAY too salty... and I love salt.  Next time I will find ways to cut back on the sodium some how.  Mine cooked on high for 2 hours then low for 2 1/2 hour and the meat was perfectly tender.  I'll try again...

I accidentally used the cream of mushroom soup and it was too dry using 1 can only. I will try 1 can ea of cream of mushroom and golden mushroom OR with 1 can put in an additional 1/4 to 1/3 c of water or broth. Added about 1-2 T of Knorr Leek Soup Dry mix and a pinch of garlic powder, too. Excellent!!! We loved the flavor.

Can I just say that I love you?  This recipe turned out phenomenal!  I added beef broth instead of water, and no onion.  Added some garlic too.  the cream cheese added such a nice richness! my boyfriend's sister came home and said that she had been craving stroganoff all day and that this was heaven! Made mine and my boyfriend's day!  Thank you sooo much!

This was good - I used 2 cans of golden mushroom instead of 1 can cream of mushroom.  I think I will try one can of each next time because the golden mushroom was a little too strong for me.

This was the second time I've made this recipe. I wasn't "wowed" by it the first time and feel the same way now. It's just okay. It has a strong mushroom "canned soup" flavor. The cream cheese didn't totally liquify so there were little white specks in the sauce.

This is worth a try.  I think I'll stick to my regular recipe though.  Tasted better than it smelled.  I was surprised that after cooking for ten hours the onions were still crunchy (not the recipes fault) It must be the onion I bought. I should have cooked them first. I like the idea of cream cheese instead of sour cream and will incorporate into my recipe.

This is so good! I love using my slow cooker & was excited when I found this recipe. I made sure to use the suggestions made by JILLYBEAN14 & it came out perfect. One thing I did do differently was I had only 1 can golden mushroom so I had to use a can of cream of mushroom. I liked it better this way. It came out creamier to me. Will do again & again.

The best beef stroganoff I've ever tasted...people who don't even like beef stroganoff love this!  Definitely use golden mushroom soup (NOT cream of musroom) for the improved look and taste.  Love this recipe!

Excellent! Made changes that other reviewers gave and made my own. Used venison chops instead of beef and two heaping spoonfuls of low-fat sour cream instead of cream cheese ~ excellent! Doubled soup, water, and meat. Added half packet of onion soup mix. Husband claimed he hated stroganoff, so I told him it was venison with noodles and gravy...he loved it. Served it with green beans on the side.

Yum!  I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce recipe and added sour cream at the end.  It was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic and easy.  Don't change a thing.  Gave it a four because it needs to be stirred often.

Yummy this was good, Mine was a little runny, but I guess it made for more sauce over the noodles.

I followed the recipe as written, but after 6 hours of being cooked on high, the stew meat was still tough!  The sauce was fantastic, but if I make this again, I will use a different cut of beef.

It was all right. I didn't like the cream cheese in this in place of the usual sour cream. Sorry, but probably won't make it again.

I just made this for dinner tonight and we LOVED it!  Definitely going to be one of our new regular meals...  Soooo simple too!  The only regret I have is that I didn't double the recipe to allow for leftovers, but there was enough to feed our family of 5 :)  Thank you!

I wasn't sure how this would come out since I've always had beef stroganoff with sour cream and cream of mushroom soup. To my husband's and my surprise, it was excellent. I started the cooking in the morning before I left or work, came home, and dinner was almost done.

I made this recipe with the recommended modifications, except I slipped up and put in a whole packet of onion soup mix instead of 1/2. It was still EXCELLENT!!! I did have to add more salt, though as it tasted a little bland to me. But other than that, it was out of this world! I made it last week and my husband is already asking when I am going to make it again. Definately adding to my "make again" recipe stash!!!

I used some of the tips from the other reviews: (1) add salt, pepper, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix.  I used regular cream of mushroom and cooked for about 9 hours on low and it turned out fine.  Next time, I won't add as much salt.  I probably put in about a teaspoon and that seemed to be a little too much.  Between the onion soup mix and the boullion cube, it doesn't need much more salt.  Otherwise, this a great recipe.  Easy to prepare and tastes great.  What more can you ask for out of recipe?

Ok so I was a little skeptical on this one because of all of the people who said their's burned.  So right from the beginning I added two cans of water when I put it all in the cooker.  I by no means was going to go through all of the trouble of following the long list of suggestions from other reviewers so I just used the recipe as is other than the water and 1 tsp of beef boullion and it was very very good!  I don't really know how much beef I used, about a third of a london broil.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!  Oh and PS, not only was their plenty for my husband and I, I also had two whole servings left over.

I made this last night after reading all the great reviews and was really dissapointed. The flavor was not any better than if I had made some Hamburger Helper. My husband who likes just about anything didn't like it either.

Pretty Good!  Required little effort, yet yummy!  I used the cream of mushroom soup as many others did.  I also added about 2/3 cup of additional water b/c it didn't seem like enough liquid to let it go the whole day.  I DID end up thickening it with a little cornstarch... I also added garlic powder and pepper to the mix.  It fed my family of four + leftovers for lunch for today!(mixed in cooked egg noodles b/f serving. We had a vege and salad as well).  I think I will make this again and keep experimenting!

This was very good, and very easy.  I use sour cream instead of cream cheese because I had a hard time getting the cream cheese to disolve completely. Also, I used a can of beef broth in place of the water.

This was my first attempt to make a stroganoff and I loved it.  My entire family loved it.  This was so very easy to make too.  It really didn't need to cook 5 hours on high.  My meat was very tender after about 4 hours and I also tripled the recipe.

Although I thought this recipe was "passable" my sister didn't like it. With the cream cheese, she said she felt as if she was eating a dip. I'm confused as to how this recipe is supposed to yield 4 servings because it was only enough to feed my sister and my husband. Since I only have a 5 quart slow cooker and there wasn't enough liquid in this recipe to fill a slow cooker of that size, it ended up burning and drying out the meat. I will stick to Daria's Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff on this site. It does take a little more work than this recipe but it's so worth it.

This was excellent and very easy.  I subsituted the mushroom soup for cream of chicken as my hubby does not eat mushrooms and this taste just like my mom makes and she used cream of mushroom.
My even my 2 and 1 year old loved this.
Definitly a keeper!!  Thanks

I changed this recipe a bit. I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom.  I also addes about 1/2 cup of beef broth.  This was a huge hit at my dinner table and even the kids liked it.  Definitely a keeper.

this recipe was great!!! I added some salt and pepper once at the dinner table. I downed size for family of three and used about a half a bag of egg noodles and mixed it all together and it was great. served with steemed veggies on the side. I followed other hints and used the golden mushroom soup. Will make again. it was so easy after a busy day of work.

This was very tasty.  I didn't have any sour cream either, therefore, I tried this recipe.  My son usually puts butter only on his noodles, but this time he had 3 helpings (he is 11)!  He loved it.

I don't know what "golden" mushroom soup is.  Maybe it's an American thing, because in Canada I've never heard of it, nor was I able to find it.  I remember having this dish when I was younger, so I decided to try it.  I did was other reviewers suggested: added onion soup mix, garlic and pepper.  I also added sauteed mushrooms at the end.  Maybe my taste buds have changed, because this was mediocre.  I probably won't make this again.

I add carrots and peas to this dish so it really isn't Beef Stroganoff anymore ...more like Beef Stew. But that's the way my husband likes it. This is one of his favorite meals.

Made it exactly as the recipe. It was a little bit salty but the adults enjoyed it. 6yo DS wouldn't eat it, but then he's a really picky eater.

I did not enjoy this recipe, having had many other variations of beef stroganoff.  It is a very easy recipe but I did not think the flavors resembled beef stroganoff.

I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious, I only made one change, I don't like mushrooms so I used a can of french onion soup instead of the mushroom soup and I LOVE the flavor of the cream cheese, it is so much better than sour cream, serve it up with some egg noodles and corn and some fresh bread and you got yourself an easy almost mess free meal!! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Thans first of all to JILLYBEAN14 for summarizing the suggestions others have made.
This is a pretty tasty recipe. The only thing I did different (from the base recipe and JILLYBEAN14's summary) is that I used elk round steak instead of beef.

The cream cheese was much tastier than regualar sour cream in this! I also threw in some chopped carrots & red peppers. I found that it did not take 8 hours on low in my slow cooker. More like 5 hours, tops. After that the meat starts getting tough...but that's just my slow cooker. After it was done, I tossed in the cooked egg noodles & mixed all together. It was great - will have again!

Best Stroganoff I ever had. Added a bit of seasoning to the meat before cooking and mushrooms a bit before serving.  I took the advice of others and added sour cream and cut down on the cream cheese a bit.  It was sooo good!

I have made this three times and my husband loved it all three times!  I followed Jillybean14 suggestions except I used a small jar or sour cream with only a dollop of cream cheese.  I also used a whole packet of onion soup mix instead of half.

We loved this, I doubled the sauce and also added a packet of onion soup mix.  This was delicious and my husband really LOVED it.

I added two tablespoons of McCormic's "montreal steak seasoning" and it was FAN-TASTIC!

I give this a 5 because everyone in the fam loved it. So easy and the ing. were all on hand the 1st time I made it. The 2nd time I didn't have cream cheese so I sub. sour cream and it still came out great just not as thick as the first time. This one is a keeper.

Very easy and a good starting point; followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of a dollop of sour cream along with the cream cheese. It was a little salty, I'll likely make it again but experiment with the ingredients a little bit.

Very Good. Don't add too much pepper. Add 1/2 pack onion mix, beef broth instead of water, salt, pepper, garlic, sliced and sauteed mushrooms, sour cream instead of cream cheese, add extra beef.

I love slow cooker recipes.  This one was easy and very tasty.  I served it over egg noodles with glazed carrots on the side.  It was a good meal.

Even though I didn't have all ingredients exact ... this turned out fabulous!  My entire family loved it ... including my daughter who won't eat gravy on anything!  The only change I made was in the soup.  I had to double the recipe and use what I had on hand, which was cream of onion soup and roasted garlic mushroom soup ... fabulous!  I won't make homemade stroganoff any other way ... many thanks!

This really needed some garlic and maybe use a low sodium chicken broth instead of water, did not like the cream cheese, prefer sour cream.

Thanks very much for this yummy comfort food recipe. I followed the directions, except I left it in the slow cooker for a little over 10 hours. No problems whatsoever!

I only had regular mushroom soup and I doubled the recipe adding mushrooms the last half hour.  We enjoyed this on white rice and served with a side of asparagus spears.  Enjoy!

After following some recommendations it came out a bit strong.  I added pepper and 1/2 packet of onion soup... so maybe next time I will put in 1/4 of a packet and see if its better.

This was delicious. I followed the suggestions from the reviews but left out the bullion. Too much sodium. I served it over egg noodles and it turned out great! My husband and two picky kids gobbled it up. I was even asked to make it more often!

I hated this recipe, sorry.  It just didn't taste like real stroganoff to me.  The color, the taste, the texture...it just didn't do it for me.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it, so it will get a 2 star b/c liked it so much.

This is the first time I have been able to my Beef Stroganoff happen!  My meat would always be chewy to tough and the taste would end up bland.  This recipe is really good.  My husband came home from work and said his mother started to water right away and he said the taste was as good as the smells.  My son came home from school and said Mom what are you cooking - I told him and let him try a piece - his reply - you can make this every night Mom.  I love this stuff ( from the mouth of an eight yr old).

I thought this was very tasty and had a different flavor with the cream cheese versus sour cream that I personally liked.  However, my kids weren't thrilled and even the non-picky one said "I'll eat it - but don't make it again."  I'd make it again if for sure if nobody was going to complain!  LOL

I used Mushroom Onion soup instead of bothering to chop fresh onion, and replaced half the water with red wine - it turned out great!  I'll definately be making this again.  It made four portions for me topping 'no-yolk' egg noodles and I thought the consistancy was great as well.  Definately a keeper!

Cooking this length of time, even on low, reduced the sauce so much that it was very salty.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly as the original and it turned out great!  My husband loves Beef Stroganoff, and this was by far his favorite.  I was weary about the cream cheese instead of sour cream, but it really added such a pleasant flavor.  Will make again REAL soon!  Thanks for sharing

Our family just loves this one! It is sooo good.  The cream cheese never quite melts, but I love the little chunks of cream cheese.  I haven't made it with mushrooms yet as our younger son doesn't like them. But he has is own apartment, so he can make his batch his own way!

My family and I really like this recipe. I've made this a few times over the years, and when it's time to sit down to dinner I always wonder why I don't make it more often. It's a very easy, no fuss kind of meal. I pretty much followed the recipe as published only exceptions were to add salt and pepper and sauted mushrooms, finally instead of using 4 oz, I used the entire 8 oz container of cream cheese....but we're a cream cheese kind of family. Thanks for the recipe!

A good dish that my kids & husband liked that was different! I modified it w/ ingreds I had @ home. Reg. cream of mushroom soup, generous shake of garlic powder. 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix (1 whole pkg makes it too saltly!) I also used very thin sirloin tip. I tried light cream cheese & it too worked well The whole thing cooked up easily in 4-5 hrs on high.

This isn't what I remember as a kid.  For some reason, my mom's was always much creamier.  This recipe is very small on portions and was starting to burn on low in my crock pot, so I had to turn the crock pot down to warm and when I added the cream cheese I turned the heat back up, but it just wouldn't blend.  We had chunks of cream cheese floating through it, kinda gross.  It was also VERY salty, despite not adding any extra salt.  I followed the recipe exactly and it just did not remind me at all of the rich, creamy stroganoff I had as a kid.  I won't be making this one again.

Excellent!  I added some fresh chopped mushrooms to the mix, and I accidentially forgot the cream cheese but the recipe still came out FANTASTIC!  Thanks for a great slow cooker recipe.  :)

This tasted great and was easy to prepare. However, it sent the family running to the bathroom a couple of times during the evening. Maybe something I used went bad.

Very good recipe! This is the best Stroganoff recipe I have tried. My family and I don't like mushrooms so I used Cream of Potato soup instead of Cream of Mushroom soup.

LOVED IT! This turned out so well. I did everything JILLYBEAN14 did in her review except I used a whole package of onion soup mix and it was so good! My family loved it also. I will definately be making this again.

I thought this was delish..although, I did make some changes.  I seasoned, floured and seared the meat first, I then added mushrooms to the same pot that I seared the meat in and soften.  I added one pkg of onion/mushroom soup mix and let it go...It was delish...my husband said, and I quote, "This is a keeper"

Thanks!  It was great!

Wonderful. My boyfriend and I loved this. He added shredded cheese on top of his! But I liked mine the way it was. It was good and creamy. I'm sure this will go in our regular rotation.

This recipe was great!  I only altered a little bit - I used 1.5lbs of stew meat, I did not add water and I sprinked a little bit of all-purpose seasoning to the raw stew meat.
I only cooked it for about 5 hours but it was WONDERFUL over egg noodles. We have a family of 5 - soon to be 6 - so I am making at least DOUBLE next time.

It's very simple and easy to make; however, something was missing in this recipe...I don't quiet figure it out yet.  Perhaps it's the sour cream instead of cream cheese.  My husband didn't care for it much.  Sorry...

This WAS gobbled up, however, my meat eatin man said it was kind of bland. He prefers the other crock pot beef stroganoff on this site (with cream of mush soup). I made it pretty much as written, except I cooked up some onions and mushrooms and added them. (Which should have made it BETTER, I would think!) Not a bad one, but I will probably not make again.

I added a packet of the Beefy Onion mix, and I substituted Campbell's Healthy Request soup and Philly Lowfat Onion & Chive cream cheese and they made this recipe taste so rich!

I, personally, loved this recipe.  This is not as rich as the more tradional stroganoffs.  The beef was extremely tender.  I doubled the recipe and added mushrooms.  My children liked it, but wasn't devouring it like I thought they would.  My husband liked it, as well, but wasn't enthusiastic about eating it again the second night.  However, he is not a noodle man.  He probably would have loved it poured over top of mashed potatoes better.  I will definately make this again.

Loved it. I tripled it for 2 adults and 3 kids. There's enough leftovers for everyone. I used 2 golden mushroom's and 1 regular cream of mushroom(it's a little cheaper). I added a boullion cube to the water also. I also used sirloin steak because it was on sale. There was way more gravy than meat so I will add more meat next time. I had to let the cream cheese sit for about 15 mins to melt in the gravy because it looked lumpy. Overall a very easy recipe because you don't need to pre-cook the meat.

This recipe is NO fail.  We love it here.  Throw it in and forget about it.  I almost shred the beef when I put the cream cheese in, makes it easier for my little guys to eat that way.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good and easy.  Have tried with cream cheese and sour cream and both times it was delicious.  Cream cheese makes the sauce thicker - just depends on personal taste.

Have been making this recipe for months. I like to use cream of wild mushroom soup instead. It is also made in a beef broth  and the one time I used golden mushroom I didn't like it so well. I also add some garlic powder, fresh cracked pepper, a beef boullion cube dissolved in the waterusually about 1tbsp of onion soup mix and a big spoon of sour cream at the end with the cream cheese. We always serve it over egg noodles.  I have shared this recipe with many and everyone like it save one who thought it to rich. In that case I say take out the cream cheese.

Awesome!  I used rump roast because I like the way it shreads so easily.  I tried the golden mushroom soup, as well as cream of mushroom (cheaper), both were great!

Was good but not perfect. I added 1/2 tsp of mustard powder, 2 cans mushrooms and beef broth instead of water. Been making Stroganoff for years on the stove but this is much easier than standing around for 2 hours. Just needED a little more flavor and texture. Thankyou.

8 hours was a bit long, I would cook it for a shorter amount of time.  The stroganoff recipe was good, but overall I would not use it again, there has got too be something better.

This may sound weird to you but I've never had beef stroganoff before, and other than the pictures I don't really know what it looks like. BUT I did follow the recipe and I think it turned out awesome. I don't know what beef stroganoff tastes like so I don't have a point of comparison but all that matters is that it tastes good right? Oh, one thing though, I think there have been too much cream cheese. My suggestion would be to put in just half what is listed and add a little more at a time, tasting as you go.

Good recipe.  I would cut back on the cream cheese next time probably just use 2ounces or 1/4 cup of sour cream instead.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and i loved it! I did make a few changes though. I added one small onion, substituted beef broth for water, added granulated garlic, and used sour cream instead of cream cheese. I served it over egg noodles, and along with a salad, it was a perfect meal. This is a keeper in my house!

I made this twice and the second time I browned the beef and onions first.  I think that was a little nicer flavor, but I also added pepper and used white wine instead of the water.  Finally, I used cream cheese and sour cream.  I made this for a dinner party and wanted it very easy, so the recipe was quadrupled in a 6 Qt. slow cooker.  About 1/2 before serving I also added a bag and a half of egg noodles.  It soaked up too much of the juice, so I kept adding water to it.  I think if I had made extra sauce from the beginning and used only one bag of noodles it would have been perfect.

This was a good recipe, I just must not be a big fan of beef stroganoff.  It tasted good, and I was pleased with the outcome, but I don't think it will be something that I fix again.

This recipe is wonderful!  My husband put everything together in the morning and we both returned home from work to find a pleasant aroma and a hearty meal.  I used some cut up sirloin from the butcher's "extras" bin. I also used reduced fat neufchatel--no problems whatsoever.  I recommend serving the stroganoff with some crusty bread you can use to sop up the extra sauce.

3/29/06-I really liked this sauce but I was kinda turned off by the texture of the stew meat. I think I'll try some sliced flank steak next time instead. I used 2 cans of soup (didn't have golden mushroom so I used cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic), added a beef bouillion cube, added a cup of white wine & in the last hour of cooking I added a can of sliced mushrooms...I let the cream cheese come to room temp before adding & it melded perfectly. And I only cooked on low for 5 hours...the stew meat was literally falling apart. Served it over egg noodles w/ a side of frozen corn, cukes marinated in salt & sugar & their own juices & croissants.UPDATE 6/08/06---I did make this again using sliced round steak. This time I seared the meat first before adding to crockpot but otherwise cooked as I did last time. I liked the texture of the sliced round steak MUCH better!

This is a very good recipe.  Very simple to make and the family loved it.  My husband won't eat plain beef and noodles, but he did enjoy this over some mashed potatoes.

This turned out sooo yummy!  I couldn't wait for the day after so I could bring my yummy left-overs to work, and make everyone jealous.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It was PERFECT!

Fantastic result!  As I put the ingredients together in the crock pot, I found myself thinking that this was going to be really boring.  That may or may not be true, but I won't ever know due to my additions.  I tripled the sauce and to it added a small can of medium-hot diced green chiles.  It still didn't seem to be exciting enough, so I added 3 T. of *hot* green chile sauce.  At the end, I doubled the cream cheese, not tripled.  My sons both exclaimed *immediately*, "this gets 5 stars!"  My husband was so busy eating (which told me all I needed to know) that he didn't say anything about it until he was done:  "I like that; the meat is really good.  Yeah, I like that".  This has already gone into my recipe book!

This was very good, and the family enjoyed it.  I did add a beef boullion cube with 1/2 cup water and extra mushrooms, after all that's what Beef Stroganoff is all about!  I think the missing "tang" could be helped by adding a little mustard, an ingredient in a stove top version that I have used for years. I will definitely add a couple of teaspoons of it the next time I make this. Thanks for a good base recipe.

Both my wife and I loved this recipe. I made a few changes: 1 1/2 lbs Stew meat, 1 4oz. can mushrooms (8 oz. fresh next time), 1 whole large onion, 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic (change to two), 1/4 teaspoon paprika,2 tablespoons worchestershire sauce 6 oz. cream cheese, and 1/4 cup water (which is not needed).
Experiment with this recipe it is very flexible and forgiving if you make a mistake. 
ENJOY!!!

This recipe was GREAT! I've been eating stroganoff my whole life and, considering it's a no-effort version, it's very good. I was skeptical of the cram cheese instead of sour cream but it came out fine. I used dried, minced inions instead of "real" onion and that was fine. I also added mushrooms and, next time, I'd use a bit more meat than called for as there's a fair amount of shrinkage during cooking.

I thought this was a great slow cooker recipe!  Very fast and easy to make!  I would probably double it again, as I like leftovers. I was leary of trying this as my husband said he didn't like beef stroganoff, but he hadn't had it since his Mom made it years ago.  He loved this one!  Yippee!

I don't want to rate this recipe due to all of the modifications, but aside from this I can only give it 3 stars. In my opinion this is an amateur recipe (my 10 yr old could make it,) lacking in boldness and sophistication; however, I will keep this around for when it's her turn to make dinner.  I really appreciated all of the most helpful tips and whatever you do: Double the sauce!!!

Good recipie and SUPER Quick.  Throw it in the crock pot.  Boiling noodles takes more time than anything.  Add dolup of sour cream at end.

This was so great! Super easy too. The meat was tender and the sauce was so thick and had a wonderful flavor. The cream cheese was a nice touch to finish off the sauce. This will be made in our house for ever. Our two little boys loved it too! Any time I can use the crock pot and have a great result it makes me happy!I love letting the crock pot do the work for me while I get on to other more important thigs. Thank you for posting this recipe! A true kepper. :)

I thought this was a great slow-cooker recipe.  I followed the advice from Jillybean and I really enjoyed this recipe.  My partner thought it was a little too salty with the onion soup mix..I might use less of it next time.

so easy and so good.  I am glad I followed the suggestion to double the recipe.  With two of us, there was little left over.  I also followed the suggestion of bringing the cream cheese to room temp before adding.  The fresh  mushrooms were a nice touch.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Based on other reviews, I doubled the sauce (except for the cream cheese).  I added the cream cheese & some boiled egg noodles about 45 minutes before serving and let it simmer.  I turned off the heat about 15 minutes before serving to let it cool slightly.  This thickens the sauce and improves the flavor (when the food is too hot we can't taste the flavors).  This is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful - hubby and I ate almost the whole thing so I'll need to double if I want leftovers! or maybe add an extra can of soup so there is a little more sauce.  We nixed the onion - just don't love onion.  Used the cream cheese rather than sour cream (make sure to mix it in while it's good and warm so it melts all the way).  and served over egg noodles.

My family loves this recipe.  The first time I made this the sour taste of the cream cheese was too strong.  I add it an hour and a half before serving and it is perfect.  I add a small can of mushrooms, too.  My husband hates mushrooms, but loves this!

I don't understand all the high ratings for this recipe.  We just finished this (or at this I did).  My husband only ate a little, my 2 girls aged 7 and 4 didn't like it, and everyone asked me not to make it again.

this is a beautiful recipe! i served 4 people using the ingrediants for 4 and it worked fine, but no leftovers - sob! when i first put it together i was dubious as i hate cream of mushroom soup, but as the meat cooks it leeches its juices and it all comes together fantastic. only adjustment i made was to add two generous handfuls of sliced mushrooms and about 1/2 cup of extra water. any leftover sauce is soooo good soaked up with fresh soft bread.

This is a new family staple; very easy to through together. I use 2 cans of soup, beef broth instead of water, and sour cream instead of cream cheese. Thanks for sharing!

really good i have made this twice. My husband absolutly loves it.  It says it makes 4 servings but i doubled this recipe and it only served 2. I used beef broth instead of water, added salt and pepper, and a little garlic powder. I also left out the Worcestershire sauce. I never use a condensed soup in any recipe, for this I used Health Valley Organic Cream of Mushroom.  This is such a good recipe.

I made this tonight and it is great!  It has such a wonderful flavor!  The only thing that I did differently was I added some sliced green bell pepper just because I like them!  Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

AWESOME!  I put this on this morning and let it cook all day.  Even the picky child ate it!  Totally delicious.  I added the onion soup mix like other reviewers have suggested and also some extra mushrooms and sour cream with the cream cheese at the end.  What a delicious family meal with little to no effort at all.  I just added a salad and some crusty French bread...yum.  We will definitely be making this one again.

Very yummy! Added 1/2 packet onion soup mix, about 3 Tbps Worcestershire sauce, and mushrooms. Cooked on high for 3 hours and let it simmer on low for last 1/2 hour. Very easy...on disappointment was that there wasn't any leftovers. ;)

This smelled good while cooking but when i mixed in the cream cheese it turned into mush.  Since it all goes to the same place we tried it mushy and the first few forkfulls were good.  After that it was just mush.

Loved this recipe!  The beef was so tender it completely shredded while I was mixing everything up.  And the cream cheese made the dish extra creamy.  I will definitely add this to my list of favorite recipes.

I make this recipe often but with a few changes.  To make the sauce go a bit further for my family of 6, I stir in 3 heaping tbsps of flour into the beef before adding the remainder of the ingredients into the crockpot.  Then I add 1 1/2 cups of beef broth rather than 1/4 cup of water and I add 1 minced clove of garlic.  The rest is the same.  This is a family favourite :-)!

Made this last night. My husband said he liked it, my daughter didn't. I think it may have been the cream cheese. I couldn't get it all to melt so there were little lumps of it everywhere. I think I will try sour cream next time. In all it was good but not great.

This is a very good recipe, I changed a few things after reading some of the other reviews. I put 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 can of beef gravey. 1 can of mushrooms and 1 pkg. of onion soup mix. Very good. And sour cream at the end instead of cream cheese. Will be making it again.

I followed the advise of some of the other members rather than following the recipe to the T. That being said, I still don't think I'd like it for the combination just didn't appeal to my tastebuds.

My family of eight really liked this recipe.  My only problem with it was the cream cheese didn't melt all the way so was a bit lumpy.  Will definitely be making it again, though.

My husband loves the stroganoff that his nextdoor neighbor used to make and when he found this he thought it looked pretty close.  I cooked it up and used sourcream instead of cream cheese and added red wine and it came out GREAT.

Oh yeah! This is sooooo good my husband and I practically scarfed the whole thing by ourselves... granted, my 4 kids did not take to it very well but in their defence, they are wicked picky eaters and had the misfortune of walking in as I was adding the cream cheese. Oh the horror!! ;) This is an awesome recipe that will have you waiting expectantly by the crock pot....

I really liked this dish.  Husband did not and doesnt want to eat it again.  (However, he is not a huge fan of beef in general.)  Simple to make and the meat turns out very tender. The gravy is delicious.  Used the common suggestions/additions mentioned in past reviews.

My whole family raved about this.  Even my picky 7 year old. I followed other readers suggestions and used 2 cans of soup, 2 lbs beef, 1/2 c beef broth, 1/2 pkt onion soup mix and an extra dollop of sour cream. Cook on low for only 5 hours.  The meat was perfect. YUM!!

I added garlic powder and beef broth instead of plain water for more flavor. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms, there can't be a Strog without visible mushrooms. This one is a keeper, both my husband and I enjoyed it. Served over long white rice.

My brother in law and I liked it but my husband wasn't too thrilled. It made good leftovers, I followed the advice of other users and used beef broth with 2 cans soup and onion soup mix. it could have used a little more meat though.

Underwhelming.  If I made this again, I would use lots more onion, load it up with mushrooms, and revert to sour cream.

My hard to please 14 year old son loved this and told me I had to make it again. I did add a little ketchup and pepper, but I'm sure would have been just as good without any additions.

THE BEST!!  Just make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature to prevent clumping when adding to the pot.  The amount of cream cheese was a bit much for me (personal taste) so I only use a 3oz mini package.

This was v. good recipe.  My husband really liked it and he is pretty picky.
I added a can of Golden Mush Soup and a can of Campbell's French Onion (b/c I had it on hand).  I did not add Lipton Dry Mix b/c I didn't have it.  I thought it was really good though I would have used different meat b/c it was a little dry.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was awesome. We put it over rice, and was still excellent. Next time I will add more meat and reduce cooking time a little. The meat tended to fall apart after that long. The cream cheese in this dish  makes it creamy and very yummy !!!

Very easy and good.  Took suggestion of others and used 2 cans of soup, fresh mushrooms, dry onion soup mix.  Next time less dry onion soup mix and more meat but definetly a keeper.  Thanks!

This was sooooo good!! My husband who normally never comments on dinner told me TWICE how good it was! I did do as others had suggested and double the soup, and added the onion mix. I would probally add more than just the one pound of meat next time though.

This was GREAT. My husband who is very picky cleaned it up and took the leftovers for lunch. My 11 yr old had seconds! I didn't make it in the crock pot because I had no idea what to fix for dinner so I cooked it on the stove top for 2.5 hours. Had to use sour cream because the cream cheese was all gone but it still came out great! I'll make it again. They even asked for it for dinner tonight! Next time a double batch in the crockpot! Thanks Jessica for a keeper.

Fantastic.  I, as others, doubled the soup and the water and added salt, pepper, garlic and 1/2 package of onion soup mix.  Everyone loved it for supper and as leftovers.

I liked this recipe, my husband did not. I would say you must add at least 1/2 a cup of sour cream to this. It was very easy to make, I added fresh mushrooms & beef broth instead of the water. Made good leftovers.

So easy and yummy - what a treat to have this waiting for you at the end of the day!  The cream cheese was a lovely change of pace, and was definitely not overwhelmingly rich.  Two days later, I microwaved the leftovers for lunch and it lost some of it's flavor and texture.  So, try to eat it all on the day you make it for maximum tastiness.

This was good but best of all very easy to make.  I just dumped everything in the slow cooker per directions before heading out to work.  (Oh, used beef stock instead of water.)  It literally took 10 mins to do this.  When I came home about 8 hrs later, I added sour cream because that's what I had.  Served over noodles with some cooked veggies.  It was a simple and quick dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really didn't care for the cream cheese.  I think I will stick to sour cream from now on.  Also, I think that it would be better with some mushrooms added.

Added some minced garlic and pepper and half an pack of dry onion soup mix. . Also added a little cornstarch to thicken up the gravy a bit. This had a nice flavor to it, I liked the cream chesse in place of the sour cream for a change. Nice recipe to add to my collection.

this was really good.  i didn't have onions so i used some onion powder instead.  also, i used sour cream b/c i didn't have cream cheese.  it turned out very good--even my very picky kids ate it!  thanks for sharing.

Wow, this was so easy and so good! The recipe is great the way it is, though I made just a few modifications.  I lightly browned the meat, just before adding to the pot(for a min or two).  Also, I used a lit less then 4oz of cream cheese and added about 2 tbsp of Sour Cream.  Lastly I added just a tad more water, as mine was a little too thick (perhaps from having to cook it on high, due to lack of time) and added a few dashes of salt and pepper before serving over egg noodles.  This is now apart of my family’s favorite recipe box.  Thanks Jessica!

The grocery store was out of golden mushroom soup, so I had to substitute beefy mushroom soup.  We had it on top of egg noodles.  I also used light onion and chive cream cheese and added fresh sliced mushrooms at the end.  This is by far the best beef stroganoff recipe I've ever made!  Thanks for submitting it.

This was "ok". Nothing special. I probably won't make it again. I added an 8 ounce container of fresh sliced mushrooms for the last half hour. I wouldn't have liked it as much if I had left them out.

This is a wonderful recipe. My husband also raved about it, asking for leftovers the next night. I did make a few changes. I added 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon fresh ground pepper, and one can of mushrooms. I also cooked it in a skillet instead of the slow cooker. I sauteed the meat, onion, Worcestershire, water, garlic, pepper, and mushrooms. Then, I added the mushroom soup and cooked on low for about 10 minutes. Lastly, I added the cream cheese and let simmer until mixed well.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe.  I took some other advice and added pepper and a 1/2 cup of beef broth.  I also used about 6 ounces of cream cheese and a large scoop of sour cream.  I do feel though that the gravy could be a bit thicker.  Next time I will put flour on top of the beef and mix it up real good before I put the liquid in the crock pot.  It was tasty though.

It was okay.  But the texture of the meat was wierd...it disintegrated.  Maybe I cooked it too long.  I did replace the soup w/ homemade beef broth due to MSG allergies.  Also, I replaced the water w/ red wine and added mushrooms as per other reviewers suggestions.  I will try it again.

Easy to make and very tastey.  My husband loves this one.  Esp nice for busy families (I have a two year old a newborn).  I cut down the amt of cream cheese to lighten the dish.

This was only so-so and I was expecting better from the great ratings. I guess I don't care for the Worcestershire flavor. I doubled the recipe, maybe that was the problem. Double W-shire sauce was too much. Except for that and using regular cream of mush. soup and an extra can of mushrooms I made this to a tee. The cream cheese didn't do much for it but was okay if you were in a pinch but I think I'll stick to the sour cream type stroganoff.

I've never left a review before but decided I have made this so many times I should.  My kids love this!  Mom does to!  Quick and easy, delicious!  You need to use alot of the sauce on top, we like it on angel hair pasta.  I always double the recipe, but could still use more!

We enjoyed this recipe! I only changed the recipe by using regular mushroom soup instead of the golden. It came together nicely and tasted good and creamy! Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you a lot!  This recipe will be prepared at my home at least twice a month. . .we like it a lot!  I made a couple of changes--mostly from personal tastes.
I added one clove of minced garlic, and only put 2oz of cream cheese in this recipe.  I also added more onions than the recipe called for, but mainly because I am an onion lover.  
I highly reccomend this recipe to anyone.  If someone who doesn't care too much for beef like me thinks it's great, then I'm sure all of the beef lovers out there will absolutely love this one!

Certainly filling, and pretty tasty!
I had to use regular cream of mushroom because the store was out of golden mushroom. It tasted good, but I added in some shakes of paprika, and a couple extra shakes of worsteshire right before I served it. I also didn't use as much cream cheese as the recipe called for. It was pretty creamy to start.

This was very good and very easy.  I think it's nice for a change, but I prefer stroganoff made with cream of mushroom rather than golden mushroom.  I was surprised at how little this recipe actually made...I would consider it to make 3 servings.  I added chunks of mushroom to mine, and next time I will use a variety of mushrooms.

This was a good recipe.  We will make again, but next time add less cream cheese - it was a bit too creamy for me.  Quick and Easy.

This recipe was very quick and easy.  I didn't have as much time as I liked for the crock pot, so I browned the meat before putting it in.  I also thought it needed something (after tasting,) so I added a half a package of onion soup mix, garlic and black pepper.  Also used cream of mushroom soup, as I couldn't find golden mushroom soup.  I love easy, simple recipes and this fit.  Thanks for sharing, Jessica.

I used cubes of inexpensive round steak. Much cheaper than stew meat with a delicious tender texture. Everyone loved this recipe. It will go into my regular recipe list of dinners that can be made ahead to free up my evening. Thanks Jess!

I've made this recipes many times, and each time I am completely impressed!  This is such a quick and hearty dish, and my picky kids like it as well!  We serve it over wide egg noodles, but it's great over rice!

Strogonoff-esque. Certainly easy and palatable, but this is not beef strogonoff. I think that while cream cheese makes a creamy and smooth sauce, it misses the tang of sour cream. I tried adding lemon juice but didn't quite punch it up.  I added fresh garlic and portabello mushrooms. What you gain in quick and easy (slow-cooker method), you lose in authenticity. Everything is life has a trade off.

Pretty good, but the sauce was way to thin.  Next time may use some corn starch to thicken it up.

Very good tasting recipe but you need to add ALOT more meat as it has a tendency to shrink up alot.  Golden Mushroom Soup is completely different from regular creamy mushroom soup and will not taste the same.

Deeelicious!  I also think the cooking time was too long ~ glad I didn't leave it on all day when I went to work it would have been cremated!  Added sauted mushrooms and used low fat cheese.  Excellent!

Very good! I made it too salty, but that was my own fault. I added garlic, white wine, and a little chicken broth. I really enjoyed the cream cheese. Next time I won't add additional salt.

Great!!! My boyfriend is soo picky and he loved it.  I took some hints from other and used onion soup in place of water.  I also used 98% fat free cream of muchroom soup and 1/2 non-fat cream cheese and 1/2 non-fat sour cream for a lower fat version. Yummy

I'm not a big beef person, but my family enjoyed this.  Even a picky 6 year old said it was good!  I couldn't find the golden mushroom soup around here, so I used just the cream of mushroom.  I added a small can of mushrooms too.  I love the type of recipe that you just toss into the Crock Pot and this was it!

Stick to the recipe and it is really really good. Easy and great tasting substitute for what my mom used to make. Any cream of mushroom soup will work just fine. I usually double the recipe, but I don't change it.

This has become one of our favorites! You can use the cheapest meat and it comes out so tender.  I use either golden mushroom or cream of mushroom, depending on what I have on hand, but I always add extra mushrooms.  I also use sour cream instead of cream cheese.  We serve this with rice instead of noodles.  Love it!

I added cooking wine instead of water and onion soup mix and sour cream instead of cream cheese- Well, I came home to mixed reviews from my boyfriend- It needed salt and thicker sauce...I also had to use creamy mushroom soup since they do not sell golden mushroom in the stores around here..It was easy to make but disappointed with the result..I will keep searching for another recipe..

I had almost 2 lbs of meat so I used two cans of soup - one was condensed french onion and the other was "beefy mushroom" (I have never been able to find golden mushroom where I live). I also added about a dozen fresh mushroom slices.  The taste was great, but I had way too much sauce.  I don't know what to do about that because I still want the taste of both soups. Anyway, this a quick, easy, still tasty recipe - my favorite.

I totally forgot to include the werstershire and water, doubled everything else and it was fantastic! My husband didn't like it - he loved it. That speaks volumes, because he usually doesn't get excited about food.

My husband and I thought that this had a pretty good taste, but this isn't something we would want to feed other people. The smell was awful, but maybe thats because I'm pregnant...its ok to try, but don't have high hopes..you will be disappointed.

I did enjoy this and used some of the previous suggestions like red wine instead of water and adding garlic and such........it was a tasty dish.  I used light sour cream instead of cream cheese so it wouldn't seem quite as heavy and served it over egg noodles.  I just felt it could have more flavor.

A winner for sure!  I used leftover beef from the "London Broil I" recipe on this site and plain cream of mushroom soup and served over thick egg noodles.  My entire family gobbled it up and was happy for the leftovers too!  Thanks!!

Made this last night for dinner and we all enjoyed this recipe.  While not as good as the stroganoff I cook myself, this one is very quick and easy to make on a weeknight when I don't have time to go through all the normal preparations.  Like others we used half cream cheese and half sour cream.  I also added some fresh mushrooms, extra garlic, a packet of dry onion soup and sprinkled some Tony Chachere's on the stew meat.  This is a recipe that we will be making again.

this was a really creamy yummy version of stroganoff.  Kids liked it alot!  I did not use the fresh onions, but substituted with a light sprinkle of dried onions.(picky kids) I also used stir fry beef strips because that is what I had on hand.  They are very tender and the sauce is tasty.  I will make again regularly.  Great over egg noodles with crust bread.

Very Good.  I added 2 cans of mushrooms when I put it in the slow cooker.  At the end I also added a 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I had to bring it to a boil at the end on the stove to reduce the amount of liquid but it was still very good.  I will make it again.

This is great! I prepared the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. Next time I may add more onion and mushrooms. I've always made beef stroganoff with sour cream, but I really liked it with the cream cheese. It had a more mellow taste.

Sooo yummy and easy to make!  I used 2 lbs of beef (that is what we had) and was surprised how small of an amount it made.  I added 1 elephant garlic clove and red wine.  It was delicious.

This was edible. I'm not sure if it was just our personal taste, but we did not really care for this. Will not make again.

This was excellent! My husband loved it. I had a hard time getting the cream cheese to melt completely...unfortunately the sauce still had little white bits in it from the cheese. I'll need to smooth out that wrinkle to serve it to company, but the taste was great regardless!

Good, but it seems like everything cooked in the crockpot tastes the same.  I served over noodles and we did enjoy it though.

Amazing!  This is probably one of my favorite recipes I've ever gotten off of this site.  The only changes I made are dissolving a beef bouillon cube in the water, and adding a bit of Herb and Garlic cream cheese to the regular cream cheese.  The cream cheese I used was 1/3 less fat and you couldn't tell a difference.  It turned out SO delicious.  Will make it frequently!

I made this for dinner swap and got rave reviews, even from the picky eaters.  I substituted beef broth for the water and added garlic and onion soup mix to the recipe.   I will probably use a bit more meat (1-1/2 pounds) next time.  It was really easy, and my house smelled delicious.

I love how quick and easy this recipe is!  I'm not a fan of traditional stroganoff because of the sour cream.  The cream cheese gives the dish a smooth, creamy texture.  It's excellent!

I made the recipe using reviewer suggestions (double meat and soup, add garlic and mushroom, substitute sour cream for part of the cream cheese) and it was scrumptious.  I'll never make beef stroganoff any other way.

So easy!  The only changes I made were replacing the water with cooking sherry and replacing about 1 ounce of the cream cheese with sour cream.  Next time I will add a little pepper and an extra can of mushrooms, and double the recipe.  My husband and I eat low-carb, so we served it over spaghetti squash instead of noodles or rice.  Tasted great and very filling!

I have yet to find a great slow cooker recipe.  I was excited to try out this recipe after reading all the reviews but was greatly diappointed.  It DID smell good, but did not taste good - I won't make this again.

This was wonderful.  It smelled terrific while cooking.  My husband does not care for cream cheese so I added that after just to mine.  Served over noodles it is a great dish.

Very good, though I only used half of the cream cheese (it was still very rich). Dried out quite a bit, so I stirred in more water after the cream cheese was melted and incorporated. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

When I saw this recipe I figured it was *safe* enough to try on my 4 kids, 3 with sensory issues and they are VERY PICKY.

I didn't bring the actual recipe to the store with me and ended up using seasoned ground meat in garlic pepper and onion, 16 ounces of corkscrew noodles, a big can of chicken broth, a can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of muchroom and about 1 cp of water. I let this cook on low for about 5 hours, stirring occasionally, at the end I stirred in the cream cheese and about 2 TBS of the worcestershire sauce. ALL my kids ate it!! The way I made it, I would not leave on the stove all day, might get gooey. But even the next day, the noodles did not suck up all the juice and there were no leftovers! I think the cream cheese is a great idea, and it gave it just the right amount of punch. Thank you for the easy meal that EVERYONE ate! ...that has NEVER happened before:)PS... I think if I make this again, I will saute some more onions and mushrooms to put on top..too much flavor for the kids, but perfect for us.

This is by far the BEST.  I've made this many times with venison instead of beef, and to this day nobody has known that it was wild game.  (Even people who swore they hated venison.)  I've had several requests for this recipe after a couple of potlucks.  This is a must in your recipe collection.

With picky eaters I was not sure how this would be rated at our house, but I'm happy to say everyone gave it the thumbs up.  I did substitute the more traditional sour cream for the cream cheese, and served my kids the meal before adding the sour cream.  Everyone enjoyed it, and I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for posting!

WONDERFUL!!! I used regular cream of mushroom soup and added a can of sliced mushrooms, substituted the onions with onion soup, used sherry instead of water and used sour cream instead of cream cheese. I doubled the sauce because my family is sauce lovers. I will definatly be making this again!

This was so easy to make and so good!  Like others who reviewed the original recipe, I browned the meat prior to putting it in the crock pot and grilled the onions as well.  I used half sour cream and half cream cheese at the end and had no problems with it "melting/blending" right.  It was a big hit for my husband's 48th birthday - everyone loved it!

This was so easy and so delicious!  I didn't have any worchestershire so I subsituted soy sauce and it turned out great.  Even my picky husband loved this!  Thanks for the recipe Jessica.

This was very easy to make but I wasn't impressed with the taste. I think I will try it with sour cream instead of cream cheese next time. I also agree with adding some more flavor, it definately needed it.

This was REALLY easy to make, definately a keeper. It was a bit bland, but I find most stroganoff's bland. Next time I will add some red wine, garlic and shallots. And instead of water I'll use beef broth. I did not care for the cream cheese, so next time I'll definatley use sour cream.

Loved it!  Very easy.  It took a litte extra stirring to get the cream cheese melted and part of the sauce, but it was worthwhile.  YUM!

Nothing special other than it is easy. It's OK for generic comfort food but didn't knock my socks off. Probably would not make again unless added additional ingredients. Try Beef Stroganoff III under Beef Recipes. Excellent.

Pretty good. I doubled the recipe and used ground beef and normal cream of mushroom soup. Added sour cream at the end, served it over rice and my husband loved it! This recipe is super-duper easy. One recommendation: if you are doing a single recipe, the cooking time might be too long. Thanks, Jessica.

This is a great recipe!  I followed the directions exactly & cooked on Low for 8 hrs.  I served it with egg noodles.  Big hit & was so easy.  Served 3 adults & had enough for leftovers.

Very good recipe! I doubled the recipe and added fresh sauteed mushrooms. Will add some white wine next time instead of the water. Served with mashed potatoes the first night and egg noodles the second. Family loved it and inhaled! I also added 4 oz. of low fat cream cheese and about 1/2 c. low fat sour cream. Will make again!

1/4 cup of cooking sherry and used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup.

WAS A GREAT HIT WITH MY FAMILY, EVEN THE BOYS. THEY USUALLY ARE NOT TOO HOT ON BEEF OTHER THAN HAMBURGER, BUT MAN THEY LOVED THIS RECIPE. VERY TASTY AND MEAT WAS VERY TENDER. I EVEN USED TAMALE MEAT FOR THE RECIPE, WHICH IS SOMETIMES DRY BUT IT CAME OUT NICE AND TENDER. I RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE ALSO TO THE "ON THE GO" MOMS. IT SURE SAVES YOU TIME TOO. THANKS FOR SHARING.

Quick to put together & really tasty. I forgot to add the cream cheese, but thickened it with a little flour & broth from the slow coker. Served over wide egg noodles it was a real hit, even with the kids!!!

This was okay - I used wine instead of water like others suggested - I found it to be a little too salty though (probably because I used cooking sherry) I also used a package of lipton onion soup mix and added a small diced onion - I will try again and cut down on some of my salt content

I've tried this recipe several times, and really enjoyed it.  Today, I had to improvise, because I didn't have most of the ingredients.  So, I used cubed beef, a package of onion soup mix, sliced mushrooms, and at the end I stirred in 8oz of sour cream.  It was even tastier, and easier!

It was very good, but both me and my husband think that on top of substituting red wine for the water we should add a whole packet of onion soup to help spice it up.

This was really good. I left out the Worcestershire sauce ('cause I didn't have any on hand), and used minced onion instead, but it turned out delicious. It was pretty plain and simple but still very yummy! We served it over rice.

This was great!  It was very easy to throw together, and I even was a little crunched on time and still managed to get it done on "high" for 4 hours.  I served it over yolkless egg noodles with some Grands biscuits and corn and it was awesome!  -Allison

The adults thought it was great, the kids said "so-so".  The sauce was delicious, but the meat was way over-cooked.  I think 8 hours is a long time to cook it.  Maybe the beef was the wrong kind.  Anyway, it was delicious and we'll make this one again (with better meat).

Very easy and delicious.  I liked the fact that it used stew meat, already cut into pieces and inexpensive.  I did as suggested by others and sauted mushrooms and onions is some butter and added it to the stroganoff just prior to serving it.

My husband & mother *loved* this dish!  I'm not a mushroom person, so I substituted a can of cream of brocolli soup with excellent results.  I also added a little bit of white wine to the water while cooking.  The stew beef turned out wonderful & tender and the sauce was wonderful.  I will make this again & again!

I made this recipe for a special anniversary dinner for my husband.  Instead of chopped onion, I added a package of Mrs. Grass onion soup mix.  I also added a small can of chopped mushrooms, 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and lite sour cream.  It was perfect.  A keeper for sure!!

This recipe was easy to put together and very tasty. I had no golden mushroom soup so I used cream of mushroom w/garlic. I also added about 1/2 lb. of fresh sliced mushrooms. I will make this again.

This was a great way to cook the stroganoff.  The only thing I changed was adding cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom soup.

My boyfriend loved this! It was very quick and easy to make. The sauce was a little thin, so I thickened it with cornstarch before adding the cream cheese. I also used red wine in place of the water, added an 8 oz. container of pre-sliced fresh mushrooms, and added quite a bit of pepper for extra flavor.

I just wanted to say I made this today for a group of 20 men!!  I made enough for 26 people & had very little left over.  The only thing I did different was to brown the meat a little at a time & then cook the onions a bit before putting everything in the slow cooker.  I don't know that it made a difference, but the meat was very tender.  I will make this again & again!

When something is this easy, it feels silly to complain because it is really easy. 

When I ate it, though, I kept asking myself what was missing, like it missed some flavor. I even went back to check the recipe to see if I left something out.

Everyone liked it. A very very easy stroganoff

I also dredged the meat in flour and some seasoning and browned it before adding to the crock pot.  This made for a nice, thick sauce in the end.  I also added white cooking wine instead of the water and added fresh mushrooms right in the beginning.  I thought this tasted more like beef stew (minus the veggies) than beef stroganoff.  We thought it was okay but thought it was better after I added the traditional sour cream.  Overall, my husband and I like my other recipe much better which is a stovetop method and partially consists of cream of mushroom soup, sliced sirloin, sour cream, etc.  I hope to post it within the next couple of days for anyone intersted.

OK, my husband LICKED THE POT!  And he's not a pot licker!  It was too easy.  I threw the onions, soup, meat and Worcestershire sauce and water in the slow cooker and forgot about it for 8 hours.  Then, I added the cream cheese and served it over rice and got a hug for a "great dinner".  TOO GOOD!

This was simple to prepare, as the crock-pot does all the work.  Just be sure that your 
cream cheese is room temp. & softened so that it will blend smoothly.

This was fabulous.  I am not a stew meat eater, but this recipe made it tender enough for me.  I did not have time to let it simmer all day, so I put it on the stove top on low heat for a few hours.  I also added mushrooms and used bite sized stew meat.  My husband even liked it!!!

This was a great recipe. I added a small can of mushrooms, flour/water mixture to thicken, and 4oz. cream cheese. The only thing I might do differently next time is to brown the stew meat in seasoned flour before putting in the crock-pot. Thanks for a great dinner!

This is really a fabulous recipe.  Thanks, Jessica!  I added 1 cup of sliced, fresh mushrooms, 1/4 of dry sherry and 1/4 of flour to thicken the sauce.  With these additions, it was absolutely delicious!  My husband loved it.  So quick and easy!  We'll be making this a lot this winter.  It would be perfect to come home to after a day of skiing!  Thanks, again.

Really like this recipe!  The only two things that I did differently was I added a flour and Water thickener before adding the cream cheese and I only used a 3 ounce block of cream cheese.  This dish is nice and creamy and has a wonderful taste.  I highly recommend it!

Excellent recipe! I will definitely cook it again, and have already passed the recipe on. very simple. Tasty too. Only adjustment I felt was necessary to make was to add a little flour to thicken it up some. Thanks Jessica!

Excellent! Best recipe I've gotten from this site yet. Using the "Golden Mushroom" soup instead of the regular cream of mushroom soup I usually use made all the difference. So did using cream cheese instead of sour cream.

This was very delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  I added the noodles to the meat mixture right before serving but next time I think I will pour it over the noodles on each plate because it dried it up a little.  That was my fault!

I made this on the stove rather than in a slow cooker and I substituted sour cream for cream
cheese for a more traditional stroganoff.  Very
easy and very very very good.  I did add a little flour to the ground beef as I was browning it.

This was wonderful. I had no idea how easy it was to make Beef Stroganoff!!! And the cream cheese is a great sub for sour cream. Thanks for offering it. It is sure to become a regular on our menu from now on.
