Ras el Hanout is different per region,everyone has their own blend. This one is great with the execption of the amount of cinnamon. I cut it back to 1/4 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon cardamon and 1/4 ground bay and if you really want a kick 1/2 teaspoon of chinese 5 spice.

This was really good.  I used it in a lamb recipe from this website and it turned out great.  I left the white pepper out bc I didn't have it on hand, but my dish didn't seem to miss it.  Great combo of flavors.

I had most of the ingredients already, so it was nice being able to make this combination. I did reduce the amount of cinnamon as someone else suggested to 1/4 tsp and (though I've never even had it before) and it was perfect to my tasing (and I love cinnamon) I think anything more would have overpowered the other spices. Also used cumin seed as I didn't have gound (or so I though- found some after!) I plan on making this spice in a big batch and give some for Xmas!

This is similar to Dukkha, an Egyptian spice mix consisting of roasted brazil nuts, roasted sesame seeds, cumin seeds and coriander seeds, all ground a bit, with cinnamon, salt and ground black pepper.  Dukkha is proof that we are meant to be happy!

My husband and I both felt like the cinnamon was overwhelming in the spice mix. I'm bummed that I didn't like it more, I really wanted to.

I followed other reviewers' advice and only used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Amazing spice blend to use for many recipes that need a Moroccan twist!

I didn't have enough cumin so I used what I had (about 1/2 teaspoon).  It was still good.

I needed 3 tablespoons of this spice for a Moroccan Stew I was making. I had all ingredients but the allspice, so I just added a little more cinnamon, cloves. Otherwise used the recipes proportions. Delicious!  I will use it for grilled, broiled, baked or even simmered crock-pot meats.

I cannot wait to find out all of things I can make with it.  I love the subtle mixture of flavors when I put it with sweet potatoes, onions, and celery as the base for a Sweet Potato and Pecan salad.  Yumm!

I followed this to the letter and found it great!  Perhaps the other ingredients in my recipe toned down the cinnamon but I didn't find it stood out.  A couple of years ago I discovered the joy of Moroccan cooking when I saw a tagine pot in a local kitchenware shop.  I bought it for my wife and then another the following Christmas and use this spice blend almost exclusively (as well as the tagine pots)!  Haven't had a disappointed diner yet and have used it on lamb, chicken, beef, and moose (my favourite as the spices adapted very well to tone down the gaminess).

Great spice blend. I used it on popcorn with dried apricots, dates and almonds. I didn't use as much cinnamon after reading other reviews. I only used 1/4 teaspoon instead of 3/4 teaspoon. I also didn't have any turmeric so I used curry powder instead but only at 1/2 teaspoon.

This is a nice blend. I added extra cayenne and eased back on the cinnamon. Thank you for the recipe.

Made this to use in a Moroccan Lamb recipe found on Allrecipes.com and it was very, very good! (We left out the white pepper but I don't think it mattered.)
