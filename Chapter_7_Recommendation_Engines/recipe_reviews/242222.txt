Very nice!  For my second attempt I switched the order and sauteed the chickpeas and pesto first.  After 3 minutes I then added the zoodles and continued cooking for another 5 minutes.  This helped the zoodles maintain their consistency.  10/10 will make again.

Love it! I've had a Gefu Spiralschneider Spirelli (spiral slicer) for over a year and finally used it.  Since I would be the only one eating this dish, I cut the recipe in half and it made plenty and I had very small zucchinis.  I had half for dinner last night and the other half for lunch today.  The garbanzo beans and pesto added a lot of flavor to the zucchini.  (I will be making hummus with the other 3/4 can of opened garbanzo beans).  The trick is not to overcook the zucchini strands and stir as gently as possible.  I love this dish and will be making it again.  Served it with 'Lisa's Easy Chicken' from AR, along with corn on the cob, baked potato for DH, and Italian bread with 'Basil Butter' from AR.  Thanks Allie, for sharing your recipe.

With a few tweaks this recipe turned out to be fabulous!  My boyfriend and I loved it!   Following suggestions from other reviews, I added some things and I prepared them in steps.  I sautéed a small amount of thinly sliced red onion in olive oil and set aside. Then I sautéed mini Heirloom tomatoes (Trader Joe's), cut in half with a little olive oil and some garlic and S&P and set aside.  I mashed the garbanzo beans a bit and slowly heated them in the pan with homemade pesto so as not to get too hot.  Then, I sautéed the zucchini spirals in a separate pan in a little olive oil until just wilted.  I constantly tossed the zucchini while cooking so as not to get overdone.  (I always cook  my zucchini spirals separately from the recipe so it does not get mushy).  I added everything together and did a quick toss.  Topped with crushed red pepper flakes and grated gouda/parmesan cheese.   The only problem was there were no leftovers!   Next time I would double the recipe so we had leftovers.  It's a keeper!

I made this and added red onion which I sautéed first then added the zucchini into the sautéed onion pan. I diced chicken breast and cooked that separately then added it to the zucchini and chick peas and omitted the cheese and added the pesto it was incredible! My husband loved it also!

I should have done what reviewer Una did and reverse the order of the items being cooked. I kept waiting for the water from the zucchini to "cook out" and it just didn't, so consequently, my zoodles were mushy. Add in the cheese and  my dish ended up with very little texture. The flavor was okay and the chick peas were lovely in pesto.

Perfect meal for those busy nights when you need something healthy, filling and quick. I used Italian black chickpeas (ceci neri) and cashew pesto. I topped it with shredded Parmigiano Reggiano and hot peppers. Everyone loved it. Thank you for the recipe.

This was my first zoodle recipe, and it will become a staple. I was able to combine farmer's market zucchini with some freshly-made pesto and canned garbanzo beans. This recipe was delicious, and next time, I will add some chopped grape tomatoes for extra color and flavor.

This was delicious.  My tip:  don't cook the zoodles!  They always get mushy.  This salad is delicious cold, but if you prefer a warm salad, heat the pesto and chick peas before mixing into the zoodles.  Like previous reviewers, I added shredded parmesan instead of cheddar, and ribbons of fresh basil.  Will definitely make again.

I made some changes based on what I had in the kitchen.  I used  3 small zucchini and 1 yellow squash.   I used a mandolin on smallest setting as I don't have a spiralizer.  Lightly toss the zucchini with 1/2 tsp of salt and let sit in colander for 1/2 - 1.5 hrs. then squeeze out the moisture with a towel .    Heat up a glug of olive oil in a frying pan and add a thinly sliced medium onion for a few minutes to soften.  Add the zucchini and cook for a few minutes to slightly soften.   Add 1 can of chic peas which was rinsed and drained and 1/3-1/2 c. pesto.  Warm slightly.   Serve with cheddar cheese  sprinkled on top.

I love zoodles - my new favorite way to cut down calories and carbs. I omitted the  cheese, but added a tablespoon of red chile paste at the same time as pesto.   I also poured off the liquid so the zoodles didn't get too soft.

Loved this recipe!  I used the Easy Pesto recipe and followed this recipe.  The only change/addition I made was I used parm cheese and I added a few cherry tomatoes from the garden cut in half.  This was excellent!!!!

This is a a really tasty and easy recipe to follow. I don't think that it needs the beans. I used mozzarella cheese instead and it turned out great.

Substituted Parmesan cheese for the cheddar. Added grilled chicken.  Sauted in oil with red pepper flakes and sprinkled some red pepper flakes while cooking. Came out great.

I never thought to add pesto to my zoodles before. Turned out delicious. The only change I made was adding half the pesto after cooking to give the dish more flavor.

I made my own pesto, replacing the parmesan cheese with Nutritional Yeast, and shortly after sautéing the zucchini, I topped it with Follow-Your-Heart "Cheese" Shreds instead of the White Cheddar, let it melt, making this super-delicious, more healthy, and animal/environmentally friendly!

I also added sautéed chopped red bell pepper and portabello mushrooms, only because I had them.  I imagine any chopped veggies would be good with this. The sautéed beans and pesto is such a great combo. And I took some other reviewers advise on sautéing the zucchini last. Not soft and chewy like pasta, but also not soggy which sounds terrible, so I think that's good advice. Will definitely make this again. This is a keeper.

The flavors and color were great.  The ingredients were very tasty together.  I don't quite have the "hang" of the spiralizer; but did use it to make this dish. I think I would use my KitchenAid shredder and the vegetables just wouldn't be in a long string.

This was tasty, and doesn't sit heavy in your stomach like pasta. I added more chick peas to up the protein, and used grated parmesan for the cheese. Simple, easy, and yummy!

Delicious and so easy!  I used parmesan instead and loved it.  The zucchini did not need to cook as long as the reccipe calls for.

It tasted delicious but I too was frustrated with the mushy and watery zucchini. Thank you to a previous reviewer who suggested to cook the chick peas first - I will try that this week!

Not a big garbanzo bean fan so I left them out.  I'm in love with zoodles!  I made a very filling lunch for about 150 calories.  Will never make rice or noodles again.  Love the spiral ninja to make the noodles.  Zoodles are good raw or cooked but don't take long to heat up to get a good crunch.

I hate recipes that call for partial cans of food, so I put the entire can in.  My kids enjoy helping spiral the veggies, so it could be an easy weeknight meal and a great way to use your abundant summer garden zucchini.

Outstanding way to use all the zucchini and my spiralizer. I sauteed yellow onion first, then followed the recipe. I did not have white cheddar but did not miss it. What I didn't eat that night, I had for breakfast in the morning!

Had it with grilled pork loin chops.
