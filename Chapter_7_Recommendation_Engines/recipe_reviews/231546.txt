This recipe get 4-stars, O-N-L-Y after significant changes. I used leftover BBQ beef steak and added more veggies. I eliminated the lemon juice, I added some soya sauce, Chinese 5-Spice and made a VERY nice Cranberry - Asian Stirfry that can be modified with seafood or chicken.  The cranberry sauce is a nice change!!

My mother and rest of family really liked this dish. However I was not as impressed with it. I took out the carrots and snap peas and put in pepper stir fry instead. Don't get me wrong it tasted good, but I just wouldn't eat a second helping.

I really liked this. so did most of my family. I made this mostly as written, I did substitute chopped cabbage for the peas, 'cause that's what I had on hand. I felt the garlic went well with the cranberry sauce. I had a little trouble getting the cranberry sauce to melt all the way, next time I might try melting it in the microwave before adding it to the skillet, or I might try a can of whole berry cranberry sauce. I cooked this quite a bit longer than the recipe calls for but one of my guilty secrets is that I really like my broccoli mushy. I know, not the healthiest way to eat it, but IMO the tastiest. A side note to those of you needing to use up cranberry sauce, it goes really well with curry too.

Not a fan of this. I added more vegs. and an extra clove of garlic. This did not cook as quickly as recipe stated. I liked the tang from the cranberry sauce on the vegs while hubby disliked the whole dish. I think this would have been better using round steak cut into thin strips.
