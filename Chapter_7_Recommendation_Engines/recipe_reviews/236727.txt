I made this exactly as written (except for the malt vinegar, which I did not have on hand) and it was devoured by four picky eaters, all with different tastes! The dish was easy to make, and although the spices and ingredients don't sound like they'd go together -- they do! The sauce was thick, rich and creamy, the chicken tender and juicy. I took the breasts out to shred, gave the sauce a good stir, and then placed the shredded chicken back into the crockpot on low while I made the pasta and side dish (green beans with grape tomatoes in a touch of Italian dressing). Thank goodness -- a new staple that every one can agree on! Thanks!

I have to agree, you don't think these spices would work, but it totally does! Followed this recipe by the book, and it turned out perfect. The whole family loved it!

This is actually, the first review (regarding a recipe) I've ever written. They say "Don't judge a book by it's cover", but in this case, I really should have! I FOLLOWED IT TO A T!!!! I eventually had to skim out all (of what I could) the sauce. It was sooooo BITTER! I'm assuming, it was the Italian dressing, and I LOVE Italian dressing! (I could literally drink it!!) I did, however; leave out the malt vinegar (simply because I had none on hand) and that might have ACTUALLY worked in my benefit. Anyways, hope this helps, but I will NOT EVER be making this again.

Made this last night and it was very good and thanx OBXcat!  I left out the malt vinegar and used 8 boneless/skinless thighs instead of the breasts.  I made a casserole with it using egg noodles. 2 hours on "high" and 2 hours on "low" was perfect. Wife said a bit salty but delicious (she has her own salt-lick) so it was a bit much for me (but still edible) and still good. Also used 2 cans mushroom soup.  Next time will use thighs again and use 2 cans of low sodium soup.  Will also delete the tsp salt as I believe there is enough in the salad dressing (salt is one thing that you can always add on your plate for those with salt-lick fetishes).  This is a keeper as noted and hope you may find this helpful.

Made this recipe as written except I cooked it  3 hours on high in the crockpot because of time.  Turned out great!  Sauce is wonderful. Thanks for this deliciously easy recipe.

Omit the salt. Everything else has salt already in it, the soup, the dressing, the parmesan, etc. We found it waaaaay too salty. But the flavors were really yummy. Instead of the malt vinegar I used a bit of prepared balsamic vinegar dressing along with the Italian (I used zesty Italian) and instead of breasts I used boneless, skinless thighs. I don't think chicken breasts belong in the slow cooker. I would definitely make it again without the salt.

When I first read this recipe, I thought the spices on the chicken were a very odd combo. This made me think this dish would be either amazing or terrible. It was amazing! The only change I made (accidentally) was I used cayenne pepper instead of peprika (whooops!), which gave it a really good kick. It was tamed down by the sauce and the pasta, so it wasn't overwhelming (this is coming from someone with a low tolerance to spicy foods!). Very very yummy!

I used 1.25 lbs of chicken tenderloin cooked on low for about 4 hours.  I also left out the vinegar,  and like someone else said, I used red pepper instead of paprika. I tasted it before cooking the noodles and opted for burritos instead since it was a pretty thick mixture. It turned out wonderful! Perfect chicken burrito!  Added a little more sour cream and shredded cheese, and my 7 year old picky eater said it was TERRIFIC.  Great recipe!

AMAZING!!! So delicious!!! I followed the recipe just left out the malt vinegar and it was superb! My husband and 6 yr old son loved it too! Husband said it was like fine dinning. I put it over linguine as that's what I had. Topped it with some more Parmesan...perfect. Will be making again and again! Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic!! I made it for the 1st time yesterday, and it turned out just great. The spice combination, while different, tastes wonderful. I forgot to add the cheese, but the chicken and gravy still tasted great. I didn't have the malt vinegar, but that didn't matter.  I followed what one of the other readers said, and cooked this on High for 2 hours, and then on Low for two hours. The chicken was easy to pull apart. I made this with 1.82 # of chicken, with the whole can of soup, and there was just enough gravy for the chicken. If I made this with more chicken, I would probably add more soup than what the recipe called for. Thank you for such a wonderful and easy recipe! Maggie162

Made this for dinner last night.  Used 4 thawed chicken breasts on high for 3 hours.  It totally pulled right apart!  Nice and moist! Kept the sauce on the side to spoon over pulled chicken and egg noodles. Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe

We were not crazy about this dish.  I used package of Wishbone Italian dressing & seasoning mix.  The recipe did not say but I assume it was the dry mix and not the bottled dressing and the package did not say if it was 6 oz.   Would someone let me know if this was correct?   

I did not have malt vinegar but several people said they did not use it.  To me the sauce tasted very sweet so after it had cooked a bit and still tasted sweet, I added small amount of cider vinegar.  When my 13 year old daughter tried it, she said it reminded her of a creamy tortilla soup with vinegar.   The sauce almost reminded me of a creamy tomato soup but there was no tomato in it.  

If I used the wrong amount of Italian dressing, I will try it again but otherwise it was not for us.

Tried this yesterday and to be honest when mixing it together I thought I would need to get a pizza cause it did not look like it would be that good. Came home and it smelled wonderful. Only difference I made is using Macaroni noodles because I was out of Angel hair. The kids and hubby devoured it! I think I will stick with Macaroni noodles instead since it just tasted great with them. Thank you for a great recipe.

It was great! Made it just like the recipe and made only one addition - right at the end ( when I was cooking the pasta) I threw in a can of mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes, drained. I like to have veggies with my pasta dishes and it added some texture as well. Great on bow tie pasta because it holds the sauce so well. Great slow cooker recipe with tons of flavor!

We really didn't like this chicken. It's similar to chicken stroganoff, but has many more ingredients. We thought it smelled kinda weird too. I definitely won't make this again.

Absolutely perfect! Made it as written except it only cooked for about 5 hours on low. The chicken was tender and very tasty. I would have paid $15 a plate at a restaurant and not batted an eye. Delicious!!!

Went directly by the recipe.  Didn't put over noodles - put over rice instead.  But it needs something else.  Did not have a good flavor at all.  Between the Italian seasoning, Italian dressing and the cumin, they didn't taste good. Maybe the cumin with Italian dressing?  The recipe tasted like something went wrong and it trying to correct itself.

I only gave this a 3 star because my husband loved it.  I disliked it.  I think it was the malt vinegar.   I want to make it again without the malt vinegar and will give an update then.  Malt vinegar is such a strong flavor it was too much.

This was exceptional! I usually try the recipe as is at first, but unfortunately I didn't have all the ingredients so this is what I used,  chicken thighs (boneless), cream of celery soup and yogurt instead of sour cream.  It was great!  I threw it over some left over rice and the whole family pretty much licked their plates!  Even my pickiest eater, the 4yo. cleaned his plate!

This was a horrible recipe. I followed the recipe as written except for cutting back to 1/2 teaspoon cumin based on another reviewer's comments and I omitted the optional malt vinegar.

It surprisingly worked well when noodles were added to it, along with peas. I don't think I will make this again. My boyfriend does like this dish though, and says it smells good.

This thing is amazing. Followed the recipe to a T and it's come out awesome every time. I've dubbed it unceremoniously as Trashcan Chicken due to the amount of ingredients.

This was great! Very easy and family liked it! Didn't use malt vinegar. Forgot the Parmesan in slow cooker so instead mixed with butter and noodles. Used egg noodles. Thank you for recipe!

Here's the deal. This dish was very tasty and the chicken breasts came out very moist and incredibly tender. I mixed the seasonings and rubbed *some* on each breast. I did not use all of the mix. I did not add the malt vinegar. I used Italian salad dressing from a kit, but mixed it up with oil and vinegar before adding to dish. The seasonings have a very strong smell at the start, but their flavor get muted in the final dish. I thought it would taste of cumin, but the seasonings only added complexity to the flavor- none dominated. I would definitely make this again.

Picture 4 adults fighting the the last of the gravy and chicken bits.  It's not a pretty sight but, like addicts with no fix in sight, that' show we were with this recipe.  Deeelicious!

Made for dinner last night. Just the two of us eating, so there was plenty left over. It was so amazing that my husband expressed how angry he would be if he gets home from work tomorrow and there are no left overs. Made it exactly as written, except for sea salt (none on hand) used regular. Added a little mozzarella, mixed all pasta  and sauce together served with green beans on side. Next time will add extra chicken though. This chicken really does melt in your mouth. Awesome flavors. Definitely a new staple. Wish I would have took pic. No time. Midnight worker/new mom.  Looks good and tasted better!

Your choice on Italian dressing matters, choose a sweet one! Newman's Own lent this dish an odd and bitter after taste. Going into it, the sauce did not taste good. however once cooked it was better. Probably not a repeat.

Next time I make this I will do egg noodles or something besides the angel hair pasta! Gravy is too heavy for that tender a pasta! Needs one that is more substantial. I think egg noodles or elbow macaroni would fair better!

I made this tonight, the only thing I did different was the chicken marinated overnight in a ziploc bag due to a schedule conflict. I did everything else to a "T" and it was ahhhmazing!!! Seriously, while making it, I was afraid to try it, but it was so very good. And my husband and 16 year old son were so impressed with it! My son's words were "This is so unique and delicious! Great job Mom!" Uh, wow! :))

Kind of like many other reviews I started looking at the ingredients and thinking that they didn't go together, however it was good. I enjoyed the meal. There were four of us and the responses ranged from "it's ok" to "yes, I like it." Since I was one who liked it I gave it a 4 star.  Another positive note is that it is really easy to make.

It was okay, I advise half the Cumin because that’s all we could taste. After a day in the fridge it mellowed out quite a bit. I would also add more fluid it was pretty pasty. But overall it’s a good dish

This was melt in your mouth chicken!  I followed the recipe to the tee.  I have a steamer dish with my slow cooker, so I mixed in steamed broccoli 45 minutes to the end.  When I make it again, I will leave out the salt.  All in all, great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

My whole family loves this. Tasty, yet mild, yet flavorful! It doesn’t overwhelm the picky eaters and it still satisfies the grown-up palate! I make it exactly to the recipe. YUM. Makes a good amount of sauce.

Awesome! My kids couldn’t have enough! I already defrosted pork chunks, so I thought “what the heck. Porks the other white meat.” Turned out great. Followed the prep instructions as if it were chicken. No malt vinegar, so tried it with a splash of rice vinegar. No Italian seasoning too, so hoped the Italian dressing would suffice. Added some frozen corn when it was time to shred the pork. Served it over rice, with blanched brocolli and roasted potatoes and it was delicious!!!  Will have to try it with chicken next time.

I highly recommend this recipe. My boyfriend prefers chicken breasts, however my children and I prefer chicken thighs. Even though I had a mixture of chicken it came out fantastic and highly recommend.  Same time (I put the chickens together).

I used dark meet because it was what I had on hand. My husband loved his dish. He could not stop raving about it. If I make it again,  I would probably  cut back the pepper to 1/2 tsp. Also, the Parmesan was not identifiable. I think the Italian dressing overtook it.  Overall, it still tasted delicious.

I doubled the recipe while camping for the 4th of July weekend. I was able to assemble the items in the crock pot in the morning, enjoy the family that was visiting for the day, and it took another 5 minutes to pull the chicken apart. The longest time was boiling of the water and noodles! EVERYONE loved the meal. Our son took a doggie bag home for a late night meal and texted me that this was one of the best meals I made and to put it on the 'make again' list!

My 15 year old said, "mom...this is the best!" I had very little in the cupboard, but I had most everything for this so I gave it a shot. I was very skeptical of the Italian dressing, but it added a nice flavor. I used a dry Italian mix, made according to the directions, instead of bottle dressing. I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom because it was all I had. I also substituted mozzarella cheese. I altered the ingredients only because of what I had in the kitchen. My completed dish stuck fairly close to the original recipe.

I hate to rate any recipe low but, honestly, we did not like this much at all.  I followed the recipe exactly as written but it had very little flavor and no color.  We tried to eat it but was not enjoying it.  I'm not sure what to do to fix it to our liking but for us, it certainly needs more flavor.

I used the malt vinegar the first time, but left it out when making this again. I think the Italian dressing is really enough vinegar and malt vinegar isn't really a sub for wine, which imparts a different taste.  Also, served it over rice, to a picky eater and two semi-final picky eater teenagers. They all loved it. It's becoming a regular dish.

My family loved this!  After reading the other reviews, I took the advice of not adding the salt. I mixed the dry spices in a pie dish, and pressed the chicken into it to coat the chicken well. I also added some thinly sliced onion and mushrooms to the bottom of the cooker before I laid the chicken down. I did not have Italian salad dressing, so I used my Ceaser dressing, but only used half a cup rather than the three fourths cup called for. All in all, the flavors mixed very well - I did not use the vinager but wine instead. Next time I would consider a bit of lemon juice.  This was well worth the minimum effort, we served it over  bow tie pasta with a salad and bread, yum!

At first glance, these ingredients don't appear to go well together. Sadly, that was the case in the finished dish. We felt it tasted like a pretty strange mash-up of random ingredients that just didn't come together.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I was looking for something different to make in the slow cooker.   I did not add any salt or the malt vinegar and the chicken was moist.  However, after reading the fat content of the dressing, cheese, soup and sour cream this will be a sometimes dish in our house.

Made this today. It was a big hit. Delicious! Only change was cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and rice flour instead of white flour. Highly recommend this.

I have made this several times. I use Kosher salt and cream of chicken soup. I don't use the vinegar. And I also use Rotini noodles (spiral noodles). Turns out great every time. The kids love it!

Good. Thanks to other reviewers to say make it in a 13x9. Good call. Use 5 eggs and ¾ cup half & half or something. Add salt & pepper to the egg mixture and maybe some salt to the pots, I mean potatoes. Add vibes & red pepper. I don't like crispy hash browns (who does?), so cook it according to the recipe times. More butter is always good, yes? Double the cheese & ham. Solid dish.

This has become my favorite recipe! I made quite a few substitutions and omissions the very first time I made it, including cream of tomato instead of cream of mushroom. Still, it was fantastic. So if, like me, you're too lazy to drag your  to the store to get what you don't have, you might get by. I've made this twice more since then, following the recipe closer each time. Go find malt vinegar—it's worth it!

Chicken tenders also work. Just back off the cooking time by an hour.

I agree with some of the reviews. It is plenty salty without adding any. Very tasty. Big hit. I might add some peas or mixed vegetables next time but it's not like it was lacking. Definitely a do-over.

OMG , definitely goin on my favorites list, concerned like others about the ingredient combo but very pleased with the sauce.did not use vinegar. I'm a big fan of portobello mushrooms so I'll probably add some next, maybe even peas or another veggie as I love the meal in a pot recipes. Only thing I'd change is a little less salt & that's just for my husbands tastes not mine. Cannot imagine what went wrong on any bad reviews this has gotten. I doubled  mine to send some to my daughter & was worried about never having made this before but she is goin to looooooove this.

I was leery of this at first, but it is really good and it packs really well for work as well. If you're debating about making this, it's worth the try, especially for being a budget meal. Has a lot of taste, and makes a lot of food. :)

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious! Actually the first time I've made boneless skinless chicken breasts in the slow cooker that they didn't come out dry.  Very moist and flavorful. Served it over spaghetti.

Good flavor and lots of ways to add/subtract to it to make it better. Like many other reviewers commented, it's too salty and I love salt. After adjusting for that, it's really good and super tender.

This recipe was so delicious, it inspired me to sign up for an account so I could write a review.  I've run through a streak of underwhelming crockpot recipes lately and was so surprised by how this turned out that it renewed my faith in my crockpot capabilities.  The spices blended so well with the sauce, the chicken shredded like butter.   The only changes I made were adding some parmesan cheese to the spices to coat the chicken with, and I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  It was fun, quick and easy to make and it passed the kid taste test.  I'll definitely be making this dish again.

I made this  last night, so good! I was a little skeptical because the combo of italian dressing and cream of mushroom sounded odd to me,  but after reading reviews i thought  I'd  try it. Used 6 chicken breast instead of 3 but didnt double the dry spices, and actually only used 1/2 tsp of salt. I did double the sour cream and italian dressing  but not the soup, and didn't use vinegar at all, only because I used what I had on hand. Also didn't  have cream of mushroom so I used cream  of chicken and added a small can of chopped mushrooms. It came out great! I think I like the idea of the chopped mushrooms better then just the soup, but could still use cream of mushroom soup and chopped mushrooms too! I think next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will try that. I will also just mix all ingredients  in the crockpot together first, dry and wet, and then just add the chicken. I used the same bowl for wet ingredients as I did for dry after seasoning the chicken. I figured this would pick up the seasoning I didnt get on the chicken, and not add more dishes. Which then made me realize rather then using an extra bowl at all, I could have just put it all in the crockpot together. I dont  think this would change the flavor. We put it over wheat pasta and it was great! I think if I doubled the spices it would have been even better though. Def give it a try!!

This was great! The dry spice rub was a nice combination and flavored the chicken well. I subbed out with cream of chicken and didn't have any Italian dressing so I used balsamic vinaigrette. I will use Italian dressing next time to see if there is a huge difference, but it was delicious either way.

Too much Italian dressing, too heavy on the seasonings. It was also way too much sauce for the amount of chicken and pasta listed.

Wow!  What a great way to dress up the humble and bland chicken breast!  So easy and delicious.  I, like others, did not use the malt vinegar...I just thought there would be enough acid in the dish with the salad dressing and sour cream.  I think next time I'll try it with penne pasta, since angel hair tends to clump together a bit.  Thank you so much for the recipe

My dyslexia and lack of attention to detail caused me to use Thousand Island dressing instead of Italian dressing! However, it still turned out tender and delicious.  It probably isn't fair for me to rate it a "4" without using the proper ingredients, but, I'll be sure to try it next time!  What I love most is the ease of this recipe.  Throw it together, put in crock pot, and go.  Very little prep.  Other than the dressing mishap, I didn't alter the ingredients or prep, with the exception of the malt vinegar.  Because I didn't have it on hand, I used 1 tsp of balsamic vinegar instead.  I put it on linguine noodles instead (because I thought thicker noodles suited it better).

This was so easy to make; husband said, "Really good!".  My son devoured two servings.  I did not add the Italian seasoning as it is too strong for me and I used wine instead of the vinegar.  Next time I will add some chopped mushrooms.  It is a keeper!

This recipe was delicious!  As others have stated, the spices seemed like a weird mix, but were delicious!  The only changes I made were I had some buttermilk on hand, so the night before I made this, I marinated the chicken breasts overnight in the buttermilk.  This made the chicken so tender!  Also, I used 1/4 cup white wine instead of malt vinegar.  I elected to serve mine over rice that I had cooked with a chicken stockpot.  My daughter and I loved it!  Will absolutely make this soon again!

I really didn't like this very much....wayyyyyyyy too twangy....I think if i ever did this again i would not add so much italian dressing, as thats the only thing i could think that was giving this recipe that twanginess. Would say that the chicken did fall right apart.....maybe a little bit more parmesan would have helped....not sure

Very tasty; loved the texture!
However, I've been trying to lower my meat to starch/vegetable ratio (a la Asian cuisine). Thought from the start this would be better at twice the volume of spaghetti to chicken/sauce. Much better, and way less fat -- always better -- than the original.
Also will add a small can of mushrooms next time.
Good job OBXcat -- see you at the shore!

I made this exactly as indicated and it was pretty good.  But, like others have said, dang if it doesn't taste just like stroganoff -which requires way fewer ingredients. Tasty, but I prob won't make again.

Very tasty IF you like things spicy! Used zesty Italian dressing as it was all I had on hand, that might have added an extra zip to this dish. Like other reviewers, I did find it a bit salty (and I like things salty!) would reduce or leave out the salt next time. Sauce was thick but it can be thinned with extra sour cream or milk. Recipe could easily be tweaked with addition of sliced mushrooms, white wine etc. Easy to prepare, delicious over rice or pasta!

Made this recipe as written except used rice vinegar because I didn't have malt vinegar.  It was excellent, easy to put together and served it over buttered egg noodles. Absolutely no complaints when I served it everyone wanted seconds and guests wanted the recipe. Kudos to OBXcat!

We tried this tonight. Very tasty, however we found it too salty and that 6 hours  must be on low or it will dry out.
May try a different noodle next time and make those changes.

This was a triumph with my picker eater.  He is 11 and loved it. Everybody liked it. Thanks to all the previous reviews that said the recipe appealed to picky kids - it did, it does, and is now in my own recipe collection - at least until he gets out of high school. Thanks!

My husband and I loved this dish! The taste was flavorful and the chicken was soft, moist, and yummy. Like other reviewers said it did taste salty (which I don't mind but my husband does) so next time I will omit the salt and use low-sodium soup. We also served ours over steamed broccoli so that definitely made the dish taste less salty. My sauce was thick so I also added milk to thin it out a bit like OBXcat suggested. Also I didn't have malt vinegar on hand so I left it out. My husband has already requested that I make it again (and we just had it for the first time last night). That's always a good sign. Thanks OBXcat! Great recipe that's sure to added to the regular rotation in our house!

This was delicious and my hubby loved it too! His words were "I want you to make this a lot" haha. I found it a little on the salty side so I might get the low sodium soup next time and skip the sea salt since I'm trying to be healthy anyway. Great recipe!

I too, thought the spices wouldn't work, but it tastes and smells delicious.  I do not like cream of mushroom, so I substituted golden mushroom instead.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and will be making it again!

Very good! Chicken was moist and flavorful, just as the reviewers said. I used 3 breasts totalling 1.25lbs...next time I might go for 1.5lbs. Followed the recipe exactly (used Cream of Chicken Soup) except cooked on HIGH for 3 hours as my time was short.

Followed this recipe exactly except for the malt vinegar which I didn't have on hand. Shredding the chicken required little more than stirring it around in the slow cooker with a fork because it was so tender and falling apart. Absolutely delicious! Will definitely make this again for an easy, tasty weeknight meal!

I should've taken a pic of this but forgot!! And let me tell you, it's fully worthy of a pic!! This is yummy comfort food that's rib stickin, too!! I was a little hesitant because of the italian spices, they just don't appeal to me all that much but this is just good. I followed it exactly and it turned out great. I'm sure I'll be hit up to make this again and again. Maybe next time I'll even snap a pic. LOL
