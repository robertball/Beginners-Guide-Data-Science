I used the comments of others, and used this recipe as a base.  I was making this for my children (and I am partial to the bright yellow, very sweet kind myself).  So ... I used 1/4 c. yellow mustard, 1/2 cup of honey, and only 1/2 c. of mayonnaise.  It was PERFECT!

I used 1 cup mayo, 1/2 cup mustard, 1/4 cup light corn syrup, 1/2 cup honey and 1 TBLS dried onion flakes...very tasty and will make this again.  Love dipping my french fries or "breaded chicken fingers" (also found on this site) in this sauce.

When Hubs and I are in Naples, FL,  we like to fully take advantage of Stone Crab Claw season which runs from Oct.-May.  We love the mustard sauce they're served with but when we stay in and eat them I now know I can make a darn good mustard sauce of my own with this recipe.  No criticism of the recipe, necessarily, that our preference was with a little less mayonnaise and honey - I reduced the amount of both by about 1/3, along with adding just a dash of Worcestershire to give it a rounded depth of flavor. Ex -cell-ent. And a darned shame we're  at the tail end of the Stone Crab Claw season.

I'm rating this recipe a 4 star for only the idea of all 3 ingredients put together.  I did take the advice of another reviewer, because it just seemed like there would be way too much mayo in the original, and I didn't want it to come out tasting too much like mayo.  I used 1/4 c. regular yellow mustard, 1/2 c. honey and 1/2 c. mayo.  Came out perfect.  :o)

Exactly what I was looking for: a sweet honey mustard that's the next best thing to restaurant quality. I prefer sweet honey mustard dressings/dips to the heavily mustard based kind, and this one is perfect. I did, however, feel the receipe as written was a little too mayonnaise-y. I added a few extra tablespoons of mustard and honey (tasting all the way) until I got to more of what I had in mind. I will definitely make this again.

This seemed to have too much mayo and being that I almost never follow a recipe exactly anyway, I played with it until I got what I was looking for. I started with a honey mustard and then added the mayo a little at a time until it looked right. I then added in my honey and just kept tasting along the way. The end result was really wonderful and I served this with fried cheddar cheese sticks. Thanks Nanci!

This sauce was okay, but way too much mayo.  Half or Third the mayo for much better texture and taste. Udate: I tried Honey Mustard Dressing II from this site and found that the ratios listed were perfect!

Good sauce.  Mine had a strong mayo taste.  ( I guess it depends on what brand you use.)  Never the less...I enjoyed this with the breaded chicken fingers on this site.  Very versatile too!

Very good but the mayo is off. I use 1 cup and it still seamed a little heavy on the mayo.

This is so yummy. I didn't have dijon mustard, all I had was course ground mustard and it still turned out great. It was the only thing I changed. I used it on hamburger buns for the chicken jack sandwich recipe from this site. Thanks!

This is almost like the honey mustard sauce at Chili's restaurant. They use 1/2 cup of each of the ingredients mentioned in this recipe.

Wow - the previous reviewer was absolutely right in that this does taste like something you would be served in a restaurant.  I think this would also make a fantastic salad dressing - but I have to figure out how to make it less thick without comprising the taste.

This is amazing!!! My favorite restaurant back in college would serve this to dip a pretzel sandwich in.  Never knew it had mayo in it! I used regular mustard and it turned out fine. Thank you SO much for the recipe.

This sauce is awesome. I reduced the mayo and added sour cream instead to make the mayo flavour less pronouced.

I confess to mixing this up to taste, but it's a great base to start. We enjoyed it with crab and was a perfect complement. I'll remember this one. Thanks

I followed this recipe exactly as written and loved it.  To me, the ratio of ingredients is right on; giving a nice balance between sweet and tangy.  I used a thick orange blossom honey which has a subtle flower flavour that was not overbearing in any way. It was a perfect compliment to breaded chicken tenders.   We enjoyed this recipe the way it is and will be using it again.

This stuff is the BOMB! I use regular mustard and it tastes just as fab. It goes with everything. I even use it to spice up my salad dressing: just add a few tablespoons to about 1/4 cup each of olive oil and wine vinegar. Thanks for the recipe Nanci!

I made this as a dipping sauce for Crescent Dogs for my honey loving granddaughter, but I missread the recipe.  I thought it said 1/2 cup mayo, so when I cut it down for just a small amount, I made it with 1 T. mustard and 2 T. each of the mayo and honey.  It was a little thin, but she liked it.

Way too much mayo.  I reduced the mayo by 1/2 cup and still had a strong mayo taste.  Good, but not great.

I made this in a matter of minutes. You can cut down on the mayo to cut down on fat, and it worked well with reduced fat mayo.

I thought this really tasted like mayonaise. Didn't care for it all. Made it again by one of the reviewers of using 1/4c Yellow Mustard, 1/2C Honey and 1/2c Mayo and it was sooooooooo good!

I also used this as a base for honey mustard sauce, 1st off I only made 1/2 of the recipe...based on other reviewers I also cut down the mayo I used 1/2 c. mayo, 2T. yellow mustard, 1/4 c. honey....this was DELISH! I could have drank it..made some double dipped panko breaded chicken fingers and it was amazing...had my Daughter & my 2 grand daughters to help eat them and it was agreed by all it was fantastic.

I used the ratio given by SYJohnson and it was delicious.  1 Tbl  mustard, 2 Tbl honey, 2 Tbl mayo was a perfect blend and a perfect amount for myself and my husband with some leftover for lunch tomorrow.

I scaled this down to six servings and halved the mayo, and it came out nicely.  It also meant it was family-sized instead of buffet-sized.  :)

I made this sauce to use with home made fried chicken strips. It was so delicious. My entire family loved it. Everyone remarked that it actually tasted as good, if not better than, restaurant honey mustard! I will absolutely make this exact recipe again in the future

This sauce is fantastic! I cut the recipe in half, decreased the mayo some & increased the dijon some. I thought it wsa perfect! I used it as a spread on my burger & as a dipping sauce for Spicy Sweet Potato Fries.

I reduced the mayo by 1/4 c and increased the dijon by 1/4 c and absolutely loved it!  (Perfect amount of honey.)   My kids and husband said it was better than a restaurants.  We also use it as a salad dressing, so my kids are eating more salad now.

I used this recipe to help me figure out how honey mustard (creamy looking kind) was made.  I used more mustard than called for and less mayo.  It was very, very good!  Thanks for giving me the base to make my own!!

I only had 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup mayo (thought I had more, but I didn't), so I made the recipe using 1/4 cup each of all three ingredients.  It was delicious!  I think it would have been fine with less mustard (my husband would have added more to give it more bite), but I don't think I'd add as much mayo as the recipe calls for.   We used the sauce with homemade chicken nuggets and it made a nice combination.

My daughter found this recipe a couple of months ago and we have been letting her make it.  Today, I finally got around to reading other's reviews and decided to try less mayonnaise as others have suggested.  I used 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup yellow prepared mustard (because that is all we have in the house) and 1 cup of mayonnaise.  We found this to be really good.  My son said it taste better than his sister's, which is using the ratios in the recipe. Oh, and we never let it chill, we make it as we are getting the meal ready and it it great.

Despite this sauce being mostly mayonnaise, I didn't feel the mayo taste was overwhelming. I only had a little bit of dijon mustard, so I subbed Plochman's mustard for part of the dijon called for. I wouldn't change anything about the ratios here; I think it's just perfect as written. Thanks!

I even cut this in half and this made quite a bit. I used this as a sub instead of plain dijon mustard for the Ham and Swiss Rolls also from this site. Worked out nicely.

Easy, with good flavor, but found it a little thin.  Maybe I'll try again with creamed honey rather than liquid honey.

I would give this 5 stars, but i changed the amounts a little bit for my taste.  I added along with my grainy mustard i added dijon and more honey then called for.  Was very good.  Especially on chicken strips and salad.  I added a little cayenne too.  We like a little background heat.

If you like really mayonnaisey sweet honey mustard, then this is for you. If you want the more tangy kind, look elsewhere. I like the kind that is similar to O'Charley's or Ken's Steakhouse's honey mustard sauce. I would suggest to decrease the mayo to 3/4 c. or 1 c. double the mustard and keep the honey the same or decrease to 1/3 c. I'll not be making this recipe again, but I might with my modifications. Oh and don't ruin it with Miracle Whip or similar dressings. Mayo is the only way to go.

I followed suggestions using 1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup mustard and 1/2 cup honey and that was perfect. Had the amount of too much mayo only been 1/4 or 1/2 cup too much would have probably rated this a 4 but when the ratio is off by an entire 1 cup, well, can only give a 3 star at best...

I used this on a turkey melt.  I agree with the other reviewers that it is a touch too much mayo.  Worked well after reducing the mayo..but tasty as well!  I used a coarse grain mustard.  I think I will keep on the search for the perfect honey mustard!

I followed the recipe exactly at first then wound up adding an extra tbsp of mustard since I prefer more tang in a honey mustard sauce.  (It also kept the mayo from overpowering the sauce).  Although, after keeping overnight in the fridge the flavours blended together quite nicely.  Thanks for sharing such a quick and yummy recipe.

Yum!  Never thought I could make this so easily at home, though I preferred the lower mayo to honey and mustard ratio.  I used this to make chicken salad wraps, with some diced bell pepper and cherry tomatoes.  Can't wait to make some chicken strips!

It was good. I used less mayo than called for and regular yellow mustard ( it's all I had in my fridge). Looking forward to trying other versions of this sauce.

Definitely the wrong ratios here.  Way too much mayo.  I put twice the amount of Dijon thatwas called for and it still tasted like too much mayo.

WOW....very good, especially on the Kielbasa that is fried in ginger ale, then baked.  My daughter has been using it every day on her sandwiches she takes to work, she is hooked on it.

I just made this, and OMG, yum! A cup and a half of mayo seemed like a lot, and other reviewers said the same, so I did 1 cup. Everything else was the same. And I used light mayo. So happy I found this, as most prepared kinds in the store have HFCS and other additives.

Made this using yellow mustard (all I had on hand) 3/4 cup mayo and 1/2 cup honey. Grandson thinks I'm a genius to be able to make his favorite "dunk" for his chicken nuggets. Very yummy!

Outstanding!  I served this with the Crispy Coconut Chicken Fingers from this site and it was fantastic.  I halved the recipe to 9 servings and it was perfect and was plenty for a dinner for 3, a side salad, and an entree salad.  I may have added a little more honey than called for but not much, we like it sweet.  My husband said the sauce was restaurant quality!

I used low fat mayo, store brand Dijon mustard and alfalfa honey. The honey mustard reminds me of the honey mustard sauce you can get at Arby's with their chicken strips. I made a big batch for next time I make chicken strips.

I just made this but without the mayo because my boyfriend doesen't like it, and just the dijon mustard and honey together is great! Light, tangy, and sweet. I used alfalfa honey and French's dijon mustard w/ white wine:)

EASY! My daughter made this for some popcorn chicken and loved it. It was easy to make with ing.I already had in the house. It is runny if used right away so it should be refrigerated, but the flavor is good even when it has not had time to set up.

Very good but added some southwest spicy mustard and yellow mustard in proportion with the Dijon to "kick it up a notch" and to give it a more traditional color.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have enough honey (about 1/3 c.) so added enough corn syrup to make it 1/2 c.  Just like a restaurant mustard sauce I have had.

This was very good for a homemade honey mustard sauce. I used about 1 cup of mayo (low-fat) and then upped the mustard a little in an effort to lower the fat. I think that next time I won't use so much mustard as I am not really a mustard lover. Alos, used yellow mustard rather than dijon.

Awesome!  It was just what I was looking for.  I only used 1 cup of mayo & a little more mustard.  I thought even just 1 cup of mayo made it a little to mayonaissy.  Otherwise, it was great!

This is good, but I personally wouldn't jump up and down about it. 
I'd make this again for a picnic or an easy everyday meal but if I were looking for a sauce for a special occasion/meal, I'd keep looking.

i've never been a big fan of mayonnaise but enjoy it when it's disguised in a recipe. the only changes i made were by using reduced fat mayo & adding a tad bit more dijon mustard. scaled down to 4 servings, this turned out to be a delicious dipping sauce for the breaded chicken fingers also on this website. thanks nanci!

Soooo good!  I scaled the recipe down to two servings, used french's honey dijon mustard, and used a tiny bit more of the mustard than the recipe called for.  It almost didn't make it to the fridge because I kept "checking" it!  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

Fantastic! Taste as you go along so you can make changes if you wish like I did. I ran out of dijon and used two tsp of regular robust mustard and about 1/3 cup of honey. Tasty.

Close but a little too sweet.  I think if you reduced the honey by 1/3 it would probably be right.

This recipe is great...It's simple and fool-proof. And it's also versatile. Not only did I serve it cold with chicken fingers, but I also reheated it (low heat, stovetop) and added some bacon bits to mimic a popular restaurant salad dressing (hot bacon mustard) that is no longer available. It was FANTASTIC!!! Thanks so much for sharing this! Great!!!

I found this recipe and needed it to be ready immediately for dinner before it cooled.  I used yellow mustard instead of dijon-style because I didn't have any on hand.  This sauce was the perfect addition to my chicken nuggets and salad!  Thanks for a recipe I will definitely use again.

I thought this was really great!  The chicken fingers had just come out of the oven when I thought how I would love some honey mustard sauce.  I ran to the computer and this popped up.  Only 3 ingredients and I had them all!  It didn't sit in the fridge to chill, just served it as soon as I mixed it up.  I scaled the recipe to only make 4 servings and it was perfect.  Carol

Found this a good sauce if you cut the mayo in half as everyone has suggested and use stone-ground mustard instead of Dijon, goes better with the honey.

Not being a big fan of mayo I was heistant, but this turned out close to what my local pub uses for their Cajun wedges dipping sauce. To go with the cajun (spicy) theme I added some chili powder & cayenne. Super solid dip!

like many other reviews, I used less mayo(1cup,light). I also used spicy brown mustard. We enjoy it on grilled chicken sandwiches with homemade buns. Also tasty as a dip for pretzels!
Thank you, Nanci.

YUM! This goes very well with the Famous Butter Chicken recipe! I was pleased to see that this is great for a time cruncher dressing as well, just add a splash of OJ to thin it out a bit. 
Lots of Raves at the office Pot Luck- So I told them about All Recipes!

I used a lot less mayo because it had too much of a mayo taste for our tastes.  I did like how it was thick and it complimented the homemade chicken tenders.  I would use this again.

Went with a 2-2-1 ratio with apricot honey, mayo, and yellow mustard because I didn't know how the prepared mustard would jive with the flavored honey. 
Was good, and we decided next time to spice it up a little and it will be perfect.
Thank you so much for sharing.

I will never buy honey mustard sauce again!  So easy, so tasty.  I did use 1/2 C less mayo like other reviewers suggested, and a pinch of pepper.  I used it for a chicken salad.  Delicious~~

Even half of the recipe is plenty. I did cut it also. 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup Dijon and honey. Soooo good!

Reduced recipe to 6 servings.  It had a great taste but had a wee bit strong mayo flavor for my taste buds.  I will make this again and reduce the Mayo just a tad.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I modified it quite a bit.  That's because it gave me the great idea to use dijon mustard, where many recipes call for yellow mustard.  In my recipe, I used 1/2 cup of mayo, 2 TBS honey, 2 TBS dijon mustard, 1 TBS of lemon juice and 12 drops of hot sauce.

I loved the recipe, I followed it perfectly. The honey gives it just the right amount of sweetness. Also, make sure you let it chill in the fridge it makes it more solid and perfect for dipping chicken nuggets!!!

I love this website for the variety and diversity of recipes, though I have never posted.  I love a good honey mustard sauce, but thought I should share the changes I made.  On it's own, this is very good.  However, I amped-up the flavor with 1 Tablespoon of prepared horseradish and a teaspoon of Cayenne...just a suggestion!  With chicken or fish, capers would be a tasty addition.

I used a heaping cup of mayo, and about 1/4 cup each of yellow and brown mustard (along with the called-for 1/2 cup honey). Turned out excellent!

Really good!  I used spicy brown mustard instead and added just a little bit of cayenne.  The heat makes a great offset to the sweet honey.  Other reviews are right - don't make this one too far ahead of time.  It is best soon after it is made.  Play with the measurements a little too to adjust this to your particular taste.

This is a good recipe, but a little sweet for my liking.  I added an extra tablespoon of mustard, but I think it still needs more.  I also used half mayo half lowfat yogurt so make it lower fat.  Next time, I will use less mayo/yogurt to make it more tangy, and half the recipe because it makes a lot.

I made this (actually my 5 year old made this) for dipping "The Best Ever Chicken Nuggets" and it was a delicous combination. I think he added extra honey, but it was still really good. I think you have to beat it to get the ingredients to stay together and not seperate.

Yum.  I scaled the recipe down to make just one serving, and since my chicken was already in the oven cooking, I didn't have time to refrigerate it for 2 hours.  Still it was delicious and I will be making it again.

It couldn't be simpler to make your own delicious, tasty honey mustard sauce. I'm so glad I came across this recipe. I had never been able to make a good honey mustard dipping sauce and I wasn't that fond of anything on the grocery story shelves.  I made some of the sauce and poured it over baked boneless skinless chicken breasts (after they were cooked). The resulting honey mustard chicken was very popular.

Pretty good!  I had to double the mustard (dijon) and honey as it was initially too mayo tasting.  Love the addition of lemon- it really freshens it up and gives it a nice consistency as a dressing.

Extremely simple and quite tasty.  I cut down the mayo to 1/2 cup (light mayo), used 1/2 cup of honey, and 1/4 cup of spicy brown mustard. I didn't have two hours to chill it, so I put it in the freezer while I cooked (about half an hour). It thickened right up and tasted great.  Thanks!

This recipe is definitely restaurant quality! I used 1/8 c. regular yellow mustard and 1/8 c. dijon mustard.  I thought it was the perfect combination.  I will definitely be making this sauce often!

I've been making this for several years now, and always in a smaller quantity, so I've stopped measuring.  I use yellow mustard instead of dijon.  It's delicious, perfect as a dipping sauce for chicken fingers, or used basted on boneless chicken breasts which are then baked.  It also works as a salad dressing when thinned with milk or cream.

I scaled it down and used 1/4 cup yellow mustard and 1/4 cup honey and 1/8 cup of mayo.  It worked well.  We didn't need that much, this amount worked (and tasted) perfect.

O my goodness, all the times I bought store bought only to be disappointed by the taste and THIS was here!! It's soooo EASY and tastes SOOOOO good!!!  I served this with mini crescent dogs from this site and everyone loved it!!!  My step-son, who is a honey mustard connoisseur, kept dipping his finger in it..lol.  It makes quite a bit, so you could even half this recipe.  THANKS SO MUCH! :)

I wanted to make a dip like the on that goes on "Malibu Chicken" at Sizzler.  I didn't want it to taste too strong of mayo, so I only used half as much.  As a result, the sauce was more runny than it may have been...but the flavor was good.

Great sauce! I do reduce the mayo down to 1 cup if I use it for a dipping sauce. When I want a honey mustard salad dressing, I only use 1/2 cup of mayo.

This was a very simple and easy recipe. The taste is awesome and just what I was looking for. It tastes like White Castle Honey Mustard Sauce. I used Fat Free Mayo (that's all I had) and it still came out good. Great Recipe!

This was great.  Added an extra squirt of dijon mustard cuz i like the mustard taste to stand out more than the honey. Thanks for the recipe.

Very simple and delicious. Versatile, too - as you can make it with either Dijon-style or yellow mustard, depending on what you are in the mood for. Great for using as a dip, salad dressing or marinade. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  Made a half recipe and added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  Made it to go with chicken finger but tossed some roasted potatoes in it too.  Very yummy.

I used plain, non-fat yogurt in place of the mayo so that it would be a healthier choice.  I will be serving it with oat and herb encrusted turkey (from this site).  It was great when I sampled it so I can't wait to try it on the chicken (we didn't have turkey).

I thought this was good, but not great. I made it to go with pigs in a blanket and also served bbq sauce and ketchup and most people opted for the bbq sauce over this. This makes quite a bit.

Made this to go with "Mini Crescent Dogs" and it was perfect!  I am so glad that I chose this recipe other others that were more complicated and called for way more ingredients.

Great, classic honey mustard sauce.  I found it a little sweet for what I was looking for -- next time, I may try adding some herbs and red pepper, and maybe even experiment with a spicy brown mustard in place of the dijon.  A great quick recipe to build from!

This was so good! Nice and easy too. I think I will use light mayo next time as I don't think it will affect the flavor. I may try it as a salad dressing as well.

i scaled this down to 3 servings and used regular mustard instead of dijon since i didn't have any. i also used lowfat mayo and didn't refrigerate for 2 hours. i would have added a little less mustard since i used regular, but added more mayo to make up for it. in the end it was delicious!

This was a last minute idea to add to the Baked Chicken Nuggets that I also got from allrecipes & it was one of the best Honey Mustard's I have had. This will definatley become a regular around our house.

This was perfect, not too sweet, not too mayo'y and not too spicy!  I halved the recipe and used French's bold and spicy brown mustard.  I added some to dh's plate to force him to try it since he doesn't care for honey mustard, he went back for the whole bowl.  My daughters even loved it!  A true keeper!

This was ok. I made half the portion though, and even that was enough for 15 people. Don't make the whole batch unless you plan to save it. It was a tad to mayo-y for me, but I didn't want to add too much mustard because it was spicy.

I scaled this to 9 servings. Used 1 T. dijon & 1 T. regular mustard. I also added more mayo to make it a lighter yellow. It's great with coconut chicken strips from Central Market's deli case!!

I made this when I ran out of dressing for my salad and didn't want to go to the store.  It makes a great salad dressing.  I used regular mustard, since I didn't have dijon, and it came out creamy and tangy and perfect!  So easy, too, I'm never buying a bottle of honey mustard dressing again, and can't wait to use it in other recipes!

This was good, but a little sweet.  That may have had something to do with the mustard that I used.  I added some yellow mustard to add a little more zip.  My husband really liked this.  I will be making it often!

I added 1 tsp. of prepared yellow mustard to give more color and tang.  Great on toasted turkey subs!!  Much better than the store-bought honey mustard!  Will definitely use again!!

This sauce is terrific!!! I didn't know how easy it could be to make. Kids and hubby LOVED it! I did use both dijon and yellow mustard(adds brightness to the sauce.) and a little less mayo. I have used it on chicken breasts,grilled then served with them. Thank you so much!

My 11yr old son found this recipe and he made it for the family.  We have been using it since. I haven't bought honey mustard in months.  I put it in a squeeze bottle and labeled it.  We refill at least once a week.

Very good base honey mustard.  I eyeballed the measurements and added juice of a lemon and a couple splashed of white wine vinegar. I made this with the breaded chicken fingers from this site on top of a romaine lettuce, cukes, red pepper, tomatoes, and green onions.  Big hit with the family.

Good basic recipe, but everyone has their personal preference. I changed it a bit too and found the following combination worked for me: 1 part yellow mustard, 1 part brown mustard (I used Jack Daniels Old No. 7), 1 1/2 parts honey, and 3 parts mayo (I used Miracle Whip) Its ready as soon as you're done mixing it, you don't need to refridgerate it. Yum!

Loved this but did make changes based on suggestions of others - used half the mayo, used both yellow and brown spicy mustard.  Great with chicken fingers.

This was excellent!  Only changes I made was less mayo, more honey and didn't have dijon mustard, so I used the spicy brown mustard I had in the fridge and didn't refridgerate for 2 hours and it was think enough. My husband isn't big on honey mustard, but he loved it too!
Thanks!!

This is a good base, although I feel like it calls for way too much mayo.  I cut it back to just over a 1/2 cup, mainly because I like more of a honey taste, and felt this took away from the sauce.  I also added a bit of brown sugar.  Will use again, but not before figuring out what this needs!

This sauce is really good.  I made it with the Famous Butter Chicken and was really impressed.  It made quite a lot and really added to the flavor of the chicken.  We'll definately make this again

This is the best honey mustard I have ever had. So creamy and delicious. I took others recommendations and made it with the Famous Butter Chicken on this site and it was a match made in heaven! I will never buy store bought HM again!

This sauce was amazing along with the "famous butter chicken" recipe. It's definitely something we'll be making often. It even works nicely if you use regular mustard as a substitute for Dijon.

This recipe is very quick, easy and reduces servings well. I made the dip and served it 5 minutes later and it tasted great, so I don't think it is necessary to chill it for 2 hours. I will definately make this again! :)

This is the best honey mustard sauce I've found...and I've tried everything!!  It spiced up salads, sandwiches, and chicken.
