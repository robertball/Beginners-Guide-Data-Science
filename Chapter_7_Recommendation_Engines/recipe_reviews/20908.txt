We absolutely loved this recipe and made a small change...we rolled it in a paprika, chili flake, and parmesan cheese mix to give it a little extra kick and brighter look

I made this cheese ball for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was a HUGE hit! I even substituted Neuf-chatel for the cream cheese and it still worked out wonderfully!  My niece, (who is a chef) commented, "I won't be a bit offended if this shows up again at Christmas!"

I was only looking for a white cheeseball recipe so I could make it into an igloo for my cream cheese and black olive penguins (from this site).  What I found was a very tasty, and easy to make success. I was a bit leery about the "too salty" comments, but I believe that I resolved that when I added an outer layer of whipped cream cheese to cover up the flecking from the ranch dressing. The extra cream cheese seemed to take away some of the saltiness. This cheeseball was a big hit with my family and much easier to make than my usual one. Thank you so very much for posting this wonderful addition to AR.

Great recipe. I used a stone ground mustard, and used 2tbsp instead of one.  Had extra cream cheese on hand, due to other reviews about it being too salty, but didnt find it to be overwhelming at all...and I hate salt. My family attacked this cheeseball. Definitely will make this again. :-)

My company loved this.  For my taste it was a bit salty.  I would add less than 1 packet of ranch mix next time.

Yummy- and super easy!  This made a HUGE cheese ball- we had half of one left.  It was a little salty, for some reason, but the next day, it tasted awesome- tastes good with crackers, or REALLY yummy with pretzels.  I also rolled mine in parm cheese, paprika, and some Mrs Dash- to give it some color- it was beautiful.

This was really flavorful and delicious.  I halved the recipe as it was only for 4 people and it was the perfect amount. Rolled it in crushed goldfish crackers for color (Halloween) and crunch.

It was kind of flavorless the day I made it and after it sat overnight in the fridge the Ranch dressing mix flavor was overpowering.  I won't make this again.

Very good cheese ball, especially if you like ranch.  One variation I tried was only putting in 1/4 cup butter, and it was still good.

I didn't have any ranch dressing mix so I added a tiny bit of Caesar dressing instead then after remembered I had onion soup mix and thought to add some of that too. It was really good. But anything with adding butter to it is. If anything I would make this again without the butter. Cheese dips are fattening enough and adding butter to it is yummy lol but shouldn't always be added. Thanks for sharing

I omitted the mustard.  I also added more garlic than called for and some Cajun seasoning.  Big hit!

In stead of using dry ranch mix I just used plain ranch dressing and it made it extremely creamy :)

I used one pressed garlic clove instead of the jarred minced garlic. I think this was a bit of a mistake, as the cheese ball was far too garlicky. I still liked it and everyone that ate it remarked how good it was, but whooooweeeee--the breath!!! I would definitely make it again, but use the jarred kind of garlic to make it a little milder.
