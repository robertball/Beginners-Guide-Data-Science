I'm not sure where this went wrong but it was no where near the consistency to be rolled into balls. I doubled the bread crumbs and added some salt & pepper and still had to used a cookie dough scoop as it was pretty wet. I had to cook them for 20- 25 minutes.  That being said, this is a great concept and I'll be trying it again.  They turned out well enough that I'm still serving them to company with a crab cake dipping sauce.
