Good recipe, but next time will cook longer before adding the soup, the crescents were soggy

Like the other review said, I baked the chicken and crescent rolls a little longer -  about 15 minutes.  Then added the chicken soup and cheddar cheese.  We thought this was good. I liked the chicken and sour cream combo.  I make the same thing after every holiday to use up the leftovers and this was good for a change.   Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out great! I would suggest using extra large rolls instead of regular sized. They turned out to be a lot smaller than expected. I also might try to add a can of cream of mushroom in next time.

I turned up the oven to 400 and didn’t quite use the whole can of soup. The crescent rolls were perfectly cooked, not soggy at all.  Quick, easy, and tasty recipe!

I cooked the crescent rolls for 10 min then added sauce and I had extra chicken that didn’t fit inside the rolls so I just sprinkled it on top with cheese. It was delicious

This was very easy. My husband and I liked this comfort food.  I completely forgot the cheese, but didn't miss it.  Make sure your chicken is well seasoned to your preferences.  We ate this with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Will definitely make this again.

Love this recipe. I have actually made several different versions. Mexican one with chicken and green enchilada sauce. One with leftover roast beef with provolone and cream of mushroom. Imagination is a wonderful thing.

I had a ton of leftover chicken to use up from an event, and this recipe was great! I did have to use cream cheese instead of sour cream, as I didn’t want to run to the grocery store. I added some Penzey’s poultry spice mix on top of the cheese as well. I followed the advice to bake the chicken and rolls longer before adding the soup. I will definitely make this again, and probably do a Cordon Bleu version of it (or maybe bacon instead of ham).

I added a small (4oz.) can of chopped green chilies. Then I baked it at 375 degrees for 15 minutes before I added the cream of chicken soup and cheese. The I baked it for another 5 minutes. Great comfort food. No leftovers.

Definite keeper for using leftover chicken. So simple. I added some leftover mushrooms to the chicken mixture. Baking the crescents for 15 with the chicken mixture is a must to avoid soggy rolls & then I followed the recipe as is. Will make again when I have leftovers.

Nice and easy -- next time I'll use half of the cheese.
