A coworker brought a dish like this to our Thanksgiving celebration at work. However, hers was crunchier so I called for her recipe after I tried this one.  Here's the difference:  She layers in a 2 qt. casserole - 3 C. fresh apple chunks with peels (I used the bag of tart sliced apples from the grocery store), 2 C. fresh cranberries, 1 1/2 C. sugar (I use Splenda).  Then tops it with a mixture of 1 1/2 C. rolled oats, 1/3 C. flour, 1 1/2 C. chopped pecans, and 1 stick melted butter or margarine.  Bake covered at 425 for 1 hour.  This has a bit fresher taste, has more crunch, and less syrupy-ness.  Both are great, but wanted to offer this version made with fresh fruit.  Enjoy!

This recipe was a big hit at the potluck I brought it to.
Next time: I'll mix the pie filling and cranberry sauce prior to putting it in the pan.  I needed to have the cranberry sauce more evenly distributed.  I might also decrease the amount of brown sugar since the dish was sweet enough from the pie filling.

YUM! This was terrific! I'm a fruit crisp fan and this was one of the best I've ever made! I used canned apples-n-cinnamon in place of just plain apple, and the cranberry gave it the PERFECT combination of flavors! I scaled the topping up and made 50% more so I'd have a little extra (I like lots of topping) and it was wonderful! I also sprinkled the topping with cinnamon before popping it in the overn. Really, really good!

I made this recipe because I was looking for something different to take to a family get together.  I told the family what I was bringing and they all hesitated.  It took no time to prepare it that morning.  Upon arrival, family members saw it and thought that it smelled great.  Everyone raved throughout dinner on how great it was and wanted me to make it again for more family events.  Tomorrow, I'm making this for a second time and I didn't have any hesitations when it got brought up for the menu.

One week after Thanksgiving and I still had homemade cranberry sauce from this site (1 c orange juice, 1 cup sugar, 1 bag cranberries). Loved that recipe so much I doubled it, so still had some left over -- maybe about 2 cups or so.  Cut fresh Gala apples -- about 4 large ones -- until the consistency looked rather like not just cranberry sauce but somehow more like pie filling -- no spices or additional sugar, then put topping on.   I loved it and will always keep this in my recipe file as I hate throwing out homemade cranberry sauce after the holiday feasting is over.  Very, very tasty. Needs no tweaking on spices at all. The fruits (in my case, apple, cranberry and orange juice) carry the recipe to perfection.

THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD AND SUPER FAST TO PUT TOGETHER. I USED WHOLE CRANBERRY SAUCE AND ADDED 1/4 TSP. CINNAMON. I CUT THE APPLES INTO SMALLER PIECES TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE, USED COMSTOCK BRAND. I WILL TRY ADDING A FRESH APPLE NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF PIE FILLING AND SEE HOW IT COMES OUT. MAYBE MAKE A CHUNKY HOMEMADE APPLE SAUCE TO USE. I WILL EXPERIMENT. THIS WAS LIKE A DESSERT AND MY HUSBAND REALLY ENJOYED IT. THANKS CHRISTINE!

I have never tried making anything like this before, but I am really pleased with how this turned out.  I followed the recipe as is, and wouldn't change a thing.  It hits the taste buds just right.  My husband hardly touched his, and didn't ask for seconds.  Oh, he said he liked it, but I could see that he lacked that little twinkle in his eye, the durned liar!  Oh well, I'm still rating this 5 stars because I enjoyed it, and that's all that matters, right?  heh heh  Thanks, Christine, for the great recipe!

This was an awesome side dish to turkey dinner. It paired perfectly with the moist turkey and salty gravy.  However, I did change things a bit. I used fresh apples cubed, fresh whole cranberries, and cut out more than half of the topping. I tossed the cranberries and apples in 1 cup of brown sugar and put them in the baking dish. I then combined about 3/4 C of oats and 1 C of chopped nuts and sprinkled them over the fruit. I placed small chunks of butter over top and baked it! Fabulous! Not too sweet and definitely not a dessert.

This was great. I've made a recipe like this without the topping and it was good, but I was the only one that ate it. I made this last night with the topping and there's none left!!! Even my b/f who hates cranberries ate some, and liked it. This was really fast and easy. I will make this again and again.

This was a great toss together and pitch into the oven for something quick, last minute and things I already had stocked in my pantry. Nice and slightly tart from the whole cranberry sauce, crisp topping from the rolled oats on top(I used thick rolled oats) and tender apples and cranberries makes me  go hmmmm. Thank for such a quick and easy recipe for any night of the week and not just for a holiday. ;-)

wow! this was really good and my roommate absolutely loved it. It was great as a sidedish and if you want to use it as a dessert just as some more brown sugar to the topping and put some into the filling to taste. Definitely will make again!

Tried this last night. Love it. Used 6 x 10 glass baking dish. Mixed apple & whole cranberry sauce together plus added 1/4 tsp Saigon cinnamon. Cut back on topping. 1 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar & 3 TBSP soft butter. Turned out  brown & crunchy. DELISH !

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I love simple recipes that take no time and this is one of those recipes.  As several other reviewers suggested, this would be great with ice cream, maybe with a little caramel drizzled on top.  I ate this casserole for breakfast this morning and it really hit the spot.  In fact, I think it would be a good breakfast casserole too!  I took this to a church dinner and one guy got 3rds!  Since it's so easy, I might make it again for Thanksgiving and I may sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon in the brown sugar and oatmeal.

I made this as a dessert, adding maybe 2T of brown sugar to the apple-cranberry mix.  It tasted really really good.  I made it in muffin tins for individual servings, but they don't like to come out very easily.  This tastes great eaten cold on a hot day.

Absolutely delish! I chopped up a pear that was on it's last leg & threw it in also. I think next time I'll just do 1/2 the topping. There was a bit much & I ended up spooning it off & munching on it while waiting for dinner ;) We ate this on our Thanksgiving turkey & had leftovers on ham steaks. YUM!!

Made a similar dish using. Granny smith apples, fresh . Mixed with the cranberry as above and have used it with a butter cake mix and butter on top. The tartness of the fresh apples is great withe cranberry. Both toppings are great, take it to church and all love it.

Made this recipe today for Thanksgiving. Followed the recipe as written.  The only thing I did differently was to broil the top for about 2 minutes for some extra crispness.  My hsuband, who doesn't like cranberry sauce, said this recipe was "kick a$$* which is the highest rating in his repertoire! This recipe will DEFINITELY be replacing the standard canned cranberry slices at my house every Thanksgiving and Christmas!!

I brought this dish several years ago and it went over well.  I was asked to make it again today but forgot exactly how I did the butter topping last time, melted or in chunks or whether it was all browned.  Question: If parts of the oatmeal topping don't get any butter will it still brown or does it look like raw otmeal?

This was soooo good! My husband & I just loved it. I did change it a little though. I didnt have a can of apple pie filling so I found a recipe online & made my own (probably healthier that way too). Also, I used organic granola instead of plain oats.

Can't see this as a Sudetenland dish but made a great dessert!  I can my own apple pie filling and I'm always looking for ways to use it other than pies. Love this!  My pie filling has cinnamon in it pus I added a bit to the topping.  Also increased the topping by a half to make it more dessert appropriate. Served it at room temp as others suggested along with vanilla ice-cream. Big hit! Great recipe!

Wow this was delicious. Now, to be fair, I did change out the apples for blueberry pie filling because, well, I love blueberries. But either way you make it, I think this would be great.

Really good! I was really wanting a fruit crisp or pie sort of thing - this was really easy to make and tasty.  Like other reviewers, i think it is better at room temperature than hot, and i think it is better as a dessert than side dish.  I added some walnuts to my serving and that totally ROCKED!  The only think that i might change - i might use fresh apples and canned apples next time - it was a little sweet, but still really really good.

Very Good, but I used fresh granny smith apples b/c the family doesn't like canned apple pie filling. I also used a mixture of cranberries and cranberry sauce.  I ate too much when it was warm. It was very good warm but it actually improves after you let it sit a while.

My boys typically do not like cranberries and they ask me to make this recipe!!  One time,I did not have the apple pie mix so I cut up some fresh apples, sauted them in butter and added cinnamon -as a substitution.  tasted fine.  Yummy - this is a keeper

I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I used comstock pie filling and a generic whole berry cranberry sauce.  Didn't have to add anything to this recipe...it was just perfect the way it is!  I'll make this again and again.  Quick and easy, too!

Try this crumb topping on a fresh baked apple pie instead of a top crust.  It is great.

Very tasty although my wife thought it was too sweet.  I used Whole Cranberry Sauce which added some nice texture and I also added a pinch of All Spice and Clove.

This recipe is so easy and it tastes great!  It is the perfect solution when you want a sidedish with fruit, but do not want anything too sweet.  The only change I made was I only used 1 c of rolled oats for the topping.

This recipe was very quick and easy to throw together.  It was a little juicy for our taste, so the next time I make it, I'll add some flour or cornstarch to thicken it up.  My 8 year old loved it and the recipe is easy enough that he could make it next time we decide to have it!

I'm not convinced this is a side dish.  I decided to treat it as a dessert, and I'm glad I did, as this is very sweet.  Tasty, but very sweet.  If you want it less sweet, try using fresh apples as opposed to apple pie filling.  Or, cut down some of the brown sugar in the topping and use regular cranberries instead of cranberry sauce from a can!  All in all, though, a nice dessert that you can make all year round since you can get these ingredients all year at the grocery store.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made one small change. I mixed the cranberry sauce and the apple pie filling together as another reviewer suggested.What a delicious dessert. I love how easy it was to throw together. I needed a dessert in a hurry and I had some cranberry sauce left so I decided to give this a try. I wouldn't change a thing when I make it next time...and I will definitely  make it again. thanks for sharing.

Served with pork roast dinner.  Big hit!  Added 1/4 cup frozen cranberries and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to apple/cranberry mixture.  Also used one more tablespoon of butter in topping.  Served at room tamp.

This turned out perfectly!  I made it for a pot luck at church.  Super easy, and there was not a spoonful left at the end of the brunch!  I'm sure that you could use canned apples instead of the pie filling.  May be a little less sugary.  Add some cinnamon to the topping!

Took previous advice and used fresh apple (instead of pie filling) and combined with cranberry sauce. Delicious and easy!

Now really; this was NOT a side dish! As an extremely easy dessert, it was great. I will keep cranberry sauce and apple pie filling on hand so I can make this quickly when needed.  Even as dessert, it's pretty sweet. Great with vanilla ice cream.

With ingredients which are easy to stock in my pantry, this is now my 'go-to' recipe when headed to a party or for a special occasion.  Friends and family rave about it once they've tasted it! I've made it using foil pans so when there's nothing leftover I can just toss it.  Although I have found it to need just a little more butter to keep the oatmeal moist.  (If the pan is wide enough, I think the juices from the fruit soak in more.) Excellent and easy!

Great, although I made some changes, but as a base recipe it works very nicely. I'm  sure it would've been really delicious as written, but I had to improvise with what I had on hand. Thank you for posting!
I mixed 1 can of apple pie filling, plus about a cup of frozen blueberries and added about a tsp of cinnamon. I mixed the butter with a couple tbsp of brown sugar, along with 3 packs of instant oatmeal, one Apple and two maple & brown sugar and then topped the fruit mixture and baked about 30 mins at 350 (my oven cooks a little on the hot side).

Great taste and so easy. I added cinnamon for an extra punch and served with whipped cream.  Slightly sweet with a little bit of tartness.

This was so easy and was a big hit for Christmas dinner.  I added the Cinnamon as some of the other reviews suggested.  It came out great.  Will definitately make it again.

This had a great taste, it was almost like the apple crisp that Hhomemade Gourmet sells minus the cranberries. Would make this again. I think it goes better as a dessert and not as a side though.

A wonderful dessert!!  My children don't really like cranberries, but they LOVED this dessert!  The only thing I did differently was added some cinnamon to the apples, and to the topping.  I also served it with some homemade vanilla ice cream...YUM YUM!  Thank you so much for the spectacular recipe!

The topping sank  and didn't look very appetising, but it tasted great.  A welcome change to the same old side dishes every holiday.

Very easy, and disappeared quickly at the pot-luck dinner.  Kind of an autumn dish... Would be great a la mode!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I've also made this and added white cheddar cheese on the top.  Makes for a really delicous flavor.  YUM!

What an fun side dish - I loved it!  My husband (who has no sweet tooth) took off most of the topping so next time I'll use less brown sugar.
