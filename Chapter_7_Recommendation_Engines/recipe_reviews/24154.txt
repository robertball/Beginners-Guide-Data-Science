This is a family favorite! The key to this recipe turning out perfect is to use the COOK and SERVE pudding. The instant pudding will not work as well. I use 24 Rhodes Dinner rolls, cut in half. I roll each piece in the dry pudding, melt the butter and brown sugar together and pour over the top. I bake mine for 35-40 minutes. YUM!

I follow this loosely. (We call this "cinnamon rolls, btw - though it's probably, techinically "monkey bread.") I tried it as written and was not happy. Read the reviews, made some changes, and love it! I sub butterscotch cook-n-serve pudding for the vanilla instant. I mix all the dry ingredients. Cut the rolls into ~4-5 pieces each, dredge through the brown sugar/cinnamon/pudding mixture and place on top of the nuts in the pan. After, I pour the rest of the dry mixture over the rolls, and pour the melted butter over all. I cover with foil and place in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I place the uncovered pan in a cold oven, then I turn the oven on to 350, and set the timer for 40 minutes. Great every time!  
(I probably would have given the original recipe, maybe a 3.5 star rating - I had really large rolls without much ooey, gooey, sticky stuff . . . A solid 5 with my tweaks . . . )

This is a very old famiy recipe of ours as well! Who the heck would make rolls like this from scratch again! Anyway.. I do make a couple of differnt changes. I use toasted almonds instead of walnuts (just personal taste) and about 3/4 box of COOK and SERVE Butterscotch pudding. Also use the Rhodes brand of frozen dinner rolls ( I put approx 16 rolls in the pan) I bake for about 40 minutes.

This is a Blue Ribbon recipe!  I followed the instructions and prepared it before going to bed last night and when I awoke this morning and baked the rolls I was facinated with the results and so was my husband.  They were the most beautiful and delicious sticky buns that I have ever had and without a doubt the easiest recipe I have ever followed.  I didn't have quite a full pkg. of frozen dough but had about half and it still turned out beautifully.  I would highly reccomend this recipe to anyone and I will be using it again and again.  Thank you Marcia for being kind enough to share it with us.

These are great caramel rolls but I believe the recipe directions are wrong. What I do is thaw out two loaves of frozen bread dough and I do not let it rise. The first loaf I tear up in pieces and drop helter skelter in a 9/13 inch pan that is well greased. I then use a hand mixer to mix all the ingredients except the brown sugar  smooth. I also use cook and serve pudding and regular butter. Do not use the instant!  It will turn out clumpy! After mixing I pour it over the dough. Then I take the second loaf and tear that up and drop that on top of the dough and pudding mixture. Then I take the brown sugar and sprinkle it over the pan of rolls. The little that stick to the top of the rolls will make a nice glaze and will also keep the moisture in the bread. Then I let it double in size and bake for 30 min. on 375. The last 10 min place foil over them so they do not get too brown or burn. When they are done line a cookie sheet with foil and put wax paper on top. Spray the wax paper with oil and lay the cookie sheet with the foil and oil wax on top of the pan and flip over. Let sit for a few minutes to let the caramel drizzle in the rolls then carefully remove the pan! Voila! Perfect caramel rolls! I am positive that to just dump the pudding on top will make it clumpy so always mix first with the butter and cinnamon. My mom has made these since I was little and now my family loves them as well!  In fact I just put a pan in the oven to rise! Everyone I know loves these rolls!

This is a long time family recipe.  We do not use instant pudding, rather the "cook and serve" vanilla pudding.  Each frozen roll is roughly an ounce, so 12 ounces of rolls is a dozen.  Follow the directions and this recipe turns out great!  LOVE IT.

These are fantastic and very easy!  I've made these a few times and they fly off the plate!  I've substituted butterscotch pudding and it was still great.  Caution....grease pan well and turn over on a big plate or a plate with edges.  A *must try* recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I was expecting this recipe to be really good after all of the reviews but it wasn't. It wasn't "sticky" at all. All of the pudding powder just sat on top. I had to pour cream cheese frosting all over it just to make it edible. I won't be making these again. Sorry

This is a fabulous recipe! I have been making it for 34 years...ever since I moved to Wisconsin. We call it "Monkey Bread" up here. I don't understand how anyone could have a flop as I have never had one and it's so darn easy! Make sure you use enough melted butter. I do a couple things differently but I don't think it should make too much of a difference. I use 18 Rhodes frozen rolls. I think cutting them in half is a good idea as the rolls can be quiet large and messy to eat...but that's the fun of it. I spray plastic wrap with Pam and cover the rolls over night. I never refriderate them...I don't see how they would rise that way. In the morning I have a beautiful, over-flowing bundt pan. Bake, and viola, perfection! I do suggest covering the pan with foil the last half of baking as the outer rolls get more dried out. Definitely use a large plate as the nut mixture accumulates on the bottom of the pan and then slides down the sides once the pan is inverted. This is a tradition on Christmas/Easter morning and a hit every single time.

AMAZING!  People at the office ask me for it once a week!  Peacans also work well instead of walnuts...

This is a very festive-looking breakfast/brunch bread that makes a big impression on guests. I make this with instant butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla, but would like to try it with the vanilla, too.

I have made this for years with a couple of changes.  I use butterscotch cook and serve pudding.  I also find that if I mix the pudding, brown sugar and melted butter together and pour it over the rolls, there are no dry pudding spots.

This is a great recipe.  They are simple and delicious.  In the winter I tend to keep my house warm so I place it by a window (barely cracked open) during the night.  This is what I make Christmas morning.  It's a special sweet treat for the kids and I don't have to slave away in the kitchen... plenty of time for that later!

I followed the recipe exact and it did not turn out like the picture.  My vanilla pudding went to the bottom and when flipping it over it looked like white cake dough.  It appeared that the dough was uncooked.  The next time I make this I will mix all the dry ingredients then add the butter to it and then pour over the dough balls.   It tasted good just looked very strange.

Been making this every Christmas morning for years. I lost my recipe and was so happy to find this one. I always use butterscotch pudding. It even taste great without the nuts. My family loves this tasty, easy recipe. Thanks so much!

I only use the cooked version of the pudding.  I prefer Butterscotsh for a better flavor and use pecans instead of walnuts.  Other options are to also add coconut ( this is very popular!), raisins or craisins, or whatever your heart desires!  Because there is a lot of sugar in the pudding mix, I only use 1/2 cup brown sugar, melted with 1/2 cup butter and a dash of vanilla.  18 - 20 frozen buns, cut in half, fills a bundt pan perfectly. For a larger crown, I have used 24 -30 in a 9 x 13" cake pan ( adjust recipe accordingly ) with great success.  Your guests will be amazed when you take fresh baked cinnamon buns out of the oven.  Because they are "pull apart" buns, it is easier to handle by cutting them in half.  Leaving them at room temperature for 15 min. Makes them easy to cut.

I made a few of these for a church bake sale.  They were awesome and so easy.  I too used Cook and Serve butterscotch pudding mix, sprinkled on top.  Melted the butter, brown sugar and pecans on stove and poured all over the top.  I also think using a round cake pan or a 9 x 9 pan with 8 or 9 rolls turns out better.  It's more ooey and gooey that way.  Flip it over when finished and not only do you have delicious rolls but fantastic presentation as well.

DELICIOUS!!!  In fact, I was inspired by this recipe, made a few changes, and won 2nd place in the Pennsylvania State Farm Show sticky bun contest!  I made my own sticky bun bread dough, filled them with brown sugar, cinnamon and pecans, and then I covered them with a cooked mixture of this recipe, but used half vanilla and half butterscotch cook and serve pudding.  Also, used pecans.  Very good!  Thanks for inspiring me!

I made this for brunch with friends, using the suggested cook & serve pudding (rather than instant) and used pecans rather than walnuts (personal preference.  It was so easy to put together the night before -- and a huge hit!

This is a good recipe.  I've made it several times.  The last time, I cut it in half (used 6 balls of frozen dough).  I used a bread loaf pan.  They turned out great.  Since there is only 2 of us, when I'd make a whole batch they would get stale too soon.  I've only had them turn out powdery once (a complaint of some others) when I didn't use enough margarine and didn't pour it over the powder.  I think this is a great recipe in its simplicity and ease.  I also make cream cheese (tofutti) frosting.  I'm vegan so I use non-dairy pudding and soy margarine.  They come out great.

Made it according to the recipe. The pudding wound up just a thick, hard crust and the roll dough isn't sweet enough. Interesting idea, just doesn't seem to work very well.

I got this recipe from a friend several years ago and every time I make them they are gone in a flash! Everyone loves them and asks for the recipe. I add raisins with the walnuts. And be sure to use the Cook and Serve pudding. My husband always says I should take a picture when I make them because they look like they were made in a bakery!

With all the reviews I was so dissappointed like another poster had the same comment. I don't know I followed exactly except I forgot the wet paper towel over it which I'm sure made a difference but these were not gooey at all very dry and clumpy as others had suggested that they use the cook and serve pudding I used what it called for and was soooo dissappointed!

GREAT & EASY! I have made other versions of this before and this one is the one I will make year after year. I did use cook and serve pudding istead of instant and I used (2) 3oz packets and I also upped the butter to a stick and a half because we like more sticky stuff on ours. Moreover, I used pecans instead of walnuts. Love this recipe!!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

I made these for breakfast one moring when my daughter and children were visiting and I have to say these are "finger licking good".  Would give them ten stars if I could.  Takes a little work but well worth it.  Thanks.

just served this for mother's day brunch. omg, so good, no really, so good. people sitting around the table kept pushing the cake platter away towards someone else, cause they couldn't stop taking another piece if it was in front of them. read the other reviews, used the butterscotch cook and serve pudding and only half the brown sugar. it was very sweet, but not overly so. the rhodes dinner rolls were great too, so easy.....

As written, it's not too fabulous.  The nut topping was very tasty though.  I need to read some of the reviews and make changes.  Loved the ease of this though, just didn't love the overall flavor.

I have made these sticky buns for 20 years and they're always gone in no time. However, over the year, I have develpoed my own twists on the recipe. I very much agree with some of the other comments who suggest using non-instant butterscotch pudding and Rhodes frozen dinner roll dough balls. I always use a stick of butter and melt it with the brown sugar until it combines. Also, using waxed paper works better than paper towel. I also remove the risen rolls from the oven while it pre-heats. VERY yummy!

My recipe is exactly like this expect is calls for
vanilla or butterscotch pudding (cook & serve not the instant) And I like it alot better.  The directions are identical. I have been making these for years.

VERY good and VERY sweet! I would give this 5 stars, only it was very sweet. I may not use as much brown sugar next time. But all in all a wonderful recipe. Thank you!

This was a failed attempt at Christmas breakfast. I followed the recipe instructions exactly (and I'm not a bad cook). We threw it away after a few bites.

The boys weren't crazy about the buns, but our Sunday School class loved them. I did not use the instant pudding and used more than 12 ounces of rolls.

Huge success!  I used Rhodes cinnamon rolls.  There are 12 in a package.  Rolled each frozen roll in the powdered 3oz cook and serve vanilla pudding mix.  Butter bundt pan, sprinkle pecans on bottom and place 6 rolls on the bottom of the pan. Then the other 6 on top of that.  Sprinkle remaining pudding powder, brown sugar and cinnamon.  Drizzle the butter and follow the rest of the recipe.  Using the cinnamon rolls was a plus.

Wow... this was SO easy and such a treat! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully! A lot of my nut topping stuck in the pan, but I used a spatula to move it to the rolls and it was fine. I made sure to pour the margarine as evenly over the dry ingredients as possible and didn't have any issues with dry powder on the sticky buns. It was PLENTY sticky too!! I think I would cut the nuts down by half since they were too much for our taste (they are good in this recipe, but they were in every bite and it seemed like too much). I used a 4 cup serving size package of sugar free instant vanilla pudding and it worked well. I will definitely give it a try with the butterscotch cook & serve next time as recommended by others. :) We served them with some cheesy scrambled eggs for a little protein. Yummy breakfast! (As a note - this was also VERY sweet, a little too sweet for me so be careful if you're sensitive to high amounts of sugar).

This is an excellent recipe.  However, I used the cook and serve pudding mix in butterscotch flavour and I used slivered almonds.  I also use butter instead of margarine.  Using the cook and serve pudding mix instead of the instant made these a lot more "sticky" and delicious!!
Thanks for the recipe.

This is the same recipe that I have used for several years! The only difference is that I use butterscotch pudding instead of the vanilla and I prefer using pecans in my baking. I strongly suggest greasing your baking dish very, very well. This is always a crowd pleaser! Enjoy!

I too had the pudding cake on the tops of the rolls, and I used 2, 1oz packs. I guess I may have used the wrong pudding... Other than that they still tasted decent. However I think I'll take the traditional route from now on.

Good, simple recipe.  I could only find a 3 lb. bag of dinner roll dough so 12 oz. is approx. 9-10 dough balls.  My husband wants me to cut the "sweet ingredients" in half next time, as he thought it was too sweet.
Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make again.

YUM! Reading the recipe, I really wasn't too sure that this was going to turn out. But it did and it's wonderful! Delicious! I did use butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla, but I am sure that either would taste great.

I was a little confused on the amount of rolls to use. My package was much bigger than 12 ounces (used Rhodes), so I weighed 12 ounces on my kitchen scale, but that turned out to be about 8 rolls (if I remember correctly). Hardly filling the bottom of my Bundt pan. Off to the reviews I went, because it didn't seem nearly enough. Ultimately, I used 14 rolls, and followed the rest of the directions. This didn't turn out well for me. It was dry in places, which leads me to believe that using fewer rolls would have been best.

My hubby and I just love these a little to much. I follow the recipe except. I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar substitute. they was very sticky and sweet enough. I will be making the again. I will try to lesson the calories by using a sugar free pudding mix next time. This is worthy of stay over company! As is. my hubby requested these for is b-day cake....go figure. Thanks, Happy Cooking

I followed the directions with the suggestion to mix the ingredients before pouring over the frozen dough, and the sugar overflowed and burned in the bottom of the oven.  Everyone's alarm was the smoke alarm!! It was a very warm and humid day and I think the rolls rose too much.

I will try this recipe again but with A LOT of changes.  I followed the recipe and looked over some of the reviews; used Cook and Serve Butterscotch pudding instead and 24 frozen Rhodes rolls.  Placed it in the cold oven overnight and woke up to it oozing all over the bottom of the oven!  Next time I'll cover it with Pam sprayed syran wrap let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I'll also only use 12 to 16 rolls.

Read reviews and used butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla and pecans instead of walnuts- it turned out good! I was even complimented on my cooking (which doesn't happen too often).  Super easy, especially since you put it all together the night before!

Been using a similar recipe for years only we use regular butterscotch pudding in it. Always delicious and easy to prepare.

this is a fabulous recipe. Tried it with butterscotch instant pudding and it was great! Gave it a caramel tasting effect.

I have been making these delicious buns for years, and the instant pudding works just fine. Thanks for reminding me to get this great recipe out and start using it again.

Perfect! I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was delicious and the texture was just the right combination of chewy, soft roll with sticky, crunchy topping. Everyone loved them.

Okay, I think I am the reason this didn't turn out.  I didn't have the right rolls and in the morning they had hardly risen at all.  I would like to try again but with a few changes, use the right rolls and probably try butterscotch pudding.  The way it was the rolls were still doughy and all of the toppings were just kind of clumped together.  My family loves my original recipe for monkey bread with the refrigerator biscuits so this was a big dissapointment.  Hopefully I can get this to turn out next time because I love the idea of making the night before and having it ready.  I will try again and hope for better.

Loved the idea of these being so easy - but they turned out dry and powdery for me.  I made it two times becuase I thought I might have done something wrong since everyone else was raving.  Will try making again but increase butter so all the different powders have enough to liquify - think would defiantely be 5 stars then.

This was super easy and really good! My only problem was I couldn't find a 12oz. package of frozen rolls only a 3lb. bag.  After rising, what I guesstimated to be 12 oz. ended up rising above my bundt pan and leaking a bit over. YIKES! Anyways, my kids and husband loved it and I brought the left overs to my sister's for Easter. Thanks!

YUM!  I was looking for a recipe that involved less work in the morning, and this one did the trick!  I used the Rapid Mix Sweet Dough recipe on this site, adapted to be gluten free, and my kids were absolutely raving.  They were so thrilled to have real, fresh, delicious sticky buns!  Thankyou!  We'll be thanking you again many Christmas mornings to come! This one is going in the holiday file!

This was really wonderful!  I have to say that it seemed way to easy and I was concerned about this recipe turning out right, but it did.  My Dad (who make his sticky buns from scratch)was very impressed by these yummy and super easy sticky buns.  This is going in my binder of recipes to make again.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe is great! Needed something quick and good for dessert tonite, so I set my oven to warm and let it heat well. Prepared recipe as set down. Put buns in oven for a good 2 hours. Dough rose great, took off paper towel, increased oven temp. to 350 F. and baked accordingly. Turned out a winner!

My son has been making this for me every Mother's Day since he was 10 years old.  Easy and fabulous.  The only difference with our recipe is that we use Butterscotch Pudding mix.  Oh, and sometimes pecans instead of walnuts.

This is almost the same as my recipe. I use butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla. It will have a wonderful caramel flavor. So good when you have house guests and you want to make something special for breakfast.

I love this recipe, especially with overnight guests!  You MUST try this recipe using "cook and serve" butterscotch pudding in place of the instant vanilla pudding.  It creates such a smooth caramel-ly sauce!

These were very good, but as they cooled, the "goo" got hard and chewy.  Not sure if it was supposed to do that or not.  I followed the recipe exact except for using the cook type pudding as suggested. They tasted excellent, but just had to eat them fast.

These turned out really yummy and was super easy.  The only changes was I added raisins and used 1 box of vanilla and 1 box of butterscotch pudding.  Next time I will use less butter, sugar and pudding (a little too sweet) for me.  This is a definite do again!

Oh my gosh, this was incredible!  I could have eaten the entire pan!  I'm not sure why the person said to cover it in a wet paper towel all night, but I followed all directions and it turned out SO GOOD.  It's just delicious - I'll be making this again and again!  I followed everyone's advice and bought the Jello Cook and Serve Butterscotch pudding.  I accidentally got the fat free kind and it tasted great.  PERFECT recipe!

Very good and extremely easy.  My family ate them up and asked me to make more.  I did not use any nuts and they still taste great.  I did use cook and serve vanilla pudding and there weren't any problems.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make again.

THIS IS THE MOST CONVENIENT, EASY TO PREPARE BREAKFAST STICKY BUN RECIPE I'VE COME ACROSS.  AND WHAT A SUCCESS WITH THE GUESTS I'VE SERVED IT TO.  YOU'VE GOT TO TRY IT.  ALSO FOR A VARIATION, INSTEAD OF VANILLA PUDDING MIX, I USE BUTTERSCOTCH, IF YOU CAN FIND IT, AND IT GIVES SUCH A GREAT FLAVOR.  THEY'RE SO GOOD YOU'LL WANT THIS ONE EVERY WEEKEND MORNING!!

This turned out great and was very simple.  Since a lot of other people used butterscotch I tried that and used pecans.  So good!  I'd say make sure you grease the pan really well though, a lot of my topping stuck.

These were really good, but I think that they are only 5 stars if you add cream cheese frosting.  I found a recipe on this site and frosted them after they cooled slightly.  Makes a lot, better invite over friends so that you don't eat them all yourself.

These sticky buns got rave reviews to the brunch that we took them too.  I followed the recipe except for adding half vanilla and half butterscotch puddings.  I will make these again and again.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

These were yummy but abit on the greasy side. They tasted even better with the cream cheese icing we made to put on top. Very easy to prepare, will for sure make these again.

I found this recipe while browsing for a quick Easter breakfast for my extended family.  I hit the jackpot!  These are easy and taste great!  My father in law requests these every Easter now!

Followed the directions, but used Butterscotch cook and serve pudding mix.  The results were excellent and it was so easy!!!!  Love how it smelled in the morning cooking; nice to wake up to!

I prefer the recipes where the brown sugar and butter are melted together. This one had large pockets of brown sugar.

OMG!!  I made this for Christmas AM, since all the kids were visiting.  It went quickly!  I managed to save a bit for the next day, and it was still moist and flavorful.  This will be the "new" Christmas morning treat from now on.  Outstanding!!!!

I've been testing out various breakfast bread and cake recipes to eventually prepare when "us girls" (sister, mom, niece and myself) get together for our random weekend morning gatherings.  Tried this out on my adult grown boys.......OMG, absolutely easy to prep and the house smelled so good when baking!  These turned out amazing and are going to be a permanent breakfast staple.  I can see why so many reviewers stated they have been making a version of this for years!

Just really not happy with this. Do not put all the nuts in the bottom.  I should have sprinkled them around as I put the dough in the pan.  I listened to others and melted my butter then added the sugar.  It just got stiff, it did not drizzle on my buns.  I don't know if it was my oven, the bunt pan but I cooked it for 40 min and some of the bread was still not cooked all the way.  There was nothing "sticky" about these.

This recipe is very similar to my mother's recipe that my family loves every holiday or brunch gathering.  Except we use Butterscotch Cook and Serve Pudding in place of the Instant Vanilla.  The instant doesn't work as well, I've tried both ways.  And heat the butter and brown sugar and cinnamon until sugar is melted, then pour over the rolls sprinkled with the  dry pudding.  YUM!

This is exactly what I've been searching for! My mom would make these for her grandkids as a special treat when they came to visit. I never quite got the recipe from her so started to search for a recipe that compared with her description. This was it.  Only difference was adding butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla. I have made these over and over again and besides using butterscotch, I also used others suggestions by cutting in half and tossing is dry ingredients. this helps them pull apart easier. Also, I only use 1/2 c. of brown sugar and its still amazing! Cant wait to make them again!

Very easy recipe.  I prefer the half walnuts instead of the little pieces.  I didn't love the frozen rolls that the other reviewers recommended...next time I will use the Pillsbury biscuits and cut them in half.  I also cooked it 5 minutes longer, and still would have liked it a little more done.  It might be my old  oven though. ;-)

I used 2 cans of prepared country biscuit dough and pecans and baked them right away.These turned out fairly well, but I agree that the instant pudding doesn't dissolve completely, just sat kind of powdery on top even though I poured the melted butter over....next time I will definitely try with the cook and serve pudding.

Made these for mother's day brunch and to quote my mother, they were "divine"!! Sooo yummy and gooey and sticky! Used cook and serve pudding (one 3 oz vanilla, one 3oz butterscotch as i couldn't find a 5 oz pkg of either) as others suggested and they were perfect!

OMG so good!  I was so skeptical about using this recipe because it just seemed way to easy but the sticky buns turned out so good.  I did forget the cinnamon and I used cook and serve butterscotch pudding like others suggested.  The best part was how easy it was to make!!

I'm not sure why this is being called "Marcia's Famous Sticky Buns"; we have made it every Christmas for at least 30 years.  Like many people that have commented on this, we use cook and serve butterscotch pudding instead of instant vanilla.  It is very easy, and super delicious!  We also use pecans instead of walnuts.

Super yummy! Super easy! I make these for holiday mornings like Easter and Christmas. Great for busy mornings so you don't miss the action and still have a special breakfast everyone is excited for. I usually have a fruit salad prepared as well to add something fresh and healthy with this rich and sweet treat.

This is definitely a mistake proof recipe. I really messed up and it still turned out good. I didn't pay attention to what I was buying and got "pre-baked frozen dinner rolls" instead of dough. I ended up using my own soda bread recipe. I followed the rest of the recipe, but I just baked everything right away. I used Colleen's Glaze/Sugar topping mix, with the suggested butterscotch pudding substitute and I added raisins along with the walnuts. I thought it was going to be a real disaster, but it still turned out pretty good. I'll try this recipe again but with the roll dough next time.
