This was super easy to make.
I used 1 cup peanut butter, as per other reviews to give it more of the peanut butter flavor. And since I used the instant pudding, I didnt heat the mix at all. I whisked it in a mixing bowl consistency was excellant. I though since the pudding is instant and the pie needs to chill why boil.

I've made this twice and both times I have been asked for the recipe.  It's a keeper.  I did use a cookie type crust (not a regular pie crust) and
it was great.  Everyone who ate it said not to change from the cookie crust to a pie crust.  I'm sold.

I love love love this pie. I just went to the store and got enough ingredients to make it 3 times this week. I use a graham cracker crust and don't bother heating up the pudding/peanut butter mix. With instant pudding its not necessary. Try this pie, if you're not affraid of getting hooked that is!

I was extremely disappointed with this pie.  I cooked it just as the recipe said, and the filling was horrible.  It was not creamy or smooth, just rubbery and gelatiny.  It was gross.  I might have messed up, but I will definitely not try this again to find out.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving.  It did not go over well at all.  I did not have any, but my husband said the filling had a strange consistancy and that there wasn't enough chocolate.  It didn't set up well - it was watery.  One other person had a small piece - the rest was thrown out because no one wanted any - it didn't even look good.

This recipe was a winner at my house. I used one and a half times the recipe and it filled the pie plate nicely. I also substituted 1 c semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of kisses and doubled the amount of heavy whipping cream - this way the chocolate was much smoother. I took some of the extra heavy cream and added a little bit of confectioner sugar to it, whipped it together and added it to the pie filling so it would be lighter.  I took the advice of other reviewers and made the nutter butter crust, which turned out really well. I added some reeses pieces to and chocolate chips to the top, chilled for about 5 hours and it was delicious.

I modified this pie to my personal liking. I made a Nutter Butter cookie crust (24 crushed Nutter Butter cookies mixed with 5 Tablespoons melted butter). I also used the Cook & Serve vanilla pudding mix and folded a cup of thawed Cool Whip into the peanut butter pudding mixture to make the consistency more light and fluffy. Made this way, this pie was "the Best!"

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I would make a little extra for the chocolate mixture because it would fill out the pie shell better.

It had an ok flavor, but nothing remarkable.  My biggest problem was that the filling was much too thick and had an odd consistency.

Good pie, the family really liked it.  If I make it again though, I'll double the recipe (it was a little skimpy in the pie pan).  Also, as previous reviewers suggest, a chocolate cookie or graham cracker crust would be better.  It was very easy (I melted the kisses and cream in the micro).  Be sure to thoroughly chill to make cutting easier.

My brother-in-law requested peanut butter pie for his birthday, and I had a hard time finding one without cream cheese in it (which he hates). I changed a few things for the recipe. I used graham cracker crust instead of a pastry crust because it was a time saver. I also switched out the kisses for Reeses Cups, and liked that a lot. As someone else suggested, I used cook-n-serve pudding instead of instant and the texture seemed just fine. It got a thumbs up from everyone and the BIL said it was just how peanut butter pie was supposed to be.

This was just ok for me. The consistency is funny in your mouth as other reviewers described and the chocolate layer at the bottom was maybe a bit too firm and it made it  hard to slice the pie neatly and cleanly. I did substitute sugar free jello brand cheesecake pie filling in place of the vanilla pudding. Other than that I stuck to the recipe.

Yummy Yummy Yummy.  I used a graham cracker crust vs. a baked crust.  I also used cooked type pudding vs. instant. It came out creamy and great!  the firm layer of chocolate was exactly what I was looking for!

I made this for a family dinner last night.  Everyone loved it and they couldn't believe it was homemade.  The only reason I didn't give the recipe a 5-star rating was because, as the previous reviews said, the peanut butter part was too gelatinous and kind of a weird texture.  I think that when I make it again I may not use instant pudding and try it with pudding that needs to be cooked to see if that changes the texture.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone went absolutely crazy over it. Sadly enough I even forgot to cook the crust before pouring the chocolate in. Because of that I had to bake it with the chocolate already inside and it came out slightly undercooked. Despite all my clumsiness everyone still loved it. A very tasty (and EASY) recipe. I've had 4 people ask for the recipe. 

I used vanilla pudding combined with about a 1/4 a cup of cocoa and melted about 5-6 hershey's kisses into it. I decorated the top of the pie with Hershey's kisses and sprinkled cocoa. It looked great.

Very simple recipe but must stir pudding/p.b. for a while.  If I make it again I will add more p.b.-that part is bland.  Maybe some cream cheese too? Sprinkled crushed Butterfinger on the Cool Whip and placed extra Kisses on it to dress it up for Valentine's Day.

I tried this recipe after reading all of the reviews.  Instead of melting 20 kisses I melted 30 kisses with 3 tablespoons of cream and it made a nice chocolate layer.  I also used 1 cup of peanut butter instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe called for.  I think the secret to a nice smooth filling is to add the milk very slowly into the peanut butter and pudding mix on low heat.  It takes some patience but it is well worth it.  The filling was perfect.  I will definitely make it again.

Great and easy pb pie.  Very quick and easy to make.  I use natural pb and sugar free vanilla pudding.  I also make a low sugar graham crust instead of a normal pie crust.

added cool whip to the filling until it was a little lighter......don't add toppings to pie until before serving, they have a tendency to release moisture in the frige.

I liked this a lot but my daughter really loved it.  No small praise because she is beyond picky...into ridiculous...and very seldom tries new things.  I hassled her until she tried it.  Now it's her birthday and I'm making it again by request!

I had a terrible time getting the melted chocolate to spread on the crust - it "pulled up" and wouldn't spread.  The filling also wouldn't set up - perhaps I didn't let it cook long enough?  Regardless, everyone LOVED this pie - the flavor was wonderful and the kids went wild over it.  Will definitely try again.

This pie is fantastic!  I made one for new years and now all my friends are always asking when I'm  making it again.  I use a Keebler Shortbread crust instead of a regular piecrust. I think it really rounds out the texture.

I served this pie with all whipped topping, chopped peanuts, and the chopped peanut butter cups.  I added chocolate syrup for an extra touch.  I definitely will be making this again.

This pie was quite a hit with my husband. I do want to point out that the peanut butter flavor is not very strong - it's rather subtle & VERY thick like custard rather than pudding. Also, directions say to let PB mixture come to a boil - I made this pie twice and both times the bottom burned creating brown flakes in the PB mixture - it looked like chocolate & didn't change the taste but next time I would bring it to a very slight boil to avoid this problem.

Very yummy!!! I brought it to a family get together, and it was gone in a flash. I decorated the top with whipped cream and leftover Kisses. Thanks for a great recipe.

My kids and I enjoyed making and eating this recipe.  It's a fun project for kids.  Mine enjoyed peeling the kisses, spreading the chocolate around the bottom of the pie crust, etc.  Fun and very good.

The peanut butter part wasn't extremely strong in the pb taste - the way I like it.  My husband suggested that I make the chocolate layer thicker next time by doubling it.  Everyone liked the taste of it.
