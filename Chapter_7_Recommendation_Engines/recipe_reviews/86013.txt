MMmmmm tasty!  Teen liked it too and he is not a big Strawberry fan.  I did use regular fat free cream cheese and it tasted yummy still.

Instead of chocolate frosting, i used Nutella. It was just perfect.

Made one sort of big change...used lady fingers instead of tortillas.  Combined cream cheese and strawberries and spread on lady fingers.  Spread chocolate frosting on top of lady fingers.

Thanks for the idea! I only used one of the four tortillas at a time and spread them with Nutella followed by a cream cheese cool whip mix (half a brick and half a tub, quartered).  Then topped it with fresh strawberries.  Just roll and cut. They disappeared quickly.  If there is problem with holding their shape while cutting, try chilling them first.  I found a good sharp knife worked great.

Could not get the cream cheese/chocolate to stay in.  It squished out when I rolled it & it squished out more  when I cut it.  I tried it as instructed with 2 tortillas and I also tried it with 1 tortilla with everything on it (this worked better but still squished).  It tasted delicious though!  Couldn't bring them to the party.
