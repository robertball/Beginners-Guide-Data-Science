LOVED this recipe!!  No spectacular flavor just saucy & comforting!  I did make a couple of changes... added season salt & no flour.  And found that 2 cans of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup are better than any "cheese sauce".  We loved this & have had it twice!

Great recipe!  I just added a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to bring out the flavors (I usually do that with pork dishes anyway).    Hubby and kids want me to make it again!

I only have a 2 quart crockpot, so I had to scale this down, but for the most part I stuck to the recipe.  Here is what I did. -I used 1 pork chop- it was probably around 2" thick, so I halved it and cut it into pieces (and that's all I could fit in the bottom layer. -I could only fit 2.5 layers of potato & onion in.  I used 3 'B size' red potatoes, and 1 onion (~2" diameter).  Potatoes & onions were sliced about 1/4" thick. -1 used only half the jar of cheese sauce, and thinned it with milk & water -cooked in the crockpot on high for 5 hours, probably could have gone less.  Overall this turned out pretty good.  The pork chop was tender and falling apart.  The sauce wasn't too runny or thick, and everything had good mild cheese flavor.  I couldn't taste the onions though.  I will make this again, but I might need to add something to it (garlic? tabasco?), as I prefer bold, spicy flavors.

To give the potatoes a bit more jazz, I used a jar of Tostito's Queso (medium) instead of plain cheddar.  It gave the whole dish a kick!  The pork was very tender and a nice compliment to the potatoes and onions.

Okay so, I tried this despite most of the reviews either liking it or hating it. However, I did make a few changes, and it turned out well for me.

I only used a couple pork chops since I was only cooking for myself and my husband (next time I will use more, as they were falling apart and it would have been nice to have more meat). I laid the pork chops (used pork tenderloins) in the bottom of my crock pot, layered sliced/peeled red potatoes and a sliced yellow onion on top of it. I repeated those layers and I did not use flour, I also only added pepper once I was done layering it. I also added some garlic salt instead of just regular salt to the top. I did not use a jar of cheese sauce because that sounded gross to both myself and my husband. Instead I took some suggestions from other reviewers and used a can of campbell's cheddar soup, and a can of campbell's cheddar broccoli soup. I mixed both of those up with milk, some all seasoning, and pepper and poured it in over the pork chops and layered potatoes/onion slices. I put it on high for 5 hours (which, I believe was far too much as my pork chops were falling apart), next time I will probably just try doing something around high for 4 hours, or low for 5 or 6. 

Overall, with changes made, I liked it and my husband loved it. It seemed weird at first having cheesy pork, but it was quite good. Served it with some warm rolls and broccoli, will probably make again. :)

my family didn't like this meal.  Probably would be better if made with real cheese.  Fake cheese sauce was not a good choice.

This dish is very easy to make and comes out fantastic. My boyfriend is not a veggie eater so I made this and we both loved it. I took a suggestion from a previous review and used cheddar cheese soup, skipped the onions, but besides that followed it exactly. The pork comes out juicy and tender and goes perfectly with the cheese and potatoes.  Very hearty and comforting meal!

I loved this! I was a little nervous at first- porkchops with chees? But it turned out great! I took a previous reviewers recomendation and went with broccoli cheese soup instead of cheese sauce (just hate the sauce all together). I also added some frozen broccoli, mushrooms and minced garlic to just add more veggies. I made about half the recipe and only needed to cook it for 4 hours in the slow cooker. The pork chops were "fall apart" awesome! I will defontaley be making this one again!

This turned out really good!! I was a little nervous about this recipe, but it tasted much better than I thought it would. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I used bone in chops and russett potatoes but followed the recipe otherwise. The pork chops were fork tender and the potatoes were cooked perfectly!! I can't wait to make this again.

I served this on a Sunday when it was too hot to cook.  This was a big hit with my family.  This should really be pork chops and au gratin potatoes.  It will definitely go in my list of reusable recipes.

I was pretty scared when I made it that it was going to be horrible. The cheese sauce that it called for, well it freaked me out a little bit. It was surpisingly good, filling and tasty.

This was WONDERFUL!! Instead of cheese sauce I used the Cheese Dipping Sauce recipe.  I made it and let it cool slightly while I was getting everything else ready.  I did add the 2/3 cup milk to the cheese sauce.  My extremely picky kids loved it, even the 9 month old.

I wasn't very happy with this dish.  It was sort of bland and the pork chops were very, very dry.  I won't be trying it again.

Easy, tasty, and the pork was perfectly tender. Loved it, and so did my husband who usually hates pork.

I did make some changes. Paid attention to the reviewers that said it was bland. Added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to the cheese sauce. Also had boneless chops and I didn't want them to cook as long as the potatoes. I seared them and put them on the top, this kept them from having too much cheese on them. I also seasoned them highly with Natures Seasonings blend, my favorite for pork chops. Everyone really liked the dish, and said make it again. Potatoes cooked about 6 hours on low, and were not mushy at all, chops about 4 1/2 hours. Served with green beans.

This recipe was great and exactly what I was looking for:) I've recently started working 2nd shift which means leaving my husband and daughter on their own for dinner! I was searching for something quick and easy I could put in the crock pot for them that also wouldn't cost a lot since our budget has been a little tight around Christmas. They LOVED it! I think I might try cheddar cheese soup, fiesta nacho soup, maybe even queso to change it up a little.

This just lacked flavor, def need to add more seasoning. The pork chop was fall off the bone and so tender. I used two super thick chops and they were melt in your mouth tender.

Didnt like it at all. My fiance loves cheese and will eat anything that involves cheese and he hated this. The cheese became very watery, the onions did not taste right and the whole thing tasted very bland. Followed the recipe to a T. Definitaly will not be making this again

My husband doesn't like pork chops so I made this dish with 4 boneless chicken breasts.  I wasn't wild about this dish, but will probably make it again as my husband enjoyed it very much.  I wish I would have had measurements for the salt and pepper-I feel I was a bit heavy handed.  My chicken sort of fell apart.  My onions seemed to just melt away and my skins separated from my potatoes.

I used peeled russet potatoes and bone in chops and cooked in the oven for 90 min. The chops could be cut with a fork and potates were just right. Kids asked to have in next month

Took someone's suggestion and used campbell's cheddar cheese soup w/milk.  My son said it was too bland, so I added a jar of Tostitos creamy cheddar cheese (just happened to have it) and let it cook on high for another 30 minutes.  Very creamy, really cheesy and the pork chops were so tender they melted in your mouth.

My Husband & I enjoyed this dish very much, but next time I'll try ham instead of the pork chops. I used boneless pork chops & they seemed to get lost in the dish. I think the ham would stand out more

I may need to try this recipe on the recommended high setting for less time, but for my family I have to make meals that are 8 plus hours. Converted time to double to be on low. I used 6 chops instead of 4 and they were thick cut, but the 3 lbs potatoes was way too much. The flavor on this was ok, but I added paprika, parsley, onion powder & garlic powder to help it out some. I am thinking next time I will try other's suggestions of using the campbell's cheddar cheese soup.

It was easy and delicious plus my picky husband loved it!  I have to admit I compromised a bit on sauce because I didn’t have exact ingredients on hand.  I used 10 oz Campbell’s Cheddar Cheese soup with approx. 8 oz sour cream mixed with a little creamer and water ( I had no milk).  The result was very tasty!  I’ll definitely make this again!!
