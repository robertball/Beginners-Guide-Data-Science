Very good.  This was my first time using quinoa although I had heard it was good for you.  This seemed easy enough to make for a 66 year old man and fledgling chef.  Glad I did.

It would have been better, if i had shredded the cheese. I'll have to do it again. The recipe has potential

The flavors in the dish were nice.. I did use dried herbs. The only issue I had was the dish was dry. I was able to fix this with  tablespoon or 2 of some red pepper sauce I had. I think red pepper pesto would also work. It didn't need much.. just a touch of moisture

Delicious! I didn't have the cheese, so I used parmesan & romano. I also didn't have red bell pepper, so I used a green pepper. I made this recipe last minute! This recipe will definitely be made again, and with the correct ingredients. But all in all, it's a great dish!

I did not add cheese, but I did add crushed walnuts when I stirred the quinoa in and it added an occasional soft crunch. It took this dish to another level

this was absolutely delicious!  I did substitute a parm/romano blend for the cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I can imagine the texture being an issue for some, but that sort of thing doesn't bother me too much.

My wife and I were looking for another recipe for ground turkey, this was remarkable. I kept waiting for a mouthful without turkey burger, it didn’t happen. Also only takes 20-25 minutes!  Thank you we loved it

I made this dish and I absolutely love it! To mine I added red kidney beans and corn minus the cheese. Amazing I'll definitely be making this again

I used sage and thyme...and added spinach. It seems a little strange because it looks like it will have an italian flavor but it tastes like Thanksgiving.  I think I will add some pommegranate seeds for a little burst of tart fruit or alternatly I suggest serving with a little fresh made cranberry...Next time I will give it a more Italian flair with tomatoes, basil and oregano etc.

This is delicious!  I used dried herbs and added asparagus.  I also only had 1/2 cup of quinoa, which was actually plenty for me.  I also used a 3 cheese combo (parmesan, romano, asiago).  And I added red pepper flakes.  Very delicious!

Really liked this but I did add veggies I needed to get use up. Fresh broccoli, zucchini, extra onion,& did use boullion in the quinoa. Seasoned w/pepper, Aleppo pepper, Arizona Dreaming (Penzeys), and stirred all the quinoa into it. At the table before serving I added a large amount of chopped cilantro since I love it. Served it w/lime slices since we like that fresh tang. My daughter said it was a 'clean' meal, or close, and the three eating loved it. Make it your own!

Great dish. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. Also omitted the sage, used lots of ground pepper, garlic powder, seasoned salt and basil. Submitted fresh grated Parmesan for the cheese, did not stir it into the dish, let everyone sprinkle what they wanted on top. Will make again and add addl veggies to make it more colorful!

I loved it, I added spinach and mushrooms, and used the cheese on hand. A Italian mixture and some medium cheddar. I will make again

This dish is so good we made it back to back to have for lunch the entire week! We made a few substitutions arborio rice for the quinoa (use only one cup), did three cloves of garlic (we are garlic lovers), used three bell peppers instead of two, and with each serving we would slice half of an avocado.

I just made it and it's pretty tasty and I finally got my husband to eat quinoa!!!  I did add chicken broth because it was a little dry and I also added cumin but followed everything else.  Will definitely make again but I'm almost thinking the next time I will serve it with tortillas or pita chips.

The texture was unappetizing to me and others. I ended up using the leftovers as a start for spaghetti sauce. I did add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to give it more moisture, since I used fresh ground spring turkey-not store bought, which is much dryer than store bought. I also added marjoram and oregano.

Was fantastic - added a bit of spinach, but should have added more. And hot sauce &/or chilli powder makes it that much better! Also, made it with feta cheese instead and was still wonderful YUM!

We made this with ricotta and Romano, and added oregano. Really great weeknight dinner - relatively quick and very satisfying - with enough left over for lunch tomorrow. Yum.

Really great recipe. I added an extra clove of garlic as well as cooked the quinoa with garlic soup stock which added some extra flavor. I also used parmasean as I couldn't find any of the suggested cheeses at the store nearest to my house. Added a bit of franks to top it off as well. It's delish!

Tasty, healthy,  filling and a pretty quick dish to make. We enjoyed it and will make again.  Only change was I added spinach at the step with the rosemary, etc.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I had some left over quinoa blend with amaranth and millet so this was perfect. I didn't have any sage and used more like a cup of medium cheddar. I also decided to throw in some fresh spinach at the end until it wilted a bit and used 3 small red peppers instead of a big one. With these changes, it was very satisfying and healthy. I served it just as it was with some steamed asparagus. Thank you for the recipe! I will be making it again.

Excellent and simple. I changed it by adding lemon juice, garlic, basil, thyme and oregano. I also put a bunch of bell peppers and carrots in there and of course a jalapeño which in my book makes everything better. This is a great, healthy, high protein meal that I've made a few times now. I make a bunch and keep leftovers in the fridge for a fast hot meal. Yum!

This is my first try making quinoa.  I thought this turned out very good and tasty. I made it exactly as the recipe states however I substituted parmesean cheese as that is all I had on hand.  I will be making this again!
