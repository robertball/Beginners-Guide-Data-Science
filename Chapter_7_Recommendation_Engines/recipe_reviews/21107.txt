Jessica...I just wanted to thank you for sharing this AMAZING recipe!! I used a 13x9 inch pan instead, and it turned out absolutely delicious! My whole family loved it, and I will definitely share this recipe with everyone! Ps...the caramel frosting was to die for! I think I will use it as a dip for granny smith apple slices. Pps...in the ingredients, you don't mention baking powder, but in the directions you do.  I used 1/2tsp...turned out fine.
Try putting a slice in the microwave for a minute - yum yum

WHAT A JEWEL OF A CAKE. THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOIST CAKE. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO THE T AND YOU WILL NOT FAIL. ONLY THING IS. IF I WERE YOU I WOULD DOUBLE THE CARAMEL ICING RECIPE BECAUSE YOU WILL EAT 1/3 OF IT BEFORE YOU GET IT ON THE CAKE. I USED REAL BUTTER IN THE ICING INSTEAD OF THE FAKE STUFF. BELIEVE ME IT MAKES A DIFFERENT IN TASTE. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

Very good!  Everyone who has tried this has enjoyed it.  I did add 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the cake for additional flavor.  Also baked it in a 9 x13 pan for approximately 55 - 60 minutes.  If you want to tone down the sweetness, top with whip cream or ice cream instead of the frosting.  Delicious either way.

This is a wonderful, rich, moist cake.  I brought it to a ladies' tea and I had people begging me for the recipe!  I made it in a bundt cake form (which took twice as long to cook) and then drizzled the icing over the top and poured the rest down the middle.  Yummm!!!!

This was such a great dessert! My family loved it! I made it for thanksgiving. Howvever, I did sub. 1 cup of apple sauce for the oil and used only 1/4 cup of oil instead. I also had to cook it for about 5-10 mins longer. Other than that it was so good, every family will love it!

OMG!!! This recipe is awesome! I made it and shared some with my neighbors because they gave me all these apples and they had to have the recipe. The only thing is I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and since I had no walnuts I left them out. I've made this cake twice this week. This is a definite keeper, I hope Jessica sees this thanks, Jessica.  Thanks for sharing. Signed, The Grinch

Made in long 9x13 pan. Final taste very good however don't attempt to make this in layers. Very heavy cake and batter is like cookie dough. Carmel topping is very tasty but not "frosting" at all. This makes a great single layer coffee cake.

absolutely incredible!  I used 6 Macintosh apples and 2 cups of chopped walnuts - it took about 45 minutes to cook.  Otherwise the recipe was perfect, and the cake was a huge hit.  It's been requested by many that I make it again next week for another party!

I made this last night for Rosh Hashonah dinner and it was a major hit.  Not at all like the apple cakes I had grown up with.  I followed the suggestions of others and added cinnamon to the recipe and a little more apples than suggested.  

WOW!  Moist, delicious and the caramel icing just took it up a notch (to quote someone else).  This one is a keeper and will be used year round.

Thanks Jessica

This was very delicious. I didn't make the frosting (I don't think it's needed, the cake is pretty sweet on its own). Nevertheless, I did had to add a little spice to make it more flavorful. I ended up modifying it to taste more like another cake that I found in this site, the "Apple pound cake." Texture and apple-dose is perfect.

I made this cake exactly as describe and it is a great cake. My cooking time was 55 minutes, not 25, but other than that wonderful.  I have since made some changes to the recipe. The changes have made this cake a favorite in our house at all holidays. Changes: I sliced the apples versus dicing. The apples and their texture really do come through more this way. And I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of all spice to the flour mixture. I also baked my cake in a Bunt Pan and drizzled the frosting on top while the frosting was still warm. With Thanksgiving coming up, this is a great cake to make up to two days beforehand (if you can keep out of it that long,) since is stores beautifully in an air tight container and in a cool place.

I made this cake for a co-workers Birthday and it was a huge hit, it's so moist it's unbelieveable, the one thing thats wrong on the recipe though is the time to bake it, It took 60 minutes not 25 so make a note of that.. I also made the caramel sauce the night before, left it in the saucepan all night to cool then frosted the cake the next morning...

This is it! Make this in a 9 x 13 for a tailgate party, Thanksgiving, or just to show off for your friends. I poured the icing over it while it was still a little warm & it was wonderful.

This is really good.  I made it as a 9x13 and i think i could have cooked it a little longer because the middle was just a touch doughy.  I added some cinnamon and it definately helped.  This tastes to be almost like an apple blondie.  I will make it again!

This was _ok_, nothing more.  It makes a VERY heavy cake with a batter the texture just slightly more fluid than taffy.  Baking took about 35 minutes in the suggested 8-inch round pans, which I layered.  Followed recipe exactly with 1/2 tsp baking powder since its measurement is left out, and chopping the apples since it never tells you to do that.  I find it too heavy and rich, but if that's what you want give it a go!

This cake came out practically raw in the middle even though I baked it for about 5 minutes longer than the directions said.The taste was also just okay, nothing really that special. Also, it was not that appealing to look at.

The batter was too thick for me so I added 6 tab milk. I wanted spices in it, so I added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp each of cloves, nutmeg and ginger. Very moist! Baked in a bundt pan. I didn't use walnuts but didn't miss them.

This cake is absolutely incredible.  My daughter is not fond of cake but this won her over.  Caramel and apple combo is so tasty and fruity.  I added whipped cream/confectioners in the middle and on top so I could decorate it for her 17th BDay.

I had to cook the cake for over 60 minutes. I think it was 65 but it was longer than stated. I would have also cut down on the amount of oil - it took a while for the cake to be a cake after it was cooked. I let the cakes cool for a half a day to a day and they were MUCH better consistency and taste. Let them rest over night and then serve. I ate them with out the icing - just the cake. It was a big hit.. not too sweet but nice. I added more apples than called for and put in about 3/4c brown sugar. Would have been good to put some cinnamon in it - I put it on the top.   I would make this cake again.

This was a good cake.  I used 3/4 c. of oil and about 1 cup of applesauce.  I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon ot the dry ingred. I used 3 apples, 2 granny smith's and one gala.  My biggest problem was the bake time seemed to be WAY OFF.  I kept adding 5 minutes so many times I lost track of the total time it took to bake this cake.  I would say close to 60 minutes though.  I thought maybe I should up the temp to 350, but just kept checking it every 5 minutes.  The edges browned first but the middle seemed to take forever to bake.  I took it to a New Year's party and everyone liked it but my son.  I frosted it with carmel frosting I.  I don't know if I will make it again.  Might try another recipe and see which is better.  Not a bad cake though once you can get it baked.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It was FANTASTIC!! I didn't make the topping, omitted the walnuts, and added a little cinnamon and it was absolutely wonderful. Also, I didn't make a layer cake, I just made two rounds and kept one at took the other to a small get together and everyone loved it. So the next day I made two more rounds and took them to work and all 16 pieces were gone in about 15 minutes. Everyone was raving about how good it was. This is one to I'll definitely be holding on to.

Oh my gosh this was great!!  The caramel sauce was to die for.  Double it for sure and pour on at serving time.  I tried it in the microwave and it didn't get real thick until it cooled, but I probably overcooked it because it was not as brown as the picture showed.  I topped with extra pecans because I love them.

Made this for my family for dinner because I was looking for a recipe without chocolate in it because my Dad is allergic to it.  Everyone loved it-especially the yummy icing.  It was delicious.  Next time I will try to make-it over to be healthier, but it certainly tasted great as is.

I made it in a 9x13 pan and it was very good. Will definitely make this again.

Add 1 teaspoon Apple pie spice.  350 oven for 40 minutes.  Cake is excellent but raw in the center at 325/25 minutes.

This is a good cake.  I baked it in a 9x13 as others recommended. It took about 40 minutes.  I also added a tsp of apple spice and it had a nice flavor.  The caramel sauce is really good.  I made double  and poured it over individual pieces as opposed to the whole cake.  I think I'll try some left over sauce on apple slices.  I'm going to keep this recipe.  Thank you!

Amazingly delicious!  I did add 2 tsp cinnamon, about a cup more apples, and extra walnuts.  Used a salted caramel frosting recipe that I had on hand.  A rich, dense, wonderful cake.

Nice cake, very dense a bit heavy, needed spices cinnamon or something, 1 1/4 cup of oil is a lot, too much.

Awesome! Only change is 4 cups of shredded Granny Smith apples instead of 3 cups.

Just placed the cake in the oven.  I am excited to see how it turns out I did change it up a bit. I did equal parts brown and white sugar added 2 teaspoons of Appletons spiced rum 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and about 1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg I prefer to grind my own spices.  I also decided to not use the icing.  Well the cake is finished and cooled and half gone.  I will def make again. Thanks Jessica for a great recipe and for all the suggestions.

I love this cake!! My caramel topping however didn't come out very well. I followed the recipe to a T--twice!--and both times it ended up as an oily gloop.

Nice, nice, nice!!!  I adjusted the recipe for high altitude (7000 feet)which was easy.  Baked it as a layer cake with double frosting. I have yet to get any leftovers...so I can't rate them!  Fabulous cake!
