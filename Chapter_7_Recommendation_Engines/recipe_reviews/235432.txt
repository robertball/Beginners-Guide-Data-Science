I just browned the pork chops and made the sauce as directed then put everything in a casserole dish.  Baked, covered, at 350F for 1 hour.  Very tender and tasted great!

This was superb!  I pan fried thick center loin pork chops in the butter.  They came out to perfection, and the pan drippings were perfect for the gravy.  Some of us have to fiddle with these recipes, and it was no exception in this case.  I added Herbs de Provence to the gravy that took it over the top!  I would also suggest that the beef bouillon is not needed as I think it would overpower the pork flavor.  The chops were moist and tender at 9 minutes per side on a medium gas heat.  All in all, simple and delicious!

If this isn't comfort food, I don't know what is. I poured the "sauce" over mashed potatoes. NO leftovers. My kids and husband actually asked why didn't I just double this recipe so they could have had more.

I usually don't rate a recipe if I have to change it but this recipe has great beginnings!  I was out of beef bouillon so I left it out and changed the amount of basil from 1 3/4 tsp. to 1 tsp.  I was afraid it was to much basil for our taste.  I added a dash of onion powder and garlic powder. I ended up adding more milk because the gravy was a little thick.  It tasted great-the pork was tender and juicy.  I will definitely be making it again.  Next time I'll try some diced onion, minced garlic and maybe some mushrooms.

I hate when people rate then change the recipe. I made it exactly as written "but" I only had thin bone in pork chops - cooked them for half the time and the flavor of this gravy was incredible. I also made mashed potatoes to go with the gravy and my boyfriend responded over and over again 'this is good' 'this is reallyyyyy good'.  I had to agree so this is going into my recipe box under~ fit for company~. Thank you so much Cassie for a great recipe.

I followed this almost exactly, except I didn't measure the Montreal Steak seasoning...I just sprinkled it on both sides of the pork and I think it was less than a teaspoon. The basil and steak seasoning work great together in this recipe. It was DELICIOUS and I will make it again!!

This is a absolutely amazing! We made a few tweaks as follows, but only because of ingredient availability.  
- Didn't have dry beef bouillon, used the Better Than Bouillon stuff that comes in a jar. Not too salty at all. 
- Short on milk,  so used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half.
- Only had 3 pork chops so we had extra gravy which was awesome because it is delicious. 
- We cooked the gravy about 2 minutes extra. 
Seriously, this is an AWESOME recipe!

My entire family loved this. I made exactly as written except I left out the bouillon (it was plenty salty without it) and I sauteed some fresh mushrooms to put in the gravy. I thought the gravy was a little too white/cream for me, so next time I may try some beef broth and a splash of heavy cream in place of the milk. Overall, though, it was a hit.

Very good and easy to make.  I will be very careful next time to use very little of the montreal seasoning (a bit salty).  The gravy was excellent on mashed potatoes.  Will make again

This was a fabulous recipe! I had thin pork chops(boneless) and I didn't have the Montreal steak seasoning. I browned the pork chops as directed but in my flour I used crushed rosemary, ground thyme,Black pepper, dill, beef bouillon granules and salt. The sauce was awesome!!

This was the best pork chop recipe I've tried yet! I used canola oil instead of butter (not as much) and chicken bouillon since I didn't have beef. I will definitely be making this again!

This was so good!  My bf loved it so definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe although I just sprinkled (not measured) the Montreal Seasoning on the chops so probably used less.  I also did not use all the butter because I didn't need it.

Use grass-fed butter for this recipe. It will knock your socks off. The only other suggestion I would make would be to use the Montreal seasoning sparingly. Really, a dash or two on each side will do. Also, if you use electric instead of gas, cook pork chops on med-high too.

Had to substitute the steak seasoning for Ms. Dash, doubled the sauce and baked the half cooked chops at 350 for 30 minutes. (They were ver thick). Served with rice...yummy!!!

Wow! This tastes almost just like my grandma's...but maybe a tiny bit better (from the basil?)shhh. Will definitely make this a staple on our family menu. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have Montreal seasoning so I used McCormick's Steakhouse seasoning instead. I think its the same thing?? This is the ultimate comfort food. Ten stars! Thank you for the recipe Cassie!

Not many recipes can satisfy the whole family!  This did, and they wanted more!  I would double it next time because I only had 4 chops. Next time I would double the sauce and use 8 chops! Make this!!!!

I was out of butter, so decided to give it a try with olive oil and I was so pleasantly surprised.  It turned out great!  I left out the beef bouillon too, as other reviewers said it was too salty.  The sauce was delicious over both the pork chops and mashed potatoes - will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!  I had 3 super thick pork chops so I modified the recipe to serve 3 & there was plenty of sauce to smother them in.  I seared both sides of the pork & all the edges, too. I made my own Montreal steak seasoning using a Mock McCormick recipe I have & I omitted the red pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy for my little boy.  Served this along side the Roasted Garlic Cauliflower recipe by Shellery, also on this site. Both recipes are going into my regular rotation.

This recipe is amazing! Next time I'll cut back on the pepper as my little one thought  it was to spicy. My hubby and I loved it and will definitely make it again! Cook the chops a little less  but change nothing else.

It was pretty good. The Montreal steak seasoning made for an odd, spicy gravy.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it was PHENOMENAL! It did make a lot of sauce for 4 pork chops, but I used every drop of it on them, and the fried potatoes and angel hair pasta I made for sides. This was seriously a marvelous dinner! The only thing I would do differently next time is use a little less steak seasoning and double it! This will forever be a 'go to' recipe in my house!

As a teen trying to cook to help my mom, I don't generally venture to unknown food territory; however, tonight that was my best decision ever. I didn't have the steak seasoning, so I made my own, and I used chicken bouillon instead of beef... My mom said that I made better porkchops than she could, and even my very picky brother who never eats anything we cook cleaned his entire plate. Excited to make this for the rest of my family, and my boyfriend, too!

2-25-2016  ~Following these directions, the pork chops turned out simply beautiful.  Nice brown color, tender and juicy.   I sautéed them in clarified butter (I always try to make more than I need so as to have it on hand); this way there was little chance of the butter burning, given the lengthy cooking time.  I don't keep bouillon granules on hand, so beef base was what I used.  The perfectly moist and tender pork chops, coupled with a flavorful milk gravy = a tasty and satisfying dinner.  I served these with steamed asparagus and Barilla Spaghetti with Lemon, Parmigiano Reggiano and Basil, recipe also from this site.

This is definitely a recipe to make when you want to impress someone.  As good as any restaurant meal I've had.  I might cut back a little on the pepper, but not by much.  We only had 2 pork chops, but I made the full batch of gravy, and am glad I did.

My wife & I made this and with some tweaks it was one of the Best meals I have ever had. Add less milk in the gravy, tons of pepper. Before putting the chops in the oven add some butter to the top of them and it's Perfect.

This is for sure my families favourite dish.  The gravy is awesome and my husband said "I have to admit it.  The gravy in this dish is actually better than KFC gravy."  This is huge by the way.  My daughter dips one elbow macaroni at a time into this gravy.  We love it on mashed potatoes.  So nummy.  The recipe is sound as my mother made it when she was here and it was just as good.  I only sear the meat in the pan.  Making sure it is brown and a bit crispy on both sides.  This gives you some good tasting bits in the pan.  Then I cook it on low in a casserole dish in the oven.   I make sure that the juices that come out of the meat after cooking in the oven, are poured into the gravy.  Very important.  Except a bit of a difference in the process, I follow the recipe exactly.  Sometimes I add a bit of mustard to the chops before searing  them.  Just to give them an extra zip.  Oh and one more thing; when I make this dish my husband says "you get prettier every time you make this."  lol.

I was so pleased with how this recipe turned out.  I'd never tried Montreal steak seasoning before and it's  different, but not in a bad way.  I also tend to shy away from milk gravies, but this one was SO GOOD!  I got a perfect char on the pork chops which pairs really well with the gravy.  I served this with mashed potatoes to use more of the gravy and some Steakhouse Green Beans I found in the frozen aisle of the store.  Next time I'm going to try using herbes de provence in the gravy instead of basil as suggested in one of the reviews.  I'm definitely putting this in my meal rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

Very simple and tastey, I think I will try baking it for an hour like the others have suggested. Update: I followed the directions and then covered and baked for about an hour, wow , makes a big difference, so nice and tender. Great dinner and so easy!

I didn't change the recipe AT ALL and it was fantastic.  My chops weren't as evenly dark brown as in the picture, but they were done.  I had 3 relatively thick chops, and I cooked them for 8 minutes on the first side, and 9 minutes on the second.

I made these exactly as directed (although I had no Montreal Steak Seasoning, but I Googled it, had all the ingredients, and made my own) and it's definitely a keeper!  My family raved over these, even my picky eater!

I absolutely loved this dish!  My whole family enjoyed it as well.  I didn't have Montreal seasoning on hand so I substituted Herbs de Provence and my oh my did it taste delish! I like butter and added more as necessary than the recipe actually called for.  I also eliminated the beef bouillon the next time I made it and it was still great.

I made this tonight for dinner and I liked it. My 2 daughter on the other hand did not like the gravy. There is a strong basil flavor to it I would make this again with little or no basil for my kids liking.

FAB recipe! I'm always on the prowl for great pork recipes & this one from Cassie fits the bill! SO simple to pull together & serve up in 35 - 40 minutes. I had spicy Montreal Seasoning & used chicken stock to get the right consistency for that creamy gravy! Don't forget to add that pork juice from the chops you have resting on the plate. I did omit the beef bullion & added some Herbs de Provence. TO DIE FOR!!

Great recipe for pork chops. I used boneless pork chops because that’s what I had on hand. Will make again but will only use half the pepper. With the Montreal spices and the pepper , it was a bit too spicy for our taste.

Delicious! I made this exactly according to the recipe. The only thing I did differently, I used the "spicy" montreal steak seasoning. I was a bit skeptical about using it because of the pepper amount in the recipe, but it was the best gravy for the pork. I also served the pork with a baked potato, so there was enough sauce to put on the potato. Absolutely delicious. I will definitely be maaking this dish again.

This is so good!!  I have made it three or four times, and it is so satisfying and tasty!  The only changes I made were to make it serve 2 and used Better than Bullion paste, stirred into the milk, rather than dry bullion .

The pork chops turned out marvelously but the sauce was not my favorite. I felt that the sauce had a flour like pastiness. I cooked a thin I center cut pork chops on high heat for 8 minutes then flipped it for 8 minutes on medium heat. After that, I stood the pork chops on the side to cook the fatty sides

Over the last 10 years, I've pretty much scratched pork chops off my list except for an occasional try now and then. WOW! This recipe produced a moist, tender, flavorful chop that I've not experienced in many, many years. Thank you!

This is for the original recipe made with thin boneless pork loin chops. The changes below make it much better. Make 1/4 of the sauce. Replace 1/2 milk with water. Sear chops three minutes each side med high heat then reheat in sauce right before serving

Delicious!! The pork chops tasted fantastic and the sauce put the flavor over the top! This dish looked like it was prepared by a professional chef. I was excited to serve this meal to my family. Definitely a new favorite recipe!

It was an easy to follow recipe, the pork chops were great, but the sauce was lacking... my only issue is I’m not sure what... I think it def needs some paprika, but basil is just not the right spice, but I don’t know what would be good... I think next time I’m going to try it with celery seed. Otherwise we really enjoyed the dish!

Made it almost as written. Just pounded the pork chops before seasoning them. I didn’t have Montreal steak seasoning, so, I looked it up and combined the spices that are in it (tablespoons of garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 tablespoons of coriander, paprika, dill, salt, and pepper). Followed the directions on frying. I made the gravy as specified, but it tasted too milky, so I added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to it. Family liked it. I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and salad. I’ll make it again, it’s a great weeknight meal.

So this was very good and an easy recipe to follow, however I gave it four instead of five stars because it’s just missing something. It needs an acid like a splash of wine or a good vinegar to cut through the creamy gravy. Otherwise very tasty. My hubby really liked it as well as the toddler. Will make again but maybe add something acidic. I added sliced onions to the drippings and browned them, next time I’ll do mushrooms too. Thanks for the great recipe!

Do not skip the Montreal steak seasoning. It really compliments the sauce.

I will definitely make this again! I did saute some mushrooms in little butter on the side, and threw them into the sauce as it was thickening for extra flavor. Glad I did.

This is awesome all the way around. The sauce is super as directed to make. It calls for Monterey steak seasoning but never has you add it in the recipe. Well I thought I had some but didn't. When I found I didn't, I left it out and this recipe sure didn't miss it one bit. One note I would add. After frying the chops, maybe steam them for about 20-minutes to soften the meat. Thick cut chops are a little tough and we like to cut them with a fork. Flavor is spot on though when made as directed. No need to alter.

SOOOO creamy!  Both husband and son raved about it! I should have had some French bread available to dip in the sauce, since it was so flavorful and abundant.  All we had was regular bread but my son used that to dip into the sauce when his pork chop was finished.  Be careful not to overdo the Montreal Steak Seasoning on the chops--they might end up making the sauce too salty.  This was easy to make-no new cooking techniques to learn or unfamiliar ingredients--this recipe would be a good choice on a work night.

This is restaurant quality, fine dining preparation. I'm a man-cook always looking for something new to try. I added a little olive oil to the melted butter to keep it from burning, used spicy Montreal seasoning (being from Louisiana makes us do peppery things to our food), and opted to use evaporated milk. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I used a wok to brown the chops and to make the sauce. Then I placed the chops in a baking dish, poured the sauce over them and baked them at 200 degrees for about 15 minutes. The tabletop presentation in the hot dish worked well. Not only will I cook this again, next time we are having friends over to enjoy this with us. This is a superb recipe.

Wow!!!  It was delicious. I had a pork tenderloin and cut the chops myself.  I followed the recipe to the T but multiplied by 1.5 because I had 8 thinner chops. Served with baked potatoes and red cabbage. I'm so glad there are leftover!

This was an easy and delicious recipe! I halved the recipe for two pork chops and it was perfect! I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great..Really flavourful and even with half the recipe there was alot of extra gravy!

These were a hit with my husband.  I think I got carried away with the Montreal Steak Seasoning, being sure to coat all sides of the pork chops.  It made it too spicy for my taste.  Aside from that, these were moist, and easy to make.

Made this for my family of five and they loved it. The sauce was so creamy and the pork chops were so tender. I paired them with mashed potatoes and they loved them! Will definitely be one of my go to recipes from now on!

I loved this recipe, it was really simple but lots of taste.  I originally started out wanting grilled pork chops; which my 20 year old son volunteered to do for me.  However, plans changed after his disappearing act.  So I jumped into action and found this wonderful replacement.  I had already seasoned my chops with my choice of seasonings, so I didn't use the Montreal steak seasoning.  Although everything else was pretty much to the letter.  The flavor was popping, I did add some chopped onions to my gravy as well.  I believed everyone loved the change, although they were looking for grilled chops.  Even the chef that disappeared had great things to say! I would love to do this again.  I served this with another Allrecipe's Oven Brown rice (Kaylee W) and whole green beans.

So I ran out of beef bullion and added beef onion soup mix instead (hey, a girl has to improvise) and it was so yummy!  I'll keep this one!

This recipe is amazing! I imagine it would be good as written but, I did make some modifications. I deflated the pan with white wine, before making the gravy & omitted the beef bouillon. I also added some sautéed mushrooms to the gravy, as others had suggested. I will definitely be making this again!

Just made them tonight for the family and they were pretty tasty. I think the gravy was decent but would add a pinch of salt and no pepper as the Montreal spice had plenty of it.

We made this for dinner last night, and both my husband and I agreed we would be adding it was on the "make again" list. The only change we will make next time will be adding less pepper. It was a little peppery for our little one to enjoy.

I love Montreal seasoning on steaks and decided to try this recipe on pork chops. I seasoned the chops and refrigerated them for an hour. I usually let the beef steaks marinate overnight but I didn't have time. I didn't have beef bouillon and substituted with a chicken bouillon cube, crushed up. As the pork chops were frying, I placed a cover on it to retained it's moisture. I had everything else except for the basil. Used 2 tablespoons of flour and the sauce came out too thick in the end. 1 tablespoon would of flour would of worked for me. I guess it depends on your likeness. They turned out yummy even with using chicken bouillon and no basil. Next time, I'll cut down on the Montreal season since it was a bit salty and use less flour. Otherwise, it's a great and easy recipe. Thanks!

Excellent. I also did what previous reviews have recommended and browned pork chops on both sides and then put in the oven covered with the sauce at 350 for an hour.  Makes it super easy and I prepared the sides while they were cooking. I also used Better Than Bouillon Beef Base instead of the granules because it adds so much flavor. My sides were wild rice, fresh skinny green beans sauteed, rolls, and pineapple. Oh, and I sauteed mushrooms in the leftover sauce...I needed to add just a little extra butter to thin it out a little, but I'm sure milk would've worked, too... I put those on top of the pork chops. Yum yum.  My 17-yr-old son devoured the meal! :) P.S. My pork chops weren't very thick...Kind of medium. I just made sure they were completely covered in the sauce when I put them in the oven (and I covered the dish while cooking).

Make sure you use thick chops like the recipe calls for. I used a smaller chop and overcooked a bit. I only had The Keg steak seasoning so used that.  The best part of this is getting all of the tasty bits left in the skillet and getting that flavour in to the gravy.  Delicious!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time was exactly as presented, it was a little too bland for us, plus my husband really prefers that pork be more of a fall off the bone when finished.  A week later I made it again preparing and cooking it a bit differently.  I browned the chops about five minutes per side in butter, removed the chops,  then added  about 3/4 c. beef stock to my pan, scrapping up the bits and bringing it to a boil, replace the chops, turn off the heat, cover and put in a preheated oven at 375, immediately turn the heat down to 250 and braise for an hour.  I use a cast iron enameled pan it keeps the heat at a consistent temp even at low heat and doesn't stick.  Meanwhile I made the sauce, as presented but added a  1 TBS of Ranch dressing powder to the flour, I did have to add about 1/4 c. more milk to get the right consistency.  When the chops were done I served them with the sauce on the side. My husband loved the tenderness and has requested that we have these at least once monthly, easy dish ......I'm happy.

This dish was really yummy and easy to make! I took the suggestion from another person and browned the chops, made the gravy and baked for 1 hour. I made one other change also. I used 1 cup of (lactose free) milk and 1 cup of veggie broth mixed in with the roux.

made it! 
found the recipe and dived right in to it, reading reviews afterwards lol. 
some alterations had to happen due to still fozen chops and no beef bullion or Montreal steak. substituted with chicken and Montreal Chicken. My oldest (8yrs old) was licking the pan afterwards! He didn't Like it he LOVED IT (his words) lol. The chops I did each side about 5 mins then in the oven for 30min at 400. adding the sauce on top about 15 mins in. 
Also as most recipes I always find end up with not enough sauce (I like sauce lol) well I decided to double the sauce part.... My Warning to all Dont do that! It makes A LOT!!
I plan to take the extra and toss it in the freezer and see how it keeps that way lol.

I did not have Montreal steak seasoning so I used a rub that we had on hand. Although the rub was very tasty, it was really a bit too salty. 
Nonetheless, there was not a bite left and plates were licked clean! The gravy with the basil seasoning is amazing. I will definitely make this again - soon!
In fact, we have some gravy left over that I am going to use on some Omaha steaks tomorrow night!

Made it while in dire need of a grocery run, used BBQ Chicken rub instead of the Steak spice, with a pinch of Garlic/Pepper seasoning as well. Used Avocado Oil Margerine instead of butter, and didn't really measure anything out too closely, Turned out Awesome, highly recommend. Was very easy. Only thing I wish is that I had a bigger Pan to cook more at once for next time!

This was good - nothing crazy good or special, tho. I had thin steaks so cooked a little less in the butter and only had paste bouillon but otherwise followed to a T.  My sauce didn't get brown like in the photos - was more white but creamy.  Flavor was good - served with smashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts.

I really enjoyed the gravy flavor that was created by using the Montreal seasoning and basil. ! I did like another reviewer had suggested and baked mine in a covered dish in the over. So easy! Very yummy! My hubby loved it too. I will  definitely make this again.

I used Kabob spice instead of Montreal seasoning. I liked it, but I would use less black pepper in the sauce. I will definitely make it again.

Really fantastic. It’s a keeper for us. I never thought to do a cream sauce on pork chops. Where have I been all my life! The seasonings are perfect. I’m very happy to have leftover sauce, I’ll definitely find something to put it on.

Didn’t take a pic because my boyfriend and I ate it so fast! With how simple it was I was so surprised how flavorful it was. The only changes I made were i added more beef bouillon to the gravy and I used boneless only because that’s what I had on hand (still came out tender!) highly highly recommend for a quick meal with some mashed potatoes and a veg will make again

Absolutely awesome and very easy to make!  I followed the directions and ingredients exactly and I was not disappointed!  Next time I think I might add different seasonings to the flour mixture just to try a different flavor, but that’s absolutely no reflection on the original recipe.  This will definently be a go-to pork chop recipe for me!

I made this tonight for my family. I used homemade chicken stock instead of the bouillon or milk and thought it was great. 
I didnt have basil so will try with basil next time. We also used the gravy for a side of steamed baby potatoes and carrots with butter and garlic.

Yum.

This recipe is so delicious! I will be making  this recipe Everytime I eat boneless pork chops. I added red wine to the chops when they we're halfway done &  slithered some onions (I could eat onions with every meat) and made my gravy with sauteed onions. Thank you for this yummy recipe; my picky kids loved it!

Loved it! What's not to like? Easy, fast, delicious. The only thing I changed was I only had "Better than bullion", and I don't see how it could have made that much difference. Everyone loved it- will do again. Thank you!

I tweaked it a bit like adding bbq sauce to the sauce but it was great! Cooking them in butter got a nice even crisp on it as well

Well I thought the spicy Montreal was a bit too spicy, or I overdid it.  The sauce was absolutely delicious, the pork nice and tender.  I will make this again, but cut down on seasoning.

This was awesome! I would definitely use thinner pork chops next time because the thick ones I used took much longer to cook than 10 minutes per side. The whole family loved it.

These pork chops were delicious! I prepared the recipe as written,  with the omission of the bouillon. I made it
from the AR magazine's recipe and it didn't have the bouillon listed. As good as these were, didn't miss the boullion. I will be making this again and again!

Quick, easy and tasty!  I made exactly as written with the exception of the beef bouillon which I was out of.  I doubled the sauce and used it as gravy for the mashed potatoes.  I made this as a thank you dinner for some friends that had helped me out at my house and they all loved it.  The pork chops were cooked perfectly.  They turned out tender and juicy.  I always use a bone-in pork chop because I think they have better flavor.  The sauce is similar to a creamy peppered gravy.  The Montreal seasoning really took these pork chops over the top.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I don't regularly review recipes because I usually follow the suggestions and adjustments in the other reviews.  Which, makes me feel guilty that I didn't follow the original.  BUT, this is truly worth the 5 star review!  I have made it exactly to the recipe and tried some of the suggestions in others' reviews (mixing half and half into the 2 cups of milk and adding extra spices like thyme, dill, and rosemary to the dry ingredients).  Whether you want to follow this to the T or make adjustments wont matter.  Both ways are delicious and will have you dipping everything on your plate in gravy.

This was the best pork chop I've ever had and the gravy is absolutely divine.  So easy to make too!  Only thing I substituted was roast beef seasoning because that's all I had and used less butter and added grape seed oil.  My guys fought over the last chop!

The pork chop itself was very tasty, but we didn't really like the gravy.  If you like a thickish gravy, this would be delicious and worth making.

I had a pork loin that I wanted to use and decided to make this recipe. (I sliced them thick) I could not get them to crisp up the way I wanted because the pork was too juicy. I mean seriously who has that issue with pork?! So I moved them to my nuwave to finish the cooking and made the sauce, I put them back into the sauce in my cast iron skillet and finished them off. They were fantastic with home made mashed potatoes!

I was a little nervous at first because the sauce tasted a little different then what I was used to, but when it is put together it was amazing!

I haven’t eaten or made pork chops in so many years because I just never thought they were good and neither did my kids. I saw this recipe and thought I’d give it a shot and I’m so glad I did. The entire family loves it and I’ve made it several times now and used thin sliced boneless chops. Soooo good!!

Very tasty! Bold pepper flavor, which I love. It was a little much for my wife, so I’d tone back the Montreal seasoning a bit next time. The sauce goes well with everything!

This turned out very well and was super easy. I substituted beef broth for the milk and my gravy didnt turn out right. So lesson learned there. I will make it again for sure and next time use another recipe for dairy free gravy.

This was great. Had to adjust due to lack of ingredients. Used a packet of pork gravy to add to drippings and butter. Added a 1/2 tsp of beef bullion, 1 cup water, and 1?3 chip of milk/heavy whipping cream.  Let it thicken a bit and then added the pork back to skillet to let the gravy thicken even more. Turned the chops  couple time to let gravy seep in, if it would. Turned out great!

Very tasty.  Next time I will add some flour and butter to  the final cream sauce portion, my was a little runny but still very yummy.  I used fresh basil and it was very pronounced.  I did also add a dash of crushed red pepper and it gave a pleasant, not overpowering, kick.

This is the first time I've  given a review but felt I should. My boys and I loved this dish. The sauce was delicious and was perfect with mashed potatoes. I sauteed mushrooms and shallots as we love them but it would still be great without them.It is easy enough to be a good weekday dinner and delicious enough to serve to guests. This will definitely be made on a regular basis.

Very good / tasty.   I made the Montreal steak seasoning from a recipe on this site and omitted the salt in it.   With the amount of salt in the bouillon granules for the gravy, I think salting the meat would have been overpowering.  Sure made the kitchen smell good!

Fantastic and super easy to make.  I put the pork chops back in the sauce/gravy at the end to just warm them back up a bit.  I used less butter but other than that I didn't make any changes to the recipe. Will make again.

Left out the  beef bouillon and didn't use very good pork chops (very fatty) but I thought it was a great recipe!!!  I wanted some gravy to serve it with leftover rice and veggies.

So good!  Will make this again!  There was enough gravy we will have it  not tomorrow but the next night.  Plan to brown some chucked chicken, add it to the gravy  and put on top of biscuits.   Changes I made:  I had to substitute a chicken bouillon cube that I smashed b/c I did not have the beef granules.  Also, I used 1/2 c heavy whipping cream and only used 1 1/2 c milk.  Thought it might make it really creamy and it did :)

I didn't have Montreal Steak seasoning on hand so used a local spice houses All Season on both the chops and in the sauce. Alden's Mill House (aldenmillhous.com), made a bit more sauce a day or so latter for left over chops and over mashed potatoes. Great both days, will be making this again.

I didn't have any basil so I used dry mustard.  I added a large dollop of Hellmans Mayonnaise (good for Keto meals) to make it creamier and it turned out great.

Every time I try a new recipe I ask my husband what he thinks and typically he responds with, "It's ok".  After about 3 bites of this meal he looked at me and said, "This is really good." 

As soon as that happened I knew this one was huge hit.  

We've made it a few times now and every time it is on the rotation he smiles.  

Really good recipe.  Thank you Cassie!

Excellent! Only made 3 chops but kept the same amount of gravy and served it over gnocchi. There’s a lot of pepper in the recipe so maybe that could be dialed back a bit but definitely a great recipe!

Just make this for dinner and got rave reviews from my family! I don't have chops on hand so I used boneless pork ribs instead. DISCLAIMER: I modified this recipe to my ketogenic diet by substituting flour with almond flour. I also used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup unsweetened almond milk instead of 2 cups milk to make the gravy. My family loved the gravy this way and suggested I save the gravy recipe for future dishes.

Uses a LOT of fresh basil from the garden. Added Worcestershire sauces to deglazing and a dash of cooking sherry. My guests went for seconds on the pork chops as the loved the gravy so much! Said they would drink it, so did hubby! Will make again!!!

Was a hit with the family even my picky husband who always has something to say went back for more. Next time I will use less sugar and more ginger and also add garlic I think that would be awesome and I used frozen broccoli which was good but would be better with fresh broccoli so there will be a crunch it was a bit soggy using frozen

This was an instant hit! The only thing I would change is maybe a tad less basil, but that might just be a personal preference. (I do generally love basil though.) I didn’t have enough Montreal steak seasoning so I substituted Weber roasted garlic herb seasoning and it was fantastic.

Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I did lighten it up by only using about 2 TBS. of butter and a little olive oil.  I also used skim milk.  The flavors were fabulous.  Next time I will use boneless pork loin chops.  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

It came out amazing!!! I needed to cook the chops for a couple minutes more (nervous leaving them pink) but they were cooked perfectly!! I followed another review that left out the beef bouillon (didn’t have it) & I didn’t even miss it! I loved cooking the chops in butter - it gave them a delicious taste. My family LOVED this recipe. I was nervous at the strong basil taste of the gravy (might add less next time), but it complemented the saltiness of the steak seasoning on the chops! A definite add to my favorites!

I saved this recipe a while ago when I was looking for different pork chop dishes. I am so happy I decided to make this for dinner! The only ingredient I didn't have was the Montreal steak seasoning. I found a recipe and made my own.
This is delicious!! Thank You!

Followed the recipe exactly, and I loved it. I think it was a bit too spicy for my toddler, he didn't care for it, but the rest of the family loved it. Will definitely make again!

THIS TASTED AMAZING!!! the sauce was ready in five minutes tops. Sooo creamy and flavorful. Definitely a little bit salty but that’s my fault as I overdid it with the Montreal steak seasoning.

Absolutely delicious! We ended up with leftover gravy and used it to top our cube steak the next night.

I gave these pork chops a 5 star rating.  Although I did take the advice of one reviewer and browned the pork chops, made the sauce with Bella mushrooms ( my addition), poured it over the chops in a casserole dish and baked in a 350 degree oven for an hour.  The chops were tender without falling apart as they do with slow cooking and the sauce full of flavor. I used Herbs de Provence as the reviewer suggested.  I will make again following  the original recipe as well as the baking method. Thanks for the recipe. DELICIOUS !

I thought this sauce was VERY tasty. More like a creamy black pepper sauce than a herb sauce. I am very bad at frying chops but the drippings added great flavor. We really enjoyed this recipe and it was so easy. The sauce was great over our baked potatoes/carrots/onions too! Next time we BBQ steaks I am going to make this as I think it would be better than the pepper steak recipe I have previously used.

It was ok. Nothing super special! Not sure if I did anything wrong but the sauce was a little weird at the end. I couldn’t serve right away so the sauce got super tick and looked a lot different just a few minutes after. Pork flavor was great. Sauce just ok.

Excellent! Spice mix was so good and there was enough sauce that I was able to use as gravy. I liked MISTICAT57's idea and baked mine in the oven. I'll be making this a lot!

Great dish! I  tend to be heavy handed with the Monterey seasoning so I only use 1/3 of a teaspoon of pepper. Everything else as listed. My family doesn't usually like pork chops but they ask for seconds of these.

Great taste. easy to make. I did it from exact recipe. half the pepper would be better for my 4 year old son. the gravy/creamy soup was sooo good. personally  better than just adding cream of mushroom soup etc. to pork. I cut all the pork after frying it, into little bite size pieces and added it to the whole pan. Looks good and tasted even better. spooned it onto the plates with baked potato side and tossed salad.

Delicious and easy. The only change I made was to use thin sliced pork chops and browned them for two minutes on each side. They cook quickly and stay moist and tender.

Easy and delicious. I used bullion paste instead of crystals and kept the cooked chops warm in the oven. There was about twice as much sauce as I needed; this recipe would be good for six or eight pork chops.

Delishes, fast and you will probably already have all the ingredients on hand without making a trip to the  grocery store. I served it with rice, black beans and apple sauce.
This  is a keeper.

I forgot to thaw my pork chops so I cooked them seperately in an instant pot for 10 mins. Then i just did the sauce on the stove separately. Very simple and tasty. Good flavour but not overly strong. I have young children and they loved it.

This was a great recipe. The only thing I added was some onions to the pan and fried them while I brown’d the pork. Put it over mashed potatoes and yummy!

This was really good. I used thinner chops and you couldn’t really taste the pork through the gravy, so I’ll use thicker cuts next time. Gravy was really good.

This was a solid recipe for pork chops. I didn't have thick cut. So, I just reduced the cooking time for the chops by about half. Also, didn't have basil, so I substituted one drop of basil essential oil instead, and didn't have beef bullion so I substituted beef broth for half of the milk (1 C beef broth/1 cup milk). Would make this again. Made baked potatoes and spinach/strawberry salad. The gravy was great with the baked potatoes/skins.

The best pork chop recipe I have found yet! The sauce was so flavorful! The only issue I found was I needed to cook the meat for half the time that was suggested. I realize that every piece if meat will require different cooking times to reach the accurate temperature. I will definitely make this again!

This was so delicious!  I really wish I had made some mashed potatoes or rice to put this gravy on.  I kept right with the recipe except for the Montreal Steak seasoning.  I did have some McCormick Perfect Pinch Steak seasoning, so that is what I used.  I usually have it on hand but must have ran out last time I made steaks.    After I made the sauce I did put the chops back into the sauce for a couple of minutes just to warm back up.  Loved this. No need to put this in the oven for an hour when they come out this great and tender this quick way.  Just don't cook to fast (on to high of heat) as not to dry them out.  My were perfectly tender this way.

Porkchops in gravy, nothing really groundbreaking here. I expected more based on the reviews. It was good for sure but that was it. Not sure if I will make it again. Probably will just because of how easy it is to put together.

I made it just like the recipe, except I cooked the chops all the way through until 175 F, so it took longer, about 40-45 minutes, my gravy took less time to brown and thicken. I also made my own Montreal steak seasoning, looked it up online. Great recipe, easy and versatile. I have two people in my family who don't like spicy, and two that do like spicy.  You can serve it alone, with no  sauce, or with the sauce, if you want that extra kick!

These are so delicious! I found a recipe for Montreal steak seasoning, since I didn't have any. Also, the second time I made these, I used chicken bouillon instead of beef since I didn't have any beef. It was actually even better! I tried fresh basil the first time I made it, and found I liked dried the second time better.  Also the sauce is SO good on mashed potatoes!

I pan fried the pork chops then added them to a casserole dish filled with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and a cup of milk. Baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. It was delicious!

Easy recipe and absolutely delicious! I've made it a couple times now and I add some celery salt to the gravy which I have think enhances the flavor. I pair the chops with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and carrots.... the gravy is so good on everything!

Tasted amazing! Did use Almond milk instead of regular milk as I didn't have any handy.  Did make it a little sweet,  so added some more butter to balanced it out a little.

I made this exactly as instructed and everyone loved it. Including my 10 and 7 year old kids. I did burn it a bit so my sauce was grayish color, next time I'll cook it a lower temperature for longer. Despite the gray color of the sauce my husband was asking for more.

I added mesquite, a little bit of onion powder, a tiny tiny bit of garlic, and less salt to the sauce. It's delicious and a regular favorite!

I think the base recipe is good.  I did not care for the basil and pepper at all in it.  Way too overpowering.  I did see another person mentioned just adding the flour and then adding spices after adding the milk so they do not burn.  Maybe that was the problem?  I will definitely try again, omitting the basil and pepper.

Different. It is easy enough when frying. During the winter I'd like to try baking & see how it is. Hubby loved the crispy outside of the pork. He swore I put a coating of some sort on it, but he watched me make so he knew I didn't. It was hard getting pass the basil in the sauce. We liked the flavor, but it just seemed so strange. We did mash potatoes & doubled the sauce to put over as a gravy. I also added some mushrooms & will add onion next time. Will make again, just not to often or it wouldn't seem special.

This was really good.  I did use THIN pork chops and after putting them in the pan, I poured the sauce on them and baked them covered for 1 hour, on 325, turning them once, at the 30 minute mark.  I really did enjoy this recipe!

Only thing I did different from the recipe was use a spicy Montreal steak rub. I can barely cook a hot pocket and gave this a shot. It was easy and came out great.

Hubby really liked. I did have to add more beef bouillon to give it flavor that was the reason for a 4 star didn't have Montreal steak seasoning. Subbed my own spices for meat. Milk allergies subbed rice milk. Will make again. Easy!

This was good.   Just 2 changes.  Did not have the Montreal Seasoning so used Mrs Dash no salt instead.   Browned pork chops in skillet, made the sauce and put all in casserole dish.   Baked covered one hour.  Turned out fork tender.

This is delicious!  One of my favorite "all recipes" ever!  I made a single substitution just because of what I had.  Instead of the bullion granules I used a packet of Lipton onion and mushroom soup mix.   After completing all the steps I put everything in the slow cooker so it would still be hot and fresh for dinner.   It's great!  The sauce is great and so are the chops!  I served with baked potatoes (really just boats for more of the sauce!) and green beans.   I'll make it again without question!

I know...I shouldnt rate a recipe if I dont follow the directions exactly.  So this rating is for what I made with what I had, following the spirit of the recipe.   I seasoned the chops with garlic and pepper before adding them to 1-2 tbsp olive oil.  Its healthier and adds a nutty flavor.  After cooking them all the way, I removed them to a plate.  Keeping the bits for flavor, drain off all the oil from the pan and add 3 tbsp of butter and bring up to temp.   Stir in ONLY flour now, this prevents the basil and bullion from burning.  Scrape up all the bits as you go along.  When the flour mixture turns a nutty brown, add all the milk and stir.  Reduce to simmer and add now CHICKEN BULLION, 1/2 the basil and 1/2 tsp of season salt.  Taste and adjust  flavors at this point ( more salt, basil, bullion etc).  Return chops to pan, turn to coat, cover pan and continue to simmer until the rest of your dinner is ready.  Better double the recipe, everyone is going to want more.  I always double the gravy to add over rice, potatoes or noodles.

It was good and we enjoyed it.  I'm not a huge fan of the seasoning (Montreal Streak) so next time I may do my own seasoning mix, but a great base recipe!

I didn't have any dried basil so I used Italian seasoning blend.   That was the only deviation from the original recipe.   My hard-to-impress husband loved the chops.

Would give this gravy a 10 if I could. It's to die for!! Only changes I made were to use seasoned salt as I didn't have the steak seasoning, and to add some rosemary cause I like rosemary with pork. Chops had good flavor but were a bit tough. Will coI ok a little longer next time  I made this again and put the chops in the gravy for about 5-6 min. Came out very tender. Still LOVE this gravy (sauce)

Due to the rave reviews, I had very high expectations for this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was good, but I was expecting great.  It wasn't bad by any means but it tasted like regular gravy out of a jar to me.    I figured I must've done something wrong since it wasn't over the top like all of the other reviews so I made it a second time a week later and I still got the same results.  Like I said, it wasn't a bad sauce, just not what I was expecting.

I omitted the bouillon since I didn't have any, and I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk because I wanted to use the cream before it went bad. I also added mushrooms to the sauce. Those were the only changes I made. This recipe was so good! The pork chops were tender and delicious!

This was a very good dish. I didn't have steak seasoning, so I used Emerils all purpose seasoning. I did put a little too much which made it on the salty side. Other than that, I would make again.

A big hit in our house !!  Second time I didn't have  mushrooms so used onion slices caramelized, and the gravy was great.. Tender and delicious chops.  TKS.

Loved it.  The only thing I would different is not add the pepper to the sauce, there is enough spice in the Montreal seasoing for our family.  Will make it again.

Very tasty and tender.  I dredged the pork chops in the herb mixture along with flour before frying them.  Excellent and I will make them again.

Delicious!!!  Everyone loved this recipe!  I used pork tenderloin which I cut two into very thick medallions instead of chops and only sprinkled the Mt'l steak spice on the meat.  I seared them/cooked them until just pink, removed them from the pan and then proceeded as directed to make the gravy.  Once made I returned the medallions to the gravy, covered the pan, and removed it from the heat to keep the tenderloin warm until the veggies were ready (mashed potatoes and roasted carrots/parsnip/beets).   Wow.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

Followed the recipe, but didn't find it sensational.  Also,  chops were really dry, maybe because they were sirloin chops.  Can't imagine making it again.

I made this  dish to celebrate our anniversary.  Since this dish was new to our household, my husband first  only got half of pork chop,then after eating his first half, he couldn't wait to get his other half. The gravy was sssoo good and easy. This to me was a restaurant quality meal. It was also so good to have something so simple that was so good. 

So happy I tried this one.

Be careful how much Montreal seasoning you use - it can be too salty. Super easy to make, takes around 40 minutes to complete and plate.

This was delicious! The Montreal seasoning is key. To expedite the prep, as recommended by another reviewer, I browned the chops and then baked in the oven for 1 hour. Could have taken them out after 50 minutes though.

I made this two nights ago and we made it again tonight cuz it was just that good. Last time I made it just as the recipe said, and we used the extra gravy for boiled broccoli, delicious! This time, per my husbands idea, we tried breading the chops and baking it. I cooked the pork chops until about 50C internal temp and  still made the gravy as per the recipe. I then coated the pork in the gravy and coated a layer of breadcrumbs. Then I baked it at 175 C for 10 min (or until 65 C internal temp). Next time I think I may just brown the pork chop, not cook it so well done. That way I think the breadcrumbs would brown better :) thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Followed recipe as written, but for us, the Montreal steak seasoning was just too strong.  It was very spicy,of which neither my husband nor myself are fond.  If I make this again, I will use less seasoning on the pork chops.  The sauce was mild and thick without much flavor.

This is very good.  One of our favorites.  I substitute oregano or sage for basil (just did not care for it with basil) and pork tenderloin cutlets for pork chops. I also stir in fresh mushrooms, precooked (so as not to thin the gravy).

This was OK but not great.  I made it pretty close to the recipe - I didn't have bouillon so used a bit of broth, and used my own spice mixture since I don't use Montreal seasoning.  This is really just a good milk gravy over chops.  On to the next idea.

Make a roux with beef stock. Add some heavy cream, instead of milk. Much better.

Made the recipe as stated, but served it over seasoned curly fries (hey, it was what was handy!).  Holy cow that was good!  The fries added some extra spice and heat.  I also had asparagus spears on the side with a bit of mango-coconut salad just to cool the palate.  I am definitely making this one again.  BTW - it reheated nicely.

Very tasty results from simple ingredients and easy prep!  I made it exactly as described except that I just sprinkled the Montreal Steak Seasoning on instead of measuring it, and I substituted cornstarch for the flour to make it gluten free.  I served it with corn pasta and mixed, fresh vegetables.  My "chops" were boneless and about an inch thick, and they came out a little on the tough side, but the flavor was delicious. Next time I make this I will tenderize the pork by pounding it before cooking it.  I will also be sure to measure the Montreal Steak Seasoning rather than just eyeballing it... I think I may have used a bit too much, and the taste would have been even better without that mistake.

I browned the pork chops, made the sauce and then stuck them in the oven for 30 minutes..  I had more than enough sauce for even side dishes..

The pork chops came out amazing! My daughter and husband loved the sauce. Since I didn't try the sauce I can't rate it. I did mix all the herbs together. Then fried in olive oil until half done. Then put it in a 350 degree oven for a half hour covered in the sauce.

These were awesome! Very simple to make and quick. No changes or adjustments needed over here other than adding an extra tablespoon of flour to make the gravy thicker. Will make again for sure.

This is a keeper!  Did not have any dried basil, so used Tuscan seasoning in lieu of basil.  Also included a few shakes of herbs de Provence.  Did not have beef bouillon, so used a cup of beef broth.  It did make for more sauce/gravy (bonus!), but  just simmered the sauce for a bit longer to thicken.  We really enjoyed the extra sauce on mashed potatoes.  Family loved it!

This was a delicious recipe, however, I cut the amount of pepper in half or it would have overpowered the flavor of the basil, in my opinion.  We could still taste the pepper, but it was a much better balance between the spices.  I spooned some of the sauce over the pork chops then served the rest of it over white rice.  My family love it!

I made this following a reviewer's suggestion to leave out the beef bouillon as I am watching sodium intake.  The chops were excellent but the gravy lacked flavor.  I am sure the beef bouillon would have added some.

I felt like the sauce was a bit bland. The pork, however, was succulent. The sauce was a little gritty or pasty because of all of the flour.

This recipe is very good. If you follow the recipe exactly, you will not need any added salt after the seasoning blend. Luckily, I used the low-sodium Montreal seasoning. If I had used the regular it probably would have been too salty for me. Overall, this is a nice way to cook pork chops. I also like to alter this recipe for chicken, with chicken broth and different seasonings.

Really liked this recipe. It was easy and very tasty.  Followed recipe except used chicken bouillon paste since I was out of beef.  Also made my own Montreal Steak seasoning. Only change I would do is go lighter on the amount of basil. I'd cut it by a third. I really like basil but it was a little too much. Will def make this again.

Comfort food to be sure.  I used whole milk.  That along with the butter made the dish too heavy with dairy.  Next time I will use fat free milk.

Very easy and tasty recipe. Followed recipe as written except for Montreal seasoning (didn't have it) used roasted garlic and herb seasoning mix and used olive oil instead of butter to brown pork chops. My whole family LOVED it. The gravy was the best!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Turned out great!  Didn't measure ingredients for gravy and ignored what the recipe said about times.  It's gravy.  If you make gravy regularly, use the ingredients as a base and make gravy like you usually do.

Probably one of the easiest pork chop recipes I've made in a long time.  My husband loved it.  I used the thinner bone in chops, since that's what the mister prefers, but turned out wonderful.  Best part is you can honestly throw in any spices you have on hand.  I used basil and Mrs. Dash along with the Montreal Steak.  Another great recipe to add to my rotation.  Thank you

I will definitely be making this again! The only change I had to make due to lack of ingredients was using chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon. To be honest, I thought the gravy was a bust when I tested it on a fork (after setting off the smoke detector, it smelled very flour-ish). But with two startled, crying babies, I gave up and told my husband it was as good as it was going to get. 
I could have eaten two pork chops! The gravy was delicious on the pork! I had done sweet potato mash and wished I had done regular potatoes so I could have smothered them with it.

This was delicious and I can't wait to make it again!  My family enjoyed it also. 

The only changes I made was that I used half the pepper it called for because of my four year old and I only thin chops. Next time I will only season one side of meat as it was a tiny bit salty.  The gravy was delish!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. My husband doesn't typically like gravy on anything and he was using bread to get the rest of the gravy out of the pan. Such a simple recipe and yet it was so delicious.

I made this according to the recipe other than I did sprinkle the steak seasoning on both sides of pork without measuring it which made it a bit salty, and the next time I will leave out the boullion which I think will help.  It was very good (other than the saltiness) and will definitely make it again (used the gravy on yellow rice as well as chops).

I followed exactly how directed but it didn't turn out good, good. I think it was ok. I will add some salt to te sauce next time and cook less time the pork chops. I cooked 7 mins each side and they weren't tender.

So delicious! The creamy sauce was amazing. I marinated the chops with the Montreal Steak Seasoning and a little Soy Vey Teriyaki sauce. I also used 1 cup heavy cream, because I had it, and 1 cup milk. Very rich. Will definitely make it again.

great recipe!  I tried to use almond meal for the sauce, but it didn't turn out as thick, had to use reg flour, lesson learned.

Absolutely fantastic dish.  Made exactly as recipe is written.  I did  not have Montreal Steak seasoning on hand so I found a copy cat version and used.  My only regret is that I forgot to make a double batch of gravy as per another reviewer suggestion.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks.

Going to be making this again soon-ish. The first time I made it though I was missing the chops. I instead cut up a roast into fairly thick "chops". It worked  quite well next time, I'll have the chops.

Yum! Didn't have Montreal Steak Seasoning so I used Montreal Chicken Seasoning. I also put about 2 tablespoons of white wine in to deglaze the pan after cooking pork to loosen the bits.

This recipe is perfect. I breaded my porkchops because I prefer them that way. I also had to leave the house for a little. So I put them in the crockpot on high with a little butter for about two hours and they were beyond tender. No knife needed!

I loved the flavor and tenderness of the chops.  We had mixed reviews on the gravy.  I felt the basil was a bit overpowering in this, but others thought it was good.  Overall, It was an easy, fast and good weeknight meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe! Increased to 7 pork chops and adjusted measurements accordingly. Followed recipe as directed. Realized at the last minutes that I had no more Montreal Steak spice so I found a recipe for a copy cat McCormick blend. Husband and kids loved it.

Modified only slightly - used the Keg steak spice instead of MSP.  Huge hit with husband and 3 boys.  Will be added to a regular rotation in this house.

Made strictly per Cassie's instructions; halved the cooking time, being my chops were boneless. Cooked tender, yet done--the chops carry a distinct outdoor grill flavor essence. And wow!! The sauce came very close to a country pepper gravy taste--very very much like a famous nation-wide restaurant chain;  I was happily  impressed because it DOES compliment the chops!!  Served with mashed potatoes---but I can see the sauce pairing well with Texas sized biscuits or drizzled ribbon-style across a bed of steamed green beans . Whoever shares Cassie's home and heart is indeed, a blessed person!!

Loved this! My only recommendation, and this may have been my fault, be cautious of how much Montreal steak seasoning is used (comes out salty if too much). I also covered the chops with a lid when cooking so they were less crispy and more tender. Absolutely delicious!

Easy, appealing presentation and great taste.  I didn't have beef bouillon granules, so I added about 1/2 cup beef broth to the sauce. I did not reduce milk and it was perfect.

We used fat pork chops, bone in, and 7 mins per side was too long--will try 5 next time.  Delicious!  Used almond milk & cream for sauce.

Made as written.  Will definitely make again.  A simple yet flavourful receipe for pork chops. Husband wanted to give it 5 stars.
Be sure to serve with mashed potatoes, rice or noodles that will absorb the gravey.  The chops and the gravey are both peppery and salty, so if you are adverse to salt and pepper, you may want to cut back on the steak seasoning and the pepper.  I didn't notice too much basil as some reveiwers did.

Great comfort food dish. It was a tad too black peppery for us but that could be my fault as I used a homemade Montreal steak seasoning. Next time I'll cut back on the pepper for the gravy.

A family hit! Very good gravy/sauce. My daughter who doesn't care for pork chops asked for seconds and then she put the sauce on her baked potato. My husband loved it too. There were no leftovers tonight!! Will definitely make this one again!  I made it exactly as the instructions say with no changes to the recipe. Wonderful.

I made this recipe in the crock pot . After browning the pork chops in a skillet I put them in the crock pot and added the gravy and only thickened it just a little first. Let it cook on low for 6 hours. This is a great way for me to get the  family to try something new and different. Great recipe. Thanks

I didn't have a lot of butter, so used some Wildtree Garlic Grapeseed Oil for 1/2 of the fat.   This recipe was very good and the pork chops, having cooked them for 8 minutes on each side, were succulent and delicious.  The sauce was very easy and also very good.  The huge plus, it did not take much time at the end of a day.

I thought this was pretty good. The only issue I had with it was too much basil. Next time I will cut it down by half.

My family liked it more than I did. I made the recipe as directed but thought the gravy would have been better with a chicken base rather than beef.

This was AMAZING!! My husband is Danish, so he LOVES pork, and I've been trying to find a pork chop recipe that gave me moist and flavorful chops suited to an American palate. THIS IS IT!! Hans says I can back off on the Montreal steak seasoning (okay, I probably used too much, my bad, but I too often find pork chops lacking flavor, which these did not). One change that I made because I could, was to use "SVINE Bouillon" instead of Beef. You can actually buy Pork bouillon in Denmark, which I did on our last visit there. 
This will be a do-again, and again, and again recipe. Thank you, thank you!!!

I added bell peppers to the gravy YUMMY.......it was so good that I'm going to make it again next week when my mom comes...... I made it with asparagus and home made mashed potatoes + garlic bread ...........delicious meal and the left over portion the next day was even better

So good!  Added some mushrooms and zuchini.  Skipped the boullion and used some homemade beef broth instead, as well as a cup of non fat Greek yogurt in place of the milk.  Really excellent, thanks!

I made this with the oven tip mentioned above. Fried the sides a bit and stuck it in the oven for ~30min. I also added mushrooms to the drippings before adding in the flour mix and milk. Totally gonna do it again sometime :)

This recipe worked out great! If you're bored with chops or are worried about drying them out, try this you won't be disappointed. My chops were extremely thick so I put my whole pan in the oven after browning for half hour then finished stovetop as per directions. My husband loved the gravy and we used it on our mashed butternut squash.

What an unexpected surprise! Yum. 
I used my own steak spice to cut back on some salt (authentic Canadian steak spice-check it out).
I never pan fry meat in butter, but I'm glad I did. It Browns in the pan giving it a nutty flavor. 
 I omitted the basil and added extra steak spice. I used rice flour for the gravy to keep it gluten free. 
I served it with garden fresh corn, peas, carrots and baby potatoes. 
I am already looking forward to trying it again soon.

I made this for my husband and myself and I only had the spicy Montreal Steak seasoning, so the final dish definitely had a kick to it!!! But this was a very simple recipe, with a great flavor. I will be making this again:)

I used 1 cup of the beef bouillon for the gravy and left all the other gravy ingredients the same. This made a lot more gravy, which is a bonus (we made mashed potatoes as a side and the gravy on top was delicious). Definitely will make again!

Made this exactly  as written  except  only had thin cut pork chops so that is what I  used .  They came out great (I overdid it with the Montreal steak seasoning, I didn't measure it and it was a bit too salty.) Will definitely  make again.

I've been made these a couple of times and we love them! I ended up going with adding the herbs de Provence like someone else me mentioned and it's a must! We also saved the remaining sauce and put it in freezer to put on top of chicken, specially some chicken katsu!

I made it the first time without making an changes, and it was incredible!  I don't usually enjoy pork chops but made them for my husband--but I really like these!   They're in our regular rotation now.  The rest of the times I made them without the bouillon and it was still great, and I reduced the temp when making the flour.  Delicious!

I will definitely make this recipe again. My wife and our roommate loved it! I didn't measure the steak seasoning, so it ended up being a bit salty, but that's my own fault. I also found that I needed to double the amount of flour the recipe calls for to thicken the gravy. I highly suggest this recipe!

My husband and I both agree way too much pepper and basil. I  made this exactly as written and as is I will not be making this again. Perhaps with some changes but then it won't be this recipe.

This has become a family favorite. The first time I made it it was a little bit spicy so the second time I used a little less Montreal seasoning. This is one recipe even the kids request.

I made this twice, the first time following the recipe, I liked it, but the basil seemed to overpower everything else. The second time I cut it back, doubled the sauce, and served on a bed of pasta. Very good!

By mistake i made this recipe differently (I will explain)but it turned out so delicious that everyone loved it so much, I will definitely make it again.
Since I had 7 pork chop instead of 4, I decided to double up the recipe. I added 2X the butter to yield 6 spoonful of drippings; but it was probably unnecessary because I ended up having so much drippings that I dumped the rest. I also doubled up all the seasonings to make the sauce, but after I added 2c of milk, I tasted the sauce and I realized it was perfect. So I didn't double up the milk.
Other things that I did differently: I used whole milk instead of skim milk, and chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon.

The gravy was great.  This was a simple meal to make.  I would probably make again, but, it's not a flavor profile that I crave often.

Made as written. The gravy and chops had great flavor. Chops were nice and juicy. Put chops and gravy over wild rice and had green beans as a side.

Going to try wild mushrooms in the gravy next time for a more depth of flavor. I used cast iron skillet also.

Very good. The only thing I changed, and it was out of necessity, was to use Chicago steak seasoning instead of Montreal.

My husband & I made this last night, and we agreed this goes in our rotation of food to make. It was simple, yet very delicious. I passed the recipe on to a friend and she's going to try it this weekend. Everything in it makes it so savory. I had leftovers for breakfast & didn't want it to end.

I wanted to like this recipe so much, but it was just ok. I followed directions by the letter, but the sauce didn't really turn out. The chops were  saltt but stoll decent so I give this recipe 3 stars.

The only change I made was out of necessity as I had thin slices pork chops in hand, but we prefer smaller portions. I browned them 5 minutes per side. We loved this recipe,and will make again. I liked that the ingredients were things I have on hand and it was easy and quick.  My husband pronounced it "company good" so we will definitely serve with guests. Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty darn awesome!!!  I didn't have beef bouillon granules so used a Swanson Beef Flavoring packet instead and added after I mixed in the flour and basil into the butter and drippings and before the milk.  There was PLENTY of sauce!   I also used 3 THICK cut pork chops instead and after searing and cooking in a pan put into a 350 oven for about 8 minutes (until juices ran clear). Served with yukon gold mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli. Got rave reviews from the family!!!!

Is a delicious dish. I like to double the sauce to put over rice or potatoes. Has lots of robust flavor.

If I make it again, I will reduce the amount of pepper to half, and make a little less gravy.  Lots of left over gravy.

Turned out wonderfully, served them with steamed broccoli and flaky biscuits.  Only made a half recipe and there was plenty of sauce for an extra biscuit. My husband said he would have had a second chop if I made the full recipe. I would recommend going heavy on the Montreal seasoning. We used what we had in the house so regular chops not thick cut so we reduced the cooking time to about 4 minutes on each side. I will certainly be sharing this recipe!

I had to make some changes instead of seasoning I added emeralds essence extra heavy because it was almost out of date. I also added a couple of melted butterscotch candies as glaze instead of gravy. It was a little to southern otherwise.

My husband devoured his meat and potatoes, then said, "You can make pork chops like this any time you want."

I followed the recipe exactly, doubling the gravy and adding a pinch of Dalmatian sage. I didn't need to add as much butter, either. Served with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole. It was amazingly delicious, and the aftertaste of the basil sat nicely in my mouth.

This was SO delicious and easy to make. I've never made gravy before, and I was probably too impressed with myself after this recipe! Sooo yummy, excellent on a cold night with green beans and mashed potatoes and a nice glass of wine! :)

I brined the chops as I was defrosting them (we buy meat in bulk and freeze it), something I almost always do to keep them moist, and substituted herbs de provence because I ran out of dried basil. I'm sure it would have been just as good as written. I followed the recipe exactly other than that and it was definitely comfort food at it's best! The seasoning was spot on, gravy was creamy and the whole thing was quick and easy! Husband liked it so much he requested I make this again and often! This is a keeper for weeknights and can be "fancied up" for company with some mushrooms and wine in the sauce!

Very nice! Made exactly as directed in my cast iron skillet.  Loved the sauce. Made roasted baby red potatoes this time but definitely will do mashed next time.  Thanks for posting this as it's going in my regular pork chop rotation file.

These were good; just a little rich and salty for me. However, it's not really my style of food... As previous reviewers stated it is a "homestyle meal" almost like a chicken and biscuit dish just with pork chops.

I followed the directions with the exception of not measuring the montreal steak.  I just sprinkled some on (probably more than I should have, but we like salt here).  I used very thick bone in pork chops and cooked it in a cast iron skillet on the stove.  They came out mouthwatering and perfect.  My husband cannot stop talking about how good they were.

My family gave thumbs up on these pork chops.  It was an  easy and delicious meal to put on the table.  The only thing I would suggest is to have a light hand when seasoning the pork chops.  We thought the Montreal Seasoning may have been too salty.  Other than that, a wonderful  December Dinner.

I followed the recipe, except that I added a few fresh herbs - rosemary, thyme, and sage.  It was terrific, and I would have given it 5 stars if not for the salt level.  It was too salty for me, so next time I will cut down to half of the bouillon and the steak flavoring.

Sooo delicious! and not difficult to prepare. If your pork chops are thawed, you can have this ready in 30 minutes (with 5 kids age 8 and under to care for, recipes often take me longer!). I have made this twice, and my only change was decreasing the cooking time slightly. I watched the allrecipes video on cooking pork chops in a pan, and followed their steps of browning on high heat, one minute on each side, then reducing the heat and cooking 3-5 min on each side till juices are clear. I lovvve the sauce! My favorite pork chops recipe!!

So yummy, it's the first recipe I've reviewed. All my kids ate it up and asked for seconds. Particularly impressed with the gravy; I always have a hard time making gravy. This was super-simple and spot-on. Follow the recipe and stir continuously and you can't go wrong.

Very easy to make on busy night and tasted great.  I loved the gravy over the pork and mashed potatoes.  (note I did use McCormick steakhouse seasoning, but I think its McCormick's version of Montreal, but with less salt).

I didn't have Montreal Seasoning, & beef bouillon on hand  so I subbed with a chicken seasoning & chicken bouillon. By far & away one of the easiest & most delicious  dinners I've ever made! Thanks so much for this easy weeknight recipe.  This will go in my monthly rotation & this is very customizable depending what you got in your cupboard. Very price efficient as well (which makes mom happy).

Made this twice, both times it came out amazing. My family loved it! I used 8 small thinly sliced pork instead of 4 large pork chops because it was all that I had here but it turned out amazing and the sauce was yummy. My husband had enough to take with him to lunch the next day.

Wow what a great recipe.  I used a pork loin roast which I sliced.  Will be making again.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was OK, not sure if I would make again; however, the gravy was pretty great, other than being a tad bit peppery.

That said, it was very good comfort food and using fresh, not frozen, pork chops is key to tenderness.

There was way too much basil in the gravy. It was really all I could taste and it completely overwhelmed the taste of the pork drippings. If I decide to make this again, I probably won't put any in it and season it with fresh ground black pepper a pinch of salt and maybe a little cayenne.

Loved the sauce on this one! Cooking time is a tad long for my taste but watch closely to be sure your chops don't dry out.

I didn't change anything and it was awesome. Nice spice great flavor I uses the sauce on some garlic mashed potatoes as well as the chops and it was great. The only thing I would change is less pepper. With the Montreal steak spice and pepper  i found it was a bit much. Will definitely make this again!

I used 4tlbs of unsalted butter to cook the 1inch chops instead of the 2, pan seared them with the butter for about 10 minutes on each side and they came out perfect. Excellent sauce!!

This has become one of my family's staples. Love the spicy creamy gravy! Just enough of a kick. I make my own Montreal seasoning, so that may affect the taste a bit, and I do have to use more flour than this recipe calls for to make enough gravy, but other than that... spot on!

My chops were quite thin, so I didn't follow the cooking instructions. I still pan-fried them though, so I could make that gravy. I've never used steak seasoning on pork before, now I don't know why not. Delicious. I don't buy bouillon, but I do use soup base that is a creamy paste. I tried using that here, but it didn't dissolve, there wasn't enough liquid. I should have dissolved it in hot water before adding it to the pan. No matter, the gravy was very good. I'm thinking the bouillon isn't necessary. If you brown the chops well there should be plenty of flavor in the pan for rich gravy. Regardless, I enjoyed this recipe very much.

Very yummy!!  All of my kids (ages 3-14) and my husband really enjoyed this recipe.  Love that it is super simple, fast and has few ingredients. The only thing I substituted was fresh basil for the dried.  This is a keeper :)

I absolutely loved this, and so did my husband! Made as directed, except used ribeye chops (they're the best IMO) and added about 1/2 tsp. herbs provence as suggested by another member. The chops were very tender, and the sauce was delectable. If doubling (which I recommend if you want any chance of leftovers, haha) I would only double the meat. As much as we loved the sauce, we didn't need THAT much of it, and believe it would haven been plenty for 8 chops.

I followed directions on the pork chop side, used bone in, satayed a half of an onion,  two cloves of garlic and s pound of sliced mushrooms, added gluten free gravy from Mc cormicks used milk and water with the gravy mix, put on top of pork chops covered and stuck into a 350 degree oven  for one hour. Using the mushrooms help with the saltiness.

I will definitely make again. Followed recipe exactly this first time with the addition of a good shake of store bought Herbes de Provence.  De-glazed pan with just a splash of white wine. I liked the peppery taste but next time I will cut back on the  black pepper by half so more of the herb flavors come through. Only use 1/2 teaspoon of instant beef bouillon granules or omit. Kept the pork warm in the oven while I made the sauce. Sliced mushrooms would also  elevate the flavors of the sauce.  Easy one pan meal.

This dish was certainly edible and I would make it again, but I don't feel it was stellar.  The gravy did add to the chop, however I felt that it could have used a bit more flavor.  

If I make this again I will try incorporating a few more savory herbs into the sauce to try and give it a bit more punch.

Used thin pork chops. Came out great. Didn't change a thing. Well I did use olive oil to cook chops cause I was low on butter.

Made as the recipe was written and, wow, fantastic.  Made with roasted red potatoes but wish I made mashed potatoes or rice.  Sauce was awesome.  Now one of my sons top five dishes I make.

Make these regularly and my hubby and children love them, my hubby hates pork chops, I made this dish and he raved about the creamy chicken! He now requests this dish regularly.  I know what the creamy chicken dish he speaks of, should I tell him it's pork?

These are really good! I also baked them in the oven after browning them and served them with mashed potatoes.

And FYI: Pork today can be slightly pink and still be safe to eat.

The ONLY change I made was doubling the sauce because we love sauces in this family. The entire family LOVED it. I served it with yellow rice and green beans. My 2 year old ate ALL of his portion and took half of one of my husband's pork chops. He was so cute licking his plate. Thinking of making baked chicken for Sunday and using the same sauce. LOVED IT!! Thank you for taking the time to post this.

This was pretty tasty. I had only ever used Montreal seasoning on meat on the grill and was happy to find that it tasted so good cooked in a pan. The "gravy" was good, but our kids thought it was too peppery. I will be making this again.

Honestly, not great. Anything tastes good with enough Montreal steak spice and butter! The gravy was really bad with waaay too much basil called for. A little mushroom soup as sauce would have been better.

I used a different steak seasoning but the pork chops cooked up wonderfully.  I was a little iffy on the sauce, I'm not a big fan of basil.  I will make again using a different seasoning for the sauce.

I added an onion layer to the bottom of a 9x13 glass baking dish and 2 teaspoons of garlic to the gravy. Pan fried until brown then heated at 350 for an hour. Oh. My. Goodness. I cannot stop eating this gravy! The pork chops are so tender and moist. This is a permanent part of my pork chop recipes.

It went really well using Italian seasoning because I didn't have montreal on hand. The gravy was also really good with mashed potatoes. Will definitely add this on my list!

I foused pork tenderloin instead of chops. I coated the tenderloin in the steak seasoning, browned in a saute pan on both sides until crispy browned and then finished on the grill until temp reads 155-160 degrees. Transferred tenderloins onto plate and immediately covered with foil and let sit, covered, for 10 min before slicing. I made the sauce in a saucepan and added the drippings from the browned pork tenderloins into the sauce as it thickened. Once ready, I poured the sauce (and it was AWESOME tasting!) over top the sliced pork tenderloin. I served it with Cauliflower fritters (awesome low-carb substitute for potato cakes - recipe found here on All Recipes site) and a strawberry, spinach salad. GREAT MEAL!

This recipe is outstanding and incredibly simple to make! I added a little onion and garlic powder to my flour and only had liquid beef concentrate so i used that instead. So delicious! My pork was cut rather thin though so it could have been more tender, i would have had high high heat to sear in the beginning then cooked in the sauce afterwards. The medium heat wasn't browning my meat fast enough and the entire piece was already cooked. My only criticism because even being a bit tough, it was delicious! Served with some mashed potatoes and cooked vegetables, I'll be making this again!

Very easy and was delicious!  A bit salty for us so when I make it again I won't use so much seasoning and may be try low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon!

Great recipe!!! This is now my favorite way to make pork chops. My husband loved them as well, and he's a picky eater.

Easy and oh-so-good! Need to work on getting the chops more brown next time for aesthetics, but the flavor was delicious. Served with rice and steamed asparagus. The only issue with the recipe is that there were no leftovers!

I just made this for my boyfriend tonight, he absolutely devoured it! Big hit, was absolutely delicious. Instead of a beef bouillon I used beef stew mix, and I added a touch of garlic

Easy, tasty, delicious. The only thing I did differently was add a tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the milk. I followed the recipe aside from that. It was a big hit. The gravy is so good over potatos. The chips were succulent. This one is a keeper!

Very good recipie! I will make this again my famoly of six all agreed  it was delicious.  I did add fresh rosemary to the butter the last few minutes before the pork was done and pulled it out before adding flour. I only added it because t was on hand and Im sure it is good without it.

Since I was a kid I have always preferred my pork chops fried with salt and lots of pepper only. I love montreal seasoning on my steak but never thought of trying it on pork chops, it was fantastic. I've also never been a big gravy person until now. I absolutely loved this recipe. Anyone who didn't like or care much for this recipe either didn't make it correctly, or just doesn't like that particular flavor. I would like to note that when frying pork chops, frying in a well seasoned cast iron skillet makes a big difference in the taste.

loved the recipe.  used 4 thin pork chops so halved the ingredients.  worked out great - little salty but I'm a salt eater.  I also used the Better than Beef Bullion instead of granules.  Now my favorite recipe for pork chops. Thank you!

Yummy yummy in our tummies!! My boyfriend and I made this last night and it was DELISH! We used thick cut boneless pork chops, added mushrooms and doubled the sauce recipe based on other reviews of folks wanting more... and it was SO good! Highly recommend and was very simple to put together!

I needed a "different" recipe for pork chops so I tried this recipe exactly as is on Oct. 6, 2014.  Read the reviews and thought great, every review was most favorable.  My husband and I agreed this recipe was was not good and I promised never to make it again.  I used beef bouillion granules and it made the recipe extremely salted.

I was afraid the basil would be overpowering, but it wasn't.  I took another reviewer's advice and baked the chops in the sauce, which made them very tender and delicious.  My husband said, "This would be a good dish to make for company", which means he really liked it.

Not one of us cared for the sauce. The beef bullion seems really out of place and I wish I had switched out the basil for something more pork-friendly. I did enjoy the steak seasoning on the pork.

A hit with the family!  My husband doesn't usually like pork chops because they tend to get dry. Pan frying in butter resulted in perfectly done, juicy chops. Then add the gravy...yum! Served with mashed potatoes and green beans made this super kid friendly. All that leftover was about 1/2 cup of gravy. Success!

Overall I think it's very good.  I will cut back on the seasoning and I think it is too strong in pepper and salt.  I didn't have the Montreal brand so used a different steak seasoning and perhaps that is part of the problem.

Made this tonight for dinner. The pork chops were good and tender. Followed the advice about baking them for an hour. Made them super tender. Next time I will only use 1/2 tsp of pepper instead of 1 tsp. A little to peppery for me.

This recipe is amazing!  My pork chops were a thin cut so I had to reduce the cooking time to 5 minutes per side. So fast and easy, I will be making these more often-Thanks!

Only used 2 pork chops but kept the other ingredients the same.  I did not use the instant beef.  I found the sauce a little spicy  (? steak spice),  Served with mashed potatoes and  snap peas.  Husband says the recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I'm not a big fan of pork chops but this recipe just might change my mind. I used water instead of milk because I was out of milk. It turned out perfectly. I will definitely make this one again.

This was a really great meal. I must say I did a good job with it. I don't normall come out of my comfort zone with cooking. But I tried it for the first time, followed it to the tee and it came out great!!

Thought this made for some great pork chops! Had a ton of gravy left over from the first time I made it, so I froze it. Fried up the pork chops the same and warmed up the gravy with a little extra milk and it tasted just as good as it did the first time!

The only thing different that I did was:

-I omitted the additional seasonings and just added more Montreal seasoning which I placed in my spice grinder to make it a finer powder and concentrated flavors
-boiled 10 ounces of water to boil down the beef bullion cube.
-after that dissolved, added the 2 cups of milk to that and took off heat.
-after cooking down the chops, I added the milk/bullion mixture to the browned flour, which I used about 1/4 cup.
-this created more gravy which I needed because I cooked wide egg noodles and created a meal by putting noodles on the bottom, then thin stripes of the pork chops, then topped that with the gravy.  

YUMMAGE!

I tried this last night, cutting the recipe in half. I prefer to be my own guinea pig when trying new recipes since I am fairly new to cooking.  Turns out, I wish I had cooked it for a big dinner party.  It was so excellent!!  I did cut back on the pepper just a tad but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing it with us! So glad I have a left over chop for tonight!

Didn't care for it.  Took a long time for the chops to cook thoroughly.  Sauce was a bit bland.

Followed the recipe to a T.  Easy and very tasty.  My husband loved this country style gravy.  He couldn't stop talking about it!  Guess I'll be adding this to the rotation.
