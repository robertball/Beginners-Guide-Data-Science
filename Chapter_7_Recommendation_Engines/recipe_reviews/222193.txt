These are really crispy!  I wish I had watched the video before I made them - the recipe calls for the bread to be sliced 1/2" thick - in the video Chef John says 1/4" thick.  Does it really make a difference?  I think so, these are so crisp that the thick bread is difficult to bite through.  Thinner slices of bread would definitely work better.

These are excellent & SO simple! Of course, I knew I'd love them - they're from Chef John!  Had them with "beans n' greens" the other night and am making them again tonight to have with a plain salad (these will be the star!!) GENIUS putting the cheese on both sides...Thanks again, Chef!!

I add Italian herbs in with the olive oil and then top with a bit of coarsely ground sea salt and pepper.  Magnificent!

I printed 10 recipes for various garlic-type breads to serve with our Italian dinner last night.  My husband picked this one and we both loved how wonderful these Parma Crisps were.  We look forward to making these again and again.  I did take Baking Nana's recommendation to slice them to 1/4" thickness instead of 1/2" and that was a good call.

These were good, but I cheated and used butter instead of olive oil.  Next time I would not put cheese on both sides as it just fell off.  Prefer Parmesan Garlic Bread on this site.

This recipe was so easy to make and oh soooooo delicious! My family really enjoyed the crispy texture of the bread and there are so many toppings to make this recipe a hit .
