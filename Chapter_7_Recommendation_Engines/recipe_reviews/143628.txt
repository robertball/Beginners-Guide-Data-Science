I didn't need the extra water, I just wisked the cornstarch into the orange juice and the almond extract. I only used a tablespoon and a half of the cornstarch because I read through the reviews and one commented that it was a little too thick. This turned out really well, it was great over homemade whole wheat pancakes. Though I liked the almond extract, I think I'd like vanilla extract better. I'll use that next time.

This is a yummy basic sauce, and easily adaptable for other kinds of fruit. I've made strawberry and peach versions as well as the blueberry. I don't like Splenda, so I just used about 1/2 c. of plain old sugar. I also swapped vanilla extract for the almond extract, as I find the almond extract flavor a little too strong for my tastes. I originally used this sauce to spoon over slices of a lemon yogurt cake, but it's also fabulous with pancakes and ice cream. My husband even added some to a smoothie and loved it.

Absolutely Spectacular! I was looking for an alternative to store bought Blueberry Syrup which contains HFCS as the first ingredient and this was perfect! Family loved it over homemade whole wheat waffles!

Excellent on top of pancakes and waffles and it's a perfect substitute for blueberry syrup!

A GREAT recipe---with a few tweaks. First, 3/4 c Splenda is alot for my liking, and I like sweet things. I think I'd take it down to 2/3 or 1/2 c., and add more as needed during cooking.   Second, on the advice of a previous reviewer I did not use 3 Tblsp. of cornstarch, I used 2, and I used tapioca starch, which I think is more low-carb than cornstarch. The consistency was perfect---thicker than syrup, but still flowed nicely and served up beautifully on the gluten-free lemon pancakes I made this for.  Delicious!

Way too much cornstarch.  Instantly thickened it to a goopy consistency; nothing like in the photo.

I made this recipe and served it with a slice of pound cake I made. In the recipe I used 1/4 cup Gallo Twin Valley Chardonnay along with the juice & water and let me tell you it was delicious. I would rate it higher than a five if I could. As I'm writing you I have a blueberry almond coffeecake in the oven and I hope its just as good as the other recipe. I'll serve my sauce over it; for an added bonus. 
Thank you Mrs B

Easy and fast to make. If you're a college student like me, I did not have all of the required ingredients. I substituted lemonade for the orange juice and vanilla extract in place of the almond extract. There was a bit too sweet; I would cut down to 2/3, most likely 1/2 cup of sugar. This turned out very well. Will make again.

The orange juice was a little much and strange tasting with the blueberries. I use the 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, the sauce was pudding like I thinned it out with water
like suggested, I think you need about 1-1/2 tablespoon cornstarch, I think that next time I will use apple juice or a white grape juice.

Tried this last night for the first time.  Followed the recipe - well almost.  The orange juice and cinnamon were perfect compliments to the frozen blueberries in the sauce.  I did not have almond extract so used vanilla as suggested by others.  I don't have a comparison but it worked great.  For those sensible, healthy focused, and well mannered folk please stop reading at this point.  But for the others I paired this with the Glazed Lemon Supreme Pound Cake recipe found on this site.  It was terrific! Worked great together.  I even went so far as to add some cinnamon spiced homemade whip cream.   All family members that were served really enjoyed the combination.  They promised to feel guilty about it and wanted to know when I would be making it again.
