As far as Chourico and Peppers recipes go this is great!  Being part portuguese it's almost a staple at any family function.  I gave it 4 stars only because I find green peppers to be VERY overwhelming in this recipe.  I made it with red peppers and it was perfect!

Chourico and peppers is one of my favorites. This is a great way to prepare it......super easy. This is a great dish to bring to a party with some rolls.Chourico comes in hot and mild. Hot is just a little too spicy for me!

I have not made this...YET - so I'll give it four stars and update later. For the person who thought they might not have used the right sausage, here is a tip: Spanish Chorizo is fully cooked, and is in a casing similar to polish sausage. It slices/dices and can be added to anything, like cornmeal muffin batter with cheddar cheese.  Mexican Chorizo is RAW, and crumbles when cooked.  Excellent with scrambled eggs for breakfast burritos.  I look forward to trying this.

So easy, great on pop rolls or any crusty bread. I agree with a previous reviewer that using red peppers seems to taste better than green. Great traditional flavor.

Easy to make.  I served it on top of Basmati rice and it was a huge hit.  There was a lot of oil from the sausage but I drained it well before serving.  Suggest adding seasoning of choice like smoked paprika or Chipotle.

If you use the true Portuguese chourico sausage, it will not be oily.  The Spanish and Mexican chorizo are very different from the Portuguese chourico.  A mixture of various peppers makes this dish very colourful and appealing.

I used a Shiraz because I heard that when adding wine to a recipe, you should only use wine that you would drink.  I also substituted the green peppers for red peppers. I found this dish made the house smell amazing, however taste wise, it was  too sweet and I thought all that cooking time was not needed.

I actually made this in a skillet for a quick weeknight meal.  Started with chorizo then added onion, peppers then garlic. I deglazed the pan with white wine (personal preference) and then used some chicken stock and let it cook down a little.  I added the tomato paste when I added the stock and also threw in a can of diced tomatoes. I don't like green bell pepper so I used sweet yellow and it was pretty good over rice.  Thanks!

Lovely reminder of my time in the Azores.  Here's a tip . . . remove the skins from the peppers first for less pepper "bite" and a more silky mouthfeel.  Freezes well!

I made the big mistake of  believing I could get the same grinder fillings like what I enjoy in Fall River, MA, at Marcucci's on Bedford St. The tomato paste made the flavor "ketchupy".

Yum!  I sauteed the sausage in a bit of olive oil first, then the onions until soft, then the peppers.  Cooked for a bit then added garlic and a cup of frozen corn kernels.  Brought the wine and a cup of chicken broth to a boil, then cooked in oven at 250 F for an hour (I do not have a slow cooker).  It was delicious!

This is one of the best slow cooker recipes I have tried.  I made this to go over pasta so I didnâ€™t reduce the liquid as instructed and it was perfect.   I admit I was a little apprehensive about not browning the chourico but there is no need to because the appearance and taste was wonderful.

This was very good! I used turkey chourico and just cooked it in a skillet.  I used one green pepper and one red, and served it over rice.  Delicious!

I was not sure what to expect before cooking this.  I love all of the ingredients, so I figured I would give it a try.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe.  To give the most basic summary: It tasted very similar to a more common dish, Stuffed Bell Peppers (just with a little spice).

We had it both as a sandwich and over rice.  Since there was lots of liquid in ours, the rice worked a little better.

This was pretty ok.  I made it according to the recipe and tried it both on a bun, like a sloppy joe, and over mashed potatoes.  Served over mashed potatoes it is much better.  It wasn't bad but I don't know if I'll make this again.

This was delicious, I will give it 3 stars ONLY because I didn't follow the exact recipe.  I didn't have any red wine, so I used a wheat ale beer.  Also, I used red bell pepper instead of green.  I will use this recipe again!

Used fresh Sausage and it was awesome- very spicy but awesome. Had to add a bit of sour cream and some cheese for my 10 yr old to be able to eat it but my husband and I really enjoyed it. I think I might do 1 green and 1red pepper next time to maybe sweeten it up.

The recipe called for chorizo, which is completely different from Portuguese chorico. If made with chorico, it is spot on.  I do not like chorizo, it is differently spiced and rather crumbly

It came out like mush.  Almost like a meat spread. Maybe better with sliced meat instead of crumbled.

Very watery!  I followed the directions to a tee and it was just liquid.  I don't know.  I did not like the consistency,  but good flavor...for what it's worth.

Maybe I screwed this one up, and am being unfair in my rating.  All I could locate is the mexican type chorizo sausage, which is what I used.  The taste was not really pleasant.  I did not rate it lower because it may simply be that either we used the wrong sausage, or else it is just not to our particular tastes.
