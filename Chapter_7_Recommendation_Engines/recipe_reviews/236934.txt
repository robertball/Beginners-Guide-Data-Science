A good twist on the original recipe. The only thing I did different was I omitted the spinach and I used vitamin D milk for half and half.  We loved all the cheeses in this recipe.  Enjoy!

I love the marriage of flavors!  Next time I will make more cheese sauce o make it a little more moist.

Per the other reviewer's suggestions, I upped the half-and-half to 1/3 C, doubled the dill, and added a clove of garlic. I subbed swiss cheese for feta, and used a little bit more than called for (maybe 1/3 C?). I think if I make this again, I will substitute a different veggie for the spinach and add some onion, as well.

This was Ok and I will make it again, but with modifications.  Found it a bit bland so in the future I will try adding garlic and a bit more milk and dill.  This recipe is a good starting point

Quite good and different from the usual. I used skim milk and next time I would add a bit more to make it a little creamier
