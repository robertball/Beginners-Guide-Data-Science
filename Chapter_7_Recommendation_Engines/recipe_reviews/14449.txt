This is one of those recipes that you just know is going to be good as you're making it! Just excellent - beautiful, brilliant color, bold roasted red pepper flavor.  I imagine this has such versatility that you could use this for so many things other than as a salad dressing - a rich and luscious serving sauce for chicken or fish comes to mind for starters. I made it easy on myself and used jarred roasted red peppers, but why not? I also altered the proportions of oil and vinegar to the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio I prefer.  Exceptional and extraordinary.

Add a little parmesan cheese and some cream and you've got a great pasta sauce with any left over dressing.

Top notch!!  I never roasted bell peppers before, so I wasn't sure how to prepare them before roasting (cut in half? seeded?).  Just put the whole pepper in the oven (i.e., after rubbing on the olive oil).  I cut the fat in half by reducing the olive oil to 1/4 cup (and thereby reducing the red wine vinegar to 1/8 cup so it wouldn't be overwhelming).  I thought 3 cloves of garlic would be too much, so I reduced them to 2.  I added 1/8 tsp. salt, and 1/16 tsp. pepper.  I would make all these adjustments again - it turned out wonderfully!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an okay dressing. It was very thick and glumpy, way too garlicky and needed to be sweetened up. Probably wont make this again.

Very good dressing.  I used it as my dressing for a pasta salad.  I added a little more mayo and tossed the dressing with pasta, chopped roasted pepper, grilled asparagus, fresh mozzarella cheese, grated parmesean, kalamata olives and fresh chopped basil.

This dressing is fabulous.  It was super simple. It looks, smells and tastes wonderful, slightly sharp and tangy.  I took it to a potluck and received several compliments (1 from a "red pepper hater").  I also used it instead of mayo on wrap sandwiches - just wonderful.

This was a great starter recipe for me! My favorite version is with Balsamic vinegar instead of the wine vinegar, and i didnt put any mayo in. All blended together with some olive oil, salt and pepper, Parmesan cheese and red peppers YUMMY!!!

great easy and flavorful dressing. Fresh roasted peppers are just that much better although you can used jarred. Great on pasta, too, like another reviewer said.

I think this is a good jumping off point, but it didn't quite nail it for me.  Maybe some more garlic, a little lemon juice and...maybe a couple of blended kalamata olives?  I'll have to give that a try and report back!

This was pretty good dressing.  I'm a fan of vinegar so I liked how there was more vinegar than the traditional 3:1 ratio.  Makes decent-sized portions, probably enough for main course sized-salads.  I had side salads and have plenty to use again over the next few days.  A nice change from the usual Italian or ranch dressings.

Tip: after roasting peppers, while hot, place in a plastic grocery bag and tie. Letting them sit and steam this way makes the skin peel off very easy when cool enough to handle.

Delicious.  Could be used as dressing, marinade or a sauce.  I pan fried the peppers instead and I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar.  I also left the skins on.

I did not care for this, I am not sure if it was because of the oil or not? I had to throw it out but my husband said it tasted a lot like 1,000 island dressing if you added relish? Not what I was hoping, but thanks

Yummy!!  I used bottled roasted peppers and this turned out great!  I drizzled over grilled romaine lettuce, pecans, and a little feta cheese.  AND...it stayed good for a few days in the fridge!!

I used jarred red peppers I had on hand, and omitted the Parmesan cheese to avoid unnecessary calories AND it was a great dressing for my salad. It ended up being about 67 cals per tablespoon.

I made this to go on mixed salad greens, but I didn't like the consistancy for a salad dressing. It tastes really good, but I think I will put it on some broiled fish tonight. Thanks for the recipe.
