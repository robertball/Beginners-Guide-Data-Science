The video made it look so easy. Melting the two packages with one condensed milk was very difficult. Mine was not smooth and creamy and did not pour at all. It was like a glob. Nothing like the video showed. I melted it over very low heat. No clue what happened.

After reading the reviews on how difficult it was to melt the 2 packages of chips with the condensed milk, I decided to try a different approach. I first melted the chips in the top of a double boiler, then added the condensed milk.  With the double boiler there is no chance of the chips scorching.  It worked great!

I also had a little difficulty with the consistency. I cooked over low heat, and continued to stir the entire time. After about 8 minutes with still a big glob that did not appear to be melting down, I added about 1/3 of an additional can of sweetened condensed milk. At that point it started coming together more like the video- very creamy. And it sat up pretty good

This was awesomely easy! I've been too daunted to make fudge before, but there's no easier way to make it look like you did a lot of work. I did make the mistake of not letting the chocolate warm up enough. I was afraid of overheating it, but when I tried to swirl it into the vanilla, it just clumped up. I end up smearing it over the top. I thought it looked terrible, but once it was cool and cut up, no one noticed. They thought it was perfectly swirled. Will make again!

i believe that maybe a little more 60% cocoa chocolate pieces to make it better, a little too sweet with all of the white chocolate.
