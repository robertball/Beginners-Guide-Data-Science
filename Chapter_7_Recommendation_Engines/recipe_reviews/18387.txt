I have been making this eggnog ever since finding it in a Home Economics Cookbook "So- you are ready to cook" by Mary Ann Duffie.  
To the reviewer who gave a low rating because it was not "thick", this is NOT meant to be "thick", if you like it that thick, try using sweetened condensed milk.  
The only changes I made (to make 1 serving) I used 1 egg, 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 Cup of milk, 1/4 tsp vanilla, a few grains of salt, and added whipped cream and nutmeg for that special touch.  I have never had any issues finding egg chunks, as another reviewer mentioned.  I find it helps to thoroughly whip the eggs first
I am so glad I found this recipe, I was about to submit the one from my old cookbook.  It is definately the easiest egg nog out there, and I've never had any illness from consuming the raw eggs. Thanks for posting!

This is a good and easy recipe.  The main problem I had was that it is so good the way it is, I don't want to put the rum in it that I had intended.  I am afraid it may ruin the taste.  This is the first egg nog I have had that wasn't commercial, and the best!  I also used egg beaters and sucralose.  For those who want it thicker, I replaced about 1/2 cup of the low-fat milk with whipping cream.  I don't have a blender so I just put everything in a 20 oz. glass with a lid and shook it very hard.  I also added a couple of ice cubes to help thicken it more.  For those with the vanilla problem, it is probably imitation vanilla vs. real vanilla.  With the imitation you need to use more.  I used two teaspoons with just 20 ozs. and I still could hardly taste it.

It had pretty good flavour but we did have some problems with finding little bits of egg chunks while drinking....really gross.  I don't think it was the recipe's fault though...they were easily removed with a strainer.  Definately worth trying though...more rich than I would have expected with skim milk too.  -Em

The Eggnog tasted soo good, it was really quick to make and it took me a total of about 15 minutes to make it. This was my first time ever making eggnog and It was perfect the first time around, so easy that even a fourteen year old could do it and that's me!

This is the same recipe my Mom alwaysed used and it bring back such good memories. (I am 64) When I bought the kind in the carton I cut it with milk because I am so used to Mom's. I came on line to find just this recipe. I think this is how egg nog is supposed to taste, although I am sure Mom used whole milk back then brought from the milk man who came every other day to put bottles in the box on the front porch. They always added whiskey or brandy to it for themselfs with just a sip for us. Hope you like it, I am going to go make some right now and put a little brandy in it to drink while I cut out my cut out cookies from the recipe from my mother in law which are the best and I will post.

Very tasty egg nog.  I'm on a low carbohydrate diet.  So, I used artificial sweetener.  I also used cream in lieu of some of the milk to make it thicker.  I tried several of the other recipes and this one is very easy and closer to the taste I prefer.

I was skeptical of such a simple recipe.  But, it was FANTASTIC, and only took 5 mins at the most!!!It's not as heavy as store bought egg nog so you can actually have more than one glass!

I added a little rum, and used pumpkin pie spice in place of nutmeg - it was very good for quick and easy.  If you want it thicker, substitute heavy cream for half the milk. Or, separate the eggs, and beat the whites to stiff peaks, then fold in to the rest of the ingredients.

This is a simple, delicious recipe. I added more sugar so rather than 3T I mixed in about 1/4 cup) and it was perfect. I also put it in the freezer for an hour or so and then blended it again. Yummy!

Oh, this reminded me of my childhood! When we were little, my siblings and I enjoyed almost this exact recipe of Egg Nog around the holidays. My parents never bought the carton stuff, we had this! And the raw eggs never made any of us sick (although I'm not letting my daughter have some until she's older)... Good stuff. I had forgotten the exact measurements of ingredients, and now I know! If you are looking for a thick Nog, like that from a carton, you will probably be disappointed as this ends up much thinner. You could try adding whipping cream to thicken it. Or adding a little brandy might take your mind off the thinness. :) Thank you so much, Sara, for sharing!

I made this in just a few minutes.  It was delicious, much better than store-bought!  Plus, there was barely any clean up needed afterward.  I will definitely make this again!

I have been using a similar recipe for years (though I've lost my cookbooks in a recent move).  To make it thicker, as many people are complaining its too thin, my previous recipe used instant vanilla pudding mix instead of vanilla extract.  Very yummy either way.

This recipe is a tasty, easy to make treat during the winter season! I tend to enjoy my egg nog a little thicker than this calls for though so I use 2% milk and/or add either heavy whipping cream or sweet and condensed milk (and cut the sugar here). Also, just a note, the sugar 'cooks' the eggs by denaturing the proteins in both the yolk and egg whites, so you are NOT eating raw eggs.

It needed some modification. I added 1/2 pkg of vanilla pudding mix (dry) and 1 tsp of nutmeg. Then it had a rich taste and thickened eggnog up to the desired consistency. Wonderful, will use again with these changes.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This eggnog was the bomb! I am a BIG eggnog fan and was very excited to find a recipe that is so simple to make. I did change the recipe just a little. I wanted it to be a little thicker and didn't have any whipping cream on hand so I added a little corn starch, cooked the nog on medium heat until it left a thin coating on the back of a spoon. I then mixed it in a blender with a little more milk and some nutmeg. I have made it two days in a row. On the second day, I added a little bit of burbon whiskey for a little kick. Let me tell you, that made it even better! This is my new holiday favorite!

It tastes fine. But it doesn't look like eggnog, doesn't have the consistency of eggnog, and doesn't taste like eggnog. I'll keep looking for an eggnog recipe, but next time I'm in the mood for eggy vanilla milk, I'll make this.

I think this is excellent!!!!  I made this for 8 servings and used eggbeaters in place of the eggs.  I added more nutmeg per my own taste (about 4 dashes) , about 1 tsp. of rum extract and 1/2 packet of the regular size instant vanilla pudding, to help thicken just slightly.  Used 2% milk.  I love this recipe. It tastes like the store bought, but not so thick where it leaves a coating on your tongue and throat.  Eggbeaters keeps it healthier for all the little ones at my house and for the hearth healthy.  Will definitely make again and again.

I generally like my eggnog a little thicker, so I followed two of the reviewers advice and added half sweetened condensed milk (instead of all lowfat milk) and a 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla pudding mix. I also added a third egg. :) It was abolutely delicious!

This is so easy it makes me wonder why you'd buy it from a store.  I made it all in my blender and it was the perfect small batch before bed.  I will definitely make again.

Quick, easy, and yummy.  I made some changes, because I have trouble drinking milk, and I didn't want to give my kids raw eggs.  I used vanilla flavored Silk soy milk and pasteurized egg product (i.e. Egg Beaters) and replaced the vanilla extract with a capful of rum extract.  Like another reviewer, I added the tiniest pinch of salt, after tasting it first.  Then for a little thickness and flare, I beat pasteurized egg whites with a little sugar and rum extract until stiff.  I put a scoop of the egg whites in each cup.  You can also carefully fold the beaten egg whites in, or if serving in a punch bowl add dollops of the egg whites to the bowl before adding the nog.

It was good, but though the skim milk did cut out the fat and calories, it also took away the thickness that I love about eggnog. Next time, I will use 2%.

So it is Christmas Eve and we have run out of eggnog and the stores are closed - where do I turn - ALLRECIPES! May I say I was very pleased (as was the family) that I found this recipe. I made the single serving as suggested by another reader and it was VERY WELL received. I will be taking this to the family brunch! Who's the hero? ME (oh and you for posting this) Thank you and Merry Christmas!

It was very nice, so easy and fast! I used an electric mixer and it made it fluffy, even using non fat milk. I used sweetener insted sugar and my mom how doen't like it didn't notice. I also added a bit of cinnamon.

Very yummy!! Much healthier than store bought without all the HFCS, though still not really good for you. Next time I will try subbing honey for the sugar to increase the nutritional value. If this were thick instead of runny it would permanently replace store-bought eggnog. Oh, and I found that it is best to drink it within 1-2 days, otherwise it starts tasting kind of spoiled. Thanks for sharing!!

This is exactly the egg nog I had growing up. In fact the thick carton stuff leaves a sickening coating on my tongue so I rarely drink it. My Southern husband's family introduced me to the cooked version they call Boiled Custard, which is OK … but I love THIS recipe much, much better.

This is my first time making eggnog! It was quick and easy and yummy. I added cinnimon, nutmeg, and ground cloves. Make sure you blend it in an blender with plenty of room because it expands!

So yummy! I'm from CA and have only ever had the thicker, store-bought egg nog. However, my boyfriend (from IL originally) used to make egg nog with his mother and said this was an awesome version of the type that he was used to drinking. I used a 1/2 tablespoon of imitation vanilla extract and cinnamon instead, and added a bit of brandy to be naughty ;)

Soooo good. Not as thick as ones with cream obviously, but I'm lactose intolerant so this is amazing! I used soy milk and replaced the vanilla extract with rum extract. So good, even my sister liked it! It is very frothy but I still love it. I can hardly ever find soy nog and it's usually digusting. Now I never have to! Thanks!

I had no idea it could be this easy and fast. After making it a few times, you can just eyeball and adjust to taste; you could practically make it in your sleep. This time in particular, I used 2 cans of evaporated milk, half a fifth of rum, six eggs, and plenty of sugar and spice. Thanks for sharing!

This nog is tasty. I've been jonesing
for an eggnog latte since the end of 
the eggnog season, so I went looking 
for a homemade eggnog. 

This isn't as thick as I'd like but 
it's still good. I think I might
look for a thicker nog. This is not
a reflection of how good this recipe is.
It's just not what I was looking for. 
It does work in recipes that call for
eggnog, like pancakes or quick breads,
if you want to make eggnog at home 
and it's an off season.

So, if I need a quick eggnog to cook 
with, I'll be sure to make this again.

EDITED 06/19/08: I added two tablespoons
of instant vanilla pudding to thicken
this up, and it worked perfectly.

Has too little nutmeg and too much of a vanilla taste. It tasted more like a Vanilla malt than it did egg nog. After adding alot more nutmeg and letting it chill overnight it tasted more like egg nog, although it still had a strong vanilla taste because nutmeg just settled at the bottom. Recommend not using as much vanilla or no vanilla.

YUM YUM YUM. I couldn't believe how easy and fast this recipe was and for such a delcious taste. It is much lower in fat than normal eggnog and I enjoyed this aspect of it. Thank you for sharing.

This is a similar recipe that I got from a very good friend years ago. The only differnce is we add a half gallon of vanilla ice cream to the mix and use cinnamon instead of the nutmeg. Only this year I found cinnamon flavored ice cream made by Blue Bunny and used it. MMM is it ever good. I keep it in the freezer and serve it that way.

Thanks for sharing this!! Egg Nog has been, personally, my pregnancy drink of choice, and I was looking for a "refresher course" in making it. This is the simplest one I've found. Thanks!

This is the everyday egg nog that my daddy used to make.  I used this recipe with lactose free milk.  This is definitely not the creamy eggnog.  But it does have that great eggnog flavor.

My Mom, Grandma and Auntie liked the egg nog a lot ! they 

thought I did an excellent job for my first try. I am not a big 

fan of egg nog but my family loves it so that's why I made it.  

Your recipe is simple and delicious and if you don't have 

nutmeg (Like I did) you can use a couple sprinkles of  

cinnamon it tastes good to. Hope this helped.

Easy, sure, but the raw eggs freak me out a little.  I did try it tho, figuring the Jameson's we add would counter the salmonella...overall tho, I found it to be too thin and without the rich eggy flavor that makes egg nog.  It is by no means bad, we're enjoying it now, but in the future would take the time to make the "cooked" version.  Just not "it" for us.

This recipe is super easy for any beginner. I have never made egg nog before and it was so simple. I followed the directions and measurements exactly and it turned out runny. It tastes exactly like egg nog but I am going to try and thicken it up just out of personal preference.

This isn't a very thick egg-nog, and the spices are a little different, but it is delicious, a good healthier alternative! I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, just because I like it :)

Awesome recipe.  All the stores ran out of egg nog by Christmas day.  This recipe saved my butt.  I added a shot of E&J Brandy in a glass of it, added a little nut meg.  Stir it up and yummmmmmm.

Good, old-fashioned egg nog.  I used soy milk for my dairy-allergic family, and powdered eggs that were already pasteurized.

This was great!  My daughter didn't want to try it because she "doesn't like any kind of eggnog".  But she likes this one!  It is thinner, but it also has a fresher taste.   I used whole milk, and added a little cinnamon.

I was surprised -- this egg nog was wonderful and very fresh tasting!  I normally make Amazingly Good Egg Nog for Christmas since it is soooo rich, but my kids wanted egg nog for Thanksgiving.  Our first batch was gone in a flash and my 13 year old son said it was his favorite part of Thanksgiving!  We did use part half-and-half in this batch for extra creaminess.  Made a second batch later in the day with all skim milk and it still tasted wonderful.  Great recipe... we'll be using it often!

Ok I made a couple of changes and it turned out great.  The changes were I added another egg and simmered on med-low setting.  I had it while it was still hot and the flavor was awesome.  When trying new recipes I find you have to change a bit sometimes to suit your tastes.  I took off the white creamy part of the egg as it tends to make it lumpy but that did not take long at all.  Great recipe.  And does not take long to make it.  I decided to cook the recipe because my Husband is a transplant patient and I don't want to take any chances.  Thanks for the recipe.

In addition to the last post, in a blender, I combined one cup of this egg nog with one whole banana.  It thickened the beverage and added more flavor.

This recipe was great and so easy to make in the blender.  It was a little on the thin side for me so i simply added a few ice cubes in the blender to the recipe just prior to serving.  Thickens it up and does not dilute the taste at all.

Very good and very easy.  I did change it some though.  I am severely allergic to dairy products, so I used soy milk.  I'm hypoglycemic, so I used Splenda instead of sugar.  I also used EggBeaters instead of raw eggs, which eliminates the health risk.  I did think the vanilla was overpowering, so I made another batch, but eliminated the vanilla and added it to the first batch.  You can still taste the vanilla, so if you don't like a strong vanilla taste, you might only want to put 1/2 tsp instead of a whole teaspoon.  I used a hand blender which did thicken it up some.  It is still not as thick as the store bought, but this is a great recipe and I will definitely use it again!

This eggnog was as huge hit, especially with me. No fancy ingredients, so easy to make and loved by young and old at our family get-togethers. Can't get better than that. Thanks ever so much & have a happy holiday!!

Yes, if you are an egg nod aficionado there may be better, more exciting recipes, but this recipe really packs the punch. It is good right after it is made but so much better when left to chill over night. We substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg.

I LOVE this eggnog.  I've made ones where they called for cooking and had different spices and never liked the texture or the taste.  At first, I was very skeptical about the vanilla pudding being weird, but I've decided it's what makes the taste and texture right.  The longer you leave it in the refrigerator, the thicker it gets. On Weight Watcher's Freestyle an 8 ounce serving is only 4 points.  You can't buy that at a store!

Delish! For all of those who had a bad experience, here's a tip to help!
1. Beat the eggs first, and completely smooth with an electric beater with a whisk attachment or the regular beaters, or make sure you beat it completely smooth by hand with a whisk.
2. Add in the sugar to the eggs and mix it well for about a minute.
3. Add everything else and it's super smooth with no egg chunks!(: 

Thank you for this recipe! Simple and yummy!

This "Easiest Egg Nog" recipe is a good basic recipe for egg nog. I made mine with almost-flavorless neutral-tasting unsweetened dairy-free SO DELICIOUS ® coconut-milk beverage (instead of regular diary milk), and substituted the sugar with honey. I tried to reduce the sweetener, as is my habit, but found that I needed the full amount for a good-tasting egg nog. Thank you sal for sharing your recipe.

Was pretty good.  Very thin. Didn't taste much like store bought egg nog at all, more like vanilla nutmeg milk... But I like those flavors so it was still good. Will search for another more traditional recipe to satisfy my eggnog craving.

I loved this recipe a lot, it was easy to prep,make, and clean up. I made this recipe for my family and they enjoyed it as much as I did. I tweaked the recipe a little, instead of adding low-fat milk I used almond milk and I didn't add the vanilla extract. Though I changed these two ingridents overall I still felt like I made the best eggnog EVER!!!I have made eggnog using a different recipe,but it didn't turn out well so I was kinda of worried about how this wuld turn out. So I'm happy with this recipe and I look forward to using again sometime soon!

I just made this, hoping it would be as fabulous as the reviewers have said it is. I find it lacking. To me, it tastes like melted down vanilla ice cream someone accidentally put in the refrigerator instead of the freezer so they masked it with nutmeg and called it egg nog. It was super easy to make, and it doesn't taste horrible, it's just not what I would expect from an egg nog. I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe.

That's what I'm talkin' about! My dad used to make egg nog when I was a kid after we finished decorating the tree for Christmas. After a minor alteration (I substitued heavy whipping cream for slightly less than half of the milk and added a dash of cinnamon), I was able to replicate my favorite holiday treat :) Thanks for this recipe!

This is really good!  Even my 4 year old liked it.  I did make it with pasteurized eggs and Trader Joe's rice milk instead of regular milk. I don't usually like eggnog but I will drink this.  I think I was just not a fan of the very thick constistency of grocery store eggnog.

This is so easy to make, and tastes fantastic.  The only modifications that I made were to beat the egg(s) first, then add the rest of the ingredients, and also to add rum and brandy to taste.

Very easy and quite good.  I suspect the more effort-full recipes would also be more flavourful, but this tastes just great for something so quick!  Also no special ingredients.

It was bland as is. I made another batch which I fixed up a bit by adding whole milk, more nutmeg, a dash of clove, cooking it to presimmer to thicken and then added a bit more vanilla after cooling. And strained just incase. It came out more rich and creamy.

This "Easiest Egg Nog" recipe is a good basic recipe for egg nog.  I tried to reduce the sweetener, as is my habit, but found that I needed the full amount for a good-tasting egg nog. Thank you sal for sharing your recipe.

SO good. SO quick. SO tasty. I was reading an old mystery novel where a doctor whips up some eggnog for a patient and I noticed the eggs were not cooked so I looked for a similar recipe. Had this on a hot summer day and didn't find it too rich!

Hubby and I both really liked this. We followed the recipe almost exactly, but did put in a cup of heavy cream in place of some of the milk because I like things creamy. It tasted great, and was such a fun treat!

The flavor is great for a little added thickness I used 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup half and half and the rest milk. Flavor is amazing and it’s think but it’s delicious!

The store had no cream, or already made eggnog, so I tried this. It really needs heavy cream. It' s not terrible, but i'll not make it again.

My husband and I loved it. I used whole milk and replaced a cup of the milk with one cup of heavy whipping cream. I also had to add a couple of dashes of nutmeg as the cream covered the nutmeg flavor somewhat.  We will used this one again!

No changes. It taste like mildly eggnog flavored milk. While it is very thin, the thin texture wasn't the problem, it just lacked enough flavor. I drank about half a cup and threw it out.

Meh.  This was okay.  Really thin compared to any eggnog I've made or drank before, whether it was homemade or store bought.  It just didn't do it for me.  But the 8-year-old who attended my Thanksgiving really enjoyed this, as did one other adult.

Easy and it satisfies my need for holiday 'nog.

I used regular milk, inadvertantly, so it may have tasted even creamier... I'd do it the same the next time.

I also added a pinch of sea salt.

Biggest pro: very easy and simple to make.

Cons:  Not very flavorful.  Next time, I'm going to add another egg, more vanilla, and thicken it up by replacing some of the milk with cream.

My husband waits for fall to roll around every year to buy eggnog. I made this for him today and he said he will never go back to store bought again. 
I didn't have whole milk so I used  2 cups of 2% milk, and 1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream. Added a smidge more nutmeg.
Blended the eggs first in his ninja bullet and then added other ingredients, blended on Blend IQ for 2 cycles. 
Super amazing, and fresh tasting. 
Not worried about the raw eggs, but if you are you can temper them with heated milk and cook them over steam.  Enjoy.

This is the recipe I used as a teenager.  I would whip this up in the blender for breakfast almost every school day.  I just started adding Matcha tea to my low carb diet and have been making frappucinos but I ran out of collagen protein powder so it occurred to me to use an egg instead.  Then I thought egg nog and found this recipe.  Needless to say, I added 1 tsp Matcha to this and substituted coconut mile and heavy cream for the milk and added several ice cubes.  I cannot tell you how good it tastes!!

I only enjoy hot eggnog. So I avoided any concerns with raw egg by combining everything in the blender and then heating on the stove until 140°, hot but not boiling. Add rum and it is the best winter cocktail ever.

We used unsweetened almond milk and we love it!  We don't like a thick eggnog, so it was just right and so easy to make.  You have to blend the eggs first and all the other ingredients thoroughly.

It was pretty great, and I added an extra egg for thickness and I cooked it with starch after blending it. Then, I added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and milk and blended it again. Have to agree with the people who say that it's too much like vanilla milk thing but still, overall, simple, easy, good, but could use more egg. Thanks for the recipe!

Just like I remember it growing up!  So easy and delicious.  Kids love it.  You might try a dash of cinnamon to replace the nutmeg.  We did and love it even more.  If you do it correctly and understand how a hand mixer works or even a blender, you won't find egg chunks in your drink.  Quite a simple process actually.

Why have I been buying egg nog all these years?! My kiddos wanted to toast egg nog for New Years but every store was sold out. I make so many things from scratch so I figured it would be silly not to try this. Boy, am I glad I did! I used 2 cups of 2% milk, 1/4 cup white sugar, and cut down on the vanilla as I have very pure extract.

Followed recipe to the letter. Epic failure. Using milk for an eggnog recipe is a BAD idea. Grt intention I'm sure not such a grt idea however. Consistency is too thin and flavor is overpowered by milk.

Made it tonight and loved it. Didn't have nutmeg so subbed cinnamon, so a different flavor, but just sweet and thick enough. Will try again with nutmeg and rum flavoring.

I prefer eggnog on the thick side so I utilized some  of the recommendations from other reviewers: added 1/4 c. of vanilla instant pudding,   and a couple of ice cubes. Although these additions helped to thicken it a bit,  It was still on the thinner side,  With a "few" dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.  I got it  to the point that i really liked the flavor.    Next, I will put it in the freezer and re-blend to see how thick that makes it.

I added an extra egg because it kind of just tasted like sweetened milk. I also added extra nutmeg. It was as thick as you could expect from eggnog with no cream in it.

I first made the recipe as written using fresh eggs from my farm. It was way better than any store-bought nog. I now make single servings by halving the recipe and just shaking everything in a tumbler. Very quick, easy, and delicious.

So quick and easy to make. I made it with whole milk, and substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg because that is what I had on hand. It tasted great for such a quick and simple recipe. I will be making it again.

I definitely will make it again. I recommend using a blender or something of that sorts. Unless you like chunks of eggs. It was fantastic. It almost tasted like ice-cream! It was amazing. Yummy!!!!

It wasn't as creamy as I would have liked, so I put a third egg in there, and also replaced the sugar with maple syrup(with a little extra thrown in there for fun. The result was super good and creamy and maple-y

The recipe is good the only thing I did was add instant pudding the whole packet like jello the only flavor I had was cheesecake but I'm sure vanilla will thicken it right up.

I'm sure there are other variations of this age old recipe...but it takes me straight back to my childhood. My mom would make this for us and it was always a treat. My favorite part was the bubbly milk mustache...yep, when I'm alone, I still do it. I think she added just a touch more sugar. To me this tastes a lot like a melted McDonald's vanilla shake...but oh so good.

Very quick recipe with good flavor & consistency. If you want a thicker eggnog, separate the eggs. Beat the whites until they have peaks. Beat the egg yolks until they are light yellow. Then blend the two together slowly and carefully.  You will not have problems with "egg chunks" if you use fresher eggs. Because this is a raw product, I personally recommend organically certified eggs.  The eggsafety.org can help you source fresh, safe eggs.

Being an Australian, this was my first ever attempt at egg nog at Christmas and I have to say the recipe is great!
I have nothing to compare this to however, I will concede that I almost trippled the booze content (monkey shoulder whiskey) so that I could taste the kick. 
Will definitely make this again!

I just made it tonight because my papa ran out of eggnog store bought.  I did not have nutmeg so I used cinnamon instead but it tasted good.  I would give it four stars not because it is not good, just not the BEST THING EVER, I loved it though!

We loved this! I whipped it up in five minutes and my entire family (husband, 2- and 4-year-olds) devoured it. We topped it with some whipped cream and I look forward to making it again with some thicker ingredients (at my husband's request) and some alcohol for some extra holiday "cheer." Ha!

I read some reviews before making this, which led me to taking some extra steps, then I personalized it a little bit. For a 5 minute egg nog, not bad!

Since I only had imitation vanilla on hand, I ended up using 1 TBS. I only drink non-fat milk, which was too thin here, so I took someone's advice and added ice cubes. I also whisked the eggs very well before adding them to the blender. Used 1/2 sucralose 1/2 sugar.

I taste-tested, and found that a pinch of nutmeg didn't make a dent, and nutmeg alone, for me, doesn't work. So I added 1/8 tsp each of nutmeg, cinnamon, ground cloves, ginger and allspice, a/k/a pumpkin spices or molasses cookie spices. They are my favorites, always have them. I could've put more in, but subtle's okay tonight.

I like it when I use my bullet to blend it because the bullet really leaves no chunks of egg, however, I would like it a little thicker, wonder if one more egg would do that?  PWR.

Easy and delicious!  I added ice because I like a very cold egg nog.  This also thins it out a bit- which I prefer.

My aunt had a craving and mentioned it :) so I whipped this up for us. I tripled the recipe with a bit less sugar and milk and added 2 extra eggs (used 8 instead of 6) ....awesome!  :)  thanks for this ...big hit!

I've made this multiple times and it is delicious exactly as is.  A stick blender makes it quick and easy.  To cut down on sugar I use 1T sugar and 1/4t. liquid stevia.

I just whipped up a serving of this in my individual sized blender and absolutely loved it. Yes, it wasn't as thick and creamy as commercial egg nog but the flavor was wonderful and using the blender made it nice and frothy. Definitely using this again soon!

I made as directed and then tried it, not to my liking.  I added and additional teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 more tablespoons of sugar and a bit more nutmeg.  That made it taste better to me.  It is now in the fridge getting chilled.  We'll see if my wife likes it, I'm sure the kids will like it.  ByTheWay I like thick egg nog.  If you want to have thick egg nog you may want to try other ideas from other posts or a different recipe.

I thought this recipe was too thin, and rather bland. Egg nog should be thick and creamy this is very watery, and yes the nutmeg adds a little flavor but it needs more then just what it calls for.

Replace raw eggs with equivalent of "Egg Beaters" for a safe drink without losing any flavor.  I like to add a dash of cinnamon to the top of finished drink.

I don't like this, at all. I love egg nog except for the fact that its so thick. I used whole milk so maybe thats my problem, but I truly believe it needed to be thicker, sweeter, and taste less like raw eggs. The raw egg taste is so over powering I added extra of everything and was still not pleased.

I made with skim milk and egg beaters. It was very runny (basically the same consitency of 1% milk), so next time I would recommend making it with whole milk.   Very nice taste though!

This has got to be the best tasting thing you can make in 3.5 minutes.  All I did was take a waterbottle and throw everything in and shake it up.  It was a-mazing... and I even made it wrong (I put in 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of sweetened condensed milk instead of the regular milk... good thing I have a sweet tooth, cause it's loaded!  Don't try that at home unless you like a sugar high...  I think I'll try it next time with 1 cup milk and one cup cream, or just half-and-half.)

Well this isn't bad.  Not quite as flavorful as the stuff my aunt makes but it's pretty  close.  Plus it was easy enough to make with stuff I just had around the house.  Cool, thanks.

I wanted to make an eggnog that was healthier so I used this recipe as a base. I'm sorry I'm going to be one of those people who totally changes the recipe and then writes a review... I really didn't change it that much, though. :)  Instead of egg, I used egg beaters to cut back the calories and cholesterol. I beat the sugar into the egg beaters, mixed in a dash of nutmeg and tsp of vanilla and a TBLS of Rum. I heated the skim milk in  a double boiler with cornstarch to thicken (I used a tsp this time, but next time I might use a little more [mix equal parts cornstarch and cold milk before adding to the double boiler]). Used the double boiler so I wouldn't scald the milk and change the taste too much. heat just until you see a few little bubbles. remove from heat and let the milk cool enough so when you add to the egg mixture it doesn't cook the eggs. mix everything together and chill until cold. garnish as desired and voila...healthier and thicker version of this recipe.  Still not as awesome as the real stuff from the store but a pretty decent alternative.

I think it is really cool to see this recipe on here.  This is the way my mother made it for us growing up, in fact the first time I had even had store bought egg nog, I was like in 6th grade.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is the best homade egg nog I have ever tried.  Delicious!  My family used to buy something called custard nog, which I liked much better than traditional egg nog... this recipe tastes very similar, just not quite as thick and creamy!

I thought this was great! I took the advice of one of the reviews and used vanilla pudding powder rather than vanilla to thicken it up. Also, to lower the fat content I used three egg whites instead of two eggs! I think this will be one of my staple recipes!

I thought this recipe was great! I prefer my egg nog thicker but it still tastes great. Easy to make. I only had imitation vanilla extract so i used 3tsp of that. I love it!

My 12 year old made this by himself and he said it was fantanstic!  He said he added a little more sugar...but then he likes things sweeter than the average person.

I used this recipe as the base for my first try at making egg nog.Because of special diet reasons I used egg beaters and artificial sweetner. I added instant sugar free pudding mix as needed to thicken it a little. I also used cool whip free for a more creamy consistancy. It's all a matter of personal taste. Great starter recipe for anyone "as is" or with additions.

I thought this recipe was great!  I like a more mild, light eggnog so I thought it was perfect.  My husband thought it was better than average, but nothing special....he likes the thicker, more flavorful kind.  I also added a bit of cinnamon, I thought it made it complete!

This was good for its simplicity. I suggest if you are planning on making something small for yourself to try this recipe, However, if you plan on making this recipe for more than a couple, try a different "heavier" or thicker eggnog.

I thought this eggnog was delicious, in fact I made it twice. but I prefer the thicker, richer eggnog.

I use EggBeaters for this recipe.  That way the eggs used are pasteurized so anyone can drink it.  It is a favorite all year round as it is so easy to make.

this is good...very quick. A lot thinner than what you would get in the store (so i guess thinner than what i'm personally used to) but it's good!! 

I'm looking forward to see what it tastes like after having been chilled overnight :-D

I personally am not a big fan of egg nog but I was making it for my boyfriend and I had my mom try it first to see if it was good.  She was it was alright and that it kind of just tasted like milk.  But, it was very quick and easy to make.

I made this for my husband and son who LOVE egg nog at Christmas time. They did not seem to like this egg nog as much as the one you can buy at the store. But they did ask me to make more the next day.

I looked up this recipe and in five minutes my kids and I were enjoying delicious egg nog! I used my hand blender to mix, which made it thick and frothy. I served with extra nutmeg on top of each serving. I also used egg beaters egg substitute to avoid using raw eggs. It turned out great! I am only giving it 4 stars though, because, I personally would like it to be a little thicker. I will try using half and half next time instead of 2% milk.
