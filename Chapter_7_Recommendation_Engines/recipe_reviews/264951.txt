The first granola I ever made and it was very delicious. Just a bit too sweet for my taste, will reduce the amount of sugar and syrup by a litte next time.

Amazing, and so easy! I made it with dried coconut the first time, and it was an awesome combo. This has become a go-to recipe, and I’m so glad it showed me how easy granola is!

I was looking for something akin to Cocoa Krispies and this was pretty close. I didn't use Cayenne. The final result seemed really salty so I might cut that in half next time. 5 stars to the hilarious video though. Thanks for the laughs.

This granola was good, but it's you want to add fruit, don't mix it in, add it after baking.

Brilliant!!  I was looking for a recipe similar to the spicy chocolate granola Sprouts used to sell in bulk.  This is exactly the same.  Very forgiving - my splooshing wasn’t as good as photos- and I really amped up the cayenne as that what is so good about this granola, IMO.  Thanks!

This is an amazing granola recipe.  I’m going to try it with almond milk for breakfast. It tastes really good by itself too. It would be great for a yogurt parfait too

I added coconut, flax meal and peanuts, just a bit more cocoa and stevia. A delicious and nutritious recipe!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I did think it was a bit too sweet the first time I made it, so I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 c. It could probably be cut back a hair more, but I didn't want to incite a riot in my house. I share this recipe with whomever I know would enjoy it. I do leave out the pepper, sorry, Chef John. :-) I also use coconut oil. I can't count how many times I have made this recipe, and I always make a double batch. Thank you for the recipe.

Sooooo yummy!! I didn't have maple syrup on hand (Canadian-I know,very sad.) But I opted for corn syrup instead and it came just as yummy! I added chocolate chunks from the Chipits bagged collection,since chocoholicism runs deep in our veins :P

Uh oh!  So awesome!

Substituted Splenda for brown sugar, but still used maple syrup. Al so used the coconut  oil mentioned in the video.

Cayenne!  Next time I'll try 2 dashes!  Heading out to get yogurt for tonight's parfait.
