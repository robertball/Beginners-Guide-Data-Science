You can, and should, make this even if you don't have a deep fryer.   Pour the oil into your deepest saucepan, and heat it on high.  Peanut oil burns at a temperature much hotter than most vegetable oils, so it's got to be heated on high.  Using your longest tongs, put a small clump of spinach in the hot oil and keep it there- you need to use the tongs to keep the spinach submerged or else it will float to the top of the oil and won't fry correctly.  The fried spinach should be really dark green, light and airy, and it should just melt in your mouth. It's a nice complement to heavy meats and fish steaks. By the way, it so quick that you can make this recipe literally at the last moment, as food is being carried to the table.

In experimenting with this unusual recipe, my colleagues and I felt that while the idea is novel and the product is potentially shatteringly crisp and tasty, the instructions could perhaps benefit from some enhancement. At the outset, it is essential that the spinach leaves be thoroughly and completely dry. Guard yourself against the normal spattering of oil that can occur with a moisture-laden vegetable such as spinach. Of equal importance is the choice of oils: while peanut oil is a good choice, especially for flavour, if you have access to grape seed oil, do try it for its light taste and high smoke point. Experiment with the frying time; some of the leaves will fry crisp in 5 seconds, some will take longer. The ones that we let go for 30 seconds were overly done. Employ the use of a cooking thermometer as the temperature of the oil will drop with each frying event. Finally, do sprinkle not only with salt and pepper but also with finely grated parmesan cheese.

I use this technique with fresh sage leaves, basil,or flat leaf parsley. Now that I've made this recipe, I bet it would be great using swiss chard or radicchio too. It's gonna spit when it hits the hot oil, so BE CAREFUL! I like to use fried herbs or greens as a garnish when I'm trying to impress the family or friends. Yes, I'm shallow that way:o):o):o)

This is a great dish.  It's a huge hit here in St. Louis, although we sprinkle parmesan cheese over the flash-fried spinach instead of using salt and pepper.  What a treat!

We did not care for, some spots were cripsy while others were kind of spongy. Although we like spinich and I am trying to find new vegetable ideas, this was not one of them.

This sounded crazy, but I had to try it. I had to use Canola oil for frying though, as I didn't have any peanut oil on hand. But they still turned out good, really light and flakey. Like another reviewer said, it literally melts in your mouth.

This is a yummy and different way to make spinach. I have never heard of spinach being deep fried and am glad I tried this recipe in my new deep fryer.  I used vegetable oil because I did not have peanut oil.  I found that the spinach tasted best when I fried it in small batches for 30-45 seconds and when the spinach was chopped into medium/small pieces. When I put in large pieces of spinach I would leave it in the deep fryer  for a longer amount of time but it just did not come out as light, airy, and crisp as the other pieces. I ate the spinach alone sprinkled with salt and pepper and think it would be great in the future on salads or as a side to fish/chicken with fresh lemon squeezed on top. Thanks for a unique and tasty twist on spinach :)

This is a twist on a Japanese recipe. Try it with Bok Choy instead. Also, add slices of fresh garlic with the Bok Choy. If you have Ponzu sauce at home its not bad to dip in.

This side dish is awsome.  Heat oil to 380 so when u add spinach it's still hot.  Cook maybe 30 sec and do not put to much in at a time. Take out and hit with lemon juice and parmesean.  Serve immediatly. Have to use fresh spinach, right out of garden is the best.

OH MY GOODNESS!! Let me say growing up in the south, I hated vegetables because they were overcooked and literally made me gag. This dish melted in my mouth. I took the advice of others. I cut the spinach in strips, made sure my oil was at least 300 and cooked for about 20 seconds.  I seasoned with sea salt and parmigiano cheese.  I LOVE VEGGIES NOW! :)

This is very similar to a side dish I used to order at a chinese resturant in Chicago. I just moved to Florida and I miss it so much. I tried this recipe using spinach and Bok Choy leaves. It is wonderful!!! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

For the parts that were crispy, this was very interesting, but it's important to make sure the oil temperature remains high between frying events otherwise the spinach comes out soggy.

I rarely give bad reviews, but this one is absolutely terrible.  I love spinach...raw and cooked/wilted.  But this just tasted like paper with a funky aftertaste.  I will not be doing this again.

This is a nice fried  Indian appetizer.  Fried spinach tastes good. As other reviewer's noted push the spinach down while deep frying.  Perhaps coat the spinach leaves with a flour/spice batter before deep  frying.  Also, a  spoonful of  a mixture of diced tomato/ diced red onion/diced fresh cilantro/sugar /rice vinegar on top before serving adds a nice counterpoint. Canola rather than peanut oil may provide a better smoke point and may be more flavor neutral as well.

my favorite local restaurant makes crispy spinach that is to-die-for! Even my kids gobble it up! I've been trying to figure out how to make it at home so I was so excited when I found this recipe! I agree with many other reviewers though that some (not much) of it was perfectly delicious &  crispy, but most of it was kind of drenched in oil and soggy mush. However, I am going to keep trying to get this one right because when it is cooked correctly it is so incredibly delicious!

The China Grill in NYC  has had this on their menu forever.  My all time favorite. They use a huge wok to make it(with peanut oil) and still have to back off when the spinach is added. They just salt it and serve it. I've tried it at home and it's not quite the same because I don't have the huge flame in big wok.

Not bad but you need to take care to ensure that the spinach cooks evenly...not as easy as you may think.
