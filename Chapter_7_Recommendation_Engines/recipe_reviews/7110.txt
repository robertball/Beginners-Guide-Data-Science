I think my brother-in-law would refuse to celebrate Christmas if I didn't bring this for Christmas morning! He always asks me "are you going to bring that cinnamon thing?" I have found that I have more success making this in a tall sided 9x13 pan than in a tube pan. For some reason when in a bundt pan I can't get the center completely cooked. One secret I have discovered to getting the center done without overcooking the edges is to cover the pan with foil after 15 minutes of cooking. It comes out perfectly that way. I let my rolls thaw enough to cut each of them into 3 or 4 pieces before assembly so I get a better distribution of cinnamon mixture throughout the dough. I also discovered that it works better to use non-instant pudding and combine it with the sugar and melted butter in a saucepan then sprinkle each layer of rolls with cinnamon and pour the sugar/pudding/butter mixture over the top. I think this is really at its best when served warm or on the same day it is baked.

I read through some of the reviews and decided to mix a few things up. I used cooking pudding, cinnamon, brown sugar, butter & pecans. I let the rolls soften up enough to cut them in halves. I melted the butter (1 1/2 sticks plus 1 c brown sugar) added the BS and the cinnamon and gently warmed until it came together. Then I added the pudding. I sprayed the bundt pan with Pam, sprinkled a few nuts & brown sugar on the bottom and then layered in about 1/2 of the rolls. I covered this with about 1/2 of the butter mixture and a few more nuts. Then the last layer of rolls, butter mixture and just a tiny bit of nuts. Let it sit out overnight (it was pretty high the next morning). Put it into a 350 degree oven and baked for 15 minutes then put foil on and baked for about 20 more minutes since it was pretty full. Then I turned off the oven and let it sit for about 10 minutes before I turned it out. Wonderful! No sticking to our pan (a pampered chef bundt pan) and it was baked all the way through!! The family could not get enough of it! Not gummy or dry in any areas. I think we will have to do this one again for Christmas morning although it might be a hard choice between this and our traditional orange ring! This was much easier to make since you do it the night before! I would definitely suggest melting the sugar/butter/cinnamon together and then when a bit cooled add the pudding in and mix very well. It was awesome! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent. Like a previous reviewer, I didn't think it was going to work because the mixture looks so dry but I'm a believer now! I found this to be very gooey and delicious. I cut each roll into 4 pieces with kitchen shears which allowed more edges to be coated with the mixture.  I will definitely make again.

I have made this every Christmas and New Year's eve for more years than I care to admit! It has always been a favorite of the family to have these hot dribbling rolls on Christmas morning and open our "Santa" presents. I use 1 pkg. Bridgford frozen rolls, 3/4 white sugar, (but will try brown sugar next time), 2 TABLESPOONS Cinnamon. I also use COOK NOT instant butterscotch pudding and pecans instead of walnuts.  They are easy and truly delicious!

I am only giving this recipe 4 stars due to the fact that I too did not like the clumps of brown sugar/butter.  I prefer a more gooey bread and have had it that way in the past.  Every time I have tried to make Monkey Bread I have not had much success, but this was closer than any other I have tried.  I didn't have time to read all the reviews before I made the recipe, but I too agree that cutting the rolls into 4 pieces and dipping them in butter would work out better than pouring the butter over the mixture in between layers. I even double the amount of butter because I thought the mixture looked dry before I baked it and it still turned out clumpy and crunchy.  I think there is too much of the brown sugar/butterscotch mixture also.  But I can't wait to try the recipe again, as it did have an excellent flavor and will get better each time.

This was soo delicious!! It was very simple to make. Frozen bread dough works so much better than the refrigerated biscuts and not as time consuming as the yeast rolls!! I will have this in my recipe box for a long time!!

Not sure how to rate this.  My kids liked it.  I didn't care for the chunks of hard, buttery sugar.  I have a similiar recipe which calls for the pudding mix and brown sugar to be dissolved in the melted butter, along with 2 tablespoons of milk.  If I make it again, I will also cut each roll in half, as they grow quite large overnight.

I've been making Monkey Bread for years using almost this exact recipe (mine does not call for any white sugar & only a 1/2 cup of brown), but the major difference is that I've always used cook & serve butterscotch pudding.  I've been having trouble finding it, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  Next time I find cook & serve in the store I will stock up because it is soooooo much better.  Much more ooeey gooey.

Wow..this stuff is just like Cinnabon.. it is great. Be sure to use the correct BIG pan or you will have a mess. It makes a huge amount so maybe cutting it in half so you dont have a bunch left over and can make fresh each morning would be good. IT is A MUST. Sweet, sticky and a real comfort food.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made this on Christmas morning also, and everyone went wild over it.  A couple of comments - you don't really need quite that much of the brown sugar/butterscotch mixture.  It certainly doesn't hurt the recipe at all, but you could get by with less.  Also, I would suggest holding a little of the brown sugar mixture and the cinnamon mixture back so that you can sprinkle some of it (and a little butter) over the buns after they have risen in the pan - prior to cooking them.

This deserves more than 5 stars!  I was worried about leaving the dough out un-refridgerated all night.  But it tasted great and nobody got sick, so I guess it's OK.  Like other reviewers I cut each roll into quarters.  To make sure that the sugar and pudding were easily distributed I mixed the sugar, cinnamon and pudding in the same bowl then coated each piece of dough in it.  Layered them in the pan, after the first layer I sprinkled more of the sugar mix on top then poured half the butter and half of the nuts over it.  Repeat with the next layer.  I ended up useing about half of the sugar mix because I was worried it would be too sweet, but next time I am going to use more.  And I will probaly use extra butter to dip the dough into before I coat with the sugar mix.  I cooked it for about 20 minutes and let it sit 10 minutes.  It was cooked perfectly, no burnt or crusty top, just gooey sweetness.

It's not every day your boyfriend comes home and makes it a POINT to tell you how good something was.  This recipe is SOO good!  He loves anything warm, gooey and sweet, and this is all that and more.  Microwaving the leftovers makes it warm and gooey all over again. This could be sold at Cinnabon!!!  I also did not use all the brown sugar/butterscotch mix.  THANKS!!!!

This recipe was so fast and easy!  I took it to work and it completely disappeared in 10 minutes.  The really odd thing is that it seems like this recipe shouldn't work because it doesn't have much liquid in it.  I'm also not a big butterscotch fan, but it didn't really have a butterscotch flavor to it.  It tastes like one of those huge sticky buns you pay $3 for in the mall.

This monkey bread is GREAT but I only gave 4 stars because the first time I followed the recipe EXACTLY and I got uneven dry spots and gooey spots and my family would barely touch it. But the 2nd time I made it for a brunch and this time I melted the butter, dipped dough pieces in this order before putting in pan; butter, butterscotch mix, cinn/sugar mix. Also I layered the dough, butter, cinn/sugar, and butterscotch mix more times than directed and used pecans instead of walnuts in one batch and no nuts in another. EVERYONE WENT CRAZY FOR IT!! I can't go to a potluck without getting harrased now for it! ;D

Yum.  Trust the recipe.  First time, I bought a bag of 36 rolls (3 lbs), making 1 1/2 lbs 18 rolls.  Well, 9 rolls on the bottom didn't look like enough, so I changed it to 12 for each layer.  Was okay, but dry.  Next time, 9 rolls allowed for stuff to be more gooey.  Thanks for a great (but easy) recipe!

I've made this recipe for several years.  24 oz. is 18 frozen rolls (1/2 a pkg. of Rhodes rolls).  I just dump it all in my angel food cake pan and it is a perfect fit.  Brought to my Bible study this morning and it was quickly consumed.

Could only give this 5 stars with motifications.  I did follow some of other reviewers suggestions.  First, I DID NOT use 24 oz of dough.  Since cutting the balls into 4 pieces each I only use about half the bag or 12 -14 ozs.  My pan was only 1/3 full before the rising began.  I did roll each piece in melted butter and the cinnamon sugar.  I cover bottom of bundt pan and then sprinkled some butterscotch pudding over rolls.  Continued until my pan was 1/3 full.  It was a very cold day when I tried this and was concerned about the rising so I did this during the daytime.  I put in oven for noon until 6pm.  Before baking I melted another quarter stick of butter and drizzled on.  I also cut  back the cooking time by 10 minutes.  The "bottom and top" did not get too brown and I had no gooey centers.  This can out of pan very easy after sitting 10 minutes.   My family DEVOURED immediately and have already requested it again soon!

Quick and wonderful!  I made my own dough so before I froze them I also cut them up into 36 pieces vs. the 18.  Instead of dipping the rolls in melted butter I just added some small dabs of butter all over the sugar mixtures in each layer to help aid in the brown sugar melting instead of staying clumpy after baked.  Excellent recipe.  Easy and Delicious, everyone loves it!

I made this recipe for a baby shower brunch and it turned out great.  I did take the earlier advice and dip the frozen rolls in butter before putting in the baking pan.  I will be making this recipe for years to come!

I must have goofed!  I was so excited to try this recipe and the dough was very dry. Next time I may try using the biscuits in the tube not the frozen kind.

So good!!!  Made a few changes as other users suggested:  Cut the rolls into 4ths, used cook and serve pudding, 2 Tbsp cinnamon, pecans insead of walnuts and used a 9x13 pan.  I also combined the pudding, sugar and butter in the saucepan and I didn't use all the mixture.  Also covered w/foil after 15 minutes in the oven.

I took a hint from some of the other reviewers here and did the following: *substituted 2 cans of refrigerated biscuits for the frozen rolls *combined sugars, pudding, cinnamon, walnuts and butter--plus added a splash of vanilla *cut biscuits in eighths, rolled in mixture and arranged in 13x9 pan

The result was delicious! I brought it to a moms' group potluck and it was one of the first dishes to disappear. Several people even asked for the recipe.

Thanks for this tasty, easy-to-make contribution!

I'm embarassed to say it has taken me 2 years to submit a review on this recipe -- it is a true "go-to" in my house, when the time calls for something special. It's easy, impressive-looking, smells PHENOMENAL, and everyone gobbles it up. Although other reviewers said that this recipe needs some adjusting to turn out, I actually follow it to the word, and it's always perfect. Refrigerated rolls are absolutely NO substitute to frozen, because only the frozen ones rise. To avoid clumping, I say just sprinkle the sugars gradually, and pour the butter slowly. Thank you for this fantastic addition to my recipe box!

The bread is good but would have preferred a more "sticky bun" like product.  The pudding and sugar mixture turned out more like  a filling, nothing like a caramel glaze.  I am going to try using more butter the next time.

I have had this every Christmas morning for the last 30 years.  It is without a doubt the best breakfast dish I have ever had.  This is one Christmas tradition I highly suggest picking up.

This is the BEST cinnamon roll-monkey bread recipe I have ever tried.  Everyone LOVES it.  This is a keeper.  I did find that I like to dip each bun in melted butter before assembling though.  It seems to make it more gooey.

I made this last night and baked this morning and took to work while they were still warm. MmmMMmmMM. So good. I followed the advice of others and melted a stick of real butter then dipped each roll and placed into a 9x13 glass dish. Then I placed the brown sugar and vanilla pudding mix into a sifter and sifted across the whole pan. Then placed the cinnamon sugar in the sifter and sifted it over the top of the bs/pd layer. Then melted another half stick of butter and poured across the top of the sugar mixes. Set it in my cold oven, over night & awoke to rolls oozing over the sides. I kind of tucked the ones that were really leaning, back into the dish and baked in pre-heated oven. I layed a sheet of foil over the top after 15 mins of baking. Then turned out immediately on a sheet of foil and let them set a few minutes to cool before flipping back over. DELISH!

I thought these rolls were dry, and the topping was very thick and sticky--it didn't soak into the bread at all--just kind of sat atop very dry rolls.

I probably should have taken various pieces of advice offered by other reviewers, but instead I prepared the recipe exactly as written.  No doubt the results would have been better if I had modified the recipe per others' suggestions.

You could very easily use 2 loaves of frozen bread dough cut into 32 pieces each.  I tossed pieces in melted butter then the bowl of cinn.,sugar, pudding topping.

Very good. I used frozen bread dough; 1 loaf. I also cut the ingredients in half. I like to be able to taste some of the fresh bread thru all the sweetness.

The layering process didn't work well for me, wish I had followed a different recipe that you butter & coat each piece of bread dough before putting in the pan.  It seemed like the butter just clumped the sugar and didnt really get on all the pieces.

Used 24 buns, cut in fourths.  Poured melted butter over all, mixed other ingredients and poured.  Rose a bit too much, so patted down before baking and used aluminum foil sheet under bundt pan to catch drips.  DELICIOUS!!

Not very impressed with this. I followed the directions exactly and they didn't turn out. Left out over night and a huge over flowing dough mess on my counter in the morning. Baked according to directions and the ones on the top burned, and the ones on the bottom were too doughy. the sugar stuff didn't coat very well and I had pockets of sugar stuff. Will not make this again. :(

So good that I've stopped looking for my "signature" coffeecake!  It doesn't get better or easier than this.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions to dip the half rolls in butter and then the sugar/pudding/cinnamon mix.  Try it with pecans instead of walnuts.  The first time I made this it was a flop because the mixture clumped and had lots of dry spots when I made it according to the original directions.  Also, another tip is to not overbake it and to remove it from pan after a few minutes as instructed otherwise the gooey topping crystallizes and gets too crunchy.  Lastly, I did not need grease/oil for the pan when I used a non-stick bundt pan...came right out.

This monkey bread is incredible.  People always rave about it.  I have been asked for the recipe by just about everyone who has tried it.  I made it for an Easter brunch and the entire thing was devoured in no time (and there was a lot of food from which to choose!).  The added bonus is that it is so easy to make!

I have tried this twice now because of the good reviews and still have not had success.  Because you let the mixture sit overnight, I end up with bread that has clumps of sugar/brownsugar/butter, rather than a nice even loaf.

Easy recipe!  Here's what I did:  Set out the frozen rolls for about 20 minutes so they thaw a bit.  Cut in half.  Roll in Brown Sugar mixture, then in pudding mixture.  Layer in 2 bundt pans still adding some of each mixture and butter between layer (and there were just two layers).  Popped them in the oven while we opened Santa's gifts.  They turned out awesome! My kids (13, 11, 5, 3) were all asking why I didn't make these more often!!!

Very yummy and easy.  Was also concerned about leaving it out all night, but I left it uncovered closed up in a cold oven (not gas)and it bubbled up great.  Not sure how it would do in cold weather, when my kitchen would be much colder. I agree with others that it's best to roll the balls in butter first, then all dry stuff mixed together, then drizzle/sprinkle on what's left.  Next time I will try it in a 13 x 9 pan.  Also, some said use biscuits, but if you like yeasty bread, this would be better.  Thanks, Holly.

An incredibly easy recipe. I followed ingredients to a "T". The only modification I made was cutting the cold (but not frozen) dough balls into halfs. I placed the flat side down on both layers. With smaller pieces it allowed all that good goo to run into all the cracks and crevices. Excelent and easy early morning coffee bread to assembly the night before and bake fresh in the morning.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm, great !

Something just isn't right here.   The flavors and ease of prep are terrific but what you end up with is an uneven distribution of a hard crumbly sugary topping among bread.   There has got to be a better way.

This was great.  I made the night before and baked the next morning.  My family went nuts over it.  If you follow the directions exactly, it should turn out fine.  I had no problem with the mixtures not being distributed evenly and it came right out of the pan with no sticking and easy clean up.  I would recommend using Baker's Joy because it is a non-stick spray with flour.  Works great every time.   Thanks Holly.  Will be making again very soon!

This turned out awesome. Made these last night and when we got up this morning it was quite a site. The grand kids got a a kick out of it. There was nothing left after breakfast. Very easy.

These turned out great.  The only thing I would change is to let the rolls thaw out some and then cut them in 1/2 or 1/3's.  Everyone loved these though.  Oh and I don't add the nuts because I don't care for them.

This recipe is awesome!!!  I make this all the time for my coworkers and they go crazy over it!  I usually do a double batch and I use one cook and serve butterscotch pudding and one instant butterscotch pudding mix.  The cook and serve gives it a gooeyer caramel like texture while you still have the smoother texture of the instant.  I also have made these in a mini bundt pan for individual serving sizes and they take half the time to bake and are perfect too!

This is always a big hit.  Just as recommended I dip the dough in the melted butter before I put each in the pan.  I use approx.  22 dough balls.  This recipe tastes the best if you use yeast rolls.  Also, I use a pound of butter and I put cream cheese frosting on top.  Yum!

it sounded good, and easy. but leaving uncooked food of any sort out all nite makes me wonder. i tried it any way, my dinner rolls doubled in size and where hanging over the pan, what a mess. had to work with it, but like someone else said they didn't like the hard chewwing parts. i'll go back to the by scratch recipe it may take time but i think its worth it cant say a whole lot about this recipe.

I did as many other reviewers and cut the rolls into 4 pieces, dipped in butter, and rolled in mixture of sugars and pudding.  I thought these rolls were very good, but next time I think I will use vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch.  I felt that the butterscotch flavor over powered that of the cinnamon and sugar.

I used the regular Rhodes dinner rolls and cut them into fourths.  instead of layering the different sugars I threw them all together and dipped the roll peices in butter.  all in all it came out well but did not hold together coming out of the pan.

These were just wonderful. What's better than having breakfast already in the morning and just having to pop it in the oven. I used an 9x13 backing dish for this and I had 4 rows and 7 bisquits in each row. It worked out perfect. I used frozen rolls for this and the rose to be about 3 times there original size. I cut back on the butterscotch pudding and brown suger mixture next time I will use the full amount as we like ours really really gooey. I will be making these many many more times. Thanks for sharing.

I've been using this recipe for years and it is the best!  The yeast rolls are SO much better than canned biscuits.  I cut mine into quarters so they can easily be popped in the mouth.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I think it calls for WAY too much sugar.  It was so much sugar that most of it didn't even carmelize and just stayed in chunks that hardened in the oven.  We scraped it off and ate the rolls.  My sister makes these by dipping the frozen rolls in butter, then rolling them in a cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I think that hers is better than this.

My dad makes monkey bread for every holiday- Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.  I decided to continue the tradition this year and make this for my husband and in-laws.  Delicious!  My dad uses biscuit dough, but yeast dough is so much tastier, and the carmel sauce on this one is a lot richer and gooey-er.  Everyone loved it!

This was AWESOME!! I made it for a San Diego Charger tailgate party and it was a HUGE hit!!The only thing I did different was to drizzle melted butter and brown sugar over the top, after I flipped the pan upside down. No burnt pans here:)

Yuck!  Way too much topping!  This really didn't work for me.  It tasted okay the first day but was really unappealing looking.  I threw it out after that.  Won't be using this one again.

This was SO good! Far better than any refrigerated cinnamon rolls, and almost as easy! I followed the advice of past reviews and dipped each dough piece in melted butter before rolling in sugar/pudding mixture, and it came out really gooey. Just remember to turn it out of the pan, or the caramelized sugar will harden it into place in minutes! Only one question-- where do I get frozen rolls that will rise? I used refrigerated rolls and they remained stubbornly small...

I promised my daughter Tyler months ago that I'd make her this bread. I kept forgetting about it and when she would remind me, there was always one ingredient I didn't have on hand. She had a school dance to go to Friday night and was having a friend sleep over afterward. I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to make this. It turned out that I didn't have an ounce of brown sugar in the house and didn't feel like running to the store, so I made my own. I just combined white sugar with some molasses and by golly it worked! Well Holly, everyone loved this gooey, warm and delicious morning treat. Thanks so much!

Excellent!  I 1/2ed the recipe because I would rather bake fresh than have leftovers.  I rolled each frozen roll in the butter before placing in tube pan.  Since there was only a single layer when the recipe is 1/2ed, you just put the buttered rolls in a layer and then put the pudding/brown sugar mixture on, next the cinnamon & sugar mixture, nuts if you are doing that, and then pour the melted butter over top.  After dipping each roll, I didn't have any leftover butter so I melted an additional Tbsp. and dotted the top with it.  1/2 recipe still bakes for the 30 minutes.  ENJOY!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I cut dough into quarters as suggested (can do this while frozen); then dropped in melted butter, then rolled in the cinnamon pudding mixture that was together in one bowl instead of two.  Was good and even.  Used bundt pan and no problems with raw dough.  +++++++ IMPORTANT to get correct size bag of dinner rolls!!!!!!!  The smaller bag does not seem like it would be enough but it was!!!!!!

This is great and easy.  Have made it several times, usually for a holiday breakfast, and everyone loves it.  Be sure to bake long enough, so the middle gets baked through.  Not so good if the center is doughy!

This was a wonderful and easy recipe to make! I made it by the recipe except I used 36 ounces of bread instead of 24 and it overflowed into my oven, so I will make it using only 24 next time! But it was still really yummy! I also drizzled it while it was warm with a tub of ready-made buttercream frosting that I warmed for a few seconds in the microwave! Yummy!

I think this recipe would be better if I followed the directions. I thought it would turn out better to dip the rolls into melted butter, then dip into the pudding/cinnamon/sugar mixture so that is what I did. I had some extra sugar mixture left over so I poured that on top of the rolls and then added more melted better to the top. When it came out of the oven some parts were hard/overcooked and some were nice and gooey. The syrup that formed between each piece was not too my liking- a bit gummy. Next time I will try this recipe using biscuit dough and scrap the pudding mix.

This is so easy and so delicious.  My family loved this bread.  Here's how I made mine.  I used pecans and vanilla instant pudding mix rolling each roll in butter, then the pudding/brown sugar followed by a roll in the cinnamon/sugar mix. I poured more of each mixture, butter, pecans on each of the two layers.  As for the butter, I used half a cup and only ended up using half of the pudding/sugar mix-it just look like too much of a good thing to me. I placed the bunt pan filled with the softend rolls and sugar/butter concoction into my oven over night setting the oven on bread proof.  I woke up six hours later to a mess since the rolls had risen so much that some of the sugar coated rolls fell out of the pan. After cleaning up the mess, I baked the bread and it was perfect for my family. I can't get enough of this bread.  It is soo good.  Enjoy!.

Nothing special about this recipe. It had good flavor, but maybe I didn't put enough butter into it? It was dry.

FUN and EASY!  My family loves monkey bread and this was a fantastic recipe!  I didn't have butterscotch pudding, so I used vanilla and it was still really great!  Thank you for a fun pull apart bread!!

When this turns out, it is wonderful!!  I've made it four or five times, but atleast twice it has not turned out right.  It probably was an error on my part but I'm not sure what I'm doing differently.  Anyway, when it's good, it's very good!

Don't worry if this recipe looks dry and unappealing right after it is assembled. After it bakes, it is beautiful. It looks like you spent hours making it and it tastes delicious. I served this at a large brunch and everyone loved it.

Awesome!  Incredibly addicting!  I,too, cut up the rolls and coated them in the melted butter.  Then I mixed all the other ingredients together and rolled them in the mixture.  I layered them in the bundt pan and drizzled remaining butter and sugar mixture over the top.  When you flip the pan it makes a wonderful drizzle effect.  I also increased the butter to 1 cup.  Definitely a keeper!

Nobody in my family cared for this.  I needed it fast so I just followed the original recipe.  There were a lot of dry clumps of the brown sugar and pudding.  If I make it again, I think I'll follow the review suggestions and cut up the rolls and dip each roll in butter.

What an easy, tasty recipe.  The four adults and four kids finished them quickly.  As a suggestion, place the nuts on one half of the pan for those who don't like them.  It would be worth baking these just for the aroma alone!

FABULOUS!! I made this for Christmas breakfast, and received RAVE reviews from everyone!  No one could resist the smell, and I have already been asked to make this on a regular basis.  What a delicious and easy recipe!  I omitted the nuts, and it was still great.  Don't even bother with the other recipes...this is the one to make!!

OMG this is soooo good!! I made sweet bread dough (the one for cinnamon buns) in my bread machine and used that instead of the Frozen dough. I mixed all the rest of the ingredients together (skipped the white sugar... seemed like overkill!) and put half in the middle and half on top. I preheated the oven to 200 degrees Celsius, turned it off, and let the dough rise for 30mins. Then cooked for 30mins at 350 (used a bundt pan).  I inverted the whole thing onto a plate... the sugary topping seeped down while baking to create a perfect golden coating over the whole thing. Whoah mamma it's delicious and looks so beautiful! Might even throw in some raisins next time.

My dinner rolls rose out of the pan. I think next time I will divide them into 2 separate tube pans and give one away.  Also I think  I will add more walnuts.  They were delicious mixed with the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.

So I had a very similar recipe that I always used for my monkey bread then I lost it. I made this today with a few changes that were from my previous recipe. First, I used store brand biscuits that come in a 4 pack. I cut each biscuit into fourths. I melt 2 sticks of butter and whisk all the dry ingredients together. I definitely do not use instant pudding only the cook and serve. I also double all dry ingredients. I spray my pan with Pam. Once the biscuits are cut, I dip them in melted butter then drop them in my bowl of sugar/pudding and cover them completely, a few at a time then put them in my bundt pan. Once done, any leftover butter and sugar mix I pour/sprinkle on top of the biscuits. Put in the oven at 350° for the time stated. It comes out perfect every time and looks gorgeous! Totally gooey, no lumps or dry spots and every biscuit is covered in the sugar/ butter mixture.

Ugh - I was so excited to try a new recipe but it was a total fail!  I expected the brown sugar mixture to get melty and gooey but it stayed in clumps throughout the bread.  I'll go back to my tried and true recipe next time!

This was delish!  I used the cook and serve butterscotch pudding instead of instant. Only use the amount of bread dough in recipe otherwise if will rise too much.i covered with aluminum foil for last 10 mins. Came out of pan great this recipe is a keeper!

Oh my goodness! I needed to bring something for a breakfast at work and didn't want to stay up late the night before waiting for it to bake and had too much to do that morning to be able to spend time baking. I found this recipe and put it together to rise overnight. I used vanilla pudding mix since I didn't have butterscotch and didn't have any walnuts. Still, it was wonderful and everyone raved! I almost couldn't bear the drive to work, it smelled so good, and it baked while I was getting ready for work. Definitely a keeper!

My family didn't like the butterscotch pudding taste.  Only one of 4 of us liked it and he even said don't make it again.  We love butterscotch pudding so we thought it would be great but wasn't good.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Not a good taste for us.

I didn't follow another's advice and use the 13x9 and used a tube pan instead...what a mess - liquid dripped out of the bottom on to oven floor - smoke everywhere - smoke detector went off - dog went running to hide - had to take it out, let oven cool, clean it up and start over...ANYWAY, the end result after I put it back in the oven for 20 minutes was delicious - I will definitely be making this again but will use a bigger pan!

I fixed this this morning for Christmas Breakfast and it was great. I did make a couple of unintentional changes.  I was so tierd last night I didn't pay attention to the ammount of rolls called for and I used a 3lb bag.  Because of this it wasn't done when I removed it from the oven and it went everywhere when I turned it onto the platter... so I dumped it in a 9x13 dish and popped it back in the oven.  We loved it!

YUMMY!! My family and I couldn't get enough of these!  I cut up the frozen biscuits into forths and let them sit over night like suggested by a previous reviewer.  I will definitely make these again, but only for Christmas morning as they are a nutritional disaster.

So easy and delicious! I made it for my roommates and all of it was gone within 15 minutes.
I cut each biscuit into 4 little triangles and dipped each in the butter, then the sugar before placing it in the pan.

I don't care for the instant pudding mix and usually use the cook and serve.  From my experience, the instant makes the rolls a bit gummy.  But other than that, this is such an easy recipe and never disappoints with warm delicious rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful- however I had a hard time getting it done and the edges got way too brown.  Next time I will try less dough and maybe use a 9X13 pan.  With a few minor changes this will be a keeper.

Very tasty and easy, too!  I used sugar free pudding and Splenda and it turned out great!  I also tried substituting the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar and it was ok, but it more gooey with the regular brown sugar.

I tried this last weekend and was a great hit.  I used 18 rolls cut in quarters, dipped in them in butter before I put them in the pan as a previous reviewer suggested (by cutting them in quarters you also get smaller pieces to tear off)otherwise I followed the recipe.  WOW, this is excellent!

My family LOVES this.  I make for breakfast almost every other week!  I use 18 frozen dinner rolls cut in quarters.  I also use the NON-instant butterscotch pudding and dip the rolls in the butter before putting in the pan.  The only thing I wish I could get around is that the top is kind of crusty.  This is so easy!  I make the night before and put in the oven and set the oven timer to cook it in the morning.  I get to sleep in and my husband gets it out of the oven!

This was okay; the topping was really good, but I think I'll cut up the dough as suggested next time.  The cinnamon and butterscotch weren't very evenly distributed so you get a lot of it in one place and can hardly taste it in another.  If every bit was flavorful, I'm sure this would be great!

Very delicious crumb topping.  My problem was 24 rolls were too much for the pan.  Also, the butter and sugar mixture kind of settle at the bottom of the pan, so the top layer of rolls aren't as tasty as the bottom.  However, that bottom layer was delicious!  Maybe drizzle cream cheese frosting on the top to keep it interesting after cooking?  Could work next time!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly & had no problems whatsoever. I made mine in an angel food cake pan. It is more of a sweet roll than a true "monkey bread", which isn't gooy. Will be making this again.

This was great! I used canned bisquits instead. I put some of the cinnamon sugar mixture in the center of each bisquit and folded them over and pinched the edges together.  I didn't use all the pudding mixture and added a little more sugar and cinnamon to the melted butter before I poured over each of the layers.  I used 4- 7oz. cans of bisquits

This was very easy and delicious.  It rises to be about triple in size so make sure you put in a big enough dish.  I also dipped the rolls into butter first.  Everyone raved about how goey they were.

My family loved this...a bit sweet for my liking! I used a batch of homemade bread dough (bread machine) and it was excellent. My youngest was not so thrilled because it's very "goopy" but he happily ate it with a fork. I think this will become my traditional Christmas morning breakfast!

Wow, what a treat this recipe is.  It is easy to make the night before, bake in the morning to go with your favorite egg recipe and people think you are a gourmet.  We LOVED it and will make it again and again.  Thanks Holly.

Made no changes, but I will in the future. I left the made up recipe sitting out overnight on the counter with a cookie sheet under the Bundt pan it was to be baked in the morning, as directed. Perhaps my pan was not deep enough, but all night I kept hearing the nuts pinging onto the cookie sheet as the dough rose.  In the morning, dough was well outside the pan as well as in the pan, the ways that it rose. I pulled the pieces from outside the  pan and placed them on top for baking. The finished product was delicious, but  instead of being a nice circular ring  when I turned it out, it covered the greater part of a cookie sheet, and I served it on a turkey platter! Maybe next time I will cut the biscuits in smaller pieces as some other recipes call for , and invest in another taller tube pan, such as for angel food cake.

I followed some of the recommendations and cut the rolls into quarters, used 2tbs cinnamon, cooking pudding and pecans. Also foiled the Bundt pan after 15min and baked another 25min just to make sure the center got done. I made this for a late Christmas family dinner this past weekend and it got DEMOLISHED. Next time I’ll make 2 to make sure I have some left over to have with coffee the next morning. It was perfect. If I had put a sugar glaze on this, I’m convinced it would surpass a Cinna-Bon.

I made some changes. I used a cake pan with only half the rolls and without the instant butterscotch pudding. Instead of leaving out all night I I placed the rolls in the refrigerator overnight. The next morning  my granddaughter, an early riser sat them out , after about an hour they still had not risen enough so I placed them in the oven at 170 degrees for about five minutes. (The oven was preheated and turned off for the five minute rising) By then they were ready to bake. The monkey bread was so delicious we are making it a  family tradition!

I paid attention to all of the other hints and followed them. My suggestions: do not leave the bread out on the counter  to rise overnight. I put mine in the garage (we live in the north) covered with sprayed plastic wrap. In the morning I brought it in and within about 15 minutes it had risen even more.
   My biggest problem was knowing if the bread was done. I have a convection oven so I covered it with foil after 15 minutes. It still got a little hard on the tops so I melted some butter and brushed it on them. I would say, just follow the time  as written and leave the bread gooey. You will be ok. P.S. My husband LOVED it!!! Good luck!

I used two cans of Pillsbury frozen biscuits and followed the recipe.  I had a lot of leftover brown sugar and pudding mix.  But, the bread turned out great.  Yummy, beautiful looking, and so easy to make.  There were only four of us and we ate the whole thing!

Tasted great. Followed directions making 2 layers of rolls; however 3 rolls jumped ship out of the pan and on to the oven rack. Removed from oven about 4 minutes early because of this and other rolls were a perfect brown color. All rolls were done perfectly.

The flavor was excellent, and it literally disappeared! 

I followed the tips shared in other reviews to used regular (not instant) pudding, and mix all the toppings together, gently warming them in a saucepan.

The only challenge was that it overflowed my bundt pan. In the future i won’t use the full pack of frozen dinner rolls, but i will definitely be making this again!

Read the reviews 1st
I have made this recipe twice.
 The first time I made the recipe I followed it exactly and I mostly had clumps of sugar and pudding and very dry rolls.
2nd time: after reading the reviews I made some aptations to the recipe, by cutting the dough into fourths dipping them into the butter, then rolling them in the cinnamon and sugar. I then melted the butter adding the cook and serve butterscotch pudding and brown sugar and then layering everything. I cooked it in a bundt pan. My family devoured it the second time
Great recipe with the adaptations the second time around will definitely make it again.

i do it a bit differently---i use the canned cinnamon roll dough in the refrigerator section of grocery store.   I divide it in to small balls that I coat with a cinnamon sugar mixture and place in bunt pan.    Then I melt 1/4# butter and add more cinnamon, brown sugar and vanilla----once it is melted and blended---then pour over the dough and bake!    by using the cinnamon dough (instead of bread dough---one gets even more cinnamon and sugar flavor!

Will definitely try this, but was wondering if anyone had tried mixing the dry ingredients all together and then using a pastry cutter to cut the cold butter into it?  Seems like it would make it a more crumbly mixture and would distribute the butter more evenly.  I cut the butter into the cake mix when I make the dump cobblers with peaches and/or cherries and it comes out much better.

recipe mentions melted butter in the list of ingredients but not in the instructions.   ive made these but you cut the slightly frozen log of bread dough into 32 pieces.   Roll over finger pinching into a ball.  Dip into melted butter, roll into a mixture of all dry ingredients and layer into bundt pan.   sprinkle layer with a bit of dry mix.  Repeat layers.

Two stars as written. It has a lot of dry ingredients for only 1/2 cup of butter,  and there was insufficient moisture to coat the rolls.  The result was a hard bottom of brown sugar and dry rolls.   I recommend following the comments of others in thawing the rolls, mixing the ingredients and using cook-and-serve pudding.    However, I used this recipe because of its simplicity (making at 1:00 a.m. on Christmas Eve for the next morning!), I will likely look for a different recipe.

If you like gooey and sweet this is your bliss.  This was my first Monkey Bread.  I used frozen yeast rolls cut into 1/4ths and added raisins and walnuts.  I ended up rolling the dough balls in the butter- sugar in order to spread the mixture more evenly.  Turned out great.

Will cut the balls in half next time.  Might also try rolling the balls in melted butter then roll in sugar/cinnamon mix.  Wrapped the outside edge of pan with foil to prevent burning.  Delicious!

Way too much brown sugar .  Need to be more specific about what  kind of frozen bread to use. I used 24 ounces of  already   formed frozen dinner  rolls and it  didn't seem nearly enough.  Not enough butter either.  I used  3/4 of a cup.  There must have been about a half of cup of the brown sugar/pudding mix in bottom of the Bundt pan after I baked and removed the bread.

This makes the best monkey bread! I've tried so many different recipes and have found that this method is the best. The only change I would recommend is to use the cook-and-serve butterscotch pudding instead of instant. I tried the instant and flavor was not as good. Making this ahead of time frees up your morning to enjoy family, or watch your kids open their gifts. Every house is different so I can say that the time needed for the dough to rise can vary. If your house is warmer it won't need as much time, as if your house is on the cooler side overnight. This can make a difference in how dry or moist your monkey bread could turn out.

I made this and it turned out great, the only alteration I made was that I added the butterscotch pudding, white sugar, and cinnamon in a quart/gallon Baggie, shook it together and added the dough to the mixture after I cut it into 4's, shaking the mixture as I cut and add.  I like to have the dough surrounded by the cinnamon goodness. I also heated the butter and stirred in brown sugar allowing it to melt together, after all my pieces were covered and shook well in the Baggie I poured them evenly from the Baggie into my silicone bunt pan. Then I took the brown sugar/butter mix and poured over top and placed in my fridge overnight.

The BEST monkey bread I've ever made. It's nice that it is assembled the night before. Takes less time in the morning. It stays fresh MUCH longer than the kind with regular biscuits.

I personally opted to leave out the nuts and it turned out great. One tip: be sure to place it in the oven immediately after pouring the glaze to prevent it from settling at the bottom.

The next morning, I heard my husband laughing..."go check out the monkey bread..."  It had overflowed and looked like a huge mushroom.  I had a huge laugh too...  After cutting up the buns into quarters it fit in my bunt pan.  It turned out great after that ordeal.  Everyone really enjoyed it at brunch.

This is really delicious.  The couple of things I would do different next time is put it in the refrig to rise and  maybe add some heavy cream next time to make it more gooey.

This recipe is sooooo much better than those that use biscuits.  This recipe tastes like little cinnamon rolls.  Yum! I forgot to take the rolls out in time so I thawed them quickly in a heated oven, cut them into 4 pcs and then followed the recipe.  I did let them raise again before baking & it turned out perfect!  Will definitely make this again!!

My 8+ year old son made this recipe for a friends waffle party.  He said it was easy to make and better to eat.  We have made it several time since and have had raves on this dish. Thanks for the recipe.  It reminds me of what my Mother would make for special occasions.

This is wonderful!  Its now our Christmas morning tradition.  I put everything together the evening before and stuck the whole pan in the refrigerator while we were out for Christmas Eve.  When we got home, I set it out on the counter and by morning, it has risen perfectly and was ready to bake.  Everyone loved it!!   I have 4, very picky kids, and they all ate it and requested it for every holiday.  Can't wait to make it again!

This is a Christmas tradition at our house! It's so easy to make too. I change some things around for my personal tastes. I use cook and serve vanilla pudding rather than butterscotch, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon. I always add pecans too. I don't add the white sugar at all. When you put this on a plate Christmas morning, the sauce is so wonderful and it looks pretty too.

Our favorite. It does take some time to prepare, but the end result is worth it. I also took the advice of other reviewers and dip the dough balls in the butter then the spices.

Very good. I made these for Christmas morning. I used vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch and omitted the walnuts. This was very, very good but my gang wanted real cinnamon rolls instead. With the use of the Rhodes rolls this could not have been easier! Thanks for the post.

I had a different recipe I've always used and decided to try this one. I had a burnt mess. I had to throw my pan away because all of the toppings crystalized and stuck at the bottom. I don't know where it went so wrong, but I had a burnt, dry mess to serve my guests.

This was soooo good! I divided each frozen roll into four smaller pieces, and then I rolled each piece in melted butter and dipped it into each of the dry mixtures. It ended up being very gooey and very tasty!!!

My grandchildren assembled this recipe and loved it! Now they call me and ask me to "sleep over" so we can make monkey bread toghether. I thought it as good as any other monkey bread I have had in the past---a little sweet for my taste.

This is the best monkey bread recipe!  (Although it's not the one in the Allrecipes Cookbook - my friend has the cookbook and said her monkeybread "wasn't as good as yours" - when I checked her recipe it was different - this is definitely better!  The raised dough makes all the difference, and so easy to assemble the night before and have it ready and baked in 1/2 hour!  I just gave someone this recipe today after sharing some - she said she "had to have it!"

Although this is a fun dish to make for kids or an informal brunch, this particular recipe needs some variations which I have listed.  I used 4 cartons (10 each) of refrigerated canned biscuits instead of the dinner rolls, omitted the brown sugar, increased white sugar to 3/4 cup, decreased cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, increase melted butter to 3/4 cup.  Grease a 10 inch tube pan, remove the biscuits from the pan and cut them in quarters, brush them well with the butter then roll them in the sugar/pudding/cinnamon/nut mixture.  Stack them in the pan, then add leftover sugar mixture over the biscuits and butter too.  Bake for approximately 25 minutes at 350 - 375.  Cool on rack for 10 minutes, then remove from pan

This was so good. I used a frozen loaf instead of rolls and it turned out great. I also used almonds instead of the walnuts. This was a delicious treat.

VERY good, but next time I'm going to try to do a better job getting the sugar mixture all around the bread so it's more evenly gooey - maybe it needs more butter.
