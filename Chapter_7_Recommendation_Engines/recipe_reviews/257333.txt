This was great right next to a cup of coffee!  as is, is awesome I am sure, the only changes I made was based on what i had in my pantry. 
I did have to grind my own almonds into butter bc I was out. Just put almonds into a food processor until fine powder (works best with blanched almonds, but I used regular.) then add a bit of oil (i added MCT oil) a little at a time. 
I was also out of bananas,  just subbed a ripe avocado. we loved this switch, it added more healthy fat and less natural sugar. my husband keeps asking me to make these again. The children also liked these. sometimes (when I have bananas on hand) i throw those into a food processor and use the pureed banana as an 'icing' for the children. they get a kick out of frosting their muffins.  
thanks for posting such a great healthy muffin!

I have made these every week for about a year now. They’re great! Shredded carrots work if you’re short on zucchini.

I'm glad I decided to try this recipe! I would of never thought of this combination, but it worked out great! I love the taste, but I cut out 1/4 c. of the chocolate morsels. I also added 1/4 cup cooked quinoa. Thanks for this creative recipe!
 UPDATE; I use an electric mixer to beat the ingredients(prior to zucchini and morsels) together . I made another batch without quinoa and instead used 1/4 c. cooked teff. These came out moist and kids loved them!

Delicious, Moist and Yummy!  Not a typical "healthy and wheat free" taste and texture. I substituted coconut flour for the ground flax meal (2 tablespoons) to make them grain free and close to SCD.

these are absolutely horrid. I didn't expect them to be exactly like a regular muffin, but I did expect them to at least be edible. one of the worst things I've ever made or eaten and I followed the recipe to a T.

So glad I found this recipe! I quadrupled the recipe and did half protein powder and half cocoa powder.  It made 24 regular size muffins and 24 mini muffins. They are an amazing snack that is healthy and delicious!

I had most of the ingredients.  I substituted hemp seeds for the ground flax seed; and since I didn't have ANY chocolate chips :), I substituted ea for a 1/4 cup oatmeal, and 1/4 cup slivered almonds.  Hence it was a tad dry & a smidge crumbly in my opinion.  My roommate loved it though, said it would be great with a cup a coffee! :D

These are so good! Very light and not too sweet. I mixed everything but the chocolate chips in the food processor. Added them at the end. Didn’t have bittersweet chocolate, so left the tops plain. Will definitely make again!

I was skeptical at first, but these are delicious and surprisingly good! It tastes like a guilt free brownie. Great vegan and gluten free recipe! Thank you for posting!

A moist recipe. I had to substitute the honey for maple syrup since I’m not allowed honey on the FODMAP diet. I would double the recipe next time because the muffins hardly rose. It made a dozen muffins.
