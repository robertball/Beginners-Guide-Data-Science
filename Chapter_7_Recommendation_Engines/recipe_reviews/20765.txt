One of my favorites! Very good on the rocks too- I let the lemonade and mint mingle all day and then add vodka and pour over ice - either way it says SUMMER!

This was good though the mint flavor didn't shine through for me. I scaled it back to a single drink (and reduced the vodka to one shot as 1/4C seemed a bit excessive for one drink). I sugared the rim of my glass for an added touch. CHEERS!
