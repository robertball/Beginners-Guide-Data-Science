My family liked this.  It was quick and easy.  I had never used stir-fry sauce before, but thought I would give it a try.  I found that the one I chose was a little strong (salty)...and was very glad I had made jasmine rice as a side.  I will probably make again with a different brand of sauce.  Thanks!

This was great.  I marinated the chicken in the stir-fry sauce overnight.  I will make this over and over again.

I was a little worried about making this recipe but my boyfriend thought it sounded really good. He was right the chicken was so yummy and it was pretty simple to make. Will make again soon. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was perfect!  I used 1 bottle of sauce to 3lbs of chicken since that is what I had and doubled the garlic.  I did my chicken on low broil for 10 minutes, tossed, and did another 10.  No complaints, only asking for seconds.

Thanks!
