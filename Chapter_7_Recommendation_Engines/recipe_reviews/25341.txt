I only gave the recipe four stars because instead of the cottage cheese, you need to use farmers cheese.  Most markets have this.  I also added sauteed onions to my mashed potatoe mixture.  Other than that, this was just like my grandmother used to make.  It wasn't as hard as I expected.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  Next time I will add some sauerkraut to the mixture.  My grandmother also did these with plums and just boiled them.  When they were done she would top them with sour cream and sugar.  I know it sounds weird but they were wonderful!  Now I have the dough recipe and can make many variations.  Thank you!

These are worth all the hard work and effort.  Be sure to roll the dough very thin.  The more delicate they are, the more delicious they are.  I also filled mine with potato & sharp cheddar and sour kraut & onion.  Remember, it goes alot quicker if you have a helper.  One person to roll and cut dough and one person to stuff and pinch.

The dough is very easy to prepare and prepares enough for 24 Pierogi.

The recipe for the filling, if followed completely, would make enough filling for 9 zillion Pierogi.

I followed the directions, and adding only ONE container of cottage cheese, had enough filling for the 24 and enough thrown out which could have made 5000.

Has the recipe been wrongly written?? I think so.

In Poland, white cheese used in this recipe only tastes like cottage cheese, but looks like feta cheese (dry). This is the reason why some of you did not like the cottage cheese in this recipe. And to the filling, we also adding extra chopped and fried on a skillet onion. It tastes much better that way.

I think I finally have figured out the mystery of the filling.  It all comes down to bad instructions.  The first 10 I followed the instructions, and well..they weren't good.
When rolling the dough, roll it to a 1/4 inch.  The cut out with the smallest cutter you have, I used the smallest biscuit cutter, about an inch. Most people wouldn't have a glass small enough.  A childs juice glass might work. When you have all those cut out, there's about 70.  THEN, roll them again to almost a paper width.  I used almost all the filling, and they didn't taste like breading.

That being said..and being Polish...they did NOT taste like my grandpas...

I don't think they're worth the work.

This definately makes WAY too much filling, so keep the amount of dough the same, but reduce the filing by half.  Also, make sure you roll out the dough very thin - this way, you can stuff more into each one and they taste much better with thin dough.  You should make these with a helper, as they take a while to make, but they are worth it.  We added cheddar cheese and just a touch of minced onion, and used an electric mixer to mash the potatoes rather than using a potato masher.  Overall quite good.

I agree with MDASIL.  I am thired generation urkanian, this recipe needs the farmers cheese, if you are unwilling to spend the money, lowfat ricotta cheese.  Also yukon potatoes hold too much water you need a starch white potatoe the recipe then will not make a massive amount of filling to your dough portion.  Cream cheese is not necessary.  Sour cream; Daisy's is preferred.  White or yellow cooking onions carmelized make the difference.  To taste their is no specific.  Refrain from pan frying with oil a small amount of margain with simply infuse all flavors.  For sealing use a small dap of water on your finger.  Rim it and pinch accordingly.  The prep time is absolutely unreal, you must not to a beginner to recieve such a time.  I have 500 done in a days time.  Half are in prep for the holiday season, half are prepped for storing.  If storing do not cook.

Fan Spanking Tastic! I'll never buy pierogis again. I cut the recipie down by two thirds and it made enough pierogis for 3 people (about 12). I had a whole bunch of filling left over. Since it does take a bit of time to pull them together, I think the next time I make them, I'll cut the filling recipe by two thirds, but use the full dough recipe. Then I'll boil all the pierogis and freeze what ever I don't plan to use for dinner that night. That will consolidate the work time and provide me with a quick dinner in the future. I think I'll also try adding some shredded cheese to the filling.

Loved these.  I never thought I could make these taste like the pierogies that I used to eat in Pennsylvania, but they were great!  There is too much filling, so cut that amount to 25%.  Also, I diced two onions, some butter and added them to the oil for frying.  The end result was buttery, oniony goodness, just like what I remembered.

I made this except I made a lot LESS filling. Once boiled, I fried these in oil until golden brown then sprinkled with a bit of salt. They were great as appetizers!!!

Was in the Navy for 20+ years, stationed from one end of this nation to the other and sampled foods from all over the world, but this is the first time I've every tried Pierogis.  They are awesome, the work to make them is well worth it and it is more fun if you have help.  Well worth the work!

I am slovak, and we use this filling: Mashed potatoes mixed with (bryndza cheese) which is similar to Goat cheese and also we add fresh small cut dill herb into it. It is great filling and smells great too. Try it. I will post my recipe later.

Filling is really enough for several batches of the dough- but that is the only downside to this recipe. This was the first time I made homemade Pierogi & with this recipe is was completely fool-proof.

I gave it 4 stars bc if the dough would have been left at 1/4" thickness they probably would have been really tough.  I rolled the dough almost paper-thin and carefully stuffed with left over mashed potatoes and shredded cheese.  Served with turkey smoked sausage, peppers and onions.  It was SOOO awesome.  The pierogi was so tender and delicious.  Very nice dough recipe, but I STRONGLY suggest rolling the dough out much thinner.

My parents are Polish and when my mom made these, the filling was made with cream cheese, mashed potatoes and grilled onions. And topped with bacon of course :) Sooo good! If farmers cheese was available we used that, but I loved the cream cheese more.

The proportions are way off on this recipe.  I ended up with a bowl full of filling, even after I cut the ingredients in half.  My polish husband did not like the cottage cheese in the filling.

i grew up on Pierogies.  I love them.  I wanted to add that we make a sauce to use.
  Saute chopped onion in butter untill clear, but NOT browned.  Add, Heavy cream, 1/2 & 1/2 or light cream(what ever you like, we use FF to save on the fat).  When warm, add sour cream to the sauce.  Don't boil, just heat throughly.   Measurements, Hmmm  2 pints of cream, 16 oz of sour cream, 2 sticks of butter/margarine and 4 onions(lots).  Just add to make it the consistancy you want.  ENJOY!

We (meaning myself and the two fellas that helped me eat them) have never made or ate anything like these before.  I was just skiming through the recipes, thought these sounded good, read the reviews, and decided to make them.  I used 6 or 7 russet potatoes and still have plents of filling left.  I ended up with 29 of these.  After reading a review I decided to add some crumbled bacon and shredded cheddar cheese to the filling.  I am SO glad I did becuase the only thing about them that had any flavor was the bacon.  They need to be dipped in something (sweet & sour sauce or honey mustard maybe).  Perhaps mixing some herbs into the crust would make them better.  Just some things to experiment with.  We figured the time spent making thise would have been worth it if they would have had more flavor and not been so bland.  I wound up dipping mine in ketchup for a little flavor; ketchup is not advised.  :)  I started around 6 pm, and we didn't eat until 8:30 pm or so.

I thought the dough was good, but the amounts required for the filling was far too much!  I made only 12 servings and made 2 batches of dough, but it still wasn't enough.  The filling was rather plain, so I added, fontina cheese, ham, and some more butter, and it tasted really good alone.  Then sauteed it in onions and garlic. After that it tasted quite good!
