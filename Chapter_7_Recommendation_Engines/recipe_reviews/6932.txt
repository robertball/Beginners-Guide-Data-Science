I just bought a Kitchen Aid blender that made quick work of that orange, the bread is the best one I have in my collection of recipes.  I took it to work, emailed it to friends, during the holidays it made the rounds of all my family and friends, I got nothing but rave reviews!! Will make again and again.

I made two loaves last night (using dates instead of raisins, since that's my preference)and brought a few slices to work. The bread got rave reviews. It bursts with flavor and has a nice texture. This is a keeper. I will make 4 loaves tonight - one to freeze, the rest to give to friends. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

I used a large Clementine in this recipe. I made muffins out of this recipe as well. I only made two small changes in this recipe and that was using 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and I used pecans instead of walnuts, as we do not like walnuts. I got 18 medium sized muffins out of one recipe. I baked them at 350* for exactly 20 minutes. I have to say that the orange and pumpkin combined is just amazing. I love it. I think using the whole clementine is absolutely genius. I would have never thought of it. It's one of the moistest muffins I've ever had and the sweetness is just where it should be. My one issue is that it dosen't have enough "stuff". For me, this needs more raisins. Next time, I'll double the amount of raisins. I think this would be EXCELLENT with chopped fresh cranberries, too. I'm quite impressed with the use of the whole orange. Very smart. It's great now, I can only imagine how good it will be tomorrow after it sits overnight.

I tried this recipe as written and it was delicious!!  I also tried it using Sucanet instead of sugar and Spelt flour instead of white flour and it was just as delicious!!

WOW!!  The flavors of this bread are just to die for!!  I had a hard time telling when this bread was done though - toothpick came out dry, but the bread wasn't done.  I didn't realize this until it had cooled, so I put it back in at 350 for 20 minutes.  Did the trick!  So there's some advice if you think you underbaked the bread. I made this bread a second time, and baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Perfect! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a treat to make.  With the aroma and the texture you can't miss.  Eaten plain without any other condiments it takes care of it's self. Yum.

Great quick bread!!!  Wonderful new addition to our Thanksgiving meal.  Everyone was fasinated that a whole orange (peel and all) was an ingredient in this recipe.  Christine

I made this recipe as written, but as I prefer to bake using at least some whole grains, I used a 50/50 blend of whole wheat and all purpose flours and subbed canola oil for the butter, as I find it produces better results with whole wheat. I also subbed dried cranberries for the raisins, and made it into muffins rather than a loaf. My yield was 22 muffins, baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. I was a bit skeptical of the entire orange going into this, but turns out there was no need to worry. The flavor is outstanding, and my muffins were tender and light, with perfect moisture. I'm happy to have another great recipe to file away in my favorites file. Thank you, Carol.

I would give this a five- but the whole orange thing made me drop it to a 4.  I'm a pastry cook and let me tell you...there is no benefit to putting the whole orange in...it will just add bitterness.  Peel the zest and segment the orange.  Then blend it.  
I made it this way and it was delicious.  It is a very moist and heavy bread.  I used dried cranberries and it all went well together.  Will become a regular for me.

This was absolutely FABULOUS! I oiled a bunt pan then dusted it with granulated sugar before pouring the batter in, it made a nice sweet crust-yummy! This recipe is a keeper!

The first time I made this I followed it to the letter.  The 2nd time I used an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin and only 1/4 of an orange.  I mixed them together in the blender before adding them to the rest of the ingredients.  Much better!  The whole orange overpowers the pumpkin, so less gives you a hint of orange and plenty of pumpkin flavor.  Yummy!

Delish!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 can pumpkin (not quite 2 cups) and used 2 large cans mandarin organges (drained) in place of the whole oranges.  Also cut down on the sugar and water (since the mandarin oranges have extra liquid).  I've already made this 4 times in 2 weeks and given out the recipe twice!

This bread was too sweet, too much cloves, slightly bitter from all the orange peel. I certainly won't make it again.

Great flavor!  I substituted cranberries for the raisins and they worked wonderfully.  My only complaint is that the outside and the top becomes sticky and a little mushy, but that's nothing new with dense breads and the flavor more than makes up for it.  I will make it again and again!

I saw Sarah Jo's review and decided to use fresh cranberries (I bought several bags on clearance after Thanksgiving). I love the combo of orange/cranberry. I pulsed it in my food processor after doing the orange. My orange was probably only medium sized, but very juicy and delish. I subbed 1 cup of Whole Wheat Pastry flour for 1 cup of All Purpose. I used my homemade pumpkin pie spice (it has a touch of cardamom in it, makes it so good!). Less walnuts, only because I didn't have many, and left out the raisins. I baked it in my pampered chef mini loaf stone. Delish, moist and bursting with flavor! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is the ultimate pumpkin bread!  Everyone who sampled it was won over on first taste!  The combination of flavors is genius - don't change a thing the first time you make it.  The spices are perfectly balanced - I'm not crazy about cloves, but follow the recipe and you will see what I mean... And always bake an item until it is done - ovens can vary so much that it is usually not possible to say exactly how many minutes to bake something.  Learn how to test by touch and using a cake tester, as well as by how the sides shrink from the pan, and you will find the perfect time for your oven.  You MUST try the loaf!

This is an extraordinary bread.  The first time I made it I grated the outer orange peel and then put in the orange sections thinking if I used the whole orange it would be too bitter.  The next time I followed the directions using the whole orange and the difference was remarkable.  So follow the directions!  I did try different nuts as I had hazelnuts on hand and I prefer them to the walnuts.  I also used craisins because I had them and thought they would go well with the orange. 
I used fresh cooked squash instead of canned and I had to eliminate the water because my squash was a bit watery- so beware if you go that route.
This is a wonderful recipe- my husband and I eat it for breakfast, afternoon  and late evening snack.  Can't get enough.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made this for the first time this weekend for a fall brunch. It was wonderful! I substituted sweetened dried cranberries instead of raisins for more of a holiday look and flavor. The orange is a wonderful addition to the pumpkin - gives it a brighter and fresher taste. I'm making another loaf to take to work tomorrow, if it makes it out of the house...

This was absolutely delicious just as sumbmitted, but since I know I will be making it SO many more times in the future, I'm looking forward to varying the nuts and fruit. Mmmm! But again, 5* as is, no need for improvement if you ask me! Thank you so much for posting this!

Excellent!  One thing I did different was l peeled the zest off the oranges with a potato peeler and used it plus the inside.  I threw away the white foamy part of the skin.  A recipe for marmalade recomended this so I tried it here.  Don't know how it would have been otherwise but I rate this 5 stars.

A wonderful orange flavor with the dense texture of a pumkin bread. My family loved it! In fact, I am already being requested to make more (and I doubled it the first time).  It is in my recipe box permanently!  As for advice, I found doubling the recipe yielded three 7 x 3 loaves.

I love how the orange and the spices compliment the pumpkin flavour.  The only modification I made was that I grated an orange and then squeezed all the juice and pulp, rather than putting the whole thing in a food processor.

This was excellent. It makes a lot and is very heavy, like a cake, so make sure you have lots of people to feed! I made it for a ladies' brunch and everyone enjoyed it. You'll want to cook this longer than the specified time, like some others suggested; probably 15 to 20 minutes longer. It looked like it was done on top for me, but it wasn't. I didn't realize it was still uncooked a bit in the center of the loaf until I started slicing. Fortunately, I still had enough done pieces to serve.

I made this exactly to the recipe (except doubled for 2 loaves).  I was nervous about the whole orange (peel and everything) and I was right.  My husband and I had such a strong taste of the bitter part of the peel that it overshadowed the rest of the taste, which was good. I might try this again, but instead of using the peel I would zest the orange and then use the peeled orange in the recipe.

This is just fantastic! It has a very unique flavour for sure! Definitely be careful not to over mix. I discovered the hard way that you will get an edible but flat and ugly loaf if you do. I did however find I needed to add about 2-3 tblsp more flour, and the loaf was perfectly done after about 1 hour and 15 minutes rather than just an hour. Also, I tried sub-ing brown sugar for white and wound up with a dark and bitter carmelized crust. I wouldn't suggest it, but maybe I screwed up somewhere.
This really is a gem! Thanks Carol!

Is is definitely an amazing bread! Five stars for taste definitely. It's true the pumpkin isn't very strong, but this bread is amazing and worth tweaking if you want more pumpkin. The only things is that it is SO moist that it tends to fall apart. The tast is phenominal, but I'll just warn you a slice won't hold its form very well.

Had a very spicy kick to it. I didn't add the raisins or nuts. Instead, I used a simple icing on top (about 1/2 a cup of pwdrd sugar with about a tsp. of oj). Nobody in my house liked it except my husband, which is really weird because he is NOT a bread eater! I liked it with my coffee this morning and the taste grew on me so I will bump up to 4 stars (: Made a very beautiful loaf that held up well when sliced and was very moist, I really did like the texture. Thanks for the post!

AMAZING!  Giving it 5 stars because it was so tasty, I used fresh pumpkin puree that I had on hand in the freezer for this, delicious!  The only thing I might possibly change is cutting it down to a half of an orange. as the taste of the orange was a little overpowering.  Maybe I would not include the entire peel and rind of it, just the orange slices themselves.  I used sunflower seeds instead of nuts, mmmm mmmmmmmm good!  Thanks for the great recipe.  :)

I've had pumpkin breads I liked better.  This didn't have as much flavor as I'd hoped it would have.  I added nutmeg and cinnamon but it still seemed to be missing some sort of kick.  I'd make it again, but not until I played around with the recipe.

This is fantastic!  I doubled the recipe, and made two loaves.  I left our the raisins (don't love them) and cooked for an extra 10 minutes.   I'm going to leave one loaf plain and top the other with an orange cream cheese frosting -  I baked these 4 hours ago and my kitchen still smells WONDERFUL!THANKS!

I followed the recipe as written, but used cupcake tins to make muffins. Cooking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, the recipe made 18 perfect muffins.

I wanted to try this recipe before making more for Thanksgiving. I think they will be well received by my whole family. They are sweet, but not to the elevation of dessert, yet a simple cream cheese frosting or orange frosting could easily bring them to the dessert level. These would be perfect for a tea party.

Soooooo moist and yummy!  We chowed through 3/4 of the loaf before it was even cooled off! Even my extremely picky five-year old loved it! 
My tweaks: I did 1c all-purpose flour & 1c whole wheat flour.  I completely forgot to add the nuts & raisins.  And I substituted 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon & cloves. I think it could use a touch more spice (because I LOVE these spices), so I'll probably increase it to 1.5 tsp next time.  And my orange was kinda small, so I think I'll use 1.5 small oranges. 
Thanks for this wonderful recipe! I will be giving a couple loaves as gifts for Christmas!

This bread smells really good!!! I took off one star because I didn't really like having the orange in there. I was hoping the texture would be more bread-like. It's just a little too fudge-like for me.

I absolutely love this recipe! I had to restrain myself from making any changes, like I always do, so that I could find out why this recipe is rated so high.  I am so glad I did.  Very fragrant and plenty of flavor.  Made one change-used whole wheat flour and baked for 70 minutes.  
You must try this recipe!!

YUM YUM YUM!!!  I wanted to make some type of pumpkin bread since fall is finally here. This turned out wonderful, filled our house with such a wonderful pumpkin scent. The only thing I did differently was instead of adding a processed orange, I added the juice of two oranges and the zest of 1. It turned out perfect, has a nice blend of pumpkin & orange. The outer layer of the loaf was nice & crunchy, didn't need anything added to it. Thanks so much for this recipe, I will definitely be making this during the holidays. Thanks so much!

YUM! I substitute chocolate chips for the raisins, pecans for the walnuts, and add the following spices from another recipe: 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger. Mini-loaves make wonderful gifts, or I often make a big loaf, slice it up, and serve it on a platter for parties. It always disappears and gets great compliments! Definitely cook a little longer.

I love this loaf!  After I've done the orange in the food processor I add the other "wet" ingredients, including the sugar and usually subbing oil for butter. I mix the dry ingredients and add them right to the processor, pulsing a few times to mix them in. Then remove the blade and fold in the nuts and dried fruit.  We love dates in this almost more than raisins.

I've had other whole-orange breads turn out bitter before, so I avoided this by taking the peel (orange bit) off the rind (white bit) with a veggie peeler, and then peeling the fruit.  I just used the peel and the fruit, and discarded the rind.  I went with cranberries instead of raisins, because I love the citrus/cran combo.  It turned out great!

I made this vegan style. Used canola oil in place of butter, omitted eggs (substituted with a tbs extra oil and 1/4 water).  Bread was very moist. Did not have raisins or walnuts (these would add more texture to the bread). There was a little too much clove flavor for my liking-next time I would use half as much (maybe replace half with Nutmeg?) All in all pretty good.

Delicious! Note that the dominant flavour is orange, not pumpkin. I made it exactly as the recipe states, except mine took about 75 mins to cook. Next time I'll line my pan in parchment paper because the bottom stuck. Will make again for sure.

This is a great quick bread recipe!  The orange supplies a little tang to the bread much like cranberries would.  This is a great bread base to experiment with other flavorings such as..fresh cranberries, dates, chocolate chips, pecans,.

This was surprisingly good--I did not expect orange and pumpkin to go so well together.  I used dried cranberries for the raisins, as that is all I had.  Very moist and flavorful!

Very moist. Kitchen smells wonderful. The orange and cloves are very powerful and kind of drown out the pumpkin flavor. To my husband it tastes like potpourri, so I won't be making it that often. But my 4 and 2 year-old kids and I enjoyed it. A great gift bread for a friend who enjoys orange flavor. Beautiful when sliced. (I omitted nuts and it was fine).

I didn't care for this very much, but I think it was just personal prefrence. I might make again, but I would just use the inside of the orange and zest it. The orange peices were a little too hard for my taste. But otherwise it would have been very good.

Yum! I used a blender to mash the orange and added the 1/3 cup of water to help it along - that seemed to work for me.

I thoroughly liked this recipe.  I had no problem with the slight bitterness from the whole orange rind (as I don't like things that are overly sweet) nor did I have a problem with the overpowering orange taste (as I like the orange taste better than the pumpkin taste and am still getting the benefit of the beta-carotene).  I used cooked fresh pumpkin rather than canned and baked the loaf 1 hour and 20 minutes because of the many people who complained of the loaf seeming to come out underbaked.  Mine came out perfectly.  I'm saving this recipe.

very good. never heard of using the whole orange before, but turned out very nice. I used whole wheat flour, and 4 egg whites to make a little healthier. this is great for breakfast, you get vitamin A, vitamin c, protein and fiber.

Imagine all the wonderful fragrances of the holidays: pumpkin, orange and spices. That's what this orange pumpkin loaf bakes up to be. I was a little skeptical about using and entire oranges, but the results are fantastic. I prefer dried cranberries to raisins so that's what I used. Otherwise, I made no changes to the recipe as written and suggest that you follow it as well. You won't be disappointed.

omgoodness gracious. this was so freaking yummy, but i felt like murdering the loaf during the baking process. it was literally in the oven for over 2 hours and still overly moist in the middle. i did everything possible to cook the middle, including slicing the bread before it was done cooking. and argh i was getting so frustrated. however, i think i may have been the one to blame, because i melted the butter and replaced half of it with applesauce. This made it practically fat-free and really moist, but it would not cook in the middle. also, for those who are as lazy as i am, there is no need to stick the orange in a blender. i simply peeled it, squeezed it, and then just pretty much added the extra chunks.

Yumos! I made this and my family loved the pumpkin and orange together, however, the orange is a little overpowering-I'll use less next time and I used 1/2 teaspoon cinammon, 1 teaspoon pumpkin spices, and subsitutes dried cranberries for the raisins.

This is the best ever recipe. I am diabetic and cut the sugar down to half the amount.  It was so flavourful and moist, that the kids didnt even notice the sugar missing.  I will make this again, but double the recipe as one loaf isnt enough.

Wonderful!  The orange really added a unique twist.  I also used dates instead of raisins, as suggested and it was fabulous.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used milk instead of water.  It made a little more than one loaf, so I made a mini loaf with the extra batter.  The texture was perfect.  Not a bit underdone on the inside, but I may have baked it longer than an hour.  I just baked it until a toothpick came out clean. Fantastic recipe!!!

I love this bread.  I've been making it for the holidays for 3 or 4 years now.  It has always been a hit with everyone.  I make my own butter for it with some "pumpkin pie" spice in it.  I love the way the flavors mix, but the bread is great with or without the butter.

This is truly a delicious loaf. My family wouldn't eat anything with pumpkin in it until I made this loaf. Friends and family can't get enough of it. Everyone who has tried it here has requested the recipe. I've even made it into muffins. It really is a "keeper"

Very good bread!  I made it for Christmas and gave as a gift, I made 1 for myself and we loved it.  I didn't put the whole orange in, wanting to avoid the bitter pith, I cut the peel off of the orange.  Then I removed the white layer and used the wedges.  This bread has a good balance of flavors between the pumpkin, orange and spices.  I added some chopped fresh cranberries also...what a wonderful holiday bread!

Overall good recipe.  Made a very moist, almost cake-like (in consistency) bread.  My changes: I swapped out the orange for two clementines to avoid the bitter taste that some said the bread had.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  I also swapped the raisins with dried cranberries (that I soaked in water to rehydrate then drained) for some tang.  All in all, very tasty and my company enjoyed it.  I would make this again.

I loved this recipe.  Made it twice,  doubling the recipe both times (and baking in 2 seperate loaf pans. ) The whole orange pureed really intrigued me.  I used seedless naval oranges. I also used my own pumpkin puree,  not canned. 

Each loaf came out dense but moist.  A little bitterness offset the sweetness in a delightful way.  Works well as a desert,  a meal accompaniment,  or a breakfast loaf. It replaced the traditional cranberry bread that I usually make on Thanksgiving.  I froze the 2 extra loaves,  but when thawed they were still perfect moisture,  texture and crumb. 

This is an awesome recipe and I will use again and again. The baking time varied,  the first batch took way longer than the recipe called for,  but the second time around it was spot on.  I think my oven was inconsistent.  Food processor and kitchen aid took the work off prepping all by hand.   I don't blame the recipe.  Love it,  love it.  Kids liked it and Thanksgiving guests were all pleased.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I did not use cloves and used nutmeg instead. Chose to use dates instead of raisins. I did however need to cook longer than suggested. Around 15 mins longer. Plus I topped mine with a orange glaze made from orange juice lemon juice and powdered sugar. Used a seedless orange with thin skin and it was  incredible.

Slight modifications: reduced sugar to 1 1/8 cups, used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 c white, replaced raisins with an additional 1/2 c walnuts, changed spices to 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/4 t allspice, 1/4 t cloves.  Required 75 minutes to bake.  Excellent - not too sweet, and no bitterness at all.  Next time I will try in 2 loaf pans and it made a very large loaf.

Instead of raisins I did craisins because I had them on hand. It smelled wonderful and people loved it. Although I felt it had too much flavor to it. It was a huge hit with those I gave it to for Christmas gifts though.

I was curious how using a whole orange would work so I made this. I do not like cloves so I changed up the spices 1 teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, 1 teaspoon vanilla.  It came out delicious.

Very nice flavor, definitely make sure to include the nutmeg. I do think it needs a bit more time in the oven, mine was a wee bit undercooked in the middle. 
Many of Carol's recipes have become my favorites :)

This was a huge hit with my family and in-laws. I used 1 cup of fresh pumpkin puree rather than using canned pumpkin.   The first time, I baked two mini loaves and had enough batter for a few muffins. The second time, I made one mini loaf for my family and made 9 muffins with the remaining batter. As a loaf or as muffins, this recipe is moist and delicious.

Great tasting Orange loaf.  I would have to say that the Pumpkin taste gets a little lost in this but it is still so full of flavor and delicious that it definitely deserves 5 stars hands down.  I didn't use raisins because of my kids but in my opinion that would have been great too.  I would recommend baking it longer because towards the bottom it was still a little uncooked. A keeper and great any time of the year though.

Everyone loves this! It's better than giving pumpkin pie for dessert, because it has less sugar and calories than pie.
The loaf is mostly sweetened with the orange instead of SUGAR! Thank you so much for posting this recipe. 
I have one cooling on the stove right now!

This is really very good. Not too sweet and not too orangey at all. Very moist as well. I did the orange in the food processor and it worked great. The only other thing I did differently was to use 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup of white flour. And Craisins, just because I had them. Very very tasty!

This bread is truly delicious.  It does need to be baked the whole time; shortcuts don't pay.  Because of the comments of other reviewers I decided not to add quite all of the mashed orange, and the flavor combination was sensational.

Kitchen Aid Blender is the way to mix up that orange! I love this recipe just as it is, the orange and pumpkin make the loaf moist. I've made about 50 of these since I first discovered the recipe! Friends and family ask for the recipe all the time, try it, you won't be disappointed.

I liked this bread. It is a heavy bread, but it is very moist. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used pecans instead of walnuts ( I hate walnuts)and instead of rasins, I used crasins. I figured cranberries and orange go great together and they did!

I used fresh cooked and pureed pumpking instead of canned. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I also substituted pecans for walnuts. It was great. I would use a little less orange next time. A very unique flavour for a loaf. I will be making this again.

I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and left out the nuts.  This recipe is awesome!  My mom is a super-chef and she couldn't duplicate it!  This is the first recipe I've had my family of chefs *request* that I make for Christmas.  Delicious!

I don't really "appreciate" sweet, quick breads - but this one is a winner! I doubled the recipe and used three mandarine oranges (311 grams total). Excellent. It made one regular loaf as well as five "mini" loaves. I put chocolate chips in some and dried cranberries in others - very happy!

I've made this several times now, both following the recipe exactly, and halving the orange and using more pumpkin. Both ways it turns out great.  I just made a batch last night by filling wide mouth mason jars half full and baking the bread in the jars. Those turned wonderfully, so I think I'll be doing lots more for Christmas.

This was fantastic, love the orange and pumpkin together. My recipe had some changes though. I used half whole-wheat flour in the recipe. I only used 1 cup of sugar per loaf, not 1 1/3 cups. I used macadamia nuts and chocolate chips instead of walnuts and raisins, and in my two-loaf recipe I used one orange and one lemon.

I also had to bake for an additional half hour in order to get the center solidified. Next time I will try a Bundt pan or cupcakes instead.

It came out very cake-like and sweet. We had it for dessert last night and for breakfast this morning. I would consider making it for a special occasion in place of cake!

I thought this bread was exceptionally good! The aroma as it is almost finished baking is wonderful! I really enjoyed the texture when it was warm. I iced mine with a vanilla icing, but it didn't really need any. One of my favorites!

Thanks Carol for this great fall recipe.  I didn't have raisens so I used dried cranberries.  I made the loaf for my ladies Bible Study group.  I should say my second loaf,  The first smelled so good baking I just had to sample it. Thanks again for sharing.

Really yummy. I wanted to get a strong orange flavor, so used 1.5 thin-skinned oranges from my neighbors, processed skins and all. Didn't have any nuts or raisins, so put in about 3/4 cup of oatmeal. Didn't want to use a "glaze", but did make a syrup of 1/2 sugar and 1/2 orange juice, stirred to dissolve the sugar. When I took it out of the oven, I poked the top several times with a fork, then poured the syrup all over the top. I usually do this to increase moisture. It worked very well, and I  got the strong orange flavor I wanted. Made this in an 8x8 pan. Will make again!

Moist and delicious. I added a bit more sugar because of comments about it being bitter, but it wasn't necessary. It will be perfect just the way it is. I used chopped dates and walnuts.

Holy moly this is addictive! I doubled the recipe and made 6 mini loaves to give away plus an 8 x 4 loaf for us. The two of us ate the large loaf in 2 sittings and everyone who got the small loaves have raved about it. The addition of the whole orange is GENIUS! I skipped the nuts and raisins and added leftover homemade cranberry sauce instead. I skimped a bit on the sugar and it was sweet perfection! Don’t be tempted to peel that orange!! JUST DO IT as written! Absolutely great recipe!

Used 5 whole Cuties peeled instead and left out the canned pumpkin. Used raisins but no nuts. Husband loved it and says it tastes like a huge soft oatmeal cookie!

I don't really do much baking, but I found this recipe relatively easy to follow and it came out great.  Friends and family had nothing but great things to say about it.  The only change I made was using golden raisins instead of regular ones.

Didn't add the raisins.  The family loved it. The 2.5 year old ate three slices. It is a hearty loaf, moving closer to fruitcake, but not that dense.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a very easy pumpkin bread to make but did not have any oranges and didn't like the other reviews as to say that the bread turned out to be  bitter.it was delicious without the oranges

This is the nicest pumpkin loaf I’ve ever made. A large, moist and light-textured citrus-y loaf.
I only changed the spices, substituting pumpkin pie spice, and I was generous with the walnuts and raisins. It needed another 10-15 minutes baking time in my oven.

I omitted the water completely and it still turned out on the moist side.  A large navel orange was perfect.  Using this recipe over regular pumpkin bread to bring to the family for the holidays!

Doubled the recipe; used oil instead of butter and cranberries instead of raisins. Made a dozen muffins and two large loaves. Moist and flavourful! Even better the next day.

I liked the bread but handled the orange differently.  I grated the the outside and juiced the rest not using the whole outside. It gave the bread a good orange taste without the rind taste.  I also added dates and it was so good to eat.  Shared it and it went over well.  A good coffee bread.

It's really good.  Forget the whole orange thing...bitter is never my favorite.  Zest a half an orange, use the juice with required water and a little less clove.  It took the full 60 minutes in a convection oven.

Wonderful recipe, I plan to make it over and over again! I used 1 part whole wheat flour to 3 parts white flour, and I used pecans instead of walnuts. The orange really makes the flavor pop! Even my picky teenager loves this bread!

I think this recipe needs more pumpkin - next time I'll add  another 1/2 cup.  Also like that it doesn't have a ton of oil in it like so many other pumpkin loaf recipes.  It was very easy to make - made mine in the bread maker and it turned out nicely.

I like the concept, but using the whole orange did make it bitter and gave it too much of a funky taste.   I think perhaps grating  all of the orange peel and discarding the rest of the rind would have been better.  Someone mentioned that it took 70 minutes to cook.  I did not have that issue at all - mine took about 55 minutes (and I could have easily pulled it out 5 minutes earlier), so keep an eye out since all of our ovens work a bit differently.

the only thing that makes this recipee tricky is not knowing how much liquid from the orange...cooking time can vary accordingly. I also préfère to add toasted pumpkin seeds rather than the walnuts.

I doubled this recipe and shared with friends and neighbors Rave reviews. The addition of the orange highlighted the pumpkin and made a moist and positively the most delicious  pumpkin loaf/bread I have ever tasted. The only ingredients I opted not to use was the nuts and raisins, simply because my family does not like either. I chose to whip up some cream cheese icing. Absolutely marvelous! Definitely a keeper.

This is such a moist, tasty bread!   Made just a few minor changes - decreased flour a bit, used pecans and Craisins, and made a powdered sugar/orange juice glaze for it.   It freezes well also.  This is a keeper!

I will definitely make it again!  I substituted cocoanut oil for the butter, and cranberries for the raisins.  It was fantastic!  What I would love to know is how long to cook it if I was to make mini loaf pans.

5 stars with changes! Since the white part, under rind, of an orange is so bitter, I ZESTED the entire orange, then JUICED it. It was super moist and added just enough orange flavor to it. Took well over the stated 1 hr to bake. I checked it after hr, then baked another 10 min, then checked it again and baked an additional 10 min. Also, here are my changes to the spices: 1 tsp cinnamon; 1/4 tsp of each: cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. Thank you for original recipe. It was a good starter and definitely a keeper.

Very tasty and moist bread, but I encountered two problems.  First,  it took a lot longer to bake than stated, and second, the amount of orange peel from a large orange is excessive and resulted in a slightly bitter taste.  I think I removed the loaf before it was quite done, but I solved that problem in a most tasty way - I reheated slices of the bread for about five minutes in a toaster oven (350 degrees) - not only did that solve the "under-bake" problem, but it really enhanced the orange flavor.  I will make this again and serve it warm.  Also, I used the entire can of pumpkin (not just 1 cup) and added nutmeg and ginger to the stated spices.  The additional pumpkin enabled me to make 1 loaf plus 12 muffins.

I wasn't sure if I should stick to the original recipe as the whole orange seemed odd and it called for a lot of cloves but decide to stick to it and it came out great. It has more of a spice cake taste to me, not a lot of pumpkin flavor but it was really good. Only changes were golden raisins and pecans as that is what I had on hand. Will definitely make again and have already passed the recipe to my Mom.

The only think I do different is I zest the orange first, then peal and throw the pealing away.  Follow the rest of the instructions.   I don't like the flavor that pealing leaves in the bread.

This was delicious! I made it just as it said, only added about 1/4 cup extra pumpkin. I made 3 mini-loafs and 10 mini-muffins. I will try it with different additions, like choc. chips and fresh cranberries and maybe a lemon/orange zest cream cheese frosting!

Yum. I don't normally review stuff, but I had to because this is one of the best loaves I've ever made. 

I didn't have enough white flour so I did half white/half whole wheat. Other than than, I really didn't change anything. 

The recipe is pretty versatile, I could see myself playing around with spicing and add-ins for variety not because the recipe isn't ok as it. 

So moist, and delicious flavour! I loved the idea of using the whole orange.

This is absolutely wonderful. I was a bit skeptical about the orange but it made the bread very flavorful. The only thing I didn't have any clove so I used allspice and nutmeg along with the cinnamon. Also I had to cook it longer but will definitely make again.

I used 2 halos instead of one large orange and it turned out delicious. I also devided the batter into two pans and cut the bake time in half.

I'm giving this a 4 star because my friends liked it.  I thought it was just ok.  Needs to bake for at least 1 hr 15 mins.  I took it out at 1 hr, I tested it and it seemed ok.  But by the time it cooled and I cut into it, the center section of the loaf was not done.  I had to cut out a good portion to be edible.

This is good. I read the reviews before I tried it and decided to go with 2 clementines and use only the skin from one. Ok this is where things went a little off because I set aside the process oranges and then I forgot to add them in to the first batch.... which was cooking by then soooo I went ahead and made another batch with the orange juice/orange peal. I made them in little bread pans... I have one that holds 4 mini loaves. The first batch without the orange juice made 3 denser loaves.... not bad really but not as tender and moist as the second batch which made 4. This is keeper!

This is delicious! I made it without the cinnamon (family member allergic to it) and it was still wonderful. So moist. I used a whole orange processed. Froze the bread to carry to a relatives home. It disappeared within 24 hours. I will be making this again. Thank you!

Just Fabulous!!! I was worried at first because the batter was very loose but it baked beautifully. I only used 1/4 tsp cloves & added an extra 1/4 tsp cinnamon and used pecans in place of walnuts.  Great with a cup of coffee!

Delicious, moist, mouthful, sweet, delicate, Beautiful!!! I had Tangerines, so I used them instead of oranges and exchanged half of the sugar for Sucralose. The outcome was a memorable pumpkin bread that will be in my Holiday menu from now on. Great dishes and Happy Holidays!

I felt like something chocolate, so I added dark chocolate chips, and drizzled chocolate on top. It was so delicious, chocolatey and moist. I did not use the orange rid, as I missed that in the directions, and used a tangerine, as that's what I had. I've bought some candied orange rind, to use next time, to boost the orange flavour. Also, doubled the nuts, 'cause I'm a nut Nut.

This cake is delicious, moist and very fragrant thanks to the orange. Do not peel the orange – use the whole thing, it really makes this cake.  The pumpkin flavor is very minimal (it does give the cake great color), so if your guests do not like pumpkin, they won’t even notice.  This is very easy to make, so easy that my husband (who never baked before) made this under my light supervision.  He loved the way it came out and the fact that he could throw the whole orange into it.  Try this, you will not regret.

This was delicious.  I made it just as it was written and I won't change a thing in the future.  I might mix up the type of nuts or change the raisins to dates just to try it, but it was delicious as written!

Amazing bread, definitely puts you in the holiday mood.  Mine turned out very heavy and moist.  Might have been because I used 3 small satsumas instead of 1 lg orange and there's was too much juice that way.  I substituted craisins for nuts since my son has a nut allergy.  Recipe made too much for my loaf pan.  Next time I'll put some into muffin tins.

This is the best pumpkin bread I have ever eaten!  I was a little leary about using a whole orange, but did so and was glad I did.  We do not care for raisins, so I eliminated them.  I also substituted pecans for the walnuts.  This is definitely a keeper.  I will be using this to make mini-loaves for Christmas this year.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! I did use Splenda instead of sugar. I made 6 muffins and put the rest in a bread pan. Some didn't seem to care for the orange peel flavor, so the next time I might peel half before I grind it. My husband and i thought it was amazing!!!!

This is SO yummy!  I wanted to use up a can of mikans so I substituted those for the orange.  This made the loaf very moist, maybe a bit too moist.  I also left out the nuts because I don't like them.  Even so, it is absolutely delicious and I will make it again very soon.

Fantastic holiday bread with a  wonderful aroma!  I used pumpkin pie spice, OJ instead of water, a little more pumpkin and cranraisins...it was ideal for my work holiday luncheon!  Baked it in a bundt pan for an hour and it came out perfectly.

I make this every Christmas without fail! Makes perfect small loaves for gifts and MUST have some for family and myself of course. This really is the best bread ever! The addition of the orange rind makes it very unique. Everyone wants more of this. Thanks so much for a perfect recipe!

Really good loaf, but I will also cut down on the orange a bit next time, as the pumpkin is overpowered. I also had difficulty with the food processor (small chopper) not getting all the peel into small enough pieces so next time I'll zest first. I had to pick all the big pieces out of the batter and cut them by hand! Yikes! Other than that, definately a keeper!

This recipe was good, but not my favorite pumpkin bread recipe.  I went with what the recipe said and I have to agree with the others, the orange flavor of one whole orange is just too strong.  I also left out the raisins and used splenda instead of sugar.  Also as a plus, it did stand up to my forgetting it in the oven for a while. :)

This was a very good, moist bread but, as others have said, there is just too much orange. I'd leave out the peel next time since that's where so much of the overpowering orange taste comes from.

Amazing! The nuts make it so don't skip them if you don't have to. Mine took  1hr 10min to bake.

I brought this loaf to work for my co-workers today as a Halloween treat.  It's moist and has a very unusual and fresh flavor.  It did take about an hour and ten minutes to cook, and I substituted nutmeg for the cloves.  It's delicious, and two of my co-workers have told me it's the best pumpkin bread they've ever had.  I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks, Carol!

I don't think I've had a pumpkin loaf this good, ever!  The orange and pumpkin make a perfect mix, and it stays moist for days.  I frosted it with vanilla icing and keep it in my fridge for a quick snack--The kids love it, and even if it does have a lot of sugar, it also has a great kick of Vitamin C!

So moist and the flavors compliment each other nicely. I am not a fan of pumpkin, but this is a recipe I will definitely make again...especially for company as the aroma that filled the house as it was cooking is perfect for a fall gettogether
