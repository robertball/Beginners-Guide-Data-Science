A great breakfast "coffee cake"  but not very appropriate as an after-dinner desert. Kind of crumbly.  But went great with coffee the next morning.

Looks pretty.  All of my chocolate chips sank to the bottom of the pan.  Next time I will pour all the batter into the pan, top with chips and then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar mixture.

This is definitely like coffee cake with a layer of chocolate.  Good to enjoy with a coffee or a glass of milk.  There wasn't a lot of batter so I was a little concerned about it rising but it turned out perfect.  Will make again without any changes.

I felt like this needed more chocolate. Instead of putting 1 cup of chocolate, I may put 1.5 or 2 cups next time. And I  would put the choclate in two layers instead of one. The family really enjoyed this recipe though. Thanks.

I grew up eating 'Crater Cake' and have always loved it.  This recipe, while still good, did not do it justice.  I tried it first and then tried one from another site.  The other recipe is just like I remember it from childhood. Use semi-sweet chips not milk chips though.  http://www.mycookingblog.com/post/1-valli/6803/Banana-Crater-Cake
