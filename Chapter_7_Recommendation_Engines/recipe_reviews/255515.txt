I made a few changes and this is now my favorite almond flour  pancakes.  I halfed the tapioca flour and sift all of the almond and tapioca flour together.  This lightens the final pancakes.

Great base recipe

I have been trying different paleo pancake recipes for months and am now happy to say “my search is over.” I made these this morning and they are awesome! Light, fluffy, and tasty. I did follow some advice from other reviewers. I changed the floor quantities to; 1-1/2 cup of almond flour and 1/2 cup of tapioca flour. I also mixed all wet ingredients in one bowl and all dry ingredients in another then poured the wet ingredients over the dry and whisked together just enough so it’s blended and still on the runny side. Oh! And now for the best deviation, I lightly folded in some frozen blueberries because, well they are tasty. Topped with some maple syrup.My hats off to the author for a great pancake recipe. Enjoy!

These were ok, but a bit dry. I think there was too much tapioca for our tastes. I will decrease the amount next time and use extra almond flour. The taste is delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

Best pancakes ever!  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe to the letter and I loved the taste.  After that, I tried slight variations - added vanilla, cinnamon, blueberries, nuts, etc., and the result is always the same: gone in minutes.  Thank you Eshug for sharing your recipe.

These pancakes came out pretty good. I added some cinnamon and used more baking powder than the recipe called for. The pancakes were gone in seconds!

Very tasty recipe. My modifications: 1 1/2 cups of almond flour and 1/2 cups of tapioca flour.  Also, cook on medium-low heat, otherwise they burn too fast.

It can out too runny :(* too much milk—we will try to make crepes instead with engineering.

Made these and followed suggestions to use have tampioca.   I also added half of a ripe banana to the mix.  I would use this recipe again, since they came out very good.

Delicious, but more like a crepe/ pancake hybrid  than a fluffy typical gluten type pancake. 
I hadn’t had pancakes in a 5 + years and  these satisfied every craving I was hoping. Easy and quick. 
I cooked them and in ghee, for a buttery taste since I’m lactose intolerant. I’ll definitely make these again!!

Excellent recipe. I adjusted slightly because the batter was a little thin for my taste. I added a little cassava flour to thicken it just a little bit. Otherwise great. thank you!

I didn’t have tapioca flour. I halved the recipe and put in 2 eggs. I mixed the recipe in my Ninja individualized blender cup that I use for my smoothies. Started by adding wet ingredients then dry. Very fluffy and tasty!

My family likes this recipe. I use almond milk - more than the recipe calls for, until it is thin enough to pour. Sometimes I add about 1 1/2 Tbs of oil and make waffles. Instead of using a cup of tapioca flour I use 1/2 cup and replace the other half with more almond flour. It’s a great recipe for those who are avoiding cooking with wheat.
