What a great Recipe to cook up all the Fresh Pumpkin Seeds we got from carving our Pumpkins over this Halloween Weekend.  I highly recommend that you Rinse and really clean your Fresh Pumpkin Seeds.  Then place them on clean paper towels, on a Baking Sheet, and air them out for at least 24-hours to remove the moisture.  Then follow this Recipe exactly, but turn them every 15 minutes and don't be surprised if they only take 30 minutes to cook (and not 40 minutes).

The Bomb, just delicious!  Here's another one that will be on my Christmas gift list this year.  This is my first time eating pumpkin seeds, and I went with the "raw" seeds, since these were being baked for 40 minutes.  Full of flavor, crunchy, with just the perfect balance of cinnamon-sugar.  Thanks, GMW, for a new snack!

I have made this twice, the first time I felt like they needed extra time because there is just so much butter that the seeds don't really toast and I ended up burning them.  The second time I forgot this but after the recommended 40 min. of baking I noticed they were just simmering in there so I removed the seeds from the oven, and drained the excess butter.  Then baked for another 20min.  They have good flavor and without the butter they toast up nicely.  I have also tried a savoring/spicy recipe which toasted nicely but we prefer the sweetness of these flavors.  Next time, I am going to try a different sweet recipe.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!  I was looking at reviews and they said to cut down on butter, so I did, but browned it and added extra cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Turned out (and I dare to say) better than my family recipe.  the browned butter and nutmeg+ the extra cinnamon made it absolutely delightful.

GREAT RECIPE!! First time is the charm with this one, easy to follow and hard to mess up. Preheated my oven to 300, and prepped the seeds like the recipe said. About every 10 minutes i'd pop it open and stir them around to keep them from burning. After 40 minutes threw them into a large bowl and added the sugar to toss. Re-laid them on the pan and let them sit till they were done popping. Best seeds I've had yet!

Super easy and makes the house smell delish! Added a little bit of a sugar and cinnamon mix and shook them up in a bowl to coat them so they are less sticky!

I changed the roasting temp to 170 to keep the oils and fats in tact and they were still wonderful and crispy sweet!

These were quite yummy! I used half the butter and half the sugar and found the bake time to be closer to an hour while turning the seeds every 20 minutes or so (I like the seeds a little crunchy). The butter had a wonderful browned flavor to complement the cinnamon and sugar. I'll definitely make these again!

Easy to make.. I added brown sugar instead of white...   into the after I added the butter mix and spread them out on the cookie sheet.   Should be a mess but I love the taste of brown sugar.   I also use 2 tbls and 1 tsp of butter.

I made a double batch using salted butter and I used about 3/4 the amount of sugar the recipe called for (I don't love things super sweet). Delish!

I was looking for an sweet recipe to counterbalance my garlic and salt pumpkin seeds and I came across this one.  OMG!!!  I made them exactly as the recipe directed and they turned out so good!
I baked the seeds for 20 minutes, mixed them up and baked for 20 minutes more.  It was the perfect baking time; they turned out perfectly.  Thank you AR, I'm definitely putting this into my fall rotation.

They are great! The only adjustments I made was doubling the recipe, I put it on wax paper and after tossing them poured them and all the extra sauce on them. I also added the sugar into the recipe then we added more sugar and cinnamon afterwards. I cooked mine in 10 minute intervals flipping them each time after the initial 20 minute cooking.

Very good. Turned out fine for me. Only change was that I did add sugar before baking. Didn't burn, just got nice and sticky. Crisped up nicely after 45 mins, stirring every 15 minutes.

Looked for a new flavor and this is very good and easy. If you love cinnamon and sugar this is for you. Wish I carved more than pumpkin this year. I'd make another batch. Baked for 40 min and turned every 5-8 min. Followed the directions exactly and toasted/tasty perfect.

I have tried roasting pumpkin seeds many times before and they always ended up thrown  in the trash. Not the case with these. I think they are very good. I forgot to set the timer, and I think I cooked them longer than 40 minutes, but they are perfect.

Like others said before, lower the butter to 2 tablespoons and add the sugar before baking. Coat all of the washed seeds in melted butter mixture. Wow, it was like pumpkin brittle. The sugar caramelized and the butter stayed liquid while hot. Immediately after removing from 300 degree oven maybe 5 min early, scoop them together in a pile with all the extra butter and caramel etc using a spatula. Then flatten to about a 8 inch round pile of hot seeds. Let cool completely and lift out of pan whole. Crack into pieces and yum!

No need for rinsing or butter, like Martha, it is ok to leave a little of the pumpkin guts on....super yummy. I used Ceylon cinnamon and coconut sugar. Also, you can make a spicy chili recipe!  Squash seeds are great too. Happy Fall!

This was fabulous even with my modifications! I used coconut oil instead of butter and Xylitol instead of sugar.

Used this recipe, used Agave syrup instead of sugar.  Great results and will do this again.

So, maybe toasted pumpkin seeds just aren’t my thing, but these were so-so.  Disappointed because I really do like just about anything cinnamon, whether sweet or savory.

This was really simple and super yummy. I washed and let my seeds dry and I'm not sure if that made them a little dry after baking.  I will for sure make them again but maybe cook them a little less than 40 min.

The recipe is easy to follow but I was not happy with the end product. The sugar didn't stick to the seeds.

I love baked pumpkin seeds! These taste absolutely delicious! The cinnamon sugar definitely gives it a brand-new twist that I find amazing and satisfies my sweet tooth! This recipe is certainly a keeper!
