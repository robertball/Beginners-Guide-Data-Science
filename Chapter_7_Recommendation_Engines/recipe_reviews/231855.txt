This recipe was fantastic! I added frozen blueberries to the chocolate chips and it was even better! This recipe makes me realize I don't need pancake mix to make wonderful pancakes.

I cut the milk back by a quarter cup and soured the milk with a little lemon juice. I also cut the baking powder back to a teaspoon and a half (I did not want the prominent flavor of these pancakes to be baking powder). The pancakes turned out light and fluffy. I got six medium sized pancakes out of one recipe--the kids ate them all.

Very nice!  Used one heaping tbsp of sugar and only had regular chocolate chips.  No matter...the kids still gobbled them up.  Thanks!

I was worried at first with how thin the batter was and how flat the pancakes first looked when I poured them, so after the first few I added maybe 1/4 c. more of flour.  Comparing the two I think I actually like the original recipe best.  The original pancakes puffed up nicely, and although still a bit thin, had a lighter more tender,  eggy taste.  The ones with added flour are thicker, but not as tender, and the flour taste dominates more.  The recipe is great as is!  Don't be thrown off by the super thin batter.

This recipe was good, but I did make some minor changes.  I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup and added a tablespoon of vinegar to it.  I also reduced the baking powder to 1-1/2 t.  Next time I think I will reduce the chocolate chips, as it was almost too much for my personal tastes. Thanks for sharing this recipe, OLIVIA, it was a big hit at our house!

Awesome recipe.  I didn't think there would be enough chocolate flavor with "only 1/2 cup of chips."  However, the final product was oozing with chocolate; any more would have been overkill.  Very good recipe comes highly recommended!

Cut the milk back to 3/4, cut the BP back- they were kinda flat- if they were fluffier- big hit. Any tips for that appreciated.
They ate them all anyways :)

I use almond milk and found that you need to use around a tablespoon more milk. Also made a second batch and used rehydrated crasins. It was amazing.

Delicious! Made a few adjustments to account for my "homemade " eggs lol our chickens lay small eggs so I added flour and such since I used two small eggs. I also used extra chocolate chips. They were so yummy!!

Went with Sarah Jo's recommendation on the 1.5 tsp of baking powder. Used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Cooked pancakes closer to medium than to low heat. Came out delicious. Made 6 medium size pancakes. Did the math, each pancake is about 17 g of sugar.

I was doubtful when the batter seemed very thin BUT I went ahead and they tuned out great! Do follow the directions and ingredients...1 cup milk means 1 cup whole milk, not skim, not fat free because that's what you keep in the fridge...whole milk will provide the richness and fluffiness, as well as the pan kid over the pancake as it cooks. This will essentially steam the pancake as it cooks over lower heat (I cooked at medium heat on an electric stovetop).

I made this recipe to the letter, and it was weird. You really do have to use a third of the batter to get it to cook properly and the result is a pancake that is crispy on the outside, dense and chewy on the inside—so not a classic pancake! Avoid this if that’s what you’re looking for, you can find a better recipe than this

Some were flat, some puffed up. it was hard to get the lumps out. Overall, the pancakes were good. Not too sweet, and we could not taste the baking soda.

A few suggestions: Substitute 1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg & 1 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon, 1/2 cup Rolled Oats or 1/2 cup Butterscotch Chips, 1 1/4 cups of water.

I Did not make any changes except the amount I made and I chopped up chocolate instead of using chocolate chips. I personally loved it and it did not feel too heavy and the chocolate definitely added a special taste.It was a huge hit  And everybody loved it + it was easy to make and the recipe was detailed.

I made the recipe mostly as written, I subbed regular chocolate chips for the mini and used gluten free flour. As written the pancakes were a bit thin but that could be adjusted by reducing the milk. My daughter still liked them but my 11 year old food critic said they weren't her favorite pancakes ever.

I love these pancakes! I’ve already made them 3 times and they always come out perfect. I use regular chocolate chips instead of mini since I only had regular and they still turned out great!

I quadrupled the recipe and only added three cups of milk instead of four as I like thicker batter and 4 cups would have made it watery.  But the flavor was excellent. Oh I added about a tablespoon + of vanilla to the batter as well.

It was yummy! I made it with regular sized chocolate chips which turned out to be too much chocolate. I also didn't use any sugar for less sweetness. Still, it was a tasty treat!

Wouldn't have stumbled upon this if it wasn't for my off-from-school-feeling-sick son asking for it.  Didn't change a thing and they came out perfect.  Totally made his day.  Thank you for this quick and easy recipe.

Great recipe! The batter came out smooth and not lumpy.  Love it.
