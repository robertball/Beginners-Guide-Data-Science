Flavour was good but texture was chunky/crumbly after freezing. I think this is because the pudding set while it was cooling in the fridge and was very thick when put into the icecream maker. Maybe try using 1/2 pkg pudding mix with regular amounts of eggnog and cream.

This is a great recipe..however I also put a Tablespoon (or more) of rum to a quart of the 'cream'..the consistancy is a bit thinner than the ordinary 'cream' but the "mmmMMMmmmm!" factor dOes make a difference!:)

The recipe is delicious but is a bit on the sweet side for me. I'm not a fan of instant vanilla pudding and the flavor comes through a bit so I wonder if there's a better substitute - maybe a custard mix? Otherwise was an absolute hit and the taste of the rum came through wonderfully!

I think I will try it but substitute the pudding for 2 fresh egg yolks and perhaps a tablespoon more of liquid...
