I made one change and that is that instead of using the Lite Spam and adding taco seasoning (sodium) to it, I just bought Chorizo flavored Spam, eliminated the taco seasoning, and called it good. I didn't really know how I was going to shred the Spam so I just cubed it and that worked just fine. Lastly I used a tortilla bowl mold and prepared my tortilla's that way to make individual taco salads. Fun fun fun! Thanks for the recipe and the idea!
