At first everyone took a really small portion, because honestly, this is one ugly casserole.  However, after trying it everyone raved about how good it was and went back for seconds.  The herbs definatly give a new twist to mundane green bean casserole.

This was a HIT at my Thanksgiving table!  Easy to prepare and different from your typical green bean casserole.

This is a family favorite at the holidays.  It's not a very pretty dish, but it sure is delicious.  I always cut back the salt because the cheese has a good bit of sodium and it can be quite overwhelming.

It was a very nice option instead of old stand-by - green bean casserole with mushroom soup. I'm not a mushroom eater so this will be our new casserole for Thanksgiving! Thanks!

This was easy to prepare, everyone liked it. I used 1 1/2 frozen bags(16oz.) of green beans. Thawed them for about 5 minutes in a strainer under cold water. put them in the casserole dish, then added the ingredients  

Definately a keeper.

Had this on New Year's Day.  It was an interesting way to serve up green beans.  I used 2 16oz. bags of frozen petite whole beans.  I then used the Parmesan that comes in a plastic container in the "specialty cheese" section.  The shreds were about 1/2" long and really added something visually to "dress up" the dish.  It was a bit salty so I will only use 1/4 t. next time.  Everybody loved it.  They left me just enough to taste it again so I could write up my review today.  Thanks for a really different twist on green beans!  I never would have thought to add bread crumbs like that.

Ick!  I love green beans, but this recipe was such the disappointment.  You would have thought the combination of ingredients would be a winner, but not this time.  My husband and I could not even finish what was on our plates.

I tried making this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and no one really liked it.  I would definately go with some of the other suggestions of more green beans and less breadcrumbs.  Also the parmesan was a little strong too.  It definately has potential.

This was NOT good. The first time I made it using the quick version noted at the bottom.  It turned out way too salty and wasn't edible.  I tried the recipe once more, following the directions exactly and I still didn't really like it.  It's edible, but I am boggled as to why it has gotten such good ratings.

I found this recipe way too salty. I would think about 1/2 the amount of added ingredients would be enough or use twice as many beans as it calls for.

I made these beans on the stove because  I am gluten intolerant, so I didn't use breadcrumbs. The combination of spices was really good. It was a hit with my family. However, I cut the suggested spices in half. At first, I did add all the full suggested amount of spices, but visually, I thought it was too much. I rinsed them off and started over with only half the spices.  My family said they were better then any beans they had in any restaurant. Oh, I didn't sprinkle the Parmesan on until just before serving.

Only so-so.  Flavor was good, but the beans came out very mushy and the amount of herb mixture was too much. I may try again with fresh green beans rather than canned, and lower the amount of mix.

I really enjoyed this dish. I'm not a fan of canned green beans, so I used frozen instead, boiling them for 3 minutes first. I used a 24 oz package of beans, and when I went to add the Parmesan herb bread crumb mixture to the beans, it seemed like too much, so I didn't use it all. My daughter thought it was a little dry and my husband would have preferred more garlic. I will definitely make it again with just some minor adjustments for my family's tastes.

I made this  casserole for my family the other night and followed the suggestions of another reviewer by using half of the herbs, cheese and bread crumbs.  Everyone loved it and agreed that it's a keeper recipe.

This is the most fantastic green bean recipe I have ever tasted. I loved it the first time I had it and went back for seconds. Everyone I serve it to is shocked at how good it is. I increase the green bean measurement and do less parmesan and a little less breadcrumbs.  Lessens the calories and fat and still yummy either way.
