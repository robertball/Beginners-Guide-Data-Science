Made no changes except had to cook inside due to rain (used the oven method for the meat and the gas stovetop to grill the pineapple and red pepper). The meat was flavorful and turned out well and everyone liked the salsa both on the meat and on chips.

I did not have a charcoal grill available, which was regrettable. I roasted it in the oven, and it still turned out fantastic. The pineapple salsa is very yummy. I think next time make this, I will cut the salt down or dlbrine time down, it was a bit salty for me. I did brine for 24hrs. Still delicious, and will definately continue to make.

I used all the ingredients as written, but I cooked the pork for 4 hours in my smoker, refrigerated it overnight, then finished the cooking in my oven. (I did this due to time constraints and rain). I grilled the pineapple on my propane grill. Everyone loved it! Next time I'll do it in the smoker for the whole time to get a more pronounced smoky flavor. The pineapple salsa is a must! Delicious!
