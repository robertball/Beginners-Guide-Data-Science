TRY THIS! Even if you think it may not be your thing, just try! It was delicious and so easy - I liked the presentation too. We didn’t have fresno chilies at the grocery store so I subbed with jalapeño. The fish cooked beautifully and the cabbage was also delicious. Everyone I cooked it for absolutely loved it too. This will be a staple recipe for me now. Thank you, Chef John!

It is truly amazing how delicious this is! Especially considering how easy and quick it was to make.  Even the cabbage was was great.  The hardest part is making sure you have all the ingredients.  Personally, I didn’t think the miso butter was necessary.  I had thick filets of cod so I split them in the middle and put a bit of the ginger, green onions, and peppers in there.  This meal was a huge hit at my house.

This was delicious - so flavorful and moist.  I suspect you could substitute parchment paper or a baking bag for the cabbage, but I haven't tried this recipe that way yet.
