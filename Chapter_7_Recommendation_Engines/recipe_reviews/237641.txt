Thanks for another great recipe Chef John.  I have yet to make one of your recipes that we didn't love.  Some people will say I shouldn't be rating this because I change the ingredients. I used chives (my plant was going crazy)and Gruyere(what I had on hand) but I think the point is the technique not necessarily the type of cheese or herbs. The instructions are perfect just make sure to make a double batch because they disappear fast.

I love gougeres; this is the first time I tried making them and they were very popular at our office cocktail party.   To all the folk who say they are not cheesy or have no flavor, they need to try different cheeses - a cheese they like since everyone has different tastebuds.   The better the cheese, the better the gougeres.   And if they deflate, it means they were taken out of the oven a little too soon; try turning the oven off, turn them over and leave for 5 minutes.    
Chef John,  I choose your recipes first - they are always a winner! Thank you ..... :-)

Made them exactly as the recipe says. They turned out nice, but we just didn't like the flavor. Maybe they would be better with some sort of filling. I may try them again with different cheeses, or add some garlic to the butter.

My first attempt wasn't very successful.  They tasted fine (I added garlic powder and used Gruyere cheese) but the puffs deflated as soon as I took them out of the oven.  For a family meal, they were great, but I would have been disappointed to serve them to guests.  The second time, I beat the dough for much longer and more vigorously than my first batch.  Much better!   They still deflated somewhat, but they were still pretty and tasty.  I used a plastic storage bag with an end snipped away to "pipe" the dough onto parchment paper, and all that worked well both times.  I'll probably make these again.

Fabulous cheesy puffs! They turned out perfect. Gorgeous golden brown, smell and taste amazing.  I used a nice aged cheddar. However, I had no fresh sage on hand, so I skipped it altogether and added some granulated garlic as per the recommendation of other reviewers. Amazing recipe as always, Chef John!

To avoid bland and insipid I added a couple of strips of crispy bacon minced and used cheddar.   I also added some minced fresh oregano

Made this per the recipe, perfect rise, no flattenage  (perhaps a Chef John term) but flavor was a bit ho-hum -- for that I fault the cheese.  I used what was marketed as sharp cheddar, but a pre-taste didn't come off a particularly sharp.  I'll try perhaps Parmesan with garnish of cheddar next time. This recipe begs for stuffing.

I think this is the same recipe I used and filled them with chicken , tuna and shrimp salad as small sandwiches.  As a puff pastry with just the cheese and herbs I think I need to try a different cheese, I used a bagged cheddar that was already shredded.  I really believe the cheese is the key.  I love the recipe and will use it again.

I put twice as much cheese as the recipe called for. I think that's what made them collapse, but they were delicious. Easy to make too.

Just LOVE these!  Made them once as is, and ate them with every meal.
I made them a second time, without Thyme; that was great! 
I made them a third time with more Thyme and Garlic added, that was SUPERB!  This little recipe is so versatile and perfect for every meal, I recommend trying it and experimenting with it, you can't go wrong!

We made these for Christmas Eve. I was a little nervous since others had theirs deflate, but ours puffed nicely.  I used Gruyere, and it didn't stand up well to the pepper. They had a nice peppery bite to them, but we couldn't really taste the cheese. If we make them again, we will try less pepper and more thyme.

I followed the recipe using my homemade cheddar cheese.  I did pipe the dough rather than scoop it.  They were so delicious Hubby and I ate them in one sitting.  Next time I’ll double the recipe!

These are super easy and tasty. The flavor doesn't blow my socks off but they are good enough to want to try some tweaking of the cheese to find the flavor I want. Definitely a good, reliable recipe though.

I have made these two times with the same result. they lay out flat much like a cookie, not a hollow ball?
I did cook them on parchment paper the first time. Second time I pre-heated the pan, then placed them on the hot cookie sheet, same result. Great flavor!!!!! No hollow ball.
What am I missing?

I'm going to make these in a few weeks. I am a total goat cheese and blue cheese fanatic. I think I will make them according to the recipe then fill them with either softened goat cheese or fill with a mixture of blue cheese and elderberry jam. Those will be the bomdiggity!

Not the taste I was expecting from a cheese puff, but I may be ignorant to how they're supposed to taste seeing as i've never had one before now. Seems like an acquired taste type of dish and I don't have that taste.

It is indeed true when it says you need very sharp cheese. I would personally half the ground black pepper, so it is a 1/2 teaspoon. And bring the baking temperature down to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Other than that it was a decent appetizer. Not my favorite thing of Chef John’s, but tasty nonetheless.

This was a good recipe. Not a whole lot going on though. It was at times bland. Nevertheless, it was a fun treat, and a good way to pass some time and eat a simple fun snack.

These were good. Just some flavor. I use the Gruyere cheese since most agreed this added flavor. I use garlic, but mostly I tasted the pepper. The recipe made around 16.

I baked these in mini muffin pans.  The puffs did retain their roundness.  I was not too impressed with the  flavour and texture  though.  They didn't taste cheesey and the texture was sort of chewy despite having baked them a few minutes longer than the recipe directed.

Made precisely as written, but turned out terrible. Never did rise anything like the photo, and tasted 'doughy', even tho they were baked thru. And I was so looking forward to what I saw in the photo... How could anything with that much butter be bad??!!

The taste was good, but the puffiness was not.  I don't know what I did wrong, but I lost about a dozen because they were a goopey mess. I added garlic powder which was flavorful. I'll try they recipe again, because my guests liked them.

They were good.  Good enough to make again probably, but I am used to giving Chef John five stars.
