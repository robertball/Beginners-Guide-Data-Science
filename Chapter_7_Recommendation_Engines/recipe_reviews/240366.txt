This was the perfect dish for a potluck at work. I didn't use the tomatoes but kept everything else the same. This was a huge hit and the crockpot was scraped clean. Next potluck I'll double the recipe as not everyone was able to get a serving. I highly recommend this recipe.

After 3 hours it began to turn to mush.  But it was tasty.  I added sea salt and garlic powder.  Used a mix of Gouda, cheddar & American.  And left out the tomato.  Very easy.

Modified recipe. 
Used goat cheese instead of cream cheese for more tangy flavor. Added chili (lean beef, red/green bell pepper, onion, 1/4 cup chili powder, tablespoon of cumin, cooked until beef is brown) to top and mixed together when finished. Yummy chili Mac and cheese.

Thought this was really good, but not as good as I was hoping for. It was a little bland, so I added some pepper which helped. Maybe next time I'll add some bacon to change up the mushy consistency.

My life changed from this dish. This Mac n Cheese gave me a calming of the soul. It is truly a master piece. I love it mushy.

It is very important to note that if you have a larger crockpot that this recipe will not work.

My new favorite crockpot dish! I make a pot of this and take some to work every day, and it lasts me three days (eight servings LOL nice joke). All my coworkers see or smell it and demand to know what it is.

Used every ingredient to the tee and added a teaspoon of garlic powder. Did not use the slow cooker after reading some reviews that it turned mushy. I cooked the macaroni noodles as directed, combined all ingredients except tomatoes in a pot to melt and combine. Added pasta, tomatoes and cheese sauce  in baking dish and then baked it. 
Turned out better than the small trial I made a few days prior. 
Thank you for the recipe. Will Be used time after time!

Left out the chilies and the tomatoes cause I have picky kids.  The family loves this recipe!  Be sure to spray your entire pot with cooking spray so the melted cheese doesnâ€™t stick.  Great game day dish that I will for sure be using!!

For an extra kick I used Velveeta with jalapenos and diced tomatoes with habernos.

I added Beef and one can of chipotle with adobo sauce. I changed the other ingredients slightly no whipping cream, dijon or tomatoes,  1/2 cup milk instead of one and 2 extra slices of cheese (~10oz). Turned out great if you want to add some meat and spice.

The cream cheese is a horrible addition.  It made the meal sticky and chewy.  The rest tastes excellent.
