I made this cake for the guys in my office on St. Patrick's Day.  It was a hit!  I did adapt it somewhat to make it a little lighter.  I used 4 eggs, 1/3 cup Becel oil, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup whiskey, 1/3 cup water.  I only used half a package of butterscotch chips and 1 cup chopped walnuts.

I baked the cake in a bundt pan and when cool, I pierced the top with a fork.  I then took the reserved chips and walnuts added a Tbsp water and melted the chips(along with the walnuts) in the microwave.  I stirred in a little icing sugar and 1 more Tbsp of the whiskey to make a glaze.  Then I spooned the glaze over the cake and let it set.  It was scrumptious!  The glaze makes the cake - you get the whiskey without the alcohol being baked out of it, but only a taste!  Slainte!  Kat

I made this cake for a group of friends. It was delicious!! One of the best things about it besides the flavor is that you SHOULD make it a day or two before you serve it. It only gets moister.

This is a great cake!  SO much better the day after, so plan ahead.  I used pecans instead of walnuts - just a personal preference.  I was given this recipe by a friend, and it said to reserve 1/2 cup (each) of the chips and nuts for the top of the cake instead of 1/4 (each) - I think I like that better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted a 10oz. bag of toffee bits for the butterscotch chips and was very pleased with the results. The candy pieces carmelized underneath the cake. It was delicious!

My Mother in law makes a similar cake. I made this twice.  I used chopped cherries, mini chocolate chips and walnuts. I omitted the milk and used Captin Morgan's Spiced Rum.  Excellent.  I agree with others on the butterscotch chips.  It made a mess of my pan.  Dust it with powdered sugar and you are good to go.  This is a great recipe for all those shaped bundt pans. Use baker's secret spray.

This is a wonderful cake.  I substitute a bag of toffee bits for the vanilla chips and it comes out even better since the toffe is suspended in the batter and melts as you bake it.  This cake is best at least 12 hours after baking but it never seems to last long once you cut it.  It is also the perfect cake to wrap and mail to friends.

I made this cake for my sister in law every year for the last 4 years for her birthday. Her favorite drink is Hennessy- With 3/4 cup add to this instead of any whiskey is wonderful. It's one of our families favorite desserts. And beleive me it is a meal all in it's own.

THis cake was really good. I didnt put the nuts in it cuz my husband hates nuts but turned out just as well. Looking back I noticed I used all the butterscotch chips for the cake and forgot to add any on top but it was still wonderful. Sprinkled with powdered sugar. Great!

This is a great recipe.  No changes should be made (I get tired of people changing recipes then rating based on their changes). Do make sure the butter is cold, VERY COLD when you mix the batter.  You'll get a thick batter that's hard for the butterscotch chips and nuts to sink through.  I put all my nuts on top as I don't care for nuts mixed into my cake.

Omg, this cake is awesome & has been a huge hit with family and friends. I made this cake 2 weeks in a row. I used Hennessey instead of Whisky, melted some butterscotch chips & mixed it with hennessey to glaze the top then sprinkled pecans. With the 1st attempt I did not use nuts but the 2nd attempt I used glazed pecans and both ways were equally great. My husband did not want to share the first cake after tasting it so I had to make another one in order for others to enjoy the experience of such a wonderful cake. I have gotten several request with offers to be paid a nice amount. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very moist cake with a kick from the hint of whiskey.  I added the glaze with confectioners sugar and whiskey too.  Left out the butterscotch chips to spare the calories and didn't miss them.  I will make this one again. **Do check the cake at 35-40 minutes. That's when mine was done.

I thought this cake was just ok. The butterscotch chips became sort of hard (I used Nestle), and at 50 minutes, the cake was very brown.  I wish I had checked it at 40 minutes.

I Make this cake for our annual whisky-tasting parties and it is always a big hit.  The cake is moist and tasty and the butterscotch chips and nuts sink to the bottom to form a sweet and crunchy crust.

Delicious!  Everyone who has tried a piece is giving it rave reviews. I just made it last night, and I'm already getting requests to make it again.  I followed the recipe, except for adding the walnuts (not a nut lover).

I did make just a few changes to meet my pantry contents.  I used a butter cake mix in place of the yellow box mix and just 1/2 pack of butterscotch chips (thats all I had). This cake is so delicious I just adore the combination of the whiskey flavor and the butterscotch chips.  I baked for 65 minutes and the cake is both slightly crisp on the crust but so moist inside.  I will certainly be baking this again!

AWE-SOME!  I followed the reviewer's suggestions and reserved half cup of the chips and walnuts and made a glaze out of it.  Could have used even a bit more glaze.  How do you keep the chips from falling to the bottom?  They got stuck on the bottom on the pan.  Will definitely make again!!!!!

This cake was very moist. However the flavor was only so-so beceause the butterscotch chips all sank to the bottom and kinda burned into a sticky bitter syrup. Also it looked too plain so I sprinkled it with powdered sugar. I think I'll omit the chips next time, or just sprinkle some on top.

I disagree that the taste and texture is just right.  Like other reviewers, I found that the butterscotch chips were too heavy to blend into the cake batter, resulting in a cake that was hard to cut and serve.  In addition, the butterscotch chips remain hard in a cake with a tender crumb (all those eggs!)  The whisky flavor was good, enough to stand on its own without the chips and nuts - but then it would be a different recipe.

Excellent Cake!  Easy to make, and perfect the way the recipe is written.  I like the crunchy bottom crust that formed from the morsels.  We all don't like nuts, so none were added.  My daughter raved about how good it was, still warm, out of the pan.  Can't wait to have more tomorrow (since the reviews are saying it's better the second day!).

This was definitely an easy cake to make. I would suggest checking the cake after 40 minutes because 50 minutes in my oven turned the cake dark brown. I wasn't sure I liked how all the chips sunk to the bottom; next time I make this cake I would add less chips to the batter and more to the top of the cake.  The cake would most certainly be better with icing--something with whiskey in it. A couple of reviews here had good suggestions which I will try next time.

This cake is nothing short of amazing!!   So easy to make.  I put it in a tube pan rather than a 9x13, Beautiful.  Everyone said it was beyond bakery quality and I'm not talking about grocery store bakeries.  Going to give my daughter the recipe, new family heirloom recipe!!  Thank you for sharing!!!
