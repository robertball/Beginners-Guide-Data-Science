Great recipe to add to my rotation for 2020! I added more pepperoncinis AND juice than suggested and will continue to as it gave a nice boost to the flavor profile!

I followed the recipe exactly and I found the flavor of the meat rather bland.  In addition, my meat turned out tough and wouldnâ€™t shred which made this even more disappointing.  I will try again with a better cut of meat and see where we end up!

Soooo good!  We like a little kick to our food so I added pepper flakes!  Had it as sandwiches, over needles and with mashed potatoes  have another batch in crock pot for a potluck to serve on mini Hawaiian rolls.
