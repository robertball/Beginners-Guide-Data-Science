Do yourself a favor and make these cinnamon rolls! This recipe was so unbelievably easy, I almost wanted to cry! No yeast, no waiting for the dough to rise! Just mix the ingredients together, knead, roll, plop them in the oven, frost , grab a coffee and enjoy! I was skeptical to try this recipe, but I'm sure glad I did!

I almost always mess up when making cinnamon rolls, so when my 5 year old requested cinnamon rolls instead of cupcakes for her birthday, I thought I had better try out a few recipes. These rolls came out perfect for me! They're just the right size for my kiddos. 

My changes: I doubled the recipe  (4 rolls would not have been enough in this house), used bread flour instead of APF (grabbed the wrong bag, oops) and left out the white sugar for the filling (totally forgot to add it). I was able to get 9 lovely rolls, and I baked them in an 8x8 glass baking dish for about 18 minutes. Used a cream cheese frosting  from this site. It was delicious!! Thank you Nina!

These cinnamon rolls are AMAZING!!! So light and fluffy, not overly sweet, and super easy. Even better with icing. (Hint: Add the icing while cinnamon rolls are still warm. It almost melts into the cinnamon rolls. So good!) And don't let the apple cider vinegar discourage you. I doubled the recipe and they were all gone within an hour.  I will totally triple the recipe next time. I cannot believe how delicious and easy these are. So hard to stop eating this cinnamon goodness. Would give it 10 stars! Only thing is, why does this only make 4?! I've doubled the recipe every time and gotten 9 cinnamon rolls. I pay my little brother a nickel to help me, haha. I love how little time it takes to make.(Who has time in the morning to wait hours for dough to rise?).I'm definitely not a pro baker, (I'm only 12!), but these always turn out perfectly. :)

These were so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly except for the dimensions of rolled out dough. I wasn’t too worried about the appearance of mine, so I just rolled it and cut slices from that. Instead of baking in a muffin tin, I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper. I used a basic glaze (combine 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons milk, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla). Will definitely make these again!

Ok...just made them these are so yummy! I made a double recipe and substituted the apple cider vinegar for 1/2 lemon squeeze and Added a apple sautéd in some butter and mashed it up then  I mixed this with the brown sugar cinnamon and added some nutmeg. It made a paste, spread it on and rolled it up..baked in 13 minutes.

I made 5X this recipe, as I’m cooking for 3 adults and 8 kids. We cleaned out the pan of 22 cinnamon rolls in one sitting! I personally like the traditional cinnamon rolls better, as these tasted like a cinnamon rolls style biscuit, but these more than quarter the work time! Will definitely make this again!!!

I doubled the recipe and made them with Gluten Free flour. I made mine mini rolls. Everyone Loved them. They actually thought I bought them not made them.

This was wonderful - a keeper for sure. My very pregnant daughter-in-law requested cinnamon rolls when I visit later this month, but I've never tried to make the original yeast-based ones. And  now I never will! These worked just as promised, and were quick and easy with just basic ingredients I had on hand. They taste wonderful! Instead of using a muffin tin I put them in a small Pyrex dish touching each other. As a result they took longer to bake, but were easy to get out. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

These were delicious!!! They are easy to make and super moist!  I happen to have some buttermilk and used half regular milk and half buttermilk. We had to stop ourselves from eating them all!

I doubled the recipe and cooked the rolls in a cast iron skill which added about 5 minutes to the cook time. They came out wonderful. They are a hit at my house and I will be making them again.

I love that these cinnamon rolls are easy to make! I doubled the recipe and I was able to make 12 rolls. I arranged the rolls evenly spaced in a 9-inch cast iron skillet instead of baking them in a muffin tin. They rose quite nicely. Drizzled with glaze, these are decent alternative to their yeasted counterparts.

Sooo good! And sooooooooo much easier (and faster) than regular cinnamon rolls.  I did have to use more flour than the recipe called for. Unfortunately i just added till i got a good consistency so i don'tactually know how much extra I used. I used dark brown sugar instead of light. Otherwise followed the recipe. They were delicious as is. Even cold a couple of hours later. Adding chopped pecans and a glaze would take it to another level. I will definitely try that next time.

After reading other's reviews, I doubled the recipe and sprinkled pecans over the cinnamon mixture just before I rolled the dough. This was a great recipe that I'll definitely make again! It's super quick to pull together, and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Great last-minute treat!

This is a great recipe, don't be scared because of the ACV, very yummy and soft, I did everything as directed in the directions and didn't change a thing, if you want a more cinnamon flavor I would suggest adding another 1/2 or 1 tsp more, but I really liked it as is! Highly recommend, but I was too hungry to take a photo sorry!

Easy.  Forgot the cinnamon on the first batch.  Turned out great....just needed cinnamon. Second batch I included chopped pecans and Craisens. Topped with a 10x sugar, milk and vanilla mixture.  Better than Cinnabon!

These rolls are amazing!  As my family drinks skim milk I replaced half the milk with heavy cream.  Given that the rolls are baked in muffin tins, the outsides are crisp and biscuit like,  but the insides are cake-like, almost like a muffin.  After removing the rolls from the tins I frosted them with a cream cheese frosting.  I have added a picture showing a cross section of a roll and the delicate crumb.

it was awsome! they were so delicious and super easy to make. I would recommend to anyone who makes it to use cupcake cups so the removal from a muffin pan is much easier. I also found a glaze to put on top, and the end result was great. It was all around appealing. visualy, tastefuly, and not time consuming. LOVE IT.

Very tasty. A little more biscuit-y texture, rather than a soft Cinnabon, but great for when I need a quick dessert. I will make it again.

Excellent and easy! Used coconut sugar instead, with no glaze, and they were delicious!

These were good, effortless and easy to make. In my opinion I felt the cinnamon rolls were dry. I did not use a frosting which could be what was missing from this recipe. I would double the recipe and cook the cinnamon rolls in a 8x8 pan coated with butter spray to keep in some moisture & make a 1 Tbsp confectioners sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, dash of milk icing topping. That might yield better results.

We loved these little cinnamon muffins.  Don't know if  I could really call them "rolls."  The dough was a bit sticky so I placed some saran wrap to help with the rolling-up step.  Topped with cream cheese frosting from this site.  I wish I could have taken a picture of my family licking the frosting off.

This recipe is amazing. As a 13 year old who spends a lot of time bored lately, this have me something to do that was easy, super fun, and very simple. I'll definitely be making these again. I used lime juice instead of Apple cider vinegar, and doubled the recipe. So yummy! It definitely cheered up my family when they came home from an unsuccessful hunting trip.

These were okay for a quick craving and easy enough to make. They are tasty enough, but would not trade for the recipe with yeast that I always make...since it makes about 16 midsize to large size buns...this recipe makes only 4 small buns and you need to double or triple the recipe to make it worth your while and dirty dishes :).

Seemed like they would need some drizzled frosting but no, they are delicious and moist without it.  

I did make 2 substitutions:  I only had white whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar.  Both worked out good and next time I will also try substituting monkfruit for the white sugar.

They were delicious.  When I make them again I will probably double or triple the recipe.  Getting out all the ingredients for 4 rolls was a little much.  My husband liked them but said they weren't quite as good as my yeast rolls but they sure were a lot less time consuming.  They were hot out of the oven for breakfast.  I baked them in my toaster oven that is also a convection oven, so I didn't have to heat up the big one.   Chopped nuts might be a delicious addition.  All in all very good. I followed the recipe exactly.

Great faux cinnamon roll recipe! Tastes a bit more like a coffee cake rolled up due to the texture of the bread, but that’s expected. Easy and quick, no waiting for dough to rise which is great. But definitely not as good as traditional cinnamon rolls. Drizzled carmel sauce over the top of mine. I’ll definitely keep this for the quick cinnamon roll fix!

I was so happy to find this recipe.  Love, love, love cinnamon rolls but the real ones take too much time and planning.  After reading it, I realized it's just a biscuit dough recipe dressed up a bit.  I abandoned the recipe almost entirely and used my own southern buttermilk biscuit recipe, but kept the sugar in the dough part.  

IMPORTANT:  this recipe will not make enough rolls  unless you are a family of 2, because after you eat one, you'll want another!

ALSO IMPORTANT:  this recipe does not include icing, like all the pictures show.  I made a cream cheese glaze using milk, butter, cream cheese, and confectioners sugar; warmed up on the stovetop.

Followed recipe exactly.  Seemed like too much brown sugar and cinnamon to me.  Tasted OK but more like cinnamon biscuits.   Hubs loved them so probably will make them again as they were very easy - but will go easy on the brown sugar and cinnamon.

I made these this morning and was disappointed.  The texture was weird. Not at all like a cinnamon roll.  If you like the texture of biscuits you may like this recipe.  Really nothing can take the place of a yeast cinnamon roll. I won't make this again.

Yes,  had to add more milk and tablespoon more butter to get dough pliable to roll out.

Nice soft dough.  Not to sweet.  Next time I'll add raisins to the dough and ground nuts in the filling.  Tomorrow?

Easiest thing I’ve ever made!  They are beautiful!  Used a powdered sugar/milk/vanilla glaze.  I will be making them often!

5 stars for the effort to reward factor. I still like yeasty cinnamon rolls better, but to save an hour, I'm in on this recipe. made as posted, but I'd try adding raisins and/or apples to my next 2 batches.

Flavor was there but the batter definitely came out too wet (I doubled the recipe as well). I kept sprinkling in additional flour until I reached the right consistency.   It didn’t wow the fam but I think with some adjustments it would be great. I’ll definitely make it again.

Dough was incredibly sticky and impossible to roll out in that consistency, ended up having to add way more flour then the recipe called for as there was no way the dough being that sticky it was going to be rolled out it was sticking to everything! I could tell before I even started to mix it that it was going to be incredibly sticky as the amount of dry ingredients to the amount of wet ingredients was way off.

Very good and easy to make. The only change I'll make next time is less sugar in the cinnamon-sugar mixture

Wasn't sure how it would turn out without yeast but they were awesome! Almost tasted like a mix between corn bread and a cinnamon roll.

This was a good recipe, but there was not much cinnamon flavor. But overall, they were good and my family loved them!

I'll admit I had NO hope for this recipe, but to my surprise they turned out great! They had a delicate taste, and are so yummy!! Great recipe for no yeast cinnamon rolls!
