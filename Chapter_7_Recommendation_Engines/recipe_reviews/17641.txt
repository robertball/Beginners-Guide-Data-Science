This was very good!!  My whole family loved it.  I changed it a bit and it turned out GREAT!  I took a big zip-lock freezer bag and added 1 cup of white wine..my favorite white wine. I poured it into the bag, add the cut up chicken breats and then I added all my favorite spices (pepper, season salt, garlic powder, garlic salt, greek seasoning, paprika and a little bit of cayenne pepper). Zip up the bag, put it in the fridge to marinate for 1 hr.  I follwed the rest of the directions, but added broccoli to the recipe.  When adding the teriyaki sauce at the end, I added 3 tbs of teriyaki sauce and then 3 tbs of Yoshida's gourmet sauce..added a little bit more of my spices and VOILA...delicious.  Hope it turns out great for you!

I am in no way a good cook but this really did it for me. As I was cooking it, I thought there was no way it would have enough teriyaki. It came out perfect! Yay for this recipe!

I guess I'm kind of alone in this, but I just did not care for this recipe.  I thought it was plain and I like a more robust teriyaki flavor.

This was nice.. I marinated it all night, it was nice and flavorful. I also added about 3 more tips more teriyaki sauce.

Turned out WONDERFUL!!
My husband is not crazy about chicken, and it takes ALOT for him to say "This chicken is good" much less "Great"!
But, it was accomplished with this recipe.
The only thing I changed was adding accent, garlic salt, and black pepper (just adjustments for pallet preference) and put 3tbsp vs 2 of the teriyaki sauce.
Put it over fried rice recipe I have, just turned out Wonderful!
Great job and Thank you Elliot!!

This recipe was good.  I think my husband liked it much better than I did though.  He said it was much better than the frozen stuff you use to make stir fry.  I thought it had just a bit too much soy sauce taste to it.  I added a red bell pepper and didn't stir in the extra cup of wine at the end.  My husband and I have learned that in the past if a recipe calls for wine we usually half that and add water or broth for the rest otherwise we find the wine taste too overwhelming.  I will probably make this recipe again.

Too dry, no flavor...and hours of prep (and money) I started at 5:15 and finished at 7:00 just to cook the meat (on Medium-High. Yes, I did drain it for about 30 minutes before hand) just trying to get rid of all the wine. This recipe is incomplete. 
This recipe is not for flavor adventurers. I had to add 4X the teriyaki, garlic powder AND onion powder... the chicken still did not come out to that of the picture. I added pepper, from reading a review...that made a huge difference in flavor. This meat would be great in a complete recipe using a sauce to moisten it and something to "play" with on flavors. The taste was okay...but not worth the time or cost. You want the same recipe? Put chicken in a pan and add teriyaki.

This was pretty good.  Husband loved it, 4 yr old picky eater and I liked it, 7 yr old and another 4 yr old didn't like it (but ate it).  I think the kids just prefer a sweet brown sauce which this is not at all.  I followed the recipe but decided to use a little cornstarch at the end for a thicker sauce, and added broccoli to the onion & pepper. Next time I'll add a little more teriyaki sauce and a little less wine.

I made this recipe and it was fantastic.  I used orange pepper instead of green and red onions.  I used steamed asparagus and cottage cheese for sides.

This was AMAZING!! I used half the wine and double the teriyaki sauce. Put it over whole wheat rice and had soy sauce on the table (mmmmmmm!!!) I will definitely be making this again.

Definitely a great new way to cook chicken, perhaps a little soy sauce could liven it up a bit

I just made this for the first time. Turned out fabulous! But I did make a few changes. I listened to what a lot of the other reviewers wrote and put less wine and more teriyaki. In fact my marinade was probably a third part teriyaki. I added 4 cloves of garlic to sautee with the onion and pepper and I added a lot of extra garlic and onion powder, some paprika and some red pepper flakes to give it more pizazz which worked out great! Lots of flavor. I prepared it with white rice and baked asparagus with garlic and parmesan as a side. Overall would absolutely make again! Just be sure to season it to your liking.

My family loved this recipe.  They don’t usually like when I try new things.  I substituted chicken broth for the wine and increased the teriyaki sauce to 3 tablespoons.  This one is a keeper

Added some crushed red pepper to oil and chicken, gave it a little kick!
Liked it!
