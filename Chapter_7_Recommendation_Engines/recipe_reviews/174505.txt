My husband and I tried out this recipe right after getting it.  To make healthier, I used low sodium broth, non-fat 1/2 & 1/2 and a jar of Bertolli vodka sauce (we don't have a great selection in my area).  Added more mushrooms than the recipe called for.  Absolutely fabulous.  This is great served with a pinch of parmesan cheese on top and either a grainy whole wheat bread or mini grilled cheese sandwiches.  Delish!

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, but I am glad I did. If you wonder what this will taste like, just imagine a VERY creamy tomato soup. I worked at a restaurant called Silver Spoon and this is identical to their creamy tomato soup. It is supereasy and tastes decadent. Next time I am entertaining I am going to add this (let them think I slaved over the soup)! I did add extra diced tomatoes, but other than that I did not change a thing. YUMMY!!

My awesome neighbor made this last night and the only changes she made was she added turkey Italian sausage.  It was magnificiant and I loved it as well as my husband and my mother (who was in town visiting).  We each had a sourdough roll and it was just fabulous!

easy and delicious!!  Really fast too.  I used a different brand of vodka sauce, but stuck to the same measurements.

Used Mario Batalli's sauce and added just a little salt and parm cheese. This is quite impressive for being so quick and easy. Used my panini press with some sourdough and havarti to dip in the soup and it made for a great weeknight meal for a cold evening.

I was pretty excited about this recipe and ended up a little disappointed.  It was ok but a little thin for my tastes.  I think if I make it again I will use cream instead of half and half.
