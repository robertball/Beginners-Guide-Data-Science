I have never rated a recipe until now.  This is absolutely terrible. I guess I will keep searching for a 5 star cheeseball.

Made this for an appetizer/snack on Christmas day. Really great flavor. I made it into two smaller cheese balls, and it was a big hit. YUM!

We made this for our work Christmas party but we used chopped green olives stuffed with jalapenos, it was a little salty, but the added spice from the peppers was great.
