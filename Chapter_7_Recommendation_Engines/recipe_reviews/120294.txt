What a perfect way to make use of leftover rice!  Hubby said, "This tastes just like the stuff from a Chinese restaurant...only better."  To make this more authentic, I didn't cook the egg right in the rice mixture.  I cooked it in a small saute pan like a crepe, then added it chiffonade style. (Roll the "egg crepe" up like a cigar, then slice into ribbons...then add to rice mixture just before serving) Beautiful and delicious dish!

yes!!!! this is what fried rice should taste like.  The most important thing is to use cold rice! I have tried recipe after recipe and they are always gross because I have never used cold rice.  

The only changes I made was to add some extra veggies (steamed broccoli and snow peas instead of frozen peas) and I left out the parsley caus I am not a huge fan.  I added a dash of ginger and a dash of seaseme oil as well. 


This recipe is very versatile and that's part of the point of fried rice, to get rid of the left overs in your fridge. I can imagine adding ham or chicken to this and it would be delicious as well.

Thanks for the great recipe!

We liked this alot...I added broccoli, and diced a small white onion because my green onion did not look fresh, half soy sauce and half teryiaki sauce from "baked teryiaki chicken " recipe from this site. Served this on the side of the chicken...Will definately make this again!! The only thing that I will do differently is to scramble the egg by itself then add it at the end- when I added it into the mix, it really did not scramble, it just kind of mixed in with the rice and veggies and you didn't have pieces of egg like you do in restaurant style fried rice. Other than that, it was great!

very tasty fried rice! I cooked the rice early this morning and when it cooled I left it in the refrigerator to chill until ready to cook. I sauteed the diced carrot, green onions, fresh parsley, and one piece of garlic clove, chopped. To that I added the frozen peas and cold rice. I seasoned with soy sauce, little salt and black pepper, to taste. I cooked the egg like an omelet and then sliced them up in strips and garnished the fried rice. A tasty alongside, "Orange Pork," and "Garlic Broccoli Spears," also on this website!

I enjoyed this better than from my usual carryout chinese. Less greasy and I increased the amount of veggies.
I did saute the onion and carrots before adding to the rice and used a red onion since that is what I had on hand. Brown rice and left over pork worked well with the combination of veggies and eggs.
Variations abound with the basics.
Thanks for a simple and delightful dish!

Very good. I followed the basic recipe but added a few things. I added some sliced celery and chopped pepper, and I grated the carrot instead of dicing it. Next time I'm going to use 2 eggs instead of 1. I've made this a few times, each time using what I had on hand, and each time it came out great! Oh and I saute my veggies a little first before adding the COLD rice.

I didn't have any frozen peas or any carrots, so I just used 1/2 cup of frozen mixed vegetables, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted great!

Perfect! Better than takeout. I left out the parsley because I didn't have any, and I added yellow onion and shredded cabbage. I will definitely make this again next time I have leftover rice. Thanks!

Very easy and very good!  I think I used a touch more oil to prevent sticking to the pan.  Make sure you keep things moving until the egg is set, it'll stick in a flash if you're not watching it.

Easy recipe with good flavor.  I used rice I had made with chicken stock.  I think next time I'll just use plain white rice.  Either way a good, simple recipe that I'll use again!

Very similar in taste and look to those in Chinese restaurants, but with a lower price tag. I used freshly made rice, and so the end result was more moist than what you'd expect in the take-out box. I used a small yellow onion, skipped the fresh carrot since I used a frozen veggie mix (peas, corn, carrots, etc), omitted the parsley, added 3 cloves of minced garlic, full teaspoon of jarred minced ginger and needed a little more soy but I opted to use a little "Mama Sita's BBQ Marinade" instead for a little sweetness. I used seasoning salt instead of the regular. Would definitely make this again using leftover rice and adding protein to make a main dish. YUM!

This is a good rice recipe!  I followed the instructions and prescribed amounts for each ingredient and it turned out nice!  However, the amount of soy sauce should be reduced by half.  I served this side-dish with caramelized baked chicken and stir-fried peppers and it was a good combination!

This was excellent! I cooked jasmine rice with a tsp of chicken bouillon granules then refrigerated. Added a tsp of minced garlic and 1/4 minced sweet onion plus a HUGE splash of sesame oil to the cooking oil, To make this easier, I used 1/2 c of frozen pea/carrot blend, and 2 eggs. Great rice, we all loved this! Add a little diced ham or other meat and this could be a meal in itself, it's that darn good!

Came out very tasty, but I was iffy about adding the egg, which I don't think enhanced the texture of the rice at all. I added a little butter (1tbsp) to the rice when it was nearly cooked which seemed to remedy the texture of the egg! Very tasty overall.

This is a great recipe! So good and so easy to make. I used a little bit more soy sauce than called for, and I would saute the carrots before adding everything else since they were still crunchy at the end. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Came out very good. Used canned instead of frozen veggies because that's what I had on hand. The cold rice is the key. I did have to add a little more terriyaki/soy sauce though.

I loved this! I used brown rice and double the egg, used yellow onion instead of green. Those are the only changes. I will definitely make this again. Great side dish to the honey soy pork steaks.

We had an untraditional Thanksgiving dinner this year and served Asian turkey tenderloins.  This side dish was the perfect compliment to that.  This eas easy to make, but I have to say, this maked way more than 2 servings.  We have a family of 5 and after dinner, we had leftovers.

This was tasty, easy, and had great texture.  Cold rice is a must!  I was worried this was a little on the mushy side but very much enjoyed this nonetheless.  I cut up the carrot into pretty small pieces as I didn't want to have the carrots being the only hard or really crunchy part of the receipe.  Worked well.

If you don't have leftover cold rice, I would recommend that you wait until you do to get the perfect result. Break up the rice with your fingers before adding to the stir fry so there are no clumps of rice. I also used 1/4 lb of ground lean pork seasoned with a 2 teaspoons of Annie Chun's Korean Barbeque sauce. I did cook and slice the egg separately like naples34102 and seasoned my egg with white pepper and chives. And I used 1 tsp of soy sauce with 1 tsp of sea salt at the very end of stir frying.

I used brown rice and a variety of veggies. I also used stir-fry sauce instead of soy because that is what I had on hand. It was really good and a lot healthier than take out version. I followed other suggestions and cooked the egg separately then added it in.

I think this recipe could have been good but mine turned out mushy even though the rice was slightly undercooked. I think I will do what one review said and use cold rice next time and the egg was weird Might try to cook separately with soy and see how that works

This was great - I used it to jazz up a brown/wild rice medley - I used chicken pan drippings in place of the oil, regular onion and dried parsley.  Had a nice mild flavor.  Family enjoyed it very much.

I liked this recipe, but I made adjustments..the biggest was using peanut oil, which makes it over the top!  Oh and I eliminated the parsley...didn't really think that belonged.   Good recipe though.

I love this recipe!  The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly and was very happy.  The second time I made it I used leftover Basmati rice (my fav), took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a good splash of sesame oil.  Also added a tad more soy sauce, 1 minced clove garlic and 1/4 tsp. fresh grated ginger.  It turned out perfect!  Can't wait to make this again and maybe adding some leftover pork, or tiny shrimp.  Thank you Linda Rae for a new favorite.

This was amazing. I didn't use cold rice, though. I didn't add the parsley and I cooked the egg separately, like some other reviewers. It was awesome, and so easy. Thanks for this great recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I also added a quarter of a red pepper since I had it and the presentation was beautiful.  I felt that I was eating the best refried rice.  I also scrambled the egg seperately.

Delicious and easy. There are so many variations you could make to this recipe to suit your tastes or what you have available. I think nect time I will increase the amount of vegetables. I added tofu to mine so it could be a one dish dinner for me. Thanks!

This is a good basic recipe although I think it could use more soy sauce, or something to jazz it up.  I use it to clean out the fridge - added red and green pepper, broccoli, chicken - it was colorful, yummy and easy.

Excellent flavor.  I omitted the parsley, simply because i was out.  I also added more soy sauce after doing a taste test at the end as i enjoy a strong flavor.  I love the fact that you can prep most everything in advance and then simply toss it all together when you're ready.  Thanks for your recipe.

Yum!  I knew this was a winner when my husband sat down to dinner, tasted this dish and was silent until every bit of rice was gone.  Such a wonderful change of pace instead of the old ho-hum rice w/ gravy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Tasty, I used brown rice and added 1c. of mixed veggies(carrots,peas,corn,green beans). I also made the scrambled egg in a seperate pan so that there were nice big fluffy pieces of egg in the rice. Family enjoyed. Served with Sweet,Sticky and Spicy Chicken.

An easy side dish, and tastes good. Maybe needs a bit more...something. But would make it again because it was fast and easy. Also, a great way to use up extra rice.

This recipe was a close approximation of what you'd find in a Chinese restaurant.  I diced ham and added that with the vegetables, giving the dish a smoky, meaty addition.  Next time, I will cook the egg in a separate pan and add it to the rice when finished; otherwise, the egg is overwhelmed by the other ingredients.

This was a good start.  I used rehydrated onions as I didn't have any scallions.  I felt it needed more peas and more carrots.  I used 1/2 teriyaki and 1/2 soy as another reviewer recommended which helped give it more flavor.  I also used sesame oil to add to the flavoring.  It still was quite mild but tasty.

This was good but one thing that i did different was cooked the eggs seperatly . was not to sure how it would come out with putting a uncooked egg into the mix i thought it would come out to be one big icky mess..so i added the cooked eggs last and it came out really nice. I served it with egg rolls..my family was very pleased with this! Will make again.

This was really good.  I forgot to add the parsley, but I couldn't tell.  I will definately make this one again.

Very easy and yummy. I added just a little less oil and it was perfect.
