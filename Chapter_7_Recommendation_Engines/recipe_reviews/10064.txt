I actually discovered this recipe on another forum & have been making these cookies for years with some very minor alterations. MOST IMPORTANTLY: ADD A TBSP. OF WATER OR MILK, as the dough is a bit too dry. I also always add an extra couple tsps., maybe even tbsp. of PB. Works every time. The dough should not looked cracked when you roll it, it should look like playdo. In addition, I cut both types of sugar down to 1/3 c. & they always come out fine. The middles are very sweet, so there's no need for that much sugar in the chocolate dough. With time, you become experienced at assembling these & eventually you'll be so good at it that you won't have any leftover PB balls, because you'll be able to handle more PB in the center, which makes them so much better!!!

Ok, so I have made these about 5 times now. The first few times, I found the chocolate dough to be a little dry and not very flavorful.  Here is a summary of what I figured out to make the chocolate part moist, fudge, and just awesome:  1) Use brand name cocoa like hershey's, it will taste better; 2) Add 2 Tbsp sour cream to liquid mixture; 3) Add 1 extra egg (total of 2); 4) add 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to chocolate dough.
YUM!

Oh my!  I almost gave up when the chocolate dough wouldn't wrap around the peanut butter middles very easily. But I didn't give up & found that if I really flatten the dough and then wrap it, it works better.  I think next time I make these I will chill the peanut butter middles before wrapping the dough around them.  (Oh yeah, I too was left with more middles than dough, lol!!)  They do look scrumptious, time for a taste!!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  I have to say that this is one of the easier Christmas cookies I have ever made.  I made the filling first and stuck it in the fridge while mixing up the cookie batter.  Based on suggestions and opinions here, I added 2 T. sour cream to the batter and to make it more chocolatey, I added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Once that was done, I then rolled the filling into balls and put them back in the fridge.  I floured my hands and made small patties in the palm of my hand with a dent in the middle for the filling, put the filling in, and then rolled them like when you make meatballs.  No filling seeped out, 30 cookies, and incredibly delicious.  I am just trying to figure out how to hide them from the kids and me before handing out to friends and family.

I baked them for my boyfriend (firefighter in training) to bring to his firefighter buddies. They were hit! I'd even give them five stars except they were a pain to make. I even tried to flatten the chocolate dough and plop a peanut butter mixture on top, then wrap around. Still pretty hard to cover the peanut butter. My chocolate dough didn't turn out too crumbly, but I followed the directions EXACTLY and I realize that by mixing the wet ingredients into the dry VERY thoroughly with my kitchenaid, they went from dry to moist - maybe this is the problem others are running into, they are undermixing. Anyhow, They cracked when I flattened so for that reason alone I may add a little extra water or maybe a couple of tblspoons of sour cream to avoid that. The end result was worth the effort! Don't skip the sugar on top...and these go great with milk.

The end result of this recipe is truly delicious. However, it is really time consuming and the number of cookies you get for that time is low. I rolled both dough and filling (both chilled) into logs and cut into 30 pieces, but assembling still took an hour. It was hard for me to get the dough around the filling without it splitting and letting a bit leak out. Mine all cracked on baking so you can see a web of the filling through the chocolate cookie. I read the reviews and the suggestion to freeze the centers sounds like it could make things a bit easier. They are very tasty but I won't make them frequently. I overbaked mine, going by appearance I didn't think they were done after the specified baking time so I added a few minutes, but now that they are cooled, they are hard and a bit dry, so next time I'll follow the timing in the recipe.

I made these twice now and they are very good, but they are time consuming to make. Assembly is the slightly tricky part. To form the cookie I took a small amount of dough and flattened it in my palm. If its too sticky, add more flour. If the flattened disc is bigger than your palm the finished cookie will be too big. Drop the chilled filling in the middle and fold over and crimp. Place the crimped side down and don't forget to flatten the cookie on the baking sheet just a bit.

without some modifications this recipe is only about a 3, but I knew it had potential!! DEFINITELY MAKE THESE they are soooo yummy IF you make the following minor changes: 1) add 2 more TBSP of cocoa powder  2) substitute 1/4 c of melted semi sweet chocolate for the 1/4 c of peanut butter that goes into the cookie dough  3) lessen the flour slightly (I used 1 1/4 cup + 2 TBSP)  4) add a pinch of salt to the dough, and 1/8 tsp of salt to the peanut butter middle (REALLY enhances the flavor of both the choc & pb...brings the recipe from a 5 in flavor to a 10!!)  5) Lastly, make the peanut butter middle batter FIRST, portion out into balls using a round bottom tsp, place on a plate and (as suggested by several other bakers) FREEZE while you make the choco cookie dough - by the time you're done w/the dough your pb balls with be firm enough to stuff into the middle of it.  THEN, dip a round bottom TBSP into flour, msr out a ball of choco dough, then, as other reviewers helpfully suggested, flatten the ball in your hand, put the pb ball into the middle, and simply fold the edges up and roll like you would a meatball.  EZ!! ...IF you do it this way...if not you're going to be frustrated beyond belief!  Thanks for posting Stephanie - i'll be making this one for years to come :)

This is one of those cookies that you can't just have one.  I love the surprised look on everyoneâ€™s face when they thought it was just a chocolate cookie when they tasted the peanut butter inside.  I call them Peanut butter surprise.  I chilled the peanut butter mixture and the cookie dough before rolling them into balls.  I had no trouble at all.  Can't wait for an excuse to make them again!!!

I love these and they are not a lot of extra work to make. To prevent the cookies from being dry the next day they should be stored in something airtight. I used a ziplock bag and my cookies were still great the next day.

Wow! These are great....took some time to make but worth it.  I did end up with 4 extra peanut butter balls....so I guess I used a little too much cookie dough to wrap these. Otherwise the recipe was easy to follow and accurate. What a treat to have a chocolate cookie with a peanut butter surprise inside! Tasted like a Resees' peanut butter cup inside....will be making these for the holidays...thanks for a new cookie recipe!

Turned out a little tough for me, but probably because I experimented and used a microwave. I guess cookies simply won't bake correctly in it. 4 stars for the taste. A little too sweet though maybe.

Very YUMMY!!!! A BIG BIG help... Start with the peanut butter/confectioner's sugar mixture.  I measured out about 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp. for each ball, cut each ball in half, you'll get 30.  Roll balls of peanut butter dough, put into the freezer, this keeps the peanut butter balls from oozing out of the chocolate when you roll them together.  Next the chocolate dough, Adding 2 Tablespoons of sour cream or even better 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise.  Adding that to the chocolate dough is a MUST! I prefer using mayonnaise because it adds more moisture to the chocolate dough and makes it easier to work with without having to put in the freezer.  It works best when you measure out tablespoons of dough on a plate, you will have just about 30 tablespoons.  Take the peanut butter out in batches for each cookie sheet, let the rest keep chillin'.  Flatten a chocolate mound into a patty between your hands and put frozen peanut butter into the chocolate and roll between your hands into a ball.  Worked perfectly, no leftover dough, no seeping peanut butter.  Very simple doing it this way. Bake 15 at a time, 2 batches they are done. These are requested every year in the cookie tins. I tried adding peanut butter and chocolate chips to the chocolate dough this year, they were a bit harder to assemble but I can't wait til they cool to taste one!

I have been using this recipe for years, got it from a cooking mag.  I have a friend who asks me to make them every year for her birthday.  It does take some practice to get the dough to filling just right but after you make them a few times, they come together perfectly and quickly.  I roll the balls in sugar then smoosh them a bit with a flat bottomed glass.

Just made these, and they are very tasty . . . especially if you like chocolate and peanut butter together!  I read a few reviews, and made a few adjustments based on that.  I added about 2 Tblsp. of sour cream to the chocolate mixture, so it wouldn't crumble so much.  Good call.  I used my small cookie scoop and scooped all of the chocolate part onto a piece of waxed paper (so I could see how many I was going to get).  I got 26.  I did cut back on the filling ingredients to 2/3 cup of each (peanut butter & powdered sugar), as many others said they had filling left over.  Good call.  Then I used a teaspoon, and divided the filling into 26 equal size balls.  Perfect - no leftovers!  Then my daughter and I assembled them, patting the chocolate ball into the palm of our floured hands, flattening to a circle.  Place the filling in the middle, and pinch the edges up and around the filling, placed them pinch side down on cookie sheets lined with a silicone mat.  Baked for exactly 9 minutes.  Yum!

Made these cookies with Hershey's Special Dark Cacao Powder because that's what I had on hand. After reading reviews, I added 2 tbs sour cream. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written and ended up with 30 cookies. Had no trouble rolling the filling or the cookie dough. Flattened the dough, placed filling in center, covered filling with dough and rerolled the cookies. A bit time consuming but convenient since I had all the ingredients in my pantry. Delicious!

I made these about a year ago. However, they were a HIT! Oh my god. They were amazing! My boyfriend's friend's dog, being almost 13 now, jumped at the sight of these and knocked the plate off of they table and tore into the bag. They were that appetizing... Haha. I have yet to make these again. My mom is just waiting! I don't know how many times I get asked "When are you going to make those peanut butter middle cookies again?" They took forever for me to put together, but once baked...AMAZING! :)

Made exactly as indicated, right down to type of flour, and real butter.  This was a fun project for the kidlet and I.  Unfortunately, I had to make a whole second batch of peanut butter filling to finish, so we must have made our centers too big.  (We love PB, so that's definitely not a problem!)  I used natural PB (nothing but ground nuts), so there was a bit less sugar than most people's recipes, I expect.  We found the sweetness level high, but not too high.  Ours didn't crack, but tasted good.  The chocolate flavor was present but not strong.  These cookies seemed to be all about the PB anyway.  We'll definitely make these again, but probably only as a rainy day project or for the holidays.  They were easy but time (and dish) consuming.

These cookies were delicious. I don't understand how someone can rate these cookies for there difficulty. The directions doesn't say that it's easy to make. If you are a fanatic about chocolate and peanut butter together....look no further!!

Delicious!  I rolled both the filling and the batter into separate balls then refrigerated them for about 45 min.  Flattened the chocolate batter balls before inserting the peanut butter filling balls and rolling.  Baked them exactly 10 min.  Thanks for this variation of the always-great (in my opinion) chocolate-peanut butter combination.  These will become a part of my repertoire.

These were way more trouble than they were worth. I felt they were dry and the flavor lacked something (and I am a peanut butter fanatic). I ended up throwing most of them away because no one in my house would touch them.

Yum, yum. These weren't as hard as people made them sound! What I did:  *Followed other reviewers' advice and added 2TBsp. sour cream to the chocolate cookie part, and had no trouble with cracking or crumbling. *Made the PB mixture first, rolled into balls, and froze them while I worked on the chocolate dough. *Used 1/2TBsp. for the PB part, and a whole one for the chocolate part. *Made a chocolate-dough patty in my palm, placed the PB ball in the middle, wrapped, then rolled between floured hands. I only came up with 25 cookies, which took 10 minutes to bake, but I had even Pb and chocolate.

Phew! That's it for the technical part, which did take some time, but wasn't too bad. As for the taste, they're pretty dang good! You'd never know by looking at them that they're anything special, but one bite and you're transported to a whole new kind of happy place! A must-try for peanut butter lovers. =]

I thought these tasted wonderful. I made it exactally the way the recipe is written. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the chocolate dough is hard to work with as it is crumbly. I found it works better to roll the dough flat and then wrap around the middle. I ended up with peanut butter middle left over. Just an FYI for those of you who decide to try this recipe, THE COOKIES ARE HUGH!!!!  I ended up with 1 1/2 dozen. I will make these again, but will use 2 eggs. and maybe a little more peanut butter in the chocolate dough.

The taste of these cookies was really good. They weren't too dry or too moist. Was not overly sweet or tasteless. The chocolate and peanut butter complimented each other well. The prep process was a little time consuming but I think I will make these again. Another reviewer said another option to create a similar cookie with less time is to make peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. While I agree that these cookies may take less time and utilize similar ingredients thus making a very similar taste, you won't get the same texture chocolate chips will make for a sweeter cookie than the magic middles. A problem I encountered was the filling coming out when I flattened the cookies. It could be because I flattened them a little too much. A tip to making sure not to get any filling leftover is to separate the filling and dough into 30 equal pieces before you start wrapping.

These cookies were actually pretty amazing. I had a different recipe for these that I loved, but hated making, so I tried this instead. They were so easy! I took the suggestion of adding a tablespoon of milk to the cookie and it made the texture absolutely perfect for forming them. They were a little bland at first, but the more I eat them the better they get. I'll definately be making them again!

these are great, and they definitely do better with age - 3 or 4 days after baking them is when i think they taste the best, althoiugh i have not idea why.  i will say, i would prefer that the outer chocolate cookie be chocolatey-er...i would omit the PB next time and up the cocoa.  but otherwise, they are very good and made a great addition to our holiday cookie tray.  thanks!

the dough was too crubly as is, so I added 3 more tbs butter and 2 tbs of milk, and that made these soooo very soft and chewy.  I also added just over 1/4 cup flour and 2 tbs butter to the filling, and made pinwheels (the filling just turns to mush in pinwheels without the extra flour and butter).

I have made these cookies several times in the last few weeks. It seems that my co-workers and friends can't get enough of them!  I add two tablespoons of sour-cream, as well as an extra egg. I find that refrigerating the dough between cookie sheets makes it more workable. This cookies are WONDERFUL!

Made these for Christmas, the only "glass" I could find to flatten was a cut glass with a pattern on the bottom, when I used this it made a star imprint on the cookie, mixed with the sugar it was rolled in it made them look like chocolate snow flake cookies...very impressive if I do say so myself.

For all the work, I'm not sure I'm game to make them again.  They were too good!  It hardly seems worth it when we eat them all in less time it takes to put them together.  These are fantastic gift cookies.

I made several cookies from this web site this year for gifts, and this cookie was my husband's favorite.  My boss requested the recipe.  These are excellent.  I preferred to make them as balls and not flatten then at all, although I did dip the top half in sugar for a sparkly effect (optional).  I liked the big taste of peanut butter that way and they looked good, too.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Stephanie!  These take a little more time, but are the best.

I saw this recipe and had to make it right away! It's easy if not a little time-consuming, but I had fun with it! I'm a fourteen-year-old inexperienced in baking, but I found this really easy to follow. Despite the suggestions of adding sour cream or chilling the filling in the other reviews, I neglected to do so and tried out the way the recipe called, and it turned out perfect. The only thing I changed was instead of flattening with a glass dipped in white sugar, I put sugar on a plate and dipped the top of my cookies in the sugar, then flattened with a fork. They came out absolutely delicious and my father loves them. I'll definitely be doing this recipe again; the time it took to prepare was worth it. A huge hit if you're a peanut butter lover!

These cookies are really good, but I did add a tbsp of milk to the chocolate mixture to help with moisture. Also, I would recommend that they are not flattened too much as that will dry them out. I also only baked mine for 6 minutes.

Excellent cookie!  As others suggested, I made the filling first and then chilled it while I made the cookies.  I added 1 Tbsp of milk to the filling to hold it together a bit.  The cookie dough is very soft and so it's nice to have the filling set a little.  I did run out of filling before I ran out of cookie dough, but that will improve as I make these more and have a better feel for how large to make the middles.  These are very rich and delicious!

I really enjoyed not only making these cookies (baking is my yoga!) but also eating them!  Not true for my kids, ages 4 and 9, they did not love them, they are more the peanut butter cookies with kisses on top, but I still gave these 4 stars.  I did add 2 Tbsp. of milk to my batter to make it easier to work with and I rolled my filling balls first and froze them while I made the batter.  I lucked out and had the right amount of both and did what others suggested--I flattened out the chocolate into a pancake and them wrapped it around the balls and crimped the extra and placed them crimped side down.  Perfect! No breaking open!  I did sprinkle them with coarse sugar and served them warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream on top, yummy!  So all of you Moms out there, you have been warned:  this is not what I consider a "kid friendly" recipe, it leaves extra for you to enjoy!

Quite nearly as easy to bake as they were to make disappear! I doubled the ingredients to make the original 30 yield, and was glad I did. These cookies didn't last an hour in this world.

Oo, yum...!  I did add a little milk per a suggestion by another reviewer, and otherwise didn't change much.  Maybe a little less sugar in the batter and a little more filling - did try mini chocolate chips in the batter too but it made it a little harder to wrap around the peanut butter mixture.  Really amazing!

These were pretty good. Made for "Peanut Butter lovers' Day" just because. In about 2 hrs start to finish, made while my kids napped. My peanut butter mixture was crumbly, so I added about 1 tsp water, which quickly changed it from dry to wet. After I started rolling PB balls, it firmed up (no refrigeration required). The chocolate dough was good consistency w/ no changes. followed advice to flatten and wrap around PB balls. I had no GLASS cup, so just rolled cookie in sugar and pressed with two fingers. Baked 7, cooled 2min, and all are round, couple cracked edges, but the PB is still hidden for a surprise.

I'm writing to rate the filling only, which is stellar.  I used it between two layers of brownie batter, trying to get a "Reese's Peanut Butter Cup" type of effect with brownies.  It turned out SOOOO good! Not sure if I'll actually try this with the cookie recipe because just spreading it out over the brownie layer and adding another on top was a lot of work but the result was fantastic so why mess with a good thing?!?

Yes these take a bit of time to make, but they're easy to make.  I made 30 even-sized peanut butter balls first, lining them around a plate (not on top of each other).  Then I used a *level* tablespoon to measure out the chocolate batter.  It was spot on for exactly 30 cookies.  As for the taste, they were decent!  My only negative comment about these is that the chocolate dough was a bit dry, so I had to add in some milk.  Perhaps this is due to the size of the egg I used?  Also, the chocolate cookie part on it's own is ok, not noteworthy.  I used Aldi brand cocoa powder because it's a fraction of the price of name brand, so not sure if that makes a difference.  Would definitely recommend mini chocolate chips in the batter to liven it up.  And I baked mine for 8 minutes and should have removed at 7 minutes for more chewiness.

Tasty! They were a hit with the family and didn't last long! I would definately add 1 T. milk when beating the sugar, butter, peanut butter mixture or they will be too dry. With the middles- I roll them into balls and place them on a small cookie sheet and stick in the freezer. While I am waiting for them to harden a bit- I separate the chocolate mixture into 30 separate balls as well. By the time I am done doing this- the peanut butter middles are ready to come out of the freezer. Just make a bowl like shape with your thumb and stick the middle in- easy to shape around it. Doing it this way goes way faster, you can get it done before the middles get soft again, and you won't have the left over middles like many people posted. I then roll the completed balls in sugar and place on cookie sheets and SLIGHTLY flatten with a glass bottom. The work put into them isn't that bad- but I would double the batch so you get more for your time put into them. They are delicious!

My husband, a peanut butter fanatic, loved them, I thought they were good but a little too peanut buttery. Next time I will add a little more sugar to the middles.  They are time consuming to make but fairly simple.

Great cookies, very yummy and easy to make. It takes a while to form the cookies before they go in the oven, so make sure you have at least an hour to make them, not including oven time!

They were pretty good.  I thought they were too dry but everyone I shared them with loved them.  I guess they are the perfect cookie to enjoy with a glass of milk!  Not sure if I'll make them again.  They just weren't quite worth the time spent.

These were indeed delicious but time-consuming. I recommend chilling both filling and dough in freezer for at least 30 min. It's a good treat during the holidays but I probably won't make them on a regular basis.

I didn't think these were too time consuming; I'm 10 days away from delivering a little girl via c-section and I whipped these up while a cake was baking in the oven. For fun, I used a glass that had a star shape on the bottom, cookies were really cute!! Thanks for sharing!!

Not the sweetest cookie out there, but very good. If you want a sweeter cookie add more of the peanut butter filling. The chocolate dough is a bit hard to work with so attack it with gusto. All in all a very flavorful cookie.

I followed the directions almost exactly and didnt have any trouble with assembly at all. Heres what I did..I lightly rolled the cookie dough into a ball and pressed it into the the palm of my hand...not totally flat but more like a well.Put the peanut butter filling in the center and wrap edges around it. It worked out fine. I did refridgerate the center for about 15 min and left cookie dough on counter at room temp before assembly. I read that someone else cuts down the sugar for the center but in my opinion it has to be sweet because the cookie part is not. In fact it kinda lacks flavor a little. I also found them to be a bit dry. With that said, these are really good but definitely not the best thing i ever ate.  OH..P.S; I did ad 3 tsps of milk to cookie batter so it would be easier to work with

Not worth the effort as is.  The finished chocolate portion is way too dry, which made it very difficult to wrap around the peanut butter mixture.  Other reviewers suggest some solutions for this, but I am not going to put the effort in again.  I also thought the taste was a little bland.

oh my god are these amazing! If you're having trouble with assembly, just throw the dough in the fridge for 15-30 minutes and it won't stick to your hands.

These were just GREAT!  My 7 year old son and I made these last week.  They were a HUGE hit.  I shaped the centers into balls, flattened them just a bit and threw them in the freezer for about 10 minutes.  Then I took 1 T of chocolate dough and divided it in half.  I rolled each half into a ball, flattened them, sandwiched the 2 chocolate dough discs with the peanut butter in the center and sealed the edges. I hope this makes sense because by the time I had made about 5 cookies, I already could do them quickly.  Like I said, even my son could do them!    They were soooo yummy! Way easier then you think it is going to be.

They were good- if you like peanut butter you'll love these.  However they turned out a bit dry and the chocolate part didn't have much chocolate flavor.  I was a little disappointed but they sure did look impressive.

These came out great!  I rolled the peanut butter into 30 balls.  I had some chocolate dough left over, so I would recommend using slightly more than 1 Tbsp. for each cookie.  I found the easiest way to shape the dough around the peanut butter was to flatten it out, then wrap it around the peanut butter.  It is a bit tedious, but worth it if you love the chocoate-PB combo!

I've made these several times now. Very time consuming... But my boyfriend rolls them out faster than I do since my hands area always so hot. So I "let" him do it now (heh) - Awesome cookies!

I added the 2 Tbsp sour cream to the dough as suggested by others and refrigerated the dough first. Didn't have any problems putting together or cooking. These have an awesome taste but are a pain to make. Way too labor intensive for me. Thanks for a good idea though!

Everyone I have made this for asks me for the recipe! Use the ingredient modifications provided in other reviews and freeze both the chocolate and peanut butter mixer before handling. Enjoy with a glass of milk, this recipe is definitely worth it!

SO good.  I did not get 30 cookies out of one batch, however, I might have made the fillings too big.  It's just as well, that means there aren't as many for me to eat.  A more labor intensive cookie than, say, chocolate chip (when using a cookie scoop), but really worth it for a special treat.  Thanks!

Just lovely! I made these as a gift for my boss and a coworker and they ate them right up. My boss was intrigued by the filling ("how did you get that in there???") hehe. I did add the tablespoon of milk because the dough was so dry, but it didn't seem to help... it was still quite difficult to work with. Next time I might add an extra egg. Refrigerating the peanut butter middles makes those much easier to handle, though. I'm not a big peanut butter cookie person, but these are delicious!

They're okay. Just not what I was expecting.

The dough was very cake-y and gave the cookies an almost brownie-like taste. Also, I think the recipe really needs some salt, both in the cookie and the filling...

These were a bit time consuming but well worth it.  I did make the filling first and rolled it into about 27 balls and then flattened the balls a little.  Then I put it in the freezer while I made the batter.  I flattened  the batter in my hand like a mini pie crust and then wrapped it around a ball.  Then I continued to follow the recipe using the glass and sugar.  They came out perfect, just like a reese's peanut butter cup cookie!

Wow, these had to be the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had!  The only thing in the recipe that I ommited was the vanilla... didn't have any at the time, but will add in the next batch.  What I like most about these cookies is that they are not oily and crunchy like most peanut butter cookies are!  I was worried that the peanut butter in the middle would ooze out while it was baking, but every cookie that I made came out perfect!  I had a lot of the chocolate coating left, but making the filling was a snap so it wasn't hard to compensate for the left overs.  Some reviews thought the chocolate coating was hard to work with, but I found that it was really easy.  I rolled it into a ball, flattened it, then wrapped it around the filling.  You can smooth the edges out by rolling it some more in your hands and it evens out perfectly.  This is the only peanut butter cookie I will ever make again!

These cookies are very delicious, something different that you don't see very often.  I have not had one yet but everybody that has eaten them has enjoyed them.  The only downfall to this recipe is wrapping the little peanut butter balls, it does take a little time, my first ones were a bit sad looking.  These bake up very well and look great, I will continue to make these.  Thanks for sharing this unique recipe!

I followed some suggestions from other reviewers, which made assembly very easy. I cut down the white and brown sugar in the cookie dough to 1/3c each. I also added two TBSP sour cream into the wet ingredients so the dough wouldn't be too dry. I used natural peanut butter because I don't like the kinds with the added sugar and emulsifiers. I transferred the cookie dough into a container and put it in the fridge while I made the peanut butter centers. Cool dough is easier to handle and more elastic. I put the finished peanut butter centers in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. I formed 30 cookie dough balls so I wouldn't have any leftovers. To assemble, I put a ball into my palm and flatted it with my other palm. I put the peanut butter center inside the flattened circle, then wrapped the edges of the dough circle around the peanut butter ball. I then rolled the ball inside my hands to smooth it out. I posted pictures. Assembly was easy and not too time-consuming. The cookies don't spread when you bake them so you can jam a bunch onto one cookie sheet. However much you flatten them before you put them in the oven is how flat they'll be when you pull them out, so be sure you like how they look before you put them in the oven.

These cookies are great! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a little milk to the dough to make it a little less dry.  One thing I've found is you really have to follow the directions for cooking time. You will be tempted to over cook them (I did) because when you take them out of the oven they will be a little loose. But don't cook them longer! I ended up with stiff, dry cookies because I thought they weren't done and cooked them more.  Once I figured it out, the cookies were wonderful! Extra fabulous if you use the Special Dark cocoa, but maybe that's just me :)

These are absolutely amazing! They're a little tedious and take about an hour from the time you pull out your ingredients, to the time you're pulling them out of the oven. The preparation though is organized and leads to a great end result. I did as many suggested by making the interior first and letting those peanut butter balls freeze while the exterior was being made.

These are really really good. We all loved them. I followed the recipe as written. They're a bit of work, but worth it in the end.

Excellent... chewy, great flavor! Followed the recipe exactly other than I chilled the dough for manageability. Will add to my favorites list!

Loved it... After reading the first review I also added 1 Tbsp. of milk to wet mixture, also seemed to be easier to work with when the dough is chilled.

These get a 4 for taste (would prefer a softer cookie) but a zero for ease of assembly!  Many of my cookies had the top pull off with the glass  (yes, I used sugar), exposing the peanut butter middle.  My third tray I rolled the cookies in sugar and then used a glass...much better  The chocolate part is messy, the peanut butter part crumbly but eventually comes together when worked by hand.  Overall, not worth the effort.  I won't make these again, but will use a similar recipe with peanut butter on top.

Really delicious! Most of the reviews I read said they had left over middles, well I had left over chocolate dough. I had a tough time getting the chocolate around the peanut butter and most of mine cracked. But it didn't matter, they still tasted excellent. I will make again, just need to perfect my technique.

I did add a splash of milk to the mix which made it easier to combine everything, and I used 1/3 cup of each sugar. I also had plenty of p.b. Balls left over even though I ate a few and gave a few to my son. Fun surprise inside and they perfectly filled my cookie jar!

These were pretty good. A little dry, though--perhaps more butter. Also, I think they needed more peanut butter in the middles.

These are wonderful cookies - especially for those of us that love peanut butter and chocolate!  The recipe may sound a little labor intensive but it is not.  As suggested by other reviewers, it is best to chill the peanut butter balls.  I flatten the chocolate batter in the palm of my hand and put a "dimple" in the middle, place the chilled peanut butter ball there and then fold the chocolate batter up and around it.  Mine end up being about golf ball size.  I flatten slightly with the decorative bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.  That makes a pretty, gift type cookie.  Do not over bake or they will be dry!

These turned out awesome. I baked these for my BF and his daughter to take on their trip. I got a text...These cookies are freaking amazing. I used a couple of the tips. Definitely add the sour cream, I added a splash of milk too. Chill the peanut butter filling. I probably will chill longer next time. Flatten in hand, then fold around and seal, placing seal side down. Next to figure out how to do these like a peppermint pattie!

Excellent cookie. My alteration is to the rolling of the balls.  Instead...I roll into a log. Slice the roll, layer dark--peanut butter--dark and flatten.  Much quicker !!! Top with a little coarse sugar. Yummy!!!!

Recipe was very easy to make. I did take the suggestions to add an additional egg, 2 T of mayo and 1/3 cup of semisweet chips to the dough. I used Penzey's Spices cocoa powder.  I made the filling first and used my cookie scooper to make about 17 heaping peanut butter balls and then put in freezer.  I cut the balls in half after they firmed.  Since I used up my peanut butter I used a Dark Chocolate peanut butter for the dough. I took my cookie scooper for the dough as well and slightly indented the ball in my palm and put filling inside and folded dough around.  It was very easy and I had enough dough to make 40  cookies without any peanut butter leaking from cookie.  I did have to use 8 Hershey kisses for 8 of the extra cookies because I ran out of filling. Very yummy!!!

I followed another reviewers directions and made the following changes:  I added 1/8 tsp salt to the peanut butter/powdered sugar part and rolled into 30 balls and froze on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.  Then for the cookie part, I used 2 eggs, added a dash of salt to the dry portion, and after mixing wet ingredients & dry ingredients together, I added 1/2 c. mini semi sweet chocolate chips.

Pretty straight forward and simple, just takes a little time. My advice is to completely melt the butter in the chocolate outer coating.  Makes it wetter and easier to coat the peanut butter. I kept a bowl of the peanut butter batter, a bowl of the chocolate coating, a bowl of flour and a bowl of sugar next to my cookie sheet. Every time I would rub flour on my hands and then the peanut butter doesn't stick to you at all. Grab a bunch of the chocolate batter and flatten it into a little bowl with your fingers then stick the peanut ball in it.  All you have to do is pinch it closed and then flatten it with a glass dipped in sugar. Made it way easier to do. All in all took me a little over an hour to do from start to finish. I baked for 7 minutes. Ended up with 29 cookies from the recipe. I didn't pre roll my peanut butter balls, just did them as I went. Eyeballed the size. Worked great! Recommend a glass of milk while eating them! They are rich!

I have made these cookies long before i saw this recipe on this website. They are the best but are messy to make. you need to keep the  both of the doughs cold. they work the best when cold. Using this much dough for each cookie will make them about 3 inches once baked. they are also meant to be decorate with icing which this recipe doesn't tell you. so if you want smaller cookies make the balls smaller

I am not a peanut butter fan. I'm sure there are many cooks out there who understand me when I say that I cook to show my loved ones I care, which is why I made these cookies! Everyone absolutely loves them. Key things to keep in mind:

1. Don't make the peanut butter filling or the outer lining into a ball. Instead, flatten it a bit more, along with flattening the outer cookie lining. This makes for an even ratio of chocolate and peanut butter when biting into the final product!
2.  Use 2 eggs instead of one.

I usually hate peanut butter cookies, but this recipe is very good, especially with some coffee or hot chocolate!

yummy yummy.... awesome cookie... however they are quite a bit of work to make... besure and flour your hands it makes life so so much easier... and with a little practice folding the chocolate around the peanut butter isn't too difficult either... i flatted it thin then took two patties put one on top and one on bottom pinched the edges together and pinched off the extra... some people commented the chocolate mixture was a little dry... they are probably right... a tablespoon or two of sour cream would probably make a difference but mine turned out fine without it... will make again when I am carving peanutbutter and chocolate but will make sure I give myself plenty of time to form the cookies

Made these tonight with my 3- and 7-year-old and we had a blast. No other recipe has kept their interest to the end...I am usually left baking alone. We called the peanut butter balls "babies" and wrapped them in chocolate "blankets," and they loved dipping the glass in sugar and flattening them. We did add the 2 Tbsp. sour cream and chocolate chips (regular since we didn't have mini) like the one reviewer suggested but skipped the extra egg since we used natural peanut butter (was afraid it was oilier than regular peanut butter). They looked like they would be dry when they were finished, but they were perfect. The chocolate chips definitely add an additional element of fun surprise.

Chocolate part needs a little salt for flavor and a little more chocolate flavor.

One of my favorite cookie recipes!  I add 2 T. sour cream to the cookie dough as other reviewers have suggested.  I also roll both the filling and dough into 30  balls ahead of time so there is always enough and never any leftover.  I flatten the dough balls and refrigerate the filling, so it is really easy to wrap the dough around the filling.  Actually it is even easier for me because my kids do that part ;o)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  We love it!

These are fantastic! My family and I made them this evening. I used 1/2 Cup peanut butter in the cookie rather than 1/4 Cup, and added approx. 1 TBS of milk to keep it from being too dry. Also, important not to over bake. Very yummy!!

Yum! These were soo tasty! I cut down the sugars to 1/3 C each, and added a few tsp peanut butter to the mix and a Tbs soy milk after I added the egg and vanilla. I used margarine instead of butter (to keep it non-dairy). I ended up with only enough cchocolate batter to amek one more cookie, so it was pretty perfect. Thanks Stephanie!

So, before starting the cookies I read the reviews and kids took in consideration all of the suggestions... 1) I used Hershey's cocoa for a great flavor; 2) I used 2 eggs (instead of the one called for) mixed into the liquid batter (before adding the dry ingredients) ; 3) after mixing the eggs in I added aprox 2 tbs of spur cream (so the choco part wouldn't be too dry); 4) last but not least, cover the peanut butter filling and chill for about 15 or so mins! (easier to cover) 
 Fairly easy to cover the peanut butter rolls with the chocolate and actually really easy to make!! My family loved them and wanted more  right away! YuMMY!! ;)

These are good and my husband who doesn't like chocolate actually commented on how good they were.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 Tbsp molasses instead of the 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and they were perfect!  I also made 24 peanut butter balls before I made the cookie dough after reading the reviews on how dry the dough was, but the dough was fine.  It is really humid so that probably made the difference.  I made 24 cookies and have 10 left.  I already know I need to make more!

My kids have loved these cookies since I found the recipe in the King Arthur Cookie companion cookbook (2004). Agree with others that an extra tblspoon of liquid improves the dough flexibility.

Great cookies!!! Fun and pretty easy to make but a little bit messy.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added 2T of sour cream to the wet mixture and the final product was great.  It was a little dry (kind of like cake cookies) but very tasty.  I would make these again and next time I will add chocolate chips to the mix as well.
I would definitely recommend freezing the peanut butter mixture and refrigerating the cookie mixture before putting them together.  It made it pretty easy to form=)  I hope you enjoy as much as I did.

These tasted very good! I made almost exactly as described except adding a tbsp of milk to the cookie batter. It did help to kind of pat the cookie mixture out and roll it up around the peanut butter ball. I didn't refrigerate or anything and didn't run into problems. These set up like a normal peanut butter cookie which slightly harden more while cooling so don't be too tempted to leave them in much longer than the 7-9 mins.

I didn't have brown sugar, so I substituted white. I compensated for the extra sweetness by reducing the sugar in the peanut butter filling (only 1/3c.). I added about 1/3 of a bag of chocolate chips to the chocolate because who doesn't like more chocolate? I made this on the stand mixer and had to add some milk so it didn't complain though the dough should come out on the dry side! I found these easy to make if you have someone help you make balls out of the chocolate mixture then flatten them into disks while you make peanut butter balls and cover them with the chocolate disks. YUMMY!

YUM! i refrigerated the dough overnight as convenience- i didn't have time to shape the cookies right after i made the dough. I also froze the PB middles. I got a lot of compliments on them. I think the chocolate was a bit 2 rich 4 my taste, maybe that's from refrigerating the dough. The dough was also very dry and i added water so it wouldn't crumble and fall apart. Also it was very hard to stuff the cookies with PB-and a lot of them ended up looking marbled and much better than this photo showed.I got 30 cookies unlike other reviewers probably b/c I first divided both doughs into 30 balls. took a long to make but a lot of people really enjoyed them! THANK YOU!I gave 4 stars b/c i thought chocolate was too strong!

This was a lackluster recipe. I am not sure why the word "magic" is in the title, as I did not have a life altering experience. In fact, I came away from consuming one of these "Peanut Butter Middles" wishing the cookie was less dry and more fudgy. Which leads me to my next statement: Peanut Butter Chocolate Brownies are much better for the palate. Avoid Magic Peanut Butter Middles if you are seeking a magical experience.   That is all.

I was scared to make them because they look a bit time consuming, however well worth it!!!! I will definitely make these again!! I followed the recipe with the only exception being is, I added a little more peanut butter to the cookie dough, it was so yummy, if you like pb cookies, this is the cookie for you!

Good recipe simple to make.  I got in over my head with cookie recipes so by the time I got to bake this recipe it was too late so I rolled the peanut balls and left them in the fridge overnight until I was ready the next day to make batter and use them. It was very easy to roll dough around them so I recommend have them cold I think it helped them keep there shape while rolling dough. I also made some with without rolling the dough around the PB instead I just rolled the dough stuck my thumb in it and put the PB in the middle and baked then because the PB was tacky after they cooled I melted some milk chocolate and frosted over top the PB and let harden. YUMMY! Family agreed those we're better than the original.

I follow this recipe exactly and my cookies turn out perfect every time.  When combining the wet ingredients with the dry, do so slowly and thoroughly.  I did it too quick the first time and they were too dry.  I usually make 32-34 cookies with this recipe with still some of the chocolate cookie part left over.  Also, only bake as long as the directions say or they will be hard and burnt.  These are delicious cookies- kinda like the cookie version of a peanut butter cup.

These cookies are great. I completely forgot to add the brown sugar and they still turned out pretty tasty. I think the filling is sweet enough to compensate for the not so sweet chocolate outside. Sure, they were a little tricky to roll but I managed without adding any milk. I ended up with a tiny bit of peanut butter filling left over. Will make these cookies again!

I added 1 TB sour cream to the chocolate batter as others suggested and the consistency was perfect.  I made the filling first and let the balls chill while I made the batter- this is a must.  The filling gets rather gooey after being at room temp for a while.  I used a small cookie scoop to make the PB balls.  I used the same scoop for the batter- rolled it into a ball and then flattened it to put the ball inside.  I used a little extra to fill in any holes in the batter.  I ran out of balls and had enough batter for probably 10 more cookies.  Bummer.  Next time I will use 1 cup PB and 1 cup conf sugar.  Great recipe!

Delicious and they also look really nice. I used whole wheat flour, but I think that I will use regular white flour next time for a smoother taste and texture.

Used an extra dark cocoa powder (just because I had it) and added the 1 Tablespoon sour cream to the chocolate dough (based on other reviews, I think 1 Tablespoon of milk would have worked too). Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the peanut butter. Made 32 balls of each of the doughs, then made one cookie at a time, flattening the chocolate dough in my palm then placing the peanut butter ball inside and covering it. Baked exactly as directed. We really liked them. My husband said "these are tasty and not too sweet". Will go in my regular cookie recipe book.

I really didn't think these were too difficult to make.  I flattened the chocolate dough really well then put the peanut butter ball in the middle, squished it slightly then wrapped it up w/ the chocolate like a present.  Delicious!!

These were a lot of work, but in my opinion, they were worth the effort. They were especially good with a large glss of milk.

These are relatively easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Moist and tasty, impossible to go wrong with PB and chocolate.  The centers are so good!

These were delicious-perfect for peanut butter lovers.  They are definitely more time consuming than regular drop cookies, but probably not much more so than cut-outs.  They were not super pretty though, more rustic-looking.  Great for special occasions-or for a midnight snack with a glass of milk.  Yum!

Fantastic!! I added 1/2 tsp salt to the chocolate dough and a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the filling. Instead of powdered sugar in the filling which contains cornstarch I used regular sugar in an equal substitution. I did not use flour to roll I just toughed it out with sticky hands. My cookies were NOT dry at all. I think the flour to roll is the problem that may be causing dry cookies. I watched them closely. 7 minutes seems to be plenty in the oven. You only need to set the outsides since there is no egg in the centers. These turned out perfect for me and my brother wants to pay me to make him more. Well worth the effort.

What a great cookie. I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't find it too hard and it didn't take too long either to make these. However next time I will try to add some sour cream as other reviewers suggested. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

FYI this technique can be used with any cookie dough. I originally learned this recipe from the JIF website where it calls for a tube of peanut butter cookie dough (with the same sugar/peanut butter middle)  I have since tried it with sugar cookies, chocolate chip, and the break and bake brownies.

Awesome cookie!!  I made the cookies and then read the reviews so i was concerned that i'd have problems but i have to say that it worked perfectly!  i followed the instructions and it went according to plan.  One reviewer noted that user her stand mixer for the dough made a difference and i have to agree.  i think ensuring the sugars and butter and pb are adequately creamed makes all the difference.

I'm usually guilty of tweaking a recipe here or there, even if I've never made it before. Amazingly I did not mess around with any of the recipe ingredients... the result was fantastic! Though putzy, I knew what I was getting myself into and just went with it. They baked really nicely! I had uneven amounts toward the end so I just took a round of chocolate and a round of PB and flattened them together... It even looked good, after I drizzled with chocolate. That's the only thing I'd suggest: Jazz them up a tad by using the Peanut Butter Glaze recip (adapt as necessary to desired consistency)... Just the extra step adds a wow factor (which you deserve if you spend the time making these)!!

These are the best cookies.  My sister and I could not get enough of them.  If you eat them warm they are ridiculously good.  The recipe is a little time consuming, but so worth it.  I didn't change anything. Stuck to the recipe.  Perfect as is!

I took the advice of another reviewer and added the tbs of sour cream and the tsp of brewed coffee and the chocolate dough was plenty moist. I even had to put it in the fridge for a bit to firm it up a little. I also baked them for 8 minutes. They came out soft and moist and absolutely amazing. Thank goodness I have a meeting to go to so that I can get them out of the house. Otherwise I feel as though I could eat them all. mmm...

These cookies are delicious. However....... this is not a user friendly recipe. The dough does not wrap around the cookie easily and they are time consuming. I am an experienced cook and can't help but think there is a better chocolate peanutbutter cookie recipe out there.

delicious! as other reviewers pointed out, they are a little time-intensive, but not enough to deter me from making them.  i followed the recipe almost exactly--only used 1 1/4 c flour for the chocolate cookie part, and increased the filling to 1 cup each of powdered sugar & peanut butter. YUMMM

I have made these three times since I found the recipe.  I added a cup of chocolate chips and 1 Tablespoon of sour cream to the chocolate dough.  This made the dough more chocolaty and easier to work with. They are my new favorite cookie!

really good, I would recommend something to moisten the choc. cookie, I made almost exactly but didnt end up adding all the flour and they are a bit dry, but they are more like a crunchy cookie on the outside and creamy in the middle.  They are great with milk and dont be afraid to have big middles, the tastiest cookies had the most filling.

I didn't notice the flatten with a glass instruction until the first batch was almost finished baking, so I flattened them about a minute before they were done.  That batch looked nicer than the batch that I flattened and then baked.

Really great cookie.  They took a while to make but worth it.  I added a couple tsp's of sour cream to the chocolate mix and they are very tender and tasty.  The only problem with them is they are so good they are almost gone already!!!

I have made this recipe a few times from a store cookie magazine.  The 2 major differences are as follows: 1.  The magazine recipe also calls for 1 Tbs. milk 2.  The magazine recipe yields 32 cookies.  This is only significant because it helps me to pre-portion both the dough and the filling by constantly dividing the lump into equal halves. (One lump gets cut into 2 equal smaller lumps.  Cut again into 4 equal smaller yet lumps, and so on.) Use the same dividing technique with both the dough and filling.   I then roll the 32 portions and leave them in the fridge until I can get back to them.  This way there's never extra chocolate dough or PB filling left over at the end.

Yes, they're more labor intensive than drop cookies but the only hard part was washing the PB from the measuring cup! Mine came out soft and chewy with this method: 2 Tbsp milk to dough; mixed crunchy and creamy PB for the filling and used creamy for the dough; refrigerated both the filling and the dough for several hours; covered cookie sheet with foil. They baked 10 minutes. Yielded 29. My BF says for all the work involved he'd just as well have a choco-PB drop cookie. I'd make them again though because they're delicious and beautiful!

These cookies are incredibly good! I added 1/2 tsp. of salt to the dough, but that was the only change I made. I didn't have enough filling to roll into 30 one-inch balls, so I divided the filling into 30 pieces and rolled each piece into a ball. They ended up being more like 1/2" to 3/4" in diameter. I did not have any problems shaping the dough around the filling...I found an easy way to do it is to simply flatten a piece of the chocolate dough, place the ball of filling inside, and bring the dough around the filling ball. Pinch the edges together, and than roll into a ball and proceed with the recipe. It worked really well, and my family loved the cookies! Thanks so much for sharing...these are a winner!!!

Good cookies, but a bit more work than most cookies. I added a bit of sour cream to the chocolate part so they'd stay soft.

These were so good and let me start by saying I will not rate or critique anyones recipe without first doing it as instructed (NO CHANGES) I wouldn't change a thing. I see lots of reviewers said they were dry and I find that a common complaint. They key to avoid dry cakes and cookies is to really cream the butter and sugar quite a bit. Make it super light and fluffy before adding the egg and vanilla and then spoon in the dry ingredients slowly. I guarantee it will make them moist ;) I had two trays full and cooked the first one for 9 mins since I had more on that tray and the second batch only needed 7. *Be careful not to over bake to avoid dry cookies as well.* This had more steps than simple cookie recipes but I found it quite simple and enjoyable to make even with my impatient 3 year old demanding cookies every 5 seconds. I will upload pictures soon! Im just sitting down to enjoy another cookie and type up this review. I made a few with chocolate disks in the center instead of sugar and pressing just because i was curious.. you could put anything on top and it would be great! Thanks so much for this recipe. Clean up was so easy with my peanut butter loving son around to lick everything clean. hahaha!

These were yummy! I may have overbaked them a little, but they were still good. (the chocolate part resembled a chocolate graham cracker- probably because I left them in the oven a little long) I added a little milk to moisten the dough (about a tbsp.) I didn't have any problems at all with handling the dough. The dough was very soft so it was pretty easy to mold it around the soft un-chilled peanut butter mixture. These were very sweet, but overall a great recipe!

By far the best cookie I ever tasted!! So easy to make, also. For now on when I make them, I'm doubling the recipe because one is not enough!

These were a total hit! The only thing is that they take a little work--and don't forget to add the brown sugar with the egg!

These were a bit labor intensive, but worth it.  I may cut the baking time just a smidge next time as the outsides got a little too crispy for my liking.

Waaaayyyy too much work for the outcome!! I am a very experienced cookie maker, in fact...very well known for my cookies.  These were not fun to make.  Chocolatey outside, but dry.  I ended up with a lot of the inside left, too. I would NEVER make these again..totally not worth all the work.  Tastes fine, but not five stars at all even if they were easy to make.

I followed the recipe exactly...just a hint to help with the filling.  I used a child's medication syringe...filled it full of the peanut butter mixture, rolled the chocolate into balls and then basically injected the peanut butter into the middle then pressed them with a fork on the cookie sheet.  They turned out perfect!!!

awesome cookie. I read the reviews but I don't know how anyone ended up with dry dough. With a stick of soft butter and 1/4 cup of creamy pb I had very soft even a little greasy dough. I do have a kitchen aide and when I was beating the sugar and butters until creamy I waited until it was very fluffy and creamy and I think that made a difference. Anyway I certainly didn't need any extra water or milk! Turned out very good. I did make the pb middles first and put them in the fridge while I made the chocolate dough and I'm glad I did, it stiffened them a little. I used chunky pb for the middles and creamy in the dough very good combo. Love this recipe and will make it often.

It was a 5 star until I tasted it. The outer cookie was very bland...not much chocolate or peanut butter taste. The filling of pretty good, tasted like reeses filling. I read the other reviews about having too much filling, so i reduced it by 1/2 cup each of peanut butter and sugar. I found the cookie pretty easy to assemble. *don't refridgerate the cookie dough for too long, it'll get crumbly and hard to roll** I also baked mine in a small oven, they took exactly 7 minutes. Overall, the presentation was good, the idea is great, the taste it lacking.

What is the hype?  I made these because of all the rave reviews.  They took a very long time to make and turned out dry and not so flavorful.  These were alright but I will definitely not make these again.

These are GREAT cookies. My kids actually liked these better than classic chocolate chip cookies. They are pretty easy to make as long as you follow the directions. It took me about 45 minutes from start to finish (baking included). I didn't have any leftover filling or coating. I made the filling balls just a little bigger than a grape. Made exactly 30!

LOVE 'EM!  This makes a great, chocolatey cookie with the delicious PB center I want.  A little tedious to make, but not awful.  I plan to reduce the balls of peanut butter to 12 inch and use less chocolate dough to cover in order to have smaller cookies.

EXCELLENT!

I made the magic peanut butter middles and brought them to work.  I won't say that I work with a really picky crowd (they'll eat anything) but I got lots of compliments.  Not only on taste but on presentation as well.  Someone even suggested I go into business. You can't go wrong with these cookies.  They are fabulous!!!

These are not the easiest cookies to make, but they are very good.  I wanted something different for a Xmas cookie exchange and received rave reviews on these.  My hubby and kids loved these cookies.  Worth the extra effort if you want something more special than the usual peanut butter cookie.

I made these for a birthday and the kids loved em.  These are nice because they are mostly peanut butter...not all chocolate...and that's a little healthier.  Thanks Stephanie.

I do not have kids but I would imagine that they would enjoy this cookie!  Few kids do not like peanut butter and chocolate!  Make sure that you set aside plenty of time to make these cookies.  Each of these cookies require individual attention, so if you are looking for a quick and easy recipe, these are probably not the cookies to make.  They are quite good, however, and people really enjoy the "surprise" in the middle.

They're AWESOME! I did have to keep adding milk into the batter until it was a little more moist and it did take a few tries to get the chocolate/peanut butter ratio correct but by the time I was on the second batch I had it down.  Won't be making these very often though - because I will literally eat them all!

These cookies were delicious. I had never made cookies like this before and had a little trouble with getting the cookie dough around the peanut butter balls the first few times without using too much. I found a good method of flattening out the dough in my hand and then wrapping it around carefully and smoothing it carefully did the trick. The cookies came out perfect and tasted delicious. Be warned, they are a bit filling.

Awesome.  Think of a reece's peanut butter cup with flour.  This recipe is a little high effort, but our 6 year old helped with the balls and flattening.  It isn't hard, just time consuming.  But with the reviews other people gave me and the fight that nearly broke out over the last two, very worth it.

It took me 2 hours to make these from start to finish (including toddler interruptions) and they came out dry and the bottoms hard after only 7 minutes baking time. Also even added milk like another user suggested for the dryness issue. Will not make again.

Overall, these cookies have good flavor.  The cookie dough wasn't easy to form around the peanut butter filling balls.  And I ended up having too much peanut butter filling considering how crumbly the chocolate-peanut butter dough was.

Wow what a disappointment.  I had so looked forward to making these but they are incredibly time consuming, the dough was very dry and crumbly and the recipe doesn't indicate that you should freeze the filling, thus a complete flop and waste of time.  I will be discarding the recipe and not making it again.

Great recipe!  Love the flavor and the peanut butter middle is so good-especially when still warm. Followed the recipe as is and I did not have any issues.  i did put the peanut butter balls in the freezer for a few minutes like some of the others did.  Definitely going to make these again.

Only got 15 cookies. Then we had extra chocolate dough, so we added white chocolate chips to it and made three more cookies. Yum! These are very good. We did not have to add flour to our hands to roll them.

These are delicious. I've made them three times now I believe. Once to help my guy friend ask a girl to prom. She said yes ;) My sister calls these "happiness cookies" because they make people happy.

Like many others, I had filling left over after making them... so once I tried making an inside out cookie (pb on the outside, chocolate on the inside). It worked and was actually very good, although it was extremely hot when it came out of the oven haha.

I did modify the recipe slightly.  First, I added 3/4 c mini chocolate chips, as a few of the reviews had suggested.  Second, instead of putting peanut butter in the chocolate cookie dough batter, I substituted a store-bought pudding cup (I used chocolate fudge).  Doing it that way made for pretty sticky batter, but keeping my hands floured, like the recipe says to do, made the assembly go pretty well.

My coworkers were trying to get me to realize the wonderfulness of peanut butter since I don't care for it.  I still don't, however, one of them emailed me with a picture of a similar cookie.  I found this recipe and everyone loved it.

I just made these for the 1st time & I am excited that all my PB balls matched  the amount of dough I had! They are a very tasty cookie but a tad dry for me. Next time I will add a bit of sour cream as others suggested. This will go in the cookie rotation for sure. Thanks Stephanie!

Because of reading other reviews, and the fact that I decided to start these late at night, I made the middles first, and refrigerated them overnight. When making the chocolate dough, I managed to forget to add the peanut butter. The dough was soft and sticky, so I had to add more flour, probably 3 more tablespoons, but it was still sticky. Once the peanut butter balls were covered, I put them all in the fridge for another 10 minutes while waiting for the oven to preheat. I used the sugar on the cup, which worked nicely. I kind of feel like if I'd added the peanut butter to the chocolate dough, it would have been overpowering. I really like them the way I made them. Chocolatey and not too sweet.

These cookies are absolutely delish! Tastes like I'm biting into a Reese's cup. By accident I put 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup of peanut butter in the cookie mix, but it still turned out great! Will def make these again!

These cookies are amazing!  I followed the extra advice of adding 2 Tbsp of sour cream, an extra egg and 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips, and I had no problem wrapping the peanut butter balls in the chocolate dough.  So yummy!!!!

I think my cookies were 3x bigger than instructed. But they were really yummy. I followed the suggestion to add an egg & decrease the sugar. Cookies were very dry & crumbly but 9 out of 10 testers enjoyed them.

I just finished making these and I have to say I had no issues at all with the dough being too dry or too wet. I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp. of salt). I made the centers and froze them overnight. I flattened out a Tbsp of dough in the palm of my hand and dropped the center in, folded the dough around it and rolled it into a ball. No cracking or problems at all. I didnt even have to flour my hands. Flattened and sprinkled with sugar. Wasn't as time consuming as I was expecting after reading some of the reviews. Baked 8 minutes. The cookies look perfect and taste AMAZING! Not too sweet and a peanut butter lovers dream! So glad I tried this recipe. Will make again many times.

This was great! It wasn't too sweet in my opinion, and people whom tried it RAVED about it! Everyone asked for it to be made again during Christmas. I did make a small adjustment though, I halved the portion of PB and added Nutella for the other half, it turned out just as amazing! Everyone had thought this was simply unique, yet simple! Thanks for the recipe!

These are worth running a few extra miles to work off!!!  Thanks for the great advise Lady Monte!  I did the same and added 2 T. sour cream to the cookie mixture and it worked great.  I didn't even have to mess with flouring my hands.  I also used 1 T. cookie to 1 tsp. peanut butter filling.  I just ate two; now out for a run so I can eat two more!!!!  Yielded 32 cookies.  Total time less than one hour.

With 1 T + 1t milk added, I give it 5 stars for flavor. Everyone loved them.  Kind of a long process to make.  I recommend making the peanut butter balls first, and let them chill while mixing, scooping, and flattening the dough.  Then wrap dough around peanut butter filling.  Yum.

These are pretty good. Not amazing but definitely good. They have to be baked a little bit longer than the recipe says so that they hold their own. They are delicious in the freezer.

8/15: I just changed my review to five stars because my husband never stops talking about these cookieS!

I thought these tasted pretty good and I liked that they weren't too sweet. I made 1/2 recipe and got 16 cookies. I thought they took quite a bit of time to put together especially considering I only made a 1/2 recipe. I used a cookie scoop to portion out the dough evenly and it worked well. I thought the filling had quite a bit of powdered sugar and wished I would have cut it back a bit. I like the concept of this cookie though and that it had a good amount of filling.

These are difficult to make at first but well worth the trouble. If you add a little more water to the chocolate dough part (1-2tsp) then they're more moldable around the PB part. If you make the middles first and freeze them, they're easier to wrap and then you know exactly how many outers to make, too. Very tasty, co-workers *beg* for more practically every day.

I tried this out last night and they worked out great. I had no problems putting them together, and they turned out wonderfully. My entire family loved them, and they were no harder to make than any other peanut butter cookie. the chocolate cookie was not overly sweet, so it suited the sugary peanut butter well, and the sugar on top just fits perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing. definitely be making them again!

This may be my new favorite cookie!  A little time consuming but turns out great.  Good flavor.  Dark chocolate is nice with the sweet peanut butter center.  Will make again....and again.

I made these a few days ago for my boyfriend, and they taste great, but are crazy dry! I made them to recipe and I was disappointed. Next time I make them, I'm going to underbake them a little and add a bit of milk to the chocolate dough. They do taste great, though.

I actually found these fairly simple to make.  I had no problems with the dough, and the chocolate part molded around the filling just fine. I didn't refrigerate or freeze anything.  My kids are just in love with these, so I am sure more batches will be requested.  Thanks for something fun and a little different!

I think I would reduce the baking time even further because mine came out too crunchy on the outside. I prefer chewy cookies, not jaw-breaker style...

I did as suggested and added a Tablespoon of sour cream to the cookie dough.  It was easy to work with the dough.  No flour needed. I rolled the dough into a log and sliced it evenly and got 32 slices.  I patted them flat (as did my 9 yr old son) and placed the pre-divided filling onto the dough and formed it around the filling.  It was slightly time consuming.  My son did a great job and wasn't frustrated.  The cookies came out great.  We took them to a potluck and everyone loved them.

Okay, these were delicious, soft and had a great texture. However, I gave them four stars because I will never make them again! The dough is sooo hard to work with! It kept cracking when I was trying to fill it. It gave me back pain and headache lol. I am not a debutante and have made many stuffed finger foods before. This one is really a pain though :(...Does come out great however!

I'm a huge fan of just about anything chocolate peanut butter, but these have to be some of the BEST cookies I've ever made. The peanut butter filling is so delicious and melted in the middle - even the next day, which I was afraid it wouldn't be. They took a little more time because of rolling the balls and then wrapping the dough around them, but it's well worth it. Also, I don't know if I made them much smaller but I got about 45 cookies out of the recipe.

Finally a homeade cookie recipe that turned out great!  I am not a baker (would rather cook a three course meal), but these cookies were easy and delicious.  The only think I did different was took another reviewers advice and added a TBSP of sour cream to the chocolate mixure to prevent drying and refrigerated the peanut butter mixture prior to covering with chocolate batter.  A++

I just made these cookies, and they are quite tasty. I agree with the other reviewers in that the chocolate dough was a little bit on the dry/not as flavorful side, but I think adding some mini chocolate chips and the sour cream will solve that problem. I also had more filling than outer dough, so I will probably decrease that to 1/2 c. pb next time. Thanks so much for sharing! Definitely a keeper. :)

These are wonderful and moist! The dough may be a bit tricky to work with when wrapping it around the peanut butter, but it only takes a bit of practice, and it's so worth it! I added just a bit of oil to the peanut butter mix so that the filling was less dry, but other than that, great recipe!

These cookies are 5/5! With a few changes. As other reviewers have said, the cookie is a bit dry. I added 2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup, 1 tablespoon of  milk and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. That made them amazing. I also made the filling first so I could chill it while I made the cookie. These changes made them delicious. However, I found out that these are really only superb when warm, they're not quite as good the next day.

Great cookie!  They taste like eating a peanut cup.  I took some of the advice and added a tbsp of milk to the chocolate dough.  I also cooled the middles before incasing them.  They weren't too hard to make.  These will make a great christmas cookie as well.

These are the best! I followed the recipe, and didn't add any milk or anything to the dough, because it was already moist. My brother kept on running up to the cooling rack and grabbing cookies. He really loved them! I liked them a lot too, even though I'm not a cookie person.

These were printed in Cottage Living magazine 03/2006 and had 1/4 tsp salt in dry ingreds.  I learned that making 26 pb middles (then eating 2) and making 24 choc balls works best for fit and finish.  Dip the tops in sugar, then flatten ONLY to 1/2".  Bake ONLY 8 mins, cool 2-3 on sheet.  Perfect!  These freeze well (flattened & uncooked), then bake directly from freezer exactly 11 min.

SO AWESOME. Added maybe 2 T milk and some extra PB to batter. Didn't crack at all. Made the middles, put in fridge, then made cookie dough. Flatten dough, put PB ball in middle, then wrap around and roll.

I know this doesn't need another 5 star review, but just wanted to add my 2 cents.   Reading all the reviews, I did add sour cream and chocolate chips to my chocolate dough. Other than that I made it just as is. I was worried about the cooking time so I started out cooking the first batch at 7 minutes. second batch at 8 and third at 9.  The first batch came out very soft, when cooled tasted like a reeces peanut butter cup cookie. YUM,but soft.   The second was a little more firm and the last being the 9 minutes a firm peanut butter cookie. All were delicious, but I would definately make them again and only cook them until 7 minutes in my oven.  Left out, They do get hard. I made them the night before, put them out on Friday morning and they were all gone by noon,except one. I kept it off to the side and tried it at about 2. It was definately drier, but still YUMMY. Great recipe...Thanks Steph!

I found these a little time consuming to make, but that could be do to it being the first time I made them and the little hands that were helping me.  I made no changes to recipe.  I found that if I rolled the chocolate dough flat and long and rolled up the peanut butter ball inside like a taco I was then able to pinch the ends shut and gently roll it to be more circular.  I ended pretty much even with chocolate and peanut butter dough.  I will definately make these again and take the advice to refrigerate the filling for a few minutes

I didn't care so much for these, but everyone else loved them. I had no problems with either the dough or filling, I did add 1 tsp of non-dairy creamer to each, and I used all natural PB (no sugar) which had been in the fridge, so was very firm, no problems with stickiness. Fun cookie!

I made these for my son to take to a Super Bowl party.  We had to sample them before he took them...they were fantastic and almost didn't make it out of the house!  I found them to be pretty labor intensive, but worth every second of the work!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, maybe I'll add some mini chocolate chips to the filling for an interesting look/texture.

O-M-G! Are these ever delicious!! I took other reviews suggestions and added 1 TBSP sour cream & 1.5 TBSP brewed coffee and added both to the wet mixture. The dough was easier to handle than I expected! I didn't have leftover peanut balls -- I flattened out the dough with the palms of my hand, placed the pb ball in the center and while still holding it in place flipped my hands over, let the dough drape over the entire ball and pinched off the excess dough. Then I just rolled them to make smoother! This made it easy to work with!!! I'm VERY impressed with this recipe! oh and btw don't cut the sugar, use the amount directed-- they are perfection if you're a chocolate/PB fanatic like me!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These were not hard at all. I mad the peanutbutter batter into balls and then set them in the fridge for an hour. Then i started on the chocolate part. I just flattened it out in my hand and wrapped it around the peanutbutter part. It was very simple to do just make sure you have the time b/c it sounds like people who did not use the fridge had a really hard time. they tasted great and will certainly make them again.

A really good surprise cookie! Not as difficult as they might seem. I've made them twice, and refrigerated the peanut butter filling both times. I've found that it keeps the peanut butter from melting as much, and keeps it with the same consistency if they're refrigerated. I refrigerated the chocolate dough the second time I made the cookies, but I wouldn't recommend that.  It dried out the dough and made it difficult to work with afterwards. A big success though!

These cookies are absolutely delicious. I made them with  a group of friends, and we decided to save dishes and do all the stuff in one bowl (not the peanut butter mix, but everything else) DO NOT DO THIS! We ended up with a powdery mess. We realized we had forgotten to add the peanut butter in the dough and it fixed everything. They were still great, but life will be less stressful if you follow the directions.

Ok so these were a total pain in the rear to make BUT the payoff was great. I set these down at my hubby's work and they didn't last an hour.(I made 200 cookies) I have requests for next Christmas already.  *Oh I also added chocolate chips to the outer cookie dough.

This is so easy and so worth it.  I have made this for the first time today.  I added the 2T sour cream and about 2T canned milk I had handy from other baking.  Put peanut butter mixture in freezer for about a half hour and the chocolate was a little sticky, but easy to manage.  Baked just like in recipe and when cooled I was able to just pick up the cookie off the cookie sheet to transfer. Very much a keeper, thanks for sharing!

I have been using Allrecipes for 5 yrs and never reviewed a recipe... These are the BEST cookie I have ever eaten... so creamy soft... I refrigerated both doughs for 2 hours..... I took a small cookie scoop of the chocolate dough and flattened it in my  hand then put the peanut butter in the middle and brought up the chocolate edges sealing on the bottom.... DELISH

These took a little time to make, but were really pretty cookies.  When you break them open you are completely surprises with the filling!  Excellent recipe and something new for our family.  These are excellent.  I rolled them in sugar before I baked them, then pressed down with a glass.  The cookies themselves were crunchy and the filling creamy.

Amazing.  Used whole wheat flour with no problem.  Followed other review suggestions and added 2 T sour cream and 1 extra egg; cookies are very soft and moist--almost like a cake-y brownie.  Also refrigerated pb filling while making dough and had no problem putting them together.  Baked for 7 minutes and then left on cookie sheet for a couple minutes to set completely.  Delicious and much easier than I expected.

This is an awesome recipe however I did have few changes. I didnt have any cocoa or enough flour so I used a box of Devils Food Cake Mix with 2 eggs and a half cup butter and used the same peanut butter recipe. The cookies turned out perfectly with no issues with cracking or being too dry. I will make these cookies like this from now on!

Love these cookies.  I never have any trouble with running out of the chocolate dough before I can use up all my peanut butter centers; in fact, the first time I made these, I had too much chocolate dough and not enough of the PB filling, so the next time I made them, I made 1 1/2 times as much PB filling as the recipe calls for.  I also use about 2 tablespoons of either sour cream or plain yogurt, whatever I have on hand, in the chocolate dough, which I think is key to getting the chocolate around the peanut butter without making a mess.  These make big cookies!  I have extra large baking sheets and can usually get 20 small drop cookies per sheet.  With these, I only get 12 per sheet.  They're a little time consuming but worth the effort (especially if you have a husband willing to help assemble them!)

I took other reviewers advice and added 2 tbsp milk to the dough and also only added 1/4 cup confect sugar to the filling, still had leftover filling. Assembly was annoying and I didn't feel a payoff, but they were a hit at a party!

These cookies were great!! My kids and husband both loved them. Just one thing that needed to be changed, it needed more moisture. So, I added about 1/4 cup of milk into my second batch and they were perfect. Moist and delicious. I will be adding this to my book of recipes. Its alot of work rolling all the cookies but get the kids involved. My 3 girls loved doing these cookies.

These are SO fabulous!  I followed the recipe except for adding a couple of tablespoons of milk to my chocolate dough, as it was a little dry, and they turned out SO GOOD!  I flattened the chocolate dough out in the palm of my hand, and since I wanted the chocolate dough to be even around the filling, I made the edges thinner than the middle because the edges ended up overlapping when I wrapped them around the peanut butter middle. I also rolled them in sugar and just flattened them slighty with my hand. So amazingly fabulous!

Very yummy! I just made these tonight for my roommate and me, and we love them already.  Contrary to a lot of the reviews on here, my dough and filling were definitely not too dry. In fact, they were almost too moist! I think they got moister as I let them sit longer.  Also contrary to a lot of reviews, I had lots of the chocolate dough left over. Fortunately, they're very yummy baked as simple chocolate cookies.  The sugar on top is a nice touch: it makes them a little more than your average cookie. And, I would love to try using a glass with a funky bottom to make a design on the top of the cookie.

I enjoyed these, but I wanted the chocolate part to be more chocolatey. I had to make 1 1/2 batches of the middles to get 30 of them. These were pretty labor intensive, but I'd never made a filled cookie before this, so I don't know if that's typical. Next time, I may try adding some melted chocolate chips to the chocolate part. I did add 2 tbsp. of crÃ¨me fraÃ®che to the chocolate dough and I think that helped.

You present a gourmet cookie, without the effort or time typically required.  It is SO easy!  Tip:  I doubled the recipe, but did not double the eggs or butter - healthier, and just as tasty.  Everyone raved over these, and I normally dislike the chocolate/peanut-butter combo.  Will make again.

I follwed the exact recipe and I still do not understand how people rate the recipe when they change it when they make it ? Anyway, I follwed the ingredient I did refrigerate for a few hour. I also forgot I used Fresh Ground Peanut butter so when I tried my first test cookie my sons face was priceless when he ate it. So I save it by rolling the peanut butter balls in sugar befor wrapping them, then I rolled the whole ball in sugar before smashing with glass bottom. EVERYONE LOVED THEM!!! I also made about 50 cookies in my batch.

what a GREAT original recipe! the only thing i changed was to add 2 tbsp sour cream but the dough was still dry (its supposed to be).. i made patties on my hand with the chocolate dough, put a pb ball in the center and wrapped it up .. the cookie is great.. At first I didnt like them but then i tasted them again and loved them. I think i ate too much the first time LOL. they are very rich!

These are quite good, especially with a glass of milk.  I found the easiest way to make these successfully was to make balls of the cookie dough, and then using thumb make an indent (think jam thumbprint).  After putting the peanut butter mixture in you just wrap and seal.  My boyfriend's mom, a peanut butter junkie, LOVED these.

When I first saw the reviews on this, I was scared to try and make it. Everyone made it out to be a  monster to make. I had NO problems. It was pretty easy, just a bit time consuming is all. The cookies are GREAT!!!

great flavor, but a bit dry...I don't know how to fix that. I followed the recipe to the letter, and only baked the cookies for 7min. I think I would bake them for even less time if I made them again. It's hard to say when every oven is different. Watch them carefully, and I am sure you will get a great cookie!

I made this recipe with my friend because we wanted to make cookies but didn't want to go to the store to get chocolate chips! The dough and the filling were very easy to make. We added about a teaspoon of half-and-half to the peanut butter filling though. We used the bottom of a wine glass to press them to about 1/2 inch thickness. Baked for exactly 6 mins and they were perfect! Very easy, quick, and delicious! We found the perfect recipe for using the ingredients in our kitchen without having to run to the store! We decided that we'll each bake them for our families at Christmas!!!!

As good as these cookies were... and they were GOOD!... I doubt I will be making them very often. It took me an hour and a half from start to finish, and my final product was approx. 25 cookies. I was a little disappointed at that. However, they were very good!

My husband just made these for the first time. He loves to bake and said these were not nearly as difficult as other reviewers made them out to be. He followed the recipe exactly, made the pb balls smaller than I imagined them, and put them in the freezer for a few minutes. He didn't have any leftover. Perfect combination of sweet/salty, plenty moist, no cracks. He used Skippy Natural PB, so that might make a difference.  The best thing about this recipe is that it uses ingredients that we always have on hand. No special shopping trip, woo hoo!

These are soooo good.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.  I had four peanut butter balls leftover, but that was because I used too much dough on a few cookies.  It was not difficult to wrap the dough around the peanut butter ball, you just flatten the chocolate dough and then wrap it around the ball, it was super easy.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe to make again.  I took one to by husband when they came out of the oven and told him they taste like a baked Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Thanks!

I was disappointed with these cookies! I thought they would be amazing, and they do look neat when you split them in half. BUT I found the dough was very very dry and the filling was a bit dry too. Not only that I had so much leftover filling that I ended up throwing away cause I wasn't sure what to do with a peanut butter sugar mixture...

Great tasting and very rich.  Definitely need a full glass of milk with each cookie.  Unlike other reviewers I ended up with leftover dough instead of filling.  I think 1 inch of filling is too much I ended up with 24 LARGE cookies.

These cookies were amazing! 
Firstly - I did chill the dough to help with manipulating it.
I flattened a small disk shape first, laid it on the cookie sheet, then applied a small dollap of peanut butter filling in the centre of each disc. Then I flattened another disc of dough, placed it on top, then worked my way around each cookie to seal the filling in.  I did have to pick up the cookie and put it in my hand to seal the edges, but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty smooth.  Also - I didn't bother with the sugar coating - was pretty sweet to begin with. 

Amazing flavour combo though! People loved them!

It was a pain in the butt to wrap the middles, but if you have the patience to do it, the taste is worth it! Chill the middles in the fridge for about 40 minutes before trying to roll into balls. Also, I ended up throwing away some of the middle mix because the recipe yielded too much.. next time I will use 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar instead of the 3/4 each.

Not so amazingly good as all of the reviews had me expecting and definitely not worth the trouble to make.  The chocolate cookie part was pretty bland and even though I took them out at exactly the right time (solid, but not burnt/browned on the bottom), they were hard and dry by the next day.  An easy method of covering the PB balls: flatten some chocolate dough on the palm of your hand, peel it up, place the PB ball in the middle, make 2 opposite edges of the chocolate dough meet and pinch the edges together.

I was fairly disappointed in this recipe. I thought that the chocolate cookie part was very bland. I may would try this again with a different cookie dough recipe. I also added 1 Tbsp of milk to the dough and refrigerated it while preparing the filling. For those that have had trouble with a crumbly PB filling... keep smashing the PB and conf sugar with the mixing spoon until the PB begins to get a little oily. As far as wrapping the cookies in the dough, I had no problem. I took about 1 Tbsp of cookie dough and smashed it flat with my palm on my cutting board. I set a PB ball in the middle and wrapped it kinda like a burrito. I then rolled it around in my palm similar to the way I did with the PB balls. All of the cookies were nice, round balls until I flattened them a little with a flat glass. I used a tsp to sprinkle them with sugar. The cookies turned out very pretty, but lacked in taste for me. =(

These cookies are the best!  Based on reviews, I added a tablespoon of water to the cookie dough.  Other than that, I thought they were very easy to put together.  If you are a peanut butter fan, you will be in heaven.  I will be making these often.

These were really good but had some difficulty getting 30 cookies. I did not roll the middles into 1 inch balls..I couldnt if I wanted 30 cookies. I rolled them into about a 1/2 inch ball and that made the 30 cookies.

Fabulous cookies!! It is a bit of work - but the finished product made it well worth it. I did follow the advice a few reviews: 1. I lowered the white and brown sugar to 1/3 cup each, 2. Added a TBSP of water to the chocolate cookie dough for extra moisture 3. Froze the peanut butter balls while I measured out the chocolate cookies (so that I would have an equal amount of each) and 4. Balled the chocolate cookie dough and then when I was ready to imbed the PB, I just dug my thumb in and then covered the PB in the hole (this worked GREAT).
My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe! I made 26 cookies...yeah, I tend to make big cookies. :)

wonderful flavor, but I don't know if I did something wrong because the chocolate cookie dough turned out very dry once baked and these cookies were very hard to eat...but again, worth it to try doing something differently because they tasted great!

These just came out of the oven and my husband and three little ones were standing by ready to grab one and be the taste testers.  They turned out well, the kids were a little bummed that I ended up having to do this myself, too hard for the little ones, but they enjoyed the end result.  I ended up adding an extra egg, and about a tablespoon of water to the chocolate mix, it helped make it more managable, but other than that they were great!  Big hit with a 7,5,and 2 year old for sure!  Thanks!

Delish!  My whole family loved these!  I did have to freeze the PB part, it was impossible to work with.  Once frozen, it worked out fine.  I also added a splash of milk to the chocolate part to make it a bit easier to work with.  What I did was grab a blob of chocolate and flatten it in my hand, then put the PB in the center and work the chocolate up around it to make a ball.  I also rolled them in sugar before putting on the cookie sheet.  Flattened them just a bit.  Perfect!!!  I have to make more, my family really loves them!

I was little put-off by the effort that went into these cookies. It was well worth it though! I took the suggestions of another reviewer and decreased both the brown and white sugar to 1/3 a cup and added a tablespoon of milk. I'm not sure if it helped or not but it seems to have worked out alright. When I did the first one I had trouble shaping the dough like the recipe said so I flattened it between my un-floured hands and made a pinch pot/cup formation around my thumb. I set the peanut butter ball in the indentation and then just formed the dough around it gently flattening and pressing together the dough between cupped hands,sealing cracks as best as I could as I went along. It worked pretty well. The only problem is by doing it that way I went a little heavy on the dough and now I have 10 peanut butter balls left! Doh! Oh well!:) I'm going to freeze them and hopefully they'll get used for something else. Thanks for this decadent recipe!

ok, Big ice storm today - I can't get to work, and hubby is on the fire dept so I am stuck at home with nothing to do, luckily I have electricity! That's why I decided to tackle something that others said was soooo time consuming. I have to admit, it only took me 1 hour, from beginning to end. I made the filling first, refrigerating as others suggested while making the rest. I only had about 1/2 cup of creamy pb, so I used it with 1/4 cup of chunky in the filling, and chunky in the cookie part. I used others suggestions of 2TBSP sour cream in the cookie, and tasted the batter before assembing, and thought it was pretty blah, so I added 1 cup semi-sweet choc chips -the perfect addition!! I used about a teaspoon of filling per ball, work them well between your hands and they won't be too crumbly. Don't be afraid of too much flour on your hands while working the chocolate, it's what keeps it from being so sticky. A little extra sugar on the tops after pressing them out, and they turned out heavenly! So far, I am the only one to try them, I hope there are some left by the time hubby gets home!! This is definately a keeper!!

Okay... the cookie wasn't great, not very chocolaty... but, the filling was nice. I'll just use the filling recipe and use another chocolate cookie recipe instead.

These cookies were incredibly labor-intensive.  The cookie dough was dry and difficult to shape around the peanut butter filling.  The cookies themselves were delicious, but they had taken me so long to make that I almost flinched at the rate at which they disappeared.  Excellent recipe, but I'm still debating whether it's fully worth all the effort.

These were very good.  The only thing I did differant was to freeze the peanut butter and confectioner sugar before rolling in the balls.  I also got about 30 cookies out of the recipe.  They are on their way to Afganistan for my son and the rest of the guys and gals who are serving.  Thank you.

Wow!  Thank you for putting my husband's 2 very favorite things (peanut butter and chocolate) into one cookie.  These were a HUGE hit with our family.  The chocolate cookie dough turned out a little dry at first but I just added a tablespoonful or two of water and the dough was beautiful.  What a fun cookie recipe!

WOW!  This are soooo good.  I added a couple of extra tablespoons of cocoa powder and 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to boost the chocolate flavor.. highly recommended.  I also added an extra egg... if your dough seems a bit dry, I would recommend either another egg or adding some sour cream as suggested by another reviewer.  I would also make the filling first and then chill that while you're making the dough.  I had no problems with it being too sticky.  Make sure your filling balls are small... 1" is probably too big.  I made them pretty small and then it was easy to wrap the chocolate part around it, and it still had a big peanut butter inside.  Really, I didn't think these were all that hard and they turned out beautifully.

After reading the reviews I was a little scared to make them. They were actually easier than I thought. I followed recipe exactly and did not chill dough or filling. I think I got lucky because the count was perfect. The only issue I had was I think they need more chocolate flavor and the bake time/temp I think is off. Perhaps 350? I will need to experiment with this as they were a little too crunchy for my taste.

I've made these for the past 5 or 6 years.  My kids (now teens) list this one as their top 1 or 2 that I make for Christman.  Yes, they take a little time...so do cut out-cookies and most of the ones that are decorated.  It's worth the time when you see the smiles appear! I use green icing and drizzle a tree shape to dress them up for my cookie platers.

This recipe is very good but a bit labor intensive. I found thay if I scooped out 30 globs of the Peanut butter mixture and then froze them for 15 minutes it was alot easier to form them into balls and get the chocolate part to cover them. I also chilled the chocolate dough for about 15 minutes. Mine yielded 33 cookies.

I have made these cookies a few times. 

I added a little bit of water (a tablespoon or two) to the chocolate dough before wrapping it around the peanut butter balls and it made it a lot easier (and a lot less time consuming). 

I took these to a party with some friends from church and didn't even get one! They were all gone by the time I went to get my food. 

Everyone raved about them!

As delicious as these are, I doubt I'll make these again because as everyone has said before me - they're a lot of work.  Not that they're hard to make, just time consuming.  It pays off in the end though when you bite into a creamy peanut butter center - yum!

These were AWESOME!!!  My arm is hurting from making them, but the pain is worth the pleasure.  To cover the peanut butter/confectioners sugar, I flattened the dough and wrapped it.  That is what hurt my arm.  But...WOW!! Thank you for an AWESOME recipe!

I hated this recipe! I couldn't get the ouside cookie part to work. My dough looked like ground beef, it was dry and crumbly. I tried to add more peanut butter but nothing seamed to help it. This is not a sweet cookie. May be a little better if you used the sweetened cocoa. I will not be useing this again. But I could be doing something wrong with all of the good reviews that it has.

These are awesome...slightly crispy cookie on the outside and the peanut butter stays creamy on the inside.  Of course, all the ones I've had have been right out of the oven.  :)  I'm sure they're just as good when they've cooled.  I followed this recipe but baked them at 350.  AWESOME!

This cookie is definitely not "hard" to make.  Anyone who has the patience to roll up 30 little balls will be fine :)  Also, as long as you follow the recipe exactly you shouldn't have any problems with too much dough/filling or too dry of dough.  These cookies taste wonderful and are extremely unique.  My only small complaint is that once cooled they are slightly dry.  Fresh out of the oven is best!

THE BEST! Seriously, if you love peanut butter and chocolate, do not hesitate to make these cookies! I got RAVE reviews from everyone that tried them! I think the proportions may be out though, I ended up with a lot of peanut butter middle left over. Delicious!

I loved the taste of these cookies, I did not like the preperation. I am known as the girl who will whip up a batch of cookies just because she got a craving, so I am definately used to making cookies.  However, I struggled making this cookie.  The peanut butter filling was too soft to form into balls, even after I put more confectionner's sugar than the recip called for, so I refrigerated the filling for about 15 minutes.  It helped.  I also had trouble with the cookie dough.  I don't know how everyone is "shapping the dough around the balls of peanut butter" but my cookie dough was too dry, it kept craking.  I will keep trying this recipe because the result was still a super tasty and fun cookie, but the method just didn't work for me.

I made these in the past, and loved them.  This time, I made them gluten free - using 1/2 cup each of tapioca flour, corn starch, and white rice flour. The dough comes out slightly stiffer than with wheat flour, but they got rave reviews. I may add slightly more PB to soften the dough next time I make them GF.

Seemed very time consuming - had to actually freeze the peanut butter middles in order to wrap the chocolate part around them.  The chocolate part was easy to handle.  Once they were done, my kids AND my husband loved them.

Very fun cookies!  Made them with two seven-year-olds.  They had a great time.  Was a little intimidated by wrapping one cookie around another, but it turned out fine!  Very good and unusual cookies!

OH if only I had read the reviews before I began...never mind. Many thanks to all who wrote their review. I added about 2 Tbs. of water to the batter as the flour just seemed too dry even using my KitchenAid mixer. I also put the center mix in the freezer and the batter in the fridge for about 30 minutes. It made it quite easy to form them.
We just took a bite and oh wow! Worth the time and effort.

Super yummy! Although me and my buddy (Nat) accidentally mixed up the peanut butter measures. But they are still good! 
If you want light and fluffy cookies put your batter in the fridge for at least five minutes.

Really good and easy to make. This recipe made 40 cookies. I ended up putting sugar on top of half of the cookies. I did not use a cup to flatten. I put the chocolate around the peanut butter balls then smashed it with my hand and patched parts that had exposed peanut butter

These were pretty good and easy to make, but I agree with others that the chocolate cookie part is a little dry.

Great cookies! A bit more work, but simple, fun and delicious. Cookies don't fall when baking, so flatten fully beforehand.  I cooled peanut butter balls after rolling them before wrapping them.
Using Rubes1 tip creates a smooth chocolate cookie with hidden center. Recipe unaltered creates crumbly peanut/chocolate marbled cookies.  Both are great.

I made them for Christmas. A lot of work. They looked like big hamburger patties, stuffed with cheese. I had to cut them into bars. They are not good. I ended up throwing them in the trash. I wouldn't even give them 1 star. Ok  I have to give them at least 1 star, to post my review.

This is a great recipe and pretty labor intensive.  I was very pleased with this recipe despite the fact that I didnâ€™t stuff the cookies with enough peanut butter.   I added 2T of sour cream and an extra egg to the chocolate mixture per others that have made them. I also rolled in sugar before baking.  I will make these again.  Yummy!!

Ok, I'll start by saying everyone liked these cookies, except me!  The chocolate dough came out dryish and was hard to work with and mold around the peanut butter filling. That didn't bother me so much because they were pretty even though cracks of peanut filling showed through, it looked like they were supposed to be that way. But, the chocolate cookie dough and then the cookie tasted awful to me. Bitter and just awful, even though i used a high end cocoa powder. I did use less sugar in the dough as was recommended by reviewers but I don't think adding more would have improved the taste. The sugar on top is a must, otherwise they are so not sweet and just don't taste good at all.

Definitely eat with a big glass of milk - these are great!  As suggested, I added a Tbsp. of milk to the dough and chilled the filling. I pressed the dough out flat and wrapped around the chilled filling. Worked wonderfully.

Made as is... some people said that the dough was to dry but if you mix long enough, the dough does come together. You really have to freeze the middles to get the dough around them. I really wanted to like this recipe but the chocolate part was very dry and crumbly and didn't have a lot of flavor.  I even tried under baking them slightly which helped with the crumbly problem but not the flavor.

While they were a little labor-intensive, they really were quickly made.  They looked rather boring after being cooked so I put a dollop of peanut butter icing on top.  They were a hit!

I am not a novice baker by any means but I just could not work with this. The dough was extremely crumbly and the filling was extremely sticky. I couldn't work the dough around the middle. It was a complete waste of time, ingredients, and money.

These little cookies are magical!  They are tender (don't over bake!) yet sturdy.  I did add 1/2 t salt to the chocolate batter as well as an additional 2 Tbs of peanut butter to the batter along with a T of water.  Make the filling first and chill it for easier handling.  I will make these over and over again!

This is the second Christmas I've made these cookies and I still have people asking for the recipe.  This time I found if you don't over beat the chocolate cookie, but form a ball in your hand, then flatten it in your palm, it wraps easier.  It almost needs to be heated by your hand to be more pliable. And yes, as someone else mentioned, use good chocolate. I use Ghirardelli.

The cookie was quite dry.   I refrigerated the filling and the dough first and had no problems preparing the cookies.  The taste was okay, but if I make them again I will definitely take the advice of other reviewers and use sour cream to moisten the cookie.

I will definitely be making these for my son's bake sale for school! These cookies are a little bit of work assembling, but the taste more than makes up for it!
I made some of the cookies a little bit bigger and those ones cooked best at 9 minutes for soft cookies. Then I made a bunch of small ones, about golf ball size when cooked, those cook best at 7 mins for soft cookies. If you like more filling just use less cookie dough when covering. 
I didn't even need to flour my hands to make these, they weren't sticky at all - just perfect! 
I took them to work and my employees ate them all within 10 min! I would 10 out of 10 recommend!

I had been meaning to make this one years ago, but I never got around to it. I finally did last weekend and they were a hit! Only one small problem. I had way too little filling! Thankfully the filling is only two ingredients, so it was easy to make some more. Just be prepared to make double the filling and you'll be pleasantly surprised by this one!

First time making these and I followed the directions exactly.  I found the chocolate dough to be dry and hard to form around the PB.  It also tastes a bit bitter to me (I used Nestle cocoa).  Other reviewers have suggestions to fix these issues.  As is, the cookies are OK but not worth the hassle to make again.  I'll stick to the PB cookies where you press a mini Reese's cup into the middle instead.

Surprisingly easy - I'll definitely make these again! I followed some tips from other reviews and the cookies turned out great. I made the filling first and put the peanut butter balls (about 1 tsp each) in the  freezer while I made the chocolate batter. I added 1/8 tsp salt and 1 Tbsp water to the chocolate batter. To form the cookies, I flattened 1 Tbsp of the batter to about a 2" circle in my palm, added a peanut butter ball in the middle, folded up the sides, and rolled between my palms. I had no trouble getting the batter to cover the filling and didn't even have to flour my hands. I used Jif creamy peanut butter.

These always turn out super impressive. 
Just make sure you add a couple tablespoons of sour cream to the chocolate dough. Also, keep the peanut butter balls and the chocolate dough in the freezer while you're not actively making cookies.

Did not come out close to what I was expecting....Advice: Read the reviews--- they give better tips on how to make this recipe better. I didn't see them until after. Disappointing :(

These are good, although a little dryer than I expected. 

I subbed the 1/2 c margarine for 1/4 butter and 1/4 coconut oil. Also used a 1/4 c extra peanut butter in the dough. I like the balance of flavors, but wish it was a little moister. Maybe I will try some honey in place of the sugar next time.

These cookies were a great surprise. The first time I made the recipe I added 1 T. of milk to the chocolate dough and 1 T. PB to the filling. Chilled both dough batches and made 36 cookies. They stayed moist for several weeks. The second time, based on recommendations of others, I added a second egg and 2 T. of mayonnaise to the chocolate dough  and found the dough was a bit too soft and cracked when baking. Either way, cookies are VERY tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly and these came out great. I can't really comment on why so many people have had trouble with the dough being dry. I found the dough to be moist and flavorful. Like others, I divided the peanut butter middles into 30 even balls to make assembly faster and easier. I flattened the chocolate dough in my palm and then popped the peanut butter ball in the middle. The heat from your hand melts the dough slightly and it makes it fairly easy to shape dough around the peanut butter. Once you get the hang of it, assembly goes fairly quickly. 
These are great warm from the oven, but are also good if you pop them into the microwave for about 10 seconds before eating.

I made a similar recipe two years ago from a bh&g magazine,   This was handy ,so tried it, using amykat,s changes to flour, cocoa, and the use of tsp for filling and tbsp for cover.  Plus freezing filling balls.  Easy as pie, after the first 6, I only used 3/4 of a full tbsp and that worked well, had I done that originally, would not have had 3 filling balls left.  It is still quite a bit of work for what I got, exactly 30 cookies, but the taste is impressive.

Cookies were good - not great.  The filling was awesome, but the cookie part was lacking.   I used this filling with the cookie recipe from the caramel filled cookies and the results were phenomenal.

My husband and I thought these were just alright.  The outside cookie isn't very sweet, and this isn't compensated by the sweetness in the filling.

Nice texture, fluffy soft dough with a thin crisp around & good balance of peanut butter.  My Reese's peanut butter cup lover will devour these!  I'll have to set some aside for me.  Oh- I sub'd 1/2 cup of wheat flour for CRICKET baking flour.  Still good, and high in protein!!  Yay for sustainable baking.

Every time we try a new recipe, we think that we have found the best cookie.  This cookie is truly the best cookie I have ever made!!  A few changes due to altitude is that we added an extra egg and an extra tablespoon of flour.  We also did not put the sugar on the bottom of the glass jar.  Instead we used parchment paper to prevent it from sticking.  This cookie barely cracked and did not take to long to make.  They came out beautifully soft with a creamy peanut butter middle.

Fantastic recipe! I made it with GF flour and after reading reviews added an extra egg and about 1/4 C extra flour. I ended up with more batter than filling so had some "duds", but the end result was amazing! Everyone loved them and I ended up giving out the recipe.

I COMPLETELY changed the 'cookie' on this recipe.  It was really bland the first time I made it following all the directions.  And make sure you use skippy or jif peanut butter.... if you use the natural stuff it's not sweet enough.  I am constantly looking for peanut butter and chocolate cookie recipes  because my husband is IN LOVE with the combo.... this chocolate cookie works MUCH better....WAY better CHOCOLATE flavor.... 

1/2 cup butter 
1/2 cup shortening 
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract 
1 tsp coffee extract 
2 cups all purpose flower
2/3 cup coco powder 
3/ teaspoon baking soda 
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips (chopped)

Please don't be discouraged by reviews that say this is a difficult dish;  it is not.  It does take some time to assemble, but I found it easy thanks to the cooks who recommended preparing the filling first and freezing the balls.  I added three heaping tablespoons of mayonnaise and three heaping tablespoons of extra cocoa to the cookie mixture which made for a very moist, chocolaty, almost brownie-like cookie.  This dough is very easy to work with and is very easy to mold into a long tube that I cut into 30 even pieces.  Flatten a piece a bit with your palm, take a ball out of the freezer (I kept the balls in the freezer while working on the counter next to the freezer, taking out one ball at a time while assembling), and plop the ball in the middle of the cookie dough slab, then simply mold the chocolate around the ball.  Very simple and assembly took maybe twenty minutes.  Take them out of the oven at 8-9 minutes for a soft, moist brownie texture.  Finished product is delicious and dangerously addictive!

The 5-star reviews for this recipe are a little misleading, if you ask me, since many of them were given after altering the original recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as given. These cookies are pretty bad, but not totally inedible. The chocolate dough gets extremely dry and crackly, which some have remedied with sour cream and an extra egg. I will re-try this recipe with the changes suggested because I'm making it for an event, and because it's made with ingredients I prefer not to feed my family (refined sugar and flour), I am not excited to feed these to my toddler, even though he wouldn't mind their taste and texture.

I found this recipe (or similiar version) about 15+ years ago and started making them for holidays, in fact, they were requested every year.  About 7 yrs ago, I lost all my recipes including this one.

I made this version once and the dough seemed to be dryer and harder to wrap so I'm not sure if this is the exact recipe.. They did seem to taste the same though, so I am not really sure.

I do know that they are totally worth the prep time and I will try to make them again and see if it wasn't user error on my part.

The chocolate batter was awfully dry! I had a terrible time wrapping the batter around the peanut butter! I hated the cookies the day i made them but tried them the next day. MUCH BETTER! I suggest making these before an event first to see what your getting into.

So good and fun to make. As per previous reviews I reduced both types of sugar to 1/3 cup and added 2 Tbs of sour cream to the liquid ingredients. I divided both sets of dough into ~30 balls to make sure I would have an equal number for both.

These cookies are delicious! The dough is hard to work with and it would be easier to make step 3 first so the dough doesn't have a chance to dry out. However i did wet my hands and the moisture seemed to help a lot.

OH my...I am in chocolate peanut butter heaven. These are such little yummies...I added 3/4 cup of raisins to the filling and 1 cup of dry old-fashioned oats to the cookie dough for a little extra punch-my husband loved the addition of the raisins! Definitely adding this recipe to my cookie-making arsenal.

This recipe was FABULOUS.  I made the filling first, and then left the peanut butter balls in the fridge to chill while I made the rest.  (It was easier to form balls after they'd been in the fridge.)

Also, I melted part of a Hershey's bar to add to the chocolate batter to make it sweeter, and I added the smallest splash of diet coke to make it thinner.

I ended up coming up with 24 cookies, and they were quickly devoured.  I'll be making more very soon!

These were the most peanut-buttery, fantastically magical cookies i've ever made. I did add a little extra peanut butter to the cookie dough recipe, but that was the only change i made. To assemble, i used my cookie baller to make little sandwhiches of chocolate and peanut butter. I found the dough very easy to work with, though it did crack when i pressed the cookies. Next time I will try it with a little sour cream to see if this prevents the cracking.

These are amazing!  I was worried about the peanut butter filling oozing out but they turned out perfect & were VERY delicious!  Dough was very easy to mold (playdo texture) so it wasn't hard at all.  Can't wait to share these cookies!

Love this recipe it is really good.  I need to eat gluten free, so to modify it to meet my needs I replaced the all purpose flour with 1 cup of rice flour and 1/2 cup of tapioca flour.  I also added 1 teaspoon of xanthum gum.

Chocolate and peanut butter, how can you go wrong? Good recipe, a little difficult to make, but I love a challenge. With a little time and practice these can easily be perfected. Taste great! Will make again.

3 1/2 stars bump these up to a four for me.  I thought the sweetness of the peanut butter middle made the cookie dough taste too cocoa-y; my husband said it tasted like they were burnt.  I had no problems assembling these - I made 16 large chocolate balls, pushed an indent in the chocolate ball, pushed a peanut butter ball in and then closed the chocolate dough.  By only making 16, the cookies were medium-large sized and baked for 10 minutes.  I do love that they kept their shape while baking, they look very pretty, and the texture of the chocolate dough is very much like a traditional peanut butter cookie.  I will probably make these again for their novelty, but will attempt to make the baked cookie more pleasing by messing around with the amounts of sugar & cocoa. UPDATE: I made these again and cut the powdered sugar by 1/8c and assembled the cookies with powdered sugar instead of flour.  I only slightly flattened them before baking because I love how they retain their shape so well. These are perfect!

At first I was having trouble keeping the dough from cracking and exposing the peanut butter middles but what helped me is to freeze the middles after making them into balls, then take them out 3 or 4 at a time to wrap them in the dough while the rest stay frozen until I'm ready to pull another 3 or 4 out. Before wrapping them be sure to knead the dough very well in your hand to make sure it sticks to it's self well, that will help prevent cracking. I would knead the dough, roll it into a ball, press my thumb into the center of it and place the peanut butter middle in the middle, this makes it easier to wrap in my experience. I think the dough could have used a little extra something for flavor, they are tasty but could use some chocolate chips or something as another reviewer posted. My first sheet of them was a crackly crumbly mess, my second one was pristine perfection, so it really depends on the method you use while assembling and baking them. I enjoyed them very much.

Excellent! Make sure you freeze the peanut butter middles so that they are easier to wrap the dough around. I also sprayed the glass with cooking spray so that the sugar would stick to it before flattening the cookie.

AWESOME! Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe! : ) I read the other reviews and here is what I did (from start to finish - about 58 minutes and no issues with dough or filling). pb filling - 1 cup pb, 1 cup powdered sugar (chilled once mixed) chocolate cookie part - I added about 2 tbs milk to mix and started to chill; but then realized it was so easy to wrap around the chilled pb. I cooked at 375F for only 7 minutes and removed immediately to cooling rack. They were perfect. Chewy (not dry) and not cracked. I will definitely be making these again.

These are very good! The chocolate part was way too dry and I had trouble covering the balls, I added more peanut butter then ended up adding about 3 T. of milk which helped immensely. It could have been my oven but you have to watch them closely or they burn - the middle doesn't need to cook through, just the outer coating.

This cookie was pretty delicious, but suuuper difficult to make. I took a bunch of people's suggestions of freezing the middles, and that helped a lot, but it was really hard to tell when the cookies were done. I LOVED the texture, but I wish there was more peanut butter and less chocolate. The dough was really fun to play with, ahaha. My mom suggested adding powdered milk, which helped with the stickiness but made it grainy, so DON'T DO THAT if you think it's a good idea. I would make these again, but I think I'd have to find something different for the chocolate outside. Also, I didn't like them warm, so if you try them right out of the oven and hate them, just let them cool :]. They're addicting.

The first time I made this, I found it to be very time consuming to wrap the dough around the middles. The next time I made it I rolled out the dough, put the centers on it, topped with dough and then used my ravioli cutter- works like a charm and saves so much time!  A favorite recipes of my kids and friends!

These were hard to make in the first place, even after freezing the centers.  And then once they were baked they were dry and not really great.  We won't make them again.

I'd give this 5 stars for the taste, but the cookie dough was impossible to work with! It was way too dry and it cracked while I was trying to wrap it around the peanut butter balls. It says in the directions to flour your hands which only makes things worse! I would either cut the flour down or add a bit of applesauce next time, these did not turn out pretty.

These were just what I was looking for, but are pretty sweet.  Because there is sugar in the peanutbutter too, I would probably cut the sugar in the dough to 1/3 cup.  I also took several others' advice and added the 1/2 tsp salt, 1 TB milk, 1 TB chocolate syrup, and an extra 1 tsp vanilla to the dough, plus a 1/2 tsp vanilla to the filling.  To bring out the chocolate flavor I dissolved 1/2 tsp instant coffee into the milk, and you don't taste coffee at all, but I think it did add a little contrast for the chocolate flavor.  Be sure to add enough powder sugar to the filling so that it isn't too soft and is easier to work with.  I also chilled the filling before wrapping the chocolate dough around it.  I baked them for 8-9 minutes and that was fine because they are a soft cookie and I didn't want them to be too raw against the filling.  Its OK if some of the filling shows through the dough when you flatten them--it won't run out or anything...It was also a great idea to roll the filling balls and all the dough balls before you put them together to make sure you have enough of each.  I got 31 cookies no problem, and they were nice big cookies.  Not a quick recipe to make, but it is a specialty-type cookie, worth the little extra effort.

I LOVE sweets, and these were even a little too sweet for me.  The  next time, I'll cut down to 1/4 cup of white sugar.  Overall, these were very good and not too tricky to prepare.  I divided the PB and chocolate into 30 pieces each before getting started to make sure I'd have an even number of everything.  I also partially froze the PB balls to make wrapping them easier.  I rolled them completely in sugar before smashing them.

Hmm.. ive made these cookies twice.. the first time i followed the recipce exactly and the only thing i did in addition is  followed one suggestion and added 1 1/2 tblspn of milk to the dough to make it not as dry.. the dough came out great, but the cookie overall was WAY TOO SWEET. which was suprising cause usually i love things to be super sweet, but i still found these TOO sweet. it was just overwhelming.. I mean the cookies with less of the "middle" in them where okay, but still too much.. the second time i made them i completeky avoided making the middle, and just made the dough.. used less butter (otherwise there too greasy) added a lille more PB, added some Chocolate chips, and PB chips-- baked them just like that and they came out Soooooooo good. Loved them.. i give it 4 stars because the actually recipe sucks- they're easy to make, but just to overwhelming for  a cookie..

Made exactly as written - I only got 22 cookies :) I didn't do anything special to put them together, just kind of thumbed the outside around the middle and rolled to seal. I suspect I may have undercooked them a bit but they were excellent - 2 days and between hubbie and I they are gone!

Excellent right out of the oven!  I made it exactly as stated except I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa because that's what I had on hand.  The flavor was perfect!  The dough was very easy to manipulate (not dry at all).  I did this assembly-line style and it didn't take long at all.  I chilled the peanut butter dough while rolling and flattening all the chocolate dough.  Add a ball of PB dough to each one, then go back and roll them up.  Working this way, it goes very fast.  And they're sooooo worth it!

These are pretty dang good. I followed the recipe verbatim. Chill both the dough and filling before trying to roll. I must have used too much chocolate dough for each cookie because I ended up with only 22 cookies.

i usually hate baking cookies because they always turn out wrong but this looked so delicous that i had to try it-they came out and tasted SOOO good! i found the proportions to be perfect and i didnt make any alterations. i used the great tip of flattening out the dough first and i dont think it would have worked otherwise. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good and I did not find them difficult to make at all.  I made both dough and filling and wrapped them in plastic wrap and allowed them to chill for a couple of hours.  I then made sure I had an equal number of portions of both and just wrapped the dough around the scoop of the filling.  They look great and taste great.

These were yummy and the whole family loved them. Note: the dough was a little dry and crumbly, so I added a tablespoon of water; this made forming around the filling easier.

Fantastic! Since there are no eggs in the center, it does not have to cook through thouroughly.  I did not find it very sweet, so I added a tiny bit more powdered sugar to both batters.  This made them both easier to work with and no need to keep flouring hands!  I kept cutting a couple in half and leaving them on the tray because they are so beautiful.  Everyone's eyes get big and round when they bite into them as they were so surprised.

These cookies were so good, I made them two days in a row. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were all eaten in less than 24 hours.  Last night when I made these, I made a few changes to the recipe. We had gone to a party and were served cookies with caramel centers, and they were really good, but they were prepackaged (like the slice and bake ones I guess). I took that idea and applied it to this cookie, instead of PB in the cookie batter I used Nutella (I also added some instant coffee granules to increase the chocolate flavor of the cookie) and I wrapped the batter around Rollo's.   I ate one warm and it wasn't the greatest, but now that they are cool, they are outstanding!

I couldn't decide at first if I liked these - the texture is a little close to just eating plain peanut butter -but after a couple, I couldn't stop eating them!!!  SOOOO goood!!!  I added a couple tbsps of coffee to the cookie part (which actually tastes like a brownie- mmm) to moisten it up a bit.

Very yummy!  I did add chocolate chips for a richer chocolate taste.  The recipe was a lot easier then several reviews made it sound.  I rolled the peanut butter balls and put them in the fridge for a few minutes, then I flattened out chocolate circles and easily wrapped them around the peanut butter balls.  I will definitely make these again!

Love these cookies. My husband took a bite and nodded his head and sighed as if he had been sent straight to heaven! disclaimer: I did not have time to make the dough, so I used my old cake mix cookie stand by for the chocolate cookie (one box chocolate cake mix, 1/3 cup oil and 2 eggs) Am I crazy in only getting 16-1 inch balls out of the filling? I even pulled out my ruler to see if I was making them too big, but I wasn't. Anyhow, wrapped the dough around the pb balls, flattened and then baked for 7 min. Perfection! Thank you!

Pretty good cookies.  I'm not sure they were magical enough for all the trouble, but I would probably make them again.  I kept having to put the dough back in the fridge so it wouldn't stick to my hands.

I had a hard time getting the dough around the peanut butter balls.  The dough seemed dry and cracked easily.  And I also had to eat about 4 peanut butter balls.  No problem there, ha ha.  Maybe I messed it up.  They still tasted good, but like others said, it seemed like a lot of work and mess to put this cookie together.

Excellent cookie!  I did add 2 TBS of sour cream, and I think it helped make the cookies softer.  I mad the peanut butter balls first and then put them in the fridge for my chilling time.  I only cooked for 7 minutes as well (over cooking can kill a cookie).  Thanks for the recipe!  A keeper in my book.

I thought the cookie batter was just a bit to cocoa-y tasting.  I don't think the peanut butter in the middle balanced these cookies out enough.  They were okay, but I definitely do not think that I will be making these again.

I think these cookies were good but I would never make them again.  The cookies were very moist and hard to eat just one.  The reasons why I would never make again. First the cookies tasted too much like a peanut butter cookie.  With all the work of rolling the filling and the cookie part these aren't worth the time.  There was no contrast in flavor between the inside and the cookie you wrapped around it - just peanut butter, even though you added cocoa to the dough.  Second, my dough was dry, I added milk that someone else suggested and that worked great.  I wish now that I would have added coffee like another review because I think it would have given them better flavor.  I bake A LOT and have a great PB cookie recipe that I can add chocolate chips and are much tastier and easier to make.

Great idea! I love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter so I wasn't surprised these cookies were a hit!   I didn't have any trouble getting the dough around the peanut butter balls, it just took me a few to get the hang of it.   I did think that the finished cookies were a little dry. I will try making them again with a different dough and post how it worked.     Despite their dryness, the flavor was great! And they looked awesome! (See my picture) I will definitely be making again!

These are absolutely divine, but you have to doctor the dough to get it moist enough.  I mixed up the recipe as written first, but the chocolate dough was terribly crumbly--it looked more like an oreo pie crust than cookie dough.  I added 1/4 cup of milk and that helped a little, but they were still hard to roll out.  I ended up running water over my hands before I made each little chocolate wrapping.  The extra water moistened the dough enough that it spread across my hand quickly, but not so much that it became runny.  From there, I pulled up on all the sides and wrapped it like you would wrap a fruit basket with cellophane.  I was a little worried that the extra moisture would ruin the cookies, but it didn't.  They came out nice and moist, even though I made them really flat.  I had to cook them for 10 minutes, but I wanted to make sure they were set after I added all of the liquid.  Really, these are quite delicious.  Despite the hassle, I will probably make them again.

This cookie is a phenomenal balance of chocolate and peanut butter!  It has been an instant sensation in my house.  I do press my pretty thin and I've found that you can't cook them too long, unless you want them crispy.  Crispy or soft, they are fantastic, though!  I call them the cookie equivalent of a Reese's peanut butter cup!  The only thing I changed is that the second time I made them I did a cup of peanut butter and a cup of powdered sugar for the centers.  I like peanut butter and found that there wasn't enough.  A cup of each was just about perfect!

I made these cookies over the holidays, and they were a big hit.  How can you go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter?  I did have a little bit of difficulty getting the chocolate to completely cover the peanut butter filling, even after refridgerating, however they still baked up wonderful and were delicious!

Fun and tasty cookie to make. I love serving these and watching people's faces when they see the middle. Impressive for a bake sale...as long as it is labeled as having nuts. Thanks for a fun cookie.

These were REALLY good. And I might be crazy, but I didn't think they were time-consuming or difficult at all. Prep took me about 20 minutes. I did make the filling first and refrigerated it while I made the dough (which I added a T. of milk to). I didn't even have to flour my hands to form the dough "patties". I will definitely make these again.

These were very labor intensive to make. I experimented on the bake time because after the recommended bake time, they didn't look done. Most of my cookies came out dry and crunchy. I would stick to cook time from the recipie, and trust that they will eventually set. The taste was just ok. Not what I expected after having worked so hard. I would probably not make these again.

Don't know how this recipe got 4 1/2 starts. These cookies lack flavor and are too dry. I even added milk like some suggestions and they were still dry. I even thought the peanut butter center should've been a little creamy, but it was also dry. I won't be making these again.

I followed the advice to cut the sugar to 1/3 cup each and added 1 Tbsp milk to the chocolate batter- Perfect! So rich, you can only eat one, but an instant family favorite!

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding one tablespoon of heavy cream to the cookie dough to get it more moist.  I'm sure milk would have worked fine too- I just didn't have any!  I also rolled out the dough to making wrapping the PB balls easier.  And please note- there is no possible way to make 30 1inch balls- I made 27 3/4inch balls.  These were REALLY good and tasted better once they cooled.  I will be making them again next weekend for a cookie exchange at work.

These were just "ok" in my book and def not worth the 2 hours I spent naking them. The chocolate cookie outside is not chocolate tasting at all, I added 1 T Sour cream so they werent dry as others commented. The PB def overpowers the very little chocolate taste...but overall taste like plain old PB cookies which are a lot esier and quicker to make. I would suggest reading the reviews that are low as the all state the cookie part is very bland...I wish I would have done that prior. I even added mini choc chips to the cookie portion and it was still blah...I might try again with a better chocoalte cookie recipe.

Definitely a keeper recipe. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that the chocolate dough was a little dry. Pretty easy to make, although rather time-consuming. My five-year-old helped me make them though and didn't have a problem. I also think that I might experiment with adding a few peanut butter chips to the peanut butter as it really wasn't as rich as I was hoping. Overall though, a great recipe and one that my daughter and I had fun making.

Absolutely amazing!    I used chunky peanut butter so I had to modify this recipes.    Add at the end of the basic recipe.  It will be very dry so add this and use hands to make it soft. Make the recipe like specified and then at end add 1/2 cup extra peanut butter  so there is a total of 3/4 c.  chunky on the base 3 Tablespoons or 1/4 cup of sourcream  For the filling.  Add in 1/4 cup extra of the chunky peanut butter and use electric hand mixer to mix it up.    Roll 30 of 1 inch  filling balls,  and put in fridge.    I made smaller balls and got 35 of them thumb out 30 base covers before assembling.  Once the base is ready, take peanut butter filling balls out of th refrigerator and assemble. Works better this way.  Don't forget to flatten and dip in sugar like sugar cookies.

Just made these tonight! My apartment smells amazing! I'm going to send some to my boyfriend for Christmas.   Definitely chill the peanut butter mixture-even if its just cold it helps. Flatten the cookie part in your palm-if it's not dry it's not difficult to flatten-I didn't even need flour.  Great recipe!

Oh yeah. These are super good. I did add a T of milk to the chocolate dough. I until it was a circle the size on had no problem at all making these. I patted the chocolate balls into my hand until they were just a little smaller than my palm. Then I wrapped up the edges around the peanut butter ball and cinched them. placed them seam side down and did the glass in sugar thing.

These came out pretty good. My favorite part was the peanut butter filling. Soooo good! The outer chocolate cookie seemed a bit bland, but probably because I didn't add the extra sugar when I pressed the cookies down. I might do that next time. Overall, a good recipe for the choco-pb lover! Like a Reese's cup in cookie form.

These cookies could be the best I've ever made!  They are a bit more laborious than traditional drop cookies, but worth it.  I followed the recipe exactly, using butter (I rarely bake with margarine) and I was only able to make 25, leaving 5 peanut butter centers - my kids were happy to help me get rid of them!  I will definitely make these again.

I was really bummed, I thought these looked so good! They were difficult to make and didn't taste very good. I think if I tried again I would try adding things like another egg and some sour cream like some people recommended. They are very dry and you need a drink handy with them!!

Great recipe, however, I did omit the coco because I'm not a chocolate lover, and used 1 tsp baking powder. Rolled in sugar and chopped nuts.

These were delicious with a glass of milk!  Next time I will make a double batch to make the same amount of cookies so they're bigger.  Instead of sugar, I pressed some choc chips on top.  I also followed others' advice by adding a little milk to the chocolate cookie mixture to make it softer.  Definitely DON'T overcook!!  Can't wait to make these again = )

I doubled the recipe and they turned out great.  I followed the recipe as written and had no difficulties with cracking.  Next time, I will try and add mini chocolate chips to the chocolate dough as one reviewer suggested.  Great recipe!!

These cookies are a pain in the butt to make.  But they do taste very good.  I didn't have that much of a problem with getting the cookie dough around the filling.  The batter was kind of like a dry Play-Dough consistency and I agree with the poster who said that the trick to doing it is flattening the dough in your hand and then molding the dough around the filling.  I had no problem at all with the consistency of the filling and I ended up getting exactly 30 out of the recipe, which I followed to a  tee.  They did come out a bit crunchy on the outside, but nice and soft inside.  Not dry as some others have said.  Everyone loved them at the party I took them to.  Hope this helps.

Perfection. I followed the recipe as originally posted, though added 1 Tblsp. sour cream. No problems with the p'butter/ sugar mixture; I just used my electric beater, and then rolled them up, no refrigeration. Simple to fold the p'butter balls into the cookie dough; simply place ball in the center and pinch the top, fold in the ends. Used a mix of powdered cocoa and sugar to flatten. 9 minutes in the oven. My one suggestion? Actually measure the cookie dough by Tablespoon, unless you are an incredibly accurate "eyeballer", it will make a difference when filling and baking. Yes, these were a bit time consuming, but the good things in life usually DO take time! :)

I give this 4 stars for taste but 3 stars for assembly and texture. I made this recipe as is, did not make any changes and was irritated by the time I had to put them in the oven.  The peanut butter filling was so hard to blend with the powdered sugar, I finally had to knead it by hand to mix it.  The chocolate dough was very dry and unlike others I did not read the reviews before making them.  I found the dough to be so dry and crumbly that it did not want to wrap around the cookie without falling apart.  After baking and cooled they were very dry and crumbly and alot broke as I was taking them from the cooling rack to the tupperware container.  I didn't get 30 filling balls as the recipe calls for I believe I only got 22.  I disagree completely with the poter EL on Aug. 11 he/she states that using organic or natural peant butter is more liquidy and had to add more flour, I used the natural peanut butter and it was so hard to mix with the powdered sugar without it flying out of the bowl.  There was nothing moist about either of the doughs.  They were alot of work and a little disappointing.  If I make these next time I will add a little milk to the dough and see how that comes out.

These cookies were surprisingly easy to make..I added a little water as suggested by others and they went together easily..Very proffesional looking cookie. Perfectly round and beautiful. They go a little dry over time but no worries. They don't last long.

These are so yummy! I was a little skeptical at first because I was afraid it would take a while to make, but I decided to give it a shot, and I'm sooo glad I did! They really didnt take all that long and were not hard to make. Mine came out great, 30 cookies exactly. The only change I made was adding 2T of sour cream. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I'll be entering these delicious cookies into our annual county fair tomorrow. I'm feeling first place! :)

10 stars!!! These are delicious little pieces of heaven. I reduced both sugars to 1/3 of a cup and added some mini chocolate chips to the batter. I also used whole wheat flour without any problems. I didn't find the batter to be dry, unlike many other reviewers. I would suggest making sure you're in the mood to make cookies, because these do take a bit of work, but they are well worth it in the end. These are our new favourite cookies.

These were good but not great. I only added half a teaspoon of water to the dough and it was plenty moist. I'm not sure why the recipe called for 30 peanut butter fillings because I started running out of dough. Crunchy peanut butter works too. Taking the advice of the other reviewers, freezing the filling was a good idea. I would however flatten the filling because they were hard to squish after I added the dough. These weren't hard to make and wasn't as time consuming as I anticipated.

These cookies are great! I found the chocolate dough to be a little moist, so I mixed in a small handful of four with about a teaspoon or so of cocoa powder in when I mixed the dough.  Chilling the dough before assembly makes it much, much easier to work with.  I wouldn't recommend organic or natural peanut butter.  These tend to be more "liquid-y" than regular brands, and to make up for it, you have to add more flour, which messes with not only the quantity, but also the flavor.

These are amazingly good, and despite other reviews, I found them really easy to make and not too time-consuming.  I didn't flour my hands when rolling the balls, but I did work quickly, as the butter in the dough will soften from the heat of your hands, making it a bit sticky.  I used Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate cocoa powder and found the chocolate flavor to be just right.  They're pretty hardy cookies--although I think I made mine a litte bigger than the suggested size in the recipe.  I baked mine for 8 minutes, and they came out soft and moist.

some suggestions inspired by others complaints; if the chocolate batter seems too crumbly, add a egg. I did that and the dough handled nicely. Also, to make it faster try this method. I greased my cookie sheet, grabbed a wad of chocolate dough, pressed it down in a circle, placed my (chilled)peanut butter dough ball in the middle, lifted it all off the cookie sheet and let the chocolate dough wrap around the peanut butter-pinching off the excess chocolate dough. From bowl to oven took about 2 minutes, and they turned out great.  I also used all whole wheat flour and that worked great too. =)

These are just OK for me, which is disappointing since Chocolate and Peanut Butter is the best combination known to man, in my opinion.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  I ended up with extra middles and about 26 cookies.  It was too much peanut butter (I know, blashphemy) and not enough of a chocolate flavor.  And SUPER dry - after eating one cookie I immediately needed something to drink.  ::sigh:: the search continues.

excellent! I read through all the reviews first and so with everyone's tips they didn't turn out to be too difficult to make.   I think it's a must to chill the centers before wrapping the dough around them.  I made the centers first and then chilled them while I made the outsides.  Then, when I wrapped them, I floured my hands (turned out to be a bigger help than I expected) and then took a ball of the dough and flattened it in the palm of my hand so it was just hanging over the edges of my palm and that turned out to be just the right size for wrapping around the ball.  I had to re-flour my hand after every other one to be able to wrap effectively. I did not end up with extra middles (but I only ended up with 28 anyway) and even had a little dough left to do touch ups with after flattening. I didn't add any sour cream or water to the dough and thought it turned out perfect.

My oh my!  These babies ROCK!  I did not have any issues with the dough at ALL!  I only ended up with 28 peanut butter balls and ended up with more than enough chocolate dough.  I think I had about 8 extra cookies of just the chocolate dough.  Very easy and the taste is outstanding!  I think I will make more peanut butter filling next time and put more sugar on top.  Outstanding recipe that I will make again and again!  Thank you.

The chocolate was east to work with. I found it good to flatten it with you hands. It wrapped around the peanut butter ball nicely that way.

Loved these. I was looking for a different kind of cookie and this is it! My husband even likes them and he is picky when it comes to sweets. I was low on peanut butter and had to use part margarine and part crisco but they are still fabulous. Cooked for about 9 minutes and are still gooey. I also added about 2 tablespoons milk to the chocolate and used Ghiradelli cocoa which is the best!

These were great!  I was craving a reeses peanut butter cup but since a drive to the store was too much trouble I decided to make these instead.  Fantastic.  I made as directed except for adding a bit more peanut butter ( about 1 tbs) to the inside filling.  I cooked for 8 minutes.  Mine were not dry at all.  They were very moist and delicious.  Most def. cured my reeses craving!  Too rich for everyday but def. a keeper.

I didn't change a thing, and they are very good. But they are too dry for me. I will try adding 1 cup of mini-chocolate chips to the chocolate dough. And a tablespoon milk. Also, I baked for 8 minutes, and I will try 7 next time. But my co-workers raved about them, so even though I thought they were a little too dry, no one else cared.

these cookies taste good but are a pain in the butt to make. i would recommend putting the cookie dough in the freezer for a bit so it is easier to work with. other then the assembly, they taste pretty good!

I did not need to change the recipe at all.  The chocolate dough was plenty moist.  I used my stand mixer to combine the ingredients--maybe that made the difference.

I'm coming to this recipe's defense! Sure they take a little extra time than a normal cookie recipe, but the finished product is worth it. I made the filling first and cut it into thirds. Then I took each third and divided it into ten small balls, and refrigerated while I made the cookie part. I used about 2T of milk because like everyone else has said, they're too dry without it. I also found no need to flour my hands when forming the dough. Finally, when you smash the cookie down with the sugared glass, don't press down too firmly, because you won't get that pretty round shape. Yum and thanks for the recipe.

These are AMAZING!! I put the peanut butter filling in the freezer for about 10 minutes before assembling the cookies, and had no problems. I also added about a tbsp of rice milk to make the chocolate dough to make it more moist. I baked them for only 6 minutes, and they were perfect!!!

I had a hard time working with the dough, it just would not stick together very well. They tasted ok though.

These took a long time to assemble! The taste wasn't too bad but could have been a little sweeter. Not quite the right peanut butter/cocoa balance.

These cookies are AMAZING! Everyone loves them! I have made these a few times and will many more. I chill the chocolate dough and peanut butter for a little while to make it easier (I think) to make them. It takes a little time to form the balls and shape the chocolate dough around them, but it's so worth it! Thank you so much! These are one of a kind and unbelievably good!

A real gem. Honestly, one of the most fun cookies to make ever. And it doesn't hurt one bit that they taste like a small piece of heaven. Or a reese's peanut butter cup. ;) I did cut down to 1/3 cup of both sugars and added 2 tbsp. of milk to make the dough come together a bit more, which is why it comes to a 4 1/2 *. Personally, I think next time I won't cut down the sugar, as I felt it made the chocolate cookie part not sweet enough (although I'm quite the sweet tooth!). My mistake. :) Anyways, a staple from now on. I'll be making these often!

been an allrecipe lurker for a bit now.After making these, I decided it be time to come out of the shadows in DEFENSE of these yummy lil' nuggets of peanutty goodness.I followed others suggestions: chilled peanut butter filling, added sour cream to the chocolate cookie dough, used a mixmaster and combined ingredients very thoroughly,and baked about 6 minutes (I'm a chewy cookie girl). I experimented with sizes and found the smaller cookies tasted more 'reese-sey' than the bigger ones. Didn't find this hard to assemble at all - pretty straightforward.  THX for the recipe. Will definately do this again when I need a sugar hit.

Alot of work, but sooo good. Double the recipe, and freeze the rest. You don't want to do all this work, for all your cookies to be gone before your even finishing baking them.

These are great!  I did have to add a bit more milk to the chocolate dough--I'm not sure how much, probably a tablespoon or two--after it wasn't smoothly wrapping around the peanut butter balls.  But after I remixed with the milk, it worked great!  (The dough should be easily rolled and should not break apart when flattened.)  I shipped these halfway across the country, and they arrived tasty and intact.  As others have noticed, it does take a bit more work than a simple chocolate chip cookie, but not much more, and I think that now that I've made them once, the time difference will be negligible.

I only rated this a 3 star for a few reasons.  First, I didn't think the chocolate cookie itself was all that outstanding.  I think the devils food chocolate cake mix to make the cookies would taste much better.  Also, first, I made 30 balls out of the filling dough.  The balls were too big, but I didn't want to waste the filling dough... so of course, there wasn't enough cookie dough to cover all 30 balls.  My suggestion is this:  Cut the filling portion of this recipe in half... then make 30 balls out of that.  Then make the cookie dough portion the same as what is called for.  Then each ball should be able to be covered.  Possibly double the cookie dough portion.  I will have to try that to be sure.  I am not sure I'll try this again though... It is more time consuming than most cookie recipes, but the outcome would have been worth it if it would have tasted a little better.  I think if I do this again, I will use a devils food chocolate cake mix to make the chocolate cookie part, then just half the middle portion.

Make sure you read the directions--I skipped the part that said to flatten them and ended up with chocolate/pb lumps.  But they were still good.  Didn't quite taste like a reese's, but I am a pb lover so I'll make them again.

Mine came out a little dry even though I followed the recipe.  I even added a little milk as one user suggested.  I highly recommend them--especially with whipped cream on the side.  It adds moisture and makes the cookie even better!  This is a recipe I'll make again!

These cookies were really good.  A nice crunchy chocolate cookies surrounds a creamy, peanut butter middle.  I did have issues with my chocolate dough, and I even added 1 Tbsp milk, but it was still dry, and got worse as I continued to use up the dough.  I also had way more peanut butter middles.  It does take a little bit of time, but don't worry about getting them perfect, because even with these issues these cookies still tasted wonderful.  I'm sure I will be making these again.

Fantastic cookie recipe. Couldn't make enough. I did roll the entire cookie in sugar instead of just using the glass dipped in it. They came out great, very chocolatey and best when still warm and gooey.

Verrrrry difficult to form the dough around the PB and we're experienced at stuff like this!  In fact, it was impossible for it to be done as is.  We had no choice but to add a lot of flour to the chocolate dough before it was a consistency that we could even handle.  After that it was ok, but so not worth the work.  They tasted good, but a little dry, probably due to the extra flour we had to add.  Not sure how else to fix it though.

These were absolutely awesome.  They were really tough to put together though.  I think next time I might try the whole plastic bag piping trick.  The chocolate part wasn't so bad but the peanut butter part got everywhere.

very difficult but once you master getting the chocolate around the peanut butter balls, it's not so hard. Extremely tastey, labor intensive. I attempted to make these with some young friends, it was incredibly hard and they didn't get to take part too much. Disappointing to make, delicious to eat. Worth the effort on a rainy day, or if you're looking to wow the crowd.

I made this recipe just today, but found both the filling and cookie itself crumbly and dry when mixing up the dough. I ended up adding a tablespoon of water to both, which made it a bit easier to work with. Also, I ended up not having enough dough to cover all the peanut butter balls.

Overall, I think the cookies tasted fine, but I wish I had sweetened up the center a little more, as it was sort of bland- or maybe that's just me.

I can't even convey how disappointed I was in these.  AFter all the work that went into them, my cookies tasted pasty and crumbly.  The best part?  Definitely the middle, but the cookie itself was not good.  I was hoping they would turn out decent, but the didn't.  I won't even attempt to make these again.  It was a clear waste of my cookie making time.

These were really good! I followed the recipe exactly, EXCEPT that I used natural peanut butter (it made the PB mixture rather crumbly, so making the balls was a bit of a challenge) and added a tbsp of milk to the cookie mixture, as suggested by others. I didn't run out of cookie dough. I used about a tsp of the peanut butter mixture for each ball. I also kept the balls of PB mixture in the fridge for about two hours. All in all, these were delicious!

I thought the outer, chocolate cookie was too dry and somewhat tasteless.  I even added water to the mix.  After freezing the middles, it wasn't hard to assemble the cookie.

These are fabulous!! Just made them for superbowl sunday!! I did what another reviewer suggested. i rolled the chocolate into balls while the peanutbutter chilled in the fridge.then rolled the peanut butter mix into balls. Used my thumb to make a hole for the peanubutter part. dropped it in  and closed it up . Rolled in sugar before flattening. which make them a bit crispier on the outside. and soft n chewy on the inside. Just Perfect!

Had some off brand PB to use up, forgot the vanilla, and they still turned out crazy good!  Had about 6 PB balls left, the kids didn't mind taking care of that:)  Great concept, next time I will use Jif and put the vanilla in!  thanks

Wow- I just made these and I must say these are some of the yummiest cookies I have ever had. I didn't find it to be difficult- I just followed the suggestions of chilling the PB filling for a couple of hours and also adding some water to the dough. I'm sure I will be asked to make these many times int he future!

These proved to be quite a bit of work and I eventually just shoved the chocolate mixture in a muffin pan and spooned the peanut butter filling into it and baked them.  I'll try them again though, and maybe the right way if I have enough time.

These are wonderful!  I ended up needing to make more chocolate batter (I probably skimped a little on the peanut butter middles - lol) but they still turned out great.  My family loves them!

These cookies are fantastic!  I live in Ohio (the buckeye state), so I have renamed them buckeye cookies to satisfy all the football fans in my life.  I followed the recipe exactly and had a bit too much dough left over, but I was probably too generous with the peanut butter!  I almost didn't make these because I thought it would be a pain shaping the balls and wrapping the dough around them, but it wasn't that difficult at all.  My three year old niece even helped.

These were really good. Had problems with the peanut butter/confectioner's sugar being too crumbly, though, and I never really figured out how to dip a glass in sugar and make the sugar stay on the glass and on the cookies. Will definitely make these again, as I am a peanut butter/chocoholic.

These are time consuming, but if you have the time the effort is definately worth it.  They are a great combo of chocolate and peanut butter and the filling is a great surprise for those trying them for the first time.

I've made these twice.  They're very good but require some fussing.  A lot of work for only 3 dozen cookies.  For that reason, I only make them at Christmastime.

These were good, a little time consuming but not bad.  I would have liked them to have turned out a little moister.  I used a mini muffin tin so they were pretty cute.  The BF said he still liked the "rolo" cookies better.

Very rich!  A previous post said they had trouble they attributed to using natural peanut butter.  I use natural p.b. and had absolutely no problem; I recommend refrigerating the p.b. before using to firm it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were a pain to make: peanut butter balls were sticky to make and the outer dough was dry so had  a hard time.  The taste ultimately was pretty good but not worth the effort.

Overall, this is a pretty good cookie recipe. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that I felt that the cookies could have been a bit more moist. I didn't really have a problem with the 'construction' of the cookie dough balls, but I did notice that as I got closer to the end of the bowl, the dough did get a bit dry, maybe some more peanut butter would have helped?

Awesome taste! Make sure you refrigerate the peanut butter mixture to make for easier rolling. I had a hard time keeping the cookie size consistent - some were bigger some were smaller. The cookies are disappearing so fast I have to make another batch!

These were not easy to make. The peanut butter mixture was very sticky, I suggest using flour on hands to make the balls. The chocolate mixture was not easy to wrap around the peanut butter - and the amount of cookies it states it makes is 15, however, if you make only 15 they will be HUGE! I made 30 peanut butter balls and wrapped them exactly with no chocolate left. They are a little bitter, and I suggest not eating them right after them come out of the oven. They are the best after completley cooled.

Awesome, time consuming, but well worth the effort, these are staying n my christmas cookie batch from now on!  I scoop and freeze the middles, then wear gloves when wrapping them in the chocolate to keep the middles from melting, but definitely worth the time.

Oh my, these were so yummy!  I made them the other night, they were gone in a couple of days..  I ate most of them :)  I must have made mine pretty big because I only got about a dozen cookies made before the chocolate mixture was gone.. Probably better that way!  I think making the cookie part bigger made them come out better over all..

I made some of these, and my friend loved em. He kept asking me if i had more. XD It was pretty easy after you made the filling and dough. The dough wasnt crumbly for me. A 1 inch ball of filling is pretty big. I made about 1/2 inch balls. To wrap the dough around it, its easier to make a filling ball, flatten the dough, then wrap it around. Baking time took me 10 minutes.

Very tasty!
Only problem was the filling was really crumbly and wouldn't mix very well.
I had some left over filling too.
Tastes good with a nice glass of milk :-]

Not my favorite cookie by far. I followed everyone's advice and had no problem putting it together, but the cookie itself was not as soft and chewy as I would have liked. Probabbly will not make again.

My first attempt was a lackluster affair. ALmond butter was NOT the way to go and it just didn't work out well. But my second batch was better. 
I chilled the dough and that made the peanut butter middles easier to work with. However, I recommend NOT chilling the chocolate part on the outside. I read all the other reviews and am still struggling with the wrapping of the dough on the outside but it's still a darn good cookie and worth the work.
What has sort of worked for me with the chocolate outside was rolling it until it was soft in my hand, then I pressed it flat and folded or mushed it around the peanut butter middle. Then I would roll the whole thing into a ball again.
I pressed it flat without using a glass dipped in sugar, and it cracked around the edges.
Don't cook any longer than needed (it becomes a dull bland dry cookie if you do)
But regardless, this is a great improvement from my first attempt.

Yes, these are time consuming but they are SOOOO worth it. I make a LOT of Christmas cookies and these are always the most requested! After you've made them a few times it gets easier, too, to wrap the chocolate dough. I've never altered the recipe a bit, either, and they turn out GREAT! Do NOT over cook them, though...for the best results they should definitely be on the soft side when you take them out of the oven. Give them a minute or two to sit on the counter and cool before you try to take them off, and they should have hardened sufficiently! Enjoy these... we always do!

Pretty good- the chocolate part wasn't as good as I expected, but a good cookie overall.  It was hard to cover the pb well enough, so I ended up with 5 extra pb balls.  But the cookies didn't crack so much as to give away the surprise, and it made a few more than the recipe said.

These are truly delicious. The chocolate dough was a little on the crumbly side, so I added 3 heaped tablespoons of sour cream. I shaped them by hand and the result was beautiful. They didn't crack during baking, so the peanut butter filling truly was a surprise. Thank you for this recipe.

VERY yummy cookies. Made them last night because all 3 of us are peanut butter and chocolate freaks. The only thing i was hoping for was a bit softer cookie. I suppose i could take them out of the oven a few minutes early next time. Grab a huge glass of cold milk for these because you will have a very hard time stopping. I made the filling and rolled it prior to the chocolate cookie and put them on a cookie sheet and in the fridge while i made the chocolate. I then refrigerated the chocolate cookie dough as well. I found it very sticky and this seemed to help ALOT. i'm sure i will make again.

These were a lot of trouble. The dough cracked around the edges of all of the cookies when I flattened them with the sugared glass, and my chocolate (outer) dough required water (several Tbsp) to get it to hold together enough to work with.  Nevertheless, they are soo tasty and still soft the next day.  I think I'll make them again and maybe use a slightly different chocolate dough recipe for the outsides to get a more attractive, easier-to-work-with cookie.

Delicious even though a bit time consuming. The next time I make these I'll chill the filling and cookie dough before attempting to shape and that will hopefully cut down on the time.

Nice cookies! I didn't have peanut butter in hand, so I followed the recipe all the way through except I wrapped the dough around marshmallows and caramel candies. They turned out great! Next time I would definitely try peanut butter. After all, peanut butter is the essence of this recipe!

These are really yummy, but you must have a lot of patience for this recipe!  My chocolate dough was very crumbly and kept cracking when I tried to wrap it around the peanut butter part.  As a result, a lot of my cookies are pretty funny-looking.  I was expecting them to be time-consuming, but I was annoyed that the dough didn't wrap very well around the PB part.  My 2 and 4-year old had a blast rolling the PB balls though!  All in all, these are very tasty cookies and I'm glad I made these.

These cookies are very good, but I'm a little afraid I will be asked to make them again!  They are alot of work.  Also, I doubled the batch and only got 48 cookies, but maybe mine were bigger than they were supposed to be.  Great recipe if you have lots of time and energy.

Great recipe! Though I used chunky peanut butter instead so the filling didn't really oozes out from the cookie. It changed the texture of the cookie a little bit. I wanted to have small bits of peanuts in the cookies, that's why I used Chunky PB instead. Maybe next time I'll use the chunky one to mix with the flour and the cream one for the filling. Will make these again :-)

I had no idea what a big mess these would be, but as the last reviewer said, they are well worth it.  These cookies are so rich and decadent.  The soft Peanut Butter middle just melts in your mouth.  I love the chocolate cookie with the peanut butter.  The whole family says, WOW!

Mine turned out not that bad, for a beginner like me. However, would like to ask if the inside of the cookie (NOT the peanut buttter) is supposed to be crunchy or cake-like? I had the assumption that the entire cookie part (both inside and outside) would be crispy. However, for my cookies, it was more like slightly crispy on the outside, and soft and cake-like on the inside (cookie part). Is it supposed to be like that? I'm quite confused....hence I'm not too sure if what I've baked can be considered a success, or failure?

Wonderfully sinful cookie! It's quite labor intensive because there are two parts of the cookie to consider separately: the PB filling and chocolate cookie crust. But the result is so worth it; crunchy on the outside and so creamy and luscious inside. This cookie is pure heaven in a bite for chocolate and PB lovers!

Very good.  I found both the filling and the cookie dough were a bit dry and hard to work with, though.  Perhaps this is because I used chunky peanut butter (though I'm surprised it would make so big a difference) - try 1 whole cup of P.B. for the filling if you use chunky.  They tasted great, especially warm when the filling oozes out.  If you have the patience, measure 30 even balls of the cookie dough as well as of the filling - that way you won't end up with too little dough at the end.  I did get 30 cookies out of this, and I usually get way less than a recipe says I should.  All eaten up between a party and family.

My grandma & I made these a few years ago, and they're so good!  My grandma is gone now, but I make these often as they bring back great memories.

Very Gooooood!!  My husband didn't like them but he don't like peanut butter, so you know there's something wrong with him.  I ended up with a lot of extra cookie mix and not enough filling.  I guess I should try to be more exact.

These were, by far, some of the best cookies I have ever made!!  They took a good bit of time and effort, but were absolutely delicious!  These would make great Christmas presents for friends/family.  Am going to be sure and share these so that others know how good they are.  Thanks, Stephanie!

Incredible.  What a great tasting cookie, I love this.  I recently purchased cookies exactly like this at a local farmers market that my boyfriend raved about.  Now I can make them for him year-round!  Oh- I used chunky peanut butter and it worked out just as well.

These cookies AMAZING!!!  I was wrapping them to bring some to work and my husband said, "NO! Not all of them!!"  When I brought them to work everyone raved and someone actually offered to pay me to make some more!

My husband says 'These would be the best cookies in the universe if they were softer'.  That's my fault though - I didn't think they looked done after 9 minutes and cooked for 12 minutes instead.  Next time I will stick with the 9 minute cooking time and they will be softer.
Very easy to make with my 6 year old daughter, she loved rolling the batter into little balls!
All around great cookies!!

These were too much work and I can't say they are all that great.  They taste like regular peanut butter cookies, so why not just make THEM? My kids loved them, but I'm not a fan.

I am so excited to have found this recipe again!  After baking these cookies last christmas and falling in love with the taste, I missplaced the recipe.  I am so happy to have found it again here.

These cookies are delicious!  I just took them out of the oven and my husband has already eaten 4.  I will definitely make these again.
