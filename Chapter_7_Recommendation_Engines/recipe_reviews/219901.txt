I used this dressing for a mixed greens salad. I made one change to cut the fat down in this recipe--I used half nonfat greek yogurt in place of the mayonnaise. The mayonnaise I used in this recipe was reduced fat. I made no other changes. This is a good base recipe. Letting it sit is key so that the blue cheese has time to really infuse the mayonnaise/buttermilk. The consistancy is perfect but I think it needs a little more oomph. Maybe some green onion or fresh chopped chives. I'll use this dressing recipe again but I'll play with it a little.

Definitely a simple recipe, but it does lack a little something.... And, it doesn't need to set overnight. This is an easy fix and really it's nothing complicated. I was using this for our homemade buffalo wings so I wanted a thicker dressing.  I cut back the buttermilk to approx. 3/4 cup and used half mayo and half sour cream.  I eyeballed the garlic powder to taste and added a pinch or two of sugar, a dash of salt and a splash of white wine vinegar. I blended that together and let it set in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Overall, it was thick and creamy - perfect for dipping wings and celery!

I make a dressing a bit like this and it is great. The differences are I used fresh, very finely chopped garlic (start small and add as needed) instead of powder, add dried or fresh parsley, add some lemon juice and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I also usually use half lite mayo and half light sour cream instead of all mayo, but if I don't have sc on hand, the mayo alone will do. 
I think the tweaks will add the oomph that was mentioned as missing by others. I got this from a recipe book years ago but eyeball it now since it is one of my fave recipes. It makes a great hostess gift in a pretty bottle with crudites or alongside my hubby's famous wings. This can also be made with gorgonzola instead of blue cheese if you prefer or if that is what is on hand. Enjoy!

This is OK - it will be as good as your blue cheese is.  It could use a little depth of flavor.    Easy for sure.  Just not knock your socks off.

I worked with an older Greek chef and this resembles his which was great. He used these ingredients plus sugar, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and a dash of Tabasco.

I upped the buttermilk and lowered the mayo to achieve the balance I wanted. I like the tanginess.

l love that it is lower in calories than the bottled stuff, and it tastes much better  I used olive oil mayo to cut the cholesterol.   I didn't use all of mine right away, and after being in the fridge overnight it was very thin.  Next time I will use nonfat Greek yogurt or a light sour cream to give it a bit more body.

I made a few changes used half sour cream and mayo. Added buttermilk a little at a time till right texture. Added 6 oz blue cheese instead of 4 oz. also added fresh ground pepper about 1/4 tsp. Great on salad also made another time and used for dipping spicy chicken strips.
