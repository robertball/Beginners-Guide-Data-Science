both my boyfriend and i thought these were so so sooo good! i was afraid at first that the mixture was too gloppy, but i plopped it by the spoonful on the baking sheet and they came out great. i didn't have any red chilies so i used a few pinches of crushed chili flakes. also, i made the patties early in the day and just let them sit. hours later i warmed them on our george foreman grill. this is a super easy and yummy recipe that we'll definitely make again and again.

These were good - but you need to add and egg and some bread crumbs or oatmeal as a binder. We liked them a lot - I made the patties into rectangles because my wraps are rectangular shape. I spread some chummus on the wrap, placed the garbanzo bean burgers on top and added some slaw and some spinach leaves. It was really good - but I prefer the Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers from this site. This is a nice variation.

Very easy and good! I added diced white onion to the mix as well as cumin and garlic salt. I added just a very little olive oil, but maybe I should have put in a bit more because the patties fell apart easily.

These were respectable. I would definitely add something for a binder. They fell apart really easily. We put these in pita, with a raita sauce, spinach, tomatos, banana peppers, klamata olives and feta. Super yummy. They turned out a little spicy for my kids, so next time I'll forgo the chilis.

nice flavour but they aren't really burgers, I tried adding some binding to the second batch, and still they were mush.  But nice flavour.

This does need a binder, some breadcrumbs, and more seasonings (I added garlic, lemon pepper, and oregano).  Making those changes turns it into a five star burger, making the recipe as-is results in a four star filling for pita bread, topped with greek yogurt sauce.

Really tasty. However, the nutrition information is wrong. It is impossible for a 1/4 of a can of garbanzo beans to be 56 cals, never mind adding other things in. I have a feeling that it should be 156 - I added it up and came close to about 150 calories per serving. BUT it is a super tasty meal. Vegan, healthy and scrumptious wins for me. Will definitely make it again =]

I used green instead of red pepper.  I just sprayed my pan, and cooked well on both sides.  These were a tasty way to enjoy garbanzo beans!

I had a hard time with these. I followed instructions, although instead of carrot added some chopped onion I wanted to use up. Also had a jalapeno instead of red chile pepper. I should have listened to the other reviews regarding adding an egg and breadcrumbs...these totally fell apart. After baking them the 20 minutes, I tried to flip them as instructed and they were complete mush. I broiled them for a few minutes then tried again. I had two of them that only cracked in half, but the rest were in pieces. The taste was alright, but texture was off. They were somewhat salvaged with a sour cream/cilantro/lime juice topping, but I don't think I'll be making them again. Just didn't suit my tastes, I guess. Sorry, but thanks for sharing anyway.

Good, but I have to agree this needs more binders.  I added breadcrumbs, but it probably needs egg as well.  It bakes up okay, but I had trouble sliding the burgers off of my silpat mat, something that rarely happens.  I also tried frying three other burgers while the rest were baking, and they fried up okay, but they crumble and break apart easily.  So definitely more stuff to bind, and a little more seasoning would make these even better.  Bf didn't like these; he just called them "awful falafels" (he doesn't like falafels, in case you cant' tell!), but I like falafels and I agree these are somewhat similar.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe but it could be even better with the addition of some spices and onion. I also added 1 egg and some bread crumbs. I will definitely make this again, but I will try adding more flavors.

Since I don't have a food processor I cooked down the garbanzo beans(not drained) with garlic, half an onion, half a red pepper 1 carrot, salt and pepper. I grated all the ingredients Except beans. Left out the hot stuff for the little one. After about 10 minutes of cooking I cut off heat, added tahini paste and cumin since I had no cilantro And hand mashed. Chilled in fridge until ready and followed the rest of the directions As written. Definitely needs some kind of binder, the Pattys fell apart when I tried to flip them. But still Yum!

I made these and I used a few different ingredients.  I also cooked them on a flat grill and they turned out alot better than baking them. This is a great recipe that's versatile and relatively easy. Plus I worked at the Nebraska heart hospital and it's a healthy version. The nurses, doctors and hospital staff loved it as well.

These were fabulous, however the recipe did require some tweaking. First, my additions: 1 tsp ground cumin before processing then 1/4 cup dry breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup unsalted sunflower seeds folded into the mixture. I then seasoned to taste with salt and pepper.  Second, the cooking took much longer: 30 minutes on one side then 15 minutes after flipping. The patties were still moist and had a nice lightly crisp exterior. I served on a bed of bitter greens topped with a chipotle mayo/ yoghurt sauce and a beet, carrot, cabbage slaw. This veggie patty is now part of my repertoire.

Wow! So impressed! I am a red meat gal...like 80/20 burger gal but I'm turning over a new health leaf and so have been branching out and wanted to give these a whirl. I was sold when I saw the additions to the actual beans, it is full of flavor and makes you want another bite! I did add some plain bread crumbs to mine to help bind. I also just cooked mine on the stove with a bit of olive oil. They were still rather hard to keep formed and did smash out of the bun but still super good! I mixed some sriracha and mayo and used that as my topping, but I could see that if someone wanted to forego the bun or sauce these would allow that.

Pretty good! We didn't have Tahini on hand and the stores around us don't carry it, so I skipped that and the chile pepper (not a fan of spicy). I enjoyed it though, easy to throw together and (fairly) quick to make.

I don't like peppers and didn't have any on hand, but I added an avocado and left the rest as is. It was good, and was moist enough to stick together while cooking. I think I overdid it on the garlic though, I'll be adding less next time.  I tried using a sandwich grill, frying, and baking, and I actually liked it baked the best.

I tried to fry these, but they were very wet.  The flavor was OK.  I think I will bread them with cornmeal and try baking them for dinner (I only ended up cooking 1)

I made a major change. After following the recipe and baking, I found the patties very crumbly. I then put them in a bowl and started over making the patties after I folded in two beaten eggs. That solved the problem and I was happy with the results.

This recipe, as it stands, fell really flat for me. Or mushy, I should say. It definitely needs a binder to make it a patty. I made it according to the directions here last night, and the patties never firmed up enough to even flip them over. We ended up turning the oven way up after 30 minutes, and then even broiling them, just to make them hard enough to get on a spatula. Then they started falling into pieces. Good flavors though, so we'll try again mixing in breadcrumbs and egg.

Will add egg or bread crumbs next time. Good flavor, but the patties don't congeal without help.

We made these for dinner tonight and made some changes due to reading the reviews. My recipe came out too juicy so I added an extra tablespoon tahini paste, love that stuff, and approx. 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs and it came out just perfect. It was firm enough and sticky enough to hold together for patties. They stuck together well and never fell apart. Forgot about the chili but next time I will add hot sauce since we can't seem to tolerate the real chili pepper. They were delicious!

SO SIMPLE! I didn't have tahini paste, carrots, bell peppers, or chili peppers in my kitchen, but these turned out great. I feel like you could add different spices etc. to the mixture too. I do not own a food processor, but I was able to roll out the ingredients together on a cookie sheet, it bonded pretty well. I served them in a lettuce leaf "bun" with some vegan cheese.

This was tasty but they didn't hold together at all.  They disintegrated when I flipped them.  I scooped them back together again and then when they came out again reshaped once more.  I topped them with cheese slices, which helped.  Once they cooled a bit I was able to spatula them onto a bun.  Tasty, just need some more "glue".  My toddlers ate them, too- bonus!

I thought they were decent, along with my mother & father in law but my husband & kids thought it was awful!
