This definitely is just as the submitter states "warm, sweet, and lusciously filling"!  I love the combination of flavors and it's a great way to use up that last little banana - lol. I did opt to do a microwave version of this to cut back on time and to add a little protein I added a dollup of almond butter over top! Perfect with a glass of OJ!

This can also be made with cow's milk and be cooked in the microwave. Just combine the ingredients and cook in the microwave for four minutes. Let it sit a minute or two and thicken. Most of the time, I use a ripe banana because it makes it sweeter and then I can omit the honey or any other additional sweetener. This is one of my most favorite breakfasts.

This oatmeal was super yummy and filling.  It is also the first time I tried almond milk (yum).  I reduced the almond extract to 1/4 tsp. and that was just right I thought.

My two year old and I love this oatmeal recipe - she asks for MORE(!!!).  We always seem to have an overripe banana laying around, and this is a great way to use it.  This oatmeal is warm, delicious and easy.  I've found the almond extract is a bit much, so have cut back on that but otherwise make as is (with cow's milk though) and add in almond butter at the end for extra protein and creaminess.

I made it with steel cut oats and used vanilla extract instead of almond because I didn't have any almond extract. It was very good. Both my husband and I liked it and will make it again for a larger crowd. With the steel cut oats, you have to cook it longer, but good flavor and a little more healthy.

I used vanilla extract and cut it in half and still feel like it was way too much extract. The texture was great and flavor was good. Next time I would omit the extract or reduce it to a dash.

I made it with Fairlife skim milk (the BEST skim milk on the planet!) and vanilla extract in place of almond. My kitchen smelled marvelous while it was cooking and it tastes great! I will try this again with other fruity substitutions.

Made as is. Pretty good. A bit too much almond extract for me. Next time will use 1/2 tsp instead

I will preface my review by saying I did make changes. I felt that, as written, this was too much for one person for breakfast. As much as I would love to try almond milk, I can't justify the expense of it.  I was also out of honey and almond extract. So, I scaled the oats back to 1/4 cup. I used 1/3 cup 1% milk and 1/4 cup water to cook the oats in. And for sweetener I used 1 3/4 tsp 100% maple syrup, 3/4 tsp Truvia, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I kept everything else the same. This tastes very good, and I will make again. I'll be sure to try it with honey and almond extract when I get some in the house.

Delicious and easy. I made it without the almonds since I am allergic but it was awesome! Boyfriend loved it too. I will definitely be making this again.

Same ingredients (minus the honey) prepared in a microwaveable bowl: 1/2 cup old fashioned oatmeal, 3/4 cup water, 1/2 tsp. of each, whatever spice(s) and whatever extract I am in the mood for (usually vanilla or almond). Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Remove and stir in  3/4 cup of unsweetened almond milk and a couple of packets of Truvia. Banana slices on the top. A deliciously filling WW friendly 5 point breakfast!

I was looking for a hot oats equivalent for my morning oats that I typically eat and this was the closest I could find. No regrets! I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk to tone down the sugar and added in ginger and ground cloves. Also, instead of using almond abstract I used a tablespoon of creamy natural peanut butter which gave it the perfect nutty flavor to compliment the banana.

The reason I chose this recipe was again to use up my Almond Milk before it goes bad.  The first thing against me was my banana was green.  The second thing, I did not have enough Almond Extract, but reading the reviews this might have been a good thing...  I will let you know how it turns out...

way too much almond extract.. It gave the banana an artificial flavor.
Also, i didn't enjoy the cinnamon with the banana either..

I always make oatmeal for my daughter and myself, but we just couldn't eat this. 

i might try it again, minus the cinnamon and almond extract.

There was something about this oatmeal I just really didnt care for.I think it was the almond milk. Although, I use it in smoothies all the time, just never really cook with it. Only change was using vanilla extract. With the calories I shared the recipe and topped with some milk to mild the taste.
