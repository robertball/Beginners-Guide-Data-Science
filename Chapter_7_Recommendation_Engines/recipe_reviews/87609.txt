I gave this recipe five stars because Muddy Buddies the way they're meant to be are five stars, hands down.  But I must give this warning: the recipe says to use any variety of Chex, but I do not recommend using Wheat Chex.  I tried Wheat in an effort to offer something healthy to the snack and they did not turn out nearly as well.  They were super crunchy and frankly just tasted too healthy.  I will ONLY use Rice Chex from here on out.

HELPFUL TIPS IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME: 1st, someone mentioned doubling the chocolate and peanut butter because there wasn't enough to coat the 9C.  I got worried since I always like to overcoat, but so thankful I didn't automatically double the ingredients.  My sweet tooth would have decayed!!!!! The amount listed is PERFECT if not a tad on the heavy side.  Try it the way it's stated first before adding more.  Trust me!!  2nd, something I DIDN'T see mentioned is, you only need 1 box.  While most people probably knew this ...I didn't, and bought 2 boxes.  Which of course didn't go to waste since this is so good, but my husband prefers sweet & salty over chocolate, so I had to make him a batch of Cinnamon-Apple ChexÂ® Mix on this site with that second box!  Both are out of this world!  ...and last, I got worried this would be a gooey mess after I mixed in the powdered sugar, but it hardened just perfectly when left on wax/parchment paper for awhile.  No powdered sugar on my fingers when I ate them! ...although my husband says I eat them so fast that I wouldn't notice even if there was any! hehe

This stuff is awesome! When CHEX came out with their Chocolate-Peanut Butter CHEX-Mix, I thought of this recipe imediately. One week later I combined Muddy-Buddies with honey roasted peanuts, peanut butter M&M's, and tiny pretzels, and made my own Chocolate-Peanut Butter CHEX-Mix. Yummy!

Great recipe, very sweet and very addicting!  These are great for parties.  A variation I made was using white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and it was just as delicious.  I think you could probably even add reece's pieces, or m&m's to the mix.

Can't go work with this recipe

I couldn't find this recipe under the search function. I finally found it under one of the top reviewers. It's delicious! I didn't have enough powdered sugar but it still worked!

Absolutely love this stuff.  It is way to addicting to make just because...you do need a special occasion or you will eat the whole batch in one day (like I did).  Delicious...thanks for the post.

This recipe is wonderful.  It's great to put in candy bags at Christmas and give as gifts to teachers and friends.  My 5 year old calls it "reindeer food" and we leave some out for Santa's reindeers every year on Christmas Eve.

First of all, I don't think we have Chex here in Canada, so I subbed quaker corn bran cereal because it looked kinda the same.  I thought that 1&1/2 cups powdered sugar sounded like a lot, so after coating the cereal, I spread it out on the wax paper to harden up a bit before scooping it into a bag and then tossing it with sugar...doing it this way, I only needed about 1 cup of sugar.  Overall, a good snack, but I was hoping for a stronger peanut/ chocolate taste, maybe next time I will use more peanut butter and leave out the margarine.

Quick suggestion we found is easier than shaking or stirring in the powdered sugar...we put the mix into our salad spinner, and add powdered sugar.  Spin away (and shake a couple of times).  All the mixture gets covered in sugar, and the excess sugar stays in the bowl.

This is best snack ever!!! Instead of regular nestle chocolate chips tho, ive switched to Ghirardelli chocolate 60% cacao kind. They found with all the other chocolate chips in stores, theyre so good! I was on this all natural foods health kick and found em. I also mix all the chex's varieties, mainly the wheat, corn, and honey toasted varieties. I also have realized you cant seal them in a bag or container until they are completely dried or they get stale feeling to eat.

Yummy!  Just a couple of pointers - 1) Don't use Chocolate Chex, it makes it too sweet.  2) It requires A LOT more powdered sugar to coat it than it calls for.  3) Add a cup of salted peanuts to balance out the sweet.  Crowd pleaser!

Yummy! Just how I remembered from Home Ec. class 19 years ago.  (I just sat here for a good 2 minutes rechecking my math and even opened "calculator", I didn't think it had been that long but it has and even longer than my first guess.  Ugh.)

These are super easy and yummy!!! I just made them for the first time but instead of Chex, I used Crispex...Chex has preservatives in it that my kids can't have but the large box of Crispex doesn't. These are delicious and my kids can eat them wherever we go for a great snack!

Awesome Treat! We know this recipe as Monkey Munch!  Which is fitting, as it is inhaled by three monkeys that live in my house, cleverly disguised as my kids.

So easy!!! I almost see no point in writing a review at all. All of the reviews are pretty much the same. They all say this is AWESOME!!! >>>>>>I added a half of cup of coconut to the powdered sugar before I shook it all up. It was a nice addition. I did not shake it in a bag. I had a mixing bowl that has a lid and used that to shake it all together.

Super duper easy, although I microwaved chocolate and peanut butter mixture a little longer until it rendered smooth.  Be sure you use a big enough bowl!   Made so much that I gave half of it to my neighbors and they ate them all up!

I only make this treat at Christmas, but it is always loved by all! The amount of chocolate and peanut butter is perfect, but you have to mix it, mix it more then mix it again to make sure that every piece is coated before putting it in a gallon size ziploc bag with the powdered sugar! Definitely don't use wheat chex for this recipe since it gets hard and the texture is weird. I love all Chex mix recipes!

I had this once years ago and LOVED it and was excited to find the recipe!  Best advice from here - do it all in a bag.  I could have saved a lot of dishes!  I used about 1.5 the chocolate mixture and more powdered sugar.  I doubled the recipe but 1 batch (off the cereal box - 9 cups) makes quite a bit!  I have no doubt it will all disappear!  It's awesome!!!!

Super easy.  I thought they were just right in the sweetness.  (I used the wheat).   I made them for my Brownie Troop.  I will see how they like them. :)

YUM is all i can say with this! I was wanting something like this for a while..... I made it. Unfortunately, I started getting indigestion after eating this. BUT, I could NOT get enough of it, regardless of my indigestion. A week later, I made another batch for a gathering. AGAIN, I got indigestion from it. I realized it was the peanut butter that was doing it. I also come to find out, I was PREGNANT which was what was causing my awful indigestion, NOT this wonderful treat! LOL

I used Cascadian Farms Chex-like cereal. It only measured about 6.5 cups however, so I only did 2/3 of the other ingredients. I also substituted Sunbutter (sunflower butter) for the PB because my little girl has a peanut allergy. I also melted everything on the stovetop instead of in the microwave because I don't use a microwave. This recipe turned out fabulous! Everyone loved it!

I'm eating these while I rate...AMAZING!!! People like me have dieting problems because of recipes like this!!! (thanks!) When I was making it, I was nervous because it didn't look like enough to fully coat the Chex. Wrong! Turned out fully coated with layers of chocolate and peanut butter delight, crunchy and delicious, my taste buds love this stuff! Thank you!

Seriously? I don't think there is a more addictive dessert out there. I had this by a friend and I almost ate the whole bowl. I have a batch in the fridge now and I take a piece whenever I open the door - which is often because I'm baking lasagna!! Why, Muddy Buddies - why do you have to be soooo delicious?!? (PS I used Crispix because the store didn't have Chex - it's just as good.)

5 PLUS PLUS! This was very easy to follow and to prepare. I bought a 14.25 ounce box of the chocolate chex mix which was plently (so more like 7 cups) This amount gave an extra coating if you like it this way, for me it was wonderful. I didn't have much luck with the zip lock as the mix all stuck together so I ended up doing a gentle toss to coat evenly with the powdered sugar. They are just wonderul, did I say that already? :) Thanks for sharing!

FYI: you can half this recipe and use reduced fat peanut butter, and smart balance light in place of margarine, and it is still delicious! i used one cup wheat chex and the rest was generic rice chex. very good, husband likes it too...

These are very good the way they are, but if you add an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter and a 1/2 a cup of chocolate they are outstanding!

I chose this to make as a snack for Thanksgiving Day. My mom made it but doubled the "mix in" ingredients minus the butter and used the powdered sugar as needed. We also used one whole box. I definately think the extra chocolate and PB made this taste excellent! This made huge chunks here and there after chilling and was by far the best batch i've ever tasted - Way to go Mah! I will be making this as often as my thighs and butt let me!

This is the most addictive snack!!  I use crunchy peanut butter and always use extra...it gives the chex an extra thick coating and gives it a stonger peanut butter flavor.  So good!

My mom used to make this all the time around Christmas and we called it Reindeer Food. She'd make a ton of it and I'd take it in to school. It's one of my favorites. Definately saving this to get my kids in on it.

Extremely, I repeat, EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!  :)  If you're following any type of weight management program, just make allowances for how much you'll want to keep nibbling your way through to the bottom of the container!  Great recipe, even though it is incredibly addicting.  Followed recipe to a T and it came out just as described.  No dinner for me tonight. :(  LOL

This snack is soooooooo addicting!! I made it for a 4th of July party and when I told people what it was for some reason they were skeptical about how it would taste. And then they tried it and couldn't stop eating it. My mom used to make this when I was young and I was so excited when I rediscovered the recipe on this site. I had forgotten all about it. Warning: I don't recommend you make this unless there are several people around to eat it because you could very easily eat the entire batch yourself.  :-)

This is amazing. Seriously. And it's so easy to make. Don't bother with the butter and vanilla, you just waste time putting them in. If you're craving this and all you have is corn flakes or rice crispies, those work too!

Honestly, this is a 5 minute recipe, which is a phenomenal crowd pleaser.  It's a great thing to bring to something like a picnic, or a football game gathering, and it takes no time to make.   Just don't eat one, because you'll suddenly have an empty bowl staring back at you.

These were real easy and the kids loved them. Mine stuck together pretty bad though and the powdered sugar just absorbed in, more like frosting then dry like in the picture. If I make again, and I'm sure I will, I might try a different kind of Chex other then Wheat. I'm thinking the other kinds aren't as firm a crunch. It was still a hit with adults and children alike.

Wow! These are so addicting! A friend brought them on a retreat as a snack to share-they were delicious, and now I will be making lots myself! These are a totally easy and delicious blending of peanut butter and chocolate, but you might want to go light on the powdered sugar. I just kind of did it to taste. But, overall, these little snacks are just so good!

Excellent. I changed it up a bit: used butterscotch instead of chocolate chips, and added pretzels and salted peanuts to add a little saltiness to the mix. Just add a bit more of the mixture and powdered sugar and it covers the extra ingredients. I handed out portions to people in the office and got rave reviews. Quick, easy, delicious - excellent for the holidays!!

My mom would always make this for us as kids for special occasions! Im so glad its becoming popular again. Its really easy to make the night before a holiday party. It feeds many and a great way to use up Chex when they are on sale, our store usually will sell 3 boxes for like $5! So its a great inexpensive treat that everyone will love.     I have also tried adding a little bit of crunchy peanut butter to the chocolate for a little flavor change! soo delish!

This is my families favorite snack! This is the recipe I always use, the only thing I do different is add more powdered sugar. The 1 1/2 cups doesn't coat the 9 cups of cereal, so I just add sugar until I'm happy with how it's coated. Enjoy!!

This was the best recipe..very inexpensive to make. Made it both for my daughter's classes added some colorful marshmellows and M&M's to the bunch to give it more volume (I had 60 bags to make) and it came out wonderful.Put about a 1/4 c in each treat bag. The children loved them.

Like most of the reiviews WONDERFUL! EASY..Kids loved em, husband, loved em. Tried it with butterscotch chips but not nearly as good. The chocolate melts better and has a better coverage. Have made twice in a week.

Always a huge hit at parties, but...There is not enough chocolate/peanut butter mixture to cover 9 cups of cereal. Next time I will do one bag of chips and one cup of pb. I was also not thrilled with the texture of the Wheat Chex. It tasted stale. I will use another variety of Chex or Crispex next time.

I make this all the time. It is super easy and super delicious! If the recipe is too sweet, use bittersweet chocolate chips instead, it gives it a little more kick.

Quick, easy, great crunch & inexpensive.  Be aware that these are VERY sweet & addictive.  One (12.8oz) box is a little more than 9 cups.  They taste great right out of the freezer!  Good recipe to have around for the holidays!  Thanks!

This is so easy and everyone always loves it. I like to substitute Kix for a cup or two of the Chex to give it a more puppy food look. Good either way.

I have made this for years. We also called it Puppy Chow. Before 2 gal bags came out. I used a large paper bag from the grocery store. Closed the bag and shook it. This is one of my favorite recipes for the holidays.

I love "Puppy Chow" is what we call it, although Muddy Buddies, sounds better. When I was in High school, I was making this with a friend & we made a mistake & put in Mint Chocolate chips & it was AWESOME....So for all you mint lovers try it! All mint is a little to strong, so I make it now with half mint & half milk chocolate & it's OH SO YUMMY!

I'm not sure I've met anyone who doesn't love "puppy chow"! I'm not as into the flavor as a lot of other people, but once I get started, I can't stop. You can't resist a dish that's so easily prepared anyway.

When we made this when I was younger, we called it Puppy Chow! (And you will find very similar recipes under that name.) I looked this recipe up because I LOVED it as a child, and wanted to make it for my daughter. Still as good as ever! My only comment, I was just shy of a cup of chocolate chips, so I added some pieces from a gourmet milk chocolate bar that costs an obscene amount per ounce. Learn from my mistake: it does NOT taste any better. Save the gourmet chocolate for eating. ;)

My chocolate mixture never reached the desired smoothness.  I'm not sure if it was the heat of my microwave or something else.  I tried it again on the stove, and it worked a lot better.  Make sure to only use the 1 cup of chocolate chips, because if you use more it makes the Muddy Buddies more grey instead of white.

Easy, delicious, a real crowd pleaser. They are always devoured first at a pot luck or holiday party and I have yet to meet someone who doesn't love these. I use milk chocolate chips and they are delicious. Definitely a safe bet for those who want to bring something that everyone will love.

I grew up on these and they are the best dessert/snack I've ever had.  I've made them for parties, for my husband to take to work, and just for snacking, and I get lots of compliments and they go fast.  They're especially enjoyed by kids and great for kids to help make, too.   Last time I made these, I ended up using milk-chocolate chips and they're borderline too sweet, so I would advise not to do that unless you really like sweet.

This is delicious - everyone loves it. However, my mother makes them a bit different, not sure what it is exactly, but they are just better than these... Perhaps because they are made with love. :-)

This recipe is amazing! I've made it twice now (and forgotten the vanilla both times), but it's still delicious.  I'm not even a fan of peanut butter! The only change I make is adding a few extra chocolate chips and a little bit of marshmallow cream. Thanks for the post!

Very tasty. Just how I remember having them as a kid.  Only word of advice, use a very large bowl to mix everything together. The Chex cereal is somewhat fragile and you want it to look nice and have whole pieces. If you have a very large bowl to mix it all together, you have a lesser chance of crushing the cereal peices.

Hershey's is coming out with new products soon including muddy buddies.  I got paid to test their new chocolate products that are the old homestyle candies American families made (including smores) and had to give my opinion in look, taste, packing, etc. I had never had muddy buddies before but when we got to that one it was sooo good I had to come home and find the recipe. I doubled the recipe and it was eaten in less than a week.  I put one bag of muddy buddies in the freezer and I would eat them right out of the freezer. It didn't lose its crunch. I now know that Hershey's has done a geat job because it tasted the same. The problem with making it is that you really can't stop eating them.  Trust me, I gained a few pounds because of these muddy buddies.  I can't wait til Hershey's starts selling this candy so I can just buy one.

I've used this recipe for years!   Try using Honey Roasted Peanut butter instead of regular peanut butter, the taste difference is amazing, considering this is already a tasty recipe.

These are delicious and fun for kids to make. I'm not too big of a chocolate lover but these are perfectly peanut-buttery so that the combination of chocolate and PB works really well. Great recipe!

I would have gave this recipe 5 stars,but 9 cups of chex is to much for the amount of chocolate and peanut butter.So I doubled the chocolate,butter,peanut butter,and vanilla.It turned out perfect and use powderd sugar as needed.

This is very easy to make but no one in my family even went back for seconds.  This is a house where cookies can't last a day.  It was easy but I am left with a HUGE bowl of a snack no one will eat.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe and was greatly disappointed.  I thought the flavor was kind of bland.  I had plenty of the mixture covering each piece so I'm not sure what the problem was.  Maybe it would be better with milk chocolate?? Also, the powdered sugar gets everywhere when you eat it.   On the plus side it is VERY easy to make.

A family favorite! I usually add some peanuts and raisins in for a little texture variation. And I always make a double batch because half of it gets eaten before it's even cool!

I love these! They are super easy to make and are YUMMMMMYYYY!!! The only thing that I usually do different is double the chocolate chips, peanut butter, maragarine, and vanilla. I found that the mixture wasn't enough to cover all of the cereal.

HOLY COW!!!  Where has this stuff been all my life?!  This was very, very, very good.  And really easy to make.  
I put in extra peanut butter and threw in pretzels (made really nice chocolate covered pretzels) and it came out great. After the shaking and cooling process I also added peanut M&M's (didn't want to coat the M&M's with the chocolate-peanut butter sauce).

I needed to add more chocolate to cover the amount of chex used. Making half of the recipe at a time ensured the chex got covered evenly. I also like the recipe without the peanut butter. Good stuff!

Too addictive and delicious.  I forgot the vanilla and used milk chocolate chips.  I divided between two bags and used more powdered sugar in one.  The ones with more sugar were much more attractive.  The ones with less looked more like dog food sadly, but I preferred flavor balance.

These things are addictive!  I had never made them before but since it takes just minutes and had the ingredients on-hand, I thought I would give them a try.  I used Rice Chex and cut back on the butter a bit.  I bet they only last a day or two in my house!  I may try them with hershey chocolate bars next time. Update 12/1/08:  I tried these using hershey chocolate bars and I did a mix of corn/rice chex.  I actually like them better with just the rice chex--the corn flavor competes too much, in my opinion.  And although I'm a milk chocolate lover, I think I prefer the semi-sweet with this recipe.  But that could be because I used the corn chex... Guess I'll have to try them again! Either way they get eaten and my husband gets recipe requests when he takes them to work.

Yup, I grew up with this too - but it was reserved for the holidays only... As an adult (stupid metabolism) and a mother, I understand why now.  My little guy loves to make this, and then he and his sister will literally fight over it!  JODILICIOUS is exactly right... RICE CHEX ONLY!

My daughters, little sister, and extended family love this recipe!! I can't make it quick enough!!! The best part is it only takes a few minutes to make!! Some people seem to have mentioned how it is messy but I kind of found a solution..... I use more confectioners' sugar then it calls for. That way it coats the cereal with the chocolate on it alot better and is less messy on your hands!!

I made this for the first time last year during the holiday season and LOVED it! If you love chocolate, peanut butter, chex mix, and powdered sugar you will LOVE this! You need a big "ziplock" bag to shake it up in, it is messy to eat but well worth it!

I first saw this at a High School party, but it was called something else- "Puppy Chow".  I was really disturbed that it was sitting out in a brown paper bag along with all the other food items, but when I looked inside I was delighted.   **I recomment Corn Chex in the recipe.  It gives a nice saltiness to contrast the pwdered sugar.  YUMM-O!

Oh yes, everything they say is true.  Teenagers go through this stuff so fast and beg for more.  I do suggest - for one box of chex cereal - to use 2 cups (one bag) of choc chips and a cup of peanut butter.  Also - I melt everthing in a big bowl in the microwave - then pour the cereal in that bowl to mix.  Much easier that way - if you have a microwave big enough to hold a large mixing bowl.  Another tip is to divide the powdered sugar into about thirds.  Pour a half cup or so of powdered sugar in the bag FIRST, then add about half the mix, pour in another half cup, add the rest of the mix, then put another half cup on top.  It makes the coating much easier that way.

Made the Halloween version with candycorn and peanuts. HUGE hit with the kids! Do not double the chocolate mix..... it would be WAY too much chocolate. Make as directed and you have the perfect amount!

These turned out great just like I remembered from when I was a kid.  I forgot to put in the vanilla, butI can't say it makes a noticeable flavor difference.

Yum!  I made these for the first time a few weeks ago and gave little bags of them away with other Christmas goodies.  All the feedback I got was that they taste great.  Even my picky eater liked them.  They're easy to make and yield a BIG batch, so they're perfect for parties or sharing with friends in goodie bags like I did.      These will definitely go into the holiday rotation.

So yummy, and the kids loved it!  I think next time I will use slightly less cereal so that they get a little more coated with the chocolate and peanut butter.  Seriously addicting!

I did everything in the microwave. Its faster and a much easier clean up. Tastes very good! And I only ever use rice chex, better texture. I prefer this recipe to the Puppy Chow because it uses butter and vanilla, both add nice flavor.

WOW...I can't believe I have never made/eaten this before! It is super simple to make and VERY addicting, lol. I followed the recipe exactly except I added maybe 1/2-3/4 cup of extra powdered sugar to get a nice white coating. My family absolutely LOVED this and I know it will be a new staple at my house! Thanks for posting. :)

These are a hit every time I make them.  They take a little bit of patience.. I suggest mixing half of the cereal with half of the sugar at a time.  They are addictive!

Pretty good.  I have eaten better, but that could very have been from operator error.  I used equal amounts of corn and rice chex for the recipe.  Somehow, though, it didn't seem like all the pieces got evenly coated with the chocolate.  If I make again, I will up the chocolate - PB mixture to make sure that all pieces are nice and covered.  overall, nice recipe though.  tastes pretty much how I expected it!

Used 3/4 cup butterscotch chips and 3/4 chocolate chips, with 3/4 cups peanut butter (crunchy) and the suggested butter. Added powdered sugar to get right color about 1 cup or so. One box will make 3 recipes worth.

Definitely a keeper!  I would go ahead and put the cereal in bag (I split it into 2 one gallon bags so both my boys can help!) and then pour the chocolate-peanut butter-margarine mix in the bag.  It seems like it wouldn't break the cereal as bad as just stirring does.  I mixed in some salted peanuts to give the sweet/salty effect - tasted great!

Really great. I forgot the vanilla extract and it was still good. Maybe a little extra powdered sugar is needed to get them all white and pretty.

Just OK for me. After reading the other reviews, couldn't wait to try but was not "bowled over" as others were. I think alot will be left over and I don't feel compelled to share in goodie bags which is what I had planned. Not quite what I wanted, will keep looking....

Great recipe; kids and adults love this treat.  I only make about half of the recipe most of the time.  Things to note, I usually put the cereal in a food storage bag and then I pour the chocolate/vanilla/peanut butter/margarine mixture in the bag and mix it all together.  I then pour a little over a cup of powdered sugar in the bag and mix.  If I make the whole recipe I usually use about 2.25 cups of powdered sugar.

I have made this for years, however, with butterscotch bark instead of chocolate chips (as I originally had it.) A wonderful change from chocolate and peanut butter and unbelievable! Okay, I confess, I usually make a batch of butterscotch and a batch of chocolate--don't tell!  :-)

SUPER TASTY!!  I was tired of all the cookies so, I decided to try a different sweet snack and I found the perfect one.  Needless to say, I made two batches of this.  One for me (I followed the instructions - almost exactly) and One for my husband who cannot eat chocolate.  For his, instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used Vanilla Chips.  I hate to say, it but, I almost like the Vanilla Chip/Peanut butter combo better.  Once the cereal was mixed w/ the chips/peanut butter/vanilla and butter, I threw the mix into a large ziploc bag and dumped the powdersugar in it. I then sealed the bag and shook til mixed.  I then dumped the extra sugar out (used a big strainer) it may be extra work but, was worth it.  These treats were yummy - who is to say you can bag them and give them as holiday gifts (Reindeer dropping or Snowman poop anyone?)

I just made these for the 1st time last night.  I liked them with a bit more powdered sugar then they suggest, so I just coated them twice.  They taste yummy and everyone that's tried them loves them so far.

Fun, quick and easy recipe for a snack at a party.  Very addictive!!  I actually ran out of powdered sugar, so I ended up using 1 cup powdered sugar and the rest I used a Splenda/Sugar blend.  It turned out great.  The only problem I had when I mixed the chex with the ingredients it was hard not to crush the cereal.  Is there a tick to this?

I thought the chocolate/peanut butter combination and flavor was perfect.  I accidentally bought UNSWEETENED banana chips (instead of sweetened) and didn't want to waste the.  Somehow I thought about using the chips in this type of party mix form and used half banana chips and half chocolate Chex.  I would recommend this.  Although I didn't follow the recipe completely, I thought the ratios worked well.

I used equal parts Corn, Wheat, and Rice Chex.  I made this on the stovetop in my homemade double boiler (ha ha).  I just mixed everything in a huge bowl, including the powdered sugar.  I only used 1/2 cup of the sugar, it was plenty.  Very good snack, we all enjoyed!

Yummy!  Brought this to a super bowl party and it was gone in nooo time. I had to freeze/refrig. mine to get it to harden and it was still sort of sticky. I think it may be because I used an all natural P.B. Next time I will add in some goodies for a snack mix!  Thanks!

Kids loved this one.  I may thin out the chocolate peanut butter mixture a bit more next time, because it was really hard to mix and came out kind of lumpy.  Overall, very very tasty. Thanks!

This is a very addicting snack. You just can't stop eating it. I used to make it all the time growing up, and recently found myself making it again for a quick snack.

This is soooo addictive!!  This is the second year i have made this and everyone loves it. I made it after my staff team at work begged me to make it again. The chocolate, sugar combo just melts in your mouth.  WIll make this every year.

So good! We made this for Christmas gifts and have had many requests for the recipe. Easy and fairly inexpensive to make and is SO well received! It was hard keeping my hubby out of it before I put it in little containers for gifts.

this is an all-time favorite of my familys. My sister and i call it "trash" since using a trash bag to shake a large amount was the easiest way to mix.

These turned out very good. I did notice that the chocolate clumped up too quick on the chex when I microwaved to 'smooth'  I had to stick chocolate in the micowave a little longer, until it was 'almost' runny. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but these turned out great in the end.
