I could not find the guajillo Chili sauce so I used Herdez Salsa Casera instead.  It was good! Had it with lime flavored rice, and fresh avocado on the side.

Used Salsa Verde instead of Red Chile sauce (and left out the sugar) and a Tex-Mex cheese blend. My mister loved it, and my sister dropped by, tried it and took some with her! Excellent recipe - will make again!
