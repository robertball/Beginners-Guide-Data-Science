Def. had an apple cider taste along with the Smoky flavor. Didn't keep chicken as moist as I would have liked. If these were the only ingredients I had on hand I would do this again but way way ahead to see if it made a difference in moistness. And I might reduce the ACV just a tad too.

I didn't marinate it as long as suggested. It had great flavor but it would have been SOOOO much better if I had marinated it as long as it was suggested.

I thought it had a really odd flavor, husband thought it was smoky and tangy.

Simple recipe--carries a good smoky flavor impact; the longer you marinade chicken, the better.  A slight step up with the brown sugar should ease any vinegar twang.  With this recipe, chicken tastes best grilled; when done--place on a plate, a sprinkle dash of water on chicken and cover tight w/ aluminum foil for about 15 minutes.  A must try w/ thick sesame teriyaki sauce, paired with Asian vegetables---but you can add other creative flavor enhancers and dish sides.

Smoky Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Too much vinegar. And the chicken dried out too. But it was easy." Not hard to throw this marinade together w/ what was easily on hand in the pantry, but the end result was a chicken devoid of moisture and heavy on the vinegar taste. Husband gave it 4 (he likes to take shots of apple cider vinegar /gag) and me and daughter a 2, so we'll settle in b/t.
