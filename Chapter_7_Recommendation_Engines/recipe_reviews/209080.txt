Excellent, easy, classy breakfast!!  I served it to the in-laws Christmas morning and there was nothing leftover.  The only modification I made was to use Lucky's Apple Pie Filling instead of the lemon filling (grocery store was out of lemon).  I could see how ANY pie filling would be tastey though!  Definitely needs to bake longer - 60+ minutes.

My mother loved this. I followed the directions exactly- however will do things a little differently next time.  I found there was way too much egg for my liking when poured over the bread so next time I will probably just dunk the bread pieces in the mixture.  I will also add that this would probably taste great with just about any flavour pie filling.

not really impressed with this recipe. Good but had better. If you like things really sweet & like lemon than you may like this.

This was really easy and very good. I may trim the crusts next time, so all the bread is soft.

I liked this, I just expected a bit more tanginess to it. The cream cheese really tones down the tartness of the lemon pie filling. We enjoyed it but not as much as the other overnight french toast we made.
