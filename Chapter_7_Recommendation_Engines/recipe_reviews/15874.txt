Missing Ingredients! I believe what this is missing is 1 tablespoon butter with the sugar and milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla with the dates and nuts. I prefer real butter and vanilla but margarine and vanilla flavoring will work. Cooking just short of the soft ball stage and beating in the dates and nuts with a wooden spoon makes it a bit creamier. Toasted pecans are our preferred nuts for this. I also use 1 1/2 cups of dates. My Grandmother made this every year until she couldn't, then my Mother took over. I inherited it when my Mom passed away. I am now teaching my daughter and daughter-in-law the tricks to making this wonderful candy.

My father made this recipe every Christmas. We called it "snake" candy because it is formed into a long roll before slicing. It is absolutely delicious and would make a great holiday gift. It is very simple to make, taking less than 30 minutes with a food processor to chop the dates and pecans.I highly recommend it!!

This recipe is great with TWO cups of sugar.  Helps reduce the "white stuff" we all get too much of.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.

You left out the 2 tablespoons of butter and teaspoon of vanilla which is added when the mixture is cooked.

I'm not sure that this recipe had all the ingredients listed!  I didn't understand what "softball" stage meant --- when I was finished, I felt that all I had was a log of suger! Yuk! I would love to hear more about this recipe from Sandra

I've been making this candy every Christmas since 1966.  My grandmother made it every Christmas when I was a child.  Three stars for this recipe because I think the 1 tablespoon of butter and teaspoon of vanilla was left out.  Also, I cook the sugar, milk (I use whole milk) and pitted dates together until the soft ball stage.  Then then add the nuts, butter and vanilla and beat until cool.  Wrap in a wet towel and form into a log.  Let cool completely and slice.  This candy is delicious, melt in your mouth and different from the ordinary Christmas candy everyone makes.

This is decent as written, but it does feel far too sweet (I know it's candy, but still). Changes I wish I had made: chopping the walnuts and dates more coarsely so as to have larger chunks of each, and cutting down the sugar so as to let the dates and nuts take a more prominent role. I'll do that next time, if there is a next time; should result in a more sophisticated end result.

This candy is a festive tasting candy.  The longer you let is mellow the better it is. Making it was a family Christmas tradition when I was growing up.  Make it with your children and grandchildren for some fond memories.

Stirring the mixture while its boiling makes the sugar crystallize and you end up with a log of balled sugar. Is that the intended outcome of this candy? I think it would be delicious if it were creamy.

I followed the recipe exactly using the candy thermometer and it turned out sticky and gooey. What is wrong?

My aunt made something similar.  We called it Aunt Irene's date roll (very creative, LOL)  My mom made it when we were kids.  Because of pitted and chopped dates, chopped pecans, and no stick pots, I am exploring some of my ancestor's recipes (hated cracking pecans as a kid!!)  Anyway, I live at 7,000 ft and everything is coming out very sugary.  I am trying to follow the Univ. of Las Cruces, Hi Alt. candy guidelines (see their website): minus 2 degrees for every 1,000 which for me is minus 14 and hope that solves the problem.  Would love to hear from others who have tried candy at hi alt.

This is the exact same Date Candy my mother use to make at Christmas. My mother NEVER measured ingredients so when I tried to make the candy it was always a challenge. Now having the correct measurements for the ingredients I can pass the recipe along to my children and grandchildren   Enjoy

Awesome Candy.  This is the same recipe my grandmother used to make for me at Christmas.  I am 65 years old.  This recipe has been around along time. lol  Brings back fond childhood memories at Grandma and Grandpa Carter's home at Christmas.
