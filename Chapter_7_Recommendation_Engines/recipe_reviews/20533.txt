This is sooooo good!!! We made it for our Super Bowl party and it was a huge hit. I have a glass drink dispenser so we made a lot at one time. This is the measurements that we used:  1 1/2 cups citron vodka, 1 cup Blue Curacao, 3 cups Sour mix (which Sweet and Sour is the same thing) and about 3/4 of a 2 litter bottle of 7up, then we floated Lemon slices on the top (which is so cute because they turned blue as the night when on). We ended up filling the  glass dispenser about three times cause everyone loved it.

A tasty and pretty drink!  I didn't put 12 ounces of lemon-lime soda in when I made these though - I just "topped off" each glass (with probably more like 4-5 ounces in each).  I garnished with a slice of lemon and a raspberry.  Made for an awesome-looking presentation!

Didnt have sour mix or citrus vodka.. So I used sweet and sour mix and passion fruit flavored vodka and it was still super yummy and not too sweet at all.

This is a very tasty drink, we use a 2 liter so that we can make multiple drinks and make it cheaper.

Made a big batch of this for our July 4th party and everybody loved it.  Used homemade sour mix and half 7-up and half club soda.  Not too strong, not too sweet!

Addicting! I used half the amount of lemon-lime soda and added in half lemonade as well. This way, it actually is lemonade! 
I also garnished all of these with a lemon wedge and a cherry. The contrast in the colors is also electrifying!

Really good!  FYI, if you don't have Blue Curacao you can use Triple Sec.  I used food coloring to make it blue and used other colors as well.  Fun!
