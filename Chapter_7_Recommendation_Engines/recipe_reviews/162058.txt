This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, although I did drain about 1/3 of the bacon grease before adding the snap peas.  I thought the snap peas ended up overcooked using the cook times in this recipe, although I will admit I like very crisp veggies.  In the future, I will immediately add the sugar and vinegar right when I add the snap peas.  It was distressing to me to watch the peas loose their beautiful bright green color as the vinegar was reducing.  Also, I thought it was slightly sweet, and would probably only use half as much sugar in the future.  I did buy Sugar in the Raw, but I'm not sure why you couldn't use regular sugar, or even honey.  Of course, since I had to buy a box of 100 packets of Sugar in the Raw, I can make this recipe another 33 times before I have to worry about what kind of sweetener to use...

Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe took a package of tired looking sugar snap peas and made them into something my kids raved about. One of the best "impact" side dishes I have made in quite awhile. I might moderate the amount of bacon grease I use the the next time to see if you can use less fat and still have the wonderful flavor. The first time my daughter has said this is as good as a fine restaurant to me in quite a long time.

WOW!  These are so good!  Surprisingly my kids loved them.  Even my four year old ate a couple of them.  I used frozen sugar snap peas and I only used a TBSP. of the bacon grease and it was plenty.  I did not have raw sugar but used 3/4 tsp. of brown sugar.  These turned out great.

A nice easy recipe.  I used 2 slices of bacon, added a clove of minced garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I served this with mashed potatoes, and the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style (from this site).  The mashed potatoes were a nice complement to the bacon in the snap peas.

Really yummy, and quick!  Even my picky 8 year old loves these and is happy when they are part of our meal.  I love these in the spring when it's still chilly in the evenings.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Yum! I love snap peas. I also love balsamic so I knew this was a match. I used fresh snap peas but had to use Splenda as I can't have sugar but it turned out wonderful and less calories also. I pre-cooked my bacon crispy so didn't use the bacon grease but just a tablespoon of olive oil to fry the beans in. Great recipe.

Nice.  I followed the recipe and it turned out very good.  A little more bacon grease than I would normally consume, but the flavor was superb.  Does not reheat well.

I love snap peas and this glaze is so yummy. The only tweak I make is adding some slivered almonds on top right before serving. I love the crunch.

I used balsamic glaze instead of reducing the balsamic vinegar with the sugar. I also added 1 tsp of olive oil and toasted sesame oil, as well as some garlic powder and salt. It was delicious!

Some of the grease needs to be drained off before adding the balsamic - the greasy balsamic sauce wasn't very appealing. I used regular sugar (couldn't see where 1 T. of turdinado vs. regular sugar would make any difference).

Had some beautiful sugar snap peas from the farmer's market and this recipe was just the perfect touch.  I made the recipe as written but cooked the peas only a couple of minutes to keep them crisp.  I also added some toasted slivered almonds.  Delish!

First of all, bacon makes everything better!  I followed a few of the other reviewers suggestions and poured out some of the bacon grease before adding the peas.  I found the dish to still be a little too greasy for my liking (which is why I have rated it 4 stars).  I also added the balsamic, sugar, and bacon to the peas at the same time that the peas went into the skillet as I like my veggies to be a little on the crisp side.  Overall it was a very yummy dish with just the right amount of sweetness to it.

A-MAZ-ING!!    I added two extra ingredients; 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese and 1/4 cup of soy nuts.  It was absolutely amazing.

Loved this!  Drained off some of the bacon grease. Added the peas, sugar and vinegar all together and only cooked for a few minutes as I like my veggies almost raw.

These are fantastic! One of the best side dishes I've ever eaten. I didn't have enough sugar snap peas, so I added some green beans as well. I added the beans 2 to 3 minutes before I put the peas in and they turned out perfect. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This tasted good but I agree with an earlier posted that you must drain a lot of the bacon fat.  Also, I made the mistake of using a non-stick pan (the only pan I had left) and so I believe it made the snap peas even greasier.  Good flavor with the balsamic and sugar.

As so many others suggested, I reduced the amount of bacon grease drastically,  and added the peas, balsamic vinegar, and sugar as soon as the bacon was done so the peas would still be crunchy. It was great as a side dish. I gave it four stars because I reduced the fat and cooking time.

The next time I made it into an entree by doubling the balsamic vinegar and sugar, adding some onion, portobello mushrooms and leftover rotisserie chicken and serving it over rice. Then I sprinkled some sliced almonds on top. This recipe is so quick and versatile. I can think of lots of veggies I want to cook this way. My family raved about the peas as both ways.

This was pretty good.  I had made it ahead of time so didn't use the bacon grease.  I don't think I would want to use that even if I didn't make it before.

This recipe was awesome an went great with the black pepper beef satay kabobs I had with it. Only thing I added to make it taste better was 2 small minced garlic gloves. This was a favorite in the house and will be made again.

I rough cut with scissors 3 strips of bacon, fried till almost crisp, then just threw in the snap peas. Did a couple stirs to coat, then added the balsamic and sugar.  I did not cook these long, as I did not want to lose the pretty green color of the peas.  I thought it was a fabulous side dish! I will be making this again.

This was fabulous!  I used snap peas from this morning's farmer's market.  After reading other reviews, I drained some of the bacon grease, cooked the snap peas for only 4 minutes, and used regular sugar.  I'll be making this many more times this summer.

We ended up with bowl of sugar snap pods after my daughter shelled them for her canary. This recipe was the perfect way to use the pods.I agree that you should drain off most of the bacon fat. Also a little less sugar would be better. Sugar snaps are already sweet so adding a lot of sugar is not necessary. I will definitely make these again.

Wow, these are fantastic!  Best recipe I have ever made using snap peas.  I drained some of the grease as it seemed to be a lot.  I used regular sugar as I didn't have the other and it turned out perfect.  Yum!

Great way to make tasty FROZEN snap peas. My alterations made it SUPER quick. 8 min. I let them thaw on the counter for 15 minutes. Didn't have bacon but used 1T bacon grease (saved in fridge). Used 1T brown sugar and 1T cheap balsamic and 1T very good balsamic. And sea salt. We could not stop eating them...which is rare for veg in our house. Will put in my regular rotation!

My family and I never tried sugar snap peas before. This made it a hit. They asked for seconds!! I used less bacon, balsamic and sugar (I used brown b/c I didn't have Sugar in the Raw on hand.) and it worked just as well. I'll defiantly be making this again.

Thank you for sharing the recipe! I loved it! I just added a jalapeno pepper to the bacon to give it a little spice (a whole pepper-not too spicy either)and it was perfect!

The most painless way to eat veggies, ever!  And easy, too!  I don't buy raw bacon any more, just the precooked stuff.  So, I snipped 4 slices with kitchen shears and added to the skillet.  After the bacon started to release a little fat (~2 min) I added the sugar snap peas and proceeded from there.  No need to drain anything.  I did use white sugar instead of raw.

I really enjoyed these, though DH thought they were too sweet.  I used frozen peas and brown sugar, as that was what I had on hand.  I did like some others recommended and drained off all but a couple tablespoons of the bacon grease.  I will make these again.

I didn't use "real" bacon b/c I didn't have it on hand. But it was a tasty dish. Probably best with all fresh ingredients. I used frozen snap peas.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it was o.k., but nothing spectacular.  I always try to follow exactly, but there was so much grease from the bacon (and I used center cut), I drained a great deal off.  There just wasn't much flavor.  Sorry I wanted to rate higher, but can't

This is amazing...as is.  As a warning however, I love just plain steamed snap peas...I'm not sure I can go back to the healthy version now.

TASTES WONDERFUL!!! Next time I'll drain some of the grease before adding the peas. Other than that, no alterations needed.

Very good recipe.  I drained off most of the grease, and next time would keep even less.  I used regular sugar and thought it was good.  I added the vinegar and sugar first and let it cook down a little bit before adding the peas.  Overall, quite tasty.
