Made as written and this turned out great! The seasoned flour was excellent and would be great on onion rings, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, etc. If you want to impress your  guests, this is the recipe to do it. The blooming onions you get in steakhouses have nothing on this bad boy!

I loved this recipe, but the amount of mix you need is not as much as said. It also was very difficult to get the mix ALL in the inion, this is probably due to me not having the right materials. But all-in-all it was good if you like onions.

It was a lot of work and they  didn't turn out. My onion petals didn't really separate well and it didn't cook all the way through. I will not try this again. I'll stick to ordering it at Texas Roadhouse :).

I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil but the inside of the onion was still uncooked. I cooked it for the alloted time. Will attempt it again and cook it longer.
