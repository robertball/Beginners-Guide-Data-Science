this was pretty tasty.. i've never had bulgogi before so i have nothing to compare it with.. i thought the flavors were going to be a little more pronounced but me and bf still enjoyed it.. i did only use regular garlic, not roasted.. so that could be part of the reason.. plus i also left out the sugar (not a big fan of sweet) and used ground turkey for the beef.. worried it would be salty i used low sodium soy sauce and left out the salt.. but found myself needing to salt my patties at the end.. i used some cooking rice wine that i bought at the chinese store for the mirin.. all and all we liked the dish.. ty for the recipe

My daughter and I enjoyed the flavor of these but next time would cut down on the salt (in fact, I think the soy sauce alone adds enough salt).  My husband wasn't a fan, but was able to eat them doused in sriracha.  As other reviewers suggested, we ate these without a bun.

Amazing recipe. I served it with rice and my 1-year-old actually loved it. I loved it too. I didn't even have the sesame seeds or roast the garlic and it was still delicious. Also, I couldn't find the white sugar so I used brown sugar instead. I halved the recipe since I only bought one pound of ground beef (85/15) but kept the amount of green onions the same. Delicious.

My family really enjoyed these burgers! They pan fried beautifully and the ingredients created a sweet, Korean flavored glaze on the outside of the patties. I served them with sesame noodles, but most of my family ate them on hamburger buns. Personally I think the bread hid the bulgogi flavor (my favorte part) so I just cut mine up and ate it by itself. For my family of 5 to all agree on a dish is a big deal, so I will certainly make these again....thanks for the great recipe!

These were delicious! I usually don't try recipes with so little reviews but I'm glad I tried this one. My hubby, parents, and siblings loved them. I will definitely be making these again. It was my first time making burgers. I used regular onion because that was all I had.

Wonderful recipe- I substituted a quarter cup of sake and two tablespoons of white sugar for the mirin. I also scrambled the ground beef mixture into medium chunks which we ate wrapped in lettuce leaves.

Have to agree with the first reviewer that these are better without the bread.  Quite a different burger.  I guess I'll just call it Bulgogi Patties the next time I make it.  Thanks.
As leftovers, they were better.

Very good - but as other reviewers recommend, don't eat on a bun. It takes away all the flavor. Eat with rice instead.

I made these without the salt and toasted sesame seeds, and they were really good. I did barbecue them and served on a bun but after reading other reviews, I will not use a bun next time. That said, they do have the taste of bulgogi and I will make again.

These where great! I have made these twice. The second time I mixed the meat mixture the day before and let it marinate all the flavors which ended up being amazing!

These were terriffic.   Cut the recipe in half for a smaller 'posse' and everyone (x3) loved them.  I think the cooking time was right on as well.
