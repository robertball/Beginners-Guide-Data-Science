I made a few changes to this recipe and loved how it turned out.  First of all i used low fat vanilla yogurt instead of plain and no oil.  Then instead of making it in an ice cream maker i put it into a ziplock bag and stuk it in the freezer layed out flat.  It froze very quickly and was delicious. We ate it all with no left overs!  The almonds are a great touch.  This would also be delicious with peaches or rasberries instead of the almonds.  I will definatly make this one again.

This frozen yogurt was so good.  Instead of using vanilla soy milk I used half and half and added a dash of vanilla.  I also added some almond extract, marachino cherry juice.  Instead of serving the almonds on the side I made them sugared almonds and added them into the mixture along with some cherries.  I loved it!  I will be making this again!

I made this and used half and half because I didn't have soy milk. I don't have an ice cream maker, but it froze just fine in a gallon ziploc bag. I also put a little vanilla extract and almond extract in. I put toasted almonds on top prior to serving.

i love this recipe. i no longer have to go out for good frozen yogurt. here's how i've changed it to my tastes. i use half and half instead of soy milk and vanilla yogurt instead of plain, then i just add 1 or 2 tb of honey and freeze in my ice cream machine. it does freeze pretty hard in the freezer but most ice cream recipes without eggs do that. I just take it out of the freezer about 15 minutes before serving to let it thaw a little. I have tried it with and without vanilla extract, its food both ways and i also used coconut extract once and tossed in some coconut then sprinkled toasted coconut on top with a drizzle of chocolate sauce for a sundae sooo good!!!

Well, I tried it without the oil, and it turned out hard as a rock by the next day, so I'm making it again with the oil.  Adding raspberries, drained crushed pineapple, and chopped bananas near the end of the cycle.  Fun recipe to play with...and so yummy!

The taste is terrific!  I froze the mixture in a bowl, and stirred it up occasionally. That might be why I ended up with a consistency more like sorbet than creamy smooth ice cream. We will be making this again!

Really liked the balance of tangy yogurt flavor with the sweet of the ice cream.  I used plain yogurt and added vanilla extract, like others, which I think added to the tanginess that I liked.  I also used splenda (equal amount) rather than honey.  Will definitely make again, but maybe with almond extract instead. THX!

I've been making ice cream and frozen yogurt for a while, and this is by far the worst tasting recipe I have tried.  It is extremely sour.  Find another recipe!

Very good but I made some changes. I used Fage greek yogurt(2% and 0%), AGAVE nectar as sweenter, frozen unsweetned strawberries, and almond milk. It was great! Thanks!

A great alternative to using milk products.  It froze rock hard though, so I'll have to see what I can do to help that.

I made this with organic whole milk yogurt and half and half, and added cocoa powder - about 2 or 3 tablespoons and a little grated dark chocolate.  Yummmmmmm!

Yummy eaten right after it's churned, gets hard when stored. Switched fresh goats Milk for the soy, added tbsn Ginger, and had maple syrup on hand instead of honey. Yum. Skipped oil. It was goat yogurt too. Have also added fresh fruits with happy success.

I used my ice cream maker for this recipe which seemed fine when it was first ready.  It was creamy, different, but okay.  But it does not freeze well, the next day it was a rock solid mess that was not eatable anymore.

Very light tasting.  I think this would be great with fresh fruit added.  I added a tsp of vanilla extract, skipped the oil, and used almond milk.  It was really good.

I was very excited to make this recipe but was completely disappointed. The taste was horrid and the texture was hard as a rock and the consistency of italian ice.
