I made the stuffed zucchini several ways.  I tried it the way the recipe stated and although it was good, it was a little bland for our taste.  I then made several using the same filling, but, added some sauteed red & yellow bell pepper, a little panko, dried oregano, & basil. The extra seasoning added a lot of flavor. This is a great recipe that you could easily adapt to your taste.  I will definitely be making again!

Excellent and easy recipe. I did add ground turkey along with fresh basil, oregano and thyme to the mixture as well as some sweet bell pepper.  The Feta and Parmesan make it a really good dish.  This is an excellent way to use all the zucchini you have in your garden and the tastiest way to use the over sized zucchini which, if you're like me, you forget to check on and they get gigantic.
