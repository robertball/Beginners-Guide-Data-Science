Great cake, light and moist.  Made it twice,  2nd time i added apples peeled, cored and sliced then coated with a spenda cinnamon sugar mix to the batter.  It was much better the second time.

The first time I made this cake, it came out hard and dry on the top and then on the inside it was a little dry but very very thick and dense and left a bad after taste in my mouth, the 2nd time I made it, I increased the butter by 1/4c and I used SPLENDA SUGAR BLEND FOR BAKING, it cam out SO much better, I highley reccomend using the baking blend b/c It won't leave the artificial sugar taste in your mouth

The cake did come out nice and moist, but I wasn't crazy about the taste.  It seemed like it was lacking something.

The cake looked good, and it smelled great.  However, it tasted just okay.  However, the texture was very dense and thick.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I am not sure if that's how the cake was intended to be.  I prefer my cakes to be a little fluffier.

I loved it. It was hard to stop at one piece. You'd never know it was made with splenda.
