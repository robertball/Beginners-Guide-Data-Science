This is a great dip, but I had a few changes.  First off, take away the veg. oil, there is no need for it.  Remove the garbanzo beans.  Replace with chili (spelling?) beans.  Double the lime juice.  Salsa increased to 12oz, and add a teaspoon of chives (or one shoot of freshly chopped scallion [green onion]).  Add 2 (or 3) chopped, pickled jalapeños.  Add a pinch of salt and a bit of ground black pepper. Much better!  :D  4/5 for my recipe.  I will be modifying again next time.  Will update.

This recipe didn't have much flavor and I didn't like the taste of the garbanzo beans with the chili powder.  The recipe tastes mainly of chili powder.  I will not be making this again.

This took 5 minutes to throw together.  My husband and I LOVE it, as do my kids!!  Instead of parsely use fresh cilanto!  Also experiment with other beans!  Great recipe!

Although I have not made this recipe yet, it sounds quite tasty!  I will be making it with raw, sprouted beans and home made salsa with fresh peppers and cilantro to fit my raw vegan lifestyle.  I'll post when I have done the taste test.  :)

This is awesome as a dip on tortilla chips!  Instead of the chili powder, I added 4 shakes of Mrs. Dash's Southwest Chipolte seasoning.  It was delish!!!!  I am making again right now!!!

I'm always on the lookout for new bean recipes, and this one was pretty good. I'm only making meals for two, and I used dry beans, so I cut down the amount of beans by half. I didn't have any salsa, so I chopped up a few tomatoes.. (they weren't overly juicy, so it still seemed slightly lacking in the liquid department.. but that was my fault..) I made a basic pico de gallo as the salsa, (tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, lots and lots of cilantro and garlic). I used the full amount of everything else, and I added half a red pepper, and half a yellow pepper. Hubby said that he liked it a lot, but it was missing 'something'... I think it was salt... because I used dried beans.. I'll probably make it again.. but my recipe box has SOOOO many recipes in it that I want to try... who knows when I'll get around to it.. Thanks for the recipe!

This was quite good! My boyfriend made it for just the two of us, so we used one can of 6 bean blend and scaled everything else down. It had a great spicy flavour and the corn was the best part, a great contrast to the texture of the beans. Next time I'll add cilantro, I think it would go perfectly.

Quick, easy and versatile. I omitted the parsley, and added freshly snipped cilantro. Also threw in some finely diced onion left over from a different bean salad recipe. Thanks, Heather!

Very tasty! This is another one that needs to "marinate" for a few days. Stretched the half-jar of salsa I had with some red wine vinegar and used a bag of prepared "mixed beans," which were navy, pinto and I think kidney. Once I had it in the storage container I sprinkled some Frank's Red Hot on top. I'd like it hotter, but for most it probably already has plenty of kick!

I was looking for a tasty way to use up our excess of canned beans.  Though I wouldn't call this recipe "spicy" by my tastes, it was good and served its purpose.  I have used it as a topping for toasted tortillas and as a salsa for chips.

I really liked this recipe and it was a great way to use some of the dried beans in my food storage. However, my husband and I much prefered this salad heated with a sprinkling of cheese on top and served on crispy corn tortillas. Made for a great healthy lunch!

add feta!!! It makes all the difference. I also used a can of Ro-Tel(lime & cilantro) in place of lime juice and salsa. I eat it as a dip with blue corn chips. Yums.

Every time I make this I get rave reviews. It's good as a side salad at BBQs or as a dip for chips - and it's easy as can be!

I only rate this four stars because I altered the recipe.  I left out the garbanzo beans and added an extra can of pinto beans.  I also took other reviewers' advice and substituted the parsley with cilantro.  I didn't have cumin that day so I added curry, along with a few splashes of pineapple juice.  Everyone who has tried this loved it!  I enjoy it added to salads for a nice kick.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a good recipe. It makes quite a bit so be prepared to share it with everyone or eat it for days. The seasonings were very good on the beans and may even taste wonderful in some type of Mexican dish, whether tacos, burritos, or nachos.

I'm rating according to my adjustments: I only used black & pinto beans (2 cans ea), omitted the parsley and instead added about 4T chopped cilantro, 2 chopped jalapenos, and lots of extra lime juice + a total of about 6 oz of the salsa (I found it WAY too dry)... that being said - we really enjoyed it, and I'll definitely make it again.

I found it a little bland, but I loved how it kept its consistency and didn't get mushy. A friend suggested frying up the ground yak I had in the freezer and that enhanced it noticeably.

I thought this was a great salad and will make it often. My 11 year old daughter even requested it in her school lunch! I used a can of corn instead of frozen, olive oil instead of veg., and Pace Picante for the salsa. Served with grilled chicken and mexican rice. Thank-you!

I also did not add the veg oil, and I felt it was not spicy enough so I added some chopped jalepeno, however this recipe can be modified by adding whatever you have in the fridge such as celery, red pepper, or veg of choice. It's a good base and we ate it with scoops tortilla chips with shredded cheddar on top.. great !

I really liked this recipe. Bean salad is not something I would typiclly make but I needed something for my vegetarian BBQ guests. It was a hit. I used medium spicey salsa which gave this side a nice kick. The bonus is that this is super easy to make.

Easy and versatile for whatever you have on hand. I used one can fire roasted diced chilies, one can fire roasted diced jalapeno, one can fire roasted diced tomatoes, fresh cilantro (omitted parsley), diced green onions, then the remaining ingredients as listed. Great right away, but even better after all the flavors married in the fridge.

It was bland and the garbanzo beans seemed really out of place.

Great easy bean salad. As most other people did, I modified the recipe a little. I eliminated the garbanzo beans and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the salsa becasue that is what I had in my pantry. I also added about 1/4 tsp of garlic salt. When I went to serve it, I diced an avacado and topped the beans with it.

Instead of jar of salsa, I used chopped fresh tomatoes, cilantro and a little onion. I doubled the cumin and added a tablespoon of chili powder.  Plus, salt and pepper to taste. Delicious!

Yummy, and super easy. but I feel it needs more dressing.  Next time I will add some olive oil and double the lime juice.  I might add some diced onion too.

Quick, easy and simple to make. You can tweak it  a bit with more spice, or maybe more lime but this salad recipe is delicious.

Great salad! I made my own salsa for this dish so it had a lot more liquid than the original but i prefer it that way! I also used real chillis instead of powder and think it tasted great!

A very easy recipe. I made it to go with chicken tostadas while camping, it was a very tasty addition. I used fresh corn kernels scraped straight from the cob.

Yesterday I made this with canned corn that was drained and added Great Northern Beans. Since I didn't have chunky salsa I used homemade salsa, cut the Chili powder in half and doubled the lime juice. Also I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Love the way it turned out. Perfect for kids due to the reduced heat!

Not really a fan of the salsa in the bean salad. The dressing was just lacking and uninteresting to me.

This was absolutely amazing and completely foolproof. I had to feed 25 people for two nights with no electricity, so warm food was out, but I still needed protein options for vegetarians and this was a godsend. It chills perfectly and tastes wonderful! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Get lots of praises about this recipe. I used a corn salsa in substitution for corn and salsa. It was fantastic!

Loved this!  Used flavored olive oil in place of veg oil.  Was good cold but heated because I knew dew would like better.....wonderful both ways!

I wanted something unusual/different for potluck at church. Unfortunately, I was out of garbanzo beans so I substituted white kidney beans, ditto for lime juice so used lemon, and was out of cumin / vegetable oil. So I added diced celery and green onion for crunch and flavor. After adding the last of my salsa (bit less than the 8 ounces called for), it tasted really good! Next time I WILL be sure to have correct ingredients on hand!

Super easy! Great for family get together's when you don't have a lot of time or money. We prefer a little more salsa and a lot more spice for our family but its such a flexible recipe :)

Awesome chilled side dish - and the leftovers are phenomenal to punch up cheese quesadillas!  Took other reviewers advice & left out the garbanzos, and subbed fresh cilantro for the parsley.  Also used farm fresh chunky hot salsa (almost like pico de gallo) & about 1/2 more chili powder for more of a kick.
