I made over 400 Valentine Sandwich cookies for my dessert business clients this year using this recipe.  I personally don't like crisp/cut-out sugar cookies, but everyone went NUTS over these cookies.  My niece has me make them for softball games, parties, etc.--she loves them. After making so many of these, I can offer a few suggestions: (1) refrigerate dough for 2-3 hours (I made over 30 batches of dough & often let it refrigerate overnight). I always put the dough back in the refrigerator between batches. (2) I used 2 tsp of vanilla & eliminated the almond extract. (2) When I rolled out the dough, I used confectioners' sugar (10X) NOT flour--I even re-used previously roll-out dough without any problems.  The confectioners' sugar gives the cookie a little extra flakiness. (3) I sprinkled colored sugar on the cookie with the cut-out section before baking-the colored sugar looks nice with the contrast of the frosting coming through the cut-out. (4) I baked the cookies on Silpat, but parchment would work too. (5)I used a different frosting:  2 cups confectioners' sugar (10X), 3/4 tsp vanilla and 4-6 tbsp half & half or whole milk, plus food coloring.  The frosting was always a big hit. (6) I individually bagged the cookies in cellophane cookie bags & everyone commented on how freshed they stayed.  I will be using this recipe for St. Patrick's with shamrock cookie cutters; green sugar & green frosting!  Thanks for the recipe!

I consider myself a cookie connoisseur, and this recipe is fabulous!  There is no need to refrigerate the dough if you roll it between two pieces of parchment paper.  I've had great success using different flavourings in the icing, such as raspberry, amaretto, irish cream, etc., instead of vanilla. I've also used cream instead of water to make the icing. You can be really creative with using different coloured icings and various cookie cutter shapes.  Any time I've brought these cookies to a baby shower or wedding shower, they have been raved about.  Soon, I plan on using a palm tree shaped cutter with pina colada flavoured icing for my next beach theme wedding shower.  Can't wait to bake again!

As far as cookies go, I prefer drop cookies (much easier!) but for quick cutouts, these worked rather well. The frosting / sandwiching took a while for me, but that's my own doing, not the recipe's fault. I second the warning to put space between the cookies if you make them 1/4" thick, because they will poof up and out a bit and will stick together.  Strong recommendation is to place dough between parchment paper for rolling, and then it's easy to simply cut out the shapes, pull off the excess, and move the parchment paper onto the cookie sheet.

This recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS!!   I did make a few changes.  I used lemon extract in place of the almond extract.  I also used seedless raspberry jam to sandwich the cookies together and dusted the tops with powdered sugar.  Everyone raves about these cookies. My kids can't wait for me to make them. Since it's Valentines day, I'm going to get busy right now.  Thanks!

Delicious cookies - very light and buttery.  The dough isn't as easy to work with as I thought is would be.  That is until I got the hang of it by rolling between two pieces of lightly floured wax paper and putting it into the freezer - then doing the cut outs.  I baked it on parchment paper and did sandwich cookies with seedless strawberry jam then gave the cookies a nice sprinkle of powdered sugar.

I have been searching for a while now for a cookie that my mum use to make for me to bring to school for valentines day. To make the cookie more like hers, I omitted the icing and used seedless raspberry jam and then afterwards drizzled have of them with white chocolate. I'm not sure if anyone else has suggested this....but instead of trying to fight to get the cookies up and keeping there shape, roll the dough out on parchment paper...cut...remove excess dough then put in the oven on a cookie sheet! Definelty will be making again!

Very easy to make and the taste is great. But be sure to place cookie at least 1 inch away from each other, they really "grow" during baking.

Excellent,Excellent!!! I used previous advice and chilled the dough. I made single cookies for St. Patties Day. The first batch puffed up and did not keep their shape well. I then made cut outs and put them on cookie sheet and refrigerated again for at least 10 minutes before baking and they retained their shapes much better. I thought the dough was very easy to work with and used 10X sugar instead of flour for rolling out. This is my new recipe for cut out cookies. Fantastic recipe Laria! Thanks

I don't know how anyone can say you could work with this dough at room temperature.  I had to refrigerate it for over an hour before I could roll it out without sticking.  Other than that, they were a big hit at work.

These cookies are great!  I have made these for several school valentine parties.  I use the two heart cut-outs and fill the sandwich with a generous amount of homemade buttercream frosting (colored pink)  They look and taste wonderful!  I don't decorate the cookie because the pink buttercream looks nice with the light golden cookie.

I made these cookies for Christmas. I used a fluted round cookie cutter instead of a heart. I also used seedless raspberry jam instead of frosting. Everyone at home and at work loved these cookies. I will be making them on a regular basis from now on!!

Today being February 14th, I made these!  I made 2 batches.  I read once that it is best to refridgerate dough for 1/2 hour before rolling it out.  I did that.  This recipe worked out beautifully!  The only problem I had was it took me almost all day to make them!  They were worth it though...very very good!  YUMMY...I'd make them again.

Very easy recipe to make and the cookies are very soft. I put seedless raspberry jam in between the cookie layers which was very tasty.

This will be my new Go-To recipe for sugar cookies. It was perfect as is. I only used vanilla. Didn't have to refrigerate the dough. It was easy to work with and my son loved the cookies very much. I didn't make sandwiches out of them because the link to the frosting is broken anyways. I decorated some with royal icing and some with marshmallow fondant. Very good!

These cookies are great and look very dramatic. I used seedless raspberry preserves on the bottom cookie and dusted the top cookies with powdered sugar before putting them together so the powdered sugar would not get on the jelly centers. These rolled out easily for me, I didn't even bother to put the dough back in the fridge between batches. I used powdered sugar to roll them out on a sheet of parchment paper and baked them on parchment paper too.

I made this recipe today for Valentine's Day tomorrow. I like to make little treats for my husband to take to his co-workers. For a surprise, I used raspberry jalapeno jelly on the inside of the cookie sandwich! The outside I iced with a simple powdered sugar and milk icing. I found 8 minutes to be the perfect baking time for me. I stuck the dough in the freezer for a short wait on getting started with rolling and cutting. Per another user's advice, I rolled the cookies with powdered sugar instead of flour--unless you like extra sweet cookies, I'd recommend using the flour instead. A tasty cookie! Didn't have trouble with it running while baking :)

I made this with the full intention of doing the whole "sandwich" thing. Unfortunately my cookie cutters were kind of big and also a lot of the cutout hearts didn't match up well with the smaller hearts. So I decided to serve them as is, separately without frosting. The taste and texture was very good (I omitted the almond extract)... not a soft cookie but not super crunchy as long as you watch the baking time. I baked for about 7 minutes. I usually have  a terrible, terrible time with sugar cookie dough being too sticky and impossible to roll out. However I followed suggestions of chilling the dough AND using confectioner's sugar to roll out as opposed to flour. It wasn't foolproof but it was a much better experience. I also divided the dough into thirds and colored one red and another pink. The cookies turned out well, I ended upw tih multicolored hearts, some with holes in the middle. I think this might be my next roll-out sugar cookie recipe. Remember to chill the dough and use confectioners sugar to "flour" the dough and your work surface. I handled the  out of this dough and it didn't get tough or dry.

This is a definite 5 star recipe!  I substituted 2 teaspoons of lemon juice for cream of tartar as I didn't have any.  Also, I was low on butter so I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening.  I rolled the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and cut the cookies out and placed them on a cookie sheet.  I made half as sandwich cookies and the other half as plain sugar cookies.

These cookies were a lot of work, but pretty good. They came out a bit crispier than I would've liked, so I'd probably keep them a little thicker next time. I took another reviewer's advice and lightly dusted the rolling pin, the dough, and my work surface with powdered sugar instead of flour, which was nice.
I'd only make these again if I had a lot of time and didn't mind cleaning up afterward!

I ended up not following the directions because my cookie cutters were the wrong sizes, but just made plain old hearts for my son's school party.  They were great!  Very good basic cookie recipe!

Tasted yummy and dough was pretty easy to work with until it got to room temp, where it became sticky. This was my first time making cut-out cookies and I had no trouble. Recipe definitely works well with chilled dough. Definitely recommended :)

i've used different cut out sugar cookie recipes before, and this is the best recipe i've ever used.  i worked colored sugar into the dough and alternated using strawberry jam and prepackaged cookie frosting to sandwich the cookies.  i kept it refrigerated for a few days until i had time to roll it out and i had no problems with the dough.

First, let me say my review is based on the dough, only. My son and I made the dough to use for cut-out sugar cookies. That being said, this is THE BEST recipe I have EVER used. I attempt sugar cookies at Christmas every year, and this year, I found success! I made very few changes. I used the full amount of vanilla plus a full tsp of almond extract. I have used the dough both chilled and unchilled, and it is easier to roll if chilled first. Still, I only chilled it about 45 minutes, and it never went back into the fridge after that, but was still a dream to work with. I used powdered sugar to roll it out, and greased my cookie sheets. Exactly 6 minutes worked perfectly in my oven. This recipe is so good that my son and I are making them again today!

I was very dissapointed with this recipe.  I followed it exactly, and used confectioner's sugar instead of flour to roll it out.  The dough was absolutely delectable, but the finished cookie didn't have a great taste, was very brittle, and spread a lot during baking, making the cutout tops unusable because the shapes were all messed up and didn't look like hearts anymore at all.  I much prefer the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe from this site which I made at Christmas, they cut out beautifully and retained their shape while cooking, also have a better taste and not such a crispy/brittle texture.

I gave these cookies wrapped in plastic wrap and tied with a bow as Valentine treats at my daughter's school party.  The kids (and moms!) loved them!  I used a simple frosting for the filling, 2 cups powdered sugar with 2-3 tbs. milk and a couple of drops of red food coloring.  The results were fantastic!

I just made these for my kids for Valentine's Day and have to say they were a winner. I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and refrigerated the dough before rolling but had trouble rolling it at first. Once it finally warmed up, it rolled much easier. I also rolled it out on powdered sugar rather than flour and that made the cookies taste even better. Definitely making these again.

YUM! I love almond flavour so I replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with almond meal, and also added the zest of one lemon. They are delicious! They did puff up quite a bit even though I froze them for 10 minutes before baking, as someone else suggested... but other than that they were perfect!

I made these for Valentines day and just looked up the recipe to have it ready for Easter. They are INCREDIBLE. I filled them with raspberry jam and drizzled chocolate ganache across the tops. My family thought they came from a bakery. If you like a softer cookie keeping them covered or in a plastic bag will soften them up. Make these if you want to get rave reviews, but set aside a little time, they are time consuming, but worth it.

These were very pretty and festive looking, but I prefer my own sugar cookie recipe.  These reminded me of the frosted soft sugar cookies at walmart.

Straight out of the oven I was skeptical of these cookies.  My cookies spread out a lot, did not keep the little heart shape in the center and were thin, crispy and brown around the edges.  I rolled them out in powdered sugar instead of flour.  I iced them with "Sugar Cookie Icing" and instead of using icing in between the cookies I used raspberry jam w/ a bit of lemon juice.  I let these set over night to take to work the next morning.  Over night the cookies softened A LOT and the flavors of raspberry, lemon and almond mingled together making a delicious cookie.  I received many compliments from coworkers!

I think the trick is in the confectioner's sugar.  Flakey and delicious cookies.  I used confectioner's sugar when I rolled them out, instead of flour.  I used lemon extract instead of almond (in case of allergies).  Next time I would use more lemon extract because it was hard to taste in the cookies. (its not as strong as almond extract tho.  Next time I would probably just squeeze a lemon in there if I had one).

This is a really great recipe. I actually had to bake mine at only about 325 degrees, but that could have just been my oven. I also reccommend putting down parchment paper on your baking sheet because they can be pretty tough to remove. I used raspberry jam and powdered sugar, and it was so delicious, so perfect for valentine's day.

These turned out beautifully and were delicious.  Instead of the frosting filling, we used raspberry jam and peach preserves.  On some of the cookie tops, we sprinkled  sanding sugar before baking the cookies.  On the others, we drizzled a confectioners sugar glaze.  Both looked great.  Thanks for a great recipe, Laria.

I think this is the easiest roll out cookie recipe I've ever used - and they taste pretty good too!  Be sure to take the cookies off of the cookie sheet while they're still warm.  Otherwise, if they are cooled and stick to the cookie sheet, they'll break up when you try to take them off.

This dough is comparable to chocolate chip cookie dough when not baked.  I repeatedly tried to roll the chilled dough out but it always got stuck, even with wax paper.  What finally worked for me was chilling the dough, pulling out and rolling 1/4 in thick between two wax sheets, chilling the dough again for an additional 3-5 minutes and then finally cutting out and transferring to the cookie sheet.  I was literally making cookies for 3 hours because I had to constantly chill the dough and could only make 6 cookies at a time (3 whole cookies).  Now to rate the actual cookie itself.  I'm only halfway fond of this cookie.  I used jam in place of the frosting and maybe that's what the problem is, but I was trying to do a nut-free (type of) linzer cookie.  Maybe my efforts failed.

We made these cookies in Christmas shapes as Christmas gifts, and they were great! I was afraid the almond extract would make them taste funny (since it was an unfamiliar smell) but it gave them a nice sweet taste and I'm really glad I didn't omit it. They're a very crisp cookie, and be sure not to let the baking paper (we used parchment) bunch up on the sides of the cookie sheets, as it might cause the cookies to bake in weird shapes. Also, we used powdered sugar to roll them out with, and it made a nice sweet dusting on them.

This recipe worked great in a food gun, and no need to chill. and decorated with just some coloured sugar before I baked them was perfect, not at all too sweet, and everyone in the house just loved it. I will be adding this one to my collection.

Excellent recipe. Very eash to work with. I used powdered sugar to roll it out. Work the dough quickly and roll lightly. I did not have any problems with it sticking to the rolling pin, nor did I need to refrigerate the dough.

I found this recipe to be harder than I thought.  The dough was very hard to work with, it kept sticking and it was hard to transfer the shapes to the cookie pan.  I had to refrigerate it for an hour or two before I was able to work with it.  However, these cookies are very yummy and turned out great, but I wouldn't put the effort into making them again.

Very pretty presentation.  I made all the cookies 1 large size, and used a sharp knife to cut out heart shapes in the middle of half of the cookies before baking.  The turned out nicely shaped (see photo if you like) - so no need for 2 complimentary sized cookie cutters.  I used pink frosting to frost the tops of some and added red sprinkles; others I used strawberry jam in the middle w/ frosted tops; other strawberry jam without frosting tops.  All of them looked lovely.  As far as taste- just ok.

I followed the directions exactly and found that the dough was a little difficult to work with. I even let the dough sit in the fridge for 2 hours and it was still very sticky. I made the heart shapes with jam filling and star shapes with Nutella filling. This recipe was still very good.

I omitted the almond extract and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract instead.  I chilled the dough for 2 hours before cutting out hearts with star-shaped centers.  The cookies do spread quite a bit in the oven so make sure to place them far apart on the cookie sheet.  I made my cookies larger so I ended up baking them for about 10-12 minutes.  I spread strawberry jam on half the cookies and sprinkled confectioners' sugar on the other half before sticking them together to make a sandwich.  The cookies look so pretty and taste wonderful.  Perfect for Valentine's Day!  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

These were soooo Good! I did take some of the suggestions given. I chilled the douch for a little bit first. I also stuck to two cookies together with red rasberry jam but before I stuck them together I dusted the top cookie with powdered sugar first. They came out professional looking, and I am definetely not a "cook". But I do "eat" and I was quite pleased.

I made these the other day for my daughter's Valentine party.  I loved how easy it is to work with this dough.  The cookie has a nice texture as well.  We did not fill them we just frosted them and they were perfect.

This was a GREAT recipe!!! I used it to make Easter cookies (just different shapes than hearts).  I also found the dough to be a little tough to work with, but took others' advice and worked flour into it when I rolled it out, then used powdered sugar with the second batch.  I also used a powdered sugar/lime juice/milk glaze and sprinkled colored sugar crystals on top! I would have posted a picture but the cookies disappeared too fast!! Thanks for this recipe!

Way to sticky to make any cutouts. Instead I just made them like drop cookie and my husband really liked them. I even added some chocolate chips in about half and they were just as good.

I liked the flavor of this cookie. However it was a bit difficult to work with and I've been making cookies for 50 years! I did not make the sandwich because I didn't get 17 of each cookie as the recipe stated. So I melted some German chocolate and dipped each cookie in on one side. I put red food coloring in the batter so the pink cookie with a chocolate edge was perfect for a valentine!

These are so good!  I make these sugar cookies year-round and frost with any kind of store-bought frosting.  I like the heart cut-out idea too.  They make cute edible Valentines.

Yummy cookie, one I'll be making to send to a friend in Iraq...for those who are looking to make the frosting red, I'd suggest using gel coloring instead of the food coloring you use to dye eggs--the gel stuff will not make the frosting runny and will produce a much more intense coloring with just a tiny amount.

This is such a good basic sugar cookie recipe! Everyone absolutely LOVED them! The plain sugar cookie was out of this world, and as sandwiches it was pretty ok -- i rly would suggest using raspberry preseves instead of the frosting, or at least mixing a lot fo the preserves with the frosting. It makes it taste sooo good. My cookies were HUGE, but it was ok, because they tasted so good! Using the size cookie cutter suggested would be a good idea though. These really dont need to be made into sandwiches - i find them rly good when spread with melted chocolate, and then aloow that to harden as a form of icing. Delicious!!!! The dough needs to be refrigerated, and if it starts to rip when u roll it out (in confectioners sugar, yum), it means ur probly rolling them too thin, so stop!

I made a double batch for my daughter's first grade Valentine's day party.  These cookies are delicious all by themselves.  I used store bought frosting and tinted it pink as someone else suggested.  The frosting is just a bonus to a REALLY good cookie.  I did have to refrigerate the dough to work with it though.

I was making these cookies with my toddler for her preschool class and wanted to make the preparation easier, so I just did two 3" heart cookies sandwiched with store bought frosting.  I just added red food coloring to the frosting and sprinkled the cookies with red sprinkles before baking them and they turned out great.  The dough was very easy to work with.  Even my 4 year old could roll out the dough and handle it with ease.  Great recipe!

I have been looking for a good tasting and easy to make cut-out recipe for at least the past 5 years, I have FINALLY found it!!  I never found a recipe that produced consistent results until now-this recipe was perfect: easy to mix up, handles well and the flavor and texture of the cookie is wonderful.  I haven't even frosted them yet and half the batch is gone-we have all been enjoying them!  What a great recipe, thanks so much for sharing.  Thanks to you, I will finally have made cute and EDIBLE cut-outs for Christmas!

I used :
-powdered sugar to roll it out, making the dough a lot sweeter by the end.  
-marshmallow fluff with red food gel to make a pink filling under the stawberry jam.
-the "royal icing I" from this site to make the streaks on top.  
-he rest of the icing (pink by mixing in red gel) on the small cookies.

Didn't have to refrigerate the dough at all.  I did find though that the small cutout hearts were too flimsy to pull out and then cook.  I rolled them back in and cut them over again.

These were a terrific v-day gift for my son's preschool teachers.

These were awesome!!! I will be making these every year!  Used seedless raspberry jam for the filling and rolled out the dough between parchment paper (which I left the cutouts on and slipped onto the cookie). No need to chill the dough using parchment paper either.  Professional looking cookies.  Thanks much for the recipe.

These tasted fine and rolled out easily enough but did not hold their shape.  I doubled the recipe (exactly) and believe 2 teasp soda/cr of tartar was too much! They were cake-like.  If you are looking for clean cut-outs to decorate, choose something else.

Yummy.  Make sure the dough is refrigerated, or else it's too hard to work with.  I used both fruit preserve and frosting, and preferred the fruit preserve on the cookie.

This recipe was so easy!  I made it for my boyfriend in the Army and he loved it!  Everyone was so impressed they thought I had purchased it rather than made it.  I used a white frosting and put red food coloring in it.  I couldn't get a red color but it came out dark pink.  Delicious!

Great basic cookie recipe! And the cookies look professionally made. The powdered sugar makes for a smooth, light consistency. Not the easiest or quickest recipe -- made them the night before my daughter's class party. The dough was a little dry and tough to roll. Used store-bought icing tinted pink and drizzled decorator icing from a tube on the tops. Omitted the almond extract -- still great. I had no problem getting 20 cookies out of this recipe by incorporating the small heart cutouts back into the dough. Thanks!!

I tried several sugar cookie recipes and this is the best.  I'm glad I didn't omit the almond extract.  I am making these for school valentine parties.  The frosting hardened up nicely and looks so pretty. The dough is soft so I cut it directly on the cookie sheet.  Took 10 minutes to bake. This is a keeper recipe in my book.  Thanks, Laria.

THESE ARE AWESOME! Thanks sooo much Laria!! Very easy to make, and VERY delicious!! They are also great as plain cookies if you do not have time to make the sandwiches...although the heart sandwiches are SOOO adorable and easy to make. I bought some white, fluffy whipped frosting which was really good with the cookies.

I cooked mine for about 1 minute less so that they were a bit softer - YUMMY!!! I will DEFINITELY make these again!!!

These cookies (with the almond extract) were DELicious!!!  I had to put the dough in the fridge in between the rolling, otherwise I couldn't peel the cookies off the rolling surface.  I used the icing from the Iced Pumpkin Cookies recipe, which worked out great.  THANKS!!

These are so pretty! I had to use a different frosting because the one suggested didn't work for me.  I brought them to work and didn't want anyone to eat them because they look so CUTE!  Oh..and they taste good too..not too sweet ..great with coffee.

I made these for V-day this weekend and wrapped them individually for all of the members of my family.  This is a good sugar cookie recipe because you don't have to wait for dough to chill.  I only rated it as a 3 in easy and quick category because it is a little time-consuming to cut out and you have to be careful when cutting out the "inside" heart....when you pick up the remainder "outside", it is easy to tear it, so you have to take your time.  Also, I only came up with about 12-13 cookies each time I made it, so maybe my cookie cutter was bigger...they made super looking cookies, though.  I frosted it pink on the "under" layer.  Top layer I frosted white and sprinkled with red, and then I assembled them.  I also wonder if a raspberry/strawberry preserve could be used...it would be very pretty for the "under" layer, but I wonder if it would soak into the cookie and make it soggy??  Don't let my comments scare you, though....this was a very good cookie and cute recipe!

I liked it, but the dough was a little dry and brittle to work with. Might add a bit more butter next time.

I'm not a huge fan of sugar cookies but my family and coworkers loved these cookies! I melted some pink candy melts and iced the tops of some of them with that to make it easy. I also cheated and bought a bag of white cookie icing and decorated with that and then red/white sprinkles.  I felt thicker than a quarter inch dough needed more like 8-9 min in the oven.

These were real good, very tender and crisp.  I put pink sprinkles over the top cookies and small ones, and spread raspberry jelly between the top and bottom cookie.

These were great.  I didn't use frosting but used seedless raspberry jam in between the layers.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on the side that was cut out before I sandwiched them together so I didn't get the sugar on the jam.  Very pretty and quite a good cookie.  The dough was a bit crumbly but I had made the mistake of putting it in the fridge for about 1/2 hour.  It didn't need any refrigeration and I was able to knead the dough a few times to help it hold together.  Rolling and cutting out was a snap.  This cookie did not need frosting!  Will make again!

Definitely more flour is needed for the dough to be pliable and not sticky. I used 400gr at least. Instead of baking soda and cream of tartar, I used 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt. I followed the "Sugar Cookie Icing" and the result was awesome!

I like the simple ingredients in this cookie. The recipe doubles well. I refrigerated too long which was a pain, I rolled in icing sugar. Frosted with "All Natural Pink Frosting" coloured and flavoured with strawberries. Who needs artificial anything! The cookies and cut outs only need 4-5 minutes. Thank you!

I followed suggestions and just used more vanilla extract.  I also used raspberry jam as the filling, not icing.  Overall a great cookie, not too sweet.  Everyone loved them.  I also used the dough recipe for hamantaschen at Purim.

This is one of the best-tasting roll out cookie recipes I have ever made. . . my co-workers and family loved them, they were gone by the end of the day!  I would chill the dough before rolling for an easier time.

This is indeed a great sugar cookie recipe.  BEWARE though, the icing recipe is too salty..  only add 1/8 tsp rather than 1/2..  i'm not even sure you need salt.   It was easy to prepare.. make sure your dough is cold before rolling out to cut.  (a couple of hours in the fridge beforehand)

This is my new favorite cookies recipe!!  They were outstanding!  I did not make them into sandwich cookies, but I did make them into heart cutouts and sprinkled them with colored sugar before baking.  The recipe seemed to make a lot so I still have 1/3 of the dough in the freezer and will make shamrock cookies soon for St. Patrick's Day.  Thanks so much!!

This is by far, the most successful cut-out cookie recipe for me!  This recipe makes delicious and professional looking cookies.  One suggestion is keep the portion of the dough, that you are not currently working with, well chilled.  I was generous with the use of flour on my rolling pin and mat without drying out the dough.  I will keep this recipe as my one-and-only cut-out cookie recipe.  YUMMY !

This recipe definitely took a long time to make, and the dough was really hard to work with... but the end product was good.  It also didn't make 17 sandwiches... more like 12.  I used pink frosting for the "under" layer and white for the top, sprinkled with red sugar.  Very tasty and good for Valentine's Day office treats!

An excellent recipe.  The cookies are crisp and light, even when the dough is rolled out several times.  Use real butter and vanilla so these simple cookies keep their rich flavor.  I mixed the icing in a food processor so the powdered sugar was contained.  Very easy and good.

This is a GREAT recipe for sugar cookie cutouts.  Dough is easy to work with, flavor and texture are great!!  I did put the dough in the fridge for about 2 hours before rolling and cutting.  I also used the icing recommended by TLBRAN.  Will use this recipe again and again!!

This is THE recipe for the best cut-out cookies ever invented.  Easy enough to make and a dream to cut out!  Thank you:)

I thought these were okay.  They were a lot of work and time for what I thought was supposed to be "easy".  Definetly won't make them when I need treats the next day

These were the HIT of our Homeschool Group's Valentine's day party!  I received more compliments than I can remember.  Will definitely make these again.

Delicious Recipe!  I made this for my boyfriend for Valentines Day and he loved it!  I frosted some, and pressed in colored sugar in the others.  They're especially good if you roll them out thin and bake them until they are a golden brown.

I tried the recipe with jam instead of frosting and it worked.  I put the top cookie on the bottom one, filled the cut-out space with raspberry jam, and baked it all together... took them to work, and everyone loved them!

I made this recipe, and I was just hoping that it would finally be a "good" one.  Then, I made them, and they were so good. These were the first cut-out cookies I have made that didn't even need icing to taste good!  I think that my favorite part was that you didn't have to chill them first, no wasted time until they were finished!

When I made these cookies, I frosted the bottom cookies with a deep pink icing and frosted the top cut-outs with a white icing sprinkled with pink sugar.  I then sandwiched the two parts together. I frosted the small heart cut-outs with the deep pink icing.  Everyone loved them and they looked beautiful.
