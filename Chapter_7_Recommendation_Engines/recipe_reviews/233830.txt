Three slight tweeks: 

1)any brand of rice (following cooking directions for brand)
2)add Tabasco sauce for an extra kick
3)lastly, if someone can't eat corn (or if you have some extra bell peppers) dice up an additional bell pepper or two and add them to the mix with the salsa and rice.

These were delicious!  Only complaint is that it made too much for four peppers.  I did add additional veggies (diced up tops of peppers , mushrooms) and I swapped out the rice with cauliflower rice! Very low cal!  We used the extra stuffing with tortilla chips!

Pretty good- definitely needs to cook longer than 20 minutes though. Next time I will also melt the cheese before serving.

This turned out really well. The recipe is off when it comes to measurements for the filling, we ended up with way too much. I also added more spice to make the dish more interesting and flavourful. Also, this doesn't keep well, so make enough for only one meal.

Easy recipe! I decided to make this dish low carb though by substituting 2 cups of riced cauliflower for the rice. Trader Joe's has a convenient frozen bag that I keep on hand but you can easily make your own. The only other additions that I made were adding a teaspoon of Ancho Chili powder to the meat mixture and I poured an 8 oz can no salt added tomato sauce to the bottom of the dish before baking it.
