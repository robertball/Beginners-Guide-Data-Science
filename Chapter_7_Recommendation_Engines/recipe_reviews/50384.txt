Very good and so easy!  I added some garlic and a little cumin and cayenne as well as sauting a few cloves of garlic with the onion.  We like things spicy so I used medium salsa and it was perfect 'heat'.  Used a cheddar/jack mix for a little more flavor.  We all enoyed these as burritos very much.

This is a very easy dish and a great addition to any recipe box.  I have made this for certain guests that we have over and it is often requested from return visitors.  I highly recommend especially for people with little time on there hands.

This recipe defiantly needs some help, otherwise it's just salsa and chicken. Not very appealing. First off, I added some finely crushed garlic to my onions for frying. I also added some fresh chopped chilies to fry also. It really bring the taste out, but be careful not to add too much if you don't like it spicy. When adding my shredded chicken to my onions. I stirred that around for awhile before adding the salsa to bring the flavor to the chicken. Before leaving it to simmer, add some ground cumin and coriander. And taste it to see if it needs any cayenne powder. About half way through simmering add some black beans. And last but not least, toast your flour tortillas. I put mine in the toaster and turned out Excellent! Don't forget your sour cream, and enjoy. I will defiantly make again! My Husband Loved it!!!

The whole family liked this recipe, howeveer, I did make a few changes.  When I cooked the chicken, I cooked it in chicken broth instead of water.  I also followed the advice of some of the previous reviews and added garlic and fresh chopped jalapeno to my onions.  I added the chicken and the picante sauce and spiced it up with some ground cumin and salt and I added a can of black beans (YUM).  When I served this I put it into a big bowl and added fresh chopped cilantro for flavor and garnish.  I served it with warm flour tortillas and spanish rice.  I think that next time I will try this with a jar of taco sauce instead of the picante sauce and add my own green and red peppers.

I took others suggestions and added garlic, green peppers, and some spices. We had the mixture over tortillas. Overall a good dish but nothing spectacular. Nice because all of the ingredients are generally on hand.

My husband loves Mexican Food so I'm always trying new recipes on him.  He usually dispells them.  BUT, he LOVED this one. So great and so easy to make.  I made the chicken the night before so when I got home from work it was a quick one skillet meal!!

This was sensational. I served it in a tortilla with cheese, like a burrito, and it was so much better than my standard cubed chicken burritos. My DH loved it, too, especially as leftovers the next day. The flavor was just different enough to make it really stand out from other chicken dishes. Thanks for sharing this recipe Marylou.

Delicious!  A must try....I added chopped jalapenos and a can of black beans.  So great, there weren't leftovers, so I had to make it again - twice in one week!

This was an excellent recipe, and very easy.  I used hot salsa as we like things spicey. I baked the filled tortillas for 15 minutes or so after topping with reduced-fat cheddar cheese.

I had to omit the salsa altogether for this recipe--due solely to the fact that my 4 yr old loathes salsa.  Instead I seasoned the chicken with some taco seasoning, and added the salsa to mine and DH's food, seperately.  It was really good!  The olives are a very nice touch, something I would never had thought to add.

this was pretty good. it kind of just tasted like a chicken taco. i added some spices though, because other people had commented that it just tasted like chicken and picante sauce. but i thought that it was pretty tasty. it kind of took a long time to cook for the end result just to be alright. it wasnt nothing to write home about. i might make it again. i liked the fact that i had everything already to make it.

It was fast and easy to make! I added a few ingredients myself to give it a spicy taste and my husband loved it(he's from Louisiana and I'm Latin American). I added green peppers, mushrooms, a tad of cilantro, some creole seasoning and hot sauce. It was so good. I will definitely be making this again!

This was so good!  I doubled it because of the size of our family and added a can of green chilies and then spiced it up with a couple of tablespoons of some hot Taco Bell taco sauce.  I used warmed corn tortillas instead of flour and oh my gosh!  They tasted great!  My husband ate tons and told me we need to have it once a week!  To top it off, it was quick and easy especially since I keep cooked shredded chicken on hand in the freezer!  Thanks Marylou!!

Chicken cooked in salsa.  Yep, that's what it tastes like.  I guess I somehow thought this would taste like something different, but it is what it is!

Yummy!! We use this recipe for our chicken tacos.  I halved the recipe and since I didn't have an onion or a jar of salsa on hand, I used a can of mexican style Rotel.  Also cooking the chicken this way kept it really moist and tender--perfect as a taco filling. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good.  Used Taco shredded cheese instead of Monteray Jack to give extra flavor.  Served with refried beans and spanish rice on the side, but these are also good inside.  Added sauteed sliced onion and green pepper, and ate like a burrito.  Will make again!!!!

This was ok. I am a big fan of mexican, we eat something mexican almost every other night. But this is pretty much a mix of the spices that I use for taco meat, so it was nothing special. I think I will just have to stick to my way, which in my opinion is easier and tastes much better.
