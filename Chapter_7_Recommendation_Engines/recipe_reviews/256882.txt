I made this substituting minced onion for chopped onion, I covered slices of deli sliced ham with the dip and rolled them up. Very good for low carb appetizer.

Too salty! Great taste doesnâ€™t need additional salt cut saltiness with Greek yogurt or sour cream!

I made this recipe and loved it!! I took a suggestion from another review and left out the salt (I am not a salt lover) and used approximately 2/3 block of cream cheese and the rest with 1/3 cup Greek yogurt. No one will ever know you used Greek yogurt. It was incredibly creamy and 'the struggle was real' to put in the refrigerator to chill for an hour. Yum!!

Took this to a family lake gathering this weekend that included several pickle lovers . . . it was a huge hit! I did use fresh dill (triple the amount vs dry) as others had suggested, left out the salt and other than the juice on the cutting board, did not add any additional pickle juice, next time I will add the extra juice per the recipe. It was a refreshing taste and we all liked it best with Triscuit crackers, a definite keeper (even the 19 year old asked for the recipe).

Used fresh dill instead of dry. Chopped very finely and increased quantity.  Also added a touch of sour cream for softer consistency.  Topped with a little finely chopped dill. A keeper !

I made it as written, except I substituted 1/2 fresh dill.   I did find it a bit strong for my taste, and a bit watery.  I will reduce the amount of juice next time, and consider substituting some greek yogurt for some of the sour cream.  Yield was a little over 2 cups.  Overall, pretty  good.
