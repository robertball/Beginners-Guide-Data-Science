This dip was dry.  I spread it in an 8" cake pan to bake it and it wasn't thick enough.  I would double the recepie or put it in a smaller baking dish next time.

This recipe was excellent!!  It was so quick and easy.  I didn't use the horsereadish though (didn't have any on hand).  It still turned out great.  Next time I might use a little more hot sauce though.  Can't wait to make it again.

This, as written was just ok, nothing special so I added about a tsp. of Srirachia and made crab and avocado quesadillas and they were a huge hit.

I wouldn’t make this again.  It didn’t have much flavor so I added a 2nd can of crabmeat. I thought this made it such that you knew you were eating crabmeat, but it was bland none-the-less.
