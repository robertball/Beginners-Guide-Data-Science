I don't typically make many recipes using prepackaged sauces due to the sodium content, but, I needed a quick meal I could make and my husband is a big bbq chicken fan, so, I thought I would give it a try.   The plus to the recipe is that the instructions are spot on and it was a quick and easy meal to get together.   The downside was that the sauce was very sweet due to the quantity of applesauce added to the bbq sauce.   I also was hoping that the sauce would become sticky on the chicken, but, it remained more of a sauce instead.
