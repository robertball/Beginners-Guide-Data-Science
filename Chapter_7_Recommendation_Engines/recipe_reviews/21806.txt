I used chicken instead of pork in this recipe, then I added it to the Sweet and Sour Chicken Meatballs recipe that I found here in allrecipe.com and we LOVED it!  I turned out wonderful! :)

This is a very easy, very tasty recipe! I added a scrambled egg to the mixture and left over BBQ pork tenderloin, yummy! My husband and I will have this often.

Very yummy.  Reminds me a lot of the pineapple fried rice we had in Thailand.  Definitely a keeper.
