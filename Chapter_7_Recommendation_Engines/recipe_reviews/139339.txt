I would have given this recipe 5 stars but I did have to do some additions of my own.  With the extra's I have to admit this dish is going into "my favorete's" recipe book.  First, I didn't have any peanut oil or Thai chili's so I used 2 tbsp sesame oil and 3tbsp. of sweet chili sauce instead.  As for the garlic it sounded like a bit much so I just used 5 large cloves minced. The additions where 1/2 green pepper sliced, 1/2 red pepper sliced, 1/2 white onion sliced, 2 carrots peeled/ julienned, and 1/2 lime zest/juice which were added before the basil and allowed to cook coverd on med-low heat for about 5-10 mins. Since I did add these extra's I also upped the amount of soy sauce to 3 tsp. and the fish sauce to 3 tbsp.  Served with Jasmine rice and garnished with lime wedges and green onion.  Sooo good.  I think I will stay home for Thai more often.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Per other reviews, I made the following changes:  in place of peanut oil, used sesame oil, used about 5 cloves of minced garilc, used lean ground turkey in place of the ground chicken, used 3T of sweet chili sauce in place of the Thai chiles, 3 teaspoons of lite soy sauce, 3T of fish sauce, used the juice of 1/2 a lime, sliced up 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 onion, and julienned 2 baby carrots.  Next time I will add more basil since it does shrink up a lot, and if you like it spicy add some red pepper flakes to taste.  Excellent!

I went to lunch at a Thai restaurant the other day and my friend ordered this dish.  She let me taste it and I wished I had ordered it.  This recipe came very close in flavor to the restaurant's.  I didn't have any Thai chiles on hand, so I used jalapenos.  Also added some ketsap manis, and some bok choy, just because we love it.  I really liked this dish but it was a bit too hot for my husband.  He didn't think he would like ground chicken and was surprised to find that he did.  I will make this again, but will tone down the heat.

This was fantastic!  I wondered about it, but decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did.  My husband especially loved it.  I had dried (from the garden) basil, but it was still excellent.  What a switch for a meal!  The basil, chicken, and other spices just blend so well together.  I don't think using ground pork or beef would give it the same flavor and character.  If you have some ground chicken, take a chance on this one!

Very yummy! I made minor changes to suit what i had on hand. I used ground turkey instead of chicken, I didn't have the thai peppers, so I used Lee Kum Kee Chili pepper sauce. I added some shredded cabbage as I was sauteeing the garlic...it was a great addition! We ate this in lettuce wraps.This would be great in potstickers also. Great base recipe! I would highly recommend!

I subbed 2 TB diced jalapenos for the thai chiles and added a tsp of thai chile paste.  Only had a little fresh basil around, so I supplemented that with cilantro. Turned out great (3* HOT) and served on a bed of cabbage, it tasted like "larb gai."

Submitted this recipe.  I appreciate all the positive reviews and suggestions.  I did not include any vegetables in the recipe, because it usually does not come that way in the restaurant, but I do like the addition.  I use any peppers available, subbing jalepenos out of the garden at times.

I was not sure we could pull this off sucessfully with the limited ingredients we had, but regular soy sauce and sweet thai chili sause worked great and we put it on a bed of baby spinach borrowing the idea of wraps from the other reviewer.  Smelling like garlic is worth it for this one.

This was GREAT!! I had some extra ground chicken in the fidge and basil outside. I used it as a filling for lettuce wraps. I also used chili sauce since I didn't have the peppers. It was perfect for a warm Saturday!

Thanks, this was so easy and tasty. I was worried about the heat from the nearly raw sliced Thai chilies so I added them to the hot oil whole and left them in to cook until the end. You can take them out any time during the cooking if you like, or use fewer than 12. I used the orange ones which I believe are milder than the green chilies. Still came out nicely hot. You may not want to eat them whole - too hot! Family member made that mistake. Had no peanut oil so used 1 TBSP grapeseed oil in my nonstick wok and at the end added a little sesame oil as suggested by other reviewers. I did add some sliced yellow bell pepper and 1 inch white pieces of  green onion (scallion) to the hot oil at the beginning as well, for more veggies. I added the sliced green parts of the onion with the basil at the end. I also stirred in some sweet chili sauce at the end and a splash of limeade (no fresh limes around). Hubby says this is a keeper recipe! Next time will try to buy Thai basil as reviewers say it makes it really authentic tasting. Didn't know there was a difference!

This was quite good, and quite quick and easy to make. Made this because we just bought a potted Thai basil plant; Thai basil is not the same plant as regular basil, and this recipe will not taste authentic without it. Note too that "black soy sauce" is NOT the same as regular soy sauce, but more like ketjap manis (thick and sweet).

I don't usually rate a recipe until I've made it as written, however I had to post. I just got through making and eating this dish and it was spectacular. I didn't have the thai chilis so I used about 2 tsp of sriracha... it was amazing. I served over buckwheat noodles... this is going in my recipe box!

This was delicious!  I only used four chiles, so it was spicy, but not Thai spicy.  A great addition to a Thai inspired meal.

Wow, this was delicious and a new favorite!  I had to make a few substitutions since the store had no Thai chiles I used another person's suggestion and subbed 3 Tbsp Thai chile paste (sambal oelek).  I also added some sliced baby bok choy and chopped red pepper before the basil, watering down the sauce with a tablespoon of water to allow the veggies to cook a bit.  But otherwise I followed the recipe as written - peanut oil, 1/4 cup garlic, and all.  I've been eating leftovers for lunch every day and looking forward to my meal!

Good, but ours was very salty and rather bland.  Rather than follow the recipe, I think I would 'wing it' if I tried it again.

Ate it like a taco, with lettuce as the shell. I used jalapenos instead of thai chiles, sesame oil instead of peanut oil and ground turkey instead of ground chicken. Also, I had some homegrown cabbage that needed using so I shredded that and added it with about 1/3 of an onion, minced. This really was fabulous! Yummy and really healthy! Try it! :)

I liked it but didn't love it. It definitely needs Thai basil, not regular basil. The sauce was good. I served it with book choy, stir fried, which I recommend.

Added juice of one lime, handful of chopped wild onion tops, julienne of half a carrot and a couple of baby bell peppers to the original recipe. With these additions, it's a 4 star recipe. Thank you Valery K.

This was sooo good! Like the other reviewers I used sesame oil and lime juice. I also added a large minced shallot, and two dried minced Thai chilis. I only used 2 tsp fish sauce. I finished it off with some ground cayenne to up the heat. Delish!!

The key to this recipe is making sure you use thai basil, not regular basil. I doubled the basil, fish sauce and used ground chili paste in place of the chilies. I also crushed up peanuts and sprinkled on top. Delicious!

This was really good. I added an onion and a slivered carrot, as well as a bit of ginger. Served it over nappa cabbage cooked with a Japanese inspired sauce and some buckwheat noodles.

Easy!  I would recommend using low sodium soy sauce or Braggs Liquid Amino (tastes just like soy sauce!) if salt is an issue.  I have Asian Fish sauce, which is probably salty on it's own and regular soy sauce is salty.  So I will take my own advice next time.  That would be my only complaint, if you can call it that!

I didn't add the Thai chiles, instead I used Red Chili Dipping Sauce for some heat.  I didn't have peanut oil, instead I used Veg Oil.  Included to this dish are sauteed shallots, onions and mushrooms (did this in a seperate pan), squash and zucchini.  Once the rice was cooked, I added it to the wok to coat w/ black soy sauce and all the other delicious flavors!!!!  This is the 2nd time I've made this dish and will continue to make it.  Next time, I'll add SHRIMP.

This is a great recipe- my husband says it's his favorite dish I make.  I subsitute ground turkey for the ground chicken b/c it's all my grocery has been selling for a while, and I think it actually adds more flavor.

I followed some of the recommendations based on other reviews: I used sesame oil instead of peanut oil and added lime juice and zest at the same time as the soy and fish sauce. I also cut both the soy and fish sauce in half and found it still a bit salty. Overall very tasty...I would make it again with these modifications.

This is delicious and quick! I made several changes and this is now one part of my regular repetoire. First, I sautee half of a sliced onion with the garlic (in olive, not peanut, oil before adding the chicken. When the chicken is cooked, I add some veggies (multicolored bell peppers are great, as are bags of frozen organic green veggies) with the chilis (sometimes I use a jalepeno. If you add the basmati rice to the pan and mix it all together, you get the Thai version of Louisiana dirty rice.

A tasty dinner you can have on the table in a jiffy!  As per other reviews, I used a sweet chili sauce and some hot sauce in place of the chili peppers.  I also added a handful of bean sprouts and some green onion for added crunch and color.  My husband and I enjoyed this very much over steamed rice.

I used chili paste as that was all I had and cut back on the garlic a bit. I served it with the Chickeny Chickeny Rice from this site. It tasted so good, but my partner asked where the veggies were! Whoops. Next time I will serve it with the same rice but maybe add some corn, spring onion and celery.

Instead of chiles, I used about half a bottle of Thai sweet chile sauce.  Also, I didn't use any fish sauce and instead of basil I added cilantro.  Very delicous!

We ate it in lettuce cups which was perfect to balance with the saltiness. Awesome. I would like a little more sauce with it though.

This is very good.  I will probably put a little less soy sauce in it next time because it was a little salty for my tastes, but I will definitely make it again!  I do love all Thai food!

Would've give it 5 stars but followed salsamm7 additions, little too much salty fish sauce, would decrease to 2 Tbsp.  kept the 1/4 c garlic, yum, added 2Tbsp  sugar to cut the saltiness and gave it some ground pepper.  It was great!

what an awesome recipe! My favorite Thai dish is Ground Beef Basil, and I have been trying to make it at home several times in vain. When I saw this recipe, I thought this might work with ground beef as well, although one review seemed to think otherwise. I thought to give it a try, and wow, voila, my favorite recipe was born!!! I added 1/4 cup of onions for beef, and used vegetable oil. Used orange & yellow peppers (1/4 cup respectively), used 5 jalapeno peppers instead of Thai Chiles, and increased soy sauce and fish sauce to 3tbsns each. I also added 2tbsns of lime juice. I like it hot, but my husband loves medium, so I added a few more jalapenos for my plate. YUMMY! A restaurant grade!
Love it!!!! Thank YOU!

I really liked this, but I made a lot of changes based on others' suggestions. I substututed chile paste for the chilies and used sesame oil. I added slivered celery, carrots, onion and green pepper and also oyster sauce (couldn't find my fish sauce). Served over rice -- delicious!!

I loved the emphasis of garlic in this recipe. I also added shredded ginger and took out the chilies because my kids are sensitive to their spice. We used lettuce to wrap the meat and the adults just added sriracha sauce (Asian chili sauce) to their wraps.

Really great dish.  I have used serrano peppers as a substitute when my market didn't have thai chilies.  It was better with the thai chilies, but serranos work as well.

Not a bad combo of spices, but for me it seemed as if a lot of the liquid in the soy sauce and fish sauce evaporated and left the dish SUPER salty.

This was delicious!  It's amazing how so few ingredients can make such a favorful dish!  I used the chili peppers and basil right from my garden and added broccoli, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, carrots and mushrooms to make it a filling meal without the rice (a very WW friendly meal!).  I added some lemon grass while cooking down all the veggies and added the juice of one lime when it was done.   I've already made it twice (once with ground and once with cut up chicken breast) to freeze and have ready made lunches/dinners for the next couple of weeks.  So easy and so yummy!    Thank you for a fabulous 'base' Thai recipe!

I just joined this site and I was very excited to try this recipe tonight as my first recipe here. But I must confess that I was a bit under-wowed, sorry. :( It seems a very good attempt, but I have in memory a ground chicken Thai basil that I had a year or so ago that was decidely more *something* than this. I dunno what is missing, though. :( (I hope it isn't just MSG :p ) For one thing, this recipe left my rice/plate/palate a whole lot more dry, so maybe I needed to increase all of the sauce ingredients? I did add a handful of sliced onion and sliced red bell pepper to this, and I didn't want to buy a whole package of Thai chilies that I found so went with one Jalapeno and about 1/2 tsp. of Sambal Olek. The spiceiness worked out okay but the overall flavor was still a little blah and the dish seemed dry overall. I need to revisit the restaurant where I first encountered this dish as *amazing* and try to figure out how it was pumped up. This was a good effort, though, so I thank you for it! :)

This was very good, but way too salty.  (An hour later, I was searching for water)  Possibly less fish sauce?

Great flavor!  I used chicken tenders instead of ground chicken and realized halfway through making that I didn't have fish sauce, which would have made it even better.  I did add broccoli florets to steam near the end and served over brown rice.  Everyone cleaned their plates!  I went lighter on the chiles due to the children, but would love the heat for just me and my husband.  Will make again!

only giving this a 4 coz i made so many changes, but this was phenomenal! i added onion at the beginning, as well as zucchini and mushrooms, sliced, and added brown sugar and fresh lemon juice/zest and sriracha to the sauce; used some random hot peppers i had on hand at the end with the basil. and then i used it for lettuce wraps. i'm SO glad i found this - a great way to use up basil and a great base recipe! and easy too! thanks!

Simple, easy and scrumptious.  No changes except leaving out the fish sauce and adding a bit more soy sauce and some water.

Love this..though my husband didn't much care for it.  Served with white rice..and a litle extra fish/soy sauce to flavor the rice.  Didn't have Thai chili's..only habanero's(?) so I use 4 and it was too hot..I'll probably cut this down to 2 next time..thanks so much for sharing!

I've made this recipe several times now.  We always double it because its even better as leftovers!    Per another reviewers recommendation, I used 3 tbsp of sweet chili sauce/lb of meat instead of the the chili peppers and I've added 1 red and 1 green pepper/lb of meat.  It adds great taste and color to the dish.

I would give this 6 stars if possible! I loved the flavors and the heat. The only change I made was adding some green onions to the wok before the garlic.

I couldn't find Thai chiles so I used 2 serrano chiles (seeds and all) and it was the perfect spice.

I think this recipe would be great WITHOUT the fish oil! It was tasty, but the fish oil made it smell like stinky feet, so that wasn’t very appetizing.

I made slight modifications and it was wonderful but I will slightly further modify it next time I make it. Instead of peanut oil I used sesame seed oil, Worcestershire sauce instead of fish sauce, serrano chilies instead of Thai chilies, and added snow peas. I only used six chilies instead of twelve but next time I will use all twelve. I added a little cayenne to add some more heat. And the last thing that I will change next time is the amount of soy and Worcestershire sauce because I would like more sauce to be able to spoon it over my rice.

This recipe is definatly one for the books!! It was my first time eating thai food much less cooking it. I followed some other reviews and made a few changes (not many) and it turned out amazing. I increased the sauce ingredients by adding one portion more of each (i.e. 3T of fish sauce instead of 2T) and then doubled the entire recipe (to feed more people). I also added red bell pepper, a sweet bell pepper, sweet yellow onion, and carrots to give the recipe some color and texture. Finally we served with white rice and lettuce for wraps!! YUM! Will become a regular meal as it only took about 45 minutes from start to finish!!

My family LOVED this. The only changes I made were to use Thai basil, one sliced sautéed onion while cooking the chicken and a squeeze of lime to give it just a slight bit of acid. Using Thai basil makes this very authentic and very good. I made dinner in 20 minutes with a pot of rice and stir fried yu Choy. This is a keeper and will be requested time and again.

Soooooo dee;lish!  I used Mexican green chiles in a can (about 2T), and those little pods of frozen basil from Trader Joes, half a red onion,  dried basil flakes, julienned carrots (already in the bag) and pepper flakes.  I didn't have fish sauce so I just used soy sauce and Tamari.  Also red pepper flakes.  Oh, and sesame oil instead of peanut oil.  YUM!!

Yummy and easy dish! I wanted to use my chopper tool I got from Home Goods so this was a perfect recipe to try out. I've added chopped broccoli into the mix! I didn't add the Thai chilis since I didn't want this to be too spicy so I subbed with a tablespoon of siracha. I'm thinking of putting chopped bell peppers next time!

As good as the one served in restaurants! Had it for dinner last night with my husband and we were happy with how it turned out. We didnt have fish sauce so we just put more soy sauce, and we winged it with the chilis we had so it turned out too spicy but otherwise it's great!

Added 5 baby bok choy, sliced horizontally, cooking stem first then adding leaves last minute. I served this over bean threads (mung bean noodles)soaked in warm water 10 to 15 min rinsing once then drain.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried, and used one 4oz can chopped green chiles. made a nice little soup dish, if you wanted more broth you could add water.

Low carb guilt free except for the sodium.  I use green cabbage for the wrap and about 6 serrano peppers since they were easier to find.  I didn't have basil one time when I prepared this and didn't miss it.  I leave it out now just to simplify the recipe and cut down on ingredients.  Super quick to make also.  I love condiments so I use peanut thai sauce just before consuming.

Good stuff! Took one star off because brown sugar is a crucial ingredient in such a dish, at least to me. I recommend adding the brown sugar and lots of vegetables (zucchini, carrots, onions, red peppers, etc). I also add some kaffir lime leaves, but those are hard to find unless you go to the right market. Top with cilantro and serve over jasmine rice and you've got yourself a quick, amazing meal.

This would be 5-star recipe had it not been too salty.  I think your recipe is right on the dot and I followed it perfectly, but I would like to tell others that you should add about 1/2 cup of water after you add the soy sauce and the fish sauce so that the saltiness is diluted and cook until the water evaporates.  Otherwise, very good and super HOT with the thai chilis (which I love - folks, may want to add only 6 instead of 12 to reduce the heat level).  Good job, Valery K.

Yum, made some changes. I added some cubed carrots, 1 tsp. of chunky peanut butter with olive oil since I don't have peanut oil, and siracha sauce with a bit of sugar since I don't have sweet chili sauce. I didn't have basil either....so yep it still turned out great.

We first made this about a year ago, and it has been in our regular dinner rotation ever since.  It is absolutely delicious, a great use of ground chicken, and is very flavourful and spicy.  I often add other vegetables to it as well (broccoli, beans, carrots, etc.) and serve it over jasmine rice.  Yum!

Excellent recipe--very quick and easy to make.  The ground chicken is flavorful, and in my opinion, much tastier than any ground turkey recipe I've ever made.  I added some fresh ginger for some extra flavor, and it was great!

This is a wonderful recipe!  easy, healthy, and yummy.  I added fresh cilantro on top of the basil to add that refreshing taste. I also added some bok choy because I like veggies in my dishes. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this with ground beef, although not traditionally made with it, and it tasted good. Like other reviewers, I used sweet thai chili sauce. Also, I used crushed red pepper flakes in substition of the thai chilis and added a squeeze of lemon juice. Very simple and easy to make for a quick meal.

How could something so simple and fast be so delicious.  Fell in with the herd and substituted chilis with sweet chili sauce.  This is now my weekday standby - takes less time than KD or heating a pizza for the boys.  I serve it on rice made in the rice cooker or as an Asian lettuce wrap.

I haven't eaten this in a restaurant so have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was very tasty - and quick to prepare, too!  I wasn't sure where to buy Thai chiles in my area, so I substituted 3 fresh, small red hot chili peppers.  My daughter found this amount too hot, but my husband and I would have liked it hotter, so if you use this substitution, you will have to experiment.

First to warn everybody... this is an excellent dish, but your whole house will reek of garlic afterward! That hasn't stopped me yet. Like the others suggested, I used Thai sweet chili sauce. I served this chicken with white rice, with some thinly slices carrots and slivered almonds on top, all wrapped in iceberg lettuce leaves. For leftovers it good in a Stroman's wrap. This dish is a nice break from the norm, sooo worth the smell! lol.

I had high hopes for this recipe from all the positive reviews on site. My husband and I LOVE Thai Basil Chicken and have ordered it many times at Thai restaurants. This was ok, but definitely did not taste like it came from a restaurant as some have stated. I will continue my recipe search and would probably not make this recipe again.

It was a nice, quick recipe. Instead of Thai chili I combined sweet chili sauce and Thai chili sauce. I also added 3-4 tablespoons of peanut butter to the mixture. It taste great! Thanks!

I left out the chiles and added 1 tsp of sugar -- then my kids will eat it too!
