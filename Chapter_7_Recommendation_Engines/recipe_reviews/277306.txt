This had a really nice flavour, but boy, it was hot! (And we generally like spice.) I would add less sriracha sauce to start.

Delicious!! Loved the consistency and different layers of flavor: sweet, spicy, warm, and savory. We will definitely be making this again!!

This was 5 stars! It has some heat, so be careful if you are sensitive. I followed it as written and I found it to be a very simple recipe to make! Thank you Nan!
