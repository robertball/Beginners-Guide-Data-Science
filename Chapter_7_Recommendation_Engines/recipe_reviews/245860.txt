It came out very tasty, but it would not thicken using the double boiler.  I cooked the sugar/corn starch/salt/water mixture in the double boiler for half an hour and it still wouldn't thicken!  I got mad and put it in a regular pot on the stove and it finally thickened up and I continued with the recipe. So don't fret if it won't thicken. Just skip the double boiler!  It tastes great with just the right amount of lemon flavor for me.

I added 2 teaspoons of lemon extract while whisking in the butter and lemon juice which made it taste a lot better. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because I made it taste good but I had to alter the recipe to make that so. Also it came out very soupy.

This is good, but the flavor of the egg yolks peaked through.  I made half the recipe and added the zest of one lemon which I'm glad that I did.  So if you like a strong lemon flavor like I do, I recommend adding the lemon zest.

I followed the recipe and it was perfect and true to direction.    Only I didn’t have a double boiler and put a stainless steel mixing bowl over a pot of water.     Oh.  So happy as it is soooo tasty and just like my mother made when I was a kid.    Hadn’t had it since and That  was a long time ago

The lemon pudding was phenomenal, but there were a few flaws on the way. I used tapioca starch instead of corn starch, the eggs I added appeared to have cooked into little egg bits (I was a bit grossed out at the thought), then the pudding's consistency was a little too thick. Luckily, pouring in a little more water to the final product made normal and absolutely delicious!

If you experience the problems I did, perhaps mixing the sugar with the egg first could help as done in other puddings. Maybe letting the pot cool a bit first before adding the egg?

But overall, this pudding is completely worth making!

I read all the reviews first! I did not use a double boiler just stirred continually. Pudding did thicken up added lemon zest of 2 lemons which I am glad I did. Pudding was good but do not plan on making it again.

Would not thicken, tasted grainy.  Added vanilla, helped a little
