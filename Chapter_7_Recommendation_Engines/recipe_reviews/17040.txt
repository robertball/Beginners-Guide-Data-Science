This is by far the best recipe I've used in quite a while.  I would recommend that you at least partially cook the bacon. I didn't cook it at all before I put it on the chicken and it was a little under cooked for me. I didn't pre-cook the chicken prior to baking and let me tell you...this is the BEST chicken!!  I honestly, cut my chicken breast with a fork!! Very juicy and very moist...EXCELLENT recipe.

I only thought this was okay but my family really liked it.  I mixed the BBQ sauce and mustard together in a small bowl first before lathering it onto the chicken.  Also, DON'T add the cheese until the last 5-10 minutes of baking.  Doing so will avoid the cheese from baking hard onto the chicken breast. A decent and easy meal - esspecially w/ garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.

My family really liked this. I was using really large chicken breasts, so I used only three and cut them each in half. Then I pounded them a little with a mallet. I probably used less bbq sauce and mustard than the recipe called for - and probably half the cheese. At any rate, this was a very easy recipe, even for a Monday night. We put steamed broccoli and a little cucumber salad on the side. Everyone was satisfied. My husband said it was one of the best things we'd had in a long time. Thanks!

Hubby made this for me...I wasn't feeling too well.  I thought that it had too much of a mustard flavor, while hubby really liked.  It was very moist and the cheese and bacon with bbq sauce was delicious.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe was excellent...I made it for my roomates and all of them loved it!!! Made a few changes based on previous reviews...Pre-cooked bacon; mixed BBQ sauce and Mustard then dipped chicken in the sauce.  I also sauted mushrooms, onion and garlic together; then mixed them up with the remaining BBQ/ mustard sauce....I put this on top of the bacon...and didn't add the cheese until the last 10 minutes!!! This recipe is a keeper :)

My husband loved the taste of the easy recipe.  i liked how it didnt take a long time to make.  I marinaded the chicken in vinegar and a meat rub in the fridge for an hour and a half before cooking to really bring out the BBQ flavor.

This was good, more man food than chick food if you'll allow me to stereotype. Very filling and hearty. Watch the chicken though, it really should be cooked through after twenty minutes. Also, wait till the last 10 minutes to add the cheese.

I think it tasted great. I didn't fry it before I baked it and it turned out just fine.

Very good!!! I was a little skeptical with the mustard, but it tasted great.  My picky husband and kids loved it, and they are hard to please.  I will definitely serve it again.

The chicken came out with a great flavor, and was very moist:)  However, following the directions listed, exactly, lead the cheese to be dried out and chewy.  Maybe it was because I used turkey bacon and not real pork bacon.

I've been making this on occasion for some time now.  Boneless chicken thighs are my favorite so I use those. It does need a bit of seasoning though, so I add a bit of fresh thyme and garlic  to the bbq/mustard mixture. I use 2 slices of bacon diced and fried til not quite done. I save 1 tb of the bacon drippings and add 1 tb of butter to the pan when browning the chicken, yeah I like it browned. The combo of bacon fat and butter for browning chicken is incredible. After the sauce coated chicken with the bacon and cheese goes into the oven I make gravy out of the drippings in the frying pan and serve it over garlic mashed potatoes. This is comfort food and even my 9 yr old grandson loves it.

Very good and easy.  There was no need to cook the outside of the chicken in butter.  I fried the bacon until almost done and just put the raw breast meat in a cake pan and brushed with the mustard and BBQ sauce and topped with the bacon.  I baked it for about 20 minutes then put the cheese over the top and baked another 15 minutes.  It was perfect.

I did not pre-cook the chicken before baking but I did cook the bacon halfway. I cooked for 40 minutes and then added the cheese and baked for another 3-5 minutes. My husband and I love this recipe.

Apparently people don't read, it does say in the recipe ingredients, bacon, cooked until nearly crisp.  Just saying!!  Great recipe!! I used Jim Beam mustard and BullsEye BBQ sauce with strong cheddar cheese.  It was awesome!!

Just made this for dinner and it was very good. It was simple to prepare and easy to clean up after. The recipe was a bit confusing because it called for vegetable oil and butter, I chose neither and used olive oil. I also pounded the chicken breasts thin, therefore they were extra tender. The chicken was very tasty, the only complaint I have is that the cheese made it very oily! Next time I will cut the cheese in half. There will still be more than enough!

A good quick recipe. I used honey mustard, and it was a little too 'honey' for us, but still good. A good alternative to a favorite from this site, Smoky Mountain Chicken, which uses lunch meat ham as well.

I really enjoyed this. I 'thinned' the breasts by slicing in half to speed up cooking time. Baked in toaster oven and it turned out good. Served with the Garlic Broccoli from this site and cooked in microwave.

Followed recipe as written, except didn't pre-cook the chicken and added green onions and chopped tomatoes toward the end of baking. Reminds me of my favorite dish at Chili's! Very good and super easy.

I didn't precook the chicken, and waited to add the cheese until there was only about 5 min left, then sprinkled with real bacon bits.  We enjoyed this, it just didn't wow me.

My family of 6 loved this!  Made it tonight with Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and French's mustard.  I didn't measure anything, just poured the sauce on the chicken, squeezed on the mustard, wrapped the bacon (partially cooked in microwave) around the chicken, and put it in the oven without precooking the chicken.  Topped with grated cheddar at the end... Delicious!!  Thanks for a wonderful meal idea!

5 stars for flavor and ease of preparation. I cook my bacon before putting it on the chicken, and I bake the chicken in the oven. The hardest part of this recipe is cooking the bacon!!

Everyone in my family of 6, including a couple of very picky young boys and a husband who usually never eats chicken, loved this recipe. It was super easy and oh so yummy!!! Reminded me of my favorite Outback menu item.  I did not saute the chicken before hand, but did partially cook the bacon before adding it and added the cheese during the last 10 minutes of cooking as suggested by other reviewers. A definite hit in this house!!

Yummy! Pounded and marinated chicken breasts for a few hours before, used waaaaayyyy more bacon and cheese than a person should eat in one sitting, but essentially same recipe (with a little Chalupa hot sauce). Delicious. Family loved it.

very good.  can also be made by adding some chopped scallions and tomatoes.  Also recommend putting sliced cheese at the last 10 minutes.  If no bacon this can also be made with canadian ham slices.  I would also recommend seasoning the chicken breast slightly before cooking in olive oil.

Tried this recipe with just a couple changes and it was awesome. My husband doesn't like chicken but he cleaned his plate! Why cook the chicken in butter and oil first when you have perfectly good bacon grease! I cooked up 5 bacon strips and removed, then let the grease cool down for a few and added 2 chicken breasts, which I had pounded down. Cooked the chicken for a short time until they appeared white not browned in the grease. Placed the breasts on a cookie sheet added a light layer of yellow mustard, thick layer of bbq sauce and 2 strips of bacon on each. Ten minutes before removing from oven I added cheddar cheese and more bacon crumbles on top. Very tasty!!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the tips of previous posters and did not pre-cook the chicken, only slightly cooked the bacon, mixed the bbq sauce & mustard, added the bacon with 15 minutes left and added the cheese with 5 minutes left.
It came out very tender and tasty. We'll definitely be having these again. Thanks for a great recipe and some very helpful reviews!

Really delicious! Even works with legs and thighs with the skin on. Not sure why the recipe says don't brown. I did and it leant a deep rich color. A big hit with my family.

Pretty tasty. I used honey mustard instead of regular and it was good. I followed another poster's recommendation and crisped the bacon in the microwave before putting on the chicken. I made double the sauce because I like a lot. Served with parmesan potatoes. Good leftovers!

This recipe was a tasty easy dinner!  I made a few changes though...I don't really like regular mustard so I used 1/2 honey mustard, 1/2 BBQ Sauce mixed together.  Topped it off with the sauce mixture, precooked bacon strips and let it bake for 20 minutes before putting shredded cheese on for the last 10.  I had to use Mozzarella (didn't have any cheddar) but the results were still great!  My toughest critic approved this recipe!

This is a yummy recipe.  My advice would be to use less BBQ sauce, it was over powering the dish.  Used others suggestions of putting the cheese on the last 5-10 minutes of baking.  I used real bacon bits instead of making the bacon.  It made the recipe easier to make.

I woke up this am to my daily recipe and it could not of been better timing. I am in a total food rut and needed something new. I have picky eaters and this dish seemed like a good chance for something new. Two picky teenagers, picky husband and a even pickier grandchild and I had NO LEFTOVERS. Everyone loved it and it was voted to be in the normal rotation of dinners. I did mix it up a bit, I actually browned the chicken in bacon drippings ( I know not a healthy choice). I seasoned the chicken with a Carribean Jerk spice also. Topped with a very little mustard, coated with bbq sauce and as others noted, added the cheese at  the very end. Chicken was so tender you could cut with fork and the most moist a baked chicken dish could be. Super de-lish will make again.

These were amazing! I marinated my chicken breast in some Italian dressing first and cooked them on the grill.  Those were the only changes made, but this was a fabulous meal and I already have requests to make this chicken again :)

Good, but 1/2 cup of cheese per breast was more than is necessary. I seasoned the chicken before pan frying, and oven baked it in a casserole dish lined with parchment paper.

I loved this and so did my kids!! I did do a few things differently....I put my chicken in the oven raw instead of cooking it a little bit before hand, and I cooked my bacon as suggested by someone and added the cheese at the last 5 minutes. Very tender chicken....will definatly be making this again. Thanks for the recipe and for the helpful reviews.

I thought this recipe was ok. I made it last night for my husband who said he was tired of the same thing. I wasnt really a fan of the mustard, I thought the recipe would have been just fine with bbq sauce. Maybe trying different bbq sauces would be best, like honey bbq or smokey bbq. If i make this again ill probably omit the mustard. I did like that this recipe was easy and I think the browning of the chicken beforehand just dirties another dish so its not reallly necessary. Also I didnt add the cheese and bake it in the oven, instead I took it out of the oven placed a slice of cheddar on each breast then put foil over the top while I made my side dish. It melted the cheese perfectly. Overall a good dish and something different to have.

Very good!  I've cooked this twice; once cooking the bacon before placing it on the chicken, then for the second time I just wrapped the bacon around the breast and let it cook in the oven.  The second time was much better because the bacon didn't taste burnt

I made this for my picky eater kids and they loved it. It was quick, easy and very tasty. Two things I did different were cook the bacon only slightly (I also used 2 slices of bacon per chicken breast) and most importantly is I put the cheese on for only the last 5 minutes of baking so it wouldn't burn.

this recipe was delicious. Even my picky child loved it. One thing i did different was that i lowered the heat in the frying pan, and i used olive oil instead of butter. For all the canadians...i used presidents choice hickory bbq sauce.  I thought the mustard would be awful, but it was great.

Easy set up. I used Canadian Bacon instead with a 3 mixed cheese that included cream cheese for a more creamy cheese on top. Loved making it and most importantly the family loved eating it!

Just cooking for one, so I used the boneless chicken thigh that I had on hand  Mixed BBQ sauce with dijon mustard and put over chicken, bacon and cheese.  Added a couple of tablespoons of whole milk to baking pan.  Added egg for last 10 minutes.  Turned out tender and delicious.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delish! I pounded my chicken breasts and did NOT use mustard. My husband gave the thumbs up that I could make it again. He is not a chicken breast fan. I think the bacon and cheese won him over.

Fantastic!  I put garlic salt on the breasts, cooked the bacon to a crisp state then cooked the chicken in the bacon grease before putting it on the cookie sheet, topped it with sauce, mustard, bacon and cheese then threw it in the oven.  I used large breasts so I cooked chicken 40 mins.

Very good.  I followed the basic directions and it turned out perfect.  I did add mushrooms, used Monterey Jack Cheese  and pre cooked turkey bacon.  I also sliced the chicken breasts in half to make them a bit thinner.  Very good!

Made this for my family. Very easy and quick. I did no measuring whatsoever. I didn't precook the chicken. Laid 5 chicken breasts on foil lined pan. Put a little pepper and garlic salt on them. Then squirted BBQ all over each breast followed by a line of mustard. Laid 1 1/2 slices of precooked bacon on each then baked in the oven for 30 min. Sprinkled cheddar cheese then baked for another 10 min (thick breasts) Served with rice and artichokes. My 3 kids, 5, 9, and 13, loved this dish. They ate every bite on their plates. My husband enjoyed it too.

Very good and easy. I don't know if most people did not read the recipe right, but it says to use 4 pieces of COOKED bacon. Most people on here made comments about needing to precook the bacon first....
Anyway, I only used two chicken breasts, used only 1 tsp of mustard, and waited until 10 minutes before chicken was done to add the cheese. Very good and easy. Will make again.

I loved this recipe!!! It was so easy and tasty. This will be a family favorite from now on. I added more mustard and barbacue sauce then the recipe called for just because it tastes good and makes the chicken moister. I also used Maple bacon,which I cooked first, and added the cheese the last 10 mins of baking. 5 stars from me!!!

I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease ( I know it's not that healthy but every once in awhile you can enjoy) and it was awesome. I followed other reviews and added the cheese the last 10 minutes. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and my husband was raving. What's not to like, he says, you have chicken, bacon and cheese. Thank you for a wonderful,easy recipe.

OMG !! This was sooooo good, not to mention the easiest dish I have made in years !! My husband is very picky & he loved it ! I kept catching him in the kitchen eating more.. I did leave out the mustard, because he can smell it a mile away. I also used precooked bacon & it turned out wonderful !!   One thing did confuse me, the ingredients list 1 tbls. veg. oil, then in the directions it says butter or margarine ? I went with the oil.   Thanks Kelsey !!!

This recipe was fantastic and I will be adding it to the rotation at our house! I cut the breasts into strips, seasoned & marinated them overnight with Tabasco sauce, Chipotle mojo, Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce, and Sazon.  I seared them, then baked them per the recipe and they were juicy and delish! Thanks to the other reviewers who advised to cook the bacon first, and add it & the cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.

This was super easy and very tasty. My husband said it was a keeper! And the kiddos cleared their plates. I did follow a few suggestions by previous reviews... Seasoned chicken with salt and pepper prior to frying, mixed the BBQ and mustard together, probably used half the amount of cheese and waited until last 10-15 minutes to add cheese. Also when I sautéed chicken I used the bacon drippings and a little bit of olive oil.  Very moist! Thanks for the recipe :-)

Easy, fast, delicious weeknight meal.  I did not fry the chicken ahead of time (did not want the added fat from frying in oil) and it was fine after 30 mins. in the oven.  Waited until last 10 minutes to add cheese; I think if you cooked the cheese for 20-30 mins. it would be like a brick.  I will definitely be making this one every week!

I tried this recipe because so many commented on how the men in their lives loved it.  The same was true for my men...they really liked it.  This was a good dish and I will use it often.  One thing that others had said was that the cooking time was longer than was said - I found this to be true also.

This was pretty good, a nice summer dish you can make anytime. I didn't pre-cook the chicken, just lightly seasoned, then mixed the BBQ and mustard together and put on top; cooked bacon until just crisp before baking. I didn't add the cheese until the last 10min or so, then broiled for a min. Turned out good. The juice/sauce was great on mashed potatoes. I will make again. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good and we will certainly make it again.  I did make a few minor adjustments.  We mixed the mustard and sauce together.  I thought the mix tasted a little bland so I added a tsp of sugar and a heavy dash of garlic powder before coating the chicken.  We skillet cooked the chicken in the bacon grease which cut down dramatically on the oven time.  Only about 20 mins. in the oven after 10 mins. in the pan (and these were pretty large breasts).  Like other reviewers, we waited till the last 10 mins. to add the cheese and bacon.  In addition to keeping the cheese and bacon from over cooking, it allowed the sauce to crisp up on the chicken.

I have been trying different chicken recipes because at the age of 60 I am sick of everything I have cooked for the past 40 years! This one is a little too much fat for me but it was ok for a change. My grandaughter thought it was great. For her it had all the best food groups, chicken, barbeque sauce, cheese and bacon! Makes me gain weight just thinking about it.

5 Stars all the way.  Delicious and sooooo easy to make.  I used chicken tenders and used one slice of bacon cut in half for each.  I cooked them in a pan as the recipe called for and then they only took 20 minutes uncovered to cook perfectly.  The last 2-3 minutes I put them under the broiler set on low to crispen the edges of bacon and make the cheese all bubbly and gooey.  Served with simple mashed potatoes.  A definite winnder.  Next time I'll likely serve a lighter side like some sort of salad or steamed veggies. I think the potatoes were a little to heavy for this heavy of a main dish.  Great recipe.  Thanks for the post!

This was easy and good.  I put in a baking dish and covered it with foil to avoid the cheese drying out as others had mentioned - it was tender and juicy.

YUM!!! I did as another said and mixed the BBQ sauce and mustard together. Instead of waiting to add the cheese, I put the cheese on first then the bacon. With about 15 minutes to go, I added more cheese. I also added some diced jalapenos and it added a nice bite to it.

I don't know if I should be annoyed or delighted that something this easy can be so tasty! I followed others' advice and left the cheese off until near the end of the cooking time. I used a thick slice of extra-sharp Cheddar instead of grated because it is much less messy, and it melts down more evenly. Husband especially enjoyed it, served with a pile of his beloved waffle fries. Thanks so much, Lyndell!

My husband loved this.  I mixed the BBQ sauce and mustard together, and added the cheese in the last 10 minutes - both previous reviewers' ideas.  Also, I used that pre-cooked bacon, which is pretty thin, so I ended up using 2 pieces per breast.  I'm going to heat leftovers with more BBQ sauce and serve them as sandwiches.

I used bone in thighs. I didnt fry the chicken first. That was probably a mistake. Next time i wont cook the bacon first, my bacon burnt in the oven. It had really good flavor, and i will most definately make again.

OK. I don't know whether it was my fault or the recipe, but the chicken was very dry. Maybe if I marinated it first?

Super tasty and easy.  I did mine all in one pan.  I cooked the bacon in an ovenproof fry pan and placed it on a paper towel lined plate.  Spooned off all but about 2 tsps of bacon fat, then browned the chicken in the fat.  Removed from the heat and kept chicken in the fry pan, then topped with mustard and BBQ sauce.  Baked for 10 mins, removed from oven and topped with bacon and cheese, then baked for about another 8 mins.  Let it rest for a few mins and grubbed.  NOTE: if you choose the one-pan method, MAKE SURE your pan is OVENPROOF.

Easy to make recipe.  I cooked the bacon for 10 minutes in the oven prior to baking it with the chicken and waited for the last 5 minutes of baking before adding the cheese.  I was very good.

Fantastic. I used a honey barbecue sauce and just mixed the mustard into it. The honey in the sauce gave it a really nice sweet flavor that was complemented by the cheese.

Tried this tonight. The skiers were very happy with it as did everyone else! Used a bit less mustard as there were fussy younger eaters and they gobbled it up, too. Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe and very easy. I did not have BBQ so I substituted Jerk Marinade it was fantastic but I think BBQ would be very good also. I used sliced cheese instead of shredded and it seemed to hold everything together nicely!!! Will make again and again

Great recipe.  Kids liked it.  I mixed the bbq sauce with the mustard in a bowl and I did not precook the chicken - didn't really see the point of that.  I also follow the advice of other reviewers and added the cheese in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I think green onions would be good sprinkled on top.

We loved this. I used chicken thighs instead of breast, cooked the chicken using some of the bacon dripping added some garlic and onion powder to the chicken while browning it, mixed the mustard, barbecue sauce (Spicy Baby Ray's) and coated rather than spooning it on top, then added the cheese the last 10 min of cooking.

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and garlic powder when I cooked them in the frying pan.  I followed other reviewers advice and only partially cooked the bacon.  Yummy!!! Will definitely make this again.

Delicious recipe.  We poached the chicken a little and cooked the bacon until semi-done.  We left the cheese off.  Then we baked the chicken as directed and put it under the broiler for the last few minutes to really crisp up the bacon.

I fixed this last night for my family and they LOVED it! I actually fried the bacon until almost crisp, then slightly cooked the chicken in the same pan. I mixed the mustard and barbecue sauce together before I put it on the chicken. Like several people suggested, I didn't add the cheese until the last 10 min. Then I added chopped green onion and tomatoes on the top before serving (like suggested). It was very good!

Everyone in my house liked this recipe. I only had enough bacon to put a half of a strip on each chicken breast. I think it needed the whole strip. Next time I would cut the baking time by about 5 minutes or cut time in the pan. I was just worried about the chicken cooking all the way through because my chicken breasts were thick. It wasn't dry but we weren't able to cut it with a fork like some of the other reviews. I had to make my own bbq sauce last minute because I thought I had some but no. We will definitely be adding it to our dinner rotation.

Wish we could write a review on the recipe and then one on taste.  Loved the taste the recipe itself needs to be changed.  You have Veg oil in the list, but then say butter in the directions.   I really liked the taste.  My entire family really liked it. My husband said it reminded him of Outback's Alice Sprinngs Chicken.

Great recipe. I mixed the bbq sauce with mustard in advance. I ran out of bbq sauce so I added a bit of ketchup to bring it to the recommended measurement. I used maple flavored bacon and pre-cooked it on a george forman grill first. I did not pre-cook the chicken and I used less than the recommended amount of cheese. I baked it for 40 minutes then added cheese and baked for an additional 5 minutes. It turned out good but next time I may try to pre-cook the chicken or bake for less time, it wasn't dry but I think it could have been more moist.

Delicious!  My family loved it!  As recommended by several other reviewers, I precooked the bacon and did not precook the chicken and added the cheese when there was 5 min remaining.

Like someone else said, I added sauteed mushrooms and lightly browned the chicken before baking. DELISH!!  One suggestion: I would add crisply cooked bacon after baking. Otherwise it gets soggy.  Will definitely make again!

This was excellent - a really great flavor.  I used turkey bacon and cooked it until very crisp, then crumbled it.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and black pepper, seared it on both sides in a little olive oil, then put bbq sauce, crumbled bacon and mustard on top and baked it for about 15 minutes which was perfect.  I added the cheese the last 5 minutes just for it to melt.  It was soooo good

This was amazing.  I went with a couple reviews and didnt precook the chicken.  Instead I marinated the chicken in cider vinegar, oil, and some seasoning.  I also used precooked bacon to save a step and it worked wonderful  The kids gobbled it up.

Easy and tasted great.  Followed recipe exactly, including cooking bacon till nearly done beforehand. I sauted chicken in the bacon grease instead of oil or butter was the only change.  Everything was done in 35 min. as chicken breasts where thick.  This is a do over.  Made some potatoe fries with red potatoes dipped in olive oil and shaken in dried onion soup(350 for 30 min)  and a ear of corn.  Yummie

Before cooking the chicken in the skillet, I seasoned both sides with a little salt and pepper. I also mixed the barbecue sauce and the mustard together. It was much easier that way and very tasty. As for the bacon, after cooking it until it was still soft I broke each piece in half and placed two halves across each chicken breast. My family enjoyed this and I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is great for the NEW COOK! Although, I wasn't sure when to add the veg oil, so I brushed it on the chicken before adding the sauces. I did cut the mustard in half ( just personal preference) Next time I'm going to add more BBQ sauce and fully cook the bacon on the range and then crumble it up and add it after I add the cheese ( about 5-10 min before chicken is done) My husband loved it and I added this to my recipe box!

Everything came out great, but it definately needed a little more spice or pazzazz.  Chicken was tasty though, just needed more flavor!

This is one of the few recipes that my husband actually asks me to make. :-) We love it! The chicken comes out just perfectly cooked and juicy. The only thing I did different was use spice brown mustard to give it a little more flavor.

My husband says this one is a keeper!  I left out the mustard and the oil.  I just lightly browned the chicken in the pan I used to cook the bacon.  I had a very plain BBQ sauce, so I added some dark brown sugar to sweeten it a bit.  It was very good!

I was expecting to be WOWed here, but this was just okay.  I was not a fan of the mustard here.  I seasoned my chicken before browning (I think this may have been overlooked?) and used Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce.  All in all, the taste didn't make up for the fat and calories in this dish...sorry!  I probably won't make again.  Thanks!

I found this dish cooked as specified to dry the chicken out and the cheese came out crunchy.  Maybe only cooking it in the oven would make it more moist.  Also seasoning the meat with different spices would improve the flavor.

very tasty- my husband calls it heart attack chicken- but nonetheless eats every bite of it and goes back for seconds!  I followed the notes and adjusted the bbq sauce it 1/4 cup and did not add the cheese or bacon until the last ten minutes.  I did cook the chicken on the stove first like the directions stated.  will make again and might try other sauces like A-1??

WOW!  This seems so simple - but the flavor was so good.  We had baked potatoes with it and I really felt like it was the best meal I have had for a long time.  The flavors were so great together.  I didn't make any changes.  Please try.

This chicken was great! I also put the cheese on the last 10 min. I put salt and pepper on the chicken when I was cooking it. Yum!

This was delicious! Everytime I try to make something new I end up throwing it away and getting a pizza. Not with this one!!! It was amazing! My seven year old even liked it and asked for more! It is hard to get him to eat anything!! My two year old ate it too!

This was very good.  By the ingredients I'm sure you can tell it's a pretty heavy meal.  However, it tasted great, can't quibble about calories!

This recipe was great!  The Chicken was very tender.  The bacon and Cheese went great with it.  I will definately use this recipe again.

This was very easy to make.  My family liked it for the most part.  My husband said the only thing was the sauce was a little much.  I will try again with some modifications next time.
