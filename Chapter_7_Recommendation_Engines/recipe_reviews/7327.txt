I bake cakes weekly for our companies employees
 birthdays. This cake was a HUGE success! The men
 in the plant were particularly fond of it. The
 creamy filling that falls to the middle as it 
 bakes is a wonderful surprise. But do take note!!
 Baking time IS longer than indicated.

I made this for my father-in-law's b-day and it was a hit.  It was then requested for my husband's grandmother's birthday the following week.  I did bake it a little longer than stated, just until the toothpick came out clean-- an extra 10-15 mins.  Also this cake is somehow even more delicious the next day.  Y*U*M*M*Y!!!

This cake is sooo good, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had some problem taking the cut pieces out of pan because of the bottom layer, so next time, and there will be a next time, I am going to make sure that I really oil the pan better or but some type of paper on the bottom of the pan for easier serving....the taste and conbination of ingredients made this cake really special!!

This is wonderful!! Everyone asks for it over again. It is also not difficult to make. I have made it several times, and will do so again, in fact, I am making it this weekend to take to a pitch in. I first tried it at a local restaurant, and decided to see if it was on All Recipes!  Of course it was! YUM

MMMM... chocolate-y and fairly easy too!  With ingredients like choc cake, cream cheese, walnuts, coconut, chocolate/cola glaze... c'mon... what it NOT to like?  Not the prettiest thing in the pan, but interesting looking... and the bake time was correct for me, FYI.  Everyone that tried this cake liked it too!  I am sure I will make it again!

As written, I give this recipe four stars.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe almost exactly - I used German Chocolate cake mix and followed other reviews, adding 3 cups of powdered sugar, pecans instead of walnuts, and baking for an hour.  I thought it was just ok - I found it a bit dry.  My husband loved it though, so 
I decided to try again.  

The second time it came out phenomenal!  This time, I used Betty Crocker triple chocolate fudge cake mix and instead of 3 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting, I further reduced the quantity to 2 cups.  I also skipped the coconut. I used walnuts as written.  I made the cake in a bunt pan and was careful to spread the frosting on the top of the batter, but without letting the frosting to get too close to the edge.  The second time around, I softened the cream cheese too.  The cream cheese melted into the cake, leaving a delicious ribbon of cream cheese goodness at the bottom.  It did not come out all bubbly like some of the pictures.  It actually looked very nice.  I definitely recommend using a bundt pan instead of a 13 x 9 pan.

My coworkers always ask me to bring this cake on food days.  I like this earthquake cake recipe best because it also has a chocolate frosting on it.

Yummy, tasty cake very moist, liked the icing too.  The only change I made was to add one egg to the cream cheese mixture because I was worried the cake would be to mushy without it.  Glad I did cake held up well and was able to cut it into small squares.  Really good.

We absolutely loved this cake.  Did take longer to bake for me.  That's where that toothpick comes in handy.  Also had trouble keeping the family away from it while it cooled.  It smells wonderful.

This is the best German Chocolate Cake I've ever tasted.  My family absolutely loved it.  I buttered the baking dish well and had absolutely no trouble dishing up the cake.  The recommended time also was perfect.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

We made this cake for a family dinner party and it turned out very, very good.  It's great for chocolate lovers.  The homemade icing was rich and chocolaty.  I also added extra confectioner's sugar (about 1 cup) to make the icing thicker.  It's a very easy cake to make, too.  It went well with vanilla ice cream!

Help!! I tried this recipe and it turned out a mess.  It tasted great but looked awful.  I thought I had followed the recipe carefully but when I reread the recipe I had accidently used a German Choc w/pudding.  Would this be why it looked so awful?

I baked this for a friend's birthday, and even the girls sworn to their diets had to try a piece after everyone else said it was delicious!  I used about 2 1/2 cups of the sugar for the icing to make it a little thicker.
