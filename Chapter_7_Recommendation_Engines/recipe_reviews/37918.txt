Very good flavor! I used pollock filets, which were fairly thin. But so many reviewers recommended a longer cooking time, that I cooked them for 30 minutes just to be sure. I served this with a flavored rice mix and french-cut green beans. It's easy enough for a weeknight dinner, but looks special. Thank you, Matthew!

A word to the wise: Because of the lemon juice, DO NOT use a Teflon-coated (i.e. non-stick) baking sheet or it will absorb the fish smell and flavor. Use glass if you can.

Prior to cooking, I read the reviews and followed some of the suggestions.  I also "tasted" the sauce as I went.  I used less salt and pepper (1/4 the amount listed).  I also added 1/4 tsp dill weed and a heaping tbsp of Mayo (to help it "stick".  The results were fantastic.  Since we also had shrimp skewers, I wanted something similar but different (so the flavors would compliment each other), so I cut back on the lemon juice by 1/2, omitted the dill this time, and added a scant 1/4 cup grated parmesan.  The shrimp were heavenly.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, as my husband has recently developed a love of fish.  Next time I'm trying it with a butter substitute, as my hubby has digestive problems with that much butter.  But recipe definitely earns 5 stars!
Update: I tried another variation using the mayo, parmesan, dill, and chives added to the basic recipe (like I've done in the past), and baked it over tilapia fillets.  MMMMMMMMM! It was wonderful.  My son, who doesn't really like fish, really enjoyed this!  This is now my standard recipe for fish!  If I could rate it 10 stars, I would!  Next time, I'm going to try it with a splash of wine...  Ohhhh, I can hardly wait!

I also think that adding lemon pepper seasoning to the lemon butter cod will have a overpowering taste. Instead, I grated the lemon zest and mixed it with 1/2 cup of plain bread crumbs. I also layered fresh baby spinach underneath the fish, covered it with lemon butter and bread crumb mixture, and finished it with some grated parmesan cheese on top. I baked it at 375F for 15 minutes, and removed the foil to bake for another 15 minutes. Absolutely love that creamy lemon taste!

This is very similar to the way I normally cook fish, halibut, in general.  I used halibut with this recipe and it turned out awesome.  I also added some heavy cream to the sauce at the end to make a cream sauce and it was superb.

I thought I would write the kind of review that so many people write: So I didnt have fish so I used Hamburger instead and I didnt want to use lemon pepper so I used barbeque sauce instead and then I chose grill it instead of bake it and to top it off I threw some chesse and mayo on it had a side of baked beans an holy  was it ever good. I would highly recommend this recipe for all that want something other that Lemon Pepper fish!

This is 5 star only after a few changes based on other people's suggestions.  Left out the lemon pepper entirely, sprinkled a little dill over, used fresh lemon juice, and placed a slice of lemon on top of each fillet.  As a personal preference, I used orange roughy instead of cod because I can't stand cod.  Great after these changes!

I wrapped salmon, topped with this sauce, in foil packets and baked them. I omitted the lemon pepper and placed lemon slices on top of the fish instead. It was delicious! My husband is picky about fish and he really enjoyed this recipe.

I'm rating this four stars rather than five as the amount of lemon pepper and lemon called for seems overbearing. I toned them both down considerably, and used fresh parsley rather than dried. I also was not fond of the cooking method, covering the fish with foil. I prefer my fish a nice, golden brown, so I baked it in a 400 degree oven, uncovered, till flaky (time depends on thickness of filets, and mine were done in 15 minutes), then broiled them just long enough to brown the top. Hubs and I really enjoyed this, but again, my recommendation would be to use only enough lemon pepper and lemon juice to suit you.

LOVED this recipe. Didn't have lemon-pepper on hand so I omittted it and am glad I did as I think it would have "ruined" the fresh taste it had. This is quick, easy and really favorful. For the reviews calling it "bland" or just "so-so" I would venture to guess they didn't use fresh lemon, fresh garlic, etc.

This is a tasty, easy recipe.  I made it easier by using 3 tbs. bottled lemon juice instead of squeezing the lemon, using a garlic press instead of mincing the garlic, and using a covered casserole dish instead of foil covered pan.  I did add some cayenne pepper to the sauce, and sprinkled a little dill and seasoning salt on the fish.  I also cut back on the lemon pepper, as suggested.  I baked it 25 minutes instead of 15-20. My husband especially enjoyed this dish.

The lemon butter sauce is so good!  I added a bit of garlic powder to it, and also a couple tablespoons of sour cream to make it creamier.  It turned out great.  This would be good on ANY fish!  We have had it on salmon and halibut both.

This is quite delicious as long as the amounts of salt and pepper are reduced, but I think most of us are automatically inclined to always check for seasonings. I added a spoonful of mayonnaise and a bit of dill, as several others did, and found it delicious; a good way to cook fish or large sea scallops.  I'm sorry for the lady whose husband threw it in the garbage can.

Fantastic! I was hoping to find an easy recipe to fix Cod since I'm tired of our regular way. I had everything on hand and whipped this up tonight and it was delicious! I love the lemon butter mixture! I did adjust the recipe though to recommendations on here. I cut the salt/pepper amount in half. (Would have been too salty otherwise). Added 1/2 tsp dill to the butter sauce and skipped the lemon pepper completely. I also added a dollop of mayonnaise to the second half of the butter mixture for drizzling over the fish. A keeper for sure. I think I actually over ate on this tonight. I think I may eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow instead of sending them with DH to work. MMMMM!

Very tasty!  I just pan sauteed instead of baked.  Omitted lemon pepper seasoning; added some dill and chardonnay.  Wonderful!  Served with a simple herb salad and crusty bread.

This is perfect!  I actually just add all ingredients and bake...I don't make a sauce, because the flavor bakes in.  I also add a dash of white wine and layer tomato slices over the fish when baking.  Thank you!  Easy peasy!  :)

This was excellent.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and added some dill, about the same amount as the parsley.  I also omitted the lemon pepper seasoning.  I just grated some of the zest from the squeezed lemon and sprinkled that and pepper over the top of the tilapia.

The flavor in this recipe was outstanding! I started out with about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and found it to be plenty salty with the salted butter. Boiling butter for 10 minutes though wasn't a good idea, and it really doesn't thicken up a whole lot. So the next time I made it I let it boil just until the spices were lightly "toasted". I then baked the fillets in a glass baking dish covered with foil and they were really good!

This was good but I felt it was a little too much butter. I went easy on the lemon pepper also. Next time I will cook uncovered though.

I'm only a teenager and i made this all by myself! :P It was awsome especially if you make home-made hash browns to go with it. I reccomend for 4 pieces of fish to use a 6-7 servings amount.

This was AMAZING!!! So good! Even my 16 month old loved it. I kept back some of the butter sauce and added some sour cream to pour over the fish after... mmmm! I didn't put the lemon pepper on the fish, but instead put it directly into the butter so it wasn't as strong a flavour. Served it over jasmine rice and spinach with the sauce over top.

Great sauce. I didn't use the lemon pepper but I had a large lemon and fresh cracked pepper so it was perfectly lemony and peppery. I would use this sauce on more then just cod or fish in general. It was a big hit.

Nice and easy.  The butter/lemon sauce cooked down enough that we used all during the baking step.  Didn't measure the lemon pepper, just sprinkled on what looked right prior to baking.

Lovely Light Taste.  Made several alterations as suggested by others and a tweek or so of my own...

- Leave out the lemon pepper entirely
- Omit Parsley 
- Add 2 tsp finely minced dill to the sauce
- Place a slice of lemon on top of each fillet 
- Baked about 25 minutes (or until flakey)

I followed the recipe exactly. Very salty, and the sauce even smelled bad. Don't understand why this is 4+ stars.

Perfect and perfectly easy. I added more garlic because we love it and put it all on a bed of spinach before pouring the marinade over all of it. Will be making again for a quick fish dinner. My 2 year old ate it up, and my hubby who tends to be picky with fish dishes said "5 stars"
we used Tilapia and it was perfect.

I made some simple tweaks to this recipe and it was delicious. For one,in place of the lemon pepper I used the zest from the lemon and topped with herbs de province. This small twist added a new level to the meal. I feel this recipe is excelent.

Excellent. I used a 2 1/2 pound cod fillet. I put 1/2 of the butter sauce over the cod and topped it with fresh dill and lemon slices. I baked as stated. I took the remaining lemon sauce and added a couple tbsp of heavy cream and whisked it together. Not calorie friendly but what a treat and presentation. I served it with sweet potatoes and it really made a nice dinner. Will make again for a treat.

Made exactly as written and my husband said it was the best fish I had ever made.  I did follow one suggestion and broiled for about 4 min at end to lightly brown.

I thought these had too much lemon. If you're looking to mask the taste of what you're eating and love lemon, this is great, but I prefer milder flavors with fish.

This dish would have been better if it had more butter and WAY less pepper. I was sprinkling the lemon pepper on the fish and thought, "That looks like a lot..." I think I only added half of the lemon pepper, but still, when my mom and I were eating it it just felt like we were eating forkfuls of pepper and our mouths were on fire. Blegh. It definitely was not fantastic.

Excellent addition to fish to really make it pop!  I used cod fillets and it turned out great.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut down on the amount of butter used - it almost seemed a little too thick and stole away from the lemon peppery flavor.

I cut the recipe in half since there are two of us.    Both my husband and I found the recipe to be way too salty for our tastes.  If I were to prepare this again, I would leave out the 1 tsp (I used only 1/2 since I cut recipe in half) of salt called for in the sauce and also cut down on the Lemon Pepper.  I found that trying to cook the lemon butter mixture until it thickened actually burned the minced garlic and dried parsley. (And I had it on medium heat.)  I doubt that I would use this recipe again.  My expectations for what sounded like a wonderful fish recipe did not turn out that way.

Very flavorful, as others I did not use the lemon pepper , but did salt and pepper the fish before cooking and I did run it under the broiler for a little color, this will be in the rotation, thanks for sharing

Thanks. As other reviewers suggested I used 1/2-1/4 of the salt, 1/3 of the lemon pepper and 1/3 of the butter recommended.  To cut the calories I used a butter spray and a little bit more fresh lemon. I also sprinkled some bread crumbs (made from a mix of standard 1/3 white bread crumbs and 2/3 fiber one cereal I made in advance for recipes that call for breading) and a little parmesan cheese.  The bread crumbs and cheese were sprinkled on the fish not completely covered.  Based on other suggestions I also cooked the fish an extra 5 minutes and uncovered for the last 10 minutes.  It turned out very tender and moist.

This was really good. My husband was impressed. Despite my husbands dislike for halibut, he loved this. Although I did use less butter just to cut back on fat, it still tasted great!

I reduced  the salt as well as the lemon juice and lemon pepper, and added cayenne pepper and dill.  Not a bad recipe—good for a weeknight meal.

AMAZING.....was wonderful on cod tenderloins, but one of my daughters doesn't eat fish of any kind so I put a boneless, skinless chicken breast on a pie plate with the lemon, garlic and butter sauce and cooked without covering in the oven while the fish cooked... OMG! It is great on fish but even more amazing on chicken! Tomorrow I will do the sauce on chicken for the whole family. This one's a keeper! Thanks!

The fish was moist but did NOT taste very good. My husband is not a picky eater but he threw this out! In our 12 years of being together I can count on one hand how many times he has done this. Sorry, I will not make this again. Thanks anyway :-)

Very good and tasty recipe!!  I made these small changes: 1 tsp. chicken bouillon instead of 1 tsp. salt.  I added a small amount of thinly sliced and chopped onion to the sauce when I added the garlic.  And, I baked for 30 minutes covered with foil as I used frozen cod fillets.  I served the fish with rice and a green salad.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.  My husband also loved it!!

May have been better without the lemon pepper.  It calls for quite a lot of lemon pepper and it overpowers any other flavor.  Family didn't approve.

Thanks Matthew, this is a very tasty fish recipe.  I used country crock margerine with the yogurt in it and it still turned out great!  I actually made this in my toaster oven , because I scaled the recipe for 2, and baked it in a foil packet.  After baking, I used the "sauce" that was in the foil over some brown rice and it was great.  My lemon pepper (caputo's) was a bit peppery so that added a great kick.  Thanks I will make this tasty dish again.

This was very quick and tasty. I kind of combined this and the Cod with Italian Crumb Topping recipes, and used this recipe for the sauce, but sprinkled my fish (cod) with some breadcrumbs seasoned with garlic powder and parmesan cheese. My husband (who's still sometimes hesitant about fish dishes) couldn't believe how good it was- he said it was better than at a restaurant.

I made this recipe exactly like it is written and it was awesome!  My husband and I both gave it 5 stars. I will admit that I "eyeball" measurements instead of using measuring spoons but I cook enough that I should be extremely close.  I didn't think the lemon/pepper was too much as other people have mentioned in their reviews.  It was perfect.  If you don't like the amounts given, then you probably just don't favor lemon/pepper taste. Some people who submitted reviews changed this recipe so much that it didn't even resemble the same recipe. I wouldn't write a review good or bad unless you actually followed the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe. I've added it to my recipe book as a permanent addition!!

I've been forced (by long term bad eating habits) to eat more fish (that isn't a fish stick). This was really, really, really good & I don't like lemony flavor. It just worked. Now I understand why fish & lemon go together, but that's another symptom of overuse of frozen food ;) I think I might use a little less butter next time--or find some way to cut down on fat, but as the recipe reads now its 6 WWPP so its pretty healthy overall. & most importantly: edible for non-foodies who gravitate towards battered fish

This was ok and easy, but I really think cod needs to be breaded since it doesn't have much flavor.

OMG! ZESTY! I followed the recipe with a few changes. I used garlic paste since I didn't have fresh garlic on hand. I also omitted the Lemon Pepper, as I did not have that on hand either. I did add sour cream and added a little bit of corn starch to the other half of the sauce to add some body to it. I used the thicker sauce to top the cooked fish and on the rice. AMAZING!

Used Tilapia and put it on the grill in tinfoil. Pretty good. A little bland though.

Delicious and easy.  I think it was a bit too much lemon juice.  My fillet tasted great but when my 2 year old took a bite it fell right out of her mouth with the typical lemon pucker.  Maybe I poured the sauce on wrong.  I will definitely make it again but with a bit less lemon next time.  Thanks!

I thought the sauce was delicious, basically a great scampi sauce base, but I doubled the amount of lemon juice and once I poured half onto the fish to back, I added some wine white wine and house seasoning to round out the flavor a little bit for the finishing sauce.  I would use this sauce mostly when grilling fish or shrimp... it was very delicate and lovely.  However, I used it with some baked arctic char, and it's entirely possible that I just chose the wrong filet to use with this recipe, but the fish came out a little slimy and the texture was just all wrong.  Loved the sauce, hated the fish.

I didn't have any lemon pepper, so I let it out.  Husband and kids loved it!  I will try subbing part of the butter for olive oil next time for the sake of dh's cholesterol.

Not sure why so many are adding mayo to a dish that has a 1/2 cup of butter in it. Seems like it would be way too much fat and grease. Cut down on salt, as others have suggested, otherwise quite delicious. Because of an allergy to garlic I use a shallots. Shallots make a good substitute for garlic. I also use a homemade lemon pepper because all the lemon peppers that I have found in the stores contain garlic.

I really like this recipe. A bit to salty with the given recipe amount so I cut it in half maybe even less than half. The garlic and butter give enough salt taste alone. Excellent Recipe!

We liked this a lot. I sprinkled the fish with fresh lemon zest and dill weed instead of the lemon pepper. It cooked to perfection in 25 minutes and was very easy.

Very easy and quick to prepare. The sauce was really delicious too.  I would suggest seasoning the fillet with salt when you sprinkle the lemon-pepper, this way it is salted "to taste", and there is less risk of over-seasoning. otherwise, if you enjoy lemon, and food that is well-seasoned, you'll like this dish. If you prefer a more subtle hint of lemon with your fish, go easy on the lemon pepper, or perhaps reduce the amount of lemon to 1/2 of the required amount. I followed the recipe as it was written, and loved the results. I could see how using the incorrect amount of fish in this recipe would yield poor results, so weigh your fish!  I used Ling Cod. It was fabulous. A definite must try. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was delicious!  I made just 2 fillets, but made the full sauce recipe, and am glad I did because I don't think it would have turned out well with smaller amounts.  I just used 2 garlic cloves so as not to overpower the other flavors, and I did not use lemon pepper at all because it looked like there were enough seasonings.  The smell while cooking the sauce was heavenly, and the result was fantastic.  We ate the fillets with rice, which I also recommend.

Great recipe. I did what you guys said and I added only 1 tablespoon of lemon pepper but it was still a bit too much lemon for me. The taste is really great but just way too much lemon.
 I Threw away the remaining butter mix and I took the fish out of the butter I baked it in.I added water with flour to make a sauce...and a couple table spoons of sour cream...this toned down the lemon taste a bit and I still managed the safe the lemon taste in the fish.

It was great with the sauce.

My husband loved it.

Thanks Matthew.

WOW!!!  This was great!  We've never cooked cod before (not readily available at stores here), but with this recipe, we discovered that we LOVE this fish.  This was so simple and classic, I can't wait to try it on other types of fish as well. Highly recommended for lemon, garlic & butter-lovers!

We had this with some cod and it was wonderful!  I'm not usually a huge fish eater, but I just loved the mix of flavors, really nice, and it was easy too!  I'm going to give it a go with some scallops and perhaps shrimp in the very near future.  Thanks Matthew, for a great fish recipe to add to my very small list of ones I use!

Simple and tasty. I made a few modifications. I left out h the lemon pepper, reduced the amount of butter, added dill, mayo, and capers. It turned out amazing, my husband loved it and said it was like something you would get at a nice restaurant. I would definitely make this again.

I used this recipe last night on fresh, wild caught cod fillets for my wife and myself.  Followed the recipe to a tee and it was wonderful.  I intend on trying this on skinless chicken breasts next.  Makes a nice sauce, just the right consistency and flavor.

This recipe was delicious. Before putting it into the oven, I added extra (raw) garlic and parsley on top of the fillet before I sealed the foil around it. I only made one fillet so I just wrapped the foil around the Cod loosely so that it would steam a bit inside. I served this with "Shrimp Lemon Pepper Linguini" by Skini on AllRecipes, which complimented the Cod so well!!!! Definitely making this again!

Thanks to this recipe, I made the best fish I've ever made in my life!  The sauce was so rich and creamy with amazing flavors.  I did pull back on the lemon pepper and added lots of dill (our favorite) and some mayo to thicken it.  Used 3 Tbsp lemon juice, as I didn't have any fresh lemons.    

My 9 year old son -literally- licked his plate.  I was both embarrassed and delighted.  We will absolutely be making this again!

Great stuff! As common as lemon butter on fish is, I'd never made it myself. I wound up using a little less fish than called for (due to a store mixup). I had only 5 cod filets at about 4 ounces each. Cod was a great choice for the fish here. This recipe might have made a little too much, in my opinion, but that's why I served the fish on a bed of cooked brown rice. Definitely worth making again.

This was delicious!  However, the way it is written makes the fish far to salty, hence the 4 star instead of 5.  We actually crave this fish, it's so good.  I do add a dollop of homemade mayonnaise to it as well for sticking power and more flavor depth.  My boyfriend loves this so much he says it's better than anything we could get in a restaurant (keeping in mind he's a boring eater)

Wish I had read the reviews first and adjusted accordingly… I included all the ingredients, measuring out most, eyeing the parsley and pepper. What I'd do differently? I would completely OMIT the lemon pepper seasoning and I think I'd also put in less lemon juice… and try it again. Otherwise BAM you get citrus face followed by a not so pleasant taste. That said, if the fish is very LIGHTLY coated prior to cooking, and if you don't add extra sauce at the end, then maaaybe this recipe as is would be decent. Potential is there, but this recipe as is is a no go. Definitely needs alterations. I'll try it one more time, but differently.

I have tried this and it is pretty good.

First I sprayed the baking dish with (Food Lion) pan spray. I changed a few of the ingredients, instead of lemon-pepper I used lemon-pepper herb. I did not use Parsley and instead of sprinkling the lemon-pepper herb on the Cod I put it right away into the butter mixture. Also the 1-lemon juice I used lemon concentrate.

All in all it did turn out really good, I served it to two of my very good  friends and they too enjoyed the taste. Next time I will use the complete recipe and see if there is much of a difference. Hopefully I can remember to.

Until next time.......

Instead of butter I used olive oil, and I mixed it with the lemon, salt and pepper.  I added the garlic at the end so it wouldn't make the sauce too strong. Instead of fish I used a 10oz. beef tenderloin steak.  I broiled the steak for 3 minutes per side and it was yummy!

Made this with Alaskan pollock. Omitted the dry parsley as I don't think it would have added anything to the recipe. Used the juice of 1 lime as I didn't have a lemon on hand. I sprinkled lemon pepper on until it looked right. The fish cooked quickly (15 min) and I put it under the broiler for about 5 min to brown it a little as recommended by some reviewers. A great hit! I think the lemon pepper and the garlic made the dish. Served with Thai rice and green beans.

I love this! Definitely keep stirring the sauce as you are making it, though, it has a tendency to burn (usually because of the garlic) and then it gets little black bits in it.

All 3 of my boys and my hubby loved it.  The sauce is supurb, but a little goes a long way.  Use fresh lemon juice and fresh garlic.  Don't use too much salt.  I didn't use seperate lemon pepper and it wasn't missed.  S&P was added to sauce.  I used flounder and it was done in about 12 minutes - uncovered.

I gave this 3 stars because it was easy but I feel it could use more flavor.  I hate lemon pepper so I omitted that part.  Maybe that was the missing flavor?  Next time I will add some seasoned salt or something, but it was OK for a quick lunch.

I love lemon flavor on fish, but hate mayo with fish (makes me gag).  This was awesome!!  I did place lemon slices on the fish and used the whole sauce when putting it in the oven.  This had a strong lemon flavor but was very nice.  Better than the mayo/butter/parmesan recipe on here.

Very, very good recipe. It was tasty, quick and simple. Will have to put this in rotation. Like others have stated, I left out the lemon pepper seasoning because the lemon I added was enough.   Didn't have fresh lemon so I used some out of the bottle. I also ended up cooking the fish for about 30 minutes.

So good. The sauce is out of this world, so much better than just baking the fish in tin foil with lemon and butter. I didn't think pre-boiling the sauce would make such a difference, but it did.

Delicious!!!!  Cut sauce in half for 1 pound of fish.  Fantastic!  My husband described it as fish scampi--which is basically is.  Yum

Delicious taste but I baked it a bit longer in an effort to "crisp it up". Will make again.

This was delicious.  I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer, though.  It had just the right mount of lemon, a nice light recipe.

a whole stick of butter would have been way too much, i only used 3tbsp on my 1.5lbs of fish, and that was plenty, a little goes a long way... otherwise, very tasty!

I thought this was a good recipe, but I might not call it "fantastic".  I didn't use the lemon pepper seasoning (lemon pepper is too overpowering for my taste). Instead, as suggested by another reviewer, I grated the lemon zest and mixed it with a 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs (I was making 4 servings).  I covered the fish with the lemon butter + bread crumb mix, and sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese on top.  It came out nice and the flavors were good but not too overpowering.  Next time though I think I will double the sauce (since I added the breadcrumbs the dish came out a little dry).

I fixed this just as the recipe indicated - used hammour (a fish similar to cod that is popular in Qatar (small middle east country).  It cooked up nicely but was very bland.  I may try adding a significant amount of spices and herbs to this dish but will not make according to the recipe again.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  Easily adjustable, and the seasonings were perfect.  I sprinkled a little bit of cajun seasoning on top along with the lemon pepper and it hit the spot.  Our guests really liked this.  Will definately make again!

Excdellent recipe.  I used talapia fillets and followed the recipe to a "T".  It was a "supreme" hit with my family (as the younger generation exclaimed)!  Thanks so very much for a fantastic recipe.  I love Allrecipes!

Very tasty however I would cut back on the butter next time also used others suggestions by using dill, chives, mayo and parm cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantabulous! I made my dish using Orange Roughy and served it on a bed of fresh spinach I had steamed then poured some of the reserved sauce on. Had a side of couscous and the family gobbled up every morsel in sight - even my 2-year old I-hate-vegetables baby! I too omitted the lemon pepper but other than that, stuck to the recipe. Something in the reviews that attracted me to this recipe is that it is a super fish recipe - doesn't really matter what fish you use be it cod, orange roughy, catfish, tilapia, etc. I will be making this quite often - it truly tastes like something you would be served in a restaurant. Can''t wait to make it for my parents some night!

This is great.  The seasoning was flavorful and went very nicely with the fish.  I used tilapia instead of cod, and extra virgin olive oil instead of butter.  Wonderful!

I thought this was delicous.Quite a strong lemon taste, but a real great way to give mild white fish some flavour.This recipe will become one of my standards when I am preparing fish.

This was a decent recipe, but not fantastic as stated.  I did use the lemon pepper seasoning, but not the full amout.  Followed the recipe exacty otherwise.  I probably would make it again, but make some more adjustments.

My husband & I eat a LOT of fish so when I saw all the great reviews on this cod dish, I thought it would fit the bill.  I made it as it is written & we both thought that the lemon pepper totally overpowered the fish.  We threw the rest out.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe.  I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand, but it still came out great.  I also baked it uncovered for 15 minutes and broiled it for 15 minutes slightly browning the top.  Thanks!

This recipe is so easy to prepare, and my children loved it!  I drizzled the extra sauce from the pan over rice.  
There was not a bit left over!  Now that is a good recipe for a busy mom!

i would rate this a high 3 or low 4. too salty for my taste. and i like salt. i didnt use lemon pepper as others have said. i did sprinkle a little garlic pepper over the top of fish. i would try again. next time adding garlic at the end of cooking butter, or barely simmer the butter with it in. it burned the garlic, which maybe led to the salty taste, not too sure.

Little too lemony for me, and I didn't even sprinkle with the lemon pepper.  I used an herb seasoning instead.  Over all, it was pretty good, but will cut back on the lemon next time.

This was good. Needed a quick fix for dinner tonight. As per other reviewers, I cut back on the lemon pepper. It was easy, fast, had a nice flavor and that's basically all I cared about tonight. Thanks Matthew!

It smelt great though, but didnt't work for cod. I would think tiger prawns would work better with the addition of cheese.

My 13 year old sister and I made this dish and it was fantastic. But I dont think I put enough seasoning. I also didnt put parsley. Other then that it really was great. My older brothers and mom really loved it!

Very easy to make and tastes great.  I did omit the lemon pepper and topped with lemon slices.  Then I cooked the fish 20 minutes covered and being as the fish was not done I removed the foil and ended up cooking another 15 minutes…it came out perfect.

Very easy to make. I used less lemon (about 1/2 tsp lemon juice) and used less butter (about 4 tbs) and it made just enough sauce. I might recommend no-salt butter because the sauce was on the salty side, but overall it was very good. The tsp lemon juice added just enough tang to not make it overwhelming. Thanks for a great one!

This was good, but not the "best fish ever". Butter taste was great and I used fresh parsley, too bad the fat content was abismal.

I really liked this recipe.  It was an impromptu decision for dinner tonight, and I had everything the recipe called for, except for the lemon, so I used bottled lemon juice.  Also, I only had 4 cod filets, although I used all the stated measurments.  I really enjoyed the dish, was a little overwhelmed by the Lemon Pepper seasoning, but I didn't use the correct amount of filets, either.  My husband didn't like it, said it tasted too fishy (HELLO -- it is FISH)!  It is a good recipe, but I probably won't make it again, because my husband won't eat it.  I served it with brown rice and baby carrots.  Thanks Matthew!

My family enjoyed this recipe, although the lemony flavor was a little strong for us.  We'll cut down on the lemon next time - and there WILL be a next time!  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  Went a little crazy with the lemon juice and had to throw out first try at sauce.  Second try was perfect.  I cooked the cod for 35 minutes as suggested by a few others, and mine turned out a little overcooked.  Next time will cook between 25 and 30 minutes.  The extra sauce was also delcious drizzled over broccoli and cauliflower!

We loved it!  I left off the lemon pepper seasoning and spooned all the sauce over the fillets.  They were wonderful!  My hubby--who doesn't like me cooking fish at home--thought it was very tasty!  Thank you!!!!

great way to prepare fish on a busy night.  I skipped adding the extra buttery topping after cooking.  I also cooked it for about 5 minutes with the foil off.  I will absolutely use this often.

This dish is becoming a family favourite! The only thing I changed was the cooking time. I baked for 40 minutes instead of 20 for more tender, flakier fish.

The kids both ate it without complaining but I thought it was too lemony.  I did not add the lemon pepper seasoning at the end.  I would uncover it next time b/c it was too watery and didn't have any of that nice browning on the fish.

This went together easily with salted pollock that had soaked for 8 hours, unsalted butter, lemon juice of a lemon and with the addition of capers. I didn’t have lemon pepper and didn’t bother with the zest. It cooked in the oven for 20 minutes, fish was flaky and hubby enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

Thought I'd love it. Not at all!  The seasoned butter never thickened.  It was also way too salty.  I did not use 2 Tbps of lemon pepper, as well. When I measured it out, that was entirely too much.  Just sprinkled it on top at the end. The butter sauce with a whole lemon was already  too lemony.  Won't make again.

This was a big hit with everyone.  Rather than pour the second half of the sauce over the fish, we placed it on the table so diners could add more of less to suit.  We didn't have any lemon-pepper but with the fresh squeezed lemon, it was just right.

I made this, using the suggestion from others, to omit the lemon pepper. Plenty of flavor without it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, exactly. I used cod fillets from the freezer. Served with hush puppies and broccoli spears. My picky teenaged boys actually complimented dinner, tonight! That RARELY happens.

I made this with some small res snapper filets my brother caught  in Florida. Used fresh parsley, added a splash of white wine and 2 T of sour cream to sauce, topped it with sliced tomatoes sprinkled with panko, broiled till brown (about 3 minutes) after baking fish, for nice crunch...heavenly!

Ones that complain this is to salty should check nutrition first before wasting fish.  This goes for any recipe in fact.  Yes this is high in sodium for some people.

Cod was moist. Added powdered lemon  pepper to cod pieces before cooking for more lemon flavor.

This was a simple and really delicious way to enjoy a nice fillet of cod. I tweaked the amounts of lemon and capers for more flavor, but this was a great recipe on it's own.

No change to the recipe.  The butter and garlic mixture when baked in the oven produced a bitter garlic flavor to the fish.  Don't think garlic should bake like that.  Had to scrape off the mixture as the taste was too harsh.  If I use this recipe again I would strain the butter/garlic sauce before subjecting it to the oven temp for the prescribed baking time.

The fish turned out flakey and juicy!  So much flavor. It was a hit with my hubby. Thank you. I did cut down the pepper by one half and it was plenty.

I haven't tasted it yet, okay. But how is butter cooking longer with lemon suppose to thicken? Mine did not thicken. My garlic and parsley started too get brown and I stopped waiting for a thickening which I never saw. Hope its okay.

Probably not for everyone but here's my version. Perfect for one tilapia fillet. In cast-iron pan, 2 tbsp butter, 3/4 lemon juice, 1 garlic, blend on stovetop. Add tilapia fillet. Season with salt/pepper. Bake 350 for 10 min. Mix 2 - 4 tbsp mayo, panko crumbs, parmesan cheese, fresh parsley chopped. 
After 10min, place asparagus on bottom of pan, place finished rice beside, cover asparagus with turned fish fillets, a little more salt/pepper. Spread mayo mix on top. Bake 12 min.  Broil to brown. Serve. mmmm

I used 3 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice instead of fresh,

Also omitted both salt and pepper from sauce mixture since the lemom pepper i have has salt in it also.
The Sauce never did thicken and I don't feel it ever would since there is nothing in it that would thicken. I think this should just be sauted till all the flavors blend.

I did this with Pollack and it was done perfect after 20 minutes in a convection oven.

I added heavy cream to the remaining sauce mixture and heated till thickened with the help of a bit of corn starch and served over angle hair pasta with asparagus on the side.

Will make this again Very good Flavor

Very tender and delicious cod.  Lots of flavor, not over spiced with the flavor of the fish coming through.  Excellent meal.

I made this for dinner tonight with wild caught cod and it was AMAZING... with a couple modifications. I agree with many of the reviewers about the amount of salt used.  I cut that in 1/2, left out the lemon pepper as well, and pan cooked it on low with a lid.  I realized last minute we were out of foil.  But to my advantage it turned out beautifully!! The husband was thoroughly impressed! Thank you for this delightful recipe :)

Made some tiny changes.  I heated my oven to 400 (old and a bit leaky, heat-wise).

To the sauce I used fresh  dill instead of parsley and omitted the wine (as shockingly, I was out of wine!!).  I used two lemons instead of one for the squeezing.

I also added some chunked onion on top of the fish in  its foil wrap.   27 minutes baking  (a very thick fillet of cod) and it was just perfect.  flaky and super rich/lemony.  I'll make this again for sure.

I made few changes after reading other reviews, fresh parsley, fresh dill, the last half of the butter left added about table spoon mayo to pour over fish delicious. I also used glass dish with a lid instead of pan.

My family is not a fish eating family.  I bought some Cod from Costco, wanting to get them to try something new.  This recipe looked like it might work to sway their palette's so I could buy more fish in the future.

Read several of the reviews before preparing it and followed the suggestions of reducing the Salt & Pepper by half, omitting the Lemon Pepper and adding some Mayo and Dill Weed.  The sauce tasted wonderful, so I was anxious to taste the fish.

It smelled delicious coming out of the oven and my mouth was watering as I loaded the plates.  Everyone hesitantly tried it and thought it tasted really wonderful.  Sadly, it didn't help them overcome their disliking of fish, but everyone agreed that the sauce made the fish edible.

I would highly recommend this as this is the only thing I have tried that got a bunch of fish "haters" to actually eat and finish the piece of fish they were given.  As for me, I loved it and look forward to making it for myself the next time I have fish.

Loved the flavor, super easy to make! Literally ten minutes and it's in the oven. I used frozen cod fillets so it took over an hour to bake, but really pleased with the non fishy flavor. Makes a lot of sauce, would be good with potatoes and steamed veggies.

I followed the recipe, but substituted fresh cilantro for the dried parsley and used Bill Baron's Zesty Lemon seasoning for the lemon pepper.  It was absolutely delicious! My husband and I agreed that this was one of best tasting fish dishes I have made.

I used this recipe over grilled fish that needed something. It was salmon and cod I'd grilled day before with a marinade with orange juice, dill, dijon mustard, soy sauce,and lemon juice marinated overnight. that was tasteless. In turn I used this sauce as a saver of my fish. Worked well! I just added a little dill and no lemon pepper.

I'm not really a fish fan but this recipe was delicious and I plan on making it again soon! I used pollock fillets which do require a longer cooking time (30 minutes). I didn't have parsley so I substituted with dried basil leaves, worked well with me since I love using basil.

Used advice from another reviewer and topped it over a bunch of spinach in a glass 9x13. Also sprinkled a little bread crumbs over the fish.  Used 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper and omitted the lemon pepper. Used salted butter.  Cooked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees (convection) and uncovered for another 15 minutes. Once cooked I actually plated the fish and cooked spinach over a bed of raw spinach while my family had it over rice.  YummmY!  My husband said the he could eat this everyday!

I really liked this, but since my kids did not, I will not be making it again.  I think they do not like garlic taste unless it is fried golden.  Maybe I could fry the garlic in a bit of butter first, then add the rest of the ingredients.  But I do not think I will be making it again.

We used this recipe and listened to some of the constructive suggestions as well.  The flavor of the sauce/seasonings works absolutely GREAT on a good fillet.  I'd recommend using a relatively thin cut, and be sure to spoon some of the pan drippings over the fish when you serve it.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent recipe!  Definitely use fresh lemon juice and using some of the zest makes a huge difference.  There's really no reason to cover the fish while baking and sprinkling with bread crumbs gives you a nice crispy crust!

Wonderful recipe. Very light with an excellent flavor. I did choose to leave off the lemon pepper all together after reading some of the other reviews. I also used orange roughy instead of cod. Definitely a keeper.

I, too, used a bed of spinach but the second 15 minutes was too much for it (burned on edges.  Next time I'll separate the fish and the spinach, double the sauce, bake the fish, saute the spinach and add sauce to the spinach as it wilts.  Then presentation would be fish on spinach - pretty and delicious!

I'm not sure if it was a scaling down problem or that my haddock fillets were a lot smaller than usual but this was too strong in the lemon taste, I also had to leave out the pepper as the wife will not eat anything with pepper on it..  I'll try this again though it's quick and easy and should make a better meal than it did

Awesome!  The butter sauce is very good with a neutral flavor fish fillet such as freshwater catfish.    My wife but some of the butter sauce on her rice and that turned out to be a good combination as well.

Such a simple recipe but really makes delicious fish. The lemon/butter/garlic flavor was so good. I skipped the lemon pepper and did not miss it. You could certainly change up this recipe in little ways for different fish or shrimp.

This is very similar to how I would usually cook cod.  The only thing I found was that when the fish was done, there was quite a bit more liquid than I would have liked.

I thought this was pretty good. I think the pepper was a little overpowering, but I am not a very big pepper person & don't use it in much. I do think it had just the right amount of lemon & salt flavor though & will be sure to try real lemon next time.

We tried the recipe as is and it is really good, except we did not like all the lemon pepper.  We will use this recipe again, but do as others and replace the lemon pepper.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

Very nice.  used on a big piece of Halibut and it was very flavorful.  I like the fact that it is light and not overpowering for the fish.  I did add more garlic than called for and a bit more parsley too.

I made this last night and it was very easy and tasty!  I did not have the lemon pepper on hand, but prepared it exactly as mentioned.  It turned out great and is a great alternative to frying. Thanks for a great recipe, I will definitely make this again!

i was a bit weary about this recipe because of the mixed reviews it received but it was delicious!  we used fresh lemon but we skipped the lemon pepper(didn't have any) and the garlic (just plain forgot) and replaced the oregano with some sage.  it had to cook a little longer than expected but we did have some larger fillets.  we served it with green beans and baked potatoes with the left over butter drizzled on top and it was soooooooo yummy!  we'll make this again for sure!

Just like many other, I found this recipe quite bland even though I add more spices than suggested in the recipe.

I thought it was okay. The rest of my family did not like.It did not add much flavor to the fish. I don't think I will make again.

Good. Instead of 1/2 stick of butter I dotted the fish with butter and sprinkled the rest of the ingredients on top. DH liked it.

This is a good baked fish recipe.  Based on other reviewers comments about the lemon pepper, I left it out all together as I don't like the flavor of it anyway.  I cut all the quantities of ingredients that make up the butter sauce in 1/2, on the lemon I used about 2 tablespoons of bottled juice, and poured all of it on top of the fish.  Then I sprinkled quite a bit of paprika (maybe about a tablespoon) on top then baked uncovered for 25-30 minutes.  The flavor was very good.  Next time I make this I will make sure I have a fresh lemon, you can taste the difference, fresh is always best.

I thought this was fantastic. I went light on the lemon pepper as per other reviewers suggestions and then totally omited the ground pepper since I was using lemon pepper. I don't like too much black pepper. With these modifications the fish tasted perfect! Good job!

A simple recipe with few ingredients with a mild taste.  This would be perfect for a busy stay-at-home Mom or working Mom.  I personally prefer to make fish dishes with a bit more "punch", though.

We didn't care for this recipe much, the only thing we could taste was the lemon.  After all that preparation, I would've expected a more interesting flavor.

This sauce was so good!  I used it over Mahi Mahi fillets and it was delicious. I used the lemon pepper sparingly though...2 Tbsp. seemed like a lot! Thank you for a great recipe!

This is the first fish recipe I have ever attempted, and it turned out great! I also cooked the fish (cod: 1-inch filets) for 40 minutes. The only thing I would change would be to add much less salt, and maybe a little less lemon pepper.

I agree that this was way easy and very tasty........I sprinkled the pollack (CHEAP fish here in the Midwest) I used with some bread crumbs then topped with the butter sauce......Delicious!  Even the kids scarfed it down!

I thought this was decent.  It took forever for the fish (cod) to bake.  After 35 min, I turned up the heat to 400 and baked another 10 min. or so.  My husband said it was good, but I may not make this again.
