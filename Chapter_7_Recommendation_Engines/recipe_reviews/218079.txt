Love, love, loved this recipe...I cut the pork chops up into cubes and marinated them over night, and then grilled them on skewers with fresh veggies like kabobs!

Made this with the grilled soy-sesame asparagus and thai cucmber tomato salad...everything was very delicious.  The pork was moist and had a great taste.  The recipe made so much marinade we are going to use the rest of it for chicken tonight.

I made sure to marinate the chops overnight but was suprised by how little of the sweetness of the honey and the boldness of the Worcestershire sauce failed to come thorugh.  It was almost all lemon.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I think I would scale back the lemon juice a bit and boost the sweetness with some brown sugar as well as the honey.

This wasn't as flavorful as I would have hoped for the amount of ingredients it used.  It took all my honey and almost all my lemon juice; not a cheap recipe!  I marinated for about 5 hours.  I'd recommend going all day if you have the time.

This was a great recipe!! I made a couple small changes; we didn't enough lemon juice so I substituted 1 cup of the lemon juice for lemon-lime soda, and reduced the honey to about 1 1/4 cups. I also heated the marinade before putting the meat in to allow the honey to melt and the flavors to meld. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a tasty alternative to plain old pork chops, just be careful to watch the chops so they don't over cook! And marinate overnight :) Thanks for a great recipe and I hope more people will try this :D

This recipe was so-so. I made 4 big thick steaks, but there was only 1 eaten. I had family over and everyone went for the ribs and hubby was the only one that ate the one pork chop. My mom and dad tasted off my hubby's and said it was ok. I tasted it and found that it was a bit too tart. I can't say that I'd make again.  Sorry.

As soon as my daughter had a bite she said “five stars”.  I thought the marinade added wonderful flavor without overpowering the pork.   I marinated it for six hours which was perfect for us.

The cooking time must be a mis-print!!!  20-25 min for 1/2" pork chops?  I made this and the marinade is wonderful but they reached 143 degrees internal over med/high heat at 3-4 min per side and my chops were 1" thick.  Forget cooking times and trust your thermometer.  A chef once told me, 'if it looks like your pork is cooked just right, your have cooked it too long'.

Great base recipe! I did about half the amount of lemon juice and honey, added 3 more tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and 1/2 cup of sherry. all in all, it was a great recipe to build off of. We marinated for about an hour and a half, and the chops came out absolutely delicious and juicy. Thanks!

I  have made this recipe before and liked it.

Tonight I decided to do it again and low and behold, I had everything except lemons. 

OK,  I'll add something else, but what ? At first I thought, Vermouth, but when I opened my cabinet, what looked me in the face were my two bottles of Jack Daniels Tennessee.Fire. This is Jack Daniels blend of whisky, made with a cinnamon  liqueur.   Its excellent ! So, I added 1/2 cup to the marinade.

It was fantastic and I will use Jack Daniels again rather than lemons.

I used the marinade on boneless chicken thighs and they was delicious on the grill. Marinated them for almost 24 hrs before we grilled them and outside was lightly crispy from the honey but they were flavored all the way thru. My husband loved the fact they didn’t flame up when he placed them on the hot grill.

I substituted teriyaki for the soy sauce as the video suggested.  This will be among my favorites.  It is very flavorful.  Loved the sauce!  Will make this dish often!

Eh.  Too much lemon, not enough of anything else.  Can't taste the honey.  I think maybe more honey and possibly some  brown sugar.  It was just okay.  Definitely good for a picky kid but not an adult with a more sophisticated palate.  I paired it with a cranberry and feta salad with Ken's Walnut Vinagrette so that was a little better.

Not a lot of flavor and too lemony for my taste. We still ate them but probably won't make again

This marinade pleased even my pickiest eater! I will be making it again!! I marinated the pork chops overnight. 

I read someone in reviews saying the flavor didn't quite come through. Just in case, I punctured the meat a few times on each side with a fork before marinating.

We made these last night, and they were fantastic. I used two bone in chops- thick cut (1.5 in.)  and marinated them all night, and half the next day. Delicious! They were so tender and juicy. We will definitely make these again.

But you'll have dry pork chops if you grill them for longer than 5 or 6 minutes a side!

Mine were dry, but maybe I overcooked them.  I didn't grill it was too cold out, so I pan fried them instead.  I liked the flavor of the marinade without the Worcester sauce for fish!
