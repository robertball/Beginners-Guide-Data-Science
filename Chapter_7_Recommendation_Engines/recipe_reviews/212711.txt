This was a great recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!  It did take a bit longer than an hour for everything to be nice and tender, but I just covered it with foil and let it sit in the oven while other things were being finished.

I also followed the recipe and used 1 1/4 cups of salt even though it sounded like it was going to be awful... It was awful and ended up throwing the whole batch away. Now I see the recipe was updated to 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt... I can see that being much better.

Served this for Thanksgiving, family loved it.  Only used 1 cup of sugar as the apples & potatoes are sweet enough.  Will definitely make again.

This didn't turn out well at all. The sauce was gelatinous and had a strange texture.

I searched for a recipe utilizing apples and sweet potatoes as I had a couple of apples and one sweet potato handy.  I peeled and sliced the s. potatoes before cooking them for about 7 minutes.  I didn't have any cornstarch and of course used less of the other ingredients:  1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 cup white sugar, approx. 1 1/2 tsps cinnamon, a few scrapes of whole nutmeg, and added a total of 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons of Nocino (walnut liqueur).  Thanks for providing a good basis for my culinary experimentation!

I've made this for a few years now and it's a wonderful recipe - it's become a tradition in our family.  My method is a little different than the recipe as I don't like to boil the sweet potatoes and lose ANY nutrients, so I slice the sweet potatoes and apple about 1/4" thick, then layer them starting and ending with potatoes.  I allow my layers to be "porous", not covering ever speck of space so that the sauce can meander throughout.  This year I used Honeycrisp apples, so reduced the sugar to a scant cup as they are sweet & tried adding vanilla as another reviewer suggested.  I bake it until the potatoes are tender, not really caring how long it actually takes - an hour or so.  Excellent!

This is becoming a family favorite.  I do alter it, however, by halving the sugar and using 4 TBLS of butter.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and this was a great side dish.  Slight alterations: cut the sugar in half and used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg.  I microwaved the sweet potatoes which made peeling much easier and cut down on the oven time.  Will definitely be on the menu again next year!!

Made this for a potluck dinner--it was a huge success, received many compliments and requests for the recipe! I was a little short on time so I skipped the pre-boiling step. I cut the sweet potatoes and apples in 1/4" slices, used gala apples so reduced the sugar to a generous 3/4 cup. Combined apples, sweet potatoes and sauce in a large mixing bowl and mixed until well coated, then put into baking pan coated with no-stick spray and cooked for about an hour. Delicious!! Thanks for the yummy recipe! Will definitely make again!
