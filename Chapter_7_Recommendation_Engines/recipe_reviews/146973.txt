My husband said this tasted just like Starbucks (used all chocolate syrup and no white chocolate). Thanks!

This is one of my favorite coffee recipes. I like to add 1 tablespoon of unflavored fiber. You can't taste it and you have a delicious mocha that is healthy! Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummy! I added slightly less milk and skipped the whipped cream just because I had ran out. More of a chocolate drink than a coffee drink. Awesome.

I thought this tasted okay. I had lite chocolate syrup so I used that. I did not have white chocoate syrup, but I had bakers real white chocolate and used 1/2 square of that. I had not thought to combine the two flavors in one drink, so that was pretty interesting. The downside was it seemed like quite a bit of milk, just from looking at the recipe, compared to coffee. Although, it tasted fine, the end result made it taste to me more like mixed chocolate hot flavored milk than a coffee drink.

I made this in my Ninja Coffee Bar and wound up with a beautiful layered coffee drink. As far as the taste, I didn't think it was anything special. I don't think I will make it again.
