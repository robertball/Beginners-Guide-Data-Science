Absolutely incredible!  This was so easy to make and had a lot of flavor.  The next day I shredded the leftovers and mixed it with the guacamole and we spread it on tortillas then added various taco ingredients.  It was wonderful and the kids had fun making their own.

Very good.  The spiced up guacamole was different, but yummy.  We enjoyed this steak dinner.

Really enjoyed this horseradish guacamole.  I would probably prefer a different cut of meat.  But, overall I really enjoyed.

My avocados weren't quite ripe, so it turned out like Wasabi.  Seasoning was fine, just not worth the effort for the "green stuff."

I made the guacamole tonight with my choice of steak.  It was good, however, the taste of the guacamole overpowered the steak.  I'll use the leftover guac. for chips.  If I make this again, it won't be for steak, it will be as a dip.

Horseradish sauce needs a little more flavor, if you can believe it, horseradish is strong but needs a "flaaavah".  Garlic salt works nicely.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe but I think I used a little too much horseradish.  Overall it was pretty good and I like the uniqueness of the recipe.  Will definitely try again with other cuts of meat.

I didn't marinate the steaks first, just covered them with a simple dry rub and grilled them on the bbq. The guacamole is very yummy but it made way to much. I halved the recipe but it still made enough for a family of six!

Yummy!  I marinated the steaks in Chipotle Tobasco and it worked great.  I ate the horseradish guac on my steak and loved it.  My husband doesn't like to "cover up the flavor of his steak" so he just ate it with tortilla chips and it was just as yummy!

I will play a bit with this recipe as it sounds good, but the end result needs a bit of refining.

Not a fan of the horseradish guacamole, I thought the horseradish totally took over the avocado.

This is a unique steak accompaniment!  I didn't have any sour cream or yogurt on hand so I omitted cut the other ingredients in half (excluding the avocado - I used 1 whole one).

I thought this was very good, but next time I make it, I will make a few changes.  I will marinate the steaks in my own home made marinade instead of the bought steak sauce which we didn't care for and I think I will add the horseradish to the marinade (as we love horseradish, but not so much in the guacamole).  But I thank you for a great idea on grilled steaks. They looked very impressive on the plate with baked potato, griled mushrooms and sliced fresh tomatoes.

Great flavor. Recipe makes way too much guacamole--you could easily cut it in half and still have plenty.

This is awesome!  Most of the time, I grill the steaks with Everglades seasoning and use this guacamole.  Though, I generally use a few servings just for myself.  Mmmm, avacados!

This sounded a little "wierd" at first...putting green guac on a steak?  I didn't have any dill on hand so made it without - we both loved it.  Great unexpected mix of flavors!!  We made it a second time & included the dill, and we didn't like it near as much.  Will definitely be making alot in the future (just dill-less) ..thanks for a twist on plain 'ol steak !

Used this with ribeyes; I cheated and used ready made guacamole and added the remaining ingredients like sour cream, dill and Worcesteshire. I thought it was a little bit bland however.

The guacamole on top was great, we had some left over and saved it for the next evening and used it on grilled pork, which was also a very good combination.

This was a complete hit.  I grilled peppers and green onions to go with it.  I would add the  horseradish to taste.

This was a really neat idea.  I give it 4 stars for origionality.  However, the horseradish was overpowering.  I would try this again but scale way back on the horseradish.

Being a college student this was a gormet dinner for me. Seriously though the avacado sauce and steak combination was incredible.
