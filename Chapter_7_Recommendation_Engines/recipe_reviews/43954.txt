I almost skipped this recipe because of the 80% fat and high calories, but I'm so glad I didn't.  It was terrific even with adjustments which reduced the fat to 54% (still high) and the calories by 2/3.  Used 1 lb green beans for 4 servings, not 6.  Steamed the beans in the microwave for 5 minutes, meanwhile cooked 2 slices of bacon.  Poured off all but 1 tsp drippings and added 1 tsp canola oil.  Deglazed the pan with 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar.  Stir fried the beans and 2 Tbsp walnuts for about 1 minute.  Crumbled the bacon and 2 Tbsp blue cheese on top. Fabulous, rich flavor combination, definitely company quality, and ready in about 10 minutes.

I used olive oil and feta cheese instead of bacon fat and blue cheese.  Didn't measure, just browned some walnuts in the oil, threw in the steamed beans and heated through, added feta and served.  This was un- believable! It was so delicious.  My husband and two six-footer boys loved it. Not a scrap left.

This is absolutely WONDERFUL!  The second time we made it, we substituted Feta for Bleu cheese (or some of each), sauteed the beans in olive oil/garlic rather than bacon grease, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Healthier, and just as good.

This was great!  Fried up a couple pieces turkey bacon, then tossed the green beans in the pan (only had a tbs. or so of drippings so it wasn't too greasy or fatty) and cut the bacon into small pieces and tossed that in also. The blue cheese and walnuts really added great flavor and texture. Will definitely make this again.

Oh my gosh...these were absolutely delish!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  It is amazing how such a simple recipe could have such depth of flavor.  Great for a holiday or an elegant dinner party.  Guess I already know what I will be bringing to Thanksgiving this year!  Thanks Kate:)

The family really liked this.  The only thing I did different was adding crumbled bacon instead of the toasted nuts.  There were no leftovers and I will definitely make this again.

Top notch! Star and save this delicious recipe. Crispy fresh green beans, crispy bacon and melted blue cheese or gorgonzola. The one veggie dish that everyone loves. Much requested, always an empty bowl.  If I could only have one veggie recipe, this would be it!

These were quite good.  I did not have bacon drippings, so I used olive oil and added bacon bits.  It turned just fine.  Leftovers were good, too.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving - it was absolutely delicious and a great change to the normal holiday green bean dishes.    Also great with steaks - really compliments beef.

I found this recipe while looking for a similar dish that my sister-in-law makes.  I only changed this recipe slightly to make it more like hers.  I omitted the salt and pepper, cooked 1/2 lb of bacon and chopped it up to put in the green beans, and added more blue cheese.  Healthy? Nope. No way.  But, I seriously have DREAMS about these green beans!  :~)

I did not care for this recipe. Because they used bacon drippings, it made it taste sooo fatty and heavy. The taste from the bacon drippings was way to strong, I will not make this again

Delicious! Instead of bacon drippings, I used about a 1/3 cup of diced proscuitto meat ends which I fried at a low heat with one diced red onion. Beautiful.

This was so yummy! I only had pre-cooked bacon and it didn't give me very much "drippings".  So I added a little bit of peanut oil to  the tiny bit of drippings that I had and then threw in the 3 pieces of pre-cooked bacon that I had crisped and crubmled. Wow! I've been thinking about making more ever since.

Amazing side dish at our Thanksgiving dinner. I did use feta and added some fried onions to the bacon drippings. I used about half of the amount of drippings and it was plenty. Crumbled bacon was also a nice addition.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it just didn't taste as good as I'd hoped. I was bummed, especially after reading all the reviews - I had high expectations! WAY too much bacon drippings for us - I'd recommend cutting back on that (I fried fresh bacon, too, just to get that 1/4 cup!), and the blue cheese was simply a wierd combination! I did like the walnuts tossed in, though! IF I ever make this again I'll use some other kind of cheese, like Feta or Asiago. ANYTHING but blue cheese - and we LOVE blue cheese, which is why I'm so disappointed. Sorry. I wish I could have given this a better rating.

Delishious! Made it to bring to Ryan's parents house for Thanksgiving. Everyone seemed to like it alot. Ryan and I loved it! we will make it again. I added crumbled bacon to the recipe. It's stupid that you have to cook bacon to use the greese and not use the bacon, so I added it. I'm glad I did.

Made these for Christmas and they were a hit.  Very easy to prepare.  I used the pre-cooked bacon in the pouches that you can find by the salad dressing mixes and bacon bits.  It was real bacon and instead of the bacon fat I used olive oil and it worked out just fine and was very tasty.  Nice change to ordinary green beans.  Thank you!

This is a delicious dish and I was quite pleased with it. The taste combines well with any meat recipe using Worchestershire sauce (I did the "Baked Lamb Chops" submitted by Leslie W. Dobson).

Got rave reviews when I took this to a dinner party.  Didn't have bacon, so I sauteed beans in butter and olive oil.  Also added roasted red peppers, chopped, for color and added flavor.  Pretty and delicious!

The combination of bleu cheese, bacon, and walnuts is excellent.  I didn't bother cutting up the green beans.  I think they look and taste better left long.  There was a bit too much bacon fat, though.  I would reduce the amount next time.  Also, I chopped and added the bacon I had cooked for the drippings to the beans. Great recipe.

This was awesome! I was sort of surprised my kids not only tried it, but liked it and asked for seconds! I cooked the beans in chicken stock instead of water and subbed Feta for the Blue Cheese since we are not fans of it. I did saute my walnuts in butter with minced garlic because the mixture was left over from a chicken dish I was making. I think it added a nice dimension to the dish. I also added 4-5 pieces of crumbled bacon. I've got 17 bags of fresh picked green beans from the garden-I will certainly be making this dish again. Next time I will try it as written (minus the blue cheese)! Thanks!

It wasn't great but it was easy to make. I made a few alterations to spice things up a bit and lower the calories. Instead of pork bacon I used turkey bacon. However, turkey bacon doesn't have a lot of fat so I had to pour in a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil to keep the turkey and green beans from sticking to the pan. I also added sun-dried tomato, which was great with the blue cheese and walnuts.  When I'm not on the South Beach diet, I will definitely try it with real pork bacon. I bet it would change the taste drastically. Yum!

super yummy!! ... But I also didn't like the high fat content, so I took out the bacon grease and used olive oil and used feta cheese instead of blue cheese!  My kids loved it too :)

This is SO good! We made it without the bacon grease and put in a little margarine and olive oil instead to make it a bit more cholesterol friendly, but it was still amazing.

My husband and I thought these were fabulous! I think next time I will reduce the bacon dripping by half. We had gorgonzola instead of bleu cheese, but came out great just the same. Very elegant!

Nice change for green beans, but I will make some changes. The next time I make this I'll use less bacon drippings & blue cheese. (we don't use blue cheese often, so it seemed strong to us) I did add crumbled bacon instead of the walnuts, but will try adding the walnuts next time also.

Used what I had on hand:  olive oil instead of bacon fat, slivered almonds instead of walnuts, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic salt.  Used blue cheese and sprinkled with crumbled bacon that I had in the freezer.  Delicious!

An incredibly delicious & E-Z side dish for we lovers of Blue Cheese.  I must however say, that we choose to eat very healthy at least 95% of the time, but once in a while....a terrific (but somewhat unhealthy) recipe comes along, so we then definitely have the room in our diets to indulge.  I used Maple Smoked Bacon, so the overall flavor was divine.  Thanks so much for posting this.

I made this for a large party. Talk about no left overs!! I did manage to forget the blue cheese & omitted the nuts (in case of allergies) & it still disappeared!
Keeping this one on hand!!

These green beans would please a 5 year old. I did not have bacon grease so I warmed some left over bacon in olive oil and substituted cranraisens for pecans. (Didn't have pecans either) . Great recipe.

Loved it! Second time, threw in some  caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms leftover from burger toppings... YUM!! Other times we've tossed with balsamic vinegar or Worcestershire to give a little depth. Great recipe, thanks!

Fantastic!  I made them for Thanksgiving and people were asking for more!  The Green Bean bowl was empty on the table!  That never happens to vegetables in our family.  I have been asked to make them again for Christmas Dinner!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very nice!  I served this as a side to Gourmet Mushroom Risotto from this site.  I cooked the beans and got everything prepped first.  Then, when the risotto was done, I did the rest.  Very tasty and an easy companion to a complicated main dish. Thanks!

I made these last night and they were incredible. These green beans certainly could be served for a special occasion but are simple and quick enough to make for any meal. Not being able to get past the vomity taste of Blue Cheese I always swap it out for herbed Feta which is what I used. No the recipe is not low fat but then nothing in my kitchen is and I don't worry about that. Now I can't wait to pick my first batch of green beans this coming spring.
