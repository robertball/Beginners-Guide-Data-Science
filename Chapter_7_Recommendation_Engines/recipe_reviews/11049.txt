I am so disappointed.  I was really looking forward to baking these cookies, but when I started preparing the dough I realized that I had just run out of flour while making my famous coconut-free coconut cake!  So I salvaged the ingredients and made a batch of flourless Cow Pie cookies, the cowpie-free version, of course.(http://cookie.allrecipes.com/az/cowpies.asp)

I wanted to make chocolate chip cookies for my 8 year old daughter's birthday party at school, and had all the ingredients... except the brown sugar!!  It was too late to go to the store, the kids were already sleeping, so I came online hoping to get lucky... and boy did I!!  I must admit.. they are not the best cookies... BUT... they were definitely good!!  My daughter now has cookies to bring in to her friends tomorrow.  THANK YOU!! :-)

These cookies turned out WONDERFUL!!  Honey is a nice touch. I've been looking for a great recipe for years making homemade cookies without chocolate chips, I would always have the problem with them poofing up too high and getting cakey.  These turned out great.  They settled about 1/4 inch thick and browned nicely around the edges.  I only kept them in the oven for 6 1/2 mintues and let them finish baking on the sheet outside the over for 3 more minutes before I removed them to a cooling rack.  The kids gobbled them all up immediately!

I wanted to make Chocolate Chip cookies for work and started with my butter and sugar only to realize I had no brown sugar so I came to the site to find a great recipe and I sure did.  I used white chocolate chips instead because my boss is allergic to other chocolate.  The guys at work dug right in.  These turned out nice and moist.  I didn't have a problem with them flattening out like a few others.  I find if you mix cookies by hand, you don't overwork the dough and cause them to spread.

I wouldn't say these are the best in a perfect world, but if you're living in an area where brown sugar and chocolate chips aren't readily available (or cost prohibitive) this recipe is great!  It produces a soft, chocolate chunk cookie that totally fits the bill to ease the Toll House cravings!

I thought this cookie tasted good.  The texture was too cake like, almost like a muffin.  I used this recipe because I had neither brown sugar nor chocolate chips.  I took a bar of dark chocolate, and chopped it up.  Considering the lack of ingredients I had, they were satisfying.  I did not like the consistency of the batter, it wasn't solid enough and after I placed them in the oven they were very runny and thin.  Next time, I would probably make sure I have the proper ingredients.

OMG, this is such a hit! I am not in the states, so I cannot get chocolate chips. This recipe rocks! I am a bit lazy to chop up the chocolate, so I use the Czech equivalent of M & Ms and it turns out lovely (and colorful!) Highly recommended!

I have not tried this recipe, but just a hint to people who happen to have molasses on hand even if not brown sugar-- just mix a spoon or two of molasses with white sugar and it tastes the same in baked goods. It's a similar idea to the honey in this recipe I suppose.

Nothing amazing, they spread like crazy, turned totally flat, burnt around the edges, next time I will reduce te time they are in for and put table-spoon size cookies on the sheet. The parts that arent burnt taste ok.

I was a little leery of a recipe for chocolate chip cookies that had honey in it, because I don't care for honey and I was afraid you would be able to taste it in the cookies. But I was out of brown sugar and decided to give it a try. I did use 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate it calls for. Also I used a cup of butter and 1/2 cup Crisco. The batter was really good; you couldn't taste the honey at all. In fact, the only difference really was that the batter was lighter in color than it would be with brown sugar. They cooked up beautifully, with the perfect crispness on the outside and soft inside. I almost like them better than the Nestle Tollhouse recipe.

I have gestational diabetes and have been craving cookie dough for the last 2 weeks. All the recipes i love have brown sugar, and i have not found a brown sugar substitute and am trying to cut "real" sugar out of my diet....So these did the trick. I didn't bake them, i just wanted the dough, but the dough was so smooth and tasted yummy. Thanks for curing my craving, you will be blessed for it!!

Not the worst taste, but the texture of the cookie and consistency of the dough were really off. The salt was missing in the steps and the cookies just turned out runny and burnt. I think there's a reason we should bake with brown sugar.

This is just what I was looking for. I'm in Germany and haven't found brown sugar or choco chips. I also had to substitute 3 tsp baking powder for the soda. I hand mixed because that is what I have. They turned out perfect. I'm not sure what they will be like when they cool, or if they will last that long.

Excellent recipe though I changed it a bit. I didn't use salt, walnuts, or honey, and I used a little less butter. (about a cup). I whipped it with an electric mixer. I chopped up Kit Kats, Coffee Crisps, and added chocolate chips. Put them in the oven for about ten minutes, in little round balls, and they came out perfectly fluffy and soft. Everyone loved them and said they were awesome.

These turned out great!  I didn't have brown sugar on hand and need to bake something quick for a gift.  I found that baking them at 350 for 12 minutes worked better. :)

I love the use of honey - I tend not to like overly sweet goodies, and it was the perfect taste of sweet without being overly sugary!  I did use chocolate chips, though... :)

I was very pleased that this recipe didn't include brown sugar because I never have any!  Haha.  I was also pleased at how easy it was to make because I'm certainly not the most handy in the kitchen.  They came out very tasty :)

I was just baking these cookies and I was surprised at how good they were. This is a 4 out of 5 star worthy recipe. It was also easy to use which meant I could make this for my class. Interesting is how I made a batch of 72 cookies, and there don't seem to be enough!

Started making my chocolate chip cookies and realized that i had no brown sugar! The cookies were good, a little bit to see for my liking. Next time I would cut down a bit on the sugar or honey. They had the same consistency, just a bit on the sweet side.

I haven't been cooking that long, in fact, when I left high school I barely knew how to make Mac and Cheese.. NO joke, but, after getting married I decided it would be best to learn.  I've discovered a new great passion of mine, and it started with this recipe.  After deciding I wanted to make CCC's from scratch instead of picking up some you "just add water with" I bought all the ingredients I thought I'd need - -  except for brown sugar.   So I looked for a recipe that uses NO brown sugar, I stumbled upon this. I didn't use Baking Soda, either, and the cookies ended up being perfect.  I've tried other recipes, even ones WITH brown sugar, and I honestly believe that nothing can compare. Not only do I love them, but my mother is jealous that I can make cookies better than her!  It's also great if you add quite a bit of Nutmeg :)

I loved this recipe! I used it because I was out of brown sugar and needed an alternative. My 8 year old son said they were the best cookies I've EVER made!

These are amazing!! I am in a place where brown sugar doesn't seem to exist and honey was great addition.  I accidently used twice as much honey but would recommend this change - they turned out chewy and wonderful! Maybe the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made..

I found this recipe years ago when my sister and I wanted chocolate chip cookies but we had no brown sugar and no one to drive us to the store. All these years later it's still my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe for everything, though I leave out the nuts and tend to use mini-chocolate chips.

The batter tasted too salty, i ran out of butter so i used vegetable oil so the batter also tasted weird. but when i baked it i made them huge! I just wasn't in the mood for small cookies. I didn't add walnuts or stuff i didn't like and hoped the recipe worked… just like the batter it turned out too salty, too fluffy. i was honestly disappointed both at this recipe and all recipe.com

I just made this recipe and I have to say it turned out very well! I did a variation with chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and walnuts. They came out a little crisp on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. I was wondering how the honey would change the taste and consistency and I really don't notice the difference hardly at all. The honey has a nice and sweet taste to it and you get a small hint when eating the cookies. Over all a good recipe!

I just tried this recipe.  Pretty good flavor, but like another reviewer said it was like cake not a cookie.
