Instead of preparing this with all the dry ingretients and vanilla - just put the can of cherry pie filling in the bottom, then spread a box of Jiffy yellow or white cake mix on top (DON'T mix anything in with it - just dump the dry mix on top) then pour on 1/2 to 1 c. milk and 1 stick of melted butter or margerine - DO NOT STIR.  Cook as directed...

Excellent idea!  I doubled the cherry pie filling (not the topping), I have a large family and I was using a large crockpot. FABULOUS!  I also tried the recipe with regular canned peaches (2 large cans for a regular size crockpot), drained, adding 1 TBSP. of Bisquick & 1 tsp. cinnamon as a thickener.  It was a huge SUCCESS! I will do this more often, so it doesn't heat up my house so much during the summer!  Thank You!

My husband tried this the first time and said I should prepare it weekly!  I used a good-quality pie filling and skim milk with great results.  It smells so good and it's nice to free up the oven for other things.

Delicious version of a great dish and easy too. Great for cooking up during the summer when you don't want to heat up the kitchen with a hot oven.

This version is for the smaller crock-pots. For the 5-6 quart pots, double the cherries but not the topping.

Very bland. I added almond extract and doubled the sugar to the flour mixture. The result was similar to cobbler but the dough wasn't the same. It was more like a very bland cake. The idea of a cobbler in the crock pot is ingenius so I am going to experiment on my own. I won't be making this recipe again.

Very good and very simple. I did the prep for this in 10 minutes and that was with my 8 month old son playing in my cupboards under my feet. My husband came home and ate most of it out of the pot. Very good.

I could not find any cherry in my local store, so I chose apple instead.  It was finished by 2 hours-very easy.  But, crust is very bland and I prefer baking instead.  If need a quick dessert just for quick fix but certainly not great for entertaining/impressing guests with this one.  I'll stick with baking and a better recipe.

This was pretty bland. I will definately put more sugar in it if I ever make it again. I might double the cherry pie filling too.

I had to add 2 tbs of milk to the topping. I'm curious to know how anyone else was able to spread their topping over the cherries since mine was very sticky and sank immediately. I like the concept of the slow cooker but not this particular recipe.

Cobbler?  More like warm cherries with a pancake on top.  Whipped cream helps, but I couldn't get over the thick pancake that forms on top of the cherries.

This was ok, but I was expecting it to be more like regular cobbler. This had a more cake like consistancy. It was good, but would rather have traditional cobbler

I tried this recipe but I wanted to make more so I doubled the entire recipe. Next time I will only double the cherries. The cake (topping) was not bad but really thick. I will try again to perfect it.

I tried to doctor it up and nothing helped. No flavor what so ever. Would definitely not make this again.

I used a can of cherry pie filling, then put a box of yellow cake mix (reg size, not Jiffy), 1 c of milk and 1 stick of melted butter on top. I took another reviewer's advice NOT TO MIX IT. 
**Didn't work for me**
It still had uncooked cake mix.  Duh.  I want to try this again but mix the last 3 ingredients, then top the cherries. It took about 2 hours  on low.

Very chewy consistency - somewhat bland.  No one wanted to eat the leftovers.

1.14.18  First, this recipe is titled incorrectly.  It's definitely not a cobbler, more like a “dump cake.”  Not sure what happened, but after 3-1/2 hours using the slow cooker feature on my Instapot®, this was not cooked.  I then put it into a 350ºF oven for 20 minutes to complete the baking.  Since this had a cherry filling and there were some comments about the cake being bland, I used almond extract instead of vanilla, tasted the batter which was void of flavor, so I added more almond extract. Yes, it was easy, and it was eaten, but not really enjoyed.  Simple and quicker to bake something like this rather than using a slow cooker; just too many issues, not making again.
