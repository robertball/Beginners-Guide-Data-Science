4 stars because as written the recipe is time consuming. Lots of unnecessary steps and dirty dishes. I chopped the mushrooms, bell peppers, and some onion on a fine dice and mixed it with the shredded cheese, oregano, and salt and pepper. I stuffed this into my hollowed out (but not pre-cooked) zucchini boats. I lined them all up in a baking dish, covered with foil, and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes until the zucchini were fork tender. It was delicious! I made it twice in one week because it was so good.

Amazing recipe! My boyfriend and i loved it! I made some changes, I switched the Parmesan cheese with Feta. We (especially I) love feta and when crumbled on top of food and then baked in the oven it get this delicious crisp on top. We also had cooked ground beef from the day before, I added some of it to the stuffing 1-2 mins before it was done. It was delicious!

WOW! I saw this in the daily recipe today and was impressed. As I went to make dinner I realized I had most of the ingredients just out of the garden. I used a green bell pepper and a zucchini and a yellow squash and portabello mushrooms. Instead of stuffing the zucchini I merely chopped them up and sauted them with butter, salt and pepper and some garlic and onion powder. Added the flour and oregano, then mexican blend cheese, put it into a buttered casserole dish and grated pecorino romano over the top. Baked it at 350 F for 15 mins. YUM, YUM, YUM. Will stuff the zucchini next time.

A great recipe and delicious dish. I replaced the butter with coconut oil, the all-purpose flour with spelt flour, the Monterey Jack cheese with melting sheep cheese and the Parmesan cheese with Parmesan-like goat cheese. Very healthy, easy and delicious. It takes time for preparation for first timers.

Delicious!  This was a great way of cooking the zucchini so I didn't have to use the oven long.  Yum!

This was an excellent vegetarian dish!  I used four zucchini to make the "stuffing" stretch a little further, and thought it was perfect.  I also used 1/2 c. cheddar cheese and 1/2 c. motz., since that's what I had on hand.    I will definitely make this again!  Great for an easy weeknight meal.

This is amazing.  I can't believe how easy this was and how great it tasted.  Made it exactly as written, only added salt and pepper to the mix.  Will make again!

The flavor is good, although I thought it was under spiced, but that's because of the butter and cheese.  I used it as an appetizer so portions were reduced. 

That said, for those looking for "vegetarian" and who automatically think that translates to "healthy," it does not.  There's lots of cheese here which means lots of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. What's in this recipe is a huge amount for what this is.   Find reduced fat cheeses, at a minimum.

This was really good. Another reviewer commented on the amount of fat this meal had - I completely disagree. You need the cheese for flavor and protein so it holds you for a few hours. Feel free to use feta, sharp cheddar, more parmesan - get flavor in there!

Great recipe - very easy to customize to your own tastes (I added garlic and vidalia onions, some leftover steak and a smidge of horseradish). Personally, I work hard enough during the day to metabolize the the small amount of "evil" butter and cheese.  Life is short - work hard and enjoy dinner.  Thanks for a wonderful way to use up a very prolific garden veggie.

This was very good and so easy to make! I left out the peppers since our family doesn't like any type of them at all and sprinkled a little garlic salt over the zucchini once the filling was in. My husband thinks I'm the greatest wife ever when I make him wonderful dinners like this. I'll be passing this recipe on to my parents who grow zucchini in their garden and get tired of having it the same old way.

Very good! I used portobello mushroom caps, chopped. I did use olive oil instead of butter - sauteed some onion and garlic along with the peppers and mushrooms. Yummy. Thanks :)

Pretty tasty, I just purchased some organic mushrooms, red bell peppers and Zucchini, so I decided to try this. I didn't have Monterey Jack, so, I used a Mexican Blend of shredded cheese. Looks very impressive.

Great dish, would have added a bit more pepper and salt to season. Also, I substituted the Monterey Jack with cheddar cheese and the finished product was a little greasy for my taste. Next time I'll put a little less cheese and more veggies. Otherwise, loved it!

Absolutely delicious. Only change was to sub bottled bell pepper for fresh (because that's what I keep on hand). Still good reheated in the oven the next day. Served as main dish for me (vegetarian) and side dish with fish for BF (omnivore).

My husband loves these! I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I did have to substitute cheddar for the jack cheese, but that's the only change I made.

As the recipe is, I give it 4 stars. 2nd time around I made some improvements: I didn't have fresh red bell peppers in the house so I used a small jar of roasted red peppers. I also added 1/2 a small onion. The mixture was a little too mushy so I added a few tablespoons of breadcrumbs to the stuffing as well as additional salt & pepper to taste. Topped with a very small amount of parmesan and cheddar cheese before broiling. I also found that 10 minutes was too long for boiling--I had HUGE zucchini and I feel it only took approx. 8 minutes

I thought this recipe was wonderful!!!!  And....as many cooks do....I tweeked it a little.  I added fresh garlic and basil (omitted the oregano) to the mushrooms and peppers, I used mozzarella and topped it with Monerey Jack and fresh parsley.  I love the simplicity of the recipe and the vairations that can make it something entirely different.

We thought these were just okay.  We wanted to love these, as a meatless meal would be good now and then, but it lacked seasoning.  Gave it a four stars because the recipe has promise so I will tweak and make again.

These are soooo delicious! We rarely have meatless meals, but we went meatless with this one. I had very little monterey jack, so I used what I had and added in some mozarella to fill. I also skipped cooking the zucchini first since I went pretty close to the outer peel when skipping the innards. I spread a little bit of marinara on the top of each zucchini log prior to baking. 

These made a great meal that everyone in the family (1 year old, 5 year old, and two adults) loved. Even my daughter, who usually rejects mushrooms because of the texture they develop after they cook loved this one. 

It was a nice change to have something stuffed that did not involve sausage!

I absolutely loved these!! I did sprinkle more shredded cheese on top of them when I baked them. They were so good that I ate all but 1/2 of them in two days. My hubby only ate half because he is VERY picky, but he did say they were good. This is a keeper!!

Excellent with these changes based on the reviews and what I had on hand: doubled the mushrooms and added about 1/4 c. finely diced onion, jarred minced garlic, extra oregano, salt, pepper and about 3 ounces cream cheese to the stuffing mix.  Also used grated Parmesan and shredded cheddar on top.  Broiled about 6 minutes and they were excellent.  A little time consuming, but very easy.  Boiling the zucchini until tender and scooping out most of the inside is key. This was the first thing on my husband's plate to be finished! Will make again.

THIS IS SO GREAT!!!  I love zucchini and I swear this is the best I ever had.  I'm glad I didn't add sausage, it didn't need it.  The only changes I made was I used a 4 cheese Italian mix instead of Mont Jack cause that's all I had on hand.  And I added some black pepper to the mixture.  SOOOO GOOD.  Even the kids loved it!  Thanks for the new family favorite.

Love zucchini...but the ones I found at my store were way too small too stuff....so I chopped all my veggies and made into a casserole instead. I did grill my veggies first and added some whole wheat bread crumbs to the top. Nice side dish....will stuff next time I get my hands on some large zukes. Thanks!

These were pretty good.  I used a bit more oregano than suggested (because some other reviews said it needed more seasoning), and next time I would use use even more.  If I hadn't added more it would have been bland.  I also added pepper for the same reason.  I also would add more mushrooms because they tasted really good and there wasn't enough of them!

I tried to cut the cheese way down on this for healthier options, but it created a wetter option than i'd have liked.  I think bigger chunks and more mushrooms would be great I used a 6oz package and would like to have doubled it.. also a little bread crumb or something to firm up the filling would have been a good option.  I'll try it again soon.

I love this dish!  An easy way to scoop the zucchini out of the peels is to use a vegetable peeler.  I do not vary the recipe and it is perfect.

I'm so glad I found this recipe to satisfy my craving for zucchini. I chopped my veggies rather finely so they would fit nicely. It was delicious with a crusty roll. Absolutely going to make this again!

Made this last night and it was delicious. 4 stars because the zucchini took 25 mins.  to cook, not 10 and I had to add way more spices, like a tablespoon of Italian mixed spices.  Next time I will add onion and try the baking recommendation...and the next time will be soon!

I used this recipe as a template because I wanted something with less cheese (I'm testing this combo for a non-pasta alternative to traditional  manicotti).  This is a solid recipe, easy to change to your family's taste (and your time constraints).  My grandmother always salted her hulled zucchini (to allow moisture to drain out), so I did that about 30 minutes prior to stuffing.  I used about 1 cup of large diced mushrooms (brown), about 1/4 of a large onion diced, and 1/4 cup red bell pepper.  I sautéed per the recipe, then added the diced zucchini and sautéed another 5 minutes or so.  I wanted more of an Italian flair, so I used 1/4 teaspoon of dried Italian herbs, about a healthy 1/3rd cup of the Trader Joe's light cheese blend and 2 tablespoons of the grated parm.  I stuffed the uncooked zucchini halves and topped with the remaining 2 tablespoons of parm cheese.  I covered with foil and baked for about 25 minutes covered at 350, like another reviewer.  Great flavor, but a tad too cheesy for us (and I cut it significantly).  We will definitely have again.

Like another reviewer said, scooped them out, mix your filling ingredients together, stuff them, and bake them. I thought they were super yummy, next time I'll add tomatoes instead of the bell peppers, though. Or maybe both?  There definitely will be a next time!

It's a great recipe when used as a guide. I prefer easier methods, more flavor and spices. But for a beginner, this is a good recipe.

This was excellent! My husband was convinced it had meat in it-Ha! I did not use the oregano or the flour, though, just a chopped onion and a couple teaspoons of curry powder and red pepper flakes for some fire. Oh, and I did not boil the zucchini. It took about 20min at 380 in the oven and then 4min under the broiler. It will go in the Big Book of Keepers!

Easy elegance and great flavor. I live in an Eskimo village, and pay a premium for a weekly organic produce box from Full Circle--so I treat every bit as a precious resource. My husband is not a huge fan of vegetables, and this is one of his favorite dishes.

Wow!  Added a cup of spicy sausage for my meat eater and a large clove of garlic; had to sub provolone for the stuffing and four-cheese italian for the top.  Omitted flour and replaced butter w/EVOO (trying to go low-carb).  Son & DiL are vegan, so looking forward to making this w/o sausage, but will make this over and over again.  My youngest fantisized how it would taste w/a little pizza sauce between the stuffing and the parmesan.  This will be a family favorite from now on.  Thanks!!!

Quick question, maybe theres a better way to do this?....what can I add to this instead of mushrooms?  I don't like mushrooms very much, but would love to try a stuffed zucchini.  What could I put in its place?

I made a few changes: added about 2 tablespoons of sour cream and a bit more oregano to the vegetable mix and omitted the bell pepper (though the pepper would no doubt be a tasty addition, I didn't have one on hand). Yum.

Made it last month. Seems like a lot of steps, but easy if you have a food processor!  I made it for a vegetarian friend and everyone (including the meat eaters) had some.  They LOVED IT!  I did sprinkle some Parmesan, Romano & Asiago cheese (came mixed) over it.   Making it again by request for BBQ tomorrow

I gave it 4 stars as written, 5 stars with minor modifications.  The stuffing was slightly underseasoned so I added 1 clove garlic sauteed, a sprinkling of Adobo Goya seasoning and 2 tsp fresh oregano.

Yummy and relatively guilt-free meatless meal but missing... something. Used mozzarella instead of the monterey jack because that's what I had on hand, and added chopped kale to the mushroom and bell pepper mix. Next time I'll experiment with more spices and top it with breadcrumbs.

Loved it! I took the advice of a another reviewer of this recipe and just hollowed out the zucchini raw - no boiling. Sauteed the mushroom and red pepper and added the zucchini filling, seasoning, and cheese. Since the zucs were raw, I covered with foil and baked for 20 minutes and an additional 5 without the foil. I think next time I might use pepper jack instead of Monterey jack! Or add some red pepper flakes for a little kick :)
We had it as a side dish for some grilled chicken and it was delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

Very yummy, one of our new regulars. Amounts were a little off, I used heaping amounts of shrooms, peppers, and cheese and flesh of 4 zucchinis and had enough filling for 3. Thanks Sheri!

this was a great starting point for us.. i didn't have any red bell pepper so i substituted some leftover pico de gallo from Baja Fresh.. i used Amanda_H's advice and mixed the veggies and oregano together, placed in the boats, and cooked in the oven until almost tender, then melted a lot less than called for cheese (mozz) over them.. next time since i didn't boil the zucchinis in the salted water i'd salt and pepper the boats before adding in the filing.. ty for the inspiration

A versatile dish, you name it you can stuff it with so many different ingredients to create new flavors. I baked my zucchini uncooked, and also mixed ingredients together and stuffed them. I didnt sauté them first to save steps. Cooking time will vary depending on size of zucchini and that it's uncooked ahead of time. It was a hit in my house.
We will definately be enjoying this more often.

very cheesy but it was fine. won't be in a hurry to make this again. Added onion powder and used Italian spices instead of oregano because I was afraid it would be bland..and it was! Thanks anyway:)

Definitely a new cook, but this recipe was easy and delicious! I added some onion to the filling and less cheese, only because we only had about a quarter cup left in the house-oops! It still came out wonderful! I definitely had to sacrifice some of the zucchini 'boats' after they tore, so I had a few half sized ones. No complaints around the house though!

Followed the recipe pretty closely, using one large zucchini, the equvalent of 3 regular size. I did up the oregano to 1/2 tsp. as per other reviews, but could not detect, next time would try 1 tsp. I did add 1/3 cup of breadcrumbs, but still found the final result lacked texture. Also, pretty cheesy, but I used med. cheddar, so monterey, as called for in the recipe, or other mild cheese might be better. I can see where the italian sausage used in other similar recipes would add more texture, and spice... will try that next... or tweak this one with just a little more spice. Thanks for submitting, great way to use more of that zucchini.

This is a recipient that is easy to suit to your taste.  I added spinach and stuffing to the mushrooms and peppers.  Delicious!
