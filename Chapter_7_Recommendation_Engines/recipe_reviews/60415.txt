UPDATE 11/2/2010   I am the submitter of this recipe.  Since many cooks are having problems with the consistency of this recipe, I am thinking the best way to cook this is with a double boiler.  If you do not have a double boiler set a glass bowl on top of a pan of water and bring to a boil; do not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl and above all be patient. 

The last time I made this for Chicken Enchiladas it was a bit too 'buttery' when I took them out of the oven.  So, you might want to cut the butter in half.

12/27/2005

I am adding this addition to my comments above on this recipe to make directions a bit more clear---DO NOT BOIL--DO NOT SIMMER---HEAT VERY GENTLY, STIRRING CONSTANTLY OR WILL NOT BE THE PROPER CONSISTENCY INTENDED--if used as a sauce going into the oven, the bubbling from the oven heat will not cause consistency problems many have had--

This is the exact same cheese dip the mexican rest. serves. I think the other reviews that were failures used the wrong type of cheese, all monterey jack is NOT the same. In fact the cheaper processed cheese food version of monterey jack works better than the good stuff. Certainly do not overcook.  You will make the milk fats seperate and clump... When i add the sour cream i just beat it in and didnt return it to the heat after that.. Then it is perfectly creamy

This cheese sauce is EXCELLENT!!!!!  I do agree, cut the butter in half, but so simple and extremely tasty!  I don't know where the last two reviewers went wrong; I think probably cooked it too much.  Actually, you don't really 'cook' this; you just melt it together, stirring constantly over very low heat.  Once it is mostly melted, I take it off the heat and cover with a lid to finish melting.  I have made this and kept it warm with a chaffing dish.  Keeping very low heat is a must or you will ruin a great thing!

The way I made this sauce was great over nachos.  I first made the recipe as written.  I didn't like the chilis at all.  Plus I felt like all that butter was not necessary.  So the second time I cut it to 1/4 cup of butter, 3 cups of cheese and 3/4 cup of sour cream.  It was GREAT!  I added a tad bit of milk to give it a consistancy that we wanted.  The key is to put the butter on LOW, let it melt, add the cheese, on LOW and let it melt.  Then, on LOW, begin stirring the butter and melted cheese until it is mixed. This will occur, you just have to have some patience.  If you don't you will get a clumpy mess.  But that clumpy mess will smooth over time on LOW.  Did I mention you should do it on LOW??  ;-)

Well...it's hard for me to fairly rate this recipe. i had been looking forward to having a white cheese dip (similar to those in mexican restaurants). so this morning when i found the recipe, i bought all the ingredients. since it was just me and my fiance, we cut the recipe down by half. He first melted the butter (but only used 1/2 stick, claiming it looked  too 'fattening'). he then added in an 8 oz block of the cheese (cubed). now...perhaps i should have read the entire recipe for him, especially the last line stating "DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL." I could not agree more. what should have been a delicious, sauce-like dip became a stretchy lump of cheese in the bottom of the bowl topped by a layer of melted butter.  so please, take heed and DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL!  you might as well stick to cutting up cheese and placing it on a tortilla chip if you do. it would probably be a tasty dip, but do to error of the cook, it turned out as string cheese in a butter sauce.

Here in Charleston, On the Border, is simply the best Mexican restaurant.   They make a Chicken Burrito with a sour cream sauce that I have tried to duplicate for years....no longer, I found it here!   What a great sauce.  Put this over chicken burrito made with the Salsa Chicken Burrito Filling and you have a winner!

My husband loves Mexican food and one of his favorites is the white sauce.  Very good.  I tried this and had the same problem as another reviewer...too buttery.  So, I tried a second time....and it was better.   It still didn't taste like that authentic sauce they serve at restaurants, but it will work as a substitute.  Thanks for posting.

this is great, I use pepper jack cheese and half a can of rotell,  I wouldn't  use this for chips though, this is more like a white sauce for taquitos or enchiladas. Infact this is the SAME sauce that a local mexican place (#1 in my city) uses on green chili chicken enchiladas.  I have made it many times and people LOVE it!

Sooo good on chicken enchiladas.  Served at a wedding rehearsal dinner and got terrific compliments!  The white ones were gone first :)  Cook the sauce on simmer for a long time to get it nice and thick.

I first made this as a topping for enchiladas and it was great.  When I made it simply for a dip, it did not turn out right.  My father-in-law explained that I needed to make a roux first (I am a new wife and a beginner cook!).  After I did that it turned out right!  I would suggest making the roux then adding the cheese!  Loved the flavor though!

With some changes, this cheese sauce was great! For starters I only used 1/2 the amount of butter called for. I added 1/2 cup flour, wisking it together with the melted butter, then slowly added 1 cup milk (while cooking on LOW heat). Once that was smooth and creamy, I added the cheese, chilies and sour cream. I stirred it often and it is IMPORTANT to cook it slowly on LOW heat. It will take awhile to become a creamy consistancy. I almost gave up, it looked grainy and just not good, but I gave it a little more time and it was perfect!

So GOOD.  There's a Mexican restaurant that used to be in the Kansas City area that made sauce like this and I couldn't figure out how to make it until tonight.

I did, however, make a few changes based on the reviews.  I used 3/4 cup butter, 1 cup sour cream and about 14 slices of Monterey Pepper Jack PROCESSED cheese - not the real stuff.  I didn't use the chiles since I had the bite from the pepper jack cheese.  Creamiest cheese sauce I've ever had - and YES - cook it SLOWLY!!

If it was up to me this recipe would be taken off the screen. There is no way this could be any kind of cheese dip. It was to thick, the more I tried to melt the cheese the thicker it got. It might be good as a sauce but not a dip. In the end it was very lumpy. It was a waste of time and money. I poured it out.

Cut the recipe way down for our family.  Used a Jack/Cheddar cheese blend and a slice of  2% milk pepperjack instead of the green chilies.  Used light sour cream.  Very, very good and simple!

Great with my additions! I added an extra can of chili beans, 3 cloves of garlic, half a can of tomato paste, chopped cilantro, and the juice from one lime.

I used this as a cheese sauce over broccoli. I cut out the chilies, cut down on the butter and sour cream by about 20%. I added a little heavy cream  to thin it into a more sauce like consistency . Everyone loved it, the kids of course dipped everything in it!

This was very rich and would be good as a sauce for cheese or chicken enchiladas.  Not recommended as a dip.  If I make this again, I will definitely use less butter.  1/2-3/4 cup should be sufficient.

Made these late one night, had to use a colby-jack mix of cheese because we couldn't find any plain monteray jack cheese (can't argue when you're shopping at midnight). Still came out great. Only downfall was the chilis - didn't do much for it. Going to add diced jalepenos next time to give it more bite. Served over Chicken Chimis in the Oven from this site. Delicious!

I tired this with the montery jack cheese and didn't like how bitter it tasted.  So I then tried it with 3 cups of White American Cheese, 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 sour cream and a 1/2 chilis.  Followed the directions but found using a wire wisk help incorporate the butter into the melted cheese so it wouldn't just sit on top.  Turned out GREAT!!!!!  Tastes just like our local mexican resturants cheese sauce!

I have been making Mexican cheese dip/sauce for years, but decided to try this one. Like other reviewers, mine turned out grainy with a bad texture. It's nothing like the white cheese sauces and dips in Mexican Restaurants all across the South East. Will not make again.

THIS IS AN AWESOME SAUCE!  I served this to friends over Chicken Cordon Bleu and the reviews were wonderful.  I left out the chilies and added a little half and half cream.  The key is to keep it on a low fire and keep stirring!

This turned out surprisingly well!  I was looking for something close to On The Border sour cream sauce, and this wasn't quite that, but good nonetheless.  I used 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, about 2 cups cheese (it was a cheddar jack blend, couldn't find plain jack at my grocery store), 1 cup sour cream, and about 6 oz chilis.  At first, it didn't seem everything was going to melt, and I was afraid the consistency was going to be lumpy or stringy.  However, I just kept stirring and bumping up the heat (still keeping it under boiling), and it turned into a very creamy smooth consistency with time.  I poured it over chicken burritos.  Husband raved.  Yes, it is fatty, but you don't need any cheese or sour cream in your burritos when you use this, so it's the only bad part of an otherwise healthy meal.

Wasn't cheesy enough, tasted too much like sour cream for my taste. Could of been that I had to use cheddar and montery jack mix cheese because I couldn't find just MJ in our store. Will try to make again with different cheese.

My heart almost stopped at the thought of adding a whole cup of butter to cheese so, I used light margarine and light sour cream. It was awful and maybe, substituting low fat ingredients is what made it so bad. But, I just couldn't bring myself to add a whole cup of real butter to it. I also think that there is a special technique to melting a cheese so that it melts properly. Although, I'm not sure what that is I'll be researching it before I try anything like that again.

This was exactly what I was looking for also, I did use less butter as other people suggested and it was very good as an enchilada sauce and we also have used over nachos.
Thanks for sharing

This was good, but I used pepperjack cheese instead. Seemed to add some extra flavor. Was really good over chicken enchiladas. Also cut down on the butter a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

SUPURB! I took your advise Wilemon, since you submitted this excellent recipe, and used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the full 1 cup.  My family and dinner guest went crazy over this sauce.  Absolutely the BEST white cheese sauce I have ever eaten.  Maybe not authenticly Mexican, but we all agreed, we like it even better than the restaurants!!!!  I also use this sauce as a dip for Southwestern Eggrolls, sooooo wonderful!  Thanks Wilemon, so good, so easy!

Wow was this a SUPER disappointment!!! This turned out so gritty, and I never allowed it to come anywhere close to a boil! The taste of this was pretty good if you could get over the unappitizing texture of it. I had high hopes for this one...what a let down!

Things I love about this recipe: 1) It's incredibly simple 2) It uses a few basic ingredients and lets them do the work as far as flavor/texture is concerned rather than adding countless extra ingredients 3) It tastes authentic. I read the reviews for this and contemplated reducing the butter, but I wanted to trust the author and in my opinion, the 1 cup of butter is just the right amount to "coax" the cheese into melting slowly (yet doesn't create a buttery layer while cooking). I may have used a little less on the Jalapenos, but that's really just personal preference. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, cook it on a LOW setting (ex: simmer or just above). It will turn out better that way. And it helps to add the shredded cheese in small amounts (i.e. adding it slowly rather than all at once). I did the same thing with the sour cream. In the end, it came out perfect. I will warn people that this comes out tasting a little on the salty side, probably because of the butter. I would definitely go for an unsalted butter, if you're considering buying some before making this recipe. Very authentic, though. Tastes, as some have suggested, just like the stuff from Mexican restaurants. Maybe more appropriately called "queso". I used mine atop a plate of nachos with taco beef sprinkled all over. Healthy? Hell no. Delicious? Hell yes.

AWESOME!! I did modify it a bit by adding more of everything but butter (I wanted A LOT) and I put a few shakes of chipotle and I used jalepenos. I also added milk as needed. SO GOOD!!!

I just couldn't get this to work out, even with following others' tips to cut back on the butter to 1/4 cup, and only use low heat.  The flavor was good, the consistency wasn't (it quickly hardened and became grainy).

... so there's a small mexican restaurant where i live and i love to eat there just because of their white cheese dip. so when i tried this, i wasn't expecting anything like theirs. well, i have to admit that there were too many green pepper things in it, and next time i probably won't put any. but my mom and dad loved it - tastes great with just chips!

I used this recipe with the one from this site called "Easy White Chicken Enchiladas" and it was DA BOMB!  It was a lot easier to make than I thought it would be, and I'm so glad I tried it.  As long as you remember that you're pretty much just gently warming up/melting the stuff it will be fine.  I'm a bad one for tweaking recipes and rating them based on my changes (same thing I roll my eyes at other reviewers for doing, lol) but I actually followed this one exactly, other than reducing the butter amount to 3/4 c.) and it made enough sauce for a dozen enchiladas.  My pretty picky kids were begging to lick out the (still hot!) pot, lol!

I had high hopes for this sauce based on reviews.  I made it exactly as written and was disappointed that I wasted the money on ingredients.  There was too much butter, so much so that I couldn't completely incorporate it and it just sat on top like an oil slick.

Very Good!  I cooked this on low from start to finish and had no problems with graininess.  I hate to change recipes from the get go but ended up using Greek Yogurt in place of Sour Cream and Jalapeno Peppers (that's what I had on hand).  I don't even care for spicy hot dishes and enjoyed this!  Hubby licked the bowl clean.  Will make again.

EXCELLENT dip.  We are a cheese dip fanatic house and I was looking for something different.  This was it!!!  You must however cook on LOW...LOW...LOW.  I have done this before and had a whole clump of cheese stuff.  I used 2/3 cup of country crock butter and 1 block of Monterrey jack and colby cheese that I shredded by hand (which I think helps in the melting process better than pkg already shredded).  It did change the cheese color to a yellow instead of white.  I used 2/3 cup of sour cream.  I also used 1/2 cup of Salsa instead of chilies and 1 tablespoon of Fiesta Party Dip for some kick.   Family loved it as a dip.  Thanks for the great new staple in our house!!

Good. I made a few adjustments. I used mexican blend cheese instead of just monterey jack. I cut  the butter in half, used non-fat sour cream, and canned tomatoes/green chiles, as well as adding onion powder and paprika.

Well, I tried twice and both times this sauce turned out grainy.  The first time, I admit, was cooked on too high of heat, but the second time was cooked at low (below simmer on my cooktop) and it still turned out grainy, even after stirring for over an hour on low heat, removing from heat and returning.  Sorry, I've had better luck using white american cheese and will stick to that recipe.

This IS a tasty recipe! BUT... there is one thing I'd like to add... When I melted the cheese and butter together, then added the sour cream, it DID become kinda grainy! I read the reviews before making it, and saw that someone said to try a double boiler! Once I saw the grainy-ness, I quickly took it off the stove and put another pot of boiling water on, and sat my cheese pot on it (like a homemade double boiler) and it became creamy and smooth within the next couple minutes. Since my kids hate anything that is hot or spicy, I didn't add any kind of peppers in, but it WAS very tasty after getting it smooth!

I love this sauce. I rub some taco seasoning on chicken breasts and bake them. Put them on a bed of rice and cover with this cheese sauce. Wonderful! Thanks for sharing it!

Pretty much the closest sauce that I've made to the real thing you get at tex mex restaurants. The taste and smell is almost spot on, but the consistency isn't quite there. That being said, I LOVE this recipe. I'll be using it and experimenting some more with it to tailor it to my own tastes, but go with exactly what it says to get a great tasting white cheese sauce.

I really liked this cheese sauce, but my husband wasn't convinced. I also made it for guests He didn't like the texture and thought it should be creamier.

You can also use white american cheese in this recipe.  It turns out much creamier and does not separate if you have to bake it and is great with or without the peppers/salsa--kid friendly!  Works very well with chips, chimichangas, enchiladas or anything at all!   Do cut the butter in at least half.

This worked out perfectly for what I needed! I was concerned, because I didn't want to boil it but the cheese just wasn't melting into the butter well.

But, it did. And once I added the sour cream we were in business. I used colby/jack, as that's what I had on hand and I didn't want to spend out more money on food when I had something that would work on hand. I added pepper, that's a personal taste.

This went into my homemade chili perfectly and made a tasty chili mac. 
Cutting the recipe in half was just enough of a cheese sauce for my chili.

I'll make this again.

I was looking for something to use as a cheese dip with burritos.  This was great!  I had tried to buy the queso cheese in the store and melt it to make a cheese dip...needless to say it didn't work very well.  The cheese stayed melted, even after it cooled and reheating it after it had been in the fridge worked fine.  I didn't use the green chilies, though, instead I added about 1/4 cup of salsa and it was perfect for my family.  I'm sure you could add a little more salsa for a more spicy cheese dip.  This was a great recipe and will be one I will continue to use down the road.

Also had the same problem, very buttery. Poured more than half the butter out and it turned out well after that. Next time I would cut the butter down significantly and possibly add more cheese...I would also recommend whisking the ingredients together if they start to separate

I made this recipe to a "T". It was very thin and had a gritty texture to it (not the chiles), not smooth like a cheese sauce should be. The flavor itself was pretty good, but that's it. Will keep looking for a good recipe.

I should have read the reviews before making this. The dip was pretty good, but I think 1 cup of butter is too much.  It wasnt bad, but not quite what I hoped for. My husband liked it though.

This was a pretty good sauce, but does not keep in the refrigerator.  We put the sauce on top of enchiladas and stored the leftovers in the fridge; the leftovers were a bit gross with the cheese sauce.  Still not what I'm looking for, but very close and does taste pretty good.  By the way, you probably don't need as much butter as it calls for, because not all of it blended in with my cheese.  I'm reducing it to half if I make this again.

I made this today. I accidently just put everything into the melted butter instead of stirring it in, melting it and then adding the sour cream. I did reduce the butter to 1/2 cup and it was fine.  Even thought I put everything in  at the same time it worked out fine.  Instead of a dip I used it as a sauce for chicken enchiladas that I posted a photo of.  I pulled the meat off a rotissere chicken from wal-mart, heated it with spicy ranch beans and put in flour tortillas with cheese and then covered with cheese sauce.   This recipe will work good for a dip too.  I will make it again for a dip for chips.

There is WAY too much butter in this recipe.  If you are looking for a good enchilada sauce, this recipe is ok, but not a very good hot dip for cheese.  I had to add more sour cream to get rid of all the extra butter.  This recipe is just OK, I won't make it again:(

This recipe was just OK.  My husband didn't really care for it and neither of us ate very much of it.  It was pretty bland except for the green chilis which was the only flavor in the sauce.  It wasn't really creamy either, not what I was expecting.  I most likely will not be making this again.

This is my go-to white cheese sauce. Yes I  agree with other reviewers that less butter is needed.  I also have made it with a combination of Monterey jack  and queso quesadilla cheeses and it turned out great.  The secret is to keep the temperature just high enough to melt the cheese and not so high that everything starts to separate.  Also it is essential to use good quality cheese.  Fat free products don't work.

Do not become discouraged if your cheese is becoming a stringy/lumpy mess in the butter - like others are saying, I think it's because we're using real cheese (me too, shredded) At any point, add a couple of tablespoons of flour and WHISK --- then add your sour cream and WHISK well - to make up for the flour, add gradually a 1/4 c to 2 cups of milk to thin. On low heat it took about 30 minutes (start to finish) with frequent whisking for the cheese to melt smooth. Added a tsp or so of cayenne, a tsp of onion powder, & tsp or so salt. This is an awesome recipe, thank you Wilemon!

I like the look and feel of this recipe.  It reminds me of a cream salsa that a friend of mine use to make to go with carne asada.  A few, minor, modifications and it will be right on the money, but I'll keep those to myself.  Thanks for the recipe.

My friend and I made this to pour over chicken enchiladas. We followed the recipe exactly but the cheese congealed into a lump and the melted butter just sat on top. We managed to fix it by gradually pouring the butter out into a measuring cup and the cheese eventually melted properly, after which, we added the chilies. In the end we had poured out 3/4 cup of butter. Next time we'll be added butter by tablespoons.

I had to modify this recipe for calorie sake. I started out with a roux: 3 tablespoons of flour and 3 tablespoons of butter. I then added one and a half cups of chicken broth; 2 cups of shredded Monterey Jack cheese; 1 cup of sour cream and one can of green chilies.

I didn't scroll all the way down and realize this was supposed to be a dip. LOL! I used the entire cup of butter and used it as a pasta sauce. It is, so far, the best white cheese recipe I have found. I  looked it up again tonight because I was craving pasta again and needed to confirm the ingredients.

Has anyone tried using crema fresca instead of sour cream? The way my abuela always makes it she uses crema fresca. Since it is thinner in consistency than sour cream, I'm afraid to try it her way because I'm not sure how to adjust the amount of crema fresca.

I agree with the other reviews.  It was close but it had way too much better and the texture wasn't quite right.  Plus, it doesn't reheat well.  It just isn't the same as what you get in the restaurants.

This was very good.  The only change I will make it to add a little jalapeno instead of some many chili's next time!  Dint have quite enough of a kick for me.

It was really good. A little lacking in the spice department, I added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper to it and that helped a lot. It had to be kept warm to not get clumpy. But overall, we really liked it.

Used this recipe, minus the chilies and served it over shell noodles for my 2 year old - she loved it, and so did mommy and daddy! Great basic recipe, been looking for one of these that doesn't use velveeta.

I'm trying to think of what ingredient is missing here.  I thought that the fat content was much too high for a thin, smooth flow onto a plate of enchiladas or for a dip.  It was more like the consistency of room temperature butter.  It has a lot of potential, it just wasn't what I had expected.

I am so disappointed in this recipe.  It was WAY too much butter and the sauce had a grainy bad consistancy.  After deciding to store in fridge to taste again later, it was a more greasy solid mass.  I hated to waste all those expensive ingredients.  I will keep looking for a recipe to try.

Way too much butter. Sauce was greasy. Cheese finally does melt even though  you think it won't. If I made this again I would cut the butter down to 1/4 because 1/2 was still too much. Needs more spice too.

This was a easy recipe to make.  I will probably use alittle less butter and sour cream  and alittle more cheese next time.  Everyone loved this sauce.

this was pretty good!  Next time I will add both cans of chiles and not drain the juice. Some of my family does not like things as spicy as I do so I only put one. I did add some milk to make it a litte thinner.  My whole family loved it, though!  I also only added one stick of butter and kept stirring but don't stir too fast or the butter and cheese won't combine.  Thanks for sharing!

It was alright, but it just didn't taste the same. It tasted rather bland. The problem might have been that I used margarine instead of butter & I only used 1 can of chiles instead of 2, but they don't have the chiles in the dip at any restaurant that I've eaten at. I think it was close, but not exact.

I made this for our 4th of July party and was a little disappointed.  Did not turn out like I had imagined.  I did cut back on the butter as suggested but something was just not "right".  Thank you anyway.

This was good, but I added dashes of cayenne pepper to add some kick.  I think a compromise on the butter amount is needed.  Next time I'll try 2/3 a cup.  1/2 wasn't enough, and I think a whole cup would just be too greasy.  Good recipe, and worth some tinkering to get the best results.

Soooo good over chicken enchiladas!  Yes, a little buttery, so will take the suggestion to cut down on the butter next time.  This is the ONLY sauce I will use on my chicken enchiladas from now on!   Took this to a potluck and it was devoured.  So many wanted the recipe and couldn’t believe it was so simple.  Thanks Wilemon!

This sauce was pretty good served over tortilla chips. I used 1/2 cup of butter like other users suggested and added cooked shredded chicken to the mixture. Nothing spectacular, but pretty tasty.

I fixed it then put it in the tiny crock to keep it hot, must have been too hot, as it was awful, and burned to the sides.  Before it went in there, I tried it and it was very bland and grainy.  It did not change much in the crock.
