Easy and delicious glaze for ham. I added a bit more mustard as it was too thick and somewhat grainy as you can see in the photo. It cooked down to a nice syrup though and this is definitely a keeper as this used only 2 ingredients and I always have these on hand! Thanks for sharing.

Simple and lovely.  Don't shy away from this one eve though it's not at all complicated.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Not bad for when you need to whip up a fast glaze. I used Dijon mustard, because I thought regular mustard would be too tart and kill all the sweetness from the brown sugar, I was right not to use it. Not something to write home about but it does the job when your in a bind. Could use some tweaking.

This was an easy to prepare glaze for ham, and I did make a variation (as well as using Dijon mustard as other reviewers have suggested). I used a small ham and a larger baking dish, and after glazing, some of the glaze slid to the bottom of the dish and stood a good chance of burning. My Mom suggested adding some orange juice to the baking dish, which I did (enough to cover the bottom) and not only did it prevent burning but it made a delicious sauce for the ham! Next time, the oj is part of the recipe for me.

Tonight was my first time making ham and I was looking for a simple mustardy glaze -- I decided to take a chance on this one! It's exactly the right blend of salty and sweet, everyone at our dinner party LOVED it! I only made one adjustment, which was to add about 2 teaspoons of maple syrup, just because the original recipe wasn't quite liquidy enough to glaze the ham. Will definitely make this one again!!! :)

I used 2 Tbs Dijon mustard, and 1 Tbs regular.  Also added a dash of each ground cloves and nutmeg, and a generous dash of cinnamon.  It was very good!

This was easy and delicious.  I added some pineapple juice, which made it very sweet, but I simply added more mustard to even out the flavor.  A definite do-over.

I used regular yellow mustard and followed the recipe to a T. I did not thin the mixture with more mustard and used it like a wet rub. Once the brown sugar melts, it becomes syrupy and there is plenty of liquid so I don't feel that more mustard needs to be added. Great sweet and sour flavor for a ham.

We really liked this. Might try a different mustard next time (the regular mustard had quite a bite to it) but was still yummy and very quick to prepare!

I used an 8 lb Frick's bone-in ham shank portion for this recipe. I added salt & pepper to taste, a little more mustard (spicy dijon deli style), a few dashes of liquid smoke, and a few tsps ground cloves. I wanted just a little sweet yet more smokey tasting ham. I used a basting brush & basted this mixture on my ham. Wrapped it in heavy duty foil. Placed in disposable roasting pan. Some juice did leak out of the foil. But the finishing product tasted succulent. Very moist & flavorful. A great balance of sweet & smokey. Made a beautiful Veteran's Day meal for my Grandpa. He said it was one of the tastiest hams he has ever had. Thank you for this easy, versatile glaze!

Very easy and really good. I used this for Christmas and I will use it again.  I doubled it for a 6 pound ham and was glad that I did.  I also think it would make a really good dipping sauce for ham or chicken if it was watered down.

My husbands grandmother always served this on the side with ham growing up. Now our own boys won't eat ham without this. This is the first time I've ever seen it written out in a recipe. Try it, you'll be glad!

This was great on our Christmas Day Ham. It definitely made me like pork more. With the brown sugar, I combined a tablespoon of spicy brown mustard and a tablespoon of Dijon (with white wine). It was quick too.

I made a tweak that I picked up from another review:  Use Dijon mustard and add the juice of a fresh orange.  It was divine!!  I am going to make a second batch for the leftover ham!

Easy and Love it!!!!!  Used Dijon mustard and added 2tsp of pure maple syrup (as another recommended).  I had a precooked ham that I warmed for 3 hours with this glaze.  It made the ham AWESOME!!!!!  Thanks for this easy glaze. It’s a keeper.

Only 4 stars due to alterations. Great recipe for "freshening up" leftover spiral ham. I halved the recipe for just us and add one fresh orange squeezed. I changed the mustard to Dijon. Poured the heated glaze over the slices before microwaving. They were phenomenal!

This one worked out well BUT it was a little too dry so I added some pineapple juice and even though I did it still had a nice taste of mustard. I also stuck pineapple chunks on it with toothpicks, and it turned out great the whole family loved it. Great simple glaze recipe.
-Add pineapple juice to desired consistency
-Use pineapple chunks if desired to add to flavor

It's simple and added a nice flavor to my ham. Like so many other people, I had to add more mustard than the recipe called for

Very easy to make and my entire family enjoyed it.  I smeared this glaze on top of a small ham and baked it in the oven for 40 minutes before broiling it  uncovered for an additional 5 minutes.  Everyone went back for seconds.

This is so tasty with the saltiness of the ham. I made one small change and added about a tablespoon of cider vinegar to the recipe, it helped smooth it out and added a nice tanginess to the glaze.

I normally do not like sweet glazes but this was absolutely amazing. I used Dijon mustard as the recipe did not state what kind of mustard to use.  I made a gravy/ sauce for the ham and mashed potatoes.  Wonderful!!
