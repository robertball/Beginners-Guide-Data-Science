I love fish tacos, so I tried this recipe. I followed the instructions, but I also made sure to remove the heat as the others have suggested. I could have added more of the chipotle spice than I did. I just wanted to make sure I did not go overboard. This is a great recipe, and I am from Texas and we love our spicy dishes. I now live out of state and long for spicy food that reminds me of home. This is a great recipe and all of the flavors marry well together. I will try this recipe again and I may even add a little more heat next time.

Excellent, excellent dish.  It is a fair amount of work to put all the pieces together, but very worth it in the end.  I used a spanish rice recipe on the site.  This would make a nice dish to serve company.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a fantastic version of fish tacos and worth the effort. Some of the other reviews said it was too spicy or too salty, but I think it is possible too much of the rub was used. You will make more seasoning rub than needed so just lightly coat the fish and either save or toss the rest. We also used a poblano pepper instead of jalapeno because that is what we had in the house so that may have reduced the spice a little. It was spicy, but if you like a little spicy, you will enjoy.

We also used only 1 can of black beans and I didn't put the rice on my tacos although my husband did and we both loved how we made them. We also used smaller corn tortillas and each had 3 tacos with about 1/2 of the fish leftover for another night. 

Based on another review, we used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream which was delicious. I used light versions of both to keep the calories down. The combination of all the flavors blended so well. Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.

I liked the hottness of it a lot, but the only problem I had with the seasoning is that it was way to salty.  I would half the salt.  The mango filling was delicious though and I would definately make it again.

My husband and I love spicy/hot dishes and we both thoroughly enjoyed this one.   It was delicious!  The only change I made was that I baked the fish at 350 for 15 minutes.  It turned out perfect!   We decided we need to have this at least once a month!!

Wow, that was too hot. I even decreased the rub to 2T. It tasted good, but when your whole dinner group can't eat if from the heat, that's a bummer.

I dropped the rice too--add more mango to the salsa if the fish is too spicy. Helps cool the mouth!

these tacos were fantastic, spicy but oh so good.  i did change the mayo to 1/2 light sour cream and 1/2 light mayo.  i didn't have any spanish rice and i don't think it needed it, the black beans were good enough!

This is delicious!  My husband is doing low-carb so I substituted tomato for mango in the salsa and made his into a salad with the cole slaw on bottom, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again.  Winner!

I really loved this recipe! It was a huge hit with my friends. The only complaint was that the garlic was too much throughout. 

I also added avacados to the tacos, and that was a nice pairing to the mangoes and another good way to reduce the heat.

I make fish tacos and my own salsa (mango and other) all the time. So that part was no surprise. However, the chipotle puree was genius! I used part fat free sour cream and part fat free mayo and it was delicious!

This recipe was FABULOUS! My family loves spice so we didn't have an issue with the level of hotness; however, I wasn't able to find chipotle chile powder so I substituted hot chili powder. That was my one substitution. I will try light mayo next time as I will probably double the sauce, which was delicious! Only downside to this recipes is that it takes some time to put together, but don't let that stop you. The effort is well worth it.

This is a good recipe my family loves hot recipes but chipotle could be very much compared to habanero spicyness. I added less chipotle to be able to enjoy all of the other wonderfull ingredients and I also added avocados to the salsa.

the rub is very good!   for the salsa, would go with 2 mangos and go less on the onions -  major onion breath using a the full small onion.

Very good recipe..I did use peach salsa and mixed it with the black beans and goya tomate sauce..simmered it slowly for a fairly long time to thicken...easier to serve and tasted great.  I also used sour cream AND mayo in the chipotle sauce to cut the heat.  Fun meal to serve my family on a snowy night!

This was really good.I only used 1 cup of spanish rice instead of 3. Instead of 2 cans of black beans I only used 1. Instead of mayo I used sourcream. After making all the dfferent stuff I combined it all together. It served 6 people & still had leftovers.

Time consuming but so worth it. The only changes i made was olive oil instead of canola. My girlfriend loves spicy stuff, as do I for the most part. I ate two of these burritos and was stuffed, as well as we have enough for two more burritos. I tried to make enough for 2 servings although I think I used more fish than called for as I had about 5 small filets. I cheated a little bit and added some sour cream, but i think the mango salsa makes this dish really shine. I would maybe make it again, but then again there are simpler recipes that would provide about the same punch in terms of heat but not in flavor.

Way too much chipotle for fish, even after scraping the rub off it was too hot. We eat hot peppers very frequently so it was not a matter of not being used to spicy food.

This was great! The mango salsa, and chipotle aoli was perfect.  I used what fish was on sale, and didn't add the coleslaw mix.  The tortilla's were full enough. Per another reviewer I used as much rub as needed, had some extra, therefore it wasn't to salty. Will make this again!!

Used this as an inspiration for my Fish Taco Salad.  We love spicy food but as written this fish was way to hot for us.  Subbed ancho powder and decreased the amount and it was awesome.  Lined plates with romaine, then with shredded cabbage and mango salsa and topped with fish.  Modified the "Chipotle Mayo Relish" recipe into a dressing and found a healthier way to love fish tacos.

I loved this. However, I used 1tablespoon of chipotle powder and it was plenty hot. The next time (and there will be several of them!) I will probably cut back the chipotle and the salt. I am not sure if it was the brand of black beans or the recipe. They weren't memorable alone but added to the taco. They worked but aren't necessary to this recipe. I also added avocado and shredded cabbage and did not use the rice.

This is the first time I've made fish tacos, and they were delicious!  As other reviewers recommended, I decreased the amount of Chipotle Chile Powder (used 1 tbsp).  It was still very spicy - which I love - but not so bad that you couldn't eat it.  I also added avocado to the salsa and served the rice and beans on the side.  The aioli came out great too.  I can't wait to make this again!

These were good but WAY TOO HOT!! Next time, I am going to decrease the amount of chilis in the fish crust by about 2/3 and replace the rest with bread crumbs. Also, 1 of the canned chilis per 1/2 cup of mayo.. otherwise the heat overpowers the flavors of the fish and the salsa.

Good end result, but his recipe calls for a lot of steps and lots of dirty pots. I used left over fish from a previous dinner to save an extra step. I thought the black beans were a bit dry - next time I might mix the mayo mixture into the black beans and even add some cumin. I felt there were so many layers in this dish - it was too hard to close the tortillas. I left out the rice and used thinly sliced purple cabbage instead of coleslaw mix (that's what I had).

So fresh and amazing! I added orange bell pepper to the mango salsa and it punched it up a little. :)

Ran out of runway with hungry wolves waiting so omitted the rice.  Also, I used about half the fish called for because that's all I had.....so the fish was super flavorful but we are from Texas and really like spicy stuff.  To all others, make sure you proportion the spices to cover the fish with the right amount of fish.  I also substituted light sour cream for the may (don't keep mayo in my house) and everyone loved it.  Just noticed the hubby going back for seconds, all the while sniffing because of the level of spices on the fish.  My daughter's quote " it's a keeper, Mom".

I made this to a T.  First, this called for way too much spice. In my neck of the woods Chipotle powder is $7.00 a bottle. I had half of the mix left over after covering the fish.  The sauce should be doubled as there was not enough, and I had to make more. Finally, drained and rinsed black beans do not simmer without liquid they burn.  While this recipe has great potential, it requires an experienced cook who will know how to prevent the potential pitfalls due to the poor instructions. The recipe was good, but I have enjoyed better fish Tacos.
