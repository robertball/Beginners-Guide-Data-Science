I substituted toasted, slivered almonds for the hazelnuts and brandy for the
liquer and omitted the chocolate chips. I have had hearty complements from 
everyone that has tried these. These really are fantastic!

Making biscotti for the first time, I found this recipe very easy and good. However, I changed the directions a bit. I creamed the butter with the sugar, added eggs and brandy. I added the dry ingredients and then the nuts and the chocolate chips. I used filbert nut instead of hazelnuts. It was delicious. I would do this recipe again =)

This is a great flavor variation on traditional biscotti. If you ground the hazelnuts the cookies come out almost crumbly and less like a crunchy, hard biscotti. A must try for non-dunkers like myself, and ADD THE CHOCOLATE!

Yummy!  I omitted chocolate chips, but after kneading, I patted the dough out to a rectangle and put Nutella chocolate hazelnut spread on it.  I had wanted to roll the dough like a jelly roll, but it's too sticky for that. Ended up folding the edges over and shaping into log.
Very tasty!

Hazelnet (AKA as filberts, same nut) is my favorite flavor of Biscotti. But getting my hands on hazelnuts can be very hard in my area.  I've been known to substitute brazil nuts (chopped) which are kind of bland and used hazelnut coffee syrup (available in specialty coffee shops) to get a very passable hazelnut flavor.  The slight additional moisture makes them easy to cut when out of the oven about 10 min.  Less crumbling. BUT, if I can get the hazelnuts, I use them.

A very nice recipe!  I omitted the chocolate and as liquer I used 2
tablespoons of Frangelico liquer. the dough was fairly sticky so had to use quite a bit of flour to shape the loaf. better use a light hand while rolling.
End result was fabulous. can't stop munching :)
and the aroma of the hazelnuts is great (dry roasted the nuts in a pan and chopped coarsly with a knife)

Great! Left out chocolate chips because I wanted a strong hazelnut flavour. I also added 2 tbsp more liqueur.

Yes. Took double the roasting time. Used cinnamon chips and brandy but no nuts. Pretty good

Fabulous biscotti!  Love the strong hazelnut flavor and the hint of cinnamon.  It was well worth buying a bottle of Frangelico for this recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly except for high altitude changes.  I live at 6100' so I reduced the sugar by 2 tablespoons and reduced the baking powder by 1/2 teaspoon.
