These crepes are good. They get pretty crispy. Itâ€™s the sauce that is so wonderful. Definitely double the sauce. It only made enough to lightly drizzle over the amount of crepes and this chocoholic needed more than a thin lime of this rich nectar. I also added strawberries because I thought it needed more fruit. Nice recipe, thanks.
