Really great recipe Peter! My parents are German, so I grew up on this stuff, but didn't like it when I was a kid. I didn't have any apple juice, so I just added a bit of brown sugar. To make this a more complete meal, I removed the chops after browning and fryed up some bacon pieces. I then added my onions and garlic and then the kraut and caraway seeds, along with a good bottle of beer and some chicken broth. While that was simmering, I placed my chops in a casserole dish and topped them with thinly sliced potatoes. The kraut then went on top of the potatoes, I covered with foil and placed it in the oven for about and hour and a half. The "broth" in this dish was so flavorful and the meat was extremely tender. Hubby was thrilled. Thanks so much!!!!

I have been making a recipe that is very close to this for years.  However instead of apple juice, I use 3/4 CUP OF APPLE SAUCE and a few tablespoons of BROWN SUGAR!  It really gives it nice flavor and my pork chops have always come out moist.  Enjoy!

I too have been making a version of this for years - from mom's recipe.  She always included a peeled, cored and diced red delicious apple.  It's purpose is to reduce the acidity of the sauerkraut - it's supposed to turn to mush and be not noticeable when done.  Her version uses pork ribs, which I've started browning first to make the color of the finished dish a lovely brown.  I've also started using the caraway seeds for a subtle flavor improvement.  I use the fresher 'bagged' sauerkraut found in the refrigerated food section instead of the variety in the jar, and include the juice with the sauerkraut.  The apple really works!  We serve it over mashed potatoes.  It's one of our favorite comfort foods!

It's very good! I didn't drain the liquid from the sauerkraut, plus I added more apple juice (1/4C). In a skillet I  browned the pork chops on both sides and sauted the kraut too, and then for a really tender, juicy meat I baked mine at 350' (covered) for an hour.  I have also tried this recipe with 1/4 cup of beer(instead of apple juice) and a 1/2 small apple, peeled, cored and sliced ,it's really good  this way as well. THX.

Grandma made pork and sauerkraut every New Year. She'd have loved this recipe. When I served it New Year's Day, my husband said, "You sure don't have to wait a year to make this again." It was great. Note: If you use kraut with little or no juice -- you may want to add a little water or increase the apple juice.

The chops were very tender and tasty however, I would suggest using applesauce instead of the sliced apples, they went to mush.  Use quartered apples adding them later in the cooking process.  This recipe benefits from the apple flavour and the appearance of the apples.

Very good. Not too difficult. Changed the order of cooking. Cooked bacon in pan first. Remove to paper towel. Brown chops in bacon fat. Place in a 9x13. Saute onion and garlic a few minutes until soft. Add applesauce, brown sugar, and sauerkraut to pan, bring to boil. Scrape up all the brown bits. Crumble bacon on top of chops and pour rest of ingredients on top, cover with foil, and bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 40 minutes.

Delicious! I wasn't going to add the caraway seed but I'm glad I did because that really makes the dish. After sauteeing everything, I covered and cooked in the oven. Put sliced potatoes on the bottom, pork chops in the middle and then sauerkraut on top.I added a bit of chicken broth to the mix as well. Absolutely awesome recipe, PETEITC. Thank you!

This was my first time trying sauerkraut, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I actually used applesauce instead of juice, and I put it all in my slow-cooker for about 5 hours on high. It came out deliciously tender and moist, and my husband and I both want to have it again!

My family and I liked this a lot - quick, easy and tasty!  I didn't have apple juice so used 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I also added about 1/2 cup water half way through cooking to be sure the kraut didn't burn. Like one of the other reviewers, I am from a German background and this is just like what we used to have at home.  Served with some mashed potatoes, YUMMY!!!

I loved this recipie.  I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder, onion powder,caraway, pepper and a generous amount of paprika. For the suakraut. I used bottled sauekraut, but first drained and rinsed it well and then put in a pot with just enough water to cover.  I added pieces of fried bacon (about 4 slices), caraway and pepper and simmered it for a while, then I thinkened it up with a cornstarch slurry and then topped the pork chops.  This is the BEST way to have sauerkraut!!!! I browned the meat first then baked for 40 minutes at 350. A great meal.

I didn't change anything but I would recommend draining the sauerkraut before adding to the skillet. The apple juice gives it plenty of moisture to keep it from burning. I did brown the pork chops first as some of the other reviewers suggested. I didn't think there was enough sauerkraut and next time I'll make with 32 ounces. This is an excellent way to satisfy your craving for sauerkraut!

a delicious dish my husband of geman descent has to have on new years day and throughout the year as well.  i have made this with pork chops and pork loin, but my favorite is with spareribs.  i use applesauce instead of apple juice.  i brown the meaty side of cut up ribs in a heavy dutch oven and remove, then saute the onions, then garlc, then add the rest including the sauerkraut juice.  i place the ribs back in the dutch oven, cover with the sauerkraut mix, and bake for two hours at 350. the applesauce cuts the tartness of the sauerkraut and mixes so well with the sparerib juices. i serve with mashed potatoes. this is real comfort food.

I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 2 T brown sugar instead of apple juice (this was suggested in the reviews).    ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  And soooo easy.  The sweetness takes away the salty flavor of the sauerkraut and it's a perfect accompaniment to pork.

This was easy and delicious! I've picked up Bavarian style sauerkraut by mistake and didn't really like the overly sweet flavor. This recipe had some of the same elements but with a much more subtle flavor because it's homemade. I did take the advice of others and used apple sauce (about 1/2 Cup) instead of apple juice, I just didn't think 2 tablespoons of apple flavor was enough. This one is a keeper.

Made a few adjustments -- used boneless (1 to 1 1/2 inch thick) country ribs; used packaged barrel cured sauerkraut (drained); added 1/2 to 3/4 cup chicken broth; used about 4T brown sugar instead of apple or apple juice. After browning meat, removed from pan and sauteed onions and sauerkraut; added broth and stirred to get all the "good stuff" from bottom of pan; added rest of ingredients and simmered on LOW for 1 1/2 hour (or until pork very tender). Added potatoes and continued cooking until potatoes were tender. WOW! Had for dinner, lunch and dinner the next day! Might be great in a slow cooker also!

We liked this.  I seasoned the chops with s&p and then coated with mustard before I browned.  Also added some beer to it for extra moisture and flavor.  Very juicy and yummy.

almost a dead ringer for Mom's recipe...except, she added a half a bottle of beer,apples from Grandpa's orchard (whatever we had in the fruit cellar),chopped onion, and served it with homemade mashed potatoes..for some reason I remember the pressure cooker being used....(maybe that was on days she was late starting supper..!)anyway....an excellent meal and brought back wonderful dinnertime memories and smells. Like a trip into the past.....thanks

My hubby (born in Germany) absolutely loved this dish.  Followed another reviewer's advice by adding sliced potatoes on top of the chops.  Covered with the sauerkraut.  Only problem I had was that the cooking time was almost 2 hrs. (the sliced potatoes refused to cook!)  Would definitely recommend this recipe!

Hearty, Delicious & Easy. I loved this and I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut. I added some apple slices as others have suggested & also added some sour cream just before serving. This is a great dish and so easy to make in just one pan.

I used some of the other suggestions, no juice 1/2 cup applesauce instead.  I also browned the chops, removed them to a baking dish and combined the rest in the pan to incorporate.  Then baked for an hour @ 350.  I also used about 24 ounces of kraut instead of the lesser. It was very good!

This was an excellent recipe. I did add 1 tsp of celery seed to the mix which really beefed up the flavor.  I also cooked in crockpot after browning pork and sauteing onions and seasonings in skillet. Easy and delicious. Thanks so much for sharing.

I too used apple sauce and brown sugar. Fabulous! And since spices are so expensive, I used the Bavarian style sauerkraut with caraway seeds already in it. It made a difference and cost much less. I baked it with the mixture on top for 40 min @ 350. The next time, I will put it all in my crock-pot. The chops will be fork-tender that way. We loved it and I will make it again.

First off. I hate sauerkraut and only made it because the wife loves the stuff but I must admit this is darn good even to me. I used Silver Floss Bavarian Style that already is well flavored with caraway seeds and a half cup of applesauce rather than just juice.
I'll make this again.

Great recipe!  Turned out fabulous.  My husband doesn't like the taste of vinegar so the apple juice really did the trick to make this a nice flavor.  I did put small chunks of a Granny Smith apple into the mixture.  Easy and fabulous.

Flavorful but next time I'll put them in a slow cooker so they'll be tender.  A little tough, even with the juice of the sauerkraut.

An absolutely fantastic recipe for pork chops! My husband nor I are not normally big fans of pork chops...However, I decided (sceptical though) to try try this recipe for some diversity.  We thoughorly enjoyed it.  I added a little more garlic and 1 1/2 onions (instead of just 1), about 1/4 c. apple juice.  In addition, I added 1/2 tsp. ground red pepper(for extra flavor).  I will definitely make this dish again.

This is a nice recipe - but it just didn't come out the way we hoped.  The sauerkraut was very nicely flavored - but this recipe doesn't make for very moist pork chops.  If I adjusted it and added much more liquid and converted it to a slow-cooker recipe - then perhaps I'd make it again...but this stovetop version would be much better suited to sliced kelbeisa sausage instead of the chops.

Excellent easy dish.  Good basic recipe.  I used pork cutlets and cranberry juice in place of the apple juice.

Just had this last night, it is excellent.  I did follow the reviewer Linda Mclean who made some suggestions of things to add or use.  Added onions, bacon and potatoes--Didn't have apple juice so I used 2 TBS of brown sugar and added a sprinkle of cinnamon. I used canned sauerkraut and about 1/2 bottle of beer--this was a HUGE HIT. Will add this to my recipe box! VERY flavorful!

Very good recipe, thank you for sharing!  I had a couple of cooking apples so I sliced those thinly and put them in along with about 1/4 cup applesauce left in a jar instead of the apple juice.  Since I had about 8 thin boneless pork chops,  I used two large jars of sauerkraut and there was plenty of juice.  The apples I used were *very* tart and so I added a little more brown sugar. I browned the pork chops but baked the dish instead of finishing on stove top.  I baked it at 350 for an hour as I had effectively doubled the recipe.  It was delicious!  The baking mellowed and pulled all the flavors together.  I served it with boiled potatoes and creamed corn (as that was what I had on hand).  Next time, I think I will try finishing it off in the crockpot.  Great recipe though.  Everyone loved it.

This was very good.  I caramelized the onions after browning the chops, then added the rest of the ingredients.  I didn't have apple juice, so I used 2 tbsps of brown sugar and added about 1/4 cup of raisins and 1/2cup of chicken broth (my kraut was too dry)  It was wonderful.  I served it with mashed potatoes and some cranberry sauce.  Will make this again.

Awesome recipe!  I followed the directions with the one exception that I added approximately three tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce and an extra tablespoon or two of apple juice.  I did not add brown sugar as some other reviewers have recommended as I think the apple juice adds sweetness.  I used one 15 ounce can of sauerkraut and just drained it before throwing it onto the skillet to be sauteed.  This has a very Germanic flavor and is such a perfect recipe for pork chops.  I recommend using mashed potatoes as a side dish.

I took Linda's Advise and followed her direction. Pork became tender and it was delicious! One thing I changed was that I added 2 tbs of apple compote, since I didn't have apple juice nor an apple. The kraut was still tart to my taste so I added another tbs of brown sugar.   Thanks Linda for your great advise.

This went over better than I hoped. Hubby wasn't too happy about the sauerkraut, but I thought the flavor was great, AND my 14 month old ate it! I did cook this in the slow cooker. I put it in for about 6 hours on low, then when the chops started to fall apart I switched it over to warm. This is great served with spaetzle. I'll make this again, just not for hubby. Is it bad that my 30 year old husband is a pickier eater than my 14 month old? LOL

Just LOVED this recipe! What a great spin on plain old porkchops.  As others, I did not have any apple juice handy, so I substituded applesauce, otherwise, I followed the recipe to the T.  Make a side order of potatoes to go with, and you have a complete meal in 30 minutes. DELISH!

Loved this one and I don't like sauerkraut; my husband loves it and he thought this was great. Used applesauce since we didn;t have any apples and I threw it all in the crockpot on low for about 10 hours.

This is a great recipe, but next time I am thinking of putting the browned chops and sauerkraut mixture into the oven at a low temperature for a long time. I'm hoping for more tender chops this way.

Unlike some reviewers, I truly appreciate reading reviews where lots of changes have been made -- it gets the creative juices flowing.  Plus,it's a rare recipe that doesn't have two or more ingredients that my food sensitivities do not allow.


     So I tweak based on those sensitivities, on what I picked up at the CSA in a given week, and on what suggestions other reviewers have provided.


     So... after browning the chops (usually in bacon grease or olive oil), I remove them and throw in onions  After they caramelize, I throw in as much or as little garlic a I want, followed shortly by caraway seeds.  Then I add root vegetables -- the first time parsnips, and this time a carrot and a watermelon radish -- and add low-sodium organic chicken broth.  The chops go in next, and then I dollop apple sauce and sauerkraut on top of that.  Cover and simmer until the veggies are tender enough and the pork has reached recommended internal temp.


     The flavors together are unbelievable, and it's an easy, quick, and nutritious one-pot meal.


     Thanks to PETEIYC and all the helpful reviewers.

I took the advice of others and used applesauce instead of apple juice. The pork came tender and the kraut was so good, the best pork chops and kraut recipe I've made to date. This dish will definitely be in our regular meal rotation!

I made this for 1.  Didn't have any o.j., so I used manderine juice.  I couldn't find my caraway seeds, so I had to leave them out. Even without them, it was excellent!!  Can't wait for the next pork chop. (I found my seeds). This is a keeper, and is easy to make.  I used canned and drained sauerkraut.

This recipe had really good flavor.  I took another reviewers tip and used apple sauce and a little brown sugar instead of apple juice.  The pork chops were good, but came out a little tough even though they were still a little pink in the middle.  I think this recipe would work better with a thinner chop.  Obviously the cooking time for the pork would have to be shorter too.

Great Recipe. I've made this twice already. And made the sauerkraut by itself with smoked sausage and bacon once.

We loved this recipe! My 1 year old just lapped up the sauerkraut and my neighbor was begging for the recipe. After years of experimenting with pork & sauerkraut recipes and finding all of them too bitter, this is my "new classic."  Thanks!

This was really easy, and especially delicious with fresh, homemade sauerkraut. I also substituted apple sauce for the apple juice, and it worked fine.

Like many others, I tweaked this recipe and it was delicious!  I don't care for onion pieces so I subbed 1-1/2 tsp. onion powder, doubled the miced garlic (from a jar) and apple juice and also added 1/2 can of beer.  I used 32 oz. of bagged sauerkraut (drained) instead of the 16 oz. called for in the recipe and put the salt & pepper on the chops while browning.  My husband, and his friend who dined with us, raved about this recipe...it's a keeper!

Great flavor.  A little dry though, I didn't add the liquid from the kraut. I think I will next time or add a little water.  The amount of apple juice was just right and added just a touch of sweetness.
  I will definitely make this again.

I had to cut way back on the amount onions to make the recipe any good.  It's a great idea but it needs a little personal touch when you make it.  To follow the recipe as is, is a risk you take if your susceptible to indigestion.

I added half a cup of applejuice to the recipe and substituted corriander for caraway seeds.  The meat was tender and tasted great!  I enjoyed the saurkraut, so did my husband, but we couldn't eat too much of it.  A small pinch of the kraut with every bite of chop was just as well.  

The saurkraut tasted mild and sweet.  This is a good recipe that I'm going to make again, but next time I'll make some minor adjustments and TRY to have caraway seeds on hand.  I'd have given this recipe a rating of three and a half stars if I could, but it wasn't quite deserving of four.

Awesome!!! My 2nd time making pork chops … and very successful - my husband, my cousin,and I loved it. I didn’t have neither apple juice nor apple sauce, so I grinded 2 fresh apples and I cut-up 2 apples. I’ll definitely do it again – rather fast and very tasty!!! Thank you!

I thought this was quite good.  I did what other reviews suggested and chopped an apple and added it to the saurkraut.  Now 2 TBSP ??  applejuice, well I added probably half a cup I did not measure.  I think it would burn otherwise.

I added a cut-up apple and a few juniper berries to the sauerkraut and onion, and instead of apple juice, I used some German Riesling. Country-style boneless pork ribs were phenomenal, browned nicely and stayed juicy and tender. Yummmmmm!

Delicious.  I sliced a Granny Smith apple into the sauerkraut mixture and instead of apple juice, I used a few tablespoons of frozen apple juice concentrate.  I keep frozen orange juice and apple juice concentrate in my freezer and often substitute them when a recipe calls for orange or apple juice.

Delicious recipe, Peter!  I used cubed apple instead of apple juice.  Also, layered the browned pork chops, thinly sliced red potatoes & sauteed sauerkraut in a casserole dish & baked at 350 for 90 minutes.  Juicy & delicious...the family loved it!

This is a simple, but good recipe. It seems I never learn; once again, I overcooked the pork, cooking it too long in the pan. If your chops are thin, they are so easy to overcook. Just be careful. Learn from my mistake. I've been cooking too long to keep making this fundamental error. I'll do better next time. Oh, one more thing: if you decide to use Bavarian Sauerkraut, which is already sweet, you may want to avoid using the apple juice, since that makes it doubly sweet.

Very delicious and easy to make.  Even my husband who isn't a big fan of sauerkraut liked it.  I followed the instructions with these changes:  I used a 24 oz. jar of sauerkraut and two 1 1/2" chops, to serve 2 people.  We have enough pork leftover for lunch the next day and a small amount of sauerkraut.  If serving 4 I would double the sauerkraut.

Ok, I just made this and it's awesome. I probably shouldn't review it until I try it with the caraway seed (I didn't have any) But I'm sure it will only enhance a great combo of flavors. My only problem will be trying not to eat the whole thing. Soo good! And soooo easy.

I have this thing where I HAVE to try a new recipe every weekend, because I get bored with food.  THIS was it for us this weekend.  I used pork sirloin chops that were REALLY thick and I spiced them up & browned them like others....sauteed some onions and mixed that with drained sauerkraut.  Threw a chopped up apple on top and a dash or so of apple juice.  Made Mashed potatoes on the side and YUMMMM!!!!!  My 13 year old who loves everything insisted he was going to hate this.....but he loved it!  The pork just fell apart so I helped it a bit and mixed it all together.  The polock in me is LOVING IT!  : )

Tasted very good. I left the juice in my kraut when added to the pan. I also peeled, cored and diced an apple for texture, and just poured in apple juice. I also put Montreal Steak Spice on my chops when browning. Very good. Kinda spicy (from Steak Spice), kinda tangy and kinda sweet!

This recipe was so yummy and reminded me of my childhood!  My husband and son couldn't get enough! I added a bit more apple juice to give more liquid but other than that it was great!!

Love this recipe! I used apple juice concentrate from a can and omitted the caraway seeds just because we don't like them. I also used fresh sauerkraut from a local german deli...YUM. 

The only thing I would change would be the cooking time. I think 20 mins. for the porkchops was a bit too long. They were kind of tough. Maybe 10 to 15 mins. would be better.

Husband liked this more than I did - I'm not a big fan of caraway seeds. This was good but I should have used less onion.

Not the best I've had.  I did not like how the Sauerkraut came out, tasted funny.

Delicious! I will definitely make these again. My husband took the leftover chop to work the next day and he said others had "food envy" :)

Made this recipe in my slow cooker with variation. Used apple cider vinegar 1/2c instead of juice, added 3 washed sliced medium potatoes, 2 pork steaks, and poured in half box of Swansons chicken broth. Layered onion on bottom, potatoes, liquid, browned pork chops, sauerkraut right on tops, then caraway, salt, and pepper.

The only thing I omitted were the caraway seeds because I didn't have any and I dont feel they were needed either. The dish tasted very delicious!!!

So, so good!  I did not have any apple juice so I subbed a 4 oz cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  My taste buds are singing and this is destined to become a new family favorite!!  We are going to try it with bratwurst, too!

This was really good. I sliced two small apples and added since I didn't have apple juice.

My boyfriend said this is the best pork chop he's ever had!  I used a 32 oz. jar of sauerkraut, 2 gala apples and 1 T brown sugar instead of the applesauce.  Next time I will only use half of the red onion because it seemed to be consuming the sauerkraut and the applesauce instead of the apples.  I didn't need to add any water as others have mentioned.  Very good!!

Excellent recipe. I ended up adding more apple juice and some chicken  broth and then cooked down the extra liquid. It really intensified the flavors. I was a bit wary of the caraway seeds but they also added nice flavor. I will definitely make this again

This recipe is a very simple sauerkraut and chops recipe. I made mine as written except I used applesauce instead of apple juice  (2 Tbsp didn't seem worth the expense.) My mother really enjoyed it which is a great complement since she was the German cook in our family. I love caraway seeds in sauerkraut and it made the store bought refrigerated-section sauerkraut very tasty. I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious and easy.  I would definitely make this again. The only change I made to this recipe, I added about a half cup of sweetened applesauce, nice touch! Great recipe for someone who is trying to count calories and enjoy a tasty meal.
