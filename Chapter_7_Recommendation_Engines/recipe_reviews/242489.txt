Made as written except that I thought I had a package of the jasmine rice but I was wrong. The hamburgers were already in the skillet so I substituted a pouch of the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Basmati and it turned out great too. This recipe is super fast and easy and perfect for those times you don't want to spend much time in the kitchen. And, using the Ready Rice cuts back on mess and clean up too. The caramelized onions compliment the beef and gravy nicely and then the egg on top ties them all together perfectly. Thanks for the great recipe Mauigirl!

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe! :) It will be in out rotation of meals :) Thank you for sharing. I cooked this recipe almost exactly as instructed. I did add pepper and salt to the meat and I used a Jagersauce for the gravy. Everyone wanted more, but I made only what I needed for each person. It was more than enough...it was just THAT GOOD!

This was so quick which I love! I did make with turkey instead of beef but I am sure that wouldn't change how I liked it. Great quick meal for a late night.

Very good!  Made exactly as written.  Next time I’ll make the patties flatter as they tended to ball up on me (my issue, not the recipe).  Thanks for sharing!

Super easy!  My sister showed me a picture of Loco Moco, so I had to try making it.  Thanks for the recipe.  Added my own little flair, as always.  Will soon become a family favorite!  :-)

The only flaw in this recipe is how many dishes it generates. Otherwise I would probably make this multiple times a week. Cheap, fast, filling, and delicious.

I really enjoyed this it was delicious. although as I made it I wasn't sure about how it would taste, it seemed an odd combination of ingredients.
However it was amazing. Thank you for the recipe.

This is Amazing!!  Crazy to think such simple ingredients could be so good. Easy to make , very filling, and cheap!  Broken down it comes out to less than $3 a serving. Thanks for a new great recipe to add to our home menu!

Oh man did we love this! This is a great change from the normal routine. I wouldn't have thought it was be as great as it tasted. The onions, rice, gravy, and beef are amazing together! I did add salt, pepper, and onion powder to the ground beef before making the patties.

Oh my loved it loved it.  I did not have any Ready Rice so I cooked up some long grain white rice.  And it worked great.  I also saluted up some mushroom in the pan which I had made the gravy.  Will be making this recipe again.  Thank you mauigirl for such a wonderful recipe.
