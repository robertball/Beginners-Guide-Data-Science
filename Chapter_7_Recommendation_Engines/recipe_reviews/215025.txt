Excellent dry rub! This was perfect for baby back ribs. I cut the amount of ground chipolte powder in half and made up the difference with some additional brown sugar. I like things spicy, but not that spicy... I also used smoked paprika vs. regular because when it comes to baby back ribs that mild smoky flavor pairs well.  We did these on the grill and basted them with KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. There's nothin' like really good BBQ'd ribs!

My husband Rob gave this a high 5, I thought it was way to spicy for myself but he was awwing and hmmmming as he was eating his steak, so he says i can make his steaks this way again. I didn't have dried chipotle pepper so I used red ground cayenne pepper I had on hand. And obviously it worked out very well because he cleaned his plate. Thanks very much, i'll keep this stored just for him.

This rub is great on pretty much any kind of meat. Chicken, pork, steak and even moose. I love spicy foods and this rub is very flavorful.

I cut the salt back by half, that was the only change I made. Absolutely delicious. EXCELLENT on barbeque chicken and gave a nice pop to pre-formed, frozen barbequed hamburger patties. Next time, I'll try this with smoked paprika. I bet that would really take this over the edge.

I omitted the cumin as I am not a big fan of it and it is AWESOME!!!!! I did beer butt chickens rubbed with this and they were phenomenal. I am making home made chicken fingers this week and can't wait to use it again! Edit: the more I use this, the more I like it! I use this as more of a seasoning salt than anything! GREAT in the breadcrmbs for chicken fingers, mixed into ranch dressing as a dip, on things like onion rings, fries, you name it! LOVE this!!!

Made this for dinner tonight and used it on a flank steak. 2 tbsp of rub was the perfect amount for 1.5 lb meat. It had enough heat to be interesting and flavorful, but not so much as to overpower the kids. We'll be using this rub a lot around here.

This rub turned out really good and full of flavor, but I thought it was too salty with a full tablespoon of salt, so I'll likely scale that down to a half Tbs next time. Otherwise, the flavor was great!

Omg!  This recipe made my day!   I had no time to go to the store so I used two Tablespoons of paprika to substitute for the chipotle peppers.  I cut the cumin and salt in half.  The brown sugar and mustard powder amounts were not changed.  I add 1/4 Tablespoon of red pepper to give the dish a kick.  I put this rub and my 1 1/2 lbs  of cubed chicken in a large ziplock bag to marinate for one hour in the fridge.   This meat was fried in a deep pot for 30 min and I added 1/4 Cup of water to simmer 20 min more or until done.  I served it with white rice and sides of corn and black beans.  What a wonderful balance of flavors.  Thanks Kristen for sharing.

I haven't even rubbed it on my chicken yet, just tasted the mixture and I know it will be a hit! Just what I was hoping for one of three beer can chickens I will be grilling for a Summer Party. Thanks so much for the recipe! And it's not too salty either!
*I made the chicken yesterday and it was delicious. Everyone who likes a little heat loved it. I forgot to mention that I used flaked salt so that could be the reason it wasn't too salty. I will be trying this on steak soon!

I was so glad to find this recipe.   My son-in-law gave me a bottle of Hatch Chili powder that he made.  We love hatch chile peppers and needed a way to use the hatch chili powder so we used it in this recipe instead of the Chipotle powder.  Like Jillian, we used a little less chili powder.   We added 2 more Tbsp of brown sugar and another Tbsp of salt and a tsp of garlic powder.  We also used smoked paprika as was suggested.
We used it on baby back ribs and even though we changed it a little the recipe was great!
Thanks to Kristen for adding it!

This spice was amazing on my baked pork chops. I liked the spicy flavor but will have to tone it down for my lady. I will definitely keep this on hand. I will try it on a slab of ribs next time.

I gave it 4 stars because as written I thought that it was a bit too spicy.  My husband who loves spicy food really liked it.  I put it on chicken thighs.  The brown sugar makes it caramelize onto the meat which I liked.  I will make it again but try cutting the chipotle in half.

I diced up pork loin in 1/4 inch cubes, mixed in this rub and blackened in a cast iron skillet.  Served on fresh corn tortillas for some delicious street tacos.

It is a great recipe. I've now made this rub twice I cut the amount of chipotle seasoning and added more brown sugar. It is great on chicken wings as a dry rub.

I ended up only going 1 tablespoon on the chipotle pepper since it needed to be mild enough for them to it and there was PLENTY of kick still for all of us.  I also did 1 tablespoon smoked paprika with 1 tablespoon paprika.  I would definitely use this rub again - used it this time on split chicken breasts and it was terrific!  Next time I might use a little less brown sugar, maybe 1.5T

Love this recipe. We have used this twice now for grilling chicken.  The next time we fire up The Big Green Egg for a pork tenderloin, I am going to try this. I doubled this recipe and turned it into a pasty marinade by adding safflower oil.  I finely ground the rub in a spice grinder and mixed in twice the oil as volume of spices; I then let the favors meld in the fridge for a few hours.  The second time we used this, the marinade had been in the fridge for a few days and just got better with age.  The spice combo was so flavorful that I wanted the marinade to be thick enough to leave a smooth, non-powdery coating on the meat.  I marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts for a couple of hours in a zip top bag.  We seared the breasts on a 500 degree grill (closed the lid) for 5-6 minutes per side.  Before slicing, I let the chicken rest for 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving.  I am looking for the perfect cool sauce to serve with this.  Yum!  Thanks for posting this.

Try adding a little cinnamon (1 or 2 tsp.) depending on your taste. It adds an incredible complexity to the flavor, esp. on ribs!

I added 1 Tbsp of garlic powder and 1 Tbsp of onion powder and I use it in and on EVERYTHING.  I also cut back a little on the cumin.  Exactly what I was looking for.
