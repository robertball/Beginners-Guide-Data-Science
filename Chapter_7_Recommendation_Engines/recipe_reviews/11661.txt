I found this recipe to be rather dry when made as is. The dough was too crumbly and dry to make balls with. When I added another 1/2 stick of butter, I achieved the buttery consistency that is typical of butter ball dough though.

I had been searching for an easy, delicious Christmas cookie to make when I came across these.  It fit all the criteria.  A filling cookie that tastes great with a tall glass of ice cold milk.
