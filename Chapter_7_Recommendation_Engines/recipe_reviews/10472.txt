I made these last year for Christmas and had no problems making them in my new cookie press. It was my first time ever making spritz cookies. I came back this year looking for this recipe to make them again. I made green lime Christmas trees and yellow lemon stars. I also sprinkled on colored sugar before baking them. I was hesitant at making these, but I am glad I did. Yum!

I thought these were great!  The only change I made is that I used almost all of the 6 oz pack of strawberry gelatin (thats what I had) - it hade for a great strawberry flavor!  They worked great in my pampered chef cookie press!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I made this with my cookie press using the heart shape & strawberry jello for a Valentine Banquet.  They turned out great.  They look & tasted wonderful!  I also sprinked them with red sugar before baking.  It made a ton too.  Try it you won't be dissapointed.  I used margarine not butter.

I liked these cookies, but I have a question for those whose cookies did not turn out.  Did you use sugar free jello?  If you did, nutrasweet does not bake well, and that may be why your cookies did not turn out well.

I have made these three years in a row for our school cookie sale, they are a big hit.  For Christmas I use strawberry and lime, but with the lime I need to add a little more food coloring to get that Chirstmas green.

I was scared to make these at first, because I had planned on using my new cookie press and people said they didn't work with the press very well. But I was brave and tried them. They were awesome! I made cute little strawberry hearts for a bridal shower. They were gone instantly, and it made a ton! I will DEFINATELY use this recipe again. Thanks Kathy! :)

My cookie spritz machine is sorely underused and so as I was looking for a recipe, I came across this one and thought, "Strange, but interesting." I used cranberry/raspberry Jello and made little pink stars and this recipe makes a whole lot of cookies.  When they cooled, I drizzled them with Sugar Cookie Glaze from this site that I made light green and they looked so cute.  These were very popular in my Christmas tins that I handed out and my kids loved them!

Very sweet and fruity; therefore, little kids love them!  This recipe worked well in my cookie press (Williams Sonoma). So far, we have made strawberry flowers, and lime Christmas trees...both were very pretty.

These were great!  I used the lime and raspberry.  I used my Christmas gun and made Christmas trees, wreaths and poinsiettas.  These are a great, COLORFUL alternative to regular spritz!!  THANKS for the recipe!

This was one of my favorite cookies growing up! My mom made them for the school's cookie walk. She topped hers with a sprinkle of jello instead of sugar. It made them sparkly and added a little zing!

Jello cookies are the best, I've made them for years and get asked for more every year. The only difference with my version is I only use 1 cup butter and 2 3oz packages of Jello. They are beautiful for Christmas and with less butter they don't spread as much. I think it makes them easier to use in the cookie press as well. You can substitute Splenda for the sugar with good results. Margarine can also be used, but it tastes better with butter.

For those who felt the cookie was too dry, start off with 2 cups of flour and gradually add remaining flour as needed. Sometimes the eggs are larger and require more flour, sometimes the dough requires less flour. I made these two times this season and never needed to use the entire 2 1/2 cups flour.

These are the best!  Lime, raspberry, and orange work the best for flavor and deepest color.

I love spritz cookies (both making and eating them), but i was looking for something a little different. These were great although i did use two 3 oz boxes of orange jello to get a stronger flavor and color. Everyone loved them and asked me to make them again even though they hadn't finished this batch yet!

Okay, I could only use what I had in the pantry.  So I had to adapt this recipe.  I didn't have butter so I used coconut oil and twice the amount.  I only had unflavored gelatin so I added 3 tsp vanilla extract.  I added an extra egg..still too dry. I didn't have a mixer, so I mixed with a spoon and  then rolled the mix into balls which I flattened in my hand and them dipped in confectionery sugar.  I cooked for 10 min ...I caught them in time that they didn't burn.   Considering I was desperate for a cookie and I didn't have the exact ingredients, these were a nice soft cookie that melted in your mouth good. Hit the spot.  I think with butter they would've been awesome, but the coconut oil wasn't half bad.

Sorry, these cookies were not for me. The dough came together fine but the color was really unappealing. I used black cherry jello and while a different flavor of jello might give better color, the dough and the baked cookies had a very strange, artificial fruit aftertaste. I used regular jello, not sugar free so the aftertaste wasn't from a sugar substitute. I only baked one tray of these and then threw the rest of the dough away. I wouldn't serve these to guests and I didn't want to eat them myself either.

Okay, but just okay.  If you are not a cookie baker, this is a quick shortcut to a psuedo spritz cookie. However, your ingredients are better used elsewhere.

This made a LOT of cookies, which is great...I used orange gelatin mix and added a tsp. of orange extract to kick it up a little...Next time I think I am going to use pineapple jello and coconut extract for a pina colada type cookie...these are disappearing as I type!

I was looking for a new recipe for my cookie press.  This was perfect!  I used a 3oz. Jello brand cherry and the color was great. I also used margarine, and reduced heat to 375 degrees for 8-9 minutes.  They freeze really well.  I froze 3 dozen and had another 2 dozen or so gobbled up as they came out of the oven.  Thank you for the recipe. I can't wait to make other colors for other holidays.

These are awesome cookies, though i didn't get enough flavouring from the cherry jello. So i added in Almond extract instead of the vanilla. Received rave reviews at a cookie exchange, so am making 10 dozen more today for another cookie exchange! THANKS!!

This is a great and EASY recipe. These cookies just melt in your mouth. I used this recipe in my cookie press and they turned out perfect. This was my first time using the cookie press successfully as with previous recipes I've used, the dough was too hard. I tried it with blue raspberry gelatin since I wanted blue snowflakes. I did need to add a few drops of color to get them the right shade, though. The gelatin gave it a neat flavor and my hubby and two year old can't keep their hands off them!

These were the perfect consistency for my press. We made green wreaths & trees for Christmas. Nice lemon-lime tang from the jello, setting these apart from the rest of our baking this year. Thank you for posting, Kathy!

I really liked the ones I made with strawberry jello. I did not like the ones made from lime.  Would be very good with raspberry I think.

Its a neat idea to use jello, but even with sugar sprinkled on top its not too sweet or flavorful. I left them in for 6 minutes. You need to wait until they cool completely because they're a little soft inside at first. I made them in the shape of flowers with my cookie press, and they make pretty pink cookies.

Only two stars because as easy as these cookies are to make they lack a lot of flavour.  I used a whole box of strawberry gelatin, plus 1/4 tsp strawberry extract and then rolled them in more strawberry gelatin before baking and they still lacked the intense flavour I was looking for.  I don't own a fancy cookie press so I refrigerated my dough, rolled in balls (tossed in gelatin) and flattened with a plate.  Don't cook for more than 7 minutes or else they get to brown and hard.

I wasn't sure how these cookies would turn out because of the mixed reviews, but overall, they turned out pretty good.  I used orange flavored jello and made orange pumpkins for Halloween, decorated with colored sugar.  My cookies had an overly buttery flavor to them, which put me off, but everyone else seemed to like them.  I also agree with other reviewers that they spread too much, probably because of the extreme amount of butter.  I think I will probably use at least a 1/2 stick less of butter next time.  But, nonetheless, there will be a next time.  I think I'm gong to try lime green X-mas trees as part of my holiday baking.

They spread too much- I would *never* mess with them in a spritz. Tasted OK, people ate them, but there were leftovers- never a good sign. I would not make these again. There are too many good cookies out there to get fat on the mediocre.

If you are gonna be using a cookie press, DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE. The cookies do taste good but maybe they should be rolled. They do not bake properly and you have to press them down with a fork before baking, which messes up your cookie press design.. The reason the one reviewer thought they had an icky taste was because they probably were raw.

I made 'lime' Christmas trees and they came out great. I added 3 drops of green food coloring and about half a teaspoon of pandan to it to increase their color, as pandan is similar enough to vanilla to go well with it.  One recipe makes 4-5 cookie sheets of little shapes. I'll be making these again.

I made these since I find most cookie press recipes to be dry and boring and was very impressed with the results. I actually added just a tiny bit on lemon lime koolaid mix too since I wanted a stronger lime flavor. The cookies were tasty and not too dry, they disappeared very quickly when I took them to work.

These were simple to make and pretty decent overall. I used lemon jello and would have used lemon extract if I had had any on hand. I could taste the jello but it was mild flavored. Decent enough that I would use this recipe again. These were perfect for the cookie press. These were tricky to bake though, it took 6 min on 1 cookie sheet, 7 min on the other and both were wilton brand.

Great recipe with great flavor! I will use it again next year.  One caution is that you really have to watch the time very carefully or your cookies will burn in the blink of an eye and be on the crispy side
Unfortunately my new cookie press didn't have what it took to go the distance and it went in the trash can :(

As others stated this recipe did spread more then I like for Spritz, but they were the perfect red for Valentines Day hearts and quite flavorful (cherry).  We enjoyed them, especially the kids at my son's preschool.  So they weren't so crispy I lowered the temp to 350 and the cooking time to 5 1/2 minutes on nonstick pans.

I had high hopes for this recipe since I love funky stuff like adding jello to cookies. However, I was really disappointed with the taste. I used lime jello and made Christmas trees with my press, but the flavor was a little icky. Nobody really liked them and I felt that my mom's regular butter spritz cookies, made with almond extract, were far superior. I'm not sure if I picked the wrong flavor, but I hate to waste so much butter trying again. I really wanted to make strawberry-flavored hearts for Valentine's Day, too!

I have had this recipe for years and years; a JELL-O classic. Critical to use real butter, real sugar,  and original Jello, not the sugar free.   I have never been disappointed and they are easy to make and taste great.  Use different flavors of Jello to create various colors and flavors. An additional hint is to sprinkle the cookie not with sugar on top, but an additional sprinkle of the same flavor Jello; you will need an additional Jello box of each flavor to do this.  Add maraschino cherries or holiday sprinkles on top.

This dough works well and the cookies taste pretty good, but I tend to agree with those who say the color is too strong. My husband's immediate reaction was 'yuck', but he didn't mind eating them.  I might try them again using half the Jell-o.  That said, the intense color is probably okay for poinsettias and hearts, especially if they're on a tray with some less colorful cookies.  It's also worth noting that cherry flavor looked more orangy red than you might expect, probably because the butter and egg give it a yellow cast.

They turn out perfect every year!  The dough presses well and is easy to work with.  I do add a little food coloring and substitute vanilla for lime, or what ever flavor gelatin for a bolder taste, but it is not necessary.  I have also used the sugar free Gelatins and they work well too.  They are always a favorite on my cookie platter.

These are great cookies. I used this recipe with my cookie press for the first time and I was amazed at how easy it was. The only thing I would change is the amount of gelatin. I followed the recipe and did 3 oz but next time I will probably double that since the flavor wasn't very noticeable of course it could also vary depending of the type of gelatin you use.

I made 1/2 recipe with lemon jello.  The taste was nice, but the dough was awful.  It was too soft for my press and when I rolled it into balls, it just spread out flat.  I won't use this recipe again, but I will use the idea of adding jello in place of some of the sugar in another receipe.

I made these cookies tonight with my 12 year old daughter Anissa, "WOW" really cool cookies, we did press cookies with my grandmothers press,. Just think of the possibilities, any flavor, any color, for any holiday. Dough was wonderful to work with. My daughter had fun. Super easy... Five Stars....

I took these to work and received so many compliments on them that I couldn't give them anything BUT 5 stars. I admit I halved the recipe and used an entire box of raspberry sugar-free jello, as well as added 1-2 T of milk to the dough, as it was very dry and crumbly. Because of its texture, I didn't use a cookie press, but mashed the cookies into balls and flattened them slightly before I baked them. They really didn't spread at all, so you can pack them in on the cookie sheets. Once they cooled I made an icing out of 1 1/4 c powdered sugar, 2 t corn syrup, 2 T milk and 1/4 t each of vanilla, almond and lemon extracts. The end results were really cute and were SO good. Thanks a bunch!

These are better after the second day, the flavor is richer. I've  been making them for three years,everyone asks for them at Christmastime; my children love to press them with the glass/sugar.

as far as drop cookies you could make it work but not pressed.  they spread very widely, the press design is lost.  I made strawberry, not bad on taste but my daughter thought they were too sweet.

UPDATE LIME is my #1 pick! You can add food coloring to batter for brighter colors as well! Um..ya black cherry may give you an odd color but nothing a little food coloring wouldnt help! I recommend using a flavor you like. Hubby found pineapple jello in another state! Going to try that this year. I make 1500 + Xmas cookies for cookie trays and These break up the monotony of them all tasting the same.These are my all time favorite Christmas cookies - lime is awesome! I made these as written last year and they were great! I noticed another reviewer used 6 oz of jello and I gave it a shot - I'm glad I did! Even better!! I used a Wilton cookie press with Xmas tree insert - sprinkled with colored sugar before baking. I bake these at 375 for 7 min 15 seconds - let cool on sheet.  I don't like the edges getting overly brown. So lower temp seems to do the trick.

I made these yesterday, but I used 2 of the 3 ounce packages of JELLO, and did not use the sugar called for in the recipe.  The cookies came out with amazing taste!  Planning to make them again in orange flavor.

I made these cookies with a few alterations. First, I doubled the amount of gelatin (I used strawberry) for a more intense flavor. Second, I didnt use a cookie press, I just flattened slightly with the bottom of a glass. I lowered my oven temp to 375, and baked for 7 min. They turned out perfect. Great cookies!

I made lime trees and cherry stars for a cookie exchange and they turned out wonderfully. My first batch turned out dark like the picture so i reduced the temp to 350 and the baking time to 5 minutes. This made over 10 dozen cookies with my Wilton press! Will definitely get rave reviews--guaranteed!

These were yummy, but they didn't have as much fruity flavor as I thought they would.  Maybe next time I will add a little bit of extract (such as almond or cherry) to enhance the flavor.

I was looking for a good cookie recipe and remembered I had gelatin powder - this one worked out perfectly!  I halfed everything in the recipe except the egg and the gelatin, used strawberry flavour and made 23 cookies.  They were fast and easy to make (I didn't put them in the fridge because the texture was already fine for rolling), and when I brought them to a floor meeting in residence, they disappeared in minutes.

This was a very good tasting, easy recipe.  I had no problem with the cookies spreading too much, and I did use an electric press as well as a manual cookie press.

The cookies were very fun and easy to make.  The gelatin gave the dough the perfect amount of fruity flavor.  My kids and parents loved them (good to make for a diverse crowd!)  However, I found that this recipe made the cookies spread out more than usual and the press shapes did not hold their form as well as with regular spritz recipes.

This is great!! My 3-year old loved making orange pumpkins to decorate for Halloween.
