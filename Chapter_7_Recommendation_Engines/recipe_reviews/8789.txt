We actually really liked this, I did tweek a bit by starting with Olive Oil and minced fresh garlic in Dutch oven then added the cubed chicken and I used about 1 tblsp. of the turmeric.  I also added the garlic powder, some salt and pepper at this point.  Cooked til chicken was almost to the point of browning then added potatoes, carrots, onion, 3tblsp. of tomato paste in 1 cup of chicken broth and added some more salt and pepper at this point due to the high volume of potatoes.  I cooked on Med. low for maybe 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, then added 1/2 cup of frozen peas for color and used 1/2 cup of cold water to blend in about 2tblsp. of flour to thicken the stew.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. of kitchen bouquet.  Served with fresh baguette and it was perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  This was the first time I have ever had chicken stew!

This stew was fantastic! The only change I made was the addition of a 1/2c of chicken broth, and a can of corn towards the end of cooking. I thought it was an aweful lot of potatoes, but they really helped thicken the liquid and make it hearty. I think the turmeric made all the difference. I was really iffy about how it would taste but oh it was wonderful! I will make this all the time. So easy and flavorful and filling.

I just made this recipe today and I have to say it was very easy. I've been wanting to make stew for quite sometime, except I do not eat beef. This is a pleasant change from traditional stew. Although I did have to add some spice to make it flavorful, along with some fresh garlic and zucchini. There also wasn't an abundance of sauce, so I added some extra water. All and all it's a pretty comforting meal.

My husband claimed this was the nicest thing I've ever made! It was really yummy-I normally don't eat vegetables-but I loved this!

My family was a bit leery of the tomato paste added to the stew because they are used to seeing more of a white based sauce in my stews.  Everyone loved this stew and it was very easy to make.  I will definitely make this again!

This was fine but not great once I doctored it up a bit.  I did what someone else suggested and added more water and some flour to make it more like a stew.  I also added a can of chicken broth.  I used all the spices recommended, plus some extra turmeric, garlic powder, and a bit of Lawry's seasoned salt.

Our friends served this stew to us last night and it was delicious - I couldn't believe how easy she said it was to prepare - so I looked up the recipe and have saved it to my favorites!

I am sorry but this was just a basic chicken stew. Good in all rights but no pizazz.

I was actually really surprised about this recipe! I made it because I had all the ingredients and because I wanted something new. I was kind of skeptical about how it would turn out, but I got to say, it was pretty good. I took some  suggestions of other reviewers and tweeked the recipe.  First, I browned the chicken with garlic powder and black pepper before I added it to the other ingredients. Second, I omitted the carrots (because we are not big fans) and the turmeric (because I couldn't find it in the grocery store).  Third, I used 1 cup of chicken broth (instead of water) and added 6 Tbsp. of tomato sauce (instead of tomato paste).  It turned out a lot better than I expected. Thanks for a good recipe! I will definitely make this again!

Good basic chicken stew recipe, but I also added a sweet potato, celery, and more tumeric, also added chicken broth instead of water.  Good basic recipe but I would spice it more for my family.

Very tasty and hearty. I added a few dumplings since I adore them. A great wintertime comfort food!

I made this last night and it was a big hit,my husband who is a picky eater actually liked it that he had 2 big plates and there were no leftovers,I added extra turmeric,salt,pepper and garlic powder it made it taste a little better,I will definitely make this again. hint: if you don't have tomato paste, I think 1/2 cup of tomato sauce will work just fine.

This was pretty dry if prepared as directed (which I did, initially). That said, it is adaptable. It reminds me more of a starting point for curry. But even for that you would want more liquid, I think. The plus of it, besides adaptability is that the ingredient list is short and full of staple items. Thank you for sharing.

My whole family loved this recipe.  Thank you!  I added lots of additional veggies - zucchini, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, cherry tomatoes - but I didn't need to add any extra spices or liquid - it was just right!

Pretty bland.  Perhaps it needed the salt that I omitted.  Had hoped the tumeric and fresh garlic would overcome the need for salt.  But they failed to enliven flavor of any kind.

Although this was very easy to prepare we found it to be quite bland even with extra spices.  If I was to make this again I would certainly have to "doctor" it up to make it worthwhile.

This is a good basic recipe that can easily be dressed down or up.  I dressed it down, at first, but found (like others) that I had to add more spices, veggies, etc. during the tasting process.

This was a good meal, easy to fix and very good.  I added a few things, some squash and some veggies that were left over from another meal.  I'll probably make this a lot this winter, I love that chicken is making stew!

I just did not like the tomato paste. The stew turned out globby and way too potatoey for my taste. Kinda sad  I wasted expensive chicken breasts in this.
