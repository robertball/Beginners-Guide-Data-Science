SO GOOD!!!  Surprisingly easy & they taste like the ones you'd get at Olive Garden.  >>>>   One note - the crispier, the better, so definitely let them fry.  I took a few out too soon & while they were still good, they weren't as outstanding as the crispy ones. >>>     I also didn't use anywhere close to 3 cups of oil -- I used a regular skillet & put about 1/4 inch deep of Canola oil.

I have always ordered fried ravioli when we went out to eat and loved it.  I found this recipe and hoped it was close to what I had before, and it is.  These were sooo good.  I will definitley be making them again.  My daughter and husband really liked them as well.  I served with spaghetti sauce.  Really good.  You have to try them.....

SO delicious! Made this exactly as written other than I used Panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. Served with homemade meatballs & marinara sauce and my family LOVED it...even my husband who "hates pasta without meat" had seconds WITHOUT extra meatballs!

I made these on the fly 2 days ago. They turned out great and were very tasty. I used my deep fryer to fry them as I was short on time. I made 20, 10 as the recipe directed and 10 I floured then egged then put them in the bread crumbs. I couldn't tell a difference between the 2.

great! instead of vegetable oil i used extra virgin olive oil to give it a more "italian" taste. i also served these with a side of ranch dressing (and homemade marinara) to give a couple options, and sprinkled with both parmesan and red pepper flakes immediately after removing them from the oil

Good recipe, but do not use anything but Panko bread crumbs. Season these as needed. Once you try Panko bread crumbs, you'll never go back to the standard, nasty, manufactured crumbs.

I have made these before using buttermilk instead of milk and egg and left out the extra salt as the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese are salty enough.

Loved these! I used butternut squash and cheese ravioli's and they were amazing. It was time consuming but well worth it. I made a homemade marinara sauce to go with them instead of jar. And even enjoyed them the next day. Thanks for the recipe.

Not too shabby. I made my own raviolis though, using wonton wrappers and a blend of 3 cheeses. Since I already had these on hand, I just took them out of the freezer an hour before cooking, then followed the regular recipe. The only difference is that I only fried them for about a minute, then I scooped them out of the oil and placed them on a baking sheet which I threw right into the oven. I had the oven preheated at 375 and I only left the raviolis in there for about 4-5 minutes. I just wanted to de-greasify them a bit. :) Hubby and I really liked these with the Classico sauce and a side of garlic bread.

This was easy to make. I allowed my 5 yo to make them while I cooked dinner. (minus the frying part) I added garlic powder and Italian herb seasoning  to my bread crumbs.  My 9 yo is so picky, but she enjoyed these. I will make them again next week.

These were awesome.  I fried them in my frying pan, that I filled half way with oil. (it was not 3 inches) but they cooked just fine, just dont hesitate to flip them. my first few were over cooked because I wasnt sure when to flip them.

Being engaged to an Italian man, he expects me to make a lot of Italian-type dishes. My son and I do not share his love for Italian food, although we do like it occasionally. I found that this recipe was a great way to turn the dish into something that we all love, especially my son. 

When I told him we were having ravioli for dinner, he said, "Ravioli? Can't we have something else?" I told him I was making it a different way and promised he'd like it. But he didn't just like it, he LOVED it! 

I did use panko breading as recommended by several other reviews. I didn't need 3 cups of oil, as that amount was just not necessary. I also used EVOO rather than vegetable oil. 

I forgot to thaw the ravioli so I threw them in a pot of semi warm water for a few minutes. Everything turned out great. These were quick, easy and delicious. A great way to spice up ravioli.

These were not bad, but my boyfriend did not like them at all, and he loves pasta of all kinds, especially ravioli. For some reason he was quite put off by the breading, the crispiness. I think it was just so far from normal ravioli that it was not good for him. I didn't hate them, but it was a lot of trouble to do an egg wash and breading for each ravioli, and then to fry them. The breading came off quite a bit in the frying pan as well. Some of them I cooked a little more, and some of them I cooked a little less, for a comparison. They were both crispy, but the darker ones had more of a burnt flavor while the golden ones were just right. So over all, it migth be worth a try...I think it is a personal preference and they may be good enough for you to go through the effort. Oh and I used panko bread crumbs, and mixed a tablespoon of blue cheese dressing into the egg. That didn't seem to make much of a difference.

Tried this out on my boyfriend and his 3 year old son, WE ALL LOVED THEM. The little one and daddy as seconds!  I used a semi-homemade marinara sauce from another site, and I use Panko Bread  but this was awesome! I am not one for frying but I have always loved this appetizer in restaurants.  Will make this one again and again!!!!

My family and I were not thrilled with this recipe. Maybe it was the kind of ravioli I purchased, but the cheese inside became very hard when fried. I may try again with a better product and see if that makes a difference.

YUM!!!  My entire family loved these.  I used Egg Beaters instead of egg because I had some that needed to be used and skim milk instead of whole because it is what I had.  I also used a mix of Italian and planko bread crumbs.  So good!!!!
