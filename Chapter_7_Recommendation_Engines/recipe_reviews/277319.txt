The flavour was great but it took much longer to cook the rice. I’ll definitely make it again.

It didn’t come to pressure but the timer started the countdown. Giving it time to rest, I Che Jed and everything was good but the rice was under cooked. I’m not sure what happened. I set to sauté and closed the lid for 6 minutes and then the rice caught up. My husband loved it! We served with cheese, sour cream, and flour tortillas.
