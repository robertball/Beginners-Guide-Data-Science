I really like this recipe but there are a few changes I made that I have found in similar recipes:

First, for the sauce instead of adding the Splenda and food coloring I added 1/4 cup of sugar (I prefer it) and 1/2 cup of ketchup. The ketchup makes it a great consistency, still has that sweet & sour coloring, and adds a great depth to the flavor. 

Second, instead of 2 green bell peppers, I added a yellow and red peppers. They add more color to the dish and have that sweetness that goes great with the sauce. 

Third, I found marinating the chicken in soy and lightly flouring and browning was a quicker, healthier way to cook the chicken. 

But still a great recipe. Try it out!

I skipped battering and frying the chicken, we cubed it, cooked it in about 1/2 TBS olive oil and added diced veggies (onion, carrots, green pepper and a little celery) and let that saute about 10 minutes while I prepped the sauce. I combined the sauce with the veggie/chicken mixture and stirred in some fresh diced pineapple at the very end. A very tasty meal! My husband and son liked this sauce better than the one I've been using. :)

I make this with chicken and pork tenderloin! My husband says it's much better (and healthier) than that our favorite Chinese Restaurant! I do use extra pineapple juice for the sauce! Yummy!

I dont like when I change the serving numbers on any recipe.  I changed this one to 4 servings.  The yeldings in the directions do not change and if you are not careful, you may mess up!  Example: 
1. Combine 1 1/2 cups water
    Should be 3/4 cups.
2.  Combine flour, 2 tablespoons oil.
      Should be 1 tablespoons oil.

If you are careful and catch this, this is a five star recipe in my humble opinion : )

the sauce was very tasty, i added carrot slices and watercrests (spelling???), and would make that again; however, the batter was a mess; clean up was bad enough, but the taste was not fit for consumption!  next time i would just dust it with tempura flour or all purpose,

I could not tell the difference between this and what you would buy at a take-out restaurant. The girl friend couldn't tell the difference either. I was a bit worried about the sauce, but it came out fine. 

I followed the modified directions of another persons comments since I didn't have any Splenda. I used a half cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of sugar for the sauce. Everything came out just fine and tasted wonderful.

i added a bit more seasoning to the chicken to bring up the flavor, the parsley and basil made it smell even better, the sauce was okay but i ended up doing it over using the ketchup and sugar instead, tasted so much better! :)

Great recipe! As other reviewers said, I did regular sugar and added ketchup. I also added more spices to the chicken batter (garlic and onion powder, ginger) 

My family thought this was better than the local restaurants! I won't be making it every day because it certainly isn't healthy and took a very long time overall to make, but this will be my go-to meal for date nights or special dinners!

I've never been fond of homemade Chinese because it never tastes authentic, however, this was fantastic!  I only made it for the hubs because the kids and I were having something else but I did taste it as I went along and it was great.  I would've given 5 stars but I followed too many of the reviewers suggestions, which were very helpful.  I lightly dusted the cut up chicken in seasoned flour and pan fried in evoo then removed and sauteed the bell pepper in same pan for 5 mins. then added the pineapple chunks and cooked till carmel-y, another 5 mins. Removed those and made sauce in same pan with 1/2 C. ketchup, 1/4 C. vinegar, 1 1/2 C. water, 1/2 C. sugar and reserved pineapple juice and s & p...brought to boil, removed from heat and added diluted cornstarch and whisked till thickened, served over jasmine rice. My husband nearly licked his plate clean!
