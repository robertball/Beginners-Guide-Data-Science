Just tried this recipe for the first time. I have never found a potato pancake recipe that I liked 'til this one! It's excellent! My "picky eaters" ate all I made and asked for more. Thank you.

I gave this a 4 rating because they turned out dry and floury.  I think with about 1 cup less flour, this recipe will be a 5 star for me!  They had a good flavor sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

These potato pancakes are so good! Make sure to use the whole batter and not save any for later.  My unused batter turned black after a few hours in the fridge.

This is excellent. However, it could use a little more salt, but that's just my opinion. Sour cream goes great with it!

By putting the potatoes in a blender you create paste. They need to be HAND grated  and not shredded either.

This recipe was excellent! It was very easy to make too! While reading the previous reviews for this recipe, some people said that it was very dry.  This was NOT the case in my cooking trial.  Just remember that if you decide to grind the potatoes and the onions by hand, that you DO NOT drain the left-over water.  Overall, a wonderful recipe.

These pancakes are a great recipe! Very tasty! The only things I did differently were leave the potato skins on, and cut the potatoes and onions.  I didn't blend them up.

I scaled this recipe down a little since it was just my husband and I. I had never had potato pancakes before - but my husband wanted them so I made them and I was pleasantly surprised. These are really good! I did add more salt and pepper then called for.. and I think that I may have used a little more onion too. I think there is a lot that you can do with this recipe to accommodate it to your tastes .. I will definitely make them again but I may add some diced jalapenos to spice it up just a little and I may add a little grated cheddar too :-)

I had about a pound of some flavorful leftover garlic mashed potatoes to use so I mixed it with 2 eggs and 1.5 cups of pancake mix and pepper.  It was pretty sticky but molded into pancakes well enough with oiled hands.  Drizzled olive oil into pans to cook until nicely browned and served with shredded cheddar and salsa.  These were pretty good.

I halved the recipe and used 2 eggs. Made plenty for family of 4 and had leftovers. Will try to make them thinner next time....they were a little thick and therefore a little dense the first time but taste was still good.

I liked this a lot and the kids ate all and asked for more. We have a winner.
I used 1.5 cups of applesauce and omitted the eggs. Very good flavor.

Wow! I've never had potato pancakes before I have a bunch of potatoes that I need to use up and this sounded good.  Follow the recipe just like written. I had no problems with dry, floury pancakes. You will find liquid as you grate the potatoes/onions, don't drain it. Use it in the recipe.  I will totally be making this again. I think they taste best warm with a bit of butter. Tomorrow morning, we will try them with a homemade syrup recipe from this site.     Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I scaled the recipe down: used 3/4 cup Bisquick, 1 egg, 2 medium potatoes and one small zucchini. I did add 1/4 cup milk otherwise it would have been too dry. In addition to chopped onion I added 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp dill and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Cooked very nicely at low heat for about 4 minutes each side.

One problem with how this recipe is written: It states in a food processor grate potatoes and onion,  it would be more helpful to state as: grate potatoes  and chop onion fine.

I was concerned with the recipe not being too dry so I used 5 eggs and added 1/2 cup of oil, I beat eggs & oil till foamy, than I added pancake mix, started mixer & added onions, potatoes, salt pepper and continued mixing until well incorporated.  Than turned out onto a sizzling griddle, spread potatoes out with mixture, turned when bubbly, these turned out like heaven, we used sour cream and/or chunky applesauce with cinnamon and/or real maple syrup.

I even doubled this recipe and it turned out with excellent results, for doubling I used 10 eggs and 1 cup oil.


I never thought about using pancake mix! What a great thought, thanks for submitting this recipe.

This recipe makes ALOT of pancakes! And I think there is a miscalculation on the amount of vegetable oil needed....One tablespoon for 5 LBS of potatoes?!? I was frying pancakes for 1-1/2 hrs. and used about 3/4 - 1 cup over the course of that time.

I grated my potato and onion by hand and would discourage use of mashed potatoes as some reviewers had done. Onion was good but I think it would be good with chives, served with sour cream. At first I didn't think the batter would hold  as it just seemed like potato and not much else but it worked. I used more oil than specified which made them a little greasy. I also scaled back the recipe to 3 servings.

looking for something for a quick breakfast, thought I'd try these.  Used frozen hash browns (worked just fine) chopped shallots and a little soy milk to thin out the batter a bit. They came out wonderful, tasty, crisp and I'll make them again without any hesitation. I only gave 4 stars because they weren't like my dad's, which used less flour and were much more crispy....but then again, I've never been able to duplicate his potato pancakes and probably never will.

I LOVED this version. I did make some changes. Instead of grating I used the processor to chop the potatoes and onion together. That was it really. Hubby did like but said to ease up on the onion a little. Just as good the next day for a snack that I shared with my son. He really liked them. I had no problems with it being too floury or anything else.

this recipe was just okay. i found them slightly bland, and i even added green onions to them to try to up the flavor. one thing to remember when using a boxed pancake mix is to make sure it's not too sweet. otherwise they just taste funny.

I was kind of disappointed by this recipe.  I used to make potato pancakes with my mom (different recipe) and they always came out great. This recipe left me with a big goopy mess that wouldn't cook right (it was too watery to fry).  I finally got fed up and threw it in a greased 9x13.  It baked well and didn't stick (like I thought it would), but it was ridiculously dense.  My boyfriend (who's part Jewish and loves potato pancakes) said it was different but tasted ok.  I think I'll stick to my mom's recipe from now on- it's more work but worth it.

I used the basic recipe,I didn't use 5 lbs of potatoes it's just the 2 of us so I just peeled what I needed. Then I added half of a large onion and 3 cloves of garlic salt and pepper to taste. Then put in 2 large eggs and then added the pancake batter (pwd form) I used Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix.The kind you use will make a difference, this is the best I have ever found. Put in enough so batter is not too runny then fry in oil. My pancakes turned out the best they ever had! Even my husband was happy with them.

Made it and it was quite good. Don't have a food processor so shredded the potatoes and the chopped the hell out of the them as well as the onion. Washed and rung out the potatoes. Next time will cut down a bit on the pancake mix, add more onion and will try cooking in some duck fat.

I used some left over mashed potatoes; I seasoned it as instructed, but I had some left over crispy fried on onions ( the kind you put on green bean casserole). I crushed them up and folded them into the batter.  It was outstanding!!   I cooked them in a pain with butter about 3 min on each side over med heat.  My 7 y/o ate 5 of them.

Woke up Christmas Eve Morning with a strong hankering for potato pancakes!Ask myself do u really want to get into all that? So I made an adjustment, some may call cheating, but made this so much faster, easier, and tastes exactly the same. I used frozen hash browns, thawed by running under cold water in a strainer for about 2 minutes.  Dried off potatos with paper towels. Then continued as usual. I also added fresh chopped garlic, a dash of paprika & couple drops of worschestershire sauce. Another quick time saver I used my pancake flipper pan. Double sided pan They turned out so delicious!.

Great recipe, good consistency.  I added garlic and corn to the last half of the batch and they were yummy, the first ones were a bit sweeter, probably due to my pancake mix.

I followed the recipe exactly but with regard to technique - after grating the potato and onion in my food processor, I then poured them into a towel to squeeze out the excess water. These were extremely easy to prepare and the only suggestion I would make is to salt to your personal taste.

I make these on a regular basis now. Hubby requests them. Only change I make is I mix a little milk so it's not so dry.

Original recipe would be a lot of food. Cut down to 5 servings for a family of four. Great recipe.

I have always used flour to give the pancakes their thickness, however seeing this recipe using the pancake mix I gave it a try.  I used Bisquick and a cup less than the recipe.  They were the fluffiest potato pancakes I have ever seen and quite delicious too.  Will definitely make this way again.  The family varied with their toppings from ketchup to sour cream to apple sauce and my brother even used PANCAKE SYRUP!

Going to give it a go using Buckwheat pancake mix. Wheat intolerant. Love potato cakes/fritters first for pancakes

I added 2 1/2 cups of bisquck and started stirring.  I had two much liquid so I threw in the rest of a small box.  These were really really good!  The recipe makes a ton of them though!

I grew up with potato pancakes from a box,  never my favorite.  Made these on a whim thinking it would be fun and loved them!  Can't wait to read the rest of the reviews and play with the recipe for next time
