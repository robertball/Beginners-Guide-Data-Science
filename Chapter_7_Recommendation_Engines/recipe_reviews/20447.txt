I'm usually not a big fan of tuna, but this recipe was easy and delish!  The only flaw with this recipe is that it didn't produce enough tuna mixture to fill 4 muffins (8 halves).  I ended up only doing 3 muffins (6 halves).  I also used a cheddar-jack (cheddar and monterey jack) cheese instead of just cheddar.  I love the celery concept because I'm just not a big fan of raw onions!  The tomato is also a nice touch.  Highly recommend for a quick snack or easy lunch!

Loved this tuna melt! I used hamburger buns and I toasted them first. I used colby-jack cheese. They turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were wonderful!  I thought the tuna mixture seemed too dry with only 2 Tbl of mayo, so I added more.  But after it baked under the broiler, the tuna mixture became really moist, almost too moist - I think because the tomato adds moisture.  So next time, I'll stick to the recipe to a tee!  It was sooooo good!!!

Perfect for lunch!  I haven't had a tuna melt in a long time.  I used whole grain english muffins and added added some black pepper, finely chopped red onion, a bit of garlic powder and a little more mayo to the tuna salad.

My family really liked these. I'm not a big tuna fan, but I was surprised how well these turned out with such little effort. I did add some sweet relish and replaced the salt with Mrs. Dash Original Blend. I also used Monterey Jack .

These little sandwiches are really yummy. I added just a teeny tiny smidge of pepper, onion powder and garlic powder, and used sliced provolone cheese instead of cheddar. They are really fast and easy and the family loved them!

Really good and easy.  Sadly, I had no celery, so I just used a sprinkle of celery salt.  I also had to use regular (whole-wheat) bread because I don't have English muffins.  I used light mayo, and a little less than called for.  It seems dry at first but once it's out of the oven, it's moist and perfect.  I used a can of boneless pink salmon, which tasted very similar to tuna.  Good lunch with some fruit!

My picky boys (6 and 8) loved this.  I minced the celery so that they did not even notice it and I used grated cheese that I had on hand and stirred it into the tuna mixture and put some on top too!  Very cheesy.

These are so good and quick and easy!  I added 3 tablespoons of onion.  The only way my picky teenager will eat these is to use plain tuna for his.  These are great for those nights when you don't want to cook!

Delightful! A perfect recipe for a light lunch or dinner. I'm not an english muffin fan, so I used Texas Toast. I also omitted the salt, didn't feel the need for it. Thanks for the quick, tasty dinner.

This was just ok.  At 3 minutes, my cheese had burnt and I had to peel it off, so be sure to check on it often!

This was absolutely delicious! We did add a little more tuna then suggested and it comes in smaller cans now anyway. The celery made it taste more like a tuna salad then a plain tuna sandwich. I used sharp cheddar cheese. Great simple sandwich.

We omit the celery, salt and tomato. we like Kraft Deluxe American Cheese slices-for "meltiness", white Albacore Tuna in water(Drained),real full-fat Mayo (Probably 3 Tablespoons per can of tuna) for best results. One small can of tuna does not really fill 8 muffin halves if you are feeding hearty appetites.

my family loved this recipe..some like tomato and some don't but with or without it was a great recipe!
I have made this with crab salad, provolone, several cheeses at once...and a dash of sour cream sometimes. It is a great base recipe to make your own and jazz it up..but even as it is it is delicious!

Thanks! This is very good for a light dinner. Also love it on a cold afternoon for a tasty lunch! I prefer to use sharp cheddar for a little kick.

Was looking for a nice healthy yet filling tuna sandwich recipe and this looked really promising! I made this twice: one following the recipe exactly minus the celery (for my brother) but for myself I had to make a custom version for less calories and because I'm not much of a mayo fan and since I also felt like experimenting!

Skipped the mayo and celery and used homemade pesto sauce (walnuts, pinenuts, basil, seasoning) for the tuna mixture instead (don't expect the mixture to look good, but it tastes great especially if you love pesto!), use sundried tomatoes to complement the pesto instead of the fresh kind, and lite pepperjack cheese (the only other cheese I had) used whole wheat English muffins as well. It was great!

I'd try this (my version) for a wrap as well next time!

Really good and easy to make. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use double the filling, and added a pinch of onion powder for more flavor. Even our 4 year old liked it. This served three of us for dinner, two adults and the little guy.

yummy and quick! Light and great for lunch or a light dinner. Left out the celery because we aren't fans in my house, but added red onion and lettuce. Loved how easy this was to make and how delicious it turned out!

These were surprisingly good - and so easy!  I made sure to chop up my celery very fine so my little ones didn't fuss.  I salted and peppered to taste, of course.  I think I may play around with the type of cheese in the future.  Not that there was anything wrong with the cheddar, but I think provolone or even pepper-jack may be a nice change here and there.  What a fantastic busy weeknight fix!

These were really good. I made them thinking that just my husband and I would be eating them, but surprisingly my 14 year old and 9 year old LOVED them. I was shocked. They kept saying 'these are so good'! I served them with the delicious ham and potato soup from this site. This was a 'low on groceries' meal and was what I could make with what was on hand and my 9 year old said that this was the best meal I ever made. Ummm, I seriously hope not because it was WAY easy and very simple, good, but not my best meal ever!  I highly recommend this recipe.  It would be way better with fresh from the garden tomatoes, though!

This is such a yummy and easy treat for a quick lunch or supper.  I didn't have celery, and I usually add chopped pickle to my tuna, but tonight I used a spoonful of capers and some greek seasoning, delicious.  Served with Racael Ray's Quick Creamy Tomato Soup.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Yummy and so quick! I used fake corned beef (vegetarian option) instead of tuna, and it was a breeze.  Only thing I had a problem with is that it was a bit too oily for my tastes... hubby (who ate it with real tuna as recipe says) thought so, too...  Less mayo next time for me!

I thought this would be too plain, but it was delicious!  I just added salt and pepper... the flavor was awesome.  I only broiled mine long enough to melt the cheese (less than a minute).

Yummy easy and fast! Good to turn to recipe when its already past dinner time and you just started thinking about what to make. We leave out the celery-just personal preferance but can't go wrong with these.

Substituted dill pickles for the celery.  Tomato is what make these better them some tuna melts, IMHO.  Served with a salad for a quick and delicious dinner.

I forgot to add the celery, but this was still good.  I used a pouch of tuna instead of a can and I think it was a few ounces more, so it left the tuna mixture kinda dry, but that was okay the juicy tomato helped with that. Will make again and experiment with seasonings and cheeses!

Didn't have any celery so added some celery seed.  Broiling a tomato doesn't sound too appetizing and I left that off, though I might like it added afterwards.  Easy, decent, but didn't think they were anything special.

Great quick meal! My husband and I both loved it.  Used toasted wheat bread instead of muffins, and had to open another can of tuna to cover 8 slices, but worked out great.

This is a great lunch sandwich.  I took two English muffins, split them (so a total of four halves) and spread the tuna mixture on the four halves.  I was in a rush, so instead of chopping celery, I used a dash of celery salt instead of regular salt.  It was fast, easy and delicious for the two of us.  I recommend sharp cheddar.

Easy to make and so tasty.  Had it for lunch for my friends and they raved about it.  Also the leftovers heated up well.  I doubled this recipe and added more mayonnaise.  I sliced fresh tomatoes and put on top after I baked the tuna muffins since some of my friends didn't want tomato on their tuna.

wonderfull we were suprised how good this turned out. I had to use cream of chicken soup as I had run out of the mushroom. We also had to sub mexican blend for the cheddar and topped with crushed veggie crackers with the dill and butter. I will try this with all the recipe ingredients next time i was not prepared this time. Thanks for posting such a quick and easy recipe that can be done at the last minute on a work night.

Yummy and fast.  I made a few tweaks based on what was in the cabinet but overall good. I added a can of pink salmon just to get rid of it. Substituted Vegenaise and daiya cheese then the whole wheat hamburger bun.

I loved it, be sure to keep a super careful eye on it though! At two minutes it looked lie my cheese wasn't fully melted, then at 3 it had little tiny burnt bubbles. Still delicious though! Definitely trying it again :)

Very easy and very good.  The tuna salad itself needs some embellishment (mayo, salt and celery just don't quite get it done), but with some garlic powder, Worcestershire,spicy mustard and onion powder it makes for a fantastic quick meal.

This was really good, but neither my hubby or I thought the tuna filling was hot enough.  After broiling, we put it in the microwave for about 30 second to heat it up.  Other than that, quite tasty.  My picky husband (who ALWAYS turns up his nose at tuna) ate it all.  I'm going to experiment with turkey and bacon, still using the English muffin, tomato and melted cheese.

Really good, especially considering I'm not a big tuna fan. The only changes I made were to add a little red onion and black pepper, and I used mozzarella instead of cheddar.

Classic tuna melt in every diner.  I wouldn't say it's a quick snack but more of a hardy lunch = )

To make it healthier, use sold white tuna packed in water, light mayo and whole wheat english muffins.

This is exactly how we make ours except we add onion to the tuna mixture and call them 'tuna toasties'. We have been making, eating and enjoying these for YEARS. They are a great for something different from the usual tuna sanwich. We usually pair ours with mac and cheese~YUM! :)

VERY GOOD! Didn't use English Muffins, but it was great with Oatnut Bread. Even picky 7 year old LOVED it.

Very easy, yummy, healthy meal. I used multigrain bread and left off the tomato.  I used white albacore tuna in wather (drain all the water), and it doesn't have quite as "fishy" of a taste as dark tuna. Very good. Served with a side of mixed vegetables and strawberries for a complete meal.

I loved the ease of this meal.  Not every night has to be a big "to do" - Made a nice side salad and enjoyed a break from cooking up some elaborate, time consuming meal.  It's nice every once and a while.

I was out of tuna, so I used some cat food. I don't like mayo so I used mustard instead, it came out great.
This is a joke, why don't you stick to the recipe and rate it as is. I don't care how you people change the recipe and than rate it

They were really good. Watch the amount of mayo though, you may think it'll be drier right up until you broil it with the tomato. That thing seems to add a lot of moisture (which will squirt everywhere). Id add a bit more celery next time, but thats all personal taste

I always like to turn to quick and easy dinners on a busy night. My burger buns worked well for this since I didn't have English muffins on hand. We like chopped up pickles with our tuna so I tossed them in instead of the celery for a little extra boost of flavor. My buns were turning golden brown under the broiler in two minutes before my white cheddar cheese got a chance to bubble up so I pulled them out  before they burned. This definitely was a simple and quick meal.

I substituted the canned tuna with fresh grilled tuna, added celery/onions and mayo, spiced tuna prior to grilling for flavor. Then used Gruyere cheese instead of the cheddar . With a fresh salad this was a complete light meal - YUM.

Super fast and delicious. The only change I made was to use garlic salt instead of regular. We gobbled these up EMBARASSINGLY quickly.

I make a lower-calorie, mayo-less version of this (I hate hot/warm mayo in all forms) flavoring up the drained tuna mixture instead with red wine vinegar, olive oil, roasted red tomatoes, chopped red onions, and capers or olive tapenade from TJ's if I have either on hand (and I drop the celery). It's a great lunch.

I used everything bagels instead of English muffins. Finely shredded Colby jack cheese instead of cheddar. I liked the simple tuna recipe with the flavorful bagel. I just made the tuna with dill, chopped celery, mayo, seasoned salt, cracked pepper, and a little yellow mustard. Served with tomato basil soup. The tomatoes on the melt definitely add a little something!

Fantastic! I did change a few things. I added onion instead of celery. Also added a dab of red wine vinegar, curry and italian seasoning for flavor (I'm big on seasonings). I didn't have any tomatoes but I will definitely try them next time. And instead of cheddar, I added some shredded gruyere. Lightly buttered the english muffins so they weren't dry. 3 minutes was perfect - NO LONGER! Even my 5 year old loved it!

I made these for a quick, healthy dinner after an expecially busy day.  They were delicious!  I used a larger can of white tuna in water, reduced fat mayo, garlic salt, pepper, a small glob of sweet relish, and baked mac-n-cheese on the side.  My husband texted me at work 2 days later asking when I'd make them again. Thank you for the fast and easy dinner suggestion!

These were cheap, yet good. Might not use celery next time though.

I don't think it's so much any additative that makes it soggy, but the tomato.  I used a thin slice of ripe tomato on each slice (with regular bread) and hardly a teaspoon of mayo with a pinch of balsamic vinegar (my own preference); but after broiling until the cheese melted and then putting the halves together to flip and broil each side...  It's still a bit soggy, but oh so good!!   Thanks, Sal, for an awesome dinner!

Ok, so I didnt have English muffins, but I had some German Brotchen Rolls that I had made for our Oktoberfest menu, so I used those, cut in half and I topped each half with the tuna mix and moz. cheese.  My tuna, I added a German-Style Pickled Egg that we had leftover also, and a little bit of the juice.  This was good and quick.  Served it with salad and soup, leftover Beer Cheese soup of course :-)  I don't know if I will make again, but it was still good and I am glad that I tried it.  Thank you for sharing.

I substituted celery for two pinches of celery seed. One can of tuna made about 3 sliced english muffins. I also used 3 tsp of mayo and mixed in cheese; in addition to adding some on top. The tomatoes give it just the right taste. Quick, easy and taste great.

I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of adding salt.  The mixture was too dry in my opinion.  I added more mayo. and voile!  I would recommend heating up the tuna mixture first before broiling though because the tuna was still cold on the bottom.  I also butter and toast my bread first before adding the tuna.  My husband LOVED this!

Wanted something nice and light for dinner. Tried these and found them to be easy to make, flavorful and filling, (x2 muffin halves per person). Accompanied by spinach Cous-cous. Very nice.

Love it!  I grew up with the same recipe except more seasonings.  We called them Tuna Toasties.  I have not had them in years.  I made them for the first time for my family.  My daughter and husband love them and can not get enough.  My son is entering a stage where he is getting picky about what he likes so it was a big no for him after he tasted it.  Oh well 3 of us out 4 is great!!!

These were pretty good. I had to make 2 versions of them...one with chicken instead of tuna since my husband is allergic to fish. But they tasted good both ways. Very easy. Thank you.

This recipe was just OK.  It is basically a tuna sandwich with celery added + cheese melted on top.  If I were to make again, I'd use more mayo and chop the celery much smaller (to hide the crunch a little) because my kids hated the celery bits.

Tasted delicious, however the texture lacked a bit as neither the tuna or English muffin were golden/toasted on top as I prefer tuna melts. Next time I will broil the muffins and tuna first and then add the tomatoes and cheese for a few more minutes under the broiler. I also added pepperocinis on top of the tomatoes (under the cheese) and my hubby and I thought it added a terrific little kick!

Simple, tasty lunch.  I didn't have tomatoes on hand, but I added some lettuce after cooking and used mozzarella cheese.  The creamy and crispy really complement each other.  I can't wait till I actually have tomatoes to try it again.

YUMMY! I made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious! I added just a touch more mayo but not to much. I also left out the salt because I felt no need for it.I cooked some onions in oil before until they were soft but still crunchy. And when the sandwich came out of the broiler I topped it with the onions! IT WAS SO YUMMY! This recipe is a keeper!

Very tasty. If you're pregnant, replace the tuna with canned salmon and replace the cheddar with monterey jack. That way you get the DHA's for the baby's healthy brain development.

It is quick and easy, but it lacks any flavor other than a fishy aftertaste.  It is a good jumping off place however.

We liked these OK, they were easy and it's good quick easy nutritious food with stuff that's likely on hand.  Liked the addition of tomato.  Kids weren't too hot for it.
