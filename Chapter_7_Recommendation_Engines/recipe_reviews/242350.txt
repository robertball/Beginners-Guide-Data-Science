I made this recipe today for Father's Day.  My Dad and the rest of the family loved it!  The only reason I gave this a four star review was that directions could use some improvement and the bake time was far too long.  First I would NOT recommend stirring your raspberries.  Next time I make this, I will combine the white sugar mix first, coat the rhubarb and then add the raspberries.  Secondly, my food processor didn't do so well with the crumb mixture. Even though I cut the butter into smaller squares, I ended up with chunks of butter dusted with "dough".  Next time I will chop the nuts (I chose hazelnuts) first, cut the butter into small cubes, and then add the dry ingredients & chips.  Lastly, I skipped the 10 minutes bake step and only cooked it for 45 minutes.  The rhubarb was VERY soft.  Once it was cool enough to eat, I could no longer see any raspberries and there were only a few chunks of rhubarb.  Oven temperatures vary, so I would recommend checking the crumble so it doesn't over cook.  Overall a delicious recipe served with vanilla ice cream (just sweet enough to contrast with the tart fruit).  I especially loved the chocolate!
