We really enjoyed this! I only gave it 4 stars bc I did change it a bit. I added 3 carrots (about half a cup) which definitely improved the flavour & texture. My turnip yielded about 6 cups and the ratio between turnip, carrot & apple was well received by all, ages 1-51!

Instead of using a turnip, I wonder if you meant to use a rutabaga?  I used 1/2 a rutabaga and 3 small turnips.  They went successfully with the apples.  I didn't use the topping, I'm not that fond of that much sweetness for my vegetables.  It is what the recipe says, a turnip/apple dish!

This was my first time making turnips. I got them as part of at Misfit Markets box.  We added a little vanilla ice-cream and had it for dessert. It was pretty good and my children ate it with no complaints.

Really enjoyed this,
Got some people to try it without telling them what it is and they liked it.
Very easy to make and did not taste like turnip at all.
I used rutabaga not turnip..not sure what the difference is
Will make again for sure maybe for Christmas dinner and see if I can get a few more takers...

Waaay too low on the turnips... you need at least 3 large turnips to make two layers. Also if itâ€™s baked for an hour you only need to partially cook the turnips... came out too soupy.

It is very sweet and my turnip did not make enough to cover the dish twice, it was a small turnip I had considered using 2. But all in all not bad

This was a great side dish for turkey.  Next time, I would add a pinch of nutmeg, too.

Used this recipe because I couldn't find one for Kholerabi (I substituted for the turnip), still turned out pretty good. I also opted to not make it with the topping as well.

I added carrots and omitted the topping.  I served it with homemade turkey sausage patties, which had apples, too.  Everyone loved it.
