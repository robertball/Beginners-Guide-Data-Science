This is a nice, light and refreshing pasta. The elbows really hold up and this is very rare with gluten free pasta. I added an avocado for color.

This is a nice pasta salad but not a favorite, I would love to add more to it. I used Penne because that is what I could find but would not do it again. The penne does not hold up as well as the elbows. Gluten free pasta's are very absorbent so I would make up extra of the dressing.

I liked this. I have tried other brands of gluten free pasta and havent been a real fan of it. This tasted very similar to flour based pasta hot off the stove. I did use gluten free rotini, because I coudnt find the elbows. The shape held onto the oil dressing nicely anyway. I cooked it until the softness I like. I used safflower oil for the olive oil, as it is what I have, 2 tblsp of lemon juice and no zest, kosher salt and pepper, 1 tsp of dried oregano for the fresh, pearl sized mozzarella, 10.5 oz pack of the yellow tomatoes quartered, and a basic brown mustard without horseradish to keep it mild. This was easy to make and looked fresh. It would work well for a summer salad with other add-ins, in particularly for those that cant eat wheat products. Note, though, as another mentioned it does soak up the dressing overnight. I would consider making extra dressing if re-serving the next day as leftovers.

My husband and I really enjoyed the recipe.  I recommend using the mozzarella balls and not other kinds of cheese. The mozzarella really gives it good flavor.  I highly recommend using a small lemon, a large lemon would be too strong. The only changes I made was to not put the pasta on a baking sheet. I just put it in the mixing bowl after draining water off and rinsing it just a bit . Also I mixed the dressing in my blender. 
It would be a great dish for a potluck. The Barilla Gluten Free noodles tasted just like regular pasta and I couldn't tell the difference.

I liked this pasta salad. The taste of the Barilla Gluten Free noodles were just the same as the regular wheat noodles. The pasta didn't get mushy. I did add some cubed mild cheddar cheese,  garlic finely minced,  dried basil and a smidge of dried oregano. Next time I make  this recipe,  I might try using a red wine vinaigrette because after refrigerating the pasta salad overnight, the pasta was hard. I think it was due to using the olive oil.
