This is a classic recipe everyone will love. I make mine a little different. Instead of cream of mushroom, I use cream of chicken and instead of processed cheese I use cheddar. It's a must try that will become a tradition.

This is a fantastic recipe. Very sinful and delicious. I recommend not only following the directions but using the right ingredients. It's pretty obnoxious to give a bad review based on your own inability to follow directions.

Very good!  I gave this a 4 only because all of the cheese was a bit overwhelming.  Next time I'll either add some meat to it and make it into a main dish or scale back on the sour cream.

This was fantastic!  I used a can of Cream of Chicken & Mushroom soup, and I cooked the casserole for 6 hours on low so I could cook it overnight and have it for a breakfast potluck the next morning.  I got so many compliments on it!  Plus, it was really easy to make, which is always a plus in my book. =)

I love this recipe, but I have to omit a few things here. I don't use a slow-cooker, because I find that the "casserole" turns soupy. Instead, I bake it in a non-stick pan at 400 degrees for 45 minutes or longer. Also, I had to experiment with a few cheeses to get the right texture - less grease. What works well for me is sharp cheddar. If you still use butter, try something like I can't believe it's not butter. Less fat, still enjoyable!

Great quick receipe, however I made a few changes to make it more healthy,2 whole fresh garlic cloves, 32oz of Orta hashbrowns frozen,1 teaspoon paprika 1/2 cup of 2%milk, instead of the two cans of soup, two 6oz packages of 1. fresh graded cheeder cheese 1 mozzerela, and instead substituted mushroom soup to a homemade substitute: Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup low sodium chicken or veg broth
1/2 cup low-fat or fat free milk
salt and pepper, 1 stalk of celery or 1/2 cup of fresh mushrooms. It taste which made this dish scrumptous ! Let it sit after 5 hrs of slow cooking, then let if sit out for about an hour to firm up and served.

I don't like onions cooked or raw, so instead of sour cream and onion, I use french onion dip. You get the creamy onion taste, without the the tears of chopped onion.

Awesome recipe! I made a double batch in a 7 qt slow cooker with great success. I used the suggested cooking times (1.5 hours on high and 2.5 hours on low), giving the casserole a good stir when I turned down the temperature and then again at serving time. Note: Thawing the potatoes is crucial! I tried a this a few years ago starting with frozen potatoes, and they were still partially frozen after 3 hours on high. This time, I thawed the potatoes first (almost 24 hours in the fridge), and they were piping hot and ready to eat right on schedule.

This was good and very fast and easy to put together, but my crock pot dried it out quite a bit - I wonder what I might be able to add to it to make it moister?

I have made this for work potlucks and it's always one of the first things to go. As is, the recipe is great, but I did make some changes the last few times - I added some Mrs. Dash seasoning (to taste) to add an extra kick to it and use Cream of Chicken soup instead of Cream of Mushroom.

I gave this a three, because everyone in my family that ate this wasnt really impresssed. I gave the recipe and ingredients to my dad to make and I guess he didnt read the part about thawing the potatoes first. They turned out kind of crunchy. We also used the square hashbrowns instead of the string kind. Those would have probably been better. We were also unsure what the recipe meant by shredded processed cheese. We had colby jack shredded cheese on had so we used that. There wasnt much of a sauce for the potatoes. It was kind of a lumpy sour cream mixture stuck to potatoes. It also tasted very greasey, probably from the cheese. Maybe adding a half a cup of milk to the soup to dilute it would help. Will try again with different cheese.

Super easy to make.  I used refrigerated hash brown potatoes (40 oz total) because I was worried about getting it done in time for a potluck.  I used 1 cup shredded cheddar and 1 cup velveeta and added 1 cup chopped ham mostly to add the salty flavor.  My family loved it - not too watery and not dried out - just perfect for a picnic.  I chose 4 stores only because it must have a LOT of calories so would not make it a weekly staple, but a fun treat for a special occasion.

3.5 Stars: Following reviews, I used French onion dip which worked great.  I used the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and that seemed to mess it up. I will make it again because it is easy and frees up the oven, but with regular cream of mushroom. I used cubed hash browns because it did not specify which kind. It was ready in 6 hours on low.

Used colby jack cheese instead of cheddar.. Cooked on low for 6 hours and kept warm until served. It was perfect.  I like the fact that this recipe doesn't have the large amount of butter as some copykat hash brown casseroles I have tried in the past.

I love the baked version but wanted to make it in a crock pot for a larger crowd so did the same thing. Since I'm vegetarian, gluten free and like to experiment I made a few changes. I used gluten free cream of mushroom soup. I sauteed up some chopped onions and mushrooms first. I used fat free plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream - more protein! Then I just mixed it all together. Once I was ready to put it into the crock pot I layered it with crushed potato chips. Lots of great comments about it and a few folks have asked for the recipe.  Definitely making it again and again!

I ended up making this for a potluck at work. I added cheddar and omitted the onions. Cooked on low for 6 hours created the most yummy brunch item! It was gone in just an hour or so. Definitely a recipe I will be keeping on file.

I made this with cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup to amp up the flavor based on other reviews.  I omitted the onion and used Yoder's french onion dip instead of sour cream.  Fantastic and everyone loved it.

This recipe is so nice to take to people houses for a group gathering such as the Fourth of July or Easter. I have been making these potatoes for years now and I still always get a request from somebody to bring them along to the gatherings!

We didn't enjoy this at all. The onion was crunchy even after 4 hours in the crockpot and it was all REALLY dry. The only chage I made  at first was using real cheese instead of processed.  In an attempt to make it better after cooking I added some milk and a cup of cream cheese. That was better but still not great or even really good.

I rated this recipe with four stars because it was really good.  Although I did enjoy it, I think next time I'll add less sour cream as it seemed to overpower most of the other ingredients.  Maybe in place of one cup of sour cream I'll add one can of cream of chicken soup.  Taking the advice from previous reviews I used shredded cheddar because I absolutely despise processed cheese of any kind.  This was good advice!  Thanks to all of you that recommended that change.

This was an excellent recipe except I didn't have the mushroom soup.  However, I made a couple of minor changes.  I added a 1/2 cup of chicken stock, 1/2 cup of grated carrots, freshly grated potatoes and a little parsley.  I think for me the sour cream is key.  The next morning I was wondering what to have for breakfast and I decided to use the leftovers to make potato pancakes.  Just add 1/2 cup of flour and 1 teaspoon of baking powder per 2 cups of leftovers so they will stick together.  Heat up a frying pan with oil in it and drop spoonfuls of the mixure in.  Cook until brown and crispy.  Blot excess oil with a paper towel.  Top with a dollop of sour cream or applesauce.  Wonderful!

Not having time to use the slow cooker, I baked it in  a 9x13 pan at 400 degrees for about an hour like one of the other reviewers suggested and added a little garlic powder...just because my husband and I love garlic.....it was delicious!  Thank you for submitting!  I am sure it is just as good as written!

I am on the fence about this recipe.  It sounded great...just the warm comfort food I wanted for brunch the next morning.  (I prepared it with frozen hashbrowns and let it sit overnight.)  I added a TABLESPOON of red pepper flakes and upped the pepper (freshly ground of course) to 1 teaspoon.  I sampled it before putting it in the fridge for the night and found it bland--so I added three generous dashes of hot pepper sauce.  When I finally tried it the next day after it was cooked I thought it was alright.  My husband said it was good but nothing spectacular (like I usually cook, he added, ha ha!)  Definitely has potential for breakfast with the addition of crispy bacon and maybe scrambled eggs too (or served along side), added near the end of the cooking time.  Perhaps even a side dish with a meaty dinner with some diced red or green peppers.  Would have been very boring without the spice additions.

Mmmm, crock pot Funeral Potatoes!  How can you go wrong?  We omit the onion when I make these, as my husband isn't a big onion fan, but other than that we follow the recipe as written.  Sinfully delicious!  Since there's just the two of us, one batch makes a lot of leftovers, but these re-heat really well in the microwave.

I have made this recipe for big parties a number of times and it is always a huge hit!!  I usually leave out the onions since kids are eating but it still tastes amazing!  I just use Velveeta but usually do about 3 cups just because we like cheese and it come out great.  Otherwise, do it as is and typically double and triple the recipe and then just divide into two crockpots, cooking time is pretty accurate although I have cooked it much longer on low and it is fine.  Just have to keep stirring so it doesn't burn!  I would HIGHLY recommend using the crockpot liners for this dish though, cleanup is a breeze.  I have done before without and pots usually have to soak a while!  I have passed out the recipe numerous times as well.

This was easy and very tasty.  We have a new favorite comfort food in this dish.  I used cream of chicken soup with herbs instead of cream of mushroom just because my family doesn't like mushroom, and cut the recipe basically in half as well.  Delicious!

Tried first without making adjustments and it just tasted bland with a lot of tang from the sour cream.  Couldn't stand it. Decided to modify it and I used only one cup sour cream, two 10 oz cans cream of chicken, 8 oz shredded sharp cheddar, 30 oz bag thawed hashbrowns, full white onion that was precooked in a pan with a little butter, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Now that's how it's supposed to taste. Everyone raved about it at our morning potluck and it was the first thing gone. I did an hour and a half on high, and three hours on low. Came out perfect consistency.

We made this for a Cub Scout pitch-in and it was a HUGE hit!  I made the recipe *exactly* as instructed and it was perfect.  Admittedly it didn't look done (not golden brown, like from the oven), but it was... and it was tasty!

Made it pretty close to as described in the recipe. I mixed the base ingredients ahead of time and spread in a pan and covered with foil. Stuck it in the fridge for a few hours which helped the potatoes thaw. I topped it with corn flakes and drizzled melted butter on top. I think I'll try crushed Ritz crackers next time. This was a hit at Easter. Not a drop left.

This was a huge hit in my house.  I followed the recipe to the T, with the exception of the canned mushroom soup because I have a msg allergy.  I made my own home made mushroom soup.  Other than that it was amazing, I have made it a few times.

I needed something I could cook over night and take to work very early in the morning.  I doubled the recipe and slow cooked on low overnight for 8 hours.   I made a cornflake topping (3 cups crushed cornflakes and 1/4 cup butter, combined and toasted in oven till cruncy) and once at work and before we all dug in, I sprinkled the cornflakes over the top.  At work I plugged the crockpot in and set to warm.  It was a huge success and was already requested for our next brunch!

I've made this a couple of times for potlucks, and it's a huge hit.  I use Cream of Onion soup since I thought it was a bit bland with just the mushroom.  Since I wanted to cook overnight, I don't thaw the frozen potatoes and set on low for 8 hours with no issues.  I do prefer to make it with the Simply Potatoes refrigerated hash browns as they seem to hold their texture a bit better.   (The frozen final product is a bit mushier than if I use the Simply Potatoes brand.)  I just used shredded, bagged cheddar cheese and it comes together fine--I wasn't exactly sure what processed cheese meant either.

Was very popular at a birthday brunch!  Used grated cheddar & parmesan  cheese.  Also substituted cream of mushroom  soup with cream of chicken soup.  Doubled the recipe & there was only about a cup leftover when brunch ended. It's a great recipe for potlucks also.

Ive made this many times now.  I double the recipe and use a large cooker.  I always sell out of it at the breakfast i serve.  I use cream of mushroom soup, and use the cubed hash browns instead of the shredded, to give it more texture because I often have to let it cook longer than the recipe, overnight at low.  The problem with cooking this long, is that you have to get up and stir the crock to keep it from burning the edges at the bottom of the pot,  and to cook the inside ingredients well.   If you do it as the recipe calls for, with one recipe instead of doubling, it's probably fine-  I'm just mentioning it for those who want to do more at once!  The flavor is yummy!   Don't over cook though, to where the potatoes taste funny.  You must watch the crock if you do what I do, kind of defeats the purpose of a slow cooker but I do it so I don't have to heat my oven and the whole house-- and make two-three casseroles!  Stir it every hour or two and it will be great.

Saw this recipe and had to try it! I make the same casserole baked in the oven. Thought this would be even easier since I can have it cooking while I'm at work and be ready when I get home.  Taste exactly the same (except I put crushed corn flakes drizzled in butter on my baked casserole) this is worth the try! Two thumbs up!

This is a great recipe as it is. However I added some Garlic Powder to taste, dried dill and oregano. It was absolutely amazing... You can also bake this dish at 350 degrees F for 1 1/2 hours.

Made for christmas, everyone loved it. Used 1 cup mild cheddar and 1 cup sharp cheddar. Make sure you stir every fifteen minutes to prevent burning. Add smoked ham for a complete meal.

Didn't firm up quite like the oven baked version, but still very tasty! I added 1 lb of cooked diced chicken to make it a whole meal.

This is super simple and delicious. The second time I made it I cooked the onion first since they weren't as done as they should be after crockpot cooking. I also switched to shredded cheddar cheese. Great fix it and leave it side dish!

I used broccoli cheese soup.  I also only had 1.5 cups sour cream so that was all I used.  After reading the reviews about how bland it was, I tasted it when it was halfway cooked and realized I thought it was bland too.  I added 1/2 cup white zinfandel, some poultry seasoning, parsley, paprika, and some chicken boullion.  That made it more flavorful.

I was looking for something simple with just a few ingredients for breakfast and I found this recipe. It's so easy to put together and it's absolutely delicious. I'm making it a second time today and I added bacon bits for a more hearty flavor. I set my timer for 1.5 hours and gave it a good stir, then again after an hour. I would be hesitant to leave this overnight, even a the low setting, because there is no sure way to determine when it's done except by the melted cheese. It won't be crunchy because it's in the slow cooker. It's delicious!

I wanted it to be a complete meal so I browned a lb of ground chuck in a skillet and added an envelope of Hot Taco seasoning to it.  I added this to the potato mix before putting it in the slow cooker.  I also added minced garlic to the recipe.  Same cooking time and it was DELICIOUS!! My son LOVED it too and we ate it till it was all gone.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

The ingredients looked great but the dish was unappetizing possibly because I added a cup of sliced mushrooms. My wife wouldn’t eat it, so  with the remainder I added an egg, sliced green onions and Worcester sauce to give it more flavor and formed patties for frying. This was a lot better but I  won’t make it again

Super easy and why fuss on a hot summer night? I mixed it all together the night before - without onions because I was in a hurry. Also cut sour cream in half to help prevent the 'soupy' factor, which worked - it wasn't watery at all. Turned on the crock pot time the next morning for 4 hours on low and it switched to warm for the rest of the day. There was some over-cooked on edges, but not much - and my 20-year-old son ate about HALF of it before I got home. Definitely will double recipe next time. Nothing fancy here, but very appreciated by my house of  hungry men.

Amazing! Wasn't sure if they were going to be soupy, but worked out wonderful. I used garlic salt in place  of salt and only used 1cup of sour cream, and about 1/4 cup of milk just for consistency. Will definitely make again.  Thx for the receipe

Ok, so the whole point of this is the slow cooker idea, but I prefer to bake it in a casserole dish and top it with crushed cornflakes because I like a little crunch. Also, for the hash browns I used the obrien potatoes to add a little zip with peppers and onions. Overall, this is a really easy recipe that everyone loves. It just isn't a holiday in my house without these!

I have had this recipe for years. I have baked it, microwaved it and slow cooked it. Slow cooking is my favorite way to cook it. We always use cream of chicken soup though (not everyone likes mushrooms; even tiny bits). We use medium or sharp cheddar cheese. Sometimes I add ham or bacon to it. It is always a favorite at our get togethers.

Used dehydrated onion flakes. Added 1 teaspoon garlic powder. Changed to cream of chicken soup. Increased shredded frozen hash browns to 3 lbs (Costco sized bag). Mixed night before. Baked in 400 degree oven for 1 hour instead.
Crowd pleaser and very easy.

i made this..and love it but tweaked a little..i cooked some ground turkey to make it a meal and served with a side salad. I also omitted the cream of mushroom soup and used Cheddar Cheese soup....got the cheddar cheese, and the soup consistency in one fell swoop. seasoned with black pepper....delicious!

I doubled this recipe for my kids birthday party, and my family loved it.   I had to cook a little longer.    I had lots of leftovers, which was great for the family.
