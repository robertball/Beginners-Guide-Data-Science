A far cry from Mexican tamales but a fantastic one-dish family meal. For the meat mixture, closely followed the recipe other than omitting the olive oil and using Taco Seasoning I from this site rather than store bought. Elected to use the HERDEZ® Mexican Cornbread recipe from this site since the Krusteaz® Honey Corn Bread Mix suggested by the recipe submitter was not available at local grocery stores and we prefer cornbread made from scratch. However, if the Krusteaz® brand is locally available, it’s probably a good choice as there are 20 reviews on Amazon.com as of this date, and all are 5* rated. The HERDEZ® cornbread perfectly complimented the meat mixture. When making this again, I would only use 1/2 - 2/3 of the HERDEZ® cornbread mixture for this pie as the full amount makes a top layer of cornbread that is somewhat thick relative to the meat mixture. The remaining cornbread batter would be baked in a separate dish alongside the tamale casserole dish, and then frozen for future use. After 20 years of tinkering with this recipe, bcummings221, it’s time for you take a victory lap as it’s as close to perfect as it can practically get . . . thank you for sharing!

Well, today's the last day before I break down my kitchen & pack it for my move to Chesapeake Beach, Md.  Having lived in Arizona for the last 6 years, what a culture shock THAT will be  !!!

So, I looked at my poor dwindled cupboards & said hmmm, I wonder what I can scrounge up.  Small amount of taco seasoning - A/R recipe, salsa & canned chillies, corn, olives, corn meal, pkg. bread sticks, can of tuna, some grated Cheddar, spices, an onion, and a few others that said "childhood favorite - Tamale Pie!!!  A/R recipe says "Sweet Tamale pie" & I was in business!!!  

SO, here I sit, replete, (I can't believe I ate the whole thing!), having enjoyed the INCREDIBLE dinner this was!!  The recipe didn't call for olives, like my Mother used to do, & since they weren't on the recipe, I didn't add them in.  Next time I will, but when I intend to review a recipe, I try to be a purist the first go around.  However, if they weren't a "part of the memory" addition, I wouldn't bother!  Very few times in my experience, is a recipe exactly like I love it, & totally without need for changes, but THIS one IS!!!

VERY nice work "bcummings221"!!!!!!  And, thanks for sharing!

I made this using a can of Rotel mild tomatoes, one jar of my homemade salsa, a can of corn and a couple of tablespoons of my taco seasoning mix.  I used some green onions in the cornbread topping and no cheese.  I thought it was wonderful.

Love the taste of this tamale pie! Best one yet. It's a keeper! However, I found it took much longer than 15 min. to pull it together. Chopping, adding multiple ingredients, and making the cornbread topping were quite a few steps. Worth it for end result, but wouldn't call it quick to make.

We loved this recipe! Only thing I would change is I used a medium salsa and it was a bit spicy for my taste (I'm a sissy). Next time I will use mild. But the taste was exactly what I was looking for. I can't wait to make this for the next family gathering !

Fantastic! I took a a chance on this recipe because it was not widely rated, but the result is very flavorful and appealing to a crowd. I did replace the hot salsa with chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce because I like the deep flavor it gives beef recipes. And my tomato and corn products were not "Mexican" flavored, just tomatoes and corn. As always in our family, I used for the beef: elk, venison, or extra lean free range beef. I doubled the recipe and froze one (cooked) for later, but I didn't entirely double the cornbread portion so the meat to bread ratio was more to our liking. This is my first tamale pie attempt and this will be my recipe for the future!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it!  When it was done baking, I pulled it out of the oven and added French fried onions and a layer of the shredded cheese on top, then popped it back in the oven until the cheese melted.  YUM!  THANKS!

This is excellent and the men in my house love it.  I modified the recipe to omit the cheese because we do not have cheese lovers in our house!  It was great and the leftovers are even better!

What a wonderful, flavorful casserole dish!  The green peppers and corn, along with cheese in the cornbread topping were an excellent addition that we really liked.  I used ground chicken because we use it more often than beef.  I also used my taco seasoning (made by a recipe on this site) and added one chipolte pepper that I had in the freezer to the meat mixture, along with the rest of the recipe because we like it a little more spicy.   I served this on a bed of lettuce, with sliced avocado and tomato.  I also put a dollop of sour cream on top of each piece and sprinkled green onion and fresh cilantro.  Thanks for a great casserole.  This will be a regular for us.

This is delicious! The only change I made was I used a 16oz jar of mild salsa instead of hot tomato sauce and salsa because I wanted my 16mo old daughter to be able to eat it, too. We all loved it!

I made my own cornbread topping, using Paula Dean's recipe and set it to the side, then followed the instructions.  However, I don't care for canned corn, so I used ftozen. it was delicious.

Good base recipe.  I added a can of kidney beans to stretch the meat, jazzed it up with smoky pasilla sauce, and ditched the sugary, boxed cornbread mix for cornbread made out of corn meal (easy).

I made this to the recipe, no changes.  Love it!  Hubby happy too!   Will be great when the weather is colder.    Used the Krusteaz brand Honey Cornbread as suggested (I usually make my own)  The sweetness counters the picante well.  Will continue using this recipe.

This sure was a blast from the past for me. I made this a lot when I had kids at home and a full time job. I always follwed the recipe that is on the CORNMEAL box and it was good, but NOT THIS GOOD!! I agree with the person who stated that she felt the ratio of cornbread mix to meat was off. I ofcourse, put it all in anyway but it still was great. I too use my own blend of taco seasoning and I think that really helped. I am keeping this recipe FOREVER, and will pass it to as many friends and family as I can. Thanks for sharing with us ! ??

We are vegetarians, and used Morningstar crumbles and no cheese.  It was very good.  My meat eating guests really enjoyed it.
I also switched out the canned corn in the cornbread for cooked super sweet corn found in the freezer section of the grocery store.  That gave it a fresh taste, as a guest commented

I substituted taco sauce for the hot tomato sauce and southwestern style corn for the Mexican style corn. I did also have to increase the heat and cook time to thicken the sauce before putting it in the casserole dish. My husband and toddler, who are both pretty picky eaters, loved it though.

I made it meatless & Dairy Free; used the LightLife crumbles & pinto beans in the filling.  Also omitted the corn but added diced orange bell pepper and diced green chili's.  
Topper: Also used the Daiya Jalapeno Havarti cheese in the cornbread mix, diced green chilis, diced green onion, chopped cilantro;  Open Nature Gluten Free Cornbread Mix and Almond milk instead of regular milk. 
***** DELISH!!  *****

This recipe is easy to adapt a leftover chili to. Simply layer your chili on the bottom, add whatever appeals to you, and layer your favorite cornbread recipe over the top! If using a cornbread recipe from scratch, you probably won’t be able to use the whole recipe. However, you can just bake up the reserved batter in muffin tins :)

I prepared this exactly as instructed, with the exception of the fact that I accidentally dumped all the corn into the meat mixture instead of saving some for the cornbread topping.  This change probably modified the texture a little, but not the flavor, so I feel safe to rate it "as is."

I liked this dish well enough that I plan to finish all the leftovers, but it's otherwise a little disappointing.  There is a pretty thin layer of meat mixture under all the cornbread, and the cornbread itself tastes pretty generic despite being doctored up.  I don't begrudge extra calories in recipes if the flavor justifies them, but I just don't think the cheese in the cornbread added anything but calories in this case.  Also, the entire recipe was just too sweet between the cornbread and all the corn.  I would have preferred more spice or contrast in flavors.  So yes, I will finish it up, but probably won't bother to make again without a lot of modifications.

This recipe turned out great!! I used rotel mild instead of green chiles and I used 1 whole kernel and one creamed can of corn in the cornbread mixture. I put all the savory ingredients in with the meat and left the cornbread plain and sweet! Delicious! Thanks for this recipe.

Family loved it! I made ours gluten free since my wife has Celiac disease, only setback I had was not having a 10x14 baking dish...9x13 allowed it to bubble over during baking

Followed the original recipe and it was awesome! I took it to a pot luck dinner and it got rave reviews from both adults and kids. It's easy, quick, and delicious!

Wonderful! I had to make changes based on what my family will eat. I won't bore anyone with the substitutions, but had to keep the spiciness at a minimum, and I don't buy mixes, so I used my homemade buttermilk cornbread recipe. All three generations loved it! Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I got a bag of frozen seasoned corn with red peppers and decided to make tamale pie. I used homemade salsa and omitted the  peppers. very good. I was confused because the directions say to put all the corn in the meat, then all the corn in the bread. I layered the corn between the meat and bread. but I think any way would work.

I made this last night for New Year's Eve and it is delicious. After reading all the great reviews I decided to give it a try.  It is going to be my go to recipe for pot lucks from now on.  Yummy!
