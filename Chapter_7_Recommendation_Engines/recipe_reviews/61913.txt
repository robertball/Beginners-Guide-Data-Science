I used this recipe as a base for creating a great tasting egg roll.  I omitted the following: bamboo shoots, pork, MSG.  I used 8oz. fresh white button mushrooms, chopped, in place of the wood ear mushrooms.  I threw some shredded, cooked chicken in half the egg rolls.  I didn't refrigerate the cabbage mixture until cold (didn't leave myself enough time for this step.)  I used an ice cream scoop to put a small pile on each egg roll wrapper and then wrapped and fried as directed.  These had a great flavor - my husband said they were better than he's had in a Chinese restaurant and our 2 1/2 year old son loved them too.  We could have eaten the whole batch (it made about 18 egg rolls,) but we showed some restraint and I froze the rest.  They re-heat great in the oven (still crisp!)

Excellent recipe. It's a snap to make with these simple modifications.  In place of the cabbage and carrot chopping ordeal, I bought a bag of slaw that was already chopped and contained cabbage and carrot.  I also opted out the pork and replaced it with a 1lb bag of cooked and cleaned small shrimp, so I just added it. With everything at hand it only took the few short minutes to stir fry it all up and stick it in the frig. When I was ready to roll them up I was suprised at how quick and easy that was. While they were frying I made won ton soup to go with them  The recipe made 13 perfect egg rolls.  My family loved them And I will definately make them again. It was a quick and easy recipe., Thanks.

I'd give these 10 stars if I could!  I had to make some changes based on what I had on hand (no time for a trip to the store!) and they were still excellent!  My changes: ground pork for matchstick cut BBQ pork, fresh bean sprouts for cabbage (about 3/4s were added and cooked, the other 1/4 were added at the last minute for more crunch).  I was making potstickers for this meal, too... they had cabbage and pork... and I needed to use the bean sprouts.  These were better than any I have ever purchased!  And I do have a jar of MSG, so added that, as well.  (My only editorial comment is that SOME people need to get over the "authentic" part because MSG is not 300 years old!  Family recipes are adapted over time and MSG is a good addition.  We should just be glad that the recipe was shared with us!!)  My husband loves potstickers but these are MUCH quicker and easier to make, so I fill him up with these and make potstickers as a side dish!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!  IT IS WONDERFUL!!

Wonderful!  I didn't really use oil, just cooking spray.  I omitted the MSG, and I actually "fried" the eggrolls in the cooking spray to brown, then put them in the oven at 425 for a few minutes.  They were crispy & yummy.  Didn't look as pretty as fried, but much healthier.  I also only used egg whites & used the Chinese Pork Tenderloin from this site for the pork & sweet & sour sauce from here as well, but they really didn't need the sauce.  A+ & very healthy with slight modifications.  Thank you for sharing!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!  I used the "Chinese Pork Tenderloin" recipe also available on this website for the Chinese barbequed pork.  I used a whole carrot and eliminated the mushrooms (not a big fan).  I will never try another egg roll recipe.  These were great!  Thank you for the recipe!

These eggrolls are incredible!  Because I don't eat pork, I used about 1/2 lb. chopped shrimp.  I had sliced roast beef from the deli in my fridge, I sliced about 1/2 pound thin and put that in also along with 2 big garlic cloves.  Lastly, I also used about 1 tablespoon of sweet soy sauce.  The cool thing was when I first laid it the pan to cool it was full of water from the cabbage.  I said "Oh I can drain that later", 2 hours later when I wanted to roll them, the water had be reabsorbed by the cabbage!  Usually I drain that water and drain all the flavor along with it!  Great idea!  Thank you for your family recipe, I will pass it along to my children as well!

These were great! The whole batch just disappeared.
I made a few changes to use what was on hand at the time and found them to be more like the rolls that my favorite restaurant in Chicago made. I substituted bean sprouts for bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms and used hoisin sauce on the pork as it cooked, left out the MSG too. OMG!!! I may put the ole deepfryer to use more often now.
Thanks a ton!

OMG! These are soooo good! My husband came running in from outside and devoured 4 at once.  I altered only a few things because of allergies.  First I omitted the MSG and replaced tofu (that I seasoned) for the bbq pork.  Nobody could tell the difference!  My family is already asking me when I'll be making these again.  Thanks for an authentic tasting egg roll!

excellent recipe. These turned out great. I cheated and used the pre-cut cole slaw mix, but otherwise very good. I spiced mine a little with some ginger and garlic. If you don't like fried egg rolls, I sprayed mine with cooking spray and baked at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. My husband said they taste great and he doesn't miss the fried.

These were pretty good.  The filling was a little bland so before filling them I added a little bit of powdered ginger.  That helped a lot.  We fried half of them and baked half of them sprayed with PAM.  The fried ones were better and had the restaurant-style texture.  The baked ones were good too just a little too crispy.  However, since we are not big fans of frying food next time we will probably bake them all since they were still pretty good.  These freeze well too.  We did freeze some that were uncooked and baked them the other night.  I would recommend seperating them with parchment or wax paper before freezing otherwise they will stick together.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are so easy and excellent!  I was able to do all of the chopping & cooking and still get them on the table in 70 minutes by skipping the refrigeration step.  I had lots of leftover filling even though I used more than 3 T. per egg roll...so next time I'll buy two packages of egg roll wrappers.  Also, I fried the entire batch of egg rolls in about 1/4 inch of oil...it isn't necessary to fry them in 6 inches of oil! I just kept slowly turning them in the oil; they cook very quickly so check on them often. I used unseasoned cooked chicken breast instead of barbequed or roast pork and omitted the MSG, but added a little black pepper--the flavor turned out great.

It was our first time making egg rolls, and it worked out well.  Note for anybody trying egg rolls for the first time.  Make sure to roll them tight to prevent huge amounts of oil in the roll when you fry.  But, other than that, Great taste.

These were great, thank you for this recipe. I used ground meat instead of pork and left out the mushroom because I only had ground meat and no mushrooms. Fry in hot(not warm) oil to fry or your egg roll will be greasy.

These were great! I used a bag of shredded cabbage & carrots for coleslaw - a great shortcut. I also added some chopped shrimp during the saute process, and after I added the egg I also added fresh bean sprouts. They tasted just like the restaurant!   One caution - I rolled these and stacked on a plate and then turned my attention to my entree, and when I was ready to fry the eggrolls found that the dough of the wrappers had all stuck together. Ripped several of them trying to get them apart. Next time I will roll and place on a single layer on a baking sheet until I am ready to go!   Also, I froze the leftovers (after frying) and they heat up just terrific in a low oven.

Fantastic!  I didn't use barbequed pork (and I'm sure this would have sent it over the top), but rather, boiled some chicken breast and shredded it - as it's what I had on hand.  Next time, I'd add some hoisin sauce or some type of a smoky/bbq flavoring if using chicken.  Left out the MSG (absolutely no need for this preserving ingredient, I'd think!), AND, didn't fry them..   but rather, baked at 400 for about 15-20 minutes - until golden.  Just make sure to spray the baking sheet with oil and also to spray the tops of the eggrolls with oil.  Such an easy, healthy (when baked!), eggroll recipe!  No need for any sauce, but I bet a sweet and sour would be quite yummy. :)

These are amazing! I can honestly say I would rather make these than order out..much better. I use a bag of coleslaw in place of the cabbage and carrots and use whatever meat I have around (today I used the chicken I was putting in the chicken fried rice). I omit the MSG, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms..simply because my husband is picky and he likes the basics. This recipe can easily be altered to suit just about anyone. Definitely a keeper!

I am living in Nigeria and host quite a few luncheons for the expat wives here...finally made them "chinese food" which part of the menu were these egg rolls...and of course a new woman was "chinese"...she asked for the recipe! Everyone loved them, thank god I made 30 egg rolls because everyone went back for seconds and thirds! Only thing I didn't use was the MSG...by the way, I am Korean American and this is an awesome recipe!

These being my first ever homemade egg rolls, I think they turned out great. I didn't have bamboo shoots, used bean sprouts instead. I also had fresh button mushrooms. By the time everything was ready to refrigerate I realized I forgot to shred my pork so I opened a can of precooked chicken and put that in instead. I added about 3 Tbsp. of Oyster sauce to the mix. The egg rolls were easy to assemble (my 8 year old helped me with everything). We only made half the batch. I planned on assembling the rest and freezing them the following day. If I could give just one tip...whatever type of tray or pan you have your cabbage mixture in, you need to prop it up on one end so all the oil/juice runs out. Otherwise the egg rolls are a bit soggy inside. I placed my leftover mix in a ziplock bag. So I'll be cutting the corner off and letting all the juice run out before making the rest of the egg rolls. Thanks so much for this recipe...it was a success for me!

This is the closest recipe to the one my Vietnamese mother in law has been making for fifty years.  She even admitted that the egg is her secret ingredient but that she just scrambles the one egg she uses instead of three into the entire egg roll mixture instead of making the 'pancake' and cutting it up.  Also, it's important to remove the stems from the mushrooms after rehydrating them as they are very hard to get soft enough and stay very woody. We also give everything a fine chop not just julienned, carrots shredded.  When sealing the rolls, we usually just use cornstarch and water but the egg white worked well.  We also use peanut oil for frying so I recommend that if allergies aren't an issue. These egg rolls were full of flavor and the only suggestion to the seasoning is a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar and a teaspoon of sesame oil in place of one teaspoon of soy sauce.  Strain the oil and store in the fridge and it can be reused for the same purpose several times.

I just made these for a tea party, and let me tell you, I wish I had made more. I made 30 pieces and they ran out within 10 minutes!I had to omit the bamboo shoots (the store ran out) and I used some shiitake mushrooms for more flavour,but besides leaving out MSG, I followed the recipe to a T. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

It is interesting to read this recipe has been in a Chinese person's family for 300 years, when MSG was invented in 1908 in Japan by a man named Kikunae Ikeda, per many websites I found.

I made it without pork also, as did many others, and instead used tiny shrimp, I also substituted finely chopped baby bella (baby portabella) mushrooms for the others. It was really good.

The husband and I loved these! I ended up using the ground pork and omitted the mushrooms as they just gross me out. Oh...I didn't use the MSG either. I thought the flavor was great and will definitely use this recipe in the future. Next time I will try the recipe to the T as my husband DOES enjoy mushrooms as does his family. Thank you for sharing!

These were very good but I think I used too much cabbage...picked out, what looked like, a medium head but ended up with a ton of filling left over...because I had so much cabbage, the flavor, of the filling, was a bit too light. Probably should have added more soy sauce and sugar...If I make these again, I will definately use peanut oil to fry them in...all in all, a very nice recipe. Thank you.

Fantastic. Delicious. And such a fun project. I used the Chinese Pork Tenderloin recipe on this site. My husband doesn't love eggs, so we left out that part. I used the smallest cabbage I could find, 1 large carrot, and left out the mushrooms and MSG. This recipe only used 1/2 a package of wrappers, so I had to throw the rest away :( Also, the package said to use a mixture of flour & water to seal the egg rolls, so I did that instead of using the egg white. And 4 cups of oil isn't really necessary-just use enough to cook about 4 egg rolls at once. These were so tasty (especially with a homemade sweet & sour sauce on the side) and leftovers were easily re-crisped in the oven :)

Um? 300 year old MSG, huh? I doubt the authenticity of this recipe, and the results were fine. Nothing fantastic, tasted like any other egg roll I've ever had. But It definitely wasn't bad.

Made some adjustments to my desire: Did not included MSG (unhealthy), bamboo or pork. Used regular white mushrooms instead of wood ear mushroom. Added ginger, garlic, a pinch of cayenne, water chestnut, bean spouts, toasted sesame oil, and scrabbled eggs in the cabbage mixture. YUMMY!!

I left out the bamboo shoots and the mushrooms because I didn't have them but WOW are these good. I did add a pinch of ginger but wish I wouldn't have. Next time I might up the sugar a pinch. Serve with hot mustard.

I used a bag of coleslaw mix (pre shredded cabbage and pre shredded carrot mix...way easy!) and used Lowry's Seaon Salt for the MSG as it has MSG in it (then omitted the extra salt: between the season salt and the soy sauce it had plenty of sodium!)..they came out great.  With only 3 of us here to eat them I froze the extras for future easy use!

Excellent.  I used what I had in the fridge - shredded red cabbage, shredded carrots, shitake mushrooms, green onions.  No meat.  I didn't add the MSG though, as the soy sauce was salty enough.
Very easy.  I quartered the egg roll wrappers and made bite-sized appetizer egg rolls.  They were a big hit.

I thought these were great! Love the egg addition. I didn't have any pork or mushrooms. I also didn't have MSG, but I probably wouldn't have used it anyway. I replaced the items I didn't have with chicken, celery, and onion. I also put a little garlic powder in there, since other egg roll recipes were telling me to, and I thought it sounded like a good idea. You know, because garlic is awesome! (Italian chick over here who loves her garlic.... and Asian food..?)

OMG!! These were AMAZING!! I made these for company and they couldn't believe I had made them myself. It does take a lot of time and prep but it makes a lot and they freeze really well. Re-heat in the oven and just as good.

I really do feel like the party pooper here, but I didn't find this recipe to be all that flavorful.  I didn't use the mushrooms because my wife and I don't like them but I did use more green onions than called for and I used the cole slaw mix as other suggested and added some extra shredded carrots and  a little more soy sauce, but no MSG.  Maybe that was the problem.  I'm going to have to play with this because it did have potential.

This egg roll recipe is the best yet!.  We used boneless spare ribs from our local Chinese restaurant instead of roast pork, and just pulsed in the food processor to avoid too much cutting.  We also omitted the mushrooms since we didn't have them on hand, and also left out the MSG.  Other than that, we followed the recipe and directions and boy were they good!  We'll definitely be making this often!

I have made these many times but usually sub different mushrooms because I have them on hand.  Finally remembered to get the wood ear and they do make a big difference.  As others have mentioned I use "Chinese Pork Tenderloin" when I make with meat but more often than not I make these all veggie but include  the spices from the Pork Tenderloin recipe as well.  Have had people say these are the best egg rolls they have ever had.  I usually deep fry but this time I wok fried with just about an inch deep of oil, very good results.

Once a year, my brother, sister, and I get together for a reunion. Each time we have a "cooking adventure". This year we made these egg rolls. They were fantastic! We substituted fresh shiitake mushrooms because we couldn't find wood ear mushrooms, but everything else was as per the recipe. I have been looking for a recipe like this for years. We served them with duck sauce and sweet and sour sauce. When my married son found out about it, he insisted he and I get together to make a batch for him! I froze some for future dinners, and they froze very well. They didn't last long though! Thank you Mendy Ling!

Simply fantastic! Using the pre-chopped cole slaw from the salad aisle cut down on prep time. I served with duck sauce for dipping. These freeze well cooked, but get goopy in the fridge uncooked after a day - whoops!

The only thing I omitted was the mushrooms (and msg, but that's just unnecessary), and the only thing I replaced was shrimp for pork.  Everything else was followed to the letter.  The filling smelled terrible while cooking. Once the egg rolls were done we tried them, and they tasted just like the filling smelled.  I ate a couple drowned in different sauces and they were tolerable, but the rest of the family went out and got subs.  Sorry.  The weird thing is that there is not a single ingredient that I dislike in this recipe.

I had a good size cooked pork steak left over from last night, and cut it into matchsticks for this recipe.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  This is a delicious recipe with all the tastes and texture we want in a good egg roll.  I think the time the mixture sits in the fridge to cool, really helps to meld those favors.  We have tried many different recipes over the years, but this is the keeper now!  It's very good!!  Thanks so much for posting a family recipe, and allowing us to enjoy it. :)

The recipe was strictly average, as tasty as spring rolls typically are but nothing out of the ordinary. As for the person who questions the presence of MSG in a 300 year old recipe, you're right... mostly. Crystalline MSG was not invented until the early 20th century, when a Japanese researcher isolated it from konbu seaweed, but the compound is nothing but the sodium salt of glutamate, one of the most common naturally-occurring amino acids (sorry about the chemistry lecture). Soy, tomatoes, seaweed, and many other foods are rich in glutamates, too. So yes, you are right. Ms. Ling's ancestors did not whip out the Accent to make spring rolls, but the salt may have been a stand-in or substitute for another glutamate-containing ingredient. It's as anachronistic as using powdered citric acid as a substitute for lemon juice. I have a harder time believing that a person who lived 300 years ago would have used that much oil (a very, very expensive ingredient) to fry up something to go with tea.

THESE ARE WONDERFUL!!!!  I was short on time so I had to make some adjustments, and it still turned out very good.  First I didn't have the meat called for in the recipe.  In the other reviews I saw several who used the Chinese Pork Tenderloin recipe.  I didn't have time to cook a tenderloin so I took the ingredients from the Chinese Pork Tenderloin recipe and added them to raw sausage that I browned.  Mmmmm...  I also didn't have any msg.  Other than those two changes I made the recipe as written.  It won rave reviews by everyone.  Will definately make these again!

I make these often, for years.easier way is to use a package of shredded cole slaw... don't cook the slaw,mix your meat (i like crumbled sausage,shredded bake chicken breast& sometimes chopped shrimp),in the slaw. roll&cook. the slaw will cook when you cook the egg roll and they are crispy but not raw. Not as much work either.

Very, very good. Only thing is that I needed to packages of wrappers- which is great since my family ate them so fast!

I used a pre-cut cold slaw bag of cabbage & carrots and used ground chix thighs instead of pork.  Rolled them all then kept them warm after frying in the oven at 250* while cooking other things.  They stayed crisp.  These take a lot of time but they are worth it!

These were fantastic! I used button mushrooms instead of wood ear, Chinese cabbage, honey instead of sugar, and a ginger, garlic, red pepper spice mix instead of MSG. Will make again and again!

These were the BEST!  My family started eating them before I finished cooking them.  I didn't have BBQ pork so I subbed with a 4oz. can of tiny shrimp.  Also used a bag of slaw (cabbage, carrot, broccoli & cauliflower) and added some bean sprouts as another recipe called for.  The egg rolls were fresh and very tasty.  A little time consuming but was thinking I could keep the cabbage mixture in the fridge and fry up whatever portion I might need for a meal.  Thanks for the REAL recipe:)

I have made this recipe numerous times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly as listed. They were great. The next time I added shrimp instead of the pork and I also used regular mushrooms and seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt. They were fantastic. I usually double the recipe and freeze them, because my family will eat them alone. These are so much better than any take out egg rolls I have eaten.

A good starter recipe and method, if a bit bland.  Users who add a bit more robust ingredients will be pleased.  Variations are endless, but the basic method is First Class.  Important points are Roll and Seal with extreme care, as they need to be tight, air-free and well sealed.  Watch your oil temperature and do not over cook.  If sliced for serving, use a clean/sharp bread knife.  Also, the filling must be cool and well drained; too much moisture can explode the rolls when frying - a big mess.  Dipping sauces are endless - and optional.  I like a no-sugar hot mustard, but soy/sesame oil, thinned with broth is also good.  Cook's choice.  Again, this recipe is a great place to begin your own...

Alterations: cole slaw mix, matchstick carrots, low sodium soy-sauce, sliced Shitake mushrooms. Only used above ingredients with BBQ Pork, scallions, salt, sugar, and egg white for sealing egg rolls. Was only planning on cooking small amount so eyeballed amounts when I was cooking. Came out great!

My first time making eggrolls, and they turned out amazing!!! I skipped the MSG, and sub'd button mushrooms (couldnt find the wood ear), which I grated with my cheese grater (makes them the perfect size) and used bagged coleslaw mix in place of cabbage. Also grated 1 additional carrot for color and flavor. Skipped the egg inside, and didnt even miss it...These are sooo much better than chinese restaurant egg rolls by far!! Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used a bag of cabbage slaw (instead of dicing all the cabbage and it had carrots in it) and I used pickled ginger instead of fresh (because I had that handy)and it just turned out great.  A friend and I whipped this dish up and we served it with hot Chinese mustard and sweet and sour sauce and soy sauce and it was FUN to make and delicious.  One thing I could have done was cook everything until it was completely dry because the last couple of egg rolls were a bit too juicy (totally my fault, though).  I forgot to get the bamboo shoots and my husband who's only ever eaten an egg roll at a restaurant actually MISSED them. So it would have been better if I had remembered to buy those and put them in as well.  Thanks Mendy Ling!

I change this recipe a little.  I omit the pork and add chicken and/or broccoli and celery.  I never add MSG.  I have started to roll these in phyllo sheets insteas of egg roll wraps.  I bake the phyllo wraps in 400 degree oven until crisp and brown.  A little less fat and no fryer clean up.

Since I had to use ground pork for another recipe, I just used the rest in these egg rolls.  I did not use msg and used baby bella mushrooms instead of the wood ear.  The whole process took awhile, but the result was worth it.  I served them with a sweet and sour sauce  recipe from this site and they were very good.  I will use this recipe often I am sure!

These were delicious!  I used what I could find in my small town supermarket.  Cole slaw mix, fresh wild mushrooms, bean sprouts instead of bamboo, and no MSG.  We fried them in our fondue pot along with various other goodies, but these were the big hit.  Even my 2 year old ate one!  Hands down a new family favorite!  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you very much for sharing your family's 300 year-old recipe.  Our friends who are originally from Shanghai came over for dinner and we made these.  I used the 'lumpia' wrappers as we (and they) like the thin, crispy shell.  These eggrolls were absolutely delectable and the varied assortment of veggies, mushrooms with the Chinese bbq pork blended into a very tasty medley.  My daughter said they were the best eggrolls I have ever made. We served them with a blend of rice vinegar with a touch of balsalmic vinegar for dipping which are friends loved. Thanks again!

OMG, these were so good!!  I even made the BBQ pork myself to try to get the best flavour I could.  These were so good and once the prep work was done, very fast and easy to make.  They even heated up well the next day, not that there were many left over!!  for the record, I did omit the MSG though as I don't feel well sometimes after eating it. I also substituted shiitake mushrooms the for dried wood ear mushrooms as I couldn't find any in my little town!  I don't think that either of those things took away from the original recipe. Thank you, Mendy Ling, for submitting the recipe.

Wow.  Just wow.  I've been on a kick of trying recipes I never thought I would be able to do right, and this turned out incredible.  I downsized the filling to cabbage, bean sprouts, and carrot (all I had in the house), cooked and in oil and soy sauce and fried as directed.  Watch the video for making this recipe on the site -- it will INFINITELY make rolling your egg rolls (and possibly other dishes) much easier.  My local restaurants charge $6-7 for an order of 4 egg rolls ... never again will I pay that, as this recipe was just as good or better, and at a fraction of the cost.  My boyfriend and I intended to make it as an appetizer, and we just put away the entree and ate this as our whole meal.  Can't wait to try it with other variations, next time with the mushrooms and green onions in the original recipe!  Thanks Mendy!

This is an excellent recipe exactly as directed. These egg rolls were much tastier than any we have had in Asian restaurants.  I did cheat a little and used the bagged Cole slaw mix instead of bok Choy, but did not change anything else.  Will definitely keep all these ingredients on hand to make again and again!

I made these as written except omitted the MSG.  I liked the filling quite well.  However, they were just so ooo oily!  I know that frying = oil, but that said the oil was overpowering for my taste.  I drained them on paper towels but maybe just not enough?  Anyway I might try it again but bake instead.

Really good recipe.  These are very similar to the egg rolls my mom makes.  I think MSG is essential.  It balances out all the flavors.  For those who say MSG is unhealthy, get educated.  Read up on it and know that it isn't harmful.

These were by far the best egg rolls I have ever eaten!  I did as others suggested and made the Chinese Pork Tenderloin recipe from this site.  I then used the marinade that was left in the pan after cooking the tenderloin to saute the vegetables for the egg rolls (instead of adding the soy sauce, salt, sugar and MSG this recipe called for).  I also used a bag of shredded cole slaw as suggested by others.  The result was perfect.  P.S. You don't need egg white to seal the wrappers.  You can just use water.

I made these exactly as written except for MSG, and unfortunately I don't have easy access to wood ears. I used portabella cut into match sticks since I had a few on hand. Next time I make them I will add some hoisin or oyster sauce for a little additional kick. I also think allowing the cabbage mixture to rest longer will infuse it with more flavor.

Used 3 tablespoons oil, 2 carrots, 1 chicken breast, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, szechuan marinade, pepper, and 2 egg whites. No eggs, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, pork, and MSG. Might need more flavor.

These are amazing!! I left out the green onions and MSG and they were still awesome!  I fried mine in peanut oil in our deep fryer.   I must have had an enormous head of cabbage, because when I shredded 1/2 of the head that I have and mixed it with the other ingredients, I was able to make 40 egg rolls out of this recipe that says it yields 20. The second batch of 20 went into the freezer to be eaten later.

AMAZING!  These egg rolls were to die for!  I didnt have pork, so I cooked ground turkey and added some teriyaki sauce to sweeten it up.  I was impressed how good it was.  I also added fresh mushrooms that I chopped up.  This is the first time I have ever made homemade egg rolls and I will never try another recipe.  This is it!  They are very easy to make, they just require a bit of prep time.  DELICIOUS!!!

perfect.  Brought these to an all-woman get together, and they raved.  My husband, who doesn't like chinese food at all, asked me to save a couple for him.  He ended up eating more than I did.  The only thing I did differently, was I put about a half an inch of oil in a non-stick skillet and turned these to brown them, I didn't "deep-fry".  These are incredible, and better than the local restaurant fare.

these were great. I thought they would be hard. I used vegtable oil and they came out fine. I have not tasted egg rolls like these in years. The only trouble is my husband keeps asking when are you going to make egg rolls again

These were the BEST Egg Rolls.  
We have a Chinese student living with us and she said that they were as good as her mothers!! I used shimp chopped up instead of pork and regular button mushrooms, ( stems removed ). My family ate them all up.  VERY GOOD Thank you..

These were really good. I found the egg roll wrappers in the produce section. The flavor grew on me after a while. I upped the soy sauce a bit and used chopped shrimp in place of the pork. Served w/ duck sauce. :)

This recipe has become a Christmas eve tradition with our family. Mendy, your mom is a great cook! Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I think it will stay in our family for 300 years! I added some chopped shrimp and used ground pork instead of the roast. If you chop veggies and cook the filling the day before it's a bit easier. I made 80 of these and they were gone in a flash! Everyone can get involved chopping, rolling etc... I'm so glad you shared this recipe. Totally YUMMY! A bit time consuming but totally worth it!

Weather or not this is a 300 year old recipe does not matter to ME!  It is a great recipe!  The only reason I tried it was the anal retentive reviews about when msg was invented... This family recipe is great.  I live in a small town and can't find good chinese anywhere.  My wife has been craving egg rolls for a long time and now we don't have to drive to the big city to get them.  Also I did not have msg but it doesn't need it.  Could not find woodear mushrooms replaced it with straw mushrooms yum! I split the batch in half and tried some cilantro it gave it a little different flavor.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe this is a keeper!

These are fantabulous! The first thing I tried in my new wok and I'm totally amazed at the great taste!  I forgot to purchase bamboo shoots at the grocery store, left out the mushrooms (don't like them), and threw in some bean sprouts. Oh, I also used shrimp instead of pork. Thank you twice, from hubby and me for such a remarkable recipe!

These were great! I followed the recipe to the letter (well... okay, I couldn't find wood ear mushrooms, so I used shiitake I had on hand). Best to make when you have a large gathering, because if you're by yourself, you'll eat them ALL!

I made these a couple of nites ago and they were fantastic!! I made them with what I had at the time, because I was having an egg roll craving that could not wait! I didn't have the msg, or the muchrooms. I used some bead sprouts in place of mushrooms....yum!yum!!
I appreciated the simple easy directions. The egg rolls turn out so well I couldn't believe I made them. Thank your family for sharing their time tested recipe!

These are so good.  I did omit the muchrooms and bamboo shoots.  The seasoning is perfect, my husband said they were better than the ones from our favorite Chinese delivery place.  I couldn't help eating the mixture while rolling them up.

It is well enough for a Chinese American dish. I find it extremely difficult to believe it is 300 years old, as msg was not invented untill the early 1900's.

Excellent, in spite of the fact that I couldn't find wood ear mushrooms (I subbed Shiitaki), my store had no bamboo shoots and I used beef as one of my guests can't eat pork.  I also don't use MSG.
I've used different recipes over time and this is the best.  I'll be using this one again. Thank you to the recipe poster.

Fantastic recipe. 
Just Omit the MSG, it doesn't need it.
I made my own  fried pork to add to this recipe: 
ground pork, finely chopped ginger,  green onions
soy sauce, sesame seed oil, black pepper
And instead of frying the eggrolls, I use the Air Fryer... delicious!

good!!  I used coleslaw instead of cabbage, a mix of wild mushrooms since i couldn't find wood ear and I marrinated the pork roast in "Irene's Barbeque Sauce" (from this site) and baked.

This is the first time that I see bbq or roasted pork is used. I use lean grounded pork. MSG?? Really? No vermicelli noodle?

I made them for my family and they absolutely loved the egg rolls. The following day my son popped the left overs in the oven and they were as crispy as the previous day. Delicious, though I will note that I did not add mushroom because I did not have them handy and they were still awesome. We must try them with the mushrooms next time.

This is a good recipe! I didn't have some of the ingredients so I just winged it. I didn't have the bbq chicken so I just added bbq sauce to the mixture and it was good...added some flavor!  On my part the egg roll wrappers did not turn out so well. So if this is your first time with egg rolls, practice!

These were very tasty, and not too salty. My only criticism is that they are slightly bland. I added some celery and a few bean sprouts to the mixture, as well as some garlic to spruce things up a bit and add more depth to the egg rolls.

These are so easy to make! I tried a few of the others suggestions; using a bag of slaw mix instead of carrot and cabbage seperately, and i used white mushrooms (could not find the mushrooms it calls for in this tiny town). I think my fiance fried them wrong because ours were not that crispy.These are fast easy and delicious! I will use this recipe alot :)

These were good. I left out the mushrooms (I have never seen an egg roll with mushrooms in it) and the pork because I wanted them to be veggie only. We enjoyed them very much will be my go to egg roll recipe from here on out.

These turned out so good! I forgot I was eating at home. A lot of steps, but very easy. I had a hard time finding egg rolls wraps, but finally found them in the produce isle. I fixed these with a sweet and sour chicken recipe I found on this site. It was a truly authentic meal that I will no longer be paying a fortune to enjoy.

This was as authentic as I could possibly get at home.  It would probably be a good idea to make a bunch of these up and freeze them.  I have nothing negative to say about them.

this is a fantastic recipe!  I used cole slaw mix for speed and I put in bean sprouts, onions, garlic and also used lean turkey meat seasoned with garlic and onion powder. Low-Sodium Soy Sauce lightly flavored the mix. With a daughter with Kidney Disease it is hard to find good recipes.  This one is SUPER!!!!

I'm sorry, but I didn't like these egg rolls.  I think the major problem is I don't like green cabbage.  Yuck!  I left out the MSG and baked for 12 minutes per side at 425 degrees with Pam Cooking Spray.  They are crispy and lower in fat. Thanks for the recipe, but I'm in no rush to make again.

This made so much filling I had to stir fry in 2 batches! I had enough mixture for dinner plus I could have made 80 eggrolls but there were only 22 wrappers in the package I bought.  My cabbage was not at all large so next time I would use half a cabbage. I don't deep fry much so just used 2 inches of oil and that worked fine. The taste was excellent though and worth the effort.

Can be cooked in an air fryer.Brush each egg roll before cooking with cooking oil. Air fry 4 at a time at 350 for 12 minutes. They come out nice and crispy without being greasy.

I made several changes to this recipe based on the ingredients I had on hand.  The protein I used was shrimp and Andouille sausage.  Added some spices, garlic and onion powder, pepper, red pepper flakes, and cayenne pepper.  I fried them in 1/2 inch oil and turned them over until brown.  They were very good.

I made these egg rolls tonight and they were GREAT!  I didn't add bamboo shoots or mushrooms, but instead added bean sprouts and they were so yummy.  Our two kids and the husband ate all 15 that I made within the hour.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I will be making these again very soon.

I'm rating five stars because I believe this is the best base recipe I've ever used; individual preferences should not be considered, in my opinion, such as the addition or omissions of MSG, or the things I did which were to my liking. I did not use MSG, I added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce, 1/2lb of ground pork that I cooked before adding the veggies, and I used portobello mushrooms as my store had none other to choose from the day I went shopping. My 7 year old daughter helped me, & this recipe was fun & easy. My family really enjoyed the flavor, & I'll make these every time!

This recipe has a lot more meat than vegetables. I didn't use the MSG and I added a little shredded cabbage and double the green onions (I love green onions)  I'm almost finished with the egg rolls (I eat them myself) and I plan to make more

Best  egg rolls I have ever had!  I left out the msg, but everything else was about the same.  I don't really follow recipe's to a t, I use them more as a guide.  Was good later and re-heated too.

I added 2 cloves garlic, 1 tsp. ginger, 1 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. soy sauce and I would have liked to use 1 tsp. sesame oil for the eggs but my girlfriend didn't want it in there and I didn't use the MSG because she is allergic to it and its not really needed. I think I'll use shitake mushrooms next time. I would also suggest raising the temperature of the deep fryer to 375F. Oh and the filling was twice as much as I needed so I'll add another package of wrappers. I would suggest using lumpia wrappers.

I will definitely make this again. My husband said they were better than any he has ever had. Better than ones from a Chinese restaurant. He is already requesting me to make them again. The only thing I did different was add just an eighth tsp. of Chinese five spice. These are amazing.

Loved these, used minced shrimp instead of meat, and added a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh ginger.  These where so good, I'm making triple recipe and freeze for future use.  I guarantee these are better than a takeout egg roll.

we omit the meat and add our meatless substitute (crisp fried button mushrooms and onions) and do not add msg, or bamboo shoots. I add Maifun noodles to absorb extra juices and beansprouts. it takes a while to make the first time but the more often you make them the faster you'll get. They freeze very well.

I'm so glad I finally tried this recipe! I've been using a recipe that has potential, but there was always something missing. This recipe showed me the error of my ways and helped me to make a delicious egg roll. I omitted the pork, mushrooms, bamboo, and MSG, to keep it basic, but they were still a delicious side to my "Chinese" dinner theme tonight. These were paired with my homemade vegetable fried rice and the General Tsao's Chicken recipe from this site.

I have been making my own egg rolls for years but this recipe got so many great reviews I decided to try it.  I did use pork - ground some shoulder  and browned it.  I only used 1/2 pound and increased veggies using straw mushrooms, bean sprouts, coleslaw mix (cheated.  Loved the egg in the mix and did add some sesame oil.  Will make again and add some garlic and ginger.  Delicious.

Great basic recipe for eggrolls. We omitted the MSG and bamboo shoots and eggs due to allergies.  We added a teaspoon of sesame oil and some pepper the eggroll seasoning. We used three tablespoons of flour and three tablespoons of water to make a paste to seal the eggrolls instead of eggs. Had some roasted shredded pork which really made this eggroll stand out. We made all different sizes and they were all great!

I never had the courage to try making egg rolls; yet, Asian food os my favorite! I took a chance and tried these. I had to WILL myself to do it, even though I'm an established cook. Bottom line: WONDERFUL! These egg rolls were so easy to make, they turned out restaurant quality, as promised. I made them exactly as the recipe said. The only other comment I would make it to make the entire batch and then freeze the leftovers. I made the mistake of trying to freeze them un-fried. Stupid move! Mendy, please give me more authentic Chinese recipes! Especially mooshu and Governor's Chicken!
