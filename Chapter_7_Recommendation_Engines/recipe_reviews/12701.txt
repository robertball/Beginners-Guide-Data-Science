This recipe is superb. Since I didn't have the time to work with fresh cherries, both times I have made this I have used 2-3 cans of Oregon Fruit Products® pitted red tart cherries in water. Make sure you drain the cherries thoroughly. I also opted to use Pillsbury® refrigerated pie crust. The pie got rave reviews, and people were astonished that the cherries were canned and the pie crust was not homemade - that's how fresh this pie tasted. Last but not least, using the canned cherries and a ready-to-go pie crust made this recipe a snap to make!

This is a great pie! For everyone who said there are not enough cherries in this recipe, you're completely right. However Beth also put up this exact same recipe with a few changes (1/8 cup less sugar, .5 tea more cornstarch), called Cherry Pie IV. That recipe calls for 2 POUNDS pie cherries, not 2 cups. If you transfer the cups to pounds, you'll have a perfect pie. Thanks Beth!

This is my favorite pie of all time!  I made it for Thanksgiving and took some of the suggestions of others.  I used 3 cans of Oregon Fruit tart cherries and drained them really well.  I omitted the extract entirely.  I used Pillsbury pie crust which made making these a snap.  You really have to boil the filling or it won't thicken.  This tends to mash up the cherries, so I might add the third can late in the cooking process to keep some of their shape.  I can hardly wait to make this again!  Yum yum!

Oh, boy. SO good. I did make some changes, but this recipe was my starting-off point. I used a cup of almond flour (available at health food stores & Trader Joe's - or just grind almonds with a little powdered sugar or cornstarch in order to get it as fine as you can). I always use half butter, half Crisco in my crusts. I doubled the filling, because I like a big fat pie. I cooked 3/4 of the cherries & juice, and stirred in the rest of the raw cherries afterward. I used a good Kirschwasser instead of almond extract because I realized I had run out of extract. Made a lattice crust. Served with lightly sweetened vanilla whipped cream. Gorgeous.

Made this recipe twice. First time I followed the recipe exactly and found that there wasn't enough filling and that I wasn't crazy about the cornstarch method for thickening. Second time I used 3 cans of sour cherries, drained, and I used 1/2 cup flour for thickening. I dotted the top with 2 Tbsp butter before adding top crust. I also upped the almond extract just a tad. (just a personal preference)Totally enjoyed the second pie.

This pie comes out awesome every time!!  Two things I did different were let it simmer for 5 minutes, really makes it thick and such a nice deep red colour.  Also since I don't have alot of counter space used Pilsbury crust, so brushed it with egg white mixed with sugar and apple pie spice.  Made the crust shiny and added some flavor.  But by itself this is one of the BEST pie recipes!  Thanx for sharing!!

I normally don't like cherry pie, but I'm building my pie making skills and what's "pie maker" without cherry pie in her portfolio? Glad I used this recipe thanks to all the reviews as well. I only made 2 modifications to the recipe: Definitely need to get more cherries than the recipe calls for. I used 3 14.5oz canned Oregon tart cherries in water plus added a handful of frozen (but defrosted) dark sweet cherries that I had in my fridge for making smoothies. Next time I will use 2 cans tart cherries and 2 cans (or equivalent) sweet cherries. The sweet cherries added the punch of sweetness needed to balance the tartness. Drained the cherries well to take out any liquid since it produces a lot when cooking. Used 1/2cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar to taper the sweetness (since i added sweet cherries). And used my favorite pie crust: Ruths' Grandma's Pie Crust which I brushed with egg wash (on the bottom crust and top). Also, when the pie was done, I brushed the lattice weave top crust with a light corn syrup wash sprinkled with granulated sugar and put it back in the oven to set for 3 mins (per tips from allrecipes). It came out beautifully AND everyone loved it! Even people who never liked or had cherry pie raved about it! So proud of my 1st cherry pie! I only had a sliver, it was gone before I knew it! And that sliver was DELISH! 4 stars because of modifications and needing to figure out the right amount of cherries to use.

This was my first attempt at making a pie from scratch, and it turned out very well! Easy to make. I used tart cherries, but 2 cups is not enough; use at least 3. TIP: when making the crust, roll it out on wax paper for easier handling. Great recipe!

I used this recipe and it came out great. I made the following modifications... I used jarred morrello cherries from trader joes, and I used 1/4 cup tapioca in place of the cornstarch. It came out beautifully.

I made this pie for a family pie bake off and needless to say, I won!  I made it again, using two whole cans of pitted sour cherries, a bit more cornstarch and added melted butter, sugar and cinnamon to the top.  In-laws loved it for Christmas!  This was my first pie ever and it was a hit!

Well, I made this last week with several changes - I didn't have much time, so I used a thawed generic frozen pie crust, and 2 cans of cherry pie filling (one regular, one 'lite'). I emptied the cherries into a dish, and mixed in 2 sachets of Splenda. Then I mixed in the almond extract. I have never used almond extract in a cherry pie recipe before, and I was delighted at the taste! Superb! I made a lattice top for the pie using some pastry that was sitting in the freezer doing nothing, and baked it for 45 mins. Perfect! However, because Husband said he liked this a lot but would prefer it with fresh bing cherries, I made it again. Not surprisingly, he preferred the fresh. I thought it just tasted fruity, not cherry-ish. Ah well. It was good whatever. Great recipe. Thanks so much, Beth!

I fixed this pie for Thanksgiving, I could not find tart cherries, so I settled for frozen sweet cherries.  I wanted to double the recipe but was about 1 cup short, so I added Craisins (dried Cranberries).  Following the recipe, I poured the cherry mixture into the pie crust, and started to build my lattice crust.  I should have waited until the mixture cooled, as it melted the shortening in the dough, and I had a hard time keeping it from stretching, so I would recommend to others who are doing the lattice crust, to wait until the filling is cool.  Other than that, my pie got rave reviews from our guests.  I will make this again in the future, it was very good, served with homemade whipped cream... YUM!

Good pie! I used three 12oz packages frozen dark sweet cherries and reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup. Added a little lemon juice and cinnamon to the filling and baked it in a refrigerated pie crust. After it cooled, it sliced very neatly and did not run. This was my first cherry pie and it won't be my last.

Best  cherry pie I've tasted.

I picked and pitted 5 cups of cherries and doubled the filling recipe thinking that I would have enough for two pies.  I used nearly all 5 cups in my 9.5" pie plate and it didn't seem over stuffed.

I baked at 425 for 35 minutes, using foil to cover the crust edges for the first half of the baking.  I also use lard instead of shortening.  

Will make again!  ...and again...

This was terrific. Following other reviewers' recommendations, I doubled the amount of cherries called for in the recipe for a total of four cups. I kept the amounts of sugar, cornstarch, butter, and almond extract the same, though, and for my tastes, the filling still might've still been a little too sweet—next time I'll only use 1 cup of sugar. I also added one cup of ground toasted almonds to the flour and salt when I made the crust. I garnished the pie with toasted sliced almonds and powdered sugar.

Good recipe, but I used 3 cups of cherries and still needed more. I'd go for 4 cups of cherries next time.

The cherry pie filling is superb! It is not overly sweet and the thickness is just right. I will be sticking to this part of the recipe when making other cherry desserts such as crisps, cobblers, and serving it as a topping. As I am not very good with making my own crust/dough, I opted to use store bought stuff this time but perhaps I will try to go the extra step next time around. Similar to the previous reviewer, my first attempt at making a pie crust from this recipe was a bit lacklustre.

What a GREAT tasting pie AND it was super easy. I took the advice of others and changed a few things. I used 3 cans of Oregon Fruit Cherries. I cooked 2 cans and folded in 1. I also used a Pilsbury Pie Crust and it turned out superb. This pie has great flavor.  Next time I will NOT cook the cherries in sugar, but I will make a thick sauce from cornstarch, sugar and syrup from 1 cherry can. THEN, I will fold in the cherries and bake it. This will prevent the cherries from becoming mush after the stove top cooking process. I will make this again and hope for 5 stars. If you have fresh cherries as the recipe calls for, this will be picture perfect. I hope that helps!

I went searching for this recipe as I had an excess of sweet cherries from our backyard tree.  I have never been a cherry pie fan, but this recipe has made me one!  I took the suggestion other reviewers made and doubled the amount of cherries.  I used sweet cherries so I used just 1/2 cup of sugar and added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out SUPERB!  The consistency of the filling is perfect!  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you!

The VERY BEST!! Wow! I love cherry pie and the only thing I added was the cherries. I used three large cans of cherries in water (Of course I drained the juice!) to make a deep dish style pie and I didn't even get a second piece!! This one really rocks!!

This is such a great recipe!  OMG!!! The crust came together quickly and beautifully, I just wasn't sure if there'd be enough dough for two crusts, but I did't have to worry.  The filling was just sweet enough.  I had rave reviews from my husband who called it "phenomenal" and said I HAD to make this again right away!  Thanks for the recipe.

I was hoping this would be the perfect truly homemade cherry pie. The crust was actually pretty good though.  It came out of the pan so easily.  I wish I would have used it for a different pie though!  And, the strange part about that was I realized that I used only half the shortening requested, but it was actually a good mistake! However, the filling was just WAY TOO SWEET! I added vanilla instead of almond extract, which shouldn't affect the sweet factor. And, as sweet as the liquid part was the cheeries seemed to remain completely TART! The recipe called for sour cherries, so I know that was no mistake I made. The contrast however was very unpalateable. I also had to use 4 cups of cherries I tried with 2 by the directions, but the filling would have been way too liquidy just by looking at it. In the end two pieces got partially eaten and the rest got tossed out. I have never tasted a pie that I could not find some aspect of it that I didn't like. I believe if I would have sprinkled sugar or something on top it may have helped with the tartness, but I am not sure?

I have been searching for a cherry pie recipe that does not use tapioca, but still stays firm after cooling.  This seems to fit the bill.  I did use a commercially prepared pie crust instead of making my own, and I used 3 cups of tart cherries that I had picked, pitted and frozen in 3/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon Fruit Fresh.  I used the 1 1/4 cup sugar called for in the recipe.  Very good.

Very easy and delicious cherry pie!  I used 3 cans of tart cherries instead of 2.  I also used Pillsbury roll and fill pie crust along with 1/2 teaspoon of almond instead of 1/4.  Brushed the top crust (when done) with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  Top with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla ice cream.  A little expensive because of the cost of the canned cherries, but worth it!!!

This is the best cherry pie I have ever made!  I only made a few changes: I doubled the fruit.  Also, since my family does not like almond flavoring, I substituted brandy extract for almond extract.  I have already made several of these, and plan to do so whenever fresh cherries are in season!

Very good!  I used more cornstarch as I hate sloppy pie...maybe 1 extra tbsp....came out nice and firm but still soft, sweet and DELICIOUS!  Will make again for sure, this was a hit.

This is my favorite pie recipe that I have ever tried.  Make sure to use tin foil around the edges and depending on your oven temperature, you'll want to remove it around 30 - 35 mins.  Enjoy!

Amazing. Best contrast of tart and sweet.  I did take a shortcut on the crust, and used Trader Joe's frozen pie crust, but I will be attempting the crust next time.  Even people who weren't into pie thought it was amazing, and that it hits the cherry pie flavor just right - not too sweet, not too sour.  I did use the revised version of this recipe that has more cherries (2 lbs), less sugar, and a bit more cornstarch, which was according to the reviews of others.  Fantastic.

"Simple things are best" holds true with this cherry pie. Simple enough to easily memorize the recipe, but the flavors pop.

I have made this recipe twice, and since I couldn't find sour cherries at my local grocery store, I had to settle for regular cherries. The result was cloyingly sweet, even the second time when I cut back on the sugar. If you can't find sour cherries, just stick to the canned cherry pie filling, or go with a different kind of fruit pie altogether.  The reason for my low rating isn't because my pies tasted too sweet (my fault, I know), but because the process of stirring the cherries in with the sugar and water yielded very odd results: the second time, even after stirring constantly, the cherries turned as blue as blueberries. It was unappetizing looking, and ended up just seeming like far too much work when there are so many great pie recipes out there.

FANTASTIC!  I used 3 cans of Oregan red tart cherries (drained).  Also... The light almond flavor is absolutely perfect.

Just the perfect sweetness despite the very tart cherries I used.  Not quite enough filling to accomplish a full pie, but worked wonderful with a lattice crust.  I had to let my filling simmer about 5 minutes extra to thicken, but once it did it set up nicely.  This pie cut perfectly and kept it's shape when dished out.

I followed the filling part of this  recipe exactly, but it didn't turn out good at all.  I used my own crust recipe.  I couldn't get the juices to thicken after trying for quite a while.  So my filling was very runny.  My pie crust didn't fill up either.  I could have used a good 2 more cups probably.  My filling was not red, but more purple like.  It was kind of gritty from the sugar.  Which I think was to much since it was very sweet too.  The pie tasted strongly of almond extract too.  This pie gave me heartburn for two days.  I was really depressed this pie didn't turn out because as a child we had cherry trees, and Mom always made awesome cherry pies.  As for the pies that turned out I can't understand it because I made sure the couple ingredients I used were of perfect amounts.  I'll probably just look for another recipe.  It was fun trying though.

This was excellent!  I was overloaded with cherries this week from our three trees, and even though I don't normally like cherry pie I thought I better do something with the cherries.  I made two pies using this recipe and our guests just left saying that it was excellent pie. I even had two pieces!
The only thing I did different was I used vanilla since I didn't have almond extract.  
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a good recipe but needed some fiddling.  Firstly, I substituted 1/2 cup of the shortening with butter for better taste (but that's a personal thing). The big problem was there aren't nearly enough cherries.  I doubled the amount of cherries, but once I did that (without doubling the other ingredients) it turned out well.

I made a gluten free crust for my cherry pie, used 3 jars of Trader Joe's Morello cherries, drained (36 oz of cherries). Cooked the filling and let it cool before adding to my pie shell to bake. Brushed the top crust with cream and sprinkled with turbinado sugar and baked for 1 hour. Then I chilled it to help set the filling even more. Slices came out beautiful.

This was pretty good! The pie crust was just your basic pie crust, so I used a Pillsbury one instead, but the filling was delicious! I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla instead. Will use again!

My (first) cherry pie and it was perfect! I used the grandma's pie crust, I used butter instead of shortening (which isn't available in The Netherlands). I used 600 grams of fresh cherries, a tin of cherry pie filling and a jar with 160 grams cherries on sirup. Also, I used amaretto liquor, instead of almond essence.

I made this pie for my family and it was a great success! They loved it so much that it was nearly all gone 15 min after it came from the oven. I used butter flavored shortening, 7 teaspoons of corn starch and 2 of almond flour, Fresh cherries... And it was just amazing.  Will definitely bake this pie again

Instead of sour cherries, I use one 16 oz bag of frozen dark sweet cherries pitted, or fresh dark sweet cherries.  It gives a great flavor that goes well with the almond extract.  This pie recipe is awesome and the cherries can be replaced with any type of fruit to make any type of fruit pie!

I had to alter the indications a bit in order to fill my deep-dish (9-inch) pie plate.  It took 3 lbs of cherries & about 5 t more cornstarch.  I doubled the butter and quadrupled the almond extract (glad I did.)  Also, I used a pie crust I knew to be good already (Flaky & Tasty Pastry from this site) and didn't have to bake longer than 50 minutes, though this pie took a LONG time to set.  Well worth the effort!

This was my first ever cherry pie from scratch, I made the dough and all. I loved this pie, I ended up using frozen sweet cherries as that was all I could find. It wasn't as tart because of the cherries I used, but I absolutely loved the flavor with the almond extract. Definitely a keeper!

This was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly only I used refrigerated pillsbury pie crust & everyone loved it. They never even asked about the crust (assuming it was my usual home-made crust). I used fresh sour cherries because I believe that is one thing you can't cheat on! I did a lattice top crust & had beauitful oozing juices!! This will be my keeper, thank you!!

I wanted to make something different for Thanksgiving, other than my traditional Pumpkin, Apple and Pecan Pies, so after researching recipes, decided on this one. I read a lot of the reviews, and boy were they helpful. I used 3 cans of Oregon Sour cherries, and could have used one more probably...accidentally put in a tablespoon more cornstarch and my 5 year old added a tablespoon more butter, lol, she likes butter...and it turned out fabulous!! I confess, I used a Publix crust, have ZERO counterspace for rolling anything out, lol...For my first from scratch (mostly) Cherry pie, it was a big hit, the first dessert (from a whole bunch) gone, and I had a dozen requests for the recipe! This recipe is foolproof, and is going in my permanent recipe box!

This was my first attempt at baking a pie from scratch.  It came out tasting delicious.  I have to say that I found making the pie crust super difficult, but I think that is a consequence of my inexperience with pie crusts, not the recipe.  Other than the crust, making the filling was easy.  I used three 14 ounce cans of tart pitted cherries and that was the appropriate amount.  I then made a lattice top for the pie.  The flavor of this pie was great and it looked just like a pie you would buy from a baker.  Thanks!

This pie filling was EASY to do.  I used regular cherries right off the tree (not bing) so you can use any cherry.  I followed the instructions for the filling and it tasted GREAT!  I did however cheat and put the cherry pie filling into pre made tart shells. YUM!!

A perfect cherry pie. My first pie ever made. The crust was great. I used the Oregon canned cherries (3 cans) and put some blueberries in too because I had some. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very simple pie! I don't make my own pie crust. I just use the roll out pie crust from the store. 10 teaspoons of corn starch equals 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon, just for easier measuring. I used three cans of Oregon Tart Cherries, drained really well. I also cooked a bit longer than suggested. My husband really hates when you cut into a pie and it oozes out everywhere, so I cook it longer to ensure its thickness. If you stir carefully you shouldn't mush up too many of the cherries by cooking it longer. ENJOY!

This pie turned out wonderful.  The filling did not run at all.. I used Splenda in place of the sugar and it taste and looks wonderful.  Thank You for a great recipe!

This pie is delicious.  I like cinnamon, so I added cinnamon to taste. 
I also increased the recipe and made several batches for canning.  I plan to give them as presents for Christmas.  The filling seperated a little in the jars, but I just stirred it before I put into a crust.

This is great.  I used probably about 5 cups of fresh cherries since I had a deep dish pie dish.  I used a premade pie crust to cut down on time.  I lowered the sugar amount to about 1/2 a cup and used splenda.  I'm glad I did since these were actually sweet cherries and it was sweet enough as is.  I brushed the top of the crust with butter when it came out of the oven.  This was one of the best pies I have ever made.  And thank you to the person that suggested using a straw to pit the cherries! That little tidbit saved me so much time and I was able to keep the cherries whole!

I use the filling from this recipe with a graham cracker crust and the topping from "Cherry Crumble" by Debbie Rowe also from this site. The fresh filling beats any commercial filling!

Great recipe and sooo easy! Both I & my boyfriend agree though that it needs to be sweeter! I will add 2 cups of sugar next time. Other than that it was perfect. I will use this as a basic recipe for all friut pie I make from now on because it's so simple! Thanks!

excellent! double the filling and if you happen to use sweet cherries like i did, then cut the  sugar in half. a very forgiving recipe, since i added a little more cherries and approximated a little more of everything and it came out great.

The crust is AMAZING, just like gramma (the one who's pie's you LOVED) used to make.  In the future, I will make 1½ times the filling at least, it was a little thin for my family's tastes.  Good flavor!  This recipe has made it into my recipe box.

I finally found a cherry pie recipe I loved. My changes...I used 7 cups of cherries. I used 4 cups for the filling mixture and then I folded an additional 3 cups in the filling as it was cooling. I also used sweet, fresh cherries and a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust for time. I added 3 Tsp of butter on top of the filling before adding the top crust and I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top crust before baking.

This was the first (berry) pie recipe that I have tried that turned out so successfully! Usually my berry pies end up being so soupy you have to eat it with a spoon but this recipe made my cherry pie turn out so perfect and thick that you could cut out a piece and pick it up and eat it with your hands without making an awful mess! I would recommend this recipe to everyone...especially those who have had the same issues with thickness as me!!!

I have always failed with fruit pies until this one.  This is not only the best fruit pie I have made it may just be the best pie in general.  I did not add a top.  I also used a ready made crust (because I stink at that too).  I made the filling, poured it in and folded the edges down slightly.... DELICIOUS!

I am giving this 5 stars even though I didn't follow all the directions. This was my own fault. I used a pre-made crust, and had 3 cans of cherries, 2 in syrup and 1 in water. (my local store only had one can of water left!) Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and oh man, it was delicious! The almond extract is a great edition. The only issue I had was that 3 cans of cherries was slightly too much and I had to put a pan underneath to catch some of the juice oozing out of the pie. Next time I will make the recipe exactly (well, maybe I will keep my additional cherries), when I can get my hands on all the proper ingredients.

This was my first ever attempt at a cherry pie (or a fruit pie in general), and I made it for my boyfriend who is somewhat of a cherry pie afficionado. He LOVED it!! He said it was just perfect - consistency, flavor, everything. I took some reviewers' suggestions and put in 4 cups of cherries (I had to use frozen pie cherries from Whole Foods since fresh cherries are out of season), and I also put 1 cup of almond flour in the crust. He said the crust was particularly amazing. I'll definitely be making this again, and can't wait to see if it's even better with fresh cherries!

Just made this recipe. It was good, but not the best. I would almost prefer to buy a frozen cherry pie... I used 2 cans of pie fillings, and should have bought one more. I made the crust as well,it was flaky but lacked flavor. I used less sugar (1 cup) which was a good decision. Not a bad pie though, maybe it would have tasted better if I bought sour cherries or fresh cherries instead of the filling.

Amazing filling, BUT luckily for me I bought 2 extra cans of cherries at the store. Even with 3 cans, the filling is not enough. You MUST USE at least 4 cans. I didn't realize it until I had already put the filling in that I made, and then had to fold another can while it was in the crust! Next time I will use 5 cans so the pie is actually full.

I used 3 (14oz.) cans of tart cherries in water. Used 1 more tsp. of cornstarch and added vanilla instead of almond and a dash of cinnamon. The filling was to die for!! Pie looks fantastic and cannot wait to dig in. Thanks!!!!

This was definitely delicious, but did not set up very well. Would have liked it to be less runny, don't know if I should have cooked it the day before so it had more time to set up or what. Made my own crust and used sweet cherries cuz I love them and everyone raved.

This was a delicious cherry pie! I added an 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg to mine, and about a tsp. of cinnamon as well, which made it so delicious! I also used Pastry for Double Pie-Crust from this site instead of the crust from this recipe. I cut out leaf and acorn shapes from the rolled pie crust, brushed them with water and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar, and laid these cutouts on top of the filling. Not only was it easier than rolling out the pie crust, it also looked beautiful! Everyone loved the pie; I will make it again!

This was great!  We rarely make desserts but this week we made the cherry pie and used the filling on a no bake cheese cake, both were wonderful.  We doubled the cherries to 4 cups and used 1/2 cup sugar. My mothers review was it was "the best cherry pie she ever had".

This was the best looking Cherry Pie I have ever made! Everything about the recipe was fabulous except... It was much too sweet! Not certain if it was my fault or the Recipes yet. Proceed with caution for now.

Pretty good; you can use regular sweet cherries, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and add 2 tsps lemon juice

Every easy and very delicious cherry pie!!!  I used my own pie crust recipe for this pie. For the pie filling, I followed other member's suggestion and used two cans of Oregon's tart cherry (drained) and only used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch. I baked 25 minutes @ 375 degree and 20 minutes @ 350 degree and my pie came out perfectly. The pie needs to be chill for at lease couple hours before serving. If you plan to serve this pie in a party, I would suggest you to make the pie one day in advance so the pie filling can be totally sealed and be cut perfectly without seeing the runny filling. Excellent cherry pie & I highly recommend this easy and delicious pie to any cherry pie lovers~

What a hit!!! I made this pie for Christmas b/c my husband loves cherry pie. I made my own crust using my food processor and followed this recipe exactly using 2 bags of frozen cherries. My husband took a taste and said, "Wow! This pie is FANTASTIC! This is the best cherry pie I ever tasted. This is the pie I've been looking for ever since I started eating cherry pie!" Everyone else loved it, too, and a lot of them said they usually don't particularly like cherry pie. I highly recommend this recipe.

I had never made a homemade cherry pie. This was my first atempt and it was perfect. It set beautifully. It was not runny at all. I am  now making another one. I did not use the pie crust part. I used another recipe for the crust. I am so glad I picked this recipe for my first pie. It will be my cherry pie recipe. Thanks!

This pie was absolutely amazing! I also used canned tart cherries in water (2 cans) and made sure to drain them well, along with the store bought crusts. It was PERFECT! It was the perfect blend of tart and sweet. I will be using this recipe again and again and again! Thank you!!! :)

Absolutely WONDERFUL!  I have never before been able to make a good pie - this one is great!  I actually had too many fresh cherries for 1 pie so I made a second batch of crust and added 2 apples diced into the cherries and made a second pie.  Both were eaten almost as soon as they came out of the oven.  Thanks

i was very disappointed with this pie. the crust tasted like shortning and flour (does shortening go stale?), and the filling was bland. i had to add extra cornstartch because it didn't thicken at all, and then it didn't fill the pie pan so i added cherries. 

i gave this recipe 3 stars just in case i was dissappointed because of the changes i made. i used bing cherries, added the extra cherries and cornstartch, and brushed butter on the top. it LOOKED excellent.  :( sorry!

FANTASTIC!  I made the filling with 4 cups of cherries and used vanilla extract (it was all I had).  The filling was not runny at all.  I did cheat and use a frozen crust, but it came out wonderful!  I usually don't care for cherry pie, but it was so delicious!!  This was my first attempt at a fruit pie and I WILL be making this again  :)

I made this for my dad for father's day. Cherry pie is his favorite - and he is quite the critic. Dad LOVED this cherry pie. He said that it was a very close rival to his mother's cherry pie. Quite a compliment! I could not find fresh sour cherries, so I did use 2 cans of cherry pie filling. I still cooked the filling with butter and almond extra extract, but only used half the sugar (3/4 c.). The crust turned out excellent. I created a lattice top and sprinkled it lightly with sugar and cinnamon. It was wonderful. I did try to prebake the bottom crust for 10 minutes - (got a little stuck to the foil I laid over it) - so next time, I'll skip trying to prebake the crust. Thanks for a great recipe - will be making again!

This pie turned out pretty good. The filling was excellent but definitely needed to add an extra 2 cups of cherries but no need to double the sugar, it was sweet enough with what the recipe called for.  I substituted almond extract for vanilla extract because it is all I had.  I found that the crust browned too much after 35 mins and I had the temp set to 375 like the recipe said. I would begin checking after 30 mins next time to ensure it does not burn.  Overall a very good cherry pie.

This recipe just barely created enough dough.  I ended up creating a lattice on the top, because I didn't think there would be enough.  I used a standard 9" pyrex pie dish.

Also, I did half cherries half raspberries, because cherry pie is boring (I think).  I switched almond extract to vanilla extra (better with cherries, don't you think?)  Anyway, overall -- a basic pie, quite tasty.

I make cherry pie every year for President's Day and this is the best one I've made so far.  Quick and delicious and I cheated with canned cherries and a frozen crust.  However, this crust recipe is my mom's recipe from the '50's and it is wonderful.

This is the Best Cherry Pie I have ever eaten. My mom and good friend also thought it was the best they have ever eaten. However, I would also recommend doubling the cherries.

This pie was very good and my husband who loves cherry pie really enjoyed it.  I could not find sour cherries so had to buy frozen dark sweet pitted cherries.  I used 3 times the amount of cherries called for in the recipe.  2 cups would not have been enough.  I love almond extract but found the flavor a bit overpowering so next time will either only add a few drops or leave out all together.  I also used pillsbury pie crust (the kind you unroll) and worked out great. Easy to make the lattice top which was pretty.

Do not waste your time on this pie!!!! First, it started with the crust.... I have NEVER had a crust crumble apart so badly. Somehow the crust was way too moist but crumble apart so easily. I ended up throwing it out and starting a new crust recipe (one I've used with my other pies). Then there's the filling.... no matter how long I boiled or simmered the filling it stayed water and tasted like poo. It was grainy from the sugar and the cornstarch taste never went away. Not only did it stay runny, there was not nearly enough for a full pie. At least not the pie size their suggesting in this recipe. I ended up grabbing 2 1/2 more cups of cherries, heated them in a separate pan then added them to the other mixture. It still stayed runny until I added a good couple pinches of flour. Then I was able to make an edible cherry pie.

My first completely from scratch pie, turned out delicious! Probably would pre bake the crust for about 5 minutes before adding the cherries and lattice top but great! I used 4 cups of cherries instead of 2 because of all the recommendations.

I used my old stand by pie crust, so this review is only for the filling.  It was very good.  I received a lot of complements on it at our work potluck!  Don't worry if your filling does not get thick.  Mine did not and turnned out great anyway!

This was my first lattice top, and I found it surprisingly simple to make. I ended up heating up cherry pie filling and stirring in the almond extract, which I think added another dimension to the pie filling. I never let this cool completely and served slightly warm, which means it was still runny - but I heard no complaints!

This was a great pie recipe.  I made a few changes from the start.  I did use my own crust recipe.  I also used half tart, half sweet cherries and I really liked the balance.  Though next time I will add an extra teaspoon or two of corn starch as the pie didn't set up as well as I had hoped.  Maybe I need to let it simmer longer. I will definitely make more cherry pies with this recipe as the base!

Loved it!  I used fresh cherries.  Also, you can use more cherries if you want, this amount was ok for me.   Delicious!

I tried this recipe with a few alterations.  I used 8 cups of frozen cherries, 3 Tbsp. quick tapioca, 10 tsp. cornstarch, and 2 cups sugar (prefer pie a little tart), 2 Tbsp. butter, and 1/2 tsp. almond extract.
I actually made this a cobbler because I hate a soggy bottom crust, which invariably happens after the pie sits for a while.  I buttered a  12 inch square Corning Ware casserole dish, placed the cherry filling in it, and covered it with a crust made from half of the dough (divided dough into 2 balls before chilling).  The crust was very easy to blend and roll, and I used a 1-cup Crisco stick (which was not chilled) instead of chilled shortening.  This is a delicious recipe.

I used refrigerated pie crusts. I changed the 10 teaspoons cornstarch to 3 Tablespoons. The recipe calls for 2 cups cherries. I just used 2 cans, drained, cherries. Easy recipe to keep on hand. Thanks.

Very yummy with the alterations that include two pints of cherries instead of two cups. I threw in a half cup of chocolate chips to make this a CHOCOLATE Cherry Pie -- delicious!

I use this recipe every year when our pie cherry tree fills with cherries.  I love the addition of almond extract and it always thickens up perfectly.  I have never used the pie crust recipe though, since I always use my own.  Great recipe.

In my Parents back yard we have a sour cherry tree and this year, to everyone's surprise, the birds didn't eat them. So my children and I picked a grand total of 12 cups of cherries! We did two different batches of pies, baking 2 each time. the first time we did 6 cups of cherries and 3 1/2 cups of sugar. We decided that it was two much sugar and only added 3 cups in the second Bach. The other thing we changed is that we used vanilla instead of almond the second time.   Both batches were great! I hope you enjoy this summertime recipe, it was a lot of fun for us!!

This cherry pie was sooooo good.  My aunt lives in kelowna, so she sent us alot of fresh cherries.  I pitted them all and made this pie...my first time making cherry pie and it was fantastic. I used three cups of cherries instead of two and because I didn't have almond extract I used vanilla instead.  I will be making this one again for sure in the future.

This is a wonderful cherry pie recipe! The only changes i made were adding more cherries (about 3 cups, and could have added more!), vanilla extract instead of almond because its what i had on hand, and i always use lard in my pie crusts. My husband has been begging me to make it again! Thanks Beth :)

I gave this 4 stars only because the ingredients need to be altered, as said in other posts. I baked this last night and it was soooo yummy.  However, 2 cups of cherries would not have been enough filling. I used 4 cups of fresh sweet pitted cherries, and only 1 cup of sugar with all the other filling ingredients remaining the same.  The crust was delish!  I thought I had a good pie crust, but this one beats it, hands down!  Very flaky, even the bottom crust remained flaky with the gooey filling, which is sometimes a hard thing to pull off.  Also, I was a little concerned about the crust when I first made it because it was so soft and sticky, so I added a good bit of flour to the pastry sheet I rolled it out on to prevent sticking. Came out perfect!  I'll definitely make this one again!

This is my go-to cherry pie recipe.  I don't always make the crust, but this filling can't be beat.  It always turns out with the best taste and consistency.  I also make the filling by itself to use on mini cheesecakes or on top of ice cream.  It is just awesome!

Absolutely Delicious.  However, I did not use the pie crust provided...I utlized the Perfect Pie Crust Recipe....Perfect ! Also, I didn't think 2 cups of cherries were enough, so I added another 2/3 cup...The consistency was perfect...not runny at all...Almond Flavoring was an added bonus and would have never thought of it !

Every one loved this pie!  I made a few changes and used canned country style cherries and put them in a saucepan on medium heat and added a bit of cornstarch.  This thickened the sauce a little more, and it turned out great.  I also added the almond extract, which was awesome. Everyone was wondering what the little extra was!  Didn't use the crust recipe, because I have my own that turns out much better.

Great recipe and easy, but like others, I found the filling to be a tad too sweet. My suggestion for others is to try it with a little less than one cup, maybe 3/4 cup and then increase it from there to your tastes. 1 1/2 cups sugar is just too much for most people. Other than that, perfect! Oh, and if you are like me and found your cherry filling to be a little drab looking, add a little red food coloring and you're good to go.

This recipe was awesome. My first attempt ever to make a pie from scratch! I live in the cherry capitol Traverse City so fresh cherries are no problem. I didn't have any shortning so I just used butter.  I added some crushed almonds to the crust as well, instead of cold water I used the chilled cherry juice that was in the bag of cherries. I ended up using 3 cups of cherries and could have put 1 more in.  I finished the crust off with a sprinkle of sugar. I loved the almond extract addition also!

Not very good. But I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used Bing cherries bcz thats all I had. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It was too sweet for me and I just didnt like the flavor of the cherries. I usually love cherry pies bought at the store, but this was no where near as tasty. I dont know if I would try this again, but if I did I would use a lot less sugar (maybe half cup total).

I made a lot of changes that people suggested for the recipe, and it turned out very good. I have a sweet tooth so I used some sweet cherries along with the sour, but I think next time I will use even more (3 cans sweet, 1 sour)

My first cherry pie, came out very well and was really easy.  I used a different pie crust, but this filling and a little less sugar (1 cup).

Finally a cherry pie success story. I've been trying for 13 years to make my husband his favorite dessert and each time, I end up throwing it in the trash. This recipe is foolproof. I also upped the cherry amount as stated in previous reviews. Yum Yum Yum. I made a little too much filling (if thats even possible!) and we had it over ice cream. Delish! The only problem is now my husband wants one pie a week. LOL

This was the best cherry pie I have ever made or ever tasted.  I used fresh cherries.  My favorite thing about this recipe was that after I let it sit for a bit I cut it and the cherries didn't run all over the bottom of the dish.  They stayed in the pie!  Usually the pie filling has a problem with this.  Amazing, will make again.

Honestly, I was disappointed by this pie. The filling was delicious, but the crust was far too rich and fattening, which detracted from the taste. I would make this again, but definitely use my own crust recipe.

This was delish!  My first cherry pie from scratch! My 4 year old and I made it together.  We used about 2 lbs of fresh cherries, and cut down on the sugar to a little over half a cup.  Will def. make again, very easy, VERY GOOD!

I made the crust using a different recipe which calls for 2 2/3 cup flour, 1 cup shortening , 1 tsp salt and 7 -8 tblsps. ice cold water. I didn't think 2 cups was enough cherries, so I added 4 cups ( I used fresh - a bit of extra work but I think worth the effort). I think it's a delicious pie!!

We added half canned cherries, half canned peaches when we made this, and it was delicious! You might want to try putting a teeny bit more than the recommended amount of filling. SO GOOD!

Simply put...the best cherry pie I've made. I did use a Pilsbury crust and 3 cans Oregon pie cherries, left the rest the same and voila! deliciousness.

I made this filling recipe and used the crust from the 'best ever pie crust' recipe. following some other reviews, i made sure the filling was nice and thick when mixing it on the stove so the pie wouldn't come out runny. i used half almond extract and half vanilla just for fun- they both sounded good. I used three cans of oregon sour cherries and the pie wasn't even heaping. I made this for my boyfriend and he thought it was good, but his roommate thought it was the best ever!

This was my first 'from scratch' cherry pie and I was quite pleased with the results.  I only gave it 4 stars because the filling was a bit too gelatinous for my liking.  We ate it over 3-4 days and it just got more firm as the days went by.  Next time I make this recipe I will reduce the amount of cornstarch maybe by a third.  Pie itself was very delicious though!  Thanks for posting.

I only give this four stars because I made a few adjustments. When I made the crust I added a little almond extract to it to add more flavor. I also added cinnamon and did half white sugar and half brown sugar. I made it for an Easter dinner and it turned out delicous!

Great crust and pie! Added 2T of sugar to the crust, though, we like ours slightly sweet. And used 3 c. cherries. Will make again as soon as the cherries look good! Thanks!

This is the first pie I have ever made and it was *positively perfect*! I was so excited! I didn't want to consume my day making the crust so I used the Pillsbury rollable crust instead and substituted vanilla extract for the almond. It was the perfect consistency and flake! Thanks so much for the recipe Beth, it has a permanent home in my recipe box!

This pie recipe is great! I made a few changes... I used bing cherries, 4 cups of them, left all the other ingredients the same, except the sugar. I used only 1 cup. I also added 2 tsp lemon juice so it would have a slight tang to it. 
I also used the pillsbury roll out crust (i was pressed for time.) It came out great. My husband that thought cherry pie was just allright has eaten over half of it in 12 hours! It has a much fresher cherry taste than any store bought or frozen pie. This recipe is a keeper! I will use a few more cherries in my next one. I love "high" pies. by the way. make sure you cook the mixture long enough. It really had a perfect consistency too.

This pie was really rather tasty!  I liked the way the almond extract gave it a bit of interest. Like many of the other comments, there weren't enough cherries. Lucky for me I had some in the freezer but I think that's why the filling was a bit runny.

I also used sweet cherries (the fresh and the frozen) so cut back on the white sugar by 1/4 c.

But yum.  Would make again.

I made this recipe and it looked beautiful coming out of the oven! It did not over-brown and the touch of butter, cinnamon, and sugar to the crust really make it look scrumptious. I used fresh bing cherries and did not cook them (as recommended previously) b/c I like firmer cherries. As far as the taste, it turned out to be just ok. It was not as sweet as expected and although I love almond extract, I do not think it meshed well with the cherries. Also, the mixture did not gel at all...it actually came out runny! What did I do? Was it the cherry choice or should I have cooked the mixture before adding it to the pie crust?

I made this for my boyfriend, who loved it.  I don't eat cherry pie, so this is solely on what he says, but apparently it was one of the best pies he had ever had.  I have never even made a pie before, so definitely a great beginner's pie!

Excellent! My husband loved this and he does not like cherry pies generally. I scramble for a last minute cherry pie recipe to use the cherries off our tree for Father's day and it was a hit.  I used a different crust recipe and sprinkled some cinnamon sugar over the top and there were no leftovers.

I have tried many Cherry Pie recipes and this is my husband's favorite by far.  I cut back on the sugar a little because I used fresh Bing cherries and used my own crust, but this set up nicely and was delicious!

This was a very good pie. Pitting the cherries takes a while, but the pastry is excellent (very flaky!). I would definitely go with the tart cherries, though. I used "regular" cherries (the nice dark ones), and the filling was too sweet for me.

This is a really great pie! It was the first all-homemade pie we've made and it went much more smoothly than I'd anticipated.  Even our preschooler got to help roll the crusts, (which turned out light and flaky!)  We will definitely use this recipe again and again.

Very good pie but needed to double the filling.  I also added a little vanilla and almond extract.

Fantastic recipe! Did everything as directed other than substituting  the almonds extract with vanilla and adding an extra dash of corn starch to make the filling a bit thicker. Yummy yumm! Here’s a photo of the pie, ignore the bubble!

I used this recipe for the filling and bought a crust. I was in a hurry and this was fast AND my first cherry pie!  I did add about 1/4 more sugar just to be sure.   Everyone loved it.

I used three cans of cherries and 1 1/4th teaspoons of almond extract. Also used butter flavored shortening. It was great. 1 can of cherries is too few.

I doubled the amount of cherries and substituted amaretto for the brandy.  That made 1 pie as described plus 2 individual pies.  Oh, and add about 2-3 TB of flour.  The cornstarch alone doesn't thicken it enough.  But also add the flour and it didn't even overflow in the oven.

My husband can't wait for me to make another one!

I made this recipe and everybody liked it and it’s very simple because it’s the first time I made a cherry pie from scratch and everybody liked it better than a pie that was bought from a pie specialty store the key is to get good cherries and I bought cherries at a roadside stand in Waterloo California and they have millions of cherries hanging off the tree is super fresh super good

I've never even eaten cherry pie before and this was amazing!! I had to use Oregon tart cherries in a can because I couldn't find fresh or frozen and it was delicious. I made my own crust but it was a deep dish pan so I doubled the filling. I read past reviews saying to make sure you don't skimp on the stove top part and I made sure it was a thick syrup consistency before removing it from the heat. Otherwise I kept it true to the recipe and it was a Christmas desert hit, beautiful on the outside and scrumptious.

I followed other people's recommendations and used Oregon tart canned cherries but it wasn't that good. The mushy texture of the filling wasn't very good and it was too sweet.

The taste was good.   Cherries are in season now, so the ones I used were very big.  I would double the amount of cherries, because the pie turned out very thin.  When you cook the cherries, they reduce in size.  Also, I did not use all the juice that was made.  I didn't want the pie to overflow.  I did like the way it set up.

How can Cherry Pie III and Cherry Pie IV both be the 1999 winner when they are completely different recipes?  Low rating is due to what appears to be false information.

I made this today but made one adjustment. I didn't have sour cherries so I used regular cherries.  Since its was so sweet (and I forgot to cut the sugar) I added lemon juice.  The flavor was great but it didn't set up good but I think that's my fault and don't let it thicken up enough.  I'll definitely make again!

Fantastic! This was the first time that I ever made a pie crust and it came out perfect. I will definitely be making this again.  i did add an egg wash right before I put it into the oven and I am glad that I did because it helped it to get nice and brown.  Give this a try!

So, the review is for the crust only. The crust tasted so bad. It 
 basically tasted like burnt flower and margarin. The filling was great, it's just I cannot bring this over for Thanksgiving because of how bad the crust ended up tasting. I'm just going to make an apple pie with some pre-made crusts instead.

I used two 24oz jars of dark Morello cherries, drained. I reduced the sugar to one cup, and reserved the sweet juice from the jar to make sure there was enough juice for the cherries.

Excellent! Nice and tart and a hit with everyone who tasted it.  I will definitely hold onto this recipe.  I used the same proportions to make a triple berry pie (with less sugar) and that turned out amazing as well.

Delicious!!  I made it exactly as written with the exception of doubling the cherries, using fresh cherries.  It thickened up nicely and tasted yummy.   I wasn't sure if I'd be leaving a review, that depended on my finicky boyfriend who rarely comments on anything I cook.  When he told me that he liked the pie, it was good, I knew I hit upon a winner!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Reading these reviews makes for a very entertaining Sunday morning activity. "Best Pie Ever! Although I did change everything about it." People, if you altered the recipe, YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE RECIPE and cannot possibly give it four or five stars. LOL.

Anyways, it was obvious to me that two cups of cherries wouldn't be sufficient. I pitted four cups of fresh cherries and doubled the remaining ingredients for the filling to keep the ratios correct. This was my first cherry pie filling from scratch (I used a store-bought crust).

After putting the cherries, sugar, and corn starch in the pan I was doubtful there would be any liquid to boil, but the gastronomy gods extracted so much cherry juice from those little orbs that it was quickly very soupy. Directions are perfect. You have to have faith (in science).

Lovely flavor and consistency. I'd probably add even more cherries and drain some of the juices so it was more pulpy and less jelly. Also, I'd probably leave out the almond extract. Taste preference only, but it was nice.

Amazing and everyone that takes a bite from it loves it! I add vanilla in mine and cinnamon to the flour to make a flavored crust. Then also add a dash of vanilla into the cherries.

It was a miracle this pie was good, because I was in Italy with limited resources.  I used 2 cans of water-packed cherries.  I drained the water completely  from one can.  I mixed 3 tablespoons of cornstarch with 3/4 cup of sugar.   I cooked the pie filling till thick.  There was no butter or  almond flavoring.   I used the crust recipe, and baked for 45 minutes at 200° celcius.

Absolutely the best flavor! Thank you ... recently I tried adding the juice from 2 medium sized lemons and it was terrific in my opinion and my family's .. if anyone tries that addition I'd love to hear your thoughts :-)

This cherry pie recipe is pretty delicious. In the reviews, one individual states that Beth resubmitted this recipe with the correction of 2 LBS vs 2 cups of cherries. I did use frozen sweet dark cherries, 5 (10 oz) bags and I could have added another just because. My son likes sweet cherry pie versus tart, and this hit the mark. We are eating it tomorrow for Christmas, but I had to taste the filling before baking and it is the BOMB!! The only addition was 2 TLBs of brown sugar.

OH Wow!   This was delicious!   I used tart pie cherries in a van as I could not find others!   I also used a different crust recipe I found on all recipes as well!   I will make this over and over it was so delicious!

Excellent recipe, I used a little more cherries since I had to use canned tart cherries and they are small. I added a bit more sugar and cornstarch to compensate.

Came out perfectly! The crust was the best crust I have even seen and worked with, so flexible, supple, soft, and yet not unreasonably sticky, dense, or crumbly when mixed. I used regular, fresh cherries in place of tart ones - no problem there. The filling came out perfectly! After the ten minutes to let the sugar draw out the juices, there was still not any liquid in the saucepan from the fresh cherries. It was just cherries and a lot of powder. As everything started heating up on the stove, however, I just split each cherry in half, and soon had enough liquid that it was boiling and frothing in a yummy mix. Loved this recipe, it will be my go to for conventional cherry pie!

This was my first time using my home grown cherries to make a pie. I wish I would have read the reviews before making it and doubled the cherries. I used the recommended two cups, and then had a tough time getting the filling to thicken. I tried adding more cornstarch which didn't help, and ended up adding tapioca to thicken it up and it worked nicely. I will try the recipe again with changes, but as written it's not worth 5 stars

After reading the recipe, realized this is my granny's crust!  To those who have never made a homemade crust...it is so easy, I'll never by store bought.  I had just picked and pitted my cherries and thought 2 cups wouldn't be enough....I did 5 cups total cherries, and upped the almond extract by a a couple of drops more. Didn't change anything else.... PERFECT!  Loved the fact that it is a firmer fruit pie, not runny at all!

I made this pie with my son today and we are both happy with the results.  I can only give the recipe 3 stars because the recipe needs tweaks to get a really good result. First challenge was the crust. It was very soft and fragile and I had to roll it thinner than I'd like to fit the pie plate, but then it tore easily. I'll add  about 1/2 cup flour next time.  It didn't make enough filling.  We used 3 cans of Oregon sour cherries - about 4.5 cups - and increased the sugar but 1/2 cup rather than doubling it so the filling wouldn't be too sweet. The result was a perfect balance of tart and sweet

I used 3 cans of sour cherries.  Cut sugar back by 2 T, and used 1/2 cup flour instead of cornstarch like another review suggested.  It did not need to stand for 10 minutes, the juices flowed quickly.  Filling seems to have lots of thickener.  If I made this again, I would use less sugar and flour and possibly another can of cherries, especially if using a deep dish pie plate.
also may add some lemon juice or zest.

I used a refrigerated pie crust, frozen pitted sweet cherries and cherry extract instead of almond because I had all of these things on hand.  This is easily the best cherry pie I have ever eaten and I MADE IT!  My family was asking me to make another before the first two were gone.  (My pie dishes are slightly larger than normal so I used a few extra cherries and I mixed 4 tablespoons corn starch with about 1/4 c of apple juice, prior to adding to the mixture,  to prevent clumping.)

My review is solely of the filling for this pie, since I used my own crust recipe. It was really delicious. I did make one alteration, however. I didn't have time to work with fresh cherries so I used two cans of pitted red tart cherries instead.

I cheated and used store bought pie crust in a box because I have no confidence that I can make a decent crust and that I'd ruin the pie. Having said that, this pie was the best! Next time I may have the courage to try the crust portion of the recipe.

Thank you for sharing!!! This recipe is too good to be true. It is simple, yet so good! I've never made a fruit pie before, and this was my first attempt. I was amazed at how easy it was. I actually made them into turnovers, my husband and I are hooked. I did have to adjust the baking time to 22 minutes for those. They are fantastic!!

I've never made a homemade cherry pie before and this was a hit!  I could not find tart cherries and used Rainier cherries (they are yellow so I assumed they were sour, but they aren't!) so the pie looked more like peach pie in color.  I used a generous cup of sugar and the sweetness was just right.  A keeper.--Double the amount of cherries--AT LEAST!!!

This was okay, but i think less shortening would help with the crust.  I also recommend just using 1 cup sugar.

The best recipe I've used so far, good flavor & set up nicely.  After reading most of the reviews I also changed the original recipe a tad. I used fresh picked cherries, 5 cups, to fill my pan, then adjusted from there by adding to the starch, almond extract (which I love in this pie) and used only 1/2 brown-1/4 white sugar since my cherries were sweet. Made the crust, easy to make (added a hint of almond ext) and tasted good. A great recipe. It's a keeper!

The crust was horribly bland. I reduced the sugar to half cup. It was too small of amount for a 9 inch pie plate so switched to 8 inch, and still there were not enough cherries.

It's a great pie and recipe too. I  did add a few things that probably shouldn't have, which is why my cherry sauce now is like jelly. Mistake #1. I used Maraschino cherries. #2. Too much cornstarch. #3. Did not wait to start boiling/cooking the cherries and sauce. #4. Crust is amazing (patted some pumpkin spice on the crust with my hands for flavor)...wait that's not a mistake...oops.  #4. Somehow I thought adding 3 drops of lemon would bring out the tartness in the cherries. #5. Next time go to the store and buy the correct ingredients. Despite the cherry sauce jelly effect, everything else is delicious, so thanks for the recipe. Oh it definitely needs tons of cherries, not two cups.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I used my favorite pie crust recipe in place of the one given here...I know it works out well. I used canned tart cherries as that what we can get. It was really delicious. Be sure to let it cool sufficiently, so it doesn't run all over. I will be making this again. Thanks.

Perfect recipe! I picked fresh cherries from our front yard which gave it that rich, authentic, heavy taste. Will definitely make this again.

Awesome cherry filling.  The crust was not good. I made it again with my own crust recipe and I had the perfect pie.

Mine didn't quite come out right (the filling was a little thick), but I don't make a lot of pies! Practice makes perfect, however my family enjoyed the fact that I made it from scratch! I'll keep trying!

Very good cherry pie recipe.  I could not find tart cherries anywhere for some reason.  Used regular cherries and I think that I could have cut the sugar to compensate a bit.  Turned out a little too sweet but was still good.

I think this recipe should call for a LOT more cherries and the sauce was very runny on mine... I didn't like the crust too much either because it had the texture of cake.  Might have just been something I did wrong though, maybe I overworked the dough, and didn't let the sauce simmer long enough...I think I'll try a different recipe though :(

I didn't have enough tart cherries to make this pie, so (at my farmer's market farmer's suggestion), used a 3:1 ration of cherries to strawberries.  You could not tell the difference; the pie was outstanding!  I cheated and used pastry from the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  I've never made, or eaten, a better cherry pie.

I've never made cherry pie before, and this one turned out pretty good. I used about 2 lbs of cherries, so I don't think the suggested amount is enough. Also, I decreased the amount of almond extract because I know it has a tendency to be overwhelming. It adds an interesting flavor that sets it apart from other pies, but I might try leaving it out next time so that the flavor of the cherries can shine through.

I was pleasantly surprised by this pie.  After boiling the cherries for 4 or 5 minutes, the sauce still hadn't thickened, so I poured some of the juice off and added 2 more teaspoons of cornstarch.  After another 7 or 8 minutes it finally started to thicken.  The final baked product was delicious - very flaky crust (though I recommend doing it with a pastry cutter rather than a mixer, as it's a very sticky dough) and perfect sweetness of the filling.  I think it'll be even better with a side of ice cream.

Awesome! I halved the recipe for the crust and it still turned out great (used premade crust for the other one.) I did pit the cherries by hand, and mashed them a little in the sauce pan. While boiling them, it seemed to me that there was going to be too much juice to thicken up properly, so I drained off a little to use as ice cream sauce. After that, it thickened up very nicely, though only after boiling for quite some time - ten minutes or so? And then simmering a little more. It was a huge hit, great consistency, awesome taste and kept well for a few days! Enjoy!

It was a good pie.  I was hoping it would be THE best.  I used 5 cups of frozen cherries with the last cup being added after the cooking process.  Right before I covered the pie with the top crust, I added an additional T. of butter.  I didn't use this crust recipe because I have a go to recipe that everyone says is the best they've ever had.

This recipe can easily be made sugar-free but substituting Splenda for baking in place of the sugar.  The filling recipe is very good and easy to make.  I bought frozen sweet cherries as I couldn't find  pitted sour cherries at the store.   Followed the filling recipe exactly otherwise - BUT - you will need WAAAAAAAY more cherries than 2 cups.  I put in 4 cups and it didn't fill up a small pie pan.  I'd suggest at least 6 cups of cherries to start.   I used the Pillsbury roll out pie crust and it was delicious.  Hubby had 2 pieces back to back which is a good sign.   I gave the recipe only 4 stars as I think the amount of cherries needs a major adjustment.  Otherwise great for my first attempt at cherry pie.  And for any diabetics, make this with Splenda and enjoy - you won't be sorry!

Loved this! Got the compliment that it was the best cherry pie they ever tasted. Do increase the cherries to about 4 cups and increase the almond to 1tsp. Yumo!

This is a good pie. But here's a heads-up for those using fresh cherries other than sour ones. I used a mixture of pitted fresh Bing and Ranier cherries. Even though I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, it was still sickenly sweet. I would recommend using 1/4 - 1/3 cup sugar if using non-sour cherries. Also, 2 cups of cherries wouldn't have been enough to fill a 9" store-bought deep dish pie shell, but 4 cups was perfect. Baked for 40 min.  Other than the sweetness, it was good with a nice almond flavor. My family liked it, though they agreed it was a little on the sweet side.

First of all, I'm not a cherry pie lover at all!!!  But, friends of our invited us out to pick cherries.  We picked 8 lbs.of 3 varieties. There weren't any bing. So, what was I to do ... I looked on Allrecipes.com and found this recipe for Cherry pie.  Let me tell you that I LOVE this cherry pie.  I used my own pie crust.  I used about 4 1/2 cups of various fresh picked cherries and increased the almond extract to about 1 tsp. The filling is perfect and I can't eat enough.  Too bad my husband is on Atkins - hehehe more for me.  THANK YOU BETH!!!

Great!! Not too much juice.. and when I cut it, hardly anything ran out. I waited a few hours to make sure it was really cooled. I used frozen cherries..fresh were not available, but it still turned out tasty. I also used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and reduced the white sugar by that much. Loved that suggestion! Try it, you won't be disappointed. So easy too!

This recipe was great. My uncle thought I made it from scratch. I used the pilsburry crust and the Oregon cherries like previous users. It was simple and very tasty. Great recipe.

I used half sweet and half sour cherries and dusted top with sugar and cinnamon.  I got tepid reviews from my cherry pie eaters in the house so I rated it a 4.  I am not a cherry pie lover but this wasn't bad and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on a hot slice this was yummy to me.

I don't actually eat cherry pie, but everyone said this was great. I used the frozen roll out pie crust and doubled the filling and used bing and tart cherries like several others suggested. I got distracted and forgot to add the butter and almond extract, but nobody seemed to notice. I'm sure I'll get requests to make this again.

Made this for thanksgiving and LOVED it. Easy recipe, and like previous reviews, I used canned cherries in water and tried one pie with frozen pie shells, and another with refrigerated (rolled) crusts, both pillsbury. The refrigerated crust pie came out better...crust was flaky and all together better. Also, used one whole crust to cover filling...YUMMY!

1  - 14.5 oz can sweet cherries
In place of the white sugar:
1/2 c. granulated sugar
1/2 c. brown sugar

This was the best cherry pie.  My family loved it and my 4 yr old couldn't get enough.  The only thing that I did different was use premade crust from Krogers, the rolled out kind, that was the only change and it was a great pie.

Thank you for my first successful pie!  I made two - one with 2 cups frozen cherries (couldn't find fresh) and 2 cups fresh cranberries, and one with 4 cups cherries.  Both are perfect.  I was so excited when I cut into it and it didn't run everywhere.  I'm pastry challenged, so I used a refrigerated pie crust.  This was really simple and I can't wait to serve it tomorrow!

mediocre - cherry filling is far to sweet and the pasty is too greasy.

I did use van cherries which are on the sweeter side, next time I will use half the sugar and boil longer...I had so much 'juice' left over that I strained it and it made a wonderfull cherry sauce for ice cream.

Made this today for my husband and he loves it.  I really don't like fruit pies much so I thought it was ok.  I used 4 cups of fresh local sour cherries.  I will make again (for the hubby).

This was delicious! My Dad has cherry pie every year on his birthday, and he really loved this recipe! I used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust from this website, with butter instead of shortening, and I cut down the sugar to 1 cup. For me, it was still too sweet - I think I could've used 3/4 cup sugar. But everyone else seemed to love it as it was. I only used two cans of tart cherries, but I think it could have used 2 1/2 to 3 cans, if you like your pies to be rounded and full. Thanks for the recipe!

Once again, allrecipes.com and the contributors made me look like a real cook!  I used canned cherry pie filling and 1 cup of fresh blueberries.  The almond extract was the perfect addition to pull the flavors together and mellow the tartness of the cherries.  I used a different crust recipe and did the lattice top.  It passed the mother-in-law test with flying colors.  Thanks!

Very good recipe.  Husband (who is the cherry pie fan) gave it 4.5 stars.  I use deep dish crusts and pans, and think 1.5 times the recipe would be perfect for a deep-dish pie.  I used Pillsbury crust and followed the filling recipe exactly.

Oh my.....I made this for Thanksgiving and just loved it as did everyone else who had some.  My favorite pie this year.  I used my own crust and 2 jars of tart cherries well drained.  It wasn't a very full pie, but it really made up for it in taste.  Yummy!!

This is the best cherry pie filling recipe I haav found!! The almond extract gives it that extra kick.  I was not thrilled with the pie crust, but I have made the pie filling several times, my husband can't get enough.  I like to make with fresh tart cherries when they are in season and freeze to enjoy later.

I got RAVE reviews on this pie. To be honest, I don't like cherry pie in general, so I didn't think it was that great. I made it for my boss's birthday at work and everyone loved it, including my boss. That made me happy :)

The pie crust was good and making the pie was very simple.  I didn't think there really was enough filling though... if i make it again, i'll get more cherries.

Fabulous!!!! I added about 1tsp of vanilla as per a suggestion from a fellow reviewer and I only put about half a cup of sugar and it came out really great. Oh yah and I put 3 cups of cherries and 1 cup of blueberries. Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a good and easy cherry pie recipe.   I took a look at this one because of all the ratings.   I did make a little change in it.   I used Golden Cherries instead of the bing cherries.   And if it was not for the color you you not even know the different in the flavors.
Good pie !!!!!!!

I made this pie for my fatherand a friend. Both said the pie was delicious. I didn't make the crust because I didn't have time, so I used a store bought crust. I also used a crumb topping. Everyone loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

I have to honestly say this was an wonderful pie. I used oregon red tart can cherries in water and it came out really good. I completly forgot to put the butter and extract in the cherries but it turned out tasty without it. The crust was really flakey and easy to make so thanks for sharing.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought the crust recipe called for way to much shortening. I had to add a lot of flour. For those starting the recipe, cut in the shortening a little at a time (probably using 1/2 cup). Use the pea size crumbs as your guide. Also, if you follow other reviewer's suggestions of leaving the cherries out of your saucepan mixture, be aware that you are eliminating a lot of the juice you would otherwise cook out of the cherries. I would add at least half of the cherries, otherwise the cornstarch mixture becomes way too thick and may cause problems. I cut the sugar nearly in half and thought it was great.

This pie is simple and terrific.  I had never made a pie before and it turned out great!  I took the advice of the other reviews and used 4 cups of cherries.  I also cheated on the crust and used pilsburry pie crust.  Excellent!

I thought this was a great recipe for first-timepie makers like myself! However, I would make it 4 cups of cherries instead of 2, I made mine with 3 cups and it still did not fill the pie plate completely. It turned out very yummy though.

I must confess that I did not make this into a pie, but rather a cobbler. The filling is absolutely delicious! Thanks Beth!!

The pie is good, but if you prefer your cheeries to be firmer do not cook the cheeries in the sauce before putting them in the pie crust, they were a little mushy for my liking.

This is delicious.  It was my very first cherry pie and one of my first completely homemade ones to try.  The pie crust was fabulous and impressed the neighbors.  It was easy to make and flaky just as we like it.  The filling was very tasty although I had to make slight modifications but they did not affect the pie's taste.  The kids did not help but easily could have.  Yummy!
