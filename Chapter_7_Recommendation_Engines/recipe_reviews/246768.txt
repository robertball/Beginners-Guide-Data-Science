I should have cut recipe in half made way too much and the tofu made the rice too moist for fried rice!

I enjoyed this quite a bit and it's really very easy.  Things....  I only had 1/2 cup Worchestershire sauce, so I supplemented with 1/2 cup soy sauce, which cleaned me out of that too!  I marinated the tofu for an hour but I didn't freeze it first.  You just need to drain it really well.  I sauteed the yellow onion first, then added garlic, green onion, and some red pepper for fun.  Couldn't find bean sprouts so I left those out.  When I added the tofu, I put some of the marinade in there too since I was out of soy sauce to add.  It ended up being quite salty, but that's to be expected with so much soy sauce.  Still, I enjoyed it and would definitely make it again!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because two of the ingredients were optional:  mirin and sesame oil. While the sesame oil could be used in the beginning with the veggies, it shouldn't be added at the end w/the rice. I had vegan worcestershire sauce!!! I couldn't believe it when I found this recipe. We had a foreign exchange student who was going vegan and I was trying all sorts of things, glad I found it! I would have never known. OK, a few things -- first, you don't have to freeze the tofu. I even used soft tofu for this and didn't freeze it. Secondly, marinating in the soy sauce and worcestershire sauce is fine, and probably contributes to the "meaty" taste, but really tofu takes on the flavor of anything with which it is cooked, so you can just add the soy sauce and worcestershire while cooking and it would be fine. Loved the flavor of all this, and even fed it to TWO teenage boys and TWO teenage girls. Huge success and none of then even mentioned the tofu. They came back for seconds and fought for the leftovers to take home (college kids). Great job!
