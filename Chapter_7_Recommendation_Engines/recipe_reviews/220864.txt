In the time my husband went to the hardware store this was done start to finish. I didn’t follow the measurements exactly but as a guide. I think my ratio of sweet potato to squash was higher because I had a few old potatoes to use up which didn’t seem to affect the flavor at all.   The only ingredient off script I used was a little curry which worked with the other spices perfectly. 

Never buying squash soup at the store again - this was stupid easy and restaurant quality!!

Wonderful flavor. My husband does not like fruit are vegetables. This was a way to sneak in those foods. My husband loved it.

Superb and easy. I got compliments from my family members who don’t like sweet potatoes. This will be one of my Multicooker standbys.
