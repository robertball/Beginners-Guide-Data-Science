This was good, and it got eaten up entirely. I would've liked it better in the oven, but it was fine in the slow cooker. I could not get all the ingredients to fit in my "smaller" crockpot which I think is 3qt (the big is 6qt, I think) so I kept having to stir the rice a lot. In the end, the rice kind of melted by the 2nd day, and I think that's due to it being white rice in a slow cooker. I'm not really sure how to fix that other than to readjust the ratios significantly but I think it's doable if you don't think you will eat all this in one evening. It is fantastic for a large one-night meal, though.

Made as written and this had really good flavor. The one thing I did not like is that the rice disappeared. I think it needs more rice which would require more liquid. Overall a good recipe and one I will make again with a couple of tweaks.
