Very interesting, and very, very good!  I chose this recipe in the first place and decided to follow it exactly because I've come across this submitter's name several times either with her recipes or with her reviews and have always found she knows what she's doing!  If Michelleca says it, I respect it and I follow it!  I used this batter for muffins and baked them at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes.  What the avocado doesn't contribute in flavor is more than made up for by what it contributes in richness and moistness.  Because it is a neutral flavor the bread (or muffins in my case) picks up the flavor of whatever additions you make. In this case the orange flavor is prominent with a hint of cinnamon and spice - very pleasant.  It is the addition of the orange zest, pecans  and raisins that really make this extraordinarily delicious, and I would suggest not to leave any of it out.  The bread is not quite green but definitely a different color. It is beautifully flecked with the pecans, nuts, raisins, and specks of orange zest and green avocado. I loved the recipe just as written but the mildness of the avocado lends this to any number of flavor or fruit variations.  I topped the muffins with sparkling sugar before they went in the oven, which gave them a sweet, sparkly crunch.  Once again, Michelleca, you have come up with something good!

Excellent bread.  I made it in a decorative bundt pan, precut it and dusted it ith a light sprinkle of powdered sugar. Crowd favorite.  Try using macadamia nuts, wonderful addition.  Mine came out quite green, but you can add a few drops of food coloring to achieve that if desired.  If you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can use 1 Tbls of vinegar in the milk.

I gave this recipe 5 stars not only because it tastes great (much like zucchini bread), but also because it's a terrific way to use those just-about-ready-to-toss avocados! I only had 2 avocados (equivalent to about 1 cup mashed) so I added some applesauce to extend it. Also, in keeping with the "green" theme, I used pistachios and omitted the raisins. Might be fun to make it red and green for Christmas and use dried cherries!

GREAT BREAD!!  This recipe is fantastic.  Do not let the word "Advocado" (use Haas Advocado's)scare you away from this bread.  This is very sweet and for added taste I added an orange sauce and whip cream.  This is a must try  and if you have any reservations put them aside.  Thanks for something different and exciting.

This idea behind this recipe intrigued me... It's a different but delicious taste- I enjoyed it a lot- added more raisins as well as some more chopped pecans- my mother did comment, however, that it tasted too much like allspice- maybe I'd lessen that if I was to make this again.  It's a unique bread- one that I don't think would go unnoticed if served- I definately don't think I wasted my time making this.

I have an avocado tree in my back yard and didn't know what to do with them.  Found this recipe and loved it.  Made several loafs for gifts this year.  Not one complaint!!  In fact everyone has asked for the recipe.  I did make some changes.  Added more raisins and more nuts.  Did not use allspice or orange zest but added more cinnamon. Making several more and freezing them for later in the year.

This bread was such a surprise.  I was of course apprehensive, (AVOCADO BREAD?!?) but had to try it after reading the reviews.  Excellent.  The avocado, while absent in taste, provides an excellent creamy texture.  I love avocado, but you could really hardly taste it.  If it's similar to anything, I'd say banana nut bread (which I actually hate), but MUCH MUCH better.  It was fabulous, my mom has already finished half the loaf I made yesterday.  Great warm with a little butter spread on the top!

This recipe is delicious! My whole family loves it! It is a little like zucchini bread. You will not be dissapointed in this bread! I will double the recipe next time! I did not have any buttermilk so I used a half cup of sour cream and a quarter cup of milk and it turned out wonderful! Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe Michelle!!

Very moist and delicious!  I had a lot of avacodoes to use up so I tripled the batch and used walnuts that I already had in the house.  Turned out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and delicious!  It's very moist; and the pretty "green" color, is an eye catcher!  I used golden raisens; when serving to family members who don't care for nuts, I doubled the raisens.  Also increased the spices a little.
Very similar to the consistency of pumpkin bread.

I used our local Avocados (Yucatan) And so the color wasn' so green.  Noone could guess that there was avocado in this.  I was given about 10 avocados from a friend who had an excess production,  so I inmediately came to All recipes to see what recipes for avocado there were.  I made several loaves of bread and some muffins.  These were SOOOO Good!  Thanks!!

I loved this! My friends and I had an "iron chef" style potluck party where avocado was the secret ingredient (we all had to bring a dish made with avocado). Not content with making yet another sushi or guacamole dish, I searched this site with the ingredient avocado, and came across this. It was super moist and tasted wonderful - although people who don't like the spices' flavors should consider scaling them down. But for me it was delicious. Thanks to another reviewer's idea, I made muffins instead of bread, and baked at 375 for 20min. I halved the recipe and that made a dozen muffins. Like many others have said, it tastes of the spices and citrus, because avocado quite frankly doesn't have much of a taste. I've always thought that avocados are more of a texture thing than a taste thing, and this recipe really shows that; the avocados makes the bread super moist and brings out the flavors of the spices and the zest. The pecans and the raisins definitely add huge points. And finally, doesn't avocado bread just sound cool? My friends were all intrigued and the muffins were gone in no time :)

Allergic to cinnamon, so only used allspice.  Didn't use pecans, made my own buttermilk with regular milk and white vinegar, and substituted orange juice for the orange zest.  This was EXCELLENT.  Paired with honey butter recipe on this site.  Good for either as a dessert or even for a breakfast food.  Excellent way to use going-bad avocados!

This bread is so good!  It's moist and yummy.  I didn't have buttermilk like one of the other reviewers so instead I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of milk like they did and it worked great!

I really enjoyed this unique bread.  I used a bundt pan and baked it for 50 minutes, though it could have come out a few minutes earlier.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, and did not put in the raisins, but it would have been wonderful with them.  I also did not have allspice so I used extra cinnamon, and a bit of cloves, nutmeg, and ginger.  My husband loved this bread.  I bet it would be great as a cake with cream cheese frosting.  I had been looking forward to baking this bread for awhile, and actually bought the avocados just so I could do it.  I will be making it again.

Eating it right now, with a cup of peppermint and lemon tea, and my god but it is delicious.    Except for reducing the sugar by approx. one third (standard operating procedure with American recipes) I tried to follow the recipe pretty exactly, but I had no buttermilk, allspice or pecans, so I substituted milk + 3/4 tbs white vinegar; mix of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper; and walnuts. Worked out just fine. Perfect, in fact. In my opinion, twice as many nuts would not be amiss, but maybe that's just me.    One thing though, for Canadians and Euros and other logically inclined people: DO NOT TRUST THE ON-SITE METRIC CONVERTER. Check the numbers yourself.    Also: bundt pan. :D    Also, also: Yum.    Go make this. Right now. Invite your friends.

Just "ok." Moist, dense, bread, pleasant enough. I cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups and found that sweet enough.  Nice to use up avocado, but give me carrot quick bread any day.

A good recipe, but nothing out of this world.  Very moist, which I liked.  I forgot the orange zest, but it still turned out good.  Also, I used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of raisins and nuts.  Mine turned out very dessert-like, sweet and rich and gooey.  I agree with another reviewer that the avocado didn't seem to add anything, except perhaps moisture, but certainly not flavor, which disappointed me.  I feel like advertising it as avocado bread is misleading because it doesn't taste anything like it, but it's still a good recipe in itself.

YUM! THIS IS A WONDERFUL, CREAMY BREAD.  EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY WAS A LITTLE WORRIED WHEN I SAID AVOCADO, BUT THEN THEY GOBBLED IT UP - INCLUDING MY ONE YEAR OLD. I REDUCED THE ALLSPICE AND CINNAMON TO LESS THAN 1/2 TSP. BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO OVERPOWER THE DELICATE AVOCADO TASTE, NEXT TIME I WILL REDUCE THE ORANGE ZEST AS WELL.  I PUT THE AVOCADO IN THE CUSINART TO MASH IT - IT TOOK ABOUT 3 OF THEM. DEFINATELY WORTH A TRY.

Outstanding recipe with fantastic results. I've made it twice, & both times served it to company who wanted the recipe.  I omitted the raisins (personal preference) and used sour milk (milk soured with lemon juice) instead of buttermilk because I didn't have buttermilk on hand.  Will make again and again.

This was good stuff! I used chopped almonds instead of pecans and craisins in place of raisins. Other than that, I followed recipe exactly (but making the muffin version verses the loaf version).

I adapted this recipe for muffins (baked for 20 minutes). They were delicious! I skipped the pecans/raisins, because I wanted to distinguish what the avocado brought to the batter. Like others said, you can't identify it as avocado, but it brings a sweetness, richness & moistness that's wonderful. These muffins need no additional flavor to stand out, although I'm sure they taste good with fruit & nuts as well.

Delicious!  I made double this recipe with whole wheat flour and skim milk instead and skipped the raisins.  Very moist.

I tried this recipe because I had avocados that were very ripe.  Turned out to be a really great recipe.  Everyone really liked it!  My kids (who complain about everything), my husband (who complains about everything) and my co workers (who always have "special reasons" why they don't eat whatever also ate it and raved.   I'd make it again in a second.  If your a banana bread person - try this.

I was so intrigued with this recipe name, that I had to try it.  It turned out very good.  I omitted the nuts, as I don't care for nuts, but everyone here loved it.  And it stayed moist for a long time!

This was a very interesting bread which got mixed reviews around my table.  It was incredibly moist and flavorful but some were put off by the overwhelming presence of the nutmeg.  I used golden raisins and pistacios.  Not sure if I would make this again just because not enough people in my family liked it.

Delicious.  I substituted soy milk with vinegar for the buttermilk.  I didn't have any orange zest, but it was delectable without.  Great recipe!

Very moist and sweet.  Interesting color.  I didn't bother putting in the pecans, and I think if I make this again I'd leave out the raisins because I just didn't think they added anything to it.  I may have added more avocado than called for--I just mashed up an entire avocado and didn't bother measuring.  I scaled the recipe to make one loaf.  Good, though, and different.

Good--but the flavor of avocados is so mild that you could hardly taste it. It tasted like zucchini bread to me. I will try making it again and adding more avocados (I used two, maybe three would be better?), because whenever I did get a bite with a bit of avocado in it, the bread was creamy deliciousness. Thanks!

This is a very delicious bread recipe.  I made it with some avocados that were sitting in my refridgerator and that were starting to get overripe.  It took about 2 and one half avocados to get the 1 and 1/2 cups of mashed avocados that this recipe requires.  I used a little less sugar than the recipe required and used bread flour instead of all purpose flour.  Instead of the pecans, I used pistacchios and almonds and left out the raisins.  Everything else in the recipe, I followed.  After I baked the bread I gave a slice to each of my parents and they both thought that it was zucchini bread and said it was great.  The bread turned out golden brown on the outside and very moist and green on the inside, with a flavorful sweet taste.

Sounds weird but was really quite good!  The bread comes out only slightly greenish with little green bits strewn through it, I guess it wasn't as green as I had expected (this is not a criticism, merely an observation).  It is extremely moist.  It doesn't really have a particularly distinct avocado flavor though - it just pretty much tastes like *any* typical spice bread to me. I think next time I make this I will try pistachio nuts and yellow raisins, both for flavor and to keep with the greenish color scheme of the loaf.

WOW, so moist and dense!
I had to make some substitutes as we are moving and I was trying to use up stuff I already had. I used cranberries , lemon zest and coconut milk instead of the buttermilk. I didn't have any nuts, however I can see how a nutty taste would definitely add another level. When the bread was done and still warm I topped it with a mixture of lemon juice and sugar (mix together in a bowl first) which forms a nice little sweet crust on the top when the bread cools. This is definitely a winner in my books!

What a surprise! It is very good. I used just over a cup of avocado since that was all I had and I added just a small amount of sour cream to make up for it and no nuts. Baked in a Bundt pan for just under an hour and it came out great. My family loves it.

I thought this recipe sounded really interesting, so I decided to try it! I used whole wheat flour and only 1.5 cups of sugar. I also skipped the orange zest and used greek yogurt instead of buttermilk. They turned out really thick, moist, and delicious! I also made them into muffins. I made 24 muffins for around 130 calories each, not bad at all for a muffin!

I modified the spices slightly (reduced Allspice and added nutmeg) and use soy milk due to allergies. I made muffins and baked at 375 for 20 minutes as suggested in other reviews. Sprinkle some raw or Maui sugar on top and you've got a family favorite!

Beautiful recipe! Should have kept an eye on the time...the top spent just a little more time in the oven than needed. Tasted great...really a healthy snack. I cut down the sugar by a half. The spices smell and taste great as well. Mine did not turn out green though;)

Loved it!  I took some to work and when I told everyone that it had avacado in it could not believe it.  I highly recommend this recipe.  This is a good one to have kids help with.  I had my 11 yr. old daughter zest the oranges and pour in flour and milk and my 9yr old son helped with the mashing of the avacadow.  It was great family time.

This recipe really peeked my curiosity. I omitted the raisins and didn't have buttermilk but did the milk with a tbls of lemon juice thing and it came out beautifully. This bread comes out looking and tasting wonderful. The bread has just the right amount of density and looked good enough to give as a gift.

Like naples34102 when I see a recipe by michelleca I feel that it will be a good one. I also like to try anything that naples34102 has made a comment on as I value her comments as with micheleca's recipes. Keep them coming girls as my house never smells as good as when I'm making your recipes either just for home or for guests, as I know they'll be exceptionally received. Again THANKS.

I love this stuff.  The kids, not so much.  It can be a little dry depending on the size of your avocados and getting the mix just right, but a warmed up slice with a little butter on it is great.

Very tasty. I only used 1.5 cups of sugar and replaced the raisins and nuts with dried crannberries and sunflower seeds because that is what I had on hand. It took a little under an hour to cook. I will definatley make this one again.

This was a delicious quick bread with a uniquely nutty flavor from the avocados. Very good toasted with a little butter. It is a more expensive quick bread than most, due to the cost of avocados (up to $2 each near me!). I would make this again for a treat.

I replaced a cup of AP flour with wheat flour and substituted golder raisins for the pecans. I had larger than average avocados so I ended up using about 1 per loaf (I made 4 mini loaves). The bread turned out extremely dense, moist and delicious. Like most people have said, it doesn't taste much like avocado, but some of the bigger avocado chunks that weren't completely mashed turned out beautiful in the bread, looked like bright green pistachios. My 1c wheat flour substitution probably took away some of the sweetness so could use some more sugar next time.

I am so pleased with the way this bread turned out! I LOVE avocado and am always looking for new recipes in which to use it. This was perfect! I omitted the raisins due to personal preference and substituted plain fat-free yogurt for the butter and used 1 1/3 cups each of whole wheat and all purpose flours. Everything else was by the recipe. YUMMY!! I think I've eaten half the loaf already! Thanks for this delightful avocado recipe.

I like making bread with all sorts of fruit (cantaloupe's really good) and one day I thought, why not avocado? I was surprised to find there was actually a recipe for it. I only wanted to try it out so I cut the recipe down to 1/3 and baked it in a mini loaf pan. I substituted applesauce for butter and used soymilk + lime juice to make my "buttermilk" and added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon (I love cinnamon). I must've have done something wrong because it has an avocado flavor! To be more specific, like the avocado eggrolls from The Cheesecake Factory. My sister agrees. Mmm... it's good. :)

It turned out good! My husband liked it. But strangely, I ended up with too little batter and the bread came out a little thin.

This bread was delicious and so moist, it does taste like a zucchini bread. This is a perfect recipe for those avocados that are getting too ripe.

After my alterations I loved this recipe. But before my adjustments it was appalling. The sugar content was so high that it was more dessert than anything else. It was rather nauseating to eat and I had to throw it out. The next time, I cut the sugar down to 1 1/3 cups and it was still super sweet, so I then added a grated carrot and some ginger. My husband is the pickiest eater I know and completely loathes avocado. I think I’ll try to tweak this recipe again to see if I can turn it into a healthy bread. But as it was, after my changes my husband couldn’t stop raving about the bread and has said it’s his favorite bread I’ve ever made. Overall, I’d say this recipe was a fantastic starting point, but that the recipe itself fell short.

My landlady gave me 4 avocados and they all got ripe at the same time.  So, I needed to use them.  One can only have so much Guacamole!  This came out so moist and delicious.  I couldn't taste the avocado, just the subtle spices.  I cooked it about 10 minutes less than the specified time and it came out perfect...golden on the outside and most on the inside.  I'm making two more loaves today.

A great way to use an avocado that doesn't involve a smoothie, salad, or guacamole!  The orange zest really makes this.

This is a pretty good bread. It wasn't my favorite but when I served it people said it was good. The greenish color was a little weird for some people until I explained it was Avacado bread. Everyone said "Avacado bread?!!! Really?!" Ha! I always make breads and I've tried tons of 5 star recipes.. This just didn't quite make it in my book. Oh, well. There's a million wasys to make bread and at least I can now say I made an Avacado bread!

Great idea! I also cut the sugar down to a cup and a half, omitted the buttermilk substituted with Greek yogurt, omitted raisins and added chia seeds instead and cut the cinnamon down to 1/2tsp and the allspice to 1/4tsp. Definitely going to be making this often! Thank you ??

Interesting is a good word for this. I like it but mine definitely has the flavor of avocado....maybe if I had mashed it a little better it would have blended more. It's not a bad thing that I can taste the avocado its just a unique combo that I'm not used to yet. Still give it 4 stars!

Very good! I wanted to do something with my extra avocados before they turned rotten and gave this a try. I made it exactly as it is written and it turned out perfect! It does taste similar to zucchini bread, like another reviewer mentioned.

Pretty good! I initially made this long time ago, and they came out really flat. I guess that was my problem because this time they came out pretty fine. I used walnuts instead of pecan, omitted all spice (didn't want my bread too spicy), used light olive oil instead of butter, used only about 2/3 of sugar called for, and added some chopped apples. I like the final products and will continue to use oil instead of butter to feel less guilty. :)

Not my favorite flavors.  But it was something to do with leftover avocado.  By chance a lemon glaze (sugary sweet) landed on a bit of muffin.  I would suggest adding something like this as a topping or serving it with a sweet spread.  Or perhaps I just have an unquenchable sweet tooth!

This bread is a great treat! It is fun to make for friends. I like to give them a slice and ask them what they think it is. Everyone is always shocked that is is avocado, then they ask for more.

I have always loved making quick breads because they are typically a great way to get rid of too much or overripe produce...bananas, zucchini, etc. This bread is perfect for using up my extra avocados when they're just a little too mushy. The texture and flavor is great, and it keeps/freezes very well. I never have buttermilk, so I followed in the footsteps of some other reviewers and used 1/2c sour cream with 1/4c milk and it worked well. This is a new staple for me :)

I liked the moistness, although it kind of fell apart. Also, it tastes, not of avocado (which I couldn't taste at all), but of orange zest. May try it again, but next time, I might try much less orange zest and more cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg.

Maybe I have an extra tastebud -- or am missing one -- but I did not care for this.  So strange, since other reviewers seemed to love it.  It had a weird, bitter aftertaste.  Luckily my husband liked it -- so it must just be me -- otherwise I would have tossed it.

Eh, I was disappointed - after reading all these reviews I expected it to be delicious.  It is unremarkable in my opinion.  Moist and similar to a banana bread, but not as good.

My Friend,Family & Co-workers were all excited to taste Avocado bread.....and they all loved it!!  Not only is this loaf moist and so tasty but the aroma while its cooking is mouth watering. The only slight change I made was the buttermilk , I used sour milk instead and didn't add any raisins.

4.5 stars.  Did 1 loaf (cutting things in half was irritating because of the irregular amounts- like 1 7/8 of a cup).  I did 1 egg and 1 egg white and decresed the sugar to 3/4 of a cup.

This is a really great moist bread. It turned out better than banana bread. I did not have raisins so i put dried cherries. It worked wonderfully. I will definetly make it again. I also like that you make 2 loaves. Thanks

Very tasty moist bread, nicely spiced as well.  I did cut the sugar back by using a touch over half a cup of sugar (but I halved the recipe too since its just me and my husband).  That would make it a little over a cup of sugar for the full recipe.  The sweetnees was fine, in fact if I had used what it called for, it would have been TOO sweet.  Thanks for a great idea to use your avocados!

Moist, tender, and scrumdiddlyumptious. My family was definitely skeptical but it is GREAT.   I cut the sugar down to a cup, and added less allspice as others recommended. I also used lemon zest instead of orange zest, and I think next time I will definitely use more nuts!

I'm going to start by saying that I've made some alterations....but followed the basic recipe and it can out great! It didn't taste like it had avocado in it at all. It kinda reminded me of pumpkin bread. I will definitely try again!

Great recipe!  I found this recipe because I was trying to use up some extra buttermilk and leftover avocados (what a combination).  I made just a couple of changes.  I added 1/2tsp of nutmeg + 1/4 tsp of all spice.  I wasn't paying attention when I picked up the nutmeg but it tasted pretty good in the end.  Didn't have raisins so I substituted dried cranberries in place of raisins.  Also, I only had one baking pan so I used the other half of the batter to make muffins (12 medium-sized  muffins).  I put them in with the bread and baked them for 25-30min.  Very pleased with the results . . . super moist.

Strange, but pretty good.  No real avocado flavor or color, but a good quick bread.  The loaves were a little flat/small, so not terribly pretty to look at (or give as a gift), but they tasted good.  I used pistachios.

I really enjoyed this bread - what a great way to use up left over avocados!  I'm definitely going to keep this one around to use again.  It had great texture and the raisins and nuts in it were fabulous.

This tasted like a loaf of spices and sugar. I doubt it'd have made a difference if I'd completely left the avocado out of it. I certainly couldn't taste them at all.

These were much better than I expected. I made half the batter into a loaf, and the other half into cupcakes and topped with cream cheese icing. Even people who aren't very vegetable-friendly loved them! I prefer it in loaf form, but for company, the cupcakes were perfect.

After an over-exuberant trip to the farmer's market, I found myself with way too many ripe avacados.  This was the perfect way to use some of them.  My kids couldn't get enough of this bread!  I ended up making two batches- two loaves were eaten almost immediately, the other two were frozen for later.  Perfect.

I made this recipe exactly the same.  It worked out, but I prefer both banana and zuchinni bread.  It's one of those recipes that tastes great right out of the oven because it's fresh and warm and has been smelling good... but when you taste it the next day you realize you had yourself deceived. I don't think that the avacado contributes to the recipe... it is just an extra.

Very yummy.  I substituted the buttermilk with milk to which I added 1 tbsp. lemon juice, and I put 1 c. wheat flour in place of 1 c. of the all-purpose.  I used a bundt (tube) pan and it baked in about 45 minutes.  I also only had about 1 c. of avocado (about 1.5 avocados) so I made up the other 1/2 cup with a mashed banana.  I would prefer using all avocado in the future, b/c this tastes a bit like banana bread of course, but it's still good.  You wouldn't even know avocado is in there except for the very slight green tint (which is even less b/c of the banana I used).

I was a bit leary of this recipe but had aome avocados quickly going bad. I substituted mini chocolate chips instead of raisins to intice a picky child. I didn't mention that it was made from avocados because I'm the only one that likes them..I called it chocolate chip nut bread. I made mini loaves and we ate two at dinner. It was a huge hit with everyone. Personally, I think I would've liked it better without the chocolate chips but it was still pretty good with them. It has a creamy subtle taste that would be hard to place if you weren't aware what is in it. Love this bread, I won't hesitate to make it again. Mine had a very light green tint.

I made this two times.  Both times I only had one avocado.  The first time I just substituted banana and the second time I used ripe plantains (the peel is completely black).  The plantains in the bread added a nice complement to the avocado. One of my favorite recipes.  My neighbor has  been bugging me to make it again!

The batter tastes wonderful but when I baked it, the bread turns out to be bitter.  I dont know why.
