I love garbanzos, I love peas; this was a perfect recipe for me!  Delicious!  Some minor adjustments:  I doubled the peas to 1/2 cup, and reduced the olive oil to 4 T.  In addition to tasting wonderful, the salad looked beautiful as well, and I think it would make a nice side dish for a summer bbq.  Of course, with all the garlic and onions, I should probably put a bowl of mints right next to it!  Thanks!

I skipped the peas. The garbanzos alone were really good, but I think I added more onion than I should have. Definately a nice chilled bean salad that will go in the recipe box!

Quick & easy meal! I didn't have onions nor garlic, so I used onion & garlic powders. I added one can of tomatoes with onion & garlic, decreased the oil to 4 tbsp (btw...that's 1/4 cup) and increased the peas to about 1 cup.

Loved this! I added diced orange bell pepper for a little extra texture and flavor. I increased the cayenne pepper a tad and as other reviews did, I also increased the peas to 1/2 cup and decreased the olive oil to 3 Tbsp.  Ate as a side dish, but could definitely eat as a snack as well. Yum!

I cannot keep my spoon out of these!
As is, they are perfect but I spiced them up to my liking and added a shook of Italian seasoning in addition to the oregano.  Along with some roasted brussels sprounts, these made a lovely little mini-meal

These are a delicious side and even better the next day!  It's one of those where you can add more of what you like - i think i added more garlic, onion and red pepper flakes.  So easy; definitely a winner.  Thanks!

This was a great weeknight picnic recipe. Simple and quick and lots of flavor. I also decreased the amount of olive oil and increased the peas to 1/2 cup. This is definitely a keeper.

Was looking for some healthy snack/side recipes using garbanzos and came across this.  It is delicious!  I didn't have lemon so I subbed lime juice, ommitted the peas (don't like frozen peas) and added a little less olive oil and a little more salt.   Made them last nigth and marinated overnight to bring to work with my lunch and they are absolutely wonderful!

I thought this was a good basic recipe, but it lacked a little luster as it was, so I rated it a 3.  We added Feta and added sea salt.  With these adjustments it made it a 4 star.  I will definitely make it again since I almost always have it's ingredients on hand.

This was a pretty good salad.  I followed the recommendations, less oil, twice as much peas.  I didn't have cayenne pepper seasoning so instead I used a Hot Mexican Chilli or something weird I got out of the spice aisle.

Tastes healthy and good I think!

This was a very tasty dish. I'll admit I didn't have the onions, garlic or lemon juice and I substituted powders and lemon pepper instead. The lemon pepper was a bit much but I get the idea and it is yummy! I used 4 T. of oil and I found even that to be a bit much.

Family really liked this.  I used edamame instead of peas and I had to increase everything because in Canada our tins of chickpeas are 19 fl. oz.  So once I had it all together and tasted it, it needed more of the spices.

I will definitely make this over and over again! I didn't have lemon and substituted lime juice and it was amazing! My brother loved it and suggested that I add bowtie pasta and maybe some peppers. I'll do that next time. I think this recipe is beautiful as is and there are also unlimited ways to "tweak" it depending on what I have on hand. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the peas and reduced the oil to 2 tbsp, 5 just seemed excessive. I thought it was too oregano-y but my family loved it so... four stars.

My Mum and I love this recipe.  We changed it up a little, adding 1 cup of cooked couscous, more peas and a some celery and dash of white wine vinegar.  Exceptional!

I'm transitioning into becoming a vegetarian, and this recipe has convinced me that not only is being vegetarian healthy, it's delicous! I used 1/2 cup of peas and only 2 T. olive oil. I think adding chopped tomatoes in the summer would be lovely.
