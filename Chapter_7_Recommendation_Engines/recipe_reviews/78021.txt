LOVE this salad, I have made it about a half dozen times now, and I just can't get enough. I add about 3-4 oranges,   add a cayanne kick in the salmon coating, and cut down on the oil a little (only for diet reasons), but otherwise make this recipe just as is...IT'S AWESOME!!, thanks so much for sharing!

I was surprised how well the cumin-crusted salmon went with this salad since cumin and balsamic don't seem like the idea mix in my head. But it provided a really good kick that tasted great. :-) Will definitely make this again in the future.

What an amazing dish! The salmon had a wonderful earthy taste and the salad was light and full of different flavors. I don't want to change anything!

This salad is to die for and has become my favorite salad of all time!  All of the ingredients go so well together it's all I can do not to lick the plate.  I make two changes to this salad when I make it.  1) add avocado, 2) make extra dressing.  Ugh!  It's so good!

Loved it.  This was a light and delicious summer salad.  I adjusted the dressing because I had no orange concentrate and wanted to cut down on oil.  I used 4 T. of fresh orange juice, about 1 T. of orange zest, and only 2 T. of oil, and also added a dash of cayenne pepper.  Only other adjustment was adding an avocado, which I highly recommend.  Delicious!

This dish is so exciting! I love the combination of salmon, spices, oranges, beans, cheese, and nuts. It's absolutely delicious. I did not have pine nuts on hand so I substituted roasted almonds. Next time I will definitely add an avocado- I'm convinced that would take it to a whole other level.

This was excellent, as well as very healthy!  I cut the olive oil in half, it doesn't need so much oil.  Also, I added a little garlic powder, to the salmon seasonings.  And since my orange was on the smaller side (i did a 2 serving recipe), I added the whole orange.    Other than that, I followed it to a tee.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this salad! Fresh and delicious, followed the recipe to a "T". I think I'll try adding a little orange zest to the dressing next time, just to give it a little more orange flavor. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Fantastic! My friends could not stop raving about the dressing and the salmon. The salad seems simple enough and is a great combination of greens and herbs. Can't wait to make it again!

Instead of grilling the salmon, I cooked it in a GE Profile Advantium (120V) on speedcook mode for 11 minutes and it came out perfectly.

Just made this for a 4th of July party and it was a big hit.  Guests loved both the salad by itself and the salmon.  I would consider substituting the salmon with tuna because that would also be a great combo but I would not omit the pine nuts or any of the other ingredients.  It was a great, healthy option to have alongside the traditional barbecue items and is a great summer salad.  I can see making it all year long though - it is that good!

This was very good.  I really dislike it when someone rates a recipe after changing half the ingredients, but on this one we did make one very major substitution and one omission.  When I went to purchase salmon it was very expensive so I purchased some frozen, portioned Tuna Steaks instead and we also omitted the pine nuts due to their expense.  I was very concerned that the flavor combinations would not work with Tuna.  However, it was very good.  Our three boys (ages 8, 11 and 13) were not quite sure about the cool, pink centers of the Tuna, but they did like the salad.  I think a very small amount of feta is definitely successful here.  However, be careful not to overdo it or it becomes too overpowering.  Same with the dressing.  It was very good, but we drizzled only a small amount over the salad.  Overall, I would def. make this again, with the Tuna,  for the hubby and I.

The salad and dressing were wonderful! The salmon was just ok.  I love salmon but I don't think it was the right fish for this dish and the cumin on it was a little too strong.  I will def make the salad and dressing again though!

I was really impressed with this recipe, both the taste and the quick preparation time.  I used half the oil, skipped the feta and cilantro, and replaced pine nuts with sunflower seeds.  Fantastic!

We love this salad! It is so delicious! I grilled my salmon in a grill pan and the salmon comes out so moist and delicious! I love the cumin flavoring in this salad as well. I left out the feta cheese - b/c I don't like it - I will add an avocodo next time!

Sooo good.  I didn't have all the ingredients for the salad and dressing, so I just used salad greens with pecans and oil/balsamic vinegar...was still delicious.  The hardest part was taking the skin off the salmon - next time I'll ask the market to do it for me.

Excellent.  The combination of black beans and cumin is outstanding.  I didn't have an orange (my husband ate them all) but I did have some strawberries, and those worked great. Easy and delicious.

tried this and kids and husband alike LOVED it.  I subbed sunflower seeds for pine nuts, and added a touch of chipotle pepper (dried) to rub for salmon.

Oh my Gosh...this recipe is fantastic! I didn't have paprika in the house like I thought I did, so, I did the crust without and it was STILL delicious, not to mention, beautiful! I think next time I would add a sliced red bell pepper to add a little more color. The combination of ingrediants here, especially the feta and pine nuts, it just brilliant. I will make this again and again! Thanks!

This was delicious!  I was looking for something light and summery, but not boring and this was it.  I didn't have OJ concentrate, so I substituted lemon juice and a tsp of sugar.  Otherwise, no changes.  We loved the orange and feta together.  Will definetly make again.

Interesting spice combination that I never would have associated with salmon.  It is delicious and flavorful.  I do think I’ll reduce the cumin a bit next time.  To my palate, the cumin seems to overpower the other spices.  Regardless it is delicious.

Delicious!  Per other reviews, added 1 avacado.  Also substituted goat cheese for the feta.  Although I made the dressing as directed, plus the addition of grated orange zest, I plan to follow the suggestion of others next time by cutting the amount of olive oil in half.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Out of lemons! I needed an alternative to my usual lemon and dill seasoning for fresh salmon fillets.  This broiled salmon is wonderful!  It went so well with the basic baked potatoes and broccoli I fixed. I'll try making the salad recipe with the salmon soon.

This is my new favorite recipe! I make it exactly how it's written and it's perfect every time. For anyone who thinks cumin and orange sounds like a strange combo I urge you to try this. I have made it with numerous fish, haddock is fantastic.

This is fantastic!  Nice blend of flavors.  Thanks to reviewers for tips to cut down the oil.  Also agree that some cayenne on the salmon would be a nice touch.  This will be in the regular rotation, even though it is a bit of a pricier meal.

Pretty good!  For my "mixed greens" I used romaine along with sliced cucumbers and carrots (because this was what I had).  Liked the combo of flavours.  Grilled the salmon in the George Foreman grill (not summer at the moment) which worked well.  I have a different orange vinaigrette recipe (fresh juice, not concentrate) which I like a bit better.  Next time, I might grill the salmon with mango chutney and perhaps some cumin instead of straight spice mixture.  Overall, it is a keeper.

Outstanding.  I did use only 1/4 cup of scallions since I'm not a big onion fan.

Found this recipe because I had some frozen salmon and lettuce that I wanted to get rid of. Was highly skeptical at first considering what was, to me, a surprising combination of ingredients, but it was absolutely FANTASTIC! Used sliced almonds instead of pine nuts because that's what I had lying around, and added avocado per previous suggestions. Pan-seared the frozen salmon; this recipe seems perfect for fish that isn't fresh since there are so many flavors involved. Made this yesterday for my boyfriend, and ate the leftover salad (sans salmon) for lunch today. I swear it was even better left over! Quick, easy, delicious: will be adding this to my regular recipe rotation :)

Wow!  This was really fantastic.  I made this as a special dinner for my in-laws, who love salmon.  They thought it was delicious!  I  followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was SO amazingly good.  I only omitted the cilantro (because I don't like it) and replaced it with fresh chives.  I had to bake the fish because it was pre-frozen, and next time I'll definitely buy fresh and pan fry it.

Very yummy!  The only thing I'd do differently next time is add some avocado.

Fabulous!  My picky husband cleaned his plate! I didn't have OJ concentrate, so I used the juice + zest of 1/2 fresh orange. Delicious! I didn't have pine nuts or feta either, but used toasted walnuts (delicious) and will definitely try pine nuts and feta next time.  I also cut the oil in half for the dressing, which left it a little runny, but was perfect for flavoring the salad with a bit less fat.  This will be a new staple at our house.

This is my absolute Favortie Salmon and salad recipe.  I prefer to make the salmon hours before the meal so it can cool in the refrigerator.  The salmon is served with a platter of fresh vegetables.  The salad stands alone and is a meal in itself.  I prefer to eat the salad without the salmon because it is just too much food.
