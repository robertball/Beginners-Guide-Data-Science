This was absolutely yummy and so quick, I didn't have any peppers or fresh mushrooms, just lots of beansprouts and gr. onion, talk about a tasty meal (the sesame seeds made it).  Also, I am on a low carb diet and this fit right in, I suppose it is good for calorie counters too. Thanks Patricia

This was very simple to make, had decent flavor and did great in a pinch, but wasn't a knock-out. We probably won't make this again.

This was very good with a wonderful flavor. I used vegetable broth instead of beef. Thanks for sharing.

After all the great reviews, I had high hopes. I decided to follow the recipe exactly and make no substitutions. The consomme was overpowering and bland. We could not taste any of the individual ingredients. It definitely did not taste Asian. No one could even tell there were sesame seeds in it. Are you sure you meant consomme?

I really enjoyed this soup.  The only thing I changed was I added some fresh garlic (through a garlic press) and omitted the green pepper.  Make sure not to over cook the bean sprouts and green onion.  The texture of the veggies really makes the meal.  Good cold too.

Wonderful. I love a soup loaded with fresh veggies.  I used chicken broth instead of consomme.  I thought the soup might need some added salt or spice, but it didn't. It was perfectly seasoned.

2.12.19  No complaints from me on this soup; scaled down to two servings and thoroughly enjoyed  for lunch today.  It’s almost as easy as cooking a package of ramen (well, almost).  Only one comment, and that is I don’t think the mushrooms and red bell peppers are optional.  They’re very important not only for their flavor and texture,  but they also give this soup some nice eye appeal.   I can see this as a light dinner with some Asian dumplings or egg rolls.  Good stuff!

Quick and easy dish for the kids! Be sure to cut firm veggies small enough to cook in 3 minutes, or precook a bit. I think this would also work well with ground turkey and chicken broth. I ditched the peppers because of young ones, and put the onions in with the sprouts to mellow them. I just realized, I might have left out the water, which might account for enough flavor. Could be an idea to leave the water until last and add to your own desired concentration.

This is a really good soup! It reminds so much of a meal my mom used to make. It was basically the same ingredients, except she'd thicken the sauce and serve it over rice.   I made this recipe exactly as written. I think it's important to use beef consommé and not beef broth. They have completely different flavors. I couldn't taste the sesame seeds. Next time I will either double the amount or leave them out altogether.  It doesn't really scream "Asian" to me, but it's good nonetheless. I thought it needed a bit of salt, so I added some soy sauce and it was perfect. This would be really good with ground pork or chicken.

It was soooper easy, Flavor wasn't terrible. I used turnips instead of peppers, I also toasted up some French bread with melted Swiss to accompany. don't think I'll make it again but if I do I will definitely use less beef and a little more green onion than called for.

Super easy to make! Don't be shy about adding different vegetables, I added bok choy and spinach with the green onions and bean sprouts. The bok choy was delicious in the soup!!
