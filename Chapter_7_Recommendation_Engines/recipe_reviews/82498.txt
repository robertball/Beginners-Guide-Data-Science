All purpose flour works great!  Don't need to go out and buy "bread flour" if you don't already have it. I've made this recipe 2x now. The first time I got busy and forgot to add the raisins and cherries. But it was still really great. We ate it that time with peanut butter and jelly. This one is definitely a keeper :-)

My family LOVED this bread! I used 3/4 cup of dried cherries and didn't use any raisins. I also tripled the brown sugar and added extra cinnamon. I used a little extra milk to make up for using more dry ingredients. This one is definitely a keeper.

I made the recipe exactly as written and I thought it was very good.  However, the next time I make it, I will add more brown sugar and more cinnamon.  I may even add more cherries or raisins.  Overall, this is a pretty good recipe...thanks for sharing!

Nice texture, I used golden raisins, walnuts, and pecans.  Would definitely make again.

The measurements for cherries, raisins, and cinnamon are good.  The bread recipe itself is mediocre - dry interior, thick but not flaky crust.  I'll use these flavorings in these proportions in a better bread recipe.

We tried another similar recipe, but the bread was too dense.  This was perfect.  Very light.  I just used a 6 oz. package of goldens and cherries from Sunmaid, and it was perfect.  This is definitely a keeper!

I make this every Sunday for breakfast toast (pb&j) during the week. I soak a cup of raisins in water as I prepare everything. I use 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a little more than a tablespoon of cinnamon. because of the added dry ingredients I add a little more milk. when the bread machine beeps for add iingredients I take the dough out and hand knead the raisins and 1 cup of pecans. I then return the dough to the machine and begin salivating.

I've made this recipe 4 times. Once I made it exactly as written, next time I added chocolate chips.  It was good, but a bit heavy, and the fruit was mostly at the bottom. I've had this problem with other recipes in my machine. The third time I used the dough setting, punched it down and kneaded in the fruit by hand, let it rise and baked it for 30 min. at 350.  It was light and fluffy and delicious.  I did the same thing the next time, but added chocolate chips. This is now my favorite breakfast bread recipe.

I gave this one a try today.  Its very tasty and I love the texture.  I never tried a fruit bread before.  Next time I will mix the raisins and cherries into the dough myself outside of the machine.  Very little of the fruit made it to the interior.  They were mostly stuck on the outside and fell off when I took the bread out of the pan.

Was very thick and did not even rise. Was a very heavy bread.
