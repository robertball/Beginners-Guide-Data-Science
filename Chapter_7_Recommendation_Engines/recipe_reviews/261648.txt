My boyfriend and I had fun making this in a stovetop pressure cooker. Cooking time for us was rather wonky; I recall it taking way longer than usual to come to pressure (the nozzle rose long before the steady stream of steam came out) and so it was on med-hi heat for like 12 mins before we turned it down to cook for 6 minutes (plus 5 more for natural release followed by 3 mins of quick release)... resulting in dry and weirdly flaky chops - but the excellent flavor made up for it. We scaled it to 5, and even though we didn't have enough onions to match, it still turned out stellar. Deglazed the browned pork bits with the apple cider for the start of a nice, alcoholic (if you like that kinda taste!) gravy. Mustard really comes through. Didn't have Dijon - used brown, but Dijon might be better. Also used fresh rosemary instead of dried - very powerful flavor. Overall loved this recipe for all its fun components! Maple syrup & nutmeg used in a subtle way? Yes please.
