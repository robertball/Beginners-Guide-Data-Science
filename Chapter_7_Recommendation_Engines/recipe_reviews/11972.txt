Wonderful 'from scratch' lasagna. The sauce is very flavorful.  My Italian fioncee loved it and it was a huge hit for a party I made it for.  It even freezes well.

This recipe takes a little more time to prepare, but it is well worth it!!!!  My  family LOVED it.....!!!  I used the "no cook" lasagna for this, and I think the cottage cheese and the colby cheeses make a big difference!!!!  I also substituted smoked turkey sausage for the ground pork and it was GREAT -- and cuts the fat a little!!!!!  It definately freezes well and will be a "keeper" at our house!!!! Thank you Laurel and Holly!!!!

This is an excellent recipe.  It makes quite a bit, so you can freeze it for those days that you don't feel like cooking!!

Great taste but low rating because of the cost of the ingredients.

The sauce was just the right consistency-not too thick and not too watery, and the lasagna was as good as any I've ever made.  It made bigger than a 9x13 pan-I pulled out my big casserole for this one, and it was well worth it. I still had enough left to make a smaller pan too-which I froze.  If you go to a lot of trouble to make something this grand, you should really have 2 dishes of it because it's so good leftover.
