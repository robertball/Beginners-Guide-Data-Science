I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and I'm glad I did.  I only had 1 tsp lemon extract so I added 1 tbs of lemon zest and 1 tbs lemon juice. After tasting it I thought it was a bit on the dry side so I wound up glazing it with a combination of fresh squeezed lemon juice and powdered sugar. I liked it a lot better with the glaze.
