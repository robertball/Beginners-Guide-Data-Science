The peanut butter mixture in this recipe isn't stiff enough.  I made it as directed, but I would definitely gradually add more powdered sugar the next time.  If you do make it as is, put your toothpicks into the peanut butter balls before refrigerating.  I did this and it helped keep them on the toothpicks.  The flavor is excellent.  They're just a little difficult to work with.  I also found that the recipe makes far more than listed.  I used a small cookie scoop to keep them all the same size and I got 153 buckeyes out of it rather than the 60 stated on the recipe.

The peanut butter mixture was the sloppiest substance I have ever worked with.  It had to be frozen or it would not stay on the tooth pick.  It was incredibly soft otherwise.

I needed a lot more chocolate to coat all the peanut butter wads I had rolled which were an absolute mess.  The mixture just doesn't get firm or allow you to work it into spherical balls.  I ended up with chocolate peanut butter blobs.  I wasn't that crazy about the taste either.  I've had other people's buckeyes that have had a much more balanced flavor.
