mmhh...i just made this for dinner tonight and it was very good. I did make a few changes though because i didn't have a few of the ingredients. I eliminated the mushrooms and used celery and diced red bell pepper for the vegetables. I also used thin spaghetti instead of egg noodles. The only recommendation I would make would be to add some seasonings into the sauce for more flavor like basil or italian seasoning and some salt. The kids loved it (ages 2 and 3) and I served it with french green beans.

This is a great dish! I've made it several times and each time it gets better. 
My suggestions: I add a little bit of shredded cheddar and use thinner egg noodles. instead of the wide egg noodles. I also suggest letting it cook at a lower heat (approx 325*) for 40 minutes.
Enjoy!!!

good but it did need some extra seasonings, perhaps Mrs. Dash.   I used three-cheese Contadina brand bread crumbs.

This recipe was very fast and a great way to use up leftover ham from the holidays.  To spice it up a bit I added some dried onion flakes. It could also use some salt.

This recipe tastes amazingly rich for a light white sauce.  Definitely didn't taste like a trimmed down recipe.

I'm sorry but I did not like this.  My family thought it was ediable and each ate their helping but the leftovers will have to be tossed.  I don't know what would make this better...spices in the sauce? Different type of cheese? I guess I'll still be on the lookout for a good ham tettrazzini.  Thanks anyways.

After reading other reviews, I prepared this adding Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and frozen mixed vegetables (broccoli, carrot pearls, soy beans, onions). Still, it was way too bland. I won't make this again. It's ok if you like bland, but we like flavor. It would have been better with cheddar instead of parmesan; and the sherry was undetectable. Other than that, it still needed something for a kick. I can't put my finger on it. But it doesn't have enough promise for me to try this again in a doctored state.

My man and I are trying to eat lighter and he loved this recipe and has been talking it up. I found it kind of bland but I added salt.

I liked this recipe because it was a twist to my normal chicken tetrazzini that I make and my husband loves but...I tweaked a few things.  Instead of the bell pepper I used frozen peas and also used chopped onions.  The only beef I have with this recipe is that I would not use the cream base- substitute it with an undiluted can of soup, like cream of mushroom or celery just to give it that creamy thickness that I didn't get from what was called for.  Other than that, I would definitely make it again.

I thought this was excellent!  My fiance loved it.  I added more pepper to the flour, along with 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. italian seasoning.  Hard to believe it was light!  Thanks!

Very good, but was a little dry, so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Also added a can of peas. Topped it all off with cheddar cheese. My husband loved it!

This was okay.  I rated it as a three as it is something I would eat and tastes decent but not good enough to make again.  Only thing different I did was added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese for more flavor.  Even so, I didn't think it had enough umph!

We threw in a few changes to the recipe and loved it.  Added some diced onion and garlic, and doubled the green pepper and ham.  First cooked the green pepper and onion in the butter, then added the mushrooms, cooking until they started to give up their liquid before adding one large, minced garlic clove.  Poured off the mushroom liquid (reserved) after the garlic started to soften, then added the ham, cooking until the ham softened up.  Then mixed in about a 1/2C of flour, the black pepper, 1/4t each thyme and parsley, and cooked for a few minutes to lose the pasty-ness, before adding about 2T white zin wine, the reserved mushroom liquid, about 1C water, and 12oz evap milk; bringing to a boil to thicken the sauce before adding the parmesan cheese and 8oz spaghetti noodles.  Didn't bother putting it in the oven (we were hungry!), though that would probably add to the flavor.  Topped each serving with an italian cheese blend. Tons of flavor and so delicious.

I quite liked this - I used a whole green pepper, shiitake mushrooms, and added a shot of tobasco to the sauce, along with a small dollop of dijon mustard and some basil.  I also used more pasta than called for, which meant that I was a little under-sauced, but it was still tasty.  I'll definitely make it again - a non-detrimental creamy sauce is a good thing!

Good. Light and satisfying. Great for leftover ham.
