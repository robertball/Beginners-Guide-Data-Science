Used Old Cheddar instead. Also added sauted mushrooms and added them to the bed of rice.

Love the kick of the pepper jack! Great tasting, easy to prepare recipe. Serve over or with instant risotto rice for complete and quick meal.

This was an easy recipe to put together. I did have to make two modifications and added one ingredient. The recipe calls for mayo, and we don't buy mayo because I can't stand it. So I substituted ranch dressing, which worked well. I also substituted medium cheddar for the pepper jack cheese. And then, I added two Tblsp. of bacon bits to the broccoli and mushroom mixture for some extra protein.  Next time I will probably brush some ranch dressing on top of the chicken to keep it from drying out as it did. All in all, an excellent dinner that was easy-peasy.

Mine was a little dry, but a very good recipe. I used a yogurt mixture from a previous recipe instead of mayo. Maybe lightly brush the chicken with the mayo or yogurt in addition to the salt & pepper& paprika. I had 3 breasts and didn't use all of it in the stuffing, so I served the extra on the side with whole roasted red potatoes.

Make this dish 1st time as directed--and you'll know Nicole loves chicken as she does soup; basically simple on hand available ingredients to put together and a time-saver to cook ( earned 5 stars )---what's there not to love about this recipe?  Going in to make this a second time, I thought outside the box: I took the oven ready stuffed chicken breasts....and brush coated them with BBQ sauce, wrapping each one with 2-3 strips of thick cut LEAN bacon ( again, recipe earned 5 stars--everyone LOVED this! ) .  Oh, and if you tend to have extra stuffing mixture in your bowl, try combining it with coleslaw cut cabbage or salad-cut lettuce and crispy bacon bits from extra made bacon slices.

I followed the stuffing recipe, but filled into 2 chicken breasts, delicious! I may add more cheese and mushrooms next time, personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Maybe my chicken breasts were larger I baked an extra 10 minutes. I thought it was very good and would definitely make them again
