I won an apple baking contest at work with this recipe! The only thing I changed was I baked it in a gingerbread crust. It was very good and I'm making it for Christmas eve.

Another great recipe from Eleanor!You've outdone yourself this time Ms.Johnson! This pie was to die for!The crunchy cinnamon crumble topping was excellent. I used 3 granny smith apples diced thinly, which was slightly more than 3 cups. I was a tad surpised that the apples were somewhat crunchy in spite of the 10 minute extra baking time. Nonetheless,the filling was superb and not too sweet. I would like to caution those who are searching for a strong sour cream flavor, this probably isn't for you. The strong sour cream flavor I was looking for was not there.Perhaps the topping overpowered the sour cream flavor....but it truly enhanced the filling flavors nonetheless. This pie is a unique and excitingly outstanding new dessert that I will make again and again, especially for dinner guests,as the presentation is very beautiful as well.Thanks Eleanor.

This was my first attempt at making a pie, and it turned out great!! One of the best Apple pies I've tasted and my husband agreed. I changed a few things. I increased the sugar to 1 C. and used half brown sugar and half white. I also excluded the nutmeg and added 1 1/2 tblsp of cinnamon instead. I also coated the apple with about 1/4 c white sugar and 2 teas. of cinnamon before mixing them in the sour cream mixture. For the topping I double the amount of butter called for. Next time I will try adding a little allspice and cloves. Will make this again often!!

This was an excellent pie... different, but soooo good!  Family ate it up!  The sour cream mixture seems very runny when you pour it in the pie shell, but bakes up to have the texture and consistency of baked custard, but with a distinct sweet creamy taste.  I used a deep-dish 9" pieplate, and was glad I did, as this made a big pie. I followed the recipe except for adding about 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans and an additional tablespoon of butter to the topping mixture.  I used about 3 1/2 cups of chopped fuji apples, I did not have any pie apples on hand, I would recommend good tart pie apples for this recipe.  I also put the pie back in the oven for an additional 10 minutes at 400 degrees to brown the topping some more, I imagine you could put the topping on at the start of baking, or at least for the last 30 minutes, to get it nice and crisp. I'll make this again!

Delicious pie!  I have made this twice and the second time, I added more apple - I used about 3 large spartan apples.  I was able to reduce the fat and sugar content by: using fat free sour cream, and splenda with the apples.  I still used real sugar for the topping and it turned out fabulous!

This recipe was very easy and tasted great!  I will definitely make it again.  I suggest doubling the butter to 4 tablespoons on the topping.  This helps give it a clumpier texture.

AWESOME!! I'd been searching for a recipe close enough to a family-favorite served  at a popular pie chain. I just added six oz of fresh blueberries and chilled before serving (helped it set a bit). It was a total hit all throughout the holidays!

Just like my mom used to make and so easy!  I could hardly believe there wasn't more to it!  All the taste testers loved it.
I used 4 medium sized granny smith apples, about 5 cups worth and would probably use more next time.

I loved it.  My spouse wanted me to learn how to make this dish, and the idea of sour cream and apples didn't sound very appealing to me.  But this recipe has me devouring this pie piece after piece!

Wow!  This pie is the bomb!  I did follow some of the recommendations in the reviews 1) added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the apples. 2) increased sugar to 1 cup (1/2 cup white 1/2 cup brown). 4) sliced apples instead of chopped 3) Baking time: increased the first part to 40 minutes. 4) added pecans to the crumble topping because husband loves pecans.

This has taken the place of my grandmothers dutch apple pie recipe and I never thought that would be replaced.

Excellent pie!  One of my favorite apple pie recipes.  I don't chop the apples, but slice them like a traditional apple pie.  I also like to double the crumb topping.  My two cents on the crumb topping - I like it to be crumbly, so I do not add any extra butter.  When you are combining the ingredients, use a pastry cutter and cut into it until it has turned to fine crumbs.  This is more of a crumb topping to me than adding extra butter and leaving it in bigger chunks.  Just my opinion, though!

This pie was fantastic, and got rave reviews from all who got to share it! I was not sure about the "chopped" apples, but it worked great. I used fresh ground nutmeg, which I think adds a lot more flavor to anything you use it in. I also used a 10" pie plate, used 4 cups of apples, and added a little more flour to make up the difference in the thickening agent. It was perfect! Thank you for a great recipe that I will use over and over again!

You have to prepare your mouth for a different taste than traditional apple pie. I didn't like the first piece because I was thinking of apple pie even though I knew that wasn't what it was.  The second (and third) piece was great.  I shared with my sister and she took the recipe too.  I will make it again.

this was great exactly as written. I didn't peel apples and no one could tell. (less work for me)  I mixed diced apples with sugar, nutmeg before mixing with sour cream.  next time I'm going to add 1/2tsp. cinnamon only because I like.  but a really great, easy recipe. thanks JJohn

Very yummy and easy to make. I added a little extra nutmeg because I love that fall flavor. I also added coconut flakes because my sweetie loves coconut. It also didn't take as long to cook as it suggested so test the apple yourself to see when it's ready for you to add the topping.

I love this recipe. It's a huge hit in my family, I'm required to take it to all the holiday get-togethers. Like any good cook I changed a few things, I added an extra tablespoon of flour and 1/2 cup of apples. I used an entirely different topping, 1/2 butter, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 flour & 1/2 pecans. I think the pecans add a lot to this wonderful pie. I also extended the cook time 25 minutes at  400 degrees and 30 minutes at 350. I put the topping on in the last 15 minutes.

This pie was delicious!  Everyone was surprised when I told them it had sour cream in it.  I was out of nutmeg, so I used cardamom and I added a little cinnimon to the apples.  I used 1 1/2 giant Gravenstein apples (I think that's what they were, I picked them off an unknown tree), they cooked wonderfully. I put the pie under the broiler for 2 minutes to brown the top a little more. Thanks for sharing the great recipe, Eleanor!

I don't usually go for open-topped pies but this one is great!  You don't taste the sour cream at all in of itself - it just has a nice overall flavor.  Definitely sweet enough which I had originally wondered about...

Excellent! If you're making one, might as well make two! It'll disappear! Agree with doubling the butter in the topping. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream! Will experiment with brown sugar & cinnamon, but agree this is 5 stars w/o any adjustments.

This recipe has replaced a years-old favorite.  It's really incredible.  I too add some cinnamon to the sour cream mixture, and I add 1/4 c rolled oats and 1/4 c chopped walnuts to the cinnamon topping.  Mmm...

I always found apple pie to be okay, but this one was delicious! I added a little cinnamon to the sour cream mix, because we all love cinnamon and added another cup of apples (although if you really love apples in your pie, I'd add even another). I used the flaky pie crust recipe found on the site and it was perfect. This was definately the best apple pie I've ever had, and I will certainly make it again!

My hubby says this is the best apple pie I have ever made! I have gotten lazy and no longer make my own crusts and the boughten ones are smaller so I doubled the recipe (being rather generous with the apples) and put in 3 shells. Worked great.

I don't like apples. I don't like pie. I certainly don't like apple pie, but alas I found myself with four pounds of apples after a lovely fall day of plucking them from the trees. I saw this recipe and randomly decided to give it a shot....fabulous! I seriously don't like apple pie and this was delicious, everyone in my family loved it! Thanks for this fantastic surprise.

Loved it! I added blueberries to the pie and it added a nice touch. Also, I added some brown sugar to the top in addition to the white sugar.

i cannot stand to rate recipes poorly...but...the apples were crunchy not soft. and i even cooked it a few minutes longer. i had to cover the apples after the first 15 minutes as they started browning on top. i did like the way that the pie was firm to slice and presented neatly. the flavor was ok. but the crunchiness of the apples, not so much...

Delicious!  A few changes I made - I ran out of white sugar, so I used almost all brown, I used light sour cream, and I increased the butter in the crumb topping to 1/4 cup.  I did broil it for a minute or so to get the topping crunchy.  It was a big hit!  Then I made it again without any changes to the recipe, and it was even better!  My new favorite pie.

this recipe is great! i found that by after chopping the apples up in to chunks, if you cover them with a cinnamon and white sugar mixture, they soak up more flavor! also. add about 1/2-1 more cup of chopped apples to the mix and you want to make sure the crumble isn't too crumblee by adding enough butter! good pie. good eats!

This was a delicious change of pace from standard apple pie. The creamy texture of the sour cream is a nice contrast to the other ingredients. I did not have any trouble with the sour cream separating as mentioned in another review. I did buy name brand as another reviewer suggested. I used a frozen crust that I cooked for about half the time on the package before filling the crust.

Amazing, fabulous recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving last year with a mixture of granny smith and golden delicious apples and everyone raved about it.  I don't make the best pastry crust in the world, but this recipe more than made up for that.

I don't have good luck with pies, but my father wanted to try a Sour Cream Apple Pie and I chose this recipe.  I'm glad I did it was the easiest pie I ever made and Dad thought it was just delicious.  This one's a keeper.  Thank you Eleanor Johnson for sharing.

the only reason i decided to make this apple pie instead of the usual kind is because it got such rave reviews (people saying that it was the best applie pie they've ever tasted). someone else also said it didn't really taste like sour cream.  i disagree. it was definitely not a favorite around the house, tasted too much like the sour cream and not enough like apples.  vanilla ice cream on top helped balance out the taste.
i guess if you like this sort of pie it will be great. i just wanted to try a different spin on apple pie and this won't be something i make in the future.
it did taste better after a couple of days in the fridge though (so i heard, i didn't feel like trying it again).

I was given this recipe as a young bride and it was the family favorite for years.  I somehow lost the recipe and it wasn't until this past year I thought about searching All Recipes.  To my delight, the recipe was identical to what I remembered. My family and I are all thrilled to have this dessert back.  I use Macintosh apples and they come out nice and tender.

This is my new favorite apple pie recipe. The sour cream makes it exceptionally flavorful and it's nice having less crust to deal with. I eliminated the nutmeg and used 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon instead in the apple mixture. Also doubled the amount of butter used for the topping. Made it twice in one month it was so popular.

Made it exactly per the instructions.  Mixed red and green apples. Served it at a dinner party and it got rave reviews from my guests.  This one is a keeper and I will be making it often!!

Delicious dessert, easy to make, and family/kids loved it! Make sure you bake pie FIRST, then add topping at the last 10 minutes.

Not bad. My boyfriend liked it, although he said "The filling looks like cat food." It didn't stop us too much :)

I thought this recipe was a keeper!  Everyone at the family dinner liked it and I was asked for the recipe.  I did dice the apples quite small to ensure that they cooked through.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon along with the nutmeg. This is a nice alternative to the regular apple pie.  Thanks for sharing!

This pie was so yummy!!  We live near Apple Hill and get pies from up there.  My family agreed this was better than any pie we have every gotten from there.  This will be a new stable in our family!

I love this recipe! It is not too sweet which is important too me. I added more cinnamon than called for by putting it into the batter with the apples as well as sprinkling it on top. Other than that, no changes. This is one of the best pies ever!

This is the second apple pie I have made from this site. The first being "crumb apple pie". I personally don't care for this pie and would not make it again. It does not have that typical apple pie flavor and 'gravy' as a normal apple pie due to the sour cream.

This pie tasted very good, I just wish it didn't have to stay refrigerated, we all like warm pie.

Heaven!  I had never baked my own pie before and was pleasantly surprised at how easy this recipe was.  It turned out wonderful.  My husband and I couldn't possibly eat it all by ourselves (although we would have liked to!), so he took it to work where it disappeared in seconds!

So, So good!  No one could guess what the filling was made of.  I made it for my classes, and they loved it!  Try yor favorite crumb topping on top - the one in this recipe is not that great.
