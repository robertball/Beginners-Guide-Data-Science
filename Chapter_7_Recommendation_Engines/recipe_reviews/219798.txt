Made this for dinner last night! Was pretty delicious. I made a few alterations , I added 1 can of black beans instead of kidney beans , 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning , and fresh garlic to the chicken. I only gave it four stars because when you add the pico it made it a little salty, next time I won't add so much .

This recipe is a great interpretation of a chicken enchilada dish! The savory garlic cooking cream adding something special as well!

This was so delicious! I followed the directions up until the pico de gallo because I didn't have any. I did dice some tomatoes and put that on top instead and I would probably do the same next time. I thought I cut the chicken into small enough pieces (they were pretty small), but will go smaller next time so I can get a little bit of everything on the chip without overloading it and having too big of a bite, if there is such a thing!

My husband and I looved this recipe! It was so flavorful and was a quick, easy-to-make, with just a few ingredients dinner. We had a lil extra shrimp that we needed to use up and threw that in with everything else as well. Will keep these ingredients on hand when we need a quick dinner and don't feel like spending a lot of time in the kitchen!
