Delicious and pretty healthy except for all the olive oil! I didn't coat the chicken in flour first and didn't miss it. Also we ate ours woithout the pita and it was just fine. I think next time I make this I will make double the eggplant peppers and tomatoes and serve it as a side salad.

AWESOME! I cut up fresh red bell pepper and put them in the skillet with olive oil and garlic until fork tender. I fried up my eggplant because I didnt want to clean my george foreman. I added feta cheese & spinach and used naan flatbread from my bakery. I did use the red wine vinegar instead of balsamic & it was perfect! Topped with fresh tomato. I ate half w/ chicken & half without. I think I might turn this into a vegetarian dish & leave off the chicken. Can't wait to make again for lunch tomorrow so I can use the rest of my ingredients.

I thought this was great I didn't have red wine vinager but used white wine instead and it turned out fine also didn't have any roasted red peppers so I just excluded them and I still loved it. Even my 10 yr old ate it.

Reminded me of the flavors I had on my Mediterranean vacation - "Mezze" platters in Turkey. Also try adding artichoke hearts and feta. If your artichoke hearts/roasted red peppers are marinated you don't need to add much more of your own seasoning. I don't know why reviewers are saying to use red wine vinegar balsamic is accurate.

If I could give it more stars I would. This was DIVINE!! I followed the recipe as said w/ the exception of roasting my own red bell peppers. I didn't have pita bread so we used spinach wraps...and my daughter suggested a bit of feta which...oy was a great addition!! I think next time I will oven bake my chicken though just to get rid of some of the fat. Very good and different!! Thanks!

Made this tonight with naan bread. My family of 7 raved about it (ranging from my husband teenagers and a two year old). It's going to stay as a regular "sandwich" in this family. I served it on a bit of spinach and a little crumble feta for topping. Just wanted to add that I broiled my chicken without instead of frying it in oil and didn't bread it. I only added about a little more than a pinch of garlic seasoning on each of the breasts for a bit of flavour. This helps cut down on some of those unwanted calories & fat.

Okay here is another recipe that I walked into not knowing whether or not I would like it. I went into this kind of unsure of the grilled eggplant part but this was soooo good. It is full of flavor and the salad has a nice intense balsamic flavor that really makes the chicken pop. Per others suggestion I added some feta cheese and this made it even better. An easy meal that the whole family will love.

Made it on Sunday...everyone love it...a little too overpowering by fresh garlic on eggplant but overall were one of the successful dish. Last night my husband told that you could make it for our UFC party for friends too.

Good recipe! I did an ingredient search with chicken and eggplant and this recipe came up. It was perfect. I used balsamic because I love the flavor and also added fresh cilantro from our garden to the dressing.

I made this recipe tonight and my kids (11 and 12) and myself loved it! Tastes so fresh and full of flavor. I did top with feta and also used the red wine vinegar many suggested. I do have one question. I was confused by the first step. When you slice the eggplant and than salt it. Than it says to leave it in a colander and allow it to drain. Am I suppose to salt it than rinse it in a colander and let it drain? That is what I did because it was VERY salty if I would not have rinsed it but I was unsure. Any advice would be appreciated. Great recipe!!!

I ended up using a cherry-balsamic vinegar in spite of the correction saying to use red wine vinegar. It turned out great! I also cooked my own red bell pepper. No bother buying a can.

My family enjoyed this. I don't like eggplant very much but my husband does so I thought we would give it try. Seasoned flour with onion powder paprika salt and pepper. Used panko instead of breadcrumbs for more crunch. Great changes good meal.

Followed recipe exactly and these were absolutely delicious!! We did add some crumbled feta cheese as suggested by some earlier reviews. Even our picky 15 & 12 year olds went back for a second! Thx for sharing!

I roast the eggplant in the oven & generally buy roasted red pepper just to make it easy. The veggie mixture is divine regardless of which vinegar you use. It really is best with the breaded chicken plus feta and flat-leaf parsley with the vegetables - but grilled//broiled chicken is also good. Great for picnics!
