Loved the flavour but it was very difficult to roll the cubed bread into balls... perhaps fresh bread crumbs would have been a better option. I may try these again but with bread crumbs instead of cubes. I agree with the reviewer that suggested parchment paper as a better choice as the side that was touching the foil browned far too quickly while the other side didn't have a lot of colour. Love the concept though.

We really liked these! I did cut the recipe down, b/c that amount would have been too much for us. Very easy to make and nice flavor...reminded me of Thanksgiving. Made a great side to our roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I liked these stuffing balls. I tried half a recipe and added just a little bit of sage.  They were delicious and crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and were simple and fast to make.  I only gave them four stars, though, because I did not think they were as good the second day when reheated.  I will make them again, though.

Loved the concept of rolling dressing into balls.  We did a turkey breast for Thanksgiving & since my way of making dressing is so similar to this, I made mine. I would suggest instead to use parchment paper.  Also this can be used with other meats as something different in appearance when you want a side dish.  Loved the crispy texture.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  They were crunchy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  Everyone loved them.  I will surely be making these again!!

Yes, I made them in my muffin pans.  No rolling around on paper.  Spray pan and loosly put in pan.  Easy peasy.  Cooked a little longer than25 minutes.  Just keep an eye on them.

Family loved these.  I added an 1 extra egg and 1/4 cup of Chicken broth.  Used garlic salt rather than regular salt.  Also grabbed a bag of bread crumbs from the grocery bakery.  Will definitely make these again.

I liked the concept but that was about it.  They rolled into a ball well. I used parchment paper and didn't have a problem with them sticking. I felt they were very crispy on the outside. I like a moist stuffing. The consistency is nothing like you get with stuffing inside the turkey/chicken that is very moist.  I ended up throwing them out.

I made this the day before Thanksgiving  because I have a small oven.  They were still moist and yummy reheated.  I forgot parsley so I used the celery tops instead.   I will admit that mine didn't look like the picture but they were so good I don't care.  I love stuffing but my recipes haven't always loved me.  This is now my go-to recipe and I will definitely make them again.
