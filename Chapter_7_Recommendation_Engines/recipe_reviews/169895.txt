This was the drink of the weekend for the 4th of July.  A couple of us thought we didn't like gin so we made the first one w/ Vodka---the ones w/ gin were much better.  Everyone loved them and we will make them many more times.  Thanks!  Oh, we used Diet Squirt in place of the Knudsen's spritzer as we didn't know what that was.

Knothing knasty about it. This pleasing little cocktail was tart and refreshing, sort of like Lorem himself. Knudson seemed to enjoy it, too.
