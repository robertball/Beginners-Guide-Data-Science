Delicious, as always.  I've made this several times.  Usually with Yellow cake mix, but i've used White and Vanilla and it's been about the same each time--always a hit!  I usually don't invert it, but it's great either way.  And definitely even better with a dollop of whipping cream.  

Also, i mix about 3/4 cup of the cake mix into the pumpkin mixture--I think it gets rid of that mushy texture the pumpkin otherwise tends to have.  

I made half with pecans (was out of walnuts) and half with no nuts.  Everyone agreed it was much better with the nuts.  

I used 4 tsp of Pumpkin Pie seasoning, and it wasn't too much...could have even used more.  and i only used 6 tbsp of butter-it was plenty.

I used brown sugar instead of white and pecans because it is what I had on hand. I baked it for 15 minutes longer than called for and it turned out wonderfully.

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  The flavor was delicious but the cake was somewhat wet and mushy.  What am I doing wrong?

Wow, I just made this for a potluck and sneeked a bite out of the corner.  Wonderful.  I did not use 7/8 cup of margarine as the recipe called for but only used 7/8 stick (7 Tbs) of margarine.  It worked out great.  Thanks.

Super easy to make! Delicious, but I think mine needed to bake longer being that's it was a little squishy at the bottom.

Yum!  Outstanding dessert and I loved the use of the walnuts.  I wouldn't changed anything about this dessert at all.  The baking time was right on for me.

This is the BEST holiday cake ever!!  I doubled the ingredients and baked it in a huge roaster-sized pan, and it turned out beautifully!  I took it to our large Christmas gathering of family & friends, and everyone raved and demanded some to leave with.  Simply divine and so easy.  This is my new "traditional" dessert for the holidays from now on!

I used pecans instead of walnuts which worked great.

super good! i melted 1 stick of butter to put on top and i ended up with powdery cake mix still on top. i'm not sure how to eliminate that because i tried more butter. it is delicious anyway, so it still gets 5 stars.

This cake is amazing!  The pumpkin part is the consistency of a pumpkin pie with the amazing cookie/butter nut-type crunch on the top.  I have received rave reviews at parties and my husband requests this dessert year round.  I am 8 months pregnant and have been craving it, so I'm making it today in JULY!  It will make you think of Fall with each bite.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!

NOT for bake sales (too soupy), so I'm having to keep this for myself (oh, poor me!) I mixed some of the cake mix in with the pumpkin, baked it longer than specified and it still wasn't of a consistency that could be cut into bars. I used pecans and it worked well, although I'm sure walnuts would be great. Will definitely pull this out at thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe!

I used a sugar free chocolate cake mix, and mixed about a cup of it with the pumpkin mix then topped the rest only used 3/4 c sugar with the pumpkin and only about 5 tables spoons of butter, turned out good, kind of line a pumpkin flan with chocolate cake topping.  was short on nuts so only used about a cup of them.

I have made this cake several times for different occasions including Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, and a friends welcome home party. Everyone always raves over it and asks for the recipe. I have found, however, that if you add about 1/3 the dry cake mix to the pumpkin mixture it comes out a little better. Other than that, the taste is amazing! My friends and family were super excited to have something other than pumpkin pie for a change!

Not only was this easy to make it is the best cake/pie ever. 
Perfect for a Food Fest at work.  Still good without the nuts if you have a nut 
alergy.

This cake came out wonderful. Made this for thanksgiving and was gone pretty quick. I did mix a portion of the cake mix with the pumpkin mixture to avoid mushyness as another reviewer commented. Glad I did! For some reason the cake mix still looked powdery on top after cake was done. Is that normal?
