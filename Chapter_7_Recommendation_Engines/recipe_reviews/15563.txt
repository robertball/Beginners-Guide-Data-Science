I will double the raisin mixture next time. My batch ran short. A very good cookie.

These are good- but not a recipe to rave about. The cookie is good but not awesome, I may try again using brown sugar. Up to par with store bought raisin filled cookies- but not near as the home-made ones Im accustomed to.

I know there called spice cookies but they were just a bit to spicy I guess! Not much like a sweeter cookie that I thought they would be.

You must refrigerate the dough to keep the cookie soft. If you like extra spice you can add some cinnamon and cloves to the raisin filling, I did. This recipe made the best raisin filled cookies I have ever had. Thank you for sharing.

We liked these cookies very much.  I made a few changes.  Added 2 Tablespoons brown sugar and a teaspoon orange zest to the filling.  I also replaces 1/4 of white sugar with brown sugar in the cookie dough.  I made two dozen cookies and had just the right amount of filling.  I debated adding a bit of frosting, but my husband loved them just as they were.  The dough was a bit soft, but chilling for 30 minutes took care of that, and I suspected my change could have contributed to it.  Thanks Ginger.  These are delicious.
