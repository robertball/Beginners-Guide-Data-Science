I only used 8 ounces of small shell pasta and also used fresh baked salmon plus I added a teaspoon of dill weed.  I used the rest of the ingredients as listed.  My husband felt it was neither good or bad but rather tasteless.  I thought it was good but it could use a little more zip to it.  Perhaps more dill pickle or dill weed.  It really would have been tasteless had I used 16 ounces of pasta.

This was wonderful.  I used left over poached salmon and egg noodles. 6 oz  noodles (cooked in salty water (1 t) to give them better flavor).  10-12 oz salmon...3 servings.  Add 5 cherry tomatoes, quartered; 3 baby dills, chopped; 4 green onions, chopped; ~1/3 c lite Miracle Whip(family preference). Salt and pepper to taste. Turned out great this first time through. Gave me 3 nice servings.

This has become a standard in our house and everyone likes it, which doesn't happen very often! I do add dijon (abt 3 Tbs) and just add the mayo and dill pickles until it looks/ tastes right.  I also use the vacumn-packed package of salmon because I hate dealing with the bones, etc. in the cans. I often leave out the tomatoes because most here don't like them, but it is really better with them in. Didn't give it 5 because I change amounts and such, but it is a great basic recipe!

Very good.  After draining the pasta, rinse with cold water or it will stick together.  Also, instead of canned salmon, use some leftover salmon that you marinated and grilled the night before and eliminate the pickles.  Yummmmm. Makes me think of summer!!!

This was very dry and boring.  Chilling just made it soak up what little mayo there was.  So I about tripled the mayo.  Yes, cutting the pasta in half would help, but unlike many around here, I rate the recipe, not major "fixes" to it.  Besides, it would still be boring.

This was excellent!  The ingredients compliment that salmon, which is the star of the show.  I found nothing boring about it, as mentioned by another reviewer.  I had this for lunch today, and it was wonderful.  I also added some vidalia onion for crunch and capers instead of the pickles.

One of the best Salads I have ever eaten. You should half the maccaroni by the way. We also added mustard and dried dill to it. MMMMMM! So good!

I made this with no measuring, just put in amounts that felt right. I used left over BBQ'd salmon, used Miracle Whip instead of mayonaise, and dill pickle relish instead of diced pickles. I also used dry mustard instead of dijon. It is very pleasant.

Good as a main dish-this makes quite a bit, so if you are only serving four people, I would cut this in half.

I found this salad a bit bland and soggy.  Not terrible but not memorable. But it is very quick to make.  This is something I'd make for my own lunch but wouldn't bring to a potluck.   
I cut the macaroni in half as advised by other reviewers.  Today I'm eating some of the leftover salad for lunch, and I tried adding some dijon as suggested in a couple reviews - it really made the difference and added the zip this salad was lacking.

This is an easy recipe to prepare and to play around with.  It's quite good as is -- though you really only need half as much pasta as the recipe calls for -- but you can add other ingredients to suit your taste.  I added leftover cooked peas and 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard for a little extra tang.

We love salmon but we aren't big fans of canned salmon. With that said, this turned out good. The dill pickles complemented the salmon well.

Pretty good! Worth making. Not a bunch if weird ingredients.

I used a whole container of grape tomatoes cut in half. Also, it's 4 single green onions, not 4 bunches. [Spouse claimed it read funny ??]

Mayo soaks up so more is needed!! Adding dill weed or dijon would probably be good. I added double the pickles. Not dill, could be too sweet. Green onion is needed.

Loved it, I used a different type of noodle and instead of mayo, I used lemon juice (sparingly).  It turned out wonderful!!!

Chose this recipe because I wanted something different from my usual salmon salad recipe.  Actually I combined another recipe with this one.  It turned out great.  Used half a cup Ditilini pasta.  Added dill, scallion, tablespoon mayo and chopped dill pickle and made a dressing using lemon infused olive oil, Dijon mustard and white balsamic vinegar.  This kept salad from getting dry.  Delicious, a keeper.

My whole family loved this - my daughter even had 3rds!  It was quick and very easy to make. This recipe would be good anytime, but was perfect for a weekend lunch in the summer.

Did add more onions and tomatoes. Also used some miracle whip. Will try again and may add mote ingredients Like tuna instead of salmon.
