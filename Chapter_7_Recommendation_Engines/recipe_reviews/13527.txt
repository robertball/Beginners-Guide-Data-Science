Tasty low fat gravy after adjusting thickener. Before I even read the reviews, I knew there must be an error in the recipe. There is no way one fourth cup of flour will thicken 6 cups of liquid. The normal proportion is 2 Tablespoons flour, or 1 Tablespoon cornstarch, per cup of liquid. So, I used 6 tablespoons of cornstarch and I was pleased with the result. Instead of putting the cornstarch in the one cup of water, I used one cup of cold broth. I did not want to water down the flavor of the gravy. I was very happy to have a tasty gravy with no fat. You may also want to adjust the salt. If you are using bouillon, or canned broth, you probably do not need to add any salt. I would recommend making this without salt and adding later if you need it.

This is a great (and easy!) recipe for turkey gravy.  The only change I made was that I always use the water that I've boiled the potatoes in, instead of regular old tap water.  I think it just gives the gravy a better taste plus with the potatoes having been in the water, it might even help with the thickening.  Whether or not, this is a keeper.  

Thanks for sharing!

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer who said to feed her family of four used the 2 cups of stock, 2 Tbs of butter and 2 Tbs of flour - no water.  First she melted the butter then added flour and cooked until bubbly and resembles wet sand.  Then she added the broth, whisked and seasoned according to the recipe.  It was so very, very good...  the only thing was my family of four went right through it.  I will definitely make this again this way, but double it so there is some left over.  Thank you!

You absolutely have to degrease the turkey drippings! I think that is a step some people forget. You can put the turkey drippings in the fridge over night and scrape of the top fat in the morning, or drop some ice cubes in the drippings and it will bring the fat to the top. I didn’t have a full 6 cups worth, so I used ½ turkey drippings and ½ canned chicken broth. I also added 2 cups of egg noodles, a couple diced boiled eggs, and a can of cream of chicken. This really makes the gravy something special! Don’t worry if you don’t have the poultry or celery seasoning, just season to your taste. This is a TERRIFIC base recipe that can be adapted many ways!

This is a great recipe. However, Instead of adding the flour to water, what I do is I put 4 to 5 tablespoons of butter in a pan & add 4 to 5 tablespoons of flour to that. When it turns to a paste, then you add the stock slowly & whisk it. It's the best gravy you will ever have. No lumps or anything. It's fantastic!!!!!
If you want more gravy just double the recipe.

This gravy is very tasty. I used the drippings (about 1 cup) from the roasted turkey and 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 5 cups of turkey stock. Like other reviewers, I also have to add more flour to thicken it. I will sure make it again on every Thanksgiving to go with my turkey.

Okay, readers, I know you came here looking for something to "make that "special" gravy", but this ones a good place to start anyway. Its basic, its easy, it doesn't take anything away from the bird, and the whole family (those that love gravy with their meals, anyway) are sure to love. You simply cannot go wrong with this one. Rate it a 5 for yourself, however, keep in mind that the less amount of stress in preparation of this recipe, means that your going to have a better time entertaining and not being "the maid". Thanks again, Veronica, for bringing this one back! 
Its a keeper!

Cheers!

I was very proud of myself after sampling this gravy. A few variations though. I used refrigerated turkey stock I made last night & instead of flour used a few tablespoons of cornstarch in stock(instead of the water). I also added a few tablespoons of cream of celery soup(rather have used cream of chicken, didn't have)for flavor. This perfected my turkey dinner & my boyfriend absolutely loved it! My house still smells great! Thanks Veronica!

It was tasty, but was way too soupy per the ingredients.  Either needs way more flour or way less stock.

I have never been able to make decent gravy of any kind...this recipe is wonderful!  I make it ahead of time & then add the "drippings" from the pan in which the turkey was roasted.  I use a gravy skimmer or a grease mop to get most of the fat out of the drippings.  It is especially good after it has been refrigerated for a day or so to let the rest of the grease rise to the top.

Definitely use 6 TBS of Cornstarch (or 12 TBS of flour), or it will not thicken to a gravy consistency.  I used 1 TBS poultry seasoning, a dash of sage, a pinch of celery flakes, a tsp of onion powder and a few drops of Kitchen Bouquet (or Gravy Master) for a slightly less “yellow” appearance.  It was PERFECT, so easy and best of all, NO LUMPS!  Served over Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes or your favorite stuffing…YUM YUM!

So easy and it was nicely seasoned...and the best part?  NO LUMPS.  By mixing the flour with water ahead of time and just pouring it into the boiling stock...perfect!  I did need to increase the flour a bit since we like thick gravy.  I'm not going to fuss with pan drippings again!!

A little too greasy for us.  May try cutting down on the turkey stock/drippings and go with water.  Not bad though.

Learned my lesson on this one.  Stick with regular cornstarch gravy - didn't turn out well.  Not well liked at my dinner.  I made two gravies, this one and a vegetarian gravy and guess one was eaten (give you a hint - not this one)....

Not as good as the real thing, but I ran out of gravy before the turkey was half gone and this recipe filled in just fine.  Will use again if the need arises - and it always seems to.

This is how I make my gravy every year and occasionally just add a little dripping from the turkey. It's always been a hit. I do add a little powdered ginger for good measure.

This is a tip. Place frozen turkey parts in crock pot. Add chicken broth, ( NO WATER), seasonings of your choice. When meat is done,,remove from pot. Remove meat from bone after cooling. meanwhile,,,,The broth in the pot thicken with a butter and flour roux. Use over baked potatoes, rice, or noodles. Add meat from bone and simmer 20 minutes to add to topping of your choice.

Awesome!!!  I can never make good gravy.  I used the pan drippings.  This was easy and lots of flavor, and my husband wanted my gravy, not the store bought.  (I had both, just in case mine didn't work out).  It's a keeper!!!  I used 12 TBLSP of flour.

This gravy was really delicious and received many compliments, but it was only after much effort on my part to thicken it up. In addition to the recipe's flour mixture, I had to add two cornstarch slurries, and boiled for almost a half hour! I'm going to keep this one, but will have to work on getting it to my desired consistency.

I roast my turkey on a bed of large chunks of carrots, onion and celery, as well as the neck bone and all the giblets(innards) and a few cups of chicken broth. When the turkey is done and out of the pan, I strain the vegetables and remove the fat from the drippigs. Then I simply put some of the liguid in the food processor with a few vegetables, the 'meat' I've removed from the neck bone and the rest of the giblets, adding more vegetables and liquid as necessary to make a thick but pourable paste.  When all the giblets have been processed, I transfer that to a pan and slowly whisk in the remaining liquid plus a touch of Kitchen Bouquet for a nice rich color and bring it to a boil.

This is NOT for the faint of heart who can't stand to think of those giblets let alone touch them and it is quite a messy job as well. BUT this is absolutely, hands down the most perfect rich thick tasty turkey gravy you will ever wrap your lips around.  There is no need to add flour or seasonings or ANYTHING: you have it all there ready to be used.

My Grandfather, who was a master chef, made it this way. But, of course, he didn't have the convenience of a food processor: he did it all with amazing knife skills.

I made changes per some other reviews.  I used 5 cups of stock, 5 tbsp of butter and 5 tbsp flour, no water. Melted the butter then add flour cook until bubbly then added store-bought chicken stock(whisk) and seasoned.  I liked the fact that I could make this before the turkey was even out of the oven, and it seemed easy to get it smooth (no lumps)! but in terms of taste, I think the old-fashioned gravy made from the turkey drippings is a bit better.  Also, I thought the seasoning here made it a touch too salty.  I would make this again but would cut back on that tsp of salt.

Just tried this for the first time, and it was wonderful AND easy!  I had to use more flour than in the recipe, though.  If you plan to use drippings from the turkey for stock, put plenty of water in the pan with the turkey and skim it very well.   My gravy wasn't the slightest bit greasy.

I think any time you are using pan drippings the gravy tastes excellent.  However, if you only use the flour amount called for, no way is it ever going to be thick.  Use about 1.5 tablespoons of flour per cup of liquid.  Also definitely don't forget to degrease the stock--putting it in the freeze for a few hours immediately works to bring the fat to the top if you are in a pinch for time.

Simple, goodness on top of your potatoes! I used the stock and drippings in the bottom of my roasting pan from a 15lb turkey. I actually thickened it up using xanthum powder from the health food store; more fiber, no lumps and it works faster! I'll use this next year too.

I made this for Thanksgiving and I agree the proportions are way off....well that is unless you like very watery gravy...and would equal a three star.  My daughter was making this..per recipe, and when I saw it, I was like waaayyy to thin.  My Mom piped in with "don't panic...mash some butter with some flour and add it to the gravy...whisk it in there and this way you won't get lumps"  Only her!  Anyway it made for a tasty gravy with the addition of the extra flour.  Next time I will make the rue first and then add the stock and potato water.  Thanks Veronica.

I used as much turkey drippings as i could and supplemented w/ chicken stock. It is a great gravy, but the proportions are wrong.  I used 1 Tablespoon cornstarch, per cup of liquid as suggested by an earlier review.

I adjusted this recipe a lot bc it's just my boyfriend and I plus it seemed like it would be too watered down. I melted 2 tbsp of butter and stirred  in  2 and a half tbsp of flour. Poured in 1 can of turkey broth ( 2 cups) and a touch of celery seed and pepper. stirring until thick enough.

This was OK but I needed to increase the thickener.  Although it had good turkey flavor, It still wasn't my mom's gravy.  Her's would rate 10 stars.

I gathered up all my recipes for thanksgiving off this website and while I was cooking, realized I didn't think about the gravy. I am a decent cook, but not one to really use recipes much, unless we're trying something new. I was confused by all the recipes said turkey drippings and I had a lot of broth and whatnot in my turkey, didn't know how to figure out what was the "drippings", lol. This recipe saved me since it said to use the stock, followed the recipe just like it said, but added a little more flour based on other reviews. The gravy turned out DELICIOUS! I will definately keep this in my recipe box and make it again next year!

I have never been able to make gravy from scratch until I tried this recipe this year! The only problem I had was getting it to thicken up, but I added more flour and some cornstarch, as suggested by other reviewers. But after that, the whole family loved it and it tasted great! Thanks for helping me get over my string of gravy disasters :-)

This recipe was not good.  The seasoning was fine, but wasn't anything special.  However the consistency was that of water.  Having never successfully made gravy before I thought this would be a great and easy recipe.  I was wrong.  After it turning out horribly I started looking through the 5 star reviews to see that all of them that I read had made alteration to make it a 5 star recipe.  There should be a review place for alteration and for reviewers that used the recipe exactly or with minor adjustments.  If it is not a 5 star recipe without changes then don't rate it that.

This made excellent gravy for Thanksgiving!  I made several changes after reading some of the top reviews.  I reserved 1 cup of water when I drained my potatoes.  Mixed 6 tablespoons of cornstarch into the 1 cup of potato water.  Meanwhile I added 1 cup of my turkey drippings to 4 cups of turkey stock and brought to a boil.  Slowly whisked in the cornstarch/potato water to stock.  Added pepper, poultry season and celery salt.  I did NOT add addtl salt, didn't think it was needed.  Maybe b/c I used some turkey drippings from a brined turkey.  I will definitely make this gravy each year..everyone loved it!

I made "homestyle turkey the michigander way" and ended up with just a bit over 5 cups of broth in my roasting pan. I left out the salt and just doubled the celery salt. This was my first time making real home made turkey gravy from scratch and it turned out so wonderfully tasty. It was even better than my mom's and grandma's! It took what felt like forever to thicken and after 25 minutes of waiting, it never really did, but the taste was the best I have ever eaten. I doubt that (lack of getting thick enough for my preference) was the recipe though, likely more my inexperience. Thanks, this gravy is outstanding!!!

I was looking for a turkey gravy recipe that did not call for pan drippings - I hate that burnt taste - This gravy was an EXCELLENT choice - It was easy and tasty (though a bit too peppery for me - next time I will not add the full 1/2 tsp - I'll start with 1/8 tsp and work my way up?!) I took some of the others advise because I too like a thicker gravy and added more flour - I will be making this gravy again!

This was an ok gravy recipe. I increased the flour as recommended by others, and I felt it was a bit bland, but good for gravy that does not involve pan drippings.

The gravy did get thicker, but not as thick as I was hoping.  Next time, I'll try using corn starch instead of the flour.

Such a quick and easy recipe, not to mention really good. I added a tsp of herbes de provence (used it to season my turkey too) and the broth was very savory. I gave this five stars because it was easy (not a fan of poultry seasoning).

First time I ever made gravy and it was great!  It was a great basic recipe that I used, along with some of the reviews -- I used half pan drippings and I made a roux with butter/ flour and then added the stock and drippings.  Used the same spices the original recipe called for.

This was an easy way to make gravy and much better than packaged gravy.  I used a hint from another review and melted butter, then added flour to form a smooth paste.  Then I added the broth.  While it thickened I added the seasonings.

I used the stock recipe from this site "Awesome Turkey Giblet Stock" I also took 1 cup of the stock in place of water and chilled it and then added 1\4 cup cornstarch and combined these two in a glass jar and shake it until smooth..(no lumps).... towards the end I added nearly all the drippings from the turkey as well and this turned out amazing!

Pretty good.  Will make again.  I'm not a gravy fan, so it's hard for me to rate it.  Used cornstarch instead of flour, as well as turkey drippings, chicken stock and turkey stock.

Yummy gravy! I used chicken broth because that's all I had, and I used more thickener (corn starch) per another reviewer's advice. I also had no celery salt so I just thinly diced some fresh celery and boiled it along with the gravy. I made turkey breast cutlets, brown rice, and boiled carrots and poured the gravy over everything. The family ate every bite (even the one who hates boiled carrots)!

Very good gravy. I was surprised since no pan drippings were used. I scaled this recipe way down to serve 4. I used fat free chix broth and cornstarch/water to thicken, added the salt,pepper,and poultry seasoning. I also added a few drops of gravy master for a richer color. Very silky tasty gravy without the fat. Tasted just like Turkey Day. I used this on top of Thanksgiving in a Pan from this site. Thanks!

This gravy was great.  I suggest cutting the salt if you're using drippings from a brined turkey.  Otherwise, it will be too salty.

This gravy did not lack in flavor but it would not thicken up for me. Maybe next time I will use a little more flour or cornstarch.

I thought it was fabulous gravy.  I upped the flour to the reccomended 2 tbsp per cup of liquid and it thickened up nicely.  Also, I had used the herbed turkey recipe from this site which gave a wonderful flavor to the gravy.  All I added was the poultry seasoning.  I left out the rest since I already had seasoned drippings.

Very good, I did change a few things. For family of four, I used two cups of stock, 2 tbsp of butter and two tbsp flour, no water. I melt the butter then add flour cook until bubbly resembles wet sand, add broth (wisk) and season. I cut the seasoning down due to decreasing liquid

It was a bit too salty for my taste, next time I'll not add the salt.  I only used 3 cups of stock and the consistancy was good.  I'll definitely make this gravy again, I'm looking forward to trying it with less salt.  It was very simple to make, always a plus.

Very easy to make and tastes delicious!  We added a bit more flour to thicken it up (we like thicker gravy) and it was PERRRRFFEEECCT!!

This was not what i expected. We made this the other nite for a large family dinner. It was not worth the effort. The gravy tasted like paste, wouldn't thicken.

This was awful!  I couldn't get over the way it smelled and it had way too much pepper.  I guess that I like a gravy that is more "comfort food" and less "adventure...try something new food."  No one would eat it and at the last minute I had to make my gravy so that we could have some to eat.

This is a great basic gravy recipe, that's super easy to make, and pretty foolproof.  It is too thin for my taste, and I used an extra 2 tbsp of flour for a half recipe.  It did thicken up at the table, though, and the flavor was really nice.

This is a good recipe, it was liked by all. Its also a great beginner recipe, once you do it a time or two you figure out how to get the right mix of drippings vs stock.

Altered the recipe a lot so can't give it 5 stars. Used 1 can (equivalent of 2 cups) of chicken broth, 1/2 cup of pan drippings form the cornish hens I was preparing and used close to 1/2 cup flour to thicken and at serving time the gravy still was on the thin side.  The flavor was great. Did follow the seasonings as given. This gave me about 2 1/2 -3 cups gravy.

Fantastic gravy! My mom tasted this and said - "You really made this!  It must have been hard"  The only differences I made were to use the drippings from the turkey and supplement chicken broth because I didn't have turkey stock.  Also left out the water and used chicken broth.

THERE IS NO FAT IN THE GRAVY!!!!  Forget about DIET GRAVY gravy on Thanksgiving!! Now, if you were to add this recipe TO THE PAN DRIPPINGS, or add some butter or some kind of fat, if would actually be quite good.  But gravy IS NOT GRAVY WITHOUT SOME FAT!!!  (I KNOW this but since I WAS COOKING Thanksgiving and was just a little distracted from my 4 other sides, I just followed this recipe, and having smoked my bird, I did not have the drippings naturally on hand.

Perfect! Everyone loved it. I always made the "country turkey gravy" made with milk, but the kids and my DH liked this way better. It was fast, easy and really taste great. I love a recipe with few ingredients, little preparation, and easy to make. Thanks a bunch!

I'm not the best at gravy, but this was a very good recipe.  I read through the reviews and instead of flour and water I used cornstarch dissolved in water and slowly added it to the stock until it was thick enough. You can basically season this with whatever you like.

Nothing was right about this gravy. It was too runny, too light in color and 
little bitter for me. 
I won't make this again.

I tried this the day before Thanksgiving using canned turkey broth.  What a mistake!  There is no substitute for making gravy with genuine pan drippings (which took me less time than opening all those cans).  Also, proportions seemed off.  Too watery.

I made the turkey stock myself out of the innards from the turkey and a couple turkey breast fillets I'd been hoarding in the freezer for just an occasion. 

I didn't add salt and I used celery powder instead of celery salt. (We're trying to watch our salt intake.) I also added a tablespoon of butter and sauteed half of a sweet onion when I got ready to pull the gravy together.

Turned out great. And, for my husband who always raves about his dad's gravy...
he said this was even better. And that's a heck of a compliment.

This will be my new gravy recipe.

Use 2 to 4 T Cornstarch disolved in cold water to make thicker. I liked it.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used 3 cups of stock with a little bit of turkey drippings and then 1 cup of water with 3-4 tbs cornstartch.  Yummy!  Thank you for the recipe!

I was not super impressed with this recipe. It had a really great taste, but the flour would not spread throughout the gravy. It ended up being really clumpy, no matter what I did to remedy it.

Pretty good gravy. I used 1 1/4 Tbsp cornstarch instead of flour and added some more seasonings to get more flavor(garlic powder, pepper and vegetable seasoning) Also I used beef broth since I couldnt find turkey broth.

Mine never thickened up.  I even added a tablespoon of cornstarch (mixed with water beforehand, of course).  The flavor was great.  I wish I would've reduced the stock...I think three cups would've been perfect.  Oh well, I've learned for next year.

I only liked this because of how I modified it. I added only 3 cups of stock and I mixed the flour with only a 1/2 c. water. I also added turkey drippings. It took about 20 min to thicken and I do think if I had added all 5c. of stock it probably never would have thickened. I also added a package of dry turkey gravy mix so I think that helped as well. Good flavor.

I used Chicken Stock to make chicken gravy rather than turkey. The flavour was nice but it just didn't thicken up and I cooked it for well over 10 mins. Will probably try again when I'm in a more patient mood.

i must have done something wrong, because this gravy wasn't thick at all - it was extremely watery.  next time, i will add more flour to thicken it or will stick to using a mix.

This recipe is very delicious! At first it was too thin like the other users said. But we added more "flour-water" and let it boil a little longer. My whole family was so amazed that I was able to make gravy that wasn't a flop, and not only that but was awesome! Every single person made a comment on how great it was.

This gravy had a great flavor and everyone at my Thanksgiving table liked it very much.  I used Wondra flour for the slurry and the gravy was a little thin.  Next time I will try regular flour.

Great flavor and very easy to make.  Was a bit too oily for me, but this could stricktly depend on your method of using home made turkey stock.  Overall, a good recipe!

I've made this the last couple of Thanksgivings/Christmases and it's been a huge hit. I usually have to add a little more flour or even a little cornstarch to get it to thicken up to my tastes (I always like my sauces and gravies to be really thick) but I can't argue with the amazing flavor.

Overall, I thought this was very good, and it saved me from a dark gravy-less abyss at the last moment :)
I had cooked a small turkey in a crock pot on low for 10 hours in about 1cup of Emeril's chicken stock, which yielded lots of liquid (5-6 cups).  We took the bird out and strained all the liquid into a large sauce pan.  Skipped the water.   Brought all that liquid to a boil.  Put 1/4c flour in a measuring cup and moved 2 ladles of liquid from the pan to the measuring cup.  Mixed to dissolve the flour, then poured that back into the pan.  That saved the time of having to boil the cup of water back off.  Added all spices in recipe.  Fiance thought still a bit thin, so added 1 more heaping tbsp of flour and used immersion blender to dissolve, but that wasn't absolutely necessary, just quicker than whisk.  YUMMY and LOTS more grave than if I had warmed up a store bought jar.

This was a nice gravy, after a few adjustments. I used corn starch instead of flour, and increased it to roughly a tablespoon per cup of liquid. I used white wine instead of water, and added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce (for both flavour and colour). Will definitely use this one again in the future.

Was a hit tonight. Followed the reviews and made it with the roux (butter + flour + broth). Came out great. 

I strained the broth through a culendar into a measuring cup and then used a turkey Baster to siphon the turkey day off of the top. Used home made poultry seasoning. Everyone loved it.

I love this gravy.  Nice simple basic recipe.  The only thing I do differently (and to be honest may be why I love it so much) is that I use the drippings from the turkey and then supplement with turkey stock or chicken broth to make it 5 cups.

I love this gravy.  Nice simple basic recipe.  The only thing I do differently (and to be honest may be why I love it so much) is that I use the drippings from the turkey and then supplement with turkey stock or chicken broth to make it 5 cups.

This is the first year I have had lots of turkey drippings, mostly from cooking it breast side down.  So I decided to use this recipe.  No longer how long we stirred it and boiled it, it never thickened.  I added a bit more flour than the recipe stated and used a bit less of the spices.  I didn't want to add more flour because I didn't want it to have that floury taste.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any cornstarch.  The flavor was very good and I will make it again with some changes so it thickens properly.

I followed the recipe to a T. Easy and taste good. I don't want to spend all day fighting with the gravy so it does the job, thus the five star rating. It is not a gourmet recipe but sometimes you just need a quick gravy.

I just didn't think this had very much flavor.   I used turkey drippings for the stock and maybe that was the problem?   This was a really easy and fast recipe if you need to make gravy in a pinch.

Definately needed more flour to thicken the gravy. Not a big hit at the dinner table.

This was good but we needed to add another 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it up.  We had bourbon in our stuffing so to complement it we added some to this and took out some of the water.

After reading a few other reviews, I feel bad for giving the recipe 5 stars because I added pan drippings!  I used this recipe because it got so many good reviews, but I wanted to use my pan drippings, so I did both!  Of course, it turned out perfectly!  I did have to add a little corn starch (about a tbsp or 2) to make the gravy a little thicker and I added 4 cups of chicken stock instead of the 5 because I added the drippings.  My Stater Brothers didn't carry turkey stock (weird, huh?!) and I didn't want to go to another grocery store to get it, but the chicken stock was fine.  Great and easy recipe and I will use it again next year! :)  Thanks!!!

This was great!  I used home made chicken stock, and after reading the reviews I used 6 tbsp of corn starch and the thickness was perfect.  Definitely make again.

I was looking for a recipe using the turkey pan drippings as my mom and grandma always did. So, instead of the stock I used 4 cups drippings. I mixed 1 cup water with 1/2 cup flour and added poultry seasoning and salt to taste. It was the perfect consistency. Quick and easy, a basic gravy that I was looking for.

This was my first attempt at making gravy and it was a hit!  I love the seasoning, the poultry season and celery salt are perfect.  For the turkey stock, I used the "Awesome Turkey Giblet Stock" recipe from this site, but eliminated the tangerine zest.  I only got about 2 cups stock, so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  Be sure to wisk WELL while SLOWLY adding in the water/flour mixture, otherwise you will get lumps!

The gravy turned out way too salty for me. Perhaps it was because we soaked our turkey in brine water overnight before roasting, and the stock was salty, but the addition of cream of chicken soup, which is full of sodium, put it over the edge. Definitely do not add extra salt before you taste the gravy. I probably would leave out the soup next time. The milk made the gravy creamy; I had to add extra to tone down the salt.

everyone in my family loved this gravy. it was real easy to make too. I used a few cans of turkey broth and made it the night before to save some time. next time i would reduce the pepper, it was a little too peppery for me, but over all a great recipe, thanx!

Add a little or a lot of kick to your gravy(any gravy) by sprinkling in Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. Keep sprinkling and testing until it's to your taste.

This receipe is a great base and you can add things depending on what you are making.  I used it for Turkey meat loaf.  I added some diced onions and some garlic salt for a little something extra!  It was my first time ever making gravy and it was perfect!  I can't wait to use actual turkey drippings with it.  I think it will taste even better!

The flavors of the gravy were good. Be careful however, I used turkey stock with salt and then I added the additional salt the recipe called for. Way too much!!! I also had trouble since I felt like my gravy tasted a bit too much like flour...Perhaps it was just me....it was easy tough and good in a pinch...I will keep experimenting however!

I only used this recipe to see what I should add to my moms recipe to get a bit more punch. I just wasn't sure on added spices - the recipe and reviews helped!  THOUGH I can't imagine using SOUP in homemade gravy - and I doubt I will ever try it!

This gravy was good.  Taste it before adding salt; mine was plenty salty and I added no salt.  If you use turkey drippings you probably won't need salt.  I made Homestyle Turkey, the Michigan Way and used this gravy.

I'm no gravy pro, so was happy when this came out a good consistency with no lumps (followed others' advice about how much flour to add). Couldn't find "Gravy Master" anywhere in the store, but the color was bearable. Only complaint is that it was wayyy too seasoned. But I think that was because my turkey stock was seasoned??

This turkey gravy recipe is ideal for topping potatoes or turkey, ham - everything. I added one cup of minced turkey giblets and its broth that I stewed the day before and then pureed. It was very very tasty.

This was fantastic! The adjustments made were: the amount of cornstarch as other reviewers suggested, left out the teaspoon of salt and used cooled broth instead of water.

I have never been able to make gravy that tastes like my mothers.  NOw I can.  This was delicious although I didn't follow the flour water measurements exactly as told.  I will be using this again and again.

I was totally freaked out at making gravy but this came out great.  It was gone in minutes and everyone complained that I should have made more.  I will be keeping this one!

Was not inmpressed with this gravy despite having made my own turkey stock and added some of the pan drippings. I thought this would really be tasty. The poutry seasoning was much too strong and the gravy would not thicken without adding a lot of corn starch. 

I'll stick with my old standby next year.

It was OK.  Needed to add a chicken bouillon  cube to get a litter more flavor.  I will probably make it again.

This gravy was okay, it had a strong herb taste to it, but it lacked something. I may use it again with some modifications.

When prepared as instructed it was WAY too thin, so I added extra flour but couldn't never get it even throughout the gravy, even after using a blender on high speed. The taste was ok, it just looked really disgusting. :)

I didnt measure the exact drippings, but used the outline of the recipe for my gravy.  It was great - will definitely use again.  I left out the salt, as I brined my turkey and the drippings were plenty salty.  I just used the flour, water,drippings, and poultry seasoning and it worked great!  Thanks!

I made this as a back up gravy just in case I screwed up the giblet gravy.  Giblet gravy was the star of the Thanksgiving feast.  This gravy wasn't even touched.  :(  I have all of it still and plan to "fix" it by putting some pan drippings to serve with leftovers.

Loved the taste of this when done, however I had a problem with getting it to thicken(not sure where it went wrong), so I wound up adding quite a bit extra flour to it.  Will keep and do again.  Thanks.
