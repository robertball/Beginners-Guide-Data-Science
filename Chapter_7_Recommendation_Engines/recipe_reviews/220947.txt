Loved this!  So easy to make. Added a little herbs de Provence (just because I'm obsessed) and it was splendid. Will definitely make again.

I was looking for something to do with a whole mess of grated potatoes and decided to try this recipe. I did it sans carrot and zucchini, but added a lot of parsley, a layer of goat cheese in the middle, and a spice mix that included turmeric, nutmeg, dill, and thyme. It was very good!

We all really liked it!! I halved the recipe but still used a 9 X 13 and turned the oven up a notch as dinner was late and it was really good EVEN FOR THE SQUASH HATERS they didn't even know it was in the dish!!! and loved it!!! will make this again for sure as you can easily change things a bit from time to time... but made exact this time and was soooo good
