Great for breakfast on the go!  Instead of bread, I used EarthGrains thin muli-grain rolls that I  toasted.

Oh yum was this ever good! I opted for over easy eggs instead of scrambled and used pepper jack cheese. Kids loved this!!!!!!!!!!

This was good, but I would only make it occasionally as a fried breakfast is pretty heavy. I used veggie bacon because I am vegetarian. Thanks!

My kids loved this for breakfast, and I loved the fact that it was so easy.  I used turkey bacon, but followed the recipe otherwise.  I think this one may go into the weekly rotation.
