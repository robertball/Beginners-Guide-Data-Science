I thought these were great!  You must let them chill for overnight to be firm enough to roll.

This recipe calls for 1 package (10 oz) of Hershey's Reeses Chips.  This is ambiguous.  The package of chips offered in Canada is a 300 gram package.  I tried the receipe with 10 oz of chips and it did not turn out.  Clarity is needed here.

I used 10 ounces and 1 cup of heavy cream...chilled it for 2 hours..and it didn't turn out...I'll probably try to chill it longer...to see if it turns out...but the suggested time to chill it is not accurate...so if i wanted to make this in a hurry...then it sure was not successful..

These candies are good but they remain softer than other truffles I have made. I accidently left the mixture sit for two nights in my fridge and the mixture was just firm to soft firm feel. I did dip these in chocolate coating and they tasted very good. Not as sweet or rich as some other truffles but still a good candy.
