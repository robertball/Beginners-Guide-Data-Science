The whole family enjoyed this!  As usual, Chef John showed us in the video how to add some professional tweaks that make a big difference to the final product.  Additionally, I never would have imagined that apple cider vinegar and cayenne pepper would have played a role in such a sweet berry dish.  But it was overall Superb!  Will definitely make this one often in berry season.

I can't tell you how many crisps, crumbles and cobblers I've made over my 40+ years in the kitchen - but believe me when I tell you this one is the ultimate. So good I've committed the crumble mixture to memory.

This is amazing! I don’t always take the time to watch recipe videos, but this one was helpful. I used all raspberries and forgot the cayenne, but kept everything else the same. So good!!

This is the first time I have actually watched a video for a recipe.  (I guess I think I got it all figured out by now!) But I  did watch Chef John's video showing him enjoying grating butter for the crumb topping.  I  have never grated butter before as it shows how to do in this clip.  So being the bold explorer I decide to try this as he says it is so much easier than using my pastry blender.  Well "News Flash" it is not easier and well nigh impossible to do.  I used a Microplane ribbon grater with the attached plastic food holder for the butter.  The frozen butter just would not easily grate.  A little fell through but it was such a hard slog.  This was not fun and it was not easy.  I finally just used a knife and cut the butter in little pieces.  Chef John seemed to have such a good time doing this.  I just don't get it.  Anyway I made the recipe the same except I just used blue and black berries and it was good but really not "ultimate".

My husband and amateur food critic son loved this ultimate berry crumble. I made the recipe exactly as written and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. For those who expressed frustration with grating the butter, you must freeze the butter first and use a grater, not a micro plane zester, which has very tiny holes. I would not change a thing. The flavor of the crumble reminded me of shortbread. It was not bland at all. Yum!

I’ve made it twice.  This time I skipped the bottom crust and put more crumbles on top.  No raspberries.  They get too mushy.   I used a combination of fresh and frozen and used lots more.   I filled the pie plate almost to the top with berries and then put a heavy layer of crumbles.

Just found this recipe and gave it a try right away. It was a very tasty dessert that was really good while still warm. Packing the bottom of the baking pan was easier when it was put in the fridge, otherwise it kept sticking to my hands or the cup I used. Will definitely do this one again.

I've made this a few times. It really is the ultimate! I've made it with vatiations of all kinds of fruits: the berries, blueberries and peaches. I'd like to try peaches and cranberries next! Other than the fruit, I made no substitutions. Fantastic recipe! And I love grating the frozen butter. Genius!

It was okay, the crust/base was bland.  I would make it with brown sugar instead to add some depth of flavour and the caramel flavour would really enhance the berries.

My absolute favourite recipe ever! This crumble really lives up to its title. I’ve made it several times.. even with cold margarine on those days I have a craving but no butter on hand and it comes out just as good!

As always, Chef John has gone above and beyond to create a dessert that is an explosion of flavours to tantalise your taste-buds. I have never tried putting cayenne in a desert before, but it gave it  wonderful zing to the fresh fruit!
Made to the exact recipe using strawberries, blueberries and raspberries purchased fresh at our local farmers market. It would have been peaches but our 4 boys devoured them to fast! :)
Thank you chef John, you are amazing.

I made this crumble after watching Chef John`s video. It turned out wonderful, My wife loved it, took some to a work ,to her friend, now we have another  Chef John fan. 
What I found the most helpful was the way he shows you how the crumble should look and feel when its got the right amount of moisture.

I made this for me and my husband for Valentine's Day.  Loved it!  It will be even better in the summer when I can get fresh local berries.  I didn't put the cayenne in because I forgot to pick some up at the store.  I'll be interested to see the difference next time.  I was concerned because the crumble mixture was so dry, I thought it would fall apart, but it came together beautifully!  I'm sure this will become a go-to dessert for many occasions!

Easy and tasty!

I added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries.  Next time will try subbing another berry for blackberries to avoid seeds.  Appreciated the technique demonstrations in the video.

I made this twice. The first time exactly like the recipe with the cornstarch. It was delicious but a bit thick. The next time I made it I left out the corn starch and added one cup more blueberries.  It turned out perfect. I will make this again as my husband will make sure of this.

This recipe has become legendary among family and friends. Everyone loves it! Even worth grating the
 butter in a hot summer kitchen.

This is an excellent dessert to share with guests. We grow blackberries which makes it that much better.  Chef John gives great tips - watch the video.

This was delicious! I did not change a thing...I used fresh lemon and a sharp fork to get the lemon zest off the lemon... I definetely recommend doing this!  This was the best berry crumble I have ever made! The dough was delicious!

We really liked this. But I don't eat eggs so used chia seeds as a replacement. This worked but  too much water and as a result lost the 'crumble' - it was more like pastry. Next time I will used less water. The video was perfect and I highly recommend anyone to see it before making this desert.

Oh my goodness! Never had a crumble taste this good. And I was thinking it would be an epic fail. Apple cider vinegar.... No, really. A pinch of what... Cayenne??? OK fine but this is not going to be any good. Boy was I wrong. It was so delicious I had it with ice-cream  one morning for breakfast. Just couldn't wait to have it as a dessert later in the day.

I had three cups of strawberries and one cup of blueberries leftover from making another recipe so decided to give this a try. I followed the recipe except melted the butter instead of cutting it into the dry ingredients. Much easier. I never made a crumble with a bottom layer but it turned out great. I kept going back for one more spoonful until it was all gone. Great recipe!

Ultimate is right.  The both tender and crisp shortbread crust and topping make this dessert A+.

The crumble was good, but I think it would be better with more fruit.  Followed the recipe exactly; the crumble is too thick and the fruit filling is too skimpy.  I'd try again just because the crumble part was good, but would add at least 1 1/2 cups more fruit, possibly even double the filling.

Made gluten free substituting almond flour and cassava flour for wheat.  Unbelievably delicious.  This is now a weekend standard.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but used 1 c strawberries, 1c blueberries, and 1c raspberries.  It turned out a little too "juicy" for my liking (I like mine more on the "crumble" side", so next time I will probably use more cornstarch to thicken.  I am making it again this weekend!  Definitely one of my favorite desserts of all time.
