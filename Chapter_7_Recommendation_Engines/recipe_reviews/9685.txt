I think there might be an error in the ingredient list for this recipe. Twice it calls for *1 CUP* egg yolk when I believe it SHOULD just be *1* egg yolk.

very good. There's nothing wrong with this recipe, the ingredients are listed as they are used. You do use two egg yolks just for separate parts of the recipe. Very tasty though will make again!

I wish I could give these 4 1/2 stars!  My first couple bites weren't anything special, but the subdued flavor builds and I found myself grabbing a second cookie.  The lemon is great and although I wouldn't have picked out the black pepper flavor if I didn't know it was in there, it has a great aftertaste.  While I was making these I was sure I needed to add something.  I considered adding baking powder or vanilla or lemon flavoring- don't do it.  They're great as is.  The only changes I made were to accidentally add the egg yolk along with the whole egg in the dough (oops, used another egg yolk for the wash) and I didn't have any crystal sugar so I sprinkled with granulated sugar.  Great cookie!
