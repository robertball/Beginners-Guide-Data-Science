I added 3 cloves of garlic, a chicken buillion cube and pesto, for the finish, sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese.  It was so good.  I think I would try this adding shrimp and clam sauce in a place of chicken buillon next time.

mmmmmm. This was very good. I added garlic with the tomatoes because it seemed like it needed it. I also added a little cajun seasoning for some spunk. I would definately try this. It's a great way to use green tomatoes!

I served this one night when my mother was over for dinner; actually it was she who found and suggested the recipe.  She enjoyed it, but I did not like it at all.  I found the tomatoes very sour/bitter.  I liked the pasta and cheese part though.

This just "WOWED" my family.  I added garlic, thyme, oregano, and basil (all fresh from my garden), but did so delicately.  This is a recipe I will use again!

Thoughts: this is a fast, easy, and surprisingly sophisticated recipe to make on short notice in the summer.  I used rotini which is just what I had around.  I also ground quite a bit of pepper, to my taste.  The kids gobbled it up and I didn't bother with garlic, chicken broth, etc.  I like all of those flavors but this recipe seems to work well if you keep it simple.  So that is my tip--don't over think it, and let the tomatoes and cheese take center stage.

I made this for lunch today, and was pleasantly surprised. Instead of pasta, we served it over rice. I followed the suggestions of others, and added creole seasoning and garlic. Great recipe though. Definitely will make it again :]

This was a unique blend of flavors, and I would probably make it again if I had more green tomatoes I needed to use. For the leftovers, I added some garlic salt, goat cheese, and a dash of balsamic vinegar for a little more flavor. This made a very affordable main dish!

Awesome! I changed the recipe quite a bit, though, the 2nd time I used it.  I'm watching my weight, so I used spaghetti squash instead of regular pasta.  I also traded butter for the oil to make it creamier, but left out the feta and added fresh basil and oregano.  I like celery seed, so I added that, too.  I agree that it is a very elegant and unique dish that can be served to guests and combined in many different ways!

I have a lot of green tomatoes and had a package of feta wasting away in my fridge, so this recipe was the perfect solution!  A really neat way to use up green tomatoes too.  I used half a stick of butter instead of olive oil, added 2 cloves minced garlic, and my feta was sundried tomato basil flavor.  We were quite curious about how the recipe would turn out and it ended up being great!   Next time I'm going to cut back on the cheese or else just sprinkle with a little grated parmesan because as good as the dish was, the feta flavor dominated over the tomato flavor.  We liked it enough though that I plan to just cook some noodles and toss in a bit of butter and feta if I need a quick, easy dinner sometime in the future.

I just made this for supper tonight.  I am swamped with work and grad school, so I am looking for easy, tasty and healthy meals.  This one is a keeper.  Next time I will add a salad or another vegetable, but it was great by itself!  Hubby loved it too!

A wonderful way to use Green Tomatoes.  We tossed the pasta lightly with Alfredo Sauce before serving it though.

I was happy to find this recipe after a sudden hail storm in July damaged my tomato crop. This dish was delicious with fresh basil, thyme and oregano.

Very good!  I didn't really know what to expect, since I haven't ever cooked with green tomatoes (other than fried), but I was pleasantly surprised. Even DH who is NOT a huge fan of tomatoes enjoyed this. I did not find the tomatoes bitter in the least like another reviewer had mentioned. Thanks for sharing!

I tossed in some garlic, celery,  and a 1/2 pear diced. topped with romano cheese. Everyone loved it and had seconds. Could use a bit more color though.

This was simple and delicious, perfect for a quick meal.  A little bit of garlic and fresh herbs adds a bit more to the flavor but is not necessary at all.

I love fried green tomatoes, and feta, and onions, but for some reason this just didn't come together for me.  My DH didn't care that much for it either, so I don't think we'll be making it again.

I also threw in some leeks, garlic and Japanese eggplant from our garden.  I tossed it all with a little sesame oil and soy sauce and a few shavings of chipotle cheddar cheese.  Yummy!

This was such a perfect way to use end of season green tomatoes. Added garlic and pesto, skipped the feta cheese, and used pasta I had on hand. The tomatoes are crunchy and sweet, perfect for freezing in one person portions. Thanks so much for a wonderful alternative for green tomatoes!

We only had 4 green tomatoes, but we had alot of fresh corn laying around so we added corn to the recipe.  Delicious!  Great recipe.  The feta & green tomato combo was perfect together.

I used quinoa pasta and goat cheese since I did't have tri-colored pasta and because I don't care for feta cheese. I also used red onion and some minced garlic. I did't care for this but my man loved it!

yummy! I also added a few small ripened Romas and it turned out beautifully. thanks for sharing - now I know what to do with my countless green tomatoes!
