I love the concept of pairing chicken with a creamy lemon sauce. And while this is quick and easy saving on time and effort in the kitchen due to the pre-made sauce it just doesn't meet expectations in the flavor department. I followed the recipe exactly, but found that seasoning the flour is a must so I added a little garlic powder along with the salt and pepper.  I also used olive oil vs. veg. oil to pan fry the chicken. The sauce leaves something to be desired and is thin and watery vs. thick and creamy. I ended up adding a little cornstarch to thicken it, but in the end it was bland in spite of  the additional parsley and lemon zest. Even with some tweaking I don't think I would make this again....

This was actually my favorite Progresso starter recipe.  The chicken was creamy and delicious and succulent and the flavors in the sauce were very good.

As-written, this is only a three-star recipe.  With my modifications, it would be four stars.  The canned sauce is pretty bland and sort of reminded me of extremely watered down cream of chicken soup.  Honestly, I expected quite a bit more flavor from a Progresso product.  I had to add salt and pepper to the sauce to get any real flavor from it.  I didn't measure the lemon juice, but I estimate that I used about 2 Tbs, which was plenty.  Any more would have been far too tart.  I also did not simmer the chicken in the sauce, as that would have destroyed the beautiful golden crispness obtained by sauteing the chicken.  I served this with brown jasmine rice cooked in home made chicken stock and bacon/onion flavored green beans.

Because I was afraid 3 T. of lemon juice would be too strong for mine and my husband's tastes, I began with 2 T. and am very glad I did. Had I added the full amount, it would have been entirely too strong a flavor for our liking. We did not particularly enjoy this recipe.

I did not have the Campbell’s’ product but needed to use up some lemons with chicken. I have a ‘Tones’ spice roasted garlic combination – so melted butter added the roasted garlic, lemon then braised the chicken breast. Removed the braised breast, added flour making a rue. I baked the chicken. Then added to the rue chicken bouillon, cream, and milk, making a tasty gravy. Did not have rice, I usedpasta shells. Turned out fine to me (my husband liked the chicken but not the pasta in the sauce). It was not as simple as this recipe –BUT this recipe gave concepts for what I did with my lemon with chicken search. What I had on hand I made my own creamy roasted garlic with chicken stock cooking sauce – thanks for the idea Progresso. I’ll see if I can find the product and try it. Maybe my husband will like Progresso’s version!

Great flavor with the soup mixed with the fresh lemon for the gravy.  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, bowtie pasta instead of rice and cut the chicken into strips (it only took 2 large breasts)-and it fed 4-6!  What an easy weeknight meal this made.  I would use less lemon juice next time-maybe just a little squeeze-the soup is good on it's own.

Excellent recipe! It's incredibly quick and easy to make, and the sauce is very creamy and delicious! I sliced the chicken breasts in half horizontally, which was much easier and less messy than pounding them out. I cooked 1 cup brown rice in 2-1/4 cups chicken broth for about 35 minutes. My husband and I both really liked this dish. I'll definitely be making this again.

We really didn't care for this dish. I read the reviews and saw that others thought that the sauce was bland, so I added some seasonings. It still wasn't very good.

Well I liked this recipe but neither of my kids and husband liked it at all. I followed the recipe exactly. I will not be making this anytime soon for the family.

I didn't like it at all, the lemon didn't really come through, it just tasted like bitter garlic.

This was good! I cooked the sauce for longer than specified to thicken it. I used the juice and zest of a large, fresh lemon.

This was o.k.  I used extra lemon juice and it did not over power this dish.  It was bland to me.

Very nice and easy for a weeknight meal. I would have liked for the fat content in the sauce to be lower (I'm trying to lose weight), but all in all, really nice. And I loved the lemon zing!

Not sure if I should rate this as I made significant changes.  I didn't have the progresso sauce so I used Campbells Cream of Chicken.  After I made the chicken I deglazed the pan with white wine, mixed the cream of chicken with lemon juice and water and mixed it all together in the pan.  I then simmered the sauce and added the chicken back into the pan and simmered for another 5 minutes.   I saw some reviews that said it was bland.  I marinated the chicken longer to get more flavor into the meat.

I proceeded with caution upon reading the reviews, so I made some changes. I added salt and garlic powder to the flour and seasoned the chicken. I didn't have the Progresso packet so I improvised. After cooking the chicken, I combined 2 tbs of flour into the pan with the browned olive oil I just cooked the chicken in. Then I added 1 1/2 cups of water and 1 chicken bouillon. I cooked in medium high heat until the sauce thickened a bit. I also squeezed lemon juice from a small whole lemon. I loved the result and would do it again.

followed the instructions for the most part. after reading the other reviews i did however decide to only use about 1 and a half tsp of lemon juice and it came out really good. the lemon sauce had just the right amount of citrus flavors to it. I will definitely cook this meal again. it was quick, easy and a perfect meal for a weeknight dinner

Ramped up the spices in the flour to include garlic and onion powders, and a dash of homemade spice mixture.  Omitted salt completely.  I added the full amount of lemon juice and I could have added more, but the kids stopped me.  One didn't like the sauce, one loved the entire thing.  I served over smashed garlic infused cauliflower instead of rice.  This might make it's way into an 'occasional' meal.  The longest time was frying up the chicken--only 2 fit in my skillet at a time.  After that, pretty easy.  Wish the sauce was thicker though!

This was just alright in my opinion.  I couldn't get past the metallic canned taste of the sauce despite tweaking the recipe.  I added the 3 Tbsp's of lemon juice because I love the tartness but the sauce was missing salt and seasoning.  I added salt, even a Tbsp. of butter whisked in to try and enrich the sauce and while it turned out fine and was edible, I wouldn't make it again unless I made my own homemade lemon sauce.
