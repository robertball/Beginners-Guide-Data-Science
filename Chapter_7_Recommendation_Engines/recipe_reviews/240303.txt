Loved it!  It has a subtle pumpkin taste.  Had made cut outs with these and once rolled, you have to be very quick with the cut outs because the dough soften really fast and it can get sticky.  I also mixed flour and and a little bit of confectioner to the board/counter.

This was truly a great recipe! I followed all of the directions, except I added an additional ½ cup of flour to compensate for the extra stickiness. It worked wonders. Also, be sure to flour your rolling surface, hands, rolling pin, and the dough...it helps greatly! My kids love them, and so do I :)

I really enjoyed these! I changed a few things- I added extra cinnamon and an extra egg yolk.  I also baked them at 185C for 10 mins.  The dough was too gooey to be rolled out like traditional sugar cookies so I rolled the dough into balls and pressed them with a cup, so they looked like discs.  Not a super sweet cookie, so definitely benefitted from frosting! But they are fluffy and soft and very tasty.  Will make again!

These were pretty good, although I think I need to do some tweaking.  I always use fresh pumpkin vs canned, which in turn may have made the dough too soft.  They just didn't get quite right.  The taste is really good, so I'm sure I can figure it out!

I made these. I was worried about the reviews saying they were sticky but figured I would try it out. I ran out of white flour but had some whole wheat flour.  so I did half white and half whole wheat. I refrigerated the cookies for 2 hours and they rolled out perfectly. I did work fast bc the dough does warm up and gets soft. The cookies aren't overly sweet which is great for a cookie that should have frosting on it! I made home made cream cheese frosting. Overall I was really happy with this recipe.

While it wasn't a bad cookie, I had no luck making it into a sugar cookie. I couldn't roll it out. I ended up throwing it into the freezer after making it a cylinder and cutting off slices. Needs more sugar to me as well.

Had a 1/2 can of pumpkin to use up so decided to use this recipe. They turned out so well and yummy.  Used my convection oven in RV for first time and they turned out perfect...soft on inside, little crisp on edges. Light pumpkin flavor.

Great cookie, easy for cut outs, not too sweet and a nice mild taste of pumpkin and cinnamon. I added an extra 1/3 cup of the pumpkin puree and about just over a half cup extra of flour to the dough. The dough is quite sticky when first made and I was concerned it would be difficult to roll out but after four (4) hours in the fridge it firmed up quite nicely and the dough was easy enough to roll out, you do got to work quick before it softens too much but nothing too distressing. I didn't have any issues.

I added a pinch more baking soda and added pumpkin spice. These cookies are soft and addictive. They are my go to Halloween cookie. And with so little sugar, they are decently healthy...ish. and of course the scraps make for great doggie treats!

Best recipe adding the 1/2 cup flour came out perfect.
Have been looking for a good trust worthy recipe for this kind of cookies for awhile

They are super light. Barely any flavor. I didn’t roll them or anything special.

Love these!  Could use more pumpkin and cinnamon.... but they are still great. I used cream cheese frosting on top.

These cookies have more sugar than I care to eat, but the concept is lovely. Next time I will be using less sugar and more pumpkin, as the flavor should be more intense.  I baked these at 300 degrees for about fifteen to twenty minutes for a more moist and light golden appearance.

GREAT!! I tried it as is which is good. Then i also made it with canned sweet potatoes. From now on I’m using sweet potatoes. My mom and gramma always make sweet potato pie instead of pumpkin pie so i guess the taste of sweet potatoes stuck with me. I also made a sort of icing with the rest of the canned sweet potatoes and some other stuff, but i don’t remember exactly what i put in it. Will make it again. ??????????

These are delicious - the pumpkin gives the basic sugar cookie some flavour and keeps the cookie moist. My only challenge is that I could not get the dough to roll out and cut shapes. It’s a little too sticky. But I rolled the dough into a log and sliced into even rounds. Simple in appearance but still lovely in flavour.

I will have to try making these again for sure.... I substituted golden sugar for the white sugar and the cookies were not as sweet as I expected.  They are ok though I am not sure if my hubby and 3 year old will consider them treats or "healthy" food.  Perhaps a generous layer of icing on top will take care of that :)

These were pretty good, but I used Libby's pumpkin pie mix, and added pumpkin pie spice, to taste, which for me is quite a bit and they tasted just like my pumpkin pie.
