Loved this little salad. I made a couple of changes. I used cherry tomatoes cut in half (because I had them) and cubed mozzarella cheese instead of burrata  (because I had it). I also added finely minced garlic to the mushroom/breadcrumbs/almonds. This was delicious and a "little out of the everyday" salad. 
A super way to help use all of those fresh tomatoes in the summer.

Fun and delicious! I just used regular fresh mozzarella as that is what I had on hand. So yummy!

I was quite intrigued by this recipe. The cheese isn't something you can get in your local grocery and the crumbs were a little bland for my taste. I added a touch of cayenne to the mushroom-crumb mixture. I'm happy the recipe was written out because I have a severe case of  tinnitus and can't hear very well. Thank you. I wish more people would give a written recipe instead of just a video.

This was fun to serve. The "dirt" needs a bit more spice; I added minced saluted garlic
