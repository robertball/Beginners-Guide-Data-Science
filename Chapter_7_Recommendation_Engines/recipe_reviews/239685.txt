I used 2 cans of French Onion Soup because I couldn't find the recipe's soup.  It was delicious and didn't take too much time.  Served with potatoes.  Will definitely have again.

Best meatloaf, seriously! And absolutely easiest! I tried 3 Seperate meatloaf recipes last weekend. This one recipe won both me and my husband over. Not too wet or dry. Making it again this weekend?

Delicious and quick!  I made one large meatloaf but precut it into 6 pieces so the topping would soak in.  Will definitely make this again!  For someone allergic to tomatoes, this is a winner since you need no tomato sauce or ketchup!

So easy! I also make it with ground turkey or ground bison depending on what I have. I always add diced yellow onions and an egg and some smoky BBQ sauce. I also add in shredded zucchini sometimes, which is really tasty. I cover them in more BBQ sauce and pop them in the oven. They come out moist and are a huge family favorite! These are just fun variations I've come up with since I've made it so many times. The original recipe is great too! Enjoy!

Loved this recipe and made it all the time until Campbell's discontinued the sweet onion soup. However Campbell's has another mini meatloaf recipe also called Meatloaf Express with their French Onion soup that is just as good, if not better. The recipe calls for ketchup and honey mustard which, I have to admit, gave me some pause, but during the baking the ingredients blend perfectly and the end result is something that I definitely plan to cook again.

My husband loves my cooking, but has never liked it when I made meatloaf (I never was a fan either). I'm no quitter and was determined to make a delicious meatloaf! This recipe is the winner!!! It's sooo easy and sooooooo delicious! Even my picky kids loved it! This will definitely be a regular at our dinner table! Oh, and I used French onion soup because I couldn't find the soup it called for, but it was perfect!

Great way to make and freeze for quick reheating when you are the only one who likes meatloaf in the house.

This was very moist, the way we like it. I added a bit of barbecue sauce on top to give it a little zing. Perfect recipe.

Delicious! I used French onion soup instead because I couldn't find the recipe's soup. I also season with Weber's Kick'n Chicken and black pepper. It was very spicy and delicious!
