Yum!  A great vegetable side with a kick!  My husband who isn't the veggie-lover that I am raved, bc he adores anything spicy ;)  My only change was omitting the butter, to try and cut a bit of fat.  The dish didn't suffer following this omission, deelish!!!  Thanks for sharing Anna

On the surface this looks like nothing new or special.  But try adding this bit of jalapeno!  It  gave a ho-hum sautéed  zucchini new life and zip.   It, with the addition of red and yellow peppers , really made this pop.

Easy-peasy, fresh, flavorful side.  Prepared as written, perfect as is with a bit of sea salt to finish.  Great summer side for just about any grilled meat.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, I'll use this often.

I substituted a smaller sweet onion (red torpedo) for the shallot and added fresh basil, used all olive oil vs olive oil and butter. Very tasty, and certainly easy, took me about 10 minutes to prep and 10 minutes to cook. I quartered the zucchini so it would cook faster, and that was the right adjustment; it cooked at the same rate as the peppers. Next time, I'd add fresh Roma tomatoes if I had them on hand.

I didn't have the jalapeño so as a substitute I used a dash of ground cayenne pepper. It was a big hit with the family. I will defiantly make this again.

Delicious!  Instead of the shallot (I didn't have any), I used about 1/4 sweet onion, chopped.  I forgot the paprika and used seasoned salt instead of regular.  I was hesitant about the jalapeno, but it gave the veggies a nice flavor.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe is very simple and delicious but I did change it from the original. I did not put any peppers or onion but added mushrooms but it still came out delicious.

This was good. However I would omit the yellow pepper. Too expensive here at $3.50 each. And it adds no flavor. It brings color to the dish but I would use green pepper. Better taste. The jalapeno and shallot is great added flavor.

We usually roast all of our vegetables to bring out their natural sweetness.  But I had some hook neck squash in the fridge to use up. And I always have peppers & onions on hand. And lots of garlic.  I did add some chopped tomatoes at the very end for color and taste.  This was a very good & quick side dish.

Scrumpous way to eat veggies. I didn't use the jalapeño as didn't have it, but was good without it. I did add a little water in pan after sauté and put lid on pan to ensure veggies cooked thru to desired doneness.

I tried this recipe slightly modified tonight, it was awesome. I ate it with a piece of fried chicken. I halved the recipe omitting the yellow pepper, and just used a medium sized green pepper and 3 yellow Snackum peppers from my garden. I didn't use the jalapeno pepper because I didn't grow any this year, instead I used a Big Green Serrano. Didn't use a shallet, substituted with a sweet onion. Didn't have paprika so didn't use it either, but other than that it was as above. I rate this dish about a 5 out of 5, it tasted awesome with a piece of fried Chicken. 


This recipe would probably work great with one of each, a zucchini and a squash of the 2 inch Dia size equally well, might try it next time. I included a pic of my meal, it's the blue bowl with white background. I also ignored the time to cook part, and just cooked it till I thought it was done. I stirred it up a lot with a wooden spoon; as it cooked on medium heat. I'm not sure why anna32182 didn't include what heat setting she uses, but by reading the reviews, it would probably have helped her rating, such as this review: "very green tasting. cook zucchini longer, or add something saucy.—parodies" I only used Organic vegetables fresh picked from my garden, I am sure it improved the taste.

Great taste. I agree with other reviews, and I would cut the oil and butter to about half of what is called for.  Flavor and appearance were fantastic! I used small multicolor bell peppers and red pepper flakes for the jalapeno (didn't have any). Beautiful side dish for a steak!

This was yummy.  We have a gas burner on our grill so for ease I placed all the ingredients in the pan and put the squash on top.   I only used olive oil  but bet the butter would be great.  I did use the shallot and added 1/2 a white onion.   I like the flavor of the jalapeño.  It wasn’t spicy.  I used a generous amount of salt, pepper and paprika. Added a lot more of the spices.

I made this sans jalapeños, added an extra tbsp of olive oil and butter as well as 2 packets of Goya salad & vegetable seasoning. Came out pretty well. Could've used a little more salt.

The only change I made was to cook it for ten minutes.
