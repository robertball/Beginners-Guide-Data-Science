I used La Victoria Salsa Verde(16 0z Jar) and that takes all the work out of prepping the sauce, leaving just the time it takes to cook it down. This sauce is made with Tomatillos and jalapenos-it came out great! This is a recipe worth trying.

My family comes from Mexico and my grandmother made a similar recipe which I always loved. I'm so thrilled to have found this one. I used fresh tomatillos instead of canned and more limes(key limes make it even better if you can get them). Great recipe!

I grew quite a few tomatillo plants this year and when I saw how much I ended up with I thought maybe I had made a mistake.  I mean, you can only eat so much salsa verde! But then I tried this recipe, substituting my fresh tomatillos for the canned. And now I know what I'll be doing with all those tomatillos that now have made their way into the freezer! Oh, this was so good!  SURPRISINGLY good, Hubs said!  I made a couple of minor changes, but nothing that made much difference in terms of staying true to the recipe  - threw a couple of garlic cloves in with the tomatillos and jalapeno and used flour tortillas rather than the corn (I've tried, but I just don't like them). I used No Name Steaks which I always keep on hand for quick sauteed meals like this.  They're very tender and so easy to slice thinly while they're still partially frozen. But I digress - this dish was so flavorful and had such character!  LOVED it!  Had to leave out the red pepper for Hubs but this had so much going for it in the way of flavor, color and texture that it wasn't even missed. To my way of thinking this is a perfect recipe, and a perfect dish.  This was so delicious I'll probably be dreaming about it tonight.

Being from northern México I have a suggestion for you to make this tacos much better.
First heat a grill or pan, season meat with salted tenderizer and cook it whole turning once.  Once ready, let it stand for about 10 minutes and chop it.  Now it is ready for tacos!  Any salsa will do (green or red) as this is according to taste.  Don´t forget shredded swiss cheese on top and avocado slices.  Yummy!

this is a very good recipe for carne asada tacos! I used flank steak, seasoned with salt, black pepper and 2 limes. Omitted the crushed red pepper flakes. Marinated for 7 hours. I did not buy a can of tomatillos since I had some fresh ones on hand. My preparation for the salsa verde is: 6 tomatillos, husked, rinsed, half of a white onion, cut up, one jalapneo, seeded, stemed, 3 fresh garlic cloves placed on a baking sheet. I roasted these in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes or until I noticed they got soft. I added them all to a blender along with a bunch of fresh cilantro. Added salt, black pepper and the juice of a lime. Once blended I set it aside. I heated a little canola oil (blended) in a skillet and added the meat, cut up, sauteed for 1 minute. Carne Asadas came out very tender, juicy and full of flavor. The salsa verde sauce was not too spicy hot and full of nice flavor from the tomatoes and seasonings. I completed this dish with, "Homemade Flour Tortillas," "Spanish Rice," also from this website. Topped it off with chopped tomatoes, diced avocados, onions and fresh cilantro. I did not serve a wedge of lemon, only a lime. A meal worth making again and again!

I loved these! I was raised in Mexico and they reminded me of the tacos from the street vendors we used to eat. Our mexican "fast food!" One change I made was to cut the meat into tiny pieces (diced, I guess!) I heated the tortillas in the microwave between two damp paper towels and then cooked them in a bit of oil for a few seconds on each side which makes them softer. I didn't make the salsa, used Herdez salsa verde. Yummy!

Absolutely tasty!  Prefer a bit more heat but as recipe states: salt, pepper and crushed red pepper to taste.  Next time a little more crushed red pepper should do it for me.  If you're searching for something of mexican flavor, stop right here, you've found it.  An excellent dish.

Pretty good - Steam the corn tortillas vs oven/toaster (flour tortillas would probably work OK too).  Also salsa needs some salt.  Food prep time was very reasonable.  Very attractive dish with all of the condiments assembled.

The tomatilla sauce was a lot of work for the end result.  Also, canned tomatillas were very difficult to find...I used fresh instead.  This was so-so - not great, but not bad.

Yum. I added extra salt and lime to the marinade and also used fresh tomatillos for the sauce (couldn't find canned - and fresh is better anyway) - which turned out excellent... Added a little of the sauce, some lime juice, salt and cilantro to the avocado for a guacamole. Thanks!

These tacos are delectable!  I had leftovers for 4 days straight, but I didn't mind b/c the tacos were outstanding!  I would also suggest using mozarella cheese for a topping!

These are fantastic!  Didn't change a thing.  A note though, the photo displayed is of a flour tortilla, not corn tortilla!  Makes a big difference.

I cut the top sirloin in very small pieces and used an already made salsa verde instead of preparing the sauce as indicated because I could not find canned tomatillos. I served the meat (which does cook in a minute) with the sauce, avocado, onions, tomatoes and cilantro on warmed white corn tortillas. Excellent.

this is an excellent recipe! Skirt Steaks or Breakfast Steaks work well with this. I do use fresh tomatillos and add some garlic to my homemade salsa verde (or just buy your favorite brand!) and you HAVE to use soft corn tortillas for that authentic taste--just like the "street tacos" you buy on the corner in Tijuana! I use more lime and cilantro because I like alot of it, and if you are going to use any cheese at all-make it pepper jack!

This is a good recipe, however I would not use canned tomatillos. Tomatillos are easy to roast. Peel wrapper off of them, rinse, place on sheet pan, with cut onions, garlic and several seeded jalapenos. Roast at 400 degrees for aprox 30 min, and viola, yummy

These tacos rock!  Way better than the normal ground beef with a packet of spice I usually fix.  Entire family loved them.  From now on, this will be the only way I fix tacos.

Awesome! My latino husband said this was the best dish I've ever made (and I have made many). I used New York steak and marinated it for about an hour. I also used fresh tomatillos just because I couldn't find canned. I'm glad I did. I think the tomatillo sauce was the best part! Thank you for the recipe.

This was relly great. The tomatillo sauce was much better than expected. I added cilantro to it and skipped the step of cooking it down with beef broth-it tasted lovely and fresh to me; also I was in a hurry.  I used skirt steak, and we grilled it. It was annoying to cut up but I used kitchen shears. It took longer than expected. Thanks for a lovely recipe.

Great, my husband and I really liked it.  Only thing missing was cheese so we added grated cheddar (can't have tacos without cheese).  We will definitely be having this again!

5 stars and I had to change it up based on what was in my pantry. I ended up with an extra kiddo tonight and only had 2 small roundsteaks out for dinner. I didnt have the tomatillos so I used canned green chiles. I added a splash of rooster sauce to the marinade because my husband is addicted to it. I served this with cheesy rice and refried beans. Not a bit of this left. I dont think it feeds 6 but its still a solid recipe.

I was looking for a good recipe like this. Our favorite mexican restaurant has these named as "Street Tacos" on their menu. Instead of going out we decided to make these and fish tacos on the grill at home. Wow this recipe is great. BUT....always a but, I changed a few things. I used adobo sauce from a can of chipotle peppers instead of the tomatilla sauce. The adobo sauce we so fantastic with a smokey flavor but be careful if you use it...it's very spicy! Cilantro & green onions went into the baggie to marinate. I also used white vinegar instead of beef broth to marinate my meat (read this on a different website). I let the meat marinate for nearly 6 hours. Served on white corn tortillas that we threw on the grill for a few seconds and melted some monterey jack cheese on the tortillas (like our fav restaurant does). We paired with fish tacos, corn salad and an ice cold corona. This made for a good TexMex night under the cabana by the pool!

These were very good!  I took advice from one of the reviews on here and used a jar of Salsa Verde instead of fresh tomatillos and it was GREAT and saved tons of time I think.  Will definitely make these again!  (Note to myself...use flour tortillas, not corn.)

I needed to double the seasoning, and used diced tomatoes instead of the tomatillos.  I mixed in the onions to the tomato mixture and it turned out well.  Definitely a good recipe.

Still looking for a recipe that tastes like the street tacos we had in Mexico. I'm going to try using lard next time, see if it makes a difference. Otherwise absolutely delicious.

I used a pre-made salsa verde to save time, but the end result was fantastic! Very simple, very tasty, and definitely going into the dinner rotation!

Very easy and tasty.  We did homemade tortillas, so it took a little longer than the recipe called for.  Will make this again.

Very good! I added crumbled Queso Fresco cheese which was a nice addition. Did not have fresh jalapenos-used pickled ones and still good.

I am rating this more on the method and toppings. I made this tonight using 2 ribeye steaks I cooked on medium. To flavor I just sprinkled them with some seasoning salt instead of the crushed red pepper. I followed the tortilla method of heating them in the microwave, stacking 2, and then topping with some chopped onion, cilantro, and tomato. The tomatillo sauce can be bought in a can or jar, if using. My personal recipe does not have beef broth.

Excellent recipe.  Next time, I will drain some of the liquid from the tomatos as it overflowed in my processor.  We added cheese too - my familly doesn't like raw onion so didn't use it but next time will chopped the onions and brown to add to recipe.

This was so easy to make and so delicious. The only thing I did different was I doubled the hot peppers as it was too bland for my tastes as written. Also give them a try with flour tortillas...Delish...

I only made the beef steak part.. but it was DELICIOUS!!! i served the tacos with the Mexi-Italian Salsa recipe on this site and my the boyfriend could not have been more pleased! he kept on going on and on about how AMAAAZING the meal was!  I used deboned beef short ribs so the meat was tender and juicy. I also let the meat marinade for three hours before i popped it onto medium high heat!  Warning! Be sure to wear an apron cuz when ur meat is almost done, the black pepper in the pan gets really hot and starts to "jump" out of the pan and onto ur belly, hands, it kinda catches u by surprise at first.. but it's no big deal, doesn't really hurt or anything.. and even if it did, it'd be SOOO WORTH IT.... haha..  thanks for the recipe!  ps. we added a LOT more hot pepper flakes to the meat.

This was perfect!  The only thing I did differently (because I just can't ever seem to not mess with something) was I added some "Mexican" oregano.  Very tasty recipe and my hubby loved it too.  No leftovers!

I made this for me and my 2 kids using the Verde sauce suggested by another reviewer.  The prep was simple (and my daughter enjoyed helping cut the veggies).  I liked the end result, but it was too spicy for both my kids. I used the extras in an omlette the following morning.  This is a good recipe, but probably won't work for you if you have young kids.

Oh yeah!  These are great.  Followed a previous suggestion and used the La Victoria sauce instead of making the sauce.  We used flour tortillas and made these into burritos (easier for my kids to eat).  Good with pepper jack, too!

This was delicious! I didn't use as much jalapeno as the recipe called for as there are some in my household who are unable to handle too spicy. Will definitely make this again.  I think it might also taste good with pork or chicken.

Definitely a keeper!  Easy, too, especially using the jarred salsa verde.  Just marinate and slice the sirloin, heat up the salsa verde, chop the toppings, heat the corn tortillas, and voila!!  Tonight we're going to have beef and bean burritos with the leftovers, but there's so much you could do with the beef strips that I will always make a little extra!

We loved these!  I added the cooked meat to the sauce--one less dish.  Try shredded green and red cabbage, shredded carrots, onions for garnish.  The shredded cabbage/carrots really add a lot of crunch.  Tomato and avacado were served on the side.  This is the first "Mexican" meal I've served without some type of cheese which has always been compulsory.  I did not miss the cheese and didn't even think about it until clean up!  Hint:  white corn totillas + Pam +  350 oven = easy!

The beef was more spicy then I thought it was going to be - a happy surprise.  The sauce however was very mild and sort of bland - last minute garlic helped.

These tacos were delicious!  For some reason, AllRecipes put fresh tomatillos on my shopping list.  I've never cooked with tomatillos before, but the sauce turned out great.  I used whole wheat flour tortillas instead of corn, because I don't like corn tortillas.  Even my boyfriend loved them...and he prefers ground beef to steak.  I will definitely make these again!

Thanks for the recipe, my husband loved it! I couldn't find fresh Tomatillos  so used a jar instead and added garlic and red pepper flakes to it. Serve with Margaritas.

Not cutting up the sirloin, marinating it, actually grilling it (which is what asada means) then cutting it up would give a much better flavor.

I am definitly going to make these again.. I just had to tweak the meat a little.  We go to a little Mexican hole-in-the-wall and they have spoiled us on the best carne asada ever.  So this didn't begin to measure up to that and that was what I was hoping for.  But for me, it wasn't bad and we'll make it again.  I added quite a bit of garlic salt to the meat for a little more flavor.

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  It is truly authentic to Mexican cuisine.  I have let the meat marinate a little longer because I like to taste the lime juice, I also add fresh garlic to the meat.  One of my favorites.  A spicy pineapple salsa goes well with this!

This is a household favorite! very fresh and healthy. The tomatillo sauce is to die for, keeps well so you can use it on lots of other things. My roomate and boyfriend request this weekly. Great recipe!

My husband really liked this one and I enjoyed it, although I found the sauce very runny - I think that maybe when I added the tomatillos I should have drained the liquid from the can, but since the recipe didn't say (drained), I didn't.  I couldn't get the sauce to really thicken up.  Very nice combination of tastes though!

Not bad for carne asada made on the stove and not on the grill.  I would not recommend making the sauce.  It was time consuming and not worth the effort.

These were pretty tasty. I used New York Strip and left out the lemon at the end, opting for more lime. Also, made guacamole instead of using avocado.

Great recipe.  I did cut out the oil, felt it was unnecessary.  It was getting late so to dave time I cooked the meat, after it had marinated, in the sauce.  not enough leftovers for a meal so I sauted bellpeppers, onions and sliced baby portabellos added left over meat and sauce. Delish

This was easy to make and was good. I used KC strip steak which made it very tender. I cut back on the peppers, but it could have used more. We prefer flour tortillas so we used those. I didn't understand why you would double the tortillas up so I didn't. I marinated for a couple of hours. I will make this again.

I had to do a lot of substitution as it's the end of the month, and money and groceries are low. Good, but not as good as I'm sure they could have been - will try again when I have all the right ingredients!

This dish was absolutely delicious!  The tomatillo sauce is one of the best sauces I've ever tasted.  I bought the meat already sliced thin making the dish that much quicker to make.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

i didn't make the tomatillo sauce as all 4 grocery chains in my area didn't carry them.  The meat flavoring was great.  I would make regular old tacos with the steak with the lime juice.

Great recipe, but don’t waste your time with the tomatillo sauce. It’s mediocre, at best. The La Victoria salsa verde works as a great substitute.

This was very good.  I used bottled salsa verde instead of the canned tomatillos which was a lot easier. I also added more spices to the marinade.

The original serving  size (6) was too much for a party of 2 lol, so i'll cut it by half next time (3).  To start, I marinated the steak with olive oil, dash of salt and pepper, about 3 minced garlic, and half of lime for at least 30 min. I used a toaster oven with broil setting to cook up the meat and i cooked one side for 10 min and the other for about 5 min (this depends on the thickness of the meat of course).  Once done, i let it cool and cut it up into tiny pieces (took forever!) And i followed the instructions here with adding salt and pepper and lime (i didnt have crushed red pepper) and put it in the fridge. As another reviewer did, i also used La victoria salsa verde Mild (16 oz) for the sauce and plus the beef broth of course (i might omit this part next time as it was a bit too spicy and we only needed to put like 1/4 tsp per taco). And the rest of the instructions I followed (though the other ingredients were based on what we wanted to put. For us, we like our tacos with mostly tomato&cilantro, avocado, and some onions. Amazing recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Really, REALLY good - I'll make this again!  As suggested, I served these tacos with La Victoria Salsa Verde so skipped making the sauce and didn't use beef broth.  We found a boneless sirloin roast on sale and I sliced that into 1/2" thin steaks across the grain, tenderized those by stabbing with a fork, marinated them in lime juice, salt, and pepper, and BBQ'd them over a high flame for about 2 minutes on each side.  Cut the meat into small pieces and made soft corn tortilla tacos as per this recipe.  Excellent!

Tasted great, followed the recipe for marinating and cooking the steak, but the steak wasn't very tender. I used fresh tomatillos, since I couldn't find the canned, and used jalepenos  with some canned green chilis for the sauce and it was pretty good. I will make this again, but probably with ribeye steak.

I've made these twice now - both times using a 24 oz jar of Herdez salsa verde in place of the canned tomatillos.  I love that the meat doesn't have to marinate for hours for it to have a great flavor and the salsa/beef broth combination, when allowed to reduce to a somewhat thick sauce, just gives it that extra punch of flavor.  Definitely a great alternative to normal ground beef tacos!

Try marinating your meat (and use thin flap meat, called carne ranchera, available at any carniceria) by adding one can of beer (Tecate is my choice).  Also, the longer you marinate, the better the flavor.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. I was so excited to make this and wanted to love it, but maybe because of my high expectations, this recipe fell short. This was good, but it wasn't GOOOOOD. ;-) I made as stated except used fresh tomitillos. Not sure if I would make this again, if I want tacos that (to me) are GOOOOOOD, I would go with the cuban ropa vieja recipe from this site.

the right meat to use is shirt steak/arrachera, and also use fresh tomatillos, never anything canned.

AMAZING!!! Wouldn't change a thing of this recipe. I have made this recipe many times and each time my husband and I love it more and more! If you want it to be a quick recipe, you can buy guacamole already made and skip the green sauce. Either way it is remarkable!

This recipe is awesome!!! I did make some changes, but I don't think it altered the flavor much. I used canned jalapenos instead of fresh. We grilled the steak instead of frying it. Lastly, when I prepared my serving I lightly fried the corn tortilla in vegetable oil, added the filling (steak, onion, mozarella), and then topped it with a 2nd tortilla kind of like a quesadilla. I poured the tomatillo sauce over it. It was absolutely divine. My husband prepared his just like a taco and he enjoyed his a lot as well. Highly recommend this recipe!

This was delicious.  I too have a hard time finding canned tomatillos and therefore use canned green salsa which is basically the same thing minus the beef broth.  If preparing the tomatillo sauce, I would recommend using low sodium beef broth.  I also make fresh pico de gallo instead of the listed recommendation.  Will make again and again.

This was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  The flavors were so yummy and fresh.  The home made tomatillo sauce was the best part of the dish and not at all hard to prepare. I bought two fresh tomatillos and two fresh jalapenos and through them in the food processor, dumped it into a sauce pan coated with oil, cooked for a few minutes then added the beef broth and cooked it down.  Not that hard to do... My husband likes Ortego tacos with lots and lots of cheese and sour cream.  He did not even miss his favorites add-ons with all the delicious flavors of this recipe!  Thank you for sharing this with us.  I am already craving it again it was just so good!!!!!!!!!

I wish I could give you six stars.  I had to grind our steak but I still did everything exactly the way you said and it was awesome!!!!  Make this for a croud and they will be happy campers indeed.  Save this for football get togethers on a sunday.  I put sour cream on top of mine too but not hubby's.  Dialien thank you so very, very much.  I have it printed and saved for lots of uses in the future.  (if you can't find the tomatillo's look in the Salsa section of the store that is where I found my roasted ones.  They were wonderful.  Thanks again for a super winning  recipe.  Beverly Jane

A deelish recipe for the carne asada! I am not a tomatillo fan, and so I used two other optional toppings, fresh tomato salsa or the traditional "Tijuana Taco" syle, finely diced onion, a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, and a dollop of gucamole. The previous post mentions cutting with kitchen shears..try a big ol' sharp cleaver! (If you go to a taco shop you will hear/see it done this way!!) Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic recipe--my boyfriend and I gobbled it up. The only downside is that the steak could have a bit more flavor, but we definitely will be making it again.

Edit: Making this for the 3rd time, so I upped the star power!!

Hello I live in San Antonio Tx, and this type of recipe is called Asada,not Carne Asada because it does not have the gray, it is just the meat with spices.

My boyfriend loved these tacos, they have a bit of a spice to them, and are definitely flavorful.  You do a bit of chopping, but then you've got all the fixings for an authentic taco.  I'll definitely make these again.

I followed this recipe with a few alterations suggested by other readers, and it was exactly what I hoped it to be. I'm originally from San Diego, CA but have moved to the East coast and haven't had real, authentic tasting Mexican food in such a long time. This hit the spot. THANKS!

I have two minor complaints about this recipe.  First,  I won't be using beef broth when I make these next time and will probably opt for veggie broth instead.  The beef broth has a flavor that's out of place it permeated the tomatillo salsa.  I also found the meat to be underseasoned compared to what I'm accustomed to when I think of carne asada taco.  

I also had trouble finding canned tomatillos so I got fresh ones from Whole Foods instead.  I think that turned out for the best.

I only made the marinade and it was VERY good. I love the flavor. I can't figure out why my meat is still a little tough after marinade for so long, but I will make again because of the flavor.

I'm giving this three stars because even though I didn't care for it, my husband thought it was pretty good. Although, the meat was actually better without the sauce stuff.

this turned out really pretty good. I asked my butcher to cut the steak into very small pieces for me which made it much easier for me. I also added a little bit of organic mexican seasoning (only about 1 teaspoon for the entire thing....adds a little flavor). My husband won't eat ground beef tacos anymore after this!!
