Dianne, thank you!!!  My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I scaled it back to 4 servings and still filled a large casserole dish.  I made a few changes, and it was excellent: cornstarch instead of flour/butter roux, cayenne powder instead of red pepper flakes, Italian-seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain, fat-free evaporated milk and fat-free sour cream, and sprayed the top of the casserole with non-stick cooking spray instead of dotting with butter.  After it baked for 30 minutes, I switched to broil on Low for a couple minutes to brown the topping and make it crispy.  I will be making this again for Christmas eve, but with 8 servings this time for the family.  THANK YOU AGAIN!

Very good. The kids liked it and the men did too. It took me a while to make it though. I had to boil and then mash the sweet potatoes. I would make it again and recommend it to others.

This was very good, but the kids didn't accept the topping as well as I'd hoped. The littlest ones seemed to discern in between the "good" and "bad" parts, but I thought it was good. Definitely made me feel better about eating so much cheese. I will make this again very soon, but I will probably change up the topping a little.

Mild and mellow!  Great when served warm, just as good cold!  This was a hit with my family.  I used whole wheat macaroni and flour, and all sharp cheese when making this.

This recipe was delicious and even my very picky husband who hates sweet potatoes and saw me preparing one just for this recipe loved it! You can't taste the sweet potatoes or chickpeas. It's just mac and cheese with the nutrients you get from the chickpeas and sweet potatoes! I must say though, that the prep time took me much longer than 25 minutes because I had to make the mashed sweet potatoes prior to everything else. Also, I ran into a scalding issue with the evap. milk and roux. That wasn't really a problem in the recipe. More a problem with the clean up. The entire recipe from beginning-end took me about 2.5 hours, and I'd consider myself an intermediate cook. This recipe also made a ton of leftovers! We didn't have a 9x13 pan, so I improvised and used 2 9inch pie pans. Worked just as well and my husband liked how I just cut our mac and cheese portions into pizza-shaped triangles. :) Yes, he's a 10 year old trapped in a 30 year old's body. But I love the man. Try this recipe! Also, I recommend adding more salt to the evaporated milk/roux mixture. The mac and cheese wasn't very salty, but the cheese really packs a punch!

Great recipe.  My husband does NOT like chick peas and found the recipe printed out on the kitchen table. However, for anyone dubious about them, you cannot even taste them, so DO NOT let that stop you from making this very yummy dish.  I followed the directions exactly and used portion sizes of 1/16, which was PLENTY to eat.  I can't imagine eating more for a single serving.  I portioned it all out and am going to freeze my pieces to save as a Friday night treat instead of pizza.  My husband, however, LOVED it and wants to eat his until it's all gone.  : )   Thanks so much for sharing.

I liked this recipe, but not a lot. The sweet potato and garbanzo beans made it very filling and it was a good cheap meal. (I substituted the random cheese I had on hand(Mexi-cheese and Mozzarella) so I didn't have to go out and buy the cheddar) The flavor may have been a bit better if I used the cheddar according to the recipe.  
I'll probably try this one again! Thanks!

Really liked this recipe--my picky toddler even ate it. I did feel like it needed a greater depth of flavor, though. Next time I'll add mustard to the sauce & may consider adding a small amount of some smoked cheese (e.g., gouda) to give it a bit more of a kick. I left off the chick pea topping based on other reviews & it was still delicious. I may also try adding more sweet potatoes to the sauce & cauliflower to the noodles to make it slightly healthier. Will definitely be making again!

REALLY enjoyed this! We were looking for a healthier alternative to my 4 sons' beloved Mac & Cheese and we were surprised that everyone liked this so much! It is a bit labor-intensive, so next time I make it, I think put a few together for the freezer. I think it would re-heat nicely. Nice recipe!

It was very tasty.  I didn't have evaporated milk on hand, so just used my 1% milk from the fridge in place of both the evaporated milk and the water. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs in the topping. I only had mild shredded cheddar, too.  But other than those minor substitutions, I pretty much followed the recipe.  Oh - also used a sprinkling of an all-purpose seasoning non-salt.  It was a big hit!

Yummy recipe. I didn't put the garbanzo beans on top, instead I did seasoned matzah meal and parm cheese with a few fried onions. This was a special treat for Shavuot, and a great treat at that. Next time I will used whole wheat or quinoa noodles.

I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Everyone loved it, even my grandkids who did not think they liked sweet potato.

I am not big on macaroni and cheese but decided to make this for my three kids because of the vegetable added into it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was Delicious. I ate a huge portion even though I wasn't expecting to eat any! Make sure you dont skip the nutmeg, it adds an awesome flavor. The only thing I would like to note is that it took way longer than the mentioned time. It took me about 45 minutes, but it was worth it and my kids - even the picky 15 year old couldn't detect any sweet potatoes or beans which she hates both of! Thanks for the great creative recipe!

I made a LOT of changes on here because I am allergic to cow's milk. First,  for the topping I doubled the garbanzo beans and used nutritional yeast to taste to sub for the parmesan. In the sauce,  I replaced the evaporated milk with a can of coconut milk and doubled the sweet potatoes to help  thicken it, then added in garlic powder,  cayenne pepper, nutritional yeast, and salt to taste. Instead of cheddar I used about 1 1/2 cups goat cheddar.  I didn't bother with the layer of cheese in between,  but it still came out fine. The crust was a bit crunchy for my tastes, so next time I'll probably take it out a little sooner. 

My one complaint is that it's not as filling I would like,  but that is probably because I have usually used fresh veggie noodles to substitute for pasta for several months now.  This is my first time having pasta, even whole grain, in months

It was okay and edible, but not great.  I followed the recipe as shown.  More work than I care to do for something mediocre.
