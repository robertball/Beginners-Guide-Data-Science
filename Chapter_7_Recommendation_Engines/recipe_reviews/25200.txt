This is a wonderful recipe.  Please don't be deterred by the "extra preparation" noted in some of the reviews.  Every step is worth it, from browning the meat to deglazing the pan.  This hearty and flavorful stew satisfied my family and dinner guests.  Everyone went back for more.

I followed the recipe as written, using merlot for the red wine because I like the rich flavor and Yukon Gold potatoes because I like their taste and texture and they were on hand for the Potato Fougasse (potato bread with olive oil and rosemary) I made to accompany the stew.  They were wonderful together.  Trust your instincts when thickening the stew once it is done.  Some reviews complained about consistency but you really need to decide what it needs for yourself using more or less of a flour/water paste than indicated.  Do what works for you.  (And by the way, if you have extra merlot use it with the flour instead of water to thicken the stew to impart some extra flavor.)

Yum! This is a great basic recipe  but I did make some changes. I marinated the beef in the wine and some minced garlic for a few hours (I made this on a weekend). I floured and fried in oil as directed. I omitted the onion soup and we didn't miss it at all, but I did use beef broth in place of the water. I added celery and mushrooms, and also tossed some peas in at the very end.  I added a bay leaf and some thyme and a pinch of rosemary. Next time, I might add some tomato paste or diced tomatoes. Very tasty and hearty.

Added a little extra wine, worcestershire, and garlic powder like other users suggested, as well as a pinch of red pepper.  I ended up cooking it for 1 1/2 hours on high heat and 3 on low to speed things up a bit, and it turned out great.  This recipe is a real winner -- the meat was very tender and the gravy texture, perfect.  Served it up to rave reviews.  I'll definitely make this again!

I have to add my accolades for this recipe; it's great. Like others, we skipped the onion soup, replaced the water with beef stock, added extra veggies, and added garlic. Didn't thicken - it wasn't necessary. Slice up a tender roast that falls apart in the cooker instead of getting "stew meat." It's just plain wonderful, and after it gets a little gone, just add some corn, green beans, whatever, to make it last even longer. I don't know why, but I think it's the wine...

This is a perfectly simple, yet delicious, beef stew recipe.  I should probably rate it 5 stars, but since I slightly tweeked the recipe I give it a four since my rule is 5 stars only if I make no changes.  The only changes I made are to add 4 cloves of garlic, I used 1 cup water and 2 cups Merlot for my liquid  (it still could have used another cup of liquid), but the extra wine added a richness water could not achieve.  I also used more carrots since the pot seemed to be lacking.  Simple changes to suit our taste.  Seasoned just right...didn't add or regret not adding any seasoning.  Kept us warm and satisfied!  Thanks.

This was REALLY good...the meat was kind of dry but that might be user error ... :)  I'll still give it a 5. (of course my house still smells like stew...)

I used about 1.25# of meat or so, Lipton beefy onion soup mix, 2 small packs of baby carrots, 2 red potatoes, and 1 onion.  I didn't saute the onions in butter either.  I prepped this the night before, and next morning, popped it in the crock pot.  It cooked on low for 12 hrs (might account for the dryness).  The meat shredded easily.  My fiance thought it was tasty, so I think this recipe is a keeper.  I might add some beef broth next time for more liquid to combat the dryness.  The pepper really gives it a little kick!  I didn't have to thicken the gravy because I had dumped in the flour from the meat.

All in all, a successful first crock pot experience... :)

                    *note - I've made this several times now, and adding the can of beef broth really helps!  From now on, I'll make sure all of my crock pot dishes have enough liquid to cover the meat!  I also have been using sweet potatoes in lieu of regular potatoes...yum!

This was one delicious stew!  I am not a great fan of beef stews but this one was so good even I had seconds!  My husband thought it was outstanding.  The only thing extra I did was add about 1 1/2 cups frozen peas to have more vegetables.  I made this on a cold snowy day and the house was so full of wonderful smells our mouths were watering by dinnertime!!  I will be making this often in the winter months!

My husband has been asking me to make him some stew so I gave this recipe a try.  He loved it!  I used 2 cups of beef broth instead of 2 cups of water and also used some Au Jus seasoning with the soup mix.  I also added in some fresh garlic and mushrooms.  I will definately make this again.

I made this last night, and it turned out great, the best beef stew I ever made. I let my mom try it and she loved it. Only thing that would make it better is if I did not cut the potatoes and carrots into big chunks but bite size pieces!! Will make again.

5 stars with my revisions.  I made this for the first time and it was amazing.  I also halved the recipe.  Its just me and my hubby.  To the initial bag of flour I did add some fresh ground black pepper while shaking up the beef to coat with flour and pepper.  I used 2 carrots and 2 celery stalks and 1 can diced tomatoes.  I did add a chicken and a beef bouillion cube to the boiling water as well as the Onion Soup Mix.  And I increased the boiling water mixture by 1/4 c so that I could use it at the end to make the flour mixture to thicken the stew.  I sauted 1 medium onion and 3 garlic cloves and then added that to the bottom of the crockpot.  I also browned the meat and then removed it from the pan and then used about 1/2c of red wine (Pinot Noir) to scrape up the brown bits using my wooden spoon.  I didnt use any butter, only used Olive Oil.  To the crockpot I did add 1/2t of Paprika, 1t of Worcesetershire sauce and a couple of shakes of salt, way less then 1/2t.  I poured the wine brown bits into the crock pot.  I placed it on hi and it was ready to eat in 3 1/2hours. My God, this was so amazing.  I was in heaven, so was my hubby and it disappeared!  We ate this for 3 days straight, lunch and dinner and had double servings.  OMG, thanks for posting a great basic recipe that turned out fantastic to our tastes.

Me and my hubby did not care for this.  I used Merlot wine, maybe that had something to do with the strange flavor, I don't know.  The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but the taste did not match the smell. I won't make this again. :(

Oh my goodness this beef stew recipe was really good, I read alot I mean alot of the reviews on it and took peoples advice and added more spices (Salt, pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder) and used Lipton beefy onion dry soup mix along with beef stck instead of water and wine since we dont drink. I also added celery, peas and a large clove of garlic along with the veggies mentioned in the recipe. At first I was not to sure about the smell it was not what I was expecting but then the moment we tryed it everything was so so yummy and day 2 is even better. So try this one out because it is a sure thing!!!! Enjoy because I know I did.

Excellent stew! I did change a few things (very similar to what others have done). Veggie changes: I used about 2.5 cups baby carrots and 1 small bag of red potatoes (rinsed and put in crock-pot whole!) Instead of boiling water to mix with the dry onion soup mix I used boiling beef broth (from a carton).  I increased the red wine to 3/4 cup.  After everything was in the crock-pot it seemed like it still needed more liquid, so I added the rest of the carton of beef broth!  I omitted the last step (thickening) - didn't need it to me! Even my 3 year old nephew loved this dish and he is a very picky eater!  This is a keeper for sure.

I did have to tweak this recipe a bit, but I still believe it's worthy of a five star rating. I could never make a stew without adding some garlic, and so 5 minced cloves went into the crock pot. I also added some celery chunks and replaced the water with a hearty red wine. Super delicious, warming and hearty!

And please remember, you don't have to follow recipes to a T. If you have a little cooking experience under your belt, then use your own instincts to make these recipes yours. For instance, some reviewers gave a lower rating to this recipe because they thickened the stew too much. But that's completely avoidable. Simply add the water/flour mixture slowly, stir and see how thick it gets. If it's thick enough before you use it all up, stop. You're done. Oh, and using red wine in place of the water for thickening will give a deep, layered flavor to your stew this is fabulous. If you don't like cooking with wine, then I would advise using beef broth in place of the water in this recipe.

This is the best stew I have ever eaten! Everyone in the family loves when I make it.  I only change a couple things. Instead of using a bag to mix the beef and flour mixture in, I find it easier to use a medium container with lid. It coats more evenly and is a bit less messy. I also prepare the Lipton onion soup with one cup water and one cup wine, and use about 1/2 cup wine at the end instead of 1/4 cup.  Yes, it sounds like a bit much wine, but it adds wonderful flavor (I use Merlot).

Good stew! While I enjoyed this quite a bit, I still prefer the stew recipe from my "Fix it & Forget It" cookbook that I stumbled upon years ago. This recipe is really just a pot roast in stew form. The next time I make this, I'd do just that - skip the stew meat and instead add a large roast to my slow cooker (or set the expectation up front and call this "pot roast stew"). I'd also bulk up on the carrots (love em!), add some celery and serve over egg noodles to sop up the yummy gravy. I pretty much followed IAMROSIE's directions to the letter except for subbing beef broth for the water added to the corstarch mixture (I had just enough for that but not enough to sub for the boiling water added to the onion soup mix) and using beefy onion mix instead of plain 'ol onion soup mix (again, because I didn't have enough broth to sub for the H2O called for). I also peeled my potatoes (personal preference). My wine of choice was merlot. I cooked everything exactly as directed with excellent results. NOTE: Don't let the cornstarch mixture fool you.... I thought it would be a slurry (i.e. watery), but it turned out to be a very thick paste. Once added to my slow cooker, it dissolved and worked its magic! :) Served with J.P.'s big daddy's biscuits and simple baked apples for dessert (two recipes on this site), this was a nice fall meal. Thanks for sharing, IAMROSIE! :-)

Really good, it took about 45 minutes to prep. I doubled the meat, let it marinade in about 1 cup of red wine and minced garlic. Then tossed them in the flour and seasonings, and browned little at a time as to not crowed the meat.  I used 2 cups of beef broth instead of water and used another 1 cup of red wine and dried fresh thyme from my garden. It was amazing..

This was sooo delicious! Even my picky kids ate it. I followed it exactly except I marinated the meat for 3 hours in red wine and 2 tablespoons soy sauce. I also used half the onion and eliminated salt since I had used soy sauce in the marinade. The meat was really tender and full of flavor. I am tossing out all my other beef stew recipes!

Delicious and healthy! I used all of the reviewer reccommendations and think all the fresh veggies make it the best. My favourites are sweet potato, green beans, mushrooms and peas- yum! I only used one onion and less butter than reccommended and it is still amazingly flavourful- mmmm!

Made this for my New Year's party and it was a hit. It turned out to be way to much to fit in my 3.5 qt slow cooker, so I did it in an enameled cast iron pot with lid in the oven. Added a bit more liquid, started at 300 for half an hour, then down to about 240. I thought it would still take 7 hours, but it took much less. I'm not sure exactly, but I think it was around 4 hours. Came out great, and even better the next couple of days.

This is a fantastic stew.  However, as the servings imply, it is a very big recipe.  This will not fit in a 5-quart Crockpot.  To make it fit, I eliminated one pound of beef, two potatoes, and one onion.

Wow!  We love, love, LOVE this beef stew!  We made some modification based on what other reviewers had said, and the final product was amazing.  We browned the flour and salt, plus 1/2tsp. paprika and garlic covered meat, then put it in the crockpot.  In the same pan as the meat, I browned the onions until soft, then added 4 Tbsp. minced garlic, waited until it was fragrant, and then turned off the heat and added 3/4 of wine, making sure to scrape all the browned bits up. Then I put that mixture in the crockpot. I added the carrots, parsley, pepper, and onion soup like the recipe called for, and exchanged the water for beef broth, and added 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp. Paprika, 2 Bay leafs, 1 tsp. thyme and rosemary.  I omitted the potatoes, and served it over egg noddles.  

This made for an amazing stew!  Can't wait to make it again!

Wonderful recipe - this is a keeper! Took a little longer than 15 minutes for the prep (unless all your vegies/potatoes are pre-cut), so maybe expect more like 30 minutes for the prep. I followed the recipe pretty closely except for liberally adding a few teaspoons of garlic (crushed - the fresh garlic that comes in a jar) and making the liquid half bordeaux wine and half water. Loved the flavor and aroma the wine added, but next time I will probably use beef stock instead of the water and maybe add some Worcestershire sauce to give it a more robust beefy taste - and make the total liquid added to the slow cooker equal about a cup more than specified in the recipe. I wouldn't be shy about adding a few more spices - like rosemary, fresh ground black pepper, etc. to taste. I don't like the idea of the MSG in the onion soup mix, but I would not leave the onion soup mix out - this recipe benefits tremendously from its taste. I think it would definitely be missing something significant without it. I cooked mine overnight because I work very long days (11-hours) so cooking it through the day was not an option. I cooked it on high for about 1.5 hours and turned it down to low for another 5 hours. It came out with the vegies maybe just a touch too al-dente. I might consider adding another hour cooking at low next time. I didn't thicken the liquid at the end - it didn't need it. The meat turned out very tender and moist. Keep the size of potatoes and vegies small and bite-sized.

This was fantastic!  I didn't use onion soup mix, only beef broth and red wine and I added a few hot peppers for heat, but the flavour was perfect!    My guests loved it as well.  Enjoy!

Great stew! Had lots of flavor, not bland like a lot of beef stews are. I did increase the wine a little bit.

Update: I just had to say, I like this more every time I make it!  The only addition I make is some garlic and mushrooms, and more wine than called for.  It's the best beef stew I've ever had. Hand's down!  Original review: WOW!  This was delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used a little less stew meat (round steaks I had in the freezer, chopped up) and onion (2 instead of 3) and more carrots.  I added button mushrooms about an hour and a half before the end of the cooking time.  I didn't have beef/onion soup mix, just regular onion for dip and such, so I added a teastpoon of instant beef bullion to it and the water.  I used Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine as it's what I had.  Otherwise, I followed as close as I could.   It smelled wonderful cooking and tasted even better.  My only regret is I didn't think to bake a loaf of crusty french bread to go with it.  This will be my go-to stew recipe from now on!

Oh my word. I have high cholesterol so I substituted the beef with boneless chicken breast. My husband was skeptical, but he ate 4 bowls of this heart healthy version. This recipe is so delicious there were no complaints of the missing beef.

I've had this recipe for over 30 years only I now put one bottle of beer instead of the wine and my husband flips over this version. Give it a try-the beer adds another layer of heartiness to the stew.Mmmmmm!

I loved this stew.  I did make some adjustments.  I doubled the sauce (water/soup), and added extra seasonings such as garlic, salt, pepper, worsteshire, and whatever else I felt like that day.  It is one of our go to recipes now.

This was awesome! Everyone, even my picky daughter LOVED IT. The extra steps were worth it! Crockpots aren't just for throwing everything in and forgetting it, it's for SLOW cooking - so I really didn't mind the extra work. :)

This was pretty good. I actually made it on the stovetop instead of in the slow cooker. The flavor was good, but I'm giving it only 3 starts because I use my slow cooker for one main reason: to save time. With all the peeling and chopping and pre-cooking in this recipe, it's not really a time-saver and I think violates the main principal of what  slow cooker meal should be.

This was the best ever beef stew!  It will most definitely replace the other recipe I've followed for years.  De glazing the pan was really important to add all the flavours from the pan.  I didn't have (don't like) red wine but DID have red wine vinegar on hand so used that instead.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly (halved it though....all that wouldn't fit into my slow cooker!!)
Delicious!!  Make it!!

Great stew.  I used other's suggestions with the Worcestershire sauce and more red wine.  I added a teaspoon of minced garlic, a bay leaf, and celery.  Perfect fall/winter staple.

I'm sorry to knock the recipe just made it but this tasted like it could have come out of a can. I will stick with my usual way of making stew so it doesn't all turn to mush. The veggies should have been added hours after the beef stewed and the flour made it thicker than it should be.

I have been making stew for years, and quite honestly, my family doesn't like it.  I thought I would try this one, and wow!  They devoured it and asked for more.  It's a little time consuming to make, but the end result is totally worth it.  Don't change a thing, just follow the recipe.  Wonderful!

Loved this recipe! I used a Barefoot Merlot and chicken stock instead of the 2c of water, and it was fabulous! Great for a fall day, it had the house smelling so good and was delicious and filling! Definitely my go-to recipe for beef stew!

... Meh... I think that next time I will substitute 1-1 1/2 tsp of Clubhouse Montreal Steak Spice (in the US, I think it's McCormicks Steak Spice) in place of both the salt and pepper to better enhance the flavour of the beef

This is excellent!  I did read reader's comments and took them to heart.  I would suggest a few changes as that I can see this being a little bland without them.  Use beef stock and not water. Thicken with wine and flour, not water and flour. Wine... Uh.. more wine... (never too much wine! lol) I added garlic as well as some Worcestershire sauce.  Also added peas and mushrooms as that I am a huge fan of mushroom.  I did a lot of eyballing for my additions and some tasting here and there.  My first beef stew and this is a WINNER!. Thanks!

This smelled so good when it was cooking! I seasoned beef well before shaking in flour, with salt, pepper, garlic powder. I didnt have onion soup mix but i added 1tbs of dried thyme, pepper, and onion powder. i used about 4 large cloves of garlic with the onion when i sauteed, and about 1 cup of red wine. SOOOOOO good. I added the veggies in the last couple hours of cooking so they wouldnt be too mushy. Thanks for the recipe, yum!

Very good basic recipe...as with all recipes, you have to make it your own.  I used Beefy-onion soup mix instead of just onion, added a little more wine and more spices (sage, tyme and a little basil)  used Natures Seasoning instead of salt and some frozen peas 10 min. before serving and it all came out wonderfully!

This turned out very well for my first beef stew.  Chose it because it did not require beef boullion cubes or other such additives.  I was worried about the quantity, having read other reviews which suggest that it will not fit a crock pot.  Space was not a problem in my slow cooker, despite using the full amount of meat, vegetables, etc.  I added an extra 1/4 cup red wine and used whole wheat flour.  Didn't have onion soup mix, so used fried red onions, about 1/2 c, and 1/2 t salt and it still turned out very flavourful.  Subtle flavour, though.  Great with Never Fail Biscuits, another allrecipe product.

So good!!!  The only minor changes I made were adding garlic powder to the meat dredge, adding more wine, and adding more veggies (why not beef it up with parsnips and celery?!?).  Mine certainly did not make 12 servings because my husband kept filling his bowl to the top.  I would say this made closer to 6-8 servings of a medium bowl.  Will make it again!

When I made this recipe as written it was kind of bland. The next time I made it i used beef broth instead of water, it was delicious.

This was seriously so good and so easy!!!  I am not very experienced in the kitchen and looked at a lot of different recipes before settling on this one.   I stuck to the recipe exactly, except I used wine instead of water when adding at the flour at the very end.  Everything else was exactly as the recipe called for.  Oh and we did it on high for 90 mins and low for 3 hours because we got a late start.  There was plenty of gravy, and it was the perfect consistency.  We had my mother in law over for dinner and she said it was the best stew she'd ever had. Score! Stick to the recipe - you won't be sorry!  Served it with a side salad, some sour dough bread...yum!

I love beef stew made in the crockpot but it is not necessary to brown the beef or onions ahead of time - besides, why go to all that trouble if you are looking for an easy dish to put together. It really does taste the same.

Simply amazing! This is the best beef stew Ive ever had! Wow. I followed the directions to the letter. Dont let the extra prep deter you. It is well worth it in the flavor department. I did add some celery and mushrooms, as well as some garlic. This was fantastic and cant wait to make it again!!!

Great recipe.  I did add worcestershire as others suggested and think it definitely nice flavor to the broth.  I did add a little more wine than the recipe called for and it still tasted really good.  Next time I may try to add some condensed beef broth instead of the extra wine though.  Very delicious!!

I added celery.  Could probably use less meat next time.  I subbed thyme and rosemary for the parsley but still found this to be somewhat lacking in flavour.

This was delicious. My own remark would be that when adding red wine to it, to be sure that it is very dry and not sweet.  I had on hand some red dry marsala, which is a sweet wine, and it made the stew too sweet.  Otherwise it would have been perfect.

I normally find stews bland, but this recipe has a lot of flavor.  I've made it a few times now.  Takes a bit of work at the beginning, but it can be left alone all day.  It makes a nice smell throughout the house.

I have made this twice, both times for 50 or more people. I only modify the red wine to beef stock. 
I add other seasonings, to our taste, but who doesn't? This is a wonderful recipe, and a definate keeper.  To mention, I have made this for teens and adults as a Halloween meal and add orzo, to make maggot stew :)  EVERYONE loves it!

This stew is outstanding. I've made a lot of beef stews and this one is among my favorite recipes. All I added was a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce and a bit extra ground black pepper. Thanks for a winner!

Great recipe.  I also added a few of my own touches including worchester, beef boullion , fresh garlic and
a touch of stewed tomatoes.  The wine really gave it a full flavor.  Everybody will love it.  Plus I only used 1 1/2 lbs of beef and it was more than enough!

This was a very good basic recipe, but it definitely could have used more flavor.  Next time I will probably marinate the beef in the red wine and some garlic. But the extra preparation in the skillet was definitely worth it.  I will be making it again, just with more seasoning!

This was a very good stew! The only reason it has 4 stars and not 5 is that I am not a big "stew" person...but my hubby loved it! I did following some of the recommendations though, such as substituting the water for beef broth and adding a bit more then called for. I also used red potatoes since the recipe didn't specify and they are my favorite,and garlic when sauteing the onions. Overall, a very good meal and I will defiantly be making it again!

Very, very good.  I must admit to two errors:  I left the house and thought I'd have time to stop back & turn it down to low.  I didn't, so it cooked on High for about 7 hours.  It was still moist and delicious.  The meat was fall apart tender.  The flavor was excellent.  I think the wine and the butter are key.

SO good. I kept to the recipe, simply following suggestions to use yellow potatoes and merlot. I also used garlic pepper on the meat while browning it. I didn't bother to thicken the stew at the end, since it was plenty thick enough for my family's taste. We loved it and will be making this again.

Very tasty recipe.  The prep time was greater than 15 min for me. I get my stew meat at Costco and the pieces are too big so I had to cut them and trim a little.  Then I had to peel the potatoes and the browning takes a while.  I would say the prep time was closer to 30 min, maybe more, but very worth it because it was a delicious stew.

I made this last night and followed the recipe except for omitting the mushrooms and wine because I did not have any.  This had no more flavor than when I have just placed everything in the crockpot without taking extra steps.  I Was somewhat disappointed that I had taken the time to fry the beef and saute the onions.  I did add beef consome instead of water but still no additional flavors that I was looking for.

VERY easy and quick.  I took some of the other cook's advice and replaced water with beef broth, added a beef boullion cube and peas.  tasted amazing and the aroma was great.  I also doubled the amount of carrots and used red potatoes.

I do not like Beef Stew but THIS is NOT "beef stew"  - it is HEAVEN!!!  Like so many others, I substituted the water with wine.  I also ended up using veggie soup mix because I couldn't find the onion soup mix... I added extra dried minced onion to it and I also added three cloves of chopped garlic and 1/4 tsp of Thyme along with a pinch of rosemary...  it was sooo good that the 12 servings I made fed four people with just enough left over for us to all eat lunch today.

This is a great recipe. My kids love it. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of 2 modifications that I make. I substitute sweet potatoes for regular potatoes (really nice flavor in stew), and I add quartered mushrooms.

I thought this was a pretty simple and hearty stew. I added some celery, about 1 cup also some garlic about 2 cloves. I didnt thicken it up at the end because I used russet potatos and they seemed to do the job. I made dumplings to go with it instead of bread or buns. All of the ingredients didnt fit inside my crock pot, and I have a fairly huge one. So what I did was used a roasting pan and set the oven to 350F and cooked the stew for 1 hour before turning the oven down to 200F. I let the stew cook for 5 hours stiring once in a while. It turned out great and the meat was tender and falling apart. I will make this again for sure!

Best meal I have ever made!!!  I'm not joking. Only difference is that instead of the 1/4 cup of water and flour at the end I used about a TBS of corn starch. 
Also, i made a mistake that turned out for the better. I used 1/4 cups of Merlot i used 2 cups. Let's just say that the kids went to bed a little early. KIDDING. But i did use 2 cups. Tasted great.

As it appears, I give it 3 stars.  I tasted it before I added the flour/water at the end and I found it really bland.  I added in a few dashes of garlic powder, salt, paprika, and about 2 tablespoons of A1 sauce and it made it a 4 star.  I would suggest adding more spices to it because it lacks flavor.

It had an okay flavor but there were so many ingredients (and I have the larger sized crock pot), that it made my flour coated meat mushy and my potatoes mushy too. Even though I browned it, I found flour sticking to the sides of the pot at bottom.

WONDERFUL! 
I followed advice of several other reviews.  I used 2 1/2 cups Merlot and 1/2 to 3/4 cups water.  I was worried at first because you could taste the wine however after cooking approx 7 hrs in crockpot I could not taste it.  I also used bay leaves, extra salt is a must.
Would be a great dinner to put in crock pot before leaving for work.

This was a real hit with my family.  I make a few changes when I made it, I did not have red wine, so I added some worcestershire sauce.  It was wonderful, and not hard to make.

This was good.  It did taste a little bland so I added a bay leaf and a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce, a dash of thyme and some more salt and pepper. I let it cook for another half hour or so.  Overall a good recipe that can be adapted to your family's taste.

This recipe was excellent.  It was the first one I used from this web site.  Two people have already asked me for the recipe -- and one of them I consider an excellent cook!!  I added italien seasonings, worcestershire sauce, one bay leaf and mushrooms.  I doubled the wine, decreased the potatoes by one as well as the onions.

I've made this a couple of times now and it's been a big hit.  I did add a few more spices (rosemary, garlic and tyme) and throw in extra veggies and some celery.  It's exactly what you think of when you think of beef stew - and it does make the house smell WONDERFUL!
Thank you very much for sending this one in, Rosie T.!

With this recipe, I cooked the best stew I have ever made to date.  My other stews were never this tasty, nor the meat so tender...this beef was falling apart and you could break it apart with the slightest touch from a spoon.  Even the leftovers were amazingly tender, and I think the flavor just got better.  Didn't change a thing.  Filing this one in my bag of tricks.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

This turned out to be the best beef stew I've ever made. We did, however, adjust the seasoning thusly: omitted onion soup mix and boiling water and replaced with 2 cups of beef stock plus 1 heaping teaspoon minced garlic and 2 tsps Herbs d'Province. Added 2 tsps of sweet Paprika to the dredging flour. We used a Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine which worked great. Oh and we added 1/2 lb of sauteed mushrooms with the vegetables. It was so good!

This was absolutely fab.  I also marinated the mean in wine overnight and also added a bit of garlic powder and salt.  The mean fell apart like a pot roast; simply wonderful.

Delish. Well balanced flavors. I added a few cloves of garlic, fresh parsley and a mix of shallots and onions. Didn't need to thicken the sauce at all. Served w crusty garlic bread. We all wanted to lick our bowls.

This is the best beef stew I have ever had. Don't be discouraged by the extra prep time. It is completely worth it. I've made this stew at least 10 times and have changed a few things. I just use a big bowl to coat the meat in flour and salt. It seems a little easier than messing around with a bag. I also only use one large onion and one head of celery (instead of 3 onions). I tried substituting the red wine with red wine vinegar once and I think it's better with red wine. I cook the entire 12 servings for just my husband and I. It's worth it, it feeds us for days!

It is a very good, rich recipe when made with broth instead of water, but the family found it a bit boring - with no distinctive flavors. I found it to be good comfort food.

This recipe was the best ever! I follow the instructions and I had to do one again the following week since everyone was asking for more. I added the carrots and some potatoes 3 hours before it was done, don't like them to be mushy. I also added a little bit of fresh garlic, and believe it the aroma was so great that it was driving all of us crazy before it was done. I highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good meal and not so much of a hustle!

My husband couldnt even put his fork down!  Like others on here I didnt have to add the ending ingredients to make it thicker it didnt need it.  I did add more pepper and salt, and only used 1 lg. onion I felt 3 was over kill.  I had a few user errors and had some issues with opening the wine.  Although my walls now have purple wine stains I will make it again =)

Great recipe! I added celery and used beef broth because I did not have any onion soup mix on hand. I could have added a little more salt, but I figure it was because of the change in ingredients. Next time I will use the onion mix. My whole family enjoyed it! It is great comfort food!

Pretty good, but we didn't have onions so I think that's why ours was a bit bland.  We added a bunch of other seasonings and then it was great.

Great Stew.   Someone had suggested placing a sprig of Rosemary on top during cooking ... I have a Rosemary bush, so added 3 long sprigs.  I thought it was a little too much Rosemary flavor, but my Husband and his Sister loved it that way!

Awesome stew!  Would have gotten 5 but prep work isnt a part of crocking for me.

I used double the liquid and instead of water used beef broth.  

I added mushrooms. 

I didnt add flour at the end but i think it is because I didnt shake off excess flour when i browned the meat..Which i was scared i would overcook but didnt go me! 
I also prepped the meat and onions and deglazed pan the day before and put in fridge the day before b/c day of I  knew i only had time to toss in 

This makes it in to my recipe book.

Super delicious!  I used venison and basically didn't have time to do all the beforehand stuff so I just threw everything in the slow cooker and hoped for the best!  It was SO GOOD!  My meat was super tender and the onion soup mix adds a lot of flavor to this!  We all loved it!

At first I was worried this was going to be a bland stew due to the lack of seasonings.  I used a previous posters suggestion to use beef broth instead of water, and I added some celery, mushrooms and frozen peas as well.  Very tasty, I will be making again.

I tweaked this a little bit, added 2 ribs of celery (love that bold flavor!), 2 cloves of bruised garlic, 3 tbls of worcestershire,  2 good sized bay leaves, and an additional cup and a half of water

Base recipe is the perfect stating point for making it your own. The modifications I have made are as follows.
I used a 2 lb london broil cut into 1/2-3/4" squares and added a can of Cambells Golden Mushroom soup to the 2-cups of boiling water. I also cut the potatoes into 1/2-3/4" pieces and sliced to carrots to about a 1/4" thick. I also added 1-cup of frozen peas. The Golden mushroom soup will thicken it to the point that you won't need the 2-tablespoons of flour in step 4. I've cooked this four times (including today) and the family loves it!

The basic recipe was the formula for a better beef stew.  I made the following modifications-

- Added four tablespoons of worcestershire sauce
- Added celery stalks, cut down into 3" stalks
- Added about a 1.5 cups of early peas, ON TOP of the stew to keep the peas from getting crushed, in the last fifteen minutes of cooking.
- Used two tablespoons of garlic salt, and two tablespoons of lemon pepper with the flour for coating the beef.
- Used Dutch mini potatoes- Cut the oversized ones in half place and place at the bottom of the crockpot.
- Used Vidalia (sweet onions), cut in quarters, peeled and then then hand separated for sauteeing purposes
- Used 1/2 cup of Burgundy wine and a tablespoom of minced garlic to marinate the meat, overnight.
- Cut back on the stewing beef used to only 2 pounds
- Used a packet of Swansons beef base sauce
- Went a little extra heavy on the veggies

I too made this for the first time and absolutely loved it.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it and had two bowls of it.  I followed it exactly except I did not have any onions, but overall it was great.  I like the idea of the wine as I put wine in my tomato sauce, too.  Definitely a keeper.

I just made this today for the first time and followed the recipe exactly, but added a jalapeno for some spice! I tasted it about 3/4 the way thru and decided it needed some salt for flavor. Those are the only two things I did differently and it came out great!!

I didn't saute anything, just threw it all in the crockpot.  I added the meat first and mixed the flour on top.  I also used two cups of beef broth instead of water.  It was perfect and easy!

Best beef stew recipe yet! I modified it by tenderizing the meat first, and I just throw everything in the crockpot (no need to brown the meat if you are pressed for time).

Wonderful recipe! I forgot to get onions at the grocery store, so I sauteed canned mushrooms in the butter with a bit of minced onion instead, then deglazed the pan with merlot. I also used cornstarch to thicken it instead of flour. It turned out amazing! My family raved about it, and it will be a regular dish at our house!

Great recipe to start with! However, you'll have to "tweek" them to suit your taste buds. My changes: Seasoned the meat with garlic powder, black pepper and adobo then marinaded in 1 cups of Worcestershire & 1/4-1/2 cup hot pepper sauce combo min. 8 hrs (the longer the better). I also poured the marinade in the crock pot with approx. 1 1/2 to 2 cup of red wine and 1 cup of beef broth. I omitted using plain water in lieu of wine. I found that its best to use enough liquid to at least cover the meat. 2 bay leaves, 3 red potatoes, 2 sweet potatoes, 3 celery stalks, 3-5 carrots, 1 spanish onion, 1 1/2 of chopped garlic, 1-2 Tblsp fresh thyme, 1-2 Tblsp fresh rosemary, 2 bay leaves. I omitted the onion soup. The quantity of veggies depends on the size of your pot. I DID brown the stew beef as directed. Next time I will saute the garlic and onions to soften. Lastly, the amount of warm water and flour "slurry mix"  you'll need will depend on how much "juice" you have. I strongly recommend checking near end of your cooking time. I added a little at a time then thicken to the way I wanted it. BTW the second day the stew was even better! The Worcestershire and fresh herbs brought the dish together!

This so yummy. My husband and I had to restrain ourselves from digging into before it was done because it smelled so good!  2 out of 3 kids gobbled it up.  The one kid who didn't eat it is my kid who usually eats anything and the other 2 are the picky ones - go figure!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It is a perfect cold fall or winter day supper - definitely comfort food!

This recipe is a must try!  Each step is worth it, take your time while making this stew.  I used a cabernet sauvingnon for the red wine and served the remainder of the bottle with dinner, it pairs perfectly with beef stew.  Also added whole white mushrooms (halved) and 3 cloves garlic.  Only used 2 onions, used beef broth instead of water.  Thickened with corn starch.  Turned out absolutely delicious and this will be a favorite cold day recipe!

I have never in my life made beef stew before.. I am just not a big beef fan..  but I decided to give this a whirl to please my boyfriend.. and, I can't lie-- it was YUMMY. We used just super cheap 'Beef Stew' Beef Chunks, and the meat came out *so* tender and delicious. Packed the pot full of veggies as well. Super yummy! My boyfriend enjoyed it even better the next day for lunch!  Used white wine instead of red.. because that's all we had around... but it came out fantastically. Adding this to me ever-growing rolodex of awesome CrockPot recipes!

This was perfect the first time I made it and I didn't change a thing.  It's the only beef stew I make now and I've been making it for a couple years now. The only thing I consistently change is adding beef broth instead of water and putting in celery. Thanks so much!!!

I'm a novice at slow cooking and I have to say this is the best beef stew I have ever tasted. I changed it quite a bit to suit my tastes, and used the recipe for the basic guidelines on how to prepare it, cooking times, and liquid amounts. I substituted the onion soup mix with garlic powder, dried chopped onions, and used beef stock instead of water. I also used olive oil instead of butter when I sauteed the onions, and added 1 tablespoon of paprika. I prefer London Broil instead of stew meat. I like the tenderness and the reduced fat. It saves prep time. Overall, great recipe!!  Additional Items Added:  3 cloves of garlic 1 tbs of paprika 1 cup of mushrooms 1/2 can of peas 1/2 can of corn 1 can of diced tomatoes with juice extra carrots (large not baby) Beef stock instead of water Homemade Onion Mix instead of store bought (I didn't want added sodium) London Broil instead of stew meat

We just tried this stew last week after my husband found it and requested it. Since I was running short on time, I took another reviewer's advice and put it on high for 1 1/2 hours and low for another 3 hours. The carrots were still hard so we cranked it back on high for another 30 minutes. Next time, I am going to try it with the regular timing. The flavor and consistency of the stew was perfect. I also used a full bag of baby carrots and a bit more potato than the recipe called for and it was not a problem. The only other thing I would mention is that the prep time is a "crock"...excuse the pun... 15 minutes is laughable... More like 45 min- 1 hour. Otherwise, a very delicious stew recipe. I will certainly make it again.

Awesome, perfect consistency too.  I only used 1 T. of butter just to cut down on the fat a bit and added 2 bay leaves, but followed everything else to a T.  The wine makes all the difference!

This was fantastic, I'll definitely do it again. I'd probably add more carrots and a bit less onion.

I also replaced water with wine, as well as flour with cornstarch (at half of the required amounts).

WONDERFUL! Next time I will double the wine (I used a good Merlot).
This time I didn't have onions so I skipped that step and sauteed the baby carrots instead. I also couldn't find onion soup mix so I substituted it with "beef vegetable soup mix". I allowed it to cook in the slow cooker for 9 hours (couldn't get home in time to do it for 6) and the beef did not get dry or tough; but the potatoes broke down a bit so I did not have to add the flour @ the end.

My husband made this tonight for dinner and it one of the best stews I've had. Here are the changes he made. He used Montreal Steak seasoning in lieu of salt. Added some peas and used 3 cups beef broth instead of water. Double the water/flour for thickening and added the onion at the end so they were neither tough nor mushy. YUM this will go in our recipe books.

What else can I say but yum! It was so filling. I added extra meat, celery, used red potatoes instead, and less onions since my husband is not so fond of those, but it had such a nice flavor and was very easy to make. It made alot we had stew for days it seemed  ;) Will make many more times I am sure

WOW! I signed up just to rate this recipe. It was delicious. I did like the others by adding beef stock and also added celery and one clove of minced garlic. I also did 1/3c of wine cause one review said it needed maybe a bit more...and it was PERFECT!!!!
Thanks so much for posting this beef stew because its so hard to find good recipes and such a disappointment when you waste time and food making something that itsn't good. SO, great job to the chef for putting this one together.. I reccomend you try it, you won't be disappointed :)

This stew was sooo easy.  I gave the recipe to my husband and he made it when i was at work.  To save time we threw everything in the pot, so no browning or makeing the rue.  We also omited the wine since we don't keep wine in the house.  Added 1-2 tablespoons of brown gravy mix.  It turned out soo tasty!

This was soooooo good!  I used merlot for ALL of the liquid in this recipe.  I used Lawrey's saesoned salt and added some coarse ground black pepper and used fresh parsley.  I did not need to thicken this at all.  It was rich and thick and delicious and so tender!  I WILL be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Absolutely delicious!! The kids are finishing up their second helpings right now.  I made a few changes just for our personal tastes. I added rosemary, pepper, season salt and the parsley to the flour for the meat. I also did one onion instead of three, used beef broth instead of water & an extra cup of water with a little Worchestersire sauce in it(Just because the 2 cups of broth was not enough to cover the meat and veggies).  This is one of the BEST meals that I have tried from this site. Worth every second of the effort it took!

I made this stew but changed a few things.  I used beer rather than wine, used a package of "beef stew mix" rather than the onion soup mix...and to thicken it up a bit (I like thicker stew) at the last half hour or so I added mashed potato flakes.  Served it to about 10 people...everyone said it was the best stew they EVER had...HUGE hit! Thanks!

This recipe makes awesome beef stew. The only change I made was to substitute beef broth for water. I also doubled the amount of liquid.

This is very good beef stew! I do have to make a couple changes though. I cut the onion way back (to only 1/2 an onion) and I also add salt to the stew toward the end of the cooking time - it definitely needs it. I also find the flour/water at the end to be completely unnecessary. In fact, mine is usually so thick that I have to add a little beef broth to thin it out a little. Cooking the potatoes all day thickens it up nicely. Last time I made it, I didn't have any wine and I didn't miss it at all so I'll probably just omit it from now on.

This beef stew was really good, but I couldn't rate it 5 stars because I felt it lacked flavor.  Maybe more salt or spices?  Something.  But overall it was very good.

This is very good.  There is a bit of prep but it's worth it!  I have a 3 quart crock and this was almost too much until it cooked down a bit.  Next time I'll use 2 potatoes, 1-2 pounds meat.  I like onions but I thought 3 was way too many so I only used one.  To cut down on calories and fat I eliminated the butter and olive oil and used cooking spray instead.  Delicious and filling.

This is my favorite recipe on this site.  I've made it 4 or 5 times.  Each time I do something a little different, and it's always good.  I use Bacardi rum instead of wine because I like the taste better.  I also don't like dry meat, so I add about a half cup of water right before it starts cooking.  I also use frozen hashbrowns instead of potatoes, and frozen diced onions.  It's a time saver, and tastes delicious.

This recipe was so good. i use wine with the flour. I put in 2 extra can's of beef broth. It turned out really good. It taste alot like Dinty Moore Beef stew in the can. But this was a better version of it. It's a keeper in my recipe cookbook. I will make it again.

My family of 5 are all picky eaters. They LOVED this recipe. I have tried many beef stews only to have the meat be chewy and the broth watery. Not this one! I made some variations: Added some celery in with the potatoes,and added 1 bay leaf. I also sauteed 16 oz. fresh mushrooms in with the onions, and used 6 tbsp. butter instead of 3. I added 3 tbsp. flour at the end. Yum! Perfect on a cold winters day.

This beef stew is soooo good, I too made some changes.  I reduced the meat to two pounds, I used beef broth instead of water, I used fresh parsley instead of dried.  I seasoned the flour with garlic salt and seasoning salt before browning the meat.  I also added celery, corn, basically any veggies I had on hand.  I also added a can of tomato sauce because my boyfriend likes his beef stew to be a little tomatoey. Very good basic recipe, just doctor it up with your own ingredients!  A little more wine, splash of worcesthire sauce..

Great recipe, but 15mins prep time?  C'mon!  Not saying its not worth it, but budget probably 30-45mins prep.

Absolutely delicious! Great consistency! This is what beef stew should be like... thick not soupy. Most of the recipes I've tried use tomato juice or V-8, and the end result is too "soupy". This stew comes out more like what my grandmother would call a "goulash". Very hearty and flavorful. A definite keeper; will make this one again and again!

Excellent recipe. Rich flavor. Tender beef. Followed the recipe but added some extra spices (red pepper flakes, garlic powder, paprika, nutmeg, and crushed dried vegetables mix that I already had). Also used only 1.5 lbs of beef and it seemed like a lot anyway. Skipped the thickening part at the end because it seemed thick enough. Will definitely make this again, husband approved. Thanks for the great recipe!

This stew is great! I followed a lot of the suggestions from other reviews, adding a little extra wine in place of the water. I also added 1 T. of worchestershire sauce to the beef while I browned it. When I cooked the onions, I added some sliced fresh mushrooms and 4 cloves of chopped garlic as well. The stew turned out wonderfully. I probably spent 30-45 minutes in prep time, but I had extra ingredients to slice, and was working in a very tiny apartment kitchen so I have to wash dishes as I work. This was my first time using a crock pot (it was a wedding gift back in June)and I was very impressed with the results. I'll deffinately keep making this recipe all winter! The leftovers are great microwaved for lunch the next day!

This was really tasty but I'm only giving it 3 stars because the meat was on the dry side, although it was tender...  Perhaps I used the wrong cut of meat or possibly overcooked it (8 hrs on low, 3 hrs on warm) OR there wasn't enough liquid.  I substituted the 2 cups of water for 1 can of beef broth, thinking that the less liquid would be ok since my stews have the tendancy to "create" too much liquid. I added: more wine than the recipe asked; the worchestershire sauce as suggested; about 1 1/2 c of frozen peas to the last 30 mins of cooking; and about 2 cups of mushrooms but will add more next time. Next time (and there will be a next time!) I will use 2 cans of beef broth and more veggies.  Delish!

Sorry - none of my family liked this.  It smelled wonderful and the meat was very tender but it had very little colour and even less flavor.  There was way too much fluid - if I were to make this again I would consider not adding any water at all but doubling or tripling the wine.  Try adding some celery, garlic, Dijon mustard or anything else that adds some flavor.

This was a delicious stew Rosie.  I left out the celery and parsley and stirred in a spoonful of dijon mustard while it was simmering in the crock pot.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes to make up for the celery (that I didn't have) and it turned out really good.  Two thumbs up.

I prepped everything the night before, put the insert in the fridge overnight, and just put it in the base and started it the next morning. It smelled delicious all day. My husband got to serve it to the family while I was at school. He LOVED it. I had some the next day - it was still fabulous! I used cubed sirloin, and the meat was amazingly tender. We didn't feel the need to thicken it up, sopped up juices with dinner rolls. I'll make this again!

Very good with added celery but a bit bland. Overall --- the meat and veggies were tender and filling. Next I'll add more spices.

I did not think this was the BEST stew I've ever tasted.  It seemed to lack some flavor.  Next time I'd add some celery for sure and some other spices to jazz it up.

This is by far the best beef stew I have ever had.  The flavor was so good we all had seconds.  The only thing I did different was to add green beans to the mix.  Wonderful on a cold Texas night!!!

LOVE this stew! Even better the next day. I don't use baby carrots but sliced whole carrots. I use peeled cubed russet potatoes not red bliss like in the video. Also don't see need for flour at the end. My Mom made the best beef stew in the world and this tastes just like it!

Absolutely delicious.  My ninety year old Mom lives with me and I have a challenge daily getting her to eat.  She ate an entire serving of this stew. The only thing I did differently was being a little heavy handed with the wine. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Delicious! My family loved it. Just the way stew should be. The only change I made was I didn't add the flour at the end because I felt it was thick enough.

I really like this recipe!!!  Based on 4 servings, I added a bay leaf, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp rosemary, 3 oz. tomato paste (half a 6 oz. can) and no butter.  In place of the boullion, in a small bowl, I mixed 2/3 cup of water, 1tbsp plus 1tsp wine, 3 oz. tomato sauce and one Swanson's beef flavored Flavor Boost packet.  I poured this mixture over the items in the crockpot.  I added 1 cup of frozen organic peas at the end of cooking time. Fantastic!!!!!

OK starting point but needs more flavor.  More spices are needed and more flavorful vegetables.

Here's my recommendations:

Change meat from 3 lbs to 2 lbs

Change 3 large potatoes to 2 large white potatoes + 1 large sweet potato or yam

Change the cup of baby carrots to 3-4 carrots cut into large pieces (baby carrots DO NOT have the same depth of flavor)

Change the two cups boiling water to two cups beef broth

Add 1 small can of baby peas at the end of the cooking time while the gravy is thickening

Add the following seasonings:

2 Bay Leaves
2 TB Worcestershire Sauce
2 tsp Garlic Powder
1 tsp Paprika
2 tsp Salt

It's definitely a keeper with these changes.

LOVE this meal… A definite "Go To" in our house. The best recipe I've ever found on this site. As we are only a family of 2, the portion size lasts us through the majority of the week and it tastes great reheated.

It's been a long time since I've made beef stew and this was not quite how my mom used to make it, but it comes close enough for rock and roll.  I did not use the Onion Soup Mix as they all seem to contain MSG...so I substituted spices in place of the OSM and added a little Kitchen Bouquet.  I also added celery and I believe I cubed up some boneless spare rib meat that was on sale and it was more tender than a new born doe. Ok, maybe that was a bad reference.  More tender than a scallop in butter...better?

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish.  I did make a few alterations to suit our preferences.  I added half of a package of ranch dip mix to give it a bit more flavor.  I also added 3 stalks of celery and a seeded and halved habanero pepper to give it a bite;  I removed each half when the stew was finished.  We have culantro in our garden so we minced one leaf and added it to the last 20 minutes of cooking time (cilantro would also be good).  This gave the stew a whole new flavor and really brought it all together.  My slow cooker is powerful so I only cooked this on low for 5.5 hours and the meat and vegetables turned out tender and delicious without being soggy.  Although I did make alterations, I still give this recipe a 5 as it was a great base to work from before adding our personal touches.

This was really good. I added a few more potatoes and carrots because it didn't seem to be enough for the amount of beef.  I also added about a cup and half more water. I increased the Merlot to 3/4 cup. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I used cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  My hubby loved it!  Will make again. Oh and the prep time is more like 45 minutes minimum instead of the 15 listed.  But it's worth it! I ran out of time so I cooked it on high for about 3 hours and turned it down to low for about 2 hours.  The meat was very tender.  Served with a good crusty bread for dipping in the gravy. Thanks for sharing.

This is great.  I followed the original recipe pretty closely but added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the onions while sauteeing.  I also took the advice of some reviews by replacing the 1/4 C of water with more wine along with about a 1/4 teaspoon of Worcestershire Sauce to mix the addl. 2 Tbsp. of flour before the last 15 minutes of cooking time.  A big hit with the family including my picky little one.

OK--this is amended a week past my first.  The original recipe is great.  Today, I made it for the second time and it proved not to be a fluke that it was good.  New batch of stew meat and it was just as tender, moist and tasty as last time.  This time, I added some dried puccini and portabella mushrooms.  Oh, my husband likes peas so we added them too!  It just gets more fabulous!  
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe soooo much!

My wife and I knew we where going to have a long day coming up, so I was looking for a slow cooker meal. My wife really loves carrots, so I put in a full pound. I love the potatoes, so I added extras. We both love the liquids, so I doubled the water and dry soup mix. I did not have red wine on hand , so I skipped that step. I completed steps one through three the night before and place everything in the refrigerator. The next morning I placed the slow cooker on the counter set at low heat. Thirteen hours later I completed the last two tasks of step four. This was awesomely delicious. The stew meat nearly melted in your mouth. The potatoes and carrots were perfectly tender and flavorful. We will definitely make this again and again.

I cut the meat down to 2lbs, and thought the ratio was good.  I recommend seasoning the meat before flour to ensure balance.  I use a salt/pepper/garlic powder blend (Paula Dean house seasoning).  I did use a can beef broth instead of water to mix with onion soup.  Deglazing is kind of a wasted step when you use non-stick pans (I know, "THE HUMANITY").  I still did it because I wanted the wine.  3 onions seem excessive to me, so I used 1 really big one.  You can really eyeball potatoes and carrots to get the perfect mix that works for you.  I was a little surprised that no one expressed concern that there wasn't enough liquid when you firt put everything in.  Don't worry, just step away from the pot and it will take care of itself.  I don't know why anyone would need to thicken this stew up.  If you have enough potatoes (we're potato people), the starch from the potatoes breaking down should thicken this up very nicely.  I even added 1/4 of wine toward the end to thin, and to give it that extra kick of flavor.  This really isn't as much of a change as it looks.

Oh My! This was delish!!! 
I made a few very small changes though.  I added maybe a just the smallest splash more of wine than said, okay okay, I used a half of a cup  :).... I used a whole bag of baby carrots and used baby red potatoes, quartered instead of 4 large russets.  I also added about a teaspoon of minced garlic.  I used a can of beef broth mixed with the onion soup, which measured to about a cup and a half and used water to get the required 2 cups.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours, never did the high part nor the addition of flour at the end because it was thick enough.  In the last 30 minutes I added about 2 cups of frozen green peas because I just like peas in my stew. :)  
My guests said that it was probably some of the best beef stew that they have ever eaten.  Sounds about right to me!  Yummay!

I cut this recipe in half to make for my family of 4 - although the recipe was scaled to 6 servings, it served a scant 4. Although the end result was fairly tasty, I didn't find all the preamble made much of a difference in the end. Next time, I will simply throw everything in the slow cooker and walk away.

REALLY great recipe ... I tried to make it a bit easier on myself by browning the meat the day before and putting it in the frig overnight; also peeled and chopped the potatoes and put them in a gallon ziplock baggie, covered in water with a tsp of lemon juice added, in the frig overnight (the lemon juice keeps the potatoes from turning brown; be sure to drain and rinse well before putting into the stew). Then in the morning I sauteed my onion (used only one, large, onion) and added all ingredients together into the crockpot. Took another reviewers' suggestion of using wine in place of the water, combined with the flour at the end to thicken.  My son ate his with a fork it was so thick! Simply delicious, and worth the time!!!

It took more effort than I expected but it was worth it.  My husband and I both loved it.  I did leave out an onion and ended up adding a little more water at the beginning.

This is a fairly easy stew to make, but a very delicious one as well. I would suggest adding an extra cup of carrots since they tasted so good. :)

This was the perfect meal to eat after coming home from a snowy afternoon in the woods. I made this stew with elk meat and added garlic and worshestershire. It was absolutely amazing and the elk meat melted in my mouth. I will make this again and again!!

This is hands-down my favorite slow cooker meal.  It's delicious!  I use Marsala wine.  I turn it into beef stroganoff the next night using sour cream and serve over egg noodles.

WOW!  This stew turned out amazing!  So flavorful, and the meat just fell apart!  Adding the flour and water at the end as stated in the recipe gave it just the right thickness for us.  Let me caution other cooking novices like myself.  The preparation time of 15 minutes is assuming your meat/potatoes are already cubed, onions already sliced, etc.  I didn't have any of that done ahead of time (I did have to cube my meat myself and chop fresh parsley) and prep took nearly an hour.  I do wonder what the result would be if I just threw all the ingredients into the crock without the extra prep....but most other reviewers agree that the extra prep is what makes the difference in this recipe.  It is DELISH!

This was decent! Hubby and the kids enjoyed it, even my picky 6 year old. Easy  to do. Will probably add either broth or more water though as even with the meat juices, it lacked enough liquid.

I made this but I added to it.  I added tomatoes, celery, fewer potatoes and I added lots of fresh parsley and thyme.  I added extra wine to the stock and instead of using water I used beef stock.  It turned out absolutely delicious.  I love it.

I hate when I read a review and the writer states the many changes that were made. However, I made a couple of changes myself. I used beef broth instead of water and added mushrooms. This stew if very yummy. I agree with another reviewer, it should be called Beef Pot Roast Stew. I love the flavors and will make this again with a few more changes. I'd at least double the wine (I use Burgandy for full flavor) and add another 1/2 can of broth. I'd also chop the carrots into smaller pieces. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it needed the broth versus the water. It would have been too bland without it. While this is a great recipe that I'll make again, it still isn't what I am looking for in a beef stew.

Made this mostly as stated. I did replace water with low sodium beef broth and used red potatoes. I did feel that this way much more prep work than what my normal idea of a crockpot recipe is... but it was fairly worth it. Will be making again.

My husband lovedddd it. Exactly followed.  The "extra" prep work is well worth it. Tried another recipe that didn't have the little extra prep and he didn't like the taste at all. Sub'd beef broth for the water. Perfect!

Yummmm! As a few other reviewers suggested used beef stock instead of water, gave the flavour an extra kick. Used regular carrots cubed as that was what I had, added frozen peas about 1hr before serving. Also did mashed potato instead of adding it in, just 'cos I love anything like this over mash.  Found I didn't need to thicken the sauce and oh boy did it smell good! Will absolutely make this again!!

I made it too salty and added a prepackaged stew seasoning packet from the store...it's a five star recipe, but i probably did a 3 star job on it on account of that packet.  I added edamame for color and a ton of minced garlic and used low sodium beef broth instead of water which I think were good decisions. I used yukon gold potatoes, which added some creamy sweetness to it, but I think russets would have been just fine.

My husband loved this meal.  I actually thought it was a little bland-- will probably add more spices next time.  I cooked it for 4 1/2 hours on high in the slow cooker and it worked out fine.

Simply delicious. I am not a fan of stew but this was just that good. The only thing I did differently is that I added celery, because I love celery! Next time I am making a bigger pot; this only lasted for one meal in our house!

We did not like this.  Had to add more soup mix due to lack of flavor.  It didn't help that I bought grass fed organic beef which has less fat, making it more tough but we didn't like the flavor of the sauce so I'll be moving on.

This was the best stew I every had.  I updated the receipe to make only 6 servings to fit in my crockpot plus it was only for me.  I still cooked it for 6 hours which may have been too long, but I liked the way it came out.  The meat just fell apart but so did the potatoes.  I liked it that way but reazlied now I probably could of cut down on the cooking time.  This was my 2nd attempt at the slow cooker :) But it tasted soooooo good.  I will def make again.

Best beef stew I have ever had/made!  It was snowing and VERY cold in Kansas City this weekend, so this was the perfect thing to make!  I changed a few things, which only made this recipe sooooo much better.  I used almost 4 lbs of meat, which I marinated in red wine and garlic overnight.  In the morning, I threw it all together.  I used beef broth instead of water and I sauteed a whole bunch of mushrooms with my onions.  I did not have the need to deglaze the skillet.  Once everything was in the crock pot, I added an entire can of tomato paste.  After the 6 or so hours, I added frozen peas and two envelopes of dry brown gravy mix.  It could NOT have been more perfect!  This is now THE recipe for beef stew; I will be making this again and again.

not too high on the flavor scale. added some frozen peas, chopped celery, and garlic (2 cloves). i've tried stews in the past that had some tomato product in it, which gave it a little more kick.

I didn't have red wine so I used white and added some red wine vinegar.  I also added some celery. I think that at then ended the stew could have used some pease just to add color.  The flavor was good and everyone raved about it!

Great recipe.  I added 2-3 pressed garlic cloves and half the onion when browning the meat.  I also increased the carrots and potatoes a bit.  I used a cheap sweet wine (Boonesfarm Sangria) and it was great!!   You can convert this to a stove recipe in a dutch oven for 1.5 to 1.75 hours if you are short on time,   Serve with french bread - yumm!   Easily could use this recipe with vension or bear meat for the hunters!!   Thanks for the recipe!!

I used this recipe as a guide and made many alterations. Instead of carrots I used orange and yellow peppers. I also added canned beans, broccoli and wilted spinach. I used veg. ground round instead of beef. I also added vegetable stock, 1 small can of tomato paste and garlic. The red wine was a wonderful touch...I used 1 cup red wine and 1/2 cup boiling water. These recipes are great since you can add anything and rarely fail! It was delicious!!

Yummy! I only changed a few things to make it work for me. I cut the recipe in half and used beef broth instead of water. I also cut the onions down and used more veggies, like celery, zucchini, and sweet potato. I don't drink so I didn't add wine but the flavour was still so good!

I prepared the recipe omitting the parsley and adding about a cup of celery.  It was just perfect! Great comfort food on a cold winter day.  As a note, I used Green Giant Klondike Petite Yukon potatoes.  If you can find them at your local store, get them - they have a wonderful flavor!!!!

This was one delicious beef stew ! The meat was really tender. I was so glad that my 6 year old daughter loved it and asked some of left over for lunch the very next day! Reading the reviews was very helpful:) I used Lipton beefy onion soup mix instead of onion soup mix.

I sort of followed your recipe, and sort of one from Pioneer Woman and wow, it turns out I can make stew after all. Thanks for sharing! I used tenderizer on the meat and browned it. Added mushrooms shallots, garlic, 1 bay leaf, and 2 sprigs of thyme. About 1 T worcestershire sauce. No onions, no parsley, no red wine, no onion soup mix. Ended up mixing the flour with hot stew broth, then mixed it into the crock pot. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I followed the directions & found this to be pretty flavorless.  Friends came over and added garlic more onion, worchester sauce, wasabi, wine and salt.  Then it just lacked color so we threw in some frozen corn.  If I had had any I would have added peas and beans, too.

This was absolutely fabulous and so easy. I did what one person had suggested and added the flour into wine (instead of water) at the final stage. I also added a clove of garlic because we love it at our house. I think this may have replaced the complicated and time-consuming process of making Bouef Bourguinon for me.

I was a bit skeptical after numerous people said that this was bland, but I decided to try it anyway based on all of the positive responses. This was simply a good base recipe but it needed so much more flavoring. The meat was incredibly tender, but there was barely any taste at all. Bland is actually an understatement-sorry. Fortunately, I was not on any timetable to serve this, so I had plenty of time to doctor it up and give it some flavor. It needed alot! Three stars for the base recipe on which to expand and create your own tasty dish.

Marinated the meat in wine, worcheshire sauce, and some spices like some of the other reviews said. This was quite possibly the best beef stew I have ever tasted. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good.  I would cook a little longer and cut the potatoes and carrots smaller.  They were both done, but a little harder than I like.  My kids loved this meal also, and they are very picky

This is great!!  I changed it a bit and made some more, I didn't use olive oil or the red wine. But everything else was the same and it was great. The whole family loved it and it was perfect for a cold winters night.  So easy this was my first time making stew and no problems whatsoever...

I made this recipe for the second time but I added 1 can of tomato paste because some reviewers suggested. This added a nice flavor but next time I will only add half a tiny can. I also added 1 tsp of cornstarch instead of the final flour/water mixture and the consistency was perfect. Very very delicious.

I scaled this down to serve 4 (we're a family of 2 + toddler) and it was not enough!  Next time I will half the recipe. I also used beef broth instead of water.  Served with fresh french bread and it was excellent. Will definitely make again. Great winter stew recipe.

This recipe is incredible!  I'm glad I took time to read through the reviews.  In the end, I added some extra seasoning in the flour mixture, extra garlic, and beef stock instead of water.  The deglazing is really what makes the flavour in this recipe.  I cooked it on high for five hours and it was falling apart and so tender.  Awesome!  I didn't need to thicken the recipe at the end either; it turned out just fine!

I'm always on the hunt for a good stew. This one far exceeds any other that I have tried. I am officially not looking anymore. There were only 3 of us for this meal so I thought I would freeze and save or take it for lunch. After all, the recipe states that it serves 12. Too bad, there were no leftovers.

Tasty.  Made a few changes, as I always do.  Use 2 lbs of meat instead of 3, 3/4 cup merlot instead of a 1/4 c), added 1 packet Montreal Steak seasoning some to the the flour and the rest to the stew itself (if you add this.. you can eliminate the pepper).  I also added a few shots of worcestershire sauce and 2 bay leaves.  Oh, I also only used the powder from the onion soup mix not the dried onions (use the beefy onion soup mix, gives it a little extra beef flavor). Threw it in crock pot for 8 hours, yummy!!!  Thanks Rosie!!!

Made this today and it was wonderful. Now I am not the best cook and only have a few good things I do cook, however my hubby says it's the best beef stew I cooked yet...I took out the sauted onion part and added celery...it still tasted awesome. The meat was still moist and the veggies weren't too soft. The cook time was perfect, not too too long. We gobbled it up with some fresh bread (and then took the photo of the leftovers)...yum yum.

This was outstanding.  I didn't use the extra onions and deglazed my pan with water since I don't ever have alcohol in my home.  Timing was very good.  Ours was done about a half hour earlier.  We thickened with the flour and water then used bread to sop up the gravy.  I added corn, and frozen green beans an hour before it was due to be done.  We like veggies.  Yum.  We will use this recipe alot.  Thanks.

Wow, this was a tasty and easy beef stew.  It's a little labor intensive first thing, but the result is so flavorful.  My kids loved it, and I've tried a TON of crock-pot stew recipes.  By far the best...I followed recipe exactly as written.

I just made this for the first time. I did not have wine, but I improvised with 50/50 Southern Comfort and boiling water (I would not go out of my way for this, but it was in the house and no one was drinking it) and added 3 stalks of celery, because, well, I'm Irish and love celery in stew. Don't add more liquid if you think there is not enough, just stir it up a bit. Juices will come out of the fats in the beef in time. Cooked on high 45 min and low 4.5 hours, could have gone a little longer to reduce the broth to a stewy consistency but I could not wait any longer! My house smells awesome and this filling stew will be made again!

trying to cut calories, i cut the meat in half and doubled the carrots, added 2 chopped tomatoes, cut the butter, and probably used about 1/2 cup wine. you can add/subtract anything really, this recipe is foolproof!

I loved the recipe and my husband was even impressed with the way it turned out. It was thick enough I didn't add the flour to thicken it. Next time I will add more carrots outside of that no changes.

This is a favorite at my house, and it makes excellent leftovers. I add worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, a bay leaf, and a teensy bit of liquid smoke when I'm cooking it (as well as extra carrots). I also mix horseradish sauce in with individual servings (to taste).

REALLY good.  I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  I had made it with yellow onions and added a little more wine.  It came out a little on the sweet side.  Next time - and there will be a next time - I will use white onions and some garlic powder.

I made this last night and it was wonderful! My house smelled sooo freaking good. I did omit the parsley and subsituted 1 cup of the water for low sodium beef broth. I served it with some warm french bread. Will make again. Thanks!

I added 1/2 cup of red wine, and a little more flour as suggested. Used 2-3 cloves of garlic. Also added rosemary and thyme and some cayenne, used red purple and yellow potatoes, added mushrooms and frozen peas towards the end, and it was pretty good, though I think it could be better, just not sure how. Still, I would do this one again for sure.

This was my first attempt at beef stew and it was fabulous!  I followed the recipe closely, just a few changes.  I used a very lean beef, but it's a crockpot so it was still tender; I didn't thicken the broth at the end--the stew was hearty enough as it was so I avoided the extra calories.  Oh and I eyeballed the wine and think I added a little more than I should, but it still turned out great.  Next time I think I'm going to try a half recipe (this was too much for just me and hubby) and try to parse down the fats to the bare min.  Overall, great!

This was maybe the best stew I've had.  My whole family loved it.  I'm going to add mushrooms next time though.  This was also very easy to make.

Great recipe, I made just a few changes, I sauted fresh garlic with the onions, used only 2 onions, I replaced the onion soup mix with a package of beef stew mix.  I used Merlot for the wine and added an extra half cup or so.  Also replaced the water with beef broth.  I cooked on high for the 30 minutes and then low for about 8 hours before I added the flour and water to thicken. Oh and I also added mushrooms and a can of corn to the stew mixture.  My husband raved about it.  By the way this is the first time I have ever made beef stew, mostly because I don't care for it, but he absolutely LOVED IT.  Great recipe, thanks for all the reviews, they are great to get ideas from.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using fresh parsley in place of dry parsley. It smelled wonderful while cooking and the taste is out of this world. I have always had a hard time making beef stew that had a good taste and look. Perhaps my crockpot cooked it quicker but I started at 10am this morning and it is already done!! Cant wait for dinnertime!! Just need some biscuits to go with!!

Yummy! I added 4 cloves of garlic to the sauteeing onions. I also used beef stock in place of water and added a cube of tomato/chicken boullion. Needed some seasoning toward the end with kosher salt and garlic powder so be sure to check seasoning at the last hour mark. Otherwise, the sauce is great!

Excellent favor and very comforting. I followed the recipe exactly except I couldn't be around to adjust my crockpot, so I left it on low for 8 hours. When I came home, my place was filled with STRONG strew smell. The beef was overcook for that reason. I put it in the fridge, take out the layer of fat and heat it on stove the next night, it was so good!!! As one reviewer suggested, I also made fluffy biscuits to go with the strew and they are great together. Hubby and I thought this is a bit heavy for warm days, but will make it again in winter! THANK YOU!

This is a great, standard slow cooker stew. I like it better than my wife's grandmother's recipe, which says a lot. Would definitely make this again (and we will).

This was very good.  I added one sweet potato to the mix because it needed to be used up.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic.  I used 3 beef boullion cubes and added one extra cup of water.  I omited the warm water and the flour at the end of the recipe and used instant potato flakes.  My husband said it was great and my 3 year old ate his right up.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I made this stew (with a few minor modifications), and it turned out soooo very good!  It's a keeper for our family!  I changed it to Serve 6, so we could have leftovers another day.  To this recipe I added salt and pepper to the flour to coat the meat, and a red pepper and two celery stalks and two minced garlic cloves to the vegetables, and about 2/3 cup of ketchup and two bay leaves before I set it to cook.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and while it was pretty good (and not as time consuming as some reviews suggest), I didn't find it to be very stew-like.  It was really thick and more like eating roast beef with vegetables.  This may be a function of slow cooker size or how much liquid evaporates from your cooker, but is something to consider if you know your slow cooker is prone to losing liquid.

This is fantastic.  I followed everything exactly but at the end I added some salt, garlic salt and Beef Seasoning.  That gave it an even nicer flavor.  I think next time I will cut back on the meat and maybe use only 2 pounds, and add in more carrots and maybe other onion.  I want to try putting in some celery too. All in all a fantastic recipe - this will now be my go-to Beef Stew recipe.

Fantastic!  Even my father in law, who claims he has a "Delicate Stomach" (AKA: Fear Of Trying New Things) gobbled this up with a fervor previously unseen.   Additions: A touch more red wine, basil, garlic, Penzey's Black & Red (black pepper & cayenne), celery, and corn.

I didn't use the flour at all, or potatoes, and only 1/2 the onion mix.  Added about 1/2 pound of small white mushrooms.  Just delicious, and made a great soup later in the week, just added some beef broth and peas.

I make it a policy to try a recipe 3 times before giving up. Unfortunately, I am giving up on this one. Not sure what I am doing wrong, but I feel like the other reviewers and I are eating different meals. My family of 5 has to pour A-1 in the stew to get it down. Even reducing the flour, it still taste more pasty than anything. Even a list ditch effort (3rd try) of using a better quality meat didn't work. Hope others have better luck.

Very good.  I think next time I will definitely use the beef broth instead of water.  Needed a little more taste.

I "christened" my new slow cooker this weekend using this recipe.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I also added a few other vegetables and used fresh parsley. I also used a cross-rib roast, and cut it up into smaller pieces.  It was so tender - it melted in our mouths! My husband really enjoyed this recipe and it will definitely be on our slow cooker meal rotation. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made several changes for this recipe.  I didn't include 2 cups of boiling water or dry onion soup mix.  Neither did I use 1/4 cup of warm water.  I subsituted 8 small Yukon Gold potatoes for 4 large cubed potatoes.  I added, thyme, crushed red pepper, 28 oz. beef broth, salt, basil (dried), 2 bay leaves, 1 1/2 cups Merlot wine, 5 crushed garlic cloves and 2 celery ribs and worchestershire sauce.  I also used 2 lbs ox-tail instead of 3 lbs of beef stew meat.
I failed to use the drippings from browning the ox-tails in a skillet.  I also didn't thicken the stew with flour.  What resulted was a flavorful ox-tail stew with a tad bit of spicyness.  A thoroughly delicious stew and not bland whatsoever !!

I'm 62 years old and have been making beef stew for about 40 years.  This is the most fantastic recipe I've ever made.  Throwing out all my other recipes.  I did change just a few things.  I did use the Merlot for the red wine as another review advised.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp basil, a bayleaf, about 1 Tbl of dried garlic and 1 Tbl of Kitchen Bouquet at the end.  Delicious!!!!

I was a little nervous about the stew being bland, so I followed some of the other reviewers' advice. I used beef broth instead of water, and added some thyme, more salt and a bay leaf.  Everyone loved it! The texture was perfect...thick rather than soupy.  Next time I'd add more carrots and some peas, but there will be a next time.

This stew is great, but a little heavy on the beef. Next time I will add less beef and maybe more beef broth as others had suggested.

I thought that this recipe for beef stew was ok...I didn't think that it deserved the 5 stars that so many reviewers voted. I only used 2 pounds of beef stew meat and the consistancy was good. I think that the stew was too spicy and called for too much black pepper and onions. The package of dry onion soup mix is adequate enough without adding more onions. If I did make it again, I would substitute the red wine and water with beef broth.

It was good, but I agree with other reviewers that by itself it was a bit bland. I was hoping the red wine and onion soup mix would add something extra, but it was more of a typical beef stew. Like many soups and stews, I found it was better the second day- seemed like all the flavors really blended together by then. I think I'll make again but use beef broth instead of water and maybe some extra onion soup mix, red wine and spices. Thanks!

Delicious stew!! Added beef boullion, worcestershire sauce and more carrots.  Make sure to add the salt and pepper, it makes a big difference!  Not necessary to add the flour to thicken at the end unless you want really thick soup.  The first time I didn't alter the recipe at all and was great but with the adjustments I have made I think it is delicious! (to my taste). I cooked it on high for 2 hours and then low for 2 hours and it came out great.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks.

Loved this recipe!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and added a bay leaf and upped the amount of veggies... more potatoes and a 1 lb bag of fresh (not frozen) baby-cut carrots.  I only had white wine and beefy onion soup on hand so that's what I used.  I would say even with the addition of extra veggies it's still more like 10 servings not 12.  A great winter meal to come home and warm up to, especially paired up with my breadmaker.

Love this recipe but I suggest using less meat or more veggies, unless you like a real meaty stew.  I use double the veggies!

This is the best stew I've ever had!  I add extra red wine, for extra flavour.  I also add extra carrots - I quadruple the carrot amount from the recipe.

I thought this had a GREAT taste - the broth was really yummy.  I did add garlic powder to the flour when shaking it up with the meat as we are a garlic household.  I think next time I will add some celery.  I used all three onions and didn't regret it one bit!  Thanks!

As for taste.... easily five stars. But... the veggies were really overcooked and mushy.  I made the stew as close to the recipe as possible however next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add the veggies in about an hour or so before it's done, and hopefully the vegetables won't be so overcooked... This recipe makes the best tasting and tenderest stew I've ever made.

MMMMmm!!! This is the best!I shook the beef in a bag with flour, but added tons of garlic salt, pepper, and some rosemary. I didn't use the onion soup mix. I used beef boullion, the dry paste stuff in a jar. I ADDED MARSALA WINE,  to the meat after I browned it up, and then stired it around for a few minutes. I added water, worshestishire, celery, and 2 bay leaves, NO tomatoes, or peas, but ADDED FRESH MUSHROOMS! Cooked ON THE STOVE!!! OUTSTANDING! 2 THUMBS UP!

This turned out great and was simple to prepare!  Stew was very flavorful.  I used beef broth instead of water and added diced tomatoes, as suggested by others.  I would also recommend cutting down on the meat and adding more potatoes and other vegetables. When I made it I used the whole 3 lbs of meat, more carrots than called for and a couple more potatoes, and the stew ended up with way more meat than anything else, but still very tasty.

This was pretty good.  I did make a few changes though. I used beef broth in place of the water and added about 3/4 cup wine (didn't measure).  I also threw in some minced garlic and some rosemary, and skipped the sauteed onions.  I used a mixture of ribeyes and sirloin for the meat (I accidentally left the freezer door open when I left for work. . .I had some steaks to use up in a hurry)!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great.  i made a few changes to it.  Instead of using the hot water and dry soup mix I used a can of french onion soup and a can of beef broth.  I also added frozen peas and a beef boullion cube to it.  At the end instead of mixing the flour with water I took some of the juice out of the crock pot and mixed that with the flour.  Came out awesome.

I'm a college student and my roommates and I loved it!  I cut the meat to about 2 lbs. and added a few cubed Russet potatoes.  I also only used 1 1/2 onions and doubled the amount of carrots.  I didn't have dried parsley, but it didn't matter.  We were eating leftovers of this for a week!

I first made this recipe many years ago.  We live in Florida so we don't have many cold days to enjoy stew, but I make this every year and it is truly the best stew recipe I have EVER had.  The temp is about to drop and my husband asked me to make this again this week.  I add mushrooms, but that is the only thing I change.  It's perfection as is!

Freaking bomb. Made several times. The only thing I changed was adding thyme, rosemary and sage.  That's the secret.

I substituted water with beef broth and added some extra spices. It was great. Wife said it's best she's ever had.

Added a can of mushroom soup, and peas, thickened with corn starch instead of flour, 10 min before serving.

Not a fan of too much onion. Used my gluten free mushroom soup for some of the liquid, added beef broth and tsp. of Worcestershire. Next time I'll try a tblsp.

I have made beef stew both ways, Browning the meat or not Browning the meat. I far prefer this recipe and it was worth the extra steps as other people have commented. Truly delicious and melt-in-the-mouth. I did use a lot more vegetables then called for because that's how I like it :-)

Great recipe!   We really enjoyed this stew. I didn't sauté the onions but just put them in raw with the rest of the vegetables. I coated the beef chunks in flour mixture of flour, ground rosemary, black pepper ground and then browned the outside of the pieces in oil. I will be making this again!

I’ve been making this recipe since I found it on here 5 years ago. 5 winters I’ve made it, and 5 times I’ve had guests over who rave about it. It’s so delicious! And don’t be afraid to add more red wine than listed :)

Made this almost just as directed and it was a huge hit. I subbed beef bouillon and garlic salt and minced onion for the French onion soup mix (I'm not opposed, just didn't have it) and it turned out great. I confess usually I don't pre-brown the meat or pre-cook the onions (seems contrary to the slow cooker game!) but this really made the dish a lot better I think.

i made this last night for dinner while watching the superbowl with a handful of friends. everyone loved it! i'm going to try it again soon. yesterday i didn't have any red wine so ended up using a white. also i still had some stew left but not enough for two people, so i dumped a box of chicken stock, and 2 cups of brown rice. let it stew a few hours on low until the rice was cooked. tastes really good and extended the meal!

next time, i'll add some worchestershire and either garlic powder or crushed garlic. i might blend some crushed red peppers to give it a bit of a kick as well. canned tomatoes, celery and mushrooms might be add-ons too. 

this recipe seems pretty versatile. definitely worth playing with it until we find the perfect combo for my family

Have made this a few times and it always comes out great. Make a few modifications, per others' suggestions: use combo of beef stock, water and red wine, add celery etc. Thanks to OP and other reviewers!

It's okay, but it's more like pot roast with lots of gravy than stew.    I won't be making it again.

Lovely dinner for a cold winter evening. Easy to prep in the morning, and wonderful to come home to. The meat was nice and tender (I think the browning made that happen). I used the Yukon potatoes I had on hand, which worked out well. I added a few more carrots than called for, and I didn't end up needing a thickener at the end, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I was worried that it would be too onion-y, but it all really cooked down and the onion didn't overwhelm in the least.

This is great stew. It has become a winter weather staple at home. Suggest marinating the beef in a good sweet red wine with a little cider vinegar or worcestershire. Use the marinade as the wine in the recipe but double the amount and you've got a great stew. goes great with biscuits

This recipe is DELICIOUS! Thank you IAMROSIE for posting it! I have tried several other beef stew recipes from this website, and this is by far my favorite. While other stew recipes can be bland, this one has excellent flavor. For the dry onion soup mix I used this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Dry-Onion-Soup-Mix/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=dry%20onion%20soup&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page&soid=sr_results_p1i1.

I was hesitant to use three onions in the recipe, since it already calls for dry onion soup mix, but three is definitely the right amount. Additionally, I added the flour 20 minutes before serving in order to get the right consistency.

I would not change anything about this recipe, it is perfect. My girlfriend loves this recipe, too, and she doesn't normally eat meat. This is a restaurant quality beef stew, or better.

This recipe was super delicious!! I cut the recipe in half because I only had about 1 pound of stew meat. I followed the directions exactly except I did not add any flour/water at the end and it came out perfect. Meat was very tender and melt-in-your mouth delicious and I'm usually not a fan of beef stews! Husband approved as well and went back for seconds. Will definitely make this again!

The recipe was good but it needs a few changes (in my opinion).  Use 1/2 cup of wine instead of 1/4 cup.  Use 1.5-2x the amount of carrots and potatoes.  Otherwise, it was excellent.

Very good.  I need to figure out how to make it a bit thicker in the pot but my daughter said she preferred it that way.  I would also like to try this again and add some peas to the recipe.  The taste is amazing and it smelled great in the house all day.

This beef stew is wonderful. I decided to try it after reading the reviews. I was not thrilled with some of the steps but trusted other reviewers who said it was worth the trouble. I do agree..it is worth the trouble. I am not a wine drinker so I had to use red cooking wine. My husband thought it was delicious. We ate it with baked apples and green beans the first time, but ate the leftovers by itself out of a big soup bowl. It will be the only beef stew recipe I will use from now on.

This is the best stew I have ever made.  I followed all of the directions with the exception of using less meat (I only had one pound), but I kept all of the other proportions the same (except I used one onion instead of three and decreased the butter to go with it) and it still turned out fantastic.  I also used wine at the end to mix with the flour instead of water.  VERY good!  My husband was happy and noticed right away that it was a different, more delicious recipe than usual.

I have made this many times and it is by far the best Beef Stew Recipe I have come across..I believe it is the wine that makes it special.
Even though I have played around with measurements, I have never strayed from the original ingredients.  Also, do not try to shortcut or skip steps....each step is an important contribution to the success of this recipe.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Followed the directions and meat was tough and it had no flavor. Sorry... maybe I'll try again but I think I'll stick with my mother's recipe.

My husband adores any type of stew. I left the potatoes out and added an onion and A TON of baby carrots. It turned out so well. I will be making again & again!

This was very good. I did not brown the meat 1st & I didn't add the red wine because I didn't have any. I added garlic powder & a little extra water & it was perfect!

This recipe is just like the recipe my mom used to make. Took me years to find just the right one to fill the void I was missing. Can't say enough about it. Great for those cool fall nights or anytime really. thanks for posting this recipe! Simple to prepare and with a little patience it will be worth it. I did alter it just a little by browning the meat in a rosemary/garlic in olive oil mix. I just scraped what was left over in crock pot but I did add the Merlot wine to the pot directly..helps the meat tenderize and give the gravy a subtle flare. And I added about 1/4 cup of brown gravy mix at the end..no onion soup mix. It is greatness!

I followed the recipe except I used 3 potatoes instead of 4, omitted the parsley, added bay leaf and 1/2 can of chicken broth.  Cooked in on high for 3 hours and low for 2, turned out fabulous.  The meat and potatoes and were tasty and tender without falling apart too much.  Definitely a keeper!

I had been looking for a good recipe for beef stew for a few years.  I found this recipe about three years ago and it did the trick!  By all means this has become the go to recipe for stew. In fact I make it and Freeze it in mason jars in individual sized portions to thaw for lunch or dinner as needed.  It's even better after it comes out of the freezer and the flavors all blend together. I love to give my kids healthy hot meals in the winter for school lunches, and this is perfect to thaw overnight and throw in their thermoses in the morning for their lunch.

Followed the recipe but also added some beef broth. It was so good, and since I doubled it, we had a lot left over. It was even better reheated in the crock pot. I did need to add a bit more broth since it had really thickened, but my husband and two boys have very hearty appetites. I will make this a regular dish at home. Served with biscuits and it was perfect!

This was pretty good. Very adaptable to what you like. I added peas, used regular carrots and red potatoes b/c that's what I had. I put a little too much vinegar in and had to add a cup more water but it was fine in the end after adding a bit of flour.

I really liked this stew. Great flavor, very rich and thick. I had to make a few changes, however. First, 3 pounds of meat was too much. Maybe the recipe used a much larger slow cooker than mine. I used about 2 pounds of meat. 

Also, it was a little too thick and not enough sauce. When it was almost ready, I actually removed at least a 1/3 of the ingredients (meat, potatoes, and carrots), leaving 2/3 of the recipe and the sauce in the slow cooker. I then added the 1/4 cup water and 2 tbs flour so the sauce could thicken. At that point, it was a nearly perfect stew. I added a bit more salt (to taste) and just a bit more red wine, let it sit for about 5 minutes and then served.

Everyone loved it!

As to the 1/3 of the ingredients that were removed from the recipe, after our dinner, I just put them all back in the slow cooker, which of course left very little of the sauce, but it was still a great lunch the next day.

This was an excellent stew!  My whole family loved it.  I cooked it for the most part of the day on low and the meat was super tender.  I did have to add some water a couple of times. We will definitely have this again!

I just finished making this stew and I followed the recipe exactly as written. I have a recipe that I always use for stew that is very good but I decided to try this recipe because it didn't seem to be as much work as my other recipe, all the 5* reviews this recipe received, and because I had an envelope of onion soup mix I wanted to get rid of. I can't put my finger on what it is about this stew that I don't like but I think it may be the onion soup mix. That is the only ingredient that isn't in my regular stew. The gravy seems as if it has too many different flavors happening and tastes a bit strange to me. I'm going to play with it a bit now with maybe some canned tomatoes and whatever else I can dig up in my pantry to try and soften the flavors but I found the recipe as written was just OK.

I am not sure how to rate this one. If you make it as the recipe calls for it, it's disgusting. Thank goodness for my experienced Mom who happened to be here when I made it. I wanted to throw it out but she suggested adding half a can of crushed tomatos, 1 tablespoon of extra hot chutney and 1 large cup of water. I did not add the water and flour in the end as the recipe called for and I let it cook in the slow cooker for an extra 2 hours. The result was excellent!

Great recipe. I used 1.5 pounds of stew meat and 2.5 cups of water with the onion soup mix. I added minced garlic when I cooked the onion as well. I also added celery. I cooked for a total of 7 hours and everyone loved it! Next time I may make some rice to go with it.

This was really good! Take note that you need a pretty large pot and about an hour prep time. I added about a cup of frozen peas and a little extra salt. Next time I would add some garlic. Otherwise, a great dish. Served it with fresh bread and butter and it was a hit!

I made this last week and it was a big hit. Next time, I might use less pepper, as the taste (I think coupled with the onion soup mix) was a bit overwhelming. The meat ended up being super tender and delicious. We were pushing aside the veggies and fighting over the yummy meat. I would also have less potatoes and more carrots, making the two more of an even mix. We tried heating up the left overs the next day to marginal success. It was so thick, that we had to make gravy to get back the original texture. This is a solid recipe though and pretty easy to make.

Excellent! Cubed a pot roast and it turned out great. Didn't have a cork screw, so no wine, but I want to try Merlot next time. Added celery, carrots, green beans, two large Russet potatoes. With all that, I had to use two cans of beef broth and a bit more water, and then about three tablespoons of cornstarch and some flour to get it to all thicken up. Delish!

This was great!!!!! The "extra steps" arent that bad at all...youre essentially using the same pot to cook everything before hand. No biggie! Just be aware it takes some time, if you were planning on cooking this in the AM before rushing out the door for work! 
Did everything exact, except added some worchestershire sauce....yum! A previous commenter noted anchovies give this a little extra kick, and worchestershire sauce does have anchovy....so try it out!

I made a few changes...I added a can of tomatoes and used a lightly toasted rue instead of the flour and water.   I think the addition of these two things made it more rich.   It was very easy and came out great!

I made this recipe pretty much as is with the excpetion of adding beef broth instead of the warm water and I added celery as it's just a preference.  This recipe was AWESOME!   This will defintiely replace by previous receipe as even my picky 6 year old and 2 year old twins gobbled this up! Thank you so much!

I just made this recipe tonight.  I was almost deterred by the additional prep work but I was home so thought...why not!!  OMG I am sooo happy I tried it.  This stew is really really good!!  A lot of others were telling about alterations they did to the recipe.  I am a big believer in trying things the way they are meant to be at leas the first time, so I did not change a thing and I am so glad I didn't!  This stew is fantastic just the way it is and the meat comes out very tender!  I will definitely be making this again.  It is a bit light on the veggies if you like that sort of thing but hearty none the less.  The taste is not too much and not too bland...I bet this makes a great leftover lunch too!!

Amazing.
Made this today for my family, and everyone 'LOVED' it. Absolutely perfect.
A few variables, due to availability of ingredients, but the end result was still great. 
Didn't have wine, parsley, or onion mix. instead I had some beef stock. Added celery and garlic. Only 1 onion rather than 3 (since some people here are extremely picky about onion.)
I thought it might still be too much onion, but picky-person was still impressed, since the onion taste was there (sweet taste) yet not overwhelming.

Thank you for the recipe, and making me look like a star chef! :D

This was so good! Don't skip a step.. it really did seem like a lot to go through, but it was worth it. I didn't have red wine on hand, so I looked up substitutions for it. The one that kept popping up was grape juice, so I gave that a try and it still tasted really good. I will make this again and again, for sure! Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe and I didn't have to tweak the seasonings like I typically do! I did everything in the crockpot (because I'm lazy like that) and loved how this came out. To start with, I put the beef in the crock pot and added about 3 TBS of flour directly to the pot and stirred it together with the meat, then threw in the remaining called for ingredients including the diced onion (skipped the butter and skipped browning the onions). I added hot water, not boiling and I didn't have red wine so I used beef broth instead. I used half white and half sweet potatoes and tossed in some leftover mushrooms I had as well. I set it on low and it was tender and delicious 8 hours later! This is a great crockpot beef stew recipe that I will gladly use again!

Made this tonight.. Cooked it all day for my husband. I, myself am not a fan of stew. But this recipe is delicious. Its easy and keeps your house smelling amazing all day. I added a few more spices such as Garlic and instead of baby carrots i use regular carrots. But it turned out amazing. I ate it all up and then went for seconds. Thank you for this amazing recipe. I also added a picture of the finished stew.

Tastes great! Added some garlic salt and mushrooms and actually cooked for an additional 45 mins, but it goes super well with fresh baked bread and butter! Definitely try it out!

I marinated the meat in chopped garlic and wine overnight. I also used chicken broth instead of water and added a 1/2 cup of sofrito and 1/2 cup of recaito to the dish. It turned out absolutely amazing!!! My hubby could not get enough!

This is the best beef stew I have ever eaten. I did use 2lbs. of beef and more carrots and potatoes. I did not have to add any flour or water at the end it was prefect. So yummy my whole family eat it even my picky teenager!

I've made this a few times and it's quite good.  My only issue is that when I halve the recipe for my tiny crockpot, I find that it's difficult to get the right amount of cooking time - it's wildly varied each time I've made it, so it needs a little more babysitting than most crockpot meals.  Other than that, it's delicious and filling.

I made this for a family gathering and even grandchildren raved about it. I did slice more onions and chopped more regular carrots and added a bag of frozen greenbeans. I used beef broth to make the flour and mixture with brown gravy mix to thicken the stew. Good eating raves and they finished a 7qt cooker

It was really good, I would definitely add more carrots next time, and possibly more flour/water to thicken it a bit more.

My husband loved this recipe!  My only change would be to leave out the salt in the flour mixture.  The soup mix has enough salt in it to flavor the entire stew.

This was excellent! My picky eaters gobbled this up. The few changes I made was I put in 1 onion instead of three, used a quality beef cut and used a beef stew seasoning packet instead of dry onion soup mix. I also only cooked it 30 min on high and 4 on low. It seemed to be enough!

Fantastic recipe. My husband does not like onions, so I substituted celery instead. It came out great, nice and hearty. My 7 month old son really enjoyed it pureed, as well! Thanks for a great recipe.

this recipe was super easy, even with all the prep work, it made the stew very flavorful. As some suggested I might use beef broth instead of water next time and I did throw in some garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce at the end. I did not have to add the flour at the end because the stew was already thick enough (i let it cook over night). Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!  I* added some celery and a package of McCormick Beef Stew seasoning but other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. I will definitely make this again!

I made it exactly as the recipe states. The only thing I changed was I added a cup of frozen peas at the end for colour and it tasted fantastic with fresh bread on the side!

I've made pot roast this way for years (just minus the water and wine).  It's delicious, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping the wine would add more flavor than it did. I also added some frozen peas at the very end of cooking. This defrosted the peas without making them mushy and gross.

Excellent beef stew that is very hearty and goes well with crusty French or sourdough bread.  I recommend using red cooking wine as the vinegar really helped tenderize the beef.

This was a great recipe,easy to make. We did marinate (for 2 hours) meat with olive oil, balsamic vinegar,red wine,garlic pepper seasoning mix. Cooked on high for the first hour then on low for 4 hours. The meat was so tender and delicious.

I made this stew this weekend and it was amazing! I only added 1 cup of frozen peas and next time I'd add more carrots! I've tried other beef stew crock pot recipes, and none compare to this one.  Definetely try this recipe! Awesome!

This was yummy, but we did not thicken it at the end, and we added mushrooms.  But I'm sure it was just as spectacular as written.

I made this and the beef was so dry, it was barely edible to me.  I think this was due to the amount of sodium in the soup mix, which draws out moisture.  Next time I will will add the soup mix 2 hours before it's finished cooking OR not at all as suggested by others.

Turned out well. Everyone ate it. It was simple enough to make but I agree with other reviewers that it needed more flavor. I added more seasoning at the end to taste.

This was okay; however, I would add some celery chunks with carrots and I would add alittle more beef flavor from let's say BV Upper.

I tweeked this a bit: added 1/2 tsp paprika, tsp of graymaster darkener, 1tsp of worcestshire sauce, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, tsp of dried thyme, tsp of basil. I used cabernet sauvignon for the wine.  I cut down on adding any salt as additions above have plenty. I also seared the beef (sirloin was so tender, I avoid stew beef, too tough) in garlic and red pepper. Cooked on high for 1.5 hrs, turned down to low for about an hour and then back to high. Took 6hrs to cook. I also added dumplings during the last 25 mins. Best stew I have ever made, but a bit salty. Used low sodium beef broth and two tsp of tomato paste as well.

This is a good basic beef stew recipe. I used beef broth instead of water and I even had to add extra broth later on because it had too much of a wine taste that I didnt care for. I also added minced garlic and used a package of beef stew slow cooker seasoning instead of onion soup mix(its what I had on hand). It turned out really yummy!!!

I'm really leaning toward 5 stars on this, but it's not OMG! good, and my husband rated it a 3.5 because he thinks it's missing something...  Anyway, this IS very good.  Simple, straight-forward comfort food.  The preparation did take almost an hour, though.  Used chuck roast cut into large cubes for the stew meat.  Doubled or tripled the veggies (large chop celery, carrots) - definitely a good change.  I used about a cup of Malbec and a can of beef broth in place of the water.  Did not sautee the onions.  Added a few cloves of minced garlic.  Cooked on high 4 hours.  Did not need to thicken in the end.  Overall very good; would definitely make again.  Next time, less (or a tamer) wine, maybe sautee the onions for flavor only, and add peas at the end.  Makes about 8 servings.

My family loved this dish, my husband usually shy away from slow cooker due to the lack of flavor but when he tryed this dish he really was surprise, I added couple more things to the ingredients: added chicken bouillon about 2 teaspoon another half teaspoon more of the black pepper, but next time I would add more carrots and 1 less potato (maybe the once I picked was larger than the intended recipe). But I would cook this dish again!

Since I found this recipe, it's been in a weekly to bi-weekly rotation.  My husband, who doesn't like cooked carrots - will eat this.  It's a very flavorful dish - just enough wine to add flavor but not over power stew.  I love it!!!

Very yummy!!  Even my "stew hating husband" ate three helpings!  The only thing I changed was to follow some other reviewers suggestion of using beef broth in place of the water.  And I threw in a few mushrooms!  Definitely a keeper!

This was the best beef stew I've ever made - & I have made many, with the crock pot and on the stove top or in the oven...this was so good I took some to friends for their dinner and they raved about it as well. I followed the recipe exactly and it was FABULOUS. I am going to make it again for a big family dinner this weekend and instead of adding potatoes in the stew, I am going to make mashed potatoes to accompany it.  I read quite a few other reviews and agree that its missing veggies. I am going to add a can of peas and a can of corn to the dish I make this weekend to hearty it up a bit.  Also, I didn't need to thicken the sauce, it was already very thick and that would've turned it into a paste. That was the only thing I did differently than the recipe.

After reading other reviews, I made a few adjustments.  Replaced water for beef stock & added a few cloves of garlic.  I eyeballed the wine & pretty sure I at least doubled what the recipe calls for.  My work schedule is a whole lot more than 6 hours, so I cooked on low for 10 hours instead.  Overall a good recipe, it's a keeper.

What a perfect meal to warm you up at the end of a cold day outside!  The house smelled fabulous!! I put it on low at noon and dinner was ready at 6.  The only change I made was that I added a little red wine to the onions while they were softening and I also added a small can of tomato paste which I think made it perfect!!

I just put this on and can't wait to try it.  It will be a perfect dinner for our busy Halloween.  Prep time was more like 45 minutes though.  I always hate to find out, too late,  that a meal takes much longer to put together than I expected.

Update:  So I made the stew and didn't care for it.  It had a weird flavor, and was way too thick.  The family thought it was okay.  The potatos were over cooked, but the carrotts were good, and the meat was very tender.

My husband and I made this last night. WE LOVED IT. The whole family, our teenage boy raved, "I could go to battle after eating this." Our daughter had 2 plates full. It was hearty, perfect for a fall night. Be careful, it did put everyone to sleep.

Making this recipe tonight.  Husband is working on putting it together as we speak.  Instead of potatoes, I'm putting Turnip and will be omitting the wine and flour.  I'll thicken it at the end with corn starch instead.  Instead of water we will be using the juices from the pan and Beef broth.  I'll let you know how it turned out.

Very delicious stew recipe! After reading reviews I didn't use the onion soup mix, just minced onion. I also used beef broth rather than water. It was way too salty though, so next time I will use half water half broth and NO salt. It was still had very good flavor though. I also didn't brown the meat before hand either. I just put it in the bottom of the crock pot and it cooked all day for about 8 hours while I was at work and the meat was perfect, very tender.

Not really sure what all the great reviews are for because this stew is a lttile bland.  I did substitue Beef Stock instaed of soup mix so thay may have had something to do with it, but there was something missing in the flavor department.  It did provide the house with a wonderful aroma that I enjoyed on a football Sunday.

Good recipe! I made a bunch of changes, but used this as a great starting point.   A few of the changes I made were: -Sauteed the onions in red wine -Added garlic -Added corn -Used beef stock, red wine and half a packet of onion soup -Cooked on HIGH for about 5 hrs.  I made a few other tweaks here and there and it turned out great!

Yum ! I made a few changes.. added sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes.. I also added a squirt of ketchup, and a squirt of worchester sauce. (dont know why, but i just did) and it turned out phenomenal. It DOES need the full cooking time.. so plan for that.. it won't be ready any sooner!! But so worth it!! The meat comes out so tender and full of flavor.. excellent recipe--

well I have to say I was skeptical, I have used many beef stew recipes over the years.  This was outstanding!  Probably the only change I would make next time is leave the salt out of the flour mixture. I think there is enough salt in the soup mix.  Maybe another cup of water, there was pratically no juice in it when I got home from work but that was ok,,the thicker the better and the meat just melted in the mouth.  Yum Yum!

I have been on this site a million times and never felt the need to comment until now.  This is the BEST stew EVER!  I don't even like stew, but I made this for my husband and we both finished it in 2 days.   I only used 1.5 lbs of meat so I added some mushrooms, peas and more carrots to make up for it and kept the liquid amounts the same.  I also added some worcester and garlic. I followed another poster's advice and used wine instead of water to make the flour paste at the end.   FANTASTIC!

The best beef stew just as is, only thing I did was double the recipe! I am not a big stew person and I loved it and so did the family. The smell in the kitchen all day and great meal in the evening was so satisifying.

I tweaked a bit and the family thought it was great: Cut/trim beef cubes-shake in bag with flour/salt. saute beef in olive oil; put beef in slow cooker then saute onions, red wine, progresso french onion soup; put cut potatoes, carrots and soup, etc. in slow cooker on high for 30 min - then low for 9 hours. 1/2 hour before, add mushrooms and stir.  when done-keep on warm and combine 12 oz sour cream with a 1/4 cup flour/cold water then pour in and stir.  Cook broad noodles, when done, add 1/2 stick butter. Serve stroganoff over buttered noodles.

Very easy. Added mushrooms which even my kids ate!! Will add more salt next time. Made this 4 years ago and couldn't stop eating the leftovers. For a family of 3 (me and 2 young boys) it was gone in a few days! Made it again yesterday and I barely have any left for my lunch today.

No flavor to it. my suggestion is add a beef bullion cube and replace water with beef broth. Also use a pound of baby carrots not a cup.

This is a great, mouth watering recipe and it's difficult to stop with one serving.  It filtered that wonderful cooking smell throughout the entire house and went well following an afternoon of snow shoveling, not that this wouldn't go well anytime of the day.

This recipe turned out great. I added some things to suit my family's taste. I used half of the onion soup mixture and added 4 cloves of chopped garlic, chopped mushrooms, a bay leaf and a can of crushed tomatoes. It was yummy!

Really good stew.  I used more potatoes because I like a thick stew.

One of my favorites! Very convenient and easy to make. Usually I add peas to make it even heartier.

Absolutely amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic!  My whole family loved this and I will never go back to making beef stew any other way.  The flavor of this stew is unique and very hearty.

My husband and I really enjoyed the stew.  Don't brown the meat too much or it will become tough.  I did not add the red wine as I am pregnant.  Next time I would add frozen corn and beans for more veggies.

My whole family loved this recipe! Even my picky 4 yr old ate most of hers. I changed a few things in this recipe, but not much. I didn't use the cilantro and used beef broth instead of the red wine and water, because I didn't have the wine on hand.

This was a real hit in my house!  My family isn't big on so much onion, so I did make a few tweaks for our tastes.  I cut back the chopped onion to only about half an onion.  When I sauteed the onion, I added a little extra butter, 3 cloves of minced garlic and 8 ounces of fresh sliced mushrooms, and simmered this all in the wine a bit before adding it to the crockpot.  As others mentioned, I also added an extra cup of carrots, and used 2 cups of wine and 1 cup of water with the onion soup mix - this gave me just the right amount of liquid.  My family devoured this with hot buttered rolls, and can't wait to take out the leftovers tonight!

Delicious delicious delicious!! I changed a couple of things -  I   used beef broth instead of onion soup as other reviewers said and I browned the onion in the olive oil that was left over from searing the meat - it was amazing!  This will be the only stew recipe I use!!

This was excellent. I made it for Super Bowl - everyone loved it. I had been craving beef stew - and yay for left overs... i suspect it will be even better today! I didnt have the wine so I used extra water, and i used corn starch instead of flour.Thanks so much - great comfort food! I cant wait to try it again with the wine. OM NOM NOM!

Great odors from this recipe but that is about all. Non of us could finish our first bowl. We did not care for the flavor of the wine. I will however try again without the wine.

So very good and easy.  I used a couple of red potatoes,a yam and a baking potato and it was delicious, no need for thickening. Of course, I added some garlic.  At the end of the cooking I added some frozen peas for color. The family loved it

It was definitely very hearty.  I was unable to find the stew meat at my local grocery store so I just got a 3 lb beef cut and put the whole thing in.  Toward the end I cut it up into smaller pieces but it was still great.  I think next time I will try a little harder to find the stew meat.  I also added some squash to the stew which was wonderful

What a great stew.  Best I've made.  And I didn't even have any wine on hand, but I'm sure that makes it even better.  I added a few diced tomatoes to the mix, a bit of garlic,and cooked it on high for about 5 hours to make the potatoes nice and tender.  It was a bit peppery for my two year old, but next time I'll just ease up on that (even though I loved it!).

Very good tasting stew. I did a few changes . I added some garlic powder and steak spices to the flour mixture. I also added fresh garlic to the onion mixture . Other then that it was a big Hit. It does have a lot of steps for a slow cooking recipe but it is worth the effort.

My family LOVES this recipe! THe twin 2 yr olds cleaned their bowl and the picky 10 yr old had thirds! :-) 
I changed it up a little as well by adding 2 largley cubed gala apples, 2 medium sized sweet potatoes, 1 packet of Sazon and extra red wine and wor. sauce. I served it with some honey butter cornbread! A great way to warm your family up on a cold Florida night (No, that't not an oxymoron! It gets in the low 30's here at night during fall!)

Yummy! seemed like too many onions for my style, so I only used one medium. The meat turned out so tender. Coating with flour and browning in a skillet was the key. I used beef boulian instead of water in the flour mixture at the end of cooking. It made an excellent gravy. Comfort food all the way!

A very good stew.  Very easy and delicious, maybe I thickened it too much at the end, but it did taste like pot roast soup, I would have liked it' to be a little less gravy-like.  But very good, I would even make it again.

I would say this is very delicious!!! I put some rosemary and thyme and used beef stew mix and more red wine as others suggested and they turned out to be great. There was no need for me to adjust the taste nor did I use flour to thicken because the gravy turned out to be perfect. This will definitely be in my recipe box. Thanks a lot!!!

This 5-star rating is based on the first time I made this recipe, following the recipe to the letter.
2nd time I made it, I had run out of red wine and onions, so I used white wine to de-glaze and also added a small can of mushrooms to the slow cooker.  And I added 3 beef bouillon cubes because I wanted a beefier gravy.  With all my changes, it's still worth 5 stars.
Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  The whole family loved it and there was none left.  I followed the recipe exactly and changed nothing.  This will be the only recipe I use for stew from now on.

I made this recipe last night and we absolutely loved it.  Like others suggested, I substituted 2 cups of beef broth for the water and onion soup mix.  I used baby Yukon Golds and baby red potatoes, and sauted Peruvian sweet onions with 2 chopped garlic cloves.  I added 3 whole cloves and a bay leaf for a little extra flavor.  My fiance wanted to eat the whole crock pot full.  Delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.

Loved the outcome, but I definitely needed to alter the recipe, there wasn't enough liquid in it! Also, a bit too much prep for my liking, especially it being a slow cooker recipe.

Wonderful! I have tried many slow cooker stew recipes and this is by far the best. I used a pound of stewing beef and followed all other directions exactly,except there was no need to thicken. I had a wonderful gravy at the end. Server with hot, crusty buttered rolls. Hubby at 2 bowl fulls. Will definately make again. Thank you

This was my first time using a slow cooker, and the first time I've ever made beef stew... it turned out wonderful, my husband loved it! I seasoned the beef with some garlic herb seasoning before browning it. Next time I'll probably add more veggies and maybe some garlic... delicious! Definetly will make again.

THis is a very good stew recipe. However, for 3 pounds of beef, which is a lot of meat, I added a lot more vegetables. I cut up 3 x-large carrots, 3 lbs of small, baby red potatoes, 3 large vidalia onions. I also added an extra cup of water, worsteshire sauce, tomato paste and thyme. I didn't use rosemary, but that would probably be a good addition also. There was so much, I couldn't use my slow cooker, so I put it in my large roasting pan (which holds at least a 20lb turkey) and cooked it in the oven at 300 degrees for 2 hours, and turned the heat down to 250 for 1 hour. I froze the leftovers and will have stew for quite a long time.

We love this recipe, and make it a lot in the fall and winter. I tend to add more carrots and potatoes than are called for, but we love veggies. Also, I use some crushed garlic, and substitute beef broth for the water. As for the wine, I always use a Cab and we drink the rest with dinner:) A staple.

Five stars, because it is easy and satisfying.  It's simple and "old fashioned," and in those things lies it's great appeal.  I used whole baby Yukons, and whole carrots, peeled and cut into hearty chunks. I didn't have an open bottle of Cab, so I used a Malbec.  I always season meat dishes with Jane's Crazy Mixed-Up Salt. Serve with a crusty bread, a green salad and a glass of that Malbec and you have a perfect Fall meal.

This turned out great, I folllowed the recipe to the T. The only things I changed was that I used fresh Parsley and 2 tblsp of fresh rosemary. I also used 3 cloves of garlic and substituted beef broth for the water. The red wine gave a great zest and kick. This stew awesome with fresh bread, went for seconds. Thank you for the recipe !!!

This is a real big hit with the family.  It seems like a lot of work but it is well worth it.  I added extra carrots and cut back on the onion (3 large seemed pretty overwelming) and used 2 cups of broth in place of the water.  I also did what one person suggested - mixed 1/4 cup of wine with flour to thicken the sauce.  There are NEVER any leftovers.

This was good. So may onions that there didn't seem to be enough meat or carrots though. Will add garlic next time, needed a little more flavor.

This recipe always goes over well at our house and with guests. Perfect for a cold winter day. Instead of dry soup packet I sub Slow Cooker Beef Stew mix. I don't bother measuring the veggies, I just fill up the crock pot. We serve it over brown rice or with crusty bread.

This was really good. I am making it for the second time right now, I did think it was a little thick, so I added more water this time around. I also added some fresh garlic and extra carrots. My husband loves it! Definitely a keeper!

Great hearty stew, just what I was craving for when the cool rainy nights returned. It wouldn't fit in my crock pot so I simmered it in a stock pot for about 6 hours. I added 2 cups cut beans, 3 cloves of minced garlic, worcestershire sauce, and about 1/4 cup catsup for the body and sweetening it offered. I ended up using about 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of water to deglaze the pan, then added water to the pot until it was about 1" over the contents. The idea of using a paste of warm wine and flour to thicken was great. Topped with dumplings. My family loved this.

Let me preface this by saying I grew up eating inedible beef stew (the meat was so tough, you literally couldn't chew it).  So, every time I attempt beef stew, I expect the worst.  This time, I got the best.  I had some beef sirloin in my freezer from "who knows when?" which I thawed and cut into very small pieces (I have a toddler who was going to eat this).  I also diced rather than cubed the potatoes.  The carrots were frozen cut carrots.  I cut the recipe in half because I have a smaller crockpot.  I *may* have forgotten to half the black pepper, but I don't think so - it was a little much - I liked it, but my son thought it was too spicy.  The beef was ridiculously tender, the potatoes and carrots were wonderfully soft, and though the sauce came out a little lumpy looking (from the original flour, I think because the flour at the end I made sure to stir like crazy before adding) and so it was an ugly stew, but who cares - it tasted GREAT.

YUM!  This was the best stew I ever made!  I used only 2 lbs of meat, and added some frozen corn and more salt at the end.  It definitely took more time to prep (about 30 minutes), but was worth almost being late to work for.

Just delicious! At first I was weary of the flavor, but that was my inexperience in good cooking. After cooking for 8 hours in the crock pot it was just like my Mom's -- my ultimate goal! I added celery and corn because I had them on hand. Also, instead of water and wine I used about 4 cups of water with 4 beef boullion cubes for flavor. Not an exact measure -- I just made sure everything was covered in broth and used 1 boullion cube per cup of water. This was great! The meat was SO tender.

Wow! Followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions. I took a 3 pound roast and cut it into cube beef bite sized pieces and I used regular carrots instead of baby carrots. My husband said that it must be good because he was looking forward to leftovers the next day! The next day it seemed to taste even better after the flavors had a chance to marinate. The roast was soooooo tender even after heating up in the microwave the following day. Thanks!

The Best!  My family and I really enjoyed the rich beefy flavor of this stew.  WE only had to add a wee bit of salt to it.  Perfect.

Just great. Quick to make - threw together at lunchtime, ready for dinner.

Forgot the onions and still was great. Gravy made terrific with a loaf of french bread - yummy.

I did a couple of the things that previous posters had suggested. I used beef broth instead of the water and the golden potatoes and it was just WONDERFUL!! This is a great recipe.

This was good- but not great.  I think it needed quite a bit more seasonings- Especially SALT!  I cooked the stew in the crock pot for 7 hrs and then I transferred it into a cleaned out pumpkin (I had oiled the outside) and baked it at 325 for 1.5 hours.  IT was a great presentation but the stew was good BUT LACKING.  I think I will keep looking for a GREAT stew recipe.

This is a perfect stew recipe!  I did as the other reviewers and used beef broth instead of just water.  I used yukon gold potatoes and added mushrooms.  I dind't need to add the water/flour mixture at the end, it was thick enough without it.  It came out perfect and will become the only beef stew recipe I will use.  You can add any veggies you like to change it up a little.

Excellent, except that I read most of the reviews and I think that substituting the beef broth for water is necessary. Even with that, I liked it because it wasn't too salty.  Also, prep time is definitely greater than 15 minutes.  More like 25-30.  Will make again.

Even the kids liked this one, and I'll make it again. It has a pretty good depth to it. I took another revewer's advice and used beef broth instead of water with the onion soup. I also cooked some garlic with the onions. Next time I would add more wine, and maybe toss a dried chipotle chili in the pot as well.

This was great with the changes I made: Substituted beefy-mushroom soup for some of the water, used beef-onion dry soup mix, increased the wine to 1/2 cup and used Merlot, decreased the beef by 1/2 pound, and added peas and mushrooms during the last hour. My husband LOVED this, and that's saying a lot -- he almost never likes his food 'mixed.'

The meal was good but it was too much work for being a slow cooker meal. With slow cookers, I love to just throw everything in and not worryn about browning this and sauteeing that.

Fantastic! Stew is not my hubby's favorite dish, but I think this recipe converted him. I took the advice of other viewers and added beef oxo to the water, otherwise followed the recipe. In the end I didn't need to thicken it with flour. The juices were rich and thick enough on it's own. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

I liked this, but I gave oit four stars because I had to make so many of the adjustments that oyther reviewers suggested (changing water to beef broth, adding some more spices, throwing in some frozen peas, etc.) I also thought it had too much beef, so next time I make it I think I will reduce the beef to 2 lbs, cut down to 2 potatoes, and up the broth to 3 cups (I found it didn't have enough "liquid" compared to the amount of veggies/meat). Tasted good though - a real "comfort food style" beef stew.

I prepaired the recipe as it was written and I found it a bit bland, but still a really good start.  Next time I will add more carrots and add some of the seasonings that other users recommended.

I followed some suggestions and changed the water to beef broth.  Added celery and used bay leaf and crushed red pepper.  Also added worchestershire sauce.  But it still turned out bland!  It smelled great while cooking and the meat & potatoes turned out great.  But it wasn't as tasty as I had hoped it to be.

I have not made beef stew in about 15 yrs. because i couldn't get the beef tender using the old method. So,I decide to see if using the crock-pot would help any,and this recipe was excellent!The meat was so tender,I didn't have any red wine but it still tasted excellent. I added corn and peas at the end of the cooking time and my Hubby just loved the stew,he couldn'y say enough about it,I just told him I was a good cook! Then,I confessed and told him where I got the recipe.The kitchen aroma was delightful on this snowy Sunday,almost couldn't wait to eat! Thanks so much!! Koke

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I think next time I'll double the recipe because it didn't make as many servings as I had hoped.  I am used to a more broth-y stew.

We enjoyed this stew. I started with the original recipe, but then followed some of the suggestions in the reviews.  I doubled the wine, and added a bay leaf, garlic and some worcestershire sauce.  The gravy did not need thickening, was thick enough for us.  Prep time, however, much longer than 15 minutes!  Would still make it again -- we loved the leftovers!

This is by far the best beef stew I have ever had.  So easy the crock pot does all the work.  The beef was so tender it was falling apart, I used chuck I think it is the best for stews and pot roast.  Enjoy!!

I'm a little surprised by all the high ratings.  Personnally, my husband and I thought this was somewhat bland.  And I even added a bay leaf, mushrooms, and green beans.

My husband has disliked stews all his life, until this one came into the picture. We love it! I add three chopped up celery sticks to it. And a little extra wine

We loved this recipe. (7 and 9 year old included)!
I added a tablespoon or so of whole grain dijon (picked up from another beef stew recipe) and a dash of worstershire sauce. I used red cooking wine, it's all I had on hand.
It was fabulous, thanks!

I have made this several times for my boyfriend (who's a very picky eater) and he loved it!  The meat came out so tender and the flavor was wonderful.  I did substitute beef broth for water and added some celery.  Yum!

I give this 5 stars, once I made a few changes. I used two pounds of beef, and cut it up into 1 inch slices (kids like smaller bites) when it was still partly frozen.  I substituted 2 cans beef broth and 1 can diced tomatoes w/oregeno and basil and about 6 tablespoons teriaki sauce.  No onion soup mix, I added a package of stew mix instead. (had to work with what was on hand) One huge potatoe peeled and cut up seemed to be enough and all i could fit in the crockpot. 
At the end, I dumped it all in a double dutch pot, threw in some frozen peas  and made dumplings on top of the stove,which thickened it up (dumplings from bisquick box recipie) and also, is a favorite of my kids.  

yum, my house smelled so good when I came home!

This was outstanding just as it is although I added about 1 cup of frozen peas at the end for color.  HOWEVER, it is NOT a 15 minute prep.  It took me at least 1/2 hour to get from the start to the slow cooker.  But it is definitely worth it. I used boneless short ribs and cut it myself into small pieces.  I always use that for stew; it is incredibly tender and worth the extra money.

Great stew. I cut down on the onions, using 1 large one. I also added about half a bag of frozen peas 4 hours in. What's stew without peas? Next time I will brown the beef in 2 batches, I overloaded the pan and the beef did not brown as evenly as I would have liked. It was still great, and I will make this again!

Pretty good. I did add a dab of dijon mustard, worcheshire sauce and a stalk of celery (chopped fine). I also didn't leave the onions as rings but as bigger chunks of onion. I am a bit surprised that my potatoes weren't more tender. I think I would rate this closer to a 4 or 4.5 but my husband really liked it so I will go ahead and give it a 5. Didn't need to do the gravy at the end because it was already the right consistency. I think this was due to the fact that I added more flour at the beginning when coating the meat.

SUPER GOOD! super easy, and just plain wonderful.
We had a round roast in the feezer so I cut that up in chunks and used that for the meat.  And since I have a small baby I got the stew ready the night before and just stored it in the fridge so it was ready for me to turn on in the morning.  Since it was all cold, I had it on high for 1.5 hours instead of the 30 minutes, and I still cooked it on low for 6 hours.
It turned out wonderful, so I will make it again the night before since this is when I have the most time.  But it really is easy to prepair and didn't take too long at all.

This recipe is great!  I can't believe all the textures came out nice too.  The gravy was just right....rich and smooth.  I made a few additions to the recipe and it came out quite nice.  I sauted the beef with some ginger, garlic, basil, and thyme.  I only used 1/2 pkt of onion soup mix.  My hand slipped and I added 1/2 cup of red wine instead of 1/4 but that probably made the gravy even more delicious! :-) Have fun and enjoy!!

Not bad!  I did not add the dry onion soup mix (dh is avoiding MSG). I felt the stew could have been tastier if I had added garlic and worcestershire sauce and more pepper.    A bay leaf or two might help too.

I followed the directions to this stew except I added peas and it came out great.  The meat was so tender.  My kids didn't like it but I loved it and served it with egg noodles.  I may not cook it again for a while because my kids didn't like it but I would cook it for friends and family.

I've made this a few times now each time with minor tweeks. Best stew ever. I had about 4 others I've tried and this one is now my only one. I use a bit more butter and a bit more wine. Also add 4 cloves of garlic. I also add mushrooms and corn.

I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect.

 I did add a couple of garlic cloves to the sauteing onions step only because I feel EVERYTHING needs garlic lol. The only thing I would add, other the then the garlic would be something that will give this stew a bit of a hot pepper zip. I have no idea what that would be but I guess I can always slosh a few drips of hot sauce would be just fine. 

Thanks OP for a great stew.

I used venison stew meat and everything else in the recipe I did have on hand so this was a perfect recipe for my household. Our neck of the woods actually has some snow on the ground from two days ago. It has been cold enough to stay that length of time which is a bit unusual for our area at this time of year. So a bowl of hot stew is very welcome. Thanks IAMROSIE.

I made this and it was delicious, even after substituting an ingredient within a substituted ingredient (dry onion soup mix). I did run into an issue with the potatoes not actually being cooked enough but this could have been because I used the slow cooker option on an instapot instead of an actual slow cooker?

Used a Beef Stew flavour packet (Crock Pot brand) instead of onion soup mix.

I made this on a busy Saturday. My 14 yr old son is super picky, but he ABSOLUTELY love it and so did I. This will be a repeater at our house. I did make some adjustments. Since my son doesn't like onions I only used one large sweet onion; used the small red potatoes; and skipped the parsley since I didn't have any, I did add the flour-water mixture for thickening, but next time I may skip or reduce the amount because it was a little thick for us.

Followed the recipe exactly (unlike most of the people who changed the recipe entirely and then gave it 5 stars...) It was bland, greasy because it called for too much butter, and was just a huge disappointment. 15 minutes of prep time is not accurate either. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of 1 is because it has potential if you adjust it a bit, as some people suggest in their comments. Definitely not something I would make again following this recipe, but might try to adjust it in the future.

As I am wont to do, I used this recipe as a starting point ( and it's a very good staring point, IMHO) and then "customized".   I used 1 1/4 lbs. cubed stew beef, 2 potatoes, and 2 onions, omitted the onion soup mix (didn't have any on hand) and used 3 cups of beef broth in lieu of the called-for beef bullion and water.  I added a stalk of chopped celery, rosemary, sage,  thyme, minced garlic, 1 tsp. white pepper, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, a scant bit of red pepper flakes, and threw in some frozen peas in the last 15 minutes of cooking time.  I served it over Jasmine rice and both my wife and I thought it was delicious! [ We laughed, we cried, we did the dishes.]

Delicious! I only added celery and frozen peas at the start and a bit of salt and beef bouillon at the end, along with the flour. It is meaty and really comforting. It's a keeper.

Loved it!!! In the past I have not really liked beef stew, so I was very surprised by how great this was. Followed the recipe with only one exception (I slowly sprinkled in maybe 1 tbsp of flour at the end and stirred it in so it did not clump)  and it is delicious!!! Love every bit of it! I just happened to have cooked bacon before I started this, so I cooked the stew meat in the bacon grease, so that was an unintended addition, but I’m positive this would have been just as great if I hadn’t. I WILL be saving this and using it in the future! Thank you for sharing this!

I have made this stew twice now, both times everyone loved it!!  
I use a nice full bodied Cabernet and add a little more than they suggest.   I always use fresh parsley when I make it.  One time I added celery to the pot, that was good, it changed the flavor only slightly, but I liked the texture of the celery.

Everyone in my house will eat this, which is really saying something. And I always have enough to freeze for later. Delicious.  I add a can of peas toward the end too.

I used Gluten free flour, and it made a little bit of a mess when searing the meat, but the cooking wine did it's job and dissolved it along with the fond. It was delicious.

I tried this last night, however I forgot to add the thickening agent (flour and water at the end) and inspite of my mistake, it tasted great, because of the 3 lbs of stew meat(never used this much before)it was a little expensve BUT I would fix it again.

Good stew recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe but added my own touch. I add cut up celery about 4 stalks, reconstituted the onion soup in beef broth rather than water and cooked in a pressure cooker 30 minutes. Done.

Super easy to make & my family loved it. I found I needed to add 2 cups of water about midway through the cooking. I only used 1.5 pounds of stew meat instead of the 3 pounds the recipe called for.

I used the variations suggested here: beef broth instead of onion soup, Worcestershire sauce, bay, garlic, thyme, rosemary. Turned out great. Nice for a cold winter night.

I made this according to the recipe, only added garlic and Worcestershire sauce, cooked it all day on low in a crock pot. I thickened the gravy with burgundy and cornstarch.  It was yummy.  I will definitely do this one again.

I doubled this recipe (with cornbread and sautéed broccoli) for a family dinner at my house, about 10 people.  I only got a change to taste literally three forks full and that was because I was testing it every 30 minutes during the last couple hours of cooking to make sure it wouldn't over cook.  This was a hit only wish I could have had it for dinner.  My family was well fed and happy, such a joy when you're able to see the smiles and satisfaction on your family's face after a nice family gathering and a good home cooked meal.  This is the type of meal that brings a family together.  This will become a regular at family potlucks...thank you!

I'll give this a 4 star recipe because I tweaked it a little bit. What i did differently was that i put the beef in a ziploc bag along with the salt, 1 clove of minced garlic, about a tablespoon of  Worcestershire sauce without the flour because it sticks to the pan and you'd have to either wash it off after, or get another pan. I added more veggies as suggested (celery and mushrooms). Then when i sautéed the onion in butter, i waited till it started to turn translucent then i added the 1/4 cup flour. I used 3/4 cup of frontera cabernet sauvignon merlot red wine to the skillet and this makes for an easy clean up and you can proper coat the onions with the flour. I melted two bouillon cubes in 1.5 cup warm water (as a stock substitute) and mixed it with the onion soup mix. After i transferred it all to the slow cooker, i added thyme, rosemary, along with the other spices as indicated. I added a dash of baron west indian hot sauce for a little bit of kick. Added 3 more garlic cloves, 1 more tablespoon on Worcestershire sauce. 1 hr on high and then 5 hrs on low. The last 30 mins i chopped scallions into the slow cooker while it was still watery. The final 15 mins before i put off the slow cooker i dissolved 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a tiny bit of water and added it to make a thick stew. I had a few friends over and they all had seconds!

very good recipe. do take the time to brown your meat per directions. Only had to use half the flour in the end for thickening, and added a good bit more salt & pepper to taste. Fresh thyme too. A great base recipe to work with, but will do vegetable or beef broth next time in lieu of the water & onion soup mix.

A very simple and easy beef stew. It's lacking some flavor, so I would consider adding in celery and worchestire sauce to amp it up.

Yes. I will most definitely make this again. There is a little more prep work involved for a slow cooker recipe but it was well worth it

This is a great recipe! Browning the meat before adding it to the crockpot is a MUST! I added celery, Worcestershire and a dash of thyme. I also topped it with Bisquick dough for the last 15-20 minutes. Perfect for football Sunday!

Great stew! I think when I make this again I will throw in a bunch more carrots and probably some chopped celery. The prep time is a little off. It took more like 30-40 minutes. I am definitely keeping this recipe handy for when my husband or I are craving a stew. Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

I didn't use the wine they called for but used red cooking wine. In the last hour I added fresh mushrooms and the flour and water.  And I must say it was the most delicious stew I have ever made.  Tonight I will eat it again and if what people say is true, it'll be better the second time around.  Next time I will add more green vegetables like string beans or peas and it will have some of almost every food group.    Just wonderful during these cold rainy spring days.

Pretty bland as is. I doubled up the amount of carrots, added celery, used beef broth instead of water.   After trying the first bowl, it was still really bland so I added Worcester sauce and more beef broth.  It tastes a lot better now but I don't think I'll bother making this recipe again.

Because there are just 2 of us I made 1/2 the recipe.  I followed it exactly except I used sherry instead of red wine.  I didn't have an open bottle of red wine on hand.  We enjoyed it and had enough left over to freeze for another meal.  It was simple and tasted so good.

I agree with Susanna, the best thing about this recipe is that you don't have to brown the meat first!   I also agree with another reviewer that Corrine should post her own recipe under her own name if she completely changes it!  This stew is delicious exactly as written and very, very easy to make.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

I'd rate this a keeper.  I've done easier beef stew in a crock pot, but the little extra effort resulted in a really rich and good stew.  Served to friends and they thought it was very good.  Only changes I made is add some more garlic and did what another reviewer suggested and put the flour in wine to add at the end.
Served with a small spinach salad and crusty bread.

I've made a lot of different versions of beef stew, and this is by far the best yet. I skipped one of the potatoes and added a large sweet potato and mushrooms. Perfect for a cold MN winter day - delish!!!!

This was good. I used leftover prime rib. I did add about a cup of spicy V8 but didn't have any onion soup mix.  The cornstarch and water thickened it up nicely.

1 beef shank, 1lb  of stew meat, added 3 shallots, subracted 2 onions, added green beans and garlic.  Left out the dried onion soup and went with 2 cups of beef stock.  It has the right consistency that I desire in a stew and the flavor was on point!   I will definitely make this again.  I figured mine out to be about 600 cal a serving and it made 6 portions or so :)

I had the potatoes and carrots in the crock pot on low for seven hours (plus 30 minutes on high at the beginning, as the recipe instructed) and both the carrots and potatoes were still crunchy when it came time to enjoy our meal (not a good thing!).  I also felt the recipe needed something more, so added frozen peas and fresh thyme.

I followed this recipe exactly as it's written & it is fantastic! If you're a newcomer to this recipe I would definitely give the original a go before making any alterations. It's truly simple and delicious. Also, I did have to add a little more salt but not much. Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

Excellent.  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and added a little Worcestershire sauce, extra red wine, fresh baby bella mushrooms, and minced garlic.  Used fresh chopped parsley instead of dried (double or even triple the amount), low-sodium beef broth instead of water and a little less olive oil and butter than called for to cut down some of the fat and calories.  I served it with a crusty Italian loaf and the BF loved it!  This one's a keeper.

I gave it three stars, I expected more from this recipe. Our Spanish heritage recipe make this recipe a lot more flavorful. First night we ate it has is.. Next night I added some sweet peppers, galic, cilantro, tomato sauce, bay leaves, basil, parsley and some sazon to give it some Spanish flavor! It came out awesome! We put it over some rice.

This recipe is excellent. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. My husband loves beef stew and said this was restaurant quality. I used Pinot noir for the wine and agree that all the extra prep steps are totally worth it. Thank you for submitting this recipe, it's a total keeper that I will definitely make again.

Great recipe!! I added a greater amount of spices than it calls for and also 3 or 4 minced garlic cloves  and celery for a little more depth of flavor. Great chilly weather recipe!!

This is a staple for the colder weather months. I make enough to last about two meals for three people.

My twist on this recipe is to cook it over night on low (6 to 8 hrs) and then let it cool for about 30 to 60 minutes before putting it into the fridge.  Then when I get home from work, I warm it back up again. There's something about letting stews/soups/spaghetti/chilli cool off and warmed up again that makes it amazing.

Hands down the BEST recipe!!! The only thing I changed was that I added minced garlic to the pan when browning the meat and I had to substitute Italian seasoning for the parsley because I didn't have any. My crockpot is empty, there were no leftovers, which hardly ever happens in my house. Thank you!!!

It was very good! I didn't have beef broth, so I subbed chicken broth, and no red wine, so I used white. Otherwise followed the directions as stated. Loved it.

This beef stew is a winner at my house! I borrowed ideas from other reviewers and did the following: used beef broth instead of water, added thyme, added pearl onions, and added extra carrots. This will be something I make often in the cold months. Thanks!

This was fantastic! I omitted the wine and added 3 cloves of garlic and a splash of W. Sauce. The seasonings weren't to powerful so the broth had a wonderful earthy natural flavor from all of the fresh produce. You really can add whatever veggies you want and it would be great.

The recipe by itself was a bit bland but with the adjustments it came out delicious. I added probably another cup of baby carrots to the pot. When browning the meat, I added a touch of garlic powder. I also used 3 cloves of garlic, minced it and added it after the onions were removed from the skillet and put into the pan. Instead of dry parsley, I generously used fresh parsley, fresh rosemary, and fresh thyme to taste. This was key. 

I followed another reviewers suggestion for the "thickening" paste at the end and used 1/8 cup warm water and an 1/8 cup wine to mix with the flour. It gave the stew just enough kick that was really needed. 

I also salted it a bit at the end to get the end result I wanted. It was amazing! My husband kept raving about it. Served with hot French bread and butter, yum. Thank you, this will definitely be a fall favorite!

LOVE this recipe! We make it once a month at least. My recommendation is to look up a dry onion soup mix on this site and use that instead of the packaged stuff. We found that the recipe was pretty dry so I mix a whole box of low sodium beef broth in with the onion soup mix instead of water. We usually add at least one more veggie to the mix, whatever's in the fridge at the time.

From now on this is my go to Beef Stew recipe!!! My fam loved it!! Of course, I made a small change. I substituted the red wine with white cooking wine and I also added a little left over chicken stock. None of that mattered, because the stew was still delicious!!!

This one is a keeper! I used this recipe to guide my first attempt at stew. Despite my lack of experience in the kitchen, the beef stew turned out great thanks to this recipe. Husband thought it was delicious too. I forgot to use wine but I imagine the stew would only improve with this additional step.

I make this at twice a yr during the winter. It’s become quite the family favorite. I do follow the recipe and the only thing I do differently is add in more veggies: corn, mushrooms, peas. It’s almost as amazing as the stew my Nana made when I was a child, the kind where you always go back for seconds!

Finally did it right.  I have NEVER been able to cook the beef to the right consistency.  This has really been a fantastic recipe for me.  Plus I love the video.  Finally, love the fact I can put this on LOW and come home after travelling all over town delivering people to lessons and games, and then have dinner ready when we walk in the door.  And it's GOOD.  Ha!  Love that.  Thank you for making me a hero.

First time using a slow cooker. It was a ton of fun to make!  I followed the reciepe to a T,but added some wine to the flur and water to thicken it at the end.  I agree it could use more veggies, especially carrots    I would add peas and maybe corn for color.  It hit the spot after a cold day on the slopes of the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

I wasn't really a fan? Maybe it's spiced heavy? I actually added more water and it was still kinda dry.

We really enjoyed the stew except the black pepper spoiled it.  We found 1 teaspoon too much.  Next time, I will adjust the black pepper to less than 1/2 teaspoon and adjust accordingly.

Great recipe! I didn't have wine to glaze the pan so I used part water and part packaged beef stew mix and it came out great! Also I didn't use the onion mix. I just added the glaze to the crock pot and the stew was hearty and delicious! The key is season your meat! My family loved it and wanted to know when I would fix it again.

I was worried that the stew would cook dry since not much liquid is added, but that wasn't the case at all.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I think it could stand a little more flavor (salt, garlic...something).  However, it was delicious and a winner at my house!

This was amazing!!  The ONLY thing we did different was instead of water, used beef broth, per others suggestion.  Well worth the little extra prep work.

Overall, I was pleased.  The meat was very tender.  Next time, instead of the water and onion soup mix, I'll add two cups of beef broth and a cup of wine.

Reminded me of the stew my dad made when I was younger - thick and delicious.  I left out the red wine, used broth for the water and added a bunch of garlic in with the onions.

Instead of using red wine - I used 1/4 cup of whiskey. I also added garlic (because I love it way too much). I browned the meat, but didn't overcook it as I figured it would get cooked thoroughly from the heat. I also didn't use the slow cooker as it was too small. Just followed the instructions. Let it "boil" for 30 minutes and let it on low the rest of the day. I really enjoyed this stew and will be making it again. It was also the first time I have ever made stew and was really happy with how it turned out!

This was ok. I cooked on high for an hour and a 1/2 and then on low for 3 hours. I added more red wine than what was called for and some worcheshire sauce. To me it just tasted like stew.

I've made this stew several times now, tweaking it a little as I've learned what to expect. As written, the recipe is very good, and the gravy has a nice not-too-thick, not-too-thin consistency.  The aroma it creates while simmering is fabulous! However, my family found the flavor a bit bland.  I've taken the advice of some of the other reviewers, adding beef bullion to the water/onion soup mixture and adding garlic and thyme.  I've also added a little salt and more wine (whatever dry red wine I've had on hand).  The most recent time I made this stew I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and four fresh zuchinni squash, cubed, toward the end of the cooking process - maybe an hour before taking it up, which gave the dish a boost in flavor and texture.  I'll continue to make small alterations, but I will definately use this recipe as a starting point for stew from now on.

I didn't have onion soup so I used cream of mushroom.  It turned out excellent!  I added about a cup of Malbec wine to deglaze the pan.  I also added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and a couple shakes of ground thyme.  Towards the end of the cooking I stirred in a mix of cornstarch and water to thicken it all up.  This is a definite keeper and will be my go to recipe for beef stew!  I am giving 5 stars even though I made a few changes but I think the recipe would be excellent as written too!

I use this recipe EVERY TIME!!! The only thing I do differently is I don't use 3 onions and I don't thicken it at the end because the broth is delicious to sop up with bread!!! I refuse to use any other recipe for beef stew! :)

I made a few minor changes to the recipe. I didn't have wine so I didn't deglaze, and I added bay leaves, dried basil, and garlic salt along with the dried parsley. I also didn't need to add the flour at the end. It was so delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

I love beef stew in the slow cooker in the fall and all through winter. I prefer celery and a lot of garlic. This recipe is very versatile based on what you have on hand. This time I had an orange banana pepper and it turned out great! Searing the meat is really key to tender pieces in the end, I have made it both ways and that extra step makes a world of difference. This is the season for this recipe and I will be making it again and again!

This was tasty. I omitted the onion soup mix only because I didn't have any on hand, but will make it again and add the soup because I think it would enhance the overall flavour. I also added beef broth in place of the water.  Used almost an entire bottle of merlot (!) as I really wanted the flavour of the wine.

This recipe was good. A bit of prep work but worth it for the delicious, tender meat. Though I'd say don't forget garlic, that's a serious omission! Otherwise something was missing... Bay leaves or maybe more wine. Will make again, thank you for the recipe!

I used petite sirloin for the beef. After it was cooked, it seemed rather bland. I added a tablespoon of beef flavored Better Than Boullion, some Thyme and more salt and pepper. That improved the flavor dramatically! I also added frozen corn.

Awesome,  had to add a bit more flour to thicken it up though.  To reduce the prep time I didn't flour the meat or saute the onions I just dropped them in.  Also I didn't add butter.   Came out amazing!

Love a 50/50 meat to veggie ratio, so loaded up on extra carrots, celery, mushroom & onion. One seasoning packet was light, I would use two next time. Enjoyed for several days of quick, reheat lunch & dinner.

This makes an excellent stew. I followed the advice to use extra wine (I used Malbec) and probably could have used a bit more. I also added some fresh rosemary, as I had some on hand that I wanted to use up. It got rave reviews. It does require a lot of prep time (took me an hour to get it into the slow cooker), especially because browning 3 pounds of meat takes a lot of time. But I have to say that the meat came out very tender and juicy because of the browning process.

I skipped the onions because I am not a huge fan but still used the onion soup mix which added good flavor. I took everyone's advice and used extra red wine but went a little overboard. Next time I'll still use extra but still not as much and the first time. The merlot definitely added a great flavor. The meat came out nice and moist and pulled apart. I used red potatoes because those are my favorite and they cooked great in this recipe.

Excellent for a cold winter night...I kinda changed it up a bit no used white wine instead of red,  basil instead of parsley added scallons and mushrooms also before pre-cooking the meat I minced and sauteed 4 cloves of garlic then cooked the meat.  Cant even describe how the flavor explodes it is YUMMY!!

It ended up being good but I had to add seasonings and tomato paste to give it decent flavor.  As written it was just OK...

Awesome - Added Montreal Steak seasoning to flour.  Browned beef w/ onions, put into crock pot.  Added 2 cups of water to pan, added lipton soup and parsley - brought to a boil then added to beef in crock pot.  Added vegetables to the top.  Cooked 4 hours on high.  Did not add wine.  Was plenty thick without added additional flour and water.

Despite the onion soup mix, I still thought it tasted a bit bland.  Maybe I needed to add more salt.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe as closely as possible. I didn't add as much onion, but increased the carrots. I also added some garlic powder to the stew. I wasn't crazy about the red wine flavor, so I'll probably sub broth next time.

I was quite happy with how this recipe turned out. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to double the amount of carrots; they seemed to get eaten up in the first day and weren't enough swimming around in the leftovers. I definitely will make this again.

Omitted the wine (since serving to recovering alcoholic this time)so I added a can of stewed sliced tomatoes.  Plenty of liquid and didn't need to thicken the stew.  The longer it sits, the better it is.  For myself, when I make it again, I will use a nice table wine!

Just OK.
It was my first stab at a slow cooked stew. It was flavorful and the meat was very tender but I feel there was something lacking.  The recipe was easy enough for even the most inexperienced and the video gave an excellent visual instruction. I will probably make this again but will do something a little differently.

Excellent!! Just made this last night and my family went for seconds - even my husband who doesn't usually like stew. Was skeptical about the soup mix ingredient but it worked! Definitely watch the video for helpful chopping and searing tips.

This was an excellent recipe!! Only changes I made was to use beef bouillon, a little more water, Worcester sauce (couple dashes) and I threw in some mushrooms. Only difference is that mine was done in about four hours, not six.  But delicious!!

Needed to figure out what to make for the Fiesta Bowl Game since in was going to be on a Thursday (GO DUCKS) and we were going to have people over.... i saw this and it worked perfect! Everyone loved it! I made it the night before and then in the morning I set it to our christmas light timer. So I wouldn't over cook it. It cooked for 7 1/2 hours on low. I never did the 30 min. high thing, cause i didn't have time. My crockpot was filled to the brim, but broke down and had lots of juice to it. Next time i might try the beef broth if i have any on hand. I just followed the recipe as is and it was great.

This was my first attempt at stew in my new crockpot, and it came out great. I used condensed french onion soup, in addition to the dry onion soup mix and water. I was worried it might be too much onion flavor but it came out great. I also only had 1.25 pounds of beef, but still used the recipe proportions for the other ingredients, and there was enough meat. We ate it a little sooner than suggested cooking time, it was still great but meat was not as tender as we wanted. Left it to cook on low for another hour or so and it was perfect. Left overs were even better the next day.

The best stew recipe we've found so far.  Used a Cabernet Shiraz for the wine and added some french style green beans. The sauce turned out so good, great for soaking those dinner rolls.

Good base recipe but lacking in flavor, used extra salt and pepper.  Recommend beef broth and/or cream of mushroom soup to add flavor.

Made on stove top as not enough time for slow cooker....loved it! Simmered for about 5 hours and did not need to add any additional flour. Used 1 can beef broth instead of any water. Very filling.

Bloody excellent, savory taste, nice gravy, live in Thailand and good western food is difficult to find. Have made this 3 times & always great raves. I did add some dehydrated button mushrooms (a few) & a few anchovie fillets (chopped) a trick I learned from the Cook's website - fantastic flavor. Also optional a Tbl spoon of Bovril  for a more savory traditional British culinary experience - awesome. Thank you IAMROSIE

Made this last night for company and everyone loved it! I used just 1 large sweet onion, doubled amt of red wine to 1/2c, & added some cherry tomatoes that weren't good enuf for the salad. I was short on time, so had slow cooker on high for 3 or 3 1/2 hours, and it was delicious!

Next time I'll try the variations without the onion soup, since all those I could find had MSG in them.

I didn't have wine so I added a few tsp of balsamic vinegar with some water.  It gave the stew a great flavor.  I also sauteed some mushrooms with the onions and they tasted great in the stew. My favorite stew recipe!

So i loved making this recipe. I actually changed a thing or 2 in it and i loved the changes. to make it slightly healthier and not as bulky by adding potatoes, i add cooked barley. i wait till it has about 15 minutes left then add the cooked barley so it absorbs some of the flavor without sucking up all of the juice. I also love to add canned corn and green beans near the end as well to increase the amount of veggies. Also what i found my family likes more is instead of using the large chunks of beef, i get the lean bites. follow the same steps and they love the smaller pieces. to make it beefier, i add that concentrated beef stock to the package of onion soup mix. adds great flavor. thanks for the recipe!

We didn't have any wine, so added some BBQ sauce on top once everything was in the crockpot. Also added some celery! This is a great recipe!

It was way too thick for my tastes and the flavors were overpowering.  If I were to make it again, I'd use a lot for liquid and tone down the wine.

This beef stew is awesome. The only thing I added was garlic and maybe a little extra wine. So good and worth the work.

This recipe was wonderful! The only thing I changed was I used low sodium beef broth instead of using the 2 cups of water. Gave it so much more flavor. I also added celery to the recipe.

Stew came out excellent!  Hubby is on the second helping.  I did adjust the recipe a little.  After frying meat i added 4 cloves of garlic and scraped up the brown drippings and added to the crockpot.  I added 5 stalks of celery, 2 jars of pearl onions, 1 tsp. Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce, 2 bayleaves, 1/4 tsp chili powder,1 tsp. garlic powder/onion powder and 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and 1 cup of red cooking wine and 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce.  I only cooked 30 min high and 5 hrs on low setting.  During the last 30 min of cooking i added a splash of balsamic vinegar, mixed 1/2 cup of warm water and 4tbsp of cornstarch to thicken sauce. Delicious!

This was really good! Served with french bread and mashed potatoes. The stew made a great gravy. We made a lot of changes including adding anchovies to bring out a more beefy taste. Heard about that lil tidbit on America's test kitchen. Don't worry, doesn't taste like anchovies at all!

This is one great recipe.  We have made beef stew for years and this is our favorite beef stew recipe. It tastes as good as it smells.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  You can not go wrong with this recipe.  Does this sound like we love it?  You will think the same once you try it.

This recipe was a great start to play with and make my own.  My husband is a picky eater and tough critic but he raved about this more than anything I've made in a while.
I followed the recipe for the most part but used pinot grigio in place of the red wine, still using it to deglaze the pan after cooking the beef and the onions beforehand.  I also added fresh green beans and mushrooms, some garlic powder and an extra cup of water before leaving the stew to slow-cook on low for 8hrs.  When I got home, I added the flour and water and boiled some egg noodles and it was a perfect meal.
It came our really great and I will absolutely make beef stew this way from now on.  It took a while to prep in the morning but it was worth it.

Great recipe!  Followed exactly as written with the exception of adding mushrooms.  I sauteed the mushrooms with a little butter and more red wine before doing the deglazing.  My very picky 6 year old ate this as well.  She was shocked she liked onions!  The flavor was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good base recipe but i added and sutracted.  Omitted onion soup, replaced w better than bullion and kept same amt of boiling water.  Added garlic and subtracted one onion.  The wine should be a flavorful one..used carmenere.  I prefer rutabega to potato, and added parsnips as well.  I got lots of compliments though, maybe i should write my own recipe, lol

Excellent!  I added a few things that some other reviewers suggested.  I can of stewed tomatoes, used beef broth instead of water, half a bag of frozen peas, and a dash or Worcester sauce.  It is just soooooo good.

Instead of 2 cups boiling water, I decrease it to one and add a cup of tomato juice...from my Dad's old Presto Pressure Cooker recipe. Fantastic meal!

OMG!  This was SOOO delicious!  It got devoured by everyone.  I made it in the pressure cooker instead of stovetop, and didn't brown the meat.  Just sauted the onions and carrots, threw everything in except for flour, adjusted liquid for pressure cooker to 2 cups total.  Then added flour roux at the end to thicken.  SERVE WITH CRUSTY BREAD!  Yum!

Two cloves of garlic are a must!  I'm doing the paleo diet right now and substituted almond flour for regular flour and used sweet potatoes.  I cheated and kept the wine.  Hey, still gotta live.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Ok, this was an excellent base recipe!!  I used almost all of the ingredients as written, except that I cut the onions down to 1 and swapped out the onion soup mix for a pre-mixed stew seasoning packet; my husband isn't a big onion fan. And I did use 2 cups of boiling beef broth instead of plain water.  I cooked the stew on low for 7 hours, the last 30 minutes with the mixed in flour paste.  The gravy thickened perfectly. 

My husband says this stew MIGHT be the best thing I ever cooked!!

We really enjoyed this recipe - just a few modifications since we didn't have Onion Soup mix. I used McCormick Beef Stew seasoning which was excellent because it made the gravy thick and rich so I didn't need the flour & water at the end.  Also bumped up the Red Wine to a 1/2 cup and backed down the potatoes to 3.  Really good and look forward to the leftovers.

Hubs is eating it right now and says it's great!  I did tweak it, though.  

I hate my crock pot and don't use it anymore.  It incinerates everything I make.  I wish I still had my old 3 1/2 qt. Rival that I sold at a yard sale.  It was too small but nothing ever ended up burnt to a crisp.  

I used my dutch oven and improvised.....had fresh, roasted tomatoes, so threw those in w/ a can of tomato sauce.  I pared down the onions to 1 large and 1/2 of another large one.  Par boiled the potatoes and then added.  Also, threw in a jar of white onions, used fresh parsley, organic carrots, lots of celery.  It tastes fantastic!  Probably tripled the recipe since I bought a 5 lb. pkg. of stew meat from Sam's, for quick sale!

This was a very hearty, spicy stew.  We as a family really liked it.  I served it with bisquits.  I used a bit of apple juice in place of the red wine.  Yummy!

This was probably the best stew I ever had. The only change I made was to use an additional 1/4 cup wine instead of water when mixing with the flour for gravy at the end. I also used regular carrots (about 6) cut diagonally instead of baby carrots, and I used only 1 small onion. I felt 3 onions and onion soup mix would have been overkill.

Yum, yum. I made this exactly as indicated, but added a can of stewed tomatoes, and in place of using the wine, I used the liquid from the tomatoes to deglaze the pan. Delicious.

I marinated the beef in wine and garlic as suggested, but didn't have beef bouillon, so I just used water - and it was wonderful! I can't say if the bouillon would have made it better, but it was amazingly tasty as it was. I also added peas in the last 15 minutes which made it more colourful.
My only complaint is that both my husband and I both had to add salt and he doesn't usually salt his food. To each his own and salting after is fine for us, but I may try adding a bit more salt next time.

My husband wanted beef stew. Having never made it before, I looked for a recipe that sounded similar to my mom's.
This did not disappoint. The only substitution I made was low sodium beef broth for the wine.
Excellent with crusty bread!

My husband absolutely loved this!!He commented over and over on how good the flavor was. I almost cut back on the onions because he does not usually like a lot of onions,but he thought it was perfect.
I added more carrots and instead of the water used beef stock. A perfect meal to warm us up on this cold winters night!

This was awesome.  We added some peas toward the end.  I didn't thicken it and it could actually use a little more liquid.  It is really good reheated too.

I followed this recipe to the tee and it came out great. I used sweet red table wine instead your normal dry red wine, but it still came out excellent. Next time I might add garlic and other veggies, as others have mentioned, but overall this is such a delish and hearty stew.

I decided to make this stew for my boyfriend and I late the other night so we could wake up and have stew for lunch.  I prepared the recipe almost exactly as it says, except I forgot to boil the water before adding it to the pot.  Wow, this was a HUGE mistake.  I cooked the stew on high for an hour and then switched it to low and went to sleep.  I accidentally cooked the stew for an extra 8 hours (bc I didn't wake up to my alarm) and was expecting a soggy mess! Nope, the potatoes and the carrots weren't even close to being done!  I continued to cook the stew on low and kept checking it every hour.  It took almost 12 more hours to cook this stew!!!!    The renamed "24 Hour Stew" came out pretty tasty, but wowsers did it take a long time.  The flavors were ok and it probably could have used some tomatoes.    My only advice is to boil that water before adding to the pot!  Or you will be waiting a loooong time before you get your food!

Love this recipe! I made some changes as well. Instead of the onion soup mix, I used a can of french onion soup. I didn't want to bother worrying about the thickness of the gravy later on, so I skipped the flour and just used a can of mushroom soup. I did deglaze the pan with wine and added about half a can of water as well. I also added some fresh thyme from the garden. This was so good! The whole house smelled great.

Made this for my boys, they loved it. I did add LOTS more garlic and spices (Bay leaf, branch of fresh rosemary). But thats a personal preference. I plan on making this a cold month staple.

My family enjoyed this delicious stew! Might add green beans next time and maybe double the red wine. I used onion mushroom dry soup mix rather than the onion and also used the whole package rather than 1/2. Excellent!

This was really really delicious. I didn't change a thing about the recipe as written. My husband added worcestershire to his bowl and didn't taste a difference. House smelled so good, very filling, makes a lot. Next time I will add a bit more wine and maybe some mushrooms.

I think the cooking time for the recipe may be too long as everything was extremely soft and broken down.  The beef was so tender that it broke apart.  Honestly, the presentation was awful!  We had company for dinner and ended up having to cook cardboard pizza!

This recipe was hearty & delicious. I made some changes to speed up the process a little - I threw in mushrooms and onions with the beef cubes while they browned. I used both onion soup & beef broth. The onion soup just didn't seem like enough. I had some celery on hand and added that with the veggies. Finally, I added a can of peas a little before I served up the dish.

This was great!   I started this meal while the kids took a nap and was worried about the cook time.  I did high heat for 2 hours and then low for 2 hours and everything was more than tender.   I did mashed potatoes instead of cubing them and I added 4 celery stalks to the mix.   Will be a household staple!

My mom, a FANTASTIC home cook, switched her beef stew recipe to this one after trying it. The adds some beef boullion to make it more flavorful. She also strains the onion after mixing the onion soup mix with water (for my nephews) and omits the fresh onions. This is a great recipe; thank you for sharing!!

OK....I read all of the reviews before I made this stew..and it came out great!!  Just like everything else you have to make changes to suit your families taste.  I used 1 cup of white wine and one cup of water with the onion soup mix. I also added 1 beef bouillion cube.  For seasonings, I added Complete Seasoning, about a tsp of of thyme and rosemary. I also seasoned the potatoes with onion powder and complete seasoning before I added the browned beef and the rest of the veggies.  I followed the rest of the recipe to the "T".  This stew was awesome!  I will be adding this to my recipe rotation...Yummy!!!

The best beef stew we have ever tasted.  I didn't change a thing or add to it.  I must admit that I didn't have any onions, so I added a jar of the bottled onions and it was fantastic.         Thanks Rosie                                 TNT

I am changing my review from 4 stars to 5.  I'm not sure what I did differently, but this time, it was awesome!  I think I got more flavor out of the meat by browning it in a stainless steel pan and transferring all of the little bits that stuck to the bottom into the crockpot.

Wow best stew I have ever made! Turned out amazing - loved it with the red wine. I followed the recipe my only change was adding wine with the flour at the end to thicken with instead of using the water. Thanks for the great recipe I will be making this one again and again!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this stew.  The only changes I made was to add a little more carrot, 1 cup of boiling water instead of 2, 1 cup of red wine instead of 1/4 cup.  Also added a dash of cayenne pepper.  It needed no flour at the end to thicken.  It was perfect!

Easy recipe and great taste!  The thing I love about slow cooker recipes is you can just go one step at a time, and prepare as you go!  You've got plenty of time to go through this recipe at a leisurely pace, a great way to spend the late morning, and then the house smells of delicious beef stew all day.

What a great recipe!  We made it and cooked it over the campfire.  I used flank steak in place of the beef stew meat.  I marinated in in equal parts of red wine, soy sauce and olive oil for an hour or so.  I then browned it and threw in some flour as well as some garlic. It was so tender you cuold cut it with a fork.  I also used some mushrooms along with the other veggies.  I had to add some extra beef broth.. We cooked it over the campfire for about 3 hours.  Delicious!!

It was bland for us (salt and pepper helped), but I did not use the onion soup mix (added onion flakes and garlic powder instead, but guess it wasn't enough). The only onion mix I could find had MSG in it, which I don't eat. But next time I'll use this beef stew mix seasoning I've recently found and I bet it'll be great!

Came out VERY tasty! Added peas & celery.  Only thing, I replaced water with beef broth and I think I put too much beef broth into the mixture causing it to not be as thick.  But not bad for my first beef stew!

I LOVED IT!! I'm from the South but with French parents (not from Louisiana) so I always had an usual mix of good ol' home cooked meals and extravagant rich stuff, too. My boyfriend is Puerto Rican so his food is very much different - but we made this together last night with a few changes (more red wine, no thickener at the end, beef broth instead of onion soup, a little minced garlic and some corn at the end) and he LOVED IT! So did I. It was the perfect and super easy way to make a really delicious meal on a cold, rainy day!

Awesome awesome awesome. My husband and friend ate 3 bowls each or MORE! Only thing I didn't add was the onion soup mix. I never have any in the cupboard. I also leave out the butter so it's more healthy. I add Greek seasoning... but I add it to everything I cook.

4 out of 5 because I modified it.  I used Lipton dry vegetable soup mix instead, and veggie stock.  Added mushrooms and celery instead, which helped to keep it from getting too thick.  No potatoes because I didn't have any.  Cooked on high for 4 hours and let warm for 1 hour.  THe last step isn't needed unless you add too much liquid in.

Excellent!! I served this over creamy mashed potatoes. I also marinated the meat overnight in red wine. Accidently added extra water but was able to thicken it with cornstarch during last half hour.

This was excellent! Best of all my husband REALLY liked it. I changed a few things. My husband really dislikes wine so I didn't add the red wine and I didn't have any parsley so I didn't add that. Also, I didn't sautee the onions, just threw them in the crockpot at the beginning. I also didn't add the last part of the the last step which was the warm water and flour. Instead I added 1/2 cup of beef broth at the very beginning and that made for enough sauce. I will for sure be making this again, it made my house smell so good on a cold winter day!

I loved this!!! The flavors were spot on. Cooking the onions until soft really improves the flavor. The only thing I added was 1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes (in oil, but removed oil) that I cut up into thin strips.Thank you Rosie!!!!!

I really love this stew recipe. I leave out the onion soup mix and instead just use water or beef broth. I have used the red wine but sometimes I  use Corona if I don't have any wine on hand and it works just great! Tastes great every time and so easy! Perfect for a fall or winter day! :)

Awesome! I used 1.5 lbs meat and 1 onion. I used 1 can of beef broth instead of water. I used Merlot for the wine. I also used beefy onion soup mix.

This stew is excellent!! I made very few substitutions (rare for me) - used beef stock instead of water, and added about 1.5 tbsp of Montreal steak seasoning to coating flour (replacing S&P and dried herbs/onion soup mix).  Browning the meat made all the difference. I put everything in the pot in late evening, and had an excellent meal by morning.  I refrigerated the gravy separately so I could separate the fat.  I am making it again this weekend, for company.

GREAT! DELICIOUS! A huge hit! Followed the recipe exactly except for adding the flour in the end to thicken. It was plenty thick without that.

I followed this recipe almost to the letter and it was delicious. I threw in some frozen green beans and peas. My only problem is it wasn't enough food to feed my 3 large teenage boys, boyfriend and the unexpected friend that stopped by. So saying it's 12 servings?? Guess it depends on your eaters. Next time I will double it because we would have loved to have had leftovers. Other than that it was very good.

This recipe is great.  I don't understand the people who said it was bland.  I made it more or less as indicated, and we all loved it.  I didn't have any onions, so I left them out.  No harm, it was fine.  I added more red wine to give it a little deeper flavor.  Other than that, only flavoring was salt, pepper and the onion soup mix.  Also loved it in the slow cooker.  No worries about leaving a pot on the stove all day!  Definitely recommend this beef stew recipe.

The addition of red wine to a stew was an interesting contributing flavor; however, I thought the use of a slow cooker was impractical. I would recommend that people just cook this recipe using a covered pot on medium-low heat. This way you're able cook all the previous steps in the same pot and end up with less dishes to clean in the end.

a little bland, but if you know what flavouring you like, just add it. Good base recipe though.

This was delicious!  The pan searing really helps keep the meat moist.  I added celery but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I also took some of the beef cubes out after it was done and shredded them and added the shreds back to the stew.  I think this increases the meaty flavor in every bite!

This had wonderful flavor and the meat and veggies were very tender.  It was quite thick though, which I liked.  However, if you want more broth you'll need to add more liquid.

Just finished the last of the leftovers of this really tasty stew - and it was EASY.  Browning the meat made all the difference (as always), and using the freshest ingredients helps, too (thank goodness for Whole Foods and my CSA box).  I originally balked at the onion soup mix, and have to admit that it added to the flavor.  Total yummage!

Great recipe!  I didn't add the butter (I think beef stew already has enough fat and calories...) Subbed leftover rice for the potatoes.

My family really liked this. I did add a couple of bay leaves and when I did the onions I threw in some mushrooms too. I didn't add the flour at the end-I just left the cover off for a few minutes and it was thick enough. Next time I think I will add some rosemary.

When it's eight below outside, what could be better than a crock pot of stew?  I'm making this for the second time as it's now on my husband's list of all time favorites.  I added more potatoes and carrots than called for in the recipe.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I just used beef broth instead of water.  I also added fresh mushrooms and bay leaves.  I didn't find it necessary to add flour at the end.  It thickened up beautifully.

This was pretty good, a bit bland.  I added turnips and sweet potatoes for flavor and lots more pepper (double or more)  Texture was wonderful.  Comfort food to the max.

I cooked this recipe for my family of four.  After smelling it cook all day, I was quite ready to try it by the time it was finished.  We all decided that it needed some seasoning.  It was quite bland and definitely needed something to perk it up.  It was acceptable, but not something that I would trouble to make again.

This recipe is a little bland.  It may be because I didn't complete all the pre-Crock Pot steps.  Also, perhaps some additional garlic powder, more boullion or more salt/pepper would improve the flavor.  I only omitted the carrots.

This is a hearty, flavorful stew that my family loved.  Like many recipes, I cannot leave well enough alone and this was no exception.  While the stew was very tasty, it lacked something.  I added about an 8th of a teaspoon of thyme and rosemary and a 16th of a teaspoon of sage.  I also added some celery salt as well.  Also, when adding the veggies, I included some sliced baby portobello mushrooms and some celery.  A loaf of fresh baked bread and a glass of cabernet  rounded this meal out wonderfully.

I tried this recipe a few times, using only the original recipe, then some modifications, then playing around with various cuts of beef and different cooking temps, etc.  For some reason I cannot get this to come out as amazing as the other reviewers suggest.  The flavor is OK I guess, but definitely not the best stew I've had and way too much prep work for a slow cooker recipe.  Sorry.

Love this recipe!  Made a few changes, but everything works out fine.  I changed the meat and used a pot roast instead--found the stew meat too tough no matter how long it cooked.  I doubled the wine and marinated the pot roast in the wine, fresh garlic, and fresh thyme overnight first.  I then browned the roast and used the same pan to cook the onions in then using the marinade to deglaze the pan.  I added everything to the crock pot, and used half beef broth and water to disolve the onion soup in.  It turns out absolutely fabulous and my whole family loves it.  Oh-I threw in a bay leaf too.  Thanks much

This stew is really good, but takes alot of work and time when you have to fry the beef first before putting it in the crock pot.

This was excellent! I made a few changes: substituted red wine for worcestershire sauce, added mushrooms, and added beef broth because my stew had not been brothy enough when it was done cooking.  Ate this with "fluffy biscuits" http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Fluffy-Biscuits/Detail.aspx?pos=1 An excellent combination!

Excellent!  I made the mistake of using a strong red wine which overpowered the stew; will use something lighter next time.  Still turned out tasty and pretty easy to make.

I give this 4 stars, because if I make it by the directions, it's too onion-y for me. 
Here are my modifications to make it 5 stars:
1 small onion instead of 3
No onion soup mix
2 Cups beef broth + a bit of Worcestershire sauce as a replacement for the water.

This was really good. I only made a couple of changes. I used beef broth like others suggested and a little worcestershire sauce. Very good!

This is an awesome recipe.  I changed it a tiny bit and instead of water, added 2 cups of beef broth.  Also, the 2nd time I made it I forgot to get the onion soup mix so I added 1 can of condensed french onion soup...tasted just as good.  I made this on a cold 9 degree day for the boys to eat while watching the football games and boy it was a hit!

I'm not really a fan of this - I found it way too bland. The meat and vegetables came out wonderfully tender, but they, and the sauce, just had very little flavor.

Delicious.  will be making this again, and printing off the recipe to take to the folks at the office.  even my picky kid ate it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, might add a little more water, as it was pretty thick, but it was awesome

Definitely good, but nothing too exciting.  Maybe I just don't get excited enough about beef stew!  Seemed a little involved at the beginning for a slow cooker recipe.  A recent review said it was too salty, but I thought it needed salt.  Would probably make a nice cold, rainy/snowy day meal!

This is a great stew for anyone to try! I had to make a few minor adjustments but the overall taste is super! I got a late start that day so I opted to use a 3 lb chuck roast that I cubed and tenderized and then I opted to slow cook this on my stove top. Using the chuck roast and cooking it on the stove top for about 2.5 hours still gave me a devine stew that was as tender as it could be! I only opted to drop the water in the recipe and put in beef stock as another reader suggested and I didnt have the wine it called for so I grabbed my cooking sherry and it did the trick! I will make this again and again....!

I REALLY liked this recipe. I previously made a different beef stew recipe from this site and was not satisfied so I tried this one.  It definitely has the hardy beef flavor I was looking for.  The only difference I made was I used only half the packet of onion soup mix and then used half a packet of McCormicks Beef stew seasoning (but I think it would be fine without it). At the end I used a few dashes of worschestershire sauce. I will make this again and again.  Yummy!

Whole family loved this one. Even my  pickiest 14 yr old son, who would rather eat peanut butter sandwiches then what rest of family has for dinner.
Wine gave the stew a wonderful flavor.
I will  add this to  our fave list of meals and make often.
Thanks Diane

My husband loves this recipe and would give it 5 stars.  I would give it 4 stars because I am not a red wine fan, and I can taste it in the stew. Great recipe overall.  Have made it many times and will continue to do so.

This was good, tasted about the same as the recipe that I usually use.  I was looking for something just a little bit different.  Still was a nice dinner with a nice, thick gravy.  I decided to serve this over rice to stretch it out and it was really good.  I never have served over rice.  Salad and french bread made this dinner a success.

EXCELLENT...  I made about 6 quarts in a slow cooker.  Let it slow cook all day long.  Didn't even have to thicken it at the end, it thickened itself.  Family loved it, 1/2 quart left in the slow cooker.

Family really enjoyed.  I used beef broth instead of water.  I also added a frozen bag of vegetables for beef stew (for convenience)and next time I think I will add some frozen peas (preference.)  Used a good rye bread for sopping up the gravy.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This was good, but not great. I prefer our usual stew recipe better, and it takes much less time to prepare. Thanks for a change of pace, though, we did enjoy it.

This recipe turned out well, but my family and I found it to be a bit on the bland side on its own.
First off, I reduced the potatoes--I personally don't care for potatoes too much-plus, I felt that they were out of proportion to the amount of carrots.
Towards the end of cooking-(when I realized the flavor needed a little help)  I added a couple of bay leaves, extra black pepper, FRESH parsley, a dash of balsamic vinegar and it was actually pretty yummy!  I would save this as a basic recipe to dress up.

Overall was a really good stew! I added more wine as some other people suggested but didn't really like it .Next time I will make it without the wine and use beef broth instead. I also added peas and mushrooms and a 1/2 cup of pearl barley , it made it a lot thicker

very tasty! gave it 4 stars because there is no way this feeds 12 people. Had my sister, father, and his girlfriend over for dinner with my husband and i. no one had seconds and we served in cereal sized bowls. my only complaint-of course i don't think anything else would have fit in my crockpot!

I followed other peoples advise and added more wine, and no water.  I also added celery and green beans. This is a great tasting easy meal. I will be making this again very soon.

Very tasty and didn't last long at all in my house (and to think I had expected to have some left over to freeze for later)! I followed some of the suggestions of other users and added a bay leaf and a little garlic powder. I also used a little more red wine. I only wish I had added some frozen peas to the mix, and maybe some mushrooms! Thumbs up!

I didn't care for this recipe too much.  I found it to be bland and lacking the flavors that it seemed to promise in it's ingredients.  I'm giving it three stars because I think that it has great potential with a few modification.

My family just finished this one and all loved it!  So easy, and very tasty. I did'nt have red wine so I substituted beef broth.  Also, didn't need to add any flour at the end...it was already thick! This one is a keeper!

This recipe had a great flavor, thanks I believe to the use of red wine. I modified it a bit by sauteeing some minced fresh garlic with the onion. I also had to thin it out a bit with the addition of some beef broth so we'd have enough gravy to sop up with rolls. No thickening needed here! Overall, the stew was a hit, with my son-in-law eating three bowls full and asking if he could take some of the leftovers to work for lunch the next day. I'll definitely make this one again on the next cold, snowy day we have...uhhh, tomorrow, I think!

This is by far the best beef stew I've ever had!  I made this about a month ago and my boyfriend could not get enough...he took leftovers to work and his coworkers were begging him to bring more for them the next day.  I'm snowed in today from work and making it again.  I will post a picture later this evening.

Very easy to make and meat was very tender.  I was generous with the red wine, added garlic and only used 2 onions.  I think maybe I would cut the onions up smaller next time (not left as rings)  Very yummy.

This was pretty tasty. I did make a few changes. I added a bit of browning sauce (probably a teaspoon) and some Worcestershire. And I thickened with both cornstarch and flour. I would try to zip up the flavor a bit more, even, next time. Yummy with homemade rye bread.

My stew didn't turn out that great, but it was probably my fault.  I was using a really old slow cooker and the potatos never cooked. I had to fish them out and microwave them.  Also, the beef wasn't very tender.  I don't know if that was my fault, the slow cooker's, or the Safeway meat.  I did add celery and other spices.  It smelled great and we were sad the stew didn't taste as great as it smelled.  Next time I would use regular carrots rather than baby ones.

I really liked this recipe!  I did add lots of different seasonings like chili powder, garlic powder, dried mustard to the flour.  I used frozen carrots and baby carrots - the 'real' carrots were much better than the frozen!  I think next time I will add fresh green beans too.  I added worcestershire to the onion soup.  It was a little runny, and I used cornstarch instead of flour, and it turned out perfect!!!!

my whole family loved it - I used mixed frozen vegies (carrots, peas, corn, green beans), and fresh celery along w/ the potatoes, instead of just baby carrots.  I will definately use this one again!
