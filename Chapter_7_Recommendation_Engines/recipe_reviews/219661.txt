Very good.  This was very easy and quick to make up.  I used Italian seasoning on the pizza and in the sauce.  My kids loved it, calling it upside down pizza!  I also used reduced fat cheese and turkey pepparoni to cut down on the fat.

This is a good recipe but I think I'd add peppers or some other filling to it next time.

Easy peasy recipe. But my family didn't put the pizza on the top of the recipe. It was sort of a Sausage mix with pizza on the side. I topped my pizza with a little bit of italian seasoning as well as the last reviewer, just because it looked plain. I think next time I'm going to do chunk pepperoni and dice up with the sausage. Overall...it was decent.
