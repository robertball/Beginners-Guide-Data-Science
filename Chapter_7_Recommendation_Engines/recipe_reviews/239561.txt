Made this for Thanksgiving. The first comment I got was OMG are these good. They are so simple to make. I agree the sea salt gives it that little extra. I also drizzled a little chocolate over the top. Oh so good!

This was awesome! I drizzled it with caramel sauce and they were fantastic!

Amazing treat! Easy to make, and the sea salt adds a boost of flavor that helps tie everything together.

I just made these today for the first day of December...the recipe said it would make 36 but it didn't but they were a HIT with this family, I followed the recipe exact except I didn't use sea salt...I was asked not to include that so I didn't. I think these would be a hit any where!

These were just OK, not a lot of "cheesecake" flavor.  I don't think I will make them again.

Made these today and am SO happy with the results. I followed another reviewer's advice and made a Graham cracker crust instead of the vanilla cookie.  The cups aren't filled to the top but I had enough for 24 easily. I bought 2 bags of the caramel morsels since the bag was smaller than a regular bag of chocolate chips. One bag was enough for 4 inside and 3 on top.  I guess I'll just have to make another batch in the future!!

The flavor was great. However, it got 3 stars for prep. Trying to place 4 of the nestle chips on a Nilla wafer was tedious, and when you finally got them balanced on a rounded cookie, they fall to the side as soon as you place the cheesecake batter on it. I agree the Nilla wafer did nothing for the cheesecake. Next time I will pour the batter in a graham crust and be done. The sea salt was a good edition. I doubled the recipe and still didn't get the said amount of servings, and the cupcake holders were only half full.

I did not care for this recipe. First of all, calling for 2" cupcake liners is blatantly wrong - they are far too big for the wafer cookies - and the standard mini size are too small. If you're going to make this get the 1.75 size (harder to find).   Secondly, the cheesecake itself tastes good but the texture of the vanilla wafer is blah. - really hurts the overall. Thirdly, the caramel taste does not come through well in the mix.   I'm going to try other versions before resorting to this one again

I’ve made this recipe 3 times and it’s always a hit. The caramel delights are not available in Canada but mini Rolo’s substitutes well.

They were really good. The only thing I done was to make my own cherry and blueberry topping because so much cheaper. I would definitely make again.

I made this twice.  The first time it was great.   The second time was actually impossible because the delightfuls were impossible to find.   I even searched on the Nestle website, and it showed one store within 20 miles that had them.  I went to that store, and they are not sold there.   So basically, unless you have the morsels already these are impossible to make.

Really great recipe, except putting the morsels on the wafer. Definitely put the flat side up. Super yummy though!
