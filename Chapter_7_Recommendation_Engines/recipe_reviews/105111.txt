This was yummy, nutritious, and filling. I will make it again. I did add some left over chicken breast but only because my husband loves meat. Without the chicken, it is equally delicious.

I used some homemade turkey broth I had in the freezer.  This soup was both filling and delicious.  I served this with thick slices of whole grain bread for an easy and healthy meal. I'm sure we will make this again.
