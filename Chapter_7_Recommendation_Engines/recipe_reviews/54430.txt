I did not have puff pastry sheets, so I mixed all the filling ingredients in a bowl, then warmed for 10 minutes in a cool (300F) oven.  I divided the filling between two large flour tortillas, and microwaved on high for 35 seconds, and served!  WOW --the flavor was great and the recipe is easy!

This recipe was delicious, however I had some problems with it. Using pastry shells didn't really work, even after rolling out the shells they were way too small. I tried it again and used pastry sheets. I cut the sheets into 4 squares each and folded them to make rectangles there was plenty of filling to make 8 servings.

The filling was good but I think the directions were incomplete. Do you roll out the puff pastry shells? I had enough filling to make 2 boxes of shells if they were rolled out.
