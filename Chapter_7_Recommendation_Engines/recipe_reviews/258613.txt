All in all not a bad recipe just kind of bland. I definitely recommend seasoning it up a bit more.

As you can see from my dish I embellished on the original recipe a bit. Couldn t help myself but the original concept was inspiring and I followed it almost completely to the letter. Besides the embellishments you can see in the skillet I decided to lightly brown the tilapia filets a bit in a little EVOO & butter added a few shrimp premartinated in a little lemon juice a pinch of salt and a touch of crushed red pepper. I then set the fish & shrimp aside. I poured the broth in the same skillet added the orzo and let it cook the prescribed time. Next I added the French cut greens with the tomato. Added the fish n shrimp back in the pan sprinkled in a little oregano a pinch of rosemary the lemon zest and slices and voila. A big hit! Thanks again for the inspiration.
