These are great!  In order to make them crispy I baked them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  I also spread them out so they would individually brown nicely.  Perfect!  I will make this again and again!  Tastes like popcorn vegetables!  (but better than popcorn)
Update: I've lost count how many times I've made this.  I should add that I don't thaw the edamame, but I just mix the ingredients together with the frozen edamame and place them directly into the oven.  That might be why they always turn nice and crispy for me!
UPDATE:  I've lost count how many times I've made this recipe!  I ran out of parchment last night and I decided to add them to a pan coated with Pam.  BIG MISTAKE!  They turned out soggy, sticky and gross!!!  DO NOT baked this on tin foil or directly on the pan.  What a mess!  This probably explains some low ratings on this dish.  ONLY USE A PAN LINED WITH PARCHMENT PAPER:)

I am tired of just steamed Edamame and was happy to find this recipe.  It was good.  I do think it is easier to mix the oil, garlic, and cheese in a large bowl then add the edamame, put a lid or plastic wrap on it and shake it up.  It coats everything better and the cheese doesn't all end up stuck to the baking pan instead of the edamame.  This is also good with fresh green beans, peppers, and/or onion slices.

Wonderful recipe!  I love edamame and run out of ways to prepare them.  I recommend stirring them halfway through to brown them evenly (mine stuck to the pan).  I'll definitely make this again!

I had some problems that other reviewers also mentioned but with some changes would make the recipe much better. After the edamame are thawed I would highly recommend putting them on a towel and patting them dry. When wet they cannot crisp. I had to keep them in the oven for a longer time. I also do not recommend using freshly grated parmesan cheese or increasing the amount then. The edamame did not get coated like in the photo. These changes will greatly help the recipe.

My God these were amazing!!  First bite into them they immediately reminded me of these french fries I used to order at a certain restaurant, with that perfect balance of crispness and chewiness. I only made a half recipe first time around, patted them dry after thawing, used garlic salt, fresh cracked pepper from a pepper mill,  and rest of ingredients on list.  I had to bake mine for around 22-24 minutes instead to get them to crisp up, but thats what made them have the perfect texture.  Will definitely be making these again!

This was our first edamame experience and I'm happy to say it was a very nice one. I did add some garlic and onion powders. The family really enjoyed this side, altho hubby thought he was eating lima beans. Go figure! Thank you Sophia!

I love this idea, but mine didn't get crispy - more like chewy.  But still taste-wise they were excellent!  Made one batch as is, and another I used taco seasoning (wow, was THAT tasty!)  Will play around with cooking temps and times to see if I can get the end result I was hoping for - basically drying them out a bit more so they get some crunch to them.  Thanks for sharing!

okay given that this recipe has a ton of mixed reviews I kinda poked through em and went with my gut. First off I have never cooked with nor eaten edamame so I wasn't sure what to expect. I bought mine a couple weeks ago but they were in the shell so I had to shell them (total pain in the rear buy the already shelled) and were lightly salted which I didn't notice till the last min but thank goodness I did. I cooked them from frozen ( I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and had no problems) with the other ingredients  as directed but left out any salt until I could taste them cooked. I did toss em around on the pan while cooking so the browning would be a little more even. Seems that alotta folks had problems getting them crispy so after they browned I turned the oven off and let it cool for about 10 mins then put the baking sheet back in and let them dry for about 15 more mins ( I did toss em around a few times to make sure they wouldn't get any browner) then let em cool off. Mine turned out crispy and man alive were they a nice munchie snack! BF opted for these over popcorn for a movie. SCORE plus it reminded me to not be afraid of the "unknown" food!

Read some reviews and...rinsed frozen edamame. Patted mostly dry with paper towels. Mixed the oil, garlic, Parmesan, salt and pepper in a bowl first then tossed the edamame until coated. Spread out on a dark cookie sheet with parchment paper. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Turned out perfect the first time!!! Note:   I only  used 8 oz edamame  but all of the remaining ingredients. I wanted to try only half the batch in case it didn't work.

The key is to dry them off before you put oil on them.  I also, mixed the oil with the edamame in a bowl so each bean would be covered.  That could have helped.  These are a fantastic healthy snack!

Very good. Followed others suggestions, added a bit of garlic powder, kosher salt, course pepper, dried them off before cooking. After they finished cooking, I set oven on high broil for the last minute...turned out great!

Crispy Edamame Haiku: "Fail edamame. Tasty soy beans made chewy. I'd rather them steamed." I went w/ many of the reviewers' suggestions and tossed the (well drained, patted dry) edamame in a bag w/ the oil, cheese, s&p. Spread on parchment, and attempting to stir half-way thru resulted in all of the edamame sticking, clumpy cheese, paper tearing, and an oily mess. Salvaged what I could on a fresh piece of wax paper and continued baking, but they never got even remotely crispy. They were OK tasting right out of the oven, but a little while later at room temperature, the texture was terrible and I sadly tossed the rest out. It was fun to try a new way to prepare edamame, but I think that I'll stick to a simple s&p steam.

Living in Japan, edamame are everywhere but I never know how to make them.  This recipe was simple (made to the letter) and so tasty I made it every night until I ran out of beans.  A keeper!

I've recently discovered the joys of roasted vegetables.  More importantly, I've discovered that my kids seem to eat more veggies when I roast them!  They are yummy! So when I found the roasted edamame recipe, it was a no-brainer.  I've tried this recipe twice. The first time was so-so--like many others, I liked the end result but it was more chewy than crispy. The second time, I decided to try "pre-cooking" the edamame a bit in the microwave in the hopes of drying them out a bit to help with the crisping process.  I followed the directions on the bag and, using half the bag, microwaved it covered in plastic wrap for 2 minutes. I then patted the beans dry before coating them in olive oil and garlic salt and pepper.  I roasted in my toaster over for 10 minutes at 400 (without cheese).  I stirred the beans, added an Italian cheese blend (what I had on hand) and roasted for another 10 minutes. The cheese was pretty toasted after 10 minutes, and the beans, for the most part, were crunchy this time.  Still a little chewy, but that's okay with me. I wasn't going for a "dried" type anyway, so these were good for me.  I hate to read where other members threw theirs out because of chewiness. Simply roasting longer would have probably resulted in crunchier beans, albeit maybe burned cheese.  :-/  
You gotta tweak it until it suits you. I'm sure I'll try something a little different next time!

These were not bad, but they never got really crispy. it was more like chewy. Still, a different choice for my friends who are health nuts and vegetarians.

These were very good. I didn't spread mine out far enough for them to get crispy, but they did brown and tasted excellent with just a little melted parm on top.

Mine were not really crispy at all a lil more on the chewy side. But I am still giving a 5 for taste. This is a yummy snack and I added some sprinkled garlic powder in addition to the other ingredients.  I may toss some in a salad. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed a few of the other reviews and added some garlic powder and a light sprinkling of garlic salt to the Parmesan cheese.  I also turned the edamame halfway through.  Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be making again - easy and healthy.

I felt like it needed a touch more flavor and added some sliced garlic and onions.  However, I will definitely be making this again.

Just made it. Patted soybeans dry, tossed in canola oil and dry parmesan cheese, baked for 25 min (flipped halfway by scraping with a spatula) and broiled for a couple of minutes. I also tossed in some bacon slivers at the halfway point. It was crispy and alright (needed salt!) but after you let it cool, it turns hard and chewy. Only make this if you plan to gobble it up right away!

I had never tried edamame until these, and they were pretty good.  I used my frozen ones, and they turned out well.

THE BIGGEST THING TO REMEMBER: THIS RECIPE DOES NOT KEEP SO ONLY MAKE WHAT YOU WILL EAT.  I think that was my biggest problem other than using too much oil and not patting the beans dry enough.  Mine turned out mostly chewy with some crisp and the flavor was okay until I read these reviews and sprinkled garlic powder over the beans.  Then they were fantastic!  My advice would be to not thaw the beans with water or not thaw them at all, use a pan with a cookie sheet, toss the beans with the ingredients including garlic powder in a bowl, and broil them on high for an extra minute after cooking.  Mine were kind of a mess but they tasted really good, the only thing is I made the entire bag and then had to eat all the beans because they were getting soggy and I hate wasting food.  Only make half the bag if you are the only one eating these.  Other than that, I will be trying this again!

'Baking now ... 'Getting ready (preparing food that will spoil once the power is off) for ice storm.  That bag of edamame hasn't been in there forever, but it was long enough to get icy inside the bag.  I rinsed lightly, just enough to get the babies loose.  Put them a la naturel on a foil-lined pan for 15 @ 425.  That dried them better than I could (since I wouldn't ;o).  Poured 'em in a bowl with the T olive oil & with sprinkled granulated garlic & salt.  'Back in the 425 oven for 10, turned down to 400 for 10 more.  'Still took longer to crisp, but good.  For some reason, I wasn't expecting these to brown, which they did, & should.  If they're green, they aren't going to be crispy.  They'll be chewy.  I don't know that I'll make these again, but they're good & I'm glad I made them.

I made this with fresh green beans. I washed and dried them before adding them to a Ziploc bag with the oil, cheese and S&P. This gets every piece coated well. Turned out great. Will make again.

A new way to eat edamames.  I like them raw on a salad so I was excited when I found a way to try them hot.  I'm looking for new ways to add some beans to our diet.  This recipe was very simple to make but yielded a nice flavor.

I just couldn't get these to turn out properly. We wanted to serve them as an appetizer, but wound up using them as a side because we had to eat them with a fork. The cheese made them clump together. Tasty, but not what I wanted.

The taste was there but it turned out really dry. Overall, it was okay. I prefer edamame's steamed or boiled.

These are pretty good, but edamame steamed with salt is good too. These were not as good as I expected. I couldnt get them to crisp, even at 425. They tasted like edamame with cheese.

Baked it about six minutes longer.  Used my Silpat sheet.  This was good.  I expected crispier.  But I would not say it is "chewy".   I think this would be good added to a roasted vegetable dish (like with cauliflower, sweet potatoes, onions, garlic, broccoli, etc).

Followed the ingredients exactly and it was sooooo delicious! These little guys are incredibly addicting and make a yummy salty snack. The only thing was I didn't really thaw the edamame under water like the recipe said...I left it on the counter as I was cooking other things and cooked it for 25 minutes at 400F. Perfect!!! Will be making again!

Just not good.  Dried them, baked them on a parchment sheet lined cookie sheet, stirred them a few times during baking...

Fairly tasteless, dry, not especially crispy.  Tossed most of them in the trash.

Mine turned out looking exactly like the picture, crunchy and all, but they got cold fast and became not so appetizing.    I probably could have salted them more but I thought the parmesan cheese and a little salt would be enough since we are trying to use less salt.   I won't make these again.   I like my edamame hot or cold not lukewarm.

As another reviewer suggested, I used parchment paper and did not thaw the edamame. These were delicious, even my 18 month old that refuses to eat any vegetables loved these! They had more of a french fry texture, not really crispy and soft in the middle.  This is going to be a go to recipe for me!

Hooray for a new way to make edamame and get more vegetarian protein! I thought the recipe was a little bland as written, but will try out different spices. Coating anything with cheese/olive oil/spices and baking it generally seems to turn out well.

These are yummy when they first come out of the oven. I wouldn't recommend refrigerating them for later, though. Unless they come out very crispy, they get soggy.

I cooked the edamame in boiling salted water for 5 minutes first, then shook them dry in a colander, poured them out onto a paper-towel covered sheet pan and let that rest on top of a warm stove for a while. I added some garlic powder to the parmesan cheese and followed the instructions from there. Came out lovely!

Num!  I love Edamame and I love roasted vegetables of any kind but never put the two of those things together until now.  They never got "crispy", but browned nicely, had a great toasty almost popcorn flavor and were a lovely finger food snack.  I used a heavy Circulon cookie sheet that wiped right out after baking, but otherwise I would suggest using parchment like other reviewers suggested.  Next time I think I'll grate the Parmesan coarser (I used the finest microplane zester/grater) just for more distinction and Parmesan-Punch.  The idea of garlic powder is a good one, think I'll do that next time too. I used a somewhat old bag of edamame that were freezer burned a bit and that affected the quality.  Regardless, I enjoyed this snack a lot.

My husband and I always have edamame in the house, but generally just put some salt on it and eat it as is.  This was a great change and it was so easy to do! My husband finished off every bit of it!

Awesomely addictive.  I bought a package of fresh (not frozen) shelled edamame at Trader Joe's and thought I'd try this.  Used the parchment paper on a baking sheet as was suggested by another user.  Baked it for 15 minutes, then stirred it all around and baked for another 15.  Tasty and nice and crispy.  Stored in an airtight container in my fridge, although I doubt they will last.  Probably going back to TJ's this week to get more and make a huge batch!

I made these in my NuWave Oven on the 2" rack. I lined the pan with parchment paper and cooked them for 12 minutes. I use the edamame from Safeway that is individually packaged and frozen. I cooked them in the microwave according to the package directions and patted them dry before adding the seasonings. I also added a pinch of garlic powder and aleppo red pepper flakes. Very tasty. The edamame was more chewy than crispy, but the cheese added a nice crunch!

Easy, quick, few ingredients, delicious taste-- can you ask for more from a recipe without getting greedy? I let these sit under the broiler to get extra crispy after the suggested time/method in this recipe. This is an edamame I'd like to eat again or, as I like to say a EILEA. I hope it catches on.

This is delicious - I had to roast the edamame for a long time to get it crispy though - every 10 minutes I'd give it a stir to keep it rotating. Roast 'til golden brown - the beans will shrink significantly in size, too. Now it's crispy & delicious. A healthier bar snack!

I just finished making this. I thought it was really good with some minor changes. I added garlic powder as others suggested. I would probably add some different seasonings next time as well. I also cooked about 19 minutes and broiled on low for one more minute at the end. I think it's probably best right out of the oven. They weren't super crispy but had a nice texture. Enjoy!

Shook it all together in a covered bowl then baked, came out great.  We usually just eat these with salt so this was a nice change of pace :)

Nice little sidedish. The beans are so delicate and so yummy and so good for you so I was happy to find an easy and delicious was to prepare them. I did heat up the frozen beans a little bit to make shelling them easier.

Never having cooked soybeans previously, It was great!! I did add a few things like fresh roasted sesame seeds, garlic powder, and feta cheese. then covered it all with fresh parmesan.
The parmesan created a crispy crust with the beans embedded. The beans weren't crisp, but  the cheese was!!   Will do this again!!

I used fresh edamame and sprayed with olive oil. I stirred the mix halfway as a reviewer suggested, but the cheese ended up as a lump in the baking pan. The end result is tasty, but not crispy or with a crust.

Edamame never get really crispy in the oven, I dont know if you fry them how they come. They are ike a cross between a soft nut and a bean and they stay sort of chewy. They are delish tho! I have always had them in the shell this is the 1st time pre shelled and I love hem this way too!

Mine didn't get crispy at all and I dried them as other reviewers suggested.  I also had them in the oven quite a bit longer.  We weren't thrilled so I ended up throwing out.  Had they been crispier I'm sure we would have liked them better.

These were good. I put everthing in a bag to toss it together and then spread on a foil lined cookie sheet. Even though they had oil on them the Parm cheese made them stick to the foil pretty bad, so I would  spray the cookie sheet with cooking spray. Also stir halfway through the cooking.

This is an easy-to-make, unique side dish for people who aren't all that familiar with edamame. My family really liked it, even the ones that were hesitant because they thought it was going to "taste like lima beans." I did not cook it until it was crispy. Just cooked it enough until it was warm all the way through and the cheese baked in a little. I'll make this again!

This was a tough one to rate.  I had people who could not get enough and thought they were addictive and others who said they were just ok.  I used a cajun spice for more flavor.  They didn't crisp up like I had hoped.  I think if I make them again I will bake for a longer time, adding the Parmesan cheese after they have gotten crisp.

great alternative and good texture if you cook long enough! I patted the beans dry twice before cooking on tin foil on a cookie sheet.  I mixed in a bowl before placing on sheet : olive oil, garlic powder, pampered chef garlic/peppercorn rub (their asian season would be great as well!), red pepper, onion powder and reduced fat parmesan--cooked 15 min and then an additional 4-5 after stirring

A great snack or side dish.  Just make sure to pat the edamame dry after thawing and try to spread them out in 1 layer in the pan so that they aren't overlapping.  Doing these 2 things makes sure the edamame get nice and crispy.

Easy! Although this 'dish' does not look so appetizing when it is served, it is a great nibbling snack for those who are looking for a low carb alternative to popcorn and chips.

I had a package of frozen edamame to use and had no idea what to do with it (and was not familiar with the ingredient either!) I used this recipe and I am sure the results could have been much tastier had I prepped the edamame better. They stuck to my baking pan (should have used glass?) and didn't crisp very evenly; I may have not used enough olive oil. For the most part the food was scrapped, but I would be willing to try again.

As written, this recipe is missing something. I will take other's suggestions of the parchment paper, garlic powder, and putting the mixings in the bowl before putting in the edamame. Also love the taco seasoning idea. Otherwise, this came out nice. Might keep it in there a few more minutes to get them crispier.

I think this needs a new name. It give the impression that the edamame itself should be crisp but looking at the directions it seems the cheese is only the crisp part. And after baking for 25 min I realized this. I stirred every 5 minutes. I ate these as a snack, grabbing each bean like popcorn. It could easily be cooked a little less as used as a side dish as well. I like this recipe. Will make again, maybe with other veggies too.

We enjoyed this..next time I think I will try Parmesan from the bottle?? I know it isn't as healthy but maybe the edamame will make up for it  :)

To be fair, I don't eat any soy due to digestive issues. I made these for the people I work for and they enjoyed them.  I took 1 bite, hence the 4 star.  The crispy was fine but they were mushy inside, perhaps that is what soy does, I would not know. I also used garlic salt, not regular and plenty of pepper and fresh grated parmesean.

This recipe is fantastic! It's easy to make, and my 3 year old daughter loves it. I use parchment paper and ready to go edamame from Trader Joes. Love it. I'm making it right now as I type.

This was fabulous! I've only had steamed edamame with sushi, so I didn't know it could be so flavorful! Next time I will buy a bag already shelled, even though it didn't take too long to shell them. I rinsed them off and patted them dry with a paper towel before I put olive oil and cheese on them. I used a grated parmesan/garlic blend. They ended up crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved them that way! Will make this again!!

I have to say no one liked it here...  Could be my preperation.  I would prefer to use edamame in stir fries and salads vs this method.

I followed all the tips posted by other users such as pat the edamame dry and turn them halfway through.  I even tried the suggestion someone had of putting them back in to crisp after the oven has been turned off.

They still came out somewhat chewy, so I won't be making this again.

Made this exactly as stated with less olive oil though. I did not use parchment paper, put them right on the baking sheet and they were SOOOO crispy. Not sure why its not working for others. Love these for a low carb, cal snack!

Did not crisp at all. I even used my misto to spray more olive oil on after the 15 minutes, then cooked 10 more minutes. Nothing. They were bone dry too, when I prepared this.

The taste was good, but they weren't crunchy. The bits that stuck to the pan and browned were very crisp, but the rest of the bean wasn't. Maybe I'll try sauteing them in a frying pan next time.

Oh yeah!  I used shelled edamame -- since I buy the big bags at Costco -- and steamed them 3 minutes then shelled them.  I towel-dried them, drizzled a tablespoon of oil on them, and then grated parmesan on top with my rotary grater.  Using my hands, I tossed them with a pinch of kosher salt until they were all coated well.  Then I added more cheese! I didn't measure the cheese, though... I just coated every bean.  Then I cooked them for 10 minutes, stirred them, and five minutes more.  The cheese is super crunchy and delicious.  The bean stays chewy on the inside, so they are like crispy french-fries by comparison.

Second time I made it, but I didn't have any parmesan!  But cheese is the meaning of life so I spread the edamames on the pan/parchment paper and sprinkle and little mozzarella across the top.  Just as good!

I have a new love!  Even my husband loves these.  He is a converted health food nut.  Heart/lung disease requires it, but he's making a happy converter, because I find things that are good!

One suggestion that I have not read, but I didn't read all the comments, is to use *real* fresh grated parmesean cheese, not the powder stuff that one buys in a plastic bottle.  It seems as though buying a chunk of *good* parmesean would be more expensive, but you actually use LESS, because there's so much more flavor in the better cheese.  Also, using less means that you use less fat.  A definite win-win situation.

If you're still using the stuff in the plastic jar, try fresh parmesean.  You'll wonder why that powder stuff is even called 'cheese'.  It's also great on broccoli.

The recipe did not say to dry, just to drain, so I did not dry. I think because of that mine didn't turn out like the picture and I def wouldn't say it was a snack. I would call it a side. That being said it was delicious! I love recipes like this that get me to actually eat something healthy lol. I halved the recipe and used season salt instead of salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Def will make again!

I dried the edamame after draining and put them in a gallon bag with the oil, salt and pepper (I also added some garlic powder) and shook the bag to coat evenly.  I LIGHTLY sprayed a cookie sheet with cooking spray and spread the edamame in a single layer before putting the cheese on top.  After the first 15 minutes of cooking time, I turned them in the pan and cooked for an additional 5 minutes.  They turned out great!  I live in Wisconsin, so next time I am going to try this recipe with a different type of cheese!

Used the toss method to coat the beans.  It's more chewy than crunchy, but I love it.  Used a 4 cheese blend because that's what I had.  I could eat these every day.  Will try stirring midway through to increase crunchy texture, but love it the way it is too.

As others mentioned, mine did not crisp.  However, the flavor was still very good.  If you are looking for a side dish and not a crunchy snack, this recipe is perfect.  I made it as written, using coarse kosher salt, but I may take others suggestions next time and try adding onion powder as a variation.

These are good--more as a side dish than a snack I think.  The name is misleading though.  The edamame doesn't get crispy; the parmesan cheese crust does if you use fresh parmesan.

A different way to eat edamame. I liked it but it was not crispy. They were more chewy but tasty. I was baking something else so I kept the temp at 350 but in reading the other reviews, I don't think it would have made much of a difference. I will definitely make it again.

I had never tried soybeans before.  Did need to cook it a little longer to make it get crispy/just begin to brown.  I eat a lot of healthy things - brussels, etc.

Great recipe! I'm always looking for different ways to make edamame and this was a nice change from the same recipe I make often. I mixed all the ingredients in a large bowl to coat them better and baked in a cookie sheet.

This was fantastic.  I wouldn't change a thing, although I do look forward to experimenting.  My hubby was thoroughly surprised.  I can't wait to make these again!

This recipe is right up my alley.  I love edamame and salty crunchy snacks and to combine the two was a blessed union in this house. I didn't change a thing, might try some different spices next time like crushed red pepper but then again, it was great as is.  Thanks for the idea!

We eat edamame a lot - usually heated in the microwave with coarse salt.  This recipe was so easy and a nice 'spin' on our staple. I have told all of my friends.  Thank you!

These were a bit soggy and not much flavor.  I will go back and read more of the reviews to see if others had a tip or two about this.  I love edamame and am always looking for new ways to prepare them.

This recipe is a great healthy snack for kids that is still super tasty. My 1 year old loves edamame and I've never enjoyed it but this was really good! So we can both enjoy it together.

Great. I've never had edamame before and this was an excellent introduction. Only thing I would change is to buy the beans already shelled and to get a bigger bag! We went through them pretty fast.

This was absolutely delicious! Even my co-worker was impressed. It's a wonderful (and healthier) side dish that complimented my pasta and chicken and it's good for an afternoon or mid-morning snack. I will definitely make it again!

Cooked for the instructed time, took out and put on paper towel to get rid of some grease. Still not crispy, so I put it in the oven for longer - about 20-25min in total. Taste great!

I found this recipe literally halfway through my usual microwave steaming. Took the bag out and prepared as directed but put on tin foil on a cookie sheet. Broiled the last couple minutes. Turned out great and a nice change from steaming. Think partially cooking in microwave took out the chewiness some other reviewers had. Will make again!

I was ok, Would have liked a more toasted edemame and I will add a little punch of seasoning next time. I will make these again but toast the edemames for ~15 minites before I sprinkle with the parmesan. I also used a little more cheese than the recipe called for.

So good! Love edamame. Baked on cookie sheet & used parchment paper. Instead of salt & pepper, used minced garlic & a little of my own version of mixed seasoning (basil, oregano, paprika, onion powder, parsley).
Also, made quick alternative in microwave by first steaming edamame then adding a little margarine instead of oil & adding 
 same seasonings & parmeseasn cheese. Tossed all together in glass bowl & heat in microwave for few minutes. Remove, toss to distribute ingredients & serve. Not crispy as when baked, but quite tasty!

I really really love this. I eat edamame regularly and love it. I have never baked them before. I only had fresh shredded parm so I put it in my Blendtec. It definitely isn't a sign crunchy as I would like but there is a slight crunch. Mostly a similar texture to steaming it. But I really really love it and will be making more.

Made this and absolutely loved it. Made a few adjustments based on other reviews. Thawed and then thoroughly dried the edamame first. Tossed them in the oil first, then added the dry ingredients and tossed in a bowl again. Added an extra 1 tsp each garlic powder and onion powder, and 1/4 tsp each black pepper and red pepper flakes. 15 mins at 400 was perfect , with a stir half way  through. Will definitely make this again

I followed the recipe as written but placed them on parchment paper to roast. They never really got good and crunchy but I like edamame so I still liked the way they were out of the oven. Unfortunately a few hours later they were even softer.  I may  eat them but won't make them again. Oh well.

This is a great little snack or appetizer.  I took it to a family gathering and everyone loved it.  It's better then eating chips or some other greasy option and the taste is still good.  I did put down some parchment paper on the cookie sheet like another poster said and I think it's a great idea.  It makes clean up easy and it makes it really easy to just fold up the paper and pour into a dish when ready to eat.

I followed the recipe. Since I wanted them to be a snack while watching TV, I used more salt and bake them in the oven for 25 minutes, turning and shaking them after 15 minutes until  little crunching under the tooth. Taste great.

These were very good.  As another reviewer suggested, I put the FROZEN edamame in a container dumped in the other ingredients, shook it up and spread them out on parchment paper on a baking sheet.  They were good and crispy!!

I guess I was expecting it to be a little "crispier", but it seemed like a really bland recipe.  Not sure how I would change it to make it better, but it stayed chewy.  Maybe stick it under the broiler for a bit?

I made this recipe and mine turned out chewy.  I loved the taste,  but will have to adjust the timing and temp for my oven.  Will make again for sure!

I had fresh edamame to use, so tried this recipe.  The kids and I thought it was pretty good.  I did add garlic salt, and needed to cook it far longer - about half an hour, I think. I stirred it several times.  They were still quite wet at 15 minutes, but eventually the cheese did get crispy.  I think it would work better on an 11x7 baking pan.

It took 30 minutes and was a fun new way to eat edamame, but nothing special.

I wanted to love these, but well, they were just okay. I tried drying them off before putting them in the oven, but they still came out a bit dry, chewy, and flavorless. You'd think there would be more cheese flavor, but it just wasn't there. I'm not sure what would make this work for me, so I think I'll keep looking for edamame recipes. Thanks, though!

Wow! If everything healthy tasted this good, I would never eat junk food again.  What a great recipe.

I thought this was fairly good, 3 or 4 stars, but my husband didn't like it at all.  He hated the parmesan combo, which I thought was nice!  I LOVED how this dish made the house smell great while baking, I guess it was the olive oil and parmesan.  I did take other reviewers' advice to mix everything up in a bowl (I used about 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan, and shakes of salt, pepper, and garlic powder) and spread flat in a pan and stir half way through baking.  The dish has a nutty taste, got nice and browned and crispy, and was very filling.  And I was pleased to find that the leftovers microwaved quickly and were just as yummy.  I will make this again for myself, but my husband won't eat it. You'll have to try it for yourself and see what you think.

These are great. The second time I made this, I mixed in some green beans and added some fresh ground pepper.  I used freshly grated romano and no salt at all. Easy and delicious.

These are WONDERFUL! What a pleasant change from just plain edamame. My daughters loved them as well! Thanks!
