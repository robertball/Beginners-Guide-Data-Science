This was my first time making cheesecake. Definitely add the vanilla like it says - I didnt have any, so mine tasted a little too cheesy. Also if you cant find dulce de leche you can make your own. Take a can of sweet condensed milk, take the label out and put the can in a pan. Cover with water and boil for 45min-1hr. Wait for the can to cool before you open it.  It comes out dulce de leche. The longer you boil the can, the thicker the dulce de leche, so I do about 1hr to get a little thicker. This recipe was great, I'll make it again soon :)

I made this as a Easter dessert for my Dad and Grandma who are both diabetic. Everyone enjoyed it. I only have three pieces left. To reduce the sugar count farther, I used sugar free shortbread cookies crushed for the crust instead of graham cracker crumbs. This worked great. I also lined the bottom of my pan with a parchment paper circle. That way I could take the cake off the the base and put it on a fancy serving plate.

I made this for my daughter's 12th birthday. My 3 year-old was recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and she insisted she did NOT want birthday cake as Blake would have to scrape off the icing ... she is so sweet and concerned about her baby brother. So, I went searching for a low-fat cheesecake, and found this one. Anyway, I followed the recipe to a tee and it was WONDERFUL. I used my Pampered Chef springform pan set that I have had for 2 years and had never gotten out of the box - WOW. The recipe was awesome, the clean-up was easy, and everyone thought it tasted just like cheesecake (my goal!). And, since it is reduced fat and lower in carbs, my son got a normal-sized piece of cake like everyone else. I will be adding this recipe to our family favorites.  NOTE:  The Dulce de Leche milk is with the Mexican (salsa, etc.) stuff at our Albertson's. It is pricey - $2.99 a can, but you could make two cheesecakes out of one can.

Very good and creamy consistency.  I took out about a half a cup and sprinkled in some strawberry cool aid and marbled it in then topped it off with splenda sweetened sliced strawberries.

Great recipe, very nice flavor. The only thing I would change is to add a pan of water in the bottom of the oven while it is pre-heating, and then once the baking is done, turn off the heat and crack the door open for 1 hour. This will aid in keeping the cake from cracking.

This cheesecake was great!  This cheesecake, (unlike most others) was simple and not too time consuming.  I made it for our "Saturday Night Dinner" dessert and everyone enjoyed it.  It is rich and had a strond caramel flavor so beware if you don't like that.  Instead of using the brand name that is on the recipe, for the dulce de leche flavor, you can use vanilla caramel Coffee Mate.  Although it is expensive ($4.99) for the smaill amount used in the cheesecake, it does taste good in coffee, hot chocolate, etc.  Overall this was very good and will be made again.

I make this whenever I have friends over. I have also made this using sugar free chocolate chips instead of the dulce de leche and using sugar free oreo cookies for the crust and it is great!

I made this recipe awhile back for my DH family, everyone loved it!  I think I am going to be evil this time around though and use real sugar instead of the Splenda. Which I have used to make chocolate cheesecake with, other chocolate items as well. Oh my gosh it was nasty! I don't mind using splenda every now and then, but not ever mixed with chocolate again! I am going to make this recipe tomorrow for Valentines Day (since my DH doesn't care for chocolate, what a sin!! haha)

Excellent diet cheesecake! Smooth, creamy, sweet, and no chemical after-taste.
