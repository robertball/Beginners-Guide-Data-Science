This recipe tasted exactly like the Pecan Delight pie from Piccadilly Cafeteria that I love (and crave) so much. It was also extremely easy to make.

This is absolutely delicious, and has the added bonus of being pretty lowfat. It's also extremely easy to make.

Best pie ever! Perfect amount of sweetness and is awesome with grated chocolate on top. I've made so many of the highest rated and most popular desserts from this site and this is the favorite! My husband had this recipe years ago but we unfortunately lost it so we were excited to find it here. I have to say it's really surprising to me that it isn't wildly popular. Thanks for posting a favorite! Make this pie, you'll be happy you did!

I upgraded this recipe by using organic ingredients, toasting the pecans first, scanting the sugar, and upping the vanilla to a tablespoon..

I found that using a bit of organic whipping cream with non-fat Greek yogurt counter-balanced the sugar in the recipe, and the fats in the nuts. I also like it with toasted walnuts, which add omega-3s.

This was good, a little on the too-sweet side but we also had it without the whipped topping so maybe that would have helped.
