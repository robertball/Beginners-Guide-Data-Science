Ok if I had extra thumbs I would be holding them ALL up for this recipe. It was so good. I did just a couple things differently though. I sliced my zucchini instead of halving it and then I layered everything like a casserole and added the cheese for the last 5 minutes of cooking. I served it over penne pasta and topped it with parmesan cheese.  I also seasoned my meat while I browned it which the recipe didn't call for. A little salt, pepper, basil, garlic and oregano.

I made this the other night with some of my suuuper huge zucchini, with mostly successful results.  I think I cut the slices too thick, so they were a bit "al dente," which was fine with me but not universally "well received..."  I decided to go more pseudo-Italian style vs. Mexican, so I spiced up the turkey with plenty of garlic, chopped onion and Italian seasoning, left out the corn, and sprinkled a part-skim mozzarella blend on top, rather than the Mx. cheese blend.  Quick, easy, and with some quick fixes, a healthy hit!!

Layered each ingred.  Easy to pour off extra liquid when zucchini cooks down. 
Zucchini and Onions, Spicy Italian Sausage, Tomatoes and Basil Sauce cover with foil to heat.
Then add Cheese just to melt and brown.

I used a giant zucchini from the garden.  I didn't have corn but i added bread crumbs and parmesan and served it over noodles.  Yum Yum!
