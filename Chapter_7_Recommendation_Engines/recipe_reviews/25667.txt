Very, very good and easy! I made a few adjustments. Instead of clam juice, I used Better than Bouillon clam base and water(hard to find, but fabulous). Then I skipped the salt. I whisked in a brick of low-fat cream cheese (softened, in pieces) just after the first boil. I skipped the cream and added milk instead. I added the cayenne bit by bit, and tasted after each addition. My husband ate two big bowls. I had one, he's taking a bowl to work today and tomorrow--that's all we have left! Fabulous! I'll make this again for sure!

This is one for the Hall of Fame!  I can't imagine doing anything to make it better.  Obviously, those that prefer more of a kick should add more cayenne pepper after tasting.  For me, the kick was perfect; just enough to to let one know that it's "there," but not so strong as to be overwhelming.  For those that might not be familiar with this style soup, it is similar to clam chowder--but with nuance of it's own.  Five stars if ever there was a five-star soup!

Delicious!  Because I prefer items to just be mildly spiced, I only used 1/8 tsp. of cayenne, which was just mildly tangy and much to my liking compared to a spicier soup.  I also reduced the salt by half.  Very easy to make.  I had several bowls at one sitting because it was so delicious!

Excellent and memorable.  Hubs preferred I sub celery for the white corn and it proved to be a surprisingly delicious substitute. Also, rather than the cayenne, white pepper and thyme, I simply used a Cajun seasoning to taste. I used pasteurized, lump crab meat. This comes together quickly, uses simple ingredients and really delivers - this is a rich, velvety smooth,  creamy and distinctly seafood flavored soup, decadently delicious with big chunks of crab. Exquisite.

Served this last night for a dinner party and everybody thought I'd slaved all day...definitely the hit of the party.  I made it exactly as instructed and everything turned out great!  Definitely a keeper for my recipe box.

As I was making this for the party and had lots of other food prep work to do, I took this recipe through step 1 several hours ahead of time, transfering the simmered mixture to a slow cooker on low to keep it hot.  Added the crab meat, onions and cream just before the guests arrived.

Couldn't be happier.  Thanks!

This recipe made me a big star! I followed the recipe to the letter and was very happy with the results. It is a very rich, gourmet tasting soup. I served it with bread and salad. I used 2 different kinds of lump crab meat - a cheaper brand and a more expensive brand. My advice? Definitely spring for the more expensive crab because it's firmer and fresher...you CAN taste the difference.

This soup was very good, with just the right amount of spice.  My only complaint is that it was a little TOO rich and I think next time I'll substitute some of the cream for half and half or just milk.  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

I made this for our Progressive Dinner Party and it was delicious! I was a little nervous because our friends are such great cooks. Everyone wanted the recipe. I took the advise and made the base before hand, then added the cream and crabmeat right before serving.

Simply outstanding!  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and shredded imitation crab in the food processor.  This will definately be in our regular rotation in addition to a special occasion treat for company.

My wife made this for me last night and it was great. Spicy. She pureed the crab with the cream prior to adding it to the pot - made for a very creamy soup. Was great with the Southwestern Flatbread she served with it. Thanks.

Very tasty soup.  I used 1 cup of light cream and 2 tblsp of butter to make it a little less fattening and it came out great.  I also used a can of mexicorn instead of frozen corn.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup is so good that a fifty gallon drum should be considered a single serving.  I'm glad it is easy to make so I'll have it often.

You will not find a better Cajun crab soup recipe that is this quick ‘n easy!   I have an authentic Cajun soup recipe that uses a ton of different ingredients and is way more involved and I can honestly say that this recipe would give mine a run for its money.

As my wife and I are both dieting, I decided to make a low cal version. I left out the flour and heavy cream, instead using 2 peeled and diced russet potatoes, which I cooked in the broth/clam juice instead of the corn. Cooked the corn separately, but drained the cooking liquid into the soup for flavor. Also, since I am the only one in the family who likes spicy food, I substituted a teaspoon and a half of Creole seasoning for the salt and cayenne. When the potatoes were done, I pureed the soup in a blender, prior to adding the corn, crab and scallions. Worked like a champ, resulting in a tasty crab chowder. Saved 180 calories and 20g fat per serving, though it is slightly higher in carbs (18.4g). Next time, I’ll halve the butter as well, which should lower cals and fat even more.

If you want a 5 star result, better use real cream instead of half and half.  It is still good with the half and half, but it loses something.  Very easy to make and hits the spot on a cold day.  Served with a nice french bread it makes a hearty meal.

Didn't know what to expect when I made this, but was pleasantly surprised.  Boyfriend and I both loved this.  Used a can of cream style corn instead of frozen, and added 2 small yukon gold potatoes.  Also since it's crab season, I put in half fresh crab meat, and half canned.  Everything turned out wonderful.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

Not sure what I was expecting but this didn't really meet my expectations.

I followed the recipe, but the soup didn't seem to have much flavor and for me, the corn seemed out of place. I guess that I was looking for a creamier type of soup without the crunch of corn.

Also, the soup was too thin and watery. I prefer a little more thickness in a cream soup.

Great and simple. I used a bit less butter than called for and milk instead of heavy cream.  It was still superbly rich and creamy. Next time I will try to halve the butter and see if I can get away with saving a few more calories/grams of fat.  Also, at the end once I took it off the stove, I added a splash of champagne vinegar to take it up a notch. YUM

This was really good.  I used milk instead of cream and was happy I did because this soup was really rich.  I used canned crab and was happy with the results.  I did add extra cayenne and added a small diced potato.  I will make this again.  And lastly I used 1 3/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup sherry because I didn't have any clam juice and was worried about this recipe being too fishy.  I will make again.

Next to my chicken apple curry soup, this is by far the best soup I have ever done and enjoyed. Mind you that I accidently doubled the cayen so it was a bit spicy. But nonetheless excuisite!!!

One of the best soups I have ever made!  To cut the richness a bit I used less butter and light cream. I also used a bit of chipotle pepper in place of cayenne. I can't wait to serve it to guests.

Wow. This was awesome. Easy too. But I did deviate from the recipe, sorry Doreen. I bought the crab a couple days ago with the intent of making this recipe. School has slacked off a great deal and I decided to get back into body building after I bought what I needed. ALready started my diet so I did this a lil more body fat friendly. I used margarine, fat free half and half and low sodium/fat chicken broth. I realize I lose alot of the richness of the soup but, i need to lose my love handles more so i tweaked it. It still tastes awesome. Also used wheat flour, almost forgot. Now I wont feel so guilty eating it. It'll be a while before i make it again b/c of the ........diet :( but this is most definitely a keeper and Doreen if you have anymore feel free to share em!

Low fat version - I substituted no fat half&half for the cream and it was excellent. To further cut the fat content I will reduce the margerine to 1/2 the amount called for in the recipe next time I make it. This is a fantastic, rich, spicy soup.

WOW!!!  This recipe is fantastic!  I used my hand blender and pureed 1/2 the amount which made for just the right combination of chunky and smooth.  The leftovers were even better after all the flavors made really blended together.  Not too "fishy" at all for those of you like my husband who are scared away by that thought.  Thanks!

A delectable rich and creamy soup. We cut the butter to 1/4 cup, upped the garlic to 3 cloves, and used a heaping 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. We used the entire 16 ounce package of frozen white corn. This worked out perfectly, and one of the better soups we’ve enjoyed from this site.

It's delicious! I agree, the only setback is that it's too rich. So what I did was reduced the cream to under 1 1/2 cups and add about 1/2 cup of white wine. You won't believe the improvement to the soup till you've tried it!! This is going to be my all time favourite soup!!!

Husband actually ate this, so that is a high review.  He doesn't really like crab but he liked it a lot.  Next time I would add more cayenne.

This soup was excellent.  I made a couple changes.  I added 3 diced baking potatoes to the broth and cooked them until tender.  I added 1 cup water plus 2 chicken boullion cubes.  And also substituted one can fat free evaporated milk for the cream.  Will definetely make again.  It is very spicy.

I made a couple variations to this recipe; I added 1/2 lb. of bay scallops, 1/2 lb. salad shrimp, and 1/2 lb. lobster and extra cream to make it more of a chowder. OMG it turned out SOOOO good!!! My father-in-law owns a Bed & Breakfast and he is a fabulous cook, but when I presented this as part of his seafood themed birthday dinner, he was begging to get the recipe from me! Thank you for this great recipe!!!

This was definitely not my favorite recipe or soup.  The fish taste was a little too strong for me.  That was probably due to the clam juice so I would probably use less of that and more milk next time.  But honestly there probably won't be a next time.  Sorry!

Very good soup. I had some leftover white corn on the cob to use, so I hunted this one down (I'm just dumb enough to spend $25 on crab in order to salvage $2 worth of corn, haha). I added more spice to this and cut the cream back to 1 cup. Great texture, and very rich! Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was superb! I used half and half in place of the heavy cream and I can't see any reason why you would need to make it with the cream. In fact, I don't think all of the butter is necessary either. I would probably cut it in half next time. Other than that, everything was perfect as is. We loved it and will definitely make again!

5 stars but with my adjustments. I also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 to cut down on the calories, but to keep it thick I only used 1/2 the amount of chicken broth. Excellent amount of spices because they didn't over power the flavor of the crab, but calling it "cajun" leaves a little to the imagination.  Not really "hot" enough to do that.

I also take an extra crab, cut it into 6 pieces (in shell).  Then add it to the soup for a nicer look and for a little more crab flavour.  I also like to increase the amount of corn and onion.

EASY recipe with a lot of flavor!  Everyone at our Christmas dinner loved it, even my VERY finicky nephew!  Don't cook too far in advance.  It should be ready when you are sitting down to dinner.  It would be a great start to a Crab Chowder; just add potatoes and celery!

DH and I were really disappointed with this recipe.  It looked and smelled so good while cooking.  But the flavor of the onions was overwhelming.  Will keep looking for a crab soup recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe. For those who can't afford real crab meat, imitation works well here. I only used 1 cup of clam juice, and instead of cream I used 1 cup milk with 5 Tbs. butter melted in it, also 1 tub 8oz. cooking cream cheese. I loved it. Thanks

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I just finished making this and omg, it is delicious.  Next time I think I'll add potatoes to it and add cayanne pepper last just because it was bit spicy for my 5yr old.  Other than that it was great!

Amazing soup! I did not add the onion and used 4 cloves of garlic. Also used chicken stock and only one cup of cream.

I followed this recipe exactly for a Christmas dinner party for 8 people.  This soup was the main course so I doubled the recipe.  It was a big hit and very, very easy to make.  It made me look like a star!

this was really good. i think i like the salmon chowder (replace salmon w/ a lighter fish and crab) by KENULIA a little bit better than this recipe.  if i could combine the two, that would be perfect. the crab and cream from this recipe and the seasonings, celery, and red potatoes from the other.  this was great. thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful, quick and easy! The main changes I made just suit my tastes - used creamed white corn and no fat cream cheese instead of heavy cream to cut the fat a bit. Used cornstarch instead of flour (smoother) and all chicken broth. Added some Old Bay for spice. Excellent for dinner, filling and rich. Reheated very well.

This recipe just didn't do it for me.  I think it is because unfortunately I tasted a rather delicious She-Crab soup in the Atlanta area and was hoping that I would find something that came close, but this just wasn't my style.  I might be good to those who go in without a specific taste in mind for crab soup, but I on the other hand will look for a recipe closer to what I have in mind.

Followed the recipe and used it for a starter at a buffet dinner for 35 people (tripled the amount on the recipe).  Everyone loved it!  Even someone who is allergic to crab had to try it because everyone was raving about.  I was nervous because I never made a cream based soup...but it was successful! Will make it again and again.

Pretty good base recipe.  I added a couple diced yukon gold's and used whole milk because I didn't have cream.  I found the end result pretty plain so I added 3 or 4 teaspoons of Old Bay, a little extra cayenne and the crab liquid.  After his first bite my husband said "Gordon Ramsay would approve" hahaha :) I also served this with crusty french bread. Yum! Thanks for the recipe... one of the only soup recipes my husband has liked.

Awesome! My mother was actually jealous of how well this turned out because it was apparently better then the kind she makes! The only thing I changed was adding some old bay to taste, other then that this was a HUGE hit!

Overall excellent; I think I will thicken it a little more next time.  Good with a splash of sherry on the top.  Just enough heat.

We love spicy foods, especially soups and this one is a winner.   I am watching my fat and calories so I substitued 8oz. of lite cream cheese and 1 1/2 Cups Lowfat milk for the heavy cream.  I also used 1/2 the salt and twice the cayenne pepper.   We loved it.  It wasn't as heavy as a similar soup I have tasted.   Very Tasty!   I will definitely fix this one again.

Oh my GOSH!  This was fantastic!!!  My friend made it and brought it to our group to try out.  Everyone RAVED about it!  I think the only thing she shanged was to use yellow corn.  It gave it a nice color so when I make it, I intend to do the same.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

With all the great reviews, I was surprised by how boring this soup was. The taste of onions and seasoning overwhelmed the corn and crab. It had good texture, but the flavor was just not very good. We won't be making this again.

A surprisingly good and hearty soup!  I've made this several times and have gotten huge compliments.  Definitely spring for the real crab, the imitation stuff takes away from all the great flavor.  I love to eat spicy foods but my guy is sort of a wuss when it comes to spiciness.  I've found that adding a dash of cayenne and mixing it in my own bowl is just as good, actually gives it quite the kick!  I've made it with both half and half and heavy cream, doesn't seem to be that much of a difference, so when trying to cut out calories, definitely go with the half and half.  Serve with garlic Texas toast and you've got a meal that will definitely impress your guest!  (Tastes even better the next day because the flavors have gotten a chance to mesh)

Great recipe. I made a few adjustments based on preference.  I used lowfat half and half and only a tablespoon of butter to cut down the calories.  I also only used 1 cup of the clam juice b/c that's all I bought at the store - as it turned out it was better that way b/c it would have been to "clammy" for my taste other wise. I also cut back on the amount of chicken broth to make it a bit thicker.  I followed another's suggestion of using white crab meat and lump crab, and next time I will definitely use all lump crab meat - I didn't like the shredded crab meat.  Overall great recipe.

I have made this several times now and it is just easy and very flavorful. I passed it on to a friend and she forgot the thyme. It really does need to have it. Enjoy.

This was a very good recipe, tasted like something you'd order at a restaurant.  I did use less salt, cayenne, added white wine and sauteed celery, and substituted half the heavy cream for milk and extra flour.

Fantastic and so easy to make!  I only had 1 cup of clam juice so I used a little of the juice from my cans of crabmeat and then topped it off with more chicken broth.  If you have people that really dislike spicy foods, I would cut back a little on the cayenne pepper - just the 1/4 tsp. was surprisingly hot.  Thanks for a great recipe, Doreen.

Easy and delicious recipe!  I added celery, sauteeing along with the onions and garlic.  I also added a splash of dry white wine and a chicken bouillon cube to add a little more flavor.  I will definitely make flavorful treat again soon!

I would give this 10 stars if I could. To die for. I just made a batch of this soup for dinner. I had to try it and its just so delicious. I used 3 (6 oz.) cans of lump crabmeat and I also used Land o Lakes fat free 1/2 and 1/2 as another reviewer suggested. Perfect results. Loved the slight kick from the cayenne pepper and green onions. Will make again very soon. Thanks Doreen!!

Because my husband's on a low cholesterol diet, I made two substitutions:  I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of butter and Land of Lake Non-Fat Half & Half instead of heavy cream.  The result was wonderful!

Sorry, way too salty for me.  Followed the recipe exactly except for adding a bit more garlic.  Husband ate it over rice to cut the salty flavor and said it was ok like that, but I don't think I'll make again.

My family really enjoyed this soup. My husband thought it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and used a good brand of canned crabmeat. However, to me it really had that "canned" taste so I rated it four stars. I would definitely make this soup again but will use king crab legs and extract the meat.

AWESOME!  The soup was excellent.  Next time I'm going to cut back on the cayanne to 1/8 ts.  My wife does not like things too hot.  The second day the pepper seemed to mello though.  For a little thicker soup use 1/3 cup flour.  Big time keeper.  Thanks.

This was such a simple recipe, I subsituted evaporated milk for l 1/2 cups and half and half 1/2 cup.  My husband couldn't stop commenting how good it was. I served it with salad and marble bread.

I thought this was great. I didn't have crab so used lobster instead.  The only change I might suggest would be to add potato.  Great recipe and am sooooo happy I have leftovers (not for long).

This one is a winner. Made it exactly as per the recipe with one addition. I added one teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning to really accent the Creole.

This is an EXCELLENT soup! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used less butter, (about 1/4 cup). I also used seafood stock instead of chicken stock. I realized that I bought an 8oz bottle of clam juice so I ended up using 1 cup of clam and 3 cups of stock. I also used about 1.5 cups of half and half instead of cream. I used a little more crab (one 16oz can). I spiced exactly as the recipe called for and it was AMAZING! It's spicy and creamy but not too rich!

Quick, easy and delicious! I followed the sage advice of Naples when I subbed celery for the corn--I didn't realize ahead of time that I didn't have any corn on hand! So I appreciated the recommended substitution! The celery was a great addition; though, I still would've added corn if I had it. I also chose to use a nice Cajun seasoning instead of the spices listed in the recipe. Looking forward to a tasty lunch tomorrow!

Smelled great but it fell short on apetizing due to it's far overbearing spice.  I'm not certain if it was from the onion, or the spices but I couldn't see how anyone could devour more than a half serving of this.  Complete shame because I think this could be really good

Absolutely fantastic as-is!  I used the fake crabmeat for my first try, and it came out FANTASTIC.  I cannot wait to try it with the real stuff!  Not for the calorie counter!  I may try to lighten it up a bit in the future so I don't feel as guilty eating it :)

My family loves spicy food, so I doubled the amount of white pepper and cayenne pepper.  I also took up the suggestions of a couple reviewers and substituted the heavy cream with milk and added 1/4 cup of sherry and 1/2 tsp of paprika. One final change that I made was adding just 1 cup of clam juice instead of 2.  Overall, it was really good and simple to make; I would definitely make it again.

Amazing soup. I'm not really that into crab but I definitely enjoyed it. For those on a budget, I used the cheapest refrigerated crab I found ($5.99 for 8oz as opposed to $18 fresh) and it still tasted amazing (including to those who enjoy crab more than myself!) Only changes I made: I added a tablespoon and half of extra flour for added thickness and I accidentally spilled a lot of extra cayenne in. I simply added a little extra chicken broth to balance it out. Tasted great and a VERY forgiving recipe. Thank you!

Great soup!  Followed the recipe nearly to a tee, but used LF half and half instead of heavy cream.  Will definitely make again for the extended family! *Addition* I did make this soup again, but used salmon.  I thought I had enough crab, but oops, the salmon was just as great in this recipe.

Very tasty,although I had to use canned corn and frozen lobster meat; I also reduced the amount of cayenne to a mere dash, substituted the hot sauce (didn´t have any) for Liquid Smoke  and poached the green onions with the onion and garlic at the beginning. Served it as a first course of a creole/cajun  dinner and was a huge success. Will certainly make again

I guess with all of the rave reviews, and being a huge fan of Phillips crab house soup, I was expecting more out of this it. For us it wasn't thick enough, and I would hardly call it cajun as we also found it was a pretty bland. It was OK, but no one in my household is in any hurry to have it again.. I did like the base flavor of the "stock" and I plan to build off of that to make my own recipe.

Wow...possibly our new favorite!  Mine came out a little thinner than we like, so next time I'll add an extra tablespoon or two flour.  I also used 1/2 the salt since I used salted butter and it was perfect for us.

This soup is simple to make and fabulous!! I made this for my boyfriend's family and everyone raved about it.FYI..I used the lump crab meat, not the shredded crab meat. I also bought crab legs to add extra meat. I will definitely make this again and again.

Wow 5 stars all the way!! This was a wonderful easy soup. I made the base earlier in the day. Then before my party I put it in the crock-pot to heat up. I then warmed up the cream in the microwave and added it and the crab an hour before serving. It was perfect! I used the more expensive (but well worth it) lump crab that needs to be kept refrigerated. I don't think that canned crab would work well for this recipe, spring for the good stuff!  The heat level was just perfect. Just enough to know that it is there without bowling you over. You must try this soup.

This recipe is awesome.  Friends came over and we made it.  It was a huge hit. 
I shared the leftovers with co-workers and they asked for the recipe.

This was amazing.  In fact, it's been about a year since I made it but I still remember it well.  My husband asks for it all the time and to tell you the truth, I don't know why I haven't made it again.  I think it's time I do.

Made this exactly as written EXCEPT for using 1 can lump crabmeat and 1 (cheaper) can all-white crabmeat.

It looked and smelled wonderful the whole time, and was nice and warm going down. Not too spicy at all. Looking forward to the leftovers, and I NEVER look forward to leftovers!

Awesome, and easy to make. Just a few random comments: very expensive to buy the ingredients. I would love to make it again, if I could afford the lump crab! Also, it took me forever to find clam juice at the store, but it totally makes the soup. Lastly, I used milk instead of cream and it was plenty rich.

Great soup, but I don't think that it can be called Cajun -- not enough spices in my book, but that's easily adjusted.

Very tasty recipe. We usually substitute chicken broth in place of the clam juice (can be expensive where we live). Tastes great either way.

YUMMY!  The only changes I made were:  added more corn, more than doubled the garlic & the cayenne (we like it spicy!).  One of the best soup recipes I've tried!  Thanks!

This is by far the best soup recipe I have found!  I even made it for Christmas Eve last year.  I substituted half of the cream for fat free half and half.  Very good!  Great with focaccia bread.  I also added a little extra cayenne... for those of you who like it pretty spicey.

This soup was just fabulous, very tasty.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the expense and the FAT content.  You could go broke buying all the crab, and gain 2lbs just eating 1 bowl!  I added some jumbo shrimp, and these were great.  I'll definitely make this again, but use only milk and make it only for a special occasion.

This is a super recipe.  The soup is rich and delicious with a nice touch of heat from the cayenne pepper.  I've also made this using finely chopped imitation crab meat and was pleased with the results.

I made this in a high school cooking class and loved it. I searched for it and was so happy to finally find it. now I've been making it for years. I've never changed anything only added stuff. not sure if it matters but I use salted butter because we rarely have unsalted. and my husband loves putting mushrooms in there I just cook them when I cook the onions. it's definitely one of the households favorite. We can't find a can of soup that could take any better.

Yum! I messed up and only had one cup of clam juice so had to use an extra cup of chicken broth. It was probably not as flavorful as it should have been but we still loved it. I will definitely be making this again (with the correct amount of clam juice). Thank you for sharing!

Hit the spot on a cold snowy day! Quick and easy, savory crab soup with a bit of heat. Only had 1 cup of clam juice so I added an extra cup of chicken stock. It still was delish. We all enjoyed it so I'll definitely make again.

Made this soup back in the day, but never reviewed it. Shame. My girlfriend at the time labeled me "the man" with this recipe and always asked for it when we had our at-home date nights. For those who change this recipe, then rate it, you are rating your own recipe. Stop it. Give the recipe a chance, than rate it as such. It was 5 stars to me!

This was a great recipe however I added more seasonings to make it more flavorful.  I looked at Karyn's crab soup recipe on this site and added dry mustard, 1 t Old Bay and celery seed. I used salted butter and cut the added salt in half. Also added a T of dry sherry.  I took it to a dinner party as the starter and everyone raved about it.  I heard one woman who had just returned from Charleston SC tell her husband it was better than the soup they had there.  High praise.  Will make again for sure. I deducted a point because I fiddled with the spices.

This soup was delicious. The only thing I did differently was add cubed potatoes to make it more hearty. It was a huge hit. My husband even loved it and he is Mr. "It's Ok but it's missing something". Will definitely make this again. Made it in the morning on the stove but moved it to the crockpot and kept it warm all day

I made the recipe as listed and my family LOVES it!!! We tend to like a lot of crab and we also add in some clams to make it thick... Most definitely a keeper!

Very yummy! I used half and half in place of the cream, as another had suggested.  Next time I will try it with less butter, maybe 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. I will use the whole 16 oz bag of white corn (I couldn't find it in a smaller quantity at my local store).  Fresh thyme instead of dried would be delish!  Family loved this, served with french baguette for dipping. Looking forward to eating this again:-)

Made just like recipe but I used imitation crab since 1 lb of crab was 30 bucks!  It is very yummy...just spicy enough. I am sure real crab would have been better but for 1/4 the price it was fantastic.

Great soup base but not quite right for me and my family. I used a high end can of lump crab meat and canned crab seems too crabby/fishy tasting for this recipe in my opinion. A pound seemed like way too much. Fresh mild tasting crab would have been ideal but I wouldn't pay for fresh crab for this recipe. Next time I think I'll use this soup base (minus the green onions again) and add some potatoes and chopped clams instead of the crab. I'll give this one a few more tries with some changes and maybe a different brand of crab meat and see what happens.

I liked cooking this dish. It was easy, and delicious. Next time I cook it I'm going to add chicken and potatoes though. I think I'd like to make it a little hardier. I also added a little chopped cilantro when serving and it was a great last minute touch.

This is so good. Thank you so much for this recipe!  I made it just as described except I cut down the amounts. (There is only two of us).  I did add celery too b/c I like the crunch.  Will definitely keep this in my box for sure!

Loved this soup. I made it with freshly caught dungeness crab from our own crab pots. Perfect. I added a dash of sherry. Fantastic.

so very tasty.  I doubled the cayenne, as we like it on the spicy side.  The only thing that I think I would do differently next time is to add some celery.

Excellent! I wouldn't change a thing.  It's easy to make and has a really good flavor.  Added a little extra cayenne, because I like my food spicy.  I wasn't sure how the corn would taste in the soup, but it was so good.  Will definitely be making again!

I love this dish! I rated it 4 stars because of it's outrageous fat and caloric content. I will definitely make this again, but with about 1/4 of the amount of butter and half of the cream but use milk instead. The amount of oil on the top is enough to have an EMT standing by.
 
Be advised and try to cut it back, other than that the soup is superb.

This was delicious.  Followed the recipe to the letter except for the addition of some shrimp as well.  I agree with the hubby that said this is the best soup he ever tasted!

Another hit at my soup and stew party!  I really liked the blending of flavors.  Many thought it was very similar to a clam chowder.  It has just the right amount of spice and heat to give it some zip but not to overwhelm.

Decent recipe - not going to be a family favorite, but worth having from time to time.
