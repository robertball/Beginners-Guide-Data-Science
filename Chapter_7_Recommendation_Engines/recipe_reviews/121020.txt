Nice twist on the traditional banana bread!  I did make a couple of modifications:  Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp baking powder, also used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Came out perfectly moist and tasty! Will make this again for sure!

FABULOUS!  Used frozen raspberries and they worked great...just threw them in while they were still frozen... don't forget to change the baking soda to BAKING POWDER!

Excellent!  I make banana bread quite often and never would have thought to throw raspberries in there, but I was looking for something to do with all of the raspberries my boys and I picked - this was great!  I did make some minor modifications to make a tad healthier - used 1 c white & 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup sugar (yes, it seems drastically different, but the extra bananas add sweetness and the original amount of sugar seemed so high), 5 bananas, 1/2 c unsw applesauce and 1/3 c oil and NO water.  I did use extra raspberries too.  Very yummy, thank you for the new twist to banana bread!

Needs more banana flavour - next time I'll add more banana and leave out the water.  I was also disappointed by how flat mine ended up being, but I think I may have used a 9" loaf pan, instead of an 8", I didn't measure.  I also replaced the raspberries with blackberries, because that is what I had on hand.

I added the pecans to the flour mixture before adding the wet ingredients, and it created a crunchy little coating around each pecan.  I find sometimes that nuts in baked goods (especially loaves and muffins) sometimes get soggy and mushy, but adding the pecans to the dry ingredients seemed to prevent that!

Excellent! I turned mine into muffins so I could freeze them and take one out whenever I wanted one for coffee break at work. I used milk instead of water. I baked at 350 for 22-24 minutes and recipe made 16 muffins. I used paper liners but also sprayed Pam around the top, round edges of the pan knowing the fruit would make the muffins stick. I cooled them on a rack in pan for 5 minutes, then popped them out and finished cooling. So good!

This bread tastes excellent. I did add roughly about a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon (maybe less) and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the batter. I also broke the raspberries into halves so their slightly tangy flavor was evenly distributed. We liked the walnuts, but the recipe wouldn't suffer if you left them out.
This will make it onto my Christmas cookie/pastry tray this year. It has a great balance of sweet and tangy flavors.

Very good!  I liked it better the next day. I just substituted egg whites for the whole eggs and baby food prunes for the oil to make it healthier.  Yummy!

Update: took this bread to school and left it in the teacher's workroom. It was gone by lunchtime, so I guess everyone liked it! Our counselor wanted the recipe. So I am bumping it up a star (: Original review: I liked the tangy banana/raspberry combo, but my 8yo did not. I switched the oil & water amounts---used 1/2 cup of water & 1/3 of a cup of oil (I thought 1/2 cup of oil might be a little much). I thought it was a really nice bread, would be great with some afternoon tea! Thanks for the post! PS Did not add the walnuts to this, personal preference.

This was good, although my husband liked it much better than I did (I would have probably given it a 3).  I have tasted better banana breads.  It was a little bland to me.  I did enjoy the mix of raspberries with this and it was very moist.  Probably not one I'll make again though.

I just wasn't a fan of this at all. Since three stars is average in my mind, this recipe didn't even measure up to that.  I prepared the recipe just as written, so my less than stellar review is based on the recipe entirely on its own merits.  It wasn't as nicely risen as I would have liked so it looked wimpy; and it was way too sweet, particularly for a banana "bread."  To be honest, I wasn't enamored with the raspberry banana combo either.

I was a skeptic, now I am a believer.  This bread is good.  I never would have thought that bananas and raspberries could taste so good together.  Used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil and baked in mini loaf pans.  We literally can't stop eating it.

Just tried this recipe out and we all loved it!!  We have our own raspberry bushes and have gallons each season.  I made this recipe in little muffin cakes and sprinkled just a little sugar on top.  I followed another viewers suggestion and added the walnuts to the flour/sugar mix and they stayed nice and crunchy.  I'm adding this one to my collection!

This is so yummy it's amazing. I put in pecans since my husband has a walnut allergy and they tasted great. Also, I was a little short on vegetable oil, so I only used a 1/3 cup and it came out just fine.

I loved the flavor, however, the consistency was almost sponge-cake like (which I am NOT a fan of.) Everyone seemed to enjoy it, however, due to the consistency I'm not sure that I would make it again. The flavors were fantastic though!

This was the most delicious bread ever - gone in one day in a household of two! I've never had to use up both old bananas and old raspberries at the same time; I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I used 1/2 c frozen and 1/2 c fresh (not so fresh) halved raspberries, 1 c  white and 3/4 c whole wheat flour,  3/4 c sugar and 1/4 c maple syrup, 1 tsp baking powder in addition to the soda, and Ener-G egg replacer. I also added some cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg to the dry ingredients and added a cinnamon-sugar-flour-"butter" (Earth Balance) crumb topping, which gave it a nice crunch at the top. I omitted the nuts, only because I ate them all while browsing recipes. I was definitely glad I added the baking powder; my loaves were still rather flat, and I was careful not to overmix. Next time - and there WILL be a next time - I'll use all the batter for one loaf, I'll add a little more baking powder, and I'll use even less sugar - the raspberries are so sweet, I think 3/4 c total sweetener would be plenty. Still an A+ recipe!!!

I picked a bunch of wild raspberries this summer, and was looking for a good recipe to use them all in. This bread was DELICIOUS! I brought it to a pool party and everyone was raving about it. Very moist and full of flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

double the mashed bananas and the raspberries, which should be cut in halves. i went half white sugar half brown with extra brown. also added a dash and 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a dash of cinnamon. Also about 5 min. after it comes out the oven remove it from its pan and drizzle it with a syrupy mixture of brown sugar, a dash of cinnamon and water

It is a great raspberry bread! My roommates and I found the banana flavor lacking because the raspberry was so overpowering and I used the amount it called for. I added 1/2 cup sour cream at the end because as I was mixing it I could tell it was going to be a little dry and we love moist bread in our house and it worked great! Next time I will add more banana for sure but this is a great recipe to play around with. I also used baking powder as well as baking soda and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg for a little flavor punch.

I thought these were very good!  I made mine into muffins also and substituted wheat flour (3/4 c) and used Splenda for the sugar.  I forgot to add cinnamon into the first pan of muffins but I did add 1tsp to the second batch and I like those a lot better!  Just adds even more!

Yummy!  I made a few modifications/additions.  I used whole wheat flour.  I didn't have any raspberries so I used a cup of frozen mixed berries which included blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries.  I also added a half teaspoon of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of lemon zest.  It gave the bread a great tang.  My husband who is not into sweets loved this bread!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed it exactly, except I used blueberries instead of raspberries (my raspberries molded overnight).  It was good, but it wasn't great.  I used 1 cup of blueberries, and there were way too many blueberries.  I think half a cup is better.  The second time, I also added some cinnamon (I didn't measure it, but probably about a teaspoon) and brown sugar (probably about 1/4 cup).  This time the bread was sooooo good!  It was a lot more moist than the first batch, and the blueberries added to the flavor instead of seeming like a blueberry bread.  This time it tasted like a coffee cake.  It was great and gone within ten minutes of bringing it over to my parents' house!

I tried this with strawberries. Otherwise followed the recipe. It wasn't nearly as good as it sounds. I gave it four stars because I changed the recipe. I'd like to try it with raspberries and re-rate it.

love the raspberries in this recipe.  Really brightens up the whole recipe.  I also made these into muffins and used 6 bananas and added a little cinnamon.  I followed the suggestion of others and added baking powder instead of baking soda, and they came out a bit dense.  I think the original recipe with the baking soda would have been better.  I am not sure why others suggested it.

I love this recipe, but not the amount of sugar that's in it. I add an extra banana, exchange the oil for unsweetened applesauce, reduce the sugar to 1 cup and omit the water. I also double the raspberries (my son and i LIVE for raspberries!)

This bread turned out fantastic. I left out the walnuts, due to allergies, and used dried cranberries instead of the raspberries, because I couldn't get raspberries, but the bread was awesome. I will definitley make this bread again, and I am looking forward to making it with the fresh raspberries. I think that will make it even better.

I took WILSKA50's advice and added nutmeg, cinnamon and baking powder.  The bread came out deliciously moist and tender.  I'm taking one loaf to a friend and the other will stay home -- but it's disappearing fast!

Absolutely delicious! Definitely my new favorite sweet bread recipe! I changed things a little just to suit my preference but I'm sure the original would have been just as good. I used half whole wheat flour/half white flour, only about 1 cup of sugar, used half raspberry juice/half water, used approx. 1 1/4 c. bananas (3 small bananas), and a few dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon for more flavor and it was so moist and delicious. I will definitely be making this bread again to give to neighbors/friends!

Update: I made this the other night with blueberries instead of raspberries and it was fantastic. I will never use another recipe -- this is it!

This was really good! A nice change from the usual banana bread, and considerably lighter than the sour cream one that I've been making for the last year or so. I used frozen raspberries and it came out nice and moist. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips (for the kids). The flavours were actually quite complementary, so I would probably add even more chips next time. Great recipe!

This was excellent! I made this for breakfast/brunch and was running short on time, so I made muffins instead of bread.  I cooked them for 20-25 minutes.  I was also short on some ingredients and feeling crazy, so I added 2 tablespoons of poppy seed, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and used one cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also made a struesel topping with 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tbsp cream cheese, and 1/2 tbsp of butter.

I followed previous reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I wasnt sure if the reviewer meant they used 1 tsp of baking powder instead of baking soda or in addition so I just added 1/2 tsp of the powder to the soda as well. I also felt a'little wild so I added 1/4 cup melted butter to wet ingredients, what can I say? ;)I loved the idea of brown sugar! I added 1 cup of it to 1/2 cup of sugar. I coated the pan w/sugar mixed with nutmeg, and loved it a bit! It made a nice crispy sweet layer. Next time I might add an additional 1/2 cup or so of raspberries.

I used fresh raspberries and chopped pecans. I also made mine into muffins instead bread.. 

Very very tasty. Only recommendation is to mash berries up a bit more. My family didn't like the berries being so whole and having a bite ending up being just raspberry. But will be making again.

I took the advice of the others and doubled the bananas.   A necessary change, in my opinion.   Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I put it into a 9X13 and made it into a banana raspberry cake, covered it with cream cheese icing and a little bit of raspberry pie filling.  Delicious.

Reversed the water/oil ratio per a previous reviewer and also used baking powder rather than baking soda as per a previous reviewer and also reduced the sugar to one cup.  Didn't have walnuts so used slivered almonds and put in slightly more banana than called for.  Cooked a bit longer and it was a nice new version of the standard banana bread.

I bake bread all the time yet somehow this one never got done! It cooked from 2:30-4:30 on 350 and it was still not done on the inside. It of course was ruined because the crust was too hard and the inside to mushy to be salvagable. Its too bad that this happened because I had a taste of the batter beforehand and it was super good. I think perhaps using water or milk in this recipe is the part that messes it up. I think I will just use my regular banana bread recipe and just add berries next time. Too bad:(

Good & moist. I too added more banana (doubled it), substituted apple sauce for the oil, and used 1/2 splenda / 1/2 sugar to cut down on the fat.  Also cooked it in a bundt pan. Fab.

Absolutely love this recipe! It is so easy to make and everyone loves it as well! I usually cut the raspberries in half so that they are more evenly distributed and not all in one spot. I have also made it with Blackberries, still delicious! :)

Added half a stick of butter- only because I'm Southern and its against my religion not to.
Split batter into 2 bowls- added 1/2 cup frozen blueberries to one, 1/2 cup frozen raspberries to the other. Made 2 miniloafs of each (4 total). Baked at 350 convection 30 minutes. 
3 are cooling now, 1 I'm sad to say is nearly gone. SO GOOD.

This bread is very good.  I put the whole batch of batter into my bread machine to bake (times will vary depending on your machine, but as soon as the bread scent reaches your nose, you'll know its ready).  I substituted the raspberries with frozen blackberries, which came out well.  I omitted the extra half cup of sugar, and the bread was still very sweet.  As other reviewers have suggested, in the future I will try using white and brown sugar (1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown) and I will use a tsp. of baking powder.  Another tip is to swap an equivalent amount of applesauce for the oil, which is lower fat and adds sweetness.  In this batch of bread I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla extract for additional layers of flavor.  Quite good; will make it again!

This was really good, but the texture didn't seem quite right.  Next time, I think I would use baking powder instead of baking soda and cut the sugar in half.

This  is an excellent recipe.  I didn't have raspberries, so I used cranberries.  It was still delicious.  The cranberries were tart, but went well with the sweetness of the bread.

I made half the recipe (1 loaf) but decided to experiment and turn it into a Chocolate Rasperry Banana bread.  I added 1/8 tsp of vanilla, and replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips.  I then added 1/2 cup of ovaltine to the batter.  I wasnt sure how it would be but it turned out really good.  A nice chocolate taste with a mild banana flavor and the raspberries were a great addition.  I think that this is a very flexible recipe and because of that it earns 5 stars but I cannot really comment on the results of the original recipe but I am sure that is good as well based on the other reviews. I think that I will be coming back to this recipe and would even try turning it into blueberry muffins. Thanks for the great recipe

Well this recipe was very tasty. I only was disappointed for the fact that other pictures that are posted looked totally beautiful, light and not like dark banana bread like mine turned out. Plus, it didn't rise like I thought it should. It didn't really rise at all. I divided the batter like it said...but should have left it all in one pan. Now needless to say I love the gooey banana bread, but I thought I had missed something or didn't follow the recipe correctly, so I read over everything again and then the views and some one said they added 1 tsp baking powder to it, and so I did the same, and it still didn't rise up like it should have the 2nd time. I checked all my ingredients and all were in date.....but still it tasted just fine, My kids totally loved it. I ended up with 4 small loaves. I'm just really wondering if people were just using  1 banana instead of 2 because I measured out a whole cup of bananas both times when making the recipe.....who knows but it was quite moist and tasty.

The only problem with this bread is that I cannot stop eating it!  Here are a list of my modifications: 1)Sub ½ cup of white sugar with brown sugar  2)Added 1 tsp of vanilla  3)No nuts  4)Didn’t measure the bananas but used 3 large, VERY ripe bananas  5)Cut the frozen raspberries in half before folding them in.  Very dense, very moist.  Yummers!

This was very moist and dense. I used fresh raspberries-they added a nice tang to an otherwise very sweet bread--and I enjoyed the combined taste of banana/raspberry. I might cut back on the sugar and the oil next time. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and left out the walnuts. Thanks for the recipe, Nancy!

I wish I could rate this higher than five stars!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out VERY well.  I used a dark pan and my Middle Eastern oven heats from the top (big sigh!) so I had to cover them with tin foil near the end of the baking time since they were starting to burn.  I would use a glass pan next time and perhaps reduce the heat a tad.  EXCELLENT!  A big hit.

Absolutely wonderful!  I added some more banana and raspberries than were called for, just to give it some extra flavor.  The two loaves disappeared within two days at my house; everyone loved it!

This recipe has become one of my family's favorite.  I do not make any changes to this very simple recipe.  Once cooled I wrap the loaves in aluminum foil.  This adds to the moisture of the bread and makes it even better the following day.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added 1/2 a cup of sour cream for a moister bread, and I really enjoyed the outcome.

i have two teenagers and am all over slipping in extra nutrition when i can. i made my own alterations and found these to be quite tasty. i used 1/3 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of milk instead of water. i used only 1 scant cup brown sugar. with a wheat intolerance, i switched the all-purpose flour for a combination of rice and tapioca flour and added 1 tsp of baking powder to help with the rise. i threw in some shredded coconut and oatmeal and poked a single raspberry into the middle of each muffin instead of mixing them into the batter. i left out the nuts as both kids are in braces. a great breakfast or afterschool snack!

Very good! I added a tsp of baking powder and a tsp of cinnamon, and used all brown sugar.  It is so good I have used it as a dessert for company just added a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the warm bread.

Fantastic!  I had some raspberries that needed to be used up and I had all the ingredients in the house.  I did take the suggestion of some of the raters and added cinnamon and nutmeg and replaced the baking soda with baking powder and 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown.  The 2nd loaf went to my boyfriend's parents house which is where I went 15 minutes after taking the bread out of the oven.

This was the best banana bread I've ever had!  I added a nice crispy topping by reserving some of the walnuts, melting a tablespoon of butter add it to the walnuts along with some cinnamon & brown sugar add it to the top before baking & you have a nice sweet crispy topping.

Yum!  Made this last night and couldn't stop eating it.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect.  This will go in my favorites with the Blueberry Zucchini Bread.  I recommend both recipes highly.

I have been looking for something to do with my raspberry's. After reading the reviews I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder, a couple spoons of sour cream for that's what I had and two cups of raspberry's.  I also poured over a lemon-lime sugar glaze over the bread while still in the pan. It turned out great. I will definitely make this again

I used this recipe last night for a picnic. I modified by taking out the water and walnuts and doubling the banana. I also used frozen raspberries. To my surprise, I did not have any loaf pans in the house, so I used a 8 inch square cake pan and six tiny heart shaped muffin cups (I had extra batter, due to the extra banana). The muffins only took about 10-15 min, but the cake took exactly 55 minutes in the square pan. Everyone loved the cake. It was perfectly moist. Would also be nice with a light sugar glaze as a cake recipe.   Next time I might up the raspberry content. A great recipe.

2012-09-13
Tonight I made this recipe with the following alterations 
1 3/4 cup brown rice flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 tsp baking soda
2 eggs
1 cup mashed banana
1/2 cup applesauce
1.25 cup of blackberries

Turned out great.

Very good! I made this and it was so moist and delicious! The perfect variation of sweet and tart! We used 2 small round cake pans (because we didn't have any bread pans) and I promise you, they were both gone in a day! We struggled to keep it from being eaten. Couldn't help ourselves! I used 1/3 cup of vegetable oil instead of 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup of water instead of a 1/3! Baked it for 30 minutes and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Halfway through the cooking process I turned the oven down from 350 to 300 because I saw the edges of the cake browning quickly (i feared it getting burnt). It turned out perfect! Soft, moist, and when placed in the fridge to eat then next day, still very soft and moist! I loved the raspberry! And the nuts, make sure you finely chop those. The smaller the better! It tasted like it came from the store! Well, better than the store actually! Success! Wonderful recipe!

This was so moist!  I whipped up cream cheese, some butter, fresh raspberries and a little 10x sugar  in my food processor to use as a spread for the bread. (It doesn't need this though)  I took this to work and it was gone in an hour.  This will always be my most favorite banana bread recipe.

This is a keeper.  Made one loaf and 3 big muffins.  Used fresh picked raspberries / blueberries, substituted butter for the oil and did 1c sugar 1/2 c brown sugar.  My young son helped me make these, it was simple and quick.  Very moist and sweet.

Made as muffins (350 for 22 minutes). Excellent. Used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Added a tsp of vanilla and tsp of cinnamon. Upped the raspberries to 2 cups. Whole family loved them. Thanks!

Following several suggestions from previous reviewers, I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I added 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I cut back on the oil a bit, using 1/3 cup oil and 1/2 cup of water.  I only had 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pans, so I only needed to bake the bread for about 40 minutes. This bread is incredible and very moist. I'm sure even without these changes it's great.   For the calorie counters out there, the original recipe yields about 112 calories a serving...if you are really going to count this as 32 servings. Realistically, I would say it is more like 12 servings...which would mean the calorie content is about 300/serving. =o).

GREAT! moist, full of flavor and easy to make.  I made mini muffins rather than a loaf. 350 degrees until tops spring back and golden brown( sorry I forgot to time it). I altered the recipes slightly-only used 1 1/4c flour, 1/4c ground flax seed, 1/4c wheat germ, and rather than using water I used soy milk and I added more raspberries cutting them in half.  my kids LOVE these, even my daughter who hates bananas!!

co-workers, family loved these. they were soooo good-slightly warm.  I made muffin tops and regular sized muffins.  I recommend muffin tops. Easier to get out of the pan. I don't waste money on the muffin cups anymore. I would not make minimuffins with these as the raspberries are "big".

Pretty good. I used half white sugar and half brown and instead of the water I used sour cream. I also used a frozen berry mix instead of just raspberries. I added a brown sugar/oatmeal crumb to the top and it turned out very good. Moist and flavorful.

This recipe was easy and simple. I added some things though to give it more taste. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, a dash of pumpkin spice(randonm spices in it like cinnamon, nutmeg and things like that). I used half as much salt as what was called for.  I only used one cup of sugar, and added a Tsp of honey and threw in a Tsp of light brown sugar. I mashed the strawberries instead of raspeberries. And I added about a quarter of a quart of blueberries to the recipe also.  Half of the blueberries I mashed the other half I did not. And I also added about 1 Tsp of orange rind peel shredded. Anyway, it was delicious. I encourage people to get creative with simple recipes! I mean look at me! I used to burn water and now I'm making almost gourmet bread! Ha.. who would have thought?

My family and extended family loved this bread.  I had a bag of fresh-frozen raspberries that needed to be used up and this fit the bill VERY nicely.  I made a double batch and baked in my mini pans (6 x 3 1/2) and it made 7 loaves.  I made 4 loaves with toasted pecans (I was out of walnuts) and 3 loaves without nuts for my son.  The texture and flavor of this bread is spot on.  I most certainly will be making this one again.

I felt that it needed a little more flavor. I'll add a little vanilla next time. The raspberries were a nice touch.

I loved this recipe. I substituted the water for milk and used jam instead of actual berries. And added some cinnamon as well. I will definitely use this recipe again!  Thank you

This is one of the best banana breads I've ever tasted!  I don't like nuts, and substituted white chocolate chips for the nuts.  Also, instead of 1/2 cup oil, I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce.  Wonderful bread!  I'll be making this again!

I make this recipe as muffins.  I substitute apple sauce for the oil and use less than half of the sugar than the recipe calls for.  They are still outstanding.  I also throw in flax seed and walnuts.

So good! I used apple sauce in place of the oil the first time I tried this recipe, but I didn't completely drain the raspberries so it came out a little soggy. The second time I made it, it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is fantastic! I did not add or change to baking powder as many suggested, so it apparently isn't necessary. I did make some changes... I used 1/4 C oil, but then added about 1/4 C of mayonnaise, which always makes baked goods very moist. I used 1 cup sugar and less than 1/2 cup splenda. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I didn't have enough frozen raspberries so I used some frozen strawberries as well, this made a really nice taste, you could definitely substitute for all the raspberries if you like things less tart. I used pecans instead of walnuts, because I love pecans in baked goods. The bread turned out fluffy and moist, with a gorgeous, glossy top, and it tastes wonderful! I will definitely make this again!

At first I made this as the recipe suggested, but splitting the recipe into two pans just made it fall apart where the raspberries were. This is much better baked in one larger pan, with the mixture filling up 3/4 of its volume. Very tasty and is amazing served with fresh passionfruit! Will definitely make this again.

I use this recipe often as written or without the fruits as the base for other sweet quick breads. It's very adaptable and forgiving - allowing plenty of room for experiments.

Very yummy bread!  I used 2 tsp of baking powder instead of the soda, bumped up the flour to 2 c. and used 1/2 c. water and 1/3 c. oil.  Love the combination of raspberries, bananas, and nuts.

Tasty bread!  Very moist and not too sweet. My grocery store didn't have any ripe bananas when I decided to make this, so I used baby food instead...turned out great!  The only thing I think I would do differently next time is line the bottom of my pans with parchment paper, since they stuck to the bottom a bit this last go 'round....

This bread was amazing.  The mini loaves I made were a bit too moist.  I probably should have baked them longer.  Also I would add more flour next time since I live at such a high elevation and it fell a bit.

This are very tasty and moist.  I made muffins so I cooked them for a shorter time, but lost track of exactly how long.    I also left out the nuts since I didn't have any.  I cut this sugar back just a bit as others had recommended.  These are a keeper!

Good bread. Did not have bananas so I used a cup of applesauce and a cup and a half of raspberries. Made it in four small loaf pans, first batch stuck to the pans, so I greased then floured the pans in the next batch. Was nice and moist with raspberries in every bite. Will try next time with the bananas. Don't be thrown off by the grey color, it changes after baking.

I didn't really care for this recipe.  I added some nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla, cut the berries in half.  It was just bland to me and a bit soggy where the berries were.  I love banana bread and thought this would be a great twist with the berries.  I will not make this again.

This was an amazing bread, however I did make a few changes before I even tried it in it original version.  Instead of 1/3 c of water I did 1/2 cup of milk and cut the sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 and add 1 cup of mixed frozen berries.  Blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.  Next time I'll probably add 2 cups of berries.

I've always been kinda "meh" about banana bread. It just doesn't excite me. When I found myself with overripe bananas I decided to try to find a recipe that I liked, and this one is really, really good. 

I increased the bananas to 1 1/2 cups (4 medium bananas) and I love raspberries so I threw in some extra. I also added all the sweet spices like I do with all my baking (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cardamom). I took one reviewer's idea and made half the batter into cupcakes, leaving the nuts out of half for my boyfriend's kids. The (notoriously picky) kids, the boyfriend and I all loved this, and making it as cupcakes makes them really portable and works great with kids. Best banana bread recipe ever! I'll definitely make this again (probably tomorrow!)

I made this recipe as a muffin recipe for this chilly Sunday morning and they really hit the spot.  I used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour, applesauce instead of oil, oatmeal for walnuts, mixed berries for the raspberries, and used 1/2 cup less sugar.  So there are quite a few ways to make the recipe healthier but still just as delicious and moist.  The berries really make this recipe stand out among other banana bread recipes.

Oh Wow!This bread is so delicious!I don't think I'll ever make plain banana bread again after trying this.I only had a bag of frozen mixed berries so I just picked all the raspberries out of it.I didn't quite have a cup so I went ahead and added some of the blackberries and strawberries chopped up too.I loved all the berries in this! It made the bread so moist and it had a wonderful flavor.It tasted like berry jam baked in the bread.I think next time I'll add even more.I didn't measure the bananas I just used 3 large and I thought it was perfect.I also added about a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla because I always add that to my banana bread.I'm so happy I decided to try this recipe ..it's so good and I will for sure be making this again soon.Thank You for the wonderful recipe!!

This bread is the best! I made a few changes. I took out the walnuts, just don't really like hard nuts in soft breads. Then i used advice of other reviews and only used 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty! 1 1/2 cups is overkill! Finally, well I guess this isn't really a change, but I used frozen raspberries and I'm pretty sure they were sweetened since the bag didn't specify unsweetened. it's really good though one loaf is already gone! the only thing I wish is that there was some nutrition info for the bread.

Very good banana bread!  I made two adjustments. 1)For the oil, I used almost a 1/2 cup of applesauce (one single serving size cup) and topped off the 1/2 cup with canola oil. 2) Used 1 cup of frozen cranberries instead of the raspberries.

I made this today and changed a few things.  I added frozed cut up strawberries in place of the raspberry, used 1c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar and cut the oil to 1/3 c.  That being said the bread is very good but very flat.  I wonder if it should have had baking powder not baking soda???  I'm not a baker so I really don't know if that is the reason the bread was so flat and dense but it was good - just doesn't look very pretty.

This was a beautiful bread that I just couldn't stop eating. I left out the nuts due to personal preference. I have a freezer full of raspberries thanks to a bumper crop in my garden. So I will be making this many more times. Thanks for sharing Nancy.

Love it. Followed the direction from a previous reviewer (to incorporate the wheat flour, apple sauce, up the bananas and cut down the sugar) and it worked great. I baked for longer (still a bit gummy with just 50 minutes). Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe with chopped frozen cranberries and pecans because that was all I had on hand.  It was really great.  I also used 3 bananas and 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1 c. white.

I never made bread of any kind before and followed this to the letter. This recipe is awesome and friends and family rave about it! I recently went to a benefit auction for children with cancer. I took a loaf of this and donated it. It brought $20.00! Thank you for listing this recipe here.

This is now my new favorite Banana Muffin recipe. I like using canola oil because it is easier and healthier than using solid fats and have tried other recipes using oil. I did make a few changes.  I added a teaspoon of baking powder since I wanted to make the bread lighter in texture for muffins. I had about 1/2 cup of leftover cranberry sauce that I added and did not use the nuts. I did not add any flavorings and enjoyed the banana and cranberry flavors. I made 20 muffins in paper liners and baked them for about 21 minutes.  A delcious and satisfying breakfast.

I made a couple changes, but small ones. 
I used a stick of margerine in place of the vegetable oil, used buttermilk in place of the water, added vanilla and used blackberries in place of the raspberries. 

Simple enough to throw together for my husband's pool league and a different twist on your average banana bread. 

I'd make this again.

EDITED TO ADD SAME DAY: Did anyone else have issues with really dark bread? Mine was REALLY dark. I don't know if I should bake it at a lower temp next time.

Excellent, moist bread. Made a few changes - used 1C white and 3/4C whole wheat flour, 3/4C Splenda blend instead of sugar, and frozen blueberries instead of raspberries since i didn't have raspberries. I will definitely make it again!

This bread is moist, delicious, and welcomes modifications. I have made it twice, and I have added different fruits each time. The first time I made it using three ripe bananas, dried cranberries, and also added 1 tsp. baking soda as well as 1 tsp. baking powder. The next time I increased the banana to four ripe bananas, changed the raspberries to blackberries, added a handful of dried cranberries, and used applesauce in place of most of the oil. I just added a couple of tablespoons of oil, which probably wasn't necessary. I will continue to "play" with the recipe. This bread is so moist and delicious! Since there are no preservatives in this bread, refrigerate if it will not be eaten within a couple of days.

My husband said this is the best bread he's ever tasted. It was SO moist. I have since made it with blueberries, and it tasted just as moist. This is by far the easiest and best tasting bread recipe I have ever made.

I did not like the tart raspberry flavor with the mellow banana- but that is just my tastebuds.  I can honestly say that if you love raspberry's you'll love this bread.  I would add a few more spices to the bread mixture to give a little more flavor to it since there isn't a bit of raspberry with each bite.  I also did not add walnuts- I don't like them.  This would be wonderful to take to a bake sale or serve to others, I just couldn't eat it all myself.

This was a good alternative to plain banana bread, but I think I prefer it without the raspberries.  I mixed them through, but they all seemed to congregate in the center of the bread, making one very raspberry bite.

I give this a 4 star as I made tweeks to improve the recipe. With the tweeks it is a 5 star. I used 1 cup sugar 1/2 brown sugar, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also changed the water to 1/2 cup. I omit the nuts so that my kids can bring it to school to eat. 
I usually double the batch and freeze them. They freeze very well. 
This loaf will not last more than 24 hours in my house. With a double batch of 4 loafs we are good for the week's worth of breakfasts. The kids love this for breakfast.

So 5 stars, 1. People were offering to pay me for this baked good literally and 2. I added white chocolate chips in mine just because my family likes their baked goods really super fatty.  Of course, right?  A WONDERFUL recipe to give a try you'll fall in love with it just like everyone else.

Fast, easy and awesome.  To make it easier, I do the wet ingredients first, add the dry to it, then the raspberries and make a one bowl wonder.  I have changed this with many alterations, but I ALWAYS add more raspberries.  I've used milk or apple juice rather than water for better flavor and also add either a bit of pure vanilla or almond extract. Fabulous no matter how it's made.

Yum! Little thick, took longer to bake and then almost burned. Still quite moist and tasty, thanks!

Very good flavor! But the berries gave the bread too many seeds in your mouth and I didn't liked that as much. Maybe next time add raspberry jam?

Pretty darn good! Exceptional! I didnt do a thing different to the recipe. If I was to be really really picky and make this again...I would just cut the raspberries in half to make them smaller as the huge globs of raspberry in the bread werent very great. It was a little gross...but thats just being super picky. I will be making this bread again for sure!

MMMM.  Delish.  I did change the recipe a little, only because I'm trying to make healthier dishes for my boyfriend.  He loves sweets (and he liked this one, too.)  I used only 1 and 1/4 cup sugar, and I substituted 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1/4 cup oatmeal for the 3/4 c. all purpose flour.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup blueberries, a teaspoon vanilla, and a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon (for a little kick).  Very moist and smells so yummy.
