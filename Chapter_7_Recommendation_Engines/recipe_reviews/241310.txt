I doubled the recipe and glad I did. Very good and even better the next day! I did deviate on the pearl barley I had. In a separate pan, I covered the barley with a couple inches of water, bought to a boil and then covered and set off the burner for an hour. Added the finished barley with the meat at the end. Had a really nice texture.

I had to cheat and make this in the slow cooker because I was rushed. I browned the meat and added all the other ingredients, except the barley, and cooked on low for 4 hours.  When I got home I  made quick barley on the stove,  pulled out the bones, shredded the meat and added it with the barley and more salt and pepper before serving.  It's very filling and tasty .

Cooked this a couple days after Chef John posted the recipe, and it was my favorite beef barley soup ever.  I did add an extra couple cups of stock to make it more soupy than stew, but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  The only bad thing is that my friend came over the day after and ate all my leftovers!  5stars, and highly recommended.

I followed the instructions pretty much spot-on this first time (I was able to get some great beef shank at the local butcher).  The only thing I changed is I cooked the stew (prior to adding the barley) for probably around 4 hours or so in a heavy cast iron dutch oven.  This was, without a doubt, the greatest beef stew- although it isn't what you would traditionally think of beef stew.  It became this profoundly rich and beefy substance with such an exquisite gelatinous mouth-feel it was simply heavenly.  If I'm sick this is going to be my new chicken noodle soup.  I will make this again, within the week.

great comfort food!   I made it to the recipe, tho' I did add a step to rinse my barley......      the hubby was very happy!     The one thing that I suggest is to have all of the prep done  (veggies cut, tomato paste  measured out, chicken broth open and ready  to pour as suggested) before you start cooking.   Will make again for sure!  thanks Chef John, and the helpful hints were great!

Followed the recipe with two exceptions.

I used cut up beef chuck instead of the shank.

One problem I had was that I used salted broth in the recipe.  This made the 'soup' quite salty.

I would recommend buying unsalted broth and  add your own as needed.

I made this on a Sunday afternoon.  I had never cooked beef shank before, but when the butcher mentioned the bone marrow, I knew I was in store for something special.  It takes a while , but it is well worth it.  It hit the spot that cold NE Sunday afternoon, and was even better for lunch and dinner the following week.  Thanks...will make this often.

What a wonderful pot of soup/stew for the cold days in the Midwest. Delightful to make, my husband said what smells so good while it was cooking. Very tasty but be prepared to cook this for some time. One pot meal well worth the wait. I also added a can of diced tomatoes for more liquid, more like a soup then a stew. Changed the meat with what I had on hand, oxtails, delish.

Our compliments to Chef John! I doubled the broth amount and made soup instead. I also used thyme instead of rosemary since that was all I had in hand. Caution in adding salt as a little goes a long way in this dish.

Another excellent Chef John recipe!  The only change I made was that I used unsalted beef stock instead of the chicken broth.  I wanted to add a good beefy richness to the soup, and used unsalted for health reasons.  Using beef shank was new to me - I usually used beef chuck.  What a difference! Will never go back!  Thanks!!

Made this on a cold winter night, and it was a hit with the family. Every ounce of this dish was eaten. The only thing I would change is how soon you add the diced celery and carrots. They turned to mush by the time the dish was done. Next time, I will add the celery and carrots about 25 minutes before the dish is done, instead of at the beginning. Otherwise, this was a fantastic dish, and I will be making again. Thanks for sharing Chef John.

I love the full flavor of this stew. The beef shank really deepens the flavor. I do add 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms after the garlic.  I sauté them for about  five minutes and then continue with the recipe.  I also cook the barley separately.  Cook the half cup barley in one and one quarter cup water for fifty minutes. Add the cooked barley in the last ten minutes and then serve.  Cooking the barley separately keeps the liquid balance correct.

very decent soup. Only thing Id change is I would double the recipe next time. Doesn't make that much. Not bad for an appetizer or side dish but if you have a group of 4 or 5 people and want this as your main course Id definitely double up.

A new favorite in our house! I’ve made a ton of different soups over the years and this is amazing! Beef shank is currently out of season and not available at our grocery store, so I used a pound of beef rib back to simmer the bone and about a pound of stew meat.

I cook for our chiropractic patients on Monday nights. I made this tonight and this has to be the favorite of all the soups and stews I've made to date (since the 1980's). The only thing I changed was, instead of chicken stock, I used water infused with with Better Than Bouillon Vegetable paste (which is really close to beef bouillon without all the salt). I had to quadruple the recipe and had hardly anything left. Way to go, Chef John... way... to... go!

I doubled recipe and added more liquid for a soup. Added a can of crushed tomstoes. Have butcher saw shanks in half. Easier to sear and ecposes all that marrow.

Like all Chef John’s I’ve attempted to date this recipe turned out a delicious dish.  I was searching for a good stew recipe when Beef and Barley popped up.  
It’s autumn, the weather is chilly and the days are shortening and  it’s soups, stews and roasts.  All potato heavy recipes.  I’d forgotten about barley and I love barley so Chef John to the rescue.  A great break from potato.
I followed the recipe to the degree that Chef John has taught me over the years, which is to say casually.  I’d already purchased stew beef so no shank steak.  The result was great.  Next time though I’ll be preparing the recipe with the shank steak and enjoying the wonderful flavors one get from beef marrow.

This was one of the best soups I've made--absolutely delicious!!!
I pretty much followed Chef John's recipe.  I didn't have beef shanks so used some bones from a rib eye roast and a small chuck roast.  I used more meat & so used more carrots & celery & used 1 cup of barley.  I did add potatoes and mushrooms, and besides the 4 cups chicken broth on hand, I added 4 cups newly purchased beef stock.  I seasoned as per the recipe but I keep forgetting to try the horseradish!!  I only have mild cream horseradish; hopefully I'll remember to add it to my next bowl as I think I'd like it.
Many thanks, Chef John, for the very tasty recipe.

Followed recipe exactly and I really like it. Next time I will follow the advice of other reviewers and, instead of taking the beef out of the pot, I will leave it in there and just add the barley a bit earlier in the cooking time.

Excellent dish. If you need that hole in your stomach filled, this is what'll do it.
Except for the garnishes which I didn't use, I followed the recipe exactly. As an inveterate carnivore, I never thought I'd say this, but I thought there was too much meat. I used two beef shanks totaling 1lb13oz; next time I'll use maybe a single one-pound shank. As directed, I salted the shanks before browning and added a pinch of salt to the onions and that was all the salt I added. Using low-sodium chicken broth (570mg per cup) added enough salt for my tastes. It was perfect.

I used a chuck roast instead of the beef shank. 
This is a delicious soup.  I used 2 quarts of beef broth, but pretty much stayed with the rest of the recipe.  The tomato paste makes the soup thicker and tastier.  I will make this again.  It is wonderful.

I made this exactly as described and it’s amazing! Very good depth of flavours with a glossiness from the beef shank.
Tried it another time with a different cut of beef, and it’s not the same. I strongly suggest using the beef shank, it makes all the difference.

This was great!  I doubled the recipe and added some extra broth to make more of a soup.  I also used a 2.5lb Chuck Pot Roast and added the cooked barley at the end.  Excellent.  It freezes really well and I enjoy a bowl for lunch every few days.  It'll be a freezer staple all winter long.

Followed the recipe to spec with some slight modifications. I cooked in a slow cookere and dredged beef in a seasoned flour before searing. L Cooked on low for 5-6 hours. Added the barley to slow cooker with an hour cooking time left. It was PERFECTION!  Swapped out fresh rosemary for dried cuz that was all I had. This will be in the winter/stew/slow cooker rotation!!!

I am a Chef John fan. This was my first time cooking beef shank and  cooking barley.   I follwed the recipe exactly. I did find it less thick and rich than I expected and a little bland. I added some hot sauce at the table to give it a bit more flavor.

So good. I too used more broth and I am obsessed with this now as the only soup I do not get tired of before the pot of it is done. My butcher doesn't always have shank so I check every time I go, in case it means I can make it again. Wheeee!!

Absolutely spectacular! I followed directions as written by Chef John and had a beautiful result! Sadly, I was not able to find beef shank near me, and used 2 lbs chuck roast that I sliced length wise to make 1lb each. However, when I can get some beef shank, I will certainly be trying with that. Alternatively, I May try adding a piece of bone marrow on its own to try and get the same effect as the beef shank would have.

Delicious stew. A new family favorite.  The flavor is so rich I used  about 1.75 pounds of beef shank which  includied  the bone so I would say it was maybe a little over a pound of meat total.. I used 2 tablespoons oil to brown it in. I cut up two stocks of celery and two carrots. Little more than the recipe called for But this was perfect. I used  4 cups low sodium chicken broth however halfway through the cooking time I thought the liquid was getting a little lower so then  I added 16 ounce can of lower sodium beef broth .  this  gave the stew a good flavor in addition to the chicken broth and perfect amount of liquids.. I also noticed that the onions pretty much dissipated. So halfway through the cooking time I slivered a half an onion and added  it to the  stew.  The onions were still visible at the end of the cooking time and also gave it a little flavor . At the end of the cooking time everything came together perfect it was so delicious. I would definitely use the beef shank over for beef stew meat. The beef shanks give it a little more flavor than beef stew meat .

Love Chef John's recipes! As others have stated, my chicken broth was salty enough, taste before you decide to add salt.

Very good. Better yet on day 2 or 3, if it lasts that long. I didn't take the beef out but added the barley sooner. Used pot barley, more nutritious than pearl barley. Beef is fork tender.

I made a few minor changes as I really wanted to make soup rather than stew.  Like a couple of other raters I added a can of crushed tomatoes and a bit of extra stock.  Also, when I removed the beef before putting in the mushrooms, celery and carrots, I shredded the beef and removed the strips of fat before putting it all together (including the bones!) for the last hour of simmering.  This soup and half a baguette, heaven for a neophyte foodie.  Will freeze the rest for those winter days that call for comfort food.

This recipe is so amazing I give it a 5 because it was amazing as is with no changes.  Made it 2 or 3 times.  Today however I changed it up by adding potatoes instead of barley and added a tablespoon of curry powder, still amazing.

I normally like beef barley soup, but gave this stew a try. It's a very east recipe and the meat doesn't break the bank. It does take a long time to cook, but it is worth it. My wife and I both loved it. What a great recipe

This was very good and my first time cooking with beef shanks.  After adding the veggies I deglazed the pan with a splash of merlot before adding the broth. Also, just before covering for the long simmer, I tossed in 12 ounces of chopped fresh mushrooms.  I will definitely make this again!

Made this for a friend battling cancer. Very nice recipe since I had to buy my stock from store since I wasn’t home to use my homemade stock. Bought Emrils brand as it was on sale and I was impressed with it. Completed Broth was very tasty. I added mushrooms towards the end. Loved using beef shanks and they were easy to find in grocery store. 
Chef John’s recipes are great.

As usual, Chef John knows his stuff.  I've made and thoroughly enjoyed many of his dishes and as usual this does not disappoint. The meat was fall off the bone tender. The broth/sauce was very tasty.   I can see substituting potatoes, peas and corn to make somewhat of a stew, for a quick change up.  Will definitely be making this again.

This is my husbands absolute favorite soup! The only thing I did differently is I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the paste (it’s what I had). It makes it more soup like. Super Yummy!!

Excellent recipe. I used a strip steak so cooked it within an hour during which I also added the barley in the last 45 minutes to speed things along. I kept the steak in there the whole time and then put it on top of the stew at the end. I garnished with a tiny bit of parsley and fresh thyme, and it was incredibly delicious. You can really taste the beef juices that have simmered all the way out. Only thing I would change is to add 2 cups of hot water (which I did), or double the amount of broth because I found with the lid ajar, most of the liquid evaporated over the course of the hour and a half I was cooking.

2/3/19 - Very good - used 1.5 pounds of stew beef (couldn't find beef shank), I added over a cup each of carrots and celery, added some basil and rosemary, doubled the garlic and added 6 cups of water in addition to cooking the barley separately and adding it to the soup mix.  Smells amazing and tastes even better!

Was really good.   As another reviewer did I cooked the barley in a separate pot and only added it at the end.   I found the broth a bit bland so added a tablespoon of marmite and a tablespoon of beef boullion and it really boosted the flavours.  Very good, I will make this again.

We hosted our annual Christmas Day "Soup's On" event, and this was one of the three soups that we served.  We doubled the recipe but there wasn't a drop left by the end.  This is definitely a keeper recipe and will be served again.  We cooked this and kept it warm in the crockpot which made it even more tender.  Awesome, hearty recipe.

The ingredients are deceptively basic, the results zoom beyond. For too many  years I've passed on beef shanks, I mean who would spend bucks for a bit of meat and lot of bone? Now, me.

My husband likes barley so I was looking for something a little different than simmering it with broth and serving as a side dish.  This recipe did the trick. My husband asked me to make it again.  That means he really likes it.

I followed the process of this recipe with my own twerk and made the best beef barley STEW ive ever had; this was my first time making too. I used the meat off my soup bone and added POTATOES. I can't imagine beef barley without.

I used 3/4 lb chuck steak   Browned first then cut in thumb size chunks.  I didn’t need the tomato paste. I added some Worcester sauce before I added the carrots and celery at last to cook but not become mushy.  It only needs 45min to cook    Next time I will pick up a couple of bread bowls to serve soup in. So so good

It did need extra salt and pepper but absolutely delicious even though I subbed beef stew chunks (1.5lbs) for the beef shanks. Leaves are falling, a crock pot of applesauce is cooking down, and I couldn’t wait for some delicious soup. Would like to say I will freeze this but I don’t think it will last that long at home!

As with all Chef John recipes, It is excellent! Every time I have a craving for some dish, I just go to Chef John's "Cooking for Two" and Viola. It's gotten to the point that I only use his recipes and have yet to be disappointed. Thanks John for all your hard work. :)

Repeat favorite.  Make early enough to allow barley to soften some and the flavors to steep.

Well worth seeking out good beef shanks... I found 2 with marrow clean through, even it took trips to 4 grocery stores.  I plan to make again with zucchini and yellow squash added.

I have to admit, when it comes to beef stew I've always kind of felt like if you've tried one, you've  tried them all. This recipe changed my mind. I LOVED it. I did alter it just a tiny bit in that i used a Dutch oven and cooked it on low for about four hours. I also threw in some mushrooms and 1 and 1/2 cups of barley to make it hearty enough that it didn't need a side. loved it!

so simple and yet so good!   I followed recipe almost exactly. I did up amount of rosemary but thats about it!  Instense flavor it you pre-brown it . I cooked entire dish in my deep dish copper skillet  ( as seen on tv skillet).  I pre-browned it, simmered it on stove top and finished it in oven  covered @ 325 degrees.   I started process at noon time and we were eating a great meal at 7pm.  I let it slow cook in oven with carrots and celery  and added quick Quaker Barley last 45 minutes.  What a wonderful meal with low salt .  I served with boiled potatoes and brown n serve rolls along with a simple salad.  Excellent meal.

This was delicious--everyone loved it. Next time I make it I will probably trim some of the fat off the meat before cooking (sauce needed a lot of skimming), and I might add more liquid (barley absorbed quite a bit of the sauce).

I made this according to directions. I only added a portobello mushroom that I had. The recipe and video are straightforward and easy to follow. I had two very thick slices of shank (maybe 2.5 inches thick).  This took about 4 hours to get tender. I had some cooked barley so I added that right before serving.  Before I added the barley I had to skim the fat. I had nearly a half inch of fat floating on the top so I did that before adding the beef back in. The aroma from the cooking soup was wonderful and you could smell and taste the rosemary. This was incredibly delicious.

My soups and one pot dinners are what get my kids to come over for dinner on the weekends lol; this one got some serious raves!  The only thing I did differently was to add diced potato instead of the carrots as my son doesn't like them.  This was the best beef barley I've made, and has just become my go-to recipe.  Very good!

This tasted great! It was a perfect, comforting meal. I did have to use chuck roast and beef broth because that is what I had, and I did not have rosemary so I subbed Italian seasoning(which has rosemary in it) in the same measurement amount. I also added some frozen peas in the last 10 mins, and do have to admit that I did not use the horseradish.

So good, but really, would Chef John ever lead us astray?
Even my slightly picky 7 year old who doesn't like stew, or soup, liked this. Definitely making this again.

I really enjoyed this stew.  I did add a little more chicken broth, possible an additional cup and a half,  but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I thought the stew was flavorful and the meat was tender.  I received several compliments on this dish.  In the future I may use a little less beef since I tend to prefer less meat than others.

This  was the Best Beef Barley soup I have ever made !! I think the chicken stock  gave it better flavor than adding beef stock.
I also cut down on the amount of garlic and I omitted the horseradish for other family members (personal preferences). So 5 stars!!

I've made this a lot of times and with only a few minor changes/additions/exclusions. 1. I omit the horseradish. 2. I don't use chicken BROTH, I use homemade stock, either chicken or beef. 3. I add a heaping tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to it to give it more of a "mouthfeel".  I don't like watery soups/stews/tagines.  But all in all, the flavor profile is right on.  A lot of people shy away from shanks, beef or pork when they really shouldn't.  There's a lot of flavor in them!

Chef John has never led me astray with his recipes, and this stew was no different! I didn't use beef shank because my local store didn't have it. I used a cheaper cut instead (still bone-in) and it came out absolutely delicious and it melted in my mouth! I also added sliced mushrooms with the barley, which I will definitely do again.

I thought this was great. I made some changes to the recipe just because I wanted to add potatoes and mushrooms; I also added extra broth and made a slurry with broth and flour and added it for thickness. I also added a generous shake or 3 of worcestershire sauce and doubled the tomato paste for extra richness and flavor. Also, I used chuck roast cut into bite size chunks and dredged them in a seasoned flour mixture  before browning. The sauce sticks to the beef so much nicer with the floured coating.

Like most of Chef John's, this recipe was fantastic.  I couldn't find shank steak so substituted chuck steaks instead.  I browned the steaks whole then cubed them later before adding them back in.  I think they got a better browning that way.  It seems like if you cube before you brown you get too much steam.

The slow simmer had the beef perfect in about three hours.  So tender but not dry like you find if you cook too fast or use the wrong cut.  

I doubled.  It made enough for one meal for me, and a meal later this week with my son who is a big eater.  Might still have some leftovers.  

I highly recommend.

pretty good.  The first time we made with leftover rib roast, which is fabulous.  Now doing with the cut it calls for.  We double it.  Better the second day.  We let the meat cook the night before and skim fat off in the morning.  Hold it in case we need it, but last time we sure did not.  Then finish basically per instructions, except we used a can of diced tomatoes bc I didn't have paste on hand. Eat that night,  that is first day.  Next day leftovers are great!

There were two changes. I used the whole can of tomato paste instead of 2 table spoons (did not want to waste the rest of the can). I cooked the meat 3 hours and left the meat in when I added the pearl barley for the last hour. Made two large servings (one I ate the next night). Very filling, the gravy was thick and flavorful. I used chicken bullion instead of chicken broth (for me there is no real taste difference except maybe salt content). The stew can easily be made into a soup by adding extra liquid (water, broth, or bullion). Extra veggies can also be added. The barley had a nice chewy texture not at all mushy. The shank meat was so tender I could easily break it up with my spoon. I will definitely make this again and even use it for a beef barley soup base.

This recipe is fabulous..I did make some significant changes based on what I had available, but this recipe is a great foundation for the changes and is going in my recipe box. Changes as follows:

1. Pot Roast instead of beef shanks
2. replaced onion and celery with leeks
3. omitted tomato paste and garlic
4. thyme instead of rosemary
5. hulless barley instead of pearl barley which I added in about half way through because it takes 45 minutes to cook
6.  shredded brussel sprouts instead of parsley which i added when i took the stew off the heat
7. a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes.

Used 1.5 lbs of chuck roast. Diced it and browned it before going into the slow cooker on low for 4 hours. Sautéed veggie and add into the slow cooker on high for another 4 hours. Put barley at the last hour. Big mistakes. Would put them in with the veggie next time. The stew was a little watery and was thickened on stovetop for 15 min. Would brown the meat in three big slices and then cut them into 1'x1' cubes next time. Overall good favor. Would make it again for sure.

Awesome dish and so easy. Instead of shank I used cubes of stewing beef. Added 1/4 cup ketchup for little extra tang. Followed everything else exactly. Served over mashed potatoes, whole family loved it.

Excellent!  I had to go to a butcher to get the beef shank, but it was worth it!  This is very thick ... more of a soup than a stew.  I did add an extra cup of beef broth to thin it out just a little, but not too much.  Unlike a lot of soup recipes, this doesn't make a huge amount - would probably double it and freeze some the next time.  (Couldn't find fresh horseradish, but will look for it in the future - guessing it would be a good addition to this delicious soup!)

Fantastic stew recipe.  Beef shanks give the stew an awesome boney/marroey aroma and flavor.  Barley has an amazing texture.  Another great one from Chef John.

Easy and delicious.  Realized I didn't have barley at the last minute so left the beef in the pot and used rice, and it was still very good. Made the house smell so good all afternoon. Thanks!

This was awesome!  I couldn't find beef shank at the grocery store, so we used 2 lbs of "stew" meat instead.  Also, ended up needing 2 extra cups of chicken broth during the last step.  The suggested times seemed to be right on as well.  Well done Chef John, well done!

I made a few changes to the recipe and wonder what others think.

First off I used beef broth not chicken broth as I wanted a real deep beef flavor. 

I doubled the broth quantity as I wanted it more soup like, rather than thick like a stew. It turned out pretty thick anyway but is definitely more soup than stew.

I used one top sirloin steak for my beef wanting something a little more tender.  I will try shank next time.

I also want to try it without the tomato paste and wonder if anyone else has tried this.

Lastly, I kept the meat in the mixture the entire time, I didn't remove it when I added the barley.

It turned out great.  Thanks Chef John for this.
