This soup is great!  Just like my Babcia makes.  Add a bay leaf when simmering---remember to take it out.  Also, I sauteed the onion till golden, THEN added the other ingredients.  To make it VERY good, add 1/2 of heavy cream to the pot after it's all done cooking (don't boil it with the cream in it...).

This was an excellent soup.  All my family loved it.  I took the advice of some of the previous cooks and saut√©ed the kielbasa and one whole onion until golden brown.  I did not use two onions, that would have been way too much for us.      Once sauteed I added the kielbasa and onions with the celery, carrots cut in quarters, and the red potatoes to the water in a big pot.  For seasoning I added about 1 1/2 to 2 tsp. of dill, parsley, minced garlic, pepper, crushed bay leaves, about 1/4 tsp salt and 3 cubes of bouillon.  Once served, I topped it with some DUBLINER cheese by Kerrygold.  Its a cheese imported from Ireland so I don't know how easy it is to find, I just happened to come across it ... but it topped it perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good.  I did make a few additions--used chicken broth instead of water, added salt & pepper, minced garlic, parsley & dill.  This soup is 5 stars with the additions I made.  Thanks, I will be making this again & again.

Super fast, everyone liked it - easy 5 stars.  Of course, I made changes.  I didn't use 2 pounds of meat, I only used one pound of kielbasa, which I sauteed with one chopped onion.  To the pot I added the bag of baby carrots, celery, 4 red potatoes (chopped), one sweet potato (peeled and chopped), and 1/2 cup red lentils.  I used chicken stock and added Mrs. Dash and salt and pepper.  Big hit as the lentils thickened it up and added extra protein without breaking the bank.  I cooked it for about 2 hours at simmer and it came out really good.  I was tempted to add spinach or peas, some more color, but I am glad I left it as is.  Great last minute meal maker.

As is, this recipe is tasteless even with a bit of salt.  I made it according to recipe and when I tasted it, ended up having to do A LOT of doctoring just to make it palatable.  I read the rest of the reviews and realized that not ONE person rated it according to the recipe but according to the way they made it. Come on, people, these kind of reviews are NOT helpful! Who has the flippin time to read all the reviews to get the REAL recipe that is being rated!   I am not a picky eater but even I would not have eaten this original recipe unless it was the only thing to eat after not having had food for a week!

We really like this. Plus it was just really easy to make. I used homemade chicken broth for the liquid because I had it. I also added parsnips and about a cup of chopped Napa Cabbage (because I had it) Very tasty and really very easy. I will make this one again.

This seemed to be the kind of soup that improved with time.  Being only my husband and me, we had leftovers for a couple of days, and as time passed the flavor increased.  I cut up the carrots and the potatos to bite size, and sauteed the onions and half of the sausage before adding to the pot.  Also, I had intended to use chicken broth instead of water, but forgot.  I found myself wishing I had.  Though the soup was still okay, the water seemed to tone down the flavor a lot, so next time we will probably try broth, and sautee all of the sausage and onion first.  Can't wait to try it again!

Pretty Good.  Easy recipe that you can play with a bit.  I would use a little less kielbasa, the soup had a bit more fat in it then I wanted.

I thought this was good, but it needed something, maybe some spices. I saw the other reviews added a few things. I would have given it four, but for over 700 calories, it wouldn't be worth it for me to make again since that would be half of what I would eat in a day.

This is a very good soup!! Just delicious and so easy (I didn't even take the time to peel the potatoes) . Hit the spot on a cold winter night.  I wasn't quite sure how much water to add.  Will add a little less next time turned out a little runny (my fault).  I also added a little salt,pepper and parsley.  Can't wait to try again. Thanks for the great recipe!! Yummy!!

This soup was great! Instead of water, I used chicken broth, added minced garlic and browned the sausage and onions and celery togther in olive oil before putting in the pot, like another reviewer suggested. I love kale, so I added it to this soup. OMG!! it was great!!

This is one of the easiest recipes I've ever made, and one of the best too. Use chicken broth and add pepper for extra. Great for big groups.

I was expecting this to be kind of blah but was pleasantly surprised.  I sauteed the onions, carrots, and celery in a very small amount of olive oil with salt & pepper.  Then added the potatoes and sausage and sauteed that for just a few more minutes before adding water.  I was surprised how tasty it was with just using salt, pepper and water.

This soup was great! I made a few changes as others had suggested. I added garlic to the ingredients, and sauteed it along with the sausage, onions and celery. I also halved the kielbasa to just one pound. My husband and I both thought there was plenty of keilbasa. I also boiled it in beef broth instead of water. I added oregano, thyme, 2 bay leaves, and a little Italian seasoning. Wonderful and will be making again soon!

I really like this soup which is not only very easy to make, it also hits the spot quite superbly. And, I certainly use my own chicken stock instead of water, just like my ol' Granny did many years ago.

I sauteed the sausage and onions a bit first.  I also added some Mrs. Dash seasoning and used beef broth instead of water. All this didn't change the recipe that much.  I just thought using water would be too bland. Maybe next time I'll mash the potatoes a bit like one rater said. Good recipe.  Definitely worth trying!

Delicious soup.  I'm giving it 4 stars because of the amount of fat and calories in the original.  I modified the recipe by using a mix of low-sodium chicken and beef broths, and using turkey kielbasa.  I also used cannellini beans and pinto beans in place of the potatoes for more fiber and protein.  Sauteing the onions, celery, and some added garlic with the kielbasa prior to adding the beans, carrots, and liquid really pumps up the flavor, too.  To make individual bites easier, cut the baby carrots into 2 or 3 pieces each.

This was easy and great tasting...  I added 1/3 lb of bacon, a little fennel, dill, garlic, paprika (no idea what I'm doing...ha)  Here is my problem...  I used 2 quarts of chicken broth and about 8 oz of water.  How do I figure out how many servings are now in the pot?  How much is a serving?

This is a winner, I used diced red potatoes and a can of carrots/peas and one of celery soup. 2 bay leaves, pinch of dill,pinch of ground cummin, and 1/2 cup of low fat half and half. I sliced two smoked sausages and cooked the onions with them, with 1teaspoon of bacon drippings. Awesome!

My husband thought at first that this was a waste of polish sausage when I started to make it. After it was done however, he and my kids asked me to make it again! Very quick and easy. Will be making it again in the future.

I used fat free low sodium CHICKEN BROTH instead of water, added garlic, a few good shakes of Mrs. Dash original seasoning, and some shredded cabbage I needed to use during the last 10 minutes..... used my potato masher to smash the potato to make this very thick - EVERYONE loved it!!!

I added chicken bouillon, green cabbage, and added kidney beans (dry) to the broth. When beans were done, I added potatoes and cabbage. My family liked it as did I.

I made this soup this past weekend for children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, they all loved it.  This is for sure a five star.  By the way I used russet potatoes cut in six pieces I'm sure it couldn't have been better with any other potato use the potatoes you usually use.  WONDERFUL SOUP.

We thought this was a nice soup for a colder day. I did add black pepper to taste and cut the veggies smaller to ensure cooking time would be good to go. I'm definitely going to make this again.

We finely chopped the onion, celery, and carrots in the food processor, then sauteed the sausage with those veggies and a clove of garlic until the onion softened.  Then, since we needed to use it up, added a couple cups of chopped kale.  When that had wilted a bit, we added the potatos, some black pepper, a couple bay leaves, and water to cover.  After simmering for an hour, it was some pretty awesome stuff.

I used chicken broth instead of water, saut√©ed the onion & the PEELED sausage & 4 cloves of garlic & added a splash of white wine. I then cooked it for 1 hour with the sweet potatoes & carrots, added leeks, parsley & dill, and 1/2 c of dried lentils. Adding the potatoes at the end kept them from getting mushy...and it was DIVINE!
