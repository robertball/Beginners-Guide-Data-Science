This is really good.  I sauteed the onions w/ fresh mushrooms untill tender, then added fresh chopped garlic.  Not to make so many dishes and to keep the peas from getting overcooked/mushy and to maintain the vibrant green, I added them frozen to the sauteed mushroom mixture and stirred for a few minutes untill warmed through and cooked to a  tender crisp.  Thx, will make again.

I like this recipe a lot but will caution that it cannot "sit" while you are preparing other dishes -- the peas did not "hold up" well from a presentation standpoint. So, if you are making this recipe, plan on doing it last and taking it directly to the table once its hot.

I think this would've been better as written, rather than with my changes ... but you can learn from my mistakes :-(  I used canned small peas instead of frozen, but they ended up being crushed no matter how carefully I stirred them.  I also forgot the thyme, which would've added some much needed flavor to the recipe.  Finally, I used rehydrated dried minced onion instead of fresh, because I don't like fresh onions.  Well, if you don't like onions, just leave them out, don't use dried.  WITHOUT my changes, I think this would've been pretty tasty!

Be sure to use sweet onions and saute them until they are soft. I've made this several times and it's much better this way. It's a great way to dress up plain peas!

I sauteed fresh mushrooms along with the garlic and onions.  This was a nice change from plain old peas.  It went great with mashed potatoes and meatloaf.

This is a great way to make peas more attractive. I used fresh pressed garlic cloves instead of minced and fresh mushrooms. I kept everything else the same. This was really a great additional side served with mashed potatoes. Will make again.

We all really liked these.  The boys all picked out the mushrooms and while I love mushrooms, I didn't really think they added too much.  The flavor with the onions, thyme, garlic etc was great with the peas.  Next time I make it, if I don't have any mushrooms handy I won't worry about them.

I loved this tasty dish.  I did omit the sugar and I didn't even cook the peas just added them to the pan after cooking the other ingredients and they were perfect.

Wow, this was so SO delish!  It was only a side dish, but it was my favorite part of the whole meal!  I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  It is simple to make but it tastes absolutely amazing!
Followed recipe to the letter - wouldn't recommend a single change.  Thank you!

I thought it was okay, but my husband said it tasted like "dirt."  I think it was the combination of the thyme with the peas, which we didn't like at all.  Next time I'll make it without the thyme.

My husband and I love this recipe! He likes to prepare it with our home grown Shitake mushrooms. We substituted Italian seasoning for the thyme and it worked well.

Too much sugar and I realized I only like thyme with my Thanksgiving dinner.  I also realized I only like peas used sparingly (but a must have) with fettucine, beef stew and my home town store's luscious potato salad.

Made these for Thanksgiving, they were sooo good. I used fresh baby portabello mushrooms, and sauted them. Also, used some poultry seasoning to liven' it up, because I was out of thyme.

Love this. Easy and attractive, a great way to dress up plain frozen peas, and I can't wait to try it with fresh. I did use fresh mushrooms rather than jarred, though.

I like the recipe better with fresh mushrooms and less thyme. Less sugar, too. With modifications, it is great. Recipe makes peas more tasty and interesting to serve. Recipe "as is" is just okay.

These peas were ok but I think they would be a lot better with fresh peas not frozen. I don't think I'd make them again though.

I made this recipe as directed but did leave out the onions (personal preference).  This was easy to prepare, used ingredients I always have on hand, and had a nice, mild flavor that would pair well with many main dishes.

My mom used to make this but used olive oil in place of the butter and did not use sugar, just a slight pinch of salt and pepper. She called it peas and onions. Fresh or frozen peas are the best, does not taste the same with canned peas.

These are the best peas I've ever had!  I will definitely make these again.  I did not make any changes.  However, I might replace part of the butter with olive oil to make it healthier next time.  I really liked the seasoning.  I loved the sweetness from the sugar and I also loved the thyme.  I recommend using the sugar!

Use real mushrooms!  Why do people use those little cans of rubber?  Even my pea-hating daughter loved this dish.

I probably shouldn't review this because I adjusted quantities to fit our tastes and used fresh mushrooms.  Nevertheless, I did use all the ingredients and we really loved this combination.

Enjoyed these, but used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I quite often put mushrooms and butter with my peas, but the garlic, onion and thyme made this a little different.

Made this for a meal cooked for my parents and they loved the dish.  The dish went well with stuffed pork tenderloin.  Will use this recipe again. I used fresh mushrooms which I sauted in the butter first then followed the rest if the recipe.

This was good if a little mild. I added some allspice, used olive oil instead of butter and eliminated the sugar. Next time I'd up the spices and maybe add some soy sauce as well. We had it over mujaddarah -- rice with lentils.

I have been making peas and mushrooms for years. I use fresh mushrooms, sliced, and a dab of butter or heart healthy margarine. That's all. I saute my mushroom slices with butter in a skillet, then add the frozen peas, cover with a cup or so of water and boil till the water is almost gone. You can add a sprinkle of salt if you want to, but it is good just as it is. SOOOO simple.

A nice change from regular peas!  I used fresh mushrooms as that's all I had.  I sauteed them with the onions and garlic, so I added about a teaspoon of olive oil to the butter.  Will make again.

I used canned peas, 1 tablespoon of butter and half of a small onion. I thought the end product was pretty good. I might try to add some spicy seasoning next time.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I halved the salt/sugar amounts and used 1T of butter. A nice change from plain old peas! Next time I will only use a pinch of thyme. I love seasonings, but I want them to enhance the dish, not overpower it.  Thanks Gail!

Very tasty!  I made this as instructed, except replaced the canned mushrooms with fresh, quartered mushrooms.  This was a nice change from the basic butter sauce for this dish - nice flavors! Glad I tried it - my mom absolutely loved it!!!

Sorry that I'm the first to give this less than 5 stars... There isn't anything wrong with this recipe at all, but we would just prefer a side of peas and/or a side of garlic mushrooms. There was just something a little weird about the combination of flavors. Thanks anyway, Gail.

Like others I sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions till tender before adding the garlic and peas. The thyme was a nice addition but didn't see the need for sugar. Thank you, and I will make these again

I know people get annoyed when someone changes a recipe and then rates that changed recipe. So, fair warning: I changed the recipe! But I'm giving it five stars, so no harm has been done to the original recipe. My changes: fresh mushrooms (8 oz.) instead of jarred or canned; extra virgin olive oil instead of butter; somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 cup of chopped scallions instead of regular onion (just because I had them on hand and needed to use them up); and a 13-ounce bag of frozen baby peas (Birds Eye) rather than mature peas (or canned); and no sugar, salt or pepper. The garlic and thyme were per the recipe. The result was very nice, and definitely worth doing again in the future. UPDATE: substituting fresh snowpeas (preferably young, thin and tender ones, rather than older, fatter and tougher ones) for the regular (English) peas is also delicious!

I saw this in the April/May issue and decided to make it.
This was so easy to make and really had great flavor.  I used frozen baby sweet peas, and put them in the very last thing, I do not like over cooked veggies.  Very good.

I loved it. I would add the mushrooms a few minutes before the peas so that they have a chance to soften with the onions. Also, a splash of white wine doesn't hurt!

Kind of bland. Will "jazz" it up a bit next time.

I was looking for a pea recipe that was a bit different when I found this one. I followed the recommendations of some other raters and used fresh mushrooms that I sauted in butter with the onions and garlic (I used garlic paste). I threw in the frozen peas at the end and let them cook through on low. Very good recipe that I'll make again. Thanks for sharing!

I made with fresh peas and fresh mushrooms.  I just cooked the peas a little longer.
Wow!

This is a very good recipe as is. Since I had fresh crimini mushrooms, I sauteed them after the onions and garlic softened. The only change is that I  added a teaspoon of white wine and let it evaporate. Last, I added the peas. Excellent!

I made a diabetes friendly version of this dish: I added more mushrooms, less peas and skipped the sugar. It was really tasty.

I skipped the sugar altogether and added a bit of cayenne. Put more garlic than specified in the recipe as well. 
Came out very well and will be making this again.

Best peas I've ever tasted!!! I left the onion as short strips and sautéed them with sliced garlic. I also left out the mushrooms and used baby peas - I added them frozen. Couldn't stop snacking on them until suppertime!

Fabulous just as it is written.    The second time I made it, I added a little balsamic vinegar, just to try it.  Really good, too.   Love this.

Used shitake mushrooms. Did not care for it.  Try with reg mushrooms.

I did make some changes, but only flavor changes per what I had on hand. I didn't see where using butter was beneficial, so next time I'll try a healthier substitute like coconut oil. The amazing alteration was the Monterey brand marinated mushrooms. HO-LY SMOKES!!! I enjoy giving new recipes a chances as they come, but I think the extra in the mushrooms did it for me. Thank you greatly for this recipe.

This was a great way to liven up frozen peas. I used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the garlic and onions and then drained off the liquid. Also added the thyme before I added the peas. Thanks Molsom7

Great flavor!  I will always use fresh mushrooms for this recipe. The mushrooms have to be sauted first & then the onion & garlic.  Cook the peas until JUST tender; otherwise they will get "mushy".

This was quick to make and was very good. My mother who doesn't like peas even liked it. I didn't use the sugar and I don't think it was necessary but I used all the other ingredients. I used it as a veg. side dish for Beef Braciola  and pasta w/ tomato sauce

This was pretty good, but the thyme was definitely a bit much... and I love thyme. I omitted the onion and used only 1 T of margarine, instead of 2 T of butter. Will definitely make again, probably cutting the thyme in half.

Great recipe! I used smaller mushrooms though! I actually made salmon with it and placed the salmon on top of the peas instead of using it as a "side dish" it tasted great! i also put french fried onions on it, YUMMY! thanks for the great recipe!
