This recipe is spot on and stays true to the original Brown Hotel recipe. As someone who does not like turkey, the rich, creamy mornay sauce made it delightfully palatable.  The sauce was perfectly smooth and silky and tasted like an elegant white country gravy.   Pecorino cheese makes all of the difference in the world.  It’s pricey, but well worth the indulgence. I believe I added at least 1/4tsp. or more of black pepper,  about 1/8tsp. nutmeg(I love nutmeg), and skipped the cayenne pepper.  I used up some leftover turkey, so I didn’t make that part of the recipe.  A thick Texas style toast is a must--buttered and grilled in a skillet until golden brown.   Then assembled as directed.  So good!  Did I mention it’s rich?  Mmmm!

Wonderful, I did not have the 'de provencia or what ever spice it called for. I found bakery bread with that in it, which added a wonderful flavor. Yummy

another winner from chef john.  i followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty. the only snafu was that i discovered my broiler is on the fritz when i went to finish them so i had to finish them using the hot oven.  regardless it was still extremely tasty. i used the pecorino romano but i could definitely see where a good sharp cheddar would work too.

I live in Louisville Ky and have had the hot brown at the Brown Hotel and it is amazing! I made this hot brown and it was ok but not like the original. The 2 tablespoons of salt it calls for I'm so glad i didn't put that in this recipe! I used 1 teaspoon instead and it was very salty!!  For one thing  you have the salt from the cheese too. I'm a  salt lover but this was so salty. Other than that it was just ok.

Another excellent recipe from Chef John.  The Mornay needed quite a bit of seasoning, and I ended up using at least 3/4 cup of Romano to get it just right.  I've never been to Louisville to have the original, so I have nothing to compare against, but the final result was really really good!  That tomato is just PERFECT in there.  I have a lot of turkey and sauce left over, so I'm going to try a few modifications tomorrow.  I think I'll try  using toasted rye or pumpernickle bread and slice the turkey a bit thinner and add a few thin slices of ham.  Can't wait.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious treat! Next time I think I'll try spreading a bit of mustard on the bread.

Made as directed except used Parmesan reggiano as I could not find pecorino romano, and used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was decadent as is... would have been way to rich using heavy cream.  This was fantastic... so good. We will definitely make this again and again.
