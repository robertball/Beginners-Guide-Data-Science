Made it twice now! I love this sprinkled on my morning oatmeal, and stir in a little applesauce or dried blueberries! Yum! Thanks!

This is delicious. Perfect blend of flavors. Did not  miss the cloves which I usually used in apple pie.

This is perfect for those of us who don't care for cloves, which most blends have.  The cardamom helps smooth the cinnamon flavor too. This was good in a smoothie as well as an addition to homemade applesauce. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us.
