This is more of a dressing for potato salad than tartar sauce.  Leave out the mustard, add sweet pickle relish, dill pickle juice, dill weed, minced onion, lemon juice, and a dash of lemon pepper to the mayonaise.

I have made almost this same recipe since our Safeway stopped carrying Nalley Tartar Sauce... I don't use mustard, though. I take 2-3 Tbsp of pickle juice and mix it in.  It gives is a thinner consistency and you don't get they mayonnaise-y flavor.

I reduced this recipe to two servings, but otherwise followed it exactly. It is definitely quick, and very tasty. I always have these ingredients on hand, so I will use this recipe again and again! If you prefer your tartar sauce with a dill flavor, just use dill relish instead of sweet. I served this with Cod Fish Cakes from Allrecipes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe. I didn't measure anything. Just used the ingredients to taste. I kept forgetting to buy tartar sauce and made this on the fly. I'll never purchase tartar sauce again!! Thank you...thanks to all who left comments.

Great quick basic recipe.  I prefer dill over sweet pickles, so I substituted.  And for a little spice I added horseradish sauce and a pinch of white pepper.  I believe that by using canola mayonnaise the fat and cholesterol #'s will be lower.

I was very pleased with the results. I halved the recipe because that was all we needed for the meal and added just a tad more relish.

Good in a pinch, but I prefer the more authentic tasting versions. Nevertheless, it served its purpose well and tasted fine. I made a half batch to serve with salmon cakes. I used Dijon mustard instead of the yellow, splash of pickle juice for the lemon juice, added some chopped up bread & butter pickles, a bit of lemon pepper and tarragon. Definitely let this sit in the fridge a few hours to meld the flavours.

I made fried fish for dinner, and realized I didn't have any tartar sauce.  Came here, found this one, and had it made in about a minute.  It is wonderful, my whole family loves it, and it saves me from having to worry about ever being out of tartar sauce again. Thanks!

I usually have a jar of Trader Joe's tartar sauce in the fridge for when I make fish sticks for the kids, tonight I was out.  I made this very quickly and it was delicious!  I had to stop my daughter from sticking her finger in the bowl.

Good recipe - like the poster says, it uses ingredients you have on hand. If you have capers on hand they give the sauce a more tart flavour if you don't like the sweetness of the relish. Just chop them up first. (I'd use a tablespoon or more, but that's just me)

This recipe was a lifesaver for our fish sticks tonight. Easy stuff that we had on hand (except didn't have lemon). It was pretty good and took about a minute to whip together.

This was so fast, easy and tasty. I used Miracle Whip and added a little more mustard and sweet relish to offset the Miracle Whip sweetness. It tasted great!  I'll never buy prepared tartar sauce again!

If you only have dill relish, don't fret. Use a couple pinches of sugar per serving and you're in business. I also used lime juice instead of lemon, and lemon pepper instead of plain pepper. Turned out delicious.

Was out of tartar sauce and made this in a pinch.  Chopped up some dill pickles instead of sweet relish and it was perfect.  I might not ever buy it from the store again.  So quick and easy and can be tweaked to your perfection.

This is the perfect tartar sauce for me. Very easy, and it uses ingredients most of us have on hand. I loved the consistency and I've been cooking so long, I didn't even need to measure the ingredients. Nice and simple, as a tartar sauce should be!

This is the best tartar sauce I have ever had! I sometimes substitute finely chopped dill pickle for the relish, and that's pretty good, too.

My family and I loved this.  I did adjust it to suit my tastes by using dill relish instead of sweet and really upping the amount of dill relish and its juices compared to the other ingredients.  I also added onion powder as another reviewer suggested.  Great recipe!

Excellent flavor when you need tartar sauce in a pinch.  I might add more relish next time.  But overall, it was very good.

Very good. I didn't measure anything but eyeballed it and added onion powder. Glad I'll never have to buy that nasty bottled stuff again. This is so much better. Thanks for posting this.

Definitely a keeper!
I used what I had on hand and it turned out great. Must add a bit of dijon and dill pickle juice to cut the sweetness of the sweet relish. I will never buy tartar sauce again!

I don’t like to correct anyone’s recipe but this needs 2 teaspoons of mustard and about 4 or 5 teaspoons of dill relish or sweet relish w/the juice (don’t drain it off. Then it will taste like tarter sauce. Without the additional teaspoons it just tastes like mayonnaise.

This was super easy!  We ran out of bought stuff, so I made this quick. I didn't have relish, so I threw a couple fork fulls of hamburger pickles into the ninja, added the mayo, mustard, and lemon juice to the chopped pickles, and it was perfect. I might not ever buy again

I replaced prepared mustard with just a hint of ground mustard, and used chopped dill pickles instead of relish.  I also added onion powder, a dash of apple cider vinegar, and a pinch of stevia powder.  Not bad.

This is a great basic recipe. I will definitely make this again.  I made it as specified, but then doubled the relish after tasting because we tend to like a lot of relish in my house.  It was a hit!

3 stars because it taught me how I could make it how I enjoy. Less mustard, dill and sweet relish, lemon juice and a capful of vinegar!

made exactly as given, just a half batch, and added Dill weed, that's what puts the Tar in Tartar.  Might not use the mustard next time, depends n what hubby thinks.  This is a much more sophisticated sauce than the flavored Mayo in the grocery stores.

The only thing I added was 1 more tsp of sweet relish. The secret is to let it sit for at least 30 minutes before enjoying. Will never buy tarter sauce in the store ever again!

I made this but, it seemed just a touch bland for my taste. Added couple tsp minced onion and a pinch of thyme. Rocks!! This one would be good starting point for any style you wanted!! On its own could see it for those who like things tame and children.

I use this recipe every time we serve fish (it tastes SO MUCH BETTER than any retail brand).  I also make this with dill relish (instead of sweet) and it tastes just like I remember it as a child. I share this recipe with anyone who asks! A definite keeper!

Great basic recipe!  I did add some extras....a clove of garlic, some old bay seasoning, some lemon juice and fresh dill from the garden.  Oh, and I didn't have any sweet pickle relish (unusual as I always have some) so I added a few pinches of sugar for a tad of sweetness.  I also added a tad of sour cream to the mayo.  As others have said,  don't think I'll ever buy tartar sauce at the store ever again!!  It was EXCELLENT!

I made half a batch of this and it turned out OK. I added extra relish (for my son) and added salt and pepper to it. I think I will switch up the recipe a bit to bring it better to my taste, though. 

It is a definite quick and easy solution for anyone. If you don't like sweet pickle relish then switch it to dill. 

I will be adding a few more items and will update this when I have found a viable solution for my taste buds. I can't stand store bought tartar sauce or anything processed. My taste buds are weird. Some say I taste too much, lol!!

I've never used mustard in tartar sauce, and I thought it was fine in this. Although, I think spicy brown would be better than yellow mustard next time. I used 2 Tablespoons relish instead of 2 teaspoons as I didn't think it had enough flavor or texture.

I made this recipe for the 1st time. This is really easy and taste great. The only thing I did was cut the mayo in half using 1/2 cup and I added 1 more tsp. of the pickles.

Simple and easy. It's a great base to tweak and make your own. I'd use it on more than fish.

My husband has told me not to buy any other form of tartar sauce again. We make it on demand, takes 30 seconds, and even our toddler requests it. Great, easy, tasty recipe.

It was a good basic recipe, as I liked all the ingredients (except I used dill relish instead of sweet relish).  However, I didn't like the proportion of mayonnaise to relish, so I tripled the amount of relish.  Turned out delicious!

I use dill relish and add 1/2 - 1 teaspoon (to taste) of raw sugar.  Makes it smooth and rich.

The mustard in this just didn't cut it for me. I thought it was more like a dressing for potato salad, and I saw another reviewer said the same. I made a small amount, but added more mayo and relish, with some garlic and onion powder, which didn't improve it any. I just wouldn't add mustard to this.

Very good! I used hot dog relish since it already has the mustard and some spices. I also used about a tsp of horseradish sauce and dill juice.  Will definitely make again!

As with all recipes -see what I did there-taste taste taste.  I used serracha mustard  and  added a little INGLEHOFFERS creamy horseradish for a good kick..loved the sweet tart bite and remember...the key to tartar sauce no matter what you add...SWEET RELISH...if you don't see the bits then that ain't it.

Next time I will add more sweet pickle relish and a bit of dill pickle relish and I used Dijon mustard instead of Yellow.  I used more lemon as well.  No more store bought stuff for me :)

This is a fairly good recipe but it lacks from not including a Tbsp or so of super finely diced sweet onion. When I make this recipe and add the onion it's definitely a four or five star simple but delicious recipe. It also works very well with lite mayo.

Good as is, but we like a little more flavor in our food, so I doubled the relish and mustard, added about 2 tsp of dill pickle juice, and some cracked black pepper.

This recipe saved my dinner last night!  I came home from the grocery store intending to make the Classic Fish and Chips recipe from AR and before I was finished making it, I realized I was out of tartar sauce.  A quick search on AR and I found this.  It was delicious and, I think, tasted better than store bought. I think the ones on the market are much sweeter than this recipe and I just think it's so much better! Soooo, no more buying tartar sauce at the supermarket.  I will be keeping this one :-)

Very good recipe.  Easy, too.  It seemed to need a little something so I doubled the sweet relish which I think balanced the mayo.  I like the mustard addition.   I made a large batch for a men's homeless shelter and they gobbled it up!  I was in a hurry and didn't have the opportunity to let it marry overnight.

I made a second batch adding a 1/4 tsp lemon pepper and a tsp of pickle juice and gave it overnight to blend.  The result was the best tartar sauce ever!

Add: a Lot more relish, like 4 tsp. or, whatever you want, salt, pepper to taste, also some finely chopped onions (or onion powder), a dash of oil and a teaspoon of white vinegar and a mashed egg yolk and you'll be happier. Tartar sauce ingredients and quantities are really just a matter of personal taste.

Yummy.  I wanted a fish sandwich with tartar but no tartar or sauce. This recipe was  made with condiments left over from takeouts and lemon juice. 1 pack of mayo, 2 packs of relish, 1 pack of mustard and a tsp on lemon. Add more lemon juice but be careful, you don't want it watery.  Quick and easy.

This tartar sauce really hit the spot. I made a vegan version with "Just Mayo." My wife and I both thought it was awesome and I'll definitely make it again.

Making this, I was concerned that the color was a little yellow, and it did have a slight mustard after taste. I prefer dill pickles to sweet, but I followed the recipe exactly. When I realized that their was a slight mustard after taste, I decided to add 1 tsp dill pickle juice and it came out perfect!

Great recipe! I'm not usually a fan of anything that is mayonnaise-based, but this was a great, easy tartar sauce recipe.

I agree with another reviewer that this is more like a potato salad dressing. It tasted like a tangy mayonnaise to me. Added more homemade sweet relish, lemon pepper, dried chopped onion and some lemon juice. Helped it taste more like tartar sauce to me, but I think I will try a different recipe next time.

I reduce the recipe to two servings, but use the amount of relish and lemon juice for the four servings. Super easy and great tasting. Thanks so much.

I would give it 5 stars but I didn't use the mustard, so I can't rate it correctly. I thought it was wonderful and will use again, often. was better after it sat for an hour. i did notice it was "mayoish" but by the time i used it, the flavors had married and it was great. did use a bit more sweet relish because i was trying to use up the jar, so i eyeballed a little more mayo and lemon juice.

This is a pretty good recipe; after making fish the main course for tonight's dinner, I found that we were out of tartar sauce. This works well though it's odd to see the sauce such a color. To mine I also added an approximate teaspoon of Cream of Tartar, and added the juices of both sweet and dill pickles. I'll definitely use this base recipe again, though, it really couldn't be easier AND has gone over well in this house (among those who eat tartar sauce, anyway).

Worked great as a last minute thing, but not a whole lot of flavor. Will try again when I have more time to give it my own twist.
