Very good. I made a half-recipe, used boneless chicken thighs and finished the cacciatore in the slow cooker (5 hours on low) instead of the oven. I thought the sauce reduced a bit too much in the simmering, so I added another splash of wine and about a half-cup of chicken broth. Always looking for recipes that I can freeze in single portions for hubby's dinner (I work nights). This fits the bill nicely.

Just delicious! I was hunting for an easy dinner I could prepare ahead for a relatively last minute, casual dinner for company. This was perfect! I started the sauce in the afternoon and left it covered on low, then cooked the chicken a half hour before guests arrived and popped it in the oven. All I had to do was serve a prepped salad and cook the pasta! It was well received and was asked for the recipe (well, being another AR Member, she could find it! Lol!). I Used Italian diced tomatoes, cutting back on the spices. I added more of all the veggies and used just a half a giant Vidalia. Perhaps because it simmered a while, I used a lot more red wine and added some chicken broth, as well. Easily adjusted as needed. Could have been because I used the diced instead of plum but the sauce tasted just a touch bitter to me, so I added a half teaspoon of baking soda to cut the acidity. Loved it and I look forward to making this again! Thanks, Pam!

Fantastic!  Plenty of leftovers and that is great news since it was so delicious!  Next time around I will halve the recipe and use Littleforestelf's review here as a guide.  I love Cacciatore and was surprised at how few recipes there were to choose from, and very surprised how few reviews this one has received.  If you want a great, hearty tasting dish folks, this is the one!

Family loved it!  Cut the recipe in half.  However, because others reviewed that the sauce cooked down, I used the regular amount of wine and tomato paste instead of halving it.  Might use a bit more oregano and basil, but that's a personal seasoning preference.

eat tonight. so I felt a little guilty about  not responding to review after you gave me such a fine meal. old man mike

Great flavors!  This dish has the consistency of a traditional Cacciatore, so it doesn't thicken up like a marinara (and we like that).  The big change that we made was to add seasoning.  First of all, the chicken must be seasoned appropriately (either the meat or the breading).  Plus, the sauce needs more salt for the volume.  That addition was enough to really bring out the flavors of the veggies and the meat... yum!

This was great!  I also made 1/2 but really don't like mushrooms so I omitted those and left the quantity of the other veggies the same to compensate. . Made the sauce then threw it all in a slow cooker with 6 chicken legs. Once the meat falls off the bone I deboned and cooked about 1/2 hr more. Perfect! Did not over cook and mush up the other veggies at all.

This was very good.  I used skinless chicken thighs and a small can of diced tomatoes and a can of puree since I did not have what was suggested.  The sauce will be amazing the second time, I am sure.  I served over spaghetti squash. Yum!

I made it exactly as written and it was okay.  I was looking for a heartier tasting sauce than this tirned out but it still was quite good.
