this is AWESOME, but only beacause I added my own special touches to it. I dont think it would be nearly as good if you follow the recipe as it is. I added red pepper flakes, 2 tablespoons of butter, extra garlic, and a bit of soy sauce while the rice fries in the pan. So good! I'll definitely make this again.

I made a few changes based on past experiences - I saute the onions, garlic & rice in butter and THEN add the water. Because of what I served this time, I replaced the water with chicken broth & a little bit of white wine. Turned out nice!

After reading all of the reviews I made a few changes I browned the rice in butter first.  Then I added the chopped garlic and onion then I added a can of stewed tomatoes and simmered the mix in chicken broth.  
I flavoered the mix with lime pepper, caynne pepper, and little salt. 
Absolutely delicious.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I had to add more butter (1 Tbs), and a little more garlic, I also added a teaspoon of sesame oil, and I had no leftovers at all!

The difference between this and conventionally cooked rice is not obvious other than it makes you wonder why regular rice never tasted this good.  I browned the onion, added the garlic, then added the rice and let it brown a little before adding the water, covering and simmering until done.  A deliciously enhanced basic rice.

Like everyone else, I increased the amount of butter and added another 3 cloves of garlic. I thought that even for a side dish a little colour would be nice so I added some chopped echallots and black pepper.

This turned out great. I wanted a different rice to try tonight and one that would go really well with the five spice chicken I made. This was a good choice, not overpowering. A mellow flavor. 

I'd make this again.

Very good recipe! Like everyone else, I added 1 Tbs butter and some extra garlic. After the garlic and onions I added some frozen carrots and peas, just let them cook for about a min, they thaw fast. Then I added 1 egg and made sure it was cooked and well distributed before adding the rice. Turned out great! Everyone had seconds, didnt have any leftovers.

Simple, Fast, Tasty.  I added Garlic salt for a little more seasoning.  Also added fresh chopped ginger and a dash of fish sauce the 2nd time I made it.

I am a huge fan of Garlic rice. This recipes was good overall. I upped the butter to 1.5 tablespoons instead. It became quite greasy but on the other hand, the rice were well coated with a nice yellow. I added 1/2 teaspoon salt as i was using unsalted butter. I also added some paprika to give it some flavour and a wonderful red tinge. I served with a roasted chicken which was a great combination. Good!

This was ok.  I ended up adding a lot more butter, garlic, and seasoning salt to make it taste like anything.  I added chopped up cooked veggies and firm tofu and made it a main course.  I think this is something that would be better the next day after letting it "marinate" in the fridge all night.

OK, fried rice.  Added many more other spices in addition to those in recipe.  Butter and soy sauce saved the day, otherwise average.

I added more butter (otherwise there isn't much for the rice to be coated with) and I added some steamed carrots, baby corn, bamboo shoots & beans to the rice before serving. This recipe is a great side dish for Chicken Piccata II. :D

This had such a nice flavor! It seems so simple, but its yummy. A little dry for me so I think I will use half milk and half water next time for the rice. Served with "Baked Haddock" & sauteed spinach.

I combined this recipe with a couple other fried rice recipes from here.  I added diced sauteed chicken, peas, and diced carrots.  In addition to the lemon juice I also added 2 T of soy sauce and about 1 t rice vinegar. Very yummy, husband asked for it again soon!

I ended up adding 3 eggs, a tsp of asian garlic chile sauce, extra garlic, teriyaki sauce, and I used a bunch of little green onions rather than a small onion. It was ok. Next time I'd add peas and carrots and maybe bacon.

I’ve made this 4 times and everyone always loves it. The only thing I do differently is to cook the rice the day before and store it in the fridge. Also, I prefer to use basmati rice because it doesn’t tend to get mushy with the second cook.

Liked it a lot. For those looking to be adventerous, add more lemon and mushrooms at the end

Perfect with fish. The bright flavor and citrus touch is just right. When we have grilled fish this is our "go to" side.

The rice had no salt. With salt, the recipe would be interesting enough.

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe - was a nice tasty change from the traditional preparation. The lemon juice in the background added a nice mmmmmmm! factor. Will cook white rice this way from now oon.
