I had to work with what I had on hand, and needed to get rid of a package of bagels.  I took this dip to a meeting, and actually had a girl give me money to make it for her!  The only reason I had left-over is because I didn't cut enough bagel bites up.  Would be good with crackers, pita chips, pretzels, etc...  I made these tweaks: Used probably half a cup green onions (1 bunch), 32 oz of sour cream.  2 8 oz packages of cream cheese.  Blended in blender.  Folded in diced corned beef (diced very small), 2 cups sharp shredded chz, about 1 Tbsp spicy mustard, and 1 tsp garlic powder.  

I added Beau Monde (not sure how much but at least a Tbsp), covered it, and left it in fridge for 12 hours.  This was pretty salty, but still really yummy.  I'm no expert chef, but I'm super proud this is the first non-measured and tweaked recipe I've made that's been this well received.  I only gave four stars because I did tweak it.  Thanks Daisy K.!!!!!!  And Connie O. helping me through the Buzz.

This dip was tasty, easy to make and economical!  I cut the recipe down a bit by eliminating the plain sour cream and one of the packages of cream cheese, but I kept all other ingredients the same.  I thought the dip was good with ritz type crackers, corn tortilla chips and plain potato chips.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, DaisyK!
