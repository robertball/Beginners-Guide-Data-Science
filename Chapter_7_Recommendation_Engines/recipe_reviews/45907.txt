I had plain breadcrumbs so I had to season my own with homemade italian seasoning. I used about a tablespoon. I added 1 tablespoon worchestershire to the beaten eggs, upped the garlic powder to a teaspoon and a half, eliminated the salt and I used black forest ham. I had a heck of a time rolling this, even with the butcher paper. I did get it rolled and smushed back together, but it came apart a little in the baking process. I think if I make this again, I'll let the meat mixture sit fifteen minutes before rolling or chill it an hour or something. It's in the oven now (and smells AMAZING) so I'll update how the family liked it once they've tried it. EDITED: Even as ugly as it came out, it was really tasty. The whole family LOVED it. This one's a keeper. I just have to practice rolling it!

I thought this recipe turned out wonderfully, although I added some things!  I added a bit of ketchup and mustard, along with brown sugar and a touch of balsamic vinaigrette.  I covered it for half of the cook time with foil-it turned out great!

I love meatloaf and infact i would eat it more, but my husband doesnt care for it. Well when i saw cheese in this recipe, i figured hey thats what he likes! Put cheese in anything and he will eat it... He did. Now seriously, i personally thought this was a great recipe. Was not hard at all to make. The taste was excellent. Very differnt and very satisfing. What I might do next time is change the way it is cooked. I did cook it for 2 hours and my center was still way to pink. Maybe if you layer it in a square 9x9 or 8x8. I am not sure, but there has to be a better way. 2 hours is way too much. I really enjoyed eating it though. The next night I heated it up and made sandwiches. We put pickles and mayo on whole wheat bread and it was almost like a burger! This is a keeper, except for the way it is cook, i will come up with a plan for next time..

I gave this 5 stars (this is in comparison to other meatloafs, not recipes in general).  It was excellent (and I don't even like meatloaf!), and sooo fast & easy to put together.  I baked it for an hour- the top and ends were perfectly done, but inside was a little pink.  Next time I'll do as someone suggested and cover with tin foil about 45 minutes in, then bake another 25 minutes.  A definate keeper- my husband loved it too!  Looking forward to the left overs!

My husband LOVED this recipe - said "This one's a keeper!" I took "PotatoFreak's" suggestion & used multiple cheeses & pepperoni on the inside. Afterplacing the meatloaf in the pan, I wrapped it in bacon, baked for 1hr & 10 minutes covered, then 20 minutes uncovered. Moist & perfect! Thank you so much for a great dish!

I did this a little differently but with excellent results!   I stuffed it with american, mozzerella and pepperoni.  Topped it with strips of bacon and a ketchup, brown sugar, mustard sauce.  I cooked it covered for an hour and 10 minutes and uncovered for 20.  It was moist and wonderful!  I will make this one again and again.

I normally use ground turkey when making a meatloaf, so I was a little concerned when I read some of the reviews stating that the dish turned out dry. I only used one egg, mozarella cheese in lieu of provolone and I covered the loaf with a can of cream of mushroom soup. This kept it very moist and my husband and kids really loved it.

Must use a meat thermometer.  I took the "advice" of other reviewers and bumped the cooking time up by 20-30 minutes.  BIG MISTAKE.  I really should have used a thermometer, but did not have one at the time.  More cooking time resulted in an overdone dry loaf.  Im sure it would have been great otherwise.  Something must have been wrong with the other reviewers ovens.

Yummy, this was first rate. I unfortunately live across the road from a Deli. So on getting some ham I pondered in pancetta might be better so the bloke behind the counter convinced me to take some and try it. So put both in, also had a dribble of truffle oil left in the bottle - in she went.  As that chap on the t.v. says, "It kicked it to the next level." In terms of expense too haha.

This recipe was GREAT and easy.  My husband wants it on the menu twice a month. 

I made a couple of changes since we are both vegeterians: 
1. Used Jimmy Lean Ground Beef
2. Added green olives
3. Added celery
4. Used real garlic

Next time: I will not use the cheese - I will top with ketchup.

Everyone enjoyed this! This is a simple meatloaf to put together and looks very elegant when served(for a meatloaf). The provolone, ham and the italian seasonings in the meatloaf all went very well together, making a D-lish dish!  I think next time I will add more ham and provolone cheese as I feel that it wasn't enough in the middle. I topped it with ketchup.  YUM. THX

The only change I made is using some fresh garlic rather then powdered.  We all enjoyed it and I must admit it makes great cold meatloaf sandwiches, which is often the only reason I will cook a meatloaf.

I've made a Sicilian Meat Roll recipe from Southern Living for years, and it's very similar.  The instructions said to cook it for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350, and that the inside will be a tad pink from the ham.  I've cooked it that way for years and it's always been ready in that amount of time.  I don't think I've made meatloaf any other way since I found that recipe.   It looks pretty when you cut it, and it needs to stand a few minutes before it's cut, so perhaps it cooks a little more as it stands.  Yummy!

I saved this recipe a while back and glad I did! Made this pretty much as the recipe was written. I added a bit more garlic powder and baked the loaf in a 9x13 glass pan. I made this for 7 people and they all loved it. I was the last to finally get a slice to try and was amazed by the flavor. This will be made quite often I'm sure! One other thing I did was bake the loaf for 45 minutes with aluminum foil over the dish and then 45 minutes bare. I didn't find it dried out one bit and loved the texture. I think just for fun I'll try some of the other variations of meats and cheeses!

This is an AMAZING recipe! I added my own Italian seasoned bread crumbs and used Gouda instead of Provolone cheese (didn't have any). I also added a bit of milk to the meat to make it more manageable when rolling. To avoid the pink center that some reviewers complained about, I simply flattened a third of the meat mixture thinner than the rest. After I layered the ham and cheese, I started rolling the meatloaf from the thinner side. Then I just baked according to temperature and time stated in the recipe. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing your grandmother's recipe, Blembo. Will be making this often for my family and guests.

This was easy to prepare and tasty, I would give it 5 stars except I took the advice of some other reviewers and added a mix of bbq sauce, ketchup, mustard and brown sugar poured on top before putting it in the oven. It would have been very bland otherwise. I covered it for the first 60 min, then uncovered it for 20 min, it turned out perfect, not dry at all.  Here is a no fail tip for meatloaf...put 2 or 3 slices of dry bread in the pan under the meatloaf, it will soak up all of the grease so the meat isn't saturated with it. Then just throw away the yucky bread.

Very good flavor.  I mixed 1 pound turkey with 1 pound ground beef.  I noticed that several noted that it took some time in getting done.  I thought I was experiencing the same issue and then I noticed that the ham in the middle was pink.  The meatloaf was actually done but I was deceived by the ham.  I also used monterey jack cheese b/c that was all I had.  I will make this again.

Have been making this for years thanks to my Italian Grandmother.  I use bread cubes soaked in water,  fresh garlic and parsley, 1 egg per pound of meat, boiled ham, mozzerella and grated Italian cheese.  I divide the meat into 2 - 1 pound loaves,  meatloaf cooks quicker (in an hour or so and if we only eat one we have the other to freeze.  Instead of catsup, I use a can of tomato sauce.  Put some in the meat mixture for moisture and cover the tops with tomato sauce as well.  Yummy

I made this last night and it was awesome!!!  I used thinly sliced Montreal smoked meat and cheddar cheese..that's what I had...tons of both. It was decadent...a little cheese did melt out but I spooned it over as a sauce. I made sure my "loaf" fit tightly in the pan. I also drained of the fat a couple of times as it was baking.  I covered it for the first hour as suggested. I also used onion salt instead of chopped onion as my son won't eat anything if he even sees one onion.   I will be making this again!!!Thanks for a great new twist on meatloaf!

This recipe was good in quality and taste. However the directions to use a loaf did not work as good as I hoped. I suggest to anyone who is going to continue making this recipe that you either use muffin pan loafs or make small miniature loaves. Use the same ingredients but don't use the large loaf as suggested.

I just made this meatloaf for supper & I got 2  thumbs up from my husband & 5 yr old son.  My meatloaves in the past have never tasted this great.  I took the advice from others & covered my loaf with tin foil for 45 minutes then cooked uncovered for 20 minutes. They were right "moist & delicious"  I did add a few more spices.  I added a Canadian Spice that's a staple in any household called Montreal Steak Spice which gives it a little kick:)  This is definitely a keeper & I will be giving the recipe to friends as well.

This is a fantastic meatloaf and I am not usually a fan of meatloaf or ham but this recipe got my interest and I had to try. Boy am I glad I did.  I halved the entire recipe because there is only 2 of us and it still made plenty.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled up on the ham and the cheese, and I followed heartofatexan's review and topped the loaf with brown sugar and it offset the ham taste nicely and the top was not as hard as other reviewers had said.  Tks so much for posting this one.

This is a really good recipe as presented.  The directions are very clear.  I found it somewhat bland as written, but recipes are meant to be a base, you add your personal preferences!  I used bacon instead of ham and feta cheese instead of provolone!  It was amazing!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Made it tonight, and it was pretty good.  Rolling it up was a laugh a minute!  I made a glaze of equal parts spicy brown mustard and honey, and that really set it off.  Will try it again and see if I can do it better next time.  (I have never made meatloaf before.)

Loved this meatloaf! I subbed fresh minced garlic for garlic powder, and added some red pepper flake and Italian herbs.  Served this with some roasted rosemary red potatoes I put in the oven at the same time and a big spring greens salad with homemade blue cheese dressing.  Such a nice family dinner!

I have been making this recipe for years.  We always called it stuffed meatloaf and sometimes also put broccoli in the middle.  Either way, it's just a great twist on the usual meatloaf.  Enjoyed by everyone!

So yummy!  i added some brown sugar like other's suggested.  i covered the top with tin foil for the first 45 mins of cooking, and took it off for the last bit.  It turned out tasty and moist!  It's a keeper!

this went over great with my family. I decided to change from beef to venison and they didnt even notice. I also added fresh garlic to the meat and a brown sugar and ketchup glaze with a little bit of spicy mustard

I made this tonight. It was delicious! I baked it covered for the first hour, and uncovered for the last 15 minutes. It turned out very moist and yummy! I did add some Worcestershire sauce to the mix. Next time I make it I think I'll try adding some broccoli with the ham and cheese. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good recipe.    Turned out  great.   To roll it easily, just use the paper to roll it as the directions dictate.  If it falls apart, just pat it back together.  Make sure that the ends are sealed, just use your fingers to pat it closed.  This will keep the cheese from oozing out. I put it in the fridge for an hour or so before cooking it.  As others have noted, it can look pink due to the ham.

This is a great idea! One suggestion -  I gave up using dried bread crumbs for meatloaf a long time ago.  I use plain deli white bread soaked in milk.  Super moist and delicious with meatloaf.  simply cut the bread in 1-2" cubes, place in a 9x13, and soak with whole milk.  After about 10 minutes, using your hands pick up the bread and squeeze the excess milk off and place the bread on a cuting board.  Chop and add to the meat mixture with 2 eggs.

This was wonderful. What a great twist on plain old meatloaf. I even made extra and froze it so he can make dinner when I am at work and even that turned out great.

Hubby is so not a meatloaf eater... And I love it.  The comprimise is I make it maybe 2x a year and even the kids are acquiring his tastes and beginning to pick at it.  I actually did this with ground turkey, and I must say!  You are on to something!  There was not even a left over slice to take to work the next day.

Good idea for a recipe. We only use ground turkey and I used swiss instead of provolone. It does need some ind of sauce to keep moist, I did ketchup, mustard and brown sugar. I will make this again.

very good recipe....I didnt have any wax paper so used pam and some aluminum foil and my hands to roll the mixture up....also added fresh minced garlic about 3 cloves and skipped the garlic powder......used some worc. sauce about 1 tsp or so in the meatloaf mixture also placed  a ketchup brown sugar glaze on top after cooking covered for 45 minutes then I uncovered the meatloaf with the glaze on top .....turned out delic.....also read other reviews and knew that it would be pink on the inside from the dye of the ham.....took 1 hr 15 minutes to cook.....my boyfriend couldnt stop complimenting on the food....will make again....made the scalloped cabbage recipe and a tomato cucumber salad with it....enjoyed it...

This was really good except that it didn't have any sauce, so I added some homemade bbq sauce that I use with another meatloaf recipe that I have.  Will definitely be making again.

Thought this recipe was great.  I had left over ham from Christmas dinner sitting in the freezer to be eaten, so I decided this was the perfect opportunity to use it up.  I added minced garlic and mushrooms (since I had TONS in the fridge that needed to be used up).  I unfortunately ran out of eggs and didn't have any milk on hand, so I added a small amount of whipping cream to make the loaf more moist looking.  Smeared ketchup on the top and baked.  The only downside to this was that the seam of the loaf was on the top, and I baked it in a oval corning ware (with glass lid) because it didn't fit in my normal loaf pan.  While it was baking, the seam burst apart.  I'd recommend putting it on the bottom next time and baking in a more fitted pan. Per the suggestions of others, I covered it while baking and checked it after an hour (with thermometer)- and it was done cooking.

This is a good recipe.  A bit dry if cooked for the suggested time.  Use a meat thermometer.  The ham gets lost in the taste of the meatloaf, but overall, still good. Will make again, but with a few changes including some garlic and Montreal steak seasoning to give it more of a kick.

my boyfriend and i never really had meatloaf before and this was really enjoyable. because there are only two of us i used 1 lb, added some red pepper flakes and cooked it slowly at 320 so that it could be more moist for about a full hour.   thanks for the recipe!

I never try anything new on other people until I try it for myself and usually include my daughter for her opinion. I made this last night and found it easy, quick and delicious. I followed the directions exactly but I think that 1 hour and 15 minutes is too long for cooking time. The outer layer, I thought was a little crusty but inside was moist and tasty. My daughter found nothing wrong with it, ate about three pieces and even took some home with her. I will definitely make this again but will watch the cooking time a little closer.

I made this for company, a young guy who is a meatloaf connoisseur.  My hubby and I both are not big fans of meatloaf...but this got rave reviews from all, even our 1-year old!  The only change I made was I added Worcestershire sauce.  I baked it for the hour and 15 minutes as instructed and it was perfect!  Juicy and well formed.  From now on, we will be eating meatloaf more often!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Fantastic!!! I had a half a pack of Zesty Italian salad dressing mix to use up, and I threw that in along with a few dashes of Italian seasonings. I'm sure that I almost doubled the amout of cheese, but it was a good thing that I did, as a bunch leaked out. I had it covered for the first 45 minutes, uncovered for another 45. This was SOOO good!!! Thanks a heap for a fantastic recipe!!

I found this to be dry, too salty, and without flavor. Can't say I'd even try again with tweaking.

I decided to try this out for a change instead of making my normal meatloaf. I was kinda underwhelmed. It was a little too dry for my liking.

I used ham cubes, muenster cheese, and the recommended thermometer. Glad I did because the inside looked "pink" from the ham.
I also used the cream of mushroom soup idea.
I would make this recipe again!

We liked this a lot.  The same old meatloaf gets a big dull, so this was a good twist that was still hearty comfort food.

This was pretty good, but I liked the idea more than I liked the intial, out-of-the-oven flavor.  Was better as a left-over once the flavors mingled.

YUM!  Added a little ketsup, dried mustard & 1/8 tsp of Montreal Steak seasoning to meat mixture.  Cooked for 45 mins covered with foil, then finished uncovered.  Added basil leaves in with the meat/cheese layer, extra delicious.

It was good.I had two slices of pepper jack cheese and used cheddar for the rest and I cooked it in a casserole dish, it was a pretty good dish the family said but I doubt I will make it again.

I have been making this years - I use VA smoked ham and baby swiss, still adding the ketchup on top.  Takes too long to cook in a loof pan, so put the meatloaf log into a 9x13, tent with foil for 45min and then remove foil for 25-30 min.....

I did the same as others suggested and covered for the 1st half. Also I added brown sugar (about 1/4 c), balsamic vinegar 1Tbsp, and worcestershire sauce 1Tbsp. But, I cut the recipe in half from its origional. I also added pastrimi to the ham and used Harviti cheese instead of provolone. It was what I had but, MAN was it great! Also fresh garlic gave it the perfect touch.

Made exactly as described, but found it a little dry and rubbery. Will make again with a can of cream soup of some sort, maybe mushroom. Think that will keep it just moist enough.

The first time I made it, it was just a little to plain, but the next time I put cream of mushroom soup on top and it was great.  The cream of mushroom soup kept it from getting to dry.

Great recipe!  I do make a slighter larger meatloaf, mixing 2.25 lbs ground chuck and 1 lb ground pork.  I find it works perfectly in a 9x13. I bake at 375 with foil on it for 45 minutes, then remove the foil, put a "topper" on it - usually BBQ sauce - then 30 more minutes uncovered.  we love the smoky Provolone in this!  have also thrown some finely chopped broccoli in the ham/cheese mixture.  Good stuff!

I made this recipe according to directions with just a bit more ham and cheese since my family loves cordon bleu.  It was delicious and people fought to take the small leftover piece for lunch.  Another great all recipe for me

Yummy! I made this for dinner last night with only slight changes, I used Ground Turkey in place of Beef (we don't eat ground beef)  I basically made my meatloaf as I always do (which is pretty much the same as this Recipe) I added some thinly sliced green onions because I had them, and a very little ketchup & mustard! I used Deli Selects Ham and sliced Mozzarella (it's what I had). Cooked for about 45 minutes. It sliced up beautifully and my family LOVED it especially the Kids! I Served it with California Blend Veggies & an iceberg Salad! Can't wait for the leftovers!!

I left most of the salt out, but smeared the ham with softened Roquefort.  Looks very unsuspecting until it hits your tongue.

I made this recipe because i was tired of the usual meatloaf that i make and my husband loves my chicken cordon bleu. So, it seemed a nice match. And it was. I changed alittle. I reduced the amount of onion because my husband isn't a fan. I added a chopped up bell pepper so there would be more veggies. I used mozzarella cheese because that's what i had on hand. Although i do wish i had used Swiss or the Provolone. The mozzarella has nice texture but was a bit bland. I also think next time i will add some Italian bread crumbs or seasonings and maybe some tomato paste or ketcup. Although it was nice and moist. My husband had three helpings! I will definately make this again sometime.

Very good!!  My husband and I both loved this.  I added a can of green chilies for a little bite.  I will make this again, but would only put the ham in the middle and then melt the cheese on top once it is done.  I found that even making sure the ends were secure, all of the cheese melted out.

The yummiest meatloaf I have honestly ever made. I just cooked bacon first and added to mince mixture, and added chunks of cheese to mixture. put breadcrumbs and grated cheese on top.

I have made this meatloaf three times for different groups.  Everyone loved it each time.  I keep real close to my recipes however, I do like to put cream of mushroom soup on top about 20 minutes before serving and put mushroom gravy on before serving.  I know I will get requests for this again.

First of all my family hates meatloaf with a passion! But when I made this there was none left! It was even good reheated the next day for my husband's lunch. The cheese is a wonderful combination, my only caution would be to use a good quality ham in it. The cheap, thinly sliced kind would not work with this, we prefered the slightly thick cuts in it. This is one recipe I didn't try to change, a miracle for me!!!

Hubby liked the meatloaf but said it was a little bland.   And I added extra garlic, onions, and italian seasoning.   Next time I will double the cheese and ham.

Really liked this. Read all the reviews and cooked for 1 hour with aluminum foil on and about 1/2 off. Mixed ketchup and brown sugar and honey mustard to taste and spread on meatloaf for the last 1/2 hour. 
I also added some worcestershire sauce and good seasonings italian dry salad mix to the meatloaf mixture while mixing it.
This is a keeper.

This is a very tasty dish.  i halved the recipe, and it still made enough to easily feed 3 people.  i also took a can of french onion soup and poured it over the loaf before baking to keep it moist.  right before taking it out of the oven i put a couple slices of provolone on top, next time i think i'll just put more cheese inside.

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  I used double the cheese - 4 slices of provolone, and 4 slices of swiss.  For the topping, I spread some honey french dressing, honey mustard and ketchup on top of the loaf, and covered it for half the cooking time with foil.  It was a little on the dry side, which is probably more due to my cantankerous oven.  We will definitely make it again!

I lost a similar recipe and was pleased to find this.  One key change:  use white meat for the ground meat -- I use a mixture of turkey and pork.  Also, it really makes the rolling go easier if you refrigerate it for an hour or more after patting it out.  I serve it with a creamy honey mustard sauce.  Terrific!

OMW!!!! this was the BEST recipe i have ever used! i stuck to the original recipe and rubbed brown sugar on top of the loaf after rolling it, i also used brown sugar smoked ham from the deli to give it a slightly sweet taste, though not too sweet. My mother said it was better than any meal she ever had in any restaraunt AMAZING

This was good.  I made a few changes for the better.  First.. use 1/2 beef and 1/2 ground Italian sausage..1/2 chopped bell pepper.. 1 8oz can tomato sauce mixed with 4 tbls A-1 Steak Sauce then add 1 tsp Italian seasoning.. black pepper and the garlic powder to the meat.. reserving 2 tbls of the sauce for the top.  For the middle filling I used a combination of provolone and monterrey jack cheeses along with canadian ham and pepperoni.  Huge hit!

Liked it, but I didn't make it as this recipe specified.  I took 2lbs ground beef, 2 eggs, one packet of Good Seasonings Garlic and Herb and some Italian bread crumbs.  Mixed that all together and then followed the recipe from there using thick sliced provelone and honey smoked maple ham.  My family devoured it.  I like using Good Seasonings packets in recipes like this (they are found in your salad dressing isle at the grocery store).  The entire packet seasoned the meat perfectly and let me cut out all the measuring of the spices.  Quick and delicious!

I tried this meatloaf last night and it was good but I think I could have added more ham and some of the cheese ran out.  I put a ketchup/brown sugar glaze on it in the last 30 minutes of baking and it made it really good.  My husband liked it and I would probably make it again but I would add more spices to it for more flavor.

I love meatloaf and followed this recipe to the letter, except for one addition.  It took around 1 1/2 hr. to get completely done, however, I think the ham makes the ground beef appear to be not done when it really is.  I also put a can of mushroom soup on top which is the only addition that I made.  Everyone was being very gracious at dinner, until I said, "I don't know about you, but I don't care for this at all".  They all agreed.  I have been cooking for over 46 years and rarely use a recipe. So, guess I will just continue with my own, in my head, recipes in the future.  Sorry, Brenda, but will not be making this again,... we all voted!! I am glad for you, however,  that some others did enjoy it.  It may be possible that my ground beef was too lean.

Good, simple recipe.  Very flavorful.  I used chicken burger instead of ground beef.  It gave it more of that authentic cordon bleu flavor.  Enjoy!

I've made this a dozen times (I double up and make two), tried a couple others but keep coming back. I do cover it with foil, bake for an hour then take the foil off and do it another 20 minutes. 

There are normally only two for supper so we cut each loaf in quarters and freeze it.

We love this recipe, just how it is, except one thing! I add bacon. I slightly precook the bacon and then wrap it around the outside of the loaf. My family goes nuts with the three different meats and oozy gooey cheese! Love it! Thanks.

This was really tasty.  The only change I would make is to leave out the salt.  Adding the teaspoon put it overboard with the salty taste.

Best meatloaf by far! Only things I did differently was add a tbsp of Worcestershire and brushed the top with BBQ sauce. I also just threw it all into a bowl and mixed it then pressed into loaf pan. Covered half the time with foil. Delish!!!

It seemed to be a better idea in theory, but did not turn out well for me at all.  We did not like the flavor at all.  Will stick to traditional meatloaf.

Thoroughly enjoyed this new twist on old fashioned meatloaf. Thanks to the reviews decided NOT to bake in loaf tin, formed into a log using parchment paper.Make sure ends are well sealed otherwise all that lovely cheese will ooze out!! Baked for 35-40 mins.PERFECT. Ended up abig hit with the mother -in law and husband.Makes wonderful sandwiches too!!

The ham and provolone added a really nice flavor to this meatloaf.  However, mine was very dry.  I did make a mornay sauce to go with it (like they make with chicken cordon bleu), because I didn't want the standard ketchup topping, or a brown gravy, and it did really help with the dryness. If I do make this again, I will use more ham.  It really needs something else, though, but I can't quite figure out what it is.

Recipe is a winner.  My guys hate normal meatloaf. They loved this one.  I used shaved honey ham and pepper jack cheese--what I had on hand.  Very tasty.  I think it would be good with any inner meat/cheese combination--like thin lean pepperoni and provolone.  It is a repeater.

My family would have given this a five star rating, but they all agree that it needs some sort of gravy or topping to complete the taste. I also found that the wax paper only got in the way. It started to rip when I picked it up, so I had to throw the wax paper away and simply just roll it as is. No problem. This is a very nice meatloaf and a different way to make it, but I will make a brown gravy to serve with it the next time that I make it. Thank you.

Everyone loved this recipe!!  Nice and moist.  Added sauce to the top for the last 15 minutes like suggested.  The tip with putting a slice of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan was genius and worked wonderful!

excellent recipe! The provolone/ham really bumps up the flavor of regular boring meatloaf. I havled the recipe and then cut into two loaves and cooked side by side; which reduced cooking time to one hour. Also added a barbecue glaze on top and sprinkled french onions. Yum!

My boyfriend loved this recipe. I also enjoyed it very much considering I don't usually like meatloaf. I did make a few changes. I added green pepper and I used Swiss Cheese. I cooked it for and 1 hour and 15 mins. I did end up changing the temp of my oven since I've made meatloaf a few times and it doesn't cook on 350 degrees I put it on 375 then the last 10 mins I moved it up to 400 degrees. It turned out prefect!!

This was a very delicious, easy recipe.  I do recommend mixing ketchup, brown sugar and ground mustard together and putting it on top of the meatlaof when it is about half hour away from being cooked. This gives it more flavor.

My husband and I don't even like meatloaf. He made me promise never to make it for someone who had never had meatloaf before... he said it would ruin meatloaf for them because it would never ever be better than this.

This is a GREAT savory alternative to the tradition "ketchup & brown sugar" meatloaf. I did triple the garlic powder, added scallions (as well as the onion), not so lean beef (to keep it SUPER moist), and served it with a mushroom gravy. This had great reviews in my home, and I would certainly serve it to guests, or at the restaurant as a special. Thanks BLEMBO!

Well phew -- someone found a way to get more meat into meatloaf!  Seriously, this is now my go-to recipe for meatloaf, and I think I'll feel cheated if I ever skip the ham and cheese.  I've been topping it with Dijon mustard and the combination is lovely.  I'm thinking to try it next with ground chicken...

Very good.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  The only thing was it did take a bit longer to cook.  More like 1:30 or 1:45.  I will definately make this again!

Tastes good. Be sure to use a meat thermometer on this one. If it's dry, you've overcooked it. You can't go by the color because the ham will leave it looking pink, and you might think it's not done. If you like, had a glaze or make some gravy for the top. I personally still prefer the real thing: chicken cordon bleu.

Loved this!  I had to make due with what I had, so only 1.25 lbs of extra lean ground beef.  I added about 4 celery stalks cut up pretty well, kept all the other ingredients the same equivalants.  I used prosciutto contadina (I know spelling bad) for the ham.  And I did add some Cayene pepper flakes and about 1/4 cup of ketchup.  I used foil for 40 minutes and uncovered other 40 minutes.  I used a square glass casserole dish instead of a loaf pan.  It worked really well!  Thank you for this recipe!  :)

My husband wanted to cook dinner for me the other night, and wanted to try something different. He mentioned meatloaf, and when looking for a good recipe, we came across this one. It sounded wonderful, so we ran to the store to get what we didn't already have. He was impressed at how quickly it was to prepare. We both were very pleased at how wonderful it turned out. This is the first "stuffed" meatloaf that either of us has had, let alone tried to make ourselves. It wasn't to greasy (we used 93% ground beef),and it wasn't to dry. It was perfect. He enjoyed making it, and I of course enjoyed having him cook for me. We decided immediately that this one's a keeper.

For the past 30 years I've been cooking varieties of this meatloaf. I usually mix home ground beef and pork loin. The meat roll filling can be just about anything in your fridge. I've used many kinds of cheeses (don't like mozzarella or very soft ones because they leak)and luncheon meats, as well as sliced turkey. I've even put raisins or other dried fruit in the filling. My cooking time is usually 1 1/2 hours but a meat thermometer is a great help.

This is one of our favorites at my house.  If you are looking for something to go with it or to top it...try spaghetti sauce of any fav flave.  This is very close to what my ex cooked in the army called Hamburger Cordon Bleu (stuffed patties double dipped in egg wash and bread crumbs then fried golden before put into the oven) and the spag sauce with your fav pasta makes this a VERY filling meal

I absolutely hate meatloaf -- and I mean HATE.  But, my friends and I created this club that encourages us to expand our boundaries in the kitchen and this week's challenge was meatloaf.  This was a good recipe, if there is one for meatloaf!  I would've liked to find something to top the loaf, but struck out on that one.  It's still not my favorite, though.

Great recipe!  I had to borrow another hand to get it rolled up and placed in the pan.... But it turned out Perfect!  It was missing sauce, so next time I've been requested to add a little sauce before baking.

very good but I made some changes: I didn't have onion so I used dried onion soup mix, didn't have provolone cheese so used what I had which was shredded mexican cheese, and topped it with a can of cream of mushroom.  To my surprise it was pretty good

This was so good!! However, next time I will be using pepper jack cheese in place of provolone. Everyone loved this! Even my "picky" 5 yr old!  Thank you for sharing!

The recipe is really good the only thing is that your meat doesn't get done everywhere that the ham is touching. I can't seem to get it done for anything.

This was good!  I used ground turkey and used onion powder instead of onion, and also put in some rosemary.  I scaled the recipe for .75lb ground meat, so my meatloaf didn't look like a cinnamon roll (which is what I'm guessing it should have looked like), but more like turkey on the outside and ham and cheese on the inside.  Not a problem, though!  I also put a can of mushroom soup on top per someone else's suggestion, and that was very good, I definitely recommend it.  Kept it moist and made a gravy that would be good on mashed potatoes.  I don't even usually like those condensed soups at all, but it was good this way.  Anyway, had it with the microwaved potatoes lyonnaise also from this web site, like someone else suggested.  A lovely combination!  I'll certainly make this again, as it's good, good for you and easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used ultra-lean ground beef (4%); and Black Forest ham, removing the small rim of fat leaving no fat to the eye; 3 egg whites. It was a little dry on the outside, moist on the inside and delicious! (I'd advise covering with foil at some point in the cooking to preserve a little more moisture.)

Surprisingly I grew up with this recipe. Long story short, my mom told my dad that he was cooking that night and he had so many ingredients to work with, he came up with meatloaf cordon blue! The only thing I did different was instead of using ketchup or BBQ sauce on the top, I made a traditional chicken cordon blue sauce and put it on top! SO GOOD!

Total family favorite. Made it twice now and was just requested to make it for Father’s Day dinner. 
Been using bison instead of beef. We think it just tastes better. 
Also, when used in proportions listed, I end up making two rolls. One that I cook and the other I pop in the freezer to cook on a later date.

This meatloaf was very tasty. I did make a glaze of brown suger and tomato sauce, but bacon on the meatloaf then poured the glaze over it. My husband loved it. The leftovers made great meatloaf sandwiches too! I will be making again!

Great twist on the classic meatloaf.  Made just a couple of adjustments.  I increased the garlic to 1 tsp, and I covered the top of the meatloaf with a ketchup/worcestershire mixture.  Delicious!

Easy and tasty.  I read some other reviews and tweaked the recipe a bit.  I used 15% fat beef so it wouldn't be dry.  I added the worcestershire sauce to boost the flavor.  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs but would use plain in the future.  The Italian herbs don't go with Cordon bleu.  Also, I would use Swiss cheese since that's traditional.  I added some buttered crumbs to the top of the loaf and that was very nice.  I will definitely make this meatloaf again.

This was okay.  When making any adjustments to this recipe,  you should note that extra lean means just average Xtra lean from your grocery store.  I only use grass fed meats.  A meatloaf needs some fat content not only for flavor but for texture.  It would have tasted better if I had ground in a little extra fat and backed off on the breadcrumbs.  Still,  it had good flavor but the bite wasn't as texturally pleasing as it should have been.

Used my own favorite meatloaf recipe and tried the rolling technique. Excellent results. Used about a pound and a half of meatloaf  mix, and a combination of smoked ham,  provolone and mozzarella. Cut the salt by half due to all the cheese and ham. Covered for half the cooking time as suggested. Will definitely make this again.

I've made a variation of this meatloaf for years after seeing it on Barefoot Contessa. Minced onion and garlic powder works well if you don't feel like chopping. 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound ground pork are excellent for this recipe. 1 TBS of worcestershire sauce makes this really pop. I omit the salt and pepper. I do add ground basil and oregano. I use prosciutto in place of ham. This meatloaf is good topped with red marinara sauce or nothing on top. It freezes and reheats well after its been cooked. I've used mozzarella when I was out of provolone, it was good but the provolone is better. I line a cookie sheet or baking pan with aluminum foil. I flatten the meat mixture on the the foil, press it out flat in all directions. Should almost cover the whole pan, maybe 1/4 inch thick. Then use the foil to roll the meat, like you would a jelly roll. Once i get the first roll of the meat, i gently pull the foil up and away from me and let the meat roll itself. Unroll the foil, position the meat in the center of the pan and pinch the sides and seam closed. I like to give it a little squish from each end with my hands. Just grab the ends with both hands and push hands towards each.  Cook the meatloaf on the foil lined pan for easily clean up. You will love! I believe Barefoot Contessa called it Italian stuffed meatloaf. Goes great with no yolk or egg noodles and brown gravy. This meatloaf is so good and comes out moist that it won't need gravy. I bake at 350 for 60 minutes

I put it in the crock pot.  I also added some liquid smoke (just  a tsp.) and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce. Cooked on low for 3.5 hours and on warm until dinner. Worked like a charm.

This recipie needs more salt, it it delicious but not enough salt. It also has too much onion, i would use a very small onion and dice it really tiny, or just use half and onion. Japanese bread curmds work very well in case you dont have Italian ones. I will make this again; this meat loaf was spectacular.

This is a decent tasting meatloaf, but it really is just a meatloaf with a side of ham and melted cheese.  The ingredients don't fuse as I had hoped.

I used 4 kilograms of pork mince instead of beef, used garlic cloves instead of powder, added a teaspoon of vegemite, ground black pepper and 'normal' breadcrumbs as I had some, but the suggested might have been better. A bit of chopped Italian parsley and a dash of red wine.

I have been making my rolled meatloaf this same way for the past 43 years. Except I add can sliced mushrooms along with  the ham and lots of shredded mozzarella cheese. My big "kids" love it this way.

I make the same meatloaf but with a few changes.  Instead of the breadcrumbs, add 1/2 c. stovetop stuffing mix, add 1 Tbsp. (or more)of worstershire sauce and sprinkle small diced red pepper on top of the cheese before rolling up.  Sometimes I add a layer of salami too, adds nice flavor.  Been making my recipe for years.  A nice sauce for the top is 1 can campbells  cream of mushroom soup, 3 or more slices of American cheese and 1/4 c. milk heated until cheese melts.  Yum! (Tip to rolling: Flatten ground beef on wax paper and lift wax paper and peel back as it is rolled.)

I prepared this recipe but,  used a meatloaf blend of beef, pork and veal.   For the top, I spread the remaining tomato sauce on top and then laid out four already cooked bacon strips.  This was one of the best meatloaf.

Not a fan of this meatloaf at all.  It says to use lean meat but I think it would be better which a fatter ground beef.  It was very dry.  Maybe if some sort of sauce was put on top it would be better.

My husband made this for dinner last night, and while I am not a meatloaf fan (usually can't stand the stuff) this was a nice recipe. The only change my husband made was to use Swiss cheese, instead of the Provolone. Even our picky kids and my picky mother-in-law liked it. The big thing I liked about it is that it didn't have the ever-present ketchup topping. Frankly, if I want a hamburger, I'll eat a hamburger.  This was a nice combination of flavors in its own right. We'll make it again.

This is very good, though I made a few modifications. I added a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce and used sliced proscuitto and provolone cheese layered. I cooked at 375 for the time stated, but covered with foil for 45 minutes. It was perfect and my husband, who doesn't typically like meatloaf, loved it - even had two helpings!!

This is basically very good. However, I have made many meatloaf mixtures over the years. This is my take on this: 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs, (4)slices deli ham, (4)slices swiss cheese. Dice both ham & cheese in small pieces & mix with meat as directed(flavors mix better, less cheese runs out). Most everything else per the original recipt. On other subject, I have discovered that too many times I have "assumed" that my oven tempature was accurate & blamed someone's recipt for lack of success. Now I use a gage to verify the accuracy of both of my ovens. My success has been much better. I baked this in a 9x5 loaf pan, top sealed with aluminum at 300 for one & 1/2 hours. It was completely done. This was in a convection oven, saves $$$.

My daughter in law isn't one for meatloaf but when I made this for my son, she LOVED it!  So it's a keeper.  Thanks so much for an awesome recipe.   Note: the second time I made this I didn't have italian bread crumbs so I used regular bread crumbs and added 1 tsp of italian seasoning.  It was still a hit!

Very easy to make.  Seems foolproof, especially given that I had to substitute instant oatmeal for the breadcrumbs and it still came out tasting fantastic.  FYI, I topped with cheese when there was just 10 minutes left to cook.

I thought the meatloaf was dry and lacking full flavor.

This was a hit in our house.  Two out of three said it should stay on the list of recipes! I didn't make any changes.  What a great twist on an old comfort food!

Was very good and was easy to make.  I added some swiss cheese and some chedder cheese.  Next time I will make a tomato sauce to put over the top.

I added a ton of melting cheese and red peppers.  The cheese made a good sauce to scoop on top when ready to eat.

Although I don't eat beef I had to taste it! It smelled so good! It was very good.I added some green pepper, Ms.dash, garlic and a small can of tomato sauce. I used white cheddar and Italian cheese (it's what I had) and very good too!  I also covered with foil for the first 50 min. then uncovered for 30 min. It was moist and very flavorful.  My family loved it, it was easy to make and it's a keeper!! Thanks for sharing  :)

Just OK.No standout flavors. I think if I ever make it again I will use ground chicken or turkey.

This recipe is one of the worst.  I put it in for just an hour and it was so dry.  It really needs some moisture in the hamburger.  I really don't think I'll be fixing it again.  My hubby is the kind that will try anything once, but he didn't even like it.  Sorry

Mom liked it when she saw it, before she even ate it.  I cut the recipe in half except for putting two eggs in.  Big mistake; it came out a little mushy.  Stick to recipe (cut in half) next time and it will be all good.

We really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I followed the directions exactly, except I added about 1/4 cup of chilli sauce to the meatloaf, and also topped the meatloaf with a chilli sauce glaze.  A very nice recipe that I will be making again.  Thanks.

Interesting flavor, but not to my taste. The ham next to the beef tasted a bit odd. The outside of the meatloaf was crusty and crunchy, which is not my thing either. 

My hubby picked this recipes so I gave it a shot. He liked it. I didn't.

This was good, but we were not in love with it.  I followed the recipe only changing to add half a can of cream of mushroom soup the last 30 minutes of cooking.  This is very dense and filling.  I think it is probably worth a try, it may be something your family cares more for.

Excellent variation on an old favorite.  My hubby and I loved it.  Not too hard to prepare either.
Just served this again but this time for some tougher critics--my mom and dad.  Dad went back for seconds!!!

It came out great.  I do not care for onions or pepers etc., it was easy and very good.  I might try it with a topping next time.  I served it with left over pizza sauce and potatoes.  Very good.
