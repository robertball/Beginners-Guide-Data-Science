Fabulous recipe!  And not at all cake-like.  I followed the recipe precisely (except for no nuts)and got great fudgy brownies.  I think folks are getting cakey results when they add an egg or use some liquid other than the oil, as that will change the texture of any baked product.  The batter is very, very dry - almost too dry to call a batter.  But that's how it's supposed to be, the zucchini will shed it's moisture during the baking and you'll get superb brownies!!  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT recipe Marian!!  I must say that I was VERY skeptical of these not only because of the zucchini/no egg, but because after I mixed the ingredients, they looked well, I'll just say..less than desirable (my zucchini may have been a bit "dry").  I had to "press" them into the dish, not "pour" so I was a bit concerned.   The end result was FANTASTIC, not to mention a great way to sneak in zucchini, the kids had NO clue that it was even there!  I left out the nuts, baby has an allergy, and added 1/2 cup of choc. chips.  Since there weren't any eggs either (allergy) he was able to enjoy!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, we LOVED them!!

So good!!!!!  The batter will not be dry after you add the zucchini.  The moisture comes from the zucchini.  Do not add an egg if you want a moist, fudgy brownie. If you add an egg you will get a cake. I don't understand those that change the recipe and then give a bad rating.  The only change I made is that I only added 1/4 cup nuts.  Mine were done at 20 minutes.  The frosting is excellent but they really don't need it.  Thanks so much!!!  A keeper!!!

Has a very slight veggie-ish aftertaste, but otherwise fantastic. And like other reviewers have confirmed, it is a tad cake-like, (no I did not add an egg, which would have made it even more cakey) but in a very moist, gooey way. As long as you underbake it slightly, you should be fine. Use cocoa powder instead of flour for dusting the greased pan, that way you won't get a whitish, floury outside. Substituting applesauce for most of the oil worked out great - the brownies were still moist and tender. I grated the zucchini superfine so as not to have it "chunky". My little brother will never know he's eating zucchini and applesauce!

These are so moist and flavorful! I used pureed prunes (baby food) instead of oil, and they turned out great -- and even healthier!

I have to say that I thought this recipie sounded downright disgusting.  Zucchini in BROWNIES?!  I made it just for the fun of it to see what would happen.  Oh my gosh these were the BEST brownies I have ever had.  I'll never make brownies without zucchini again!  YUMMMMMMMY!  This was a keeper!

** An egg missing is NOT a mistake.**  

I've used this recipe for quite a few years after published here and am here once more to write it down again. The batter is dry to start, because the zucchini is the moisture. The batter will be quite dry when you put it into the pan, but if you followed the directions....it will bake perfect. It will be a chewy brownie if you do it this way.

To make it easier, I grate or puree my zucchini FIRST to let it sit for a while to "sweat".   This step allows the moisture to be released from the zucchini.  Then I add the zucchini(moisture & all)to the dry ingredients mix. It won't be dry at all...it will resemble a cake batter, and the result a bit more cake like brownie, but still divine. 

This recipe is very easy & great way to use up extra summer squash ( yellow, crockneck, italian, mexican..etc...) from the garden.  I freeze grated summer squash in 2 cup portions so I have it in the winter when I want these.  I just pull out a container to thaw & ready to go....further extending my garden harvest. delicious :) I usually reduce the sugar to around 1 - 1 1/4 cup as my preference... :)enjoy!

Adding the 2 eggs makes this more like a very dense cake than brownies.  Next time I'll leave them out.  Also will try using a lighter oil or maybe applesauce, as we could taste the oil.   Overall it had a nice flavor, and there was no way to tell there is zucchini in this cake!  That's a plus!  This frosting went well with this recipe.  Thanks.

I was skeptical when a friend suggested the recipe, but the end result was fantastic! They are chewy and fudgy - everything you want from a brownie and more (less calories, get to use up garden zucchini)! I omitted the walnuts and added peanut butter morsels.

Wonderful! Excellent! Delicious! So moist and no indication there is anything unusual about this recipe. The texture is more like a moist cake than brownies - which I like very much. It is so rich that I just sprinkled chocolate chips over it as it came out of the oven. Very highly recommended.

I just don't get those who say the zucchini taste is strong. Nonsense. Zucchini has NO discernible taste!  That's the psychological effect of knowing ahead of time that there's a vegetable in these. Kind of like a reverse placebo effect. No one who wasn't told in advance knew. WOW!! These are perfectly fudgy, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I made exactly as written, except for omitting the nuts (allergies). Didn't add a thing. There's nothing you could add to make this recipe any better than it already is. No need to worry about grating super finely. I used the shredding hole on my box grater - perfect. No eggs needed. And the frosting recipe is fabulous, as well. Cut ingredients for both brownies and frosting in half to make an 8" square pan. Be careful not to overbake to retain that yummy, fudgy texture. A mere 21 minutes was absolutely perfect in my exactly-calibrated oven. 30 minutes would have been way too long, so be watchful on these. No need to tell anyone what's in it. If you do, there will ALWAYS be some in the crowd who claim to taste the zucchini, and that ruins it for them. If you never tell, no one will know. These can also stand on their own, with nothing more than a sprinkling of powdered sugar. The frosting is just gilding the lily. Thanks for a future heirloom recipe.

I want to clarify three things about this recipe--#1: These are NOT 'healthy' just because there is some zucchini in them! This should be made as a 'treat' like any other brownie recipe with loads of fat, calories and carbs. #2: Someone actually said they added 2 eggs because they thought the recipe 'forgot' them. Um, no. Don't add eggs people! #3: In any zucchini recipe DON'T DRAIN THE WATER unless it specifies to do so! All that water makes these moist..same with bread recipes! NO DRAINING people! Now for my review: This recipe is divine as written. I read the negative reviews here after I made them and any problem with this recipe is the baker's fault - trust me. This is perfect as written. As you make these you are going to think the batter is too dry and the frosting too runny. Please, go on. These two issues resolve themselves as you continue on. One word of advice when adding the flour mixture: alternate with the WET zucchini. This will help with moisture so you have pourable batter. I even took some extra water from the zucchini bowl when I felt it needed some additional liquid. By doing this I had brownie batter. The frosting recipe is by far the best chocolate frosting I have ever made! But, be warned: before you add the cooled chocolate mixture you will have a runny mess that you will think you need to throw away! Add the cocoa mixture! Let it sit for 10-15 min and it thickens up to perfection! End result: more like cake, but absolutely delicious!

Definitely agree with Angela Sims . Testers are free to substitute , however after several or often even one  significant substitution you are no longer making the presented recipe but an alternative  so should not confuse others by rating the original recipe low.
If however you add something that in your opinion  actually improves the recipe this could be helpful to others. 
Since the zucchini adds the moisture I would definitely not drain it (a process that is often used  for Breaded zucchini ,eggplant etc)

I have made this a couple of times now and am very impressed. I have found that if you overcook the brownies, that is when you have the problem of crumbling (although the taste is still very good). After experimenting, the frosting makes this recipe oh so much better. I personally would not eat the brownie without the frosting. My family is not big on nuts so I added chocolate chips. This was not necessary but did add a nice touch. I grated the two cups of zucchini and then put it through the food processor. No one has been able to tell that there is zucchini in these brownies. At one point I made this batch and another zucchini brownie recipe I got from a very good cook. I then did a blind taste test with friends, co-workers, and neighbors and over 80% of the people liked this recipe best. I tried substituting the oil with applesauce and was less impressed. It was still good but nothing I would write home about. If I am going to eat the calories in a brownie I would rather reduce my portion intake and make it with the oil, as I believe it is better this way. To help with this I have also cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8x8 pan (it is glass so I cook at 325 for 27-29 minutes and they are perfect). This reduces the temptation to eat way more than I should. I will make this often, thank you!

I'm always looking for ways to make recipes healthy for my family without compromising the taste. This recipe was wonderful even with my adjustments.  I decreased the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of plain applesauce.  I also used only 1 cup of all purpose flour and added 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  Additionally I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp.  I also omitted the topping and the walnuts.  Even with the substitutions, it was wonderful.  The whole family gobbled it up and we ended up making another batch the next day.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I did not change one thing and they were wonderful.  The batter was extremely thick and I wondered how they would turn out.  Without eggs it was harder to stir but NO BIG DEAL.  My husband said he gave them 2 thumbs up.  My son said that there were not just good they were DELICIOUS!  My hubby had the idea of shredding up more of the Zucchini and freezing it so that in the winter months we could make it as well.  He took what was left of the brownies to work today and he said they got scarfed and everyone wanted the recipe.  I cant say enough about this yummy treat--try them because they are WONDERFUL! You wont regret it.  My advice--try the recipe before you start making modifications because it turned out great just the way it was written.
Thanks for the AWESOME recipe.

How has this recipe for zucchini and chocolate escaped me for so long?  For those having problems with a dry batter, mix the zucchini and salt into the oil/sugar/vanilla mixture and let it sit for a minute.  You will have no problem combining the rest of the ingredients.  Substituted brown sugar for the white with great results.  Not at all cakey.

My boyfriend and I made one each at the same time, (we were in a rush to go to a party) he mixed his for ages, and I mixed mine until the dry ingredients were just mixed in.  His turned out tasting like a cake, mine came out tasting like a brownie.  The more you mix the ingredients together the more you make the water come out of the zucchini which moistens the mixture so those that are getting a cake type of feel and taste try to mix less and or put less zucchini.  We have to say though that both of them were divine!!!!!!

These were great!  I am a "Weight Watcher" so I did not add the frosting and they were still great.  My kids and husband ate them up!  They are 4pts w/o frosting.  Next time I will sub unsweetened applesauce for the oil. They then will drop to 2pts each w/o frosting. (I cut mine into 20 squares rather than 24.)  Thanks for the recipe!!

Made exactly as directed. Although it did taste wonderful, I got a cake like result. I assume it is from the baking soda and plan to reduce/omit it next time... or just call it Chocolate Zucchini Cake. :)

I followed the recipe to the letter and I have to give this a poor review.  First, the batter was way too sand like.  When I added the zucchini it was so hard to incorporate but the moisture from the zucchini (which I squeezed dry and I wouldn‘t suggest doing this for this recipe, it needs all the liquid it can get) did turn the sand like texture into wet sand texture…UGH.  I had a hard time getting the zucchini mixed in so I dumped, not poured the batter into my prepared pan and tried to mix it up this way.  It was still stiff and I had to press it down into the corners and level the batter flat for even baking.  It took a lot longer than 25-30 min. I made the icing.  The only  good thing I can say about the icing is that it gave the brownies some flavour.  Without the icing (which I thought had a bitter taste) the brownies didn’t  have enough sweetness.  UGH...never making this again.  My family wouldn’t touch it and when I tried it, the shredded Zucchini had  a stringy like texture that made me feel like I had to pull them out of my mouth….UGH!

Didn't frost these as I dislike frosting.  The brownie was very fudgy and suprisingly good.  The texture was different.  Not bad, just different. Will make again as I have a ton of zucchini to use and this is a nice alternative to other zucchini recipes.

I took in the reviews and didn't want a cakelike brownie so I added 3 eggs to it. You need to add more fat such as butter or egg to make it more brownie like opposed to cakelike.  Very delicious and def not like a cake.  I then took it to another level and instead of using oil I used 1 stick melted butter and again used the three eggs...now those were some delicious zucchini brownies.   I also threw in some choco chips and skipped the frosting.  Will make again and again with my crop of zucchinis.  I never supplement when making desserts..i'll eat fruit if I must be healthy! oH AND THE BAKING TIME FOR MINE WAS MUCH LONGER..MORE LIKE 40-50 MINUTES.

Wonderful and creative recipe! Some reviewers have suggested eggs, I went according to the directions - no eggs.  Just follow the recipe as submitted. They turned out moist and delicious.  My sons and husband were surprised to hear there was zucchini in them. As for a "dry" mix, the zuchinni contains water and as you stir the batter will become moist. This recipe is a keeper:)

I've made these lots of times and they always end up great!  I don't frost them - I just sprinkle chocolate chips on top of them before baking.

Ah-mazing!  I halved the recipe, and left out the nuts, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Don't squeeze the water out of your grated zucchini-- that's what provides the moisture for your brownies!  I also added about a tsp of Medaglia d'oro instant espresso to both the brownies and the frosting-- my go-to secret addition to all chocolate recipes!  The frosting is delicious-- not too sweet and exactly the right amount for the brownies.  This recipe is a winner!!

These were fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used acorn squash instead of zucchini.  They turned out great.  I took the advice of others and baked them in a 9" square pan so I would have a thicker brownie.  I'd recommend these to anyone, and they are lots lower in fat than other brownies.  Yum...

Beautiful Recipe.  I made mine with summer squash, and grated it finely - the batter didn't turn out dry at all.  Don't know if that was due to the summer squash or the fact that more juices are released when grating finely.  Other than that I made no changes, except that I frosted with a peanut butter glaze/frosting (3 heaping tbsp peanut butter, 6 tbsp water, 2/3 cup powdered sugar).

must try!!  Used applesauce for all or part of the oil and choc chips instead of nuts.  Can decrease sugar, too, as they're a bit sweet.  I also used part whole wheat flour and added a couple tablespoons ground flax seed.  Bake in a cookie sheet for thin brownies or 13x9 for thicker.  The best brownies ever and more healthy than most. You don't notice the zuchinni at all. I haven't tried the frosting, but they are fabulously moist and chewy without it. These do not taste "healthy" or in any way less chocolatey than a "normal" full fat brownie.  The frosting sounds too rich for my tastes. Try it warm with a scoop of ice cream for a decadent dessert.  Will make again and again!!

After making these brownies for functions a few times, I get rave reviews and they disapear the quickest, but for those first-timers, I would like to give you a few helpful hints, which I badly needed my first time trying this recipe...   The grated zucchini should be done finely and should be packed into the measuring cup. The first time I made the recipe, I did not pack the zucchini, I just poured it into the measuring cup, and the brownies came out almost powdery. The second time, I grated them finely and packed them into the measuring cup and the brownies came out moist and fabulous!! Also, the ingredients for the icing make WAY too much and I had more icing than brownie. The next time, I made 3/4 and it was much more proportioned. Also, I recommend mixing the powdered ingredients in a separate bowl because the first time, I could taste the fact that the powders did not mix properly. Hopefully this helps, it certainly did for me!  Happy baking!

I used splenda instead of sugar and still turned out great!  Nobody knew the difference.

Thank you to the reviewer who recommended adding 2 eggs.  I wondered about their absence from the recipe.  Wonderful, moist, chocolate brownies even with out the frosting.  My family didn't even notice there was zucchini in them till I told them.

These were very good and a big hit with a vegetarian friend. Just a note, if using frozen zucchini defrost it and drain most of the water. Mine was still pretty wet, causing the cook time to run long.  There is NO NEED to add eggs or make other changes.

These brownies were very good.  Incredibly fudgey and very chocolatey without any hint of zucchini.  It made me happy that they were vegan by nature.  I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I cut the flour down to 1.5 cups and added 1 box of dry white chocolate pudding (.5 cup), I did half white/half brown sugar, half dark cocoa/half reg cocoa.  I didn't use the frosting, but I threw in a whole bunch of chocolate chips.  I also did like other reviewers and added the salt to the zucchini instead of the dry mix.  I used 3 large zucchini (bigger zucchini tend to have more moisture) to get 2 cups.  I prepared the zucchini mixture first, then made the dry mix so the zucchini could sit.  After adding the zucchini to the dry mix it was like normal brownie/cake batter.  My original plan was to puree the zucchini, but I decided after shredding it (tiny, tiny!) that it would probably be okay.  I was worried because the strands were pretty obvious in the batter, but after baking the only evidence left was some strands on top.  If you frosted them no one would ever know.  I tried them straight out of the oven to see if that vegetable taste was there that some experienced.  Nothing.  They were very thick, very fudgey, very dense.  There were a few spots that were slightly cakey, mainly the edges and part of the top.  I baked for probably about 28 minutes.  The second day: a slight odd taste, but still good.  Kinda vegetable-y.  I would definitely make these again!  Thank you for the recipe!

I use a cup of mini choc chips instead of the walnuts and frosting.  I also replace half the oil with applesauce.  I make muffins and bake at 400 for 20 mins.  I make a double batch and freeze the extra.  These definately satisfy my chocolate craving.

These were the best brownies ever!  Very easy to make!  I was also skeptical just as other members were but, once i added the zucchini the batter was only slighty dryer than a regular brownie batter. This is a favorite and I will be making these whenever my family craves brownies!

These brownies are wonderful!  I've spent years looking for a zucchini brownie recipe to replace a long lost version that my mom used to make, and this is it.  Despite other reviewer's assurances that these would turn ok even though the recipe doesn't use an egg, I couldn't do it.  The batter consistency was too weird so I added an egg right at the end.  The result was a beautiful, moist, cake-like brownie.  Egg or no egg, it just depends on if you like your brownies more cake-like or more chewy.  Either way this recipe is a keeper!

I have made these about 7 times now. So tasty and a good way to use overly large zucchini which you don't know what to do with! Simply grate the zucchini. You can deseed it if you want, but I find that if you leave in the seeds, they kind of taste like little pumpkin seeds.

Thank you for this fantastic recipe! I'm amazed by how wonderful these brownies are. Who would have thought zucchini could be decadent? Great for vegans but also for carnivores. I don't use eggs and didn't even have to convert. I also used almond milk in the frosting.

Made this recipe yes it is spongy in texture like cake however I like that I am not big on hard crunchy brownies fan.  I substituted applesauce for the oil in the batter.I omitted the frosting so this will slip into ziplock bags for quick snacks. Can't wait to make again and again.

This should be called, "Good for you brownies and your kids will never know it!"  I made some substitutions to make it healthier.  Used coconut oil instead of veggie.  3/4 cup Z sweet and 2/3 cup agava nectar instead of the 1 1/2 cup sugar.  1 cup unbleached organic naturally white flour and 1 cup whole wheat (Prairie Gold) instead of the 2 cups all purpose flour.  I left out the walnuts - not a fan.  They were moist and delicious.  No one could tell it did not have white sugar and flour.  My kids said they were the best.  My husband could not even tell they had zucchini in them.  Aces!

This recipe is definitely missing something from the ingredients. I've never made such a "dry" brownie mix. I didn't put the frosting on them, but I don't think that would have made any difference.  I ate one small piece and decided it was NOT something I wanted to share with people.

This turned out great! I didn't have any zucchini so I used a bag of frozen(thawed) spinach instead. I threw some extra chocolate chips in and sprinkled some on top of the frosting as well. I didn't use any eggs and was surprised how well they rose. My kids loved it.

these were fantastic!   You would never ever know there was zucchini in these.    I added 1 egg and it turned out really moist, but still brownie like!

Delicious!! The batter was dry and crumbly after mixing so I added a little melted margarine and everything came together. Also, didn't add any frosting. A little cakey when you first bite into them, but so moist and gooey as you keep chewing. Yummm... This one's a keeper. THANK YOU!

These brownies are so good! They are moist, chocolaty, and delicious! My kids even eat them without the frosting! I know some people were concerned with how dry the batter was but I mixed the zuccchini in with my hand and that helps the moisture from the zucchini squeeze out to help the batter become more of a batter! Hope you all enjoy!

The past reviewers are underplaying the dryness of this "batter", however, it turns out to be some of the best brownies my husband and I have ever had!  They are fudgy and moist and the frosting is great!  I will continue to make these!

I didn't have enough cocoa to make the frosting too, so we saw the swirls of shredded zucchini on top - but if I had been able to cover that up with frosting, you could NOT tell there was zucchini in these. It cooked completely away - no shreds, no green - and left no taste. Just soft, delicious, chocolatey brownies... I've never had to trick my kids into eating vegetables, but if I had, these would certainly do the trick. I wish I had some vanilla ice cream to serve on top! Will definitely make these again...

Oh my goodness, but these are good. It sounded weird, having zucchini in a brownie, but mm mm. Mine came out kind of crumby yet chewy...but that's ok. I will double the frosting next time, I couldn't get it to spread over the entire pan.

These came out horrible. I was suspicious as I put the sand-like mixture into the oven and cooked it, and they came out looking the same. Next time I will definitely be adding an egg or two.

Baked one batch with oil and one batch with applesauce instead of oil. Exact same glass pan, same day, same (monster-sized) zucchini and same baking time (30 min). Applesauce version was MUCH better. I could taste the oil and the oil version was less moist and more crumbly. FYI: I baked both versions with 100% whole wheat flour and not one person knew the difference and still LOVED these. You'll have to press the dough into the pan, but the zucchini just seems to dissolve and they'll never know it's there unless you tell them. Outstanding recipe! (Mostly) healthy brownies! Who knew!

These brownies are awesome!!  Super moist, although I kept re-reading the recipe because the batter didn't seem right (too dry).  Turned out great, though!  You would never know there was zucchini in there!  I actually used yellow summer squash.

These are great! You literally can't even see or taste the zucchini. I substituted most of the oil with no-sugar-added applesauce -- this definitely created more of a cake consistency than bar/brownie.  I still can't believe you can make a cake this moist and tasty with zucchini, no eggs and barely any oil - I give it 5 stars simply for that!

Someone gave me a monster zucchini and I was surfing for recipes to use it up when I stumbled upon this one. SO GOOD. Don't be fooled into adding an egg! The batter was REALLY dry and crumbly before adding the zucchini, almost like graham cracker crust, but it moistened up once I folded in the shredded zucchini. It was still really thick, but they baked up moist and fudgy and awesome. I spread the frosting on while they were still warm so it would melt and cool into a nice crust. My 6 year old WATCHED me put zucchini in these and she still gobbled it down. She said it changed her life, but then she's a little dramatic. Recipe is great as written! NO EGGS

These really ARE terrific.  I even used frozen shredded zucchini from last year's garden and they turned out moist and delicious.  Depending on how fine the shreds of zucchini are, you can't even tell there's veggies in the recipe!!

These were pretty good.  Not quite what I was looking for, but not bad.  Before adding the zucchini, the dough is very sandy/crumbly; once you add the zucchini, make sure you mix well to moisten all the flour and cocoa powder before "pressing" the batter into your pan.  The frosting wasn't bad but it wasn't great; I've never used margarine in a frosting before, but I went ahead and gave it a try and thought it ended up too greasy.  My frosting separated and I ended up having the pour off some oil from the top of the frosting, and then it came together smoothly.  I don't think it's as good as a butter frosting, though.  The brownies themselves have a pretty strong zucchini flavor, for a dessert.  They're sweet, but at the same time, you can tell there's something in them.  My husband, who normally can't tell if I "hide" stuff in breads or brownies, immediately was able to identify the zucchini in this recipe.  The brownies are not overly chocolatey like a "traditional" brownie is.  Overall, I'd say these are average.

I made this exactly as in the recipe, but without the icing. The dough came together tasting FANTASTIC. You could eat the dough alone, especially since it is eggless and not that unhealthy. Since the dough is rather dry you could form it, put it in the freezer, cut into cubes and toss into homemade chocolate ice cream.  But I didn´t like it once baked! I tried the recipe twice, and both times it baked crumbly and cakey, not like a brownie at all. It didn´t hold together enough to be eaten like a cake either. It just seemed to need a lot more fat or something.

Wow! I'm so proud of myself. I'm a non baker and this tasted like it came from a baking pro. Pat on the back for me. I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out  a little more than a 1/4 cup of sugar, just because I don't like things super sweet. I was really worried when I was mixing it all up because it wasn't really a batter like I thought it would be, I had to press it out with a spatula to get it even in the pan. It came out perfectly. You would never know that there's zucchini in there and no eggs. This one is a keeper for sure!

I've made these twice. The first time, I added 2 eggs and didn't make the frosting.  They were gross.  The second time, I made them exactly as written, made the frosting, and DID NOT add egg.  They were AWESOME!!!!!! Excellent way to use up zucchini, do NOT squeeze the shreds dry! I can't even see them in the brownies, they just dissolve and they're incredibly fudgy and moist and just great!

these were something else! Everything turned out great and the brownies are even better the next day! couple of things: One, after adding the zucchini to the mix, let it sit for a minute. Second, if you really want to hide the zucchini, I chopped mine VERY fine. No one knew there was anything healthy about the brownies until I told them!!!

I have no idea what the heck I did wrong. I was really excited to try these and I am not a novice cook by any means, especially when it comes to brownies, cakes, cookies, etc. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was incredibly, incredibly dry when I put it in my 9x13 pan. It came out in a similar fashion... dry, exceedingly crumbly, and weird tasting. I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to these brownies.

I love these!  They turn out more like cake when I make it, but it's the best cake I've ever had!  And the frosting is delightful as well.  Make sure you don't drain the shredded zucchini...include all the liquid!

Not bad. In fact, a healthier and creative way to use up zucchini--it doesn't call for any eggs at all! Mine turned out to be dense and cakey, probably because I squeezed out most of the juice from zucchini after grating. Next time, I'll reserve more juice so that the end product will turn out to be moister. The tricky part about this was the dough--it was VERY dry. I used my hand mixer to beat everything REALLY well until lump-free before I mixed in zucchini and nuts. I had to also press the dough onto the pan instead of spreading it, LOL! And just a personal preference, I reduced sugar to 1 cup and increased cocoa by 1/4 cup. Also, added 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon and left out the frosting. (It'll be too sweet for me otherwise!) So, they had a bittersweet taste that I prefer because I'm a big fan of dark choc. I guess mine can be called dark cocoa zucchini brownies. Overall, this is a deceptively delicious brownie recipe, definitely worth trying.

The first time I made these yummies, the batter was dry and the finished product had dry spots in it.  Not one to give up another way to use the blessed zucchini in my garden, I tried something different.  Instead of putting the tsp of salt in the flour, I shredded the zucchini and sprinkled the salt on top while I put together the rest of the ingredients.  THIS did the trick.  That being said, my partner in chocolate crimes(my 16 yr old daughter), and I tweaked it a bit more.  Instead of 2 tsp of vanilla, we used 1 tsp and added 1tsp of coconut extract.  We replaced the 1/2c of nuts with 1/2c of coconut and 1/2c chocolate chips.  We skip the frosting as we are not big fans of the gooey stuff.

Yummo!  What an awesome way to cook Zucchini! This is a must try recipe.  I only used 1/4 cup of oil and added a 1/4 cup of applesauce.

More of a cake than a brownie, but still a great way to use zucchini. I was unsure about no eggs, but some reviewers added them, some stuck to the recipe and didn't. I went in between and added one egg white. I'll make these again- zucchini?...what zucchini?

They are in no way "Brownies," but rather a really deliciously moist cake.

The brownies themselves were good and I would consider making them again. The frosting was WAY too sweet and therefore made the overall dish way too sweet. If you have an extreme sweet tooth you may like it, I'll have to pass on this one or leave the brownies unfrosted.

Fabulous.  Very moist. I made cupcakes. turned out great.  The icing was a little runny, tastes all right, I had to put the cupcakes in the frig before serving. Because of the icing they are a little messy to eat but very tasty. Thank you for this recipe.

Fabulous brownies that make me feel like I was eating something "healthy"  ;)  Only change I made was adding a 1/2 cup of Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips. The brownies were soo moist and delicious! I was seriously surprised by how good they were! Thank you for sharing the wonderful recipe!

These brownies turned out amazing - better than I ever could have hoped! By far the most successful from-scratch brownies I have ever made (and I've made a lot). Before adding the zucchini to the mix, the batter was really dry and sandy. But trust it! Once you add the zucchini it resembles a thicker batter, and the finished product is extremely moist. I didn't change a thing (though next time I think I will sub half the oil for applesauce). Everyone at work LOVED them. Great recipe! (And also vegan without the frosting - though you could sub soy or rice milk for the cow's milk and have a completely vegan brownie!). Thanks fo much for sharing!

Made exactly as described. Used whole-wheat pastry flour instead of white, and used soy milk instead of cow for the frosting.  Turned out exactly right.  When you're mixing this, IGNORE YOUR EYES.  Trust the science of the recipe.  It works perfectly as-is.  Not quite as fudgey as I like but that's just preference, and it's fixable. With the right sugar and margarine this is vegan, so it's my new go-to brownie recipe.  Delish!

I was really disappointed with these brownies. They did have a brownie texture, and they looked pretty, but i could obviously taste the weird veggie flavor. The frosting seemed like it was supposed to mask it, but nothing did the trick. My family wouldn't eat them, and I'm not too fond of them, either, so I definitely won't be making this again.

Amazing brownies. I've made these many times for my family and for my neighbors (who give me zucchinis from their gardens as "gifts" - as long as I share the bounty of brownies with them). Five stars all around. The secret is using the FINEST grate (yes, it may make your arm ache after two cups worth) and making sure you don't rinse the shredded zucchini, but have AS MUCH of the natural juices as possible. A+ Thanks for sharing Marian!

I just had to try this as 99% of the time I bake from scratch and come up with so far, no failed baking experiments, and all keepers over the years, however the zucchinni intrigued me just as much as my own gun-ho way of baking lol. I give it a two because it was very veg like and I do bake vegan quite a bit and find an e-nergy egg helps to keep things together more. I followed the recipe exact, although I did bake in cup cake tins instead for 20 per half a dozen tins. Toothpick came out clean and it was springy however it just was far too cake like for my personal tastes on brownies. When I saw moist my eyes popped, but it's not the same kind of moist I was thinking. I won't be making this again as I'm a texture fanatic and quite picky, hence why I typically do from scratch lol. I'm hard to please in baking. Nothing personal :)

Hmmm. I am torn about this recipe. I baked it for the time specified and maybe a little longer and it tasted fudgy, but possibly parts were undercooked? Maybe it was because I used 2 cups of zucchini (didn't want to waste any). I thought the outer edges of the parts that seemed fully cooked were tasty. My boyfriend loved these and said these were one of the tastiest treats I have made (he will eat anything chocolate) but I am still unsure. I used whole wheat flour to make them healthier. I will try this recipe again and leave it in the oven longer. It was tasty though. Just something was off.

Soooo good. My "frosting" turned out to be more of a glaze but still so tasty. I highly recomend the topping though because mine did not look very appetizing without it!

THIS RECIPE ISN'T MISSING ANYTHING.  It comes out perfect.  The batter seems dry/thick/sticky but it's okay!  The brownies come out delicious!  Be sure to finely shred your zucchini.  We used an 8x8 pan so had to cook them 35 minutes.

These were not only cakey, but dry. I read other reviews and knew to expect the dry batter.  However, the end result was nothing like what was described.  My father-in-law says they aren't bad, but I think he is just being nice.  My kids (who always are big fans of the deserts I make) and I give this a BIG thumbs down.  Quite disappointing.

Ok so these WERE fabulous but I was not without concern during the whole process.  You must know that before you add the zucchini this is not a "batter" it is still a dry crumbly concoction.  Here is the trick, add the zucchini and mix it in but let it sit for a few minutes.  When you come back the zucchini will have made the crumbly concoction wet.  Mix again until it is more like a batter then proceed as indicated.   These are delicious, sweet, rich, decadent brownies.  I felt the chocolate frosting put them over the top in a good way.  The kids LOVED them.  Hope this helped...try them again!

Amazing!  The dry consistancy threw me off too, but if you keep mixing it, the moisture of the zucchini will come out to make it more batter-like.  I imagine just leaving it dry would be fine too, as the moisture will come out in the baking process.  I'm excited because I can make these in the winter with all the shredded zucchini I froze and I most likely won't have to drain it too much.

Hmm. Not sure what happened with these... I had to half the recipe because my zucchini was not as big as I had thought. In the end I actually had just a bit less than 1 cup of zucchini. They tasted good, but they smelled kind of weird- like veggies I guess. The disconnect of eating something that smelled like veggies but didn't taste like veggies made the experience of eating them not that fun. It's too bad, too, because the idea of getting veggies in your dessert is amazing.

For adding veggies to brownies, they were really good!  They did have a slight "veggie-ish" taste, but that didn't detract from us wanting to eat the whole pan anyway.

Yum!! These are great!!!  I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts. I would have preferred walnuts, but my husband is allergic and I want him to eat these.   I also added an egg because he does not like fudgy brownies as much. He will never believe there is zucchini in there!  5 stars!!

I had high hopes for these brownies based on a lot of great reviews.  My outcome was not good, dry and crumbly with a weird taste.  They were edible, just not good.  Maybe an egg would help.

Delicious!  I was skeptical of the no-egg recipe, but it turned out to be super yummy!  I did a half batch in an 8x8 pan, but doubled the zucchini and left off frosting.  Baked for 27 minutes.  Perfect!

I didn't have enough cocoa powder left to make the frosting, but these are still soooo good even without it!

I made these today.  I was reluctant to make them as I make other brownies that are wonderful.  I am so pleasantly surprised at how great these are!  What a wonderful way to use zucchini.  These will be part of my regular baking (as long as I have the zucchini!)  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

These are super good.  Very rich, very moist.  I mixed all the ingredients in my KitchenAid fitted with the paddle attachment.  At first the batter was really dry but after a few minutes of mixing, the zucchini released their liquid and the batter was very wet and spread easily in the pan.  My I used a 7x11 pan and that resulted in a cake-like brownie.  Next time I'll stick with the 9x13 for a thinner, chewier consistency.  I might also cut the baking soda down to 1 teaspoon so it doesn't rise so much.  Yum!!

Brought this to the teachers' lounge and everyone loved them.  I cut the oil in half and used applesauce, and they were moist and delicious.

This has been in my recipe box for a year waiting for me to work up the courage to try it.  They were excellent.  My whole family loved them.  Take the advice of others and DO NOT add an egg.  Once you put the zucchini in you will have enough moisture.  I let my batter set a few minutes after adding the zucchini then mixed it again.  I only wish I had made them sooner in the zucchini season.  Will definitely make these often next summer when zucchini is abundant.  Oh, I conveniently forgot to tell the kids there was zucchini in these and they never figured it out.
UPDATE:  We found out my husband has to be on a gluten free diet. I halved the recipe and did one half regular and one half GF.  I used Bob's Red Mill flour mix in the GF version, added a tad more sugar, and a heaping 1/4 teaspoon xanthum gum.  Hubby was happy with the result.  Kiddo and I (we are not GF) tasted both versions and really could not tell the difference.

I'm sorry, maybe I did something wrong, but I did not care for this. It was an extremely dry "batter" and some parts didn't cook up all of the way. The zucchini made the ...mixture...taste very scrambled egg like in the end and all in all an unfortunate experience.

Let me start by saying that my family loves zucchini bread, so the zucchini wasn't the problem. These just had a very odd smell. They were so over-the-top sugary that we all felt like we were going to be sick after eating them. I followed the recipe exactly. Sorry. It didn't go over well here.

WOW!  Very rich and moist.  Some reviewers commented that the batter was dry and that the finished product was cake-like.  I didn't have that result...probably because I pureed the zucchini, and then added the salt to it.  The batter was perfect brownie batter consistency.  Based on other reviewers' comments, I made the following changes:  1/4 C. olive oil & 1/4 C. applesauce,
whole wheat flour instead of white, and used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also added a handful of chocolate chips.  It was great, even without icing!

used  sweet applesauce instead of oil and reduced the sugar to 1 cup, added chocolate morsels. came out awful, the texture is really weird, like rubber and it needs more sugar than 1 cup. Will try again.

Thank you for posting this recipe.I add a 1/2 cup of buttermilk and 1/4 cup of applesauce to it because the mixture seems too dry without.What a great way to use up those big old zucchini! I have made this recipe 3 times so far and have received rave reviews each time.

These were a big hit at our family picnic! No one could believe they were made with zucchini! I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil to make them a bit more healthy.

These brownies were heavenly! Really delicious and moist! I was skeptical, like many others before me, but I decided to try the recipe with an open mind. It was really dry when mixing the ingredients, that I had to put on disposable gloves and mix by hand. The mixture was left to stand for a while, because I had to search for my packet of nuts and when I came back, it looked like normal thick brownie batter. 
I substituted half the oil with apple sauce and added some shredded flax seeds (for a higher nutritional value). I cut down a little on the sugar (as I usually do to dessert recipes, since my friends like it less sweet) and used almonds in place of walnuts.
They were really terrific. Try it and you will know too... and please, don't add eggs or more oil to make it more moist... try it as it is!

These are delicious. What can I say that hasn't already been said a bunch of different times? Rich, yes, fudgy, yes, moist, yes, just the right amount of sweetness, yes. They are like a dense cake/brownie hybrid. They're so easy and quick to make. Oh, and you DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT HOW DRY YOUR MIX IS pre-baking. None of those tricks (pureeing the zucchini, letting it soak in the oil, and so on) are necessary. Just follow the recipe, blend the shredded zucchini in well and everything will be fine. My mix was dry as can be and the finished product is still moist and tasty.

I was asked to look up a recipe for zucchini brownies. I had never even heard of these, but after finding this recipe I had to try it. The mix was very dry which really concerned me. I had read a reviewers suggestion of using a mixer. After I tried that they were alot more moist. I did have to press them into the pan. These came out really good. You didn't even notice the zucchini in them( I chopped mine after shredding it as my hubby dislikes zucchini). Rave reviews from everyone who tried them.

delish! I halved the recipe (8x8 pan), omitted the walnuts (allergic) and used applesauce instead of oil to make them healthier. i had to shorten the baking time a couple minutes, but they turned out SO wonderful!  soft and moist and just GREAT!  plus they were super easy took only minutes to make. :) I used 1/2 cup of chocolate frosting that was in the fridge cuz i was feeling too lazy to make the frosting, but maybe i'll try it next time. I may also try them with just some chocolate chips added and no frosting, because this brownie is so soft and good, i want to experience it without any "frosting distraction!"  thanks so much for the good and healthy recipe!!

This is a pretty good recipe.   Mine turned out dark/bittersweet which is how we like it.  And it tastes better the day after I made it.  Definitely not fudgy brownie-like.  This is chocolate cake.  But yummy nonetheless and a great use-up for huge garden zucchini.  Here are the changes I made... left out 1/2 cup sugar, used 1 cup whole wheat flour, used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup walnuts, and didn't make the icing. I topped mine with chocolate syrup and/or vanilla ice cream.

YUM!  The brownies are nice and fluffy and the icing is fantastic. A medium zucchini will get you the 2 cups easily. I left the peel on and you can't even see anything green in the brownies. I also used unsweetened applesauce instead of the veggie oil and it worked great. It was father and brother approved to make again, even after they saw the zucchini going into the batter!

Fudgy and delicious!  I made only minor changes/additions:  First of all, I took the advice of another reviewer and made the zucchini finer in the food processor after shredding it with a cheese grater; I added 3 Tbs. strong brewed coffee (cooled) and a good squeeze of Hershey's chocolate syrup to the batter; and finally, I made 1 1/2 x the frosting recipe, which turned out to be just perfect for the 13 x 9 pan of brownies.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of the coffee to the frosting mixture as well.  This, I feel, really intensified the chocolate flavor.

Awesome and decadent! The first time I made these I used 1/2 coconut oil instead of veg oil. The batter was very dry - I was a bit worried and I kinda patted the dough into the pan. But don't let that worry you. They were so moist and rich. We ate the whole pan in one day! The 2nd time I tried to lighten them using 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. The dough was more wet this time. They were still wonderfully moist and rich, but without the oil left on your fingertips. This is THE ONE!  Make these!

Excellent! Like others, I went ahead and tried this because I didn't believe it could come out all that well for a brownie lover! I followed the recipe with the exception of using 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup extra light olive oil for veg. oil. I skipped the frosting and followed another reviewers suggestion of sprinkling chocolate chips over them when removing from oven. These were so good I had to immediately pack up over half of them for the neighbos grand kids so my husband and I wouldn't be tempted to 'over indulge'! I will definately be making these again & again, only trying to find an alternate to the full amount of sugar, thank you!!

Best brownies ever!  No modifications needed either. They were fudgy, moist and had no trace of zucchini.  I will never buy a brownie mix again.

These are wonderful.  I made these without nuts or frosting.  They are definitely more cake-y than a typical brownie, but I normally don't like my desserts as dense as brownies.  I've made these three times so far and can't wait for them again.  For all those complaining of dryness, don't remove the water from your zucchini; you've got 4 cups of dry ingredients to moisten.

Yummy, fudgy brownies. You can't tell there's zucchini in there. (Grate it finely.) I replaced most of the oil with applesauce, and replaced a little bit of white flour with whole wheat. (Will do more next time.) We will make these a lot.

I thought this was a good recipe - I made it exactly as written only omitting the nuts.  I havent made the frosting yet and I am not sure if I will or not.  The brownies are really more like cake, actually, I wouldnt call it brownies at all.  I think it would be great with the icing, but they are filling my chocolate craving as is with out the extra fat and calories.  Its a really rich cake and very moist.  I added some of the water from the bottom of my shredded zuchini bowl to the measuring cup with the zuchini.  My batter was thick but still very manageable.  

I used my first zuchini from my garden which I apparently overlooked because it was nearly 2 feet long when I picked it a couple days ago.  I was afraid it wouldnt be good cooked so I decided to bake with it.  Either it was really good or this recipe is perfect with very large, possibly tough zuchinis. 

I dont think anyone would ever know there was zuchini in this recipe.  Perfect for someone who cant have eggs or wanted a vegan chocolate cake (with another icing of course)

I cannot believe how GOOD these are!!  I have made the recipe a few times already and everyone LOVES it.  First of all, don't be worried by the lack of eggs.  I was too, but you don't need any eggs in this recipe (honest!)  I have also used yellow squash which works equally well.  One little thing - I add 1 cup chocolate chips.  This serves 2 purposes:  firstly, it adds chocolate which is never a bad thing; secondly, it adds a little smooth texture which helps make the zucchini unnoticeable (I didn't add the nuts simply because I don't like them in my brownies).  I used whole wheat flour which worked just fine - no one even noticed it wasn't white flour.  One thing - don't overbake these or they will have more of a cake like texture instead of brownie.  So over all - try it - you will love them!

Loved it! We used summer squash instead of zucchini, and it turned out GREAT! Super fudgy and sweet; very rich.

The "batter" was so weird, though. It looked so dry, like we'd left out an ingredient. You basically just dump it into the pan and pack it down like a greasy mud pie. 

But after they're baked...wow. So moist, fudgy, delicious. The top looks kind of weird, so that's probably why this recipe calls for a frosting on top. Nobody at the potluck could tell there was a vegetable hiding in the brownies. 

The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found the frosting to be a little lackluster. I mean, it was an okay chocolate frosting, but it wasn't anything special an I don't think it really added anything to the recipe (other than calories, I'm sure). 

As it's only May and we have two whole rows of squash in the garden this year, we'll be making lots more of these brownies in the next couple months. I'll be hoping for leftovers each time!

Followed the recipe exactly and the end result was good-produced a fairly cakey, but moist brownie. The batter was almost pure powder until I added the zucchini and the the moisture really came out. You can't detect the zucchini in the final product at all! Less impressed with the frosting, which tasted strongly of the confectioner's sugar-maybe more chocolate added would help. But the combo of the frosting with the texture of the brownie reminded me more of sheet cake than an actual brownie. While the zucchini blends right in without detection, if you like your brownies fudgy or chewy, this isn't the recipe for you.

After reading the reviews, I made a couple of changes.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of zucchini, one egg, and added chopped Symphony bars.  I halved the frosting recipe, adding a bit of half and half to it to make it smooth but not runny, making it a thin glaze to the top.  Turned out fabulous.

Yet another skeptic trying the recipe "just to see if this is legit".  Un. Freakin'. Real.  And I bake for a living.  I changed nothing.  EXCELLENT recipe as it is.  Best part?  The kids were not forewarned of the kicker ingredient and were none the wiser.  Two woots for Marian!!!

Every time I make these they get rave reviews!  Kids at school even ask my kids if I'm going to make them again!  I do not frost mine, only dust with powdered sugar.  I also do not use nuts, but instead use mini chocolate chips.  Quick and easy!

I'm not sure where everyone else is getting such a great brownie out of this. I made these and did not care for them. The top layer of the brownie is not moist and tastes salty. The bottom layer has no flavor and doesn't even taste like a brownie. I did everything exactly to the directions.

Very delicious.  I used Special dark Cocoa and left out the nuts cause my husband doesn't like nuts in his brownies.  I think it maybe needs a little more moisture.  I think I will add about half a cup of vanilla yogurt next time.  Otherwise I loved it, and my family didn't believe me at first when I told them it had zucchini in it.  I didn't tell them till after they ate it cause my husband hates zucchini.

These are pretty good, I blended the zucchini instead of shredding it which worked out pretty well except for some large pieces that went unnoticed. I added a half a cup of mini chocolate chips and some sliced almonds which made the brownies even better. Instead of using regular frosting, I used leftover european drinking chocolate. Becasue the drinking chocolate is so thin it sunk into the brownies which made them taste like lava cake. I will be making these again!

Edit-I don't have a brownie pan so I have been using a glass pie pan to cook these in. If you are in similar circumstances, definitely use only a 1/4 of the recipe for each pan. Otherwise the brownies will end up being runny in the middle.

These are delicious but super rich. I have a tremendous sweet tooth and they were a bit much for me. I will definitely make them again, but may try it w/o frosting or at least cut the amount for frosting in 1/2. - "batter" is really dry, but turned out fine

A satisfying substitute for the real thing!  I've made this recipe several times and to make it healthier I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup by replacing them with 3/4 cup of plain apple sauce.  I've also substituted half of the flour with whole wheat.  I don't use nuts in this recipe but I do add a 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips on top of the batter.  I don't usually make the frosting as we find it makes the brownie too sweet.  When using fresh zucchini, I microwave the zucchini for 2 minutes to get it soft and moist enough to stir into the batter.  However, if you really don't want anyone (especially those picky eaters) to notice the zucchini in the final product, use the thawed zucchini.

Excellent -- I was skeptical about adding zucchini to my favorite dessert, but with a fridge full of zuc's, I had to try it. And I am so glad I made it just like the recipe! The brownies were moist and fudgy with just the right sweetness. The frosting was the perfect compliment (although the brownies were delish all by themselves). I didn't tell anyone about the secret ingredient and NO ONE could tell these weren't the traditional sweet treat. I will be making these for years to come. Thank you for sharing this delectible confection!

Great treat. The frosting makes the brownie! I used butter instead of margarine for the frosting and increased the cocoa in the brownie by a 1/4 cup. A huge hit and irresistable.

I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup (full recipe). It was still too sweet. I had a small piece and had to wash it down with 2 cups of milk. Next time, I'd reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup. Thank god I didn't make the frosting. Were it not for the amount of sugar, I'd give this 4 stars.

Does zucchini in brownies sound weird? That's because it is. I am a fan of zucchini, and generally open-minded when it comes to recipes, so I decided to use part of my zucchini harvest in this highly rated recipe. BIG MISTAKE. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and the appearance and texture of the brownies were amazingly perfect. The problem was the flavor. Even after topping with frosting, they still had the distinct taste of "something is in here that probably shouldn't be in here." Obviously, it was the zucchini. I threw them out before anyone else could get near them. I highly recommend finding another "traditional" recipe if you are picky like me and prefer your brownies to not possess an odd veggie flavor. I'll stick to using my zucchini in breads (try Mom's Zucchini Bread), casseroles, etc.

I followed the recipe to a T except I didn't make the frosting.  I believe if the brownie was really good, the frosting wouldn't or shouldn't make a difference. Well, this recipe turned out very good...for chocolate cake!  Very moist and the chocolate flavor really shines.  But I was looking for a brownie, similar in texture perhaps to the one out of a box.  I guess I just want it fudgier than this recipe.

I really wanted to like these but I just didn't. They had a weird texture and not enough chocolate flavor. Not good at all!

This is very good, a healthier alternative if you will.  I have made this twice.  The second time I added 1/2 c apple sauce and I think that they came out moister!!!  Great recipe for using up zucchini.  Thank you

Excellent recipe for the brownies. I used about a half cup chocolate chips sprinkled on top before baking instead of frosting. My frosting didn't turn out and it was too sweet.

My "batter" was extremely dry I had to add a little water and even then had to press into the pan. Looking at the pics posted, sadly my brownies look nothing like the others. I doubt I will ever make these again.

Used less sugar than called for, but I added chocolate chunks.  Make sure the zucchini is really really really well blended.  Instead of frosting, I used powdered sugar.  They weren't as dense as a brownie, but not really cake-like, but we liked them.

Excellent recipe. Had to double check to be sure I didn't miss the egg--but didn't need any. Made it just like the recipe and it is fabulous. Very moist and tasty. Will definitely make again!

Hubby asked me to make them again... need I say more?  I used a little less than a full cup of sugar (raw and brown sugar) which was fine for our tastes. One things I'd change for next time was that I used a food processor instead of a grater... so the pieces were long this strands.. rather than little bits and pieces of zucchini. They were very dense and moist.. good for dunking in a glass of milk! (I didn't make any frosting, and hubby didn't want walnuts in it) (oh, I also ran out of baking soda, so I used 3 tsp baking power and omitted the salt)

These weren't bad, but I wouldn't make them again.  The "batter" was very dry and I had to press the brownies into the pan.  I would much rather make brownies from a box.  I just didn't care for the texture of these brownies.

I followed the recipe exactly but used a canned cream cheese frosting. My brownies did turn out cakey (without adding an egg) but they were very moist and tasty. I thought they were a little bland plain, though. Not sweet or chocolatey enough maybe. So i pokes holes in the top and drizzled just a little caramel sauce over them and let soak in before frosting with icing. Delicious! I would definitely recommend adding some chocolate chips to the batter.

Wonderful brownie!  I made it exactly as written.  Part way through I double-checked the reviews to make sure I didn't need an egg, but I just stirred in the zucchini and it developed into a thick wonderful brownie batter.  The grandkids had no idea that it contained zucchini.  I also like that the recipe is low in saturated fats because there is no egg and no butter (until the frosting...).  I'll definitely make this again and have no reservations taking it to a social function.

Texture was great. Smelled great. But not  sweet enough like brownies. I didn't make the frosting because brownies shouldn't have frosting- but it just wasn't chocolatey and sweet enough for husband and I. I'm going to try this again. Maybe up the sugar or do the frosting. I have lots of zucchini to get rid of.

I JUST made these. Ended up with 2 1/4 cups shredded zucchini. These are SO awesome, VERY cake like brownies, SO moist. I am wowed. I will ALWAYS be making these whenever I have zucchini. I did not make the frosting, but the brownies are not missing it. Very great recipe.

Easy, fudgy and delicious!!  I grate and freeze zucchini in the summer and divide it into two cup packages. When one of the kids needs a snack for school, scouts, or we're going to a pot-luck or other event, I take a bag out of the freezer, thaw, drain and add the zucchini to the recipe! Easy peasy!! We have found these brownies so rich that we don't frost them. Sometimes, I add a cup of semi-sweet pieces to the batter, too!  Freezing the zucchini breaks the fibers down enough so that when you add it to the brownies, people who don't like zucchini, can't tell that THAT is what is IN the brownies. I also like the fact that this recipe doesn't need eggs; so I always have plenty of ingredients on hand to make these.

Supper yummy and a great way to use the zucchini out of our garden, (you can only make so much zucchini bread! lol).  

I'm glad I read the other reviews and knew what to expect with the dry batter.  If you let it sit for a moment and then stir again before pouring into the pan it's a little less dry.

My boyfriend liked it but he isn't that picky.  Two kids really liked it and one of them are.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe for the brownies almost exactly ( I only added 1 1/2 cups zucchini). It turned out more like cake. It was very yummy and moist, but it did not taste like a brownie. I will make again but as a cake.

I just took the brownies out and let them cool for 10 minutes before cutting into them and they are superb!  While there is zucchini in the brownies they still are not the healthiest but worth the treat.  I input the recipe on another site to get the nutritional value without the icing (as I will not add it and it's really not needed) and it came to 141 calories per 1/24; again not too bad.  

For those who are getting dry crumbly "batter" I would suggest following the flow of the recipe exactly.  IT'S BETTER TO COMBINE ALL BY HAND WITH A GOOD SPOON AND NOT A MIXER.  When you make the sugar mixture combine until it turns a light brown from the vanilla.  Then sift in the dry ingredients and combine until everything is cocoa brown, none of your mixture should still be white.  Then combine the zucchini that you have FINELY grated, include any liquid that comes from grating the zucchini (this of course will add more moisture) then combine it all until you have a moist batter.  Don't stop mixing until you have a batter texture.  You may still need to spread the batter a bit in the pan but it will be a beauty once complete.

This recipe is outrageously good! Chewy and chocolately! Make it exactly as it is written! NO EGGS! I must say I omitted the nuts (allergy), and included some chocolate chips. And at the end, I poured more chocolate chips on top and returned the pan to the oven for a minute or so to melt them. They spread easily - I used the chips in place of the frosting recipe provided. Just a preference. My family LOVES these brownies! Thanks for a fantastic way to use my bountiful zucchini!

Cut recipe in half and baked in 8x8 pan for 25 minutes.  Replaced oil with applesauce, cut down sugar from 3/4 to 1/2 cup, used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour.  Cut into 16 brownies-only 59 calories each, fat free, and still delicious!

Excellent!! Picky non-zuke lovers ate this dish and loved it. Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe with us!

OK, so who doesn't change things? Add a 1/4 t espresso powder to the brownie batter, and a teeny pinch o' salt to the frosting. Ummmm.

excellent recipe to use up those big zucchinis from the garden! Definitely more of a chocolate CAKE than a brownie. I don't have a grater so I use a veggie peeler to shred the zucchini, then chop alittle finer with a knife. next time I make this I might add a cup of semi sweet choc chips to the batter.

I followed the recipe to the T, yet they were cakey.  I would have preferred a more chewey, chocolatey, fudgey brownie.  But as a chocolate cake it was not bad.  I liked how healthy it was, and the kids had no idea.

I would personally give this 3 stars, but my co-workers loved it, so I am giving it 4 stars.  It is a great vegan recipe if you leave the included frosting off of it, and it really doesn't need frosting, it's very moist.  It is not the kind of brownie you can pick up and eat, mine did crumble a bit - but very moist and fudgy.  It does satisfy a chocolate craving...  I'll keep it for times when I have vegan guests during fresh zucchini season.

I have to admit, I was a little skeptical at first. I had never even heard of zucchini brownies until I found myself with an over abundance of squash that needed to be used before it rotted! I came across this recipe and figured you can never go wrong with chocolate so I gave it a shot. And it was absolutely delicious! I did however substitue about half of the unsweetened cocoa for sweetened cocoa because I don't really favor the taste of unsweetened. I dont think I will ever make brownies without zucchini again!!! :)

Loved this recipe! I grated the zucchini (1 medium one yields 2 cups) on the smaller grate and although it doesn't look like much in the bowl (quantity-wise) it's quite ample for a 9x13 and will rise. Not as dense as a brownie, more like a very moist cake. Very chocolatey and just plain good!

Maybe I didn't read the instructions correctly, but as I was mixing up the batter, it just looked like chocolate flour with shredded zucchini in it...I did add all of the oil the recipe called for,but it just did not look moist.  I was worried as I was taking these to a neighborhood pot luck in an hour, so I added an egg.  Turned out PERFECT, but a little too cake like for me; however I didn't have any leftovers to take home so that was awesome!

Let me just say that this recipe is delicious.  But these are not brownies, they are cake.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't use the frosting (they didn't need it).  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for the recipe!

So moist...husband even likes them! Don't be fooled by how dry they are when mixing them up. After you add the zucchini, they become moist. Will make these again and again.....

I followed the recipe exactly. Nobody in my family liked them. We all love zucchini and thought it would be great to use them for Brownies. Well, we will continue to make Brownies the old fashion way.

I had a couple of small zucchinis that I needed to use and so I tried this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  I used some homemade applesauce instead of oil and I used a 9 X 9 pan because the batter didn't look like enough for a bigger pan.  Even my husband liked this.  The only complaint I have is that the frosting is gritty but I think that has more to do with the kind of coco that I used.  I will definitely make this again.

After I started making these, I read some of the negative reviews and got a little nervous, but I LOVED how they turned out.   I imagine it must have something to do with the freshness of the zucchini - I picked mine from the garden just a couple days before using it.  I used only 1 cup of sugar, fresh ground whole wheat flour, and added maybe 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  I also skipped the frosting.  We LOVED them.  They are a tad more on the cakey side, but still fudgy enough to be brownies we like.  We like thick brownies, so I made these in an 8x8 (or smaller) pan and cooked them longer (about 45 min total).

I was surprisingly shocked at how good these taste. I did substitute 1/4c of the oil for apple sauce to reduce some of the fat. Also only used scant cup of sugar. I grated my zucchini with the biggest hole setting which I think was a mistake. Next time I'll try it in the food processor so the batter is smoother. Shockingly the batter was super thick and lumpy as others had reviewed and it comes out tasting smooth BUT the top still looked bumpy so it definitely needed the frosting to cover it up. I only used about 3/4 c of powdered sugar for the frosting and it still tasted very sweet. Would definitely make this again for myself, we'll have to see if kids like it tomorrow!

I have mixed feelings about these. The zucchini got kind of clumpy in places and I couldn't distribute it evenly throughout the batter. Because of this some pieces were very dry (I ended up throwing those ones out), and others were very moist (and tasty). It's a good way to use up zucchini though. :)

These are the best brownies ever!  The zucchini makes a huge difference-keeps the brownies so moist and you can't even tell it's in there.

YUM!!  I was worried about the frosting,  I pulled out my powdered sugar and only had about a cup. . .so, I mixed the powdered sugar with the cooled cocoa/butter mix, added the vanilla, and just added milk until I got it into a nice spreadable consistency.  The brownies are delicious, I made them according to the directions.  My kids are begging me for more as I'm typing this!!

So good! To save time I threw the zucchini in my food processor and I used olive oil instead of vegetable and butter for the icing instead of margarine but those were my only changes.  Great way to use up zucchini from the garden.  These also freeze well, so you can just thaw, ice and serve.

Edited to add: I've made this recipe many many times and i've found that using shredded zucchini gives a slightly cakier texture, but if you put the shredded zucchini in a food processor and pulse it until it's small chunks (not a smooth puree) it comes out fudgier

These are delish!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out chocolately and chewy.  Don't be intimidated by the prebaked batter's consistency.  I will be VERY thick, and you'll have to use a spatula to spread it into the pan, but the zucchini releases just the right amount of moisture as they bake.  DON'T add an egg!  The recipe doesn't need it.

Amazing!  I make these all the time.  I put in a bit less sugar and I use 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil and it turns out great every time.  Make sure you shred the zucchini (not grate) - it needs to be shredded finely to moisten the batter.

LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM...YOU GOT TO TRY THEM FOR YOURSELF. Update: made these again last night. No changes, except for a thought, when you are overrun with zucchini in the summer, put in food processor, measure 2 cups for this and whatever you use for zucchini bread and you'll have plenty in the winter to use when you are needing something to fix for your family to get rid of those winter 'blues'.  This is what I do and they always turn out great...by the way, if you take out the night before & put in the fridge, be sure to put in a bowl to catch the juices.  Be sure to use the juices too.

Yummers! I worried that these were going to be dry because the batter seemed that way, but they were moist and good. I didn't have walnuts, so added pepitas. And since I was headed in that direction I tossed in a dash of cayenne and cinnamon to make them Mexican chocolate themed. Awesome! And without the frosting these babies are vegan!

What a great way to incorporate zucchini into dessert! I have made this two ways, once using the vegetable oil and once substituting apple sauce. The vegetable oil gives the brownies a more fudge-like texture and the apple sauce gives it a more sponge-like texture. Either way tastes wonderful and I'll be using this recipe in the future. My husband loves them so much I've already made two batches in one week!

So delish! Added extra zucchini as i did not want to toss out 1/4 of a zucchini. came out to almost 3 cups, but the brownies still came out wonderfully. My 3 year old daughter loved them. She seen me grating the zucchini and of course said YUCK, but changed her mind quickly after i told her that she was eating it. Thanks for a great recipe!! Will be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly (but didn't add frosting) and made my boyfriend guess the secret ingredient. I waited until he ate a giant serving and raved about how delicious they were before I mentioned the zucchini. He didn't believe me until I showed him the recipe. These are wonderful, even without frosting!

I really didnt like the taste of these at all.  They turned out very fudge-y just like the first reviewer stated (I was worried about the texture of the batter) but the taste was just odd to me.  I also thought there was to much baking soda in the brownies.  If I made these again, I would add less baking soda.  Thanks anyhow!

This is one of the best brownie recipes your ever going to make, bake, eat, and share!  The chocolate flavor is so intense without overpowering and the icing is a great compliment with it.  I follow this recipe exactly - step by step.  I only mix this batter in it's entirety with a spoon! It will seem like a failure at first, but once you add the zucchini (finely shredded and USE THOSE JUICES!) it all comes together!  I don't use a mixer until I make the frosting. I use butter instead of margarine and I melt it on the stove top and then add it to the confectioners sugar mix.   Also I have doubled this recipe and it still came out just as good!  The hardest thing for me is keeping my hands off of them!  We fight over them every time I make them lol.

10 star recipe! These are just phenomenal. They were a huge hit with everyone and I had many requests for the recipe. The brownies themselves aren't overly sweet, so the frosting is just the perfect addition. Super moist, fudgy, and delicious. Will definitely make again. Thank you!

These are very strange yet tasty brownies. The "batter" (I have a hard time calling it that!) was very stiff and crumbly before I added the zucchini...even after I added it the batter was stiff enough that I could press it into the pan. They baked up very moist, almost like cake. The frosting is very good, but a tad sweet for my taste...the rest of my family liked them a lot, though. I did skip the nuts, because my little sister is allergic. All in all, this is a good way to use up extra zucchini, but if I make them again, I will probably use a different frosting. Thanks for sharing!

Very good, frosting is to die for! Didn't have any trouble with wet zucchini, you don't even know it's there. It did end up being a little cake like, but was moist and tender. Thanks.

I followed the recipe: The batter did not blend, there was not enough liquid to completely stir the flour mixture into the liquid mixture, and the result was a crumbly dry batter. After baking, the crumbles remained and the batter was still a little dry, not the consistency of a "moist brownie." Didn't anyone else think there was too much salt? They taste salty and I think the recipe called for too much. Next time, I will modify the recipe to add more liquid (egg, applesauce) and use less salt. With those modifications, it should be a pretty good brownie recipe!

So wonderful!!!  We have made these many times.  I have also topped the brownies with semi-sweet and white chocolate chips when I take the pan out of the oven, so that the chips will melt just slightly.

Amazingly good, considering they have zucchini in them.  Definitely dense moist, tender, and tasty, but with a certain crumbliness more remiscent of cake than brownie.  They don't have the chewy texture that I love in brownies.  I would make them again, but only as a way to use up zucchini.  This time I made them according to the directions, but maybe next time I will try to squeeze some moisture out of the zucchini and add an egg or two.

These exceeded my expectations. Not only have I been searching for the perfect fudgy brownie recipe for years, and I think I found it here, these brownies could easily be made vegan by substituting soy milk for the milk in the frosting.  Without eggs or butter, these are significantly lower in cholesterol and fat.  I couldn't be more pleased.  I'm about to post it to my 200 friends on Facebook because this is definitely a recipe worth sharing. Don't worry about the odd texture of the batter prebaking--it turns out.  Don't worry about tasting the zucchini--you won't!  If you like mush-into-your-fork-and-eat-fudgy-goodness, then this is the recipe to make.

These are delicious and got great reviews from the friends I took them to.  One improvement would be a slight change to the process--mix the oil, sugar, and zucchini together, then measure all the dry ingredients--the zucchini will start to give out its moisture and the batter will be nice and thick but not dry at all.

Just incredible!  I took them to a party, and they were devoured in no time by all the kids. The parents couldn't believe there was zucchini in them at all.  When you are making the batter, don't be discouraged by the dryness of it before you add the zucchini.  It magically turns into cake batter when the moisture from the zucchini blends in.

Great brownies!  The batter/dough is kinda like chocolate mortar.  Use a fine grater for the zucchini and don't pack it into the measuring cup.  I also like to mix the salt with the grated zucchini to extract it's moisture, then mix the wet mess in with the other ingredients.

I made these brownies and OMG!  They are amazing!  (you will not taste the zucchini)  I made these exactly as written (minus the nuts) and made one substitution - I used half unsweetened applesauce and half oil and you could not tell at all.  A couple notes:  when you are making these the batter is very dry - until you add in the zucchini.   DO NOT DRAIN THE LIQUID OUT OR SQUEEZE THE MOISTURE FROM THE ZUCCHINI - you need this liquid!  These brownies are very moist.  Also, they are a lot like Texas Sheetcake Brownies - moist and fudgy, not like the brownies you get from the box.  Seriously, I could not stop eating these they were so amazing!  Oh well, the diet starts tomorrow :)

To address the "texture" issue some raters mentioned, I shredded the summer squash THEN finely chopped the shredded squash.  I also added one egg to add structure and reduce crumbling.             To address the "dryness" issue some raters mentioned, I added 1/2 c. yogurt which adds moisture and gives the baking soda more leaving power (baking soda react with the acids found in yogurt or buttermilk, etc).           To address the "blandness" issue some reviewers mentioned, I added chocolate chips and finely shredded dark chocolate to the batter and melted dark chocolate to the frosting.  I prefer an intense  chocolate flavored brownie.  I omitted the walnuts simply based on personal preference.           Finally I changed the order of mixing by combining all wet ingredients (oil, egg, vanilla, and summer squash) and all the dry ingredients in seperate bowl, then folded the wet and dry ingredients together.           The result was a moist chocolately brownie halfway between a fudgy and cake texture.  Small pieces of squash were visible, so maybe even finer shredding and chopping is in order next time.

Very good option for healthy brownies.  Wal-Mart only had 1 zucchini left so I pureed that and used 1 egg.  The brownies were a bit cake-like but I didn't want them to be too dry with only 1 c. of pureed zucchini.  They were tasty but even better with frosting.  I didn't have powdered sugar so I just bought a container of chocolate buttercream frosting.  YUM!!  These were really good and the little guy LOVED them!!

These are really good. DO NOT drain or sqeeze the zucchini for this recipe. The mixture is like sand until you add the zucchini-then it turns into a batter. We ate half the pan with no frosting, makes it taste like a chocolate snacking cake, and then I made the frosting for the second half. I prefer it with the frosting.

Loved them!!  They turned out good the first time I made them but the batter was a little clumpy, so the second time I put the 1 tsp of salt on to the zucchini and mixed it up first.  I let it sit for about 10 min before I mixed it in.  It made all the difference in the world, they turned out great.  I like the idea of using up garden veggies into a tasty treat, getting them in my kids is a plus too! Thanks!

These were great! I do think that they are a bit cake-like, but definitely a good brownie too. I don't know if anyone would, but don't make the mistake I did: the first time I made these, I used the coarse shredder (as though I was making zucchini bread) and I encountered the dry crusty top problem. The second time, I used the fine shredder (not the grater) and my one large zucchini was a gloppy mess, but my batter was perfect. So good!

I just made my 3rd batch of these splendid brownies last night.  Why?  So moist and tasty and every person I've given them to ate more than one.  They were all hesitant about trying them because of the zuchinni but got over that quickly.  I added a couple of tablespoons of brewed coffee to the frosting and also found frosting each piece individually looked cleaner.  I'm forwarding the recipe to people I know!

These brownies are very chocolatey, rich, moist, and a little gummy. They kind of stick to the roof of your mouth. My dad REALLY liked them but i think they're just OK. The icing is very rich and decedent, and there's a lot of it! This recipe makes enough for a thick, gooey layer. I used half granulated sugar for the icing (I ran of out of powdered suagr) but you can't tell. I used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of walnuts. You can't tell there is any zucchini in these brownies. They are cakey but not in a bad way. The batter is delicious, before and after the zucchini is added (better than the cooked version.) It is a complete powder, and then you add the zucchini, and it becomes gooey, fluid batter! Strange phenomenon. I did not drain the zucchini which helped the batter, I think. Also, I used a humongous overgrown zucchini which adds moisture. This is a good way to use up extra garden zucchini, but I don't think I'll make these again.

This will definitely become an "old stand-by" for during zucchini harvest!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 3 eggs to supposedly make them denser and less cake-like, but it still came out more like cake than brownies.  But, what a delicious cake it was!!! I also substituted mini chocolate chips for the nuts and added some cinnamon.  And, instead of the the frosting recipe I topped it with ganache made from just about 3/4 cup chopped Dove dark chocolate and 1/4 cup butter, melted together and drizzled over each individual cut piece so it would drip down the sides of each one for more gooey, chocolately goodness. Then I put them in the fridge for about 5 minutes  to set the ganache a bit. I took some over to my neighbor who looked a bit unsure about the idea of zucchini and chocolate together.  Not five minutes later he was knocking on my door to tell me they were the best "vegetables" he'd ever eaten.

I don't want to repeat what everyone's already said, but I thought these were very good.  For anyone on Weight Watchers, I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added a 1/4 cup plain applesauce; I omitted the walnuts and the icing, and just topped it with powdered sugar.  At 24 brownies a recipe, that gets it to about 2.5 points each.  Also, it really helps to have a stand mixer when mixing these.  Mine was thick, but not crumbly, once I mixed it up.  Lastly, it's probably best to grate the zucchini as finely as possible; it disappears in the brownie, but I could still see strands along the surface af it had baked, which is why I added the powdered sugar to the top before my kids saw it!

Batter was very crumbly and did not get moist enough even after adding zucchini, so I added 2 eggs and it was perfect.  Very moist, but more like a cake than brownies

I think there was ingredients missing form this recipe.  When mixed it wasn't moist at all.  I added more oil and 3 eggs and this moisted the batter and they turned out ok the zuchinni and walnuts make this recipe.  I wouldn't describe these a the most moist brownie ever.

I only give these brownies a 3 because my hubby and kids will eat them (they eat anything with chocolate).  I found these to be mushy...VERY mushy.  Like boxed brownies cooked for only half the recommended time.  Even though the family will eat them, there's still over half a tray left (6 days later), and I gave a plateful to the neighbor who supplied the zucchini.
If you want something chocolatey to make with your zucchini, I highly recommend the recipe found on this site Chocolate Zucchini Bread I.

Ok I thought I had really messed up when I was almost done and my mixture looked like powder, but wow after I added the zucchini it baked up to be moist and wonderful.  I thought these were great and with less sugar than most of the zucchini bread recipes I have.  Excellent recipe.  I will use again!

I made these last night, I ate one whole row of the pan before I put any frosting on these. They are GREAT without the frosting!! Excellent flavor and so delicious! I really liked the texture, a little crumbly but very moist and much more denser (is that a word?) than cake.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the nuts-I don't like them. This morning I put frosting on half the pan, just to see if they could get any better. They are much more rich and chocolately with the frosting. They would probably go great with ice cream. If you are not a true chocoholic or don't like really rich desserts, try these without the frosting. I love them both ways, and when I make these again, I will probably only put frosting on half.

Yum!  I used dutch cocoa (gives deeper chocolate flavor) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The finished batter was extremely dry, in fact, had the same texture as worms in dirt, which was appropos considering I pulled the zucchini from my garden, but the brownies turn out amazingly moist.  A much healthier alternative to standard brownies.

I made these as directed. (I may have been generous with the cocoa powder) I put the zucchini in with the wet ingredients, as one reviewer suggested, and came up with a thick, somewhat dry, batter. As they baked, the water from the zucchini made these rich and delicious. A great way to use up some of our zucchini!

I read the reviews, so I was prepared for the gravelly texture of the batter going in.  Wasn't prepared for the gritty texture coming out, though.  Maybe my zucchini weren't fresh enough?  Frosting made them palatable, but I will keep looking for better ways to use up all that zucchini - and stick to the tried and true brownie recipes.

the dough was very crumbly I really didn't think it would work there was no egg in the ingredients, but when I blended the zucchini it all came together. 
I hate vegetables and this recipe totally amazed me. It was my first time making anything like this so let me say they are sooooo moooist, I didn't even bother with the frosting .

These are our FAVORITE brownies and we have made them many times.   

A few tricks that I've learned making them frequently:
1)  Do NOT squeeze the water out of the zucchini - the brownies need the moisture from it.   The brownies will look dry when you mix them up but the zucchini will gradually release its moisture and make them fantastic.
2)  There are no eggs in this recipe - don't add them or it will affect the consistency and the taste.
3)  Do NOT overbake these.   I usually call them done at right around 25 minutes.  If you over bake them they will be very dry (I made that mistake once and was so sad, because by then I knew what they were supposed to taste like!).
4)  We've made a few substitutions for the vegetable oil over the years to great success (the vegetable oil as written is delicious).   Melted butter in place of the oil is amazing.  1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup applesauce is also delicious (and creates no discernable olive oil taste) but affects the consistency ever so slightly - it makes them just a touch more cakelike, but still among the best brownies I've made.

Hopefully our tricks from making these so much helps someone else to avoid a pitfall.  Thank you to the original poster for the fantastic recipe!

I would not call this a brownie, I would however call it delicious!  I made it as is and it is soo moist, just not brownie-like.  My family loves it.  We are going t be making it again real soon.  Zucchini is growing like crazy!  I will add some instant espresso to enhance the flavor and see how that does. (Not that this recipe needs to be changed!)

Best brownie recipe I've tried yet! I was hoping to keep the zucchini a secret from my Dad (he's pretty picky) but he ended up catching me grating it in the kitchen. He was extremely skeptical, but once he tried the finished result he loved it! My best advice is FOLLOW THE RECIPE. If you add egg or water, you can ruin the brownies. Trust in the recipe and you're sure to get a delicious moist brownie as a result!

These were fantastic if you like cake style brownies.  My husband and kids still don't believe that they were chock-full of zucchini!

This was...DELICIOUS. My advice to keep them the best consistency is to use your course grate for the zucchini, and not a fine grate. I've used both grating sizes and the fine one never comes out as good. Also, I use course sea salt when I make these, and the flavor combo between the bits of sea salt and cocoa are just...holy cow good. These were fudgy, and an easy way to kill my sweet tooth. I left the frosting off, and used a sugar/stevia blend instead of all sugar, and they were still KILLER brownies. I ate the whole pan in three days almost by myself!

When I think "best brownies ever" I think of ghirardelli brownies.   Texture wise, these come close if not spot on.  If you follow the recipe exactly the texture should be spot on.  As far as taste, they need a little more cocoa powder to cover up the veggie taste, and  I recommend using a high quality cocoa powder.  But really, these are excellent.

My brownies were far from dry. I know it says shredded but I pureed mine and used applesauce instead of oil. You can definitely taste the vegetable after taste but my husband loved them and he's a far cry from a healthy eater.  I still am more of a zucchini muffin girl but these are an amazing way to get veggies down the kid's and hubby. My 5 year old ate 3 in one sitting, so that's veggie and fruit in one dessert.  I'd make again,  and again and again....

These Brownies are yummy and  my grandsons are eating vegetables and they don't even know it.
I didn't have vegetable oil so I mixed applesauce and mayo together and they tasted very good.

Love these brownies - my daughter doesn't eat eggs so this is something she eats too - They were moist, fudgy and just wonderful.  Always looking for a new zucchini recipe and brownies are a favorite here - I use my frozen zucchini and make these all winter.  I was skeptical about no eggs - but not to worry!  They are wonderful

I loved these.  Used 1 large zucchini (about 300 grams) and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It was moist and delicious!  Definitely more like a decadent chocolate cake than a brownie, though.  My brownie loving friend didn't like that, but I actually liked it a lot.

Very moist and delicious! I made mine vegan by replacing the margarine with a vegetable-based butter (Earth Balance) and the milk with original almond milk. Totally cholesterol-free with no animal products! Awesome recipe.

Followed the recipe, they get big like cake but have the texture of a brownie. I don't like thick frosting so I cut that part in half and it turned out great. Coated the brownies just right. When mixing I thought the batter was to dry but once I added the zucchini it was perfect!

I don’t know what went wrong.  It could have been that because I squeeze the moisture out of the zucchini I squeezed too much out, but the mixture didn’t come together very well.  I added an egg to make sure everything would bind and needed to increase the baking time.  The end result was very good, moist and chocolaty. I also added ½ cup of dark chocolate chips.

Yum!  I wasn't going to tell my husband what was in the brownie but he found some green and wondered what it was.  I thought they were really good...I added a couple tablespoons of applesauce because the batter was really dry and crumbly and threw in a handful of chocolate chips.  I'd make these again!

Are you kidding me???  These are fantastic!!  No yelling people about my substitutions--It's all I had in the house!!  I substituted most of the  oil with pureed baby-food prunes (just under 1/2 a cup worth) I added 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil.  I have a no-nut family so I used the tiny, tiny nestle chocolate chips instead.  I only had brown sugar so thats what I used and added slightly more vanilla to hopefully counteract the molasses taste you sometimes get from brown sugar.  When they came out of the oven--I sprinkled the top with about 1/4-1/2 cup of the tiny chocolate chips b/c i didn't want the extra calories from the frosting and because I was starting to second-guess myself about the prunes.  When cooled only about 5 minutes--i thought they were good but with a slight prune 'kick" .  Today--they were fantastic--you couldn't taste anything remotely off--the chocolate chips really added to the brownie feel!  My only concern is to keep the fam from eating them in one sitting which could cause them to be sitting on another type of seat in our house :O)

Great brownies! Here are my changes: I used a little bit less flour and a little bit more cocoa powder. I also added 1t instant coffee dissolved in 1T water and it turned very chocolatey. Added only about 1-2T of oil and appplesauce was used to make up the 1/2C of oil. Like other reviewers said the batter is dry, but the brownies turned quite moist. Mine was done in 20 min in 8 x 8 pan, so watch your baking time. People will never know that zucchinis were used in these brownies!

Very Very Good.  I took the advice of other reviews and used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and just sprinkled nuts and choc chips on top instead of frosting.

These are the very best brownies I have ever made.  They are also the best I have ever eaten.  My husband, a true brownie lover, says the same.  I followed the recipe for the batter exactly, and the brownies are the perfect, chewy texture.  The only issue I had was with the frosting.  I followed that to the letter, and it came out too runny.  I had to keep adding confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder until it thickened up to a spreadable consistency.  The result, after a few additions, was perfect.  I am going to make this my go-to brownie recipe.

These turned out great and the frosting was wonderful too. Make sure you whip it for a little while to get the perfect creaminess.

I've made these exactly as written (awesome!) and healthier (using applesauce instead of oil and whole wheat flour. Still yummy!) Bottom line...my kid LOVES them and is getting some sneaky veggies. This makes me happy, too!

Holy cow were these good!  I didn't use the nuts or the frosting, and they were not missed.  I made two batches, and the second I used brown sugar/splenda blend, and I let the batter sit for an hour in the bowl, and the zucchini moistened the batter much better, and it was easier to spread into the pan.  I took another reviewer's advice, and put my leftover grated zucchini in the freezer in two cup pouches, so I can whip these up whenever I want!

I was concerned as I mixed the batter and even after adding the zucchini it was a sand-like consistency. I went back to my computer to double check the ingredients, by the time I got back to my batter it had loosened up, apparently the zucchini had  released some of their liquid.  I ended up putting about 2 1/2 c. of zucchini in it.  It then turned out to a "play dough" consistency, as one of the other reviewers described it.  Good recipe!

Incredible brownies!  My kids gobble these up as if they aren't chock full of a vegetable.  I do make a fe changes based on my baking preferences:  3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar instead of all white, plus I add a couple tbsp of instant espresso powder.  Makes the brownies so rich tasting!  Instead of walnuts, I stir in about a cup of chocolate chips.  Also used cocoa powder instead of flour in the baking pan.  Great recipe, thanks!!

These brownies are absolutely delicious!!  You can't taste the zucchini at all.  I made mine in an 11 in. x 7 in. pan instead of a 13 in. x 9 in. pan and they turned out great.  I took mine out after 25 as recommended because I was scared to overbake mine, unfortuntately I should have left them in a bit longer since the center sunk after I took them out, but regardless they taste great.  I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups because I don't like overly sweet brownies, added 2 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla into the batter, and added 1 cup of walnuts (I like nuts).  The frosting is great as well, a keeper for other recipes (it was so simple).  I also increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon in the frosting.  This recipe will definitely be a keeper!!

As others have said, don't be worried about the lack of eggs in this recipe.  Once you incorporate all of the zucchini, the batter will be plenty moist.  I made this recipe without the nuts (dd has an allergy) and I halved the frosting.  This created a glaze like effect on the brownies.  Every member of my family loved this brownie.  Delicious and so easy to make!

I am surprised how WONDERFUL these zucchini brownies are! Who would have thought that you could use a vegetable in a dessert?!  And it taste so delicious! I will be making this recipe every summer, with fresh zucchini from the garden!

Have made this recipe for years. My children always fought over the last one.(Now the grandchildren). The only thing I do is not frost them. After they are cool dust lightly with powder sugar. They are sweet and moist enough without frosting.

This was very interesting.  I didn't think it would all come together but it did.  Brownie was great but didn't like the frosting.  I will make again when the zuccini crop comes in.

I needed to use zucchini from my garden so I tried this recipe, and although it is very  moist, it does have a strange taste that I was not expecting. My son said it was was a very good chocolate cake. It is not what we think of when we think of brownies. Oh, and by the way, I stuck to the recipe except for the nuts.

Not sure about this one, I followed the recipe to the letter. It came out of the oven on the dry side, crispy around the edges (nothing a generous application of ice cream and chocolate sauce couldn't remedy).  The next morning however it was much more moist and cake like- still not great however. This is definitely not a brownie I'll make again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the nuts.  The brownies had a very good flavor (no zucchini detectable) but were crumbly and not fudgy.  I baked for 25 minutes.  I will make again baking less time since I still have zucchini to use up.

I made 3 batches of these for a bake sale. I followed the recipe to a T except I did not add  walnuts (in case of allergies). They came out perfect. I shredded the zucchini with a regular cheese shredder/grater, and filled up my measuring cup with 2 cups full for each batch. I did not have to press them in the pan because the zucchini added plenty of moisture, but I did blend/stir all the ingredients together for a while. When they were done, you could not see or taste the zucchini at all! They do taste better cold in my opinion, but I like all brownies cold.

I thought these were just okay.  I didn't make the frosting so this is just a review on the brownie itself.  The bottom half of the brownie is nice and fudgey, but the tops are too crunchy from the sugar.  The brownies have an off flavor that I can't exactly place.  I have made zucchini desserts before that were much better.  I don't plan on making these again.

This is my first review on allrecipes.com.  These brownies are AWESOME.  A friend of mine served them at her dinner party.  I loved it so much, I asked for the recipe and was SHOCKED to learn zucchini was in it.  I followed the recipe as is for the brownie.  No need for the frosting as I'm not a frosting fan.

These are delish. I grew WAY too much zucchini and summer squash in my garden this year, so I brought these brownies in several times to share with my co-workers and they were always a hit. I definitely like them best with the frosting, and I think they're better after they've cooled than when they're warm (for any warm brownies and ice cream lovers out there).

I wasn't able to find a shredder so I used a blender for my zucchini. Strangely enough, mashed zucchini tastes like walnuts. No wonder it's advised to add some, its just slightly awkward to have walnut flavor and no walnuts so I made sure not to miss out on them. Great brownies without the feelings of guilt!

I liked this recipe.  Made it as stated and it was, of course, fabulous.  I tried it again with SPINACH and that was also a success.  I hid four cups of wilted spinach in the mix instead of zucchini and my 6 year old couldn't tell!  I think the frosting masked it!

Ok, at first try I didn't like these.  I think they need to set for 2-3 hours before you serve them.  They definitely developed a better texture over time.  Also, without the frosting they weren't sweet enough and they didn't look very pretty.  The frosting definitely complements the recipe so if you don't want to frost them I'd try a different recipe.  Peel the zucchini if you don't want anyone wondering what the green stuff is.  I would make these again.

Easy recipe to follow and adjust to your fancy. The variation best received so far - addition of chopped caramel-filled chocolate bar ( about 6 oz), 1/3 cup chopped bacon, and replaced some of the vegetable oil with bacon fat. Because the caramel melts and spreads while baking, reduced sugar by 1/2 cup.

Meat, vegetable and dessert all in one - other than a cup of good coffee, what more can you want?

I find it easier to mix by first adding the sugar to the zucchini. The moister is drawn out out zucchini, which makes the batter easier to mix.

Pretty good in my book....family didnt totally agree....although chocolate-y and moist....these had an odd texture...almost grainy....had to also press into the pan....spreading was not an option w/ this very thick and grainy mix. Loved the zucchini concept....but I think may not make again since the family wasn't "wow" about them.....but thanks!

This was weirdest recipe I've ever tried, but it turned out so good I'm glad I gave it a chance! The kids loved it. If you ever need to make a non-dairy desert this should be high on your choice list.
The batter is very dry before you add the zucchinis. It turned out to be OK - as many others commented here before me.
I didn’t use frosting, but instead sprinkled the top with white chocolate-chips and returned to over for 1 more minute. Pretty and yummy.
Thank you for sharing!

not bad, I followed the recipe w/out changes but tuned out cake-like and crumbly. Will: decrease sugar to 1 cup, decrease baking soda to 1tsp, decrease oil to 1/4 cup and decrease baking time to 20min.

Yummy...I followed the recipe exactly. When the batter looked dry, I was worry but I followed through and I am so happy I did...these are the best brownies, you can't taste the zucchini in it  at all.  The texture is fudgy, moist, chewy like brownies suppose to be.  Wow...and they are not too overly sweet. I didn't do the frosting because I don't like frosting but they are still the best.

Awesome Brownies!
Thanks Marian for posting a real winner of a recipe. Nobody knew there was zucchini in the brownies until I told them. I confess I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I was short by 1/2 a cup for the zucchini, so I added 1/2 cup of spaghetti squash. Worked out perfectly!

Bring on the zucchini!

I love chocolate zucchini bread so I thought I would love these.  I didn't change a thing, but I thought they had a strange aftertaste.  The kids really liked them though so getting them to eat a little zucchini is never a bad thing!

Best brownies I've ever made.
Looked very dry before I added the zucchini however turned out perfectly.  Took about 35 mins in an 8 1/2 x 11 pan.  Used pecans instead.  Butter instead of marg.

These brownies were very good.  The batter was very dry but I let it sit for about 5 minutes and it became moist when I stirred it.  Even people that do not like zuchinni loved these brownies.

Followed the recipe exactly but added chocolate chips to it too. So yummy! It was already sweet enough that I didn't have to make the frosting.

This recipe was delicous!  I tried to hide the fact that I was slipping in zucchini into our dessert.  My husband saw and refused to try the brownies.  He gave in and had to admit that this was an awesome chocolate treat in spite of the fact that I snuck in a vegetable.  I followed the directions except used butter instead of margaine in the frosting.

Awesome!  Not exactly chewy.  Very dense.  Your choice in cocoa powder makes a huge difference.  My 4 year old nephew requests them all the time and as word as out seems, hetypically doesn't easy baked sweets.

I didn't add eggs, and they turned out cake-like for me. Also, even with 1.5 cups of sugar, they were not very sweet (without the frosting, which you might opt to leave out if you don't want them too sweet). The "batter" is extremely dry (you have to press it into the pan after "pouring"), but the brownies do turn out very moist, just more like a moist dark chocolate cake rather than fudgy brownies. They're not bad, and they actually taste better the next day. I wouldn't buy a zucchini (I used almost a whole one) just to make this again, but if I'm ever given a zucchini again, it will end up in these brownies!

spectacular! no one noticed it was Zicchini!! It was the best batch of brownies i've ever made! It was a little sugary for my taste, so i might do less sugar next time. Also i will try substituting Apple Sauce for the oil.

I actually must have done something wrong because my "batter" was so dry it wasn't even batter as much as crumbs of sugar and oil so I added 2 eggs and some extra oil to the mix.  Because of these additions the bownies did come out more "cake-y" that brownies but they were still darn good.  My Hubbie said the best he ever ate.  will try to make again without the changes but If I mess up again at least I know the changes wont effect the taste. UPDATE -  I have made these brownies 3x and the ONLY way I can get them to turn out is to add another 1/2 cup of oil and 2 eggs.  If i do not add these the "batter" is far far FAR too dry.  Not even batter really its just crumby.  adding these additions does make it more cake like than brownie like but it IS delish.  I wish the author could show me how she does it as written bc I just can't get it right that way.

I love this recipe.  I've made it numerous times now.  I bet it would work well with other similar types of veggies (maybe cauliflower, squash, etc?).  Thanks for a good recipe.  And I like the red pepper flakes.

I have no idea what I did wrong, but these didn't turn out at all.  It was crumbly (like struesel topping) when I put it in the pan.  Didn't seem to be enough liquid w/ just 1/2 cup oil.  I'm glad others have had better luck than me.

This was awful!!! Sorry! I love zucchini, we cant seem to eat enough of it, so I was very tickled to run across this recipe! I followed to a T! It came out flat and rubbery! 
I made another brownie recipe on here, Better than Grandmas brownies and those are by far the best brownie ever!! 
Sorry for the poor rating, but was very disapointed!

I made this recipe gluten-free by substituting 1 cup sweet sorgham flour, 1/2 cup tapioca starch, 1/2 cup brown rice flour, & a tsp of xanthan gum for the all-purpose flour.  I was also out of cocoa powder (had just used the last of it in a similar zucchini cake but was in the mood for something more brownie-like), so I used carob instead.  I didn't add the nuts.  

Like others said I was a bit skeptical to see how dry this recipe was before baking.  Mine did come out a little bit cake-like, but it was still thick and moist.  I smooshed the pieces down a little bit after cutting and that helped give it a more brownie-like texture that wasn't quite as cake-y.

I'm new to gluten-free baking and have been having a hard time finding combos that well, don't taste gluten-free, but I've used the above combo to substitute for wheat flour in a number of cake and fruit/veggie bread recipes and I'm convinced it tastes BETTER than the wheat flour recipes!  These brownies sure hit the spot.  I'm on my way to go make another batch right now!

Made these brownies exactly as written, with the exception of no frosting (they didn't need it!)  They were super moist and tasty.  I admit I was a bit afraid when I first mixed the oil and sugar and added the dry ingredients, but once the zucchini was added, it was a nice stiff brownie batter.  They were wonderful, and knowing they were made with vegetables took away just a LITTLE of the guilt.  Wonderful way to use up that surplus zucchini.  Thanks for the recipe, Marian.

these were pretty good, I was glad I had read some of the previous reviews as the texture of "batter" is definately not like the usual batter.I found the frosting a little too sweet , overall better than I'd hoped they'd be !

I needed a new recipe for all this zucchini. These brownies are tasty and easy to make. I left off the frosting and nuts but made the restof the recipe as written. So relieved to not be eating zucchini bread again.

This was ok. It should be called zucchini cake instead. It's not very dense at all.

Great brownies.  I agree with previous post - let the batter sit for a few minutes after adding the zucchini and it will have much more moisture.  The frosting is great also.

These were okay. They got eaten by the kids so I guess you can't go wrong. I just prefer more gummy brownies and these were pretty dry. Good flavor though. I didn't frost them so maybe that would have helped.

Just made these. followed the recipe exactly. Glad I read some reviews. The mixture was very dry before mixing in the zucchini just as other had stated.
 Initially I made these for my company potluck tomorrow. But I can see I will be making another batch. These are not going to last much longer! These are very delicious! Nice chocolate flavor. I can see how some batches might be cake like or fudge-brownie like, depending on the moister content of the zucchini.  The type of cocoa powder may also make a difference in the chocolate flavor.  Don't forgo this recipe! Definitely worth it!

Getting ready to make these again.  The texture was spot on for brownies and even though my son knew there was zucchini in them, by the time they cooled enough to frost, even he couldn't tell there were veggies in it.  (veggie flavor tends to fade with cooling.)  I found them overly sweet, but that may be because I followed another reviewer's suggestion and replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips.  I won't be doing that again, and may try to reduce the sugar a bit this time as well.
This recipe defies everything I thought I knew about brownies, but they turned out great.

I made this yesterday exactly as printed- but added 1/2 chopped walnuts (which is rare for me not to tweak it as printed typically!). It was amazing. I agree that it is 4 star without the frosting, and 5 star with. The frosting came out amazing too! Even my picky husband and children were in love. This is my new favorite brownie recipe!

this recipie seemed very dry to me but other reviews said it would be normal. i baked it just as directed and it came out still dry and crubly along the sides and bottom, the center was nice and the frosting was amazing. but over all, kind of a dissapointment. i would maybe recomend letting it set with the zucchini for a bit to let the moisture seep in and see how it turnes out.

These were good but not great. I made as written. The batter is VERY dry and crumbly. It will not pour into the pan you need to spoon it out and pat it down. The ingredients didn't bake together well for me. You could distinguish the granules of sugar still and see the unincorporated cocoa powder ont top.  I think it was because I used fresh grated zucchini instead of frozen. I think you need the added liquid produced when it freezes and thaws. I will try again with frozen because I couldn't tell there were zucchini in there and I always have these ingredients on hand.

These were alright.. A nice way to fool yourself into thinking dessert is healthy (this is not healthy!). I made it exactly to the instructions the first time, and the second time substituting butter for oil.. both times came out more cake like and crumbly than like a brownie. They were a good experiment, but I'd rather stick to my go-to brownie recipe - it may not have a healthy halo, but the taste and texture makes it a better option for us.

We followed the recipe exactly as written (minus the nuts) and it definitely turned out dry and almost like a chocolate cake mix.  The frosting was the only thing that saved it.

This made a very delicious...cake. I followed ingredients and directions exactly, but it didn't come out fudgey like I was expecting. That being said, the flavor was fantastic on the "brownies" as well as the frosting, so I will try it again, maybe using less zucchini...isn't too much water what causes cakeyness?

These are amazing! I used applesauce instead of oil and they came out perfect. I could eat them without any frosting at all, they are soooo good! I used bigger shreds of zucchini and like the texture it gave the brownies. Super easy and so good!

I've been making these brownies for two summers now and they are always the first thing I think to make with our garden grown zucchini!  I absolutely love these brownies!  They are chocolately, moist, and delicious!

If you are having a problem with dry batter perhaps your zucchini is too dry.  I usually grate my zucchini on the finest setting over a plate and then add the shredded zucchini to the batter first.  If the batter looks a bit crumbly or dry, I then add some of the zucchini liquid until I get the consistency I want.  I hope this helps!

Obviously I must have done something wrong because these did not turn out. The batter was actually dry.. no moisture at all. I grated the zucchini on the second smallest size (the one you hold).. I can't imagine that because the zucchini shreds weren't small enough that the brownie came out this bad. IT didn't rise (yes my b.soda is good) and it's all lumpy and grainy??? I don't understand.. I'm not a beginner baker either.

I was not impressed by these. The batter was so yummy I couldn't stop eating it, but the brownies were bland. Weird right? I'd rather add zucchini to an amazing brownie better than tweak this one. But for those who want to try this one I'd suggest adding more vanilla, more sugar, and maybe a tsp. of espresso (adds depth, but no coffee flavor). Good luck! Hope you like it more than me :o)

Turned out beautifully even though I didn't have enough zucchini (only 1 cup) so had to add water. Also, I subbed in sunflower seeds for the walnuts and my 4 yr old was thrilled to have, "crunchy parts that taste good!"

Delicious! I admit, they sounded disgusting and even as I mixed the ingredients, the batter didn't look like it would work. The key to make these work is to FOLLOW DIRECTIONS EXACTLY. Don't change anything, and do NOT drain the zucchini. The water from the zucchini is what ends up making the batter moist. If you add water or eggs then your brownies will not turn out right. My kids ate most of the pan before it even had time to cool. They stay good for a day or two, after that they get mushy and weird.

These are good!!  Love zucchini... only thing I personally feel like they need a bit more sweetness in the actual brownie... the frosting helped that a little but next time I think I'll figure in a bit more sugar or brown sugar!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a delicious recipe! I added an egg due to some of the comments saying it was dry. I also added 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips chopped up. This recipe was not dry at all, and it was gone in less then 24 hours. I would highly recommend it!

I thought this recipe was excellent.  The recipe did not specify the size of baking dish.  I baked the recipe in a 9x12 dish but I will try a larger size of baking dish next time because I had to bake it mixture an extra 10 - 12 minutes.

This was too dry to hold together even after I added the zucchini so I added a little apple sauce to get it to hold together. The texture is cakey not thick like a brownie. The flavor seems off to me, maybe needs more sugar. Overall, I am disappointed in this recipe.

I've gotta say the taste of these is really good, but they are more like cake than chewy brownies. I followed the instructions perfectly, didn't add or change anything. Great if called zucchini cake, will definitely make again!

Very chocolaty! I wanted to try something different from zucchini bread and this did the trick! It is more cake like, but very moist and great flavor. I was surprised no eggs were in recipe, I may try adding one or two next time to see if it will make them more fudgy. I did add 1/4 cup each milk chocolate and white chocolate chips to batter, omitted the nuts.

Ok I have to admit when I first started to make these I was a little worried. I was wondering why it was so dry but after I put the zucchini in, it moistened right up. They were outstanding brownies. My husband and room mate loved them, they only lasted 2 days!!!

Excellent! Some of the most moist brownies I've ever had. The only thing I do different is run zucchini through my little food chopper instead of shredding with a grater (I don't actually own a grater), and it worked out just fine. I didn't have any problems either with the batter seeming dry. I just stirred the zucchini in until the moisture truly mixed with the rest of it - it wasn't as pourable as traditional brownie batter, but these brownies flew out of the pan. : )  Very good recipe, and the in-laws loved it, too!

Incredible. I chose this recipe as my nephew has allergies to eggs and I wanted to make a birthday cake that he could eat. I peeled and grated the zuchini using a large grater... next time I will use a smaller grater as you could visibly see the zuchini on the top once baked. It was very dry pouring into the baking sheet but turned out moist and delicious. The icing covered up the zuchini flaw and it was incredible. Although already very sweet I may add semi sweet chocolate chips next time.

Amazing. I followed the recipe exactly except for using 4 cups of zucchini and no walnuts. It was TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!   Took closer to 40 minutes in my oven.

I found this recipe awhile ago and decided to try it. My children LOVE it, and everyone that has tried it can't tell it has zucchini in it. Instead of the frosting though, I put 1 cup chocolate chips on top prior to baking. This gives it its own frosting. Thank you for the wonderful recipe, It's GREAT!

This is a great recipe!! I made them once to use up all the zucchini our garden was producing and was pleasently thrilled!!!!! my huddy isn't the biggest chocolate lover in the world but he even got up in the middle of night to eat another. AS for the comments on the batter or lack there of I as glad i read them. if I had seen the batter I was producing I would have guessed it wouuldn't work and throw it out. However because I as warned in other reviews about batter texture I didn't worry about it. Just tipped my bowl over top of pan and then used my hand to even it out. Even at that point you can see the mositure in the zucchini making a difference. It truly was very very easy and very yummy. Everyone who has tried them has asked for more or for the recipe!! THANKS to whom ever came up with this great creaation!!! Now the zucchinis in the garden don't bother me at all!!!!

OH MY GOODNESS!  How can a brownie that contains zucchini taste so good?    They are moist chocolatey and ooey gooey.    I am so glad that I checked back on the reviews before I added anything to make the batter more "battery" because as a brownie, the dry batter turns out great!  A perfect way to beat that chocolate craving I was having, and get some zucchini vitamins at the same time. Ha!

I wasn't expecting much, but these were great.  They are not quite as chocolately as regular brownies, but that could easily be remedied by adding chips or something.  I replaced the oil with applesauce to keep the calories down, and also used 1/2 cup less sugar, because I was afraid it would make my teeth scream otherwise. I wanted the cocoa flavor and it has it.  Because a grated zucchini came out to 4 cups, I doubled the recipe and froze one and a half pans.  Maybe it's because of the zucchini, but I find these very filling; a nice added bonus.  I also found that it didn't need the frosting.  They are sweet and moist enough without it.  My gosh, this could be considered health food!  Thank you so much for the great idea!  I might even have to buy zucchini in the winter time to make these.  Then again, if the freezer experiment comes out, I might have to buy another freezer to store my summer's bounty!

I mixed this up following the recipe exactly. . . put them in the pan and thought "These are not going to be good, soooo dry."  BOY WAS I WRONG!! Took them to a cook out and everyone loved them. . . including me!!  I will use this a lot because I too get tired of making Zucchini Bread. Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, used chocolate chips instead of walnuts, and used whole wheat flour instead of AP because that was all I had. I didn't make the frosting and I thought that for a family dessert they didn't need it. I baked at 325* (which I always use for brownies since the low temp gets rid of crispy edges and undercooked centers) for 45 minutes. I've made a few times with the above changes. Really excellent for "healthy" brownies.

Like many others have pointed out, this recipe turns out like a chocolate cake, not brownies, so if you are looking for a true brownie recipe, look elsewhere. I think that this tasted ok, but probably not good enough to make again. Besides the slightly "off" flavor, my main problem with this cake is that it was nearly impossible to spread the icing without the cake crumbling, so I had to leave the icing in it's own container and spread it on individual pieces as they were eaten. The icing is good and is the exact recipe that my mother has used for years. Again, this is a decent recipe, but nothing spectacular. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

These are awesome but I probably used between 3 and 4 cups of zucchini just because I had a huge one I wanted to use up.  I stopped measuring after I had overflowed my 2 cup pyrex cup.  This made it way more cake like b/c of the added moisture but soooo good...I would make it this way again!

I don't reveal the zucchini ingredient until people have tasted the brownie.  They are better the next day when the moisture from the zucchini creates a more fudgy-like texture.  Expect a more cake-like texture if you serve this the same day.  Wonderful!

I made them with whole grain flour, and they came out great! These brownies are more cake-like, not overly fudgy, but still very moist and tender. The taste is great, but I think it also depends on the kind of cocoa used. I was very skeptical at first, and even more when I discovered that the recipe does not call for any eggs, but the result is really fantastic. I packed the zucchini densely in the cup for measuring and used it with all its juices, maybe that's what makes the brownies nicely moist and more fudge-like. I also mixed the batter a little longer, maybe for a minute or so (not really "folding in" the zucchini), and it became soft, just like any brownie batter, not hard or stiff at all any more (which it is after you mix the oil and the sugar).

These turned out ok, but they tasted funny to me because of the zucchini. My kids were not interested and I didn't even tell them they had the zucchini in them! They each had one and that is it. My 4 year-old chocoholic said they were gross! I ended up throwing away half the pan.

I was skeptical of this recipe but they really turned out great!! I shredded the zucchini very finely, used half applesauce and half oil, and left off the frosting. I served them with raspberries and I would have never known they weren't regular brownies. Thanks!!

These brownies are FAR from healthy. Probably very unhealthy minus the zucchini. Almost 3 cups of white sugar, white flour, margarine and veg oil. I suppose you can make your own substitutions to make it more healthy but then it would completely change the recipe. All this is is a basic brownie recipe  with some zucchini in it all the other ingredients cancel the healthy zucchini. Sorry, but not making this again.

My co-workers devoured these! I used 1/4 cup applesauce w/ 1/4 c. oil and ended up baking it for 40 minutes.  Make sure batter is well mixed before baking since it is fairly dry to begin with. Very moist. I will use better quality cocoa powder next time though (i used hersheys). I used purchased frosting. Either way, this is a keeper and a crowd pleaser

I was concerned when working with the batter that these were going to be dry.  I shouldn't have worried- they were one of the most moist and delicious brownies I've ever made.  I didn't use any oil- I subbed applesauce instead and I also left out the nuts.  I spread the glaze on the warm brownies.  These were super!  Thanks, Marian!

They were moist, chocolatey and just more than I anticipated for a recipe without eggs.  Think I'm making it again for the office and adding more zucchini to wig them out on the healthy brownies. We have a BUNCH of picky eaters and they'll NEVER know. Thanks for sharing!!

Very easy to make..used a 1/4 cup less sugar then called for in the recipe and come out perfect,, subed 1/4 cup of oil for applesauce to lower fat content.  Batter is very dry until you add the zucchini and mix well for a few minutes until moisture from the zucchini is released. Did not frost the brownies but will next time.  Excellent way to use up all that zucchini

I have to admit, not as sweet as I would've hoped, but very rich. Tasted good. I followed everything to a T except for the walnuts as I had none in the house. Next time I'll add more sugar.

AWESOME!!! I have had zucchini brownies before but they always turn out more like a cake and these are fudgy brownies.  I didn't even bother w/ the icing cause they are so good w/ out it. and less calories that way.  The entire family loved them!

These are so good! Great way to use up all this zucchini I have.  I did have to bake a bit longer than reccommended, probably due to the moisture in the zucchini, but very good end product!!

I would have given this 5 stars except that I, too, feel it was misnamed.  This is much more like a cake.  I made it once last summer but squeezed too much moisture from my zucchini and it came out dry, plus I didn't frost it.  Tried it again today without draining any moisture from the zucchini and with the frosting.  It is awesome.  My sister and brother-in-law and my 2 kids all ate 2 helpings apiece, and my sister even sent me a picture of herself eating more.  lol  Excellent!  Because this has no eggs, it's super easy to veganize (with vegan margarine and soymilk in the frosting) and somewhat healthier than regular chocolate cake.  I know what all the zucchini from my garden that's shredded in the freezer is turning into this winter!

The frosting is delish!!! I think it tastes like the can but better!!!! Thanks for a great recipe! I'm going to grate my zuchinnis and freeze them so I can make again and again!

I don't know if I maybe did something wrong, although I'm an avid baker. I thought the taste of the brownie was pretty good, but the texture was very weird. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it wasn't like a normal chewy, fudgy brownie. I'd say kind of like play-doh.

My KIDS love these brownies.  'nough said!  I LOVE brownies.  Most homemade brownies can't compare to the many boxed varieties I have tried.  THIS one came close.  I have done it three times now - and the first two times I added an egg because the batter was litterally crumbly before adding the zucchini.  The third time, I added egg with the sugar, and then I added in zucchini before dry ingredients.  This made for a much smoother batter.  The egg makes it more cake-like, I believe.   I'll have to brave it next time and make it without.  I really LOVE these brownies!
Make sure you chop the zucchini enough - otherwise the kids complain about them being stringy.  If chopped well, you can't even tell it's in there.  And the ICING - LOVE IT.  The kids ask me to make the icing for other treats that would use chocolate frosting/icing.  

Kids love it, parents love it, neighbors love it.  Hats off to the person who came up with this one - it's a real winner!

These are halfway between cake-like and fudge-like.  When you are scraping the batter into the pan, you might be thinking "This can't be right," because it doesn't resemble a batter at all - it is very dry at that point.  Even without an egg, they turned out FANtastic!  The recipe halved well, made in an 8x8 pan, cooked for nearly 25 minutes.  You can add 1/4-1/2 tsp. of cinnamon for a little extra something.  The frosting is GREAT, but I softened the butter instead of melting it.  And if you don't care for nuts, you can sub semi-sweet chips instead.  Thanks for a great recipe!

They are excellent.  A little more cake like than brownie like.  They are so good they don't even need the frosting.  When I make them I use olive oil, raw sugar and whole grain flours.  Very moist and delicious.

These brownies are magical!  They stand up to any brownies I've ever had.  You would never guess they're full of zucchini.  The consistency hit that sweet spot between fudgy and cakey.  I normally wouldn't add frosting to brownies, but I really enjoyed it on these.

These are fantastic! They aren't quite as dense as brownies made from the box but that doesn't mean they aren't delicious. I had tons of zucchini left over from the garden this summer and decided to try this recipe out. The only change I made was to add about an extra half cup of zucchini. They are super moist and delicious. When using the zucchini make sure you don't drain it before adding it to the recipe. If you drain the zucchini it will probably turn out more dry than preferable.

I made this exactly as listed and was absolutely amazed at how tasty they were. I was a little worried when the batter mix was so dry but found that after it sat for a few, the zucchini released some of its moisture into the mix. I still had to pat it down into the baking pan rather than just pour it in.The flavor was very good and rich and the texture was perfect. I have made a note to myself that the chocolate frosting was a little runny, but that is an easy fix by adding more confectioners sugar next time.  This was a very good (and tasty) way to use up some of the abundance of zucchini I have from my garden!

Simply delicious!  I never thought it would taste soo good.  I simply love zucchinis in savory cooking, but this was completely unexpected.  I definitely will be making this again, though I will probably use applesauce and less sugar next time.

The batter seemed strange and dry, so I reviewed the recipe.  I had followed it exactly ..  I was pretty worried.  Baked 'em and they looked ugly.  Iced 'em...  they looked good.  Ate 'em... tasted ABSOLUTELY devine.  Not a hint of zucchini...  so so yummy.  A for sure and a super way to use up zucchini.

These are the best brownies I've ever made!  I was a bit afraid it wouldn't turn out well because the batter was a little on the dry side and I had to flatten and smooth with a spoon to fill the edges of the pan but they came out perfectly.  You can't even taste the zucchini.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness and I didn't use the frosting.  Thanks for a great recipe!

You "almost" can't tell there's zucchini in these! EVERYONE asked me for the recipe! The chocolate taste was perfect- not too sweet. And the icing was phenomenal! One suggestion- the liquid in the zucchini is a must, so don't process a whole bunch of zucchini and use the desired amount of just the "meat" of the vegetable. The liquid to "meat" ratio must be kept.

I made these to use up some zucchini.  After I started making the recipe, I realized I was out of vanilla, so I substituted caramel extract, and made a caramel icing.  Everyone loved it.  I was surprised how you couldn't tell the zucchini was in there.  Of course, I didn't tell anyone that there was zucchini it them until they said how great they were!  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out much more cake-like than brownie-like, but it was pretty good anyway. I made the recipe as-is (minus the nuts). The flavor was much improved the next day, and there was absolutely no evidence of zucchini in it! I used the big holes on my cheese grater to shred the zucchini. The kids really liked it.

We followed the recipe exactly except using applesauce in place of the oil.  My daughter thought the idea of zucchini's in a brownie was disgusting.  But she is now converted and loves them.  She says she'll only eat zucchini's if they are in the brownies!  The frosting was delicious and really made the brownies taste better.

This is a great recipe. I was looking for eggless brownie recipe and stumbled upon this one...what a luck I halfed the recipe and used a 8 inch cake pan. Followed the recipe exact. It is a treat. I am a chocoholic but do not like things too sweet, whenever I try a recipe I always put less sugar than mentioned but for this one I did not since some reviewers mentioned it was not sweet without the icing and true they are. even for me the sweetness seemed less ... if u are not planning to ice it defintely increase the quantity of sugar. Next time I plan to try with applesauce

Well, I think if I'm going to add zucchini to a brownie, I'll start out with a brownie recipe that I like.  I kind of get the impression that this was meant to be a quasi-vegan brownie - no eggs, margarine in the frosting instead of butter, but then the milk threw that theory out the window.  It kind of does have that odd taste that you can detect if you're expecting a traditional treat and bite into a diet or vegan version.  First, I had the same problem with the "batter" being sandy and dry - I thought maybe it's because I drained my zucchini well, so I added another 2 tbsp. of oil, just to get the batter mixable.  After baking, they looked really good, but upon tasting them, I found the brownies had no real flavor - not from the 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup good cocoa powder or 2 tsp, good vanilla.  Personally, I think there was way too much flour in these, and it also needed an egg or two.   The frosting was super-sweet, which to me accentuated the brownies' lack of flavor.  I'm willing to toy with this one, so I might try again by adding eggs and reducing the flour to see if that helps, but as is, this one's just not for us.

Sooo good! I omitted the nuts because hubby doesn't like it in anything baked. I used only 1 cup of sugar in the batter, and halved the amount of sugar on the frosting. Still a little too sweet for my taste, next time I will not add any frosting.

The brownies were very moist and good. My kids really liked them.  I tried making the frosting but it was so runny I didn't use it.  It didn't need frosting anyway and would have sickening sweet for my personal taste.  I'll make again!

These brownies are amazing, the zucchini is easily disguised by the fantastic chocolate flavor.  I was surprised by the dry consistency before putting these into the oven and was pleasantly surprised to pull moist brownies out of the oven!  The frosting is very tasty & a nice compliment to these brownies.

Very tasty. Came out very good.. my only beef is that it seemed more like a cake than a brownie. I will make again and tinker... but I prefer my brownie to be dense and chewey.

Agree that it is more like a very moist cake than a brownie...but still very good! Omitted the frosting and nuts and used yogurt butter instead of oil; still good, but would have been better with the frosting for a more powerful chocolate taste. Everyone loved the texture and moistness. Next time we want to make a layer cake out of it with chocolate chips in the batter and a peanut butter frosting!

Delicious!  So easy to make & perfect results! At first I thought I had omitted something due to the dryness of the batter. I actually came back to my computer & read some reviews to make sure it was supposed to be that way.  Just as others stated the batter will be dry, but the zucchini will make it moist.  They were wonderflly moist & delicious, I can't wait for more zucchini to make this again!

These were wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly and was very happy! I used fresh from the garden zucchini and grated it very fine. The end result was a very moist, chocolatey dense sort of cake with a very smooth texture. The cake itself is very good and the frosting adds a lot of delicious chocolate flavor. We didn't notice any odd taste at all.

Oh man, these are fantastic. Trust the recipe my cooking friends. A word of advice, follow the recipe and you will get moist, chocolatey perfection. I've been getting rave reviews from family and co-workers. They can't believe there are no eggs and that there's zucchini in these puppies. I used a giant zucchini from our garden, which made exactly 4 cups (shredded). I'm going to shred more zucchini as it comes in to freeze so that I can make these in the winter. Yum. These make me happy.

Wow-super rich, melt in your mouth brownie/cake/whatever you want to call it. It's an ugly batter & I was convinced I did something wrong, but it turned out delish! Your brownies will come out looking just like the batter does when you spread it in the pan, so if you want them smooth on top, make sure you completely smooth out the batter when you spread it in the pan. I didn't do this, thinking it would just smooth out itself during baking & it didn't. The frosting covered it up but they weren't pretty by any means:) My kids & hubby have no idea these have zucchini in them-it just disappears!

I do agree that this is more like cake then brownies for sure. These came out perfect, they were SO yummy!! We loved them and I actually shredded up 2 1/2 cups of zucchini and used the advice on here to mix the zucchini in with the sugar and butter and let it sit for 5 mins or so, then I added the other dry ingredients in and it was perfect. We loved this recipe and will definately make it again and again, it's such an easier way to get our kids to eat a veggie that they normally would never touch. Also, I used melted butter and NOT veggie oil, since I think butter is a bit better for you then veggie oil is. Next time I am going to try using coconut oil, I bet that would be awesome! Thanks for this awesome and quick and easy recipe!

These brownies are so moist and yummy. The delicious icing adds an extra special topping to the moist cake-like brownies. It took my husband and I less than a week to finish off the whole pan. Before adding the zucchini, I thought that I must have forgotten something. The batter was so dry, but with all the positive reviews, I knew the recipe had to be correct. Thank you Marian.

WOW these brownies are amazing!  The mix seemed a little dry and crumbly, but I stuck it in the oven as is and it turned out wonderfully. Changes I made: I added 1/2 c. of chocolate chips and I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil. Instead of flouring the pan, I use cocoa powder. I didn't even put the frosting on top and they were still great! So moist and delicious! Love this recipe, thanks!

Awful!  Should have trusted my gut feeling on this one. I was gifted with several zucchinis from my neighbors and wanted to surprise them with something made from them... I made 2 of these EXACTLY according to directions, and had high hopes even as it was baking even though there was a sort of peculiar smell... I thought the wonderful chocolate icing would cover up any of the zucchini taste, boy was I wrong!  My young kids and a neighbor kid wouldn't even eat more than 2 bites of this.  The poor neighbor girl tried so hard to eat more, saying, "Well, I just am so used to the brownies my mom makes, these are just 'different'."  I made myself eat some of it, and decided there was no chance I was letting my neighbor who gave me the zucchinis have this... my husband laughed at me when he came home and I told him what I made, he tried it and gagged on it. The only bright side to the waste of these ingredients is that I've found a chocolate icing that I'll make again.  Trust your instinct and... DO NOT MAKE THIS!

Really, really good.  I thought it would just be a way to consume zucchini, but the zucchini actually add a very nice, subtle flavor to the brownies.  This recipe is worth making even if your garden isn't overflowing with zucchini and you have to go to the store to get some.  Don't use lowfat margarine for the frosting, like I did, it won't hold together.  I'd imagine butter would have been a better substitute.

These were fantastic! I made them as specified, but using EVOO instead of regular veggie oil and adding a handful of dark chopped baking chocolate chunks. Took them to church potluck and everyone loved them! They were all shocked (and a little grossed out) when I told them about the zucchini, but it didn't stop them from eating more!

Wow I am so glad I tried this recipe! I love the fact that it doesn't need eggs, which I only noticed while prepping the ingredients. I used 3 medium sized zucchinis which made abt 2 cups. It is such an easy delicious recipe! Followed exactly except that instead of walnuts, I used chocolate chips. It does turn out more like a cake, but a delicious cake, so not complaints there! I made the frosting using butter instead of margarine, and added a bit more milk to make it softer. Came out really good. My kids also looooved it! Thanks so much for this easy sort of healthy recipe!:)

My kids can't figure out why  I let them eat three of these each.lol.I made a few changes to make a little healthier.1)Used 3/8 cup appplesauce and 1/8 c canola oil in place of 1/2 cup veg oil. 2)used 1 cup splenda adn 1/2 sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups sugar. 3)used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. Also just sprinkled with powdered sugar instead of making the icing. These were still really great!! Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my God!!  These were unbelievable! Followed the recipe as written (omitted walnuts) including the icing. You couldn't get better at a bakery!  My kids had NO idea about the zucchini.  Note: the batter is like sand when you pour it into the pan (need to press it down) but they come out perfect!  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

My teenage son who "hates" all veggies, loves these brownies.  In fact he devoured about a quarter of the pan before I told him they were made from zucchini.  He accused me of lying and proceeded to eat some more.  I have made these many times, have given the recipe to others, and no one ever believes they are made from zucchini.  I make sure to peel the zucchini before shredding, the peel is the only thing that will give you away. Thanks for this great recipe!

yuck. I'll be the first to admit brownies for whatever reason are not my strongest suit.. however, these just aren't good.. even with my brownie handicap. Run a few miles, bake and eat real brownies.

These brownies are awesome...even with a few changes. I substitued 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil, added some chocolate chips, and about a tsp. of cinnamon. I didn't make the frosting, but they were soooo good without it. Make sure to reduce the baking time if using applesauce, about 18-20 minutes.

Wow! These absolutely rocked! I made them for my son's Kindergarten class Halloween party. The kids loved them and they had no idea there was a vegetable lurking in them. All the parents were whispering about how good 'zucchini brownies' could be and all wanted the recipe. The batter does look a bit crazy, but the end result is awesome. Mine were super moist and fudgy, not cake like at all. Oh, and I ended up using white whole wheat flour because it was all I had. That was the only modification I made. Just as a side note in case anyone cares, these can totally be parve! Just sub soy milk in the frosting and use non dairy margarine, yeah!

This was one of the top 3 brownies I ever made or ate.  The batter was dry, but I mixed it as well as I could and padded it evenly into the pan.  It still looked dry when it came out of the oven but it was so soft to cut and turned out to be really moist and dark and gooey.  I grated the zucchini rather finely and did not taste any zucchini in the brownie at all.  Will definitely make it again as it's the healthiest and one of the yummiest chocolate recipe I know!

Was a very odd recipe.  Not very sweet and a little rubbery.  I went without frosting - but it is probably better with frosting.  Also, I chopped the zucchini in my food processor and could still see tiny green particles in there in the brownies.  Not all that appetizing.

This is a wonderfully moist and flavorful brownie recipe.  It seems I can never keep my brownies moist past the first 24 hours, but we're at the end of the 2nd day after I made them, and they're just as moist as when they came out of the oven.  I like to test people when they're eating them to see if they can guess the "secret ingredient" of zucchini! This is a great recipe that I will be sure to use especially in the summer when our local farmstand is loaded down with zucchini. Thanks!

These are awesome.  My kids love them and I do too!  Very chocolaty.  I did decrease the sugar.  The first time I made them, they were pretty sweet.  I cut the sugar to one cup.  Be sure not to add anything else.  It looks more like a crumbly mess than a batter, but when the moisture from the zuchinni cooks out they are awesome.  Also better after they sit for a couple hours.  Moist and chewy!  Thank you!!

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I'm not a huge fan of zucchini, and my husband loves zucchini bars/bread. He suggested that I make a zucchini bar to use up our zucchini. I like this as a brownie, but he only thinks it's a 3 as a zucchini bar, because you can't taste the zucchini. Of course, that's why I liked it! I followed the recipe, excepted substituting chocolate chips for the nuts.

These were amazing.  I peeled and pureed the zucchini and added a dash a cinnamon to the batter.  I also poured half of the batter into the pan, topped with about a cup of chocolate chips and then added the other half of the batter.  Moist and delicious.

I was astonished by how good these were! My nephew has a wide variety of food allergies and I made these when he was coming to visit, hoping and praying they were as good as other reviews claimed.  I was not disappointed!  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, oat flour instead of regular flour, left out the nuts, substituted Smart Balance spread for the regular butter in the icing and also used rice milk instead of regular milk.  Whoa!  This allergen-free delight was an absolute hit, even with my other two choco-holic nephews who don't have food allergies. And they don't even notice (or care) what's in it - it's seriously that good. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Used the ingredients exactly as written and mine turned out more like chocolate cake than brownies. I'm wondering if it's due to the how much the zucchini is mixed in. The recipe said to "fold" in, but I mixed until I got a brownie-batter consistency. I didn't use any eggs, so that's not the problem. Still, it tasted fine, like a very moist chocolate cake. I'd make again, but probably in cupcake form.  :)

I am on a quest for a brownie recipe that I can't feel too guilty about. I think this is it. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda, and left out the walnuts, more due to allergies than calories. They turned out a little cakey for my tastes (I like fudgy brownies), but they were very moist. Next time, I'll halve the baking soda, and leave out a little flour. I used a simple cocoa glaze instead of a true frosting, which went very nicely with the brownies. I'll definitely be trying these again (and soon)!

Excellent!!! Do not change a thing.  The batter is very dry and looks like hot cocoa mix until you add the zucchini then it looks like brownie batter and according to my 7 yr. old, even the batter is sooo yummy. Perfect recipe*****

I did as another reviewer suggested- shredded the zucchini first and sprinkled the salt over it to let it 'sweat' while i completed the rest. 
Doing this made my batter very similar to thick cake batter, and not dry at all.
I didnt expect ooey-gooey-fudgy-brownie-perfection. But This recipe was 10 X tastier than I was expecting. The zucchini added a subtle earthy undertone. Everyone loved them.

I have returned to this recipe repeatedly over the last several years because of its incredible flexibility:

Its perfect for my vegan friends because it contains no eggs or milk and can also be made almost entirely with fair-trade and organic ingredients.  Adding in additional zucchini just makes the brownies more moist.

Its also great for those who are watching their calorie intake and for diabetics.  I always substitute apple sauce for the vegetable oil (1:1), and have occasionally substituted stevia powder for the sugar and the results are still amazing.  If I don't have stevia, I will frequently half the amount of sugar, also with good results.

The best part is, I make the entire thing in my food processor and dump it straight into the baking dish -- it couldn't be faster or easier. 

I highly recommend this recipe.

HINT!! add water to your batter if Zucchini is not moist enough to make a nice wet fudge like batter. Cause that is what is in the Zucchini to make it moist!

Really really good.
I tinkered with the recipe, substituted unsweetened applesauce for oil, added wheat flour, substituted soy margarine and soy milk (vegan).  My brownies were more cakey due to the applesauce but flavor is very good.  I also halved the frosting.  Total calories with changes - 155!!  I defrosted some frozen grated zucchini, so my batter was normal brownie consistency as the water separated from the zucchini during the defrost.

I have to admit, I was skeptical of this recipe.  But I had some extra zucchini lying around and I really wanted brownies!  I only had one cup of zucchini so I added 1/4 a cup of margarine and about 1/2 a cup of applesauce.  They turned out impressively moist and yummy.  I topped them with about half of the icing mixture, because I'm not much for icing.  We ate these still warm with a scoop of icecream on top!  I will definitely keep this recipe around.

These brownies are really tasty and there is no way to tell that there is zucchini inside.  My batter was very moist and easy to work with.  We found that these are less sweet and less rich than other brownies but my guests and husband thought that was a good thing.  I didn't make the frosting but planned to use a ganache instead.  I didn't have time to make it...  Next time, I'll try these with the frosting.  I would also like to try substituting applesauce for the oil, like other reviewers.

This is the worst tasting brownies I have ever made. No one liked it. I guess maybe with no eggs in it, it just makes it different. In our opinion, we just didn't like it.

Yum!  For a dairy-free, ultra low fat, and semi-healthy brownie this is excellent.  I substituted the oil for applesauce, but otherwise I made it the same.  I didn't make the icing and I was out of walnuts.  I found the batter to be really dry until the zucchini was added.  My boyfriend (who isn't really into health foods), was SHOCKED that there was zucchini and that they were so good.  Will make again and again.

I thought these brownies were delicious.  Chocolately, moist, perfect brownie-like texture with the added health bonus of zuchinni!  The frosting is very sweet, so next time I will make a 1/2 batch and drizzle on top of brownies.  Definitely our new brownie recipe.  Thanks!

I love these brownies and always get asked for the recipe.  There was way too much icing the first time I made it so now I always halve the icing recipe!

My children said they would give this one 100 stars if possible. They loved it!!! It was very good and moist. We did without the frosting and I don't think it necessarily needs it. We will definately make this again!

This was my first batch ever of zucchini anything and they turned out great. I was a little sceptical about the frosting cause it looked thin but it turned out really lucious and rich.

Since I enjoy the chewie brownie recipe on the box of unsweetened choc., I did as a few others and added an egg and an extra 1/4 c of oil. I baked them in a pan that was slightly smaller that the 9x13 suggested and since I added extras the baking time was increased. I did not add the extra choc chips or nuts, and I did not frost them either. These make wonderful moist chocolate brownies to enjoy with my coffee.......:)

We tried this recipe and had very poor results.  The brownie was gooey even after baking for extra time; and the frosting was watery.  I added an extra three cups of pwd sugar which made it very, very sweet.

This was amazing. I'm vegan and so the no-egg thing saved my life ;). The first vegan cake I've had that actually tastes delicious! thank you! Now... to modify so I can enjoy other flavors is the question..

This was very moist and suprisingly good. However, I will try some instant expresso to kick up and intensify the chocolate flavor next time. Otherwise it was a nice dessert.

This turned out to be an excellent brownie-type cake.  I cut the recipe in half, used an 8" x 8" pan, and added one egg as well as 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  The brownies were absolutely delicious and moist, even without the icing.

Delicious, but it's more a cake than a brownie. My husband thought that it was too much choc. with the frosting, and that a cream cheese frosting would have been better. I froze half and we'll see if it's good after it's thawed. Thanks!
UPDATE: I made it again and we could see the zucchini! I would suggest soaking the shredded zucchini in the oil first to get it really moist, and then continue with the recipe. It's the only thing different I did the first time...

These are super!  I did have to get back on the internet to double-check the recipe.  When mixing them up, they are extremely dry until you throw in the zucchini.  I also added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Frosted them warm because the family was waiting for dessert and served them with ice cream.  Excellent!

I was skeptical at first because I really dislike zucchini, but I wanted something healthy for my two dads on Father's Day.  I subbed half the oil with applesauce and half the flour with wheat flour.  I also pureed the zukes instead of shredding them.  As they were baking I could smell the zucchini which made me worry a little, but all was good in the end.  They were a little dry which is probaby my fault because I was short on zucchini, and they smell a little veggie-ish..But they are chocolatey delicious.  I will make these again for sure.

This recipe was so awesome, I was making it for little kids so I omitted the walnuts.  It looked very dry to me, so I added 3 eggs, and had used two very heaping cups of zucchini...didn't make the frosting. Tasted like chocolate cake, super moist (I would recommend adding the 2 or better yet 3 eggs).. and so delicious!!!

These were a hit with whoever I gave them to.  Awesome!  And I didn't bother with the icing because they were sweet and moist without it.  Delicious warm out of the oven with ice cream.

WOW...these are 5 star for a reason!! The best brownies ever! Don't be surprised that there are no eggs or liquid. The zucchini will add the moisture. The most wonderful way to get your veggies. very rich and moist..they don't even need the frosting! I add chocolate chips to the batter. Beware...addictive!!!

Wonderfully moist! I drained my zucchini for about 30 minutes to remove excess moisture and used just over 2 cups (that's what I had on hand). I also added the zucchini to the oil mixture. As always I used 1/4 cup applesauce 1/4 cup  canola oil in place of the 1/2 cup veg oil, used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached white flour in place of the 2 cups all purpose flour, and cut the sugar in 1/2. I also omitted the nuts...my children hate nuts.  I did not make the frosting just because I don't really like chocolate too much. I'm sure my family would have loved it; maybe next time!

These turned out great! I added the zucchini to the wet mixture and these turned out very moist. Did not make the frosting, I didn't think they needed it. I agree with Angela Sims. That is my biggest pet peeve, when people change the recipe, then give it a poor rating. How is that helpful?

This came out great.  As suggested by others, I added the squash (yellow summer squash) to the oil/sugar mixture first.  Then I accidently left it for 1/2 hour while dealing with some laundry, which drew some of the water out of the shredded squash.  I had no problem at all with dry batter.

This recipe was great, I loved how there is no eggs in it, my 2 kids have food allergies and it is hard to find good recipes without eggs or dairy. The one change I made was taking out the walnuts, they are allergic to nuts, but I added chocolate chips and they turned out great. No need for the frosting they were moist and delicious without it.

Just delicious. I used one cup of Splenda and half a cup of sugar instead of all sugar and it tasted just fine. I had to let the batter sit for some  moisture to leach out of the zucchini to get it all stirred up. The only negative thing I noticed was with the icing. It tasted great (I used half sugar and half splenda) but when it sat on the brownies for any length of time, they got so moist that they had to be eaten with a fork. They almost became like molten lava cakes, very good but hard to handle. I made the second batch and served the icing on the side so people could add it as they wanted. I think next time I won't make the icing as it was wonderful without it.

I'm not giving this recipe a three star because no one liked it, this is a great... cake recipe. I was expecting the usual fudgy brownie so this was a bit of a disappointment. I will make this again... but only if I want a cake. Thanks!

These brownies are great!!  I remember shredding up the zucchini and making the brownies but, when I went to eat them I was like where is the zucchini??  The brownies tasted too good to have a vegetable in them.  It is definitely a keeper and a recipe to pass on to many.

All of my roommates and friends were skeptical, but everyone said "YUMMY!" after actually trying them.  I was really hesitant as I was fixing the recipe because the mixture that I put in to the baking dish isn't what you normally expect from a brownie recipe (dryer than most) but what comes out of the oven, is delicious!!  Very easy to fix.

My husband loves brownies, and he said these were the best he’s ever had!  The only change I made to the recipe was that I omitted the walnuts due to husband’s nut allergy.

I made these according to the recipe and they turned out very good.  Very moist.  I was concerned with the lack of an egg and liquid in the recipe but they turned out very good.  Don't let the dry mixture deter you, it moistens up when you add the zucchini.

These brownies are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I omitted the frosting--they don't need it.  The batter does appear dry.  Once cooked, the brownies are moist and delish!

Another recipe that I have been making for years and never got around to reviewing. Excellent recipe, no changes. I consider thisr this more of a cake than a brownie. Whatever you choose to call it, this is delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly. (Except I halved the frosting). I panicked several times when the mix ended up looking like cornmeal. I still pressed it into the pan with a spatula and crossed my fingers and toes. When I pulled it out and tried it, it was dry and grainy. But from after lunch to after dinner they magically moistened and were delicious. I will make this again and know just to wait before digging in.

So yummy!  I opted to use apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil and used mini choc chips instead of the walnuts as I didn't have any on hand.  So far I have not made the frosting because I don't have enough powdered sugar in the house, but they are great without it.  My 10 year old daughter daughter loves them and says she can't even taste the zucchini!

10/09/16 UPDATE
Just made these for a second time... this time without the chocolate chips (because I forgot) and I still don't have the nuts.  I did make the frosting and it is delish.. Next time I think I will make it without the frosting for my vegan family members at a family gathering as the brownies are moist and flavorful without  it.

I made these today for my Birthday "cake".
The trick with this recipe is you have to use the dark green zucchini, grate them finely and pack it down to make the two cups. I stirred the salt into the zucchini and let it sit while mixing the next steps. I used coconut oil instead if vegetable oil. I used 3/4 cup of the sugar.  Folding the zucchini into the dry mixture gave me a nice workout but it wasn't crazy hard to do. *(make sure you look through the mixture to ensure there aren't any dry spots) I greased a 13x9 aluminum pan with a paper towel with coconut oil. No flour. You could use cocoa ( if you don't want white residue) I lowered the oven temp to 325 degrees because my oven is fast. I baked it for 25 minutes. They came out moist looking but not over cooked. The brownies pulled away from the sides with my fingers easily, so I know they won't stick. You can see bits of the green skin but the zucchini had cooked into the recipe well from what I see so far. * If you really wanted to "hide" the fact there is zucchini in these, you could lightly peel them so it's just the inside,. Then it will just blend with the nuts, if you use them. I used pecans. 
I made the frosting as directed, but used butter and unsweetened almond milk. It's a really nice consistency and not crazy sweet. I can't review the taste yet because I will have one tonight at my daughters house at my birthday dinner :) I'm so impressed with the rich chocolate color of the finished product as well as the icing

These are SO GOOD.  They do seem more like a dense, very moist cake, but whatever you call em theyre worth every minute spent making them and every calorie - if I go up a size eating these I will have no regrets.  My 20 yo son said theyre "too chocolatey," but i didnt realize too chocolatey was possible ??

Great recipe. First i was skeptical as the consistency wasn't like a usual batter but when all done was amazed of the result. I only used 1 cup of sugar and used wholemeal flour instead of white. I also avoided the glazing altogether to make it more healthy  .

I have made this several times and it really is delicious! The only change I made was to leave out the nuts, and to purée the zucchini because of ease. Great recipe that could be good with many different frostings. I've even eaten it without frosting - and would call it a cross between cake and a fudge brownie.

This is an excellent recipe! I made them just as is and my family ate the whole pan in 2 days. I didn't tell my younger kids that it had zucchini in it and they never even noticed. My husband was nervous and even he loved them. This ones a new hit in this house!!!

This is the best brownie recipe I've ever tried!!  When I told my husband I was making zucchini brownies I could tell he was a bit skeptical, but he has devoured them.  They are moist and flavorful and oh so delicious.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting applesauce for the oil (which is something I almost always do in baking dessert recipes).  I definitely prefer this recipe to those I have tried that use semi-sweet morsels rather than cocoa powder for the chocolate flavor.  It gave them a much nicer texture and body.  I also loved the frosting which was basic but not overly sweet.  Thank you Marian.  This one is a keeper.

DELICIOUS! These are the best brownies I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly (except the walnuts due to allergies) and they were perfect. Since I grow my own zucchini this is a great way to use them up. This is a must save recipe for me:)

My brownies came out as cake not brownie. (I did not add eggs.) I am going to try them again with two changes: I will NOT drain the zucchini and I will slightly under-cook them. ALSO: shredding is not the same thing as grating. I finely grated my zucchini because it made more sense to me than shredding them as far as final texture. I often have this dilemma with recipes.

I followed the directions exactly… Except I finely grated the zucchini, put it in a bowl and sprinkled the salt that is required in the ingredient over it and let it set a bit… as suggested by another review…. I have a church group where one person is allergic to eggs so this recipe was what I needed…. when my church group tasted it, they did not know nor taste the zucchini in it…

I was skeptical, but these are DELISH!!!! I made some substitutions to make them a little healthier and contain less refined sugar and eliminated some of the fats. I used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, but then used 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, which equals the 1/2 cup of oil. Then, instead of 1.5 cups of sugar, I used 3/4 organic cane sugar and 3T of raw honey (when subbing honey for sugar, only use 1/4 of the amount of sugar: i.e. 3/4 cup left of sugar, divided by 4 is 3T (12T = 3/4 of cup, so a quarter of 12 is 3T)). For the flour, I used 1.5 cups of white flour and for the remaining 1/2 cup, I used whole wheat flour (I didn't want to add too much, in case is drastically changed the flavor, so I added a small amount this time. Next time I will definitely do 1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat. I like to gradually add whole wheat flour to recipes to see how I like the taste). I also shredded the zucchini with my Microplane, so the brownies have no shreds of zucchini in them. 

As for the icing, I used 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup of unsweetened applesauce again (to equal the 1/4 cup of margarine). Instead of 2 cups confectioners sugar, I used 1 cup confectioners sugar and 1/4 cup of raw honey. I also did not add all the milk as the honey is obviously runny, so I used about half, which actually was probably too much as the icing is a bit runny - but I just stuck it in the fridge to make it thicker. The icing probably has more of a honey taste, but it's still deliciously sweet!

I have to admit that I added a cup of water.  After following the recipe, I got a crumbly, grainy substance that I don't see how I could have spread into a baking dish. But with water it was fine. I also substituted raisins for the nuts and butter for the margarine in the frosting recipe.

I grated my zucchini very fine. The batter once I added the zucchini was not dry at all but was very moist. Everyone in the family loved it. I have made it twice now and has come out perfect every time. The frosting is perfect. I followed the recipe to the letter no changes were necessary. The zucchini is the key it has to be finely grated and the batter does require quite a bit of mixing to get the zucchini mixed in completely.

These were a HIT!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out GREAT!  No one even suspected there was something HEALTHY hidden inside!  :)  The frosting is awesome too!  Definitely a KEEPER!

This is a nice recipe for using zucchini.  It is really important to make sure to stir the batter really well to incorporate the zucchini since it and the oil are the only moisture in the recipe.  Next time I will add a bit more (pack my measuring cup) zucchini as some of my brownies were a little dry on the edges.  Tasted like cake mix in places and I needed to stir it more or add more zucchini.  Either way I will make them again.  Frosting is great!

I made the recipe just as it was with 1 exception. I had an over-abundance of cucumbers, so I used them instead of zucchini. I just made sure to drain them after shredding because they are a lot wetter than the squash. It worked great, and tasted good. My sons loved them, and my dad never noticed there were cucumbers in them. I have substituted cucumbers for zucchini in recipes for years when I had a lot. Always seems to work well. Yellow summer squash would probably work well in this, too.

Made these without nuts. They were deliciously moist. Hint: After adding zucchini, stir well, then let sit for 5-10 minutes to allow moisture in zucchini to mix with dry ingredients. Stir again and you'll go from a dry sandy-looking mixture to a batter. I ate them without frosting and loved them.

Well I have to tell you.  I truly am not a zucchini lover.  This recipe I will use again as you cannot tell there is zucchini in the recipe.  I thought I was seeing things though when there was no egg or other liquid other then the oil.  So because of that I added some egg and it turned so nice.  I am going to try it without egg and I am also going to use gluten free flour so that other members of my family can enjoy these brownies as much as I did.  Oh yes before I forget I also added 1/2 cup less sugar and it was still awesome.

Since I'm way past getting zucchini from the garden, I used a quart Ziploc bag of my frozen shredded zucchini, thawed and drained (not squeezed drained, just gravity drained in a colander so there was still plenty of moisture in it). I also used my mixer to combine the oil and sugar, and add in the flour mixture. Then I folded in the zucchini. These brownies were cakey in a yummy moist, dense and crumbly way - not exactly brownies, but definitely not cake. By the second or third day (if they haven't been all eaten), they get more brownie-like in texture. The frozen zucchini was not obvious in the baked product. I used it as the base for my vegan chocolate trifle. Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly, and the "batter" was just crumbs.  There's no water-soluble liquid, or eggs, called for.  "Well," I thought, "maybe the zucchini will release moisture as it bakes."  Nope.  Perhaps a little, but not nearly enough to turn these dry crumbles into brownies.  I'm still excited about another way to use up zucchini, but in the future I'll add some liquid.

These were moist, not too sweet, and a balance between fudgy and cakey.  I left out the nuts and didn't frost, but they were still good.

Delicious - very moist and chocolatey even without the frosting, I will keep this recipe and use it whenever my garden overflowth.  To everyone put off by the bad reviews saying that its dry and grainy…where the recipe says to fold in the grated zucchini - don't just give it a stir and call it good.  if you keep mixing, the water comes out of the squash and it turns into a totally different consistency.  At first it was very grainy and weird but after stirring it looked just like conventional brownie batter and baked up like it too.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

Have faith!  You don't need the egg.  You don't need to add more liquid.  The liquid is all there, it's just hiding in the zucchini.  The batter will appear to be dry, but it's not. Try following the recipe as written the first time.  We loved these.  They freeze well, if there are any left around that might be frozen.

I made this exactly as written, without eggs, and it was very dry.  When I mixed the oil and sugar together, as instructed, I thought that it looked dry but figured that the zucchini added the moisture that eggs would.  This did not happen.  I ate a bit of this because I was desperate for a brownie, but I will not make these again.

This is probably my family's favorite brownie recipe.  I think it comes out more like a Taxas Sheetcake for me, but it is fabulous.  The frosting reciped is 10 stars!  I use butter instead of margarine.  Great way to use the overabundance of zuccs.

Really, really good--my picky son had no clue these were made with zucchini!  But mine DID turn out like cake even though I followed the recipe exactly (except for omitting the nuts).  Everyone who has tried them describes them as cake, not brownies.  I did not add any eggs or change anything else.  My zucchini seemed to have a lot of liquid and the batter was the consistency of regular brownie batter, not dry at all.  I will definitely make again and may try draining a bit of the liquid from the zucchini.  I grated mine very fine to make sure it was completely undetectable--and it was.  I may also try cutting the baking soda to see I it becomes more brownie-like.  (Also, I only made half the frosting and it was plenty!_  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

I was skeptical about the zucchini at first. Moreover, I could not find my grater, so I used a coconut grater which made the result like a juice. But after I added it to the batter, I was like WOW! The texture was perfect, just like you add some eggs in it. Then I added more 10 mins because the zucchini "juice" was so watery. And voila! The brownies was amazing! The texture was gooey which a plus for something chocolate-y, yet crispy on the outside. Almost like steamed brownies (very popular in Indonesia), but better (crispy outside, dairy free, more healthy). This is my first brownies recipe, and I'm hooked at the first bake!

I like that it is without eggs! Really like. Obviously these are not those decadent fudge chocolatey brownies (a true calorie bomb!) all we like. Actually it's a really cakey dessert. But it's cakey in a good way as it's still tasty and may be healthy (with a half of applesauce instead of oil and a cup of whole wheat flour). 
If you are afraid that your batter is too dry, try to blend your zucchini instead of grating it. I did it this way and got the batter of usual brownie batter consistence. 
For more decadence and fudge consistence I'd add chocolate chips. The more, the better!

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! So good, I really like this one because its dessert for my family but also has the zucchini in it. My seven year old will eat anything chocolate and nothing healthy so I really like this one. Unsure of it while mixing but the zucchini added the moisture that it needed! Great one!!!! ??

OMGoodness, soooo delicious!!! The only thing I did different was to use unsweetened apple sauce in place of the oil and they were the most delicious, moist, fudgy brownies I have ever made. (To make sure they stay fudgy and not cake-like, simply underbake them a tiny bit and you will love the results!!) I especially love that they are a healthy, low cal version of a very decadent snack. Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummm!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had several zucchini from my garden and the first one I grated seemed rather dry so I used another that was more moist.  After adding the zucchini the batter was sticky and gooey.  My son stuck his finger in the batter and tasted it and said that's good.  These did not turn out cake like at all but very moist and gooey.  The only thing I changed was  omitting the nuts since I have a child who is allergic and in place of that I followed another reviewer and added 1/2 c chocolate chips.    I won't do that next time as these are very rich and chocolaty.  This recipe is a keeper.  If it weren't for the sugar these would be extremely good for you.  My whole family loved them and my older son didn't believe there was zucchini in them.

I just made these with the last of the zucchini. I was not impressed with them. They did have a chocolate flavor but definitely not like a brownie or a cake--more like a coffeecake. I didn't use icing as my family is not big on icing on anything. Since I do have frozen zucchini, this is not what I do with it. I followed the recipe exactly as written but let out the nuts (not big fan). I was disappointed with this.

OM WOW!! I took the advice of some others and I chopped/blended the zucchini and then added the salt to allow it to sweat.  After mixing the oil, sugar and vanilla well, I alternately added about 1/3 at a time the dry ingredients and zucchini.  The resulting batter was a little thinner than what you would find from a box mix.  Definitely allow to mix well.  No hurries.  I omitted the nuts and sprinkled chocolate chips over the batter after poured into the pan.  Finally I did opt for the full recipe in an 8x8" pan baked at 325 for 50 min in a convection oven.  They were great! My kids who don't care for zucchini thought they were great!  It's a keeper for sure

Mix the zucchini into the oil/sugar mixture before the flour is added and it won't be so dry; the sugar makes it juice immediately. We loved it and so did our guests.  Cathy

I have been making these brownies for a few years now. Just a little hint,put zucchini in with sugar and oil ,vanilla and let it set for a few min..  Then add dry ingred. Your batter will not be dry.  This is the only brownie recipe that I ever make. Lots of compliments on these treats! Try it you'll like it.

Followed directions as listed today but left out the nuts since I didn't have any.  They turned out great. I took  the brownies to a birthday party. Although there was birthday cake, everyone was raving over the brownies. I came home with an empty pan. The brownies were somewhat cake-like but delicious. Several people asked for the recipe. They couldn't believe there was zucchini in the brownies. This is definitely a keeper!

These are by far my family's favorite brownie recipe. I have made these over a dozen times with various twists - gluten free, peanut butter / banana, and marbled with cream cheese filling... delicious every time. It is most definitely a "no fail" recipe. The only change that I have made is that I dissolve all the sugar in a little bit of hot water or the juice of the zucchini (if it was frozen). It helps to make the batter a little easier to spread in the pan and the brownies more moist. I have had many people ask me for the recipe after just one bite.

I can only assume that different zucchini give off vastly different amounts of moisture, because it seems like people are getting wildly different results. Mine looked like worms covered in wet sand when it went into the oven, and looked exactly the same when it came out. Underneath the top grainy, sandy layer, there was actually a fudgey-brownie-type layer that actually had great flavor. But the texture is just too dry on top. If I made this again (doubtful), I would definitely add some extra moisture to help the batter come together.

I made this exactly as written BUT added about a 1/2 cup chocolate chips that I was trying to use up. They were amazing. I noticed no strange veggie aftertaste that you sometimes do in these kind of recipes. The kids could not tell there was anything different in the brownies and they begged for seconds! Mine took about 35 minutes to cook which I think is important for the zucchini to incorporate all the way. So yummy and I will definitely make it again.

I followed brownie recipe exactly. Consistency of the batter was sand-like, as others have said. I had to press into pan with my hands. The brownies looked kind of unappealing when baked, and although I had not been planning to use frosting, I ended up making a chocolate glaze to hide the dried out zucchini flecks that were visible on top. The brownies were very crumbly and didn't stay together very well, and I could taste the baking soda in the recipe (I had thoroughly sifted dry ingredients before mixing). Tasted more cakelike than brownie-like, also. Next time I make this, I might add an egg (since it already tasted cakelike), reduce the sugar, and use applesauce instead of oil, because this is a better "healthy" recipe than brownie recipe. As a brownie recipe, I give this 3 stars, but as a zucchini disguise, this recipe gets 4.5 stars. Anything to get my kids to eat their vegetables!

I must've flagged this into my recipe box awhile ago, because while perusing through it just recently I stumbled upon this recipe.  What got me was the fact that it doesn't use any eggs, a bonus for me since I have a child with an egg allergy.  Just made it earlier today and followed recipe exactly, with one exception. Was going to just use the regular AP flour, but ended up using Bob's Red Mill gluten-free/wheat-free all purpose flour (same kid also has wheat allergy) so he could at least enjoy the brownies, too.  Like other reviewers had mentioned I found it was very dry when I first put the flour and then zucchini in, but I noticed that as I worked the "batter" the moisture from the zucchini made it come together.  Batter ends up being very sticky, not as fluid as with normal brownies.  Baked for 20 minutes hoping to follow that recommendation to make it more fudgy/chewy.  It's still crumbly, BUT moist.  Was a hit with all three of my kids.  Husband and I don't think it bad at all.  I docked it 1 star simply because I don't think it's the perfect, to-die-for brownie... but I'll be keeping this one for sure!

I absolutely loved these brownies and I hate zucchini!  I kept the ingredients to myself when my 12 year old wanted some. He loved them and asked me to make some for when his friends are over!  Zucchini i used had a lot of moisture so the recipe was very cake-like, but that's okay because I like my brownies like that!  I will be making these instead of the boxed brands! THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!

Other than omitting the walnuts, I followed the recipe. I found the brownies a bit crumbly and a little dry and a touch too sweet but since this is an egg free nut free recipe I'm going to keep it. I 'll up the zucchini and reduce the sugar next time. I wouldn't skip the frosting as it's flavor and texture saves this dish.

I have made this recipe many times, including serving it for holidays. My neighbors frequently ask for them. The neighbors 12 year old son used to help out at a farmers market and he had me make some for him to take there to give samples and everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.

Yay! A great recipe that can so easily be customized. First let me say I'm thankful to those reviewers who advised me to 'leave it alone' even though the batter looked too dry. 
For health purposes, I only used 1/4c oil and then a heaping 1/4 applesauce. I also only used 1/2c of sugar and used Stevia (the equivalent for the other 1c of sugar). Lastly, I added a 1/3c of extra dark chocolate chips. This was a hit in my household! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious, didn't change anything in the recipe. The batter was quite dry but after reading the other reviews I didni't worry too much. They came out moist and delicious, and didn't make it through the day in my house.

I really was worried about this as I was making it, as it seemed to be REALLY dry, but I followed another reviewer's suggestion to at least make them the first time exactly as the recipe says, and I'm glad I did.  These are really good!  Will definitely make again!  I did find the texture a bit on the cakey side, but the taste is great.

I have tried to make homemade brownies a couple of times and they would end up cake like. I found this recipe and read the reviews and had to try it. This is by far the best recipe for rich, moist, yummy brownies. I changed the recipe a little bit. I used sunflower oil in place of the vegetable oil. I also didn't use the full amount of confectioners sugar in the frosting. I added a little bit of peanut butter (I didn't measure how much) to the frosting and it was so yummy!

If you need more moisture, put your zucchini in a food processor and puree it. I do this with zucchini bread and it always come out very moist.

Don't let the thick conistency of the batter throw you!  I prepared these according to the recipe and found there was no need for any changes.  They were fudgey, but not at all heavy or dense, and were somewhat light and cake-like.  Thanks for a wonderful version of a chocolate cake/brownie that's even better than the one I've made for years. I couldn't bear to frost these once I tasted them; they are plenty sweet enough by themselves.

This is an interesting recipe, I made a half recipe in a 8 by 8 inch pan and baked it for about 20 minutes. The batter was very very dry so I had to press in into the pan. They didnt taste bad the texture was just very granular. I would try these again if I needed to use of some zucchini, but next time im adding a little milk to the batter.

I followed the recipe for the brownies to the T.  My zucchini must have been extra juicy because my batter was like regular brownie batter.  For the frosting, I had to add another 1/4 cup milk because it got thick really fast.  The extra milk made it perfect.

Wonderful brownies!  When the batter was so dry I checked the ingredients with what I had used.  No eggs! Dashed to the computer to find out what others were doing about that.   Reassured but still skeptical I went back to the brownie mix to finish.  Low and behold, the mix was moist!  The zucchini had let loose its moistness and the batter looked like real brownies!  They are delicious!

These are better than any boxed brownie mix I've ever had. My kids who usually only eat frosting off cakes/brownies loved it. Couldn't even tell there was zucchini in the mix. Needless to say I'm making these again today. Yummy!

YUM. Don't even notice the zucchini. I add 1/4 cup of corn syrup, a splash of milk, and 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips (in place of walnuts). Never had a better brownie!

I thought these were fantastic! Super moist! Used unsweetened strawberry apple sauce in place of the oil and cut sugar to 1 and 1/4 c and they turned out wonderfully!

Don't be fooled.   I was extremely skeptical of the crumbly 'batter'.  The zucchini does the trick and moistens it up.  These turned out so great, with or without the frosting. Highly reccomend.

Reduce sugar by 1/2 a cup and were still sweet enough for me. Very easy to mix up and a nice alternative to the usual zucchini cake. If the zucchini is shredded really finely, it virtually melts when baked.

Although the flavor was excellent I did not like the grittiness of these brownies which I think is due to the lack of liquid at the beginning stages.  I am going to try it with an egg and less sugar to see if I can ditch the gritty consistency.  Frosting was awesome!

These were delicious.  I followed the brownies exactly except omitted the walnuts as my family isn't crazy about nuts.  The icing seemed alittle bland but with a glop of honey, it was perfect.  These were gourmet style brownies.  Yummy.

This is a great way to use up some of your zucchini surplus!  However it does come out cakey (no i didn't add an egg)  I do however use frozen zucchini with all its liquid maybe that is why?  anywho it awesome as a cake I left out the nuts and added a cup of choco-chips and I use a peanut butter frosting instead of the one on the recipe...sooooooooo good!

Very yummy. I followed this recipe exactly, and I agree that these are more cake-like than brownies. Had this been titled "Zucchini Cake", it would be more accurate. As a chocolate cake, it is definitely rich, chocolately, moist, and tasty! I wonder if brown sugar in place of the white sugar would make these more brownie-like?

Great flavor but definitely a very cakey brownie.   Husband and kiddos loved them.   Subbed brown sugar for the gran sugar but otherwise followed the recipe.  Didn't make the frosting just sprinkled with powdered sugar.

I liked these brownies enough to make them repeatedly. I give it a 4, though, because of two things. 1. There's sort of a vegetable taste that usually isn't in a brownie. It's very easy to overlook because the brownie tastes so good. But it's some taste not normally in a brownie. 2. I like fudgy brownies better. This wasn't exactly cakey, but we did have to eat it with a fork. And no, I did not add eggs. Maybe I'll underbake it next time.

I didn't even make the frosting and felt it was fantastic! The mix was very dry until I added the zucchini, then I was able to pour into the pan. I used all the zucchini I had it was about 2.5 cups.  With adding the walnuts you can't even feel the texture of the zucchini.  This is my FAVORITE homemade brownie recipe! I did peel, deseed and shred very finely (the zucchini).

I too was VERY sceptical about this recipe.  I wasn't going to ice them but frankly they didn't look very good.  They look delectable iced and taste wonderful.  I left out the walnuts because not everyone likes them.  Instead I put 24 walnut pieces on the top to indicate the serving sizes.  This will certainly help cope with the bounty of zucchini in the garden.  I doubt I'll hear the family complain about this one!!

These are AMAZING.  I've made them three times so far, and I will never EVER make brownies from a box mix again - especially after freezing lots of shredded zucchini this summer.  I have even substituted 1/4 cup applesause and 1/4 cup vegetable oil for the 1/2 cup oil, and used half regular flour and half whole wheat flour.  The icing is also phenomenal - not like butter cream, not like whipped icing, not like cream cheese icing - totally its own thing and a perfect match for the brownie.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

These were the best brownies I've ever had! My kids had no idea there was zucchini in them. The key is to keep mixing the zucchini in until the batter has a play-doh texture. It takes a few minutes of mixing.

I was really excited about making these based on the reviews, but I have to say that I'm not a fan.  I'll probably make them one more time to see if they come out better as I do like to give a recipe a chance.  It definitely could have been my own error as to why they were so dry.  I don't think I could have eaten them without the frosting.

These were just OK.  They taste like a somewhat dry brownie but the icing is delicious.  I was going to just make the brownie but the icing definitely made them more palatable.  Myabe i need to add another 1/2 cup of zucchini?

Fantastic recipe, as written. The batter is the perfect brownie consistency after adding the zucchini. I thought it might need a bit more chocolate flavor, but my husband and son disagreed. I might add another Tblsp cocoa next time.

I was elated to find a zucchini dessert that was both simple and something I'd never had before.

while it was good, it wasn't anything like a brownie in my opinion. If you have ever made "Whacky Cake" the taste and texture is very similar to this recipe. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and only had to cook it for around 20 minutes as opposed to 30.

More like a cake than brownies, but pretty good. Batter was very dry so I added an egg. A good way to use up zucchini!  I didn't frost them--didn't think they needed it.

I followed this recipe as written however I omitted the nuts. The frosting is great. The brownies are super moist. I do taste a bit of an aftertaste from the zucchini. Most likely will not make this type of brownie again.

This is a keeper! both my daughters loved it, in fact my 10 yr old did most of the work. Only changes I made, was sub white premier morsels for the nuts, and added a small amount of apple sauce because the batter didn't seem moist enough. Also had to use store bought chocolate icing since I didn't have any powdered sugar, but it came out great!

Really Good! My kids love zucchini so I don't use this as a way to sneak more veggies in. I add a little extra confectioners sugar to make the icing a bit more stiff. I will keep making this one.

Very moist and chocolatey! They do seem dry compared to other brownie recipes, but just stick with the recipe and keep mixing!!! May have to lightly press into pan instead of pour, but the outcome is phenomenal! I had to add a little extra confectioner's sugar to the icing to get the consistency I prefer. I recommend refrigerating...so moist and yummy when they are cold!

OMG. Delicious. I have always laughed off that no matter what, I just cannot make brownies because even with boxed mix, they always come out terrible. Not these -- they were delicious. Somebody stated below they thought eggs were omitted by mistake; that's not the case. The zucchini provides the moisture. The batter is more of a "goo" by the time you're done putting the ingredients together, so don't be nervous. My vegetable-skeptical hubby loved 'em. Will definitely be making in the future.

I made the recipe using 1/2 splenda and 1/2 white sugar.  The brownies are somewhat crumbly and really need the frosting.  I don't think I'd call the texture or taste "fudgy" as other reviewers have.  I may make again and add one egg to the oil and sugar mixture.  It just seems to need something to hold it together.

I tweaked this a bit because I am trying to lower my sugar, so I only added a cup of sugar. Then, I did not frost them, but put roasted almonds on top before baking and omitted the walnuts. I was leery about not adding the eggs, but OMG these were WONDERFUL!!!! So light, moist, and 100% delicious.... and gone before I could blink!!! Thank you for this Fabulous zucchini recipe!!!!

Wow-what a recipe! I couldn't believe that this dry mixture would ever cook up to be the wonderful moist brownies they were after you added the zucchini!  Fooled me! I made them just as directed (unusual for me), but I didn't add any icing.  They are NOT that sweet (without the icing) but rather a perfect, very moist chocolate treat (pairs great with a red wine). If you like more sugar, add the icing, I'm sure it makes them sweet--but you can enjoy them without it!

Excellent!  I was skeptical at first as the batter was SO dry but I then re read the reviews to discover others had this problem and that the moisture comes from the zucchini!  My youngest son even licked the spoon after declaring he "doesn't like zucchini!"

I've made this recipe once a week this summer, and my whole family LOVES the brownies!!   I make it just like the recipe says, except I leave out the nuts.   If I have a little extra shredded zucchini, I throw that in.   They are delicious.  I will use this recipe all year!!

I haven't figured out what the hype is about these.  I added two heaping cups of zucchini and I still had a crumbly, dry mess on my hands.  I tried baking it anyway and it never really came together.  It was gross.

These are really awesome brownines. My coworkers didn't believe me when I said they had Zucchini in them. The veggies aren't detectible if you use the fine grater. The batter looked like a regular brownie mix with zucchini in it. I found it easier to mix with a fork rather than a spoon once I added the veggies. It takes a little extra patience when mixing these b/c the ingredients won't mix as easily as if u made traditional brownies. The results are well worth the effort. I put white chocolate chips in the top of mine.

We didn't find these too cake like at all. I have another recipe for these from another site and aside from the amount of oil and cocoa called for everything else was the same. I did add 1/3 cup of applesauce to these and they turned out great!

Fantastic recipe! I've often run out of eggs and thought that I can't make anything tasty and decadent... no longer!  Kids obviously LOVED them and I made them into a more adult desert by serving with strawberries and cream - LUSH!  I didn't make the icing as I didn't have time.  Highly recommend you try this.

Delicious brownies! I love making these with fresh zucchini. Easy to grate using food processor. I make using whole wheat flour and substitue applesauce for the oil. Also 1/2 the frosting. A great treat!

These are without a doubt, the BEST brownies I've ever eaten!  I was nervous that the batter was so dry but after baking and topping with the AMAZING frosting, they were so moist and wonderful!  My friend and I sat and ate the entire batch (and felt kinda sick) but still wanted more!  They disappear first at family gagtherings!!!

These were great for a "less unhealthy" dessert option. They definitely aren't a healthy option due to the sugar content, but a great option for getting more nutrients in. I subsituted applesauce for the oil, but followed the recipe other than that. I found the result to be more like a gooey cake than brownies. I think I'll puree the zucchini instead of shred it next time, as it did not fool the 9-year-old taster when she saw "the green stuff" after she got half way through the brownie (she had no idea before that though). The frosting is a must in my opinion, but you only need half of it. Overall, these don't necessarily taste just like wonderful brownies, but when I have a bumper crop of zucchini, I'll gladly make these instead.

I was very skeptical but interested in this recipe. Only revision I made was to add about 2Tbls of milk; seemed way to dry but they turned out perfect!

I have three children aged 9, 7 & 5 and they all LOVED these brownies! They are very moist and super chocolatey.  I think 'cake' would describe them better than brownies, however, as they rise higher than a brownie and don't have the chewy texture.  Two thumbs way up!

After reading a number of reviews, I was hesitant.  But having a garden full of Zs I had to do something.  Yes, the batter is dry with just the oil.  Do not add eggs, I'm sure it won't be chewy like you'd like if you do that.   I had previously frozen a large Z after shredding it (small grater) in my food processor.  When it thawed, I squeezed out most of the water and added one cup of Z, which was packed down.  It made more of a dough than a batter.  You'll need to mix this with your fingers.  Anyway, these came out great and my Hb came upstairs to make a point of saying so.  I ate four and didn't feel like I'd eaten too much sweet stuff.  Didn't need frosting.   Yes, strands of Z can be seen, but I don't care.  I love it.

This just didn't work for me and I don't know why. Followed all instructions and it was barely edible. Not very choclatey and the "batter" was so dry that the top of the brownies had a layer of crunchy sugar and flour that never absorbed moisture from the zucchini. I actually made this twice thinking I must have made a mistake, but got the same results again.

Instead of frosting, I sprinkled 3/4 c chocolate chips on top of batter before baking. Also took suggestion mentioned and added an egg to the batter. They are moist and delicious-better than regular brownies.

It is a great chocolate cake, but not a brownie!  It belongs in the category of Chocolate Zucchini Cake.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I bake all my brownies is an 8-inch square pan, instead of a 9x13.  I reduce the temperature to 325 degrees and cook for a little longer.  These were done in 35 minutes.  I will make it again, but will not switch from my favorite brownie recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong - I followed the recipe exactly (I used fresh zucchini from my garden) except I put in mini choc chips instead of walnuts.  The batter texture was awful but I proceeded.  The finished brownies were even worse.

I did not like these at all.  Even after sitting overnight they are still crumbly and fall apart when trying to eat.  I can still see the zucchini in them after baking.  I will not make these again.  I did not frost these as I didn't want to add more calories and I did use whole wheat pastry flour also 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda.  These could have made some difference.

I made these brownies last week and they were oh so GOOD!  Sent them to a luncheon and no one knew they had zucchini in them and raved about how good they were.  Left the frosting off as they were super rich without it.

Really delicious! I mixed everything according to the directions and even added the zucchini but the batter still looked so dry! I added two eggs and it turned out great...just not quite like brownies anymore. Next time I will try one egg and/or a little extra zucchini. All in all a great recipe & the icing is delicious!

Love these!  Definitely don't skip the frosting, it does make it fantastic! I followed the recipe to a T and mine still turned out cakey, but very moist and delicious.  I was amazed at how much the batter rose as it does come together very dry at first.  The taste of the cake reminds me of Hershey's perfectly chocolate chocolate cake recipe.

I was doubtful at first (especially after I added the dry ingredients).  But the zucchini moistens everything up.  The end product is super moist, don't need the frosting!!!

Delicious brownie recipe!!!  My only advice to those who are excited to be sneaking a vegetable into a dessert - like I was! - would be to make this while no one is watching and never tell them it's zucchini in there!  And trust the original recipe...no need to add eggs the zucchini give it plenty of moisture. My kids had no clue and enjoyed them like their normal store box brownies!

I followed the directions as written (using the large grater size for the zucchini). Even after adding the zucchini to the dry-looking sugar-flower mix, it was still crumbly and definitely not a batter.

After reading other reviews, I grated about 3/4 zucchini on the small grater size, added it in. It was a rather thick "batter-ish" consistency, but turned out yummy!

I found the result a perfect cross between a dense, more gooey brownie and cake. Perfect!

Made recipe as written except I did omit the nuts and I frosted the first batch. They practically flew out of the pan!  The second batch (made the next day) was just sprinkled with powdered sugar and taken to a bake sale. They were the first item to sell out. No question, this is a keeper, and not one person believed they were made with zucchini.

Hesitantly, I made these brownies per my daughter's request.  I assumed they'd be cake-y and I prefer fudge-y brownies.  Well, to my pleasant surprise, these were thick, rich, and very moist!  Sneaking in some zucchini made them an even better choice for desserts.  The zucchini wasn't noticeable to my younger daughter!  
The only change I made was to use Hershey's Special Dark baking cocoa.  I love dark chocolate and this added to the richness.  Maybe next time I will throw in a few dark chocolate chips or even some peanut butter ones.
EXCELLENT!!!  I will hang on to this recipe and make again!

my 3 year old who hates veggies ate the brownies. however, he is the only one who liked this. as far as zucchini brownies go, this is the best you are going to get. moist, fudgey and easy.
I had to use this recipe. so instead of the zucchini i added 2 cups of applesauce. (so now they are just very fudgey brownies). In the words of my husband, "Best brownies ever, don't take them to work unless you make me more". success!

Excellent! Here's a low cal version that will bring your cals per serving to 75-80 (depending on frosting):
Substitute apple sauce for oil
Substitute 3/4C agave syrup for granulated sugar
I substituted 1/2C of the flour with white bean flour. (Increased the cals but provided a complete protein)

If frosting is desired, just spindle some chocolate chips and spear when melted :)
Enjoy!!

I used a little more zucchini than the recipe called for to use up 2 zucchinis.  For the frosting, I eyeballed the amount of milk (and used canned condensed milk since it is what we had) and may have used a little more than called for, because the icing was very liquidy when I poured it onto the still warm brownies in the pan.   

Result..delicious. This tasted to me like a molten chocolate cake, and tastes just as good the next day.

These are GREAT!  More cake like than dense like a brownie.  And we skipped the frosting.  They don't need it (although it does look yummy in the picture!).  My 5 YO son was crying that I was making brownies with zucchini in them and said he would not eat them.  Guess who was asking for seconds!

I liked these brownies but think they would  be nicer with less sugar. I cant believe the zucchini was so well hidden. I will definately make these again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Really good and moist.  I tried making mini-cupcake brownies and found in between pans that the batter became more moist and easier to mix.  I think next time I will let the batter stand for a few minutes before mixing and putting it into the pan.  My 10 year old son liked these.

These turned out AMAZING..and I hate zucchini! You can't taste it amongst all the chocolaty goodness! Like others mentioned the batter seems really dry but after they are done they are the perfect moist brownie.

I thought these were yummy! My very picky son loved them. I did use applesauce instead of oil and left off the frosting because it wasn't necessary. Moist and delicious and with no nuts it's fat free.

The recipes produces a tasty chocolate cake.  I would not categories these as brownies as they lack density.  I did NOT add an agg nor any other liquid.  My batter was not exceptionally dry as others have indicated.  It is tasty with no indication of the zucchini besides a slight odor after a day or two.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the "brownies" were more like I opened a box of brownie mix, dumped it in a pan and baked it. They were SO DRY!! Will never make this again.

These were fantastic!  Skipped the frosting, so I can't comment there.  Made the brownies with 1/2 whole wheat flour, but otherwise according to the recipe (no egg).  Moist, rich, super-yummy.  Used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder, which is my favorite kind by far.  Will definitely make again!

**Edit** I just made these a second time, and they were even better! MAKE SURE you grate the zucchini using a small-hole grater, and fold it in thoroughly. My husband, who hates "healthy" stuff, can't stop eating them!**I followed the recipe exactly!! I don't know what everyone else's problem was that gave negative reviews-- these were delicious! They were SO SO moist, and I couldn't hardly taste the zucchini. When I opened the Pyrex I could smell a veggie-y smell, but they tasted fantastic. I was asked for the recipe multiple times, and I will make these over and over again!

I've been replacing butter/oil with applesauce in all my baking recipes and I think it's a nice improvement. The zucchini made them really moist and yummy! What a great thing to feed my middle school class.

I'm glad I read some reviews before I made these brownies, otherwise when it came to the dry batter I would have thought I'd gone wrong somewhere.  I only had 1/4 cup cocoa left, & both my neighbours were completely out of cocoa (the nerve!) so I tossed probably 1/2 cup of chocolate chips into the mix.   The brownies turned out delish!  I don't like anything too sweet & was scant on the white sugar, more like 11/4 cups, but the ch chips would have made up for it.  Next time, with all cocoa I'll adjust the sugar to a bit less. Good though & nice texture.  This recipe is a keeper.

I used zucchini I had frozen earlier in the year.  Thawed zucchini tends to have more liquid than freshly prepared zucchini, which was perfect for this recipe, because all of the moisture came from the zucchini!  SOOO good. I shred my zucchini very fine, and you can't even tell by the end result there was zucchini in the brownies!

I made this numerous times without my husband ever knowing it contained zucchini! The flavors will mellow in a day or two and it still stays moist. Great way to sneak in those veggies.

I chose this recipe because we are on a GF/CF diet and it did not require a lot of margarine or butter, which is expensive to substitute. They turned out more like Texas sheet cake and were absolutely decadent. I used a flour blend (sorghum flour/tapioca flour/potato starch) to substitute wheat flour. I didn't make any other changes to the recipe besides using Earth Balance in place of margarine and GF flour in place of wheat flour. I'm making them for a mothers' meeting tomorrow and I'm sure they will be a hit! Thanks so much!

These were good, my only suggestion is do not half the recipe unless you have a pan that is super small, which I did not.

These brownies are delicious!  I have made them many times.  They are great using a gluten free flour mix too!  I usually only use 1/2 the sugar.  I have also used coconut oil or olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and it is still wonderful!  Sometimes I add more zucchini as well.  Yum!

These brownies were deee-lish!  Like everyone else, I couldn't believe this crumbly batter would turn into moist brownies, but they did. Everyone LOVED them.  Only change I'll make next time is to use superfine sugar to eliminate the little bit of grittiness.

These were great - I did as some other reviewers suggested and substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour.  I also left out the walnuts.  Next time I think I will leave them unfrosted - my son actually liked them better that way!

Oh my goodness - this recipe was INCREDIBLE!  I suggest adding another 15 minutes to the baking time to ensure that you're not trying to cut batter squares.  My 4 year old really enjoyed helping me mix this together, and I was able to let him eat batter without worry, since there was no egg in the recipe!

Delicious.  Made as is except without walnuts (don't like them) and without frosting as I didn't have any butter.  They came out moist and I didn't even miss the frosting.  I agree with reviews that it looks too dry when mixing the ingredients until the zucchini is folded in and it didn't really poor into the pan so I was worried about it, but it came out great.  Instead of flouring the pan I used cocoa powder.

My kids and husband ate these up in a few days! It's nice to be able to serve a dessert knowing that it's at least semi-healthy! It is a little more "cakey" than brownie like, but still very good, nonetheless. We also added about 3/4C more of zucchini and it still turned out well.

I was a bit apprehensive about this recipe, but I tried it yesterday.  To my surprise, they came out fine.  I like to follow a recipe as written first and tweak it after the first try.  Next time I think I'll try 1 3/4 cups white sugar and 3/4 cup of coco powder.  They were not as sweet as my family would like and the chocolatey taste needs to increase.  Also, it might not be a bad idea to try baking in a smaller pan, because they spread really thin in the 9x13 pan.  Overall, their good, and worth a try; especially if your garden is over run with zucchini -- like my dad's.  Happy gardening!

Excellent recipe - I also used choc chips instead of walnuts.  Be patient with the batter - you do have to "work it" and it doesn't look too promising when you put it in the pan.  But it transforms into wonderful brownines when baked.  The icing is a little too sweet for me.  My zucchini haters loved this.

I followed the recipe as is.  The brownies turned out great...cant't see or taste the zucchini! Don't be alarmed if you think they are too thick as you are putting them in the pan... the zucchini softens and moistens them as they bake.  Be sure not to let them cook too long.... 22 minutes on 325 convection was all it took for mine.   The brownies get more moist as they sit for a few hours.  The result was a delicious, chewy, not too sweet treat.

Just made these last week and I have to say they are delicious.  In place of oil I used applesauce and I also used both whole wheat flour and all purpose flour and the result was fantastic.  I can't wait to share this with my grandchildren.  I made a double batch and froze them.  These brownies are more cake like, but extremely moist.  A few other people posted that there was a vegetable after taste, but I disagree.  When I first mixed the batter up and put it in the baking dish I thought it looked like I had too much zucchini in it.  After baking it I could still see some of the zucchini on top, but after icing it you can't see any of it.  If you have never cooked with zucchini before you really do need try this.

Fantastic brownies!!!  Like another person mentioned, don't be decieved by the dry textue of the mix before you add the zucchini.  It moistens it up perfectly!  They are soooooooooo good!!  This is a keeper for sure!  What I discovered is that if you let the mixture set a few minutes, it will become more moist and can spread easily in the pan. I was interupted after mixing mine and came back a few minutes lter to find it had  moistened up nicely!

EXCELLENT BROWNIES - DO NOT ADD EGGS - the mixture will appear to be very dry - but the zucchini will lose it's moisture into the batter when it's baking.  My kids LOVE these - they don't even care that there's zucchini in them!!

These are sooo good! I've made them twice and the 1st time, exactly as written. However, I agree with other reviewers that they had a bit of an 'after taste" so the second time I added 1/4 C more sugar in the batter. Perfect!! Thanks Marian!

These were amazing! Better than any box, that is for sure. Not too cakey, but not overly gooey either. I used 3/4 cup sugar and used 1/2 c apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil. I also used 2.5 c of the zucchini. They baked up perfectly, though I was worried based off of the appearance of the batter. Instead of frosting, I took the advice of a previous reviewer and sprinkled about a cup of milk chocolate chips over the warm brownies. Once they were shiney, I spread them around with a spatula to make the quickest frosting ever. My kids did not believe there was zucchini baked in!

These were so good and a great way to use all the extra zucchini!  I followed the recipe exactly and was a little hesitant since the recipe didn't call for eggs (I even double checked it thinking I missed them), but they came out delicious and so moist!  My husband took a couple in his lunch the next day and sent me a text that just said "these brownies you made are the best I have ever had in my life!"

EXCELLENT!!!!! My hubby didnt even KNOW there was zuchinni in these.  I let him have one, he rated it a 9.5 out of 10 (which is a very high rating for him) and AFTER I told him about the zuchinni, he was shocked! I was a bit confused on if I should squeeze and try and dry the zuchinni after I shredded it as I do with some other recipes.  I read a few reviews on here, that said not to, so I didnt.  RIGHT CHOICE!! They cooked up perfectly and were perfectly moist.  I did cook for about 35 mins though before I got the "bounce back" feeling. Will make again for sure! Thanks!

I thought this was more like a moist cake than a brownie, no eggs added, but still absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, I was out of nearly all the frosting ingredients, but the cake itself was still spectacular. You'd never know there was a zucchini in it!

Great recipe - followed exactly and they came out great!!!  You have to eat them sooner than later.  They do get a bit soggy upon sitting, as I've found happens with any type of baked good/vegetable recipe... not that eating them quickly is too much of a problem!!  :)

My kids loved them.  They kept saying, "there's no zucchini in these".   I made them without the frosting as I knew the kids would like the brownies even without it.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I thought they were just okay.  A little too gooey.  Overall they were good though.

We  have made this recipe several times over the past couple months.  The first time we included the frosting, but since then do not frost them.  They are moist, sweet and delicious.  Satisfying any sweet tooth.  They are so easy to whip up which is always a huge plus.

I feel so good about making these knowing there is a veggie in the brownie!  The batter was so dry I thought I did something wrong, but they came out incredibly moist.  I didn't mention there was zucc. in it to anyone and NO ONE noticed.  Someone mentioned that they added eggs, I would predict that they will turn cakey if you do and these are very fudgey without the eggs.  To frost, I throw on a handfull of chocolate chips right out of the oven, wait 5 min. until they turn glossy and then spread.  EASY and Delicious!  Thanks!

I didn't really like these straight out of the oven (found you could taste the zucchini) but after they sat in the fridge for a while they were incredible! I replaced half the oil with applesauce and left out the walnuts. I didn't use the frosting from the recipe, but I used another that I had leftover was similiar. I think some sort of frosting is necessary for these.

Followed recipe except decreased sugar to 1 cup...I don't like things too sweet.  Used extra zucchini because I had it.  These were a little cakey even though I didn't add any eggs...I gave them 4 stars because I like my brownies a little more fudgy.  May decrease the cooking time to 20 minutes next time around.

These are delicious! I halved the recipe; baked them in an 8X8 pan and they are nicely done in 17 minutes @ 350 degrees. Although I've already tasted one, I have not iced them yet, and I think I will because they could stand to be just a touch sweeter-the icing will accomplish that. Just as I read-these are frighteningly dry after adding the dry ingredients to the wet, but when you begin stirring in the zucchini the batter starts to look right. It's a great recipe! Thank you for sharing it Marian :)

After several loaves of zucchini bread and still quite a bit of zucchini to use up, I thought I'd give this one a try, but was a bit nervous about the idea of zucchini in brownies.  I cannot get over how AMAZING these brownies are! My kids cannot stop raving about them and we were so surprised that you can't taste the zucchini at all. Mine were slightly undercooked at 28 minutes, so the full 30 minutes or more would have been perfect.

I must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe as given, completely freaked out as I spread dry, powdery "batter" into the pan. Now it's more like the cookie base of a square and the texture is weird. I really wanted the to work, but won't invest the effort (even though it really wasn't much) to make them again. Sorry.

Unbelievable that zucchini is even in here... I had my doubts when I was mixing this up... It seemed too dry... but it was perfect when I added the zucchini. Yummy, Yummy, the frosting was perfect.... I always add the milk little by little when adding it to powdered sugar especially in frostings ... that way you don't let it get too thin. Thanks so much for the best zucchini brownie recipe ever!

These are really good.  I followed the recipe as written except I added 1/2 cup reeses peanut butter chips to mix instead of nuts.  They turned out moist and tasty.  The 'batter' is very dry before adding the zucchini, but does come together some after mixing in the zucchini.  You have to press it in the pan, but it came out great!   Had 4-5 people try them and no one could believe it had zucchini in it.

BRILLIANT!!!! We purchased this MEGA Zucchini at our local Farmer's Market and I've been exploring all the possibilities. I didn't read any of the reviews. Just found the recipe & photo appealing. Before adding the Zucchini, we did exactly what a few of the reviews said, found it extremely dry and started questioning. We figured there must be some science with the moisture from the Zucchini.  OMG, we didn't expect that! You should just suggest making two - once you wolf down the first, you have the second to enjoy for the coming days.

Flavor good but inconsistant texture.  Mostly fudgy but some gritty/crunchy.  Very difficult to mix.  Wasn't sure when thoroughly blended.  Better than I thought when smashing it down in the pan.  Don't think I'll be making again.

This recipe turned out absolutely delicious!  Very rich and chocolatey.  I followed the recipe exactly, and will make this again.  The brownie didn't turn out exactly like a traditional brownie- it wasn't chewy and had more of a cake like consistency.  The frosting tasted just like fudge.  The next time I make them I will not do frosting on them.  While it is delicious, it is quite rich!  I enjoy a lighter brownie.

I thought this was a great recipe. It's a wonderful way to use up zucchini. Plus, it's an easy recipe to follow. I didn't make the frosting as I don't like things that are overly sweet.  The batter starts out dry, but it should be mixed until the zucchini moistens the whole batter evenly.  I added a tsp of dry spearmint leaves when mixing the batter ingredients.  Then, the semi-solid batter should be pressed evenly into the baking pan.  It's very, very tasty when done.

This is not a chewy brownie as the name implies.  It tastes like the chocolate chip zucchini cake that my mom makes.  I didn't top it off with frosting.  Instead, I topped it the way that my mom does.  I didn't have the chocolate chips, but still stopped it off with pecans, cinnamon and sugar before baking.

I tried these a couple of times (I have a TON of zucchini this year) and I followed the recipe exactly, the only difference I tried was how I grated the zucchini.  When I used the larger grate size, they tasted good, but were somewhat dry, when I grated the zucchini very fine- it made a HUGE difference in the moisture... whole family loves them with or w/out frosting!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was a GREAT recipe. It came out very moist. Not too sweet, so next time I'll add chocolate chips to the mix or possibly more sugar. I definitely think it needed the icing to add sweetness to the recipe as is. Definitely a repeat.

These are probably the best zucchini brownies that I have had. They are a bit tricky to make though. Once when I made them they never set up, so I have figured out that it really depends on the moisture in your zucchini. Watch that the batter is still sort of dry when you put it in the pan. Today when I made them, i actually only used 1 1/2 cups because it was getting too moist again. I do mince mine in a Tupperware chopper so there are not any chunks at all, and that might bring out the juices. Overall--A+!! My picky 8 year old ate almost the whole batch last time. Thanks Marian!

These brownies were pretty much terrible.  Just made a batch 30 minutes ago, and suspected they would be a disappointment when they went in the oven, and I was right.  The texture of the "batter" is all wrong--it's not even really batter; it's too dry and crumbly to be called that.  The flavor isn't bad (though not that good), but the texture is downright off-putting, and the appearance is pretty bad.  I didn't bother with the frosting, since I don't care for brownies with frosting.  I will not be making these again.  Too bad--I generally like zucchini dessert recipes.

This did not turn out like I had wanted at all.  I would say this was more of a cake than a brownie.  I wasn't able to shred the zucchini as finely as I would have liked and it resulted in chunks.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil and brown sugar for the white and left out the walnuts.  Glad I tried it because I would have loved for it to work out, but will not be making again.

All I can say is I can't wait till my zucchini's are ready in the garden!!!!  My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe--and surprised a lot of people who couldn't believe there was zucchini in these tasty little treats!  I did not even use the frosting....they were eaten before I had to time to frost them!  ha!  Thanks Marian!

I followed the recipe exactly and must say that an electric mixer should be used to incorporate the zucchini, then fold in the nuts.   Other than this change the recipe ROCKS!  Thanks!

I made these last night. They turned out very well. I used 1/2 cup applesauce to cut down on fat, like one of the other reviewers but in place of all purpose flour, I used 2 cups whole wheat PASTRY flour (makes a difference, it HAS TO BE PASTRY FLOUR if you are going to use whole wheat otherwise, it will be grainy). Next time I'll cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup but make it PACKED brown sugar.  I also added 1/2 cup of MINI semi-sweet chocolate chips which is why you need to cut the sugar down.  Before baking, I sprinkled more walnuts on top for a pretty look and didn't bother with the added calories of icing the brownies. This is my new favorite recipe!!!!

I made the recipe exactly as described.  The brownies have a good chocolate flavor but there is a slight taste of a different ingredient than with  typical brownies.  My brownies had a cake like texture not fudgy (no, I did not add an egg).  The frosting was simple.  I think this is a really good recipe especially if you need to use up those zukes when they are in peak season.  I am interested in how they flavor overnight.... I expect them to obtain a little richer intense chocolate flavor.  Thanks for a good recipe.

These were pretty good especially on day 2. Around day four they started to lose their shape when handled. A great way to use up your zucchini just make sure you drain the shredded zucchini.

I followed this recipe exactly, and I could not be more pleased!  These are moist and delicious, and if you chop the zucchini really well... you can't even tell it's in there!  Wonderful way to get kids to eat an extra serving of veggies!  And I have to say... I do think the icing is a must!  It's Delicious!!!

wonderful!  my curiosity led me to give these brownies a try and i am so glad i did.  i didn't make the frosting and they were delicious without it.  next time i will try to add more flavor by adding a shot of Kahlua.  they did come out a tad cakey but i don't mind that.  i doubled the walnuts and shredded the zucchini very fine.

Not sure I'll make brownies any other way ever again. The only negative here is a bit salty result. Next time I'll cut down on the salt a bit.

I can finally stop searching for the best brownie recipe! These brownies are really as good as everyone says. Moist and chewy with a rich cocoa taste, and not too sweet. No need for eggs, they were not left out by mistake. I love that I can use zucchini in the process, which makes this not just the tastiest but the healthiest brownies ever. No way I'm putting frosting on these yummy squares!

These brownies were absolutely fantastic!  There were plenty rich on their own, so I didn't feel the need to frost them - I definitely recommend these to anyone!

i would like to give these 5 stars, but i think the recipe needs a little tinkering. this was my first time making them, so i'll update as i make changes. *** these really improved after sitting overnight. the first day they were crispy/chewy around the edges, but otherwise sort of crumbly. the next day, after being covered with aluminum foil overnight, they were uniformly moist and fudgy/chewy, and stayed that way for two days (it's possible that they could have retained that texture longer, but they were all gone by then!)

This was really nice and good use of zucchini to boot. I only used 1 cup of sugar but that is personal choice and using apple sauce instead of oil, and changed nothing on the frosting which in itself is worth 10 stars! I have a friend who cannot tolerate eggs and this I can make for her without her having any reactions..

These were great!  Looked very dry going into the baking pan but turned out fantastic.  I made some changes to the frosting.  For the frosting I used butter, 1/2 the cocoa and added in peanut butter, a little instant coffee.  Yum!

these are awesome...just the best use for zucchini i've found so far!  the only changes i've made is using applesauce in place of the oil, or just for 1/2 of the oil.  one thing i woudn't recommend is using zucchini that's been frozen - it will not turn out the same:(  also, some have mentioned adding an egg or not, i tried both with & without and found little difference, so i make them without.  these are also good with chocolate chips added to the batter.

I changed the 1/2 cup oil to 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce to make it healthier.  I didn't add walnuts because I didn't have any and added some peanut butter chips.  In the last 3-5 minutes i sprinkled some chocolate chips on top and spread it with a spatula instead of the frosting.  The batter itself wasn't very sweet, with the topping it was just right.  Received great review from colleagues and friends, especially those who are not a fan of overly sweet treats. Very moist, nobody could tell that it was zucchini!

Gotta say, I'm not very impressed. These don't look pretty, which is probably why the frosting recipe is included. The taste and texture are pretty good, except that you can taste the gritty sugar in each bite. Maybe my zucchini was too dry. I might make these again since they are so healthy, but I think I would add more liquid of some kind. As other reviewers mentioned, the texture of the 'batter' is VERY dry.

This recipe is delicious and amazing!  I have made it twice now... and both times I followed the recipe exactly. One way to ensure a delicious result is not in the ingredients... its all about how you shred your zucchini!!  The first time I made this, I used a food processor and used the shredding blade... the zucchini turned out bigger, and the brownie mix was much more dry.  BUT.... the next time I made it.... I used a medium handheld cheese grater, got much more finely shredded zucchini, and the most incredible brownies I have ever had in my life!  So, the more finely grated you can get it, the better!!  So good!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

This recipe was very disappointing.  I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with a crumbly mess that I could barely get out of the pan.  The taste was really yummy, which is the only reason I gave it two stars, although there is a distinct "veggie" aftertaste, which is sort of weird.  I won't be using this recipe again.  Also, the frosting recipe along with the brownie recipe is awful.  It's runny and grainy and not at all like frosting.  Terrible.

Very good! So rich and dense that no one will know the have zucchini in them unless you tell them. I did peel my zucchini so it was not seen by my kids. A great use for the giant zucchini's from the garden.

The brownies were easy to make and turned out okay but I think it was my problem rather than the recipes problem (was doing too many things at one time and made the brownies very distractedly).  The family liked them and I found they were quite moist.  We ate them warm with some ice cream - yum!

This is the best brownie recipe ever! I wouldn't believe there was zucchini in it had I not put it in myself. It was fudgey and moist and full of flavour. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. FOLLOW THE RECIPE TO THE "T" and you will be amazed!!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My boss baked this heavenly divine brownie & I felt like I was dying slowly in bliss. It was so moist-totally melted in my mouth. At first I was sceptical-zucchini & all, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. This is a must have recipe & I'm happy it was passed on to me.

OOOH My! These are sooo good. Impressed everyone at my dinner party. The batter is very very dry, I had to use my hands to pat it into the pan, but they came out moist and chewy. I skipped the frosting and whipped up some heavy cream for the top. You have to try this recipe dont let the zucchini scare you away!!

Wow. Loved these brownies.  I was sure that I had done something wrong because the batter was almost a sandy consistency, but once they were baked they were perfect.  No one even noticed there was zucchini in them.  I will be using the frosting recipe in other recipes.

These were just ok. Strange texture from the zucchini. I will say that the zucchini made the brownies really moist, which was nice. Don't think I will make again.

Yum!  Probably the best brownie recipe I've ever made.  They were fudgy without being cakey.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and baked in a 8x8 square pan to double the thickness.  I used can frosting because it was easier for me.  Very delicious!  Everyone in the family loved them.

A-MAZ-ING!!! Although, lol, I did add a couple tbsp of milk to the end batter as it was really really dry, I could hardly mix it. Anyways, it turned out great, and bravo to the icing! Tasts just like the jar kind! Definatley a keeper!

I was reluctant to put this crumbly batter into the pan so mixed in one egg.  The brownies were almost cake-like, moist and delicious, and everyone loved them.

I loved this recipe.  I was surprised that the batter really wasn't a batter, but more like crumbs.  The water from the zucchini brought it all together when it baked and it was delicious.  I didn't use the frosting, but sprinkled on some chocolate chips when it came out of the oven like another reviewer said.  I don't think it even needed that, but it was very delicious.  I will definitely be making this again. Maybe I'll try to reduce the sugar a little next time, just for health reasons.

I have made these several times this fall they are so good... and an excellent way to use zucchini. Nothing needs to be changed although I don't add the nuts because of allergies. I peel and remove the seeds before shredding. I find the batter comes together much better when stirring the zucchini directly in the sugar mixture, then adding the flour mixture. The zucchini melts the sugar and gives a wet base for the dry ingredients. My baking time is usually 35 min. The icing is also really good. This is definitely a keeper.

These are really great brownies/cake but you have to watch the moisture content of your zucchini.  The first time I made them I used freshly grated zucchini--they turned out fantastic and fooled the whole family!  I made them again one week later with zucchini I had grated the week before and had stored in ziploc bags in the fridge.  It must have dried out just enough that I ended up with a pan of dry crumbs, not moist brownies.  One more try with the week-old zuc plus a little applesauce and they turned out great.

I added more zucchini (just grated a whole one, seeds, skin and all!) and less sugar (just a little over a cup) and it still turned out FANTASTIC!!!!!  You can't see the zucchini in it at all!  To me, it seems like the more zucchini is added, the more 'cake-y' it turns out (rather than thick like a brownie), probably from all the water in the zucchini but it totally doesn't matter because it is DELICIOUS either way!  And definitely use the frosting with this!  It makes the brownies/cake!!

Absolutely the best brownies I've ever made.  They are chewy, moist and chocolaty.  I had my doubts at first when I made the batter, because it's not really a batter, but a dry bunch of ingredients in the bottom of my bowl.  After it was baked and frosted, they were delicious.  Don't change the recipe one bit!!

Made exactly as directed and giving this one 5 stars! Moist, delicious, chocolatey. In fact, we didn't bother with the icing. Note: Don't be fooled by the dry "batter" at the beginning - as others have noted, this turns out just fine without any tinkering. Thanks, Marian!

OMG Marian,  You have hit the nail right smack on the head with this recipe.  They are everything they are espoused to be and more.  I have passed this recipe on to everyone I know who gardens, and therefore, has more zucchini than they know what to do with.  I am sure they will all be freezing zucchini for winter brownies.  Who knew zucchini could be so delicious!  I did add 1 cup chocolate chips to the recipe, but just because I am a chocolate nut.  But without is perfect too.  All hail to the great zucchini.  If this recipe gets out there will be a run on zucchini in the stores!

These "brownies" are good, though I would described it more like thin cake and not really that chocolatey or gooey.  Very easy to make and the batter wasn't too stiff or dry to work with.  If I ever make them again, I'll add some espresso powder to the batter or a bit of almond extract to the frosting as they seemed to need "something".  However, I prefer other recipes for using up zucchini and I'll stick with my own recipe for brownies.

At first I was sure I had done something wrong as the batter was more like cookie dough.  Had to pat the batter into the cake pan.  Untill they were cooled and frosted I worried and wondered but WOW the first taste told everybody this was a keeper recipe.

I made these this pass weekend...only changes was I substituted applesauce for the oil and I didn't not frost them.  People loved them...they were so moist...really didn't need the frosting...I did dust them with confectioner sugar.  This recipe is a keeper.

I had a HUGE zucchini given to me so decided to try these brownies...they were decadent, moist, very dense and chocolatey. Did not change anything except to add another large handful of shredded zucchini and omit the nuts for my hubby. Did not frost them, as everyone was eating them before they could cool enough to frost!

We loved these! I did however use unsweetened applesauce rather than oil. I also pureed the zucchini rather than grating it so there wouldn't be chunks of zucchini. Even my 3 year old vegetable hater ate them gladly!

This didn't work at all.  Every review said that the dry batter would become moist when I added zucchini.  This did NOT happen.  I used frozen (thawed) zucchini which may have had a little to do with it, but we're talking REALLY dry.  I had to add eggs, butter and milk just to save this!

I was so intrigued by this recipe I just had to try it.  While you really cannot tell there is zucchini in them, there is something a little different about the taste that makes them not quite like a typical brownie.  They are however pretty darn good.  All my kids are eating them but I don't think they will go as fast as a pan of traditional brownies.  And, yes, a lot of moisture is released into the very dry mixture once the zucchini is mixed in and even more as it bakes.  Interesting recipe!

Oh Yeah!  Trust this recipe exactly as written.  It seems dry, but the zucchini does the job and makes these brownies moist and delicious. You can't see, feel or taste the zucchini - what a great way to sneek in a little vitamin C and fiber! Frosting is also delicious, and has a dark chocolate flavor - not too sweet. I've never served these and not had several requests for the recipe!

These are ooey, gooey, and delicious! I wasn't sure how they would turn out at first because the batter was really dry and I was surprised that you didn't need to add an egg, but the zucchini really moistened up the batter while it was cooking. The brownies themselves aren't really that sweet, but the frosting makes up for it. Very delicious and no one will even know there's zucchini in them!

These were fine, but I'm not sure what the fuss is about. I thought the texture turned out a bit chewy, but not in a good gooey sort of brownie way. Tastes fine, but not amazing. I'll keep looking for a good zucchini brownie recipe.

We could not stop eating these brownies!  They were moist, tasty - by far the best we have ever eaten!  My daughter made these and it was easy to follow and she had fun making these while I made the zucchini patties.  Definitely will make these again!

I tried this recipe, and I thought the same thing as most of you that the batter was way too dry, so I decided to add 1 cup of applesauce in addition to the 1 cup of oil previous. What a difference it made!! My batter was just like a brownie recipe. I also made the frosting and what a "Winner Combination" they turned out to be. My friends who are not crazy about zucchini, absolutely loved it, she had 2 pieces. I also peeled my zuchinni beforehand. I will make this recipe over and over again. Thanks for sharing!!

We love this recipe.  Instead of oil we substituted applesauce and it was great.  Makes more of a cake like texture but the kids ate it up, even without the frosting.  This is a favorite of the kids and will make it again and again and again.

Very, very good...I almost gave this recipe 5 stars.  They are quite tasty, but next time I'd add 1 egg.  The batter was super dry and hard to mix/spread.  As a result, I needed to wait about 3 to 5 minutes after adding the zucchini to let the sugar draw the juices out.  Did not make with frosting since we're trying to cut down on the extra sugar and fat...we didn't miss it at all, though I'm sure it's very good.  A nice way to use up that extra zucchini from the garden...will definitely make again!

With all the great reviews I thought these would be wonderful!  After combining the wet ingredients I couldn't imagine how that would soak up all the flour.  I ended up with a very pasty dough like others but after they were baked, they were grainy because the sugar didn't dissolve.  This was the first recipe I have made from Allrecipes that I had to throw away!

I was surprised how good these brownies turned out....like alot of others, the batter looked a little scary! But they turned out really good! The icing came out a little thin for me, but it did set up after setting. Will make again soon!

I wish I could give more than 5 stars! EXCELLENT recipe as is - I went for less fat by substituting the oil with applesauce, added some ground flax seed for health, and doubled the zucchini. I will never again cringe when a friend unloads extra zucchini on me!!

I made these zucchini brownies for a family reunion (along with the zucchini cobbler recipe-yum), and they turned out great!  I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and the brownies rose up and were much softer than normal brownies (cake-like).  I also made the frosting, which I don't normally make for brownies, and this frosting is great for these brownies.  Yum! Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly except I added chocolate chips instead of nuts. VERY tastey and my husband said "Best homemade brownies ever". They are more cake-y than fudge-y but still delicious. I just don't know how you are supposed to get them in a 9x13 pan. I baked mine in a 8" round and they weren't even that thick - and barely had any frosting left over.

I have never made brownies like these before, so I was skeptical while I was making the . . . well, it wasn't the consistency of normal batter. It was crumbly, and I had to work the dry ingredients into the wet with the back of a wooden spoon. It took some doing, but I knew I had to just follow the recipe, so I did exactly as it said (I didn't add any eggs). After putting the zucchini in, I pressed the batter into the pan with my hands, and my hands quickly became moist - the zucchini was doing its job! Mine took 30 minutes to bake, and they taste delicious! I went without the frosting; the brownies don't need it. I did substitute chocolate chips for the walnuts. I'd make these again. I love recipes that include lots of zucchini but don't taste like they do.

Not lowfat or low cal, but definitely a way to add nutritional zucchini to a dessert. Delicious and you can't see the zucchini is in there, at all. Flavor is great and it baked up even,(no overbaked edges to get the center done) tall, moist and somewhat chewy: heavier than a dense cake. Great recipe that I will make again and again. Thanks Marian, for a delicious and *surprisingly* good brownie recipe!

Excellent! My family loves these brownies. I followed the recipe exactly. I did add about a cup of chocolate chips. And when flouring the pan, instead of using flour I used cocoa powder. Very moist. We don't need the frosting on them. My husband says "they are the best brownies he has had!" That is a great review in itself. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

WOW... We have a ton of zucchini growing in our garden right now, so I've been searching for recipes to use it up.  I thought I'd give this one a try, since I love chocolate, but was amazed at how good they came out.  To be honest though, I wouldn't really call them a brownie... more like a really fudgy, moist cake.  Don't get me wrong, they are chocolately and dense, but more like a cake.  For those of you who are familiar with Whacky Cake, it's a very similar taste/texture.   The best part is my two sons (6 and 11) had no idea they were eating zucchini.  When I first mixed it up, I thought they'd be able to see it in the cake, but once it was done baking and the frosting was on it... you couldn't tell... it literally dissolved into the batter.  It was even funnier when they still didn't believe me even after I told them... Gotta love it!

Delicious!  My grandkids couldn't get enough of them.  The frosting was kind of thin, so I kept them in the frig.  We all preferred them cold anyway.  No need to tell anyone there's zucchini in them!

I can't seem to be able to bake enough of these as they have become my grandkids favorite brownie.  I changed the frosting a little using sweet butter instead of margarine and used half milk and half whipping cream.  Very rich, sweet and chocolatey

This was AWESOME!!!  I did not change a thing except for 5 more minutes. When you mix it, it's dry but don't be deceived, the zucchini does moisten it. This was Excellent!!! Thank You!

Followed this recipe to a "T" (ok, MAYBE added a dash more cocoa) and the brownies were fantastic!!  I actually just bought more zucchini to keep on hand to make more in the future!  Like other reviewers mentioned, a bit more like a rich devil's food cake -- but incredible nonetheless.  My neighbors, co-workers and friends inhaled them, and couldn't guess the "secret ingredient".  This one's a keeper for sure!

Yea!! A new way to use zucchini.  And it is easy to make.  I foolowed the recipe but thought it was a bit to dry even after i added the zucchini, but that was a bit of a mistake.  Then they were over moist.  The second time I made them exactly the way directed and they were perfect.  thnak for this great idea! I will make these all the time.

Ok, so I made the browinies before reading the reviews.  I thought the recipe was missing something as it was powdery dry before the zucchini was added. So I went back to the computer and re-read the recipe, then the reviews.  No longer quite so worried, I proceded and have just taken a batch of beautiful looking brownies out of the oven.  Great recipe...a keeper.  PS:  I also cut the sugar to 1 cup.

Wow! Made this just as instructed except added an egg to the oil and sugar. This recipe is excellent! The delicious, rich frosting covers up any veggie tasted though it doesn't really taste like a veggie at all! My son, the pickiest eater in the world wanted more! Mine came out as a 1 1/2 inch cake instead of a brownie, but who cares? The chocolate flavor is awesome!!

Made these for the office and they were a hit. Followed the recipe to a "T". I used my KitchenAid to mix it all together. When I added the zucchini last, the consistency became completely moist and easy to spread in the pan. Next time, I may substitute 1/4 cup of applesauce for 1/4 cup oil. Delicious!

Seriously wonderful recipe...I spent a lot of time sifting through brownie recipes to find one to veganize - and this one already was! Changes made: I added some chocolate chunks instead of walnuts (I'm allergic) and left off the frosting. It looked so bizarre before pressing it into the pan, more like chunky dough than a batter. Trust the recipe though and you'll end up with a beautiful and delicious pan of brownies! You'll never know that the eggs/dairy are "missing" and probably wouldn't guess that zucchini sneaked in there to replace them. I also noticed they were even more delicious after about 2 days on the kitchen counter - If they last that long :)

These turned out really good. However, I did alter the recipe (as I almost always do). I subbed half the sugar for splenda and I added an egg. I also pureed the zucchini and you can't even tell it's in there. These changes caused it to be cake rather than brownies, oh well. Still really good.

More cakelike than brownie consistency despite the fact that there are NO eggs in it.  If skipping the frosting like I did, consider adding an extra 1/2 c. of white or brown sugar or chocolate chips, or substitute applesauce for the oil.... unless you like your brownies lightly sweetened.

Wow!  These are fabulous.   I made exactly as written, but I doubled the recipe and threw about a 1/4 bag of dark chocolate chips over the top before baking.  I also only used one recipe of the frosting and split it over the two pans, which was plenty.  I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa in both.  I think the key to mixing is to use a hand mixer to combine the ingredients well.  These did turn out moist and cakelike, but really the argument is unnecessary - they are wonderful no matter the consistency.

Bizarre.  Perhaps I need to mix the batter better or really smash the batter into the pan.  The end result was rather crumbly on top.

This was a strange consistency.  I thought they could have used a little more chocolate flavor.  Next time I will add some chocolate chips to the batter.

Great brownies.  Good thing I read some reviews before making.  The "batter" was very dry - almost crumb like.  I double and triple checked to make sure I didn't leave out any liquid ingredient.  After mixing in zucchini I let it sit a minute or so.  I used my hand to press into a pan.  They aren't bad without icing, but much better with.  My friends all thought they were good too.

wonderful way to use up zucchini! I put it in an 8 x 8 square pan instead. I used splenda instead of the sugar in the brownies and whole wheat flour. I did the frosting as per the recipe! Wonderful!

This recipe is super yummy!  I did make some healthy alterations to it, and it made it worse...I felt it was so "healthy" that I couldn't stop eating them!  I did half whole wheat flour/half white, I substituted half of the oil for applesauce, and added 1/2 cup carrot puree.  And of course, I put in a handful of chocolate chips in the batter.  Even my husband, who is not a dessert fan, helped me polish this off in 2 days! The frosting is the best!

Awesome just like everyone says. I see it's been on here for years but i just tried it. so rich, cakier than typical box brownies but so moist and rich it doesn't matter. I almost didn't do it because of the word "cake" in some reviews but so glad I did. They were even a hit with the mother-in-law that said 'yuk' when i told her i was making them. HA!

I have to admit, I hesitated in making this recipe but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer!  Not your typical batter but the zucchini definitely added the moisture and made the finished product moist, delicious and the brownies were extemely chocolatey.  I also like the idea of being low fat and so tasty too.  Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe.

I thought the frosting was great but I only used about 2 Tbsp of milk (1/4 cup would have made it way too runny).  I will definitely use the frosting on other things in the future!

This recipe is so easy, and  it made some of the best brownies I've ever had.  I skipped the walnuts, and only had 1 1/4 cup zucchini, so for the other 3/4 cup, I used shredded apple.  Also, I realized halfway through that I didn't have baking soda.  I used baking powder (which I woulnd't normally attempt, but) Amazingly, after all that THEY TURNED OUT GREAT!!!!  Super moist and not at all cakey (probably partially due to me no baking soda)

These are wondeful. I used applesauce instead of oil as per other reviewers' suggestion. I had accidentally picked up "sweetened" applesauce so I cut back the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups and used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. I added half a cup of chocolate chips to the batter, and made the frosting exactly as directed. These were fantastic and I feel great knowing they're not doing quite the amount of damage as full fat, zucchini-free ones. As a chocoholic, I LOVE this frosting, I'll remember it for other recipes as well.

These are good. My little girl couldn't believe they had zucchini in them. I replaced the walnuts with crunchy banana chips and dark chocolate pieces.

Admittedly I probably botched this recipe.  I cut the sugar in half thinking it would be fine since I used sweetened applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil.  I also didn't make the frosting since we normally don't frost brownies.  They ended up with a distinct veggie taste...which we didn't mind, but they could have been way better if the flavor was more subdued or nonexistent.  Since this is a nutritious brownie recipe and a good use for extra zucchini from the garden I will try making these again; but I will definitely add the full amount of sugar and frost the brownies thickly.

Good recipe! Very moist, but it falls apart easily. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. You definitely need a glass of milk with this one! :)
UPDATE
I didn't use any nuts, but followed the recipe  exactly otherwise. It didn't fall apart this time, perhaps not adding nuts helped?? Everyone LOVES these! 5 stars! :)

Fantastic!  I made a couple of changes, this recipe is almost like my Texas Sheet cake recipe.  I added 2 eggs and added 1/2 cup more sugar.  I frosted them with my own frosting of 1/4 butter, 3 TBS cocoa and milk.  Added powdered sugar until it was a good consistancy.  There is a 'slight' aftertaste of zucchini but it isn't noticable if you are not looking for it.  I will make these again as they are very good.

These are actually quite tasty.  To clarify on the dryness of the "batter," I literally had POWDER before I added the zucchini and started to stir it in.  Then the zucchini began to release its moisture and "batter" began to form.  I really had wondered before that if these were going to work at all.  There is a slightly different taste to these from regular brownies, but it's not a bad taste and you would never know they have zucchini in them.  I told my family AFTER they had eaten a serving and they were shocked to find out they'd just eaten zucchini!  I recommend including the frosting, as I think it helps keep the zucchini incognito and enhances the flavor and quality of these brownies.  I sprinkled coconut on top of the frosting.  Will make again--I always appreciate a tasty way to use up some of our pesky zucchinis!

I  have made these brownies several times now and every time they have turned out fabulous!  The first time I made this recipe, the batter was very crumbly.  I pressed the dry flour/zucchini mixture into the pan -- baked up okay but there was some flour-y bits on top because it really wasn't moist enough.  The second time I made the recipe, it turned out more gooey and stuck together well.  Not sure what the difference was -- maybe the zucchini was a bit more moist or left longer on the counter before baking the second time around.  Didn't matter because they were still tasty.  Great with frosting.  Will definitely make again -- the zucchini is very subtle and your little ones (and big ones!) will never tell!

I made this as written except substituted yellow summer squash for the zucchini as that's what I had on hand. These are great! My 6 year old son saw me grating the squash and asked what I was making. I told him it was a surprise. He said, "Is it going to taste like squash because I don't like squash..." I replied, "No, it won't taste like squash. You'll love it." Sure enough, my 4 and 6 year old boys both gobbled them up with a glass of milk. Next time I will do zucchini. UPDATE: Made with zucchini exactly as written. DEELISH! Don't change a thing, even if it seems counterintuitive not to add eggs or to have such a dry batter. Please do not squeeze out your zucchini! That's the liquid that makes this recipe work. Enjoy!

I like to make a recipe as given first.  This recipe was AWESOME.  didn't need an egg! I worried it was going to be too dry but it was melt in your mouth.  My neighbors agreed and are already asking for more.  Kids couldn't find zuchini in here if they tried.  OHHHHH that frosting.  ACES

Great recipe! I followed it exactly, but I added about a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Next time I will try applesauce instead of the oil so I don't feel so guilty eating so many! I've found that these are better the second day.  I used a food processor to chop the zucchini to almost a pulp. It worked very well for this recipe.

Excellent- easy to make, moist and sneaky!  BUT, not chocolatey enough for my taste.  I will definitely make these again (we have a LOT of zucchini in the garden) but will add chocolate chips or possibly grated chocolate next time.

Made these exactly as stated, but did not use the icing.  This was very very good.  Great flavor!  My entire family loved it.  This is going to be a great way to use extra zucchini's from the garden.

Don't drain the zucchini.  This recipe is AMAZING.  I subbed part dark chocolate powder for the brownies and icing and added a bit of almond flavoring to the icing.  Yum!

Fantastic! I left out the nuts and sprinkled mini choc chips on the top.  This may be the best choc cake I've ever had, not brownie texture.  I took this to a party the other day and no one knew it had zucchini in it.  They were amazed!

OMG!!!  I basically followed the recipe as written, and they turned out outrageous.  The only changes I made was omitting the nuts and subbing chocolate chips, and skipping the icing.  Like others, I was afraid something was wrong, the batter seemed very dry, but the zucchini has enough moisture to do the job.  I made the brownies yesterday afternoon, and less then 24 hours later, the pan is over half empty.  This recipe will definitely find a home in my recipe box!!!!!

I was sorely disappointed. I was expecting something moist and tasty, but these were dry, crumbly, and had a poor taste.  Will not make these again.

WOW. Oh man, these are amazing. I followed the recipe and used a bunch of the tips from previous reviewers -- I cut the oil in half and did half applesauce. I only used 1/2 tsp. of salt. I did NOT squeeze out the zucchini -- of course your brownies will be dry and crumbly if you squeeze out the only moisture that's supposed to go into them!! I also swapped out the walnuts for 1/2 cup of chopped dark chocolate - yum. As for the frosting, I read that other people were finding it quite thin, so I added the milk only until I got the consistency I wanted. I had a couple tbsp left over, so I would definitely recommend adding milk gradually, not all at once. Anyways, with those changes, and thanks to a truly fantastic recipe, I now have a half eaten pan of absolutely fantastic (and somewhat healthy) brownies!! Thanks Marian!

I added an egg and doubled the cocoa powder, which improved the taste a little.. something was lacking, though.  The texture was phenomenal.  But mixing the batter was WAY too much work... it was extremely dry and hard to mix all the way.

Pretty good. My brother and sister thought these were the best brownies I had ever made. My mother and I on the other hand thought that these were just okay. My brother doesn't like nuts so I just left those out. Also, because of other reviewers suggestions, I added about a half a cup of chocolate chips because my philosphy is, the more the better. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with these. I found the chips really unnecessary and my sister just didn't like them. I ended up making about half the frosting which turned out a bit runny so I just drizzled it on top of the brownies in pretty little swurls. Again, I didn't find the frosting all too neccessary either. I'm not a health nut or anything but why waste the calories if it doesnt add anything to it? Not sure if it was my oven but I baked it like an extra 10 mins. All in all, not bad.

This was awesome! I was trying to find a good zucchini brownie recipe since I tried a different one over a year ago with terrible luck. I crossed my fingers and tried this one. I was iffy about it because it doesn't call for any egg, but I went ahead with it any way based on the strong reviews. I used frozen shredded zucchini, but I had to do a little experimenting with my zucchini. I used two quart size bags. I had originally put approx. 2 1/2 cups of fresh zucchini in each bags giving a whopping total of 5 cups for this recipe! However, what I did do is this: I drained one bag really good by squeezing it a bit (discarding the liquid)and added it to a blender. Then I drained the second bag into a measuring cup and added the remaining zuccini contents into the blender and added enough of the zucchini liquid to allow the mixture to blend easily. It ended up totaling 3 cups of blended zucchini of which I added to the wet ingredients before adding the dry ingredients. This turned out perfectly! The frosting with the brownie base is a match made in heaven and is even more heavenly on the second day! I didn't care for the frosting by itself and the brownie by itself was rather bland, but the combination makes this recipe a true winner!!! Try it, you will like it!

These were delicious. I got a little stir crazy and did not seperate the ingredients prior to stirring, which caused pockets of flour throughout the brownies. The only downfall about these is that if you are craving a super rich brownie (aka, loads of butter), you may be disappointed. I think this is a good brownie recipe if you like to have a treat around the house, but if you are looking for something when you have a craving these may not fit the bill.

WOW!! I made exactly as posted (except half the flour was whole wheat), and though the batter was dry, like some people had commented, the brownies came out moist and dense and chocolatey... unfortunately, my husband caught me pulling them out of the oven and saw the slightly fibrous texture and got weirded out. Once the brownies cooled down, the strands of zucchini (I shredded them on the very thinnest holes of my grater) dissolved into the brownies, and the texture was not stringy or strange at all! With frosting, my husband was willing to try and liked them very much. Will DEFINITELY make again!

Very good! Don't be fooled, the mixture is really dry when you put it into the pan, but it will become really moist and delicious. Can't even tell there is vegetables in it!

I have tried better zucchini brownies.  I just made these and was disappointed with the results.  They had quite a bitter after taste even though I did not forget anything and mixed everything quite well.

These are really good. Mine did turn out cakey, but I like my brownies that way.  Not sure why some get denser ones, maybe it is the flour or baking soda??  The frosting is so good too.  Nice, easy, healthy brownies what more could you ask for?

This is AMAZING! This recipe has turned my husband to the dark side! He has always been a lover of white cake...after making this recipe he is a chocoholic. I've found that if you fine shred the zucchini, you get the BEST EVER chocolate cake...and my favorite variety so far is to use dark chocolate! YUM!

These are terrific brownies!  I omitted the walnuts and didn't bother with the frosting, but the family still loved them!  My younger son is allergic to both eggs and tree nuts/peanuts, so this was a wonderful recipe to make that was safe to share.  My older son asked for seconds and thirds, so this recipe is definitely a keeper, as hard to make baked goods without eggs and still please everyone.  Thanks for sharing!

As far as a zucchini brownie goes, this was great. did not use icing, but maybe I should try that next time. The brownie itself could have been a bit sweeter.

I loved these brownies! I took them to a family dinner where some people poured on a black raspberry syrup that I had made.  My family devoured these like there was no tomorrow.  I came home with an empty pan!  Even my niece who will NOT eat zucchini had thirds!

I took this to a family gathering, and none of them knew it had zucchini in it. They are really good zucchini brownies, but compared to some regular brownies I've had, the were just okay. Next time I will make a richer frosting- the one with the recipe seemed too sweet.

Fantastic chocolate flavor; didn't really notice zucchini. Because they were so moist, they got mushy when stored in a plastic bag.

This is a "fun" recipe--everytime I serve these, it is so entertaining to see people try and figure out what is in them!  They are really good and moist!  I like making them for people here in Serbia because noone has ever heard of using zucchini in such a different way!

These did taste like brownies, and they were moist but they also had a slightly gummy texture that wasn't expected for a brownie. I have a recipe for zucchini chocolate cake that really rocks so I was excited for this recipe until I tried it. This recipe isn't horrible but it isn't great either so it gets 3 stars.

Very rich and fudgy. I didn't make them though; I gave the recipe to a coworker for a zucchini bake-off. She followed the recipe exactly. They were good--but not anything I'd make again unless we were doing another zucchini bake-off and wanted something different. Very rich. Very fudgy. Worth a shot if you have a super-chocolately sweet tooth!!

I used Splenda instead of sugar and left out the nuts.  These tasted really great, but I wonder, did anyone else's brownies come out kinda "lumpy" on top?  The top wasn't smooth like normal brownies are, so I was afraid to make the icing that was listed - I didn't know if it would be thick enough to cover the lumps and bumps - so I used a regular cream cheese frosting.  I do agree they are very cake-like brownies, but they are also very good and very moist.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have to say these surprised me. Really tasty, kids said "mom why can't you just make them the regular way" they weren't too impressed. I had Penzey's Dutch Cocoa & had to add a tad bit of water to my zucchini (it didn't have any moisture at all). I beat the frosting for quite a while in my kitchenaid to get a sheen going. Very good, thanks!!

These were great.  The flour stuck to the brownies too much so I think I'll just grease the pan next time.  I used 1/4 cup prune puree instead of oil and 1 cup fructose instead of regular sugar.  These brownies came out moist and delicious!  Great way to use zucchini.

These were fantastic. I used yellow summer squash, substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour, and did 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce to make a slightly healthier version. Then I erased all those healthy qualities by adding in a cup of chocolate chips! They were moist, chocolatee and yummy. Not like cake, not chewy, somewhere in between, but great! I didn't make the frosting and I think next time I might lower the sugar amount to 1 cup.

These were really good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  There was a tiny 'earthy' after-taste, but I will definitely make this again, especially with a bumper crop of zukes to use up.

OH MY GOSH, these are soooo moist and gooey! If you didn't know about the zucchini, you won't be able to taste it.
I followed the recipe exactly, except that I left out the nuts and frosting, added some chocolate chips, I think you don't need the frosting if you added the chocolate chips! 

DO NOT ADD EGGS/ WATER to the flour and sugar mixture, it's supposed to be very dry and thick (but once you add the zucchini, it would be fine), use your hands if it's too dry to blend

If you make this recipe correctly, it is wonderful.  I would have called it a cake rather than a brownie, though, as it reminds me more of a Texas Sheet Cake.  There are a few major things to remember when making this recipe.  #1 - DO NOT SQUEEZE THE LIQUID FROM THE ZUCCHINI!  #2 - The batter takes several minutes of stirring/folding before it comes together.  People who gave it a poor review saying that the batter was like sand just didn't stir it long enough.  If you follow the recipe, you will have a very moist and rich chocolate cake.  I thought the icing was good, too.

Really nice brownie. 

I would strongly suggest decreasing salt to half a teaspoon because a teaspoon made it overly salty especially with the high amount of baking soda which is already very salty tasting. 

Also, mix the sugar and oil VERY well before adding dry ingredients or you will get a very gritty brownie. 

I enjoyed these a lot and the icing was delicious with them, I added a little more cocoa to it because I like a deep chocolate flavor, not just sugary tasting.

Overall, I will be making these many more times I think!

I give this 5 star because it is so versatile. I altered to use applesauce, 1/2c sugar/ 1/2c splenda and whole wheat flour (no choco topping). It defintely satisfied my brownie craving, without the guilt!!

These are really good! My five year old has decided that they are "the best brownies EVER!" I did add more water when I was mixing, because my batter was really dry. I just added a little bit of water at a time, until all of the flour and cocoa was moistened. I also didn't put frosting on them, although I might next time. I have to admit, I wasn't very thrilled with them on the night that I made them, but I had one the next day and changed my mind. These are great!

This was awesome! I really didn't change much either. I did use yellow summer squash since I have so much and didn't figure it was much different than zucchini. Some people complained about the dry batter. So I peeled it then shredded the squash real fine,then added the salt to it. I did add about 1 TBLS more of oil. Also I've never read how big a zucchini should be to use or if you should use the seeds. I used a very large squash(16 inches across)I cut out all the seeds and just used the "meat" of the squash and I used 2 packed cups. My husband and kids say it's the best brownie they've ever had. Real moist. The frosting was great too. Thanks for a great brownie.

We liked this recipe. I have to say I thought something must be missing from the recipe until I added the zucchini because the batter was so dry. But, the end result was just fine. I will make them again.

Wow, these are pretty impressive!  I used the finer side of the grater, substituted 1/4 c canola oil and 1/4 evoo for the vegetable oil. It does not have the texture of a dense, fudgy brownie, more like very moist cake with a brownie flavor.  My DD said this was only 2 stars, then she ate more and it was a 3, a little more and it was 4. I loved the look on her face when she found out there was a huge zucchini in it!  Ha!  Now if I could just cut some of the fat in that delicious frosting!  I will make these again whenever zucchini is in season!

These are the best brownies I have ever eaten.  I was concerned when I had to press this dry mass into the 9X13, but they were extremely moist when they came out of the oven.  The fudge topping was so delicious!!  My family and friends loved them.

Look Mom, no eggs!  That's right.  You really don't need them for these tasty treats.  The "brownies" were more like a moist and delicious snack cake, in my opinion.  That may have been because I subbed applesauce for the oil.  I also used Splenda in place of half of the sugar.  It's true that there is a slight vegetable aftertaste if the brownies are eaten warm from the oven, but there isn't even a hint of zucchini flavor in the cooled and frosted bars.  People won't know about the secret ingredient unless you tell them!

OMG!!  These were moist and fudgy, NOT cakey at all!  I added mini chocolate chips and a little extra cocoa powder. I took the advice of a few other reviewers and added the salt to the zucchini (rather than to the dry ingred.) and let it draw out the extra moisture and it worked perfectly.  I used my 12x12 Wilton square cake/bar pan and only baked for 15 minutes.   Did not need the frosting since these were extra sweet from the addition of the chocolate chips.  This recipe is a keeper!!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe! UPDATE:  Just had them again and this time with the frosting...soooooo rich and yummy!  Great either way!  Pour a big cold glass of milk and enjoy!!!

The brownies were good, but not amazing.  My husband liked them more than I did.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they came moist, but not really fudge-like.  I made them a second time and substituted yogurt for half of the oil.  They were a little heavier (not as cake-like) and healthier.  I froze the brownies in little baggies for lunches and discovered that they are much better frozen.  In any case, I probably won't make these again unless I have tons of zucchinis to use up.

This recipe is awesome! I am trying to get my husband to eat his veggies, and this does the trick. I may have forgot to mention to him one of the ingredients ;)  
I personally would call this cake, I like fudgy brownies and these are cakelike. But no matter what they are sooooo gooood! The icing is a must, it really gives it good chocolaty flavor. I also used applesauce instead of the oil.

these had an 'essance' of zucchini when I bit into it.  I followed the ingredients and directions, but ommitted the frosting.
I may try again and do some tweaking.  I love brownies and w/o the frosting, these make a great low fat option

These are wonderful. I was a little unsure about if you are supposed to pack the zucchini in the measuring cup or not but my batter was really moist and the brownies came out perfect. I didn't add the glaze and just put a half bag of chocolate chips on top. I took them to party and everyone loved them. Thanks so much. I will be making these tons.

These were really good - you couldn't even tell the zucchini was in there (I thought it would be like zuc bread and you wouldn't taste it but you could see and maybe get a string of it now and then, but it disappeared!)  husband and kids both loved them, too.  I must have measured something incorrectly, because my "batter" was crumbly it was so dry and I had to press it into the pan.  They were still good, but the bottoms were still crumbly rather than moist, so next time if it is that crumbly I will add a little milk or something.  We didn't do the icing, as hubby doesn't like icing, so can't comment on that.  Definitely will make again!

Wonderful! This recipie was great.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and it turned out delicious! I love the sauce, it was a perfect compliment. It reminds me of a favorite desert from "down under" except I can control the nuts, in addition, this recipie is healthier with the zucchini, margarine.  I used unbleached flour instead of bleached flour.  Will definately make again.  I served warm with a few scoops of Bryers french vanilla ice cream, Yum!!

These were fabulous.  I made them just as the recipe called for with the addition of 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  I was worried with the batter at first because it was so dry and crumbly (not like any other brownie batter I've seen...) but the zucchini slowly moistened the batter and they baked up just right.  The brownies were not too sweet, so the frosting was a perfect compliment.  Great recipe - I will definitely make these again.

this is an absolutely outstanding brownie recipe.  I'm a new cook and baking is definitely not my strong suit, but this went very well and my guests raved about the browines.  I was concerned upon taking the brownies out of the oven in that they seemed dry and crumbly, but a bit of cooling fixed that.

The chocolate icing on this was awesome, but I don't think my family and I could get past the zucchini in this.  I think I'll stick with traditional brownies.  But, I'll be keeping this icing recipe!

Four out of five people said it was good. So I rated it 4 out of 5.  

Please taste the batter before you bake it.  Even if you dont like the brownies, this is the most delicious batter

These were quite tasty, especially for having a vegetable in them! I'm not sure what other folks are doing to the mixture to describe the final product as "cakelike" though. Mine were fudgy and perfectly brownie-like. Perhaps adding an egg, using applesauce, or cooking too long are factors that are contributing to the complaints? I made the recipe exactly as written except that I substitued chocolate chips for the walnuts, and I reduced the cook time to 20 minutes instead of 25-30. (The toothpick came out with just a little bit of batter on it after 20 minutes, but I set the pan on top of the stove and let it do some carry over cooking. It ended up being the perfect doneness after the brownies cooled.) The batter was surprisingly dry, and I found that I had better results getting it smoothed out in the pan using my hand. Also, I didn't shred my zucchini; instead, I just minced it with a knife. I probably won't make these brownies again (I prefer going the lazy store-bought mix route), but they were definitely worth being made!

I read the reviews first before I tried this recipe and I am thankful that I did. I would have been totally unprepared for the texture of this batter. When I put it in the pan to go in the oven, it was soooooo dry i thought "there is no way this will turn out". BUT IT DID!!! I followed the recipe exactly, only changing the 1/2 cup nuts to 1/2 cup mini M&M baking bits. It is one of the moistest brownies I have made. And the taste is GREAT. I gave it to my 3 nephews and they had no idea it had zucchini in it. I will definitely make these again. Thank you for this very interesting recipe.

I didn't have a problem with a dry batter - even before I added the zucchini, my batter was a little moist, and after I added the zucchini, I could pour the batter into the pan like any other brownie recipe. Here's what I did: I followed the recipe amounts exactly, subbing olive oil for veggie oil, and I used my kitchenaid stand mixer. While I was combining the sugar and the oil, I made sure to scrape the sides and bottom to make sure that the oil got properly mixed throughout the sugar. I let this go for two or three minutes until the mixture was the consistency of wet sand. I put all the dry ingredients together in a bowl and "sifted" them with a sideways fork (my usual method). Then, I know you usually don't want to overbeat brownie batters, but in this case it looked dry so I kept the mixer going and I scraped down the sides again. I think this part took probably four or five minutes--a lot longer than you would think for brownie batter, but it resulted in a slightly moist dough and that might have been responsible for my success. I used three small zucchini, which made pretty much exactly two cups shredded. I mixed the zucchini in pretty thoroughly in my mixer. At the end, I stirred a little more with my spatula (have to scrape the bottom!) and folded in a few chocolate chips. The batter poured easily into the pan, though it was a little thick so I had to spread it out a little. The finished product, well, it's like the zucchini melted right away. There's nothing prickly

I thought this recipe was good.  I have to admit, I was a little skeptical when mixing the batter.  The batter will be very dry and crumbly.  The more you work the zucchini, the more moisture was produce.  I was quite surprised by the finished product.  The brownies were very moist.  I made the icing and thought it was great.  My fiance couldn't taste the zucchini and was amazed when I told him that it was the secret ingredient.  I don't know what the other cooks did, but the brownies didn't taste salty to me.  The key is the really work the mixture to prevent dry clumps in the mixture.  I allowed the zucchini to become room temp. after I shredded them.  As the zucchini sits, you can see the water coming off of it.  Maybe that will help with the dry or salty results.  Will definitely make again.

I used this recipe as a starting off point. I made the following modifications: instead of 1/2 cup oil I used 1/4 cup oil & 1/4 cup applesauce; instead of 2 cups white flour I used 1 cup wheat & 1 cup white. The batter seemed too crumbly and grainy to me, even after adding fresh zucchini (as some other reviewers noted). so to be on the safe side I added about 1/4 cup milk and drizzled in a bit of chocolate syrup to boost the chocolatey flavor. The brownies came out mosit and gooey (I may have underbaked a bit). By tomorrow, I bet they will be just right. I also made more of a cake type frosting (I just changed the amounts a bit until I got the right consistency) and frosted the entire brownies with a thin layer instead of just drizzling on. My husband and daughter both had seconds! Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! My friends and family devoured them! I used frozen shredded zucchini from last summer which turned out great. The water produced when thawing the zucchini made the mixture easy to mix. Upon the second time making this recipe, I left off the glaze altogether. The brownies were so moist and cake-like that it didn't seem to need anything extra.

Wait a day before making an opinion on these brownies. Something happens over night and they are way better the next day. Day One they are more cakey, but by Day Two they are definitely fudgy and moist like a brownie should be. I agree with the others who mentioned they taste a little salty. However, this was more noticeable the first day.  I didn't really detect it the second. The "batter" is very dry, "sandy" really. I guess I should have pressed it into the pan more because, after baking, the top and sides remained a bit gritty (I didn't make the icing, I bet that hides the grittiness).  The best part is that my kids gobble this up. You can't taste the zucchini at all and they would never eat zucchini if it weren't disguised by chocolate. I would definitely make this again when I have leftover zucchini.

Wow!  These are amazing!  I grated 1 whole zucchini which came out to 2 cups.  Also baked for 30 minutes.  I, too, was skeptical of the dry batter but they turned out really good!  Crunchy top with a smooth, chewy centre.  I brought these to work and nobody could guess what the secret ingredient was.  Thanks so much!  Will definitely make in the future.

I like the idea of using zucchini in a chocolate treat. I once saw Iron Chef Cat Cora use eggplant to make chocolate cupcakes, and was very interested in doing something like that... but since we don't eat chocolate, I substituted carob powder and followed the rest of the recipe. Maybe there was still water on the zucch from washing it, but ours was cake-like, and still ok.

UGH the frosting was absolutely terrible.  I cannot fathom how anyone would like the frosting... it is even worse than store bought.  The brownies were ok, a little bland and not much to brag about.

YUMMO! Great recipe!  Made it over the weekend, my nieces loved it! After they ate 2, I told them to guess what the secret ingredient was, when I told them what it was, they were so shocked and wanted some more!  Can't wait to make it again!

I had to increase the cooking time by about 20 mins.  I did not ice (my husband is a diabetic) so to hide the zucchini shreds that were visible on the top, I sprinkled cocoa powder over the whole thing using an old salt shaker.  This did the trick and no one guessed there was zucchini in them!

These are wonderfully moist and rich.  I added 1/4 c. chocolate chips because they were hanging around in the freezer but the recipe certainly didn't need them! Although the batter is really dry until you add the zucchini, it is quicki to put together and bake.  My 16 testers all gave it the "thumbs up" rating!   Edited to add: I did not ice these as they did not seem to need it; I baked the batch for about 40 minutes, checking every 3 minutes after 30 minutes had passed.

Disappointing.  Don't know what I did wrong, but these flopped.  Maybe I didn't bake them long enough.  I put it in the oven for 25 min as suggested.  The brownie was gritty and the oil flavour was overwhelming.  I'll give these one more try and will use margarine next time and bake it longer.

I thought this was fairly good, but I did make some changes: no icing, only 1 cup sugar, and whole wheat flour. No one suspected anything and everyone enjoyed. I did use an overgrown zucchini from Mom's garden, which I recommend for moisture. Next time I would try to cut back on the oil and maybe add some applesauce.

Made this today with the cocoa this time, made it in a bundt cake pan for a birthday celebration.  (I added 3 eggs, subbed the oil out for 1 stick melted butter and 1/4 cup applesauce, added 1/4 cup sour cream and 2/3 cup lightly floured chocolate chips.  It turned out amazing.  I even forgot the vanilla and it still got raves... my kids had seconds and wanted thirds.  (OK, I did serve it with whipped cream, fresh blackberries and a fresh blackberry sauce I made.  But it was great even without all the gourmet touches.)

GREAT RECIPE!!  I made this 4 times in the last week.  My mother in law had a ton of extra zucchini.  It's a great cross between Texas sheet cake and fudge brownies.  Twice I added 1 egg and it turned out more cake-like, which was equally good.  An easy and kinda nutricious way to get a chocolate fix.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. It is a healthy way to satisfy the brownie urge, though it is more of a cakey bar than a brownie. Works best if you use an overgrown zuke - 12" or larger. The baby ones don't contain enough moisture.  Also, I add about 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips and skip the frosting.

Amazing!  These were delicious.  I do agree with some reviewers on the fact that these were not extremely dense.  However, they were definitely NOT cake-like.  Like other reviewers, I used half applesauce/half oil, and I didn't make the frosting.  I added a few chocolate chips into the batter to make the brownies even more chocolatey, and they were delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was excited when I found a brownie recipe to use up zucchini.  I read all the reviews and followed the recipe exactly, and was very disappointed.  The texture was nice and dense, but the taste just wasn't right.  I guess if I want brownies, I'll make brownies.  If I need to use up zucchini, I'll make the super yummy "Mom's Zucchini Bread" from this site.

After a bit past a half-hour, mine still weren't "springing back gently" but they hardened after I let them sit for a bit.  This could be a product of my oven, just saying.  Also, make sure to mix it together well - Put on a glove and go to town with your hand.  It's still firm for a batter, but I think people might have gotten dry results from not mixing properly.

They tasted okay, but they were not at all what I was hoping for.  They were very cake-like... I prefer my brownies to be fudgy.

I made it exactly as written and although it was dry and crumbly going in, I expected it to turn out well.  It didn't.  It was dry and crumbly out of the oven, too.  And the flavor was weird...not even good enough to use as crumbles on top of ice cream.  A huge disappointment!

oh my gosh!  these are awesome!  very rich and fudgey.  i made them for my hubbies poker night.  the guys raved and couldn't believe there was zucchini in them.  the key to rich brownies is to use real butter.

I made the recipe as given, minus the frosting.  The mixture looked nothing like batter but was dry and crumbly.  I had major doubts when I put it in the oven, but the end product was delicious!  They were so moist even after 4 or 5 days.  I gave some to the ladies who had given me the fresh zucchini and they couldn't believe that there was zucchini in the brownies.  Great recipe, thanks!

Im always looking for a more nutritional way to feed my family.  Especially when we are craving chocolate.  I came across this fabulous recipe and thought, weird, but why not.  We LOVE zucchini!
All I have to say is WOW.  Excellent!!!
I changed a few things.  I used canola oil instead, unbleached flour, omitted the nuts and added about 2 tbls of water.
They looked like boxed brownies when done, and were DEVOURED quickly.
One question... how do I check the nutritional value of this recipe?  Is it any better for you than ordinary brownies?

I love these - but beware - don't use splenda to make them, they don't come together.  They came out of the oven a crumbly mess. Tasted good but not to easy to eat!  My kids love them and think it is funny they are eating zucchini!  Great recipe.

Fabulous!  I left off the frosting since my baby has a dairy/soy allergy and they were still delicious.  Mine did come out a bit cakey but I am sure it was because there was so much liquid in the zucchini.  So yummy though and super easy to make!!!!

These were amazing, though I would have to agree and consider this more a cake. I mixed the zuccini with the oil and vanilla (plus a dash of cinnamon) first and let it set for a good couple of minutes before I did any of the other steps, and had no problems with dry batter as I've read many others have. The icing was fabulous too. Definately a chocolate lovers cake, and my au pair family loved it, even the kids, who are picky and hate vegetables! I'll be making this cake again!

Can I give this more than 5 stars???  I have made this recipe now a couple of times...the first time was for my son's 9th birthday party.  He isn't a fan of cakes and icecreams and that sort of thing so birthdays are always a little difficult to make goodies for!  However, he LOVED these brownies as did the rest of the group!  One child in particular swooped in for a FOURTH piece!  I am forever DONE buying brownie mixes!  This recipe is the BEST!!!!!  Thank you!!!!

Awesome recipe - moist and perfect.  I had so much zucchini in my garden that I froze some.  The frozen has worked well  in the recipe too.

These are moist, delicious,cake-like brownies. They were devoured by my family in about 15 minutes. I substituted 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and they turned out great. I will definitely make again!

WOW!! I can't even tell you how good these are in words!! If you are a true chocolate lover, these are for you...Follow the recipe carefully and you will have no problems-Only compliment after compliment on how delicious they are. Great way to get a small serving of veggies into the kids that are stubborn when it comes to eating things that are green and healthy! Super moist and super rich-You need a tall glass of milk to go with them. I baked them in an 8x8 baking dish and cooked for about 40-45 min. Came out thick and gorgeous, like chocolate cake-Yummy! Thanks so much for sharing this one =)

The most amazing brownie out there!  Moist, rich, easy! Our family loves them and I ejoy that I can use the tons of zucchini coming from the garden.  My favorite part is making up a batch with the frosting and giving them as gifts with a recipe card and a medium zucchini!  Everybody loves it!

The only change I EVER make is adding semi-sweet chips.  It sends it over the top!

Enjoy!

WOW!! What a fantastic recipe!! As I was mixing this up I was thinking that I had done something wrong because the batter seemed so dry and crumbly; I was convinced that this wouldn't turn out. What a surprise this recipe is! I used a very high quality, dutched baking cocoa in both the brownie and the frosting; this recipe makes a very moist, fudgy, chocolately tasting brownie. The frosting is a must...I actually doubled the frosting, and aside from that, I made the recipe exactly as written. OUTSTANDING!! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe; I happened upon it in the nick of time as my son was beginning to grumble about all of the zucchini bread I was making. He didn't grumble about these browines a bit, and was shocked to learn that he was eating "zucchini" brownies.

Wow, what a delicious treat!  Okay, I halved the recipe because I had an 8x8 pan.  I used only 2/3 cup of sugar.  Mix was really dry even with heaping measure of zucchini so I added a 4 oz. container of natural applesauce.  More like cake but terrific.  Surprised no egg.  Family loved it.  I didn't make frosting, instead sprinkled chocolate chips on top before baking.

Very good.  I made this recipe exactly except I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/4 cup non-sweetened applesauce.  When I made the frosting, it seemed too runny to me so I added another cup of confectioners' sugar.  It seemed very sweet and actually was a bit dry and cracked after being spread.  Think I will stick to the 2 cups.  My 14 yr. old son, who is extremely picky, never would have touched these had he known there was zucchini in them.  He thought they tasted great - I'll wait till the pan is finished to tell him what was in there!

These were pretty good.  Very moist, but not chocolaty enough for my taste, & I even used dutch cocoa.  Next time I will add a half cup of chocolate chips.  I made them for a church BBQ & everyone loved them.  One lady even asked for the recipe.  It's more of a cake than a brownie & the batter will seem very dry & crumbly until you add the zucchini.

Absolutely delicious!  Moist and chewey!  More like cake than brownie but that suited our tastes perfectly!  Did not frost but served with light ice cream.  Will make frequently.  My husband did not know there was zucchini in his dessert, and I did not tell him!  Next time, I will frost it and serve as cake!  Many thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I absolutely love these brownies!!  My favorite response to these brownies is "What is the green stuff in the brownies?"  People are always delightfully surprised to discover that they are made with zucchini.  I always make the frosting and they turn out wonderful.  I prefer to cook them in an 8x8 pan because they turn out perfectly moist and delicious!!

Oh Yum! We ALL loved them (hubby, me and our daughters which are sometimes picky). I reduced the sugar to one cup, didn't add nuts (not popular with the under 10s in this house), and didn't bother with the icing. I wanted to use them in our girls' lunchboxes, and couldn't justify adding icing. Next time I will try the recipe with half oil, half apple sauce too as I think it would still be nice (but I like sticking to the original the first time). The brownies were not crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside, but a nice chocolaty treat. They freeze well and defrost nicely in the children's lunchboxes. I packed my zucchini fairly well when I measured them, and put them in with the oil/sugar mixture and had no problem whatsoever with my batter. I'm about to go share that recipe with friends now. Thank you Marian!

Great recipe!  These are cake-like, not dense and fudgy.  The only changes I made was that I used 1/4 c oil and 1/4 applesauce and omitted the nuts.  I omitted the frosting because it doesn't need it and I thought it would then make them "unhealthy" brownies!  Just the recipe I was looking for to use up some more zucchini!

These are good.  I gave the recipe to a friend and she added an egg to the recipe and I liked the way hers came out better so I will probably add an egg from now on.  I also use half white flour and half whole wheat flour to make them even more healthy.

These cake-like brownies are delicious, I've made them several times.  I substitute 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 cup of oil, and they come out very moist.  I have not tried them with the frosting, but they are great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

It's great. my kids ate it all.--even the zucchiniphobic. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 applesauce to reduce the calories and then added 1/2 cup chocolate chips .also substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the white flour... yummy!

These were DELICIOUS!! I was very skeptical when mixing this all up as it was dry.  Instead of "folding" the zuchinni in, I mixed it in with my standing mixer and the batter became quite moist.  I did not add eggs, I did not add more liquid, and made the frosting for it.  I followed the recipe exactly and WOW these disappeared fast!  This is my new recipe for using up all our garden zuchinni!  Fantastic!

Two words.... Got milk?  Wow, these are very rich, moist brownies.  Incredible!!  I did add a total of 3 cups of zucchini.  I also added a dash of cinnamon to the frosting.  They were gone in an instant!

Can't say enough about this recipe!! Everyone I know that has tried them, has loved them. I don't think the eggs missing are a problem at all.I replaced half the oil with applesauce, and half the sugar with splenda. Added a handful of peanut butter chips. Does not need the frosting at all. Have handed out this recipe 8 times since using it 3 weeks ago.Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This recipe was wonderful!  My husband can not have sugar due to hypoglycemia, so I made the brownies with Splenda instead of sugar.  Also, because of the Splenda, I added an extra 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda.  To increase the amount of protein (again to help with the hypoglycemia), I added 2 eggs to the recipe.  My husband was thrilled with the brownies, and I liked them, too!

These were PHENOMENAL!  So chocolatey and moist.  I followed the recipe exactly, well, without the frosting.  They were so yummy it was hard to not eat the entire pan in one day, but I cut them up and froze some for another time (I have LOTS of zucchini to use up).  It does look weird when you mix it up, but the moisture in the zucchini cooks them just right.  My husband always hated zucchini until I learned to make desserts with it.  He loves it especially now!

Boy, these are good!  The only change I made was to add one egg.  I thought it was weird that there weren't any in the recipe.  I think I'll skip it next time, as the brownie was very "cake -like".  These were moist, and chocolately.  I also used canned icing instead of making it from scratch.  I never usually put icing on my brownies, and when I make them again, I doubt I will put icing on them again.  It really doesn't need it.  I think this will be my new brownie recipe from now on.  Now I will have a reason to make more brownies as my garden starts to overflow with zucchini!

Excellent recipe.  I agree with others, it's more like a cake, but still very, very good.  Very moist, even 3 days later.  I made a couple changes: added an egg and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  Also, instead of icing it after baking, I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top before baking.  Turned out great!  Thanks for this recipe.

I agree with others - very cake like but good flavor.  I was a little confused when mixxing because the batter was so dry that I ended up adding some liquid to it.  I would make these again, with a few modifications and adding some chocolate chips.

I extracted the liquid from the zucchini and also added an egg - the batter was pretty dry, and the brownies came out cake-like.  Still, they're good as cake!  I also cut down on the sugar, but as a result the cake wasn't nearly sweet enough, so I would leave it all in.

I only made a few changes. I added the zucchini in with the wet ingredients before adding the dry instead of adding it last. I also added about 2/3 cup of chocolate chips, just because I like chips in my brownies. They turned out unbelievably moist and tasty. Love them!!

Except for adding 1 Egg and deleting the walnuts
(made these for daycare children) I followed
the recipe exactly.  I frosted the brownies w/
canned frosting.  I did not like these brownies.
They were not exceptionally moist--and was 'missing' that brownie taste I was looking for.

But, 3 out  of 8 children I served these to
liked them!  I will keeping trying other
zucchini recipes....

This is an awesome recipe. I was a little worried when I first started mixing the ingredients. It was extremely dry until I added the zucchini and really mixed it in. They baked perfectly and the frosting was delicious. Would definitely make again and you would never know there was zucchini in the mix!

Even my young boys will eat this! Everyone is so surprised that zucchini is in this! Try it..you'll love it! I can even get by with using all whole wheat pastry flour to reduce carb counts a bit, but it is less sweet that way.

Yummy!!!  A great way to use up that pesky zucchini.  These taste amazing!  I found mine were a tiny bit crumbly so next time I might add an egg or egg yolk.  Other than that, these are awesome!

Yummy!  I (like a lot of others) was really concerned about the batter being WAY TOO DRY, but as soon as I added the zucchini it was fine.  (I was tempted to add egg, but I waited until I added the zucchini to see what happened to the batter) =-)  They turned out very moist.  I wasn't crazy about the frosting...it was a little too sweet for me.  I will be making these again when I get more zucchini!

Very good brownies!  They are very cake-like in texture.  I could only see the zucchini if I looked really hard.  The flavor was very good.  The frosting is very sweet (reminds me of my mom's texas sheet cake brownies and frosting).  If I make them again, I'd probably put the brownie mix in my 13x15 pan so they'd be a little thinner, but use the same amount of frosting (may need a little more milk.  The cooking time may need adjusted then.

We love these brownies!They are very moist.It is important to use fresh young zucchinis-since the recipe is dry when you mix together,the moisture from the zucchini is very important.Also I mixed for awhile so the dough moistened up nicely!

I made this recipe exactly as shown.  It was the driest, most bizarre looking "batter" I have ever seen, and it looked like lumpy dirt when it was done.  My husband, who doesn't even like rich chocolate things, thought it was the best brownie he had ever eaten.  My son, who is a vegetable hater, would not believe it had zucchini it in until I showed him the recipe.  The only thing I would do differently next time is leave off the very sweet icing and just have a light dusting of powdered sugar.

Wonderful brownie! Very gooey and chocolaty. No one believed there was zucchini in them at a family dinner. It does mix up to one ugly batter and I was skeptical but after one bite I have a new favorite brownie recipe. What a great way to slip in a little nutrition.

I was a bit skeptical when putting this together; boy, was I wrong!  It turned out great.  The only thing I changed was that I used a smaller pan (9x9) and used half the frosting.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this last night.  
I doubled the recipe and baked in the 9x13 pan.  I baked it for about 55 mins.  Cooled for a few hours.  
I made the frosting (doubled it also) and frosted it.  
We couldn't wait to have a piece.  We all had a piece and we could taste the zucchini, and the frosting had that powdered sugar taste, even though I whipped the bejesus out of it in my kitchenade.  
BUT, the next morning I had a piece for breakfast (LOL), it was THE BOMB!  
It needed to mellow overnight.  It is sooo moist and the frosting is TOO good.
We're going to visit friends for the upcoming weekend.
I'll be making it on Friday night to take on Saturday.
I know my friends are going to go CRAZY over it!

This recipe is another good reason to subscribe to the Daily Dish online. I wouldn't have known about it otherwise and right now I have a lot of zucchini to use. It seems way too dry when you're putting it together, but the outcome is amazingly good. My family loved it - even without frosting.

I made 2 slight changes - 1 used 1 very large zucchini & omitted the walnuts. My pan was slightly smaller - 9x9. My cooking time was double as there was so much courgette. The result wasn't brownie like for me - but it didn't matter. With the frosting, it made an incredibly moist & decadent chocolate cake.  I think with less zucchini it would have been more brownie like but we utterly loved it. Definitely a keeper for me! Made this non baker look like a kitchen genius!

I followed the recipe and they are ok.  I was hoping to be able to trick my 7 year old into eating some vegetables and unfortunately he wouldn’t way them.  My 4 year old ate half of one and said he liked it so we’ll see.   I had to bake them for an extra ten minutes and they were still really gooey.

These are very good! The “batter” is somewhat crumbly, so I wasn’t sure if I had done something wrong; but I patted it into the pan, and the brownies turned out great!

Followed and added 1 c mini chocolate chips. Split sugar to half dark brown and half white. A fun add in is 16 Oreos crushed by hand and folded in at end. Takes five to ten min longer. Makes a moist fudgy brownie.

Mine turned out fairly dry and I followed the recipe exactly until the end when I had a crumble to mix my zucc into so I added more oil to make it smooth figuring the water from the zucc would help the rest of the way. They were still dry and barely held together . 
The frosting recipe is fabulous though and they were still tasty. 
I would make it again but I would sift my flour prior to measuring. Perhaps just normal scooping gives too much flour  and made me have issues.

Good but I don't know how it would turn out with fresh zucchini. I used previously frozen zucchini, defrosted and added all the liquid along with it.

I added chocolate chips for an extra chocolate punch and did not frost. Brownies are so moist and delicious! I would say it is more cakey than brownie. But no complaints from me!

This recipe is easy and I feel good knowing that there is a vegetable in there!  Mine came out more like a cake consistency but I think I mixed it too much when I should have folded in the zucchini and nuts.  I’ll try it again and fold rather than mix.  Very tasty.

Looked way too dry before mixing in zucchini. The zucchini saved the day when I used a blender to blend it in. It looked like perfect brownie batter. I took this to a picnic with the frosting on the side so those with dietary restrictions might be able to have some. I came home with an empty pan and lots of frosting.

I did replace half the oil with unsweetened applesauce, as I do in all recipes. Also, omitted the nuts due to family preference. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated. I did need to bake them for 35 minutes. These turned out nicely, more cake-like than fudgy. I thought they did need the frosting, which was nice and creamy. I will probably not make them again, however, as we prefer a fudgier brownie.

These came out incredibly delicious!  The only changes that I made were to add the shredded zucchini to the sugar/oil mixture and then add the dry ingredients, about half at a time, which resulted in a nicely spreadable batter -- and to use half a container of Pillsbury chocolate fudge frosting instead of making my own (warmed in the microwave it spreads beautifully on the brownies .)  I will make these again and again!!

Easy, and very nice texture and flavor. Next time I will use a cooking spray for the pan. The flour dusting left an unpleasant taste. I used a Hersey Premium Dark Cocoa Powder, and walnuts. No salt.  I have high blood pressure, and this will make an excellent low=sodium treat. May have 0mg sodium without the salt. Make sure to mix the sugar and oil separately, before adding the flour mixture, I added mine altogether, and it may have effected the final product. It was delicious, except for the dusting flour. I will fine tune this.

These were amazing! I had one smallish zucchini left from another recipe and wanted to make a dessert. I didn’t quite have the 2 full cups of zucchini so I added 6oz of applesauce. It did give them a little more cakey texture but they still tasted fudgey.  Omitted the nuts due to food allergies. Even my anti-brownie hubs loved these because they weren’t dry. I also love that the recipe itself is egg and dairy free if you don’t do the frosting, but we also loved the frosting, thankfully we aren’t dairy allergic.

Made these exactly as directed except used butter in the frosting instead of margarine. These are the BEST brownies I have ever had. However, they are a bit cake-like but a tad more dense. They are extremely moist! Next time I may try adding more zucchini or try to find something to make them more like the texture of a brownie. But these brownies are amazing as is!

These came out pretty decent. I scaled down the recipe since I didn't need a large pan worth of brownies. No eggs in the recipe made scaling it easy. The batter seems super dry and crumbly before you add the zucchini, but don't worry! Once you add the zucchini in it gets a lot more moist. It still seemed a TAD dry but I persevered, and was glad I did. They came out soft but not too cakey. 
I skipped the frosting simply because I'm not a fan of frosting on brownies, and just sprinkled some chocolate chips on the top instead. They came out really well and hey, a little hidden veggies in your dessert never hurt!

I made this as written, except for an addition of 1/2 c. chocolate chips.  Very moist (falls apart) and delicious, the frosting makes it special.  However, if you didn't want the frosting, these could easily go without it and still be moist and delicious!

First off, the taste is yummy! I do have to give them that.. and perhaps I did something wrong as there are so many good reviews, and I did follow the exact recipe. The ‘batter’ was like a wet sand- which some said it would be dry. After baking them, and cooling, my son cut one. He said it was really good but crumbly. He was right. Will this keep me from eating the rest? Nope- because as i said above, they ARE yummy! They may fall apart but have a fudgy texture, and crispy top, just how i like my brownies(minus the crumble)...

I didn't make any changes. I would have liked it better if it had been chocolate-ier. The sugar didn't dissolve, even though I mixed it with oil as instructed, so it was crunchy. Weird!

A delicious chocolatey CAKE! You cant tell it apart from any other cake.  Near impossible to cut as it fell apart as a think cake in a brownie pan. Might work in a cake pan though.

Excellent brownies, great recipe! Just a word of warning, the batter seems extremely dry and I started wondering if I missed an ingredient... until the zucchini started to release some moisture. Stick it out and keep folding! Also, we did not need the frosting. Plenty sweet on their own!

I followed the recipe exactly and after putting it in the baking dish went back and made another batch. I dumped it in on top and baked it for 40 min and then added 10 more so it was firmish to the touch. I did not make a frosting and I think they are chewy enough and deliicious. I will keep this and use it

Absolutley Delicious!!! My kids gobbled these up! I did not have enough ingredients to make the frosting, so we sprinkled chocolate chips on top, and my 2 zucchini actually yielded 3 cups, so I used an additional cup! I only had coconut oil, so I used that, and they were perfection! The next day they were even better!!!

These were ok to eat, but just ok.  I probably wouldn't make them again unless I was so stressed I was planning to eat the whole pan of brownies and just wanted to mitigate the dietary damage somehow.

Sidenote: I'm vegetarian and a fan of zucchini baking recipes, so definitely no anti-zucchini prejudice going on here.  They were just meh brownies.

I made these today and I don't care for the batter (dry crumbs) at all. You couldn't spread it out, you had to take your fingers and push it out to the edges and flatten it. They didn't taste too bad but they are very dry and for the people that say they aren't or we must have used an egg or something-NO I followed recipe exactly and horrible texture (and I bake and cook for over 45 years). Like I said they didn't taste to bad just dry,

These are fabulous!
I accidentally spilled the last of my vanilla on the counter just before adding it to the frosting. Mint extract makes a perfect substitute. My daughter actually asked that future batches be made with the mint frosting.

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. The mixture was quite crumbly, I wasn’t sure it was going to work out but it was absolutely awesome. I iced them since I had made the icing but it was not necessary . Next time I’ll leave them bare.

Don't drain the zucchini (whether using fresh or frozen).  I made the mistake once and they turned out dry.  Otherwise, they've been delicious every time.  Love the frosting too.

Followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.  Rich and chocolately and helped use up zucchini I had from the garden.  The first batch I shared with the neighbors.  The 2nd batch I'm storing in the freezer.  This recipe is really good.

I’ve been making this recipe for over 10 years.  Always great, kids love it & everyone else that’s tried it. I don’t usually make the frosting, I just fold in some chocolate chips. Yummy!

Talk about dry! These were pretty near terrible, but I frosted them to try moistening them. I definitely won’t make them again since there are so many good recipes out there.

I liked the brownies. Dark chocolate in color. I used 1/2 cup of margarine instead of oil and the recipe came out nice. Looked more like cake. Instead of frosting I used vanilla ice cream. This would really taste even better with a chocolate sauce drizzle on top of the ice cream.

I found the batter very dry.  I was nervous about what it would turn out once baked.  Once baked there were dry spots...I even mixed it and mixed it and mixed it trying to get the moisture from the zucchini to get into all the batter rather than just folding it in.  Maybe next time I'll try adding some applesauce or an egg or two to make sure all the batter is moist before baking.  Aside from the dry spots brownies were moist and tasted very good

This was amazing! I made a double batch (one for the freezer). So much better than cake-like desserts. A keeper for sure. Made it exactly as written except for substituting nuts for chocolate chips. Even my picky eater loved them.

I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup, and the sugar to 1 cup. I also used yellow crook neck squash instead of zucchini.  Everyone loved the brownies, especially the "reduced fat and sugar", version

These brownies were a big hit with my family. I thought maybe the recipe was wrong because it does not include eggs, and the batter was very hard to mix before I folded in the shredded zucchini. Not to worry - they turned out great,  very rich and moist.

These were perfect for a birthday party with egg specific allergies. They're more cake like than brownie, but that's also just fine for a birthday party. Will use these regularly!

Followed recipe to a tee. Very similar to a recipe I have for a sheet cake with same fudgy frosting. My recipe calls for eggs and this one didn’t so I thought the reviews saying they are like brownies instead of cake might be right. Wrong! This is cake. The flavor is really good though. Probably won’t make again as I like my cake recipe better and is simpler to put together.

Pretty good recipe. It came out a bit gooey but that might be because of the way I scooped shredded zucchini with a measuring cup - perhaps I ended up using a bit more zucchini than was specified. Having said that the brownies tasted good and topped with vanilla ice cream were great. I didn't make the frosting as the brownies already had 1.5 cups of sugar and using icing on top would be waaaay too sweet even for my liking. 
Someone mentioned how their mixture was too dry. Mine was dry at first but after it stood for a few minutes the zucchini started releasing their moisture into the batter and it became more and more viscous. You could taste the "vegetable" after taste a bit.
Things I would do differently now:
Pack shredded zucchini lightly into measuring cups. Dust the hot brownies with a bit of cinnamon to help bring out more chocolate flavor. Add some chocolate chips

For using zucchini I give it 5 stars.  Has a bit of a cake texture which is fine with my family. It’s moist and rich. Will definitely make again. I added chocolate chips to mine and thinking of adding pecans, chocolate chips and coconut to the next batch.

It is amazing how this turns from something looking like a  big fail to amazing!  The first steps will absolutely look like to have missed something, but fear not, when you add the  zucchini it will all come together.  I did add a tsp. of cinnamon.  l also probably added an extra half cup to cup of zucchini because I did not want to waste it.  YUM!

For what they are, these are great! I did a small grate for the zucchini so I'm not sure if it was that using more zucchini and less "air" in my measuring cup) or the fact that I subbed out 1/2 vegetable oil for 1/4 cup avocado oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, but mine turned out a little less fudgy and slightly cake-like. Despite being very dark brown (almost burnt looking) they aren't super strong with a chocolatey flavor either. I added about 1/3 cup chocolate chips to the recipe because I love chunks in brownies. I do not taste any zucchini or "vegetable" flavor at all. Really loved these for a vegan recipe!

Amazing! Followed recipe exactly. After mixing all the ingredients, I mixed for a few more minutes because it looked dry. After a few minutes it was good and gooey. Final result tasted like a normal great brownie. I might try adding a little less oil and adding some butter, the brownies had a bit of an oily taste. I also put them in muffin tins instead and cooked for a little longer.

Okay I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but following this as is results in a VERY DRY batter. It is easily fixable though. I added 1/2 cup of cold coffee and baked for 25 minutes at the stated temp and they came out perfectly cake-like.

Wow, this was the weirdest batter I have ever used.  I was very concerned when I initially added the dry to the wet ingredients. The dough was so crumbly. Put I forged onward and added the zucchini, which helped a lot. I was still nervous because I had to mix in the zucchini more than I would have liked, in order to distribute the moistness throughout the batter. Also, I had to press the batter in the pan, not spread it. I was worried it would be overworked but the end product was deliciously chocolatey and moist.  I would describe the texture as a thin sheet cake not a brownie.  And I followed the directions exactly.  I probably will make this again for my family to use up zucchini from the garden but, in my opinion, it is not quite good enough to serve company.

This was husband approved!  I am allergic to chocolate, so I made a half recipe for my husband to go with our supper.  We have had a ton of zucchini from our garden, so I was trying to find other ways to use it other than the traditional zucchini bread and veggie casseroles.  He cut a slab and took one bite.  Then he wanted to know what was in it!  He thought they were great...he just wanted to know what I had tried to hide in those brownies! I did replace the sugar with Stevia Baking Blend to cut down on sugar...he is diabetic.  I also added just a tiny bit of milk when mixing it all up since it seemed a little dry.  They came out moist and according to my husband, delicious!  I might make another small batch and use carob powder instead of cocoa powder so I can eat them.

Only 4 stars because it’s a cake, not a brownie, but a delicious, very moist cake. I think I already rated this, after I made it once and my batter was thin, but I’ve made it twice more and it was perfect. The batter wasn’t dry, but thick like a brownie batter, I must have done something wrong or had a really juicy zucchini the first time, oh I also grated it on the regular grater instead of small these times, and that definitely helped it not be runny. I really don’t know how everyone got such dry batter.

Made as is. They were good but incredibly dense/fudgy... maybe a little too much so. Super messy (for brownies) and fell apart when lifting from the pan. Yummy, but there are better brownie recipes out there. Also: I couldn't taste the zucchini, but my bf said he could.

I did not care for these.  I made no revisions to this recipe.  First, it’s not a brownie at all; it’s a moist chocolate cake.  Second, the zucchini flavor is really overwhelming with a nasty aftertaste.

This batter is bizzar - it looks very dry like bread crumbs. When you add the zucchini it doesnt look much better. I thought for sure I forgot an ingredient. But I trusted the other users who said it would look that way and kept going. These turned out pretty amazing! It was like magic - they were most and my very picky husband said "not going to lie this are !@#$*!@ delicious!" very cool. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

SUPER good. I shredded the zucchini very fine which maybe made it too moist..I'm not sure. I cooked it for about 28 minutes and I should have given them another 5 minutes at least. They were very mushy in the middle but still really good! Will be making these again.

I rarely stray from my usual, butter and egg-filled brownie recipe, but tried this one cuz I had zucchini and the ratings were so high.  I rarely follow a recipe, but I followed this one and they're the worst brownies I've ever made.  I suppose the frosting would help, but frankly, it seems a waste to add any more ingredients to this bland batch of  dry "cake."  If people think this is good, their taste buds are missing out. I should have known when it called for baking soda instead of butter and eggs.

I followed the recipe excluding the nuts.  I used olive oil for the vegetable oil, but as far as I know that doesn't change the consistency.  Mine came out a little cake-like, but very moist and a dense cake.  Overall, everyone liked the taste.  My daughter even tried them knowing there was zucchini in them, which is probably the first time she ever tried anything zucchini.  She liked them, but did try to pick out the zucchini bits the best she could (because she unfortunately saw the recipe and knew they were in there)  I took off one star because it's not as brownie like as expected, but it's not dry at all and very good.  Maybe it's partially depends on the zucchini or how well you shred the zucchini?  I used a food processor.  The first zucchini was drier and the 2nd one had liquid in the food processor that I made sure to mix well and pour into my measuring cup.

Instead of oil i added the same amount of applesauce and baked it in an 8x8 pan. This made it more dense, the middle was less cooked and provided more of a brownie texture as a larger pan in my opinion produced more of a chocolate cake texture (still good just not a brownie). I made caramel sauce instead of icing. Excellent cake with no eggs.

Really good.  For not having eggs it’s rather cakey not fudgey.  I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup homemade  applesauce.  The mix was so dry that I had to add more applesauce so maybe that’s why my brownies were more cakey.  I’m making this again today-YUM!

I added an egg (I should have stuck to the recipe!) and turned these brownies into an amazing cake. The only problem is I wanted brownies! Next time I'll leave out the egg and they'll be perfect!

Fantastic recipe!! I saw this recipe after doing a search for zucchini and was skeptical but SO glad I tried it! I made these exactly as written and was hesitant at first when my batter was very dry. Keep mixing. The water in the zucchini will leach out creating a gooey brownie batter. I served these on two separate occasions and everyone loved them. Even my picky husband was surprised at how good they were. Guest were shocked to find out they were zucchini. Will definitely make these again. Thank you, Marian, for an amazing recipe!

This was delicious! We couldn't taste any zucchini - just pure chocolatey goodness. I followed the recipe to a T and would call it chocolate zucchini cake instead of brownies - no matter as my family loved it.  You could be "healthier" and leave off the frosting, but it so makes this dessert you should really include it. Thanks!

The taste of these was not too bad. But as a brownie, I can only justify three stars. I would have thought it was a cake recipe had I not known. In fact, my husband didn't and he thought it was cake. 

I followed the recipe exactly, except for using half apple sauce/half oil like I do for all recipes. I don't know if this makes a difference. Anyway, like people have noted, the batter is extremely dry..at first. I just kept stirring and eventually enough moisture came out to resemble a brownie batter. 

I didn't think the end result was at all dry, and I supposed the overall taste was ok, but honestly, if you have to mask the taste with frosting, why bother.

I was not blown away by the recipe.  I thought with the reviews it'd be pretty good.    It's hard to explain why I didn't quite like it.  It had a weird after taste.  It was a bit too sweet for me.  I really like zucchini bread so thought this would be great but yeah it's not a keeper for me, but it wasn't bad either.

These being exactly as described, it takes a little bit of blending to feel that the batter is wet enough but it absolutely works.  My tip  in any recipe using cocoa is to use the best cocoa you can buy.  I used a Swiss cocoa powder from my local baking supply store, since I found this miracle ingredient everything chocolate taste so much better coming from my kitchen.

I really wanted to love this recipe. I followed it exactly. Some people referred to the brownies as chewy. I would say they were spongy. Not quite like a brownie and not quite like cake. The texture was very strange and my kids didn't think they were "chocolatey" enough.

Excellent.  Don't try to make a typical batter, just put it in the pan and it works.  Man, is this delicious.

I only made slight changes, but kept the basic recipe, which I found to be fabulous!! I excluded the nuts and sprinkled mini dark chocolate chips on top, then used dark cocoa powder in the frosting. So delicious!! My mother actually has been making these for about a year now and so I know how good they are. Bravo!!

I'm with the rest of you that were apprehensive about the dryness of the batter once all incorporated.  The zucchini added the moisture it needed to make a delicious brownie.  No one would ever guess it had zucchini in it.  I sprinkle with mini chocolate chips.  That was all the frosting it needed.

The only thing I omitted was the nuts, otherwise I made it exactly to the recipe, and they did not turn out like brownies at all. I had never baked with zucchini before, so I will say that I was amazed how moist they are, but it's a cake. Not fudgy or dense at all like brownies should be, instead they turned out moist and fluffy, and not nearly as sweet or rich as I like my brownies to be. I will continue to test out baking with zucchini, but this recipe was a fail to me.

Very good! We didn't add the frosting, and still delicious. Definitely do not worry about it being so dry when mixing it. Comes out fine.

Made it exactly as written even though it went against everything in me because even after I added the zucchini it looked too dry.  It came out of the oven looking really ugly.  My only advice would be to make sure it's in the pan evenly before you bake it because it won't level out.  After adding the frosting it looked much better and it tastes amazing.

Surprisingly delicious!  My picky husband and 3 year old had absolutely no idea there was zucchini in these!! The batter was more like play-doh consistency than batter, but turned out moist. Next time I think I will add a bit more zucchini for a little more moist brownie. I may also try adding chocolate chips to the batter and omitting the icing or use a thicker icing instead of this one.

I really liked this recipe.  My only issue is is that it seemed to lack flavor.  Either that, or I'm not used to it.  I used the frosting to enhance the flavor.  However, I made a vanilla version to bring out the chocolate.  

The frosting is the real star of this recipe.  The frosting is so creamy and flavorful.  I used this frosting recipe for cakes, and my mother love it.

So, let me preface this by admitting that I have apparently lost my touch when it comes to baking. That said, I took the advice of some other reviewers and substituted unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and added the salt to the grated zucchini and let it sit while I mixed the other ingredients, and "floured" the pan with cocoa.  When I was adding the dry ingredients to the sugar/oil/applesauce/vanilla mixture, I didn't dump in the entire bowl, but added about 1/2.  At that point the mixture was quite stiff, so I decided to alternate the zucchini with the dry ingredients [as you would do with bananas for banana bread].  It worked fine. Now comes my personal challenge.  The entire time I was mixing it I was saying to myself, "Don't forget the walnuts... don't forget the walnuts".  As I was putting the pan in the oven I realized I FORGOT the walnuts. I pulled the pan out, added the walnuts and mixed them in gently. Put the pan back in the oven, set the timer, and began to clean up the ingredients. That's when I noticed the baking soda...sigh...rather than having brownie BRICKS, I thought "it's only been in the oven for less than 2 minutes...." Once again, out came the pan... I dumped the warm batter back in the bowl, sprinkled in the baking soda, mixed it well... washed and re-greased and floured the pan [this time with flour], poured in the batter and baked it for about 26 minutes.  I waited impatiently for them to cool enough to sample. When I did I found that, though

These were very moist.  I was hoping for a fudgy brownie, but they were more cake-like.  Very good, but not quite as good as traditional brownies.  The trick to get the batter to come out right is to stir for a LONG time - as more and more moisture comes out of the zucchini, the batter will gradually come together.  Keep on stirring until all of the batter is moistened.

By the way, these are NOT healthy.  They contain an enormous amount of sugar.  Enjoy these as a treat, not health food.

This was GREAT!!  It was moist  and not cake like.  My husband said he liked this better than my zucchini bread and I think I make a mean zucchini bread. I will make sure that I have enough frozen zucchini so I will be able to make this recipe thru the winter.

I add the zucchini chunks (about 3-4 cups of big chunks), oil/applesauce, vanilla, salt and baking soda (plus 1/2 tsp cinnamon) to a blender and blend smooth and then add to the flour, cocoa, sugar mix. I like to add in about 1/2 cup chocolate chips rather than nuts. Then, when fresh out of the oven and still warm, I dump the rest of the bag of chocolate chips on top and wait for them to melt and spread into an easy frosting. Yes, they are more cake-like (even without an egg), but they are very moist, and no one can believe there is zucchini in them and have been asked for the recipe.

WHOAAAAAA!!!!!!!?? My first time making zucchini brownies!!! I made them for family beach day, and they were an epic success!!! My 17 and 11 year old nephews went bonkers over them! My husband, my sister and myself can't stop eating them! They are DANGEROUSLY delicious!!!! I LOVE the fact that they have no egg and lots and lots of zucchini and the biggest part I love, is that the kids had NO IDEA!!! I used avocado oil instead of vegetable oil and for the frosting, I used coconut oil instead of butter/margarine. I added mini chocolate chips on top of the icing. My husband said "these tasted like chocolate and coconut delightfulness!" These will be a total mainstay in my baking habit!!!

These are amazing!  We substituted applesauce for half the oil required and they turned out great. Also added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips based on another review. The batter was extremely dry but not after you added the zucchini.

I made this recipe to a tee, the only exception being the frosting. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. These were the first zucchini brownies I've had and they were just ok. They were fudgy and I loved the consistency, but the taste just didn't fully satisfy. I could definitely taste the zucchini. It wasn't overwhelming, but it was there. I didn't tell my husband what was them, he couldn't pick out the taste but he did say they were 'weird'. I'm not sure I will make this again.

These brownies turned out exactly like the recipe, but could have used additional1/2 cup of grated zucchini to make it even moister!  It was a bit hit at the girls' cards night !!

This recipe is our go-to brownie recipe. The only change we make is that we use 1/4 cup cold brew coffee instead of milk for the frosting. If you're a coffee lover, you must try this!

If the batter is dry,let the batter sit for 5-10minutes and the zucchini will release the moisture into the batter.

Loved this Recipe! Easy to assemble and quick to bake!
I baked mine a little longer to have a more cake like feel but if I pulled them at the 25 minute mark they would have been nice and gooey! 
Like some other reviews have mentioned the mix before you add the zucchini was very dry and crumbly. It was nice to have read that before hand and would be worth mentioning in the recipe as I'm sure many folks are expecting a typical brownie batter.  Once the zucchini was added and mixed in a bit the moisture appeared but it was also a stiff  dough and still not a batter. It spread out perfectly in the pan.  

I did not make the frosting as these are destined for morning breakfast goodies and i wanted to pull back some on the sugar! Though they were fantastic without! 

Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! When it goes in the pan, it will be a crumbly, almost streussel-like consistency. The moisture comes out of the zucchini during cooking. If you're worried about your kids noticing, they won't.

I made a double batch recently, but forgot to make sure I had enough zucchini. I didn't so shredded some carrot and apple and was just as pleased with the result as I have been when it was all zucchini.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It came out more like a cake than a fudgy brownie. Flavor was so-so. Will not make again.

Took a friends recommendation and cut down on the sugar by a bit, used apple sauce instead of oil and added extra handful of zucchini. Great veggie sneak for kids.

You can lump me in the "modified it" category - partially out of necessity and partially on account of - OOPS. After shredding and measuring my zucchini, I only had 1 cup instead of 2. My options were to go back to the market for more zucchini on super bowl Sunday (NO THANK YOU) or to cut the entire recipe in half... halfsies it is! Other modifications I made: sunflower oil instead of canola oil, all-purpose gluten-free flour instead of regular flour, no walnuts, I added semi-sweet chocolate chips, and I skipped the frosting (it was sweet enough without it). My batter was very moist like typical brownie batter. I used a square pan and adjusted the temp/time for high altitude. VOILA! The consistency is more along the lines of cake/fudge as others have mentioned, but -- it's homemade, it's a *slightly* healthier version of a brownie, and it's YUMMY! Definitely a keeper in my book!

Made no changes except to leave out the frosting, they were plenty great without. I made them in a mini muffin pan, they were fudgy, dense and just  the right size.

Amazing! Replaced most of the oil with applesauce and added chocolate chips and pecans. I only wish it wasn't as cake like and instead had a denser chewy consistency, but I'm just happy with how tasty they are for being a healthier brownie. (I did not add an egg). My zucchini was very watery. I wonder if it would be less cake like if I had drained the excess water?

My dad is a chocoholic, but he's also not very good and sticking to his dietary needs like his veggies.  Made these for him and he had no idea there was any zucchini in them and they tasted outstanding.

I really thought I had set myself up for failure when I dumped the dough into the pan und had to press down on it with my fingers. I think my zucchini was kinda dry (I had only made these brownies because I needed to get rid of the zucchini) and I had used coconut oil instead of your usual vegetable oil. So imagine my surprise when I tasted the brownie fresh out of the oven and it was simply delicious, moist and fudgy. So delicious in fact, I ate a whole row... Oops! I'm not even going to bother with the frosting, they're that good on their own. From now on, this will be my go-to brownie recipe.

First of all, I never rate anything... But this recipe was too good to not share my review!!! I followed the recipe exactly (minus the nuts) and it came out soo moist. The only thing I may add next time to make these a little more chocolately is some chocolate chips!!!! I did not add the icing which also could of gave it more sweetness. This is definitely my NEW go to brownie recipe!!!

Delicious and fudgey.  The brownies themselves are not too sweet, the frosting gives it that extra bit.  I made as directed but omitted the nuts.  I would make these again, great way to use up zucchini from the garden.

We have a diabetic in the family and so instead of 1 1/2 c sugar, I used 3/4 c monk fruit (our favorite other sweetener). That was the only change I made to the brownies. For the frosting, I just put ghiradeli 65% chocolate chips on the brownies fresh out of the oven, let them melt, and spread them around. Lots less sugar there, too. They were dessert for 5 and everyone loved them. We will definitely have these again.

These were amazing. I made sure to mix the zucchini in a bit to get the liquid into the batter to help pour it into the pan. Baked for 30 minutes. When you add the cocoa to the butter for the frosting it was not liquid but once you put that with the confectionary sugar part you can whisk it into spreadable consistency

This is the only zucchini brownies that I have ever baked that turn out like brownies. We love them. I sometimes put a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips inside and 1/2 cup chocolate chips sprinkled on top before baking and skip the frosting. Easy and delicious.

I made this recipe just as written and it did turn out like a very moist and delicious chocolate cake. I think the difference between the people who say it is a fudgy brownie and those who say it is more of a cake consistency may be due to the difference in zucchini.  I would have to believe that small store bought zucchini differ in moisture content from larger, juicier garden zucchini.  Mine was a zucchini the size of your forearm straight from the garden and my recipe was more cake like. 
In either case my family thought it was fantastic.  Didn't use the chocolate frosting but it was great with a little whipped cream or light glaze. Wonderful recipe. Thank you.

Really enjoyed these brownies as did my family. I  followed the recipe to a T.  I  grated one medium sized  zucchini and it looked like it might've been over 2 cups but I didn't measure, just put it all in.  Figured the extra moisture wouldn't hurt since it was so dry looking. I didn't add nuts just because I didn't have any. Didn't make any frosting because honestly, I'm just lazy.  This is my first time making brownies from scratch and it won't be my last.  Again, I'm lazy, so I usually make Betty Crocker brownie box mix but this was worth the extra time and effort. It was not too sweet like the box mixes usually are and it was light and fluffy. Knowing that I was eating zucchini made me feel less guilty about indulging  in these yummy treats.

I made exactly as written.  My reaction was "ugh" before frosted.  The frosting makes a difference, but not enough to wow me.  Also, they were more cake-like than I expected.  If you are trying to use up all that zucchini, and need a fast dessert, it fills the bill.  Also, use a plastic knife for clean cuts.

I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. Used  3/4 cup honey instead of sugar. May add raisins. Oscar loves them...not too sweet. Make in 8x11 pan. I didn’t put any icing on them.

I made these yesterday and they are amazing! They're now my favourite brownies. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, I made it as written. They turned out moist and delicious. I didn't, however, make the icing because I had no powdered sugar. They didn't need even need it. The whole family loved them, I will be making these again!

It's OK.  Don't know if I'll make it again.  The "batter" was more like a bowl of powdery dry ingredients (didn't squeeze moisture out of zucchini and pretty much packed the cups) to the point that I just couldn't bake it as it was so I added a bit more than 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  At least then I could press the dough into the baking dish.  Had a smaller dish, so baked it at 325 for not quite 35 min.  Texture is dense but I wish it were more chocolatey.  Frosting is OK -- prefer the taste of my own Cooked Fudge Icing as opposed to just leaving everything raw.  Tastes cake-mix-ey somehow.  But still good enough to share!

Followed recipe and didn't believe this chocolate coated zucchini would be edible.  It is excellent and I will definitely use it to make more to freeze for the winter.

Halfway through mixing this recipe, when I realized that there was no egg in the batter, I was mad that I tried this recipe.  And then when I saw the batter after all of the ingredients were added, I was even more mad!  But, I was halfway done, so I decided to finish adding the ingredients and bake it.  Well, my son had three pieces before supper and my husband had two!    I went from thinking this recipe will never work to my husband saying that this cake is reason enough to grow zucchini!!  It was really fantastic and definitely worth getting mad over.  Haha!!  I did add 3/4 cup of chocolate chips to the recipe.

These are amazing. The reason people are having trouble with it being too dry is they are  not grating the zucchini fine enough. I put them through my Bosch fine grate on the food processor  and the batter pours into the pans like a brownie batter.

SO GOOD. Honestly the best brownies I have ever made. Tastes BETTER than other brownies I have made - "normal" brownies. I've also made other zucchini recipes that have been just "alright " - but this is really perfect. Following the recipe, is perfect. Make sure you don't drain the zucchini of course, that is what adds moisture!

I ALSO ADDED PEANUT BUTTER CHIPS, made it delicious - like Reese's :)

Love them! Batter is dry until you add the zucchini, but have faith! Just trust the recipe as written...it's amazing! Also, the chocolate frosting is the best chocolate frosting I've made from scratch--rich and smooth. When cutting/serving the brownies, they seem cakey...but once you take a bite, it's fudgey  and delicious. I'm impressed!

Love this one, always have friends and family asking for this recipe. Don't be surprised when you mix everything and it looks like it is not moist enough, the moisture from the zucchini during the cooking process makes them very moist when they are done. Hardest part is walking by the dish and not picking one up and devouring it.

Absolutely perfect as written.  The batter looks weird, but the results are DELICIOUS!!!  Do not change a thing!  Be sure that you DO NOT press the water out of your zucchini.  If the brownies are dry, then your zucchini is not good or you pressed the moisture out.  
A few notes:  I have used coconut oil, olive oil, and peanut oil at different times with equally great results.  I used butter in the icing because I just refuse to use margarine for anything.  There really is NOT any egg, so don't think it is an error.  If you want cake, try a different recipe!  :)  ENJOY

Great recipe. I allowed the zucchini to sweat, about 45 minutes, before adding it to the batter, so that it was wet and pourable. I wanted to make this vegan, so I skipped the margarine and used vegan milk and called it chocolate sauce. By itself, you could tell the brownie was "healthy," it was much better after you served it with ice cream or the chocolate sauce. I would make it again with my changes.

Awesome recipe. I find them to be more cake like than I had hoped, though it may be because of how moist my zucchini was. It was still lots of fun to make.

These were great! My husband told me they were the best brownies I ever made.  The batter was very dry at first, I was worried because it was still powdery, since I had zucchini bread in the oven I just let it sit for a little bit and let the zucchini "juice".  By the time the bread was done the batter was perfect.

My kids LOVE this recipe (and don't realize there is zucchini in it!), but I sub in Better Batter Gluten Free flour. I follow the recipe exactly, minus the nuts, and it turns out great. The "batter" is very dry though and makes you wonder if you messed something up, but it's fine. The moisture comes from the zucchini. Family favorite recipe!

I followed the recipe  except I didn't use nuts and instead used M&Ms.   Also, skipped the frosting because, well, who wants to wait for it to cool to apply frosting?  the kids wanted to scoop it up with ice cream right away.  The texture was a little bit  cakey, but it was pretty good, a nice way to use up zucchini.

My brownies actually turned out really dry. Like the top was still crumbly/sugary. However the inside was INSANELY good and fudgey. After reading comments I think my problem was that my zucchini was too dry and didn't add the moisture this recipe required. And I can't knock the recipe for my own mistake. So I'll definitely try this recipe again, making sure I get some good moisture from the zucchini next time because that's all it needed (no egg)

I am glad that I read the reviews so I knew what to expect.  The batter is very, very thick - not at all like cake mix batter or even regular brownie mix batter.  I pressed it into the pan since it does not flow.  the brownies are moist, moist, moist!  don't be fooled by the dryness of the batter.  The zucchini releases moisture as it cooks.  And like other brownies, they are even better the next day.  I have made this recipe twice (two days in a row since the first batch went to a pot luck and the family complained) and both times they were great.  I did not put walnuts in the first time but did the second time.  I think they should be optional.

Really glad I read the other reviews.  Batter is more a crumble than a batter, but are the finished brownies delicious.  Moist and fudgy.

UPDATE - I ran short of zucchini (who does that), so added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Turned out a little more cakelike, but still very moist and delicious!

UPDATE - Two things: (1) These freeze beautifully when wrapped in foil. A nice midwinter treat! (2) i've discovered the more you stir these, the more cakelike they become.

I followed directions exactly, and got a delicious cake-like, light and airy brownie. So yummy! And the kids loved them as well. Always nice to sneak veggies in wherever you can! The frosting was great as well.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Consensus from the family is it's more like cake than brownies. A bit of Cool Whip on top is what we used as opposed to the frosting.

I doubled the recipe to make it more cake like and I substituted olive oil for the veg oil. But I found doubling the icing was too much, and too sweet. So when I make it now, I double the brownie recipe, but keep the icing the same. Works great. :)

Don't get hung up on how dry the batter is before baking; it will come together as the zucchini "melts" into the flour.  My gripe is that 1 tsp is too salty.  I will cut back to at least 3/4 tsp when I make these again.  On a high note, they were rich without being like fudge, and light without being cake-like.

I made this twice and both times it turned out like slightly dense cake.I will play with the recipe and see if I can get more fudge like brownies. I'm going to try making these in a jelly roll pan rather than a cake pan and reduce the bake time.

OK. First things first... I was looking for a recipe to alter to fit my  needs. This one worked great!  I needed to use up an abundance of garden zucchini. I also needed it to be gluten free and dairy free and as healthy as possible.  I also doubled the recipe. I subbed the AP flour for gluten free flour blend, I subbed vegetable oil for coconut oil (just healthier, it melts at 76° and my kitchen was warm) I ommitted the baking soda by accident but it wasn't missed.   I  followed directions for blending oil/sugar/vanilla, combined gluten free flour with cocoa powder, but did not add the salt! I added the salt to the grated zucchini (that was packed full to measure and NOT drained!).  Added the walnuts. Did not make the frosting, didn't miss it. I put the whole double batch on a greased/floured jelly roll pan and baked 30 minutes slightly under baked. Turned out great.  Their texture is ever so slightly spongybut,  I'm pretty sure that's due to the zucchini, but it may be the gluten free flour blend too. It doesn't have a crumb like normal brownies, but again I'm not missing it. Great gluten free, dairy free, egg free brownies!

This is a really good recipe and a nice way to use extra zucchini. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out  well.  Next time I'll use a fine shred on my zucchini, though. My husband  couldn't tell the difference between this and my regular brownie recipe. It's a keeper. ??

I was so worried by the dryness of the "batter" that I stopped to reread some of the reviews to make sure I had the recipe right.  While I was reading, the zucchini must have released enough moisture that it actually was a "batter."  It turned out very well, moist and chocolatey.  Everyone liked it.

This is definitely one of those recipes I am glad I read the first ten reviews on. This batter is not at all like your typical brownie batter. You do kind of have to press it into the pan. And oh my goodness the appearance of it when it first comes out of the oven is just gross looking. I even sent my husband a message telling him these brownies just don't appear promising. However, once you spread the icing on and put them in the fridge and let them cool even more, they look great. And the taste? Fabulous! There's just no way there's zucchini in them! All four of my kids ate them and had no idea those brownies were packed full of our garden zucchini! 
After the reviews were read, here is what I know about baking these fantastic brownies: 

1. The batter is dry. Do not add egg. It definitely would've screwed it up. Just keep going and your results will prove your doubts wrong. 

2. Definitely add the icing. One person said it didn't need it. It does. I'm sure they would've been okay without the icing but the appearance is much prettier with icing. 

3. If you have a ninja or vitamix, grate your zucchini in it! I have a vitamix and cut my zucchini into 2 inch cubes and stuck them in there on number 4 and chopped them up for zucchini bread and zucchini cake after I already did this brownie recipe. That would've helped the batter be not so dry and would've came out even better.

Delicious nice fudge like brownie. I threw all fear to the curb and rolled with the recipe as is. Wonderful recipe. I made sure no excess flour was in the pan after prepping the pan. If folks are having dry issues, it would make me wonder if they may have to much flour in the pan after prep. Either way, wonderful recipe. I am happy with it.

This recipe did not use  anything to moisten it.  I added 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water and made it the consistency of a boxed mix.  Did you leave out an egg, water, or milk by mistake?

I didn't make frosting.  The brownies are good-I've made them before-came out  very moist. Cooked them the full 30 minutes.  Don't hold together well when they first came out-I couldn't wait to try!  On reflection--now that they've cooled--I don't think 30 minutes was quite enough.

So good. I let the zucchini sit while I mixed the other ingredients together and when I mixed the zucchini into the batter it looked just like a cake batter. Not dry at all. The frosting is to die for. I seriously had to stop eating it plain. I definitely will make this again.

it's good, but does taste more like choco cake than fudgy brownies.  
I cut back the sugar to only 1 c, as using sweeten cocoa powder; and subbed apple sauce for the oil. 
the batter is very dry, but once you add the zucchini, it loosens up.
very moist and healthier version, but not quite the brownies I was hoping for.

My brother who rarely fixes anything just made this and it was delicious. It was very moist. He did make slight changes. He used  about 3 cups of zucchini and reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was just right for our taste. However, the frosting which was made exactly as the in recipe was too sweet. Think it would have been perfectly fine without the frosting. I can see this being a favorite at family get togethers.

Absolutely the best and most moist brownies I have ever had. Not a brownie fan in general. Love these.

I don't ever make the frosting, sweet enough without it.  My family of 4 will eat a whole pan in a day if I'd let them, and my husband doesn't want me to make any other kind of brownies ever!  My kids don't have any clue that these brownies are a "healthy" version of one of their favorite treats!

This is very yummy and moist.  To make it (a little bit) healthier for the family, I substituted  1/2 cup applesauce for the oil.  In addition, I only used 1 cup of sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cups), and replaced 1 cup of white flour  for 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  To have double chocolate brownies, I also added 1/2 cup of Semi-Sweet chocolate chips.  My kids love it and can't stop eating it!

We add even more zucchini to this and the recipe can handle it. Kids ask for this every summer.

These are very moist, chewy. I followed the recipe exactly and they are awesome. I feel adding the walnuts may have hidden the zucchini taste, but I seriously didn't taste the zucchini in the batter I tasted. The batter IS dry. But as the recipe states, you combine the sugar and oil first, then add the other dry ingredients to it gradually. Incorporating the dry ingredients with the oil/sugar works well. Break up all the lumps and dry bits. Adding the zucchini last a bit at a time helps. I processed the zucchini in my Vitamix and let it sit while I did the rest of the recipe. The liquid weeps out, keep that and include it in the brownies. It will be enough liquid as it cooks. The batter is very thick and had to be spread into the 9x13 pan. The zucchini is what makes them so moist. NO EGG is needed. They are cake like, at least mine looked that way. But when you bite into it, it has the fudgey chewiness. So, try these like they are written. It's awesome the way it is. If you add egg or use applesauce instead of oil, you get a different recipe. They would probably still be good, but not the same. Also, the frosting was good, but I felt like it was too much sugar for my tastebuds. I added double the coco powder to balance the chocolate flavor with the sweetness for my liking. Definitely make these. They're awesome!!! Thank you for the recipe.

We added some melted butter and a bit more zucchini because the batter looked so dry. Turned out delicious, but this is definitely a cake brownie.

These brownies turned out well.  I baked it for about 35 minutes though, so it would be done in the center.  Kids loved them!

Delicious!  My oldest son hates squash of any kind but he loved these. I have also made with yellow squash with the same excellent results. These are some of the moistest, chocolatiest brownies I have ever made. You'll think you've forgotten something while you're mixing because it is so dry, but it will be fine once the squash cooks and releases it's moisture.

Great recipe! Glad I read the other reviews first because when you first make it the batter looks very dry and a bit crumbly, but the zucchini has so much moisture, it absorbs into the batter as it bakes and the result are fabulous, moist brownies. I did use stevia instead of regular sugar and I didn't add the frosting and it still turned out great.

The recipe kind of tricked me because I was thinking it was going to be dry but as putting in the zuchinni it made it not that way.  Just curious about the frosting it seemed runny but wonder if  it had to set for a bit.  Yes, the frosting did set much better.

The brownies taste yummy.  I will make these again.

Not overly impressed. The 'batter' is not batter. It is dry and crumbly. You have to pack it into the pan.  The brownies when they're done look dry and crumbly, with loose sugar still on top, while the inside is nice and moist. I don't think I will make them again.

Have made this recipe several times and it's always a hit.  Most times I've followed the recipe exactly, and on a couple of occasions I've substituted chopped dried cherries for the nuts and called them "Chocolate Covered Cherry Brownies."  Either way, absolutely delicious.   My son, who doesn't eat zucchini, will only eat brownies "if it's the one with the zucchini.'

Made exact to recipe. Very moist and sweet.  I feel it is leaning more towards a cake than a brownie, easier to eat with a fork than just pick up and go.  Next time I will only make half of the frosting (I am not a frosting person) and try replacing the oil with applesauce.

Excellent! I did make changes due to the dry batter. I added an egg and more oil. The brownies were very chocolaty and not cake-like at all. I also added 1 more tablespoon of cocoa powder which added to the richness. Loved that the zucchini wasn't visible--I also shredded the zucchini like many other reviewers did. I used chopped pecans for nuts. Didn't feel they needed frosting, but maybe next time I'll try that!

Oh Lord!  These are amazing!  So moist and almost fudge like. With 2 cups of zucchini I can almost call them healthy!! This might be obvious to others but I learned the hard way...the cake must be completely cooled before frosting AND wait to make the frosting until you are ready to frost it otherwise it will not spread nicely.

The batter was the texture of sand. I thought it would come together after baking, but it came out the same texture. You cannot even eat it because it is like eating powder.

Love the recipe!!  Get rave reviews and requests for the recipe a lot.  Modified recipe a little.  Zucchini is peeled and deseeded then shredded.  I do not add nuts unless I use the frosting and then sprinkle it on top.  I do not make the frosting.  Instead I sprinkle chocolate chips on top before baking. This is a cake like consistency.  Yum!

I was a bit suspicious of the author's recommendation to not the drain the zucchini. I think the big difference is how finely you grate the zucchini. I used the finest setting on my hand grater which turns the zucchini into wet mush. I placed it in a strainer to drain and kept the liquid as recommended. I added the zucchini and then just used enough liquid to make it wet. Turned out beautifully moist and delicious. I watched the video which shows it grated on the largest setting which probably produces less moisture but there were large noticeable pieces of vegetable in the batter.  My way they were unnoticeable.

These were very chocolaty, but definitely resembled cake rather than brownies. The only changes to the recipe I made were to cut the amount of sugar in half, and I skipped the frosting.

Zucchini makes any baking moist. The pan hardly lasted the day in our house.

I used fresh zucchini from the garden. The more I mixed the batter the more it became gooey. It spread in the dish and was easy to spread out. What a great recipe. Definite hit! Great way to use up some extra zucchini!!

I found that the batter was very dry (even after adding the zuchinni) so I added about 2 tblsp of cream and it turned out great! :)

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was not really batter, pressed it into the pan.  There were still "dry" spots on the top of the brownies when I pulled them out from cooking.

Would not make these again

These are my favorite brownies - zucchini or otherwise! My picky kids love them too. It's the best of everything...delicious brownies with guilt reduced by the presence of vegetables and it uses up my abundance of homegrown zucchini. Love the idea of applesauce instead of oil!

We were worried at first before we folded in the zucchini that it would be too dry. But the batter got nice and moist after we added it. These brownies are SO GOOD. Resist the urge to add any extra oil or eggs. My son thinks using zucchini in brownies is very creative!

I did not get as good of results as other reviewers had. My brownies turned out a little dry. Next time, I will shred the zucchini finer. I did a medium shred. I am teaching my granddaughter to cook. I am sure our measurements were not exact. She did the measuring. I thought this would be a good recipe to try, since she is allergic to eggs and could eat this. The zucchini was a plus. I will give it another try.

I followed recipe exactly except for exchanging walnuts for chocolate chips.  Batter appears on the dry side but moistens up as it cooks due to zucchini releasing liquid.  It turned out very good and delicious, however this is a delicious, vegan, zucchini chocolate cake recip.  These are not brownies.

Perfect!  I was looking for a recipe to sneak veggies into my kids and chose this hoping the chocolate would hide the green--and it did!  Even upon inspection, you'd never know this recipe had zucchini in it!  I used the grate attachment on my food processor to shred the zuc and then also chopped it even finer with the blade attachment.  I also found that it was more like chocolate cake than brownies and needed the frosting, but that is not a complaint; it was delicious exactly as written!  The best part:  my kids loved it.  Thank you!

These are delicious just as made. The batter is alarmingly dry until you fold in the zucchini, but they turn out perfectly rich and fudgy.

Turned into a a very moist cake, but not brownies. It is one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever made.  Frosting was fantastic too.  I added an extra cup zucchini, 1/2 cup apple sauce and an extra 1/4 cocoa to recipe.  I will make it again!

If you make this recipe as directed they turn out perfect and moist. It will not be dry and you do not need to add eggs. They are moist and delicious! Also do not drain the moisture out of the zucchini, grate or shred it correctly it will be like liquid, not stringy. You cannot even taste the zucchini. These are always a hit and so easy to make. To make it even easier I skip the frosting and just spreaching chocolate chips on the top before baking. The more the better!

Hands down the best brownies ever! No egg needed. Followed recipe almost exactly.  I did increase sugar to two cups and added a cup of milk chocolate chips and walnuts to the batter.  
One other tip: I processed the zucchini until it was almost a liquid state. I think this helped eliminate any veggie "after-taste".
These brownies are moist, fudgy and simply divine.  Be warned these are very addictive.

I read the reviews and was prepared for the batter to be dry and crumbly. To get around this, I used my hands to mix everything together and the zucchini gave it the wetness it needed. The batter didn't taste too bad. After baking 30 minutes when the tops would spring back when touched, I removed them and let them cool. The bars turned to moist crumbs as I tried to cut through. These taste very odd and the zucchini does not really melt into the batter like it does in bread. It was just a gooey mess.

We enjoy most things zucchini but this wasn't one of them. I drained my zucchini in a colander then squeezed out the excess moisture and still I couldn't get the middle to set well even after extended time in the oven.  This one just didn't work for us.

I peeled the zucchini, scooped out the seeds, and shredded what was left.  When I mixed the dry ingredients with the sugar, oil and vanilla, it looked very, very dry.  But when I put the grated zucchini in, and stirred it a bit, it magically became like batter! (Don't drain the zucchini or squeeze the moisture out...the batter needs it!)  I did throw about half a cup of mini chocolate chips in because the cocoa I had was kind of cheap, came from Aldi's.  But the brownies are FANTASTIC.  Very moist and delicious!  Home run!

Delicious. Actually made twice; the first time hand mixed and it was dry the 2nd time used Kitchen-aid mixer, and much better. Very moist, fudgey and delicious. Good way to get the veggies in the little ones. I would recommend you give it a try.

I followed the recipe exactly how it was written and it turned out more like cake.  I am curious if it was because of the zucchini.  I would like to make it again with a more fresh zucchini to see if that was my issue.  Although it was cake-like it was still delicious!  I will make it again.

Excellent recipe.  I always use just a little less sugar.  I used butter instead of margarine in the frosting and poured it on the brownies while they were still warm.  These have a wonderful rich chocolate flavor.  I'm glad I have lots of zucchini in my garden.  I love your recipe Marian.

I've made this recipe several times. I'm being generous giving it 4 stars, mainly because it does use up surplus zucchini. But, a few things...this is essentially the Wacky Cake-that one that doesn't use eggs or milk-only instead of water you use zucchini!  It is helpful to mix the zucchini with the oil sugar mixture thus giving you a good liquid to stir the dry ingredients into. I've had good success with using some whole grain. But this "brownie" cannot make it without frosting, so it kind of fails my stand alone test for brownies.  I would not go out of my way to buy zucchini to try this recipe, but if the neighbor leaves some on your door step, by all means...

I have never written a review on a recipe before but these were amazing! I have been growing zucchini for years and can honestly say this is the best zucchini brownie recipe I have ever made. I omitted nuts because of allergies and didn't bother with frosting-- no need these brownies are moist and delicious as is.

AAAAmazing!  I was so pleased with these brownies, my family loved these.  My daughter was initially disturbed, believeing that I had perhaps "ruined" the brownies...she soon apologized and asked for more!

So chocolaty and rich, these are perfect when you are in some serious need of chocolate. I am saving that chocolate frosting recipe to use on other desserts as well. It is thick and tastes like the frosting from a can but much better because it is home made. My husband was so skeptical to try these because he does not like zucchini but once he tried them he loved them and admitted he could not tell at all that there was zucchini. I used the small grater so that the zucchini was not in big shreds. My sister is picky on the brownies that she likes and she said these were the best she has ever had. This recipe is easy too and earns all 5 stars!

I will note that I followed this recipe EXACTLY! It IS super good, however, mine also was more cake-y than fudgy. which is fine and was still very good. I just expected them to be more fudgy than cakey especially without adding any eggs. I am always looking for ways to sneak veggies to my picky daughter and this was the perfect solution for a yummy treat while getting her to eat some veggies. Thanks. LOVED them

This is now my go to brownie recipe. Fudgy, chewy delicious. The first time I made these the "batter" was somewhat dry and the brownies came out of the oven "dryish" but tasty. After cooling and frosting I put the pan in the fridge overnight. The next day they were so good. Tonight was my second try and this was the charm. This time a grated my zucchini (two heaping cups) and put it in a bowl to sweat for an hour or so. I added the squash and it's liquid to the mixing bowl and this time the batter was more moist. Still not a true pourable batter but no big deal. I watched the baking time very closely and baked for 25 minutes. The brownies came out of the oven so moist and tender that I skipped the frosting and just dusted with powdered sugar. Since I used about a 1/4 cup less sugar in the recipe and didn't frost I figured this would be ok, and it surely was. Family says thumbs up!

Tasted like a chocolate muffin--chewy and delicious. I liked it without frosting. I used half oil half applesauce. I liked that I didn't have to squeeze zucchini. Just shred and use!

I followed this recipe to the letter and I thought it was very good!  It turned out very fudgy and chocolatey.  The only minor issue I had was that it was too sweet.  I might cut back the sugar the next time I make them.  My son ate them and didn't even know they had zucchini in them!  The batter was very, very dry looking.  Adding the zucchini helped put a little moisture into the batter before baking, but it does add the right amount of liquid when it bakes so do NOT add liquid or eggs.  I added the icing to disguise the bits of zucchini, but otherwise I would have left it off they were that good.

I don't know if I had really dry zucchini or something but there was nowhere NEAR enough liquid in this recipe. This came out more like a stiff dough than a batter when i followed the recipe to the letter. I had to alter it so much it bore little resemblance to the original.

This is the first recipe I've ever rated on this site. I had to rate this because it was so good and I didn't think it would be. It was very moist and the frosting was delicious. Everyone who ate it had no idea there was zucchini in it and I'll never tell. If you're looking for a way to use zucchinis in an unusual way, try this recipe.

These brownies are fabulous!  Love zucchini bread so knew these had to be great.  One thing I did is to cut back on the sugar (just because I always do on any baking I do) I only used about a scant cup. And I did not have any dry cocoa powder so I melted about 2 oz. of unsweetened baking chocolate and it worked nicely.  And because the brownies I made were not very sweet...I topped them with a can of cherry pie filling and it was delish! Thanks for this recipe...will be making these again and again!  Irelynnsgrandma

Good flavor and my family really liked the frosting, but it was more like cake than brownies. The only difference I can think of is that I used frozen zucchini, and it might have been a little more than 2 cups, or had a little too much liquid. I didn't re-measure it and I probably should have. Still a good way to use up garden zucchini!

I was skeptical when I was making these, the mixture was pretty much powder when I put it in the oven but turned out great. They were much better the second day.

Perfect! I'm a nursing mother to a milk protein intolerant baby, so this recipe is perfect. I just use almond milk and vegetable butter in the frosting. Truly love this recipe. My nephews 4&6, LOVE these and couldn't tell there was zucchini in them, which they loved the idea of after I told them. I didn't change anything to the recipe, and they were perfectly fudgy, but like other reviews, depending on how fine you grate your zucchini, the batter will be super thick the larger the gate used. Obviously the water will come out faster with a smaller grate. It's easier to work with the batter if you use the smaller grate. Thank you!

I am not impressed. Mine turned out very oily, though I followed the recipe exactly. I could definitely taste the zucchini, and not just because i knew it was there. Not a keeper, in my opinion.

Very delicious brownies.

I am SO glad I read other's reviews before I attempted these! The batter starts out so dry and crumbly I probably would have given up and tossed everything away. I actually used my hand to mix all of the dry ingredients together, then added my zucchini at the end. I too used half brown sugar and half white. I also halved the amount of oil, making the other half apple sauce to make it a bit less fattening.
 My final result was a delicious brownie/cake. I used a cream cheese icing found on this site to top it off. I will make again.

Awesome!  I reduced the sugar to scant 1 cup,  used half whole wheat flour, and subbed half applesauce for the oil.  I also upped the finely grated zucchini to about 3 cups, letting the batter sit a few minutes to moisten.  No frosting necessary!

LOVED IT! Great Recipe! Very moist brownies, the best I had in a long time. Going to serve it with some Breyer's Vanilla Ice Cream tonight after dinner. The only tweak that I did, like I do all my recipes when they call for SUGAR. I always put in less amount than they call for. Other than that definitely thee best, moist brownies, will be making this recipe again for sure!

I have made this recipe several times and it is excellent!  I add 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, or 3/4 cup mini-chocolate chips together with 3/4 cup dried cranberries.  For my own family I add (1) cup of rough chopped walnuts. (We have friends with an allergy to nuts and on that occasion I omit the nuts.)  I also make a butter cream chocolate frosting to top it off.  YUM!

I, like many other reviewers, was surprised by how dry the batter was. I initially used 1 cup of shredded zucchini and 1 cup of shredded yellow squash (ran out of zucchini), but because the batter didn't seem wet enough to incorporate all of the dry ingredients, I added another cup of yellow squash. The texture ended up perfectly moist for a cake, not dense like a brownie (probably due to adding the extra moisture). I was surprised that it wasn't very sweet and chocolatey though. In fact, it was so bland, I knew it couldn't stand alone. I didn't love the idea of chocolate frosting, so I made some German chocolate cake frosting and that made a great difference. But for a zucchini chocolate cake I prefer Chocolate Zucchini Cake III from this site.

Made these for game day. They were easy to make. Gooey, chewy, and rich in taste. I will make them again. :-)

This was a yummy recipe that I will make again!  They turned out a bit dry, I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, not sure if that is why...the frosting made up for it though.

My kids said they were exactly like the big fudgey  cake on the movie Matilda. 
Left out nuts, added mini chocolate chips .  They were a gooey, chocolatey dream.

It's true the moisture comes from the zucchini when it's all cooking. Do not change a thing and it will work out oh so yummy. Yummy, fudgey brownies that can easily be made vegan just by using vegan butter. That's what I did and it was fantastic!!

Loved it! I am so glad that I read the previous reviews. I took the advice of not adding an egg, which I thought that the batter look like it needed. Great advice! My kids and I both loved them. I did add half a bag of chocolate chips over top of the brownies.  I will be making these again :-) I did make the frosting, but it was not needed at all. Would be delicious both ways!

Followed the recipe exactly and these were not brownies but cake. They did not turn out fudgy. Just depends on how you like your brownies but next time I'd just make a cake.

I used 3 zucchinis and halved the recipe and I loved the way it turned out. May be too gooey with that many zucchinis for some people however.

I made this recipe as written and another batch with applesauce instead of oil and added an egg.  I would recommend following this recipe and not adding an egg as it seemed to make the brownies tougher. I will add chocolate chips to the batter in the future and not frost them.

These were wonderful! But..I have a bad habit of always just having to change recipes just a little!  That's what happens when you've cooked with Mom 50 years...she just used a little of this, a handful of that. Anyways, the only thing I changed was adding about 2T of egg beaters. And the frosting!!  I usually don't like choc frosting or frost my brownies, but it gave this a try. I used SmartBalance stick butter. It turned out so tasty & so creamy!! And there's plenty. Right now I'm baking my 2nd batch, but using yellow squash since my brother gave me a whole bag full. I'll let u know how they turned out. They are cooling right now & look beautiful!!

I love these. I have to admit i wasn't sure if i did it right because the batter was so dry but i checked other reviews and became more confident that they were made correctly. Was soooo happy with the results! Yummy! and the frosting is awesome. Good way to use up all that end-of-summer zucchini.

I have to say, I too was skeptical about the dryness of some reviewers, so I decided to add 2 more heaping tablespoons of zucchini, and that resulted into a cakey brownie.  No...I didn't add an egg.  Therefore reviewing based on the taste and have to say for it having zucchini, I'm super surprised and how awesome yummy it is. I don't think my co-workers will know when I let them sample. 
Since I have a bountiful of zucchini, I'll have to remake the recipe to a T. I will have to update the following time without the added zucchini.  Thank you for a moist fudgy veggie treat!

Very good recipe, very moist, would give it 4.5 if I could.  I followed the recipe exactly, and like other reviewers was surprised at how crumbly the dry mix was.  Make very sure that you mix the dry ingredients very well before adding the zucchini, because if there is a vein of salt or baking soda that you didn't mix in before adding the zucchini you will not have much opportunity to mix it in.  The only thing I changed is that I didn't use as much icing, as I think the full amount would be too much.  Not a typically dense brownie, will not be dry unless you overbake it or use frozen zucchini (never use frozen zucchini).

Made these and followed the exact directions, except for subbing applesauce for 1/2 the oil. And I used canned milk chocolate frosting to save time.  They are delicious!!!!  I offered them to a group of neighborhood kids, ages 3-7 and they devoured them and asked for 2nds! Great way to sneak some veggies into their diet without them even knowing it! I will be making these again!

Absolutely delicious!!!! I made this recipe exactly as the instructions stated. No changes were necessary. Mine were done in 20 minutes, rather than 25 or 30. They were a little soft at first, but once cooled, they were perfect! Super moist, super rich, chocolatey goodness! I have a 4 and a 6 year old who despise vegetables, and they LOVED these! Will definitely be making them again!

These were really great brownies. I made it as per the recipe except for no nuts and they were delicious. The mixture was very dry, but I was prepared for this as per other reviews and stuck with it. I had to use my hands to mix the batter as it was so stiff but it turned out fantastic in the end and I have had lots of requests for more...

Would definitely make again! Very moist. Used Hershey cocoa, would be interesting to try with Dutch processed cocoa. Didn't make the frosting, just sprinkled chocolate chips on top, but definitely sweet enough without the frosting or chocolate chips.

I have made this recipe numerous times. It is the first thing I make when my zucchini come in. No one can tell that they have zucchini in them. They are rich and moist. Just a note: The batter on this recipe is thick and fudge like, even after the zucchini is added. Don't think that it is dry or ruined.

Oh boy. Awesome. The only change I made was to use melted coconut oil over vegetable, and I did find them mildly cakey but much helped but the frosting. For a scratch brownie recipe it definitely holds up! Will make again!

I tried this recipe.  As first I thought I had did something wrong because I was creating a double batch and it was so dry, but I had not added the zucchini yet.  That did the trick.  I didn't use the frosting, instead I sprinkled the top with White Chocolate Chips ad more chopped walnuts.  Wonderful.

I puréed the zucchini and it came out very moist. Almost cake like, but still delicious!

Delicious! I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out beautifully. No one can believe there is zucchini in this recipe, especially my nineteen-year-old, who won't touch any type of squash with a ten-foot pole. I will definitely make these again.

Fantastic. I feel it is a cross between cake & brownie. For chocoholics it is the best! I doubled the amount of nuts though! Made it even better.

Followed directions exactly, and they turned out cake like. That is a good thing in this house, we all like them that way. They have a very nice flavor and texture.

Love these!! I have family w. a severe dairy allergy so I make these (w/o the frosting) for parties so they can have dessert too. I need to stop using my fine grater to shred to zucchini b/c it makes the batter too wet & results in a cakier texture than I prefer. Next time I'll use my food processor grater attachment for more fudge like brownies. I did make the frosting once & it was amazing! Very rich chocolate flavor. I used real butter & almond milk - great texture & flavor!

You are going to love these brownies, if you like a moist brownie.  Women you follow the recipe - the mixture is quite dry.  But they bake up moist & good!!!   Really a good frosting also. :-)

Before I made this I read all the bad reviews. Expecting a horrible dry result I made it anyway. It was sublime. So I thought about what could go wrong.
1) dry climate
2)old or poor quality ingredients (try farm/garden fresh zucchini and high quality cocoa powder)
3) stop adding eggs, they aren't needed.
4) try again it may have been user error.
But # 1 can have a huge result so if you live in a desert maybe let the zucchini sweat or add a little more. Don't check doneness with a toothpick. The bounce test works well and undercook if possible. There are no eggs so slight gooiness is not harmful.

I loved these and the twenty people at the BBQ I took them to agreed as they disappeared quickly.

I did it without the egg. It would be great but I didn't cook it long enough. Looked ok, but the center was not done. :( Edges were great. Frosting was amazing. Very rich. Will try it again.

I actually really enjoyed this recipe.  I read a lot of the reviews before making these and decided you need a really moist zucchini for this recipe.  Mine came out perfectly and were very moist.  This is not a fudgy brownie. I gave some of the brownies to my uncle who doesn't like zucchini.  He loved them!! My husband said he preferred them without the icing.  The kids all ate them and loved them as well.

Delicious!  I gave these to my nephew and my stepson, neither of whom eat any vegetables to speak of.  They both thought they were wonderful and had no idea there were veggies in them.  Will definitely make these again.  May try applesauce instead of the oil next time.

These are fabulous!!! The icing came out runny for me, but that was probably user error. So, I used the runny icing as more of a glaze for the top and kept them in the fridge. They were AWESOME. I'm not sure I can ever go back to boxed. 

PS, I accidently used baking powder instead of baking soda the first time and they were much fudgier. I sprinkled sea salt on the top of those which was terrific. No nuts either because we have allergies. When I used baking soda the second time I made them, they were cakier, but I liked them even more! I also know from using zucchini in a lot of other dishes that some are wetter than others which I'm sure can also make a difference. None the less, I'm sold on these babies!

Delicious!  Moist, fudgy, decadent.  I used summer squash in place of zucchini and it was an equally good replacement.

I loved this recipe!  I did change a few things to make it a bit healthier - although it is already not too bad!  I used three cups of zucchini instead of two, I used 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt in place of the vegetable oil, and I swapped the walnuts for about a cup of raisins, although I think both would be great in this.

Just made this for a party tomorrow. I was a bit worried since they didn't pour at all,  had to glop it in the pan and spread around. They are so moist! I followed a reviewer's suggestion and grated the zucchini fine. You would never know there's zucchini in there. Will definitely make again. Followed the recipe exactly.

I added some chocolate chips. These turned out amazing. If your zucchini is very moist I would definitely bake them the full time. I baked 27-minutes, should have left a few more minutes, but they are great anyway.

I followed this recipe exactly, but I omitted the walnuts. These brownies are really moist and delicious! 
When I made the frosting it was a bit runny so I added more sugar until it was a good consistency. These brownies are so good they don't even need the frosting they are good all on their own!

These were hard to mix and, I thought, would turn into a failure; however, they are very tasty!  I think the problem with the dryness is related to how big your zucchini is.  The large ones that we get from our gardens this time of year don't have the moisture of the smaller ones.  I reduced the sugar to one cup and didn't put on the frosting, just because I'm not a frosting fan (don't tell my husband it's supposed to have frosting!)  I'll try a fat substitute next time, and there will be a next time!  Later:  Tried apple sauce, and it worked great!

I chopped the shredded zucchini so my veggie-phobe husband couldn't "feel" it in there. This is the BEST scratch-made brownie recipe I have made. The texture is a little crumbly but it's due to being light and fluffy instead of dense but is still moist. I added a half cup of chocolate chips instead of nuts to add more chocolate flavor. I did not frost it.

I must not have had zucchini that was wet enough because I ended up with the same results as magnoliakng.  They were dry and nowhere near like any brownies I've ever had or made.  I might try it again another time since I like the concept of adding veggies but for now I need something that I can whip up and be done with.

It turned out good, but tasted like cake. I read some rates before making it, some saying it doesn't taste like cake if you don't add the eggs, so I didn't. But still tasted like cake.

The first time that I made these brownies I found them to be dry. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't put on the frosting. The second time I made them I put on the frosting and they were fantastic. Thus, either the zucchini was dry the first time around or the frosting makes a difference. I gave them 3 stars the first time around. I've updated that rating to 5 stars.

This recipe is good, however I made a few changes to make it great. First off, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, I used 1 cup of cocoa powder, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of instant coffee grinds, 2 tablespoons of milk and mixed in a full bag of chocolate chips to the batter. I also only cooked it for 22 minutes, and then let it sit for about 30 minutes so it can settle. If you overcook it, it will become dry. These are moist and perfect. Kids had no clue there was zucchini in it.

I made them using a cupcake pan with wrappers because I didn't care to monkey around cutting apart brownies and trying to make them all the same size. I also didn't feel like putting any effort into washing a pan. Anyway, they actually came out like cupcakes in consistency, which I hadn't expected. I'm unsure if they would have come out more brownie like had I baked them in a pan and I don't particularly care to try because they were REALLY good as cupcakes. I also substituted applesauce for over half of the vegetable oil, so maybe that was it? I tested them out on my neighbors and got rave reviews.

Very tasty.  I made these as muffins, some with cup liners and some without.  The ones with liners were too moist.  But they all disappeared quickly.

Wow! Who would think? Kids gobbled them down and then I Told them about the zucchini which they thought was hysterical! really good, no changes, my frosting was slightly runny even though I let it all cool first. So I threw the whole thing in the fridge for a bit to firm up. YUM! A KEEPER!

I followed this recipe exactly (except no walnuts - allergy) and I was pleased with the results. Yes, the batter was dry but after I added the zucchini it came together nicely. Finished product was tasty, although I could see the zucchini in the brownies - didn't bother me, but it didn't dissolve for me like it has for other reviewers. Also, I thought the taste was more like a chocolate muffin. Overall, the brownies were easy to make, tasty and fudgey.

I modified by adding one egg and an extra 1/4 c. of cocoa powder (to keep them from getting too cakey and I like em nice and dark). I also used some cocoa to flour the pans.  I used coconut oil since I don't have much cooking oil and used half white whole wheat flour. I baked a little longer than 30 min. (put them back in because they were too gooey in the center).  We like them un-frosted but I will be putting some on them for my daughter's class so we can put red sprinkles on top for Valentine's day.  Mildly sweet and fudgy.

I used a little less than one cup of sugar and used applesauce instead of the oil. I made them bite size by baking them in mini muffin pans. Really great thanks for the recipe! Follow me on Instagram at ahcoutry

These are delicious, but I wouldn't classify them as brownies. With the frosting, they taste more like a Texas sheet cake. I used zucchini from my garden that I had shredded in 2 cup portion sizes, then vacuumed packed and froze. Used the thawed bag with all the liquid. Will definitely make these again.

i made it a little healthier.  i used 1/2 unbleached white flour, 1/4 whole wheat flour, and 1/4 almond flour.  i only put 1/2 cup brown sugar (that's sweet enough for me and my family).  i shredded the zucchini very fine, so, you can't see it in the brownies.  in the frosting, i also used 1/2 cup maple/agave and used oil instead of margarine.  the brownies came out delicious!  the frosting added a lot (and were healthier than usual).  yum!

I thought it was really good, but before the brownies had a few hours to rest, I definitely tasted the zucchini. Four hours later all I tasted was yummyness. I also doubled the icing because I thought it was more of a glaze and made it sweeter. Finally for color and texture and to up the fun factor, I topped it with milk and white chocolate chips. Will make again.

Amazing! We love brownies in our house and for a while I was making brainy brownies which were great only because my husband and I didn't go near them! I was looking for ways to use up zucchini from the garden as I'm the only one that likes z. bread. Anyway, these brownies are amazing, moist and totally decadent. There is no taste or texture from the zucchini, I think it just moistens the brownie considerably. I've made it several times and I would say this is between a cake and a chewy brownie, not super dense but super moist. Not sure how some people get a dry brownie out of this. It doesn't seem possible!

I was totally ready to give this a lower rating.  Wasn't fond of the thick, dry batter (and I didn't even add the nuts), but I love the idea of zucchini in desserts, so I finshed the batch.  Mine baked much slower tho, at least 45 minutes!  I LOVE them, and will make them again.  Co-workers raved, even after finding out about the secret ingredient!  I used my go-to fudge frosting from the site, "brownie frosting" - super simple, works every time.  Thanks for this one, I'll be visiting again & again!

I was extremely skeptical because the batter was incredibly dry, but I followed the recipe almost exactly as it is and the results were perfect. The only things I did differently was that I used a gluten free flour blend (2 parts sweet sorghum flour, 2 parts tapioca flour, 1 part millet flour with about 1/4 t xantham gum) in place of all-purpose flour, and I used almond milk and Earth Balance in the frosting.

Great lowfat recipe!   I used an oil that is a mix of canola, olive and soy, and Tuvia baking sugar (3/4c as a replacement of actual sugar).  I shredded 2 zucchini which was about 2.5 cups.  The mix starts out very powdery.  I was thinking this was not going work out.   With a wooden spoon I finally mixed or moistened all ingredients.  It is thick, not a pourable batter.  I spread the blob of batter out in the 9x13 and baked for 30 min.  Turned out perfect, really good.

I liked these but was the only one in the house.  The texure was not quite brownie like which is my favorite part of the brownie.  I shredded the zucchini with a cheese grater but it REALLY should have been put into the food processor until finely chopped or maybe even liquified.  I plan to try them again and see if I didn't mess up the texture somehow.

I can see where other people found this recipe to be dry.  You really have to wait a bit for the flour to soak up the moisture from the zucchini.  If you use the right butter and milk this recipe is also vegan.  Awesome!

The brownies were very good, however a bit crumbly.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys deep dark chocolate flavor.  You would never know that there is zucchini in the recipe.

The best part of this recipe is the frosting, it is so yummy.  The cake part is just ok.  I won't make again because the flavor is subpar.

I RARELY rate recipes, but this brought me out of my cacoon. Like others, I tried this as an experiment, not expecting anything even half edible. Oh my, what a surprise, and honestly the only time my homemade brownies were worth writing about or even making again! Delectible, with Giardelli bittersweet chchs. and walnuts.

Very good! My family ate the whole pan! I didn't use the icing part of this recipe, mostly because I was being lazy...I just melted chocolate chips on top once it came out of the oven and my family loved it that way.

These are great.  I usually add more zucchini, but other than that I just follow the recipe.  When I'm lazy a can of frosting works just as well.

I followed the recipe exactly and the brownie was delicious and quite moist.  I used "picked that day" zucchini and it was very moist. I only gave four stars because the frosting made things too sweet. Making them without the frosting next time.

I liked this just fine.  I followed the recipe to the T except for the baking time...I had to add 7 minutes. 
I gave this 3 stars because my family did not like this brownie and now I have to eat it myself because I like.  I cut them up and wrapped them individually so I can freeze and eat later.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I used coconut oil and it did NOT turn out at all. It was dry and crumbly, even after baking and I ended up having to throw it out. On the second attempt, I used olive oil and let the mixture stand a few minutes after adding the zucchini. This seemed to help with the dryness and allowed the moisture to incorporate into the mixture. They were perfect and the frosting recipe will be the one I use for everything. Excellent! I will definately make these again!

Even after being told there was zucchini in them my children still begged for more! They are scary when you put them in the pan, it truly is still a crumbly mixture but while they bake magic happens! Try this you will love them!

These are amazing!  I was seriously skeptical considering how little moisture is in these, but they were incredible.  Wonderful comfort food that is sorely needed in flooded out Colorado right now.  This is now our new favorite brownie recipe and a great way to use excess zucchini.  Trust me - don't add any extra moisture, these will turn out so much better than you think they will when you're mixing.

I must have done something wrong here! I'm usually a big fan of these kind of recipes but mine came out poorly. The brownie was very doughy tasting and granular. I loved the frosting! I think I'll move on to try another recipe and wont use this one again.

I have (had) a standard brownie recipe that always got rave reviews. But this is amazing. No veggie aftertaste that I can detect. My seven-year-old's jaw dropped when I told her there was zucchini in this recipe! I too wondered about the apparent dryness of the batter without egg but the egg is not necessary and would probably alter the texture. The zucchini works its magic as it bakes. Walnuts and a few chocolate chips thrown in, and you are in brownie heaven.  I did find the icing to be a tiny bit sloppy so next time I'll decrease the amount of milk or something. Thank you.

These brownies were incredible!!!!! To those who changed it, then gave it a bad review, that was your fault, not the recipe! Yes, this is very very dry when mixed up, however zucchini sweats when cooked, making these the most perfect textured brownies I have ever made!!!!!

Nice, moist, chocolatity brownie – just what I was looking for.  The batter for this was very dry and I was worried as I was putting in the pan, but it baked up nicely.  I added the walnuts to half the pan and left the other half without.  The frosting is very good on this recipe and worth repeating just to lick the bowl again!  Nice way to sneak vegetables in to your dessert. I will be making this again, before the zucchini season is over.

I followed the recipe without adding nuts and the brownies turned out sickly dry. Really dissapointed. I think that maybe my zucchini may have been a little older and maybe not has moist? Not sure, but won't be making them again :(

I wanted to make a brownie recipe and I got CAKE. I followed this recipe precisely and there is nothing brownie like but the taste. Even the topping was what you would put on a cake, no one thought these were brownies.
The only thing I can think of is that I should not have added the liquid from the zucchini after shredding it, but since there were no instructions saying to do other wise, I did not know. 
For taste I gave it one extra star, it was still good, but since it was no where near being brownie like, I am not giving it a good review.

My new favorite!  I prepared as recipe states except I didn't add nuts. Some reviewers had noted the batter was very dry- this was not so in my case. It was like normal brownie batter- thicker than cake batter, but still able to pour into the pan with some assistance from a spoon. I think this occurred for 2 reasons: #1, I used (part of) a large zucchini, rather than a few small ones. Thus, the majority of the zucchini in the batter was the pulp, which is where the moisture will be found, rather than the skin. #2, I really packed it in, with the back of a spoon, much like you would pack brown sugar, to make sure I had 2 full cups. The result was delicious- thick and fudgy. Some reviewers noted the brownies were more "cake like." I suppose this could be true in the sense that they are not as oily as brownies typically are. I guess I would say, if you are going to compare it to a cake, it would be a really dense, moist cake... which is basically what a brownie is!!! The only problem I had, and will do differently in the future, is to bake it as recommended in a 9x13 pan. I baked it in a 9x9 square because we like really thick brownies. But I never got the center to completely bake. I had to cut out one edge to expose it, and then put it back in the oven. My mistake; I assumed like with regular brownie recipes, you could put it in a smaller pan and simply cook for longer. But had I baked any longer, the edges would have dried out as they were already done.

My frosting turned out slightly runny. But I live up at altitude so I thought maybe that had something to do with it. Does anybody have an idea how to make it thicker? My brownies are also cake-like. The batter was definitely dry like it was suppose to be until I added the zucchini. They're just real fluffy, delicious, but fluffy.

I can't believe I waited so long to try these delicious brownies! They didn't last 24 hours at my house. I always reduce sugar by half and swap applesauce for oil - always. So moist and sweet and yummy! I'll never buy mix again.

Great recipe! I thought I had really messed it up (my batter was thick and lumpy) but I went ahead and baked it...........they were FABULOUS! I used some applesauce in place of some of the oil, and the brownies turned out very fudgy... thanks for a great recipe!

Super delish recipe. The cake/brownie is wonderful all on its own, but I must say the icing makes it heavenly. With the icing, decadent dessert. Might as well heap some vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup on it. Without icing, relatively healthy snack-style cake. HUGE difference in calories! ;) I do cut the sugar down by one half cup, and use both applesauce and oil in this recipe.

First shredded zucchini coarse but it stayed that way after cooked, so I tried shredding fine and brownie was too doughy.

These are so flavorful, moist and just a little fluffy. I left the frosting off to cut out even more calories, and they taste amazing plain. I'll be making this when I need my chocolate fix!

This is DELICIOUS!!!!  I took this on a group camping trip and it disappeared rapidly.  You have to make this at least once.  It did look dry when I first started mixing it, but the zucchini got it moist enough that it all mixed nicely.  I will definitely make this again.

Amazing! Don't drain the zucchini. Frost while warm if you'd like it to be extra moist. I've never made it with the walnuts, and it's still great. To me, it's more rich moist cake than a chewy brownie. Awesome that the cake is vegan, and still one of the best scratch chocolate cakes ever. The dairy in the frosting can be replaced with vegan substitutes.

I liked this recipe and surprisingly so did my kids. I would have liked it better if I had pureed the zucchini rather than shredding it. I think that would have made the consistency a little more...consistent. Also, next time I will add more cocoa as well.  For those of you who try to do things a little more healthy, I substituted whole wheat pastry flour and raw sugar without a problem.

This recipe is awesome. Incredibly moist and a lot of flavor.  I did add two eggs to the recipe and increased the amount of zucchini to avoid some of the issues other reviewers had with dryness.  I like nuts, so I will double the amount next time.

I just made this exactly as written.  mixed oil, sugar and vanilla first, then added flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt. folded in zucchini.  I noticed it was crumbly and dry but didn't worry based on other reviews which was to be expected.  baked for 25 minutes. it came out almost the same as when I put it in.  dry and crumble. it didn't melt altogether into a piece and most definitely not fudgy.  when I cut into it, it crumbled apart.  more like brownie crumb toppings.  what did I do wrong?  it does tastes okay, but what happened?

Made it exactly as directed and they are really, really good.  Hubby who dislikes carrot cake or anything green for that matter had no idea zucchini was in here and he loved them.  They are very moist, dark chocolate,  fudge like brownies.  I could not see any of the zucchini in the brownies after they were baked.  I grated my zucchini first before doing anything else and by the time I added it, it made a thick but moist batter.  I will make these again.  Frosting is equally good.

WOW!!!  Make these!  Everyone loved them!  

I made them GF using a cake blend I make.  Next time I will grate the zucchini finer.  I did not make the frosting but instead a chocolate glaze that I pour over my Texas Sheet Cake.  I will be making these again!  The batter looks very unusual and I was a little hesitant about the fact there are no eggs but they were super moist and totally brownie like. 

LOVED them.  Thank you for sharing.

I loved this recipe even with my healthy changes! I substituted applesauce for the oil, used about a 1/3 cup less sugar and used whole wheat flour and they turned out amazing! Still super moist and fudge like. My 4 year loved them and still ate them after asking what the green things were. Although I did take the advice of one reviewer which is to almost puree the zucchini. Also I did not make the frosting and still loved them.

These are great--didn't change a thing (except didn't add the nuts).  Extremely moist despite only using 1/2 cup oil and the zucchini.

I've made this recipe twice and followed the instructions  & ingredients exactly, and absolutely loved them! They did not come out dry and all, and no one could tell there was a hint of zucchini in it. My first batch did come out more cakey, but I think it may have been because I baked them too long.  I followed one person's suggestion on my second batch and pureed the zucchini, but it did not make much of a difference. Both times were equally tasty!

Really great recipe. I doubled it for my family of 12. I also mixed the zucchini with applesauce before I added it to the recipe. This gave the brownies the extra moisture needed. I have bookmarked the page and will make them again for sure.

Made this exactly as it is written, but sprinkled powdered sugar on top instead of frosting. It is very moist, and has that wonderful chocolate taste! We eat a lot of brownies here, and this recipe is a big thumbs up!

I could not taste the zucchini!  I could see it, but couldn't taste it.  These were even better the second day for me.  And I loved the frosting!  At first I did some without, but the frosting was so good I was eating it from the bowl.  I followed the recipe exact, but I didn't use a 9x13, I put half in a pie dish and half in muffin cups for single serve brownies (cooked 20 min). Glad I tried this recipe!

I was hoping the zucchini would moisten these up especially after reading the reviews, but not nearly enough to be yummy. I threw it out - way too dry!! This recipe needs a bit more moisture.

I used 1/2 whole wheat flour; you'd never know it.
I didn't frost them, but I served them with whipped cream on each brownie.  I used summer squash instead of zucchini, and I happily froze grated squash from the bumper crop to make more.  Much yummier than any zucchini bread in my opinion.

Wow, these were AMAZING!!!! I was skeptical when I first got the ingredients together and saw how dry it was--just keep stirring for a minute: the juice from the zucchini comes out and the batter ends up perfect. The brownies are perfect, I honestly cannot think of any way to improve these. I loathe frosting so I cannot comment on how good the frosting recipe is but the brownies are divine. Try them, don't change the recipe at all, you won't be disappointed.

Really good for what they were.. I still like brownies from a box more, but these were tasty.. not quite cake but not quite brownie.   I did not squeeze the zucchini at all first.  The brownies went in the pan a crumbly mess but came out the right texture.  I think if you skip the salt this won't turn out right.. it draws out some of the water from the zucchini.

Made this exactly as published minus the nuts, since I don't like nuts in my brownies.  They were awesome. Moist, fudgy, chewy - exactly like a brownie should be.  You do have to mix quite a bit after you add the zucchini to get the right consistency batter.  Love them and would definitely make again.

Well it was definitely more like a cake than brownies, the "cake" was amazing though!! Big hit at the party we went to. I made a ganache instead of the frosting recipe. No veggie flavor at all, very moist.  Tasted identical to a lava cake, I'd give it 5 stars for "cake" but not brownie texture.  Also when making this it says 2 cups of zucchini, mine was very dry and powdery still so I ending up adding more like 3.5 cups of zucchini to get batter consistency. I will keep this as a cake recipe for sure!

Delicious!  A little cake-like but it was like a fudgy cake, so really good!  I substituted 1/2 of the oil with applesauce and used 1 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar.  My zucchini was really juicy so I had to cook a little longer (probably about 37 minutes).

These stayed nice and moist, if you follow the directions exactly.  They were pretty good but I found I could easily eat only one and not crave more, which is not typical for me.  Can't really say exactly what was off.  The frosting was too sweet for me, but the brownie without the frosting was lacking.  If I make these again I will do a chocolate cream cheese frosting instead.  One tip I have for frosted brownies is after frosting the pan full, put them in the freezer for 10 minutes or so. This makes them cut beautifully.

This was one of the best brownie recipes I have came across YUMMY! Don't be alarmed about the batter being dry as others have stated the zucchini adds the moisture, just press in the pan you won't be disappointed.  We are dark chocolate fans so I substituted dark cocoa and added 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips and left off the frosting.  A yummy way to use up all that extra zucchini!

Really moist. One of the best brownie recipes I have tried. Frosting is a little tap too sweet.

I followed the recipe exactly, and mine came out like a chocolate cake, but a wonderful chocolate cake!!  My husband and son had no clue there was zucchini even in it.  My zucchini was really watery when I shredded it, and I may have baked it to long, that could have made it more cake like. But it really didn't matter to us, the taste was great!

These are delicious! My husband was even amazed and my 5 year old son loved them. I followed the recipe exactly. Mine turned out kind of cake like. But they were moist and we couldn't even tell there was zucchini in it.

These were good brownies, but I felt they needed some chocolate chips dropped in the batter for a chunkier texture and will try that next time. I was worried with how dry the batter was, but they baked to be very moist!  I did sub out most of the oil for applesauce and used half sugar & half Splenda.

Wonderful! I doubted it at first , but once I threw in the zucchini it was all just fine!  The icing was a little bit too sweet for me, but the flavor was right on. Great use of the zucchini and liked how it used no eggs.

This is a delicious brownie recipe. I did not tell my husband there was zucchini in the brownie until after he raved how good they were. Then I shared the secret. Now he wants me to make some for work and share the recipe. When he requests that, I know a recipe is a hit!

The first couple of times I made this recipe, the brownies turned out perfect! This time, I think because it is later in the zucchini season, my batter was too dry. I added a little applesauce to moisten it up and the brownies are excellent. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very very great recipe followed everything exactly except for adding nuts and it turned out excellent! I used cream cheese icing instead... I can't handle too much chocolate and don't worry if it seems too thick and powdery the zucchinis retained water will make it moist in the baking process!

Not a huge brownie fan, but these were fantastic. I did however make a few changes. We don't use vegetable oil, not a fan of the flavor, so I used coconut oil. I like cake like brownies so I did add an egg.  It took a little longer to bake but they were moist and delicious.  Next time I will leave the egg out , my husband likes his brownies on the fudgier side. Great recipe. And what a fabulous way to use zucchini. My neighbor gave me the idea and your recipe and I really thought it was a crazy idea at first!

We really enjoyed these! Completely fooled my 5 year old, so I'd say that's a win. The only changes I made were to skip the walnuts and frosting, though I did add chocolate chips to the batter because that's how we like our brownies.

My kids actually like zucchini after tasting this.  Everyone I've made these for absolutely loves them.  Feel free to add a little extra zucchini if you like. They still turn out great!  I use the dark chocolate coco powder.  Also....I use butter, never margarine!

I don't usually rate/review a recipe unless  I am real happy or real disappointed  in it. This recipe was alright but I don't know how it can be called a "brownie". I followed the recipe,spot~on, and it tasted like a regular ol'  chocolate sheet cake. Wont  make it again,a lot of effort that tasted like a ringer for Duncan Hines....

Perfect for families with food allergies!!! These brownies are fantastic!! We have allergies and it is so hard to find a good brownie that does not require eggs. This is it!! I used King Arthur's Gluten free all purpose flour instead of wheat flour.
In the icing I used coconut oil instead of magarine and Rice Milk instead of regular milk. They are super moist and fabulous. 
Before you add the shredded zucchini, you will think the batter is very dry. After you add the zucchini and continue to stir the batter, the moisture from the zucchini gets into the batter and you end up with perfect, thick brownie batter.

Reduced baking soda to 1.25 tsp to make it extra dense. Icing makes it very rich but tasty. Grate the zucchini fine for better texture - I did coarse and it's okay but you can tell there's bits in the cake part.

These are very good. I followed the recipe exactly the only minor changes is I reduced the oil by 10ml and sugar by about 5g, replaced the nuts with chocolate chips, semi pureed the zucchini and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1cup white. I also baked in a 9 inch round cake pan as that is all I had. I sadly under baked the brownies but the outside part tastes amazing. I have stuck it in the fridge hoping it will be more solid by the morning. If not I have mini "lava" cakes :) WIll definitely make again and also try some different variations to reduce the calories and fat. YUMMY!!!

Wonderful brownies!  I make these vegan and gluten free, so there are a few modifications, but the rest of the recipe I keep the same.  I use 1/2 ground oat flour 1/2 Bob's Red Mill g/f all purpose flour, organic cane sugar, and coconut oil.  Make sure to follow another posters advice in letting your zucchini sweat before mixing.  I also turn up the heat to 375 in the last 10 minutes to get them a little crisper..we have a gas convection, so your's might not need it.  Hope you ejoy them as much as we have!

Very good.... I found it helpful that when I added the zucchini, I kneaded the mixture with my hands like you would knead bread dough.  I also used the "special dark" baking cocoa for a deeper chocolate flavor.  Next time I make them, I will chop the zucchini finer- I used up some shredded stuff I had frozen from this summer!

These are definately worth making! I will say I double checked the other ratings right before I mixed my ingredients because I didn't see egg. I thought someone forgot it! Anyhow I did let the batter sit for a few minutes and the liquid came out of the zucchini a bit and made it easier to mix-i cooked it exactly 24 minutes and it seems not totally cooked but it was. Very Nice. I will keep for my extra garden zucchini this summer!

so moist and delicious. will definitely make these again. i followed the recipe exactly, except cut out the vanilla extract (i can't have this ingredient due to a corn allergy). i stored them in my freezer after a few days, or else i would have ate them all. i bet they would taste good frozen with vanilla ice cream.

This wasn't a brownie...it was a cake. I followed the recipe EXACTLY minus adding the frosting. ( I don't like frosted brownies) and it came out way too fluffy and didn't really resemble a brownie at all. The flavor wasn't bad and I couldn't taste the zucchini at all. Definitely not a sweet brownie but still decent flavor. I bake all the time and I have never had a brownie turn out so cakey.

This is my all-time FAVORITE brownie recipe ever!  I make them several times a week during the summer, and have shared this recipe with friends more than any other.  I even substitute half the butter with yogurt, and do all wheat flour, and they still turn out decadent!  THANK YOU Marian!!

Really dry when I put them in the pan.  I kept checking the recipe to see if I missed something.  But, I let them bake until they were springy to the touch and they were perfect!

I made a big batch of these, again, last night.  MY daughter wanted to take some to her step-sister, who is a vegan.  I realized that the brownies, without the frosting, are totally vegan! If someone wanted frosting, they could easily substitute soy or almond milk.  I'd like to see this listed with vegan recipes, with a note about substitutions for the milk in the frosting.

For those who posted that they followed the recipe but came out with something dry, I have a few ideas about what might have happened. If the shreds of zucchini are too big, the abundant water in them might not come out of it in time to mix with the dry ingredients.  Smaller shreds would probably work better, or you could finely chop the zucchini in a food processor.  Or, add the salt to the zucchini and let it stand for a few minutes before adding other ingredients. The salt will pull the moisture out of the cells.

Another thing might be the zucchini you are using. Very large zucchinis, and sometimes smaller ones that haven't been grown with adequate water, should have the seeds and the pulp from the center removed. Removing the skin with a regular potato peeler is a good idea, too. Tough skin takes up space in a measuring cup, without adding needed moisture.  If you want to use the skin and seeds for extra fiber, use a little more zucchini or add a tablespoon or two of water.

OMG!!! We LOVED LOVED LOVED these brownies. The batter is very very dry I had to add extra oil because I had shredded a bunch of zucchini and waited awhile to use it all up so it was too dry for the recipe but next time I will shred it while making the brownies.

These were soooo good.  I took them to a potluck at work. Nobody could believe they had zucchini in them.  Didn't change anything in the recipe but may try cutting down on the oil and using some applesauce next time to cut down on the fat.

Surprisingly moist since batter was so dry.  Doesn't need an egg so I was skeptical but they turned out even though mine fell apart a little.  I did add 1 cup chocolate chips instead of nuts.  They were not as sweet themselves as I expected but the frosting alleviates that.  A great recipe for zucchini!  Unlike some breads you will not know there is any in this!

Did not make the frosting because I'm not a fan of frosting with brownies (too much extra sugar) but the recipe is delicious as is, even without the frosting. Used 3 zucchini, pureed in the food processor and there was plenty of moisture from the zucchini. The brownie was very moist and seemed to become more moist the next day. The batch is almost all gone after 3 days with 3 people devouring it. I'd be interested to try substituting applesauce for some of the oil to cut down on fat and also adding in espresso or coffee to give it a different flavor but that will be in the next batch.

Great flavor. I would suggest to bake for longer, maybe 35 minutes. Center brownies were way too gooey. The frosting is also VERY rich. I could have done without it.

WOW!  I need more zucchini so I can make more of these fabulous brownies! 'Nuf said.  Batter has to be patted into pan, but like others have said, the zucchini sheds it's moisture while baking making them very moist.

This has become my go-to brownie recipe.  My non-baking/cooking 16 year old son even makes these for himself!  I usually try to cut down on sugar in recipes, but since we don't frost these we use all that it calls for (or even a pinch more).

As written they are delicious, more cakey than fudgey but still really good. As a treat for the kids I make them a bit more healthy with white whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of oil. Must leave the nuts out due to allergy but I do throw in some mini chocolate chips and then they don't need frosting. This way is more of a "snack cake" but the kids love them and they are pretty healthy too.

delicious.... Mine turned out a little more like cake than brownies, but I think that was from too much moisture in the zucchini.  Either way they were good, and I will make them again.

I made these according to the recipe. They were ok, not as chewy as the type of brownie that I love, but for having no eggs the recipe was quite nice.

EXCELLENT!  These are the best brownies I've ever had.  In fact, they are more like a very moist cake.

I had a bumper crop of zucchini this summer, so I have made several batches of these brownies, and everyone I give them to LOVES them.  In fact, I have shared your recipe with a couple of people.  

These brownies freeze very well, too, so if you have a lot of zucchini and can double the recipe, I would recommend doing that.  

Such a tasty treat!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Wonderful, so moist! No veggie after taste that we would tell.  I will try a different frosting next time though, this one came out a bit thin for my taste.  Awesome brownies though!

I followed the recipe exactly and mine turned out very cake-like as well. They still were good, but I'm a big fan of fudgy brownies. The frosting was spectacular and easy! I'll be using that recipe again for sure!!

I was skeptical that this recipe would disappoint in taste. I am happy to say I was wrong. These brownies are super-moist and really chocolatey. I made them a second time with half oil and half applesauce to try a lower fat version and they did not get spongy like many recipes do with the applesauce. (Oh also I omitted the nuts because I am allergic.) This will be a staple at my house from now on. How else can you get your chocolate fix AND a serving of veggies at the same time? :) p.s. I did not bother with the frosting-they really don't need any!

I just made of batch, but I used 1 cup flour and 1 cup whole wheat and they came out GREAT, very moist. I didn't make the frosting, the brownies are great without the frosting. You'll never know there is no egg and made with zucchini.

These weren't terrible, but I don't think I would make them again. I followed the recipe exactly, and there just wasn't enough moisture in the batter. The promised liquid seeping from the zucchini never really happened.. and when I took it out of the oven, it was cooked, but still very crumbly on the top. Luckily I had the icing to cover that flaw with, but basically I would not have been able to serve these without frosting them. The frosting was probably the best part! Anyway, the kids ate them and were very surprised to learn of the vegetable content. But the texture wasn't 100%. I will keep looking for the perfect brownie recipe...

This is the fudgy brownie I have searched for years for!  Dont need to melt chocolate to get it just so.  And yes, its very thick.  Only think I will add a little choc syrup next time, not chocolate enough for my guy.

Everyone loved these brownies.  They are very tasty.  I used soy milk instead of regular milk in the frosting in order to keep the recipe vegan, so that may have been a factor in why the frosting was very liquidy (though that didn't stop anyone from devouring them).  Next time I'll add some cornstarch to thicken it up.  Otherwise, I highly recommend.

Moist, but tasteless.  Mouthful of mush. Baked for the full recommended time. Followed exactly for brownies, didn't bother with the frosting.  Did NOT find a keeper here.

These are amazing!  The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because this is much more like cake than brownies.  They weren't quite what I was going for, but the next time I want an amazing chocolate cake, I know which recipe I'm going to be reaching for!

I mostly made this recipe as directed. I did increase the cocoa to 3/4 c., I also added 1/2 c. of mini choc. chips, and skipped the icing. I used a fine grater to grate the zucchini. You can't even tell the zucchini is in there once it's baked. I don't normally eat zucchini and my husband and son hardly eat any veggies. We all liked these brownies. I do agree that these are a more cake-y brownie, but still very good. I will definitely be making these again.

I loved this Brownie Recipe. I followed the directions, except I added some coffee to the brownies, and the frosting. The coffee really enhances the chocolate flavor. No one had a clue that they were eating zucchini.  Delicious

I could not keep these brownies long. My family ate everything in a few minutes.
I added an egg to the recipe though because the dough came out a chalky.

Delicious!  Will make again!  Love that it has 2 full cups of zucchini.  4 stars bc of the lack of clarity regarding the consistency of the batter.  I added water before reading all the reviews.  Looking forward to trying without.

This was good. You couldn't even tell there was any zucchini in them. I didn't tell my kids and they loved them.

I absolutely loved this recipe! The only change I made was the flour (needed to be GF). Yes,  you will be surprised at how dry the batter is but just add the zucchini and all will be well, but very dense! My hubby thought they were too sweet so I will just cut back on the sugar next time. Loved-this is the only recipe I have ever reviewed so that should say something!

This recipe was hilarious!  It was just a bunch of crumbs that I pressed into the pan. But after baking it magically turned into the best brownies I ever tasted!  What a wonderful way to use zucchini! I followed the recipe exactly, but frosted with canned frosting because I was short on time.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Quite possibly the best brownie recipe I've ever made in 35 years of baking.  The batter was crumbly dry, even after the zucchini was added.  I kept stirring until it moistened up a bit, then pressed it into the greased pan.  Incredibly moist and scrumptious!!!  Not to mention an excellent use for my homegrown zucchini abundance.  Thank you so much for this truly delicious brownie recipe.

I made these following the directions except I used pecans instead of walnuts and I used butter instead of margarine in the frosting.  We really enjoyed these.  The batter looks really dry at first but once you add the Zucchini it gets moist.  It's really fudgy.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome.  I made them according to the recipe but sprinkled powder sugar on top instead of the frosting.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 11x17 pan.  Thank you for the recipe!

They're great without the frosting so I didn't even make it. Mine weren't quite as moist as some people have said, but I may just add a little more zucchini the next time I make it. And there WILL be a next time because my husband loved it!

LOVE these brownies!!  I can't imagine putting frosting on these as they are so moist and good.  I skipped the nuts and added 1/2 cup of choclate chips instead.  I also added more chips on top of the batter before baking.  Don't be afraid to add a bit more zucchini, I use HEAPING cupfuls.  YUM!

These were surprisingly good.  I halved the recipe...and baked for 25 minutes in a 9X9 pan (next time I'll use an 8x8) Basically made the recipe as written, however I pureed the zucchini and used a mixture of oil and applesauce (mixed together in a 1/4 measuring cup.  I put a little of that mixture in the food processor to help with the puree....you'd never know there was any zucchini in them.  They tasted better the next day and are very moist....definitely a keeper!

This is really good but it's definitely cake. I did not add eggs. I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only change I made was to use honey instead of white sugar. I used a food processor to very finely grate/puree the zucchini so you can't see it at all in there. This makes a superb cake, just don't expect brownies.

Pretty good, but I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, light Smart Balance margarine for the icing and added a tablespoon of Trader Joe's instant coffee to the cocoa in the icing. Great moist brownies!

This was a disaster! I checked and triple checked the recipie to make sure i was reading it correct. There was no "batter" at all! The zucchini came fresh from the garden and did not add any moisture. Im not sure how everyone else got so much moisure in theres but this is not worth it!

I've made this more than a dozen times over the last few years. It's become my standard chocolate cake/cupcake recipe (it turns out like cake for me). We have food allergies and this delicious recipe has no dairy or eggs, and we skip the nuts. Perfect! I do increase the zucchini to 3 or so cups.

It always turns out great and stays moist. I forgot to add the baking powder a few weeks ago and it turned out flat and dense, but still delicious. I'm thinking of halving the baking powder to make it more of a fudge brownie. Love this recipe

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used almonds rather then walnuts and I did not use this frosting, I made my own and it is perfect every time.
Frosting can be poured on while both are hot.
35g Butter
110g Dark chocolate (60% coco)
1 tablespoon Maple syrup
1 tablespoon Hot espresso
Melt together as you would normally melt chocolate.
I used a smaller baking dish so it higher and bakes for 55mins.

This was delicious and was a big hit! I added 2 eggs though as the mixture was too dry otherwise. I will also use nesquik chocolate powder for the icing next time as it all was too dark looking! thanks for such a yummy recipe! My son enjoyed adding coloured sprinkles on the icing and sharing with his buddies.

I loved loved loved this recipe! I just pulled it out an hour ago and it is so yummy. The only thing I didn't do was put in walnuts and added white chocolate chips because I wanted to use them up - but only about 1/4 cup. WAY better than I was expecting, even with all the fabulous reviews!

I had to make some changes.  I was excited about finding a recipe for brownies using zucchini because I'm tired of making just zucchini bread.  When I followed the recipe, I was concerned about the "sandy" batter and not having anything to bind the batter.  I added two eggs and it came out wonderful!!!  I also made a change to the frosting, I used butter not margarine and light cream instead of the milk.    I also put the walnuts on top of the frosting.  Kids went nuts over them.

Great recipe! Fudgy and delicious. Good for casual entertaining and family meals/snacks.  I didn't feel like making icing so I folded about 3 handfuls of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate bittersweet chips into the batter. The recipe also works with substituting half the flour with whole wheat flour for a bit more nutrition.

Followed recipe exactly, was getting worried about how dry the mix was until I realized that the moisture from the zucchini would be considerable.  And it was so true.  Delicious brownie like dessert with the frosting... if I were to try it without... not sure how fudgy it would seem.

I really liked these!  The frosting is flawless!  The brownies are good - more cakey than expected and I can totally tell there is zucchini in them!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding the nuts.  They need the frosting!  Will try again and shred the zucchini using a smaller grater.

This was a great recipe.  Make sure that you shred the zucchini as fine as possible and you won't notice it a bit.  The idea to melt chocolate chips on top worked well and was less work for me!

I followed this recipe to a tee and they turned out GREAT! Super moist and were a hit with my coworkers. I found the frosting a little rich but that helped me eat smaller pieces, hahaha. I have a way of mucking up most baking I do and I'd suggest that is what happened with the people who said they turned out like cardboard.
Thanks for sharing this recipe, it made me feel a little less useless when it comes to baking, haha!

these came out great, super moist and fudgey. Used freshly grated zucchini on a medium grate. Subbed coconut oil for the veg oil and a sweet ground chocolate/cocoa mixture for the cocoa powder. Also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 c. didn't bother with the frosting and they were awesome without it. The "batter" is very dry and sandy, but they come out tasting beautifully!

Delicious even w/o frosting. I wanted chocolately goodness and while I expect brownies to be thick and chewy, these were fluffy and light, though a little heavier than a cake which was fine by me. The batter was dry until the zucchini was added which in my case made it fluid and wet. Easy to make too!

Taste was great but the texture was not what I was expecting.  It was gritty rather than fudgy like I thought it would be.  Of course it was probably inexperience but I followed recipe as written.  I will try this again though because the taste was so good.

BEST BROWNIES EVER!!!  helpful hint:  must work oil/sugar mixture into dry ingredients with spatula.  still looks dry but by adding shredded zucchini it will then become a thick batter.  be careful not to over mix.  added chocolate chips in place of nuts...chocolatey goodness!!!

These brownies taste nice and chocolatey. The texture is slightly spongy, which is somewhat off putting.

These are great.  I've already made them twice.  Followed the recipe exactly which like others have said is very dry.  Mixing well and grating the zucchini finely is a must for the batter which bakes up moist and fudgey into a great brownie.  I didn't frost mine since hubby doesn't like frosting and these really don't taste like they are missing it.  Plenty sweet enough.  Definitely a big hit and great way to use all those zucchini growing in my garden right now.

I doubled the recipe and turned the brownies into a 2 layer birthday cake for my daughter. Everyone was surprised  that there was zucchini in it.

Delicious...don't be fooled by how thick and dry the batter seems...if anything a little sprinkling of water to pick up some of the flour/ cocoa is all that is needed.  The zucchini does the rest as it bakes.  Will make this again......and again!

GREAT recipe! I had many compliments on these brownies. I must admit that I was skeptical on these as the batter was VERY dry when putting it in the pan, but as the reviews state...the moisture from the zucchini bakes out and makes these very moist and chewy brownies. YUMMMMMM :)

Heres the deal: the taste itself is yummy. The Zucchini should be puree instead of shredded. Extra walnuts and a hand full of chocolate chips helps ALOT! Butter up the pan well. Once they cool, the become more formed together. Also I will be trying a smaller pan since my 9x13 made some rather thin brownies. SO they did come out a bit flakey but would def. try again because the taste itself is yummy. Didnt make any frosting.

These were absolutely great! You cannot taste the zucchini! It is extremely moist and the chocolate icing goes terrific. The only change I made was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil; much healthier, and it still tasted delicious.

I had a large zucchini from my CSA farm share that I wanted to use up.  Since there are only so many ways to steam, roast and grill veggies I wanted to try something different.  I had made this recipe once before years ago and recalled it being good.  My results this time produced more of a cake and less of a fudgey brownie.  The zucchini was plenty moist and I followed the recipe as written (no egg added) so I'm not sure why it turned out like cake.  I wasn't planning on making the frosting but after taste-testing the brownies I had to put something on them.  I'll give them another try eventually but overall I was disappointed this time around.

Excellent zucchini brownie recipe. The kids loved it with and without the icing.  I noticed it seemed a bit salty the first time, so the second time I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, and the other flavors seemed more balanced.

This was the first time I've made brownies from a recipe vs a box. It did come out a tad on the cakey side - which everyone loved. Noone had a clue it had zucchini! Everyone raved at how moist and tasty these were!  (so do we get to eat more since it has a veggie and is good for us?)

These brownies are some of the best I've ever made and my husband agreed.  He didn't even know there was zucchini in it until I told him.
I was a little skeptical at first because the batter was so dry but the more I mixed it the more moist it became.  I've already suggested it to my kids and will be making it often.

Initially when I was making these I thought surely I read the recipe wrong. I read it four times over wondering if I had double the flour or something. The recipe was very powdery. and I just couldn't see the zucchini bringing in that much moisture. But I decided to continue anyway. Once I started folding in the zucchini I was sure that I had taken a wrong turn someplace. I didn't have the strength to fold in the final ingredients so I broke out my kitchen aid mixer and everything turned around. They turned out wonderful. I think the trick is finely grate the zucchini and use a heavy duty mixer. Amazing Cake-like Brownies :)

This turns out like cake, NOT like brownies.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, no eggs, and was surprised that it rose like a cake.  It tasted fine, but I was hoping for a brownie recipe that I could sneak veggies into, not a cake recipe.  If you're looking for zucchini cake, though, it's pretty great :)

It was edible.  The tastes was fine but mine turned out really grainy and dry.  It looks nothing like the pictures.  I got myself a new food processor and used that to grate the zucchini.  It turned out a little thicker than I had wished but that may be the reason why it didnt turn out.  I will try again and used a smaller grater to shred the zucchini.  After reading the reviews I am kind of wondering if the way people are grating there zucchini is changing their results so much.  I guess I will find out next time I make this.

Update:  I grated the zucchini very fine this time and it turned out much more moist.  More like a dense cake.  In fact i would not call this a brownie.   It was too much like cake but very good. Lesson learned: dont grate zucchini too thick.

I tried this recipe TWICE because I thought surely I had done something wrong the first time.  Turns out, there really isn't enough liquid in this recipe for the brownies to turn out anything but sandy.  At best.  Perhaps if the zucchini was grated small and then salted with the salt these might turn out okay, but as the recipe reads, they were supremely disappointing.

I was shy of 1 1/2 C sugar so it was more like 1 and 1/4 and also shy of another tsp of vanilla... The "brownie" was very moist but it wasn't dense as a brownie.. It was delish!  The frosting - well, I ran out of vanilla so I added a melted square of bakers semi sweet chocolate to the frosting recipe, also used butter instead of margarine, and the frosting turned out great!  Caloric value for these says 210 for a serving but I don't buy it!!! Try it! It's good!

I made these brownies a few years ago, and recall them being pretty tasty. I could not detect any zucchini in them, and it lead to a very moist brownie. I decided to double the frosting for a birthday cake I made yesterday. Unfortunately the frosting was very powdery tasting (which makes sense given the ingredients). I would not make this in the future. So, my advice is to make the brownies without the frosting, or find a different one.

Oh my my. I have lots of frozen shredded zucchini from this summer in my freezer and thought I should use some up. These are amazing. I did not change a thing. The batter looked so strange at first (very dry and crumbly!) but when you add the zucchini it moistens right up. I think I will go have another...

These were actually very good, but come together as easily as I had hoped.  The mixture is very dry, so I had to use a pan about half the size and double it up on top of each other.  After cooking, it still seemed crumbly and veggie flavored.  I was disappointed, but when I reheated a brownie in the microwave for 30 seconds, it came out with amazing flavor and texture.  I can only imagine that something needed to change in the cooking process.  These brownies are EXCELLENT once you get a handle on the recipe!!!

For a healthy brownie, these are excellent! I substituted applesauce for the oil and they turned out fine. A bit more cake-like than traditional brownies, but very good.

I just made these brownies and yes they are cake like, which I am ok with. I made them with butter instead of oil and added 3/4 cup of milk since it was VERY dry. They turned out great. I'm not using the icing this time although I would if I was taking these to a dinner party.

Awesome, perfect brownies. I skipped the frosting.  You would never be able to tell there was zucchini in these, which is perfect for my texture-picky husband.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  The frosting was absolutely perfect.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it was great.  The only missing star is for the fact that it was a little more cake-like than we like, but that is just a matter of personal preference- there was nothing wrong with them at all!  Moist and delicious!

I made these for a family picnic, and my VEY picky brother-in-law didn't believe me when I said they had Zucchini in them because he really liked them. I made them just as the recipe said to and they turned out delicious!

I am an expert level baker and made the brownie portion of the recipe as written.  As others have said, the batter has a very dry, sandy texture.  While it did turn into "brownies" the flavor is bland and lacking a true chocolate taste.  A dry crust formed on the top that tastes quite salty, almost like it separated from the rest of the batter.  I didn't bother making the frosting after tasting the brownies.  If I made these again (and I don't think I will) I would add at least one egg to incorporate the dry ingredients.

We really enjoyed these.  My son, the pickiest eater ever, ate these and loved them.  He doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables.  We liked them warmed up just a touch.  I made the icing but only put a very thin layer on the brownies.

Okay, I read the reviews and thought to myself that no brownies made with zucchini could be that good.  Well, ladies hang on to your skirts - because they are fabulous!  Didn't change a thing, made them as directed, just baked an additional 8 minutes.  This is going to be a staple during zucchini season for sure!

This is my first review, although I have used and enjoyed many recipes from allrecipes.com. I HAD to say these were the most amazing brownies EVER! My kids loved them, I loved them, they were easy, although they took a little work, and they came out fabulous following the recipe exactly. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!

These were reaaaally fudgy and thick brownies, I could taste *something* in there but if I didn't make them myself, I wouldn't have known it was zucchini.  I omitted the nuts, and wish I had added them.  Instead of oil, I used a fresh applesauce I made with cinnamon and freshly picked organic apples.  In fact I actually put too much mix into the pans and it rose, so I have these absolutely humongous, thick, fudgy brownies.  They are great tasting though!  Because of that I had to extend the cook time  by about 15 minutes.

I had too many zucchini from my garden so I doubled the recipe, I also added two teaspoons of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and omitted the walnuts. I then baked it in a 13x9 cake pan for 45 to 50 minutes. Let it cool, and I also doubled the frosting recipe, adding one more tablespoon of cocoa to make it richer. It made a nice cake and my family devoured it.

I made these exactly how the recipe said and I did not like them at all.  I don't like my brownies moist and crispy and the taste wasn't great either.  They were edible, but if I'm going to eat something sweet I want them to be more than edible!

Delicious!  I thought the batter was going to be too dry until I added the zucchini, but it turned out perfect.  These are a little more cake-like than I was expecting for brownies, but still very moist & very good with the frosting.  Kid & adult tested! Yum

Oh wow, amazingly moist and delicious! Like others I triple-checked this recipe thinking that I must be missing something, but they turned out great following the recipe exactly. All I can think of for the few others who said that the batter was dry is that maybe they drained the zucchini first? I didn't, I left all the water in it and the batter was nice and moist.

Not a huge brownie fan but had an abundance of zucchini so I gave this a try....and wow!!! The only difference I did was I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil to avoid that greasy feel/taste and it turned out perfect!!  Great recipe!

I was very .... let me say that one more time very ! surprised by this recipe! It turned out fabulous! I was very skeptical due to the fact that the batter looked soooo dry. I rechecked the recipe 3 times it freaked me out so much. But I must say after baking they turned out fabulous! My fiance ate the whole batch in 2 days! The only alteration I did was to use whole wheat flour, which turned out amazing :)

These are excellent!  I took them to a potluck and they were devoured.  :)  I am so glad I read the reviews frist though so I knew that the batter would be dry...otherwise I would have thought I did something wrong.  But that is how they are and turn out great!!  I followed the recipe as written but used store bought frosting just for ease.  Great recipe.  I'm making them again this morning per my son's request for his birthday.

I have made this recipe numerous time and the are the best. Always very moist. I follow the recipe as written except no nuts because I don't like nuts. They are always a hit at home and work.

I have so much zucchini coming out of my garden, and was bored with just making bread, so I decided to try this.  I am SO glad I did. They did turn out a bit more cakelike than I expected, but very moist.  I had no problems with the brownies falling apart or being hard to frost. I did not notice and weird aftertaste like some reviewers noted, which makes me wonder if they had off zucchini or oil or something. Anyhow, great, great recipe...one that I will be making again and again, and sharing!

These brownies are wonderful. They have a very moist cake.  Delicious. I didn't put all of the frosting on the second time I made them and they weren't so rich. Love them either way. Thank you Marian.

Incredibly suprising, I too was sceptical as mine were very dry and turned into more of a buiscut / slice then a brownie, will add a touch of water next time. Otherwise the taste was wonderfull and a relativly (relativly) healthy dessert. Thank you

These were really cakey for me for some reason, and I followed the exact recipe.  They were good for what they were, but nothing spectacular.  I wasn't a fan of the frosting.

I've made these brownies twice. Both times, I've found that because the initial "batter" is so dry, it is difficult not to have small flour/sugar clumps.   Aside from that issue, this recipe makes very fudgy brownies.

Maybe my mistake was using Splenda instead of real sugar!  Strange texture, too flat, but good frosting.  I'll save the frosting recipe and not make this brownie again.

These didn't disappoint flavour-wise - but I have to agree with the others who said this was more of a cake than a "brownie". I even reduced the leavening to try and "fudge it up" a bit (my standard fudge brownie has none). Even then, delicious, and my glut of zucchini is gone!

I did substitute apple sauce for the oil but that was the only change I made. Mine came out pretty cakey and not very browney like (and you can see the zucchini along the top and bottom of the brownie). They taste ok, but I don't think they taste all that great, the aftertaste is not very chocolatey. However, the frosting is great! I was hoping for a "healthier" dessert, but don't think I'll try this one again. After a day they turned really messy/gooey too. Hubby and son weren't very pleased with the flavor either.

I had the hardest time trusting this recipe without any eggs in it but I can tell you that it is amazing when done. It is moist and holds together and tastes great. A wonderful way to use zucchini when they are abundant.

The brownies themselves aren't bad, but aren't great either. They have a different texture- almost spongy, and aren't quite sweet enough the stand on their own. I was going to skip the frosting, but after tasting the cooled brownies I decided to make add it. Big mistake- The frosting is VERY sweet and slightly bitter from all of the cocoa. It's also pretty runny (I started to add more sugar to thicken it up but the frosting was already overly sweet). My advise? Skip this frosting recipe and find a better one, but if you must use this one- cut back on the cocoa powder.

The process of making these (the mixing part) was so annoying.  A lot of stirring, a lot of uncertainty--despite having read the others' reviews...and all this for a brownie that had a strange goopy texture and that wasn't that great tasting.  Yes, they all got eaten, my kids aren't picky.  But I would not make these again.  I'll save my zucchini for yummy bread or cookies or something.  I'd say don't bother with this one.

I expected these to be delicious brownies after all of the reviews, but they were not.  I followed the recipe exactly and while the texture is perfect, the taste was just not that great.  I don't know if I did something wrong and didn't realize it, so I may try these again just to see, but if they taste the same I will definitely not make these again.

I may have done something wrong, but I followed the directions exactly.  The taste is good, but the brownies look horrible and powdery.  I think I may need more zucchini to make the brownies turn out more moist next time.

These brownies were exceptional.  I made them exactly as written using sunflower oil as my vegetable oil and I never got the chance to make the frosting -- they were gone before I got the chance to mix it up.  The mixture was dry and I was skeptical but after reading other reviews I went ahead and they came out perfect--glad I didn't add anything.  On another note--my husband has stomach troubles eating chocolate and he tried one and then went back for another and NO stomach troubles with these.  I'm not sure if it was the oil or the cocoa powder that made the difference but I may never make any other kind of brownies from now on.  I do want the chance to try them with the frosting.  Thank You so much for this wonderful recipe.

I was amazed by how delicious these were. The texture was not as gooey and rich as a typical brownie, but perfect for those who don't like too much chocolate. The batter was very dry, but it turned out perfectly in the end.

I made these exactly according to the instructions, except with a 9x15 pan, and they turned out pretty bad.  The texture of the 'batter' was powdery and I mixed it with my hands, although a pastry blender also would have worked.  The finished brownie tasted okay, but the texture was too dense, too crumbly, a bit fudgy and a bit chalky. The edges were crispy and the tester came out just right but I think a few more minutes in the oven would turn out a more cohesive brownie.  I would go with a 9x9 pan if I did them again as they turned out very thin, but I don't think a thicker version would hold together in squares much better.  Next time I'll make zucchini bread.

These are the best brownies I've ever made, and I'm pretty old!   Followed the recipe exactly except for soymilk in frosting, almonds instead of walnuts.  I've been following a varied & plentiful but rather austere vegan diet for five months now, and this was my first attempt at a real vegan dessert.  They are almost too rich and moist...think I will try the variation using applesauce instead of oil next time and probably skip the frosting, which is almost too much of a good thing.  It was interesting to see that dry crumbly batter turn moist as the zucchini gave up its liquid...

These were GREAT! :)  I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil to lower the calorie intake, and also reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  MMMMMMmmmm, will make again when I have more zuchinni :)

Wow--this recipe is pretty amazing. The brownie wasn't that spectacular in flavor, but it is moist and you cannot taste the zucchini at all! The frosting is what makes it a decadent dessert--it is rich and wonderful, and adds any sweetness the frosting lacks. This recipe is a real keeper, especially if you want to add a little pleasure to your 5-a-day!

Incredible brownies! I followed the recipe exactly and shared them with neighbors who called them "ridiculously good." And it's true! They're so rich and delicious that it's ridiculous!

I love zucchini, so whenever I come across a recipe that includes zucchini, I have to give it a try. I was sadly disappointed with these brownies. Perhaps it's because I'm so picky when it comes to brownies in the taste/texture department. I agree with many others--I did not add any eggs, but the final product still seemed like a dense cake to me. Also, I couldn't taste any of the chocolate in the brownie itself, so flavor-wise, I thought these brownies were pretty bland. If I hadn't used the chocolate frosting (from another brownie recipe that uses coffee), I would have had no chocolate flavor at all (I even put mini choc chips in it and they seemed to have dissolved within the cake). If I had added spices to this cake, I would have never known there was cocoa in this recipe, aside form the color. It's not  bad recipe per se, but it's not one I'll be visiting again. I'll stick to zucchini bread and spice cake if I want this yummy squash in a dessert.

These are AMAZING!  I never like from-scratch brownies, or chocolate frosting!  This adjusted well to be a little healthier, but even without the adjustments they are just DIVINE!  I will never try another homemade brownie recipe again, this one is IT!

Very easy, delicious and a great way to use zucchini.  They are dense and texture is highly dependent on how wet your zucchini was during preparation. No eggs! (Which is great for our egg allergies!) They are not "bitter," that's the taste of real cocoa!

I followed the recipe exactly, but chose to opt out on the frosting. My family thought these were good, but I wasn't very impressed. The texture of the brownies was excellent, but I found them to be a bit too bitter and not quite sweet enough. I prefer regular brownies. When it comes to zucchini treats, I think I'd rather have zucchinni bread.

My son and husband loved this recipe. My nephew could not get enough - I had to stop him at 5 pieces and told him to let someone else get a chance to try it. My two other boys still need to try it but I am sure it will be a hit with them as well. Very moist. As I was mixing it I thought how on earth am I going to mix the dry ingredients with the sugar and oil so I added the zucchini to the sugar/oil mixture first then added the dry. Turned out fabulous . Will definitely be making it again. Shared the recipe with my mom who is making it tonight.

I thought these were very good. Mine did not turn out as fudgy as some reviewers mentioned, but I did have to make a few changes. I somehow did not have oil on hand, so I used applesauce and reduced the amount of sugar. I did also add some dark chocolate chips. The frosting was an excellent addition. I could almost convince myself these were healthy with no oil and zucchini!

My friends love these brownies! I do a few things slightly differently. I use about 2.5 cups of zucchini add the zucchini to the oil and sugar instead of folding it in last. I also add 1/2 tsp of Almond extract. Personal preference I do not add the nuts. Friends did not know there was zucchini in them until I told them! YUMMY! Oh and I make it with out the icing so that it is dairy free!

I'm giving this five stars because it was so delicious.  However, I would not classify it as brownies, but as a cake.  I did not add any eggs, and would love to know how people got the fudgy brownie texture.  Nevertheless, it is a recipe I'll make again and again.

These were delicious and my kids loved them! We were making them for a friend with food allergies, so we substituted a vegan chocolate frosting. They were so good that we're going to make them again soon. Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and was still a little dry but the zucchini I used was a little drier than standard.  Next time, I'll add more oil if my zucchini isn't juicy. If you like a more cakey brownie, try pureeing the zucchini with the oil, vanilla and sugar.

The Zucchini "Brownies" title is a little misleading.  These weren't as firm and chewy as brownies and turned out more like a moist chocolate cake.  I kept thinking I needed to add an egg or some oil or something but stuck to the recipe.  I did need to add more milk so the frosting was smooth and spreadable.  Still a very good recipe and can't even taste the zucchini.

The only way I'll ever make brownies again! I even made it healthier by subbing 1/2 of the oil for applesauce and 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat and leaving off the icing completely. My husband and kids still loved them (I did too!) Hubby couldn't believe it had so much zucchini in it even though he saw me grate it.

With my garden zucchini so abundant, this is a  treat!  I cut the sugar to 1 cup, used wheat & white flours, and a bit more nuts.  MOIST AND PERFECTLY SWEET CHOCOLATE TREAT!   Added more cocoa and vanilla, and used 1/4 cup less sugar...A KEEPER!

I was skeptical because of the dry consistency of the batter prior to adding the zucchini, and the omission of any eggs, but these were hands-down the best use of my shredded zucchini that I have ever made! I didn't add any icing either, because they are good and healthier without, but I'm sure that would only add to their yumminess! The nice thing is you can't see the zucchini in them, so the kids don't even know they are eating "the green stuff"!!

I made this recipe exactly .  The batter was really dry as others had stated but moistened pretty quickly from the zucchini as I was mixing.  Did not make the frosting and they were great without it.  I had some butterscotch chips left over so I spread them on top before baking.  These brownies were incredible and so easy to make.  Will try to make a few healthy adjustments next time I make them and see if they are as good.  It's a keeper!!!!

I made this over the weekend and brought them into work this morning for a colleague's birthday.  They are FABULOUS!  I'm getting lots of rave reviews.  So moist and yummy.  I did add 2 eggs.  As soon as I started to mix the sugar, oil and vanilla, I knew it wasn't going to work so I added the eggs and it all came together. And, like everyone said, you don't think it is possible that all the dry ingredients are going to constitute a batter until you add the zucchini - it moistens it all up beautifully.  When mixing the frosting, I used a whisk and it blended nicely.  This one is a keeper.

A delightful dessert that is addictive, this brownie recipe is sure to please even a picky palate (like that of my 2 year old son).  Substituting one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of all-purpose flour provides piece of mind that in addition to the zucchini (and optional applesauce substitute for half the oil, for which I use olive oil) my children are eating a more nutritious brownie than if it came from a box.  Instead of the frosting, try drizzling chocolate syrup atop slightly cooled brownies.  Another variation: sprinkle the walnuts on top (or on half, if some in your family do not like nuts) instead of folding them into the batter.  Then, when the brownies are slightly cooled, drizzle caramel syrup over them.  Regardless, enjoy!

These aren't my "favorite" brownies but they are wonderful.  After mixing in about half of the dry ingredients into the wet, I really thought I inaccurately measured because it didn't look moist enough.  I assumed correctly that the zucchini would take care of that, because it did.  I could have baked it for about 30 minutes and not have it be as moist/tasting underbaked but that's personal preference.  This will definitely be on my list for another way to use garden zucchini in a baked good instead of always making zucchini bread!

I have made these twice: 1st time (no modification)- Used a stand mixture to mix and a food processor to shred zucchini. Brownies were moist but more cake like (perhaps due to way they were mixed).  No 'veggie' aftertaste. Not "OMG" worthy, but good.  2nd time- Wooden spoon to mix and processor to shred.  Added 2 c. of chocolate chips and 4T Baileys.  REALLY GOOD.  Very moist, and chocolatey, not at all cake like.  Turned out more true to the consistency of box brownies (which I love). But this time did have a 'veggie' after-taste, although very slight. Would make again the second way for sure.

I had too much zucchini and this ended up to be a great way to use it. I was afraid the texture would be bad or the taste would come through, but it didn't at all. They were perfect, except for one thing. I followed the recipe to a "T" except for using chocolate chips instead of walnuts and the brownie turned out really mushy. Not fudge-like, mushy. Other reviews claimed their batter was dry, mine was runny. Maybe my zucchini was too wet. I don't care for most veggies and this was a great way to get them in my diet.

i was VERY skeptical, especially wwhen mixing the "batter", which was very dry. However, i had to wait to cook them, and the batter moistened before my eyes. They are good, but certainly not comparable to a true full fat brownie. However, i'm sure i will get it past my no veggie 3 yr old. Not sure if this is worth wasting a zucchini on, but if you're overrun, it's worth a try.

Brownies were exceptionally moist, tasted really good.  Frosting was ok, nothing exceptional about it.  I was really worried with the "batter" until I added the zucchini because I thought there was no way the zucchini was going to add enough moisture to make the batter able to be poured, but it was like magic!  The brownies looked awesome right out of the oven.  I wouldn't make these brownies just as my regular brownie recipe, but if you have extra zucchini give them a try.

This was a big hit in my house, even with my vegetable-phobic son who had no clue what he was eating.  I substitued part whole wheat flour in the second batch I made and couldn't tell the difference.  Very yummy!

Will give this 5 stars because I do not think you should decrease stars if you change the recipe and do not like it. I did use applesauce in place of the oil. I did not like this at all with that particular change. I had two friends try this recipe, both could not finish one square. One friend was not fond of zucchini and could detect the zucchini flavor. Me and the other friend did not like the spongy consistency. Husband? He likes everything and liked these, though not over the top about them. Not sure I will try again with oil, since I like to keep recipes moderately healthy.

Spectacular brownies!  I'll be making these again and again!  As indicated by other reviewers, this does look a little funny going into the pan, but don't let that fool you.  These brownies are so rich and chocolatey, you don't even need the frosting!

These were delish! Very moist and chocolatey- you would NEVER guess they had healthy zucchini in them!! I will admit my guests weren't particularly thrilled by them, but I am giving the recipe 5 stars because I loved them. I grated the zucchini because I don't have a shredder and that worked fine. DO NOT drain the zucchini or it will be too dry for sure. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Yummy yummy!

Love this recipe! It is a great alternative to making traditional zucchini bread, especially as this one does not call for eggs. The large zucchini I shredded made about five to six cups, so I decided to split the batter into 3 pans (two 8x8 and one pie plate). They all baked up great. The texture is cake-like... maybe I could have spread them into four pans for a more chewy consistency? Nonetheless, I will be making these again and sharing the recipe with others.

Just made these with fresh zucchini from my garden!  My son who is 5, ate these up like they were the best thing he ever had and he is the pickiest eater.  I am so glad to also offer these to my group of friends who have nut and egg allergies!  Super moist and gooey!  Better then any homemade brownies or box brownies or bakery brownies I have made and a plus it has a veggie in it!!!

Excellent brownies that didn't even need the frosting!  I followed the recipe except I omitted the walnuts and frosting; I also used special dark cocoa powder.  I used an 8 inch zuch straight out of the garden, peeled, then shredded.  It yielded almost exactly 2 cups of shreds.  Next time I may try to use Splenda instead of sugar.

Made without frosting and were pretty good considering they contained zucchini.  Mix is very dry because zucchini adds moisture to mix during baking.  Next time I will add chocolate chips.

I viewed this recipe with skepticism since it had no eggs.   The addition of the shredded zucchini does make the batter, as what you have, initially, is very dry.  These brownies were reasonably moist and fudgy but not as moist and fudgy as I'd like. Still its one of the better zucchini recipes I've tried lately.

These were ok. The batter was really dry and maybe my zucchini wasn't moist enough but there ended up being dry spots throughout the finished product. Made exactly as written except omitted the nuts.

Fantastic recipe!  It takes a little time to shred the zucchini but it was great.  The batter looked rather lumpy/stringy even though the zucchini was very fine, but it came out smooth and even.  I do think this is more like a fudge cake, but I don't discriminate between fudgey desserts - brownie, cake, cookie, or plain old fudge, if it's good, I'll eat it.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding M&Ms instead of walnuts and sub'ing applesauce for oil.  The frosting came out slightly runny, but again, liquid fudge is not a problem in my book.  I will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe.

These are great!  Like some other reviewers, I found them to be more cake like than brownie like.  I did NOT add an egg as another reviewer suggested those of us that found them cake like did.  I believe they are cakey due to the amount of baking soda and will try reducing that to 1 tsp next time to see if I get a denser brownie.  I also added two handfuls of Nestle semi-sweet morsels and no frosting.  Next time it will be 1 tsp baking soda and 3 handfuls of the semi-sweet chips but there will definitely be a next time.  Great recipe.

These things are awsome!! I was a little nervous when I first made them because the mixture was dry, but all the moisture from the zucchini makes them moist. I made these for work and wouldnt tell people what were in them until them ate them! They were a hit and were gone in minutes! I have made these a few times for different occasions and they go everytime!!!

Like others said, the batter is really dry even after you add the zucchini. You have to press the "batter" into the pan, but as it cooks, the zucchini's moisture is released. I added too much oil because I thought it was too dry--big mistake!--so it came out crumbly after I cooked it, but still tasty. I pat it down to make it more dense and crumble less. Still tastes great!

EDIT: I made this again but stuck to the recipe and used grated instead of minced zucchini. The consistency was different and more cakey and not as sweet. I'd recommend adding a bag of chocolate chips and decreasing the sugar to 1 cup and using minced fresh zucchini instead of zucchini that's been sitting in the fridge for a week.

These turned out great!! The frosting is very sweet and yummy, like you'd find on a Texas Sheet Cake. Mine came out  a little more cake-like, but oh-my-goodness-good! No one even knew there was zucchini inside. I struggled with shredding my zucchini (blender doesn't work) I ended up chopping by hand. All worked out. Delicious recipe!!

It was amazing you couldn't even taste the zucchini in these brownies. However, I did find them to be raw after baking them for 35 min. I guess it isn't really a problem because they don't have eggs in them. I chose not to bring them to a cookout because they need to be eaten with a fork or they fall apart. Next time will try 1/4 cup more flour and an extra tbsp of cocoa powder. Thanks for an interesting recipe!

Good but definitely tastes like a cake, not brownies. If I made this again I would add extra cocoa powder and some chocolate chips.

Lovely brownies. Very moist and light. The nutrition facts listed for this recipe are not correct. These ingredients (if using olive oil) in these amounts, totaled and divided by 24 (servings) make each brownie 132 calories and just under 5 grams of fat.  These are a great alternative to fat laden regular brownies. My husband loves them.

Superb!  So fudgy and very easy to make.  I mixed the shredded zucchini in with a wooden spoon until the batter was moist enough to "pour."  I wonder if they would have come out the same if I had truly "folded" in the zucchini.  I also omitted the nuts (hubby doesn't like them) but did not add anything else.  I used some leftover homemade chocolate buttercream frosting, but they truly didn't need any frosting.  I can't wait to make these again!

These did turn out very cakelike and moist for me. I was happy with the results and will make them again. I did add a couple of egg whites to the batter because was simultaneously making ice cream and hated to waste them.

I love brownies. These are healthy since they have zucchini, so I love them even more. These are so tasty, however; you barely can tell it has zucchini. It tastes like a regular brownie! Better than a regular brownie! This brownie is so yummy and if I were you, I would make these brownies and eat the whole pan.

Delicious!  We made this 4 times in one week!  We didn't use quite 1/2 c oil and it still turned out moist!  I took a pan of these to my husband's work the first time I made them.. before anyone had even tasted them.. big risk!  but everyone kept telling me how great they were!  Made a second batch the same day cause the kids wanted to taste them.  Took them to a cookout and everyone loved them!  Have zucchini thawing as we speak to make another batch.  Definitely will make again.. and again!

You WILL taste the baking soda in this recipe. But I've found most people are less aware of the taste of baking soda than they are of things like moistness and richness, so this might not be a problem. That said, these brownies are extremely moist, and topping them with sour cream frosting makes this very rich. I've made these many times - a couple times there was an odd aftertaste difficult to describe. It's fun to tell people these are special brownies made with a secret green ingredient.

Wow!  I followed the recipe (but without nuts) and they were awesome!  I waited to see how they were without icing and since they were fantastic, I didn't even bother.  My kids also love them and they're super moist.  The batter is strange, but it turns out scrumptious.  How many ways can I say delicious? :)

Amazing brownies!  My son has an egg and dairy allergy so this was perfect. I was scared at how dry the batter was when I put it in the pan but it baked up so moist and great!  I iced it with the Hershey Chocolate icing using Earth Balance butter and Rice milk.  He is 3 yrs old and it was his first taste of a brownie.  I love love love this recipe!

Terrific recipe. I made several substitutions to make it healthy and it still turned out great. I substituted half the oil with apple sauce,  put only 3/4 cup of sugar (I prefer less sweet), and substitute half the four with whole wheat. I also made the topping with semi-sweet chocolate chips and coco powder melted over heated water. This recipe deserves an award!

these are really wonderful brownies! do not by alarmed by the very dry "batter". i was so sure i missed an ingredient. but just trust it and put it in the oven. the zucchini will moisten it perfectly. i added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips with the nuts and that was a good addition- though not essential. i also used butter for the icing because i hate the idea of margarine and it was good. some people say that they're fine without the icing but i think the icing adds a very nice sweetness that compliments the brownies (i do like things sweet, though!)

Thank goodness I read the reviews before I made this otherwise I would have thrown out the "batter". The only adjustments I made were using applesauce instead of oil and using whole wheat flour instead of regular. The batter was very dry...almost like a breadcrumb texture. I had to press it into the pan.  It did turn out pretty good. Not cakey nor gooey/fudgelike...just somewhere in the middle.  But, you can DEFINITELY taste the zucchini in it. It's not bad, just takes some getting used to. If I hadn't have made the frosting to go with it, the zucchini probably would have been too overpowering. However, with the frosting...delicious!!  I've been trying to eat healthier but these chocolate cravings have been killing me. Thanks, Marian, for providing me a middle ground. :)  UPDATE: I just made these again and they were even better. The only difference was that I used frozen, shredded zucchini. I thawed it out (3 cups, BTW) and drained some of the water. Dumped it in. Oh, I also used oil and regular flour this time too. The dough was "wetter" than last time and they turned out amazingly delicious. I cannot even taste the zucchini. Probably the best brownie I've ever had.

My daughter made these and loved them so sent the recipe to me. I love them. I now make them regularly. Wonderful recipe. Completely perfect. I frost with Mocha icing. Like that coffee flavour. So good.  * This is a recipe with no eggs. They are not left out by mistake.

i baked 2 versions of this recipe because the first batch came out salty!  i made the chocolate frosting to compensate of this, and it turned out ok.  the second batch contained no salt, and tasted much better.  however, i used a glass pan (same size) instead of a metal one, and the brownies not only took longer to bake, they were still very gooey in the center.  my advice:  lower or skip the salt, and use a metal baking pan lined with parchment paper, greased, and floured.

I don't know what I did wrong, but these turned out a lot more gooey than expected...not that it made any difference on flavor. Loved them! They seemed like they hadn't cooked long enough, but my oven was burning the top before the middle could finish baking. Next time I'll have to use a different oven.

Delicious even though they secretly have zucchini. Don't tell anyone tho - it might put them off.

These did not appeal to me at all. I didn't like the texture after they baked and just didn't taste good to me.

My sister-in-law shared this recipe with me, so I had to try it for myself.  Wow!  They are wonderful. We added 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the frosting and they were just as good.  Thanks for sharing!

After reading some of the reviews and changes people made I decide to simply go with the original and see how it turned out. It was good but like some others I thought it was rather cakey. I could also taste the zucchini fairly heavily, though, that could very well be my fault for not double checking the measurement (long story) but I might try mixing in the zucchini before the dry ingredients the next time...it could help.  Anyway, I enjoyed it regardless, that's why it gets 4 stars. Though, I enjoy zucchini bread and regular brownies over this...so I probably wont make it again.

I first made these with no changes other than adding an egg to make the brownies more cake-like (my husband prefers that).  Awesome.  My husband said they were the best brownies he'd ever eaten.  The second time I changed the 1 1/2 cup sugar to 3/4 cup sugar/splenda mix because my father is diabetic and I wanted him to taste them.  I think next time I'll increase the sugar/splenda mix to 1 cup because they weren't quite sweet enough.  Besides that, they were still delicious.

This turned out different than I thought it would, but I still enjoyed this recipe. The "batter" is more like a crumble before you add the zucchini so don't be discouraged if it's dry. I will be trying this again.

Great recipe.  I didn't change a thing -- although I often omit the nuts.  It has a unique moist and chewy texture.  The frosting finishes it off -- and I think these actually taste better after they've been sitting on the counter for a day or two.  :)  Yum!

I've never found a recipe on here that I followed exactly until this one! I thought for sure that it was too thick..  I basically had to use my hand to PRESS it out into the pan! But, it turned out PERFECT!! My husband didn't even realize he was eating zucchini either!!!

Fabulous! The zucchini was incredible and made the brownies super moist. I loved them, and am definitely going to make them again. I substitued the sugar with splenda, and tasted fine.

perfect brownie consistency. i added 3 tbs of peanut butter and omitted the walnuts. they do have a slight zucchini taste, but that didn't stop everyone from eating them up. i only had enough ingredients to make half the serving size and they only needed to bake for 20 minutes. delicious:)

So, so good!!!!! Almost all the zucchini we had in the garden became brownies since I tried this recipe ;)  I found that we liked it better when I put double the amount of zucchini and cocoa (well almost the double for cocoa)...  No frosting needed :)

I love this recipe! The frosting isn't necessary, but it's a great addition. I'm headed to the kitchen to make another batch, and I'll be using applesauce instead of oil this time. Definitely a keeper!

WOW! Excellent! Very moist! I did substitute 1/2 applesauce for all the oil (two no sugar added mott's blueberry flavored cups). I also used 3 - 4 cups of zucchini because it was already shredded from a bread and I wanted to use it up. Delicious!

More like a very chocolate cake than a true brownie, but tasted delicious. Will use again as a cake recipe, but not when I need brownies.

What a great recipe! These are a "cake" brownie, which I prefer. I used zucchini that I had grated two days earlier, so I added two tablespoons of water to the batter, and the brownies were perfect! I used a glass pan, so I reduced the oven temp. by 25 degrees.  For those who didn't think the brownies were "chocolatey" enough, I suggest using Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder. This is what I used For both the batter and the frosting. This recipe is vegan-compatible by substituting soy milk for the dairy milk in the frosting. My vegan DD loved the brownies, and took four home with her. Thanks, Marian!

So moist and delicious!  The frosting was a little rich for my taste, but good.  Next time may try less cocoa in the frosting. I was scared at first when mixing the brownie ingredients. I thought it was way too dry...but the zucchini worked its magic and it turned out wonderful.  Family loved them. Thank you!

Sorry this recipe didn't work for me.  Maybe I didn't bake it long enough?  It was gooey and the frosting was watery.  IF I were to make it again I would bake it longer and use less milk for the frosting, adding more at the end if needed.

I made this yesterday and had my son, daughter, and husband try these WITHOUT mentioning the Zucchini ~they all came back for more. After getting their approval on the brownies, I filled them in on the zuchinni...they were very surpised, but it didn't deter them from wanting more! I'm THRILLED to find another use for zucchini other than the usual zucchini bread.

There are lots of options with this recipe.  I have a VERY picky 2-year-old and he loves these.  I've made them very healthy using the following substitutions: 1/2 Cup applesauce instead of oil, 1 cup blended oatmeal for 1 of the cups of flour, lowered the sugar to 1 cup, and 1/2 cup finely grated carrot.  And I skip the frosting.  He really believes he's eating cake for breakfast.  :)  Great!

WOW! I would never believe there was zucchini in these if I didn't make them myself. What a great excuse to indulge in some chocolate. Very rich an chocolaty. I did use 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c applesauce and instead of nuts I used chocolate chips. Delish, thanks!

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe...I followed it exactly and found the flavor to be way too bland...and to zucchini-ish.  The dough was great, but once it was cooked it seemed to lose it's flavor.  I'm surethe frosting would make them taste a lot better, but in my opinion if the brownie itself can't stand alone why waste time with the frosting.

I've never wished I had more zucchini in my garden before, but these are SO good that I will plant more next year just for the brownies.  I substituted apple sauce for oil. Hands down the best brownies I've ever had!

So good! I used Splenda in place of regular sugar and they came out great! I did have to add a little water so I could stir the mix, but my zucchini had been cut the previous night so it might have dried out a bit.

Great recipe! A little cakier than I like my brownies, but wonderful all the same. Didn't tell my kids what was in it and they licked the pan clean...a great way to sneak in an extra serving of veggies!

Amazing!  My boyfriend doesn't like Zucchini and he loved these!  I'm glad I read the last few reviews before I made them because I honestly thought I was doing something wrong--the batter (if you can call it that) was SO dry I swore I missed something; but it's true that the zucchini moistens the batter during baking.  Make sure to REALLY mix the batter, even though it's so dry, because mine had some salty/sweet spots, but I wouldn't add or change a thing about this recipe!  Delicious and you don't feel so guilty because they're made with zucchini :)

These were fantastic! My veggie hating kids loved them and had seconds. They do seem very dry when you are "pouring" the batter into the pan, but they come out perfect after baking. I am going to freeze some zucchini in two cup packs just for this recipe!

These were sooo good.  My batter was perfect and poured right into the cake pan.  My batter wasnt dry at all.  I used a microplane to shred my zucchini so it was super fine and doing it this way really put a ton of moisture into my brownies.  I got a  cake consistancy though not brownies at all.  I followed the directions to a T.  Next time I am going to shred my zucchini a normal size instead of shredding it so fine, and see if I get more of a brownie texture.  But cake or brownie theese were sooooo moist and the frosting was very good as well.  Thank you for posting these.  I will definatly make them again!

Awesome!!!!  They are moist and the frosting is amazing.  More of a cake then brownie, but I don't care.  My family gobbled them up before I told them there was zucchini in them.  My 7 year old son said he would eat his veggies everyday now!

The texture was fine - like a brownie.  But the flavor was just yuk.  I can't pinpoint the exact problem, but I won't ever make them again and I am very tempted to throw out the entire batch.

These are great. I did not change anything, followed the recipe exactly and was very impressed. These are the new hit in the house and they went over fabulously at groups too. Everyone says (including the kids) "these have zuccini in them?" they never knew!

these came out very cakey but my zucchini was super fresh from the garden to the grater to the bowl. I also did not care for the icing and will use my own fav brownie icing in future. Still, all in all, a great recipe for using up zukes that have taken over the garden.

These are the best brownies I have ever had.  I did add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the brownies and a pinch of salt to the frosting.  Also, my kids are little and do not like nuts so I added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of walnuts.

Ok these are awesome! At first when I took them out of the oven, I took a whiff of them and I smelled zucchini and chocolate which was a little disconcerting. I used Chocolate Frosting I, for the frosting because I had used it before and I find it's easy to make and tastes great. I just finished a brownie and you can't taste the zucchini at all, but the fact that I know it's there makes me feel good because not only am I eating a delicious dessert, but I'm getting some more veggies into my diet.

Made this recipe many times, and people always LOVE them!  ****TIP*** I've made this recipe with both fresh grated zucchini, and with shredded zucchini I've frozen in 2 cup portions. They both work really well, but the thawed frozen zucchini (with all of the liquid in the package) is a bit easier to mix, and the zucchini is a little more hidden in the brownies- which is what my older son prefers!

I followed the recipe exactly as is- except no nuts. It seemed dry mixing it, but I knew it would use the liquid from the zucchini. These turned out so amazing- I was trying to use zucchini recipes to use up my garden surplus, but I would actually buy zucchini just to make this one!

I made these a little lower in fat/cal. by reducing the sugar and adding applesauce in place of oil and adding whole wheat flour in place of white.  I did however add chocolate chips:) They were very moist and brownie like.  My husband and I both loved them! I will be making these again instead of regular browines... a little more fiber:)  Thank you!

I made these for the first time yesterday. When I make them again I will do the following: grate the zucchini very finely so more moisture is available to the mixture before it is baked. I added 1/4 C more oil to eliminate the dryness before I was able to spread it in the pan.  I think the problems with dryness depend on how much moisture is in the zucchini itself.  No complaints about how it turned out - tasty, moist, and I didn't put the nuts in so they're easy to cut.

Help Me!!!I'm alone in the house with these brownies. I made them at 8pm last night and have eaten a whole row! Spectacular! I used half splenda and half sugar. I had to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil but I don't imagine that made much of a difference. I also subbed pecans for walnuts. I only had about 11/2 cups icing sugar so the icing is just a tad bittersweet but it is fabulous! Forget zucchini bread! Great texture, flavour and the icing is perfect! I did not add an egg and I am glad I didn't!

This was awesome. I added 2 eggs and didn't frost it.  I even had some for breakfast with my coffee. Very moist and cake like.                            Pat

I was kind of scared beacuse the mixture was very dry and crumbly before adding the zucchini. They turned out really great! I think they would be good without the frosting even but who doesn't love sugary creamy frosting!

Never made brownies from scratch and these were perfect. Not a huge sweet fan, so I enjoyed that these were not too sweet. For the second (and multiple other batches) I cut the frosting recipe in half.

I do not frost these, simply because I do not like frosted brownies & they are fantastic! They are my 10 year olds favorite brownie, the only change I make is to use applesauce in place of the oil.

All I can say is "wow!" The zucchini ingredient surprised everyone! My mom who isn't one to mix vegetables with a dessert recipe was shocked! I've already gotten requests for more brownies!

I was so dissapointed. This looked so good and from the reviews I was excited to make it.  While I was making it I thought WOW this is so dry. I even went and checked online again to make sure I didn't miss anything like an egg??  I read others reviews again where they said they too wondered about adding an egg. But it turned out ok so I didn't add an egg either. But when it came to the part of folding in the zucchini, I couldn't fold it? It was crumbly, I had to smash the zucchini to get enough moisture to stir it.  I finally added a 1/4 cup sourcream and 2 tablespoons more oil to at least get a real thick batter.  At that point it was still like pressing/thick spreading... it into the pan instead of a batter.  I cooked it and the flavor is great but it is really dry. like a dry cake not a brownie.  I am going to look for ways I can tweek this to make it more brownie like.  Maybe my zucchini was to dry?  I grated it fresh? Im not sure what happened.  Sorry I hate to give it a lower rating but thats how it was for me.

These really are great!  I made half the recipe and put in an 8 x 8, I wish I had made the entire recipe because they are going fast.  I did sub splenda baking sugar for the sugar and half applesauce half oil for the oil.  In the frosing I used half splenda baking sugar and half powdered sugar.  I sprinkled the nuts on the frosting instead of putting in the brownies. Mine were very brownie like I did not think they were cakey.

Absolutely scrumptious! My family ate it up like there was no tomorrow. I substitued the frosting with a peanut butter frosting. My hubby loves Reese's Peanut Butter Cups so the frosting was a big hit with him. Overall, a great recipe and one that I will use year after year.

This recipe is more like a cake so next time I would omit the walnuts.  No need to add eggs.  It is a delicious and relatively healthy recipe.  The frosting is great and tasty.  My kids love it and it is their new favorite.

I made it just as the recipe called for. It was good but more like wet fudge than brownie. Maybe I used to much zucchini. It sure didn't look like the photo.

I decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 cup.  The brownies were WAY too sweet! (makes me stick to my stomach)  Maybe I should omit the icing or use a lot less icing.  If I try it again, I would decrease the sugar even more and use applesauce instead of the oil.

very skeptical when I made the 'batter' but follow through! it turns out beautifully. this is a rich one and I won't make it that often. I did notice that this batter is vegan and the frosting can be made into a vegan recipe, if desired. I would never, but it's just interesting to note.

These brownies are amazing. I followed the recipe exactly other then leaving out the nuts and they turned out wounderful. You wouldn't even know there is zucchini in them. I did cheat and use an already made frosting. My husband raved!!

So good- no one believed they had all that zucchini in them! To make them a little more healthy I... used 1/4 c olive oil & 1/4 c veg oil; used 1 c raw sugar; and substituted 1 c whole wheat pastry flour for 1 of the cups of all purpose flour. I didn't tell my family what the main ingredient was til after they devoured them!!

My brownies ended up tasting like zucchini, which was surprising, since other reviewers said you couldn't taste the zucchini at all.  Maybe it was because my zucchini was so watery?  I had to throw them out after the first serving.  It was unfortunate because the texture was perfect and they were very moist!  I'll stick to getting my vegetables during dinner, not dessert.

Tastes just like regular brownies!  I have very fuzzy eaters and never thought they would eat zuchini until this recipe.  My zuchinni was a little old/dry so I added 3 T of applesauce.  Be sure to store in a sealed container since they tend to dry out faster than regular brownies.  Many thanks Kelly.

Rich and Delicious!!! Made this exactly as stated with no changes. My hubby loves frosted brownies and he had no idea these were made with zucchini. Even my 2 yr. old granddaughter said they were "the yummiest brownies ever!"

These are really yummy.  Better than any choc zucchini cake I've ever had.  They are rich and ooey gooey and you can barely taste the zucchini.  I would make them again!

Made exactly as given & thought it was good, but....hubby really liked them. I don't think it needs all the icing, so next time will make 1/2 recipe for a 9x13 pan. Also, I had to bake longer because it seemed running in the center. You wouldn't know it had zucchin unless you read the recipe. I don't think I'll put all the sugar in next time either, but add maybe some cinnamon. It is a keeper. I think I may also try others suggestion & use applesauce or go without icing completely.

I followed the recipe exactly (except no walnuts).  They were very good.  My husband liked them too.  I felt like I could smell (and at times taste) the zucchini but it might be all in my head.  My husband didn't know about the zucchini and he never mentinoed anything.  I will make these again.  They're great especially for kids with egg allergies.

Oh yum!  I made this recipe because it had a frosting recipe, which was so rich and delicious.  You can't even taste the zucchini; they just make the brownies so moist!

My family loves sweets of any type so this weekend I made 3 zucchini recipes found on allrecipies.  This one was a huge disappointment.  The texture was sugary and grainy in spots, probably from the "no egg" recipe.  The brownie itself was very bland.  The cocoa didn't add enough chocolate flavor (maybe an addition of chocolate chips would have helped.  We ate it warm with ice cream, and the ice cream was the best part.  Don't bother with this one...make your regular brownie recipe and use the zucchini in other things.

These are the best brownies-from-scratch I have ever made or eaten!  I'd given up on scratch brownies & for years didn't make them.  But when allrecipes sent this in an email I couldn't resist! None of the guests could figure out the secret ingredient-- you can't see it or taste it, as hard as you may try.  Amazing!!

OMG, are these ever good. I followed the ingredients to a T, and it turned out great. Next time I make this, I will let the brownie part cool for about a half a day, then put the frosting on them and let them sit in the fridge overnight. Trust me, after they sit for a day, they can't be beat. Have no idea why some people complained about a veggie after taste.

My husband won't eat anything zucchini-related. Not even bread. I made this for the kids and he requested it for his birthday (I never mentioned the ingredients). It's his new favorite cake, and he has no idea... ;)

NUMMY!! The only slight change I made was using 1/2 cup melted butter flavored shortening instead of the oil.  You can't even taste the zucchini.  I did follow another reviewers suggestion and coat the pan with cocoa powder.  It added a great flavor too.

This is a very good brownie recipe! Very moist and they keep well (if they last). I enjoy letting my kids know that you can put veggies in tasty recipes and they have fun telling their friends that they are eating zucchini when they eat these! I have made them as written and also have subbed 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour and they turned out well too! Thanks for a great option for my zucchini! Update: I made these again last night and did not get the same results as all of the other times I have made these. 1. I did not use a mixer this time. 2. I made them at night and waited until this morning to frost them. I ended up with a much more of a dry cakey result. Thought I'd share as this isn't how they were the other times I've made them as you can see from my 1st review.

I've already rated this recipe but I would like to add a footnote. I made these about 3 weeks ago. It made far too many for me so I took half the brownies, put them in a smaller pan, covered them with foil, and froze them. I thawed them last night. They held up extremely well frozen and retained their moisture when thawed.

Well, I am very glad I decided to review this the day after I made the brownies. When I first tasted the brownies after letting them cool for a bit, I didn't think they were nearly moist or chocolatey enough. I can't blame the lack of moisture on the recipe because I only had a cup and a half of zucchini on hand for it, but I had decided that I would add some chocolate chips next time to make up for the lack of chocolatey flavor. However, after leaving them alone for almost 24 hours, I had another one and it tasted way better! So I guess leaving them sitting for a while helps. In the end, I was very happy with the way this turned out. Who knew veggies and chocolate would work so well together? I may add the chocolate chips next time anyway, just to see...

I made this exactly as written but it came out like a cake.  My batter was not stiff so perhaps the zucchini was not drained enough. The cake was moist and delicious everyone loved it and couldn't believe it was made with zucchini.  They all thought it was a cake so I didn't tell them any different.

the brownie came out really rich, but that was because i added about 200g of chocolate bits into it. the parts without the chocolate tasted rather.. well, tasteless. i strongly suggest adding chocolate bits into it, you'll get a darn good brownie. it didn't turn out cakelike at all, surprisingly. very fudgey and gooey. yum!   i cut the sugar into 200g instead of 300 g(i usually cut half the sugar for all the recipes on this site), and that was a wrong choice. the brownie wasn't sweet enough! maybe it was tasteless because of this point..so follow the recipe on this one.  i let the zucchini sit with the sugar oili mixture for a while, and it become really liquidy. so try doing that if you have problems mixing the batter.  didn't make the frosting so can't comment on that, but i drowned it in hershey's syrup instead. =) i did it in a 9x9 pan and i thought the height was just nice. i don't know how i'm going to finish such a big pan especially since i can't eat more than a slice of it cause it is just tooo rich! but sinfully good!

These were very good! I made them as cupcakes so I could wrap them individually and freeze them and have one occasionally. They are really good even after thawing from frozen. Actually, I think they were better thawed then fresh from the oven. I prefer a cakier brownie so next time I might add an egg and make them like actual brownies instead of cupcakes. very good. Oh and I didnt frost them because I don't really like frosting on brownies so I'm rating it just on the brownie without the frosting.

really great brownies and pretty easy to make. tastes great and so moist! i was nervous about the texture because the zucchini was not pureed, but its great and i don't think anyone would even notice the zucchini! applesauce is a great idea...i'll have to try that next time, making it even healthier! thanks for a great recipe!

Oh wow, these were great! Made just a half recipe today and I added 1 egg to the batter since I was craving cake-like brownies. Also, I threw the zucchini in the food processor until it was all finely chopped. Saved a lot of time compared to shredding it all. I think it helped release more moisture to the batter too!! Yum!!

Can't hardly tell there are veggies in here... next time I make them I will have to increase my oven temp just a bit (I'm sure it's just my oven).  We dusted them with powdered sugar instead of frosting.

I can't believe how good these were!  I subbed apple sauce for oil and didn't miss a thing.  I will try subbing a little whole wheat flour next time.    The batter is dry and you need to spread them in the pan but the zukes release their moisture as they bake.

This was a great recipe. I don't like too many vegies, and zucchini would be one of them that I don't like. Next time I am going to try to make it with the baby food prunes for the oil like someone suggested. I don't like them either but it's worth trying!

Absolutely delicious! Since it was too hot to turn on the oven, I made these in the microwave. Divided the recipe in two and used my Tuppeware dishes for the microwave, 6 minutes and they were PERFECT. Nice and gooey! Thank you for sharing!

These brownies are a new family favorite.  My daughter is on an egg-free, milk-free diet and it is hard to find a brownie recipe that doesn't use 2-3 eggs.  The frosting makes the recipe.  My whole family loves these brownies.

This makes a great cake, but I miss the dense texture of a brownie.  My revisions achieved a denser texture that held together better, but it still needs more work to get even denser and a deeper chocolate flavor.  In the meantime I hope you like this.  Quantities aren't listed if I used what's in the original recipe; results may vary w/the zucchini (mine was a huge one that I grew); mix/fold things, don't beat:  (A) Mix together 1 slightly beaten lg. egg + oil + 1 C. 5 T. sugar + vanilla ext. + salt + 12 oz. peeled zucchini (grate it w/small holes ~1/8" dia.; incl. the juices).  I let the wet ingredients sit ~12 minutes while measuring the dry ingredients.  (B) Sift together 1-1/4 c. all-purp. flour +  1/4 c. whole wheat pastry flour + cocoa powder + only 1/2 t. baking soda.  (C) Add walnuts + dry ingredients to the wet; fold to mix.  Batter will be thin enough to pour.  (D) Bake ~20-22 min. (toothpick inserted should have some crumbs clinging to it); remove from oven, place pan in cold water bath, add 2 trays of ice to the water bath to help stop the cooking process.

My family did not care for the texture of the zucchini.  They said it was like having cocunut in their brownies which they don't happen to like.  They also said the texture was more like cake than brownies.

Excellent!  I made these last night and doubled the recipe.  I baked them in a jelly roll pan for 25 minutes.  I can't think of anything I would change.  My co-workers absolutely love them.  Over half the pan is gone!  Definitely a keeper.

Very moist, would definetly not use as much oil next time though.  I was out of applesauce at the time.  If I make these again, I will use applesauce for 1/2 the oil.

I wasn't impressed the first night I made them. They seem to be much better the next day. The frosting is pretty good. They're very good to have zucchini in them and I'll definitely enjoy them. I do wish they were more chewy and not quite as cake like. I did follow the recipe exactly.

Came out Ooey Gooey good....when added with the homemade icing recipe.  This was more of a crumbly, lighter cake consistency rather than a dense "brownie".  But it was good!

We followed the recipe exactly and it was cake, not brownies. I'm not sure how people are using this recipe as is and coming up with brownies. Maybe we'll try again somehow.  The cake was good but since we wanted brownies I'm only giving it a three star rating.

I made mini-muffin type brownies without frosting to put into school lunches.  Great!  Be careful not to fill the muffin tins too much or they will overflow.

Made just as the recipe states and these babies were just great!  It seems like such an odd recipe for brownies and I was a bit skeptical as I was mixing them but keep in mind as soon as you add the zucchini, they are perfect brownie batter consistency and tastes superb!  My hubby ate two in a row and said he didn't even know there was zucchini in them.  Thanks so much for sharing!  I'm finally able to use up all the zucchini from my garden!

These brownies are good. I like the idea of the zucchini in them, a good way to use zucchini, specially this time of year. Kids don’t know they are getting some veggies. Thank for the recipe. I didn't frost them, just powdered sugar.

These were amazing.  I made a double batch because I had so much zucchini to use up.  I switched WW flour for 1/4 of the flour and a jar of pureed baby food (apple, cherry pear or something) we had sitting unused for half the oil.  Added 1 egg to then entire double batch.  Subbed chocolate chips for nuts.  My mix was very dry and crumbly - impossibly to mix by hand before mixing in the zucchini, but as soon as I did it all came together.

These were really good but turned out more like cake than a brownie.  They were moist and fluffy.  I substituted applesauce for the oil.  I also didn't make the frosting (trying to save some calories) but put chocolate sauce and a bit of whipped cream on the top - it was great.

Absolutely excellent! My nephews couldn't believe it contained zucchini. Don't worry about how dry it is before you add in the zucchini.  The moisture from the zucchini will help get everything mixed together.

Excellent results, and I've made them twice already.  Moisture content of my garden-grown zucchinis varied, so first batch came out gooey-good.  Second batch was brownie-y good.  The frosting amazes me; I'll never make it any other way.  Add the milk a little at a time, though, to avoid chocolate soup. Definitely will add this one to my Tried and True 3-ring binder. Many thanks.

Wonderful fudge like brownies.  Didn't even use the icing.  My girls couldn't believe there was zucchini in it.  Definitely a keeper.

The second attempt I followed the recipe to the letter.  I still find the end product crumbly and not much like brownies.  They are good, but I kind of had to grab a handful and compress it to keep it from falling apart.

I followed the recipe exactly...and even made the icing, it was great!  The best brownie I've made from scratch, in fact even when zuchinni is out of season I will probably purchase it at the grocery store and make my brownies like this!  Next time I will try subbing applesauce for the oil just to make it a little healthier.

Very good, the frosting was a little runny followed directions to the "T". I also put walnuts on top as I don't like steamed nuts! :)

My 14 Year old told me she wouldn't eat them because you don't put veggies in junk food.  She tried them the next day and said she was wrong - they were really good! I followed the recipe EXACTLY also.  There was no need for eggs -super moist.  I will leave out the nuts next time though just a personal texture issue.  I may also try the suggestions of less sugar, chocolate chips, and/or applesauce.  They all sound good.  Thanks for the recipe!  My neighbors love it too.

Good, but not fantastic. Didn't taste the zucchini so that was good and they were moist.  If you have left over Zucchini to use this would be a good way.

I have made these twice in the past several weeks and everyone, from family to co-workers have raved about them. To make them even healthier, I used applesauce instead of oil and substituted 1/2 cup of the flour for wheat flour. I also cut back on the sugar, which doesn't affect the sweetness because of the frosting. One thing I will do differently next time is throw in a handful of mini chocolate chips. Definitely a keeper and a great way to disguise vegetables for picky eaters who love sweets!

These brownies are amazing!  I followed the recipe almost exactly and they did not turn out cakey at all - just very moist and fudgey.  The only thing I changed was to add half a jar of raspberry preserves to the icing and 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips to the brownies.  It's true that the batter seems extremely dry at first(I actually wondered if I had made a mistake with the ingredients until I mixed in the zucchini and saw the batter get surprisingly moist), but these turn out great and this will definitely be my new go-to brownie recipe.

These are SO GOOD!  I wouldn't call them brownies; more of a cake.  I used applesauce in place of the oil, and used chocolate chips in place of the nuts (about 1 cup of chips).  Didn't even make the frosting - didn't need it!

Amazing! I didn't make the icing, but they were good enough without it. Whatever you do, don't add or subtract anything from this recipe! The batter is a little scary (very thick and dry-seeming), but the zucchini releases its moisture as it bakes. Don't add any eggs, and don't overbake! I actually took them out a little earlier than I normally would, which was a good thing because they came out absolutely perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe.  I've made them several times and no one has any idea that they have zucchini in them.  I made just a few changes too.  I thought the flavor would turn out better using melted butter in place of the oil, and I placed that in the blender with the zucchini and sugar.  It's so much faster then grating the zucchini, plus I don't like the chunks.  I also used whole wheat flour (a little something to make them "healthier", sort of).  

One thing that might be helpful to those of you who want to use eggs:  Do not over-mix the batter.  If you whip any air into it, they will turn into a cake-like texture instead of a brownie texture.

The first try didn't go so well for me! I ended up with brownies that were dry, with some of the flour/cocoa mixture completely powder! I decided to put my shredded zucchini in the food processor for a finer version.  Then I added a 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. AMAZING!!!

Really popular with the group of gals I made them for.  We ate them with coffee in the morning (we decided that the addition of zucchini and using whole wheat pastry flour could move them into the realm of foods healthy enough for morning consumption).  I thought the frosting was a bit much - too sweet for me.  But, the gals who ate them with me loved it as is.  Next time, I'll try adding a handful of chocolate chips and no frosting.  All in all, a great treat!  For those of you interested in making foods a bit healthier, I highly recommend trying these with whole wheat pastry flour.  It works great (I used only ww pastry flour, no white flour) and ups the fiber content considerably while adding the benefits of whole grain.

Oh my God, delicious.  I used whole wheat flour and subbed chocolate chips for the nuts since I don't like nuts in brownies.  Next time I will use the small holes of the grater for the zucchini, but it turned out fine.  Very fudgy inside with a crisp edge.  So good and so easy.

Excellent.  I made 1/2 batch and cut the sugar in the brownie batter to a little less than 1/2 cup, also used chocolate chips instead of the nuts.  They are still plenty sweet with the frosting and chips.  Will definitely make them again & again.

This is got to be the best and easier brownies I have ever made.  Was just devoured by the office.  Need to add about 1 or 2 extra tablespoons of oil to the sugar, pretty dry recipe until you add the zucchini.  I also topped the frosting with a cup of finely chopped walnuts.  Good job Marian!!

I'm always looking for ways to sneak veggies into my picking eating family.  (I'm not saying these are healthy due to the zucchini, but certainly better than a traditional recipe.)  I was worried that you would be able to see the green from the zucchini, so I used a super-fine grater and after baking the zucchini was visually undetectable.  I also added the zucchini to the wet ingredients, otherwise it would have been too dry to mix properly.  These turned out very moist and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Absolutely the best brownies ever!!!!  No need for frosting.  They are so moist.  Just sprinkle a little powdered sugar on them and they are good to go!

These are the best brownies ever - I will never make boxed brownies again. Kids never knew about the zucchini. My daughter boycots greens and loooooooved them. Awesome - makeing 2x a week they can't get enough. Frost before the kids see them - don't look so appealing.YUM

Awesome recipe!  I like to add 1 or two teaspoons of ground cloves, a great combo with chocolate and zucchini!

This was a very easy to make and tasty treat.  I followed the recipe exactly (a moment of worry before I added the zucchini, of course) and these turned out perfect!  No vegetable aftertaste and if I hadn't known I added it then even I wouldn't have thought they had zucchini.  A few where shared with people who avoid vegetables and they also were none-the-wiser.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and mine were very cakey. I thought about using applesauce instead of oil, but wanted them to be more of a brownie-consistency, so I didn't want to mess things up. I like that there are no eggs (we have allergies!). My son always says he doesn't like zucchini, but he sure loved these! I added a cream cheese icing from a container because I was pressed for time...I highly recommend that! You definitely need icing though because they don't look too pretty on top.

These were awesome !!!  The family had no idea that there was zucchini in this recipe and they continue to rave about them being the best thing between a brownie and a cake.  Don't go crazy when you see that the consistency before you add the zucchini is that of a cake mix out of a box.  You will love it - I might try using half oil half applesauce next time.  Thanks for a great treat !!!

These were absolutely excellent! Can't even tell there is zucchini in them. I went exactly by the recipe, but I plan to fiddle with it to make the next batch healthier. Thanks a ton!

These brownies were great, though I had my doubts as the "batter" was basically sand with worms, as my babysitter coined it. Very dry batter that moistens as the zuke bakes. Mine were a little lumpy and did not hold together as I would have liked but MY KIDS LOVED THEM and never knew there was a veggie lurking under the surface! Thanks for a great, easy, yummy way to use up all the zucchini in my fridge!

These are great.  I like cake like brownies so I did add an egg.  I topped them with an easy chocolate pan frosting that I use a lot.  Family loved them.

Amazing!  I followed the recipe with a tiny twist - I did mix the zucchini with the sugar at the beginning; sprinkled top with semi-sweet chocolate chips; used whipping cream instead of milk - had some to use up.  Amazing!  Family couldn't believe it had zucchini in it.  This is a keeper!

Great recipe!  I didn't change a thing.  Fabulous way to get some extra veggies into the kids without them even knowing it.  Like others have mentioned, the batter is VERY dry, but once you add the zucchini, it moistens the batter right up.

Finally! I have never been a fan of zucchini, but recently brought one home when a friend grew an abundance in her garden.  Wondering what to do with it, I searched and came up with this recipe. I will now be asking her for any extra zucchini she may have.  Thanks a bunch!  These are awesome!

They seemed really dry as I put them in the pan but I guess the zucchini adds moisture as they cook.  Very good.

Wow - great way to eat zucchini. (Or keep it a secret...) I too worried about how dry the mix was before cooking. After, it was almost TOO moist. I refrigerated it to firm it up and it wound up with a delicious very fudgy texture. Loved 'em!

Amazingly good. Both the frosting and the brownie were delicious. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the texture is more like cake than a brownie. I made the recipe exactly as stated. Still, it was a very delicious dessert that all of the adults and children in my family loved. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Unbelievably good! No one knew they were eating zucchini either! My husband, who does not eat zucchini(well, he does now), and my kids said the brownies were moist and rich tasting. Do I tell them what's in it? Well, they haven't asked yet...heeheehee.  I was surprised that I couldn't even see the zucchini in it after baking...it was like it "melted" into the brownies providing the perfect amount of moistness.

I was a bit worried these brownies would not turn out. The mixture was very dry. I added pecans instead of walnuts, and used the Hershey's chocolate frosting recipe. The brownie's turned out very moist - and were delicious. The texture is different from traditional brownies due to the grated zucchini.

These did turn out more cakey than fudgy, even though I followed the recipe closely (and did not add any eggs), but either way, my family loved them and we will definitely be making this recipe again!  I substituted white whole wheat flour for one cup of the flour and light brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the sugar.  I also had to use dark cocoa for 3 tbsp in the icing, since I ran out of the regular kind, but it is really good with the dark chocolate icing as well!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have two things to say. First, this did not turn out like brownies at all (I was surprised, since someone said these were not cake-like at all).  However, it made the B-E-S-T chocolate cake EVER!!! That's why I gave it 5 stars. I can't tell at all that there's zucchini in it - great for my picky 3-year-old.  AWESOME recipe, I think I'll make it again this weekend!  But it should be called cake, not brownies!

Another great use for zucchini.  Skipped the frosting and instead sprinkled the top with toffee bits and mini chocolate chips before baking.  My husband loves them!

We loved them! I didn't use walnuts and made only half of the frosting so it wouldn't be too thick.  Husband and daughter don't eat vegies so this was a great way to get the vegies to them - they are really enjoying them! just don't know there is zucchini in them LOL.

Absolutely wonderful brownies. I followed the recipe exactly as listed and by far the best brownies I have ever had. No need to add eggs, not listed dont add them. mixture will look very dry until you add the zucchini, moisture from zucchini makes the batter. I had nothing but compliments at work when I shared these. Have made 2 pans in less than a week. THANKS for a great recipe.

Hands down, the best brownie I've ever tasted.  No, there is no veggie aftertaste, and no it doesn't need eggs. And people, please don't change the recipe and give it a low rating because it doesn't taste right or turns out rubbery.  Please. My niece and I made this exactly as written, and admittedly, I was worried because it seemed veerryy dry, but once we folded in the shredded zucchini, it started to look more like what you would expect. It is a more cake-like brownie, but I have no problem with that whatsoever.  Simply delicious. Thanks for an awesome ~keeper~ recipe.  They are going with me to our family reunion next month for sure!

Delicious!! The only change I made was to add the zucchini to the sugar/oil/vanilla mixture so the batter would not be as dry as described by other reviewers and it turned out just like any other brownie batter. Will definitely make these again and again!!

Delicious brownies! Thanks for the recipe! I followed the recipe except I omitted the nuts. Also - a fun tip: instead of flouring your pan, try sugar instead! It makes for a sweet crunchy edge! Yum!

This was very good, per my husband!  I used frozen zucchini from last years garden. Did not drain the liquid off.  Did not use nuts. Used can of Pillsbury  frosting. This was a very sneeky way to get my husband to eat his veggies. A keeper.

These would be good in theory, but even though I followed the recipe exactly, they did not turn out very well. I think I should have let the mixture set for a bit after folding in the zucchini to get a moister batter. However, I am very hesitant to try this again.

YUM!  I told someone that there was no zucchini in them so that he would try one and afterwards he said "They were pretty good."  For him that is a compliment.  ha ha. He didn't even realize there was zucchini in them.  I was spetical when the batter was so dry before I added the zucchini, but I was proven wrong.  If I would change one thing I would make sure I only put a little milk in at a time for the icing.  The icing got a bit runny and more sugar was needed to thicken it up.

Not bad, but was expecting more chocolate flavor.  You can definitely see and taste the zucchini, but I was fine with it.  Omitted the nuts; my preference.  I was if-y about the recipe since my batter was thick...I had to press it into the pan since it didn't spread. More cakey than a fudgy brownie (a chocolate zucchini cake), but I liked that too.  I also tried subbing in applesauce for the oil and I think I like the oil better (even though it isn't that healthy).  Spread a no-dairy chocolate frosting on top.  Good.  Would probably make again with applesauce for a LESS-guilt chocolate fix.

These are the best brownies I have ever made!  I was so supprised that you can't even tell they are made with zucchini.  When I first mixed the oil with the dry ingrediants I was worried that they were going to be to dry.  They zucchini was difficult to get mixed in at first, but once it was I was delighted to see the batter turn into the perfect consistancy.  They baked up perfectly and the frosting is amazing!  Very simple to make and a big time winner!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe for too many zucchini in the garden. It's vegan too if you omit the icing.   After I mix in the zucchihi, I allow it to sit 3 or 4 minutes to release it's liquid. I stir again before putting it in the pan.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar instead of icing for a healthier treat.  I've also used a seeded summer squash to make this recipe.

So, so recipe.  I did try a lot of replacements with it so it may have been my fault.  I replaced the oil with applesauce and used 1/2 splenda 1/2 sugar.  It was a little dense and just didn't taste all the great to me.  I am unlikely to try it again with oil and sugar.

Fabulous!  I made it in a 9x9 pan and cooked it a bit longer.  No need for icing in this one.  Make sure you use a wooden spoon to mix and not a whisk.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I have to admit I was a little skeptical too about zucchini brownies, but these were the best brownies I have ever tasted! I can't keep away from them! The icing definitely makes them but the whole recipe is phenomenal! The best way to use up that zucchini from the garden! (Although not the healthiest, but a great indulgent treat!) *Note: the batter was very dry, actually it was just crumbs, I had to add 1/4 cup of milk before adding the zucchini and it turned out great!

This recipe is awesome!! I didn't change a thing and they were amazing (frosting included).  I think they got more fudgey the 2nd day (and to me tasted better and more brownie-like), but they were just as great the 1st day also.  The 'batter' is super dry before adding the zucchini, but no worries the zucchini adds all the moisture.  You don't have to add eggs or anything else - this was no misprint by the author/originator.

Made this for my two oldest boys and their 2 very picky friends this afternoon. 5 and 7 year olds. All they could say was how good these brownies were. I waited til after they were done to inform them there was zucchini in them.

After using this site 100's of times, this is the 1st time I feel compelled to rate a recipe as they are absolutely unbelieveable! Only substitutions I made were 1/2 applesauce for the oil, and Choc chips for the nuts.

I would call this cake, not brownies, but it is delicious anyway! I used just 1 cup of sugar and half whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier, and it was great. The icing was perfect. Next time I may stir in chocolate chips instead of making icing just for a change. I grated the zucchini very finely; there was no trace of it either in terms of taste or texture. Great recipe, and one I'll use often in summer.

I thought that these were only so-so.  Granted, I made a few changes (mostly b/c my pantry wasn't as well stocked as I had thought prior to my bought of insomnia!).  I threw in a handful of chocolate chips instead of the walnuts, used a combo of oil and apple sauce as well as a combo of Splenda and sugar.  My problem with the recipe is that it wasn't chocolatey enough for me.  I wanted a little more umph in the flavor department. Perhaps I should have made the frosting.  Maybe I will do that when I get home from work and update my rating.

The first time I made these I was taking them to a friend's house who has a child with a dairy allergy, therefore I omitted the frosting (and the nuts, just because I don't like nuts in my brownies).  They were great!  One of the other guests said she could taste the zucchini once it was mentioned to her, but I couldn't and neither could anyone else.  The kids devoured them.  The batter was VERY VERY dry going in, but came out delicious and fudgy.  I'm making them again today and will serve with the frosting this time.  This time I added a little more zucchini (about 1/3 extra cup) and the batter wasn't as dry.  Great recipe for vegans and those with dairy or egg allergies.

I made these brownies as directed but ommitted the nuts. No blandness, no crumbliness, no problems! I just sprinkled choc chips on top when they came out of the oven and they were great. I made these brownies yesterday at 8:30pm for a church potluck. It's 7:50pm and I'm starting another batch- I wanted more than one! ;)

Good way to get a little bit of veggies into a chocolate fan!  I peeled my zucchini ahead of time, To save time, I didn't take time to make the frosting.  I think it probably would have added to it.  I just dusted with powdered sugar instead.  Will probably make again.  Thanks!

First, I always peel my zucchini before I make anything with it. Doing this eliminates the green give-aways that so many others complain of. I omitted the walnuts because I hate them. The recipe says to spread, not pat into the pan, so I turned up the kitchen aid until it looked like brownie batter. This of course, also chopped up the zucchini shreds more. They were not cake like, but not like fudge brownies from a box either. Somewhere in the middle. The brownies were good though, no green aftertaste, but I make spinach brownies all the time so I may not notice. I did think that the frosting was more sugary than chocolaty tasting, but that may just be me.

This is the strangest brownie recipe I have ever made! It did seem a little dry and to moisten it up I added a little more zucchini (I had extra) and I felt like that did the trick. Definitely make the icing! They are delicious!

We thought these were goooooood! I mixed everything according to the recipe and realized that it was still very powdery so I added a little more oil to mix (since I had read all the other reviews not to add egg). I'd say it was about a tbsp of additional oil. I halved the recipe and baked in 8x8 pan. These were really good! Thanks so much for sharing!

Wow! followed the recipe with no egg. batter was fine after adding zucchini.  added choc chips instead of nuts and also made frosting.  it passed by my picky family with flying colors!  I wasn't convinced you could hide a vegetable into a dessert - but this really worked!

I was very pleased with the batter before I baked these brownies, it was delicious, but once they baked you could really taste the zucchini. My husband and 3 year old are both VERY picky eaters and I'm always looking for ways to hide vegetables, but they wouldn't eat them.

I have so many zucchini from our garden and the kids were getting tired of eating it and I hate wasting anything so I was in search of a new way to make it and stumbled upon these brownies.  They are awesome.  I was worried when the batter seemed so dry but as soon as I added the zucchini it was just as moist as regular brownies.  I omitted the nuts and added choc chips so my kids would eat them.  I did not tell them there was zucchini in there and you could not tell.  It must melt during baking.  I just shredded it and you can not see it at all. Thanks for a great recipe it's a keeper.

Yummy!! Great Way to use up all that extra Zucchini from the garden. I didn't do the frosting, but I'm sure it would be out of this world! I found that we liked the zucchini best when it was Puréed in the blender, rather then grading. This is my fail safe take-along dish for any summer occasion. A real conversation food!

Our entire family loved these brownies...Grandma all the way down to 1 year old nephew! I used about 2 2/3 cups of shredded zucchini (not wanting to waste the zucchini) and it was perfectly moist. We preferred them with frosting...whcih just made them even better.

These brownies were excellent.  I did not relish the thought of shredded zucchini in my brownies so I put the zucchini in a blender before adding it to the batter.  It turned out wonderfully. The icing is the BEST.

This is a surprisingly good recipe!!  I did add a couple tablespoons of vanilla yogurt b/c the batter was too dry to mix totally or spread, but we loved the end result. My kids were thrilled that there is so sign of zucchini in the finished product (I did grate it very finely) and it had a great crumb. Making another batch today for my son's birthday.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I substitute apple sauce for half the oil and I throw in a handful of chocolate chips instead of nuts.  I don't think frosting is necessary.  My kids have no clue that they are eating zucchini - score!

Following the other users tips of what not and to do in making these just right, I made these for my daughter's class (since it is both nut and egg free due to allergies).  And for there to be an overwhelming applause by 14 four year olds--I would take that as a compliment!!

Good and chocolatey, but to me it's more like cake - just a bit shorter.   Add a couple tablespoons of soy milk if the mix is dry - I did and had no fear of disappointment.  Also, for some spice I suggest sprinkling allspice, ground cloves, and cinnamon into the batter.

Surprisingly good!  I used applesauce to replace half the oil, and I also used Splenda for about a third of the sugar.  My batter was very moist and almost a bit thin (my zucchini was quite juicy).  As such, I had to bake them for probably close to 40 minutes, but they came out very moist and delicious (though definitely cake-like).  I wasn't wild about the frosting (it was very sweet), but they definitely added something to the brownies.  Overall very good for how healthy they are.  Fun too - no one could guess what the secret ingredient was!  I'm also a big fan of the fact that the brownies themselves are vegan.  A good recipe to add to my collection.

These are so great. I took advice from others and replaced the oil with apple sauce. The boyfriend loved these at first, then I told him there was zucchini in them. Not so fond of them now. So I took the batch to work and everyone loved them. Two people requested the recipe. Fabulous!

This has to be the best brownies i've ever made! I followed the directions to a T including the frosting.  As i was waiting for the brownies to cool, i was picking at them and thinking...these dont even need the frosting!! But i added it anyways and it is just that much better! UPDATE: 4/28/14 I finally remade the brownies and do recall a slight veggie taste the first me around. But this time, several years later, they taste even better than I remember. Not even the slightest hint of veggies!! I intentionally made these for young girls I coach since they are always eating junk food! This recipe was a way to sneak in veggies. They cleaned the plate and kept asking for more!! They were in complete shock that there was zucchini in the brownies! If I need brownies, this is my recipe!!

Everyone in my house was doubtful of these. Before I added the zucchini, it was very dry but it didn't affect the results at all. They turned out delicious, moist and rich! The frosting was a bit too thin for my preference, but it was rich and added to the overall taste of the brownies.

I baked it for 30 minutes because when i checked at 25, i didn't think it looked done.  I should of just taken it out at 25 minutes..  Mine turned out really crumbly on the top... but it's still pretty moist and good.    Make sure to spread it evenly...

Surprisingly excellent recipe. My family enjoyed it very much and I will definitely make it again. Didn't change anything but the pan size, but they turned out great.

OMG I was able to get my children to eat zucchini and them not even know it.  I even tricked my neighbors.  Everyone thought they were delicious.  You really have to look hard to see the zucchini in there.  Great recipe even for kids.

Excellent recipe! At first I thought I did something wrong... the mix was VERY dry & crumbly. Once you add the zucchini it moistens the mix into a batter. Brownies taste even better the next day! Now for the icing.... doesn't get much better than this! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I made these exactly as directed, without the nuts, and all 7 of my children loved them! Even my husband, who is not much of a frosting fan, went crazy over them and told me I have to make these again. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

so yummy! I agree they are a bit cake like and I followed the recipe just like it says without using an egg.. but they are fudgey too... so it's kind of a win-win relationship.  The frosting is too tasty for it's own good. I think I will use it for other things too.

Great recipe to use up zucchini.  I thought it was kinda cakelike, but I still loved it.  Kinda like magic once you add the zucchini.  Mixture is very dry and then very batterlike.  Loved it.

I cannot believe how good these are! We had a ton of zucchini this past summer, so I made them a few times and I call them "secret surprise brownies" b/c each time I got anti-zucchini eaters into eating them, and then after told them the secret ingredient is zucchini! lol They were definitely happily surprised!

these were not exactly proper brownies,but more like a cake. The consistency wasn't fudgy enough and were just mildly sweet. Still the zucchini thing is very smart and healthy so i guess i'll give it another try

I was really surprised this turned out since the "batter" mixture was really dry - there must've been a lot of moisture in the zucchini to make this recipe turn out. I used Splenda instead of sugar, and probably should've cut down to 1 cup, as it was a bit too sweet.

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, but added about 80g of melted dutch dark chocolate.  I agree that the texture is a perfect brownie texture - moist, chewy, and fudgey, but not cakey.  But there was definitely a distinct something "not quite right" about the taste.  You could even tell by smelling them that they were suspect.  I found that there was an initial taste of vegetable, rather than an aftertaste.  But if you push through the zucchini barrier and keep eating, it's not really a problem - it just tastes like chocolate brownie.  However I took them to my friends to get their opinion, and only 2 of 8 actually liked them.  They're definitely edible but not nearly as good as normal brownies.

I've made these twice. The first time I substituted applesauce for half of the oil, and the second time I followed the recipe as written.  I didn't notice a difference, so next time I'll use the applesauce and cut down the fat.  These brownies are more cake-like, so I think frosting is a must, it makes them richer & gooier.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really, really good, and with no weird taste or texture from the zucchini.  Mine came out cake-like, though.  I added no extra liquids, and in fact used 3 cups of zucchini.  I can't complain.  With the frosting, they taste "just like chocolate cake" -- the words of my ridiculously picky 4-year-old.  Will definitely make again.

I really didn't like these at all.  The brownies tasted way too much like zucchini, and the frosting/glaze tasted like straight powdered sugar.  It must be something I did wrong because this recipe gets so many great reviews!  If anybody has any tips, feel free to contact me and I'll give these another try.

I decided to try this recipe due to the great abundance of zucchini in my garden.  I have made them twice already, and plan to freeze some zucchini to make them later on.  They are delicious!!  My daughter, who is extremely picky, and will rarely touch vegetables loved these!!  (I didn't mention to her that they contained zucchini) They do not taste vegetable-ish to me at all, in fact, I think the zucchini adds a great flavor & makes them moist & delicious.  I just peeled off the green & grated the zucchini with a cheese grater.  Big Hit!!!

Wow!  These brownies really turned out well and they are not too sweet, which I really like (I should note - I did not use the frosting). This is an excellent and delicious way to put some of that garden zucchini to use and I will definitely be making them again.

I was disappointed with this recipe after all the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, with no eggs.  I didn't add the walnuts though.  However the brownie has a strange rubbery texture which I didn't like. My husband though that they were okay.  He said it was "rubbery, but not in a bad way" (!).  Maybe it's a matter of taste.  Personally I don't like my brownies to be rubbery.

This was definitely better the second day. It turned out wonderfully, and I didn't change a thing. Don't worry about the dryness of the batter. If you mix in the zucchini as best you can, and then let the batter rest for about five minutes, it will get nice and moist and you'll have no trouble spreading it in the pan. I didn't find the cake too sweet, even with the yummy frosting. One final thing--I'd call this cake, not brownies, but that doesn't make 'em any less tasty!

Enjoyed by my preschoolers and their friends...and none of them had any clue about the zucchini.  Great as is, or to save on time and sugar intake, you can skip the frosting and just lightly sprinkle powdered sugar on the top.

Had some zucchini brownies at my sisters and loved them. Found your recipe and tried it. I had to add some water to the batter. It was very stiff. And bake them for 35 minutes, but I live at 8,000 feet so maybe that had something to do with it. All in all, I enjoyed the brownies. They were very moist.

This recipe is awesome.  A great way to use up zucchini.  These brownies are so moist.  You would never know that there is zucchini in them.  They were a big hit....sure beats boring zucchine bread.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this last night and the fam loved it!  Super easy, fast and tasty!  I also substituted the oil with applesauce and it turned out delicious!!!  Our garden is yeilding a ton of zucchini right now and I've been grating and freezing it, so I can make this in the middle of winter or early spring!

Wow, I'm impressed! I followed the recipe exactly and these are DEFINITELY more cake-like than dense/chewy/fudgy brownies. The frosting was ... the icing on the cake. My kids loved these, and so did my husband -- none of them knew there was zucchini in them. They are that good. Mmm!

these...are...SO..GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The texture is unbelievable and actually, better than other recipes which use eggs.  I accidentally "pureed" half of the zucchini, and the rest I shredded and the consistency was good.  Also, I didn't make the frosting so I don't know how they would have been with it, however they stand alone just fine without.  YUM!!!

Love these brownies!  I followed the directions completely.  They may appear dry when preparing, but they turn out just great.
I didn't frost mine and they are fabulous as is.  Thanks for the recipe and another way to use up my garden treasures!

These are pretty good. They did have more of a cake texture instead of brownie but that's ok cause I like chocolate cake too. Make sure to finely shred the zucchini so you don't get any wierd texture going on.  Overall they were pretty good but I still like my grandma's brownie recipe the best.

Didn't use the walnuts or the frosting - but added a bunch of chocolate chips...I've always been a fan of my mom's chocolate zucchini cake, and these are a close contender. Made a batch and invited friends over for game night - they disappeared. Thanks for this great recipe!

I agree with the vegetable aftertaste, but pretty good (great when you're sick of zucchini bread!). My husband really enjoyed them and he claims he doesn't have a sweet tooth. The frosting definitely left something to be desired- it got all runny and puddled in a few places. I let the frosted brownies sit out uncovered and they were less cakey and the frosting kind of soaked in a little, making them tasty. Not real brownies, but not a poor substitute!

I love this recipe!  I did leave out the nuts, but other than that I followed the brownie recipe to the letter.  I also left off the frosting and just dusted with icing sugar when cooled.  I made a batch and within a day they had been eaten up!  My husband and daughter love them.  The second time I made them, I used peeled marrow (summer squash) instead of the zucchini and left out the salt.  I had to drain the grated marrow a little, but the recipe worked a treat.  This recipe will be used again and again.

These were very good although they were more like a cake than a brownie.  At first I thought I would have the same problem that a few other people were having with the batter being too dry but I waited about 3 min after adding the zucchini before pouring the batter in and it was perfect.  I think next time I am going to try them as cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for my daughters birthday.  I love that they are such a great dessert and also have something healthy for you.  My kids and husband didn't even know!

Good considering how much zucchini was in it. I was expecting more of a brownie taste with all the glowing reviews. Tasted more like chocolate zucchini bread to me. Everyone seemed to like it enough, but they didn't disappear the way real brownies would have. The kids didn't seem to notice, but chocolate is chocolate to them plus zucchini bread itself is a treat for them.

These are so rich and chocolatey!  I used the ingredients listed, but had peeled and put the zucchini in the food processor until it was in small bits to disguise the zucchini a little more from my kids (they are becoming leary of everything I bake knowing that it probably has hidden veges in it)  Because it was more ground, I think that my two cups of zucchini actually contained more zucchini and liquid, and I mixed it in with the sugar ingredients.  Needless to say, I did not have a dry batter at all.  It was exactly like brownie batter.  They just came out of the oven and even tasting them hot there is no zucchini aftertaste--maybe because it was peeled?  They did rise quite a bit but it is definately brownie, not cake like.

very yummy brownies! there is no recognizing the zucchini. i'm not sure if they're too cake-like or anything ... i think that just comes down to personal taste and how you like your brownies. anyway, i substituted apple sauce for half of the oil, and put the peeled zucchini in the food processor to really make it invisible. the brownies came out flavourful and moist, and i will certainly be making them again. thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  I will make these again and again.  Great way to use plentiful zucchini.  I mixed the zucchini into the wet mixture before adding the dry stuff as per a previous suggestion... I had no problems with moistness.

Even without the icing, these brownies are wonderful!  Don't expect a typical fudgey center with a sugary crust, though.  This is more like a delectable, moist, dense chocolate cake.  You and your kids will love these!  I even used whole wheat pastry flour and they came out perfect!

Very tasty. Batter looks very dry until you add the zucchini.  I peeled the zucchini so I didn't have streaks of green in it.  Frosting is excellent!

I'm very impressed with the recipe! I did not modify this in any way and it was very well received.. people were shocked that zucchini was in it! For the people that said the batter was dry, I did not have that problem. I did not "ring out" my zucchini though, and the batter got moist when I folded the zucchini in. Will keep this at the top of my recipe box.

Everyone that has had these can't believe they have a veggie in there.  They are great. 

As others recommended, I halved the oil with applesauce. and used half brown sugar, half white.

Kids love them, hubby loved them, I, a huge chocolate fan, love them. Even my dad ate them up.

The reviewer who said that these are earthy was right. I really enjoy the flavor of these and intend to make the glaze next time. I used pureed zucchini instead of shredded and left out the nuts.

These are really chocolatey. I can't really describe them as cake-like or fudgey...they seem to be in between. Made this as written except I followed someone's advice about mixing the zucchini and salt together first and letting it sit while you mix the other stuff. I didn't make the icing but they are good without it, and amazing warmed up and topped with some vanilla frozen yogurt. Oh, my husband loves them, and he was extremely skeptical about the zucchini in there and I'm sure he was concentrating on trying to taste it, so that shows the taste is covered up really well.

I didn't have any walnuts, but my family tore this UP!  I made two 9x13 pans and got only one small piece for myself.  If you want a thicker (frosting-like) topping, whip this glaze with a mixer for a coule minutes.  It thickens up nicely.  I was thrilled to find a brownie recipe that doesn't need half a dozen eggs.

Hmmmmm these were yummy!  I took another reviewers suggestion to use cocoa powder rather than flour when greasing pan, --yeah--  It made them dry on the bottom and the edges.  So I won't do that next time.  But I will definitely make them again!  And I will be using this chocolate frosting recipe again as well!  YUM!

I have to say this is really a 4.5*, just shy of a 5* recipe.

As an Orthodox Christian, having vegan items are a necessity throughout the year. Since I was making dinner to serve to the priest and we are currently in a fasting period, I thought I would try these brownies. Like others, I found the 'batter' to be quite odd as I, too, had to essentially mix it by hand and pat it into the pan. Though I was skeptical, they turned out wonderfully. I was afraid they were going to be thin and not enough for the appetites of Father, the seminarians, and a few others but they filled the 9x13 pan nicely with the final product being at least 1-1.25" thick. Father and the guys raved about them and they couldn't believe they were made with zucchini and without any eggs/dairy. The reason I didn't give them 5*s is because when I tried them I could still feel some sugar granuals in the finished product. I don't know if it is the recipe or if it was an error in my mixing as it was a bit hard to mix. I will definitely make them again though. They really are perfect for Lenten cooking.

I even used whole wheat flour, splenda, applesauce, and dark cocoa powder...even omitted the icing.

THANK YOU for this bleeping bleeping delicious recipe!

This one's a KEEPER!  I made these on Thursday night and now I have to make them again today on Saturday because they were scarfed down so fast!

The ONLY change I made was to substitute 1/2 C chocolate chips for the 1/2 C walnuts becasue my son's allergic to nuts.  Other than that, do not change the recipe.  If you change it you will not get the delicious rich fudgey brownies that are intended.

I can't comment on the icing recipe because I never made it.  They don't need it in my opinion.

One tip - do wait for them to cool completely.  You can detect a faint "vegetable-y" flavor when they're warm.

A great way to use extra zucchini!  I was glad I'd read the other reviews about the dry texture of the batter.  I used 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. applesauce, then a little extra applesauce at the end because it was almost too dry to mix.  Instead of frosting, I just sprinkled chocolate-peanut butter chips on top after baking.  The brownies aren't super choclatey or sweet, but very good with something sweeter on top.

This is a cake, not brownies, even without eggs. It did not rise properly in the middle which made it a bit "fudgy."  Good taste, though.

VERY GOOD!  I worried while I was making it because it seemed way too dry but after putting in the zucchini it was wonderful!  I think maybe next time I'll puree the zucchini instead of shredding it, the little bits gave it a way JUST A LITTLE for those of us looking for it.  But all in all AWESOME recipe!

these were very good, but I found the chocolate flavor to be lacking.  I think a cup of chocolate chips would be a great addition.  I found the texture to be cakey, but moist and because of the lowfat ingredients, I will probably try this again.  It is always nice serving something SLIGHTY healthier for a family dessert!  great idea, thanks.

Great way to use the extra zucchini!  My 7yo nephew who eats NOTHING devoured these and I didn't even put the icing on.  You'd never know they had zucchini in them.  Very moist.  Only downside is that the brownies do not have an intense chocolate flavor; tastes more like German chocolate cake to me.  Maybe the real chocolate flavor comes from the icing?  Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this recipe. My daughter does not eat vegis and this was a great way to sneak some in. I used Canola oil instead of vegetable oil. Also, can use half splena and have sugar to help cut down calories. I highly recommend.

These were very good, but a little too rich for me. It's a good recipe to get rid of some of the endless supply of zucchini from our garden. Next time I will leave the frosting off.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the instructions to the letter and my brownies were still undercooked in the middle and hard around the edges.  The brownies never poofed, they were still very condensed.  The zucchini wasn't hidden at all, it was very obvious that there was zucchini in the brownies.

Not that this recipe needs another review, but it is a must try recipe.  I substituted 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil, left off the frosting but put about 3/4 c. chocolate chips on the top before baking.  These are very moist and tasty but they are more cake-like.

Wow, what a great brownie!  I was able to hide the zucchini from my husband (or else he probably wouldn't eat it!)  I did not use the frosting, and to make it a bit more healthier, I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  They are cake-like, but good!

Tasty!  I was surprised at how well grated zucchini worked as an egg replacer-- good to know my extra garden zucchinis can be handy for vegan baked goods.  I agree that it was cakey rather than fudgy-- next time I'll sub applesauce for oil and add an extra half cup of zucchini bits.  Great recipe!

I didn't believe anything made with zucchini would taste this good, these go way past good, they are out of this world. If you try them you will love they. My husband hates zucchini, so I didn't let him know, He LOVED them ,he told everyone about them. The frosting gets a bit hard if you don't put it right on, hard to spread, maybe make it a little thiner. But they are great. Marie in Oklahoma

This was very good, I did not use a 9x13 and I wish I had, I used a large round cake pan and that is pretty much what I got was a chocolate cake. Don't get me wrong a very good chocolate cake but not the dense or chewy brownie I was looking for. The mixture before adding the zucchini looked like sand but after adding the zucchini the batter looked correct. I will try this again with the pan and spread it thin since it baked up quiet a bit. I'm sure that will make it much more like a brownie. Thank you for a wonderful recipe, I will make this over and over and follow the recipe as its written.

I followed this recipe exactly.  The batter before the zucchini was like moist sand.  I was using just thawed zucchini so they were fairly moist and helped the consistency of the batter.  Unfortunately I had to use an 8 x 8 dish which doubled the cooking time.  When they were done they came out fairly well, but not like the chewy brownies made with butter most people are used to.  They are still really good!  A good, healthy vegan chocolate dessert!

My husband said that these were the best brownies I had ever made!  I made these exactly according to the recipe, and they turned out great.  They were even better the next day!  My five year old son loved them as well.  I'll make this one all summer, as long as we have extra zucchini!

I made this recipe and added 2 eggs thinking that the mixture was too dry.  My family loved them.  They definitely are the cakelike brownie.  I even managed to fool my daughter's best friend.  She's a picky eater and she couldn't tell the zucchini was in there.  I will definitely make these again.  I'll have to try them without the eggs because I like my brownies fudgy.  For those of you that like the cakelike brownie, after I added the egg they reminded me of a "wacky cake" that my mother used to make when I was young.

This recipe is phenomenal. Really really good. I would reccoment though that in the method that it's mentioned what a weird texture it is as you mix, and press into the pan. I've had many panicked calls from family members who I've sent the recipe to. Other than that, MAKE THEM!!!!!

Being a mom of 4, I'm always looking for new ways to get my kids to actually eat something that's good for them... and these are perfect.  No way they will ever see the green from the skins that were left of when the zucchini was shredded (leaving skin on adds vitamins.)  Best of all, when you are facing a bumper crop of zucchini at the end of the summer/fall, this is an AWESOME way to use it that isn't the same old bread you always think of when you think zucchini.  

Lots of people stated they thought the batter was too dry, and I have a good solution for you.  If you freeze your zucchini at the end of the season to make bread during the winter like I do, just pull out a bag and let it thaw.  When it freezes, the zucchini releases a LOT of moisture and when it thaws, you have a load of juice that wasn't there when you originally froze it.  Add the whole bag, juice and all.  I had premeasured 3 cup bags in my freezer since that's the amount I use for bread, so I just halved up my recipe... ie. multiply all the quantites by 1 1/2 since I had 3 cups zucchini instead of 2 and needed to take account for the added moisture the extra cup would bring.  I also used a larger pan, around 15 1/2 x 10 since it was more batter, and set it for 25 minutes to make sure it wouldn't burn at a longer time.  When I poured it into the pan, it looked just like regular brownie/cake batter.

This is a wonderful recipe and HAD to review it since I couldn't even wait until it cooled to cut it and hav

WOW!  These are so delicious!  I have to say, they look pretty nasty when you put them in the oven, but WOW they look and taste amazing when they come out, and that icing!  You DO need the icing- maybe just drizzle it on top if you don't like too much sweet.
Really great!  TRY IT!

Oh my GOODNESS these are amazing!!!  You don't even taste the zucchini, which is a bonus as my 6 year old son definately wouldn't eat them if he knew there were actually veggies in there!!  Plenty rich without the icing, but doubly good with :)  A definate keeper - this recipe will have a place in the front of my recipe box for sure!! Thanks for sharing.

Amazing how such a seemingly dry batter can turn into moist, dense, perfect brownies!!! Don't change a thing! Icing is yummy but not necessary; chocolate chips sprinkled on top right out of the oven works well too, as does a lighter chocolate glaze. Nuts optional; good with and without them.

I made this with splenda and yet the batter turned out a bit dry, so I had to add another 1/2c of zucchini.  I made it a second time and found that if I beat the zucchini a bit longer it rendered the moisture needed for the brownies.  I suspect the same thing would happen if I just let it sit.

I used half the sugar, which made for a nice "mature" flavor, just a bit sweet, like a nice dark chocolate. But probably slightly more sugar (2/3) would have worked better for my friend and her 6-yo girl. I also used German cocoa (I always use European cocoa) and for the icing I used butter. Because I used less sugar I should have used less milk in the icing too, and less salt in the base.

My new favorite brownie recipe! While it doubled in height and came out looking cake-like, the flavor and consistency was very fudgy and brownie-like. Slightly different flavor from regular brownies; I could really taste the vanilla, but in a good way. I even made healthy substitutions- 6 Tbsp applesauce + 2 Tbsp oil, 1 C whole wheat flour + 1 C all purpose flour, and 1 C chocolate chips instead of 1/2 C nuts, no icing. My skeptical mother, who at first didn't want any when she heard "zucchini," ended up having seconds! Thanks for a great recipe!

It tasted "healthy" to me, meaning that it didn't taste like I was having dessert.  It was dry and didn't look appetizing.  (A user issue, I'm sure)  I don't think I used enough zucchini.  Next time, I will use more to try to step up the moistness factor.

These are absolutely AMAZING! If you really pack the zucchini into the cup measure rather than sprinkling it in (as I did the first time round), then your mixture won't be crumbly.

I made this recipe exactly as written except added a couple extra spoonfuls of cocoa powder and omitted the walnuts. It was very crumbly until I added the zucchini. I kept stirring and stirring and eventually it turned into a very gooey batter. The taste is fantastic, but the texture is more of cake to me. Not fudgey at all. I will definitely be making this again, but I think more as a cake and will frost it with a dark choclate frosting. Then no one at all will know there are veggies in it!

I don't know guys...I really wanted to like these but mine just didn't really turn out.  Don't get me wrong, the taste is fine, but you can't go wrong with sugar and cocoa powder.  Like the other reviewers, my "batter" was completely dry.  But I pressed on since that's what it sounded like it was supposed to be.  But sure enough the zucchini did not deliver quite enough juice to permeate the entire batch.  The inside was gooey as it should be, but mine had like a cocoa-floury crust on top that wasn't really appetizing.  I will give this one another try with another cup or two or zucchini, or something else to at least make the flour mixture more moist going into the oven, but I have to give this one 3 stars.  I will agree with the reviewer who said for someone who has major allergies to eggs this is a good alternative for them!

This didn't turn out cakey texturewise, but tastewise I felt like it was cake. No complaints though, I loved it!!! It was dense and moist, I couldn't tell there was zucchini in it! I even fooled the bf. I'll be making these again for sure!

I got the kids to eat zucchini! These were very moist, and the kids had no idea that there was zucchini in them! I tasted it a little bit, but it may have been just because I knew it was there. I used a fine grater and grated the zucchini by hand, and that worked well. The frosting was like fudge! It was very good! But, (I don't believe I'm saying this) the brownies were a little too sweet with all that frosting. I will make both again, but I don't think I will be using them together. (Don't let this stop you from trying it!)*****

I've tried around 4 recipes from this site and my brownies always came out cakey. These are the most fudgy, moist, and delicious brownies I've ever baked. The only thing I would change is the frosting. I halfed the frosting recipe and it was more than enough. I also used half whole wheat flour for healthier brownies.

They were too oooey goooey. I could taste the zucchini in the brownies. They seemed to take longer to cook than stated. I think I will stick to regular fudge, or maybe try pureeing the zucchini next time.

Delicious and so moist! My family had NO idea they had zucchini in them until I told them. They couldn't believe it. I left out the walnuts. These are awesome brownies! (I also worried about the dry-looking, crumbly mix before dumping it into the pan ... even double-checked the recipe ... but they turned out great. The zucchini provides the moisture.)

To get some hidden veggies and a little whole wheat flour into my kiddos these are great, but as a brownie they are just o.k.; a little dry and not quite chocolatey enough.

Not the best browning I've ever eaten, but its pretty darn good! Very moist, the brownie itself is not a heavy chocolate flavor, you get your chocolate kick from the frosting. I normally don't care for brownies with frosting, but this makes just enough to give you flavor without frosting overkill. You would never guess its made with zucchini, my husband and children didn't have a clue. This is my new recipe with I have to make brownies for kids.

Wonderful recipe.  I follow it exactly EXCEPT instead of regular milk in the frosting I use Vanilla Soy because that is all I keep on hand.  The brownies and frosting always turn out wonderful.  My boyfriend and his vegetarian brother ask for them all the time.  I hope everyone else enjoys this as much as we do!!

This recipe was absolutely great.  I didn’t make any changes from the original recipe other than omitting the walnuts because I didn’t have any on hand.  I loved them so much that I made them twice during the weekend and I will definitely make these again and again.

These were a little too cake-like for me (I prefer fudgier brownies), and even after leaving them for a day, they weren't as moist as I'd hoped for. One adjustment I made that I'm happy with is that I used caramel frosting (homemade) instead of the chocolate frosting in the recipe.

I made half the amount, which fit into an 8x8 pan. Per other reviewers suggestions, I used half oil & half apple sauce. I also used a little over the amount of zucchini only because when I was grating it there was a small part leftover, so why not go ahead and use it. Also, I threw in a small handful of semi sweet chocolate chips. Mine were good, but definitely more cake like than brownie like. I had a small piece out of the oven and they were better the next day. They were very moist, were actually falling apart. I rated the recipe a 3 start because I'm not sure I'd call these brownies, but they were good, especially for having a veggie in them and less fat.

Have made this several times and it is perfect every time.  Excellent way to use up frozen grated zucchini from the harvest.  Also, for the sneaky chef, these brownies are a way to get your toddler to eat zucchini.  Mine loves this moist "cake."  I substitute soy milk for the frosting, since we have a dairy allergy, or omit altogether since in my opinion the brownie can stand on it's own two feet!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

Very good recipe, although a little more like cake than I was expecting, even after sitting for 2 days.  Next time I'll try draining a little of the liquid from the frozen zucchini when it thaws.  Will definitely make many more times though!

Great!  Would never know there was zucchini in here but it sure does something great for the moisture!  These are spectacular!  Next time I will cut the frosting mixture in 1/2 and someone else mentioned these are great after they sit overnight.  That is so true.  After covering and sitting out overnight they were more most and much much more flavorful!  Will be adding this to a more often used dessert recipe!

Very good recipe.  I have a lot of friends who are vegetarians who would appreciate this. It was so easy to make.  The batter looked slightly dry but when cooked it was the right texture.   I scaled down the recipe to fit into a 9x9 inch pan and I may have overcooked it somewhat but it was still tasty.   It is not as sweet as the brownies I am used to so maybe next time I will add some chocolate chips along with the dry ingredients (I omitted the frosting).

I actually followed a recipe to the letter!  Wonderful, popular and gone!  My son chose this for his school party.  Having made the recipe 3x in a week, I ran out of vanilla extract so substitute 1 tsp of mint.  Hey, my people like this too for a change, but prefer the original.

Definitely an intriguing recipe.  I was amazed that these turned out at all (given the zucc. and no egg).  I followed the recipe exactly, shredding the zucc. with the fine shredder blade on my food processor.  Result was a very moist, cake-like brownie.  I prefer a fudgier brownie, and am trying to figure out how to do that.  Maybe melt chocolate chips, fold it into the batter, and then it would harden a little as brought back to room temp?  Or maybe just reduce the baking soda?  Following it exactly, my batter appeared like wet, brown sand before adding zucc., after adding it was a flowable consistency just like any other brownie recipe.

WOW! These are fantastic!! More cake than brownie, though. You can't taste the zucchini and my veggie hating daughter didn't believe me when I told her the secret ingredient. I agree with the other reviewers that the batter has to be pressed into the pan and is a bit worrisome, but the result is awesome!

These brownies were delectable!  I was a little concerned about the mix until I added the zucchini (I substituted the oil for applesauce) but once out of the oven my kids (both VERY picky eaters) gobbled them up.  I will definitely make these again.

I'm not sure what happened, but I just made these and they were really bad.  I read prior reviews and understood the batter was going to be dry, but this was ridiculous. The brownies were like powder. What a waste of time and ingredients.

These do have a nice chocolate flavor and I don't mind that they are more cake like then brownie.  However they tasted like salt and also could taste the crunchy sugar granules.  I double checked the baking soda amt as I thought it seemed like a lot of salt and soda together.  I didn't make the frosting, ended up throwing them away after my first bite.  Not great, will try another recipe.

I love the texture, but don't find them chocolate-y enough for my tastes.  Granted, I didn't make the glaze.  Next time I'll replace more of the flour with more cocoa and see how they are.

Wow! These are great!  My husband had no idea that the brownie he was eating contained zucchini.  I wanted to tweak the recipe to avoid the oil and white sugar, but my daughter urged me to follow it exactly and they turned out great.  I think I'll go have another one!

This recipe was so fast and easy.  It really does taste like brownies.  I used my hands to fold in the zucchini at the end.  All of a sudden the flour/cocoa mixture became moist.  I had my doubts but it really works.

The best brownie recipe I've ever made!
Don't change a thing unless you prefer
pecans to walnuts as my family does.
I did use a smaller pan (7 1/4 x 11 1/4 x
3/8 ") or (27.3 x 17.8 x 3.2 cm) to achieve a thicker brownie which may yield
less portions then you expect.  Am doing a double recipe today so I can freeze one
batch (minus icing) for a quick addition
to school lunches.  Thanks so much for
the recipe.  Zucchini is abundant in my garden at this time of year!

THIS RECIPE WAS AWESOME! THE BEST BROWNIE I HAVE EVER HAD EVEN ONES WITH OUT ZUCCHINI! I ADDED 1 CUP OF CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND MAYBE ALITTLE MORE ZUCCHINI THAN RECIPE CALLED FOR AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT WITH OUT THE FROSTING. WHEN IT CAME OUT OF THE OVEN IT WAS 1/2 GONE IN LESS THAN 1/2 HOUR. THE FAMILY COULD NOT GET ENOUGH!! THIS IS GOING IN MY PERSONAL RECIPE FILE.

Delicious! We loved the flavor and texture of this decadant, rich dessert. And it was wonderful knowing there was zucchini in there. We scooped it onto a plate and ate it with a fork or in a bowl with vanilla ice cream and a spoon. I'm not sure I'd call them brownies, since they didn't hold their shape, but this could be because I reduced the amount of sugar and used butter instead of margarine. In any case, I'd make this again. My family loved it! Thank you.

Very yummy! Glad I read the other reviews as the batter was really dry, but once I added the zucchini it was perfect!

While mixing,I went back to the recipe a few time because it was SO dry! Added the zucchini and you could tell that the zucchini was what it needed.
Made them for work and a great way to use up zucchini.

I was veeeery skeptical when I too saw how it looked after mixing everything up.  I used whole wheat flour instead of the white flour and it gave it a wonderful flavor with everything.  I did have to press it in the pan and it was lumpy looking in the pan, but it turned out superb!  You can't even tell that there's zucchini in it!!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These were really good, although the advice from other users was helpful because I wasn't so sure about them when I was mixing them.  I replaced about half of the oil with applesauce, which worked well, although they were a little more cakey than i was expecting -- maybe due to the applesauce.  Took these to a potluck and they disappeared pretty quickly!

Someone please tell me what I did wrong. There is not one egg in this recipe, nor any other "juice" other than the oil and vanilla.  This was very crumbly putting into pan, so there was flakes of uncooked flour etc. on top.  Not sure what I did wrong here but it did not turn out good for me at all...hummm.

Wow!! These are great! I added one egg to the mix and also mixed the zucchini before adding all the flour. I baked in an 11x7 pan for 1 hour and they turned out very thick and still cake like, but awesome. Many asked for the recipe and couldn't believe they had zucchini in them! The frosting tasted better the next day.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and was really surprised when the "batter" came out really dry. I had to sort of press it into the pan. They did bake up nice though....although I could taste some of the grittiness of the sugar. Next time I will use my stand mixer to blend the dough better, since it is so crumbly. Also I might try using a bit more zucchini, or a bit less sugar.

This is a great recipe. I always wonder who comes up with these recipes sometimes. Who would think that zucchini would be in brownies, and it would be this good. Very easy too.
Thank You!

I loved these, and so did everyone else. I only had a 8x8 pan which made the edges of my brownies over cooked and the middle a little gooey. But after cutting off the edges these were perfect! Chocolatey, dense, and chewy. The only subsitution I made was 1/2 oil 1/4 applesauce and I added a cup of chocolate chips, which I recomend. Great recipe.

When making this recipe, I wasn't sure there would be enough moisture,as it looked a little dry going into the baking dish. But, it turned out perfectly moist and yummy. thank you, I love it. I increased the baking time to an hour.

I would have given these 4 stars because I didn't love them-some bites tasted like zucchini to me but my husband RAVED about them.  I think it was the frosting that made them great.  I would use it for other things it was so good.  For once in my life I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm glad I read the reviews though, because the dough (mine wasn't a batter at all) really didn't look right and I had to press it into the pan and also had to refrigerate it after baking to get that fudgy texture.  I used a Pampered Chef cheese grater to grate the zucchini and will try the fine grating drum instead of coarse next time to see if I can get the zucchini to disappear into the brownies.

these are okay, but  don't know if they are worth the work of grating all that zuchinni unless you already have some to get rid of. That was my case, and since I'm a vegan, this seemed like a good way to go.  They are kind of like a moist cake more than a brownie. I omitted the frosting.  Also, instead of the chocolate chips I added a chopped up ghiardelli bar.

I thought this recipe was very good, the people I served it too all loved it. I too was a bit afraid while mixing the batter, but it does turn out very moist because of the water in the zucchini. I substituted applesauce for the oil, did 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 regular. I also did 1/2 splenda and 1/2 regular sugar. Great way to get a chocolate fix and use up zucchini at the same time!

A good way to use up extra zucchini, but they are definitely more cake than brownie.  I made these just as the recipe says, and they turned out good, just not extra moist & dense like I want a brownie.  Like other reviewers, I was tempted to add oil or eggs because the batter was so dry, but once I added the zucchini & mixed it for a minute, it turned into normal batter.  With the frosting this makes an excellent cake though, and my hubby didn't even notice the zucchini.

This was unbelievable. It was scary in that it looked like a mistake that would be thrown down the garbage disposal. The mixture in the baking pan is very dry and very crumbly. Don't despair! The end result is wonderful and everyone will rave about it. It took a pan of these to work and they lasted about an hour and people were asking for me to make them again. Give this a try!

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I omitted the walnuts.  These turned out great!  The "batter" was dry and crumbly, which I expected after reading other reviews.  Once I added the zucchini, though, the batter came together.  These brownies were so moist and delicious!

Wonderful.  I was first worried because the batter was real crumbly and after being baked it looked dry but they aren't especially with the icing.

These could be the best brownies I have ever made! Make the frosting, it is totally worth it!  You could not tell one little bit that there was zucchini in these brownies!

Very delicious. Like some others said, this is actually rather cake-like.  The batter is very dry, until you mix the zucchini in, then it changes dramatically.  The only change I made to the brownies was to add a cup of semisweet chocolate chips, and I used pecans rather than walnuts.  The frosting was too thin, so I added nearly a cup more powdered sugar and beat it with my hand mixer to make it fluffier and not as runny.  My daughter, upon seeing freshly baked brownies, suspected there was zucchini in them (maybe because of the dozen or so zucchini on my countertop!), but I told her no, she ate one and liked it.  It is my little secret....:)

These were GREAT!  The kids loved it and I couldn't get enough.  Nobody knew the zucchini was in there.  Very moist!  You have to try it!

Incredible! These are wonderful!!! The only substitute I made was to replace the two tsp vanilla with one each of almond and maple extracts, since I was out of vanilla.  Moist and flavorful - perfect brownie consistency.

The batter for this was so dry and the final product was not at all like brownies, instead, it looked like a crumb cake.  I'll take someone elses advice and try it again with a couple of eggs.

Since I thought I was getting brownies, I was kind of disappionted.  But, once we starting thinking of it as chocolate zucchini bread, it was awesome.

What a fantastic recipe,i had an abundance of zucchini's in my garden and the family would say not zucchini again but they had no idea it was in there. Not only is it moist and yummy but i would have to say it might just be the best brownie i have ever had.The mixture looks really dry when you first poor it into the tin but once it was baked everything just melted together beautifully. Highly recommend!!!

I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour and one cup of splenda, and used the listed ingredients for the rest. Mine just came out OK. I also shredded the zucchini istead of grating it.  I didn't use the frosting, I used a basic cream cheese frosting, I still wasn't satisfied with these so I melted about 1/2 semi sweet chips and 3 TBS of butter and poured it on top.  I gave them to my parents, and they said they were good. I might try this again without substituting Splenda.

I made this for the 1st time last week, and the 2nd time yesterday. I turned down the oven, and extended the cooking time, so that I could ensure that the middle was cooked without overcooking the outside. Also, I didn't make any topping either time, and I don't think it needs it. The 1st batch was more moist than the other, but although the results were slightly different in both cases, the reaction from the family was the same - my son and wife can't leave it alone. All-in-all, a real keeper, and something I'll definitely be making on a regular basis. Boosted by this success, I'm now off to try the "Apple, Carrot or Zucchini Cake" in an attempt to create some healthier desserts and treats for the family.

these taste good & were a nice break from from the traditional chewy chocolate brownie. i tried to sneak the zucchini ingredient past my boyfriend but he figured something was amiss (healthful) in them. a fine treat as is, no frosting needed. thanks marian!

These were very delicious!  Loved the frosting on them.  They went over very well with the whole family.  However I was a bit worried when I mixed it up and how dry the batter was even after the zucchini so I went for it and threw in 2 eggs ~ reading the other reviews now I see the recipe DOES work fine without the eggs but it threw me off with no eggs.  Regardless they turn out great WITH eggs as well ;-)  Next time I'll try them without.

I never considered putting zucchini in brownies, and was skeptical...but it is not all that bad.  (Does it have more nutritional value I wonder?) I skipped the walnuts, but put in about a cup of chocolate chips.  I found this recipe more cake-like than brownie-like.  It was very moist, and I think it tasted even better the next day.

AWESOME brownies!! Everybody that tried them was shocked there was zucchini in the recipe. Super easy to make, with all the ingredients I already had on hand. The frosting makes it rich and fudgy, absolutely delish! I had to make another batch a few days later because my boyfriend ate them all!

Pretty good brownies. The kids (who are SUPER picky) gobbled it up, none the wiser. Still not as good as the boxed version of brownies I make so I'll keep looking.

I'm not sure what went wrong with the last posters, but these are the ONLY "from scratch" brownies I've ever made that I liked.  And to my surprise and pleasure, I didn't just like them, I loved them.  They are so moist and yummy, with or without the frosting.  We love them at our house, and they are a late summer staple.  I will be freezing a bunch of zucchini this year just for this recipe.  I tried it last year, and the frozen zucchini works just as well.  Just don't drain it once it thaws (you need the moisture)!!!

Delicious recipe!  I am on a gluten-free diet, so I made these using gluten-free flour and they still turned out very moist!  Thank you for a very yummy treat that I can make gluten free!  I will definitely make these again.

I made it for the kids, and they loved them.  Then my husband and I tried them and they are gone after just 1 day.  They are not too sweet, and very moist.  
I didn't make the frosting since I didn't have everything to make it.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

These brownies are delish. Moist, good flavor, rich and heavy so cut in small squares.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  The frosting is even better than most homemade ones.

This recipe reminded me so much of devils food cake.  It was so good but not my idea of a brownie.  I'll definitely use this recipe again but will refer to it as chocolate zucchini cake. :)

I wasn't quite sure how they'd turn out with no egg in it, but a 14 year old boys football team proved to me how good they were.  Gone in seconds!  Very nice flavour and texture.  Will make again.

OUTSTANDING! The best zucchini brownies I have ever made -- my family and friends loved them. The batter does seem dry but the brownies are anything but.  I did leave out the walnuts, because my children don't like them, but otherwise, I didn't change a thing. I'll be making these again and again.

I was disappointed in these and threw them out. I baked them the correct time but they were too soft for me.  Won't make again.

VERY good! Mine turned out "cake like" brownies, but that is what we like. My son who is VERY picky loved them. Great with or without icing. I cheated and used canned icing. I will make these again! A+ in my recipe book.

These were surprisingly good, rich, and flavorful. I (somehow) didn't have enough zucchini so I used some yellow squash in addition to the grated zucchini. I baked for about 30 minutes and the middle was still a little raw, but I can get over that.

This is a chocoholics dream.  Even a non-chocoholics dream.  My husband and in-laws loved it; and it was gone in less than 2 days...not a standard occurence with that group. This time I left off the frosting and went without nuts.  Can't wait to try with the nuts and frosting.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My oldest daughter, who won't TOUCH zucchini let alone eat it even loved these brownies!!  A total hit!  I'll use the frosting recipe in the future, too!  I did add some mini-chocolate chips to the frosting though.

Love these brownies!! They are so tasty, and not to sweet like most brownies.  I iced half the batch as my boyfriend likes things a little more sweet, and he never even guessed there was zucchini in them.  The zucchini makes the brownies so moist.  Will defenetly be a regular recipe in our house.

This recipe tasted very good, but it was definetly not brownies.  Even after trying the recipe a second time adding eggs to it it was still more of a chocolate cake rather than a brownie.  Will make it again though!

I and every one else that tried these could not believe how good these were. I never would have thought zucchini in a brownie recipe could be so good. When I first mixed it all together to put in the pan, I was a little woried because the batter was so stiff and I had to press it down to flatten it. But it came out great!

Believe it, this recipe is as good as it is rated!  I found it 2 weeks ago and have made it twice already.  It's moist and really tasty.  Make the recipe "AS IS", you don't need to make any changes/amendments.  Thanks Marian!

This recipe is incredible!  I did however add one egg to the recipe, as I wrote the recipe down rather quick, and I didn't have access to the computer.  I had thought that maybe I forgot to write it down after I mixed everything up and it was all powdery.  My mistake!  But I think next time, I will puree the Zuchinni, i'm sure this will add the moisture that it needs to mix up better.

These brownies were wonderful!  Took them to the office and a lot of my co-workers wanted the recipe.  One little change I made was to use 1/2 cup Splenda and 1 c. sugar.  I used heaping cups of shredded zucchini too.  You can satisfy your sweet tooth with this version of a healthier brownie.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These brownies were a bit dry by the time I had it all mixed together, I ended up adding a small amount of water and a tiny bit more oil.  I think the fault was mine though, may not have added enough zucchini to the mix.  The end result tasted great though!  Really good brownies and a great way to use up some of that zucchini from the garden.  Will be making these brownies again, thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT.  They were so moist.  Also, for the icing, I did not have milk in the house and used water as a substitute and it worked fine.  Walnuts in the icing might be nice also.

I admit I was a little curious to see how this would come out.  Brownies with no eggs.  It didn't seem right.  It was a little tough to stir but... they were DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks, this one's a keeper!

9-5-11 i added 3/4c.chocolate chips this time, yummy:)

These brownies had been baking for 15 minutes when I realized I had forgotten to add the baking soda.   I cooked them for the entire 30 mins but was prepared to throw them out.  After they cooled my kids tried and loved them.   I found the texture a bit funny.    I can't wait to try this recipe with all the ingredients :)

These were VERY, very good.  I pureed the zucchini in the food processor and added with the oil, etc. and didn't have any problems with the batter being dry.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated and the brownies are delicious and moist.  I'll definitely make these again!

Sorry for the error on my previous review - I meant to type that I used only 1/4 cup vegetable oil...

But I think you left the eggs out of this recipe, I just add two eggs, and I had people asked me for the recipe because they was so good.

Excellent!  I used splenda instead of sugar and thought I had a mess on my hands because the splenda didn't mix well with the oil, but I kept going and they were great.  They are hard to mix but don't give up.  Worth the effort.  Oh, and the frosting....WOW!

Good Brownies.  Very moist.  I left out the walnuts and added chocolate chips instead.  I also left off the frosting and just sprinkled powder sugar on them for a quick and easy topping.  Will make again.

YEAH - A WINNER!  I added 2 squares melted semisweet chocolate as the teenagers around here like their chocolate dark - it was truly great.  Even the snotty 17 yr old who cringes at veggies scarfed this down.  Would make a great potluck or picnic dessert.

Good stuff!  This is more like a chocolate cake than a brownie consistancy.  Nice dark brown color, dense chocolate cake texture.  Moist.  I didn't make the frosting.  It didn't need it!  Thank you for the recipe.

Yum! I added 6oz of mini choc chips to the batter and didn't use the icing. It turned out more like a cake than brownies, but it's delicious! This is definitely a keeper!

This was some funky looking batter, looked like dirt with a bunch of grass in it and it started out  really dry but mixed to a spreadable batter. These came out great!  I used the betty crocker pourable chocolate frosting and my 13 yr old  daughter who hates zucchini LOVED these!  My hubby and 3 yr old  son didnt  care for them, but I liked them. These are worth a try!

Fabulous recipe. I've made it every time following the instructions exactly and they always turn out great.  My son's friends even request them (and their mom's are shocked to find out they are made with zucchini).  I agree with the previous reviews they need to sit at least overnight for the flavors to meld.  Thanks for sharing!

Great rich chocolate taste! Next time I would bake a bit longer (mine were a bit too gooey.) I would also squeeze out any extra liquid from the zucchini.

Whoever formulated this is a genius. The result is an ultra moist and rich brownie. Trust the zucchini to add the moisture needed (I used a food processor to puree the zucchini.)

These were cake like in texture.  I had used the conversion option and scaled this to 16 servings and used an 9x9 square pan.  I used the suggested 3/4 tsp salt, but found them too salty.  I would not make them again.

It wasn't as good as my favorite rich (and more fattening) Hershey's Brownie recipe, but this was good!  Especially when you know there is zucchini in it and don't have to feel so guilty giving some to your kids with a glass of milk.  I will make this again!

I was very worried making this recipe.  I evedently did not read enough of the reviews because I kept looking back at the recipe because I thought I forgot something.  It was so dry that I added an egg, a little milk and a little extra oil.  I had also doubled the recipe.  It was very good with the additions, I will try it again without the additions I made.

The first time I made these brownies, I thought I had missed an ingredient because the batter is so dry.  However, they turned out just fine, stay moist longer than any other brownie recipe I've tried, and taste even better on day 2 or 3 (if they last that long!)  I've made them many times since first seeing the recipe, and everyone loves them.

Thank goodness for Allrecipes.com and their
reviews because had I not been able to read what others had said about this mixture being dry at first until the zucchini renders out some of its moisture I would have thrown out my batter and missed out on such an awesome brownie recipe.  My four young boys and their little friends devoured this and were none the wiser that it had zucchini in it and I was surprised I didn't have to use eggs.

If you're looking for a brownie this is not a brownie recipe.  It is a cake recipe.  It is very rich and the frosting has too much cocoa in it.  Next time I would put in only 3 tablespoons.  An okay recipe but I was really looking forward to brownies, not cake.

I was careful not to let anyone see what went into these, then overheard my teenager telling one of his friends about the *awesome* brownies I made.  Batter was only dry before the zucchini
was beaten in.  Frosting is excellent!!

These brownies are fantastic - no one ever guesses they have zucchini.  They are extremely moist - and hold their moisture instead of quickly drying out.  Have gotten rave review from everyone who has tried them.

Okay, maybe I did something wrong, or had exceptionally dry zucchini, but this batter was so dry it was like dust.  I couldn't even stir in most of the zucchini.  I figured an ingredient, like a liquid, had been left out.  I added 4 eggs and a little milk.  The whole thing baked within the prescribed time, but it was more like a cake.  I didn't care for the finished product.  It tasted like...zucchini---with chocolate sauce.  Very weird.  The icing was great, though.  I could have eaten that right out of the bowl.  In fact, I wish I had, and skipped the cake/brownies with green vegetables.  Too bad.  I thought this would be a great way to sneak some greenies into my kids, but since it tasted like zucchini, and I could even see the green shreds in the cake (yuck!), I'm afraid I'll have to keep looking for veggie disguises.

It's zucchini season and of course it's always brownie season, so I was eager to try this recipe.  The 'brownies' baked in a 9 x 13 pan took much longer than the noted 30 minutes.  Tried the recipe again in a cookie pan and liked the results.  Instead of frosting, when the baking was complete, I sprinkled milk chocolate candy wafers on the pan, waited about 3 minutes and spread the melted wafers over the warm brownies til smooth.  Let cool, score slighlty and cut into desired size squares.  Will definitely use the recipe again.  Note: The brownies in the 9x13 pan were very good, but were more like cake, since they had to bake longer to make sure the middle was done.

We tried this recipe and these brownies are the best I have eaten..I felt this recipe should be under cakes as it was more cake like but it still was out of this world..thanks for a great recipe.
