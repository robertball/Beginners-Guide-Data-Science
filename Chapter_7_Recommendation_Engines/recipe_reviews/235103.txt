I am pretty sure these ingredients convert to some form of opiate in the oven because they are so addictive. I add chocolate chips and sometimes nuts (but don't reduce the toffee). Also, I use the Heath 'Bits o Brickle' rather than the chopped candy bars. I've modified this recipe a hundred different ways, but other than the bit o' brickle, chocolate chips and nuts, don't change a thing. I usually make 2 - 4 batches at a time then freeze what I don't bake in ziplock bags (flattened at about 1/4" thick). When I want to make a batch, I get one out, rip the bag off, and cut the frozen dough into little squares. Don't forget to use parchment paper, a silicone mat or silpat on your cookie sheet.

I thought these were very good. When I tasted the batter, I was afraid they were going to be too sweet, but this wasn't the case at all; the flavor was actually perfect. Two things I would like to point out, though: First of all, I baked mine for 12 minutes, and I think I should have taken them out a minute or two before that. Secondly, I think you should use softened butter in this recipe, as with most cookie recipes. The recipe didn't say. Anyways, thanks...I love Heath bars!

I found that the cooking time of 12-15 minutes was to long.  I cooked my second batch for 10 minutes and I didn't leave the cookies on the cookie sheet as long after coming out of the oven.

We will definitely make these again. My friend bought some in the bakery at Market of Choice and Ineedes more so I decided to find a recipe and bake them myself.  We bought the bag of Heath bar bits, rather than breaking up bars. Only 2 changes: similar to others, we reduced cooking time to about 10 minutes and for half of the batch, we added walnuts. So good - chewy and delicious and super fast and easy to make!

Recipe made 27 cookies. I chopped 4 bars to make 1 cup. Next time I will use two bars. Each tray baked for 11 minutes and came out soft and chewy. Thank you for sharing.

Great cookie! Kids loved them. I only had to bake for 9 minutes in my oven. Kept all week for school lunches. These will be part of my weekly cookie rotation.

I think these cookies are awful. they tasted like oatmeal cookies gone wrong to me, and out of 5 people that tried them only one really liked them. I followed all the directions exactly so maybe these just aren't our taste. I also added chocolate chips.

I made these cookies for my Christmas cookie plate and at the end of the night they were all gone.  They are almost exactly like a chocolate chip cookie, but with Heath chips instead of chocolate chips, what could be better.

These were delicious and a hit with my family!  I shortened the baking time by a couple of minutes as other reviewers suggested, and they were perfect.  Will definitely make again.
