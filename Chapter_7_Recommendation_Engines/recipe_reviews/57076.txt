My fiance really likes green salads with fruit, so I wanted to try this one.  I tried another salad with pears and feta and didn't care for the combo, so knew in advance I would change the fruit.  I used iceberg and spinach (what I had); made the dressing per the recipe; used fresh sectioned oranges; no cheese.  We very much enjoyed this salad.  And...glazed walnuts would probably be very good in this salad; add another dimension.

10.18.16  Oh yeah, we enjoyed this salad!  This is something that I would expect to be served at a fine dining restaurant. I changed a few things, but nothing major.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and white balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  I cut the dressing’s sugar back because I knew it would be too sweet for us and gave it an extra shake of hot sauce, but that’s just a personal taste preference.  I assembled it a bit differently than in the instructions, mixing the salad greens and the dressing together (setting aside a little dressing), and then placed the onions and pears on top, sprinkled the salad with the walnuts (which I’d toasted) and the feta cheese, and then just drizzled the remaining dressing over each salad.  This one’s going into my Favorites file, awesome salad!

I liked this.  My husband is VERY picky and won't eat the Vinaigrette!  So, this was a lot of salad for just me!
