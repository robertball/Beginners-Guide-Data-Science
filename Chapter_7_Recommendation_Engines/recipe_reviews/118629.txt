This was okay.  The ranch flavor was intense, however you couldn't taste the cheese at all.  I would recommend just melting it on top of the burger.

Made this one a few weeks ago and forgot to review it.  My daughter, son and I all thought it was fantastic!  My husband on the other hand wouldn't finish his.  Oh well, what does he know?  It was really good with lots of ranch flavor.  If you like ranch, you'll love this one.
