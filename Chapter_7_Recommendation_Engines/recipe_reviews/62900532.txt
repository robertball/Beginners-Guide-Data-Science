I have made both the dark and light. I enjoy the light version the best. I use organic sugar and blend it in my food processor. It's so easy. I just slowly drizzle in the molasses as the machine is running. The organic sugar is coarser but it works just as well. My daughter loves to help me make it and uses it on her hot cereal.
