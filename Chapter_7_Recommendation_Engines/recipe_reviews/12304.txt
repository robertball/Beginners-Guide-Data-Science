My grandmother was famous for making this pie! Here are a few tips that might help. Combine the dry ingredients together first, then add cream or evaporated milk or whole milk-do not add sweetened condensed milk because it changes the whole taste, into a saucepan and turn it to medium high. Bring it to a boil and stir constantly for a few minutes. It should darken and thicken. Pour into your pie crust and bake at 325 for around 30 minutes-but-you have to watch it carefully after 20 minutes because it could get too hot and boil over and ruin everything. If you see it start to boil in the oven, take it out-it's done! Enjoy!

Is something left out of this recipe or is the oven temperature wrong? I made this pie and it never did set, I even put it back in and cooked it 20 minutes longer.

I only had 1 12 oz can of evaporated milk so I used sweetened condensed milk to fill it out to the 2 cups needed.  It turned out excellent and was extremely well-received at Thanksgiving dinner.  Those lucky enough to get a piece raved about how it was the creamiest, sweetest sugar cream pie ever.

My wife raved about this, she was always talking about a local farm markets sugar cream pie and how the store bought ones didn't taste near as good. The market closed and she has been complaining that no one even comes close. Well I figured I would try this and she loved it. I did use heavy whipping cream and a tsp. of vanilla because I goofed when I went shopping and didn't get the evap. milk. I think I will keep useing the cream. Why change a good thing. Thankyou.

Pie was very good.  My husband was impressed, especially since my pies aren't usually very tasty.
I baked it at 315 degrees for 1 hour.

My sugar cream pie recipe uses real cream, but my local small grocery did not have any heavy cream and I had promised a sugar cream pie for a pitch-in so I found this recipe.  Very good.  Brown sugar gives it a different color and flavor, but good.  Will make again.

this is delicious, I have yet to check the calorie content, because its one pie  that keeps me coming back.  If you dont like custard, try this, its a good substitute.  If you DO like custard, try it anyhow!!!

quite good and quite easy. If you dare and want to give it a "frenchified" go, you can add a bit more salt into the crust (provided you make it yourself and don't use a bought one): and - voilà - you'll have a "caramel au burre salè" tart:-) I happened to do that by chance and the result was quite amazing. But it's a great recipe anyway
