Tasty! I am not a feta fan so just omitted the cheese, but very good. I only used the leaves of the chard, not the stalks. Will make again.

We liked this very much! Maybe a little too much onion (but my onion was big), but very tasty & quite pretty!

I was given some swiss chard from a fellow gardener- I like the idea of pairing it with other vegetables and flavors!
