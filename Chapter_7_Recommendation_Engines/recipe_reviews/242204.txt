Corn in a cup is something we would sell out of at concessions stands for my kid's track team in El Paso. I have to say the basics are there but the crema and lime juice per cup seemed a bit much but this is something that can be customized per a persons taste. Typically from when i've seen corn in a cup sold you can make your cup how you like for the most part. I instead mixed crema and chili powder together and dalloped on top of each cup of corn (and then added the cheese and hot sauce) and topped with a lime wedge to squeeze on top. I also sprinkled Tajin on top instead of salt.

The key is in the last sentence: "Feel free to adjust the proportions of lime juice, crema, cheese, and spices to taste!"

The proportions listed are a far cry from what I used, and mine came out so awesome that I am making it again.  Even our nanny from Mexico was raving about it.  Kids loved it too.

the big thing that I did differently is adding the lime juice to taste. the first time I made it the lime juice was very overpowering. the time after I started adding the lime juice a little at a time and ended up only using 1/4 cup without being to powerful. other than that it was great!!

I've been trying to figure out how to make Elote like my favorite gas station (Fuel City) without driving 15 minutes and I got it. i made a few substitutions based on how they make it.
layer it- frozen corn (Heated & then drained), squeezable butter, creama, the suggested cheese, Lemon pepper seasoning (to taste), cayenne pepper (to taste). Repeat. 

It's a great afternoon snack!

Yum! I used frozen corn that I pushed around in a cast iron skillet over high heat. Then I sprinkled it with Tajin, lime juice, crumbled queso fresco, and a dab of plain yogurt.

This was very good, but I recommend starting with small amounts of the crema and lime juice and tasting as you go. I only used a few tsps of lime juice and it was still overpowering. Next time I will start with a few drops.

Love this in the summer. In Mexico street vendors sell it from little push carts but instead of crema, mayonnaise is used plus Tajin. Love it both ways.

I tried making it but I honestly think you have to choose how much of chill and lime you personally like.

I forgot to add that I roasted the corn on the cob first with a little butter and salt before I shucked it.  When I use frozen corn for this recipe I thaw it completely and let it drain a bit, then toss it with a little salt and butter and roast it. PERFECTO!

I made it exactly as the recipe states. My kiddos loved it.  I do think 10 ears of corn is a bit much.

I could not find crema, so I mixed equal parts mayonnaise and sour cream.  I put out the mixture, the cheese, the chili powder, and the lime juice in small bowls for people to add as they wished.  It was a hit!  Thanks for a great side to serve with my enchiladas.

I made this and my family LOVED it. I added cilantro and only used one slice of lime juice, plus I used 1/2 sourcream and 1/2 mayonnaise in place of  MExican crema, but it wasnâ€™t DELICIOUS and it will definitely be made over and over again!
