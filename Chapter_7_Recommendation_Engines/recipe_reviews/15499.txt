Sorry, this recipe just did NOT do it for me. I come from PA Dutch country....I KNOW what a whoopie pie should taste like and this wasn't it. Don't get me wrong, the cookies were ok, but definitely not chocolatey enough. Also, as everyone else said, 10-12 minutes was too long and the edges got hard. The filling was the bad part though. Due to all the butter that is into it, that's all I taste when I ate one - butter. Also because of the butter I had to refrigerate them to keep the filling from separating. And I also had to almost double the filling recipe so I'd have enough to go into each "pie".

Very good recipe.  We liked the cake part, it was chocolatey enough for us.  We had to double the filling part of the recipe to fill all the pies.  We did cut back the butter, using only 3/4 the amount.  It was thick enough, and did not leak out like some people put in their review.  Will make again, these were yummy!!

This recipe is the exact one my mom received from a neighbor back in 1963. I've handed this recipe down to my daughter and shared it with so many family member and friends. It is the very best!

Always a classic in my house.  Recipe is super easy and they are the best whoppie pies I've ever tasted (and everyone who has tried them agrees!).

The cake batter was sticky and spread out, making flat chocolate cookies, which tasted good, but weren't whoopie pies. The frosting was very sweet, and didn't make enough for the amount of batter I had. Good, but not whoopie pies.

They taste great but the filling is to runny. I think cutting back on the butter might help

This recipe was ok. The cookie part didnt have a lot of flavor and only stay moist for a little while after they are out of the oven. Also they only take 7-8 minutes to bake completely, even that gives them a little crunch to the bottom. The filling had really good flavor but was a little runny, my tops kept sliding off.

These cookies are moist and the filling quite rich.  I made a double-batch to sell at my son's wrestling tournament and they went quickly!  Kids really like them.  It's important to wrap the pies in plastic wrap immediately upon filling them so they stay moist and allow the flavors to blend.

I guess I am the exception to the reviews. I have had really good whoopie pies before and these just didnt do it for me. You definately need to bake the cookies less than ten minutes 8 tops to keep them moist, I also thought the filling was more like frosting.. a bit overly sweet and rich, I also ran out of frosting before I used all my cookies but the kids seem to enjoy them without the filling anyway.. I might use the cookie part of the recipe but will keep searching for that perfect not-too-sweet , fluffy filling I remember as a kid was so good :)

They looked nice, but the chocolate part was icky and the edges were hard, and the "marshmallow" stuff was too runny.  Probably would have tasted better if I used mud in the cookie dough and Elmers glue for the filling!

AWESOME!!!! The whole family loved them! And my husband doesn't even care much for chocolate, but he's been bugging me to make these again! Definitely double the filling though.....only other problem I could find was that they didn't last long enough:) Thanks Diana!!

Very yummy! My kids loved them. Next time I think I may double the filling, that is what makes these so very good.

I love the taste of the cakes but they are too stiff to mix by hand, I mix mine by mixer. I also put some Philidelphia Cream Cheese in my middle just for extra flavor.

As per the reviews suggested, I used 2/3 C margarine & doubled the rest of the icing ingredients. I don't think I needed to-there was a ton of icing left! 
I didn't love the icing, thought it was pretty bland/fake tasting (I know I used margarine instead of butter, but I don't think butter could've saved these). The cake was good, but maybe I'd make a different icing next time.
