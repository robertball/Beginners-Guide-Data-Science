This was excellent! I cut the recipe in half but followed the recipe except for using a Cabernet Sauvignon rather than a burgundy (that's what was on hand). I must admit that while I was heating it for the photo tonight I was distracted and almost ruined it! It was still totally yummy. I would make this again for sure! Great stuff! Yum! Thank you CRANKYDOLL!

5.22.18  Instead of burgundy, I used a red wine blend which was already open.  The sauce thickened very quickly but I knew the alcohol needed to cook off, so I thinned out with a bit more beef broth and red wine.  I tasted and added a little more basil, oregano, and a shake of garlic powder (personal taste preference).  Didn’t care much for the reddish color of this sauce, so I did add some Kitchen Bouquet® to give it a little more eye appeal.  Nice rich sauce with a deep wine flavor and so very easy to make.  Nothing fancy today, this was served over a grilled ground beef patty, with mashed potatoes, carrots in dill butter, and some balsamic strawberries over egg custard for dessert.

The flavor of this sauce was delicious!  I made it as directed, but instead of just using it as a sauce, I browned cubed beef in the olive oil and butter mixture along with the onion and garlic.  Then I added the flour, just sprinkling it over the top of the beef and stirred it so the beef was covered.  I added the rest of the ingredients as the recipe indicated and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  I would have given it a rating of 5, but the sauce was too thin (I used the amounts the recipe called for on the flour, beef stock and burgundy).  I will add more flour next I make it to thicken the sauce.  I served it over egg noodles, and it was a hit with my family.

Made this for some filets tonight and it was really good. It was a bit thicker than I liked so I added another half cup of wine and broth to thin it out some. I also added a dash of thyme and rosemary to take the flavor up a bit. Overall this is a good recipe that you can extend to fit your tastes. Will definitely make again.

I needed a little more flour to make it thicken but otherwise followed the directions exactly.

So I was hearing so much about burgundy mushrooms but didn't want to wait 9 hours to try them so I thought this would be a nice compromise. The sauce was nice and turned into a thick gravy but I quickly realized that the mushrooms should have been browned first. I ended up having to simmer the while thing for almost 3 hours to brown the mushrooms. Used as a topper for roast or steak it's not bad but I wouldn't recommend it for a stand alone side.
