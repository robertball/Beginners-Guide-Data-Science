the recipe was pretty good, but i added a few ingredients that set it over the top and cooked it in a pressure cooker which cut the cooking time in half. I added about 2 tablespoons of salt and 3 whole cloves of garlic to the water.

This is my kids favorite food ever! They ask for it every weekend. I like to add a little lemon juice to the skillet when frying the tongue. I also mix the chopped tomatoes, onion, and cilantro with lemon juice, cumin, salt, and pepper to make "chismol". Together with rice and beans, these tacos are a perfect meal. Thanks for the recipe!

Hi Amy!
This is exactly the way my mother used to make these too! They are my all time favorite and my kids love them too! I Wouldn't eat them any other way, either.

Try the "tomatillo" relish, it works better.

Easy and straight forward. Tongue is an excellent meat for those of you a bit squeamish--don't be, it's worth the effort!

I used Buffalo tongue because that's what I had and it was great !  Frying the meat after boiling was the key. I also fryed the corn tortillas slightly and they were great that way.  The only thing I added was some avacado to the mix and it was like tacos from the mexican joints.
