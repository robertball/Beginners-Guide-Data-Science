I only made one switch out--one red bell pepper instead of green bell pepper because my family prefers the red over green. I topped each "joe" with a slice of sharp cheddar cheese. My husband and kids liked these sloppy joes, mostly because they were not sloppy. My husband said that was the best part because he could take the leftovers in his truck the next day and not worry about getting his lunch everywhere.

I've made this numerous times and never changed one thing .  The recipe is perfect as are all of Chef John's recipes.  If you're finding it more like soup, then you haven't let the water evaporate. You need to take your time and let it simmer for awhile. You will not be disappointed with the results.  It's delicious!!!

I actually made this recipe as is, except replacing the meat for meat analog so that the vegetarians in my household could also enjoy. I think with the liquid slowly reducing also help hydrate the meat analog which made the sloppy joes taste like the real meat version. As hubby said, who has been a vegetarian longer than I have been alive stated, it was better than his mom's sloppy joes that he ate when he was a kid. Two wonderful and definite thumbs up!!

Once again, Chef John, "Thank you" seems so inadequate.  Made this for dinner last night and there was happy silence from my husband's corner as he finished his portion and then not-so-silent (but relatively subdued lest he resemble Bambi in the headlights before running away) ecstatic chatter from mine, when he got up for seconds.  Normally, when I make sloppy joes, there is the animated discussion about how ketchup should be used only as a condiment on the side to adorn hot dogs, hamburgers, the occasional french fry, but it should never -- and he repeats never -- be used as an ingredient.  There was none of that with this meal :) -- not even the suspicious, "Did you put ketchup in this?" or the disappointed, "Honey, you Know I'm not a big sweet-and-sour fan".  A note to those reviewers who thought this was too "sloppy", I would say make this again and be more patient next time -- the liquid does evaporate eventually.  The flavour is superb that it is well worth the wait.   So .. Thanks again!  I have myself a new sloppy joe recipe!

I followed this recipe, but added some red bell pepper with the green bell pepper.  It smelled delicious while cooking, but after 45 minutes on the stove, it was still soupy.  I had to turn up the heat and add some cornstarch to thicken it up.  I then added the meat to rolled out biscuits, folded them over, sealed them up and baked in the oven for 15 minutes...Yum!

What can I say?  It's yet another Chef John HIT!  WE LOVED IT!  My son had 2of them last night!  If we hadn't already had French fries with our lunch, we would have had tater tots with it!  We settled for some coleslaw to accompany it instead  DELICIOUS!  AND...worth the time it takes to make it.  Be patient because I know the amazing smell it creates; just do it.  You won't be sorry ;-)  Made this again today for my husband.  He LOVES it!  SCORE!  made it as written, let it simmer for over an hour and it was AMAZING!!!!  I love Chef John and his creations!

Followed the recipe to a T and it turned out more like a soup than sloppy joe....I needed to add four tablespoons of flour to thicken up the sauce enough to eat on a bun. Overall the taste was good.

Boy does this recipe bring back memories! I haven't had sloppy joes since I was a kid. Definitely a "retro" kinda meal that dare I say...tastes better than my Mom's! This was so easy and so good - perfect for Sunday football. I doubled the recipe using 96/4 ground beef, one red pepper and one green pepper, half ketchup and half Bennetts Original Chili Sauce along with a generous splash of white wine vinegar, and brown sugar to taste along with the rest of the ingredients.  I highly recommend watching Chef John's video. It's only a few minutes long and was very helpful. You really do need to add the water and let it simmer down for at least 30 minutes - and don't be afraid to add the cayenne it really does make a difference but doesn't make it "hot". All I did was keep it warm in a crock pot during the game. I served these on slider rolls with chips and pickles to rave reveiws. Thanks Chef John for another awesome recipe!

This is a great base recipe for a standard sloppy joe. I used onion powder, sweet red pepper, and a good pinch of cayenne powder, doubled the worcestershire, and cut back some on the water. Instead of salt I used a bit of chicken bouillion granules. This took a little over an hour to simmer down to nearly dry. This was just standard sloppy joe, not tangy enough for me though and I like it kicked up a bit. But overall this was still pretty darned good, Thanks Chef John.

I am ashamed to say that I have been using a can mix for my sloppy joes for many years.  I did not have a can yesterday, but had a taste for a sloppy joe, so I googled a recipe.  I found this one and was so pleased that I had all of the ingredients.  I followed the recipe to a T, and it was sensational!!  Way better than the can and my hubby concurs!  No more cans for us!  Thank you, Chef John!

I was worried that this recipe didn't call for as much ketchup as the sloppy joes I grew up with, but this is an excellent recipe.  Followed directions to a tee, and they were great!

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I tweaked here n there. I did recalculate to 4 servings for 1 lb 91% grnd beef. I think that's fairly lean. Anyway, I salt n peppered the beef as it was being cooked/crumbled down. I also added a bit of Montreal Steak seasoning. I also had 1/3 C of chicken stock I needed to use up so in it went. I eyeballed the onion, grn pepper, worscester, etc. I did reduced the 2/3 cup of water in each application to 1/2 C. I felt the ketchup made it sweet enough for myself so I added a drizzle of molasses to get that flavor profile. Oh, I was lazy so used garlic powder. I think allowing the liquid to cook down is the way to go. I've been trying different recipes here and they were all too 'heavy' with the sauce for my pref. This reminds me of a cross between loose meat and SJ, which I really like! Oh yes, I did add a small amount of pecan liquid smoke as I like that little bit of a smokey flavor. Good stuff - is my go-to 'unsloppy joe' recipe from now on. Uncomplicated and easy, thanks a bunch CJ.

I think that this is a great and easy meal. It was easy to make and came out great. I followed as written. I only added a 1/2 cup of water the second time and this helps with it being to watery. Also if its still watery turn the heat up to med. so the water simmers out quicker (if you do this you have to stir every few minutes to keep it from burning).

As sloppy joes go, this was pretty good.  It wasn't as saucy I as remember as a kid, but I doubt Manwich would taste all that good today.  I enjoyed it.

I did this  with previously steamed lentils instead of meat. I used a whole onion and only maybe a half  cup of water since I didn't want lentils to go mushy. Also used yellow mustard instead of dijon, bumped up the W to 5-6 good dashes.

Delicious!!  My son came home from college tonight and I made these to welcome him home.  I wasn't sure how good they could be with such a simple bunch of ingrediants but they were great.  I had them simmering and ready to go while I waited for him to arrive.  I popped the buns into the oven to toast while the car was unpacked and served it with a ceasar salad.  Voila...he was as happy as a clam and wolfed them down with lots of yumms and comments about not eating caf food.  Hubby had 2!  There is chocolate cake to complete the night.  I made as written but subbed red pepper for green (personal preference) and just one cup of water.  This will be my go to recipe.  I liked all the ingrediants.  Thanks, Chef John.  Added: I have made this with ground beef, turkey and chicken.  Made it with and without the peppers.  Made it scaled with 1, 1 1/2 or 2 lbs of meat.  It always comes out great!  Serve with toasted buns, a salad or roasted veggies....delicious.

My husband and I were both happy with these sloppy joes as written. On the reviews I noticed some people had some problems with the water content. The recipe said to use a large skillet. If you use a smaller skillet or a pot it would take longer to evaporate. The more surface area you have to work with the quicker it will reduce. Just an FYI...

Pefect recipe for Sloppy Joes! The cooking method is what makes this recipe outstanding. The long simmer, because of the addition of water (best to use filtered so you don't have a tap water aftertaste), makes the meat tender and allows for all the flavors to come together well. No waiting overnight for this dish to improve. I do not like green peppers so I used a stalk of celery diced small instead. I did add a smidgen more of ketchup, mustard, brown sugar and Worchestershire sauce - but just a little of all to taste. I'll be using this recipe from now on. Another winner Chef John! Thanks.

I thought this was ok but I like a little more tomato flavor  so I added a 6 oz can of tomato paste and a TBS of Country Bob's steak sauce. Delicious.

Yummmm! I have made this recipe a few times (exactly as written) and my whole family loved it.  It reminds me of an old fashioned recipe - if there is one for Sloppy Joes... Simmering the filling for 45 minutes makes it seem like your making something more than fast food.  Don't forget the Tatter Tots - a Chef John recommendation :)

Made this recipe last night and must say there isn't much good about it.  First of all, I did not add the 2nd cup of water.  After adding the first it was already soupy and there wasn't need for another cup of water for a recipe that was touted as thick.  So after boiling down to appropriate consistency I took a taste and much to my dismay it tasted just like a plain hamburger with ketchup.  So, in an effort to save the meal I ended up adding the following:  An extra TBS of Dijon mustard, 2 tsp extra black pepper, and 2 TBS of "Bill Echols Taco Seasoning" (recipe on this site).   Sadly, I will be highly skeptical of any future "CHEF JOHN" recipes.  This is the 2nd time I have been highly disappointed with what he has contributed although this is the first time I have posted so.  Honestly, I don't think this recipe was tested this before it was contributed.  The 2nd cup of water still mystifies me.  Look for another recipe or just make a hamburger and use ketchup and you will save yourself a lot of time and disappointment.

This turned out yummy, but it calls for WAY too much water. We only used 1 cup and it took 45-50 mins for it to get close to sloppy joe consistency. We also added more ketchup and Worcestershire sauce towards the end because the water seemed to dilute the flavor.

I have this simmering on the stove as I am typing this.  I have made this several times and it comes out perfect every single time.  I use red pepper instead of the green and I reduce the last adding of water to only 1/2 a cup but other than these 2 minor changes, I follow the rest of recipe exactly.  This is the only recipe I use since the first time I tried it.  You will not be disappointed!!!

These had to be the best sloppy joes we have ever had.  Followed directions exactly except that I might have had a bit more ground beef than called for and possibly I ran out of ketchup before reaching the required amount but it didn't matter anyway. Served over ciabatta hamburger buns, hubby and I inhaled these last night for dinner. A bit of grated sharp cheddar to top it off. Added to my regular rotation. Thanks for posting.

This hit the spot!!  Absolutely perfect consistency with just the right amount of tang.  I added a bit more than a dash of Worcestershire sauce but otherwise followed the recipe.  No cayenne for us but the simmering for at least an hour is what makes this just so yummy.  Thanks Chef John for another fantastic recipe.  I've been making another sloppy joe recipe from here but if I'm not in a big hurry this will be my go-to recipe.

This is so good. I followed the recipe exactly and it made 10 sandwiches. My son said they were the best sloppy joes he ever had.  At first it seems theres too much water in the recipe, but after 40 minutes of simmering, it all boiled down and it was perfect consistancy. Definitely going to make these again and I wouldnt change anything.

This is excellent! I agree with many others that patience is a virtue. Let it simmer  the whole 45 minutes. Unfortunately I don't have gas so on a electric stove top simmer is about 3 or 4. on the dial. 5 stars from the family

I used beef stock and jalapenos, loose hot sausage and ground venison. Was a little sweet. Hard to believe the recipe calls for 2 cups of plain water instead of beef stock.

Very tasty. I used ground turkey instead of beef and only added 1/2 cup of water. I also added some additional seasonings such as italian, garlic powder and paprika. I would definitely make it again.

Great recipe! My husband loves sloppy joes but grew up eating the canned stuff which I think is horrible and too sweet. This recipe is perfect for both of us and the kiddo loves it too. I’ve made it a couple of times and didn’t change anything.

These are the best sloppy joe's we've ever had.  I went searching for recipes because I dislike the canned sauces.  This is a home run.  The family loved it.  We added just a tad horseradish which helps cut the sweetness a bit.  Thanks Chef John!

Loved this! I let it simmer for an hour until it was the consistency I wanted. Next time I will cut down on the brown sugar as it was a bit sweet for us. This is perfect for making a large batch & freezing in meal size pouches to have on hand and wouldn't it be great to use on a hot dog for a change up from chili

After seeing that canned Sloppy Joe mixes contain High Fructose Corn Syrup, I came online to find a recipe I could make from scratch. This recipe lived up to my expectations. I started with only half the amount of brown sugar and tasted it as it mixed in. I ended up adding another 1/2 tablespoon as my ketchup added a strong vinegar component and the brown sugar helped even that out. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. My kids were always on the fence about Sloppy Joes, but this time they enjoyed them and even ate up the leftovers. Note: Make sure your ketchup doesn't contain HFCS if you are trying to avoid it like I am.

This is such a great recipe. I love how American it really tastes lol. I followed the exact ingredient but I added a tablespoon of tomato paste. I also didn’t brown the beef, I just made sure it wasn’t pink. I wanted to make it thicker because I don’t like the idea of soggy bread so I left it to thicken for quite a bit.
It was a hit and we absolutely loved it. I used homemade buns with a side of baked potato and carrot fries. Yum!!

This was a total hit with my picky eater husband and son!! I let it simmer over medium and the liquid was absorbed in 30 min using a large stainless steel pan. Such an easy weeknight meal and I always have the ingredients on hand. My son requested it goes into our monthly meal rotation! Thanks Chef John!

Another Chef John winner! Amazing how a simple dish like sloppy joes can make such a fantastic meal. Definitely take the time to simmer long enough to evaporate all the liquid. The flavor of the beef mixture was out of this world. Served on toasted buns with sliced green onions and dill pickles. Hubby raved about this meal, only thing  he complained about was eating too much.

We don’t eat beef so I was looking forward to making this with ground turkey. The only thing I didn’t do was add the green pepper and cayenne pepper. It was delicious!

This was a delicious recipe. Not soupy at all, as long as you give it the time to reduce, and once it reduces that is where the flavors come out. Definitely not your traditional sloppy joe out of the can (I can't stand that stuff!) This is soooo much better, and well worth the wait! Be patient people, it will be worth it!

As usual, Chef John comes through again. This recipe is both easy and delicious. I noticed many complained about it being “soupy,” but I suspect each didn’t cook it down long enough. To do so, keep the lid off of the skillet while it bubbles at a good pace. Remember: you’re trying to reduce the liquid. If you’re in a hurry, you can cut the amount of water in half, but the flavors will have less time to meld.

This is an excellent Sloppy Joe recipe. My husband loves it. He says it is way better than the canned stuff. I agree. I followed the recipe pretty closely although I used red bell pepper &  I added a fresh diced tomato about the last 10 minutes.  For the people who are finding it soupy, it needs to be cooked medium high or high depending on you stove top. Some get hotter than others.  Plus, the water is added in two separate interval.  I mix the first cup with my ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, salt, pepper & cayenne (I do not care for Worcestershire). Then once that has cooked down to almost dry I add the second cup of water.  Then cook that down to almost dry.  It takes about 35-40. This is an excellent base recipe. Of course you can always add or subtract based on your own preferences. This has now become my go to Sloppy Joe mix.

None with the exception of a making a smaller amount, as it is just my husband and I.  However, I have doubled it before as well, when kids and grand kids were eating with us. I've tried several sloppy joe recipes and have never been completely pleased with any of them until I tried this one.

I doubled the ketchup for more tang. I tripled the Worcestershire, I also doubled the onion.  My family doesn't like green or red peppers so I omitted.  TIP:  You have to let this boil down until there is ZERO liquid remaining. Plan at least an hour for this dish to be it's finest, maybe a bit more.  It was delicious! Thanks, Chef John.

This is another delicious recipe from Chef John.  No need to change anything!  It did take a little longer than 45 minutes for the water to boil off completely but I just let it go a while longer and it turned out perfect.

I didn’t have a green pepper so I used a orange pepper instead. Overall it was good but I found it on the sweet side. Next time I will use 1 tablespoon  of brown sugar instead of 2.

Simple, easy, tasty.  I followed the recipe and arrived fairly close to Chef John's result.  Lots of room to modify to suit individual testes.  I have some fire roasted diced tomatoes in the pantry that I plan to add to my next batch.

It was good!  Smelled so good while cooking too.  I had to omit the onion and garlic due to diet restrictions but it was still good.  I used 2 small yellow peppers instead of green (I don't like green peppers).  I let it simmer for 45 minutes.  It was a tad soupy but still good.  I think next time I may try adding tomato paste or some canned chopped tomatoes in place of the ketchup and some of the water.
Update - Made it again tonight and replaced the ketchup with a 6 oz. can of tomato paste.  The result was much less soupy.  I will use the paste from now on.

We love the taste and it is now my go to recipe for sloppy Joe’s. You usually always have the ingredients on hand. I only use one cup of water and will probably cut back some more. Even with one cup, it takes longer than 45 minutes to thicken up.

I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce & simmered for another 30 minutes. Used red pepper because I don't like green pepper (& the color was nice!). Added some cumin and chili powder because that is the "chili flavor" that I need.  Great sloppy joes &  even used it for chili topping for hot dogs. Plan on throwing my other hot dog sauce recipe away & using this! Yes, would definitely make it again!

Very good recipe. I added a bit of habanero sauce when it was simmering down to give it an extra kick. It may have been a bit too sweet without the heat.

For whatever reason, I was craving sloppy joes - probably haven't had one since 1983!  This recipe hit the mark. I used red pepper instead of green, added a dash of granulated garlic (as well as the 'real' garlic), and about 1 tsp of dried onion flakes (in addition to the real onion).  Low, slow, simmer is what makes this recipe come together.   Israeli salad on the side (also from this site). I served with shredded sharp cheddar. Good on toasted hamburger buns, or rolled up in a tortilla.

I do this a LOT! Great for company; do double batches for the freezer; excellent for potlucks and family gatherings. Accidentally doubled the ketchup twice last time I did a double batch. Guess what! MUCH more flavorful results. Will continue with that practice. Use all kinds of burger; whatever is on sale; mainly turkey and beef; chicken not real satisfactory for texture.

This will be my new go-to recipe for Sloppy Joes. I made as written but substituted Yellow pepper for green. Don't like green peppers. I was skeptical with all the water in it but it boiled down nicely. You have to be patient and follow the directions. I used this on a french loaf cut in half lengthwise and topped with grated cheese. I baked it on a cookie sheet at 350 for 10 minutes. Very yummy.

Whoa, Way too sweet! That was even with  cutting  the sugar in half. Of course ketchup has a lot of sugar on it's own. If I ever make this recipe again will leave out the sugar altogether. I put about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, helped to cut the sweet. I also subbed dark beer for water. Put in a few dashes of hot sauce.   I usually love Chef John's recipes, but this one not so much. The other favors are good, it's just for me and my family, the sweet overpowered all.

Consistency  was fine, fresh peppers were nice but overall the combination of ketchup and sugar was way to sweet (even after reducing the sugar) Other than sweet very bland. Going back to an envelope of low-sodium Sloppy Joe seasoning, Rotel tomatoes with chiles and a small can of tomato sauce.

After reading the reviews I decided to add only 3/4 cup of water in total and use only 1 tbls. sugar. Still too sweet and had to cook for an hour  to reduce the liquid. Also added quite a bit of cayenne to distract from the sweetness.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out perfect!  I loved the flavor the mustard gave it. Who'd have thought?  Those who said theirs was soupy did not let it simmer long enough.  And to add flour?  What?  Give it time - it's worth it!  My husband said as he ate his third sandwich, you know this is really good!  I could have slapped him because I'm a pretty decent cook and to say that about something that was so easy to make.  Hmmm.  Anyway I love watching chef John's videos.  He has made me a better cook. Thank you!

DELICIOUS! I always find Chef John's recipes to be top notch, so I was somewhat taken aback when making this Sloppy Joe recipe.  It seemed so watery and frankly, kinda gross.  WRONG!  If you follow the recipe you will end up with one of the best Sloppy Joe sandwiches you've ever eaten.  Be patient, let the water simmer away until the meat is dry, and jazz it up a bit for your tastes (I added more heat for my family).  Making them again this afternoon, along with Chef John's hamburger buns, and my family will be thrilled.  Great recipe!

This was definitely a success ... I let it simmer for 50 minutes and it was perfect consistency; I only had  1 lb of ground beef but kept all other ingredient amounts the same; used sweet orange peppers since that's what was in my garden. I toasted the buns and served open face. DH said they were best he's ever had ... quite the compliment, Chef John!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.   I let it simmer for a long time on the stove, longer than what is stated in the recipe.  It was well worth it.   This is my new sloppy joe recipe.

These were really good - everyone in the family liked.   Followed recipe exactly.  A lot of stirring time involved, but worth it.  Not as messy as sloppy joes normally are.

I've made this several times. Sometimes with beef, or I'll use ground turkey, and once I did a combination of both meats to still have the beef flavor but not all the fat. It has turned out great every time! The most recent time I made it I was in a hurry so didn't add the second cup of water at the end. I still let the liquid evaporate and it took much less time and was still great!

I have made this so many times I have lost count. In fact this is the first Chef John recipe I ever made. It is common place for dinner now. All I do differently is no cayenne. I Served on sesame seed buns with tots or onion rings of course. If you haven't been to Chef Johns blog food wishes, do yourself a favor and check it out.

Great sloppy joe.  My family loved it.  Be patient and maybe turn up the heat a bit and it  WILL thicken.  I doubled the recipe and it took a little over an hour to thicken.  Just allow extra time.  Worth it!

WOW, this Sloppy Joe recipe will be my go to recipe from now on!  I had a ton of potato rolls leftover from a picnic, so I decided to try this Sloppy Joe recipe…and it is perfect!  My only change to the recipe was to replace the green pepper with some paprika because a few of my family members do not like peppers.  I took the other reviewers advice and did let it simmer until the liquid absorbed, which it did and it turned out great!  Thanks Chef John!

I can't believe that I am going to suggest changing one of Chef John's recipes, but as is I have to agree that there is too much water. After I let mine simmer for an hour, made Chef John's cottage fries to go with this, there was still a lot of water. I did not want to drain out the flavor or add flour, so I increased the mixture to a high heat and it boiled off in about 8 minutes. When I tried the mix it was too sweet for my family's taste, so I added Frank's hot sauce for a kick and another big squeeze of yellow mustard to combat the sweet taste. My husband loved the result although we discussed using only half of the brown sugar next time. My toddler refused to touch it, but oh well, my husband enjoyed his as well, and my son was enjoying eating the fries.

Enjoyed this, however with the second cup of water, it took at least an hour to simmer down.  I think however this is what makes the final result so good. 2nd TIME: Used regular ground beef (not lean) so the fat had to be drained.  Added only 1T of  brown sugar, seemed good w/o too sweet. Reduced water by 1/2 a cup.

I absolutely loved these sloppy joes. They cooked down very nicely and were not soupy as some folks had suggested. The cayenne pepper turned a childhood favorite into a more adult version. I think the cayenne makes this recipe 5 stars!

Since I like my Joes on the "sweet" side, this was delicious!  I liked the fact that these were not laden with heavy tomato sauce, of which I don't care for.  Two full cups of water seemed way too much for this recipe.  One cup of water seemed to be plenty.  Adding more just didn't make any sense.  It still took awhile for it to cook down to the consistency I was looking for.  The flavors were heaven.  Other than a reduction in water, I wouldn't change a thing.  I'll never buy a packet or can again.  Thanks, Chef John!

It was just okay. But I did use a red pepper and ground turkey. Maybe that's why. I'll try again with beef and green pepper.

Quite a nice variation on Sloppy joes! I always love Chef John's stuff and I learned a new thing (about how to get it so it's crumbly). I followed it exactly, but mine turned out soupy which was disappointing and I guess I didn't leave it long enough (even though it was there for about 35 min. pretty much unchanged). Ah well, the flavours were nice, and after I drained a bit of the juices it was quite yummy. I'll try it again sometime to see if I can get the better consistency. Lovely recipe though!

These turned out super amazing.  The video really helped to point out to let the liquid simmer out.  Mine took a little longer to get the required consistency so check the food not the time.  I served it on home made buns and they were an instant hit.

To us, the meat had a good flavor but once you put it on the buns it just wasn't strong enough. Made sort of a bland dinner.

Served these for lunch today sprinkled with mozzarella cheese.  I used ground chuck and all of the ingredients as listed. This is not a quick recipe as you must allow the ingredients to simmer for at least 45 minutes to allow all of the water to be absorbed. Everyone loved it. It is a keeper Chef John!

Love this!!! I have made it several times. My family loves it. I've added smoke chipotle powder and ancho chili powder instead of cayenne. Takes it to another level. I also reduced the water a little. All and all an easy quick dinner for a busy family on the go!!

Too soupy, took forever to reduce likely due to the 2 cups of water. Also a little too sweet and not as tangy as I wanted. I'll be using less sugar but I don't know how to make it tangier.

First time making this and even after simmering for 45 minutes it was very soupy. If I make this again I would cut it down to 1 cup water. Maybe 2 cups was a misprint?

I love Chef Johns sloppy joes and Turkey toms( made with turkey). I have learned not to use as much water and to cook it down as he suggests.

Made as written and it was not quite tangy/complex enough.  Added cocoa powder (1T) and cider vinegar (1T), and it was perfect.  A great base recipe to add to.

Yum. Family requests that I use this recipe from now on.  I am not a “by the book” cook- but any changes I made were only due available items at my house without running to the store.

The taste is good.  However, I doubled the batch and had a huge pot of soup on my hands.  This was for a carry-in at work so I'm not really happy about it.  When I get it to work I'll definitely have to put some corn starch or flour in it to thicken it up.  I would add water as needed....

I have made this recipe several times, and it has always been a hit. I have used ground beef and ground venison. When I made it for grandkids, I left out the green pepper. When I make it for my husband, I sub red pepper for green because he likes it better. I made it for my parents, and you would have thought it was a 5-star meal by the way my dad went on about it. (I think he was just grateful for a home-cooked meal because my mom had been sick.) Very versatile and easy recipe which is why it’s one of go-to options on a busy day.

Really good Sloppy Joe recipe!  I understand needing to reduce the liquid to enhance the flavor but it took FOREVER to reduce. It definitely is not  a "I have a pound of ground beef and I need a quick meal" kind of recipe. However it is delicious!

Easy to put together - basically a one pot prep. I used half lean beef/half ground pork. Served at a pot luck on slider buns. It was a crowd pleaser!

I have made this with beef and it was so good that I tried it with veggie meatless crumbles, it came out really sweet, and I'm sure that's because of the protein. I had to double the seasonings and even easily added a couple of tablespoons of chili powder and some cumin. I simmered much longer to get it to thicken nicely. Satisfying comfort food served with crispy FF just like being a kid again!

Good for sloppy joes (certainly better than the canned stuff),  but think I'll keep it for very good hot dog sauce!  Used red pepper and did only 2/3 of recipe because I only had 1 lb of burger thawed--was plenty for 4 sandwiches with a little left over.  Took at least an hour of hearty simmering to reduce all the liquid though--I'll note that on the recipe that I print and put in my book of keepers!

I used my homemade salsa in lieu of ketchup, substituted beef broth in lieu of water, horseradish in lieu of mustard added celery and more peppers and reduced sugar to 1tbn. It was delicious. Excellent.

My first attempt and fiancé said it smelled like the canned version but better!  I cooked it until it had some sauce but not a ton - step-son said he preferred it more "sloppy" but we liked it and I'd do it the same again.

Had hamburger and buns to grill burgers, but thunderstorms called for a plan B.  I didn’t have enough ketchup so I used a little BBQ sauce.  Turned out great! The cayenne pepper made a huge difference.  Everyone loved it! Thx for a great rainy day dinner!

I love Sloppy Joes, my husband does not. I had a craving for some this week. I looked at this recipe and it sounded good. I also looked at the reviews, which I do before making a recipe.  After reading the comments, I made it with only one change. I used ground chicken instead of bee. This is because I have to watch purines in my diet. Oh, and I accidently  forgot worchestershire sauce. My husband asked me to make this again. He was surprised as to how much he liked these sloppy joes. And, yes, I will remember worchestersire sauce next time.

This has become a staple for us! We like spicy so we omit the bell pepper and add two minced serrano peppers. We add extra worcestershire sauce, and reduce the brown sugar to 1 Tbs. Delicious!

I almost ruined it with too much Worcestershire sauce, I had to pour out the sauce and mess with it a little to get rid of the overpowering taste. My dash was a little heavy-handed haha. Otherwise it was good!

Delish!  Doubled the onion and pepper,  left out the carrot, and added a splash of worcestershire and about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce.

I used 2 lbs of ground beef  instead of 1 1/2. And I added one chopped jalapeño for an extra kick. It was mmm mmm good.

Absolutely love this. I try my best to follow the recipe exacty, but I go with my own flow so it's a wee bit different each time. (Nothing crazy. Same ingredients... just a hint more mustard or worcestershire. Some chipotle.  I like a little zip.)  Great, unfussy (and delicious) meal for casual company!

Turned out good!!! Don’t need that much water though, took longer to evaporate and thicken, will definitely use less next time..other than that it came out good

Made it with one pound of ground venison and used yellow mustard because it was what I had on hand. It was the best sloppy joe I've ever had! Kids loved it.

I didn't spring for the extra lean meat. I used the regular fatty ground beef and then drained and squeezed the meat with paper towel to remove most of the fat drippings. Worked well. Everything else I did the same. Tastes great!

Taste was very good, but it looked pretty soupy so I only used 1/2 cup of water after I had all the ingredients in the pan.  Simmered for 45 minutes and the consistency was good.

This recipe has good flavor and was a hit.  The thick texture made for  an easy to handle sandwich.  I agree with the other reviews - low simmer for full 45 min to achieve the thick consistency and depth of flavor.  I made the following changes: omitted ketchup and added 6 oz tomato paste and 2 Tbs barbecue sauce; used 1 Tbs brown sugar instead of 2.

My boys loved yet another one of chef Johns delicious recipes! I didn’t use the bell pepper and cayenne powder and listened to reviews and cut the water ratio to 1 1/2 cup and made sure that the sauce was at a simmer on medium low heat. The sauce took about 45 minutes to thicken but well worth the wait. I took the recommendation on serving it with taters and peas on the side and they devoured it! Thank you chef John!

I made it! I didn't add as much water, I'm inpatient for evaporation but, it turned out DELISH!!! Shared it on Facebook and my mother confessed of being a Chef John food lover. Like Mother, like Daughter! This is now on the menu and ingredients, I've had them already, except the fresh stuff. very simple to whip up! Tastes like cheese will go well but I have never had Sloppy Joe with cheese. Tastes like it would go though! Will try next time! Thank you! :)

This is the perfect sloppy joe recipe.  I made two changes.  First, I drained off most of the grease, so I would not get a sloppy mess, then instead of cayenne I used chili powder.  Chili powder is good if you only want a little bit of spice.

This is now my "go to" recipe for Sloppy Joes.  It takes a tad more time to make compared to others, but it is worth it.  With only two tablespoons of brown sugar, it is not too sweet.  The only change is that I use only one cup of water; not two.

I make this recipe at least once a month. I love, love it. But I love most of Chef John's recipes. As others have mentioned,  be patient and let the liquid evaporate. My only addition is a chopped jalapeno. 
Thanks Chef John!

if you are trying to replicate this stuff in the can this seems pretty close. But it is sweet.

because the recipe didn't adjust for fewer servings i had to fake it a bit. I don't eat beef so i used ground turkey which is a bit more wet than beef so i lessened the water a lot. i added enough water to the ketchup mix (about 2/3rds of a cup instead of 3/4ers) to fill the measuring cup to 1 full cup. which with the drippings made it quite moist. then added about 3/4 of another cup of water but if  you don't want to be there all night up the heat a bit to reduce a bit faster. reduced the salt radically and added some pepper flakes and a lot more Worcestershire. with burger sized naan and a bit of mozzarella it was a nice fake of a fast food meal except i know what i put in it.

I made this recipe today. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of reducing water to 1 cup. I would probably even cut back more if I make again. I browned the beef and tossed everything in the crockpot on low for 5 hours. the consistency was perfect but the flavor was missing that zing. I will make again but most likely add a hint of a good bbq sauce to kick it up a notch. thank you for always posting great recipes Chef John.

I have made this twice.  Both very yummy! I prefer to use 2 heaping TBLS of brown sugar as I did the 2nd time I made it. Only a preference of mine.

The only change I made was using a red bell pepper instead of green because that's what I had. My husband is very particular about his sloppy joes and he loved these.

I quadrupled the recipe to serve for my 8th graders on field day & it's PHENOMENAL!! The key as many other reviewers have stated is the simmering. Not having a skillet large enough, after browning the ground beef in batches, I combined in a stew pot, added double Dijon (I also like it more tangy & less sweet), 2 cups beef broth instead of water & used red bell pepper instead of green. Everything else was the same except simmering time was more like 3 hours on low-med-low. Is there anything you can't "master", Chef John!?

I have made this recipe many times. It is a winner in our house. I follow instructions and it turns out great. You do have to be patient and really let this meat mixture simmer to have the flavors concentrate and develop. I butter the buns and grill them for some really nice crunch and then top with the sloppy joe meat. I have also used leftover sloppy joe meat and topped baked potatos or even macaroni and cheese. My neices and nephews LOVE it!

When searching for a sloppy joe recipe I'm always looking for one that is thicker than most so I was excited to try this recipe.  The flavors were really good, I only added one tablespoon of brown sugar as we don't like our joes too sweet and I omitted the last cup of water as I felt it wouldn't make the recipe as thick as I wanted.  My family gobbled up the sandwiches and asked for more.  Thank you Chef Jon for a fantastic recipe!

absolutely love this recipe.  Easy to make and you can put the cayenne on the side if people don't like the spice.  I personally think the cayenne adds an extra kick that is phenominal.

My husband thinks Manwich is THE only sloppy joe.  But I don't so I've been looking for a recipe similar enough in taste but homemade.  Well this got an actual smile from my husband and a note that it's a keeper.  He didn't like the brown sugar so I'll probably not add that next time.  The only change I made (I know, I know) was adding a heaping tbsp of tomato paste and a dash of cumin.  Very easy recipe and highly recommend.

Excellent, but I didn't add the second cup of water and it still took an extra 45 minutes simmering to reduce enough.

I've made this recipe dozens of times and it's the best sloppy joe out there, period. The only change I make is to cut the water down by half, which in turn cuts down the cooking time. The flavor is still just as delicious, so you aren't missing out by reducing the long simmer time. It also makes leftovers that are worth fighting for--assuming you have any. ;-)

This is the second time I've made this recipe. I really love this. It's so simple. The flavor is outstanding. I'm not going back to the pre-packaged stuff, ever. I understand the comments about it being less saucey, my husband also loved this, but felt the same way. He wanted a thicker sauce. But.. I personally don't think the soupy comments gave this recipe justice because, that's an individual, human error,  or tool error. Every stove is different. There's really no need for flour. You just have to continue to cook it down. Bump up the heat if you have to, and make sure you're not covering it.

We loved it. I made it low-carb by using reduced sugar ketchup and Surkin Gold brown sugar replacement. Served it on low-carb pita bread. Delish! I wasn’t sure about those two cups of water, but I added them anyway, and they were perfect.

Wow, this was really good! I didn't have green peppers on hand (and it was definitely missed), so I added tomatoes from my garden to use them up. They added alot more liquid than I was expecting so I had to spoon out nearly 8oz of liquid.

This has become my new go-to sloppy joe recipe. I like that it's not overly sweet, or overly tomato-y. I questioned putting that much water in the recipe, but it really does cook down and creates an "almost dry" delicious sloppy joe. Thank you for sharing the recipe, Chef John!

Excellent.. made with 1 pound beef 1/2 pound pork that I need to use up. Used red peeper in place of green (just preference) and omitted onion as my children don’t like it. The flavor was excellent and I wouldn’t change a thing flavor wise. Perfect comfort food from childhood. Served with lays potatoe chips since that is how we enjoyed them as kids. Plus it gave my kids a night off of quinoa and risotto type grownup foods we usually have for dinners.  This was perfect !

A very good Sloppy Joe, but it's Chef John, so no surprise there. I made a Halloween Monster out of them tonight to celebrate the season.

Very quick and easy recipe.  It was delicious except I forgot the salt and it definitely needed some. I also used tomato paste instead of ketsup. I will definitely make it again!

I made it the first time as directed and thought that it had a really good flavor. The second time I left out the second cup of water and in its place put in 1 1/2 cups of medium picante sauce and that really made it rock!!!

I made this recipe this summer to feed 80 hungry marching-band students & music leaders during UHS Sweat Week.  It went over well, and was happily received by the students. I was delighted at how easily I was able to cook all the ingredients together (I used my counter-top turkey roaster), AND that the flavor remained as delicious as it had been a week earlier when I tested the recipe. I'm making this again tonight, and I'm going to add it to my monthly menu rotation. YUM YUM!!!

I did not make this for a long while, but then my family started to ask why. They love it so it has been put back into regular rotation.

I added a small jalapeno and replaced the some of the brown sugar with honey.  I also used chipotle chile pepper instead of the cayenne.

I hadn't had sloppy joes in years, and this recipe brings it all back home.  The only change I made was to not add the second cup of water, because all that seemed to do was increase the cooking time while waiting for it to boil away.  I've made this a couple of times now, and will make it again I'm sure.

This recipe is so good! It gets better if it simmers the full time. Just add a bit of water if it gets too dry. The flavors meld so well.

I usually make Ree Drummond's recipe but wanted to try something a little different.
While this was good, it was lacking in flavor in comparison .  I had to keep adding salt, pepper and brown sugar plus tomato paste until I got a desirable flavor.

Mine never did thicken up even though I cooked it over an hour.   The taste seemed to be missing something, so I added some barbeque sauce and a little chili powder.

This was just delicious.  The smell of it simmering drove us wild. Lol!  I live in Belgium and I think there may be more sugar in their Ketchup, so I plan on using less brown sugar next time as a consequence. I may add some paprika for another layer too. But, it really was just like I had a child and I will look at other chef John recipes.

Followed the recipe exactly except adding extra onion because we love onions. Came out great!! The only thing I may do differently is add less water.

Easy to make and very tasty. Used leftovers for sloppy joe nachos! Did have to simmer about a half hour longer than recipe states to get the correct consistency.

Amazing! My pickiest of eaters even ate it all. My husband absolutely hates sloppy Joe's so he was disappointed when I told him what was for dinner. He wasn't disappointed for long, especially after his 2nd & 3rd helping! Definitely making it again.

This was a big hit. DH said it was the best sloppy joe recipe I've used (and I've made quite a few). I found that I needed to reduce for over an hour and still needed to thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry so next time, will simply reduce the water to about 1 1/2 cups. Also, due to the long simmering time, the peppers were very soft and I prefer more of a crunch so may just add those in a bit later in the process. I made as listed except subbed coconut sugar for brown sugar and totally forgot to put in the cayenne.

Followed chef John's recipe.  Took closer to an hour to reduce down but worth the wait, so will plan for that next time.  Use fresh buns,  wonderful flavour.  Right about the sweet and heat, don't add to much cayenne, just enough to taste a little heat.   Might kick it up a notch next time by melting mozza over the open face sandwich.

I loved this version of sloppy joes.  I followed the recipe as listed.  It was such a hit at our Father's day picnic that I tripled the recipe and made it the following weekend for our family reunion.  I will be using this recipe every time I make sloppy joes.

I did 16 servings (4 pounds of ground beef) and once it had simmered, put it in the fridge overnight then took to work - threw it in the crock pot on low. Was DELICIOUS!!  Everyone raved about it and I didn't have much to bring home. Sitting overnight really melded the flavors together.  Oh! I added one large bell pepper & one large red bell pepper.

Thank you Chef John!!

I am in love with this recipe! Omitted the bell pepper since husband doesn't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe. So delicious!

It was a little sweet so I added a touch of vinegar. It was even better the second day.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out a bit greasy.  I used 93% ground beef.  I'll fix that next time by draining the browned meat.  Flavor, and texture are great!  I will make this many more times.

Dad and I loved this recipe! Neither of us have really liked sloppy joes, but we enjoyed this one. I omitted one cup of water and it simmered down perfectly. Neither of us really knew how to handle a whole bun stuffed with filler, so we did it open face. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutly gorgeous I've made it twice now and both times the family were delighted. I even found they managed to eat crispy salad in the bun with it  and said it was perfect match. That is a real bonus to me with a house that is full of salad dodgers

These were amazing! Even my husband loved them and said that we should make these again. I plan to make up a batch ahead of time and take them to the campground with us this summer. It definitely takes awhile for them to thicken up, so prepare for that cooking time. There will be no more Manwich is our house!!

Used a red pepper instead of green - no garlic - yellow mustard and more than a pinch of cayenne.  I only added a little water at a time - did not want it to be soupy.  Good taste - it's a keeper!

I was reluctant to try this recipe at first because my experience with Sloppy Joes has not always been very good but it was Chef John so I thought I would give it a shot.  Made the recipe exactly as written and was not disappointed.  Both my husband and I agree this is a keeper!

These are the best sloppy joe's I have ever made! I have never had much luck making them, tried lots of different recipes  always found something I didn't like about them. Not with these! They are absolutely delicious, make a double batch cause they aren't going to be around long. Only thing I changed is I only added 1/2 of cup of water the second time, leaves sauce more flavorful, also did not add cayenne pepper as I do not like them.

I live in NM so the only thing I changed was substituting green chiles for the red bell pepper!!  Excellent.   It took about 60 minutes to simmer out the liquid.  Well worth the time.  Delicious.

Best sloppy joe recipe I've made. Next time I will add a couple of Jalapenos (just because everything's better with jalapeno.)
I did have to simmer it for nearly 2 hours to get the consistency I wanted, but this also tenderized the beef.
Excellent sloppy joes

I made this again today and doubled the recipe.  Two cups of water was way too much.  One cup of water for doubled recipe is enough.   
Only change I made was to use red pepper flakes (about 1 TBL)instead of black pepper.  Did not add any Cayenne.  Easy to make and always a hit!

This is the best of the Sloppy Joe recipes I have tried.  I topped the sandwiches off with "Zesty Bread & Butter" pickle chips by Vlasic.  It was a real hit.

I loved it. Grew up with something made  with Alphabet soup but many  canned ones I've tried were not impressive either. This was what I always thought it should taste like. My wife did not care for the sweetness so now we settle of 1/2 the brown sugar. Still great.

Sorry, Chef John.  This was the first recipe of yours that I didn't love.  Too sweet for me (maybe just my tastebuds).  I also cooked it for over  an hour and it was still too wet.  If I make it again, I will use less, if any, brown sugar and less water.

Loved it! I followed the directions to a tee and was very pleasantly surprised by the mix of flavors and the little hot pepper kick at the end. The sweet and hot kick really made the sloppy Joe. I also loved that it wasn't "sloppy" like Mamwich. Like others said about letting it simmer. I was certain it would be to watery but after 45 minutes it was nice and thick. Patience guys, good things come to those who wait! Thanks chef John, I'll definitely be making more of your recipes.

I followed the recipe exactly and we all loved it. I was a little skeptical about the two cups of water but it's really the trick to making the consistency right. I will certainly be making it again! One thing I know for sure is that if Chef John's name is on it, it will be fabulous.

I did everything as written with the exception of no water. Once vegetables & meat were cooked, I added the catch-up, 
de John, brown sugar, worcestershire. Mixed it all then added beef broth as needed until I liked the consistency.  Season to taste.

We loved it! Never using canned sloppy joe sauce again.

The only thing I changed was that I used only 11/2 cups of water. I am not a sloppy Joe fan, but I loved this dish. Great when family or friends stop by. Keep up the good work chef john.

Made this recipe per instructions.  I had a little more than 1.5lb ground beef, but otherwise it was per recipe. BTW - I hate it when people change the recipe and then write a review. I think this is my favorite sloppy joe recipe.  The only thing I will change when I make this again will be to reduce the brown sugar by half.  Otherwise....perfect.

I"ve always used tomato soup but since I love Chef John's recipes, I decided to try it. Only had 3/4 pound of ground beef so I halved everything, using a little less water the second time. Needless to say, goodbye tomato soup!! Loved them!!

This was fantastic. I substituted spicy mustard as I didn't have any Dijon. I do have a couple of questions if anyone, including Chef John, want to answer. 

1. Why start the beef and onion cooking in a cold skillet? 

2. Why add so much water? It does take a long time to reduce to make it thick. 

It's a whole lot more work and time than browning hamburger and mixing a can of store bought sloppy joe sauce but it's worth it. Thanks Chef John.

I made these yesterday and I would use less brown sugar ( a little too sweet for me) and I only used the one (1) cup of water and it thickened up nicely. I was afraid if I added the other cup of water, that it'd be too soupy.

Excellent recipe as is!  Second time, I cut back a bit on the sugar and added some hot sauce near the end of simmering.  Also tasty.  Will be making this often!

Was just okay, I used regular hamburger like 80% lean. Was a little watery maybe because of that. I drained the fat, cooked it,  drained  it, then added water. You more then likely have to stick with real lean hamburger. I think I will stick with my regular Sloppy Joe mix. I probably won't make this again.  Was a bummer because I usually like Chef John's recipes.

This one not so much......

This recipe was everything you expected it to be! The melded flavors , the texture and the balance after that long slow cook was impeccable.  Trust the measurements. 
I highly recommend this recipe if you desire a true unpretentious  Genuine sloppy Joe to please even the most  discriminating palette.
Well done !!

We really enjoyed this! I changed the serving amount to 4 because I only cook with 1 lb of meat  at a time since there are just the 2 of us. That changed the amount of water to add from 1 cup down to 2/3 of a cup, which I remembered the first time, then added a full cup the second time (it doesn't change the amount in the directions, which I knew)! That being said, I think would've taken exactly 45 minutes if I hadn't added the extra water. The part that always makes me wonder is if it should be covered or not so I had mine covered about half the time and stirred about every 10 minutes. I did not add the cayenne per bf's request, and only added 1/2 T of brown sugar because I don't like sweet with my meat. Was perfect!

This is a family favourite!  For personal preference I double the Dijon mustard and use half the sugar.  I also only use one cup of water which greatly speeds up the simmering time- an important consideration when there's three hungry kids demanding to know how much longer until dinner!

I made this for dinner tonight. My family and I loved it up and we are definitely going to make this again. To my taste it was slightly sweet, but a dash more of Worcestershire sauce would fix that right up. We also added a very small amount of barbeque sauce and it made the sauce taste very good. Would like to state that we made a double batch for my larger family and only added one cup of water. We noticed it didn't go away so we only stuck with only one cup. Please note we made it with organic ingredients and on a natural gas stovetop.  We didn't drain the meat because we didn't see it in the instructions. This might be the reason for the extra liquid.

I love, love, love this recipe exactly as written, and have made it many times. But recently I decided to cut back on sugar, so I decided to try it without the ketchup. I used a 15 oz. can of tomato puree instead, and only 1 cup of water. Let me tell you, it's just as good! I also add  a jalapeno pepper for a bit of a kick, personal preference. Great recipe!

This was delicious! The only changes to the recipe I made were, I used a red bell pepper just because that's what I had on hand and after reading the many reviews about this turning out soupy I didn't turn the heat down to low after adding the water I left it at medium low. Just to be safe I only added 1 1/2 cups of water but I ended up adding the remaining 1/2 cup of water towards the end of the simmer time because it was starting to get too dry.   This was definitely a make it again recipe.

Best sloppy joes I have ever had. My family  begs me to make them. Great balance of seasoning. I add more than a pinch of cayenne to give it a little kick. The reviewers stating that it is soupy must not be simmering it long enough. Low and slow, let it simmer and the water evaporate, perfect texture and great mingling of flavors.

Still some steps to work out. Medium heat is different from one stove to another. Not sure what is a good medium setting for my stove. Yes, extra lean was used; but what is extra lean? The store uses a % sign like 63% ,  85% , etc. So, drain the skillet before that 1st cup of water? I started the 40 minute simmer timer at the 1st cup of water as it didn't cook out. Add gradually? How big is the skillet? Maybe I needed a bigger skillet for the 1st cup of water to cook out quicker. Maybe I should have drained the skillet before the 1st cup of water. We'll have sloppy joes again next week & try the recipe again.

Great flavor!  I only had 1lb beef so added a can of black beans, one celery stalk, and some cheddar cheese.  Only put in 1.5 cups water and it was still very soupy after 45 minutes.  I should have drained the grease early on but otherwise we enjoyed the extra juice!  Served open faced and the family loved it!  No leftovers.

It was a touch too sweet, maybe my ketchup was sweet enough, but we don't eat a lot of sugar so it might be okay for some. I added a splash of red wine vinegar at the end to balance out the sweetness-I'm sure apple cider vinegar would work, too. Consistency was right on after simmering for 40 minutes (I.e. not soupy at all).

THIS.WAS.SO.GOOD. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I didn't have a green pepper, so I used diced celery like some of the other reviewers suggested. I also added in some paprika and oregano, and used ground venison instead of beef. Otherwise, I kept everything else the same. It was absolutely delicious. It definitely needs to simmer for at least 30 minutes, to really develop the flavor and make the sauce thicken. After the last sloppy joe recipe I tried turned into an epic fail, I was really hesitant to try another homemade version; but I have tried many of Chef John's recipes and have not been disappointed. So I thought I give his sloppy joe recipe a try, and I'm so very glad I did. They were a huge hit, and my husband ate 3 of them! Lol! Thank you Chef John, I love your recipes!

Chef John never disappoints, another great recipe that goes into my favorites file. I omitted the cayenne as hubby can't have spice, but followed the rest as written. It is delicious and you will be glad you tried this recipe.

As written it was a 2.5.  After a lot of adjustments, it was a 4.5.  I don't think it was worth the time to make it from scratch.  I've always used the canned sauce with added ingredients and get really good results.  After all the adjustments, I ended up adding spicy cocktail sauce and baking it in a garlic bread bowl, topped with sharp cheddar.  My boys ate it 3 days straight.

Excellent!!! Only thing I may say is, give it plenty of time, I let mine simmer for 1 hr and 15 min. But it was perfect, my family absolutely loved this recipe and I might add my husband HATES ketchup.
Must try

This is the best Sloppy Joe recipe I have ever found...I have eliminated all the other recipes in my folder but this ONE!
It makes a  long time to prepare the dish but it worth the wait!
The only change that I make to this recipe is to use red pepper instead of green pepper. I have shared this recipe with at least half a dozen other people and they have enjoyed the results, too!

The best sloppy Joe recipe out their hands down. Have patience and let these cook down until there is no visible liquid and the meat wants to stick together. You will not be disappointed.

we've made many of Chef John's recipes  and my thoughts on the sloppy Joe is perhaps the people that mentioned it was watery mistakenly added 1 pound of ground beef instead of one and a half… You can always adjust right above the recipe where it says adjust to the number of people served
 And the reason that I'm giving this if I without even having made it yet, we plan on making it this week, is because I've never known any of his recipes to have a low rating ??

I did not add the water. I was out of brown sugar so i just used regular white sugar which worked fine but i advise to use maybe 1 tbsp instead of two. I thought it lacked some flavors so i  put more worcestershire sauce (about 1 tsp) and dried italian dressing, the dressing really helps!

I tried the canned version of Sloppy Joes with my family first; which includes a 5 and 2 year old.  They didn't touch it.  Tried this  recipe and they ate all of it!  Anything that is kid approved in my house is 5 stars in my book.

**I didn't add the green pepper or cayenne because of sensitive stomachs.

Wonderful easy recipe!  Made with half ground turkey and  half lean ground beef.  Added a little chipolti spice for my liking.   Only added one cup of water. Next time omitting half of brown sugar, seemed too sweet.  Definitely  a hit.  Great taste!!

This was delicious!  I only used  1-1/2 cups of water in the mix. I chose  cibatta rolls for the bread that I brushed with olive oil.  Placed the sloppy joe mix on one side of the bun and topped it with slices of monterrey jack cheese.  Put it under a broiler on low to melt cheese and toast the other side of the bun.  Very tasty!

I made this recipe as stated except I used red pepper instead of green. I was serving it to young men in suits who were concerned that it would be hard to keep their white shirts from getting stained. I assured them that I was making a less sloppy Joe. They loved them and there was nothing left! This is a delicious recipe and works well to make ahead. All the white shirts remained white! I liked this recipe first for the flavor and second because it stayed well in the bun. Easy to make as well.
Thanks Chef John!

We followed the recipe exactly with the very minor exception of using green bell peppers due to the misperception of many that all red peppers  are hot.  Given we were serving 50+ diners at our seniors' community centre, I didn't want any misperceptions getting in the way of trying this dish.  I was told many times that we can serve it again anytime.  Thanks, Chef John for an excellent adaptation of this old recipe.

This came out great.  Tasted just like the sloppy joe filling that the farm ladies bring to church potlucks.  We all loved it.  I followed the directions without adding anything but I started it 2 1/2 hours before we ate and it was really ready to eat with no soupiness at the 2 hour mark.

The only change I made was adding a little less water because I used honey instead of sugar and had a little extra peppers and onions. It was delicious. If yours turns out soupy you either didn't cook it long enough or simmered it on too low. Turn up the heat just a bit or just simmer longer.

Good stuff! I sub in a 6 oz can of tomato paste for the ketchup and reduce the water by a half cup to reduce the simmer time and use ground turkey. Sometimes I omit the bell pepper because I just don't have it in the fridge. Red onion on occasion too!

It was good, but a little on the sweet side, and it took a long time to cook.  I think I'd prefer a faster recipe.

Great recipe. Eye your water depending  on your stove & time you are going to actually simmer. Sloppy joes are very plain when made out of a can (my opinion ) this I will eat. Easy to adjust flavor. If too sweet for your liking just add a bit more of ingredients other then brown sugar. Great how written though.

This came out really good! I added an extra red bell pepper and omitted the second cup of water.

4 stars because the hubby doesn't like "sweet" so I added extra Worcestershire and Trader Joes 21 seasonings and a little more pepper. Turned out great but personally I'd have enjoyed it the sweet way. If you don't like it sweet, leave out the brown sugar. It took over an hour to cook down all the liquid. After the initial cooking time for all the flavors to meld together nicely, I turned up the heat from 2 to 4 the last 25mins.

Used 90/10 ground beef.  Cooked all day in a crock pot on low.  Mine was soupy.  I will make again but use less sugar and water.  Added a bit of tomato paste and it didn't thicken.  In the end added flour as suggested and it looked fine.

Best sloppy joe recipe!! I'm not a huge fan usually, kind of indifferent to them really...but this recipe is exceptional! I loved them, my 3 and 6 year old loved them and my husband ate 3 and also said they were the best he's had.

Super recipe. I made it as sliders for Super Bowl and everyone loved it. The only change I made was using 1/2 of the water suggested . It was perfect.  I made it very early in the day and let it sit on warm in the crock.  I also used a bit more cayenne pepper to give it a bit of a kick.

I had leftover homemade buns from dinner the other night. I thought sloppy joes would be a great use of the remaining buns. I rated this recipe at 4 because I made changes. First I chopped up the onion and on medium high sauteed in butter until translucent. Then I added the ground beef and browned that with the onions. I didnt have any bell peppers, so I chopped baby carrots a replacement, and added that to the onion and beef. When the beef was mostly brown, I added salt and pepper. I also added about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic,  a quarter cup of brown sugar, a couple of shakes of Worcestershire, a quarter cup of ketchup, and a decent squeeze/dollop of spicy brown mustard. Add a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes. Mix it all together. Add a quarter cup of water and eighth a cup of apple cider vinegar. Stir it all together. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes uncovered.

Very tasty.  I did however make some minor changes.  Replaced green bell pepper with red, used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup chili sauce and omitted the 2nd cup of water.   Will definitely make again.

This is a fabulous recipe!  For people who ended up with a soupy consistency: it's important to use a wide pan with lots of surface area to allow the liquid to evaporate and to allow it to simmer for atleast 30 minutes.  Mine took about 40 minutes to get to the consistency I like.  I think the only change I made is that I added more garlic.  This is very good as written.  My hubby asked it to go on the "make again" list!

We *loved* this recipe!  So easy to make and it came out perfectly!  The one thing I changed slightly in the prep was I combined the water with the ketchup, etc and whisked it before adding to the meat mixture.  I cooked it for about 35 minutes on a high simmer (not a boil) and it came out thick and not soupy at all.  (I'm wondering if the soupy texture people have mentioned is if their ketchup is thinner. Just a thought) The dash of worcestershire really added something special!  I made it with oven roasted potatoes with garlic, rosemary, s+p (and Olive Oil).

Followed this recipe step by step was not impressed maxed out the time to simmer(45min) had to turn heat to medium after 30min and still a little watery did not thicken enough to serve on buns was not impressed with the flavor either recipe calls for lean ground beef I used 80% maybe next time I will try 90% or higher as ground beef produces its own broth don't know if that will make a difference but willing to try

I do not like the sloppy joe mix from a can but my husband does. This was my way of compromising. I absolutely LOVED this recipe! Only thing I did different was a large pinch of cayenne. I like the extra spicy. This is the only sloppy joe recipe I'll ever use! And I love your videos Chef John! You have great recipes and you make me laugh!

My entire family loves this and now wants it once a week lol. The only critique I have is this: first time I made it, I used the amount of water the recipe calls for and followed what others said about simmering for an hour. It was still to soupy for us. 2nd time I made it with half the water and it was perfect. 
We will never eat sloppy Joe's without this recipe now.

Amazing. I cut out one cup of water, used Spicy brown mustard in place of Dijon and added a smidge more brown sugar (1/2tsp maybe). Flavor is amazing. Cheyenne really is a good counter to the sweetness.

My husband loves sloppy joes, and after I made this, he declared that Manwhich shall never enter our home again!  I followed the recipes closely, maybe adding more than the measurements, but still a good recipe.

This is a staple in our household. We have it frequently. It's easy to prepare as directed or to increase the recipe to feed a crowd. Here's my tip -- allow plenty of time so that the sloppy joe mixture can simmer very slowly for a couple of hours rather than cooking it quickly. I use a porcelain-covered, cast iron Dutch oven, which easily accommodates a long, slow simmer. I find that the flavor is much better when cooked long and slow.

Perfect as written. My guys love this dish and even I, who rarely enjoy ground beef in anything, think this is five stars. Chef John's is the only cooking blog I follow. His recipes are fantastic and his instructions easy to follow. Always watch the video and please, don't substitute all the ingredients, change how you prepare a dish and then rate it. At least the first time around, cook it as presented and give the actual recipe a rating (pet peeve of mine when folks alter everything - proportions, ingredients, cooking time and method but then they complain the results were not great.)

Awesome .The only changes I made were red peppers instead of green and I left out the cayenne.You really need to cook it the full 35-40 mins.I've made this several times and it always turns out so yummy.Thank you for another great recipe Chef!!

I followed everything except only add 1 cup of water.  A little too sweet and although the water evaporated, it still wasn't thick like I'm used to.

I was a little skeptical at first with all the water. Some of the reviews said it was like soup. But I just followed the directions exactly. It's was really good!! I don't usually change anything  the first time I make anything. I won't change anything next time either! Really good

My daughter, who is very picky loved these! Both of my girls do not care for tomato sauce or bbq sauce, so this was perfect. I added yellow pepper instead of green, but other then that followed the recipe exactly. I've made it three times, always a hit. I have also made his turkey version both are winners in our house.

I added jalpenos and red bell peppers in addition to the green (which I halved). It added more hot and sweet flavors to it. I also let it reduce way longer than the recipe recommended. If you don't, it ends up too runny. I used a cast iron skillet, which provided better heat distribution.

I've made this recipe (slightly different) for decades.  When the kids were small, husband in law school we ate it a lot. I made up 5# at a time and froze it in smaller containers to use as needed.   
My changes: add garlic, to me a must.  And a little lemon juice.  I also don't add mustard.  I guess it makes it not quite the same recipe, but close enough, and I think both probably are worthy of a 5 star sloppy joe.

Three stars may be a little harsh but I made it exactly as instructed and it was waaaay too sweet. Actually when I saw that the recipe called for ketchup AND brown sugar I decided to add only one Tbsp of sugar. However, that was still too much and I spent the rest of the cooking time adding tomato paste, white wine vinegar and mustard trying to bring the flavour back to what one expects from a Sloppy Joe .
I will add less sweet ingredients next time tho, bc this is a solid recipe (with some tweeks of course)

While these tasted very good, sloppy joes should be a quick meal on a busy night.  Prepare to cook out all the water for 60-90 minutes (at least double what the recipe says).

So much better than Manwhich and easy, too!! I substituted 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce - my favorite is Mesquite - and 1/4cup ketchup. Also added diced green chiles. These are just my preferences. I've made Chef John's awesome recipe as is but have tweaked a little.

Flavor was good but not better than my usual recipe so I won't switch. Used the two cups of water called for, 1 listed in ingredients and second where it says add another cup of water and had to cook for an additional 15 minutes after original 45 minutes plus turn heat up to medium the last 15 and it finally got thick. I would say don't add that additional cup of water.

This is on the sweet side but that didn't stop everyone wanting another sandwich.  Mine took an hour simmering to get to the right consistency.  Could I get the same results from using less water the second time around....maybe.  Will I do that next time....probably not.  It was so good I don't want to mess with it.  Cayenne is a must because of the sweetness.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this exactly as written, except I used a total of 2 pounds of ground meat.  Let me say that the flavor is fabulous.  But, it was too soupy for me as well, and this is after letting it simmer for 3 hours.  Next time I will just add the initial first cup of water -- not the second.

This was VERY GOOD! In my opinion some of the reviewers are right in that it tastes too sweet so I just added a twist of the wrist extra splash of Worcestershire Sauce to the pan because the brown sugar & ketchup were all I could taste when I sampled it, once I added more Worcestershire you could taste all the ingredients rather than only brown sugar & ketchup. I doubt my family would enjoy this without the adjustment. What's great about this recipe is most of the ingredients will be on hand and you can substitute bread for pasta and put this on top of buttered noodles (that's always a good next day leftover recipe to change it up a bit.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time as is and it was very good,except I thought a little too sweet.  The second time I made it with half the brown sugar and it was just right.  You can always count on Chef John's recipes to be good.  This is my favorite sloppy joe recipe I've tried.

In the past, I made sloppy joes with a seasoning packet and a can of tomato paste.  Not great, but fast. After making this recipe, I can't go back!  It was so much better, both in consistency and flavor.  I prepared it just like the recipe stated.  My whole family loved it, even the kids.  And other than chopping a onion, pepper and garlic, and measuring out a few pantry staple items, there was no prep.  Very easy way to make a great weeknight dinner.  It is good enough that I plan t make a batch tomorrow to take to a friend recovering from surgery.  True comfort food! I can picture making this in large quantities ahead of time for a group meal and rehearing or keeping warm in a crock pot.

Who knew sloppy joes could taste this good?   I served mine on a seasame seed bun with a slice of American cheese.  It sure takes a lot longer than dumping a can of the premade stuff over browned meat, but I found it worth the time.

I agree on the water issue.  Way to much.  I did only about a cup and a eighth.  Still drained some with a slotted spoon.  Very good no left overs at three.

Great recipe - hubby loves it!  I doubled the ingredients the second time I made it so there would be plenty of leftovers.  Also, once the ground beef/onion mixture was well-browned, I drained all of the fat off by pouring the beef mixture into a strainer  and letting it sit a while.

I've never changed a thing. my family, that is husband, 6 adult children, 18 grandchildren, and even the young great grandchildren love it. I am so glad I came across this recipe. It is a request whenever we get together.  I'm just starting another batch for a sick daughter-in-law and family. thank you chef john

I made this for a potluck at work, everyone LOVED it! It was pretty simple, the only drawback is the time it takes to cook.

I don't eat Sloppy Joes but my husband said these were the best and I can make them anytime. He said they tasted even better the next day in his lunch. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

I followed the recipe as written, using extra lean ground beef, and I still found these to be too greasy.  The flavor was spot on, though.  Next time I will drain the ground beef before adding the water and the remaining ingredients.

This is a really good, simple base recipe.  I also add about 2 teaspoons of sweet pickle relish!

Love this recipe. We throw a little extra stuff in it (chili powder, cumin, cajun seasoning), but its really good as is!

I'm not to big on sweetness, so I omit the sugar, and replace almost all the ketchup with tomato paste. 

Key to this is LETTING IT SIMMER until thick. Don't add flour!

I tried this recipe for Super Bowl day and we loved it. What a perfect-tasting sloppy joe on an Hawaiian bun! The interesting part was that we wanted stuffed peppers for dinner so I used the left-over sloppy joe mixture and added a jar of regular salsa and brown rice (cooked for 20 min.) while the peppers were par-boiling for 5 minutes. They were cooled in an ice bath and then stuffed and baked for one hour. There was enough sauce to baste them if desired. They were delicious especially with a side of mashed or baked potatoes. Next time I will top them off with cheese. Thank you Chef John for the best sloppy joe.

Good base for a sloppy joe but found it a little bland. We added some Franks Red Hot Sauce to taste and that gave it the zip we thought was missing. Also served it on buttered and toasted buns. Will make this again. thx Chef John

This turned out great.  I followed the recipe but I didn't add things in exactly the same.  I left out the cayenne pepper and added several more dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I added finely chopped green bell pepper and orange bell pepper; they added a nice touch of color.  Following the suggestion of one reviewer I only added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar instead of 2 tablespoons.  I'm glad I did because the sloppy joes were still slightly sweet but not too much.

Very good, so much better than the stuff in a can, although there is a place for it in a pinch.  

Like other reviewers said, be sure to let most of the water evaporate before adding ketchup or it will be runny.

These are really good.  The beef is flavored while it's browning (I put not only the onions but also the green peppers in with the browning beef), and because it simmers for so long, the flavors have a chance to meld.  I really liked that it wasn't so soupy that the buns melted, but you have to let it cook the full time.  Next time, I may make the second addition of water a little less.  Thanks, Chef John . . . I won't be looking for a Sloppy Joe recipe anymore!

Everyone loved this. I grew up on coal region hamburger bbq which is tangy and tastes like ketchup. This is so much better. I used about 1/2 cup less water than called for but the full amt. would have worked. It just needs to simmer for a bit. Will make again.

My family loved these. I used a on orange pepper instead of green and added the water 1/2c at a time until it simmered and absorbed. Nice rich flavors, sauce was very good. Served on whole wheat buns. Thanks!
