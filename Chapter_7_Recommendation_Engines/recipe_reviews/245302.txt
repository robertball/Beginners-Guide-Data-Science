It's not bad.  Definitely has a banana flavor though, and unfortunately I don't care for bananas.  If I were to do it again, I'd probably only use half or a third of one. However, most people don't test something they don't like the ingredients in, so I won't knock it for that!
I did change some proportions - only 1.5 c coconut water because that's the size of my bottle.  About 8 strawberries. No dates, as I have none, I sweetened with a little sugar.
Last, your smoothie will not be green, as I anticipated by the name. The strawberries (and probably dates) will change that.
