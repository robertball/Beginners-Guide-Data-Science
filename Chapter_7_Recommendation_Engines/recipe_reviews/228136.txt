I made this recipe to go along with stuffed manicotti noodles but made a few changes.  Instead of sliced bread I used refrigerated bread stick dough and forgot to add the butter and parmesan cheese on top.  Was flavorful, but a little dry, I had left over cream cheese mixture, so next time I will go heavier.

Similar to a recipe I've made but skipped the parmesan and added one small container of blue cheese.  Great party pleaser.

Easy and very hardy appetizer. I saved time (and grease) by using bacon bits, and by cooking the asparagus and flattening the bread slices the day before. Super easy to do - soften the cream cheese, mix the ingredients and spread on the bread, add asparagus and roll up. Brush with butter, sprinkle with cheese, bake 10 min.
My bread didn't dry out at all, I used about half the amount of butter called for and I forgot the lemon. I also rolled them on the diagonal and cut them in half before serving. Delish!

Sorry, there is just way too much bread in this recipe. Love the flavor of the cheese, chives and bacon.  I might try this recipe next time with the inner ingredients combined in a casserole and sprinkle bread crumbs over the top.

I made these according to the recipe - using whole grain bread, which worked great. I think the addition of some blue cheese to the cream cheese mixture would be awesome.  They are a little fussy to make and if I were making them for a large group I would use my pasta roller to flatten the bread and then probably cut the bread in half.  They were pretty filling and although tasty they are more of a side dish than a appetizer as written.  There is no need to blanch the asparagus. 10 minutes at 400 - 425 perfect and you will have tender but not mushy asparagus.

Way too much bread and does not look appealing to guests. The bread dries out and looks unappetizing. All the other flavors are good but no one could tell what was inside so no one at my party ate them.

I did use crescent rolls for this instead of bread.  I will be making these again.  They would be wonderful for a ladies lunch.  I see the recommendation to add chesster cheese and that would be very good too.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

Delicious. My family does not care for veggies, but they loved this recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  We used crescent rolls that one of the reviews mentioned. It was nice and buttery.
