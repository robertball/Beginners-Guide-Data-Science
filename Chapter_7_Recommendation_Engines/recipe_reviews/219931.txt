This is called "quick enchilada sauce" for a reason.  It's very quick, and though one reviewer didn't like it because it tastes canned, but it sure is quick, compared to making the sauce from dried chiles, and unlike canned, you know what's in it because it's made at home.  
I have made this 3 times now.  My husband loves it, my children love it, and I love that it's quick and easy.
Thank you, Tammy S, for sharing your recipe!

Sorry...this is still like canned sauce.  If you buy the mexican dried chiles (I use Anaheim or California ) soak them in hot water, then put in blender with your spices & beef broth then you have a quick, and DELICIOUS  uncanned sauce.

Today, I made a recipe that called for two cans of enchilada sauce and found I only had one, so I decided to make my own.  More than happy with this recipe, tastes as good as what you buy at the supermarket, and more than likely, I'll never buy another can of enchilada sauce.

This is a good quick sauce to utilize when there isn't time or the ingredients to do something a little more authentic. Will definitely use this sauce again.

Great enchilada sauce. I didn't have the tomato puree on hand so, I had to leave it out and it was still really good. Most enchilada sauces I have tried are pretty thin anyway. I was surprised by people commenting that this sauce was no better then canned sauce. This is a gazillion times better then canned sauce. Thanks, for the recipe.

This is better sauce than you'll find ready made and you'll likely have all the ingredients. There are some more highly rated sauces on allrecipes, but you'll have to make a trip to the store for those.

THis was pretty easy and tasted good. I made it only because I didn't want to drive to the store when I didn't have enough sauce for my dinner. The only change I made was I used california chiles and toasted them and blended it with everything else because I had no chili powder.

The method on this was great and the thickness turned out perfect.  The only change I made was to up the spices...I tripled most of them.  I was able to quickly thow it together and let it simmer while I browned the ground beef.  It helped me get an easy enchilada casserole on the table in about 45 minutes on a weeknight.

Great recipe - made a couple changes after reading reviews - used chicken boullion instead of beef broth, used only tomato sauce and half the water used in broth. Tasted just as good if not better than the canned versions that are so expensive.

Amazingly easy and yummy. We've been so disappointed in local restaurants lately. Maybe I should bring this recipe to them? ;) No need to go out to dinner with this sauce.

For a quick, easy to make replacement for canned sauce, you can't beat this.  I made it as written only adding 1tsp of additional chilli powder.  I also like that I have control over what goes in this sauce.  It will be a staple in my kitchen!  Thanks Tammy

Easy and fast to put this together at the last minute for smothered burritos. I cut this in half so I skipped the tomato paste and used a beef bouillon cube and water instead of beef broth. This is a mild flavored sauce and went well with the taco flavored beef filling. I'd use this again although it isn't my favorite, it is good. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

Good enchilada sauce when you haven't got any on hand. I doubled the spices and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of beef. I also added 1/2 tsp. each of red pepper flakes, ground red cayenne pepper and minced garlic. After blending well, I simmered over a low heat for 20 minutes and cooled in the refrigerator overnight before using in any recipe. I think it gives the sauce's flavors a chance to blend together completely.

This recipe was VERY easy and had a a wonderful taste! Not too spicy so my kids were able to eat and not complain. I followed the recipe exactly. It was the perfect addition to the enchiladas I made. I have never bought this sauce it a can, and never will now that I can make it!! YUM!!

Made this and only had a 16 oz can of tomato paste so used it and added about 2x the spices called for and used it in the Breakstone's enchilada bake recipe on this site (see my reviews to see how/where I use it in that recipe).  My boys raved over it more than normal so obviously the taste of this sauce helped!

I thought this was great.  It was better than a canned sauce, but of course it tastes a little canned because some of the ingredients come from cans.  This is not a problem for me. I omitted the tomato paste because I didn't have it and still thought it was great with our enchiladas.  I will use this again and again.

I thought this was very tasty for quick easy sauce.  I used Rotel tomatoes with green chiles.  I think the green chilis added a more authentic flavour.

I added a little extra chili powder. It came out great. I used Pomi diced tomatoes in a food processor instead of tomato sauce since I didn't have any sauce in the house. It worked great just the same.

This recipe turns out great every time. I use ancho chilli powder instead of regular and let the sauce simmer for about an hour to get rid of the canned taste.

The only think I did different with the sauce was I added 2 finely minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for a smokey flavor and a little heat.  Used on top of homemade burritos.  My family really liked this, will use it again!

I guess I am not well versed in enchilada sauces, but everyone in my family thought this was awesome. I didn't change a thing. My son said I need to make this more often.

I wasn't impressed with this sauce. It was too tomatoey and not very authentic. I'll just go back to the homemade version with the dried chiles that are rehydrated.

I only had one 8 oz can of tomato sauce and I left out the oregano. I will use this again! It was quick and easy. It was nice since I didn't have the sauce on hand, but I had all the ingredients. Yum!

I live in a small town, no enchilada sauce to be found, this was perfect as I had the ingredients on hand. I used chicken stock I had from roasting the chicken for the chicken enchiladas I was making so I used that instead of beef. I omitted the salt as well and I only needed a heaping tablespoon of paste to achieve the consistency I wanted.

Great flavor and not too spicy.  I used this recipe to go with Gerry's Enchiladas from this website.  Two winning recipes, one great taste.

Great taste, only thing I will change is the amount of broth by increasing it to two cups. Making it again tonight.

Quick, easy & made with ingredients I usually have on hand AND it tastes much better than the typical watery canned stuff.  I'm sure you could make a more authentic sauce but this is a great sub for the canned stuff. I use this all the time now in place of canned.  It's a good, basic red sauce.  Very useful recipe.

I didn't have a can of tomato sauce so I used a can of Rotel tomatoes, increased the onion powder and cumin to 1/2 tsp and put it in my blender with 3 cloves of garlic...the Rotel added some nice heat!  Very good and EASY!

This was very tasty.  Made exactly as is, except for the garlic powder.  I didn't have any, so I substituted on clove of garlic.  Thanks for sharing.
