My mother has made this dish for years and it's a family favorite!!  We omit the water around the chops and put the stuffing directly on top - bake covered for 1.25 hours and then uncovered for 15 min.  The stuffing keeps the chops moist and delicious!!  WONDERFUL! Bon appetite!!

We thought this recipe was really delicious!  I changed a bit, based on previous reviews.  I used Ritz that were roasted vegetable flavor for the bread crumbs, used onion powder instead of onion for the picky ones in my family, added a little dried sage for seasoning, and used chicken broth instead of water. One review said 1c of broth, but 1/2 cup would have been plenty.  I also had thin chops so I put the stuffing on top to start with and just cooked all together in oven for 1/2 hour covered and then 10min or so uncovered to crisp up the stuffing a little.  It was really, really good and the smell was fantastic while it cooked as well.  Overall, I find pork pretty bland, sometimes tough, and my least favorite meat, but this was tender, flavorful, and just darn good!:)

This was very tasty and easy to make. I omitted water and stuffed pork chops right after browning then topped with cream of mushroom soup and baked 1 1/2 hr.

Very delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes and gravy (made with the juices of the pork chops and water), and green beans.

Good, except for the cream corn. The sweetness just seemed not to belong in this savory dish. Maybe I'll use whole kernal corn next time. Other than that, it was very tasty and very easy!

WOW!!! This recipie is amazing. I was a bit hessitant to try it because it only has three reviews in two years. I made some minor modifications though. I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, I used thin cut chops (all I had), omited the water part because I did not want to dry them out, and I put one cup of chicken broth and cooked the dressing on top all for thirty minutes. Yummy!!!

Like other reviewers I used chicken broth instead of water and I added some fresh sage to the stuffing. I also thought that the cooking time seemed to be overly long and I hate dry pork so, I browned the pork chops which brought them up to the required temp. (140 on my thermapen ) and just baked them for 30 minutes with the stuffing on top and the chicken stock included at that step. This was a nice dish that I will make again. I just didn't think that it was good enough for a 5 star recipe

Very good. My family liked it.  I will make it again.  I used at least 1/2 cup of onion and celery.I used about 3 1/4 cups of bread crumbs. I also put about 1/4 cup of cream of mushroom soup.

Full of flavor, but too salty.  I'll make this again, but I'll cut the salt in half next time and add some sage.  Other than that, easy to make and delicious!

I followed instructions to the T and this came out amazing. The stuffing had such a great flavor (I used hard bread crumbs) and I baked the chops for about 45 minutes instead of an hour. Mine were also a little more thin cut.

I asked my dad to buy the celery and he didn't. he did boil the pork though. I had no creamed corn so I blended a can of corn instead. made it like that and my dad loved it! I also think it was very good, so thank you, I will definitely keep making it. (with the celery next time)

It was great tasting but very dry.  I used 1/2" pork chops and ended up having to make gravy so we could eat this dish.  I will make it again and adjust my cooking time.

I made this for my boyfriend for dinner  and we absolutely Love this dinner Scott and I agreed this would be something we would eat again; and that we were so full when we were done that we had no room for seconds not even for dessert. We were so full we went right to bed about a half hour after dinner and left the dishes in the sink till this morning  lol.  Thank you . Patricia Barrett

Good but I will not use as much salt that is called for next time.  It was a little too salty for my taste. Otherwise very easy and the family enjoyed it. I used regular kernel corn instead of the creamed corn and it was very good.

Jen, thank you so much for this recipe.  My Mom used to make this, but she passed away before I was smart enough to ask for the recipe.  I've tried, but my dressing was always too dry. Now I can bring back those old memories in such a nice delicious way.  A hint to everyone, ASK for a recipe before it's too late.

I followed this to the letter and it came out great!! I did put the coconut in with the batter then mixed it. Then put a little more on the top. Other than that, this was VERY easy!!! I will definitely make this again!!!!

My husband liked it!!!(He does not like pork).  Chops were very tender.
The boxed stuffing works well too. Making it again today.
