Finally! A REAL Banana Cake recipe!! I needed a recipe that did not call for buttermilk since I do not use it in anything else. I also wanted a recipe that did not have any strange ingrediants, preferably without the need for frosting AND a recipe for a 9X13 pan. I narrowed my search to this and for once my banana cake came out perfect!! This is the real thing better than store bought (the whole purpose!). Easy to prepare and only 30 mins! to bake! Most take an hour. VERY light and full of flavor. The cake is about 1 1/2" high.
I even registered to allrecipes just so I can rate this recipe!
Thanks CAROLINE!

WOW! This cake is delicious! I followed the recipe as is, just tweaked it, instead of using shortening, I used butter (no shortening in stock), added 1 more banana (since I had 4 really riped ones), and added probably 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice. Baked it at 375 for 30 minutes, DELICIOUS!!!! Very moist.

is cake was wonderful!  I added two more bananas, cutting them into large chunks and mixing them in at the end.  Some cinnamon and nutmeg to the mashed bananas is nice too.  It also taste great with a white chocolate or vanilla frosting.

Delicious. But I had to use a square pan and not the 9x13. Using the 9x13 I got a cake that was maybe an inch high. I like them higher.

I decided to make this recipe into muffins instead of cake. I made three small substitutions; I used regular AP flour instead of cake flour (I did sift it with the other dry ingredients and when I googled it, I did what was suggested and subtract three tablespoons for each cup of flour which really brought the flour amount to just under two cups), I used butter instead of shortening and I cut the sugar back to a scant 3/4 cup as my bananas were REALLY ripe. The batter looked as it should for muffins, it baked up nicely and it tasted as banana bread should but these did turn out dry. If I make these again, I'd cut back the flour a quarter cup or so or add an additional banana. 350 for 20 minutes was just right for me. I got 12 large muffins out of one recipe.

This recipe was excellent. Exactly what I was looking for. My banana's weren't even ripe, but it is a perfect flavor. If you are looking for banana cake and not bread, this recipe is for you!

Nope!  I will note make this one again.  I took a second look at all the ingredients and thought there was something missing.  No milk? No buttermilk? Nothing with a liquid consistancy to it? But I trusted the reviews and thought I would give it a chance.  When I added the banana's the dough looked more like cake batter, so I thought I was OK.  My cake looked just like the picture.  I made a glaze for it which my husband had preferred I had not.  My whole family thought the cake was why too dry.  We all took out the gallon of milk and each had a big glass to finish off our piece.  This cake is dry, dry, dry.. Just want to warn everyone before they make it.

I ended up multiplying this recipe x1.5 (changed the servings from 12 to 18) so I wouldn't have a "flat" cake like the other reviews complained about. I had to bake it about 40 minutes at the same temp. It was perfect.  I got a very plump 13x9 cake. Tasted great.  I also used regular all purpose flour and it turned out fine. Perfect for my work potluck.

DELICIOUS!!!  I specifically chose this recipe because it is DAIRY FREE! I am so glad such a wonderful recipe qualifies, as the good ones are hard to come by!   I used 2 cups of all purpose flour in place of the cake flour, and used oil in place of the shortening.  I also mixed by hand, rather than with an electric mixer, as I find leaving the chunks a bit bigger leave more "interest" in the cake.  Cake came out sooo yummy, and beautifully moist!    I will definitely be making again, this may become my staple recipe for all those "dead" bananas we don't eat in time!   Next time I make it, I plan on adding even more bananas than the three called for.  I think it could only add to this wonderful recipe.  :)

I made this cake because of the great reviews that it got and they were all right.  this cake was delicious and easy except I put it in a 9x13 pan and there wasnt enough batter for it to rise properly so next time I will use a smaller pan.  thanks for the recipe

I made this cake as is the first time ... Excellent!  The second time I altered it based on the reviews and used a Bundt cake pan (baked for 35 mins.), butter instead of shortening, and a cup of chocolate chips ... Decadent!  By the way, I didn't have cake flour so I put 2 Tblsp cornstarch in each measuring cup before filling the remaining cup with flour ... 1/2 Tblsp for the 1/4 cup.  What a versatile cake!

I snazzed up the recipe a bit with the addition of 1 cup of  chocolate chips.  The cake was good and moist but the volume of the cake was less than adequate.  I would have preferred a taller cake.

Amazing cake!  I know my family is going to love this!  I used butter instead of shortening.  I also didn't know what 3 banans really meant, as they are all different sizes.  So I decided to take a guess and use 2 cups of mashed bananas.  I will use that much again!  I also toasted some walnuts and sprinkled on top before baking.  It took 35 minutes and I used a slightly smaller glass baking dish to get a higher cake (11x 7) or 2.2 quart.  You won't be disappointed!

Delicious! Especially with a little cool whip on top. I used 1 stick of salted butter for the shortening/salt. Turned out great. I'll make this again when I need to use old bananas. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe except that I had four bananas so I threw the extra one in, too. The cake is extremely dry, and I would think the extra banana would have made it even more moist so I can’t imagine what it would have been like otherwise! I will not make this again.

My first time baking a banana cake and it came out great!!! Tasted great!! I followed the recipe without changing anything but I didn’t have vanilla and baking soda (so I used twice the quantity of baking powder to replace this). Also, I made two cakes and added chocolate chips to the second one. Thank you for this recipe. Yum yum

Love it! Didn’t have shortening so i used 1/2 cup butter. I baked it for 20 minutes and toothpick came up clean in 3 areas. I couldn’t find my flour sifter so I used a fine wire collander. And I didn’t have an electric mixer so I mixed the ingredients by hand with a fork. Otherwise, I had all the ingredients on hand and followed instructions. And I used 4 bananas. Hate to throw one out. Thank you. This is a keeper.

I had a few bananas that I needed to use ASAP before it was time to toss them in the trash, so I did a search for "ripened bananas", came across this recipe and had it in the oven in a snap of the finger.  Didn't add or change anything to the recipe.  Family ate the whole thing up within minutes.  It was delicious.  Definitely something I will bake again.

I made half of this recipe coz i only have 2 small-medium size very ripe bananas. And i used an 8-in round pan. It was fluffy but a bit dry. I'm thinking of putting a frosting next time. I definitely want to make it again...

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe  to get a bigger cake in my 9x13 pan.  The banana flavor was limited even though I tossed in an extra banana.  The texture was heavy and a bit dry.  The cream cheese icing I made was the best part so I won't be making this cake again.  Still searching for a great banana cake recipe.

A very simple cake, with a great result.  I am a professional baker, so of course I had to put my signature on this one.  I used butter instead of shortening , baked two 9 inch layers, finished the cake with a fig filling and a buttercream frosting whipped up light and fluffy.

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I was making a two tone cupcake: banana in the middle and chocolate around the outside.  The batter was too thick, so I thinned it with water.  The cupcakes tasted great.  The second time I made it as directed, no extra water.  It was dry but it still tasted good.  I think it is really good if you add more water.

VERY GOOD!  Made it for my husband's birthday and frosted it with cool whip and sliced strawberries and bananas.

I liked this recipe although it wasn't as sweet as others might have liked so i would suggest adding more sugar or some maple syrup maybe even a sweet icing/frosting. My family loved it! Even though it wasn't sweet, it tasted very fresh and the bannana flavor came right thru. Very good even as a brunch or coffee pastry.

Delicious! After reading other reviews,I increased the size (18 servings instead of 12) and it made a nice big 9x13 cake.I also decreased the amt of sugar a bit, and increased the bananas so it wouldn't be dry. Substituted unsalted butter for the shortening and added toasted pecans. I made a cream cheese frosting, but the cake was so moist and tasty that it would have been great without any frosting. I will definitely make this my go-to banana cake recipe.

Followed the recipe as above, but my bananas were small so I used 4.
Perfect!
I cooked it in a Bundt pan and it was moist and delicious.
No need for frosting, icing or spreading with butter.
I recommend it to anyone.
Next time, I will make into muffins.

Was easy, but I agree with others it could use another banana. I will bake again but will use Canola Oil instead of shorteing.it was slightly dry.

It was definitely an easy recipe and i made it because i happened to have all the ingredients. I was a little dissapointed though. It was kinda dry. My girlfriend who took a baking course said the temp should have been 350 not 375. I may also put an extra banana in too. I made a homemade butter cream frosting for it which it definitely needed. I will probably look for another recipe. There are so many on this website.

Made this recipe into about 18 cupcakes. A little dry, so next time I might put in a drop of water.

I tried this recipe and it was just okay.  It did take 30 minutes to bake it and it was easy to put together.  It was a little too dry for my taste.  I also used a smaller pan so that it wouldn't be so flat.  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting and cut it into squares.
I served it at work and no one complained.  So it passed the test.

This was almost a 5 star, but was not quite as moist as we like. I did frost it and it was very good. It worked out well as most of the other recipes called for buttermilk and we didn't have any in the house.

I'm sorry but I have to disagree with the others.  While it's not bad, it's definitely not the best I've had.  It had little banana flavor but it did have a bitter flavor.  After looking at other banana cake recipes, I noticed this recipe, on average, called for two to three times more baking powder than the others.  I'll stick to my Fanny Farmer recipe which is the best I've tried so far.

This recipe was very easy to make and turned out delicious. The cooking time was a little to long for my oven and I ended up getting it a little too brown. Otherwise, it was yummy and a great way to use those not to fresh bananas.
