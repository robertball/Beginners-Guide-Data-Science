I sing praises here. I used applewood instead of hickory. And I used an LP water smoker instead of charcoal. Much easier and quicker (5 hours instead of 10 for a 12 lb free-range turkey). I knew I had a winner on my hands with the YELPS of joy from people who tasted the first slices of the bird. INTENSE smoky flavor (the applewood was a good choice). And the Pepsi-Cola and butter and apple and onion and garlic inside hit the spot giving it incredible sweetness. I brined this turkey first using a brine recipe I got on this site (with salt and brown sugar and rosemary (which I added)). This was one of the best turkeys I've ever prepared. The skin was very dark with smoke, with when you pricked it, it snapped. Inside the turkey was surprisingly moist. A definite hit. Almost sinister and alien it was so intensely flavored.

Excellent recipe. This really does blow your guests away. I have made this several times and I have a few tips. Fyi- I use a electric brinkmann smoker.

Don't use a brine if your turkey is injected with a soulution (butterball). 10 to 14 lbs is best. It will definitely take a mininum 10 hours (at 220-230 degrees). 1 can of cola or a 16oz bottle is plenty. I like a hickory/pecan wood mix (pecan is smoother). Don't smoke after the bird reaches 140degrees. degrees.I only baste every 3-4 hours when I check the wood.I also like to rub the bird with rosemary.
Enjoy..It's the best turkey you will ever have!

This is the best smoked turkey I have ever fixed. I used an electric smoker and it took about 10 hours for a 14 lb. turker. I also used the brine with the kosher salt and brown sugar.  Thank you for bringing this recipe to everyone!

This was my first attempt at smoking a turkey.  We had relatives over for Christmas dinner so I smoked this turkey recipe (13 pound bird) and baby back ribs at the same time.  Wow!  What a great combination.  I have had my share of smoked turkey prior to this one but have decided there is no need to go looking for a better recipe.  This was the best smoked turkey I have ever had and it had rave reviews from out dinner guests.  My daughter-in-law said the turkey defines the word "succulent".  She said, "you just want to sit there and suck all the juices out".

We smoked a 28lb turkey for the company Thanksgiving party using this recipe last year. There were 5 other traditional turkeys at this party but ours was the only one completely gobbled up. One minor adjustment we made to the recipe was to add 1C apple cider to the brine recipe (out of this world brine) we found on this site. To complete the brining process we stuffed the turkey into a roasting bag  (it was a tight squeeze)poured the brine into the bag and set the turkey in a roasting pan rotating the turkey every hour or so overnight. We chose to use applewood and cherry chips in our grill (we didn't have a smoker).  Don't forget to smoke the turkey in a roasting pan and keep injecting the drippings back into the turkey.Yum.

Thanksgiving 2019 
If you want an out of this world  simple and easy greens recipe cook the greens in 2 cups of chicken broth. The last 2 hours or so add "all" the drippings plus the apple/onion/garlic stuffing from your smoked turkey. Throw in a smoked wing or leg for extra flavor.  The mixture has a great smoked not sweet flavor.

This was awesome! I used a brining recipe from here. Let the turkey set in the brine over night. Followed this recipe as well as injecting the bird with a marinade and then covering the top with Tony's Cajun seasoning. I slow cooked a 10lb bird for 10 hours. I kept the heat at around 220 most of the time. Hickory used to smoke.  It was most excellent. Best turkey I ever ate. My family demolished it. Thanks!

WORTH THE TIME! Plan on a day relaxing in your favorite lawn chair getting up once every hour only to throw on some more woodchips and getting another beer. Although this recipe takes 10+ hours its a sinch and worth every moment. The only alteration I made is soaking the turkey in salt water a couple of hours before smoking (1 1/2 to 2 cups Kosher salt desolved in enough water to cover the turkey).

Excellent recipe. Turkey was a big hit with guests on Thanksgiving.  The turkey did take about 11 hours on our electric smoker - we had a 14 pounder.  Thanks!

Do it! I was a bit skeptical when I read the ingredients - like the cola, but thought to give it a try. I had a 17 lb turkey and followed the brine and rub recipe from the Neeley's on foodtv. I soaked mine for 14 hours, then followed the recipe here. Make sure you have a big enough roasting pan - defiantly use it since it kept all the moisture in. I say big enough because the juices started to overflow and I had to suck some out w/the baster. I use to smoke chicken and turkey w/o a pan - but never again after this. I used hickory and apple wood for my smoke and kept the smoker temp around 225 - 250. I basted about every hour and it took about 10 hours to reach an internal temp of 165 on the deep part of the thighs. This was sort of a high maintenance prep and cook but well worth the effort. The bird turned out fantastic, my in-laws loved it and the left overs were even better. DO IT!

Followed recipe except that I brined bird overnight in 1 quart apple juice,  1 cup salt, 4 cloves crushed garlic and 1.5 gallons water. I use a 5 gallon bucket and put the bird in a food grade garbage bag with the brine mixture and pack the top with ice.  The 14 lb turkey was done in 6 3/4 hours.  Brining seems to speed up the cook time.  Cooking temp was between 225-250F.  Flavor was very nice. Got rave reviews from the family.  Served it on toasted french rolls with melted swiss cheese and bbq sauce. Not too smokey. I used apple wood which is my favorite for smoking poultry. Bird was super moist. I ran the smoke for about 4 hrs of the total cook time in my vertical gas smoker.  Not a ton of meat on a 14 lb bird.  Not sure if I will do this again.  I am kind of a traditionalist when it comes to turkey.   I think I prefer to smoke chicken pieces, thighs in particular. 
This was probably more work than I like for the amount of meat that it produced.  I still would rate this a 5 star recipe.

I just got a new smoker so this was my first try at smoking meat. I'm thrilled I used this recipe because everyone said it was the best turkey they had ever eaten. I did make a few small changes and they were to use a 16 oz. cola instead of the two 12 oz. For the seasoning salt I used a basic barbecue rub that I use on beer can chicken. I used the four crushed garlic cloves on the outside and then put them in the cavity instead of the garlic powder. I smoked two 14 pound turkeys and a 10 pound turkey plus I used the same recipe cut in half on two chickens that I added to the smoker with about 6 hours left in the smoking time. Everything turned out super except I would have to say the turkeys were better than the chickens.
I'm adding to this review now a year later. I smoked the turkeys to an internal temperature of 165 degrees which turn out better than 180 degrees and a temperature recommended by a lot of different sites.

Great recipe! I bought the smallest Traeger smoker 2 months ago so I experimented tonite with this recipe.  I had a horrible experience 3 yrs ago w/ a $30 fresh turkey, brine and roast recipe, so I wanted to give my Traeger a try w/ a $5 Safeway turkey (13 lbs).  HOMERUN, awesome turkey...for $5.  The $2.50 foil pan I bought fit perfectly.

I followed 95% of recipe; thawed the tukey in the fridge, rinsed, & patted dry...rubbed w/ olive oil, minced garlic & poultry seasoning on the outside. I placed the turkey in the pan & added 2 T of butter, the onion, apple, minced garlic, and about 4 c of diet coke in the cavity.  I loosely sealed the edges of pan w/ heavy foil.  I turned on smoke for 5 minutes with the lid open to get it started, & then closed the lid & heated on high for 10 minutes.  The temp at that time was about 300 degrees.
I placed the pan on the grill & closed the lid...and kept the smoker on high for 15 minutes.  I then turned to medium and continued to go outside to admire the great aroma..  The temp remained around 225 when on medium.  Short on time, I alternated between high and medium heat (the temp alternated between 225-300 degrees). At 2 hrs, I basted the turkey w/ butter...it was browning beautifully.  I recovered & continued cooking for a total of 4 hrs; unbelieveably moist, fall off the bone, turkey.  Can't wait to try again...I will cook on low next time for duration, and skip the basting...  Truly the most moist(est) turkey I have every prepared!

Some guests totally enjoyed this, but definately preferred the fried turkey we make. The fried turkey was favored for both flavor and moistness. It's always fun to try new things in our smoker though.

This recipe makes a delicious, very moist turkey!
I always smoked my turkeys right on the rack of the smoker......but not any more! Placing it in a roasting pan or pot really keeps the moisture in.
Thanks Doug!

I did not baste the turkey as once I close the lid on the smoker I don't take it off until the calculated time of 45 minutes per pound has elapsed. I was skeptical about loosely covering the turkey with aluminum foil but did it anyway. My turkey came out perfect. I had rave reviews and will be using this exact recipe for every turkey I smoke. This mixture of ingredients creates a slightly sweet and incredibly moist turkey. In fact, it's down right addicting.

I made this recipe for 2013 thanksgiving.  I used a Traeger electric smoker.  It was a delicious turkey like the other reviews say. The best I've had. Here are some data points after making this recipe: @ 230 degrees the 15 lb bird took only 5.5 hours to reach an eternal temp of  165!!! (That surprised  me after reading how many people left their bird on for 10 hrs) ; you only need 1 can of soda (more won't fit) ; brine the turkey before smoking it. It's the only way to get the  moistest and seasoned flavor throughout the thick bird.  To conclude I will only ever smoke my turkeys in the future.

I had just smoked my first ever turkey before I tried this recipe. My first was a whole bird with an oil, wine and spice marinade. It was disappointing. I nearly gave in to the brining craze before I found this page. All I can say it why the heck would I go to the trouble and mess of brining? In the first place, just try to find an unenhanced bird in a rural area. Secondly, this recipe rocks! I used a Butterball bone-in breast, 6 pounds and change, and reduced the butter, coke and salt to allow for the smaller size. I smoked this Tom breast down in a Weber kettle on indirect heat with a water pan and some apple and hickory chunks. Rather than low and slow, I opted for 300-325*. Internal was only 145* at 3 hours, so I pulled the water pan and let 'er rip to almost 400*. In about an hour I hit my target temp and pulled it. It could not have been more moist and flavorful if I had smoked at 225*. One of the top three turkeys I've ever had. The meat was so tender, I had to be careful not to tear it apart while slicing...and I used a very sharp knife. I don't know what the magic in this recipe is, but you should try it. Forget the brine and smoke it however you want, low and slow, or high and fast. I don't think you could hurt it. Just use the thermometer, especially with the cavity crammed with goodies. Bring it to 165*, rest it, and enjoy. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a terrific turkey recipe.  I'm not crazy for turkey, but I will cook it more often now.  When my Dad says "this is the best dame turkey I've had", you know it has to be good because he doesn't compliment much.
Thanks!

We made this last week to start off the grilling season.  This was great, I never realized turkey can be this juicy and flavorful!  I didn't change a thing other than using garlic cloves for the cavity instead of the garlic powder.  Really great and so easy!

Delicious! My turkey did fit our BBQ grill, and I cooked it for our Canadian Thanksgiving. The platter circulated at least twice. I plan to roast a chicken using the same recipe.
Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I was skeptical at first and preparing Thanksgiving dinner for my in-laws made me very cautious. Not to worry this is a GREAT recipe. The flavor, the ease, the aroma in my neighborhood. I made 2 birds. This one and a classic roasted one. Needless to say there was a lot of the roasted one left over.

the BEST turkey ever!  We converted people  who never eat turkey at all into smoked turkey lovers!  We smoked it on a traditional wood smoker cabinet, and brined it the night before in Alton Brown's brine recipe.  The Best!!

I put the turkey in a big roasting pan and put it on the grill with charcoal and apple chips.  I put the top ont he grill and left it for a few hours.  IT WAS THE BEST TURKEY I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  I made three of these  THREE in less than two months. Then I tried it with cornish hens!  I came back on here just to leave the review ( and to look up the recipe again).  I was a little leary about the coke but it worked.

I am not real big on smoked meat, and turkey is not my favorite, but, I have to say, the recipe for this smoked turkey was absolutely DELICIOUS!  We have a huge grill/smoker combo and cooking time was only about 5 hours.  The turkey was tender, moist and flavorful.  We really enjoyed the results of this recipe and can't wait to use it again for friends and family!!

Incredible! I also brined the turkey before smoking it, and it took about 8 hours for a 14 pound turkey. It was moist and delicious. Everyone raved. Used apple wood. I'll do this again for sure. Even better than deep fried.

I cooked this for a Thanksgiving family get together and this was my first attempt at smoking a turkey and it turned out Fantastic! My husband even said that it was the best he had ever eaten including his Mom's!  What a compliment!! I brined my 14.5 pound turkey for 18 hours in salt water and brown sugar, and then follwed the rest of the directions exactly. Because I brined mine though, apparently, it cooked really fast on 225 degrees. My turkey was ready in 7 hours. It had one of the pop up thermometers in it and it had popped but b/c this was my first attemp I was a little hesitant on taking it out of the smoker that soon since I had estimated 11 hours for it to cook per this recipe. But I'm glad I did take it out b/c it was Perfect and moist. Thanks for the great recipe! I'm making this again for Christmas!!

Exceptional. I smoked a 21 pound turkey for 16.5 hours at 185 degrees. Used hickory chuncks. Soaked them for 48 hours before use. Brined the turkey as well. 

The taste was incredible. I will use this next year too.

Smoked a 141/2 pound turkey in an electric smoker for 6 hours yesterday.  Perfection, Oh so tasty.  The family is still talking about the delicious flavor.  Didn't change a thing.  Thank you Doug.

This is without a doubt the best smoked turkey I've ever had. The things I did different was to cook the turkey in indirect heat at 325-350 degrees using hickory chunks. My turkey was 18 lbs. and took just over 6 hrs. The different flavors you tast are unbelievable.
Thank You

We usually fry our turkey, because we were expecting health-conscious guests, I decided to smoke it.  We used our propane grill and used the indirect heat method with hickory chunks.  The night before, I brined the 14 lb. turkey.  It was on the grill at 11:00 a.m. and reached 160 degrees by 2:15 p.m.  It turned out so moist, there wasn't much left!  It seems intimidating, but you gotta try it!  You might want to smoke a turkey breast first.

First time I've ever smoked a turkey and it came out beautifully!  I smoked it one day, put it in the fridge after cooling it down and warmed it up in the oven the next day for our meal. It was the JUCIEST turkey I've ever eaten.  Some guests were so impressed they went out and bought their own smoker the next day!

If you do this once you will do it again. It's Turkey at it's very best. Haven't fed this to anyone who didn't rave. So juicy cranbery sause is not missed Only con I found is if you frezz any left overs (and i'll bet there wont be much) the smoked flavor excesivly dominates. Funny only frezzing does this.

All the reviews on this is true.  I cooked this for my family and friends.  Everyone loved it.  I used Jack Daniels smoker chips. I used a 17lb turkey which was pushing it since the liquid almost over flowed.

My husband and I used this recipe to smoke a turkey for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  At first, I was leary about all the different flavors but it was the best turkey I/we have ever eaten.  When Christmas came along we had several requests to smoke a turkey for my grandmother's dinner.  Of, course we did and our turkey was all gone.  The poor oven baked turkey was almost still all in the pan.

This was a hit for our Thanksgiving.  People that usally don't even like turkey made comments out how delicious it was and took seconds.  We will be using this recipe again REAL soon.

I made this recipe as presented using the brine recipe here as well.  You cannot miss with this combo. Easily the best turkey I've had.  Watch your temps carefully, don't overcook.  160 165 should yield nice moist breast.  It truly is wonderful....*****

I just made it this year. First time I made turkey.  It turned out very good!  We had two turkey's. I got lot's of compliments from the other turkey maker. He couldn't keep his hands off of it and kept picking at it before it was served. The ingredient make a very good "sauce" which I drizzled over the top of it after I had cut it up, just keep it moist.  

One thing to be sure of is to definitely baste every 1 hour or so. Also, I used a brown sugar, kosher salt, vegetable stock brine, and brined it overnight. And doing this seemed to actually help the turkey cook much more easily and very quickly. Which turned out perfect as my smoker was having a problem getting higher than 200° as it was very cold outside.  Started smoking it at around 6:15 a.m., it was done around 1:30 - 2:00 p.m.

This is very close to the recipe I use except I don't use cola and I DO use Penzey's spices (Bicentennial rub, toasted onion powder and Pork chop seasoning.)  I do put cut up apples, onions and lots of garlic in the cavity.

I've smoked turkeys every year for the holidays and always get nice juicy birds and rave reviews.  I do not baste it as opening the door lets all the heat out.  

Several hours into it, I put a ham on the rack above so the ham juices drip down over the turkey; really good! Just make sure the water pan does not run out; that will dry out the turkey.

When it's done, I take the pan drippings and reduce them, add that to my gravy stock and then a roux and get a nice smoky gravy.  I'm drooling just thinking of it.  And the clean-up is SO nice and easy.

Wow!  This was excellent, so nice and smokey, but incredibly flavorful and moist!  Here goes with my only change, though.  We like turkey smokey, but not tooooo smokey, so we smoked it for 4 hours and put it in the oven at 300 to finish the cooking process until the thermometer reached 160.

13.5 pound turkey 8 hours on gas smoker. it was fabulous......made it  for the 4th.  took a long unsliced loaf of bread.,  cut it lengthwise......toasted it...( with garlic butter painted on)in oven., added turkey slices  taken off the bones....plus some really  nice swiss cheese.....back to oven. sliced it into sandwiches..........and made a horseradish sauce, plus a balsamic vinegar bbq sauce to dress...........it was a huge hit! since it was the 4th,.  needed something "picnic" style. not thanksgiving style.

My husband and I tried this before we served it on Thanksgiving just to give the smoker a trial run.  It turned out very good.  We left it on the smoker a little longer than we should have so it was a little dry but not too bad.  It is very flavorful and very easy to prep.

We started using this recipe over three years ago.  The first time we did it the whole neighborhood smelled like a BBQ restaurant!  This recipe not only smells great it tastes great too.  We have tried different variations, but the original is the best!

My first ever turkey, and it turned out great!  Juicy, smokey, flavorful.  For a 10 lb bird, I left the LP smoker on 225-250F for 4.5 hours.  When it seemed to level off at 147F for about an hour, I bumped it up to 350 for the last 45-60 mins.  I followed the recipe except that I started by brining the bird and did not worry about basting except once.  Also, I used applewood chips with just a few small chunks of hickory.  Highly recommended!!  The only thing I would change is not tossing in the second batch of wood chips since the smokey flavor may have been just a bit strong for some people (though not me!).  We'll see how the smoked turkey sandwiches turn out from leftovers...

I tried this before I saved it and I can't believe how easy it was. Not to mention how good it was . I smoked it for about 11hr. 40min. but it was 22 degrees outside and I was using only the thermometer on the smoker. Awesome fixed this way...

I have to agree that this is the best turkey that I have ever fixed.  I went with the applewood. Worth the time and effort. This will be our Thanksgiving Day turkey for next year.

Outstanding!  This was my very first year to ever cook a turkey at Thanksgiving.  I used the "out of this world turkey brine" recipe on this same website then followed this recipe exactly.  That turkey was so good my entire family insists I cook it in all future years exactly the same way!!!  Perfect smokiness...not too much.......which is great.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit.  I used the brine recipe for smoked turkey.  This was the best turkey I've ever had.  The leftovers are great as well.  I had a pretty big bird so it took longer then 10 hours.

I have been using this recipe for six years.  I have substituted Guiness Stout for 'cola-flavored carbonated beverage' -- one bottle for the turkey, one bottle for me.

This was delicious, better than a deep fried.  The skin is perfect, the meat is moist and the flavor is consistent throughout.

The best turkey I've ever had too. I used a Bradley electric smoker with mostly hickory wood and no brine. I don't know why or how, there's nothing really complicated about the recipe but all I can say is that the taste magically goes all the way into the turkey meat. It's not at all bland inside. I think that is the main difference that sets this recipe apart from others. I can't wait for Christmas again. I'm doing one for the Fouth of July....Yee Haw.

I've smoked many turkeys, but never used so many spices or garlic rub.  This was a great tasting turkey.  I've already told many others to give it a try.  Easy and tasty!!

Wow! I wish I had this recipe years ago. It is delicious. I don't generally don't care for white meat but this white meat was flaverful. The onion and apple seeped through the cavity and gave them added pizazz. I have an LP smoker and 10 hours was way too long for my 13 pounder. Between 5 and 6 hours was fine.

11/29/19 update.  Smoked 20# bird for 2 hours  at 180, then turned up heat to 250 and put in pan.  Breast was 84.  Reached 160 in 5 more hours (total of 7).  Put brakes on the heat, let it coast for 3.5 hours more.  Breast was very dry.  Not sure why it cooked so fast...OAT was 40

Used Out of the World Turkey Brine for a day and a half.  Smoked a 14# fresh bird in a Trager Pellet grill at 250 for 10 hours.  Started basting after 2 hours and continued basting every hour until done.

Great smokey taste, juicy and flavorful.  Used Applewood for smoking.

This is a great recipe. We've made it twice now (1 practice run & 1 on Thanksgiving for our family) both turned out wonderful! We used apple wood chips for the smoke. Skin gets blackened, but it is from the smoke & gets tossed anyways. Delicious & a keeper :)

This is the most amazing smoked turkey we have ever had!!! I followed the recipe exactly. Took another reviewers idea and reduced the sauce. OMG! If possible, this made it even better. This will now be a staple on our Thanksgiving table!

I used the worlds best turkey brine for about 24 hours. Followed recipe exactly only difference was I didnt cook to 180 pulled mine at 165.  Was a 14 pound bird and it only took me six and half hours on my traeger at the 250 temp setting very good did two birds not much left.

This was trial run for Thanksgiving.   We alway fry a turkey  but this Thanksgiving we need 2 turks.  The turkey was great.  The execution was flawed.   My turkey was still slightly frozen so I had toooooo much liquid.  The top half smoked and the bottom half soaked.  It was still very good.   Next time I will make sure my turkey is completely thawed. My turkey was 12 lbs and it needed to cook longer than 10 hours.  The soaked was fully cooked the smoked part was not.  HINT:  I soak my Hickory in water and wrapped in foil with holes.   I never had to add chips.   thanks so much for the recipe.

This was our Thanksgiving dinner and it rates a 10!  Moist, juicy and flavorful.  Our 11 lb. bird did not take 10 hours to smoke, more like 8 hours.  We will be using this recipe throughout the year - thanks for sharing!

Excellent! We made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was incredible. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the 2 cans of coke. I used approximately 1/2 can. The drippings helped to make the best gravy I have ever made. Can't wait to make it again!

This was an excellent recipe for smoked turkey.  The flavors blended together nicely.  We smoked it with a apple juice/water mixture.  We used a granny smith apple in the cavity with the other ingredients.  Very little leftovers.

Best Turkey ever! Followed directions except I used apple wood chips. Very moist. I have done this twice in the past month the second time i did it i used a turkey with a pop up timer and it was done in 5 hours @ just under 250 temp, it was a 15 pound turkey cooked on a lp smoker. You will be amazed!

I followed this exactly as written on my Taeger Smoker using Mesquie and used a 10 lb free range chicken. Very Very good, I have smoked many birds and this was one of the best. The spices were just right and the gravy from the drippings was awsome. Usually the garvy is quite smokey, but this was very nice due to the loose foil the dripping piced up less smoke. I will do this again with a turkey at xmas.

I made this last night for Christmas Eve.  The only changes I made were to use apple wood chips and minced garlic instead of powder for the cavity.  My husband never gives 5 stars, but he and the son-in-laws gave it 5 stars.  This is definitely a keeper.

Got up early to get this started in my new homebrew smoker.  Due to an instrumentation error the 14lb bird was done in 4 hrs (10 am).  Popped it in the fridge then reheated in the readjusted smoker. Result, amazingly a wonderful tasting moist turkey! Pretty hard to screw up this recipe!

It'd be a sin to use this recipe and not provide feedback; it was fabulous!! I reviewed a dozen recipes online and choose this one - and family/frineds are glad I did - it was full of flavor, tender, moist, & succulent. I did modify a couple things (gotta experiment), as I used a Brinkmann smoker with a water pan (1 coke to the cavity, 1 coke to the water pan, used apple wood chunks on charcoal, apple cider vinegar in water pan, various seasonings, and basted every 2 hours over 10 hours (15lb bird)). Good luck with yours ...

I loved it and got great reviews by those who ate it this turkey day.  Sadly not all the family love smoked meats as much as I do.  Most turkeys don't have much in the way of flavor, but this bird did have plenty.  It was moist, and lovely.

The best Thanksgiving turkey! We brined the turkey for 24 hrs (Alton Brown brine). We bought a 12 lb free range turkey and it took only 5 hrs to smoke and fall off the bone!!

I find that when smoking a turkey the meat is stringy, so I roast it first so the bones are not bloody, and still do the brining before but cooking time is less, and do not have the stringyness.

I had never smoked a turkey before but my wife asked me to give it a go for Thanksgiving this year to free up oven space.  We did a test run in October and invited friends who also had new things that they wanted to try out for Thanksgiving.  The bird was delicious and I now know why it has received such a favorable rating.  Leftovers lasted for four days and I had a smoked turkey sandwich on each of those days...thought I died and went to heaven.  And, as an extra blessing, I realized that although our little electric smoker did a good job in October, it was going at full power and could not get over 230 degrees.  Since I was concerned about colder weather in November...and because the wife wanted the free oven space...bingo!  A new propane smoker for Thanksgiving!  Heh.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

This recipe is awesome. I was a little nervous about the soda. But I took the plunge and did it anyway. The turkey was so flavorful and juicy. Im sold. We will never have dry plain turkey again. I smoked mine in my weber grill with hickory wood chunks soaked over night. I also used charcoal chunks/lumps which burned so much better and longer. It cooked in about 3 hours. 13lbs bird.

This was a wonderful tasting smoked turkey.. I used a 12# turkey, soaked it in a brine solution of 1 1/2 cups salted water using kosher salt, added some herbs also to the solution soaking it for 6 hrs completely covered with iced water... I did everything the recipe called for but the next time I make this turkey I will only put one can of cola inside this size turkey... there was to much liquid in my pan and I had to remove some of it while the turkey smoked... also it took my 12 pounder 11 hrs in my electric smoker to cook.. it was very moist and flavorful... everyone said it was the best smoked turkey they ever ate

Best Turkey ever. I brined the turkey overnight, and used the brine for basting up until about halfway through (didn't want the meat to be too salty). Then I switched to beer, continuing to baste every hour. I used a turkey stand, so the bird would cook upright.  I smoked for about 8 hours usingn applewood, then for the last 2 hours, I put the turkey breast side down in a pan.
I cooked it until it was 165 degrees in the breast, then let it rest for 15 minutes.
My only regret was that I did not tie the wings to the body, and the smoke passing over the wings made that mead slightly overdone.  But still better than roasting.  
I was surprised that the skin was brown and crispy - my 13 year old raved about the white meat and we all went back for seconds.

I have a Brinkman smoker with a fire box. My bird was absolutely perfect! I did not change any thing. I have learned not to read comments that are more than a few lines. This usually indicates a whole new recipe.

Very proud of myself....1st time smoking anything and used this recipe. Only change I made was to use a 6lb Turkey Breast instead of a whole Turkey and I did Brine the bird....Since this was my first time I did slightly over cook it but it was still really really good. The pink part of the breast that was closest to the skin was absolutely delicious! Cooked 7 hours and 1 side of the breast was at 175 degrees and when I checked the other side it was just over 180.....About an hour less would have been the sweet spot. Thank you for putting this recipe on here!

My husband and I used this recipe for our first-ever attempt at a turkey, for Christmas dinner. It turned out very moist, and my husband said he thought it was better than any turkey his mom had ever made! My parents raised their eyebrows when I poured in the cola, but it turned out perfect. However, we added a lot of sage, like a sausage-seasoning rub. We also cooked it over indirect heat (about 300-350 degrees), covered loosely with foil, on our gas grill, and it took about 4 hours. Wonderful!

Ok i'm a novice. I tried my own smoked turkey this Thanksgiving for the first time and have vowed never to bake or fry a turkey ever again! This is by far the best way to have turkey. My family loved it. I let the 12 lb turkey sit in brine 8-10 hrs in the refrigerator overnight. Then in the morning, I set up my charbroil grill/smoker for low indirect heat. Then I rinsed the turkey and added garlic, pepper, and cajun seasoning, also butter under the breast. I used soaked hickory chips and a can of chicken broth as my liquid under the turkey. I let it cook until the charcoal and chips burned out completely-my first time, I didn't know I could add more charcoal and wood chips as needed. I wanted to make sure it was done, so I put it in the oven for about an hour covered with foil. OMG! Best turkey I ever had! Best flavor! I also smoked a whole turkey breast for christmas. Not a dry spot on either turkey. Very moist and juicy. The one reviewer who was concerned about the pinkish color might want to try a meat thermometer. Or simply bake covered for a hour. Some smokers and charcoals burn differently so it may take more or less time depending on size of turkey, type of charcoal and wood chips. But it's well worth a try. You will not be disappointed by the flavor!

Would give this higher marks if I could.  Made this last Thanksgiving for the family and all agreed it was the best turkey any of us had ever eaten.  I have a lot of good cooks in the family, so it had to be good or I would have heard about it.  Even the vegetarian in the family tried it and raved.  I will now be in charge of Thanksgiving dinner until I die.

I cooked my turkey(about 14lbs)and a pork butt on my big grill/ smoker. It has a firebox that I can slide from one end to the other. So it was indirect heat. I ALWAYS use Blackjack oak sometimes adding a log of pecan to it. I kept the temp between 300 and 325 and basted it per the directions.. For the last 30 min I uncovered the bird and put the pork butt over it letting the turkey catch the drippings from it. It took exactly 7 hrs. My wife being skeptical of some of the new things I try...said the turkey had the juiciest breasts she ever tasted in her life. She and our grown kids said it was the best and moistest turkey that I've ever cooked. For those that fry turkeys (which I do that too). This recipe, as moistness goes, beats out a fried turkey to us any day!

This was great.  Everyone was skeptical when I poured soda in the pan, but they were believers when when they tasted that very moist and tender bird.  I brined the bird overnight and that cut the cooking time almost in half.

We used a brined turley so we omitted the seasoned salt. Also hubby said that 10 hours is wayy too long to smoke a turkey...he did our's for about 7. Very tasty but I think we preferred the turkey he deep-fryed.... sorry!

!st. Never choose a bird less than 13lbs as the waste/meat ratio is too high.
2nd. Brine the bird overnight, up to 24 hrs.
3rd. Salt the buttered outside and cavity liberally but nothing else as the smoke must have free access to generate the greatest effect. Only place the bird on the grate of the smoker and not in an aluminum tray that  would hinder the smokes ability to surround it.
4th. Once the bird is in the smoker, never open it to baste as the amount of time it takes the smoker to recover  only adds to the cooking time and diminishes the point of smoking in the first place.
5th. Some flavoring can be achieved by adding some to the drip pan below the grate the bird rests on or by using different woods such as apple wood.
And lastly, if you have a very large bird, I've smoked a 22 lb bird, finish it off in your oven for an hour. this will not dry out the bird or undo the smokiness.

This was our first time using our smoker for a turkey. The turkey was fantastic!  We cooked for 2 thanksgivings and each time the bird was delicious, fell off the bone and had the smoke taste throughout.

This was the first recipe I used after buying my electric oster smoker.
It is great!  I don't brine and it comes out fine.

I have used this recipe three times.
It NEVER takes 10 hours.
Every smoker is different, but for a 12-14 lb turkey..
I figure 20--30 minutes per pound, with the temp set at 250.
I like electric bcz you can control the temp and all you have to is plug it in and turn a dial.  No charcoal mess..
And of course, I use a meat thermometer to tell me when it's done
Happy thanksgiving
I love that my oven is free to bake pies and stuffing, while the turkey is out in the smoker.

I just used this recipe today to make my Thanksgiving turkey.  It turned out awesome!  I smoked in on my Traeger for 5 hours at 250 degrees and then at 325 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours until it reached an internal temperature of about 170 degrees.  I used 2 cans of Pepsi and I used the Traeger Pork and Poultry Seasoning instead of seasoning salt.  I used 2 garlic cloves cut up instead of the garlic powder.  I basted the turkey every hour and I let it sit for about 20 minutes wrapped in tinfoil before we sliced it.  It was soooo yummy!!!

This recipes is simple and delicious. I have a cheaper smoker without a temperature gauge or control, so I chose to cook in the oven for the first half and then smoke. It is now a family favorite.

Just made a 11lb. for a small Thanksgiving.  Excellent!  Best turkey we ever had!  We brined the turkey overnight beforehand and it cooked in the barrel smoker for only 3 hours. A quality meat thermomether helped us time it right.

I followed the recipe.  It took me 11 hours in my smoker and 1 extra hour covered with foil in my oven.  This was my first turkey to smoke.  It was delicious!   The outside wasn't burnt either.

This was by far the best turkey I have EVER eaten in my life! I'm not sure I could ever bake another turkey.  Even after 10 hours of smoking, the juices poured out of the bird!

Very excellent very first time using a smoker.  I did use a brine first, but followed everything else.  Delicious.

I used a bone-in turkey breast that weighed approximately 10 pounds.  I used the spices listed but placed them inside the skin of the turkey.  I added 1 tbsp. of white pepper as well.  I placed the apple and onion on the center part of the cavity.  I did not pour on the coke as I didn't want to clean the mess out of my smoker.

I smoked the bird for 2.5 hours and then removed it to a roasting pan.  I poured on the coke, covered, and baked the bird for an additional 2.5 hours (internal temperature 170 degrees).  

The turkey was very tasty.  I doubt it could have been much better had I smoked it instead of baking it.

I usually make teriyaki turkeys but this surely beat that this year.  I got compliments from my DAD! He is not one for much compliments so since he actually enjoyed eating turkey, i was happy.  I said I got the recipe online.  He just said it was my best turkey i made.  Thanks for the recipe! Made my thanksgiving a hit. :D !!

A turkey really has nothing (no fat or connective tissue) that benefits from low and slow cooking. Low and slow is very likely to lead to a dry bird. Cook at oven temp (325 -350) on your smoker and still use the hickory chips or chunks for smoking.

I smoked three turkeys using this recipe. A 10 lb bird for my office pot-luck was my test subject, and it was so well received I used the same recipe on a 12 lb bird for my family on Thanksgiving, then a 16.5 lb bird later that weekend because my wife liked it so much!
... when was the last time someone in your family wanted ANOTHER turkey after Thanksgiving? Exactly.
The recipe doesn't get specific about preparing the brine, it just tells you to add the ingredients to the cavity. I mixed the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then poured in the coke and stirred to combine. Then I melted the butter in the microwave and stirred it into the coke mix, which caused the butter to congeal into small pellets that would melt while smoking to moisten the bird. Finally, I added the onion and apple quarters to the mix and poured the whole thing into the seasoned turkey, making sure to pack in the onions and apples.
I used pecan wood first, then pecan and cherry on the next two. That was pretty much the only thing I changed.
I cooked the birds to a 165 breast temperature, then let them rest for 20 - 40 minutes before carving, and they all came out PERFECT. With my Cookshack electric smoker set to 230, the 10 lb bird took 7 1/2 hours to reach that temperature and the 12 lb bird took 9 hours. For the larger bird, I ramped the temp up to 250 which, surprisingly, dropped the cooking time all the way to 6 1/2 hours. I left the drumsticks untied and cut the skin between them and the body, allowi

If you want sawdust for Thanksgiving then follow these directions. 10 hours!!  180 degrees internal!!!  That’s nuts. I smoke mine at 300 to 325 to a temp of 158 in the breast. Take it off wrap it in foil and let it sit for 45 min.   That smoke takes about 3 hours for a 13 pound bird. You can figure about 15 min per lb with my directions.  I do it to 158 because the bird continues to cook when you take it off and wrap it.  It does not benefit you to do a turkey low and slow.

GR8. Got a Traeger smoker / grill for my Birthday - Retirement in October and tried two times before Thanksgiving adjusting the recipe each time. The first was a 10 pound, too much bone and not a lot of meat. Tasted okay but a little too much Spice. The second was a 15 pound that was better but found a couple of things that I felt needing improvement. The Thanksgiving day bird was 23 pounds. Use a Dry Brine (Kosher salt, Rubbed Sage, dry thyme, and Rosemary). Clean and stuff the inside with Onion, Carrot, and Celery, put the dry brine in and sowed up. 
After starting the Traeger put the turkey on a rack in a roaster pan and place on the grate. Add about 3 cups stock and smoke for 1 to 4 hours depending on the size. Rotate and baste every hour. Tent when it's had enough smoke, turn the temp setting to 300 and use an internal thermometer placed in a thigh inside not touching bone. Continue to rotate 180 and baste every hour until the internal thermometer reads 160, check the internal thermometer of the other thigh and if not up to 160 leave on the grill until it reaches 160. 
When don carefully transfer to a cutting board and rest for 20 to 30 minutes before cutting.
Started the 23 pound at about 4 AM and it was on the table about 1 PM.

Followed everything as noted in instructions. I used a 10lb turkey breast instead and it only needed 7 hours at 250 degrees. I ran out of apple wood chips and decided to use grape vines. This worked out perfectly!

The meat had no flavor at all.   Don't make this unless you brine it first.  My guess is brining would have made all the difference.  Yeah, the meat fell off the bone because it was basically boiled in Coca-cola.  And I put a lot of seasoned salt on there and was worried it was going to be too salty.  Couldn't taste any of it.  I think the cola absorbed all of it.

I always make two turkey each Thanksgiving: one that always comes out perfect (I will share the recipe some time later) and one experimental and we vote.  Well this one is equally great and now I am stuck with 2 that my family wants.  How do I fit a new experiment into the mix?  More guests?

This is the best smoked turkey I've made yet!  I used a 12.5 lb Butterball that I brined overnight in my turkey fryer pot.  Used water,Better than Bouillion, kosher salt, jalepeno honey, regular honey, Penzeys Florida pepper and fresh garlic.  I injected with Habanero infused real maple syrup about half an hour before smoking and put onion, a granny smith and 2 cloves fresh garlic in the cavity with some Pepsi.  I forgot to pickup a foil roaster so I used my ceramic chicken roaster and cooked bird breast side up with a bit of Pepsi in the bottom.  I rubbed my bird with EVOO and St. Amand's Cajun BBQ Rub and some Weber Beer Can Chicken seasoning.  I have an electric Masterbuilt I smoked over apple and hickory for about 5-1/2 hours.  I brought it in and basted with Bourbon Maple Syrup and put in oven at 325 for about 20 min to make glaze adhere.  Very flavorful and juicy.  I actually found the recipe about an hour into the smoking process and had already stuffed the cavity but just didn't have the cola so that didn't go in until about 2 hours into cooking but still turned out wonderful!  Thanks for the great addition!

I love this recipe.  It's now a Thanksgiving tradition to smoke a turkey with this recipe.  The meat comes out juicy and flavorful.  The best thing about it is it's simplicity.   I highly recommend it.

This is by far the best turkey I have ever eaten.  So easy to make.  My family just loved it.  This beats a baked turkey any day.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  The best turkey I've ever made.  Cooked in gas smoker about 7-8 hours and came out perfectly.  Even my mom, who doesn't like smoked turkey, loved it.  I think this might take the place of brisket at our BBQ's from now on.

The recommended cooking time is ambiguous.  To recommend a cooking time of 10 hours without stating the size of Turkey will cause many folks grief when they burn their bird.  For a 10 hour cooking time, you better be cooking at least a 20 pound bird.  How to figure the correct time for your Turkey, most folks recommend 30 minutes per pound at a cooking temp of 225.

I brined the 22 pound turkey for 48 hours, then followed the directions, except for the garlic. My brine had garlic, so I didn't use garlic here. Instead, I used olive oil and seasoning salt on the outside. Smoked for 13 hours at 230 degrees, electric smoker, using hickory. Everyone raved about how tender and juicy the white meat was. This is my new go to.

Pretty solid recipe. I did a 24 hour brine and followed everything else to a T.  I smoked a 13lb turkey and took it out when the leg internal temp was 165 degrees. Overall it was super moist but I also poured the drippings over the turkey after cutting it too.

This turkey turned out beautifully! The flavor is delicious and the turkey is incredibly tender. I would definitely recommend it to a first time smoker, because it was my first smoked turkey and it’s flawless.

Did an 11 lb turkey, only change was I only used 11 oz of cola and removed turkey once inner thigh was at 165 degrees.  Didn't put in a brine.  I wouldn't eat anything but fried turkey the past 15 years, after I tried this recipe on Wednesday, we changed our plans for a fried turkey on Friday to smoked as well.   It was enjoyed by everyone at both gatherings.

Delicious!  Only one change I will make next time.  It needs to be broiled at the end of the cooking time.  This will create a nice crispy skin. The skin without doing this is rubbery.

Cooked primarily around 225-250 degrees...
Took 8 hours for a 11.5 lb bird
Used Apple chips

Onion I used was too large, could only put 3/4s in. Only 1 can of soda fit.

It was well received by all guests. Next time I may cook it around 300 to speed up since I got up at 3am and was pretty exhausted by our meal start time of 4pm.

I did it the day before Thanksgiving Day.  I had 11.5 lb turkey in a charcoal weber smoker.  Cooking time was 6 hours.  I worked very hard.  I had two charcoal chimneys going and apple chips processing from soaking to draining to throwing them into the hot coals.  Also had hot chicken broth and melted butter for basting.  I also had a probe thermometer which proved invaluable.  The turkey was perfect the next day.

I used a Big Green Egg, charcoal with hickory wood and a dry brined 15-lb turkey. Followed the recipe exactly, minus the basting. The bird hit 170-degress in 5 hours exactly. Let it rest for 20 minutes before carving.  It was ready to eat in less than 6 hours.

Best turkey I've ever had!!! My wife and son think the same. It is so tender and delicious I cooked it exactly to the recipe I also put it in a brine for two days before hand and this is definitely going to be a tradition for my family. The bar I set today is high with this turkey. I don't think I could ever cook it any different. Sooo delicious!!!

This was our families first time smoking a turkey. To say we were nervous is an understatement!  We followed the recipe exactly, (but not the smoking time.). It was the best Thanksgiving turkey ever!  Even my daughter who “didn’t like turkey” is now a fan!  So incredibly moist and flavorful!  We are doing it again for Christmas. We also used the recipe for Out of this World Brine on this site. ????????

We made this for Thanksgiving. It was very tasty but we are trying again today. I felt the first one was a little on the dry side. I read someone's review saying it was better cooked to 165 instead of 180 so we are trying that this time. I will update my review after we taste it!

Made this in my new electric smoker for Thanksgiving yesterday. I used dry brining method a day before (1 Tbsp kosher salt & 2 Tbsp seasoning salt on the outside). Kept the bird in the fridge loosely covered with saran wrap. Uncovered it in the fridge in the morning. I rubbed the salt/pepper/garlic powder mixture inside the cavity and stuffed the bird with onion and apple. There was so much stuffing that I could barely fit everything inside the 12 lb bird.  I used about 16 oz of Pepsi (poured until it overflow and ran outside of the cavity) then I tied the legs. I put the bird in the smoker set on 235'F and covered with foil loosely. Added half mesquit and half apple chips once every hour. I wanted to put the thermometer in the breast at 4 hours in and to baste the bird with the liquid in the pan. I found that the bird was very pale after 4 hours so I left the bird uncovered after basting. I have not basted the bird again after that because I don't want the smoker to lose heat every time I open the door. I saw that couple reviewers mentioned it took them 5.5 hours to cook a 14 lb turkey in electric smoker. I thought I would give it 6 hours since my bird was only 12 lbs. It was a mistake. I miscalculated and totally forgot that the bird was stuffed, fully! And that would take much longer to cook for a stuffed bird. I suspected that the reviewers cooked their turkeys in just a few hours did not stuff their turkeys. However, even though it took longer than I expected, the bird t

Turned out great. The skin was nice and crispy, the turkey very moist. Basting it is key. We'll be doing this again!

Ok...so every single year I am the smoke master, I smoke a dynamite bird without fell.......but this year, I decided to try something different so I chose a recipe, and I'm glad it was this one.
Ohhhhhhh myyyyyyyy Gooooooooooood.
This bird went over like gang-busters.
The only thing I did was increase the recipe to service a 15 lb. turkey instead of for 10 lbs.  I stuck by the recipe 100%. My grandmother-in-law said it was the best turkey she had ever had in her 89 years alive.
My parents even asked if I would do this again for next year, heck...even my to toddlers that hardly eat meat kept wanting more. Even I as the cook was more then imprest with how juicy and flavorful it was.
10 out of 10 I'll do it again!!!!

oh, man...this is the best! I am not fond of turkey, so I thought I would throw our 14 pounder in the smoker. Hands down the best turkey ever- plenty of sweet smoky flavor, will do this again. one can of soda is enough, and put apple cider vinegar in water pan, using applewood chips. great recipe, thank you!! we now have a new Thanksgiving tradition!

Good starter recipe for smoking. Here is some helpful tips to make it even better and easier: brine the turkey overnight to up to 24 hours. Cook at 275-300 for crisper skin and to cut the time in half. Higher temperature will not dry it out with a brine at all and the brine makes it tastier and cook faster! If  it gets a little dark put tin foil over top lightly. 10-12 lb. turkey will cook very evenly and be done in 3 hours. I do cherry and a little hickory for smoke. Disposable cajun injectors from the grocery stores are good too! Happy Turkey Day!

Cook time in the recipe should be reviewed and possibly updated; dropped a star for that.

We have not cut it up yet but it smells wonderful! I have done some pretty large pieces of meat in the past but I have never done a bird on the smoker yet. I followed this thing to the T and the bird was done in less than 7 hours. Instructions call for a 10lb bird at 225 for 10 hours. My 13lb bird was done just under 7 hours and i did a pretty good job maintaining temp between 190 and 240.

lessons learned! birds smoke quicker than pigs.

This is the first Turkey I've ever cooked and I used my Traeger Electric Pellet smoker with Cherrywood pellets to do the job. I followed the exact recipe, however I altered the temperatures a bit and I also left it in a saltwater brine overnight. Everyone I talked to said it shouldn't take 10 hours to cook a 10lb Turkey. On Traeger's website, I found a recipe for Smoked Turkey and followed their instructions instead:

Leave Grill on "Smoke" and pace Turkey on the grill and smoke for 2.5 - 3 hours.
Switch setting to 350 degrees F and cook for 3.5 to 4 hours, or until internal temp reaches approx 170 degrees F.

Everyone loved the Turkey and said it was the best they've had. The Pink "Smoke Ring" Was perfectly visible on the outside of the meat, just under the skin.
I took it out when the chicken breast read 170 degrees and the Thigh read 180 degrees.

This recipe came out great!  However, likely due to my limitations, a 14-lb bird was done in just over 6 hours instead of the 10+ as expected.  The heat of the smoker stayed in the proper range, but I neglected to place the water pan inside before putting the turkey in.  Also, I had the turkey on the lower rack of the smoker instead of the upper, so this may have reduced the cooking time.  Because I monitored it, I didn't end up with a dusty bird, and all who ate it provided positive comments.  I did not add wood to the smoker, only charcoal, and slightly increased the amount of garlic I rubbed on the outside.  The meat quite literally fell off the bone.

OMG!  This was our first official homemade smoked turkey and it was amazing. I used my new Weber Smokey Mountain Smoker and it made the cooking easy. I had planned for the full 10 hours but it ended up only needing 8. I used a combination of hickory and apple wood for the smoke. 

I have tried other recipes and have been disappointed. This is a keeper!  This will become our family thanksgiving tradition along with our homemade pies!

Turned out amazing. This was my first smoked turkey, and only second time using a smoker. I used a dry rub that I have used on  ribs and cooked it for close to 5 hours. Everyone loved it. This was supposed to be an experimental attempt, but after our main turkey that we had planned on roasting smelled like rotten eggs after opening it, this one turned into the main attraction. It was a huge hit!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone couldn't stop raving about it.  The only thing I did differently was to brine the turkey the night before.  The one downside was the drippings were quite salty due to the rub and we couldn't use them for gravy.

Great flavor and it keeps the skin beautiful. I wouldn't mind a little more seasoning on the outside... maybe some Natures Seasoning or a little of a base chicken rub.

Used a wild turkey as I do most years.  I was expecting the turkey to be moister with the cola than other liquids I have tried, will go back to using  premade turkey broth next year.

17lb Turkey, followed the recipe to a tee.  11 hours at 225. Guests were pleased, I thought it was ok. Some parts were very juicy, others very dry. I think next time I may try injecting it before smoking.

I have to say that I was a bit skeptical about this method, mainly due to the ten hours of cooking. I’m from Ohio, so the ambient temperature outside was in the 30-40 F. We brined the turkey for 24 hours, but apart from that we followed the instructions to the letter and the family reviews couldn’t have been better. The meat was really tender, even in the thickest parts and the nice smoke taste was to die for. Since the recipe called for Cola, I imagined it was looking to add a slight hint of sweetness to the meat, so I used Cherry Wood for my smoke. Definitely the best all round Turkey I’ve ever made and tasted, a true winner and a keeper for every Thanksgiving dinner moving forward.

I found this recipe online, as we became in charge of the Thanksgiving Turkey.  I bought all the ingredients and went to work.  He prepped the birds (1 for family and 1 for leftovers) and smoked it.  We have a LP smoker and 2 - 12lbish  birds.  it took about 6-7 hours for the first bird and 8-9 for the second.  It was done a lot sooner than we had anticipated.  We devoured the wings of the first bird instantly, and ate the leg.  I don't like poultry much, and this was AMAZING!.  
We put the other bird in the oven to reheat it for the Thanksgiving, and everyone raved about how awesome it was!  I really don't like Turkey, and Love Ham.  This Turkey was better than my mom's awesome Ham.   For me to eat Turkey over Ham is amazing.  For me to eat more than a couple bites is amazing.  The gravy made from the drippings was really really good.  Amazing Amazing Amazing!!!!  

Never have to look at Turkey Recipes again!!!!

First time making a turkey and I aced it with this one.  I only had to make a slight adaptation to suit my smoker.  The smoker I used is a Char-Broil, "The Big Easy".  Seeing as how you have to orientate the turkey neck up, I put a can of coke standing upright on the rack, lowered the turkey on top of it, stuffed the neck with apples and onions alternating between them, then dumped the spice on top with a funnel.  After about 2hrs, I soaked up the drippings and poured them down the neck, repeated at about 3.5 hours, took it out at 4.5, then slow cooked for 1 more hour to finish it up.  On this 13lb turkey, the wings and legs began to fall off under their own weight and the meat is smoked perfectly and very moist.  Thank You for this recipe!

Was a perfect turkey! Here's how I made mine.  I soaked mine for 2 days using the  brine  recipe by SUDEMERS:

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/85839/out-of-this-world-turkey-brine made the recipe exactly as written. I smoked  My 10lb turkey in an electric smoker  on 250 and it reached internal temp of 165 breast/ 180 thigh within 6 hours, which was 4 hours sooner than our lunch party! So I turned temp  down to 200 and continued to baste every hour. It was so delicious and juicy. Will definitely make it again.  Only, next time, I will probably use 1 can of coke instead of 2. It was slightly too sweet for my taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Our smoker did not stay hot enough, so after 8 hours, we finished it in the oven. It was delicious!

Just smoked this 13lb. turkey. Was wonderful. The copper coloring alone was worthy of a photograph in a prized cookbook. Very juicy. Stopped smoking after 8 hrs. Very nice smokiness makes it better than oven baked. Used mesquite wood chips. Will do again! Drippings are so good you'll want to drink them up!

This is the best Turkey we have ever had. I followed the recipe, making minor changes. We used one can of cola for a 13lb bird and I added garlic and rosemary under the skin of the breast. We made this for thanksgiving and chose it again for Christmas dinner. We are using an electric smoker with applewood chips and we injected enough spices and butter to make Paula Dean blush. Amazing dish all around.

We got a smoker this year and I was determined to try to smoke a turkey for the first time this Thanksgiving. Not wanting to be responsible for potentially ruining dinner, I decided to make two turkeys. This was hands down the best turkey we've ever had. I used the brown sugar brine recipe (even with a butterball), and with a 14lb turkey it took about 6 hrs. I'm not even sure we'll wait until Christmas to try making this again!!

First time I smoked a turkey but I love my smoker...followed the directions as written and it turned out  PERFECT!!!  Best turkey I have ever made and one of the best I have ever eatin' ... I did brine the turkey the night before.  Not sure how much of a difference that made, however it was very juicy.

I used the brine from the Neely's based on another reviewer's recommendation.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  I had a 13 pound bird and cooked it on an electric smoker set to 240 degrees, took about 7 hours.  Used apple wood chips for the smoke.

The turkey was quite juicy, as it usually is after smoking it.  Most of the family really liked it but it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I think if I were planning to put  BBQ sauce on it, then this recipe would be perfect.  In fact, I do plan to try this tomorrow with some leftovers.  But for eating with other traditional side dishes, I may like it better with apple juice or beer instead of cola.

Great recipe. I first tried this year's ago with great success and everyone loved it. Over the years I've tweaked the recipe and also do a 48hr brine. Thanks to this recipe I'm now expected to make it every Thanksgiving.
