This was super good! I didn't really measure anything, just eye balled it, and cut the quantity in half, as it's just the 2 of us. Anyway, really tasty! I loved how the cheesy egg mixture cooked up. I used Tex Mex cheese, because it's already grated, and I was in a hurry. Anyway, it went really well.

This was Fantastic. I cut it down to 2servings since it was just my husband and I. Also I used a mix of zucchini and summer squash, sourdough bread crumbs, and sharp cheddar in place of the jack cheese for a more savory flavour. My husband (a hater of most things green) even loved this recipe!

While we really like the texture of this, the flavor was very, very bland.  Next time I'll try sharp Cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack and perhaps add some sun-dried tomatoes.  This makes a hearty main dish so it is well worth playing with this recipe until you find the seasonings that you prefer.

This casserole turned out great, and was very easy.  I added some chorizo and red onion to make this a meal.  YUM!!

Fantastic concept! This casserole is a great way to get veggies in the morning. It also makes a ton of food. I halved the recipe since there are just 3 of us and one is only 4 years old. I have to admit that I only used 1/4 lb zucchini and I shredded it. 1/2 lb would have been really wet but mine set up really nice.

This was a wonderful way to use more zucchini from the garden. I invited several people over for an impromptu dinner and they all raved about it. The others asked for copies of the recipe and I know we will be making it again soon. We ate it as a main dish just the way it was and served it with sliced tomatoes and a pistachio pudding salad to calm down the spicy aftertaste.

very good, easy, and quick to assemble. smelled heavenly while baking. only change I made was to use herb seasoned stuffing mix since that's what I had on hand (the crushed kind). Will definitely make again.

We did not care for this at all.  It was too "eggy" tasting.  Sorry.

Thought was OK. Good for something different. The kids did not like much and we all thought it could use less cheese or different type.

This was way better than expected! I had to cook it for about 15 minutes longer to let the egg cook and set.

It was a good recipe, however it was too "eggy" for our taste.  It may work better for us as a breakfast dish.  When I try it again, I think I am going to cut the egg suggestion in half, and add more cheese and breadcrumbs.

I have so many zucchini from my garden that I saw this recipe and decided to make it.  It was easy to make and it was absolutly delicious.  It said 8 servings but it was so good my husband and I ate 6.  It is a keeper, I will make it again.

This turned out really well. Since Iâ€™m eating low carb I made two changes: instead of bread crumbs, I used Kraft powdered parmesan cheese and instead of milk, I used heavy whipping cream. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was excellent and I will make it again.

It was good and I will make again. I will just use less eggs because it had an eggy taste (more like a breakfast casserole than dinner).

Husband liked it more than I did. I like other zucchini casseroles with a more ready flavor better. This turned out kind of runny.

This was fabulous and soooo easy.  It was also still tasty warmed up the next day.  I made three changes.  I used only 4 ounces of the pepper jack cheese.  I also used 8 ounces of colby/monterey jack cheese instead of plain monterey jack cheese.  I left out the butter on top of the casserole.  The cheese provided enough fat to combine with the bread crumbs on top and created a lovely, crisp layer.  We ate it as a main course.  This one is staying in my recipe box.
