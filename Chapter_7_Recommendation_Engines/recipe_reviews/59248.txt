i didn't want to rate this recipe with stars because i made a lot of changes (thus a rating technically wouldn't be accurate), but i couldn't submit a review without a rating, so i'm giving it 5 stars for versatility.  

i scaled the recipe down to 12 muffins, used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all-purpose flour, used starfruit (carambola) pulp instead of applesauce, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree, and used ginger instead of nutmeg (didn't have any).  i also added 4 tbsp of whole flax seed for a nutty texture. The muffins rose nicely, were very fluffy and not dense.  They were just faintly sweet, which which i prefer (i don't have much of a sweet tooth).  i used paper liners, and the only drawback was that the muffins stuck to the liners.  next time i would use a non-stick spray.  but overall, great recipe to start with.  i've included a picture as well.

These just came out of the oven, and they're wonderful! I made a few changes to make them even healthier: cranberries instead of raisins, 2 cups of white flour and 2 3/4 cups of an equal mix of ground flaxseed, oatmeal and whole wheat flour, and only 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of Splenda. The muffins came out very moist and are still sweet (which is saying a lot, since I have the biggest sweet tooth ever!). I will definitely make these again!

These muffins are a staple in our household. I use whole wheat flour instead of white and chocolate chips instead of raisins.
I also just do 2 1/4 t cinnamon and 2 1/4 t nutmeg (I don't do the ground cloves.)
It's a great healthy snack. Thanks!

I cut this recipe in half. I used 1 c whole wheat flour, 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup ground flax seed. egg beaters, and 1/2 c splenda 1/2 c reg sugar.They were plenty sweet! Very moist, high fiber and filled with good stuff. I love this recipe..it was very easy to convert to a healthy recipe. I did not use paper liners. I used a nonstick muffin pan..they came out beautifully.

ADDICTIVE is right!!!  My picky two-year old and I absolutely love these muffins.  Very nutritious.  Even better after being in the freezer.  I found it was much easier to just grease the muffin pans and not use the paper cups.  I spent too much time peeling the muffins from the paper.

This was my first time to make muffins w/o oil and they were amazing.  I did make a few changes though.  I substituted molasses for the raisins because my kids won't eat them and used an egg replacer.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached and also used half sugar substitute and half sugar.  Next time I will try adding shredded carrots to knock back some of the sugar without having to add a substitute.  Wonderful and nutritious muffins!!!

These are excellent! I made half a batch and they were all gone by the next day, I used whole wheat instead of white flour, and half Splenda/half Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of sugar. I also left out the nuts for my son's who is allergic. I made mini muffins which only took about 12 minutes to bake. So tasty!! The whole famiky could not get enough!

These are sooooo yummy, but I made some modifications - personal preference.
I use whole wheat flour and cut way back on the sugar.  I also use egg substitute.  Fantastic!

Wonderful!!  I used less sugar per other reviews (about 3/4 cup rather than 1 1/3 cups for 1/3 the recipe), otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I don't understand any of the negative reviews!

Good and easy.  My hubby likes it better without the raisins, so I make half the batch without and half with and that way, my muffins have more raisins.  YUM!

TOO MUCH SUGAR! :) 1.5 c. white sugar, 1.5 c. brown sugar -- max! for a healthier muffin, use 2 c. brown flour, 2 c. cake flour, and 1/3 c. ground flax. This gives the muffins some more substance then just using all-purpose flour.  I forgot to put in the raisins, and they turned out great. the first batch I made looked ok, but not exactly 'pretty'. I put pecan halves on the second batch, and 5 minutes before they finished baking I lightly glazed them with maple syrup. this gave the muffins a lovely sugar looking top with I took them out.

These are delicious!  I took others' advice regarding the spices and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp., cut the nutmeg to 1 tsp.  I also cut the sugar to 3 cups and used half whole wheat flour instead of all white flour.  They turned out perfectly in about 24 minutes, and we all loved them...second servings all around!

My family thought these were a little dry and they were not fond of the clove taste.  I made two modifications.  I added an extra half cup of applesauce and reduced the amount of clove to 1/2 teaspoon.  Made them this morning and they are delicious and moist.

I left out the raisins because I don't like them in breads.  I used a mixture of whole wheat flour and oats.  Reduced the sugar by 1 cup.  And used all pumpkin instead of applesauce.  It came out really delicious and no one could tell it was really healthy!

Yum!  I scale the recipe down from 36 servings to 12, which makes 3 dozen mini muffins.  These freeze perfectly and make my house smell faboo.  I do prefer to use 3 cups brown sugar instead of 4 cups of white - I get more flavor for less sugar and they're still sweet.  I also prefer to use whole-wheat flour, and I often substitute a third of that with oat bran for a nice change of texture.  I make these a lot - frequent changes that are good: up the amount of walnuts by 25%, add 1 to 1/2 cups finely grate a large carrot into the batter.  These changes don't affect the taste or cooking time/temp.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I sub out the cloves and use pumpkin pie spice instead (doubled the amount though), always use egg whites, and only bake for about 20 mins.  I have made them plain (without raisins and walnuts) as well as with chocolate chips as variations and they are amazing.  I also decrease the sugar by 1 - 1/2 cups.  Doing this plus using egg whites and no raisins, walnuts, or choc. chips brings them down to about 150 cals/muffin.

These were really good! I halved the recipe and cut the sugar back to 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. I also used egg whites in place of the whole eggs. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and it was wonderful. My husband loved them and it made the house smell so fragrant! Perfect for the holidays!

This is a great recipe! I did omit the cloves (I don't care for them), added pumpkin pie spice in its place. Cut sugar down to 1.5 cups white and 1.5 cups brown, brown sugar is more moist for baking with. I also added 3 ripe bananas just because I had them. Overall they are very moist, fluffy and fantastic! The recipe make 36 mini muffins and 6 mini loaf pans....hope they freeze well! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made some changes to recipe! Made only half and use 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 ap flour. I used 1 1/2 c sucanat which has a molasses like flavor and added cranberries and pecans instead of the raisins/walnuts. I sprinkled turbinado sugar on top for the crunch effect. I increased the cinnamon and decreased the cloves. They were moist and flavorful. Will make again!

tastes good, even though no oil/butter is used. i used over 2c chocolate chips instead of raisins/walnuts. i also cut sugar to 1 c white and 1 c brown. they taste fine! (probably the chocolate chips help) the muffins stick to paper liners, but not foil liners. i also sprayed with pam and just put them in the tin. that worked as well. freeze well.

i made my own changes: first, i halved the recipe.  i used 3/4 c raisins, 1 c. all purp. flour, 1 c. whole wheat pastry flour, 1 c. sugar, 3/4 t. of the leavening, salt, and spices, 2 eggs, 2 c. fresh roasted pumpkin puree, 3/4 c. sweetened applesauce (homemade), 1 T. maple syrup, 1 T. light agave nectar.  i omitted the pecans as i didn't have any on hand, but i will definitely use them in the future.  the batter was the perfect consistency and made 21 muffins, more than anticipated.  the muffins rose beautifully and smelled amazing as they baked.    they muffins are tasty, moist, and just sweet enough.  i like the complexity of the maple syrup.  next time i'll add flax meal and make sure i have pecans for a healthier touch.  bon appetit!

LOVE these muffins!!  I freeze all these muffins and microwave a few each morning for an instant breakfast for my children.  So much healthier than cereal or a Pop Tart.

Loved these! And I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin, but I really liked them. My husband and I polished off almost a dozen by ourselves :) My only changes were skipping the raisins and walnuts (didn't have any). I also used whole wheat flour and half brown sugar half splenda. I'll definitely be making these again! Oh, also cooked them only 25 minutes and they were perfect, I think they would've definitely burned if I had waiting until 30-35 minutes.

Delicious!  Chock full of taste and very moist.  I subbed half the sugar with Splenda.  For the 4 3/4 cups flour I used 3 cups all purpose and 1 3/4 cups whole wheat.  Next time I will double the walnuts.

This is an easy great tasting recipe.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I skipped the walnuts and raisins and added mini choc chips.  I cut the sugar in half and could cut back more for a healthier treat.

Overall a great base recipe that you can tailor to your own tastes.

Muffin tip: Use FOIL baking cups! The muffin does not stick to the liner and you don't even have to use cooking spray. Essential for muffin making, esp a recipe of this size.

This is the first GOOD muffin recipe I found that works well for king size muffin pans (makes 12).  I would reduce the nutmeg, it is a bit over powering, & increase the cinnamon.  Next time I might try adding whole cranberries!

Wonderful recipe!  Great for breakfast AND dessert.  I used slightly less sugar than the recipe called for, and it was still plenty sweet.  Thanks for sharing!
Also - I added a small amount of cream cheese filling to some of the muffins, and a cream cheese glaze to some of the others.  I used 1 (8 ounce) package of fat free cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, mixed until soft and creamy, and added a teaspoon or so in the middle of the muffins before baking.  Then I added several tablespoons of powdered sugar to the rest of the mixture that was left, and used that as a glaze after the muffins were baked (for people with a serious sweet tooth!).

This was fast and easy in the bread machine! I halved the recipe & used a 15 oz can of pumpkin. I used  all white whole wheat flour (King Arthur) for a lighter muffin and they were not at all heavy or dense. The spices were 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ginger and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I used 1 cup brown sugar (not packed) instead of white and the result was a "Pumpkin Pie" flavor that was perfect. I put everything in the bread machine (in no particular order, but I beat the eggs first) & let it mix for 5 minutes on the Basic White cycle (keep on eye on it to see if you need to scrape down the sides).  That was it!  The muffin tins were filled to the edge to get large tops and they were sprinkled with brown sugar & baked for 25 minutes.  They are bakery-pretty!  100% whole wheat, low sugar, low fat, fiber rich, Pumpkin Pie-delicious and very easy to make in the bread machine!

Very yummy! I only used 1 c. sugar though and it was still sweet, especially with the applesauce and raisins. I also added 1/4 flax for extra fiber, and used one cup of bran, one cup of white flour and the rest whole wheat. I don't think these changes (other than the sugar) made much a difference in the flavor of these original muffins. They were really good and I will definitely make them again!

I did make alterations, but this is a definite 5 star recipe for versatility! I scaled the recipe down to make 6 muffins first, and I changed a few things to make them healthier. I used 1/4 cup raisins, 1/2 cup + 2 teaspoons whole wheat flour, 1/8 cup wheat germ, 1/8 cup milled flax seed, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon (generous 1/2 teaspoon, that is) cinnamon, 1 egg (I was out of eggs so I used 1 tablespoon soy flour mixed with 1 tablespoon water), 1/3 (more or less) agave nectar, 1/2 cup + extra canned pumpkin, 2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons unsweetened applesauce. I left out the nuts and ground cloves because I was out, but added a crumble topping of a small amount of brown sugar and a small amount of oatmeal. These are still baking as I type, but the batter tasted pretty amazing, and I'm pretty sure my substitutions leave them at less than 200 calories each. I baked mine in heart shaped muffin tins. Too Cute!

WOW! they just cooled enough for me to taste.  i'm impressed!  they rose nicely and are very tender and tasty!  i made a batch of lowfat oat muffins and they were nothing compared to these!  i was hesitant about baking these muffins because of the 4 cups of sugar but realized that it makes a large amount of muffins.  like other members i made a few variations, 3 cups all purpose flour (all i had left) and 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour, half/half white and brown sugar, i roasted some raw pumpkin seeds for the nuts (that was fun - they puff up), used golden raisins (loved the soaking tip) and only 1/2 t of ground cloves because i'm not a clove fan (will omit completely next time).  the addition of the pumpkin seeds made these taste like they were from a gourmet coffee shop.  fancy schmancy!  MIDNITEJASMINE, thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Hard to believe that except for the sugar, these are actually healthy! They are amazingly good.

I used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour, 4 cups of unbleached white flour, and switched out half the raisins for Welch's dried berry blend (cherries, golden raisins, blueberries, cranberries). Really good.

I made a half-recipe of these using the leftover canned pumpkin from when I made pumpkin pie.  I substituted chopped frozen cranberries for the walnuts and replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole-wheat flour.  Also, following other reviewers' suggestions I cut the sugar down by half.  I was surprised by how good they are considering they're so low-fat... but with the sugar cut down I think they need more spices.  I would double up the spices next time, and maybe use brown sugar instead of white to give them a little more flavor as I thought they were a little bland.

The muffins smelled wonderful, they looked fine, were fairly moist, but they didn't have a very good flavor.  I omitted the raisins but that shouldn't effect the flavor very much. I think I'll look around for a different recipe.

I thought these muffins were great!  I actually used almost all whole wheat flour (just because I realized as I was making them that I was almost out of white) and I didn't think you could even tell because the pumpkin taste takes over!  Also, I cut the sugar in half, down to 2 cups, because 4 just seemed like SO much to me and I prefer to not eat so much sugar.  They were plenty sweet with just the 2 cups!  We hate raisins, so used mini choc chips instead and I have been eating them for breakfast every day since!  TASTY!

I made these muffins this evening as stated, except the raisins (didn't go along with dinner & to reduce the over all sugar content), and they are excellent.  I also added a 1/2 cup of milk, I live in a high altitude area and adding additional fluid when baking is essential.  Thanks for sharing!!

These are delicious! I made 1/3 of the recipe and ended up guessing at the amount of pumkin (used about 1 1/3 cups, and they turned out wonderfully moist, but tender. I love that there is no oil or butter. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are great!  I made a few changes.  I used 6 tablespoons of pureed apricots instead of eggs, because my 1 yr. old has an egg allergy.  I also used Allspice instead of nutmeg, but that's just because I didn't have the nutmeg.  They turned out great.  Not very fluffly, kind of dense, but I think that's just b/c of the egg substitution.  I'm new to the egg allergy thing, so I don't know how to fix that yet (suggestions are welcome).  I think next time I'll use less cloves, but that's just a personal preference.  I'm trying to find a cream cheese frosting recipie to go with them.  Bonus:  They made my hosue smell amazing!

Great recipe! I did 2 cups of wholewheat flour and 2 and 3/4 cup with white flour. Taste and texture turned out fine. I also added 2 tsp of all of the spices as I like things flavorful. I also added 1/2 tsp of ginger.  Also, tried choco chips instead of raisins and turned out delicious!

So delicious!  I cut the sugar WAY back to 1 cup brown sugar; and used 2 cups white flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup oatmeal.  Next time I may try a little more oatmeal.  I used two metal pans sprayed with Pam, and one set of silicone baking cups, and had no sticking problems at all.

Delicious, moist muffins full of fall spices.  I added only 2 cups of sugar, used 1/2 whole wheat flour and left out the raisins.  These have a very strong clove flavor, which I love, but if you're not a big fan, you'll want to use less in your recipe.

Good, husband and kid tested and approved.   I also cut the sugar to one cup and substituted bittersweet chocolate chips for the raisins and walnuts.  They were more than sweet enough.  Also used my new favorite King Arthurs white whole wheat flour.  Read the review about them sticking to muffin papers, so I put directly in sprayed non-stick muffin tins and they popped right out.  I can see this becoming a staple over the winter.

These muffins are awesome!  I used all whole wheat flour in mine along with 2 cups of splenda and 2 cups of brown sugar splenda.  I also subed craisins instead of raisins and made some with coconut added!  Make sure you use pumpkin puree too, not pumpkin pie mix!  These are very hearty muffins, but the taste is wonderful!  Everyone who has tried these loves them!  One thing to note is that they cook a bit faster than mentioned...mine only took about 20 minutes in the oven!

I have tried other pumpkin muffins on this site and definitely prefer these.  I made a couple small changes, but they turned out really well.  I did not use raisins. (I used choc. chips for 1/2 the mix to help entice my kids to eat them).  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar; I used 2 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup all-purpose, and 1 cup oatmeal instead of the other cup of flour.  I used extra cinnamon. Not only are they tasty, they have made the whole house smell delicious! I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Quite tasty.  Thanks for all the previous advice regarding sugar, etc.  (The reviews are one of the best parts of AR, I think!)  I used cupcake pans (smaller than muffin pans) and the recipe made 18 cupcakes, 3 mini loaves, and 2 6-inch diameter cakes.

I lost a similar recipe and this one worked just as well.

The cans of pumpkins available here seem to be slightly smaller (796 mL) so I cut the recipe back slightly using less flour and definitely less sugar. In fact, next time I'll use even less sugar, it really didn't need it.

I like to add extra spice and pretty much doubles the spice quantities.

I made mine with cranberries instead of raisins and also added orange rind, as recommended by the Joy of Cooking. Delicious.

I also add a squirt of lemon juice to better activate the baking soda. 

As a true lover of all things pumpkin, I give this a big thumbs up!

Amazing! I have made these many times, and usually use about half the sugar and whole wheat flour. They're also good with wheat germ added. They're freezable, which is nice since it's such a huge recipe.

These muffins were great!  I adjusted the recipe to serve 12, and used golden raisins instead of regular ones.  I also used half whole-wheat flour and half-unbleached, and egg substitute instead of regular eggs.  They were a little spicy (due to the nutmeg) but I thought that was a nice touch. The muffins stayed moist  and soft, even after a couple days (instead of turning to rubber like other low fat muffins I've made).  The only thing that was less than perfect about these muffins was that I used muffin liners, and they had a tendency to stick.  However, that will not discourage me from making these again.  Seriously, these are some of  the best muffins I have ever made- I can't believe they are healthy as well!

Hi..well I must confess, I'm NOT a big fan of pumpkin, BUT..these muffins ROCK!  I made them with whole-wheat flour instead of the white, and I used 2 cups of SPLENDA instead of 4 cups of sugar.  I think 4 cups sounds like a lot of sugar.  Anyway, my entire family LOVED these.  They are a keeper.  Thank- you to "MidnightJasmine" for this recipe!

Really tasty muffins.  My entire family gobbled them up.  However, they stuck to the paper liners.  After baking them, I noticed the oven was set at 375, not 350.  Could this be the cause of sticking?

This is the most fabulous muffin recipe ever, and even for people who are not fond of pumpkin, as the spices, apple sauce, raisins, nuts, etc. really come out and the  pumpkin is subtle.  I used whole wheat flour totally for a more nutritious muffin and I may substitute with a sweetener instead of the brown sugar that I used, the next time I make them.  I only made half of the recipe but I am making them again today!!  Thank you so much, and I don't mind the bit about them being difficult to take out of the paper. Isn't that what a muffin is all about?  Enjoy, I have now given this to 4 or 5 friends!!

These muffins have great flavor, the only problem I had was that they stuck to the muffin liners. I scaled the recipe to make 12 muffins; I used 1 1/2 tsp of apple pie spice and 1/4 tsp of ginger instead of the seperate spices, also cut back on the suger by 1/3 of a cup because my applesauce was not unsweetened. I will make these again but next time will not use muffin liners will just spray my muffin pans with non stick spray. Love that they are low fat and good for you!

I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again.  I love that there is so much pumpkin, and used some wheat flour and wheat germ for additional grains and fiber.  Also used golden raisins instead of the dark variety, and they worked out very nicely.  Would highly recommend giving this recipe a try.

Love, love, LOVE these!  I used some frozen pumpkin I had in my freezer from last fall.  (I actually roast fresh pumpkin when in season, puree it and then freeze it in 2 cup portions)  I also used Craisins instead of raisins and didn't use the applesauce, but used about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  Not sure the oil was necessary and probably won't do it next time.  All the above adjustments were made based on 12 servings, not 36 (1/3 of the recipe)!  When I make muffins I freeze them and then just pop one in the microwave for about 30 seconds when I'm hungry for a muffin!  Will be making these again when my freezer supply runs out. :)

So good and the best part of all is that this is the exact size of pumpkin that Sam's has.  I'm getting more cans very soon :).  Instead of cooking mine in tins I cooked it in 2 13x9's and it came out very nice.

I really like these muffins.  I wish I had read the rest of the reviews and reduced the sugar.  They were just a tad too sweet for me.  I omitted the raisins, but otherwise stayed with the recipe.  I will make these again.

All I can say is WOW!!!!  These are totally addictive - so beware.  I did tweek the recipe by switching out 1/2 the flour with Whole grain Whole Wheat flour and swapping out half the sugar with Splenda.  The only other thing I will do different the next time is NOT use paper liners - the muffins stuck real bad.  I will spray the pans.  I'm going to share this recipe for sure!  YUMMY!!!!!!

Oh my gosh, these are wonderful!! I substituted whole wheat flour for all 4 3/4 cups, and brown sugar for half of the sugar. I would actually probably cut down on the sugar by a cup next time, as these are pretty dang sweet; but YUM! I'll make these again for sure :)

We all love these muffins, especially the fact that they are low fat.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of raisins per my kids' request.  I also cut the recipe down to 12 muffins.  They baked up very nicely and have just the right amound of spice - will for sure be making again.

Muffins are delicious & my somewhat picky kids even love them!  I made minor changes including replacing raisins with chocolate chips, cutting the sugar in half & using brown sugar.  I also put only a pinch of nutmeg and eliminated the walnuts.  Finally, I used 50% whole wheat flour.  They turned out moist & very tasty.  I made the large batch & froze them.  I even made some in the mini muffin tins so I can pop them into school lunch boxes straight from the freezer.  Will definitely make these again soon.

I found this to be a little chewy and not very fluffy. The taste was lovely and all my guests chowed them down with compliments all around. My preference is for fluffier muffins. Next time I'm going to try adding a bit of baking soda as well...

I have made these many times, we just love them! I actually make loaves and mini loaves out of the mixture, instead of muffins- in that case they need to bake 50-40 minutes. I give them away to people as gifts, as well! I change a few things: I use whole wheat flour, 2 cups white and 2/3 cup brown sugar, I use the whole can of pumpkin for more moisture, and instead of walnuts I use 4-8 tbsp flax seeds. Very nutty and healthier!

I made these last week! These muffins are awesome!!! I replaced the  4 cups white sugar with 3 cups raw sugar and sprinkled 1/2 cup on top of the muffins and used all whole wheat flour. I also added 1 ripe banana mashed and omitted the walnuts since I didn't have any. These are a hit in my house! My picky sister even said that these are the best muffins she has ever had and requested it as a cake for her bday.

these are FANTASTIC! i made some adjustments that turned out great. i used whole wheat flour and added ground flaxseed, used pumpkin pie spice, and i used plain low-fat yogurt instead of the applesauce. the combination of the yogurt and the pumpkin made AMAZINGLY moist and rich muffins...everyone said they were more delicious and rich than the full-fat pumpkin muffins i've made! this recipe is a definite keeper.

Perfect fall treat, nutritious and delicious! I changed the yield to 12 muffins, using 1.5 cups pumpkin. I substituted mini semi-sweet chocolate chips for the raisins (although my own personal preference would have been raisins), adding to the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients. Also subbed pumpkin pie spice for  the nutmeg and cloves, Splenda Baking Blend (half white, half brown) for the sugar, and whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the flour. Made 23 mini-muffins, baked at 325 (dark pan) for 15 min. Came out perfectly moist! Tried another recipe first, this one is far superior! Our new favorite.

They were okay.  I didnt really like the "spicy" flavor.  Maybe too many cloves? I will test them on my family and get back to you.  I recommend mini-muffins.

Delicious! I made it even healthier (and scaled it for only 6 muffins because I was experimenting)  3/4 cup flour turned into 2/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 equal parts oats, ground flax seed, and wheat germ.  I also used cranberries instead of raisins.  30min at 350 was perfect.  These are so great, Im going to make more after work, and more this weekend for Halloween ^_^

These were so great! Instead of the cloves, I substituted pumpkin pie spice. I also subbed vanilla yogurt for the applesauce. They only needed to bake for about 20 minutes instead of the 30-35 the recipe called for. These were amazing! What a healthy and delicious recipe!!

Love this recipe!  Found it a week ago and have made it 3 times.  My son screams for these "Cakes".  I omit the raisins & walnuts.  Add 3/4 cup rolled oats, use Whole Wheat flour, and 1/2 white and brown sugar. And I double the baking soda and baking powder.   Amazing recipe!!

These are amazing. Noone will ever guess how healthy they are. I did not use the walnuts or raisins and did use half whole wheat flour and took them to work and everyone raved. Mine only took 23 minutes to cook.Super moist!!

So delicious! Replacing about half or more of the flour with whole wheat flour worked well with some wheat germ thrown in too. I added some chocolate protein powder to the mix as well and topped with slivered almonds. Yum!

*********** is how many stars I would give this recipe if I could. I love these muffins! I've made several batches so far and they only get better every time. I always substitute applesauce for oil and have used combination of white flour with whole wheat flour, oats and flax seed. All are delicious! I've added raisins, dried cranberries, various types of nuts and even granola to my mixtures and can't wait to try chocolate chips. I usually use less sugar than called for and usually use at least half brown sugar. They are always plenty sweet and VERY moist. The title isn't misleading when they call these things Addictive :)

This recipe was great!  I made a few variations:  I used 3 cups of Splenda instead of sugar and chopped fresh apples instead of using applesauce.  They turned out nice and moist just bursting with flavor!  Great recipe!  I loved that there was no butter or oil in the recipe, it made it that much healthier.

Health food cannot get better than this. For more nutrition, I use half whole wheat flour and replace more of the all-purpose with rolled oats and ground flax seed for a little more texture. I also cut back on the sugar, use Splenda, and replace the eggs with an egg substitute. Next time I'll try adding some seeds to the mix. I could eat these every day of my life.

These are pretty good, but they turned out a bit bready (probably due to the fact that I used 2/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 regular).

I made these as a healthier alternative to pumpkin pie.  I used mostly Splenda, along with a little sugar.  I made them as written and they turned out wonderful.  They are not cakey, instead they are pretty dense.  Lots of flavor.

I used Splenda for baking- the kind that's half real sugar- and I only used 3 cups of it.  These were great!  I think I'll try using only 2 3/4 cup of the splenda/sugar next time, as I think that would still be plenty sweet.

These were amazing! Addictive they are...I have a busy schedule and was able to make these in no time. Recipe was easy to cut in 1/2 too. I made them with Splenda for Baking, regular applsauce, craisins instead of raisins and pecans instead of walnuts. They came out great. Stuck a little to paper liners...next time I will spray a muffin tin or even spray the liners with a little Butter Flavored Pam. Making again in a couple of days for my Aerobic Classes I teach the week of Halloween.

I loved these muffins and so did everyone else who tried them.  I did not add the raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts just out of personal preference.  These were the moistest muffins I have ever tasted.  I was pleased because my new mother-n-law said they were the best muffins she had ever eaten (and she is a great cook.) Thanks for the recipe!!

Very easy to make and delicious.  With pumpkin bread around...I know fall is finally here.  Making my favorite fall treat in a muffin-form provides a great/quick snack for the family, and you would never know these were reduced in fat.  I did not add the raisins or nuts, since I prefer without...the recipe is still wonderful.  Thank you for sharing it.

I made these today and they were WONDERFUL! My friends all raved and asked for the recipe. I served them with whipped cream cheese. Make sure to use a HUGE bowl when mixing as it makes a lot of batter. I wouldn't change a thing!

Tip: Buy the "If You Care" brand of muffin liners and they will never stick to anything! They come in a small brown box. I reduced the sugar a lot and used all whole wheat pastry flour. I'm surprised others are calling them 'healthy' due to the suggested amount of 24.4 grams of sugar in each muffin. Sugar is addictive. While lower in fat, with all due respect the sugar content makes them the opposite of healthy.

These were very good! I didn't follow the recipe 100 % because I had no applesauce on hand but replaced it with vegtable oil which in turn probibly made mine a little bit more moist. I made full mounded muffins and in 25 mins they were done, so you might want to watch them. I think the taste is wonderful and you can play with this recipe. I also put strusel topping on 1/2 of mine (family preference). I think this recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Very good! Chewy and perfectly dense. I used craisins instead and cut the sugar to 3 cups. They were still sweet enough, next time might use even less.

I made these without the raisins, walnuts, and cloves because I didnt have them/wasn't sure what my guests would like.  They turned out great.  I made them for breakfast the next morning - but most of them were gone before they went to bed that night!  They were good, not too sweet, not too plain.

I was torn on how to rate this recipe as my review is not based on it exactly as written.  In good conscience, I could not measure out the sugar -  the amount of it in this 'healthy' muffin is astounding.  They would no doubt be unbelievably sweet - the sugar and flour amounts are almost equal, wow, I just couldn't do it :).  Having said that, I love the fact that there is no oil or butter, but applesauce, which is something I am quite accustomed to using when I attempt to make a muffin or loaf a bit healthier.  I drastically reduced the sugar (quite so, as in using about 1 1/2 cups), mind you, I split the batter into 2 parts, using a small amount of semi sweet chocolate chips in one half and fresh cranberries in the other.  My boys would be more likely to eat them with some chocolate chips, but I am partial to the tart pop of cranberries!  I did sub out some of the flour for ground flax and left out the walnuts and raisins due to my other add ins.  These muffins are very dense and heavy (not light and fluffy like some muffins can be), therefore look somewhat 'lumpy' when they are baked.  I am thinking too that 6 eggs are a bit steep for the yield of this recipe, though I did not change that.  A decent muffin, even with my few changes, these in my opinion are a 3.5.  Happy baking!

These muffins are SO delicious.  The only reason I gave them 4 not 5 stars is that they totally stick to paper liners, what a waste!  I see now that other people are having that problem too.  I wonder if it's because there's no oil.  In the future, I will just use cooking spray and no liner.  
I modified just a little: used fresh pumpkin from my garden, only used 1.5 cup of sugar (4 seemed excessive) and added cranberries as well as raisins.  I will certainly be trying these again.  I used the original recipe proportions for 36 muffins and it made exactly 36 muffins.  Amazing!

I didn't like this recipe at ALL! I followed it by the book and it was not good. I absolutely love pumpkin muffins, so I was really excited. But it fell flat. If you're making it, DO NOT ADD THE CLOVES! And I do NOT recommend the raisins either! Big nono :(

These are amazing muffins.  I made a few adjustments to make them more healthy.  Substituted 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat, used 1 3/4 cup of splenda (plenty sweet & delicious), added 1 1/2 cans ( 29oz size), 1 3/4 c applesauce.  This made them more moist. You can also replace raisins with choc. chips or cranberries which are delicious, too!

Everyone in my family (even my 1 year old) goobled these up.  I made one 12 muffin batch and used 1/3 cup less sugar,  1/8 tsp less cloves, and added 1/2 tsp of ginger.  Absolutely delicious!  They do stick a bit, so grease the muffin pan liberally.  Thanks for a great, healthy recipe!

I have made these muffins many times.  I always use chocolate chips (usually 1 C mini), part whole wheat flour, and about the 1/2 the sugar (no Splenda, just less - I don't think muffins need to be that sweet.)  I also vary the spices sometimes - more cin.  less cloves, sometimes allspice or pumpkin pie spice. It all works.  My kids love them.  They are light and delicious.  This time after reading some reviews, I added 1/2 t of ginger - YUM! A nicer touch than I expected - I may add more next time.  I love this recipe.

I reduced the recipe to 18 servings, replaced 1 cup sugar with Splenda, replaced 1 cup AP flour with whole wheat flour, and omitted the walnuts.   This is the first time I got the muffins to raise well, and they turned out great!

Great flavor and texture! I just used 3 1/2 t. of pumpkin spice instead of individual spices. Very moist.  After looking at some of the other recipes I decided to try a couple "add ins"  I chose to add apple dices to 1/2 of my batter and a cream cheese center to 1/4, and did 1/4 regular.  All very good. Chocolate chips, or cranberries would be good too.

Yummy but I made changes: reduced recipe to 24 servings (I used mini muffin tins which made 48 muffins), used dried fruit instead of raisins (blueberries, cherries, plum antioxidant mix), a whole can of pumpkin (15 oz), replaced 1/2 cup flour with 1/2 cup of ground flaxseed & reduced sugar to 2 cups (will reduce sugar to 1 cup next time), used 3 tsp pumpin pie spice instead of 3 separate spices.  Delicious & moist!

I wouldn't exactly call these addictive, but they are pretty good.  My biggest complaint is that it is almost impossible to get the muffins out of the tins after baking if you use all applesauce and no oil.  The next time I make them, I plan to try 50% oil and 50% applesauce.  I also think the sugar could be scaled back to 2 cups, because they are very sweet otherwise

I only made 16 servings.  I substituted half of the sugar with brown sugar and I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. They came out very tastey!  I'm going to try freezing some soon.

I loved this recipe!  I drastically decreased the sugar though.  I used 1 cup of the white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon ginger.  And I used dried cranberries.  But this is a wonderful recipe and I will make it again.

I cut the servings to 12 and baked in 2 small bread pans for 35-38 minutes. I did spray and flour the pans and they did not stick at all.  Very easy to put together and healthier bread then normal.  Can't wait to share with some friends!

Love them, I always use applesauce instead of oil so glad to see this published so others can try it!  I too used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  Same with 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 whit flour.  I am going to cut down on the sugar next time to reduce the calories.

I made these muffins today, and they are very good. I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, cut sugar by 1 cup and used homemade applesauce from a recipe on this site. My kids love them. They will be great for snack time! Thanks for the recipe.

I made healthy substitutions,also, and they turned out really delicious. I scaled the recipe down to 24 as 36 would have yielded too many: 3 cups of whole wheat flour and only 1 cup of sugar (2+ cups seemed like too much); I didn't have all of the spices, but I did have cinnamon and apple pie spice and vanilla extract.  Not all my children like raisins, so I didn't mix them into the batter; I added them to the top of 1/2 of the muffins.  I made a simple topping to the muffins before baking: cinnamon and sugar (I keep this mixture in an old cinnamon container to sprinkle on the kids' toast), dash of apple pie spice and raisins. The muffins are not "picture-worthy" but they taste great and the kids couldn't get enough of them.  When I entered the ingredients into a calorie calculator, they were about 120 cals each.  Not bad and with healthy ingredients and fiber.

This is the recipe I loved but lost!  So happy to find it again.  I love the density as I like a hearty muffin for breakfast, not ones that are more like cake.  I have enough recipes with wheat flour, which overwhelms the flavor to me so I stick with white for this one.

I don't understand those who change the recipe, use different measurements and flavors, and then say the recipe didn't turn out good.  I do change some things to go along with my tastes at times but not measurements or things that have to do with moistness.  

This recipe freezes very well.  I make the whole batch, freeze it, then take out a few every couple of days.  Delicious and filling!

This is one of the best muffin recipes I've found. They are so simple to make and came out perfect. I did not want to make 36 servings, so I did the recalculation for 12 servings and then followed the advice of some of the other reviewers by replacing some of the white flour with whole wheat (1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp AP). I also added 1 tbsp of flaxseed oil and then replaced the nuts and raisins with chocolate chips to make them appealing to my little ones. Because I knew I wanted to use chocolate chips, I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cups. My toddler enjoyed mixing the ingredients and filling the muffin tins, and we had a lovely tea party when the muffins were done cooling. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Also, with my modifications, I determined that each muffin has about 200 calories--would be quite a bit lower without the chocolate chips, but they were so tasty that even my husband enjoyed these and he is not a huge fan of muffins.

I wish there were more stars to use!  This is THE best muffin recipe I have ever used.  I didn't even realize it until after I was done making up the batter, "I didn't use any oil or butter."  Anyway, I was concerned about whether it would be dry or not, no.  Also very moist.  I tried to scale the recipe down, but it was telling me to use like a half of an egg?  That made me laugh, so I decided to just be prepared at the end with some good freezer bags and I froze 24 of them.  Excellant recipe!

These were wonderful!  I made some changes.  I used 2 cups of sugar instead of 4 and they were plenty sweet.  I also used 3 cups of spelt flour and 1 3/4 cups millet flour.  I also wanted to use oil because my daughter needs the calories, so I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 c applesauce.  My kids ate them up!

I really LIKE these!  It's not so much that they are the most sinful thing you've ever tasted, it's that they're quite good, really low fat, and literally addictive.  I made mine using whole wheat flour, craisins instead of raisins (eyew rasins) and diced apple instead of walnuts. I also used splenda instead of sugar.  Since I live in Israel, I couldn't find canned pumpkin. So I decided to go to the store to make my own. Apparently pumpkin is the word they use to mean butternut squash, so  I steamed and mashed butternut squash with some pumpkin pie type spices and a dash of salt. I got about 24 little muffins (they don't really rise). My boyfriend said they are cute, but that they're not really his "type" of thing, but he went back for seconds, so who know. I'll make these again.  You kind of have to work to chew them, but that's cause they're dense.  I like them!

Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I first changed the serving size down to 1 dozen muffins but then I made some healthy modifications to this recipe.  I used all whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  Instead of 1-1/3 cups sugar, I used 1/4 cup Splenda and between 1/8 and 1/4 cup of honey.  I didn't have nutmeg (Shoprite ran out) or ground cloves so I doubled the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  I used eggbeaters to replace the eggs but put an extra 1/2 egg in.  I also overflowed the 1/3 cup of applesauce and added about 1/4 of fat free plain yogurt.  These muffins made my dorm smell INCREDIBLE.  I also topped them with extra cinnamon.  They were extremely moist (I think I took them out a minute or two early) and have a nice pumpkin-wheat-nut-raisin flavor and even my non-health-conscious roommates liked them as well as my coworkers!  I am going to make another batch or 2 tonight to freeze.  Highly Recommended!!

Delicious!

I made a few changes (very flexible recipe), and it still came out well. I cut the recipe in 3rd, and came out with 6 large muffins (about 5 oz each). 

I used only 1/2 cup sugar, but added 8 packets (equivalent of 1/3 cup) splenda, and 1/4 cup of sugar-free caramel syrap. There is a SLIGHT difference in taste for those unused to sugar subsitutes, but if you're used to them, the taste is still pretty good, and it cuts a lot of calories.

I also used whole-wheat flour, which seems to compliment the pumpkin well.

I didn't have cloves or ginger, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg instead. I upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon (3 teaspoons in the original recipe). I also used 2 egg whites and 1 egg--turned out well. Instead of 1/3 cup of oil, I used a 6 oz can of vanilla yogurt (3/4 cup). It added a nice flavor, while still keeping it moist.

Finally, I added half a cup of mini chocolate chips tossed with a few teaspoons of flour at the end--absolutely delicious!

Surprisingly delicious reduced-fat muffins, moist and light!  I decreased the sugar by a quarter;  12 muffins called for 1 1/3 cups, I used 1 cup.  I also skipped the raisins and nuts, and used 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips instead. I will now have to restrain myself from eating the entire batch.  Really good.

This is DELICIOUS!  The consistency is a little different, they aren't quite as fluffy as most muffins, but they are SO GOOD!  The changes I made were using 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 3/4 cup white flour, and 1 cup oats (instead of 4 3/4 cups flour), 3 cups sugar instead of 4 (which was plenty...I'll probably do even less next time, especially if I add chocolate chips again), 1 tsp. cloves instead of 1 1/2, no raisins and walnuts, but added chocolate chips.  YUMMY!  I used regular sized muffin pans and cooked for 24 minutes, and mini muffins cooked for 18 minutes.  Made 24 regular sized PLUS 24 mini.  This recipe makes a TON! Just barely fit in my KitchenAid.

My family of 5 didn't care for this at all. Felt too heavy, like a bran muffin. Husband said it didn't taste like pumpkin pie at all. Kids only are one and then were done. They eat two or three muffins when they love them! Unfortunately, we won't be trying this one again. I halved the recipe for my little family's breakfast and made no changes.

These are great - I cut the recipe in half and it made 18 large muffins.  For the half recipe, I used 1 cup sugar and a total of 
1&1/2 cup applesauce. Being from Georgia, I substituted pecans for the walnuts.

I am just not fast enough to put this together in 15 min.  But it's great t have a recipe that makes a large quantity.  I love that.
     The bones of the recipe are invaluable.  I did eliminate 1cup sugar.  The muffins were not as light as they would have been otherwise, but they were still plenty sweet.
     I don't really like cloves so I changed the spices to 1T cinnamon,1/2 t ginger, and 1/4 t nutmeg.
     These are just the right size.  I scooped the dough from the bowl into my muffin tins with an ice cream scoop and came up with exactly 3 dozen.  And one just fills me up.
      So much to love about this recipe.

this  is a real good muffin. i made 1/2 a recipe and got 2 dozen muffins, which was plenty. that was fine, no problem. my major problem was it really stuck to paper liners, probably because of no shortening. i would definitely grease instead next time.

These muffins are absolutely delicious - they're moist, light, and flavorful.  I didn't miss the oil a bit.  I did make a couple of changes - I used 2 c white sugar, 1 c brown sugar, and 1 c sweetened applesauce (it was what I had); I also used 2 t cinnamon and 1 1/2 t nutmeg for spices, leaving out the cloves; finally, I substituted semisweet mini chocolate chips for the raisins and left out the walnuts.  The recipe made 8.5 dozen mini muffins for me.

I will definitely make this again.  It doesn't taste like a "healthy" version of a recipe at all.  As others said, be warned that these stick if you use paper muffin liners.  The sticking wasn't terrible, but I might try greasing the muffin tin instead next time.

This is a wonderful recipe and so quick.  I left out the nuts and raisins and added a streusel and glaze.  I made muffin top muffins because I bought new pans (ha ha) but they worked well as you can see.  I will use this again for my brunches and just for taking to work.  Wonderful recipe!

The flavour is great but I found they came out quite dense and needed to cook for almost an hour before the middle cooked through. Healthy though so a great no-guilt snack.

Next time I make these I will use less sugar. A little too sweet for my taste. Also substituted sliced almonds for the walnuts and cranberries for the raisin which helped to balance some of the sweetness.

I have to bring healthy snacks to my son's class every week.  I made this recipe today.  I made it according to the recipe and it is delicious!!  The papers were not hard to get off.  I am not a huge pumpkin fan nor do I like raisins, but this is so good.  I am bummed that I had to take the rest to my son's school. I will have to make them again this weekend! YUM!

These muffins are yummy.  At first I was a little disappointed because they flavor wasn't as rich as I was expecting, but then I realized that they are muffins, not cupcakes.  The only thing I did differently was split the sugar into 2 cups of white sugar and 2 cups of brown sugar. They have a delicious, more subtle, pumpkin flavor that goes great with a warm cup of coffee!

Very tasty! I made this with half whole wheat flour and half white, egg whites instead of eggs, and a little less sugar than it called for. It's so healthy! The only problem is that they stuck to the muffin cups, so I'll grease the muffin pan and put the batter right in there next time.

My kids and I loved these delicious muffins.  I am not a fan of cooked raisins, so I took someone's advice and switched out the raisins for chocolate chips and they were a huge hit!  This will remain in my recipe box for sure!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! I admit I modified it just a bit... I made half a batch,.I used the sugar / splenda combination, added 3/4 t of ginger since I really love that spice, and 1 t of molasses, because I always use molasses with pumpkin..  these are fantastic. I should have made a whole batch! Thanks for a great recipe!

Thanks for sharing, these were really great! :) I had a pumpkin craving and decided to try this out since it seemed to have a lot of good reviews. My only changes were that I omitted the raisins and walnuts (I'm not so much a fan of them).  I also put semi-sweet chocolate chips on top, just for looks really.   My coworkers really seemed to like the added chocolate though, so maybe I'll try it next time with some mini-chips added to the batter.  Uploaded a picture too!

WONDERFUL muffins to have on hand.  We make a big batch and add chocolate chips to part of the batch and make a batch just plain pumpkin.  PERFECT snack or on-the-go.  (We totally omit the nuts and raisins and the ingredients list doesn't need to be altered at all.)

I LOVE this recipe. It was a success at work and at home! I did make some changes: I used half whole wheat flour instead of all white flour, used only hald the sugar suggested and omitted the walnuts. I also added a tablespoon of flaxseeds and baked for 25 minutes. Absolutely delicious!!

I am giving these 4 stars because my kids liked them but my own rating would be a 3.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and thought these were ok at best. I used the largest muffin pan that I have (which must be smaller than the recipe intended) and ended up with 54 muffins.  I used liners on the first batch.  Don't!  The muffins are so sticky that the liner just sticks to them and you end up with only the tops being edible.  For the remaining batches, I skipped the liners and greased the pans like the recipe calls for and ended up with better results.  However, I am NOT a fan of the texture of these.  They are super chewy.  They were still somewhat moist, but just don't have that soft, almost crumbly texture that you expect a muffin to have.  If I was going to make these again, it would only be at the request of the kids because these are not for me.

As a runner I'm always looking for energy food and these were perfect! They also make the perfect 3 pm, pick-me up snack at work! For a healthier muffin, I combined half whole wheat and half white flour and added honey instead of sugar.

A new favorite!  I cut the recipe in half and got 48 ample mini-muffins...a full recipe might feed the NFL;)  I reduced the sugar by half (half white, half brown), and used sweetened applesauce.  These are light, moist, and absolutely delicious!

I love pumpkin bread but don't love the amount of fat in most recipes so I tried this one.  I used a homestyle (chunky w/ cinnamon) applesauce that I had on hand.  The muffins came out moist and cake-like, not dry at all.  I will definitely make more this fall!

Really great muffins! I scaled the recipe back to 12, and made some substitutions suggested by others: used Splenda brown sugar, egg substitute, pumpin pie spice and shredded carrots instead of raisins.  They turned out so well, I will definitely be making these again!

Great recipe. I did make a few changes as my son has a wheat intolerance. I used GF flour mix: 2 parts rice flour, 2/3 parts potato starch flour, 1/3 part tapioca flour. I did not have pumpkin on hand just some left over pie filling from Thanksgiving I had frozen. Since I used the pie filling I omitted the spices and sugar. The muffins have a great texture. My son loves them.

This is a great recipe. The only things that I changed was instead of all purpose flour I used whole wheat flour and I halved the white sugar. They raised nicely and were very moist. I also left out the nuts and next time will add chocolate chips. Delicious!!!!

After reading the great reviews this recipe received, I was very disappointed with the way mine came out.  I followed the recipe exactly but the taste was just okay and the texture was too dense for my liking.

Awesomely good. Roni and I both loved them. I used a cup of sugar and 2/3 c. brown sugar and split the flour with wheat and white. This recipe would be good with coconut and craisins also.

These pumkin muffins are delicious!
MODIFICATIONS:
-Whole wheat flour instead of white
-3 cups brown sugar, one cup white sugar
-No walnuts

Next time, I will cut the portion of cloves & nutmeg in half, the muffins were WAY too spicy for me.

Enjoy! Replacing some of the ingredients makes it a healthy snack. Enjoy it with some apples on the side!

I also cut this recipe in half. I have tweaked it so many times I forgot the original! I use all whole wheat PASTRY flour, extra cinn. & cloves, add some ground flax and sometimes bran. They are so much better for you than most muffins, and they taste so good. An all time favorite.

Very good healthy snack.  My kids loved them!!!  I only used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of maple syrup.  Really trying to make them as healthy as possible.  Also, used whole wheat unprocessed unbleached flour.  Really yummy recipe.  Great tip to soak the raisans.  Don't know why I never thought of that before.  My daughter who supposedly hates raisans loved them in these muffins.  Also, just used nonstick muffin tin instead of paper liners.  Thanks for a great alternative to cake,cookies and whole fat muffins!!!!

Great!  I used 3 cups whole-wheat flour and a mix of whole grain oatmeal and flax seed for the rest.  You could never tell that I didn't use any white flour!  I also cut the sugar by about a cup, but with the chocolate chips I added, I could have cut about another cup out.  I did add extra spices - but might cut down on the cloves next time.  I will make these many more times.

Filling and tasty.  I do like these for breakfast.  I made 1/2 batch with rasins and semi-sweet choc. chips and 1/2 batch with milk choc. chips.  My 2 year old calls them "my muffins" and asks for them all the time. Overall, it is an addictive muffin.  I'm especially excited about how healthy they are, but also yummy!

I won't lie, at first I wasn't pleased. I was looking for light, and airy (cakelike) and a strong pumpkin taste. You can definetly tell that these are "lowfat"-they are much chewier than a regular full fat muffin, and the pumpkin isn't too pronounced. I brought them to work and everyone raved! I kept some at home, and the next day tasted them again---they were delicious! And they really are addicting...I still am blown away! They might not have been what I thought I wanted, but I LOVE them now! I added dark choc. chips, walnuts, and raisins-WOW! I think next time I may add craisens instead of raisens. My husband likes them just with the choc. chips. Forget that they are lowfat-they are just a great muffin! If you are usually a full fat baker, just give them a day-they truly do become an addiction! Thanks for the recipe!

OK, let me just say: I'm not a fan of pumpkin. I've never really liked anything pumpkin, but this recipe was the cure for that!  I tripled this recipe (twice) and had a kitchen overflowing with muffins and breads.  Since I was making this recipe for a group of Little Ladies, I omitted the nuts and inserted chocolate chips.  Yumdidlyicious!  I've only gained 5 pounds from this recipe (I still have some muffins left), I think that earns it five stars!

Great Muffins- they are really good! They're quite filling and pretty low in calories. My roomate who is petrified of diet food would not stop eating them!

Changes I made: I used 2 1/2 cups of Spenda for Baking instead of the Sugar

I added the cream cheese and streusal topping from the recipie on the "Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffins" from this website- using Reduced Fat Cream Cheese of course and splenda. Excellent!

These were fantastic.  I subbed the entire sugar with Splenda and they were still fantastic.  I also used white whole wheat flour and everyone wanted the recipe.  Even those who don't like sugar free things. They never guessed.

I absolutely love these muffins.  Admittedly, I do use some adjustments, but they are not major.  Instead of all-purpose, I use mostly wheat with some oats and all-purpose mixed in.  I also put in raisins and maybe some chocolate chips instead of the nuts.  However, these are very tender and have excellent pumpkin flavor; I will now be making these very often!

Outstanding muffins! I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  I dont care for cloves so, I took the advice of a previous cook and increased the nutmeg and cinnamon...that worked just fine.  We used our "left over" batter and filled mini muffins which took 15 minutes to bake.  They were yummy too.
Thanks very much for sharing such a delicious muffin recipe!

These are great, nice pumpkin taste but not too pumpkiny that someone who doesn't like pumpkin won't eat them.  As with others I used half whole wheat flour and half white, next time I'd use all whole wheat, I used 2.5 cups splenda and 2/3 cup sugar, and it was plenty sweet.  
I forgot to add the walnuts, and I used half raisins and half fresh cranberries chopped, the cranberries are a great contrast to the flavour.  I didn't find them overly heavy, they are the same density of all the muffins I make.

I really like these muffins.  I used 1 C whole wheat flour and 3 3/4 C unbleached flour and I also used 2 C Splenda and 2 C sugar...everything else stayed the same.   Very good.

WONDERFUL!  This makes a huge amount of muffins, but I did not hear any complaints - we all loved them.  Used half whole wheat flour, and will try all whole wheat flour next time.  I also think you could replace the eggs with egg substitute to cut back the fat.

I made these muffins the other night. Instead of raisins, I used cranberries; I also used whole wheat flour and egg beaters to make it more healthy. They were  so moist and soft--absolutely delicious!

This recipe is GREAT! I made a few changes. It doesn't need as much sugar as recipe calls for. I also used equal amounts of whole wheat flour and all purpose flour.After baking, I topped with light cream cheese mixed with pumpkin pie spice.

This recipe is a wonderful blessing to those of us restricted to low fat foods.  Just sweet enough and quite flavorful.  The cloves seem to overpower the other spices, I will reduce cloves and increase cinnamon next time, or just use pumpkin pie spice instead.  Thankyou for such a tasty treat.

Whole family loved these.  Definitely a keeper.  I did not have applesauce, so I used 3/4 cup of light olive oil.  I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour/half regular flour, and just under 3 cups of unpacked brown sugar.    I love the spice profile of these.  The cloves make them!!  I made some with mini chips, some with pecans and some plain.  Love that it makes a big batch.  I froze over a dozen muffins and now my kids can just pop in the microwave for 30 seconds for a quick breakfast.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!!!

I agree, definitely addicting! I made a very small batch, I scaled it to 6 but got 7. Instead of all the spices I just used pumpkin pie seasoning and it worked great. I didn't have apple sauce so I used oil. They were a teeny bit dry but I don't know if it was because I overbaked them or need more liquid. Next time I am going to use apple sauce, skip the raisins and add a crumb top. Definitely great though!

I made a few revisions (4 stars) as well to make them a little healthier--I didn't have applesauce so replaced it with plain greek yogurt.  Half the flour was replaced with ground oatmeal, and sugar was cut in half. They were great and plenty sweet!  Next time I would not use paper liners and just spray muffin tins instead because they are very moist.  Will make again.  Great for breakfast on the go and freeze well.

YUM! I've been making this for a couple years now. 
Only thing to add: Too spicy for some tastes. Think about omitting some of the spice. What I do: take one of the spices down by 1/2 tsp.

Really nice recipe.  I just made these for my son.  I halved the recipe and made 6 large and 12 small muffins.   I cooked them for about 25 min.  Left out the raisins, used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and used allspice rather than cloves.  I think this recipe is very forgiving as I did not measure carefully - came out perfectly!  My son wants me to make them with chocolate chips next.

I made a smaller batch of these and used butter in place of applesauce. I added a streusel topping. They were awesome.

These were amazing!  I've tried several recipes for pumpkin muffins before and this one is the only one that I am super impressed by.  Even my husband (who really doesn't care for pumpkin) and my two year old loved them!  

I did use mostly whole wheat flour and I think next time I will try to sub some of the sugar for artificial sweetner.  Also, I used the "change servings" tool to make 12 but it made more like 16.  I used paper liners and they stuck to them pretty badly; next time I'll just spray the pan.

I cut back the sugar without using any substitute. I left out the walnuts because I didn't have any. The trick to soak the raisins in hot water for 10 minutes before mixing them in was wonderful. The raisins were plump and gooey in these muffins.  The muffins didn't turn out like cake or a dessert. They have a heartier, more wholesome taste and texture. Very good.

These are tasty - the raisins and the nuts add bits of crunch and flavor. However, they are rather dense. I used half regular flour, half whole wheat, and cut the sugar in half (NO more is needed).

I not only loved this recipe but my husband did too. He does not like pumpkin but loved these muffins. The only change I made was I used 1 cup of Flax Seed Meal in place of 1 cup of the flour and I greased my muffin pan with Crisco instead of using paper holders. The muffins were moist and as my husband said, "An unexpected burst of favor." This recipe is a keeper! Thank you for sharing.

These turned out beautifully moist and flavourful.
I made a few changes to the recipe: I used about half & half white and whole wheat flour; only used 2/3 of the sugar it called for; in lieu of nutmeg (which I don't like) used ground ginger and allspice; and in lieu of raisins used chocolate chips, flax seeds and sunflower seeds.

I'll definitely make these again!

I absolutely loved these muffins!  I did make just a couple changes to make them a little healthier.  I used 2 3/4c. spelt flour and 2c. white flour.  I also used 3c. raw sugar and only 1c. white sugar. I didn't put raisins in because my husband doesn't like them and I didn't put in walnuts because I didn't have any.  I will definitely be making these again!

Perfect taste and texture. I used the easy pumpkin pie mix (30 oz) because that is all I could find at the grocery store in the way of canned pumpkin Because the mix is already sweet, I cut the sugar to just a half a cup and prayed that my adjustments would not ruin the muffins and my prayers were answered. They are totally addictive just as the name suggests. They also makek your house smell like fall time. Ahhhhh!!!

Great muffins! They are moist without being soggy (as I have seen others complain about with low fat/ apple sauce based recipes). I cut the sugar in half and they turned out great.

These are seriously my new favorite thing! I didn't use any ground cloves (because I didn't have any) and I added more cinnamon. I also used half splenda half real sugar. Very, very delicious. Thank you.

Wow -- definitely one of the best low-fat muffin recipes I've tried. I did use a sugar substitute for 1/2 the sugar and used egg substitute, too, and they still taste great.

Made this into a Gluten Free delicious snack! This was my first time venturing into the baking world since being told i was allergic to gluten, soy and eggs (i know makes baking almost impossible) but with some rice flour, egg replacers, only 1/2 cup sugar (for 12 muffins) and apple sauce, it turned out fantastic! Still a bit sweet. Need to try and find a sweetener that's not sugar and not artificial.... This was the first yummy snack i've been able to have in a while! Great receipt!

This recipe was so delicious!It was way too sugery though, so I halved it and did half honey and suger instead. It worked out fine, except it did require a little more flour on account of the extra liquid. I think next time I might try all honey, or half brown suger. It is very easy to alter and change this recipe to whatever your preferences are. Deffinitly a keeper!!

I cut this in a third of the original recipe. I used two full eggs, instead of the 1 1/2 the scaled down version called for, used apple pie spice and added a packet of instant apples and cinnamon oatmeal. I also cut the sugar in half. Just cutting this recipe down made 13 medium sized muffins. They smell fantastic. I'll update this review tomorrow as to how the family liked them.
EDITED TO ADD NEXT MORNING: Fabulous. These are the moistest muffins I've had in a LONG time. And the instant oatmeal added a nice touch. I'll make these often.

Wonderful! I didn't add the nuts or raisins, and used 5 c flour instead. Once cooled, I topped with a drizzle of powdered sugar glaze (powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla and milk). Very yummy!

The name speaks for itself! 

My only problem was I used the paper liners and the bottom of the muffins stuck.  Will not use the liners next time.

These are really great. Very easy. I did cut it in half and make about 24 muffins. I didn't add the raisins but put in mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. I have also made them subbing the sugar for Splenda. Thank you!

Fantastic! I made 1/2 recipe and came out perfect. My only complaint is that it's hard to peel the paper cups off. I will try foil cups next time, or just grease the pan.

Maybe I did something wrong but I was not impressed with these, I found them very sticky the next day. I followed recipe and found them quite sweet, maybe give them a 2nd go and cut back on the sugar the 2nd time.

These are great! I slightly modified by using 2c white sugar and 1c brown sugar and they were still very sweet, and also using 2c whole wheat flour, 1c all-purpose, and 1/2 oat bran and they had a nice texture! Does not taste like a bland low-fat food, thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Super moist and just the right amount of spice.  I left out the raisins and walnuts because my boyfriend doesn't care for either and they were still very flavourful.  Will make again!

Super good. I use wheat flour, no nuts, and sometimes dried cranberries. ALSO: You can easily cut the sugar by an entire cup.  Repeat TOO sweet with complete sugar.  This also makes it a bit healthier.  I make it in bread pans for some nice fall loaves.

A great potential recipe, I agree that should increase species a little bit and that´s it!  I use splenda brown sugar for baking and gave it an amazing brown color.  No other changes in the recipe that is simple and healthy by itself.

I'm rating this 5 stars though I was tempted to rate it 4 because I think this recipe has a lot of potential for me...I just didn't get it perfect the first time!  I substituted half the sugar for splenda and used egg beaters.  My muffins didn't seem to want to cook all the way through, though, despite leaving the last batch in for about 25 minutes total!  I ended up with very dense "pumpkin pucks", as I nicknamed them, which tasted good but weren't very attractive.  I think next time I might use fresh pumpkin, add in some carrots (they were slightly too sweet), and add something like flax seed to give the muffin some texture.

Loved this recipe!  I altered it just a bit: added a little extra pumpkin (to finish the can), used half brown sugar half splenda, and used egg whites.  I the consistency was pretty dense but perfect for what I was looking for...almost like pumpkin pie!  sooo good...will definitely make again!

This is a very good pumpkin muffin. I changed some thing to give it fewer calories and worked it out to about 75 calories a muffin. They are a dense muffin, great for breakfast with some eggs and bacon and coffee. My kids love them even my 7 month old. Great recipe. Highle Recommend you try it. Thanks

I made this recipe even lower fat. I used 3/4 cp of Splenda and 1/2 cp of sugar. I also used whole wheat pastry flour mostly.
  I added way more cinammon and walnuts.
It has a very good texture. They came out very moist.

Wow, these muffins are so delicious.  I'm pleasantly surprised, but based on the glowing reviews, maybe I shouldn't be.  I substituted whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar a bit (used Splenda).  I also left out the nuts.  Next time, I'll add some chocolate chips!  Also, using wax paper to line the muffin pans and coating with some non-stick spray makes them very easy to peel off.

The muffins were very good.  I did decrease the amount of cloves, and I used unprocessed sugar for half of what it called for.  The exterior of the muffin was tough--we had to rip them apart.  The inside, though, was yummy!!

Great I made it for thanksgiving but early now my whole family wants more.
I also made it with pecans and chocolate chips so it was gooey on the inside with chocolate I advise this recipe it was also crunchy or crisp on the edges.

Good and easy and very moist. Lower in fat than many similar recipes.  A little too sweet for our tastes, so I will cut the sugar a bit the next time I make them.

I made these yesterday and they are delicious. I didn't have applesauce so I used canola oil...yea, more calories but it's what I had. I also used 2 cups dark chocolate chips in place of the nuts and raisins. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups as was suggested by other reviewers. This is a keeper!

They were decent, made them for my girlfriend at breakfast and she liked them.  I thought they tasted too "healthy" if you know what I mean, but suppose thats the point. Definitly spray your baking cups.

OMG. My muffins turned out so awesome.  I made a couple of small changes.  I dehydrate pumpkin and used 3/4 cup of powdered pumpkin mixed with 3 cups sour cream and 1/2 cup buttermilk rather than the canned pumpkin. and used 3 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  1 1/2 cup applesauce.  No walnuts.  I could live on these muffins they are so good.

I don't know if I'd call this a "lowfat" pumpkin muffin. With 4 cups of white sugar and white flour...this really is a bit deceptive as lowfat. No offense, but I didn't use this recipe. I opted for one that called for brown sugar and coconut flour instead.

These were pretty good but not great.  Flavor wasn't bad just the texture was too spongy for us. I may have over mixed them but thought I just got all incorporated. Do will try them again. 
I did cut sugar a little due to other reviews.
It was alittle too much on cloves for us will cut in 1/2 next time.

Delicious.  I halved the recipe and made 1/2 white/1/2 whole wheat flour substitution.  I also subbed 1/2 white sugar/1/2 Truvia.  The rest of the recipe made to spec.  Came out great.  Made into mini muffins and the pans were quite full.  Baking took about 15-16 minutes.  Made about 48 minis and probably could have gotten about 2-3 more.  Really good and would make again.

DELIICIOSA !!!! I made 2 batches of these-one without chocolate chips and one with. I also cut the sugar down to 2 cups which was DEFINITELY  adequate and eliminated the raisins and walnuts due to lack of.  Even without these, the recipe turned out fabulous, according to my children AND grandchildren. I baked the mini-muffins for 20 minutes.

My son is a PICKY (to the highest degree) eater. But I can't ever keep him away from these muffins. I make them plain (no raisins or nuts, but I add a cup of quinoa for an added health benefit and fiber - and he'd never know the difference! 

A lot of reviews mention changing the ratios or ingredients, but I have always made it exactly as written. And they turn out perfectly! You can always add any kind of fruit (apple, pear, etc.). I added a cup of cooked quinoa and you'd never know it was added. One of my FAVORITE recipes!!

For 12 muffins, we Substituted 3/4cup dates and water (to total 1 cup) instead of sugar.  Blended together with wet ingredients. Only used 1-1/4 cup flour and added 1/4 cup+1tsp of almond meal.  My kids gobbled these up.  Made 24 mini muffins (baked about 20-25min) and 3 regular size muffins.

Wow these are good....with the changes I made.  I used dried cherries in place of raisins and used a mix of 2 c. unbleached flour, 1 c. whole wheat flour, and 1 3/4 c. oat flour in place of all-purpose flour.  Reduced the white sugar to 1 c. and added 1 c. brown sugar.  Reduced salt and nutmeg to 1 tsp. each.  Increased cinnamon to 2 tsp. cinnamon.  Left out the cloves.  Did not put in walnuts, but added 1 c. chocolate chips and 1 c. finely grated carrots.  Made 36 regular size muffins and baked for 22 minutes.

These were pretty good pumpkin muffins. I substituted an equal amount of apple sauce for the sugar in the recipe. They turned out fine, although I would recommend using less apple sauce (maybe 2 cups for the 4 cups of sugar), as the apple flavor overpowered the pumpkin and it was slightly soggy. Also, my muffins were finished in 5 minutes less time than the lower end of the time recommendation. I also made up for the healthy part of these muffins (apple sauce instead of sugar) by making a batch of cream cheese frosting (cream cheese, confectionary sugar, and softened butter).  : )

Yummy - my new favorite.  I cut the recipe in half, cut the sugar to 1-1/4 cups and because I had no walnuts I used sliced almonds.  Very tasty!

I made these muffins for some of my college students and they seemed to love them.  However, I modified the recipe using 1/2 the sugar and two small packets of Stevia; I also used craisins instead of raisins then omitted the nuts.  I did have to reduce the baking time to about 22 minutes, otherwise I think they would've dried out.  However, I think that next time I will combine regular and whole wheat flour and half the recipe--it was a lot of muffins. ***The batter did keep well overnight to bake the second batch.

I made some changes. I scaled down to 12 muffins. 50:50 dark brown sugar to white sugar. I love pumpkin and I grow my own so I roasted & purée it and I used 1 cup of fresh pumpkin. Added 1 tsp vanilla. I used pumpkin spice (since I didn't have ground cloves). Left out the raisins and nuts (I don't care for those in my baked goods) but added cinnamon chips ( this what I add to my pumpkin bread). Added 1/4 cup of whipping cream at the end of blending everything. (Secret to a nice smooth bread). And they turned out great!

Loved Loved Loved these!  I have a daughter with a health issue who requires low fat foods and loves pumpkin so these fit the bill.  I cut the recipe in half and it made 24 muffins.  I also used Organic Sprouted Whole Spelt Flour as it is better tolerated by those with gastroparesis (also apparently wheat sensitive individuals). It makes a little heavier muffin but we like that.  I also left out the raisins and nuts as the girls don't care for them. I also used the full cup of applesauce even though I cut the recipe in half.  They froze fantastic and my girls are asking for more!!

I adore this recipe because it's 1) delicious and 2) flexible. I've made it more times than I can count; come pumpkin season I always make this recipe at least once! I often play around with the spices (more), flours (whole wheat), and mix-ins (I usually don't use the nuts, sometimes add chocolate).  It always turns out great!

I thought these were pretty good. They were a little too sweet and also denser than I care for, but my family enjoyed them.

There isn't nearly enough cinnamon in them and they need some pumpkin pie spice to give them flavor.I halved the recipe and made them with 1/2 cup dark brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white (for 18 muffins). I don't like things particularly sweet and two cups of sugar is way too sweet to be called a muffin. I usually only put 1/4 cup sugar in a dozen muffins and they are just right. Even though I reduced the sugar and used a very moist dark brown sugar, the batter was very dry. I had to add another 1/4 cup of applesauce or so. The other thing I had to adjust was the cooking time. I made a dozen standard muffins and the rest were mini muffins. The mini muffins were done in 15 and the standard in about 18.

I made these yesterday with 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 white and used just a little oil because I didn't have applesauce.  They are so delicious!!  I made 12 and froze 1/2 of them.  Next time I might add a few mini chips too.  Will definitely make again! (one note - I used the servings option on the recipe and changed to 12.  I was surprised when it filled the muffin tins up to the top but it worked)

Really yummy.  Used gluten free flower mix,  organic coconut oil, no applesauce so used a mashed banana, added  3/4 cup chopped walnuts.  They are too sweet for me so next time I will use less sugar and will try other sweetner ideas.  This will be my pumkin muffin recipe now.  Love them.

These were pretty good. I used part wheat flour and a few chocolate chips instead of raisins. Reduced the sugar a bit. It made 48 muffins.

Delicious and super easy! A great classic Fall favorite! The recipe is very versatile for changes and additions too. 

A few changes... I used oil instead of applesauce, because that's what I had, and I also used half wheat flour and half all purpose, as well as splitting the sugar half white and half brown. They turned out delicious! I will definitely make these again! 

For an extra little sweet touch, just sprinkle brown sugar or raw sugar on top after they have baked for about 10 minutes... yum!

These are delicious!  Our whole family loves them.  I use all whole wheat flour instead of white flour and use only half the sugar.  I also leave the nuts out for half the batch so that the kids can take them to school.

This is a great recipe but I did tweak it a bit to make it healthier.  I used all whole wheat flour and substituted 1/2 cup of flour with ground flax seed and another 3/4 of a cup of flour with ground almond meal.  I also used 1 cup less of sugar.  I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 2 1/4  cups of brown sugar in total.  I baked these in muffin top pans for 15-17 minutes.  My husband devoured two immediately!

I think these muffins are awsome.  I used fresh, steamed pumpkin for the pumpkin base and half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I made 12 muffins, and they were eaten within 2 hours.
saved the rest in the freezer for next weekend.

Delicious! I left out 1 cup of sugar (for a total of 3 cups) to make them slightly healthier, and didn't miss it. Also left out the raisins (I'm the only one in my family who likes them, sadly!). They are great, will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe, but should not have since it was so loved!  The only complaint I have is that it is a bit sweet for me, but everyone else did not mind.  Also, I did do half whole wheat flour and left out the nuts.  I always use lining but after reading the reviews that they stuck to the liners I sprayed my pans really well and stuck them straight in.  Only 1 stuck and broke apart.  I kept all the spices the same -they were just right!  Easy and delicious, highly recommended!

I made this recipe once when I had no cloves--loved it.  I then bought cloves to make it again.  WAYYYY too much cloves!  Also, I changed the recipe a little.  I used 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat. I also used Splenda instead of sugar and about 1/2 cup extra applesauce. I will definitely try this again with half the cloves specified.

These are purely addictive! They are moist and have a perfect taste. I made 24 muffins by lowering the amount of ingredients and only did 1 1/4 cup sugar. I also added a Tbsp. of vanilla extract and did 1/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup mashed banana. I didn't use raisins, and was going to use chocolate chips, but forgot. You don't even need them, these things are so amazing, my family always goes for seconds... or thirds :)

Yum! I made these using fresh pumpkin puree and they're delicious and moist - exactly the recipe I was looking for. Aside from cutting the recipe in half, I made a few changes:   1) Used half white/half brown sugar and cut down the amount slightly  2) Didn't have cloves, so instead I grated in about 1 tspn fresh ginger and some extra cinnamon  3) Sprinkled a bit of cinnamon/sugar mixture on top of the muffins before baking   I think next time I'll try dried apples instead of raisins, as I think they'd really complement the flavors well!

I made these exactly as described and they are wonderful!  I made half as regular sized muffins and half as mini muffins and they are all delicious.  I think I prefer the mini muffins, they make perfect snack-sized treats.

These were very good, spicy - and I also left out the nuts. I do, sadly, miss the taste of fat in these muffins! I spread a little butter on the second one, and the taste was just right after I had added those calories back on, of course!

Addictive is right!  My son and I ate 6 between us.  He kept stealing them of the cooling rack when I wasn't looking.  He's a picky eater so this was not necessarily a bad thing!  I made the recipe EXACTLY the way it was posted minus the nuts.

Good flavor and the nuts add some needed texture.  The muffins are a little too moist when sitting around.

I usually make this in mini loaf pans, I find it doesn't bake well as a large loaf, but it comes out great.  I first tried it because I liked that it uses applesauce instead of oil and it has become a favorite.  Every time I make people say how good it is. :)  I usually add just a little more cinnamon and nutmeg and I have found the pumpkin pie spice adds nice flavor too.

These muffins had nice flavor, but I find whenever I bake with applesauce replacing the oil that the final product has a rubbery or spongy texture, although they were much less rubbery the next day.  I replaced half of the sugar with one tsp. of powdered concentrated stevia, and it seemed just the right amount of sweetness.  I will probably make these again.

Super!  Definitely glad I only used 1/2 the sugar like other reviews suggested.  No other changes made.  This recipe makes a lot, so be ready with some loaf pans or something.  My 13 month old daughter loves it also as did the other kids in playgroup along with their mothers.

Exceptional, the only pumpkin muffins that I make now.  The only thing that could add to this is a streusel topping!!
Yummy....thanks for sharing.

My two year old and I love these!  We left out the nuts and raisins and put chocolate chips in instead.  We also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar...next time we'll probably just use 1 cup brown sugar.  All in all!  YUM!

These came out great! I followed some of the tips previous commenters provided. I split the flour between whole wheat and all-purpose and I used a cup of brown sugar instead of all white. Interestingly, I had a hardened block of brown sugar that didn't completely soften. I thought this would be a problem, since I was left with small rock-like chunks in the batter. However, after baking, they melted and turned into crystallized sugar bits that added some nice texture and sweetness.

These were pretty yummy. The first time  I didn't have any cloves, so I didn't add them. It was missing something flavor wise and I thought that was it. The secomd time I  made them I made sure I got the cloves and it made all the difference! I also added about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, it was a great combonation.

These are only a four because they're a little thick and not what I expected but these muffins are still good. I topped the muffins with a cream cheese frosting and that makes them taste 5 stars. I might make these again and play with ing. to see if they won't turn out so dense.

Even family who doesn't like like pumpkin, took home a half dozen muffins. Made 32 for me. My husband doesn't like cloves so if you fall in that category, leave it out. I like it with it.

This recipe is a definite 'keeper'!  No one notices that there is NO butter or oil like in regular muffins.  They're moist & chewy and absolutely 'addictive'!  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and used mini muffin pans and most of the recipe and then froze them in a single layer in ziploc baggies (gallon size). Awesome!

These were pretty good. I would have liked it if the spices had come through a bit more. Next time I will add extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

These muffins are wonderful!  I used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4, but they were still a little too sweet, so I'll cut it back next time.

These are great! I was looking for healthy pumpkin muffins and found these. I substituted 3c Whole Wheat Flour and replaced 3 cups of sugar with Splenda for Baking + 1 cup of brown sugar. Next time I'll reduce the sugar by half- combined with the raisins it was a little too sweet.  Too bad I didn't have any chocolate chips- Next time!

Wow I was skeptical because I made some really nasty applesauce bread this morning, but these are really freaking good!  I also added the chocolate chips because I hate raisins, but they would have been just fine without.  I also didn't have any nuts to put in.  Next time I will make them without chocolate or nuts, they'll be great with coffee!  Super-yum!

Since all the other reviews were good, I must have done something very wrong because my muffins came out terrible. The were very dense and never fully cooked inside even after keeping them in the oven way longer than the recipe suggests. I only used whole wheat flour and put a little more applesauce and less sugar than suggested. I wont try to make them again. : (

The muffin tops look very dry, but they're moist on the inside.  They taste fine for a low-fat, low-sugar muffin.  I used splenda and egg substitute.  Thank you.  I will make again.

This is the most awesome pumpkin muffin recipe!!  I did find it a bit dry so I added more applesauce and yes 2 more eggs plus a cup of shredded apple with the skin on and used whole wheat flour.  It's moist and tender without being the least bit soggy and they are heavenly!!  I will make this again and again!

These were o.k.  They had a funny texture, really sponge like.  The flavour was nice, but I think I could find a better recipe.  They weren't bad, but I probably won't make them again.

Compared to other pumpkin spice muffin recipes I got off the site, this one failed. Since there were so many eggs used, the muffin turned out chewy. I ate half a muffin and tossed the rest.

While the flavor was okay, I wasn't crazy about the super-dense texture.  My toddler son, who'll eat most muffins, turned up his nose at these.  I've yet to try a pumpkin muffin that I loved, and this wasn't better or worse really than others I've tried.

Not what I was expecting.  I'm not sure what it is, maybe too much spice or the texture.  I ended up sending all 26 muffins to work with my husband.  Don't plan on using this recipe again.

Love these muffins!! I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts, just because I hate walnuts. I served them with some honey-butter and they were gone! Thanks for the great recipe. Will be making again and again....

My family ate the whole batch of these within two days!  I substitued Splenda (my husband is diabetic) for the sugar and nobody could tell, even my brother, who claims to hate anything not made with real sugar.  They were very moist and delicious.

Pretty good, a little too much spice for my taste. I added chocolate chips to a few of them to see if it was good and it was great!
