If you cook the cheesecake only an hour - it will NOT work and will run all over. We did this without looking at the other reviews! We had to throw most of it out as it did not set. Also, you NEED to let this COOL at least 24 hours (found this out the hard way too).

What I did when I cooked it the second time - I used a 10 inch springform, I cooked it at the 400 for 20 minutes and then I cooked it at 235 degrees for an 1 hour and 35 minutes and it came out perfect. 

I took everyone's suggestions - I put some toffee in the cheesecake, and saved some chocolate for on TOP of the cheesecake. I had one SMALL crack, and the chocolate hid it, and then I topped with toffee bar bits.

I made this for someone's birthday at work. Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they have ever had and they all told me their birthday's and begged me to make it for theirs. I work with one lady who bakes all the time, and she said she was throwing out her cheesecake recipe and wanted this one. It's sure to please if cooked all the way!!

Second time I've made this & won Grand Prize at Local contest.  Found that these modifications make it a winner.  First layer is too mcuh so use just half the amount of caramel & choc mixture then fold chopped toffee bits into cheesecake mxtr b4 pouring into crust (that way it actually has toffee chunks!). Bake at 425 for 20 mins then 250 for 1 hr+ (total for me was 1hr 10 mins). Use water bath and check center w/inst read therm for 160-165 degrees and will be perfect!!!

Rich and delicious! I posted a photo at the end of the recipe. This cheesecake is a beauty! I used chocolate wafers for the crust and drizzeled 1/3 of the caramel mixture on top prior to topping with toffee bars. I used 3 Skor bars over bottom caramel mixture, 3 bars folded into cream cheese and 3 bars on top. Baked for time allotted in recipe then turned oven off and let cake remain in oven for an additional hour. It came out PERFECT!
* Tips at end of recipe were very   helpful.

TEN STARS! This was the MOST wonderful cheesecake I've ever made, and I make lots of cheesecakes! I followed another reviewers suggestions and some of my own and did the following:  (1) Used a 10inch springform pan (it filled it all the way to the top).  (2) Reserved 1/4 choc-carmel sauce for topping (had to warm it up before drizzling over top).  (3) Mixed about double the amount of toffee chips into the cheesecake batter instead of putting them on top of the choc-carmel sauce layer.  (4) Cooked the entire time at 225 until the internal temp reached 160-165 (If your temp doesn't reach this range, the interior of the cake will be uncooked all the way and will appear sloshy).  (5) You'll have to bake longer than the 1 hour suggested - mine took over 2 hours at this temp. Next time I'll try raising the temp to 250 so I'm not waiting so long. These tips really made a difference.  I also used about double the amount of toffee chips on top of the cheesecake than what the recipe called for.  It is a beautiful cheesecake and the taste is amazing.  Definitely water bath the cake while baking - it really does help. Thanks for a fabulous post! A new family favorite!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  Many even said it was the best cheesecake they have EVER had!  I used a chocolate cookie crumb crust, 8 Skor bars and drizzled melted caramel and melted milk chocolate over the top to make it look 'finished'. I also baked it for 2 hours instead of the one hour that the recipe calls for.  I recommend it be refrigerated for 24 hours before eating and you cut it only when it is extremely cold to avoid crumbling.  Delish!

I took the advice from others and used a 10 in pan.  I also used half the caramel/chocolate mixture on top of the crust and then the remainder on the top of the cheesecake.  I folded some of the crumbles in the cheesecake mixture, but it could have used even more.  Suggestions:  Use more than 2 cups of wafers for the crust if using a 10 inch pan.  Also the back time for me was around a total of 2 hours and it turned out great.  Use as much toffee bar as you can, the more you use the better it will taste.  Overall, it was worth the time and effort.  Everyone loves it.

I used a whole 250g box of vanilla wafers for the crust and exactly 50 caramels for the sauce. And as per reviewers suggestions, 1)I used a larger (9 1/2 inch) springform pan. 2)I used 3 1/2 skor bars instead of 3 and mixed it in the cheesecake batter rather than under it. (I still used pieces from 3 bars for the top though) 3)I put 3/4 of the sauce on the crust and used the other 1/4 for drizzling over the top and sides of the cake. 4)I used a thermometer to get the internal temperature between 160 and 165 degrees and it took 1 hour and 45 minutes at 225 degrees rather than the 1 hour listed in the recipe. It came out perfect in every way and everyone was so impressed they were taking pictures of it. Thanks to Nancy and the reviewers for making this my favorite cheesecake ever.

If I could give this more than five stars, I would.  Oh, my, this was soooo good!  I did take some other people's advice and used only half the chocolate/caramel mixture in the bottom, used a 10" springform pan, and it did take about two hours to bake.  I've also never put a cheesecake in a water bath, but I think it made all the difference.  My hubby liked this so much he actually took a picture of it - don't ask me why.  Anyhow, thank you very much for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Incredible cheesecake, thank you for sharing the recipe Nancy!!!  I took this to an out of balance potluck (there were only 2 entrees a few side dishes and the rest were desserts) yet this dessert went first!! Like others I did make changes: 10 1/2" spring form pan (cuts down cooking time)but the pan was so large I did not do a bath--Ijust put a pan of water underneath and there were NO cracks, put 4 bars in cake mixture-3 on top, put 1/2 carmel/chocolate mixture over crust--half on top with 3 crushed candy bars, and last--I bake it at 350o for a half hour then turned the heat down to 250 to finish for about 1 1/2 hours--cooking it slower reduces the chance of cracks. Simply wonderful!!

Good enough to go on a graham cracker crust with no candy or chocolate if you'd like. I needed to cook for 2 hours at 225 instead of one -- the first one was raw! Also, I also recommend you put the toffee chunks in the batter so it really is "chunk toffee cheesecake"! DELICIOUS!!!

OH WOW this was wonderful!  I did make a few changes though.  First after doing the crust (which I always make by food processoring the cookies then slowly adding the melted better while plusing the cookies) I added about 1/3 or the carmel/chocolate mixture and no scor bars.  I then mixed the packaged pre-chunked scor bar (whole bag) in with the cheesecake mixture.  I cooked in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes and the 250 for another hour and about 15-20 minutes, with a pan of water on the shelf below it.  After it cooled a bit, I put another 1/3 of the carmel/chocolate mixture on top and sprinking some chunked scor bars (these I used the actual candy).  I made it for my husbands birthday and he loved it!  It was a very big cheese cake, it was a little poofed when it came out of the oven, but while it cooled it settled (I add the top carmel/chocolate layer after it settled).  It was a very heavy cheese cake (like it actually weighed a lot).  Very dense, very sweet and very rich.  But Scott loved it!  Thanks for the recipe and for the extra tips I got reading the reviews.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I wouldn't change a thing, the only thing was that it took nearly two hours to bake, rather than the one hour it said in the recipe.  Took it to work for a birthday and everyone raved about it.  If you're going to cheat on your diet, you won't regret a single bite of this dessert!

If this cheesecake was possible to cook in this method, it would be delicious. I followed the recipe exactly accept for mixing the toffee pieces into the cheesecake portion instead of sprinkling it onto the caramel layer. As for the baking portion, following previous reviews, I baked it for 2 hours instead of one, it still did not completely cook all the way through. The center was too soft and slightly runny. The taste, however, was great and I will make it again. The next time I will cook it at a higher temperature. EDIT***Tried this agin, this time I baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour with a jelly roll pan of water on the lower rack and then left it in the oven for another hour. It came out perfect!!

This cheesecake is absolutely awesome!!!  However, like so many of the other reviews said, the center was not even close to set on mine.  Needs a lot more baking time.  Also, I found I had WAY too much to fit into my 9" pan and will use my 10" next time.

This was pretty good, but not awesome.  I would not mix the Heath bits into the actual cheesecake again, didn't feel that you could actually distinguish and enjoy the toffee flavors.  Also, make sure that you push the crust up the side of the pan.  I was thinking it would be attractive to see all the layers, so I only made a bottom crust.  Huge mistake.  I greased the heck out of the pan in preperation for this but I still couldn't get the cheesecake out without mutilating it.  Next time I would definitely make the outter edge crust.

I left off the topping part and still got rave reviews, well worth all the trouble. I made mini (6 inch/cakes) and gave as gifts, have had no less than 9 people ask for recipe. Thanks Nancy...

My husband said it was the best cheesecake I've made.  I used half the choc/caramel on the crust and half on the top like others have suggested and used half light cream cheese and half regular.  I had to cook it longer (until it didn't jiggle in the middle).  The texture of the cheesecake was great - creamy, not dense, but not too soft.  I may be trying topping variations because the cheesecake turned out so well.

This cheesecake is awesome!  Be sure to melt the caramels slowly . . . one time when I made it (too fast I guess) the caramel layer was so hard, the cake wouldn't even cut with a huge, sharp knife.  We had to eat just he cream cheese layer that time, very disappointing.  But when it is done right, there is nothing better!

This was a wonderful cheesecake. Very dense and rich. The chocolate/caramel layer at the bottom is a little too rich for most people. Follow some of the advice and split the mixture. Also made with a oreo crust and it was wonderful!

I took this cheesecake to a work Christmas party and it was an absolute hit.  DELICIOUS!!  I did have to cook it much longer as others did - about 2 hours.  I found the cake was still 'runny' once it was cut - it didn't stop anyone from eating it though!!

This was fabulous! The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars was because of the baking time/temperature issue. IF YOU BAKE THIS CAKE FOR THE TIME/TEMPERATURE STATED, IT WILL NOT BE COOKED THROUGH. I baked mine at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then reduced the heat to 225 and baked for 1 hour and 40 minutes. It came out perfect. I placed a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake, and no cracks! Make sure the internal temperature of your cheesecake reaches between 160 and 165 degrees and you won't encounter any unwanted surprises. I did what other reviewers did and used half of the caramel mixture over the crust and the other half over the top of the cheesecake. This recipe is time consuming, but worth the effort. Also, when making the caramel/chocolate mixture, make sure you melt the caramel SLOWLY or it will become really hard when it sets on the cake.

This was my first ever cheeesecake.  It came out fabulous.  I had to up the bake time.  It was hard to tell when it was done because it was still jiggly.  I made it for a party and it got rave reviews.

I hate to go against the grain here but I was really disappointed with this cheescake.  It was just okay.  The finished product was not worth the time, effort or expense to make.  I took it to a family dinner and there was TONS left over.

This is the absolute best cheesecake I've ever had! Very rich. VERY YUMMY. It did take longer to bake than the recipe calls for, I think I baked it for about 1 1/2 hours after I turned down the oven to 225 degrees.

This cheesecake is the best ever. My daughter made it for a girlscout bake off last winter and won 2nd place in the troop and third place in the county judging.

Then two weeks ago she made it for the county fair (a real big deal here in Ohio) and it won Top Junior Entry ! It was the best of all the youth enteries of any food entered in the fair. My daughter brought home a huge red white and blue ribbon.

The cake is very rich and you can't eat much but it will for sure win ribbons and we can prove it.

Try it and you will never want another cheesecake again. :-)

4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:  1. There was way too much cream cheese mixture to fill the pan. I ended up having up about 1.5 cups extra. Maybe because the chocolate/caramel layer was so thick. 2. The cooking time is really off, and the majority of other reviewers are saying the same. I didn't trust the other reviews and followed the recipe as written. The cake was beautiful with no cracks. However, on cutting, the inside was more the texture of pudding. I believe the cake required at least another 30 minutes of cooking time, if not a full hour as others have suggested. Fortunately, the flavor is so amazing that the entire cake was eaten by family at Thanksgiving even though it was undercooked. Fix the time and it'll get 5 stars!

Made this for my work Christmas party.  Got good reviews, but I thought the layer of caramel/chocolate made the bottom crust too hard.  Mixed toffee chips in with cream cheese mix. like other reviewers suggested.  Saved half of caramel/choc. mix and drizzled on top.

This was the first cheesecake I ever made and it turned out excellent!  I read through the reviews first and took the advice from other people about the oven temperature and size of springform pan.

I took it to a bachleorette party and it was a hit!  One girl said it was the best cheesecake she'd ever had.

Excellent....although I did have a few problems, I think they were due to my errors/modifications.  I used 3 low fat, 1 fat free cream cheese, 5 whole eggs, and substituted fat free evaporated milk for the cream (the last of which I don't think caused the problem).  I saved some of the caramel mixture for drizzling on top (yummy) and used a chocolate graham crust.  Altogether, it tasted fabulous, it just cracked substantially and was mushy in the middle (possibly undercooked, but it was not jiggly when I took it out, it just basically turned into mush in the center when I cut it).  Still, everyone loved it.

Very good--I used the Heath baking toffee pieces instead of the actual candy bars--then used the candy bars for the topping. Mine didn't set up well but I used whole eggs instead of the yolks so that may have ben the problem.

Made this for Thanksgiving & everybody raved!  They all thought it was worth 5+ stars!  Made 4 days ahead of time & froze ... next time will try to serve fresh as toffee chunks turned soft and became indiscernable from the caramel/chocolate layer.  By the way, needs to cook quite a bit longer than recipe states to fully set in the center.

SOOO YUMMY!!! Taste, texture, presentation, all 5 stars!!! It's worth the time and labor, and this is the one and only dish I'll ever make for special occasions.  I made it for the 1st time for my valentine's work party and everyone loved it!!! I only used 3/4 of the choc/caramel mix in the crust, mixed 4 skor bar toffee chunks into the cream cheese as recommended and did the water bath. My oven runs alot HOTTER than most, so I kept a really watchful eye.  Baked at 350F/15 min, then 200F/1 hr, then 225F/30 min and it was perfect w/ light brown top and (hurray!) no cracks!  Cooled 3 hrs and after chilling, I added 4 skor toffee chunks on top and drizzled remaining 1/4 choc/caramel mixture over top and on the edges of the plate. A BEAUTIFUL work of art! Tried to save time by peeling werther's caramels the night before but they ended up melting into a huge blob even in the fridge. Will try 10 inch pan next time b/c it was to the brim. Could not stop myself from snacking on the toffee chunks :-) What a great recipe, and it wouldn't have turned out so well if not for the reviews!

I will definitely try this one again.  I followed the recipe as directed.  The end result was delicious but a bit on the runny side.  Also, the pan seemed to almost overflow!!!  I'd try it in a 10 inch springform next time instead of the 9 inch.  I think it would give it just that little bit of extra room it needed.  Next time, I'd try baking it longer and try the toffee pieces mixed in with the cheesecake.  I'd also drizzle the top with chocolate and caramel to make it even prettier than it was.

You're right...it does take a little time but oh is it worth it!!  I brought it to work today and everyone fussed over it.  It definitely looks like it came from a bakery.  I wasn't sure of the water bath but it worked just fine.  Wait to make sure it has cooled before taking it out of the pan.  Mine cracked a little, though not hindering it's sinfulness!!  Wonderful!!

This tasted excellent! A wonderful cheesecake recipe!  I loved every bite!  The only thing is that it definitely needs to bake longer.  So, if you make it plan on baking for much longer than stated in the recipe.  But overall was wonderful!

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and saved some of the toffee/chocolate sauce for the top. I used a 9 1/2 inch heart shaped pan and it fit perfectly. I used 4 chopped skor bars on the inside layer and 4 more on top. I baked it for an extra 30 minutes at 220. It was awesome!

This came out absolutely delicious... by far the best cheesecake i have made so far! BUT the timing is way off and I had to raise the temperature a bit and bake for much longer. 
One trick, when you turn off the oven, leave the cake in the hot oven in the bath to cool with the oven.. it will cook off a little more.

This cake turned out well, with a few adjustments. 1st, the cook time for me was WAY off. I ended up cooking it for about 95min at 250° after the 15min at 400°. 2nd, I would definitely use a 10in. pan, because with the 9in. it was literally to the brim (which had a lot to do with the lengthened cooking time, I’m sure). Finally, I would highly recommend using only half the chocolate/caramel layer on the bottom. I used only half and after cutting the cake it was about a ½in. layer of the chocolate/caramel mixture and the toffee pieces on the bottom. I used the other half to top the cake. I melted the chocolate and caramel separately, each with a little heavy cream, drizzled them on top and finished it with the toffee pieces. It was impressive looking. Personally, the filling was a bit “cakey” for my taste – I prefer a much creamier cake. I’m actually baking a 2nd one now that I have made with a much creamier filling and some other adjustments because this is too good not to be perfect.

This is the BEST cheesecake I have ever made. I did cook it about 30 minutes longer and left it in the oven while it cooled down. Really reminded me of the ones from the Cheesecake Factory.

This was pretty good.  I mixed the toffee into the batter as suggested by others.  I think next time I make it, I'll skip the caramel layer and instead top it with chocolate ganache and toffee bars.  I think then it will be perfect!

This was delicious!  The caramel layer was gooey, the cheesecake was creamy, and it was all around great!  However, the bake time on it wasn't right.  When I cut into the cheesecake, the middle was not cooked.  So we could only eat the outside.  Next time, I will not turn the oven way down to 225.

Killer cheese cake!   Made it for a special 50th B'day celebration.  It was not an easy cake, because I do not make cakes very often. I did make some changes as suggested by other reviewers--like dividing the caramel (BUT, next time I will only save enough caramel to drizzle over top, because the top caramel layer made it too hard to cut the cake) & using chocolate wafers, also using a 10" pan (using 3c. wafers instead).  Also, changed my cooking time to cook a bit longer.  Did not add the toffee to the cheesecake batter as suggested by many--I like having the smooth cheesecake batter & the layer of toffee. I also made my own caramel sauce (only because I have a fantastic recipe) & yumm....it did the trick on this already killer cake.  Allow yourself 1-2 days ahead to make it--I think it tasted the best the 3rd day.

Awesome! I made this to take to a family gathering for Canadian Thanksgiving, and it received rave reviews. Reading the comments of others was very helpful - I made the recipe in a 10 inch springform pan. I used Oreo cookie crumbs (2 cups), half light cream cheese, and 5 eggs (instead of 4 eggs and two yolks). I put half of the caramel mixture over the baked cookie crumbs and the other half on the top of the cooked cheesecake. I folded 3 crushed Skor bars into the cream cheese batter and sprinkled a fourth crushed bar on top of the cheesecake (over the caramel layer). I baked the cheesecake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes, and at 250 degrees for 1 hour and 35 minutes, with a pan of water on the oven rack below the cheesecake. I did let it cool for 24 hours before adding the saved caramel and crushed Skor bar. This is one cheesecake that you need to leave in the fridge until just before serving; it cuts easier this way. It is indeed very rich so small servings will suffice - especially after a turkey dinner! Thanks for the recipe Nancy and to all the reviewers for great suggestions.

This really good, but very rich!!! I used low fat crm cheese and splenda in place of sugar.
I used chocolate crumbs for crust, I mixed the toffee into the cheese batter instead of sprinkling on top of caramel. I used half the caramel on top of crust and used other half to pour over top after it baked. Sprinkled toffee chunks on top of that. Looked great! Also on baking I did as others suggested. I baked per instructions (including the water bath), then turned off oven and let cake sit another hour in oven. It was PERFECT! Let sit in fridge about 24 hours and it cuts nicely!
EVERYONE LOVED this and no one could tell I cut some calorie corners!

The bottom layer was too thick & gooy because of the carmels.  It was difficult to cut.

This cheesecake has a 3/4" thick layer of chocolate-caramel on the bottom, so nobody will be able to accuse you of skimping on the good stuff.  It was the first cheesecake I've ever made, and my husband said it was the best he'd ever eaten!  Now, that's one good recipe!

Holy , this was soooo good. I used the recommended changes (mixed toffee into the cheesecake batter, used crushed oreos for the crust, and baked for two hours) and truly this may be the best thing I've ever eaten. I may try a different candy bar next time- perhaps butterfinger to try and mimick the Cheesecake Factory's Adam's PB Cup variety.

Thanks to all the helpful hints the cheesecake was met with rave reviews and many requests.  I used 3 cups of vanilla wafer crumbs and 9 tablespoons of butter, and used 9 total toffee bars - 3 sprinkled over the chocolate, 3 in the cheesecake and 3 on top.  Very rich but that didn't stop my friends from cleaning the plate.  The instant read thermometer allows you to get the consistency just right.

Excellent cheesecake! However, at least for me, the baking time was off. My middle was a little goopy and my oven is pretty accurate. I think I'll just have to bake it longer. Still, everyone raved about it that tried it at Thanksgiving dinner!

This cheesecake is absolutely amazing.  I don't personally do sugar, so i made a sugar free/ crustless cheesecake and it was still the best cheesecake i have ever made.  My modifications: substituted splenda for sugar, used russell stover sugar free toffee- also used the caramels melted on top of the cheesecake, did not add the white flour.  Like the others, I added my toffee chunks into the batter.  Just WOW- yummy and beautiful!

This was delicious.  I followed the AllRecipes tips for making cheesecake (putting in a pan with water and towel).  I did not use a spring foam pan - I used a glass one and it worked out fine.  The only downside is that you can't eat a lot of this because it is so fattening!

I read all the reviews and cooked this in a 9.5" springform pan for 20 @ 400 and 1:45 at 225.  Turned the oven off and left it for another 1 hr and it still wasn't done.  Will not make again.

I agree with those that the recipe did not work.  You can not cook a cheesecake at 400 at 15 mins, then 225 at 60 mins.

I cooked three for Thanksgiving,and none worked.  The middle 1/3 was no way near done/set up.   And, I didn't do the gooey layer on the crust.  

Maybe the 225 in the recipe is a typo, I don't know.

AMAZING!!!! I took other people's suggestions and added toffee into the cheesecake batter also. When I turned it down 250 it took about 2 hours for it to finally set. DO NOT TAKE OUT AFTER ONE HOUR. After it was done baking I chilled it in the refrigerator and made vanilla and chocolate whipped cream. I did a layer of vanilla whipped cream on top of the cheesecake and piped the chocolate whipped cream around the edges and then shaved chocolate and put it around the center. Finally I made a caramel sauce and put it on the side. Everyone was in love with it!!! They could not stop eating it. I will definitely make again and again!!

Use an 11" pan if you have one, I had quite a bit of extra filling left when using the 9" pan. The crust mixture may need to be increased for an 11" pan however. Also, don't bother buying the toffee in candy bar form, most grocery stores sell toffee chunks in the baking aisle next to the chocolate chips and this saves having to chop up the candy bars. Just make sure you buy the chocolate & toffee mixture, not just the toffee chunks. I bought 2 bags and had enough left after adding some in the filling itself, to sprinkle over the individual slices when I served them. As other reviewers have said, I also had problems with it being nowhere near done after the suggested cooking time. Use the 160-165 center temp suggestion other reviewers have noted and it'll turn out great. All in all though, this cheesecake was really good and I will make it again.

I have made cheesecake every Thanksgiving for my family and friends and always get rave reviews and requests for more.  My boyfriend said, "this is the worst cheesecake you have ever made."  It has potential, but THIS RECIPE IS INCORRECT. I used a 9" pan, which was too small.  I baked at 400F for 15 min, 225F for 2 HOURS, left the cheesecake in the oven for an hour before refrigerating, and chilled for 24 hours...still with a gooey center.  I was very disappointed.

Made this cheesecake for dinner with friends tonight, haven't tried it yet, but I know it is going to be amazing.  I also used the 10 pan and mixed the toffee bars into the cake.  I cooked at 400 for 15, then 225 for 2 hours.  Low and slow!  It was perfect, no cracks or anything.  Cheesecakes are my favorite thing to make and I say I will def be using this recipe again, probably for Christmas.  Thanks for the perfect recipe!

I have made this probably a dozen times and EVERYONE loves it.  I left out a star because it is not cheap to make and also very time consuming.  I do think it is well worth it though!  One thing I tried to cut down the cooking time tremendously was I made it into a bunch of little cupcakes which really have to be greased first to avoid sticking but pretty much the same concept and only takes about 20 minutes to cook.  It was also loved that way! Also since the whole cake is around 10,000 calories I use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  Tastes just the same.

I just made this for our Thanksgiving dinner...this was a great recipe - 1st time ever to make a cheesecake and it tasted awesome!  Very decadent and major rave reviews (everyone thought it was bought at a specialty store - my husband had to confirm I made it;)!!!

I made it as the recipe stated, but as many suggested, I split the caramel and choc layer between the crust and the top of the cake.  Also, I put water in a pan on the rack below the cake and baked it a 1/2 hour longer at 225.

Everything went fine - no cracks until near the end, but it was no biggie...I think that adds to the cheesecake appearance, but could be covered up w/sauce.  Since this was my first cheesecake, I decided to keep the toffee out of the cheesecake.  I'm happy I did, because the taste and consistency of the cheesecake was perfect (this would be great on its own!).  Although, next time I'll try this variation.

The only problem I had was the same as others - hard to cut cleanly through the caramel.  Next time, I'll probably cut the caramel/chocolate layer portion in half (or thin it), and still put 1/2 on the crust and drizzle the other 1/2 on top. (BTW - if anyone can tell me how to drizzle properly, I'd love to know.  I tried it with a fork and spoon on top, but couldn't get it right (big drops); so I ended up spreading a light layer on top (still have quite a bit in the bowl).

Overall...THANK YOU VERY MUCH for such a wonderful recipe.  Despite the difficulty with the carmel/chocolate layer, i

Phenomenal cheesecake. I made it for my husband's birthday and he keeps on telling me, "Cheesecake doesn't get any better than this." I followed other's suggestions and saved half of the caramel & chocolate for the top of the cake. I read that putting flour in cheesecake gives it more of a cake-like consistency so I omitted that. It required a longer cooking time than in the original recipe, but it was absolutely worth the time and effort. Make the toffee-lovers in your life happy, and try this cake!

This cheesecake is awesome!  I love toffee and I love cheesecake and this makes a great combination.  It is very rich and the texture was perfect.  I do not think I would ever try this one in a 9" pan.  I sed a 10" and it was still a very thick cheesecake.  I could not quit eating this.  I had to cook it longer than the recipe required.  I just kept checking it every few minutes until I felt that it was done.  I will definitely make this one again.

This was awful. It was like eating a bowl of hot fudge. The cheesecake was masked entirely by the caramel/chocolate layers. If you still decide to make it, be sure to halve the caramel/chocolate mixture and then divide that between the top and bottom. Using an Oreo crust was further chocolate overkill, stick with vanilla wafers.

This tasted great but was very messy and did not look great.  The caramel oozed out and caused the crust to break.  I followed other reviewers and put toffee pieces into the batter-- I used 3 bars but I think it needed more to seem like "toffee chunk".  I used chocolate cookies for the crust.  I drizzled extra chocolate sauce on top. I didn't really like the caramel layer either and probably would have liked this just as much without it.

WONDERFUL! I followed others' advice and only put half the carmel/chocolate mixture over the crust. I also doubled the crust and put 4 toffee bars in the cheesecake (it could have used at least two more to really be toffee chunk). For the top I melted half the caramels and 1/4 cup of evaporated milk and drizzled it over. I served it at a potluck and it was the first dessert gone!

Fantastic recipe! It is a bit of work but well worth it. I did make a few small changes. I also mixed the skor bars peices with the filling and saved some of the caramel mixture for a garnish. I only tried a water bath one other time with terrible results, so i just baked it at 400 for 15 minutes and for another hour and a half at 225. It did crack, but i preferred cracked to runny. The reviews were very helpful. Try it, you won't be sorry. Everyone is asking for the recipe!

Great taste but I had a problem with mine firming up in the middle.  I cooked it longer than the recipe required and placed it in the fridge but it never firmed up.  Although it still tasted great.  Next time I'll use more toffee chunks.

Great cheesecake.  I took advise on putting the toffee pieces in the creamcheese and cooked it longer.  It got a 5 star rating at Chrismas dinner.
