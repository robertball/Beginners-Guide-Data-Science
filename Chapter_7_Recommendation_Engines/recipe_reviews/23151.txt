I really enjoyed this.  I mixed up the mayonnaise and sour cream and added the green onions to the dressing and let it sit while the potatoes and eggs cooked.  This infused the green onion flavor into the dressing.  I did add some garlic salt to the dressing.  Next time I would add celery too.  This is a great potato salad for mustard haters.  Thanks for sharing your 'secret'.

This is really good.  Even people who said they did not like potato salad liked this.  I did not use the black olives due to picky eaters.  Be sure and use thick sliced bacon like the directions say.

This is a great recipe! I added some chopped onion and chopped pimientos, and seasoned with a little celery salt. The sour cream adds a unique taste. Not a bite left over! This recipe would get a lot more exposure if it were listed under Potato Salads or Potato Dishes. Thanks Lisa!

We really enjoyed this.  Just a tad bland for our taste so I added some garlic powder and garlic pepper.

Sorry this had texture but no taste, it needs some spices to kick it up a bit, mabey garlic powder and seasoned salt?? if I made it again, I would be sure to add in something to bring out the taste.

Made this over the weekend.  I forgot to add the eggs, but it was good without them.  Used real bacon bits just for convenience and added some of the onion tops for color.  Will make 
again.  Thanks Lisa for sharing your secret!

I would have liked this more without the black olives.  I'll keep those in my pasta salad.

I just tried this and it was delicious! My husband and I will take it to our next potluck! I liked the dressing for something new. I did just as recipe said only adding a seasoning salt to ours but that was all I changed!
