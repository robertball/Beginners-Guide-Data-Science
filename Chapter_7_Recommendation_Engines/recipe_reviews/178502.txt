This was so great. Instead of a regular tomato I used grape tomatoes for their sweetness and only used one can of salmon. Couscous completed the dinner, Thanks!

With the cumin, mustard and hot pepper, I thought this would be hot!  It was a pleasant combination.  We will be making this again soon.  The recipe says that this serves 2, but we fed my whole family with this!

This is such a great recipe! I added red curry paste to raise the heat factor. I served it with curry couscous and put it all in a lettuce wrap with some sour cream and siracha. It's become one of our favorite easy dinners!

I experimented with this recipe and a fillet of Atlantic salmon.  Delicious!  I kept it moist with a tiny bit of plain water in the bottom, and then microwaved the entree.

Awesome recipe! The spices and veggies really help to bring this dish together. The onions give it nice crunch. For the less ambitious, cut the spices you aren't familiar with.

I made it with tuna and my 4 year old thoroughly enjoyed it.

Very easy and quick dish to prepare.  It did not have as much kick as I expected, and actually was a little bit bland.  But overall, great, easy dish for a weeknight meal and a clever use of canned salmon.

It was very bland.  I didn't want to waste my salmon.  So added ingredients to make it a little decent.  I added the following ingredients in small amounts until the dish was acceptable.  I added some Braggs Amino Acids (I don't use traditional soy sauce), ground cumin (the cumin seeds in the recipe are not enough), garlic powder and onion powder.  I probably will not make this recipe again.

I follow everything in the recipe, except I substitute the curry leaves with bay leaves (my other 800 page  vegetarian Indian cookbook says bay leaves can be substituted for those). Wonderful and economical!  Fresh ginger is a must.  Cuts down on the fishy taste and I use the whole large can: bones and all. Bones and skin contain good nutrients. Why dispose them? They are so soft that they get chopped up in the making anyway. Served over basmati rice and garnished with coriander leaves, (and yogurt to cut down the heat, if you want) and home made chutney

The ease and quickness of this dish= dinner on table under 30 minutes. 
I didn't have curry leaves so substituted bay leaves (half the amount) as someone else did. The hot pepper gives it a kick. I didn't notice blandness as others had said (and I am from the Caribbean).
Didn't have fresh cilantro, added a little dry (just because).
Ate it with rice.
Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe, really easy. I added cooked lentils along with the salmon and black and yellow mustard seeds. Delicious.
