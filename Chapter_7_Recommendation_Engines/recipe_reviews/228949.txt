Very good.  I made slight adjustments-added 1/2 tsp vanilla-reduced salt to 1/2 tsp and instead of using 1/2 cup regular white sugar for the crumb topping I used 1/4 cup light brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I would definitely make this again.

VERY GOOD!  It wasn't until I was ready to make the topping that I found I didn't have coconut.  I decided that I would skip the coconut and sprinkle with cinnamon after baking for added flavor.  (I've found that adding it prior to baking, the cinnamon tends to  burn).  When I sliced the strawberries they weren't the best so I bled them with a touch of sugar for sweetness.  As I was putting the strawberries on the batter there wasn't enough to cover it completely so I added a couple more.  I knew from making apple crisp that it is cold butter that you need to use for crumb topping.  For the topping, everything goes into the mixer at once and you use a whisk, mixing it until just prior to it becoming cookie dough.  Pea size crumbs.  Because of adding more strawberries, I baked it an additional 10 minutes.  It was in a glass 8 inch dish so I was able to watch closely that it didn't burn.  While it was cooling, I read some reviews of others adding vanilla.  I really thought I was going to have a problem but not so.  The strawberry flavor was very present and the cinnamon was a nice touch.  We both LOVED IT!  Thank you Sue Walker for sharing your recipe!   I'm sorry for not following it exactly but it was very easy to adjust with what I had.  The sign of a great recipe!

Made this for recipe group. I served this as a dessert after some grilled chicken. Topped it with some strawberry ice cream. OMGosh it was delish! I did leave out the coconut(sorry) but didn't matter. I'm going to try this with other seasonal fruits. It's a keeper!

I went strawberry picking and decided to make this with my freshly picked strawberries. I took the advice of others and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and added the 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. For the crumble I used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. Once it was baked through I removed it from the oven and sprinkled with ground cinnamon (I didn't put it prior to baking so it wouldn't burn). It is delicious!! It was so simple to make and presents wonderful flavor. I love how the cake is moist. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my binder and using it again. I'll be making this next month with fresh picked blueberries and raspberries!!

This a simple and delicious coffee cake. I love the fresh strawberry and sugar crumb topping. I think this would make even better individual muffins than a cake. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Made this for Recipe Group...Very good! I chopped my strawberries, so that it would be easier to cut through and for better distribution. I didn't measure them, so I may have used more than called for. I also followed other reviewers and used 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Very moist and nice strawberry flavor...I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was good and very easy to make.  I felt it could have used more strawberries.  Following recommendations of other reviewers, I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  I will probably try this again.

I used this recipe but instead of a cake I made muffins (cupcake sized), and they turned out wonderfully and were well received by both adults and children at a playgroup.  As suggested by another reviewer I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and reduced the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp. (for my preference I'm not sure reducing the salt was necessary and next time I will try the full tsp.).  The recipe yielded 12 good-sized muffins, baked at 375 (+convection) for about 28 minutes.  thanks for the recipe, will definitely make it again!

Very simple and easy coffee cake to make. Produces a nice moist and dense cake. I preferred the cake cold but it is good warm as well. I omitted the coconut due to food allergy.

First I must admit I used the fruit I had on hand, which was fresh blueberries.  Because I used blueberries, I added a little lemon zest.   Oh boy was this good!  The cake was moist and light, unlike a lot of coffee cakes, which in my opinion are somewhat dry.  The topping set it off nicely, not too sweet, just right.  Can't wait to try it with strawberries.  Thank you Sue for a winner!
UPDATE:  Just made this with a mixture of 'frozen' strawberries, blueberries and blackberries (did not thaw berries before placing on cake batter).  Very good indeed!

Mine did not turn out perfectly but nonetheless was delicious. The recipe is a keeper. Think of warm strawberry shortcake.  Added the vanilla, omitted the coconut as I didn't have it or a suitable substitute, used a brown sugar/white sugar combo for the topping.  Would also be great as a dessert served with whipped cream or ice cream.

Great coffee cake even without the coconut.  We ate part of it that evening and then the next evening had more.  It has begun to get moist and by the third day it was "soup".  Really disappointed me because I had enjoyed it so much.  Sure it was the fresh berries so does anyone have any suggestions to prevent this in the future besides eating the whole thing in 2 days

I ended up with an extremely thick dough like batter and had to thin it out quite a bit. Also, I would recommend using half the salt and unsalted butter, and use vanilla and cinnamon, along with only using brown sugar for the topping. The 9 inch pan was too large and I had to use an 8 inch.

Sooo yummy and easy! Per other reviews I did add 1tsp vanilla, reduced the sugar from 3/4C to 1/2C, and used brown sugar instead of white for the topping, with a few dashes of cinnamon mixed in. I had closer to 2C strawberries and it needed an extra 10 min to get the middle cooked. These would be GREAT as a loaf or muffins!!

Recipe Group Selection:  08, June 2013 ~ I’m a week behind in making the RG’s chosen recipe.  I used a 9” deep dish pie pan for this recipe, and it was a perfect size.  The coffee cake baked right up to the top of the pan without going over.  I used 1 pound of strawberries in this dish and it seemed to be a nice amount.  The texture is nice and moist in this dish.  The cake portion would be very nice mixed with other fruits - blueberries, rhubarb, raspberries, etc.  This was a good selection and one that my family very much enjoyed.

Big Hit for Fellowship Coffee Hour at church. Great seasonal treat. Served warm with whipped cream. Easy to make and I didn't change anything. Not too sweet, baked up nice with strawberry juices slightly oozing, the topping was a nice change too brown sugar topping. I kept it in for 40 min and it was done to perfection.

Okay,  so it's October and my son wants a fresh strawberry cake for his birthday.....here in Michigan, it's not so easy to get fresh strawberries at this time of the year.  With that said....I was so happy to find this recipe. We went out today to get the ingredients for this cake (I have to make it prior to his birthday-just to make sure it's what we want) anyway... We omitted the coconut as it's not a like in this house. Besides that we followed the directions and with cooking it alittle longer then 35 minutes (about 45)...it turned out lovely! My son is loving it, my husband says it's the very best cake ever. So looks like we found a winner for this birthday. I will also be keeping this recipe for when summer comes. It's great. Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe with us.

To my surprise strawberry and coffee flavors go pretty good together. The topping was nice and crunchy, and the coconut flaky and delicious. If you use a baking dish smaller than recommended in the recipe you will most likely have to bake longer to compensate for the cakes depth like I did. A week later I used this recipe as a base for a peach and oatmeal breakfast cake. Yum!

I made this into muffins so I could wrap and freeze some easily for lunches. I used egg substitute of 1T flax/3T water, and white whole wheat flour with good success. They ended up a little dry but I believe I over baked them at 25 minutes. The topping made them appear gooey but when I tested them with a toothpick they were quite done. My fault, but thought I would mention it for reference. As muffins, I only used about half the topping and 2/3 the strawberries. I would fill them a little less next time to get the full 12 servings and more strawberries on each. I do think half the topping was about right for us.

Made for Recipe Group: Excellent coffee cake. I loved the coconut topping; I never would have thought to put it with strawberries, but it worked. I will probably use the topping for muffins also. I think I'll reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp the next time I make it. I thought the amount of strawberries was perfect.

While this is an easy recipe to make, we felt it was just okay for us - we liked it just didn't love it.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  I baked in a deep dish pie plate for 40 minutes, allowed it to cool and then cut into individual wedges.  I sliced the strawberries and used the correct amount of strawberries but feel more would have been better.  I added the coconut but I simply don't understand why it was included in this recipe - maybe just for appearance - so if you don't have any, don't despair. This was the Recipe Group's selection for this week. Thank you sue walker for sharing your recipe.

I doubled and made it in a 9x13.  It takes longer to bake, approximately 45-55 min.  at 350.   I added vanilla to the cake batter, and 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar and cinnamon to the crumble topping.  It was excellent!  Served 15

11 4 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228949/fresh-strawberry-coffee-cake/ ... Well, for me, a three; from E, 20, a thumbs up & had two servings - very unlike him.  I had two cups fresh/frozen berries & not thinly sliced so that could very well be why they sunk.  No big deal.  I'm not "into" m'cake getting wet/moist.  That's one reason why I didn't care for it.  Flavor just wasn't there.  I decreased sugar to 1/2c & added the 1/2t vanilla suggested; maybe more is needed.  I dunno.  'Didn't do it for me.  I sprinkled a tiny bit of red sugar on top since it isn't a beauty either.  :D

I followed the advice of others and reduced salt, added vanilla, made the topping with half white sugar/half brown, and also sprinkled cinnamon on top after cooked.  I made jumbo cupcakes, which were great because each cupcake made a nice single serving. Fresh out of the oven they were amazing!  Great flavor!  However, then next day I had one and it was pretty soggy and I think I put too much topping on them.  Still good, but I found myself picking off some of the mushy topping.  I would likely serve this fresh to others, but not the type of thing to bring to the office the next day for co-workers!

I enjoyed this recipe.  It is simple but tasty.  I do think it reminded me a lot of strawberry shortcake.  The main cake part on the bottom, if you ate it alone, is fairly plain.  But combined with the strawberry layer and the topping, it is wonderful.  We served it warm with whipped topping.

This was delicious! I gave four stars because the crumble topping was a touch too sugary and made my teeth hurt ever so slightly. Next time I make it, I'll probably put a little less sugar in the topping. Other than that, it was perfect!

This was the recipe group selection for June 8, 2013. This  is very nice, but a little too sweet for us.  The coconut in the topping is the perfect touch.

the recipe was okay as written but nothing special. the topping was salty, i think unsalted butter wouldve been better, with maybe a tiny pinch of salt. i used more 1 1/2 cups of strawberries and i still felt like i wasnt tasting eough strawberry. if i make this again i will definitley add vanilla extract and maybe strawberry extract and some lemon zest. slithered almonds and some sort of cheese on top of the strawberries wouldve made this to die for. I'm a huge baker, but all 4 of the guests i had over last night barely finished their slice. i shouldve tried it first.
this recipe would definitely work with any berry.

This makes a really great cake. I times the recipe 1 and 1/2 and baked the cake in a 9x13 pan. I doubled the amount of strawberries and found that it gave the finished product an extra fruity taste. I used a slightly reduced amount of evaporated cane sugar in the bottom layer and organic cane sugar for the top. Also, I used sprouted wheat flour (sifted) because this is the only wheat flour approved for my husband by his nutritionist. Use of this flour gives recipes a more hearty and earthy taste and texture, which sometimes depletes the generally desired aspects of dessert. However, I believe that this recipe actually is better with sprouted wheat flour. Regardless of the flour you use; try this recipe. You won't be disappointed.

This cake is at hit with friends and colleagues.   I love the all white sugar crumb.  Not adding any flavor (e.g. vanilla) to the batter or topping really lets the taste of the strawberries  take center stage.  I prefer to use unsweetened coconut flakes and add about 1/4 tsp. of coconut extract in the crumb -- I felt that sweetened coconut created a topping that was too sweet for  the cake.  Happy baking!!!

My husband and I made this recipe and had a really fun time making it! We altered the recipe a bit; by adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the cake batter, reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp, and adding 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crumble on top.  The cake was a little dry and dense for us, so next time we're going to try to add more than 1/2 cup of milk in, but we loved it! Next time more milk and more strawberries (cause my husband loves them); but overall this was a really great recipe and we will be making this again for sure!

First if all, I am not nuts about fruit in cakes. The yellow cake part is VERY good. Fluffy and moist. The strawberry part tasted like jam to me, which is probably the way it's supposed to taste...good flavor, but not appealing to me. I did use 2 c. berries. Also used brown sugar for topping adding cinnamon after baking. I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to cake per a couple reviews. Would be good with walnuts in place of the coconut. I'm sure my husband will love it, which is the reason I made it

Life changing. I made with 1/2tsp salt and 1/2tsp vanilla - everything else the same. So good! I cannot wait to try this with peaches or raspberries! I did bake it about 40 minutes, I thought the center wasn’t quite done but it was perfect!

I made it exactly to your recipe and it was great!
I experimented using raspberries and dehydrated cherries also, both were great. The only thing I did at the end of the batter mix was I added 1/2 tsp vanilla made a big difference in the cake itself. You might want to try that next time you make it.
                                          Thank You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I added a few extra strawberries and used a little less sugar in the batter, otherwise, I followed the recipe. Make sure you leave it in the oven long enough to cook the center bottom of the cake. It's very moist and great for a breakfast or a dessert!

It was a great cake. I halved the salt and added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon. I skipped the coconut as my daughter doesn't like it, but I do plan to try it with coconut as well.

High Altitude recipe - I live in Denver and I made this cake with fresh strawberries.  To adjust for high altitude I decreased the baking powder and sugar a bit, and added  more strawberries to increase moisture, then baked at  375 for 35 minutes.  I left out the coconut, because I wanted the ripe strawberry taste to come through.  It was moist and delicious and perfectly baked!

It was soooo good! My boyfriend loved it and insisted that I make more in the future. I followed the recipe and used 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced strawberries but we both love strawberries and agreed that it could do with a bit more. Next time I might try adding 2 cups of strawberries instead.

Oh my goodness! This is one of those recipes that seemed to simple to be this good. Easy to throw together. Simple ingredients. Homegrown fresh strawberries are a must. Didn’t change a thing and I am in awe. Better than any berry coffee cake I’ve bought from a bakery. Thanks!

This came out great. I substituted Splenda for sugar and used half a cup of  coconut.  If you thinly slice the strawberries, 1.5 cups equals about 8 ounces. I will definitely make this again.

This is one of my favorite coffee cakes!   It did take about 20 minutes longer to bake than the recipe states and it did fall in the middle (probably because I kept poking it hoping it was done).  I do not understand people who modify the recipe drastically and then give poor reviews.  If you cut the sugar, use water instead of eggs, and whatever else, don't complain when the recipe doesn't come out as expected.  If you follow the instructions and use the ingredients listed and bake it a little longer, you will probably like this coffee cake.

The cake was soft and moist with a lovely crunchy top. The mushy strawberries added a nice contrast to the crunchy top layer and soft bottom layer. I did not have enough butter but had fresh strawberries. So I added 1/4 cup butter and  1/4 cup coconut oil. The coconut oil gave a nice flavor to the cake. 1/2 tsp salt and a dash of vanilla essence .  Also I added only half the quantity of butter to the crumb mix and it came out perfect. It maybe because of the delicious fresh coconut I had. Everyone at home loved it. It was a different but perfect cake.

Made this for anniversary brunch. Loved it!  Would not have thought to put strawberries and coconut together. Phone died on me so I ended up mixing berries with topping. Worked out fine.

I've made this 6 times in the last two days. The first for a coffee cakes were made with fresh raspberries. And the last two were made with fresh rhubarb and raspberry jam. All of them were wonderful! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!

Cake was fine. Crumble as per directions was a bit soggy. For the effort, I would not make again.

I don't know if I did something wrong but the center was a big pool of melted butter that would not bake. After 50 minutes I wound up blotting all the melted butter and baking an additional 15 minutes until the center was finally baked. Needless to say the rest of the cake was dry and over done.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe says minus the coconut because I just don't like it and it bubbled all over the oven. I'm not sure if my pan was too small or what but I am hoping it atleast taste good. Maybe I added too much topping but the recipe didn't say how much so I added all of it.

Batter needed to be thinned out and I would reduce the salt next time. Topping was great with the coconut. Needed to bake an extra five minutes.

It was delish!  Was skeptical about the granulated sugar being the crumb topping since i'm always used to using brown sugar and turns out that was my favorite part!!!  Perfect to make when you have strawberries that are on their way out!

I followed the others advice and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  I also had to increase the cooking time to  about 45 min. instead of 35min. I think that is because of the high altitude.  The cake was very moist.  I will definitely make this again

So simple and delicious... I did double the recipe for a 11X13 pan and added a splash of vanilla and it was perfect.  No one stopped at 1 piece. This will go in my recipe journal and I will also try other fruits.  I bet cherries would be amazing!!

Excellent!  Followed the recipe, with these changes, I added vanilla and instead of sugar I used Splenda or Sucrose (sugar substitute) because of Hubby's type 2 diabetes  .  I think next time I will use slightly less salt.  You can use any fruit you like on top.  The white cake is great and the topping excellent!  This is the first time I tried a recipe without reading the reviews.  So I must go now and read some reviews....always a good idea ;)

The recipe didn't come out good (and the toothpick did come out clean). It came out thick.

Very, very thick.


Both the topping and the actual cake were thick and hard to eat.

This cake was just what I was looking for! I had fresh strawberries and no ideas. I made it exactly as the recipe said, and it was amazing. I will make it again. The fresh fruit keeps it wonderfully moist.

This recipe is very,very good. I did follow the suggestions for substitutions which are not really substitutions (reducing salt and adding vanilla).  I also used white and brown sugar for the topping as suggested. I can say that this came out pretty good. I must admit that I added 2 more tablespoons of butter to the batter and honestly the cake came out perfectly moist. I baked them in a 12 square muffin sheet. They came out beautifully! Will make it again and next time I might add vanilla ice cream or beat some heavy whipping cream!

I made this for Father' Day but only had frozen strawberries.  Did everything as indicated in the recipe and used same amount of berries and it was delicious.  I did however, have to compensate for the extra liquid by cooking it an extra 15 min longer.

Great cake!  I added tsp vanilla but kept the recipe the same. I decided to bake in 8x8 instead and it was perfect. Some reviewers omitted the coconut but I don't recommend it. It was my favourite part!

The ok rating is based on my adjustment of this recipe. I used Splenda to replace the sugar in the cake as well as in the topping because of dietary requirements. My family liked it a lot, even though I did not.

I made this and found it very good. As another reviewer recommended, I did add 2 cups of fresh strawberries and probably would add another 1/2 cup next time. I loved the topping and would probably make a little more next time plus add additional coconut. DO NOT OVER BAKE. I also added only 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp vanilla.

I was looking forward to a coffee cake with a cake-like base and crumbly topping as pictured. The cake part was quite flat and wet and the topping was not at all crumbly. The amount of batter did not seem to be enough for the size pan.  I prepared it as directed, using a 9" square pan as in directions, and then baked a little longer as it seemed to need it. The flavor was OK but I will probably not try it again.

Excellent recipe.  I baked mine in an 8"x8" glassware dish, and had to add 20 minutes to get it to bake through.  It came out tasting more like a cobbler than a coffee cake, but either way, it's DELICIOUS.

This is delicious!! I'm vegan and gluten free so I substituted coconut oil for butter, unsweetened almond milk for the milk, a flaxseed egg (1T ground flaxseed w/ 3T water) and used a gluten-free baking mix. I also added a tsp of vanilla. For the topping I used count sugar, coconut oil and almond meal. All the same measurements as called for in the recipe. WOW. I'm excited to try it with different berries too.

Made it with Xylitol (sugar alt) and brought it to a family gathering. I also doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 glass dish. No one wouldve known the recipe actually called for that much sugar. I put 1 cup of xylitol in the food processor before using a hand mixer to blend with the butter. Added 1 tsp of vanilla and used salted butter and a dash of salt. I also used xylitol for the topping but cut that amount down too. I used cold unsalted butter for the topping. Giving it 5 stars even though I haven't tried the original recipe.

The cake is delicious, but it could be better with  some adjustments like others say: 1. Reduce the salt amount to 1/2 teaspoon. 2.Reduce half the sugar amount in the topping. Very fluffy bottom cake and the coconut topping works well with the strawberry layer.

I was looking for some type of cake that would have strawberries when I came across this recipe. WOW I am so glad I did. I doubled the recipe and cooked in 3 8x8 disposable pans so I could share. It ended up taking about 45 minutes to cook. Delicious!

Followed directions exactly; this is delicious coffee cake! The crust on the bottom is a little thick (not heavy) and touch, but I used a glass pan so that may have had something to do with it. I'll definitely make this again!

Love this recipe!! After I put the tipping on I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top to make more festive. To make them into cupcakes, fill about 2/3 to line batter. Use about 2 to 3 strawberrys for each cupcake top with topping and bake at same temperature for 22 minutes. Poke with tooth pick, if it comes out clean, take out and let cool for 10 minutes enjoy!!!!! :-)

This was so good! Made for church hospitality. It turned out really good using half Splenda and half sugar. I also substituted Smart Balance for most of the butter in the thing with good results. People raved!

This was delicious, even my fussy granddaughter liked it.  Read the other reviews and cut back on the salt.  Also, I added 1 c. sour cream and cut back on the milk to 1/4 c.  I also used half brown sugar and white sugar for topping.

I had a last minute get together with some family friends and needed something easy. This was a huge hit. I didn't have any strawberries but I used raspberries instead and I omitted the coconut in the topping. I also used a muffin pan and they came out looking gourmet! Looked like something from a bakery! I'm very pleased with how simple, but still fresh and home made this was. Will definitely make it again!

Oh my word, what a delicious recipe!  So easy to make even for someone who hasn't baked a cake in a very long time and is also a pretty rubbish cook!!!  I used extra strawberries and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter. I also put less salt and used a stevia and white sugar blend for the batter and brown sugar for the crumble topping as per other reviews. A huge thank you to Sue Walker for sharing.

Awesome recipe. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. And I had blackberries too on hand so I used 1 cup of chopped strawberries and 1/2 cup of blackberries. I made this for my wife for Mother's Day breakfast and she loved it. So simple to make too. Will make it again for sure!

This was delish!!!The flavor of the berries and butter really came through well. The coconut was a nice touch in the topping.I used raspberries as that's what I had on hand. I added vanilla to the batter because I add it to nearly everything.

We loved this recipe, and I followed it to the T except for --> skipping salt 'coz I used salted butter, and chopping the strawberries for an even distribution. I've made this with and without the coconut, both were loved so I can't really say which one was better. And I do add just about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract (I started doing this 'coz the other reviewers mentioned it, and since it was very well received, I never stopped adding it!) Thanx for sharing Sue! 
P.S: I liked Shorecook's tip with respect to making this with strawberries that are less sweet. To quote, she says "When I sliced the strawberries they weren't the best so I bled them with a touch of sugar for sweetness." --> will keep this in mind when we're craving strawberry cake but don't have fresh strawberries on hand! =)

This was out of this world!  My 14-year-old daughter made it and didn't read the directions right used a loaf pan instead of a 9 X 9 it worked out fine although we had to tent it with aluminum foil for 3/4 of the baking time and had to double that to about 60 minutes or until a toothpick came out clean.  As a loaf it was more like pound cake on bottom with a yummy crumbcake/strawberry topping.  VERY tasty!
