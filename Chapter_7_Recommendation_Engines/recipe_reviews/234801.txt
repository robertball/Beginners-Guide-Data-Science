Delicious! The only problem I had was in the cooking directions. The potatoes and cabbage were not done within the given cooking time, so I poured about a quarter cup of chicken broth over it and covered in foil so that the veggies would steam and back in the oven for 10 more minutes. I knew it was a winner when my husband said right away,"This is really good"!

I made this as is( with extra time in the oven and a little added chicken broth), and it was delicious, but we thought the bread was unnecessary. So, the second time I made it in two batches, with two different variations. In the first, I omitted only the bread (but used a mix of traditional and turkey kielbasa, to cut the fat content). My mother and husband are both diabetics, so this cut way down on the carbs (even though I did use whole grain bread the first time I made it). The second variation was much more drastic: I omitted the potatoes, and added 2 cubed sweet potatoes and three (well-scrubbed but not peeled) cubed beets. The beets, as you might imagine gave the dish a reddish-tinge, but all five of us thought both dished were excellent. My parents begged for leftovers and ate them for days!!

Really great, easy dish to make.  I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be flavorful because there wasn't a lot of seasoning in the recipe, but the kielbasa really flavors the whole dish.  It's simple and delicious.  The only modification I made (due to lack of bread in the house) was omitting the bread, and adding buttered breadcrumbs on top.  I also had a problem with the potatoes not being cooked after 45 minutes, but another 10 minutes with foil on did the trick (as another reviewer suggested).  I didn't even need to add any extra broth.  Next time, I'll try cooking lasagna style...covered in foil for the first 30 minutes, and uncovered for the last 15 to crisp it up.

Great base recipe! Delicious as is, or add whatever veggies you have in the kitchen. I made this with leftover Brats from a BBQ the day before and added cauliflower, broccoli, celery, and a little onion to the cabbage and potatoes. Based on previous reviews, before adding the milk/egg mixture I poured about 1/2 cup of chicken broth in and covered with foil before baking. I baked it for 45 minutes, removed the foil and cooked an additional 15 minutes. I live at high altitude and usually have to cook things longer and with additional liquid so this may not have been needed at sea level. Will definitely make again!

Yummy comfort food! Followed the recipe exactly except I did microwave the diced potatoes for about 5 minutes. I used the bagged shredded cabbage so was super quick to put together. I did cover with foil for  the first 30 minutes and uncovered for the last 15...perfect! Will make this again...thank you!

My family truly enjoyed this dish. I added zucchini, yellow squash,  sweet potatoes, onion, and used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of milk. The only problem I had was the same as others have had, the baking time, other than that everything was easy and tasty. I'll be making this again.

I was nervous about this being bland, but I actually really liked it. It tasted like a simple comfort food, meat and potatoes, kind of dish. I added a little extra salt to my bowl, my hubby added a dash of extra pepper to his, but all that was done at the table according to preference, so the recipe itself is pretty good. Don't expect any "wow" sort of flavoring - this isn't a pretentious dish. But it tastes good... and safe. Like I said, its a meat and potatoes comfort food type dish.

 I used 2 med/large russet potatoes (slightly more than 2 cups) and they were diced fairly small (1/4-1/2" dices). Used Hillshire Farms Polska Kielbsa - it was only 13-14oz. No one would have complained over having more sausage in it, but there was enough and it wasn't worth opening another pack just for those few extra ounces.  My store didn't have small heads of cabbage, but even then, I could barely fit 1/2 of a large head in (including all the leaves I removed to line the pan with). I just put in as much as my pan would allow. I baked for 40 minutes with no foil, checked the potatoes and they weren't quite done. covered with foil, as the tops were browning already and some exposed cabbage liners were burning. 15 more minutes with foil on did the trick. 

I will definitely make this again sometime. It was pretty easy and a nice change of pace.

This recipe wasn't good at all. First the time it baked in the oven was not sufficient to get the cabbage done. The bread topping was bland and unnecessary. The taste was very bland and just a waste of my time and ingredients.

This was pretty good!  I cooked the potato cubes in the microwave for six minutes before adding them to the cabbage, and I covered it for the first thirty minutes and then uncovered for the last fifteen.  The cabbage and potatoes were definitely fully cooked, and it was still very moist.  My husband said it was very good.  I served it with cut-up fruit, which I think is better than a cooked vegetable with this, and dinner rolls.

This was very good. I used spicy sausage and instead of salt and pepper I used Cajun seasoning. The whole family thought it was excellent.

Delicious, Quick & Budget Friendly!  I hate to say that I changed anything - but I had to make it Gluten Free so I exchanged the 4 slices of bread for 1/3 cup of GF Progresso Seasoned Bread Crumbs. So-now you can add it to the gluten free category of meals.  It's a great go to for a hearty, weeknight meal...
Num, Num :-)

I grew up in an area with a large Amish and Mennonite population and ate dishes like this often, so I'm a huge fan of this style of old-fashioned cooking. I made this just as directed except that I used turkey kielbasa to cut down the fat and I was low on bread so I used about 1 cup of bread crumbs on top instead of bread cubes. 
This came out great. Remember that dishes like this are supposed to be sort of bland and all you really need is salt & pepper to spice things up. I think you could skip lining the pan with the outer cabbage leaves if you want to, it isn't necessary. Also, while I did enjoy this, I wasn't too crazy about the eggs. I may make this again and use some chicken stock for the liquid, and omit the eggs. Thanks, KelliCooks, for a great recipe that brings back childhood memories!

Awesome recipe and so easy.   I used Italian sausage instead of kielbasa.    Didn’t use bread but put bread crumbs on top.  This is definitely a keeper.   Like others, I covered the dish for the first 30 minutes of cooking and uncovered for the last 15 minutes

I used a bag shredded cabbage, added extra cream, an extra egg, turkey sausage, and it turned out great every time. I left out the bread cause I can't have it. To get my potatoes to cook in one hour I cut them up very small. I've made it multiple times now. Very good!

I enjoy experimenting with ethnic Germanic cooking as that's what I am, and my hubby was stationed there with the Army.  This was my first time making this dish.  It's something different than the other sausage dishes I brew.
I scaled the quantity up by 50% as Craig likes at least one or two lunches for work as leftovers.
I spice heavier with the black pepper.  I also used red potatoes instead of Russets. I really enjoyed the dish. Craig would like me to try it next time by adding ONIONS.

Included a picture right out of the oven.

We  actually really  enjoyed this.  I know how to make cabbage, so I knew how to use it in this recipe.  The outcome was absolutely yummy.   I always like Kielbasa, with  all the veggies in  this recipe.    But I personally really loved this recipe.  There wasnt a morsel leftover, lol.  This  would be such an  easy dish to bring to a party..There's  something that would probably appeal to most ppl.

I doubled the milk and eggs because the bread soaked up most everything. It is a bit bland and next time I may add more pepper (cautiously). Yes, I will make it again because it is a fairly cheap dish. But I will make it in the winter, not on a 100+ degree day like I did today!!!

Very Blah tasting!
I figured out why as soon as I tasted it! Why I didn’t think of this before I made it I don’t know! 
It needs Onion for flavor!
Next time I will use  onions and sauté them and add to this dish!
This should do the trick!

My family, even my super picky eater, loved this recipe!  I didn't change anything.  I cooked it just a little different. I cooked it uncovered at 450 for 25 minutes. Then I covered it in foil for 20 minutes at 425. Lastly I uncovered it for 5 more minutes to make sure the bread topping was crunchy. It adds a nice dimension to the caserole. All the veggies were cooked through. I made sure to dice them thin enough.

Made this using Italian seasoned chicken sausage and a bag of coleslaw mix and it was good!! After reading reviews, I also used foil over the dish for the first 30 mins and then I removed the foil and added some Panko breadcrumbs and dotted it with a bit of butter. The potatoes were done perfectly! (I didn't use the bread that the recipe called for.) I didn't need or use any chicken stock. The eggs and milk was something different, but it really brought the dish together. Hubs liked it too!!

Delicious!! Even the kids enjoyed it! I grew up eating cabbage and noodles, cabbage rolls, kielbasa and peppers, etc. The whole time I made this I thought about my Mother. So simple, I am adding this to my recipe box!

Wanted something different for dinner and the end result was good but will continue tweaking the recipe. I followed the recipe but did add peppers and onions and fire roasted mushrooms. What I found great was that the leftovers and flavors was better on the second day. Does need a few more spices.

Although I love the taste of all the ingredients individually, this recipe is not "creamy", and is rather bland.

Yummy comfort food! I did make a few changes. I added carrots, celery, and a little onion. I started the veggies (minus the cabbage) in the microwave with a cup of chicken broth in order to speed up the cooking process. I will be making this again.

The chopping was worth it. DELICIOUS! I wasn't sure we would like it but all the ingredients come together in a yummy mix. Don't be put off thinking you won't like it. What's not to like about an entire stick of butter, right? I think you could easily only use 1/2 stick  and it would be plenty. Next time that's what I plan to do. There will definitely be a next time. (When I got it all mixed up and put it in the pan I thought, "I sure hope this doesn't spill over into the oven." It didn't. The Hubster ate nearly half of it himself for dinner. There's only enough left for another meal.)

Oh my wow, this is delicious! I basically made it just as the recipe calls. I cooked it covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 10.  I also didn't put potatoes in it because I was too lazy to cut them. I'm sure they would be delicious though. I really liked the bread topping. I never would have thought of doing that.  Yummy!

I should have measured the amount of cabbage I used. I think it was about 2 cups, which seemed like plenty, but was half of the smallest head of cabbage I found at the grocery store. I added a half of a yellow onion, sliced. I think the point of the bread cubes with the egg and milk mixture was to make a bread pudding, but having celiac disease, I omitted the bread cubes. Instead I melted the butter and tossed it with gluten-free panko bread crumbs, spreading that on top about halfway through the cooking time. I baked it at 375 degrees for an hour, total, and everything was nicely cooked. My husband loved it and eagerly packed up the leftovers to take for his lunch tomorrow. I will definitely make this again!

I am used to doing Amish and Mennonite recipes and had forgotten about this one.  I halved it for two of us..but should have used two eggs.  I used potato break and it worked well.  Some of the potatoes and a couple of chunks of cabbage that didn't get shredded as well were crunchy..but most everything was cooked properly..I did add a bit of extra cooking time.

After reading the reviews I decided to just make the recipe as written.  I should have been tipped off by the fact that this is a Mennonite recipe, which means it is very plain and basic.  I served it with Dijon mustard, but even then, it was plain. Next time, I will follow the recommendations of the group and brown the sausage and onions first, use broth instead of milk, and add celery seed.  The bread is a waste of time as others have noted and adds nothing to the dish.  I will cover the dish with foil for the first 45 minutes, and remove it for the last 15, since, as others have noted, the potatoes and cabbage don't really get done in 45.

I followed another reviewers notes and replaced the white potatoes with sweet potatoes.  I also added a sprinkle of caraway seeds.  Good flavor!  I covered the dish with foil while it cools so the cook time was perfect.

My children love Kielbasa, so we loved this recipe. It's a mild flavored dish, but the kielbasa seasoning really shines through with the gentle potatoes and cabbage making it more hearty and warming.

Surprisingly good! My husband had major doubts but went back for seconds right away! Next time will go without the bread topping (a little too bland). And will probably cut the sausage into smaller pieces. Cooked covered in foil for an hour to be sure cabbage and potatoes were done. But will definitely do again. Simple. Easy. Tasty.

I made this tonight for New Year's Day and my family absolutely loved it! It is delicious. I did have to make 2 changes to make sure the potatoes and cabbage were cooked all the way. I put the diced potatoes in the microwave for 6 minutes before I mixed it with the sausage/cabbage mix. After that, I followed the recipe to the letter. After the 45 minutes baking time, the cabbage was still raw. So I took another reviewer's advice and added chicken broth (2 cups) and covered the casserole dish with foil. Then I baked at 400 degrees for another 30 minutes (just to be sure.) I only had to make these changes to make sure every thing was cooked-the actual recipe is perfection. I loved the eggs on top!

It was sort of Bland, even tho I added bell peppers and onions.
Did not have milk, so I used one cup of chicken stock.

This was really good. Even reheated. The only thing I would recommend is using a bigger pan. I didn't use all of the cabbage because I couldn't fit it in the pan, but it would have been better with all of it. I wasn't too sure about the eggs, but I think that was my favorite part. This is a great weeknight meal that is good for leftover lunches.

I made this for my family last night.  We substituted brats for the kielbasa.  I have 7 children at home and they all loved this recipe.  I obviously doubled it but other than the brats made the recipe as written.   It's not often I make something that's a hit with all of them, so this rates 5 stars in my opinion.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
