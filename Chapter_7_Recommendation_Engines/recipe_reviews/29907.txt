First time ever making stuffing and this recipe was great. I did change some stuff. You have to add celery.(Do not put celery seed in.) Make sure that you saute the onions and celery. I did not put walnuts or the orange in. I also put 6 squares of butter on top when it went in the oven. Cook time was about 30-35 min. You have to try it!!!!!!!

I found this recipe because I had some fresh cranberries to use up.  I made it to serve with some baked chicken breasts.  I did a couple things differently.  I used turkey italian sausage and drained that then in the same pan softened the onions and garlic and added some celery (sorry just not dressing to me without it). I don't think the onion, garlic and celery would of been soft enough for me just cooked in the oven for the 25 min. and nothing turns me off more than the crunch of raw onion in something like this.  I left out the celery seed, used pecans in lieu of walnuts and only added some orange zest. This is great and went well with my chicken.

This stuffing recipe is delicious. I left out the orange and walnuts, and used sauteed celery and onion instead of the celery seed. Delicious!

What a great recipe best stuffing I ever had and easy too. I didnt put in the cranberries or walnuts or orange and I sauted onions and celery in a stick of butter instead of celery seed and I added 2 lbs of sausage crumbled and fried up it was a real sausage stuffing that everyone loved I dont have any left!!

LOVE this dressing!  Like other reviewers, I find that this recipe is very versatile, so play with substitutions to make it work for your preferences.  
For example, my family prefers dried cranberries to fresh, and they also like dried tart cherries, currants, and sultanas.  We sometimes sub pecans for walnuts. 

However, I do not modify the spices.  And I think it is essential that you include the fresh orange.  Once, I made the recipe and didn't have an orange, so I used a few tablespoons of oj. The result was okay, but not as interesting as the essence you get from the orange rind's oil.  

My favorite bread for this recipe is multi grain.  Whole wheat is also good, but multi grain provides a better texture.  Although I enjoy white bread for some dressings, I don't think it's very good for this recipe.

This is so yummy! I love the combination of flavors. I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have fresh herbs and my husband doesn't like walnuts but I don't think that altered the flavor much. I really encourage everyone to try this. I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas last year and will be making it again this year

Didn't really like it. Not sweet enough. The cranberries made it really sour. It was too chunky after everything was put together. Probably won't make this again without tweeking it quite a bit.

Made this for a large group so I doubled the recipe. Used 1 lb spicy sausage, 1 lb maple mild to switch up the taste. Added 2 chopped apples, omitted the orange, and tossed in a few currants/raisins & apricots for sweetness. Chopped 2 cu. fresh celery & sauteed 1/2 with the onion. Nice combination!

this recipe was AMAZING until I put in the chicken broth and baked it. It is amazing just mixing all the ingredients (minus broth) together by hand. I will make this again on Christmas. Also, I used spicy sausage and it was a hit.  And, I added celery, raisins and bacon.

It was different.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good either.  I don't think I will make this again.

I loved  the flavor and texture as did all in attendance for  our Thanksgiving meal. .  Everyone raved about the flavor! It was nice and moist also! 
I did add more herb and seasonings because we enjoy a much stronger flavor!

Got many compliments on this for Thanksgiving dinner. Personally thought it was a little too tart. I would probably cut back on the cranberries next time and maybe only use 3-4 oz.
