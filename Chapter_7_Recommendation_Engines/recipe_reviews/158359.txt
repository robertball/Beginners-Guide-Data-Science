I did made a few adjustments to this recipe only for preference. First I used half and half, not whipping cream (trying to watch fat content a bit). I used dijon mustard instead of regular beacuse it's what I had on hand, and added 3 minced garlic cloves and dill weed to the sauce. I also threw in 2 diced roma tomatoes for the last 2 minutes of cooking. I poured the sauce on top of the fish for presentation. It was surprisingly wonderful. Cooked cucumbers can be very strange, but were completely fitting for this dish. I will be making this one again!

My husband loved this fish dish, and he's not much for fish. I did make the cucumbers in sauce a bit different than listed to make it a healthier choice. I used FAT FREE (Yes, they make it) half and half instead of heavy whipping cream; then I added 1/2 cup of fresh diced tomatoes, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp dill weed, and I substituted sweet and spicy mustard instead of the plain mustard. I served the poached fish aside seasoned couscous and topped it with the cucumbers in tarragon sauce; I then topped that with some diced roasted red peppers for appeal. Thank you Dickie, for another way to use up my garden cucumbers.

The flavor was good, but it was too bland.  I was excited when I saw this recipe, because I had all the ingredients on hand.  The cucumbers were interesting, and I did like them, just wish the flavor would have been more intense.

I tried this just as written the first time.  WOW!  No question this is a five star recipe.  The only problem  I've had with it is getting the texture of the cucum- bers right.  That's a matter of practice.  But the taste is wonderful and the preparation is simple.  I would advise using a dry white wine as a sweet white cooks down and can make the fish too sweet  (IMHO).  I've tried this as written and tried it adding dill and garlic (per Bethy).  I liked it both ways. Either way, I like it better with dill tartar sauce  rather than tartar sauce made with sweet relish. Thanks to Bethy for the suggestions and many ,many thanks to Dickie for the recipe.  Fantastic.

Yum, yum, yum!  I followed the recipe except for using Dijon mustard instead of plain mustard.  I also went a little heavy on the tarragon (dried) based on another review indicating that it was a little bland.  We loved the results, and hope you do, too!

We tried this recipe... it sounded good, but it didn't go over well with my family.   We ended up with way too much sauce, and the mix of flavors just didn't seem to blend right for us.   It was okay, but not spectacular, so unless you really like ALL of the ingredients, you might want to be cautious with this one.

This is one of the best recipes for talapia I've tasted. It doesn't overpower the fish, has a nice, light appeal and tastes phenominal. And it's really easy to make.

We used Yellow-eye Alaskan rockfish - I think I overcooked it; next time I would reduce time and remove from heat.  It had a light,  delicate flavor.

Served over rice. Loved the cucumber sauce.  Sauce was delicious on the rice  as well. Fish was very moist.  Would definitely make this again.

I was not able to get halibut, so I substituted haddock.  Apart from that,  I followed the recipe exactly.  The prep was simple, the actual time spent was very short, and the result delicious! 
Be sure to use a firm fleshed fish, or it can easily fall apart during poaching.  I will definitely make this again.

Husband wasn't too sure about this when he saw me poaching the fish, but he absolutely loved it. I made it as written, with one exception. I didn't have tarragon on hand, so I used dried marjoram instead. I think the marjoram is a better choice anyway, as I don't think I'd like the anise tones of tarragon with this dish.  I used a dry white wine, a Feteasca Alba. The type of white wine would make a big difference and this seemed to be a great choice. I The cucumber sauce was so good with just 4 simple ingredients. What a great change up for a fish recipe. I'll definitely be making it again, and I think it's special enough to serve for guests too.

I was afraid that the sauce would be overpowering on this one, but I was very wrong.  The sauce was delicious, but we ended up liking it more on the plain pasta then we did on the fish.  I'd never poached anything before, but it was amazingly easy.

I loved this recipe! It was different than any other fish dish I have made. The combination was refreshing. I used half whipping cream and half milk and it was still yummy! Will make again! :-)
