This cake was too dry.  A cream cheese icing made it better but I still won't make it again.

this cake was a hit, i paired it with a lemon icing and everyone loved it. definitely worth the trouble of seperating out eight eggs! i didn't find it too dry at all. it was delicious!

I'm giving this recipe four stars for flavor, but I would have liked a little more information about what to expect when it's done. Because Carol referenced angel food cake (and because it has 8 egg whites!) I expected it to be lighter and fluffier. But mine came out quite dense, like a pound cake. Perhaps I took too long folding in the egg whites, but the batter was rather dense so it was difficult to incorporate the beaten egg whites. Also, when she says "tube pan," I assumed she meant an angel food cake pan, but I think this cake is more suited to a Bundt pan. Anyway, I needed to use up some egg whites and sour cream so this recipe came in handy. I think the flavor is terrific (I love lemon and almond together!), but the texture is a bit too dense.
