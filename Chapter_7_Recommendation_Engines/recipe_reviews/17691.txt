I took most of the users advice, I used the drained juice in the cake batter and had to add a little water to meet cake mix directions.Also, I used a 11" skillet and it was almost full. My twist was to mix 1 tsp. cinnamon to brown sugar before I spread over the butter and I also added 1/4 cup shredded coconut after I layered the cherries and pineapples. It came out great and my husband could not wait for it to cool! He pleaded for a piece before it had solidified. He said "  babe this is good" his highest rating :). So thanks Anne, hope I can repay you.
-UPDATE 6/17/03
I made this for our family doctor as a thank you for his extraordinary care and compassion, he loved it, wanted to run away with me-hahahha. 
10/02/2005-For gifts, I now use both rings and crushed pineapple and place cherries in each ring and in gaps. Cake is gorgeous this way and each ring is a slice. I bake in two cake pans to make two cakes-one to give and one to keep.11/06-New Twist, we soak the drained crushed AND ring pineapple in RUM, drain and then use. OMG :)

Made this in a 9x13 pan and it came out looking so impressive!  My family said it not only looked better than the ones in the bakery...it tasted a million times better!  I used a yellow cake mix since that's what I had on hand and it was awesome.

Yum!  I used a Duncan Hines Pineapple Surpreme instead of white cake and subbed the juice for the water and OMG.  Make SURE you make it in a cast iron pot.  It makes a BEAUTIFUL cake... and it was wonderful!  My family wants this again already, I just made it 3 days ago!!!

I do not have an iron skillet, so I made it in a regular 9 by 13 cake pan and it was fantastic.

Excellent basic recipe. I did not have an iron skillet so I used a 9x13 baking pan. Instead of sliced pineapples I used crushed pineapples then placed cherries on the pineapples. This was the first time I ever tried to make a pineapple upside down cake and it was great! A lot easier than I thought it would be. 

Thank you for this recipe.

Tips: Daub your pineapple dry or you'll have a semi soggy cake. Daub your cherries dry or you'll have red stain on your cake. Substitute ALL (or as much as you have on hand) water for pineapple juice. Add small pineapple chunks (daubed dry) and a dash of vanilla to your batter. Use salted butter if at all possible. It adds a nice contrast to the heavy sugar. Add a dash of cinnamon atop your brown sugar. And believe it or not, pear halves make an excellent accompaniment to the pineapple rings in this cake. Lastly, use a cast iron skillet if possible. This makes a great subtle crust.

I just made this this morning to bring with me to a picnic after an exercise class.  (Yes, I know, not the healthiest choice for a dessert!)  Each of the ladies took a second helping and asked me for the recipe!  I chopped up the leftover fresh pineapple that I had grilled as a side dish last night in lieu of the canned variety.  Because I did not have any pineapple juice to use in the cake mix, I used half water and half rum (~1/3 cup rum for a total of 2/3 c. liquid).  This added a very nice "adult" flavor.  I used a yellow cake mix and skipped the cherries.  Next time I might add some pecans to the bottom before baking.  Did require about an extra 10-15 minutes to bake.

Wow...this is GREAT!  So easy !  I used a 13 inch Cast Iron skillet, (well seasoned) to prevent sticking.  The cake came out about 2 inches thick. I increased butter to 1-1/4 sticks and used all pineapple juice to substitute the water.  My son and his friends devoured this cake.  Making two, next time.  A keeper for sure.  Thanks Anne.

I made this for a luncheon, and it turned out fabulous.  My mother-in-law called it the best she had ever eaten.  No one would know that it was a mix!  I used a yellow cake mix, like others suggested.  Also, I used a 10 inch iron skillet, but still didn't fit all of the batter in- maybe 3/4.  I also like to use pineapple tidbits instead of rings- more pineapple flavor in each slice.  Thanks!

A ten-inch cast iron pan is NOT big enough.  It overflowed a little and took almost an hour to bake, checking every 10 minutes past the expected 30 minutes.  However, the next day I made in cupcake tins (24) for another event, and they turned out beautiful and were one of the best desserts at the event.  For cupcakes:  Mix the melted butter and brown sugar and cook a few minutes stirring constantly.  Make sure to grease cups well before filling (I used spray/Pam).  Put a little less than 1 TBSP. of brown sugar mix in bottom of well greased cups, place the pineapple slice into the cup so it's evenly mushed in (it will come up the sides a bit), place cherry in middle, fill with batter (3/4ths full).  Bake as directed on box (I switched the pans on the racks halfway through baking).  Let cool 5 minutes (be precise on this or they will stick or be too runny).  Run butter knife around each cup to loosen, place cookie sheet on top of cupcake tin.  Invert, jiggle, and voila.  Use spatula to transfer cupcakes to serving platter.  Use same cookie sheet to invert 2nd pan of cupcakes.

YUM!!!  This was so good and SO easy.  I didn't have a problem with the cake running over but it did stick a bit to the cast iron skillet.  Next time I'll try using no-stick spray.  I made this for my mom's birthday and she and the rest of the family enjoyed it!

My husband requested a pinaeapple upside down cake for his birthday and I was so glad I picked this one.  He told me that it was the best he has ever had (and I am not known for my good cooking).  I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I just used a 9x13 pan and I used a pineapple cake mix instead of white.  Maybe it was all the butter in the topping, but it was a very moist cake.

I had some problems with this recipe. First off, how big of an iron skillet has everyone got!?! Mine is 9" and I had enough cake batter to make nearly a dozen cupcakes after I'd put what I needed into the upside-down cake. I was glad I followed another reviewer's suggestion to put a cookie sheet under the cake while it baked because butter and sugar bubbled up and over the edges and would have been a mess in the oven. When I flipped the cake over onto my platter, there was a crust of still crystalized brown sugar all over the top, it never dissolved, so I think the amount of brown sugar called for is too much (and I only used 1 cup!). The cake mix makes it too sweet also. All in all, it was edible, but I think I'll keep looking.

Followed this to a T, but in an 9x11 pan, I added an additional ring of pineapple and cherry. I can say hang on to your hats ladies and grab a glass of milk. It was very rich with brown sugar sweetness, it will knock your eye balls back a few times. It was delish. I can say I might reduce to 1 cup of brown sugar next go around. But it is very good. And the pineapple flavor totally comes through in the cake mix its self. This was fast and easy to make and can be a great staple in my house.  It's a recipe I'd make again, hands down.

I made this to take to a friend's house for dessert.  It was a HUGE hit!  I had never made a pineapple upside down cake before,but you can bet I'll be making more of them.  I poured some coconut rum over the pineapple slices and let soak a while, then I used the rum/pineapple juice as most of my liquid for the cake; using about 1/4 c. water only.  This cake was moist yet fluffy and the brown sugar made a nice crunchy topping.  I was a little nervous about getting the cake out of my iron skillet, but it popped right out.

I ATE THE WHOLE CAKE MYSELF!!!! 

Just kidding, but I thought about it! I added a bit o cinnamon in the mix like another poster and sprinkled a light layer of coconut on the "bottom/top" with the pineapple rings. I used my trusty 12 inch GRIZWOLD iron skillet. (I love cooking with cast iron, especially cakes and breads, try it too for the BEST cornbread) This recipe is right on! The best Pineapple Upside-Down Cake ever! Now at all of our family get togethers, I'm the go to guy for the "secret recipe"  P/A upside dwn cake! Thank you. I'll add a pic of our next one. Cya, m

Used my grandmothers 11 in iron skillet.
Used some of the pineapple juice with the water.
I also used a Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix.
Baked one hour.  It was consumed in three hours.
Thank you.

I don't have an iron skillet so i used regular cake pan .I followed the recipe exactly, the taste was great but my only problem was the recipe didn't mention to use light brown sugar and i used what i'd dark brown sugar and after took it out of oven and turned it upside down it was really dark not burned ,plus i added a tsp of cinnamon as one of the reviewers mentioned which cause it to be more dark, you need to use light brown sugar for this recipe so the beautiful golden color and arrangement of pineapple rings appear nicely.

This was very good with a few modifications.  Instead of using a whole stick of butter I used 6 TBSP, and only 3/4C sugar instead of the full amount called for.  I used a yellow cake mix, and substituted applesauce for the oil in the recipe (some mixes have low fat modifications right on them).  A 10" cast iron skillet worked perfectly with no overflow.  It did take 45-50 minutes to bake.  What a fun, different cake for my daughters birthday!  We all loved it!

LOVED IT!!!  Delicious recipe!  The only thing that I changed was that I used crushed pineapples and (as other reviewers suggested) I used the juice from the can of pineapples instead of water in the cake mix.  One last thing, I used pineapple flavored cake instead of white cake.  My husband said this was the best dessert I have ever made!

First off let me say that my southern born & bred gramma wouldn't be too happy if she knew I was using this recipe instead of her own. She would be proud tho that this recipe called for a cast iron pan. The southern way to make this cake is in a cast iron pan, just like my gramma made hers. Secondly, this is a FABULOUS pineapple upside down cake. SO good and moist and sorry gramma, SO easy to make! I still use my gramma's recipe but when time is an issue, I use this recipe. I used a yellow cake mix! came out beautiful!

Yummy, yum, yum! Whatever you do, DO NOT forego the cast iron skillet if you can help it. That is without a doubt the secret ingredient, as it makes a crisp and gooey "crust" of the butter and brown sugar that was everyone's favorite part. (In fact, next time I'm going to try one of those iron cornbread skillets that looks like a pre-cut pie so that every slice will have that crust all the way around!) I used only 1c brown sugar because I was scared it would be too sweet, but I'll use all the brown sugar next time. Any kind of pineapple will do (I used chunk), and if you don't like maraschino cherries (like me) or don't have them, just leave them out! I like this cake with yellow cake and used Foxy's "Yellow Cake Made From Scratch" instead of a white cake mix. Thanks SO much, Anne! My dad said it's exactly like his mom used to make, and that's the ultimate compliment!

Awesome! Used pineapple juice to replace some of the water and yellow cake mix. Baked in a 12" iron skillet for 50 minutes.  Turned out perfect!

I have been a member of Allrecipes for 3 years and this is the first recipe that I have ever reviewed, It is FANTASTIC. I am not a fan of PUDCake but this really is good, especially warm from the oven. I think that the secret to taking the box taste awy is mixing well then letting the batter rest to disperse the bubbles. Also bake a little longer than the box says.

Great recipe! First time I attempted a pineapple upside down cake and we loved it!  I am not a great baker, many failed dense baked goods in the past.  I love that it used a box mix (I actually used Pillsbury white funfetti if you can believe it and it was still awesome!) and I did add a touch of coconut extract, just less than 1 teaspoon and it was delicious.  I used all of the reserved juice which was just less than 1 cup so I had to add just a touch of water for the mix. I was worried it would be too pineappley and sweet, but it was  great.  I don't have cast iron, I just used my largest oven safe skillet, no sticking at all.  I did cook it almost 45 minutes, used the toothpick test. Great presentation out of the pan with the dome shape and I flipped it out onto a large platter no problem. The brown sugar kind of carmelized at the bottom edge and was my favorite part, make sure to draw the butter up the sides of the pan and then put the sugar there too.  When I make it next time I'll decrease the butter and probably the brown sugar too, it was almost mushy there was so much so I'm sure we won't miss those calories.  Perhaps if you used a 13x9 pan you would need more to create a nice thick layer though since you have more surface area on the bottom.  Definitely keeping this recipe and at least I know I can do this cake right!

I prepared this exactly how it is written(the only way to rate it I believe) and it turned out perfect!! I will definitely be making it again. It did take longer to bake then what was listed on the cake mix package. It took about 45-50 minutes. Well worth the wait!!

Delicious! I used a 12" skillet and it was perfect for the amt of cake batter and made a nice large cake. Followed recipe as directed except I used yellow cake mix and I also put pecans around the middle pineapple ring and along the edge. Pretty. I think 10 minutes was a bit too long to cool before turning out onto serving platter because the pineapple and sugar stuck, and I had to manually put them back on the cake. Next time I'll try maybe 5 minutes. At any rate it still looked pretty and my MIL said it was the best pineapple upside-down cake she's ever eaten. If I do say so myself, it was delicious! Will definitely make again!!!

One more suggestion to clarify this recipe.  The baking instructions on the cake mix really don't work for this because you are putting a whole cake mix in a 9-inch skillet.  I found it worked to bake at 350 for 35 minutes, then lower the temperature to 325 for ten minutes.  With that adjustment, I had a very good result.  Without lowering the temp, the outside would have over-baked before the center was done. Served this to guests with vanilla ice cream last night and it was delicious and beautiful.  For those that had overflow from a 9-inch skillet, I think it's worth pointing out that the height of the sides/walls of skillets also vary.  Mine was about 2-1/4 inches.  Hope others find this information to be helpful.

What a hit!!!! Made it in a 9X13 pan instead of the castiron.  I also used a yellow cake mix instead of white and used only the pineapple juice instead of water in the cake box instructions. Thanks to all for your suggestions.

I personally am not a big fan of pineapple but I was making Mock Lobster and had to open a can of pineapple. So what the heck! I did not use our cast iron skillet as my husband did not properly season it (again) after using. I used 2 pie pans. I also used 1/2 pineapple juice and 1/2 water (ran low). I didn't have the cherries (but figured it was just for show/fluff). I added vanilla pudding to the cake mix to make sure it wasn't dry to taste. I made 1 with the pineapple and also made one w/o; but the one w/o I used cinnamon-brown sugar butter and then coated it with the brown sugar.... YUMMY

I followed the recipe to the letter with one important difference--instead of pineapples, I used PEACHES. The cake turned out light, airy, not overly sweet and was the perfect way to end my Christmas dinner party.

WARNING! Do NOT use a iron skillet less than 10 inches!!! I had a kitchen disaster when I used an 8 inch skillet. You may say..well...use common sense, but in cas anyone else may only have a smaller skillet beware! I managed to slavage about 1/3 of the cake and after scouping out the pure soup center and finish the outer circle in my toaster oven (on conv. baking for 10 min.(, the remaining cake was very delicious. Next time I will use my larger iron skillet because the taste was quite good!

Good...mmmph...cake. I've made this cake 4-5 times with various cake mixes-- white, yellow, butter -- otherwise, as directed. Always turns out great. So simple yet so satisfying; especially with fresh whipped cream.

After reading the reviews about the cake not fitting, I put the recipe in 2 pans.  I divided the butter & brown sugar into 1/3 and 2/3, and used 8" and 10" skillets.  I cut the rings in half and arranged them 'pinwheel style'.  the batter filled each pan about 2/3 full.  At 350, the small one took 30 minutes, and the large one about 36.  My friend was thrilled to take the small one home!

This was excellent but I made some changes. I had a white cake mix to use up & worried based on others' reviews since so many changed to yellow cake mix; that fear was unfounded because it turned out great with white cake mix. I exchanged ALL the water in the cake for pineapple juice/syrup from one can of pineapple slices and one can of crushed pineapple (which I pressed thru a strainer to get the juice from). I also added two tablespoons melted butter to the cake batter. The baking time took about ten minutes longer.  I increased the butter in the bottom of the pan to one full stick and was generous with my brown sugar measurements too. After all -- it's the bottom layer (that becomes the top part) that everyone loves most. More IS more in that case -- I would have been disappointed if I had used less. I also added about three tablespoons of pineapple juice to the butter and brown sugar mixture in the bottom of the pan. This turned out wonderfully in a 9 x 13 pan with pineapple rings and cherries in the middle. I cannot imagine or even advise trying this in a skillet. WHY? It will go further, cook faster, fit better and look nicer in a 9 x 13. Thanks for the recipe. It'll make for a great dessert tonight when my mom comes for dinner (I had a piece early for quality control purposes only). ;)

I had made yesterday to take to the family 4th of July bbq/pool party.  Its summery, right?!  I didn't feel like pulling out the cast iron skillet and made them in 2  9" round tins.  Worked like a charm!  I ended up using the Dunkin Heinz Butter cake mix and it turned out wonderful.  The few tweaks made - 9" round cake tins, rubbed with a little butter.  Layered as follows: brown sugar, pineapple rings, cherry in each pineapple ring, 1/8 - 1/4 cup coconut flakes (divided between the 2 tins).  I was planning on using the pineapple juice in place of the water for the cake mix, but I spaced on it.  I did add a few tablespoons to the mix afterwards anyway.  I think it helped the cake turn out extra moist, but not soggy.  Plus, it gave it that extra punch of pineapple flavor.  Baked per the cake mix directions, adding about 5-10 extra minutes on the cook time.  When done baking, I let it cool for a few minutes and then turned it out onto a clear glass serving platter.  Looked perfect and tasted fantastic!!  I'll be making another set this weekend for another pool party bbq!  :)

I made two of these for Valentines Day, one for my Dad, one for my Sister.  My mom used to make them for us years ago. It was exactly like hers. It was wonderful and moist, especially because I used the wrong measuring cup and put in a 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/3 like the cake box said. It took about 45 minutes at 350 degrees in my 12 inch Cast Iron Skillet. Great Recipe, Thanks!
*Added on 2-17-07 my Dad and my sister said it was perfect.  My sisters co-workers want the recipe. It was kind of hard for her not to share since I took it up to her workplace.

This was a very good cake.  It took me about 15 minutes longer to bake then what the box called for.  I subsituted apple sauce for the oil and used 1 cup of pineapple juice from the canned pineapples.  I used yellow cake mix also.  I made it in a 8x8" glass dish but should have made it in a 9x13in dish.  So now I have another excuse to make this cake. :)

I had purchased a pineapple that wasn't quite sweet enough, and there was a stray cake mix in the pantry, so I helped my daughter make this cake.  She'd never heard of pineapple upside-down cake, and was skeptical that she would like it! After it was cooled and sliced, she said, "Why haven't we ever made this before?" It doesn't get much easier, and it was the perfect ending to a family pool-side afternoon.  And a perfect way to use up a rather bland pineapple, too!

Great recipe! Will be making this many, many times more! It was a huge hit! I did follow others advice by using PAM to coat the pan and a yellow cake mix. I also soaked the pineapple rings in rum for 1 hour for the "adult" version. Using the drained pineapple juice and water to get the right amount of liquid for the  mix added alot. 
Easy, Pretty and soooo Good. You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I served with fresh whipped cream.

AMAZING! I used a super juicy fresh pinapple, cored, quartered, and cut into 3/8" slices. Then used canned pineapple juice in the mix (I always keep those small cans of pineapple juice in my pantry for adding to glazes). I placed the pineapple slices in concentric circles (fitting in several cherries) and it was beautiful and super juicy with a great pineapple flavor. I highly recomend using fresh fruit in this recipe! I always make desserts to share and this was one of the best received ever. Everyone wanted more...even those who are usually non dessert eaters!******Tried it with canned pineapple, not nearly half as good!

Yum!  Quick, easy, and wonderfully old-fashioned.  I have my grandmother's cast iron skillet; she is 97.  I bet my skillet has seen its share of pineapple upside down cake over the years and this recipe did not disappoint.  I needed to bake about 40 minutes in my oven.  It fluffed up but did not run over.

I made this cake with a twist. I followed the recipe for the first cake and it was a synch and came right out of the cast iron pan and looked great. I did add a teaspoon to the cake batter for a bit more flavor though.  I then put it into the freezer while baking a second cake minus the cherries and pineapple slices. I then put that cake into the freezer as well. I took a quart of vanilla bean ice cream and softened it up a bit. I used a spring pan that was the same size as the cast iron to make a 1” round ice cream filler. I placed the spring pan into a cold deep freezer to harden it back up again. I then took the second cake that was lacking the pineapple slices and cherries and placed it on my cake plate. I then took the ice cream round and put it on top of the cake. Too get the ice cream round freed from the bottom of the spring pan use some warn water in the sink to softened it up. Fill the sink with one inch and set it in it for a few seconds. Put the first layer with the ice cream back into the freezer for 30 minutes. Take the base cake and ice cream back out and place the completed layer with pineapple rings and cherries on top of the base. No need to smooth out the edges too much and put the cake back into the freezer. Make another batch of the brown sugar and butter glaze but bring it to a boil and add some cinnamon. Let it cool for a few minutes, I say about 5 is enough. Take the cake back out of the freezer and pour the glaze over the top of the cake. Place the ca

I don't think you could go wrong with this recipe. It is very forgiving.  I used chunk pineapple, and pineapple cake mix with pineapple juice instead of water. I also sprinkled pecans over the pineapple.  I used a 9x13 pan or a little smaller becaue that's all I have. It turned out great.  It is very pretty when it is turned over.  Looks very impressive.
Everyone loved it.  I may try another cake mix next time, but I will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Moist and tasty.  I used an iron skillet with a 9" base and used up all the batter.  The cake rose over the pan but there was no spill, no mess.  It did take longer to bake than the box instructions, I think it took me about 45 - 50 minutes (toothpick doneness).  And per suggestion I used just 3/4 c. sugar so the sweetness was just right.  Thank you for teaching me this recipe.

Ihave a large iron skillet and doubled the recipe.
Was one of the most popular cakes I have made. So much so I made two in one week and passed on the recipe 5 times.
This is so simple to make. Remember if you double the recipe for a large skillet, double the baking time.

Today was my second time to make this. It is wonderful.  My tweaks: I melt a stick and a half of butter with 1 1/2 cup to 2 cups brown sugar in a sauce pan. Spray cooking spray in my cast iron skillet and then wipe with a paper towel, then pour in brown sugar mixture. I used pineaple rings and crushed pineapple for the topping.  Cool for FIVE minutes, go around with the edge with a butter knife and "perfection"!!!!

The most beautiful cake I've ever made! The cast iron really does add that "special something". I used a pineapple cake mix and juice from the pineapple rings in place of 1 cup of the water. Delicious! My guests loved every bite.

Delicious cake!  Came out better than ones I have made from scratch.  I used a 10 inch cake pan instead of a skillet and it worked beautifully.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really good, i made in a 9 x 13 pan and it came out great. I think i will try a pineapple flavored cake mix the next time to give it even more flavor. Love this recipe.

My MIL gave me a cast iron pan and my son asked for a Pineapple Upside-Down Cake.  With this recipe I could use the pan.  I was afraid the cake was going to overflow from the 10 1/2" pan - but it didn't.  It rose right to the top and flip out of the pan perfectly.  I liked the way the edge of the pan formed a crust-like texture around the cake.  I used crushed pineapple as that is what I had on hand.  I also used all pineapple juice in place of the water in the cake mix.  Nice, delicious and moist - I would make this one again.

well I don't know what it is I did wrong but I used a 13x9 pan like some other reviewers and cooked it for the time the box said (33 min) and the top looked done but it wasn't hardly cooked underneath. I had to wrestle it back in the pan and try to cook it longer. Another 20 min and it still wasn't cooking. Not trying this again. Smelled good though

I made a double batch for a large layer cake for the office.  I used yellow cake mix and the pineapple juice instead of the water called for on the box.  I was a half cup short on the juice so I supplemented it with water.  I also added 1 packge of vanilla instant pudding and 1/2 cup melted butter.  OMG - melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Every crumb was gone!

Didn't care for this.  First time I've made a pineapple upside down cake and may be the last.  I just don't see what the big deal is about it.  I will give it this, it tasted MUCH better the next day.  But I really don't think I'll be making another one.

I felt guilty the entire time I was making this.  My grandma's homemade pineapple upside-down cake is wonderful.  However, after trying this one....it will be the one I always use.  I used a butter-yellow cake mix and had enough pineapple juice to substitute for the entire liquid requirement.  This was wonderful!!! Our trusty skillet is only a 10 1/2 inch, so I had some extra materials for 6 cupcakes.  Wonderful!!

The flavor of this cake was just what I was hoping for. It had great taste and was so easy to make. I used my cast iron skillet and followed directions exactly, the only thing was it took a lot longer to bake that the Box stated, almost 15 minutes longer. I toothpick tested it for doneness and it came out dry to the eye, but apparently even after the 10 minute wait before turning it out, it was still undone in the center. I'd recommend leaving it in until the center is totally set(not jiggly) and then 5 minutes past that.

I did mine in a 9" cake pan. I only made it a single layer, but used 3/4 of the batter. I had to increase the cook time by 18 min. It turned out great!!! 
Next time I think I'll add 1/2 c. coconut flakes, and 1 tabl. coconut extract to the mix. Yummy! Thanks for sharing:)

Wonderful!  I used a yellow cake mix and did need to bake it for about a 1/2 hour longer then the box called for (used a round, deep cake pan).  It is moist and delicious - my husband loves it too.  Thank you.

I have made this twice so far and it has come out perfectly each time, and as delicious as ever! I also used the pineapple juice as others recommended in place of most of the water, and used a 9x13 pan. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly, and each time this cake was devoured quickly!

My DH works in an office full of Marines and I've been "adopted" as their Mom Away from Mom. I love to bake things for Hubs to take to work to share with the guys and Sunday, I made this cake. Hubs took it into work yesterday AM. Two Marines want another for their birthday, the rest of them said anytime I felt like baking something I could put this at the top of the list! Hubs declared this to be "over the top Delicious"!  The cake is moist and utterly gorgeous. Thank you for sharing!!

Awesome! I made this last night for the first time, and it was perfect. I used Yellow cake mix, and instead of using all water in the cake mix, I used all available Pineapple juice from the can and then finished off the remaining balance of liquid with water.   I couldn't fit all of the mix into my large cast iron skillet, so I made a couple of cupcakes too. The cake was flawless, and my husband, son, and his girlfriend and I about consumed the whole thing!

My husband, who doesn't like sweets very much, asked for a pineapple upside down cake yesterday. I had never baked a cake in a cast iron skillet before, and I must say it made the cake AMAZING!!! I made some minor changes, which I think made the cake incredibly moist.  I used a white cake mix, but instead of following the box directions, I added three eggs, 1/2c sour cream, 1/2c vanilla yogurt, 1t vanilla, and 1/2 c veg. oil.  I also added a small amount of pineapple juice (1/4-1/2 cup).  The cake was SUPER moist and delicately browned in the skillet.  It came out of the pan easily, too.  (Hmm...mighta been all that butter!) I used 1 can of sliced pineapple but filled in all remaining space in the skillet with crushed pineapple, skipping the cherries. 
UPDATED (1/1/2015)- I originally wrote that 1.5 cups brown sugar was too much and overpowered the pineapple flavor, leaving behind a gritty texture, but during attempt #2, I tried to lessen the brown sugar (by a lot) the results weren't good.  Way too greasy on top.  So tonight, I used about 1 cup brown sugar (it was whatever I had left in the bag) and let it simmer in the butter a bit to melt it some.  I didn't want it to caramelize because that would turn it rock hard in the end (did that before, too)...so I just kept it simmering for about two minutes.  Maybe this is implied in the original instructions...or maybe more sophisticated bakers know this already. :) But by doing that, it turned out amazing!!!!

I didn't have a skillet, so I used a 9x13 and used yellow cake mix.  Let me tell you, I don't even like pineapple and this cake was FABULOUS!  The friend I made it for had asked for a pineapple upside down cake and said it was better than he even expected.

Excellent! I did follow someone else's idea on letting it cook until it stopped jiggling - that took approximately 20 minutes more.

I had never had a double layer pineapple upside down cake before and this was F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S! I made it for a familyget together and it was a hit.I did not have airon skillet so I used 2 9-inch cake pans. I doubled the butter and used a bit of cooking spray like another cook had suggeted. It released well from the pans with no problems

Very good cake. I put it in a 10 inch iron skillet and it cooked for 65 minutes. I think next time I will try it in a 9x13 to cut down on the cook time and so the top cake part won't get so brown. I used pineapple juice instead of water.

This was so easy and so moist!  I did use Pillsbury's Pineapple cake mix instead of a white cake mix and I substituted all of the water with the pineapple juice from the can of pineapples.  My whole family loved it and comes out of the cast iron skillet so easily and looks beautiful when it's done.  It also does taste wonderful when it's warm!  No one will know that you didn't make it from scratch.

I don't know what it is about a cast iron skillet that takes this cake from ordinary to extraordinary!!!  I used a fresh pineapple and the juice along with fresh cherries.  I also added a half tsp. of cinnamon and nutmeg to the brown sugar.  This cake is a perfect summer treat!

ANNE, IF I COULD GIVE YOU A 10 STAR RATING, I SURELY WOULD. MY HUSBAND MENTIONED HIS MOM MADE THIS TYPE OF CAKE. I SURPRISE HIM WITH IT. OH MY GOSH, WE WERE BOTH IN HEAVEN!!!!! I CHANGED NOTHING, EXCEPT MY CAST IRON IS A GRILL PAN, SO I USED A ROUND 10" CLEAR GLASS BAKING DISH. IT CAME OUT BEAUTIFULLY, AND LIKE I SAID, WAS ABSOLUTELY DEEEEEEEELISH! AND I DISAGREE THAT IT TASTES LIKE BOX CAKE. WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE DESSERT TO SERVE OR TAKE WITH YOU. WE HAD FRESH WHIPPED CREAM ON THE SIDE. THANKS AGAIN ANNE!

Very good! And oh-so-easy to make. It was a little too sweet, though. I used a 10-inch cast iron skillet and didn't use all of the cake mix. I'd suggest only filling halfway, or prepare for it to bubble over. I also used yellow cake instead of white. This looks very nice once it comes out, and still tasted good a couple days after. Still had that crunchy crust on top. Will definitely make again!

YUM! This was great! I used crushed pineapple - wanted tidbits but could not find in heavy syrup. I don't think it would have made a difference...will go for larger tidbits next time, still mixing in some mar. cherry halves.
I used ALMOST all the golden cake batter. Was really concerned when the cake rose way above the edge of 10" skillet, especially when it started to ooze down one side! (Def. use sheet underneath). Not to worry, though. About 15 minutes after box's directions for baking time, it finally cooked all the way through. Once it cooled for about 10 minutes the cake "settled" down to rim level.  A hit with all. Thanks!

I got very nervous while baking this because I used almost all the cake batter and it nearly filled the pan.  About half-way through baking, pineapple juice started to seep over the edges and burn to the bottom of the oven, so a tip for those using 10" cast iron pans: throw a cookie sheet in under the pan or (what I did) make a quick foil drip-pan.  I cooked it an extra 10 minutes, like some other people and it turned out beautifully!  The easiest pineapple upside-down cake ever.

We absolutely loved this cake!  We demolished it in hours.  Tastes alot like my Mom's homemade version, but much easier to make.  I found that the best cake mix to use is Duncan Hines Golden Vanilla when making this cake.  Quick, easy, and very delicious.  Glad I have a heavy skillet, if you you don't have one...buy one.

Great recipe! But make sure you save the juice from the pineapples, pour it into a measuring cup, then add enough water to equal the amount of liquid your cake mix calls for. Also, if you use a pineapple flavored cake mix in place of white or vanilla you will really kick this up a notch flavor-wise! I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I just make this in a 9X13 pan. Delicious!!!

Easy and delicious. In addition to the pineapple rings, I fill the gaps between the rings with canned crushed pineapple. This gives enough leftover pineapple juice to substitute all water for juice. If you can get a pineapple cake mix instead of white cake, even better. This is a regular in my circle of friends.

Fiance and Soon-To-Be Father in Law told me how much they LOVE pineapple Upside-Down Cake, but that they both are "very weird about it and are hard to please because most people simply don't make it right" . . . Made this recipe for them and it has been such a hit!!  At least once a month or so, one of them are begging me to make it to the point that I keep the ingredients for it in the cabinet at all times!!

The only change that I have made to it is including a half of a can or so of crushed pineapple to the mix and substituting the water for pineapple juice from the canned pineapple (as others have suggested).  I was nervous to make the changes because I did not want it to become "too pineappley" but it turned out PERFECT!

I love this recipe because it is easy to make, and tastes great. I use 1 1/2 cans of sliced pineapple and substitute the liquid (water) in the cake recipe with the leftover pineapple juice (I use all the juice of 2 cans for one box cake mix). I also use all of the cherries in the cherry jar. Comes out excellent.

It is SO easy and SO delicious.  I have had requests for the recipe every time I serve it.  I do not use a full 
1 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I like things sweet but I think one cup of brown sugar is plenty.

Way to sweet;and it does not need all that butter either. I followed the instructions exactly except I baked it in a regular pan instead of using a cast iron. It came out looking great.  I might make it again,but  I will use half the butter and probably 1/4 the amount of sugar.

Absolutely perfect!  Typically I do not alter recipes before making as originally written but, I did this time.  I used the pineapple juice for the liquid in the cake mix and added in a touch (1/4c or maybe a little less) of Captain Morgan's spiced rum.  I increased the butter to 1 1/2 c.  This was amazingly delicious!!

This is fantastic and really easy!  I made half this recipe, using a P'bury sugar free yellow cake mix, using a round cake pan instead of a skillet.  Since the boxed mix called for 3 eggs for the whole box, I used 2 for half the box and it turned out just right.  This is a new favorite recipe and one I'll be happy to make and serve again and again!

A nice, simple recipe.  I made this for my host family because the father loves pineapple upside down cake.  This was my first time ever eating it and although they declared it was amazing, I thought it was okay.  Maybe I am just not a pineapple upside down kinda person.

Four stars with changes.  I used a 10" iron skillet.  I feel 1/2 c butter is too much in that size pan.  When I poured in the cake batter the butter came up the sides of the pan.  When eating the cake the exterior of the cake is definitely buttery.  The second time I made it I used half the butter and sugar and was pleased with the results.  You could taste the pineapple & cake and not just butter.  I also placed pecan halves among the pineapple rings & cherries.  Perhaps with a larger size pan the butter & sugar would be spread out and the quantities as written would be fine.

I made this for my husband's birthday. I didn't have white cake mix and used yellow instead and used applesauce instead of oil when I made the cake. I used 1 cup of brown sugar since it seemed like it was going to be too sweet. Other then those changes, the cake was delicious! Didn't miss the extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar that the recipe called for. Added some whipped cream on top when I served it. My nephew went for 3 slices! Refridgerated the leftovers. My husband had some the next day and he said that it tasted better the next day. Planned to make this for turkey day.

This is my husband's favorite cake which I haven't made in years.  I followed these instructions to a tee.  I cooked it for 40 minutes, which I should have cook it for 45 minutes.  I printed the receipe and it didn't have the cook minutes on it, so I guessed. Used an 12" iron skillet and it came out perfect.  Can't wait for my husband to try it.

Amazing cake!  I only had a 10" iron skillet, so I didn't use all of the batter.  I also cut the butter and brown sugar down a little bit because of the smaller pan.  Oh, and I used Classic Yellow Cake, and it turned out perfectly.  Will make again soon!

This was great and moist.  I used a 9x13 glass dish and had to bake for about 40-45 mins.  Used the pineapple juice in place of water in yellow cake mix.  Super easy  =)

This cake is easy and delicious. I made it for a party at my in-laws, and not even a month later, I was asked to make it again for another event. I substituted the water with mango and pineapple juice. It was awesome. This time I'm just going to use the pineapple juice from the canned slices.

Great! I used a 9x13 as other users had, melted the butter in a separate bowl and poured it into the bottom of the 9x13, and followed the rest of the directions accordingly.  The cake did not stick at all to the pan and it slid out right away.  Make sure to flip the cake over when it is still a little warm so it doesn't adhere to the pan and fall apart.  Also, use the pineapple juice in the cake mix. Great!

This cake was excellent...of course I made a few alterations-so it's not exactly fair for me to judge! I used a butter-cake instead of white, I only used one cup of the brown sugar, and instead of cherries, I used fresh strawberries.  I also did as others suggested and used the pineapple juice instead of water. Made it for father's day, and it was an even bigger hit than my fish tacos!! (everyone loves my fish tacos) Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent - this cake turns out perfect every time.  My oven runs hot so I have to turn it down to 325 for about 40 minutes, other than that I follow the recipe exactly. Everyone who tries it loves it :-)

At home we are gluten free, therefore we made the cake with a gluten free cake mix, the only  thing is it took 1 hr to bake and next time I will use 1 cup of brown sugar.  This is a keeper.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

I was a little leary of using the cast iron skillet since I had never heard of such a thing for baking a cake.  However, the cake was very simple to make and just as yummy.  The cake was not as moist as I was expecting, but it was still loved by all.

Disclaimer: Not only have I never made a p-upside cake, I've never even eaten one!  But last week's Desperate Housewives featured one and made me really want to try it.  I don't have a cast iron skillet yet so I used a 9x13 Pyrex.  I didn't make any other changes, except I sprayed olive oil on the glass sides before I put the batter in.  I had to bake it for 45 minutes.  It flipped easily into my cake carrier and tastes delicious!  Very sweet, I might cut down the sugar next time for my own tastes.  The bottom broke a little, it still looks nice but I think it would look fancier in a cast iron.  All and all, a total hit and I can't wait to make it in the cast iron.

Only used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 c brown sugar and that was plenty. Made for Easter desert and everyone loved it.

This cake is dangerous...it is VERY yummy and VERY easy to make.   I made it twice in one week, once for my family to test out and a second time for a women's group where it got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  My husband liked it a lot and wasn't excited to hear I was making it since he said it wasn't a favorite.

This is an awesome recipe.  I use as much juice as possible from the pineapple can as possible in place of the liquid in the cake.  I also use dark brown sugar as it makes the cake look that much more striking.

This is my favorite recipe for pineapple upside down cake. And it's so easy to make. The only thing different I do is I use all the remaining pineapple juice and just add enough liquid for the required cake mix amount. Occasionally I'll use a yellow cake mix. I don't have a cast iron skillet. I use a large thick stainless steel skillet I got from the Princess House collection and it comes out great! Let it cool for 20 minutes, and it doesn't stick to the pan. Everyone loves this recipe and it comes out perfect every time. My daughter just asked me for this recipe. It's a keeper!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was also my first time making it.  I used my mom's old cast iron skittle.  It turned out perfectly.  Before I poured the batter into the skillet I added some chopped pecans along with the pineapples and cherries.  I received rave reviews.  Very easy to make.  Oh, I also used a yellow cake mix batter and just used the pinapple juice for the liquid.  Yummm!!!

Followed the tips to add juice from pineapples to the cake mix, I used betty crockers yellow cake mix. I used my 11" cast iron skillet and it cooked for nearly 45min in my oven.  Make sure the center is fully cooked.  I let it cool for about 12 minutes and inverted it on a large glass tray, it was beautiful.  The cake was very fluffy and moist.  Smelled heavenly, husband loved it!  Thanks for this recipe!

awesome cake! i did, however, "follow the leader" when it came to swapping the white cake for yellow. It was absolutely fabulous! great great great! i was a bit skeptical mostly because i didnt have a skillet so i had to make do with my handy 9x13. but this recipe was written beautifully and simple enough for even me to follow! those of you who thought it was too sweet, please keep in mind this is a DESSERT! it was great!

comes out really pretty but tastes just meh. i used a yellow cake mix for the colour, cut the sugar by more than half (only used 3 oz or so) and cut the butter by half and it was still plenty sweet, so i don't know how it would have been if i had used the full amount. One other thing to note(my own fault here), i didn't have a cast iron pan, so i used a 9" pan, and it ended up taking me almost 70-80 minutes instead of the 30 mins stated on the box. It smelled great while cooking but nothing special otherwise so don't think i'll try it again.

Nice recipe although I did have problem's trying to cut it.  I made using Pilsbury's moist mix and used the pineapple juice in place of the water, used apple sauce instead of oil.  Baked in an Angel cake pan and it looked so yummy.  Removed from the pan without any mishaps but then completely crumbled when I cut in to it.  (not sure if this has anything to do with me using applesauce, although I always use in cakes instead of oil), still tasted good, but not something I could serve to guests.  Oh well maybe I will have better luck next time!

Made this night before last and my husband can't stay out of the refrigerator!!  I used crushed pineapple (3 cans - which provides exactly 1 1/3 cups of juice for the cake mix).  Added a bunch of cherried scattered in the crushed pineapple - used a cast-iron skillet, 12 inch.  I don't even think my old (33 years) husband would share this with ANYONE!!!  Loved the recipe...it's a hit!

I make this in a 9X13 pan and never seem to have the cherries on hand, but that DOESN'T MATTER.  The tastes of this cake is absolutely wonderful.  Whenever I bring it to our monthly potluck, people are always hovering around me as I unveil my contribution and those delicious, buttery, pineapple-y smells start filling the air.  Even as I write this I'm drooling for more!

I made this a few times and everyone LOVES it,it doesn't last more than a day in my home. I made a few changes the second time I made it, I used yellow cake mix instead of white, I added coconut flakes after I put the cherries and I used more pinapple juice instead of water(I even added alittle extra) This is the BEST pineapple upside-down recipe!

Loved it! I made this for a day at home, and the husband, son, and I gobbled it up in only two days! I probably won't make again soon unless I'm taking it somewhere, since I can't afford the added pounds :). It was delicious, and my 2 year old loved helping me make it, so it's EASY. Thanks so much!

Used pineapple cake mix, some of the pineapple juice in place of the some of the water for the mix, and made in a 9x13 pan. My dad loved it for Father's Day! I left it in the pan and turned it onto a platter right before serving. Very pretty and so tasty with the butter/brown sugar. A nice change of pace. Will make again...thanks!

this cake is GREAT!  i just made it last night and it's all gone today - and there are only 4 of us in the house!  i did make some changes to be somewhat more health conscience (is that possible with dessert??).  i decreased the brown sugar 3/4 of a cup.  i also decreased the butter to 1/4 cup.  most cake mixes call for oil and i substituted apple sauce.  did not lose anything in flavour, moistness or fluffiness.    the trick to this one is to mix it thoroughly after the addition of each egg.  give it a 3 minute mix for each egg if need be.  i washed dishes and cleaned the kitchen!  the hardest part of this recipe was getting the cake out of the heavy cast iron pan.  and even that wasn't too bad!  absolutely a keeper recipe!

This cake was so yummy!  My first attempt at a pineapple upside down cake!  The only thing I would change is to use only 1 cup of brown sugar or maybe even 3/4 cup-it was very sweet and we really like sweet in this house!  I also only used 1/4 cup of butter in the bottom of the skillet.  This was gone in two days and there are only 4 of us in the house!  This is a keeper!

Wonderful!  I followed the directions exactly, but forgot to turn on the oven!  The pineapple did stick but it was easy to lift them from the pan to the cake.

I loved this cake and so has everyone I've made it for. I substituted all the pineapple juice I had for the water (had to add some water to get the full amount of liquid the cake called for). The first time I made it, there was way too much batter for my size skillet. After the called-for cook time, my cake was still way too jiggly in the center. I turned the oven to 300 and continued cooking until the center cooked through. That worked! Next time I made it, I poured some of the batter into a 8" cake pan (with brown sugar and pineapples) and made a mini cake for my 11 year old and his friends. Very moist and delicious!

I made this recipe for company one night--it was great!  I actually used less sugar than it called for (1 cup), and everyone talked about how great it was.  More of that cake disappeared than I expected! :-)

My husband and I love this cake.  The only changes I made is using pineapple tidbits instead of slices (I didn't have any slices the first time I made it and have just continued to use the tidbits in subsequent cakes) and I bake it in a 9x13-inch pan.  I also use the juice from the pineapple in the cake mix as suggested by other reviewers.  I have made it several times and it never fails to please!

I used other reviewer recommendations and subbed all the pineapple for water.  I used a butter cake mix, it tasted great.  It had almost to much moisture though from the butter and fruit.  Next time the only change I think I'll make is use a cake mix that doesn't require quite so much liquid as the fruit and brown sugar add more then enough.

This was so easy and I couldn't believe how delish it was!  I used 1 cup of the pineapple juice, replacing some of the water called for on the box recipe.  I also used yellow cake mix.  Melted the unsalted butter in a 9x13 glass dish, sprinkled the brown sugar, and proceeded as directed.  This was really good!

Can we get 6 stars?!?!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was AMAZING!! Part of the beauty of this recipe is the simplicity. It was the single most talked about dessert at TG and there were at least 5 other options! I did what a couple of others did and used the juice from the pineapple slices instead of the water in the cake batter. Also, I didn't have an iron skillet so I made mine in a glass 13x9 dish (it had to cook a little longer than the box directions, but just test with a toothpick). It came out moist and so freakin' yummy I don't know what else to say. Make this recipe!! NOW!!

Great and easy to follow recipe..Only thing I did different was added only 1 cup brown sugar , I reserved the pineapple juice to use in the cake instead of water, and I baked in a cast iron skillet.

This is a great recipe.  I made it in a 13 " cast iron skillet and soaked the pineapple in coconut rum before baking.  I served it with mango ice cream for a Hawaiian party.  It was a hit!!!

This was a great recipe.  I only did a few things differently.  I didn't have a cast iron pan to make this in so I also used a 9x13 glass pan.  I melted the butter and then added the brown sugar into the butter which created a paste.  While the brown sugar was melting, I layered the pan with the pineapple rings - I found I had to open an additional 8 oz can to get a couple more pineapple rings.  I then smeared the pineapple/cherries with the paste from the brown sugar and butter.  I added the pineapple juice to the cake mix versus the water also.  It turned out great and my entire family raved about it.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

This cake was great!!!! Definitely will make again!!! I did make a few changes though. First I topped the cherries, pineapples and brown sugar with coconut. Then for the cake:
1 white cake mix(Betty Crocker)
1(3oz) package of instant vanilla pudding
3/4 cups of pineapple juice(from pineapple rings) 
1/2 cup of melted margarine
4 eggs
1 tsp cinnamon
Mix pudding and cake mix first in mixer, then add in wet ingredients. Mix for 4 minutes on med. speed. Add cinnamon last. Pour over pineapples, cherries, coconut and brown sugar.  
Bake at 350 for 45 to 55 minutes, or until cake tester comes out clean. Was Delicious the same day I cooked it. The cast iron pan made the edges nice and crispy. Then next day it was still very good, but a little soggy. Make the day you plan to serve. It is very easy. Takes about 20 minutes to put together then bake time. Very easy even with my extra steps. The cake also tastes homemade with the addition of pudding. Not spongy like a box cake!!!!!*****

I made this cake and took it to my husband's work. It was gone in less than 5 minutes. I did substitute the pineapple juice for the water, and added more water to equal the amount called for in the directions. One of my husband's co-workers said she hadn't had a Pineapple Upside Down cake for so long. Her Mom, who had died, made the best cake and this cake reminded her of the one her mother used to make. I will make this often.

Very good, not quite like my grandmother used to make, but comparable.  Definitely follow other's advise and 1/2 the butter and brown sugar (you could probably use even less brown sugar depending on your taste)

This was excellent - next time though, I will use less sugar and less butter; it was a little too rich & sweet for me.  I did substitute apple sauce for some of the oil in the cake mix.  Smells great while cooking; was a big hit in my house.

This is by far the best Pineapple Upside Down Cake EVER!!  My mom (who has baking for 40 years) said this is the best cake she's ever had.  I didn't (and wouldn't) change a thing.  Perfect!!

This is a great idea-using a cast iron skillett and cake mix. Looks fantastic and tastes as good as anything you can get in a bakery. I cut the sugar by 1/3 and the butter by half. I also used apple sauce in the cake mix instead of oil, and added pineapple juice. Used pineapple chunks and added dried apples and cranberries; then made a caramel sauce with butter and sugar, adding the fruit. It's still plenty sweet and buttery.

I love the ideas that I read about from other comments from everyone, but I kept this one simple just as the recipe called. It turned out great. I am so busy with all of my Holiday baking that this was a real treat for my family after dinner last night. Thank you for sharing it! Maybe next time I will try adding some of the other suggestions.

This is so delicious and unbelievably easy!  I didn't have rings so I used chunk pineapple cut in half so the chunks weren't so big and it worled like a charm.  I also used all the pineapple juice and finished with water to come up to what was required for the cake mix and it makes the cake portion very moist.
I also used a 12 inch cast iron skillet and i liked it in that the cake portion was a little thinner, but I didn't change any of the original ingredient amount.
Great recipe!

My wife and kids loved this.  I made one with light brown sugar and one with dark.  Both tasted great, but the one with the light sugar looked alot better.

I would give this recipe 5 stars, but you never know someone may come up with a better recipe. This is by far the easist recipe I have ever followed. It was great. I made it two days in a row. The second time I added, to my taste, some rum into the butter sugar mixture. No leftovers.

Awesome! Used Lemon cake mix and substituted the pineapple juice for the water. I took the suggestion of not using so much brown sugar and only used 3/4 cup. Baked it in a 9 X 13 pan. Very moist and not too sweet.

Yummy!  This cake was great. I did not have light brown sugar so I substituted dark, the cake looked burnt, but still tasted great.  I also added 1 8oz can crushed pineapple in between the sliced pineapple. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my 1st time making(& eating!) a p.u.d. cake- was hubby request for his bday. I also used a 9x13 pan & it worked fine except when I turned the cake onto a cookie sheet, quite a bit was stuck to the pan- but it was still soft enough to scrape off and spread back onto the cake. This was easy to make and tasty. Will probably make it again :)

Oh, this is SO good.  All my friends loved it.  I didn't have an iron skillet so I simply melted the butter in a pan and baked everything in a large casserole/cake pan.  It turned out perfect!  I would suggest cutting back the sugar slightly though.

This is so EASY and so DELICIOUS!  
This has become a family favorite.  
I have also used yellow cake mix -
This is a perfect recipe for "Carry-In" dinners - I divide the recipe into a 9" inch and 4" iron skillets. Perfect for carrying out and making sure there is some left at home for family!

I love this cake.  I used crushed pineapple and sprinkled a few chopped maraschino cherries over the pineapple. I turned mine out of the skillet too soon and the cake broke apart, but it was still delicious.

I used apricots instead of pineapple and it was delicious! I'll be making another one with pineapples soon. I used a Pillsbury vanilla cake mix and instead of water used the heavy syrup from the canned apricots. I was worried it would rise out of the skillet so I only used a portion of the batter. (The rest of the batter was used for cupcakes.) Also, in order to fill the bottom of the iron skillet, I needed two cans of apricot halves. It took longer than the 40 minutes on the cake box but it turned out perfect!

Exceeded my expectations! I was like eh, its gonna need something else! Like, no frosting?! But the brown sugar layer you make on the bottom in the beginning is more tha  enough sweet! I used Duncan Hines white cake mix and did one egg with the yolk and two egg whites even though it called for 3 egg whites.. and I added all the juice from the can to equal my one cup of water.. it came out like super moist pound cake! So good. And I dont bake. My only thing was it took way longer to bake and was spilling over my cast iron in the oven which totally freaked me out. But all in all, it made it! Haha. and it was awesome. Thank you to who posted this recipe, you made my family feel like I could actually bake sweets lol! Thank you!

Delicious flavors and moist cake. I loved using my cast iron skillet which caramelized the brown sugar and the tangy pineapple . Turned out perfect for us. I baked it for about 50 minutes at 325°. Every oven is different.  This one is a keeper.

I made this recipe in muffin tins and they came out great! I ended up putting the cherries and pineapple in first then brown sugar and last the cake batter. The first ones I put the brown sugar in the bottom and it stuck inside the muffin tin. My family really enjoyed them! My first time making upside-down cake so I was excited it turned out so well!

I made this in a 9x13 pan as my cast iron skillet was being used for our main course. I halved the brown sugar in the bottom of the pan and it turned out perfectly. Even my husband who doesn't normally eat pineapple upside down cake, loved this recipe.

Great Recipe, cake came out perfect! I don't usually use cake mixes but I think ill stock up on it for this cake only! I also used 1 cup of brown sugar because I was too lazy to measure the extra 1/4 cup and it was still excellent!

I've been wanting to get more use out of my cast iron and found this one. I haven't had pineapple upside down cake in a long time and my wife had never seen/heard of it before. I made this last night and it turned out really good and my wife liked it.
Used a 12" skillet and was perfect for size.... until I had to find a plate to flip it onto. Also thought there was too much brown sugar so may reduce it next time. I think this one will be a keeper. Thanks.

Update: Since my first review a couple years ago, I've made this a few more times. Reducing the brown sugar to 1 cup worked out. Get plenty of compliments on this cake. Also, baking to the directions of the cake mix isn't enough. I've had cook times at about an hour to cook through.

I used this recipe but baked it in a 9x12 cake pan, and substituted crushed pineapple for the rings. It was the most delicious cake ever! It might seem like there is too much butter and brown sugar, but it's really just perfect! It was actually even better the second day, and the third, and every day until, sadly, it was all gone. Will make this again, and soon.

I made the cake mix with only the pineapple juice instead of water, butter instead of oil, and doubled the eggs.  Rich but delicious.

I have made several pineapple upside down cakes. However, this recipe did not work for me. There was too much sugar and too much butter so it did not melt. They turned in to a thick sugar crust. I think I will go back to my old recipe. If I make this again I will definitely adjust the sugar and butter accordingly. Maybe I should not have used real butter.

Very tasty!  I made in a bundt pan as I did not have a cast iron skillet large enough.  I used all the pineapple juice for the water.  I did have to add a little water for it to equal the amount called for on the cake directions.

My little daughter especially loved it, so into teh recipe box it has to go. I wasn't enthusiastic about this recipe; I agree with others that the butter and sugar paste is definitely too much and makes for an unhealthy cake (I decided to cut on the sugar as the pineapple was not fresh but canned and they put enough sugar to make the syruo as it is). The result was beautiful due to the pineapple rings and candied cherry that come up on top after i's baked, but I had the problem of the sogginess and also of the sugar/butter/pineapple juice boiling over and overflowing while baking. All in all it's good, but it is made of good things (I mean, butetr, sugar, pineapple...): how could it not be? so, less sugar and less butter, and definitely no fat of any kind into the batter could be the answer for us

This is how I make my pineapple upside down cakes.  Love my cast iron skillet!  I always fill the little gaps between pineapple with chopped walnuts. Just sprinkle them around the outside too before baking. Mixed with the brown sugar they make this cake even more tempting and delicious.

Very easy and good cake, however I did make a few changes. I had a fresh pineapple that I wanted to use, only used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cups and that seemed plenty. Also did not use my cast iron skillet, but 9 x 13 glass pan, no way my skillet would have been able to hold the amount. Since it's close to Christmas, I added a few spices, cinnamon, cardamom, and ground ginger, a few shakes of each. That enhanced the flavor of the yellow cake mix. Came out pretty and no problem turning out onto a jelly roll pan, covered with waxed paper. Was enjoyed by my whole family.

I make a similar recipe, but I don't use maraschino cherries. I use two large cans of pineapple and a French Vanilla cake mix.  I also use the  juice from the pineapple in the cake mix. This recipe is great because it is just loaded with pineapple and looks great too.

I didn't have white cake mix but I did have Pineapple Supreme. I used the pineapple juice for my liquid and had to add a little water to meet the instructions on the box of cake mix. Everything fit nicely in my grandmother's old 13 inch iron skillet. Delish!

I didn't have a iron skillet so I used a 9x13 pan. The cake was delicious but turned into a soggy mess by the second day. I'm not sure if using the skillet would have dried the cake out more so that it lasted longer.

I've always made pineapple upside down cake using the pineapple juice for the liquid, like CANDIEB.  I had no idea anyone else did it this way. As they say, great minds think alike, but I've never seen a pineapple upside down cake made with white cake.  It is usually yellow cake, but pineapple cake mix is the best! Yummers!

I made this cake for my Mom's birthday because she's a huge fan of Pineapple Upside-Down Cakes.  I was skeptical because every time I work with any type of butter/brown sugar to caramel mixture, it fails.  I decided to half this recipe and use one 9" round pan, Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix, pineapple tidbits as well as the pineapple juice instead of water for the cake batter.  I had leftover batter so I threw some coconut in and made Pina Colada cupcakes which were fabulous.  The cake turned out PERFECT and my Mom LOVED this cake.

Omg, this cake was so delicious,.moist and good! Everyone LOVED IT. Even my boyfriend that doesn't have a sweet tooth kept asking for more! We ate pretty much half of the cake between 4 people. So what i did was used yellow cake mix, used pineapple juice instead of water to prepare cake batter and a splash of OJ and 1/2c of oil. Everything else i did the same. Oh and i don't own a cast iron skillet so i used a 9x13 pan. It was perfect!

Very easy and nice tasting recipe. I think I would have liked it better if it didn't use a boxed cake mix. Although that made the cake easier and quicker to make, I didn't love the flavor if the cake mix and that's why I gave this 4 rather than 5 stars.

Delicious!!  This cake is wonderful.  I didn't know what size cast iron skillet to use, so I used 9X13 pan.  I didn't attempt to turn it out of the pan since I didn't have a tray or plate big enough to hold the entire cake.  So we just cut pieces while still in the pan.  Not pretty, but very good.  I had to make myself stop eating it.  I used a white cake mix, but substituted pineapple juice for the water.  I also added 1t almond extract and cut back a little on the brown sugar.

Great simple recipe. Nice, but VERY sweet. The first time, I took the sugar down to a single cup, and parts of the side of the cake were still pure sugar. Second time I reduced to about 1/3 cup butter and 3/4 cup of sugar, and it's still plenty sweet. Looks nice in a 9x13 but better in the skillet - really nice to take to a potluck or event.

This was a fantastic recipe! The cast iron skillet makes an amazing finish, and my edges were slightly crispy - so good. I did add cinnamon to the sugar as suggested by another reviewer. In the future I think I will saute the pineapples initially, and then follow through with this recipe. I'm also wondering about fried banana upside down cake

Very good cake! I loved cooking it in the cast iron skillet (although after 30 minutes, it was only half cooked: so I covered it with tin foil and cooked it another 20 minutes) It came out perfect!

I followed the directions for the recipe but screwed up by adding the full amount of water per the box cake recipe.  Realizing my mistake I added some pineapple juice anyway.  The cake came out extremely moist and dense like a pound cake.  All around it was very good.  Next time I may add a little dark carribean rum to the mix.

NOT enough pineapple and sugar didn't completely dissolve!  I tried putting it all in my 9" cake pan and baking it.  NOT good!  The way I found to fix the recipe is first to divide the butter and sugar between two 9" pans. Second, open a second can of sliced pineapple (one can is not enough for 2 pans). You will end up with a few extra slices of pineapple which can be eaten or torn to fill in the holes. Make the cake mix according to directions.  You can substitute the drained pineapple juice for the water the cake mix needs.

I made this cake today .... I used my bundt pan and it came out perfect ... was pretty to look at and tasted as good as it looked .. loved how simple it was ... someone suggested drying the pineapple & cherries to avoid cake being soggy ... I did not do that and my cake was not soggy ... very moist ... I will definitely make it again .. I used 1/2 cup of pineapple juice & the rest water ... hubby said very good (he's a man of few words lol)

I also used the pineapple juice in the cake mix, I used a 10 inch iron skillet and baked the cake for 33 minutes. It was great. The only thing I did different was to add 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the spaces between the pineapple. My husband loved it.

This is basically the same recipe my grandmother always used, except she made her own cake from scratch.  When you use a 9-inch iron skillet, it does rise above the skillet initially, but it sinks down when cooling. It's a 5-star recipe ANY day of the week!!!

I made this cake Sunday for a church supper and it was gone before any of the actual supper items were! I really loved doing it in my skillet, too. I felt just like a pioneer woman :)
I used yellow cake instead of white and used the pineapple juice in place of water in the batter. I followed a previous reviewer's tip and filled in the gaps between the rings with crushed pineapple.
It was so easy, looked so beautiful and came out better than I'd hoped, everything I hope for when trying a new recipe. Thank you!!

Fantastic! I used two 8" or 9" rounds pans. For one of the cakes, I soaked the pineapple rings in rum as someone else suggested and the other I left plain. Both were delicious! Thanks!

This cake is so very good and easy to make.  Made mine in a cake pan but be sure not to over load pan.  Put rest of batter in separate oven safe bowl for an individual serving.  BE SURE to add the pineapple juice into the cake mixture.  I used just a little more butter (not less) and a little more brown sugar.  Came out moist and tasty.

I only used 1 cup of brown sugar (instead of 1.5 cups), and the cake turned out beautiful and tasty. The cake wasn't as moist as I would have imagined it (since there is a layer of butter at the bottom), but the butter made it easy to come out of the pan (I used a 11inch stainless steel flat bottom pan)

This was a yummy cake and gorgeous too! I made it exactly as printed in my 12-inch cast iron skillet. The 20 oz can of pineapple rings gave me exactly 1 cup of juice which is what my cake mix called for. I did have to cook it 10 minutes longer than the mix said. Popped out of the skillet beautifully after cooling 10 minutes - thank goodness, I was taking it to a birthday party immediately! Everyone raved. Thank you Anne for a quick, easy, yet great recipe.

I always like to follow recipe ingredients to a T, so I can form a more accurate opinion, and when I followed this recipe, it was 'good' but disgustingly drenched in butter and entirely too sweet.  Now that I had the "original" out of the way, I tweaked things accordingly by halving the butter to 1/4C and decreased brown sugar to a very loose 1/2C..had friends be guinea pigs and they all said it was good and tastes right, not too buttery or too sweet and have commented on its moistness.  Also, I've used yellow cake mix instead of white.  I only looked for this recipe bc the bf said it's his fav; him mentioning it is the first I've ever heard and I think it's ok.  I think it's good but not really something I would crave myself.  Perhaps I will re-review in the future by actually using white cake mix for my version of this recipe.

I made this twice recently and it was delicious. People also love the way it looked. Several people told me it was gorgeous and it should be a picture in a magazine. The presentation is awesome. This will be a classic go to dessert for my files. Little effort but big pay off.

Very good and super easy! I halved the recipe and used a remekin. I should've used the pineapple juice and/or pineapple cake mix because you can definetly taste a boxed white cake. It's all good though.

I chose this recipe because it was how my mother made her pineapple upside down cake when I was a young girl. The recipe was very easy and it came out picture perfect. The cake tasted wonderful and was very moist. I was glad I found this recipe and hope more viewers will try it.

If I could I would give this 10 stars! I used a 9 x 13 pan , used the juice from the pineapple in place of water.  I also used rings and crushed pineapple. I put the crushed between the rings and down the middle of the cake. i had some crushed pineapple left and just stirred it into the batter .  baking time was alittle longer about 7 min. just kept checking until done  AWSOME!

yummm!!! I Love, Love, Love this Recipe! I do buy the "pineapple" cake mix in the box, add the pineapple juice, instead of water, and use pineapple chunks, so that every bite of cake has some pineapple with it! Everyone that I make this cake for loves it, and always asks for seconds! Thanks for this recipe, it is a keeper! :) Happy Baking everyone!!

I didn't have a cast iron skillet but this still came out perfect melt in your mouth, however I'll be purchasing a cast iron skillet soon because I'm sure it's more wonderful that way! =)  I also soaked my pineapples in about 1/3 of a cup of rum, and replaced some of the liquid in the cake mix instructions not only with some of the pineapple juice but the rum as well.  I also like to put cherries in between the spaces of the pineapples not just in the middles.

This is exactly how my mother used to make it, except of one tasty addition!  She sprinkled coconut flakes over the pineapples before pouring in the batter.

I tried the recipe as written and really liked it, but I went with several reviewer suggestions and this cake was an absolute hit! I added the liquid from the pineapple in lieu of water for the cake mix along with 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (adds a wonderful layer of flavor). Also, I used cherries and pineapple rings to create a nice pattern on top, then filled all of the spaces with crushed pineapple. VERY wonderful flavor, incredibly simple to make, and beautiful presentation for guests.

Delicious! I baked mine in a regular 9x13" cake pan and it came out perfectly. I used the pineapple juice as water substitute and I also added some of the pineapple juice to the brown sugar butter mixture. Yummo : )

Used my 12" cast iron and didn't change a thing.  It was fantastic!  My Charleston born and raised step father said it was as good as anything he'd ever had.  Was able to substitute all the water with pineapple juice.  Cooked it for 40 minutes (10 minutes longer than the directions) and it was moist and delicious.  I've tried many recipes for this dish and it's hands down the best (even beating my grandma's from scratch version).  I wish there were more stars.

I have made this cake a lot of times and it is very easy and good i have to cook it a little bit longer that 45 minutes as it turns out a little wet in the middle i guess that is because of the juice i am really not sure, but it is a family favorite

Very simple and very good cake.  I didn't use a skillet because it seems like too much batter for a skillet.  Maybe for 2 skillets, I was not sure, so I just used by 9x13 pan.  I would think it would be better in the skillet though......however, with not being sure, I figured I'd be safe rather than sorry.

I made this cake after reading the reviews... I used a golden butter cake mix and used the pineapple juice for the liquid in the cake... Made them in my cast iron skillets and this cake was AMAZING to say the least !!!! My friend said it was better than her Granny's was.... Any recipe that has people saying it is better than Grandma's is a KEEPER FOR SURE!!!! you won't regret trying this one !!!!

Yummy & easy. I followed the others. Did not use an iron skillet but a 9x13. Added extra butter, extra brown sugar and used the pineapple juice in the cake batter instead of water. I actually cover with foil about half way thru because I thought it was brown too fast. Thanks for the easy recipe.

This was incredible!  I used a mashed banana in place of the oil called for in the cake mix.  I had a bottle of DaVinci sugar-free coconut syrup (liquid flavoring) and used 1/4 cup of that along with the pineapple juice in place of water for the cake mix.  I used a golden (yellow) cake mix.  I omitted the cherries and used pineapple chunks since that's what I had on hand.  I baked it in a Bundt pan.  Amazing flavor combination & presentation!

I have made this twice now and each time has turned out wonderful.  I use a well seasoned cast iron pan and it comes out fantastic, no sticking.  The only thing that I do is use all the pineapple juice and a little bit more water to get the 1 1/3 cup liquids.  I bake it at 350 for 38 minutes.  I do not use cherries in mine.  Even my picky 3 yr. old son loves this cake.  So moist and juicy that I will continue to keep making this for all functions that I need to bring a yummy dessert for.

Definitely a crowd pleaser! I made this in a 13x9 pan instead of a skillet and it turned out great. Used butter cake mix in place of the white cake mix, with the pineapple juice instead of water and YUM! A little sweet for my taste so I may cut down on the amount of sugar/butter the next time I make it, but that's just a personal preference.

This is a winner!  It tastes fabulous and presents stunningly.  I often make individual cakes by using large ramekins (big enough to fit a pineapple ring.)  One of my hubby's favorites! By the way, I always use yellow cake mix - our preference.

this cake was really good and only lasted one day at my house. The ony change I made was to use pineapple juice instead of water in the cake batter.

I am going to give this 4 starts because I did make modifications. This recipe was very easy and it was not overly sweet.  This is my husband's favorite cake and I have tried other versions in the past and I have to say I like this one the best.  First, I did not have an iron pan so I used a standard baking pan.  I replaced the water with pineapple juice and used pineapple delight cake instead of white cake.  I used a small can of pineapple rings and covered the rest with fresh cut pineapple.  It was very good.

This was amazing!! I made it in a bundt pan because I wasn't sure if my skillet would be large enough. I melted the butter and then mixed in the brown sugar, but I cut it back to about 3/4 of a cup. Poured that in the bottom of the bundt pan and then put some cherries down on top of that. Then I crushed up some fresh pineapple in the food processor and put that on top of the cherries. Like other reviewers I used a yellow cake mix and used pineapple juice for the liquid. It is DIVINE.

Great base recipe, I used pinapple supreme cake mix and used the juice from the pinapple instead of the water, then baked it in a 9x13 for 45 mins perfection. My husband loved  but said it was soo good that i could only make it twice a year.lol that honor he reserves for his very favorite foods, too bad this is the second time i have made this already in two months. My excuse is i am 8 months preagnant and anything pinapple is what i crave.lol

I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I followed other reviewers examples and made a rectangular cake in a 13 x 9 pan.  It was FANTASTIC!  I added just a little cream cheese to my cake batter.  My family and I ate this whole cake in one sitting, and my sister is already requesting that I make it again for her birthday this summer! :)

We really enjoyed this.  I made in a 9x13 pan and used 1/4 cup butter.  In addition, I used all the pineapple juice as liquid in yellow cake mix.  It turned out beautifully & my husband and boys scarfed it down.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!!

Everyone loved this cake. I personally don't like cooked fruit stuff, but I did eat the cake part and it was great. Only problem I had was I didn't know exactly what disolve brown sugar meant...It sure did carmalize!! Good stuff.

I made mine in a 13 by 9 pan and used pineapple chunks and almost a whole jar of cherries.  It was moist and delicious, but it was very sweet.

Simple and time tested. We make it this way every time. If it's not broken, DON"T FIX IT! This is the classic way to make it. You must use a cast iron skillet and the simple ingredients like she listed. Be careful changing it. Okay maybe yellow cake mix and a dash of vanilla but if you go and add coconut, blueberries,nuts or anything else, it might be good but it will be a different recipe and should get a different name. Some things your great Grandma simply had right all along.

My mom and I made this cake this morning and it turned out fabulous!!!!  We were shocked at how good looking it came out.  We did modify it a bit by using the Dunkan Hines Pineapple Supreme cake mix instead of the White cake mix.  It was excellent.  Next time, I plan on cutting up pieces of the Maraschino cherries and adding it to the cake batter as well!

Beautiful cake.  It was a little too "moist" for my taste - I think I like a dryer cake (go figure...).  I did make it in a 9x13 pan - worked great.  My husband and son absolutely loved it.  They would rate it 5 stars ... That's all I've got! :o)

Used 2- 8” round pans, melted 3 tbsp butter in each in oven, sprinkled ¾ cup br sugar over each. Used pineapples for 1 cake, well drained peaches for the 2nd,  each can 14 oz. Divided ½ yellow prepared cake mix  between them, replacing water with pineapple juice and froze one cake.  Next time I'll try applesauce instead of oil (ran out) and try halving br sugar as suggested by others. Cakes are beautiful, moist, sweet but not overly so. Have found though that you can easily cut sugar in half for most recipes without tasting a difference.

My fiance' is a huge fan of this cake. I use drained crushed pineapple because he likes the pineapple in every bite. I also use yellow cake mix sometimes if that is what I have on hand.

I just love this recipe. My husband requests it for his birthday and I don't mind because it is so easy to make. Instead of the white cake mix I use a French Vanilla and it is sooo good. I also replace the juice from the pineapple for the water. I have made this recipe several times and also have given it out to several people. I even bought a cast iron skillet for my son  (and seasoned it) so he could make his own. He loves it too!

This Pineapple Upside-Down Cake is the best I have made hands down.  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using all of the pineapple juice for the liquid in the cake mix.  I made this cake for my parent's anniversary and everyone raved over this cake.  My father's only complaint that it was so good that he only got one piece.  Guess what I am making this evening?

This is so yummy. I've made it a few times and it's so simple. I also make the cakes in mini bundt pans - the pineapple and cherry fit at the bottom of the pan perfectly and it looks nice when done.

I decided to go with a 9x13 pan instead of the iron skillet and I also drained the pineapple juice into the batter as suggested by other users.  It turned out really well, although I might use more brown sugar next time.  I think that had to do with it being in the pan instead of the skillet though.

I made one of these for Thanksgiving. It was soooo good!  Everyone said it was the best they had ever had. I thought that was impressive being that most of them were experienced bakers. I have been asked to make this again to bring to our Christmas gathering.

This only gets 3 stars because it wasn't a genuine pineapple upside down cake.  There was also way too much batter for a cast iron skillet.  I had to throw out the extra batter because if I would have used all of it, the batter would have overflowed in the oven.  I don't have a 9x13 cast iron skillet, which is what you would need for this recipe or a 9x13 Pyrex dish.  It was way too cake-like and not how pineapple upside down cake should be.

Wow, this was good. I cut corners by nuking the butter/margerine in a 13 x 9 glass cake pan, then sprinkled on the brown sugar (no need to stir/melt it in -- everything bakes together great). The rest I made according to directions (using yellow cake mix). It came out beautifully. Such an easy way to doctor cake mix and come up w/something amazing!

I cooked this in a cast iron skillet. It turned out phenomenal and everyone loved it. I put some crushed pineapple on the bottom for more of a pineapple flavor and put in pineapple juice for water, but other than that--made it exactly as written. It was eaten up within 1/2 an hour!

This was a very easy way to make this cake.  I tried VicRose97's method and melted the butter and sugar (which I cut both in half) together and spread this paste onto a pan that was arranged with pineapple chunks and cherries.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 because it is not dense like the ones my mom made from scratch... but I guess it's because this is a short cut recipe!

This cake is so beautiful and it always gets me a lot of compliments even before any one tastes it. I've made it 3 times now and it turns out great every time. There is always more than enough juice in the can to substitute for all of the liquid called for on the cake mix. I use the butter yellow cake mix that has pudding in it. Delicious!

My Husband could not stop talking about this cake. I would suggest cutting down on the brown sugar cause it was very sweet. I used pineapple cake and baked mine for about an hour at 375F. Don't know if using a silicone bakeware had anything to do with it. Anyway, I made a whole 9in round cake and two mini ones with my stoneware.

And all this time I thought that iron skillet was for frying!  :)  I actually had to dig it out of my camping gear for this recipe.  This was my first pineapple upside down cake, and my first time cooking anything in an iron skillet besides catfish, so I was a little worried.  The only thing I changed was to use fresh pineapple, but other than that I just followed the recipe and it came out great!  My wife was in awe of how pretty it was.  Everyone loved it.  Great recipe.

Followed recipe exactly (something I don't usually do!)  Very good cake - maybe a tad sweet so next time I may cut down on the brown sugar a bit.  I found that it baked longer then the cake mix called for and I was getting nervous because the edges looked over cooked and the inside looked under cooked.  But it turned out great and the crispy sides were actually delicious!

Excellent, first time I ever made an upside down cake.  Wanted something different and did I find the best, most moist,tasty and delicious cake here.  It disappeared during the night and one sliver left over for breakfast.  Thanks Anne, I will always make this cake.

I have never eaten this before and liked it. Everyone that I served it to said it was the best Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Easy to make as I did in a regular deep saute pan and used a pineapple cake mix.

I made this cake a couple of weeks ago so I don't remember what "tweaks" I may have made but I do remember it's a five star recipe for taste, presentation and ease.  I did use a Duncan Heines pineapple cake mix and did use the can pineapple JUICE (not SYRUP) in place of some of the water.  This was so light and moist - I just wonder, with all of us following the same recipe why we get comments about burnt or dried out cake?

Excellent recipe.  Looks just like the pld fashioned ones.  I had been looking for a recipe in a skillet and I love this.  The only substitutions:  I used yellow cake mix instead of white and I added a teaspoon of pure almond extract to give it a little kick.

It was a big hit. I did have to bake it 15 minutes longer than the box called for but it turned out beautifully. Thanks, for a keeper.

I followed this recipe pretty close to what the recipe called for. I didn't have a cast iron skillet so I used a non stick baking pan. I used 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and 3/4 cup of water, I just melted the butter over the stove and then transfered it to the pan. I really could have just melted it in the oven and avoided an extra dirty dish. I also didn't have maraschino cherries. next time I think I might follow another users suggestion to add milk instead of water. Everybody enojoyed it and even had people going back for seconds. Great Recipe! This was my first attempt at a pineapple upside down cake and would use this recipe again and again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family was too impressed! It was beautiful when it came out of the skillet!  I also soaked my pineapple in rum as someone had suggested.  Everyone thought I cheated and stopped at the bakery. Great cake!

Easy, quick and excellent. This was my first time making PUDC and could not believe it came out of the skillet so easily. I used a yellow cake mix, soaked the pineapple (1 can of crushed and one can of chunks) in Malibu rum. It came out great! Thanks

Yummy Yummy Yummy! 

My family absolutely LOVED this cake. When I made the cake, I substituted 1/2 milk and 1/2 pineapple juice for the water that was in the instructions on the box. I also used yellow cake mix instead of white. It was PERFECT! I would give it 10 stars f I could.

Used a 9x13 pan and omitted the cherries as I didn't have any.  Definitely would make again.  The simplest recipes are always the best.

I never add cherries and use crushed pineapple to make it extra moist. I also make it in a 9"x13" pan and it takes my husband and I a week to finish , but it is good to the end.

This was very good- but, how can you go wrong with butter, brown sugar and pineapple? : )  This was very delicious, but I think I'll try a yellow cake mix (Jiffy) next time (this is how my mom's always was).  The white cake was good, but is was pretty high.  I cooked in my iron skillet, but it took more than 2x as long as directed on the package.

We really liked this recipe only all the brown sugar didn't dissolve. I am going to try it again. Maybe dissolve the sugar some before putting on the fruit and mix.

This is very similar to the Pampered Chef recipe, it's easy to make and doesn't taste like it came from a box-can't beat that!  Thanks!

Excellent! One addition that I've always made is placing a few pecan halves around the pineapple slices (there's not room for many). The pecans add to the appearance plus there's nothing like pecans cooked in butter and sugar! They usually get plucked off the cake every time someone walks by it.

This cake was awesome. Few mistakes i made.. egg shell (just a little one) lost somewhere in the cake batter. I also used a 9 X 13 pyrax baking dish. Little did i know that it wasnt done all the way in the middle.. i am such an amature. I should rename mine Twice Baked Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Cause thats what i did. But it still came out great!

This cake couldn't have tasted any better! I made the cake tonight, and I can't wait to give my mother a piece tomorrow. Pineapple Upside Down Cake is her favorite cake, and I bet she'll say this is her favorite recipe for it! Best of the best in my opinion.
Do use a cake pan though, or a 12 in iron skillet.

Definitely the BEST!  I made it for someone's birthday because Pineapple UDC is their fave.  I was a bit skeptical that it would come out well, since the ones I have made in the past were dry.  Well, about 7 people ate it, and every single one of them RAVED about it.  Even someone who didn't usually like this kind of cake loved this!  Someone said he has been to many many restaurants all over the country, and this was the best he'd ever had.  The birthday girl was still thanking me the next day.  THANK YOU for making my cake the party hit!

Delicious! This was my first try at a pineapple upside-down cake.  I used a 12 inch cast iron skillet.  Also, when melting the butter I brought it up around the sides of the skillet just to make sure that nothing would stick.    I took the advice of other reviewers and only used half the butter and reduced the brown sugar to one cup.  I also added a little bit of rum to the butter/sugar mixture.

Easy recipe....I used a 10" cast iron skillet and Pillsbury yellow cake mix and was able to make two cakes.....I had great comments on the cakes! I used 3/4 or more of the pineapple juice......it was delicious!  I am sure that this cake is Dr. Atkins approved!!!! :-) Right!!!!  Good recipe and easy~!

This is a great recipe. My Mother has used this same recipe for years and it is always a hit. We add walnut halves/pieces in between the pinapple rings where there is space for them and always use the juice in the cake mix.

I made this with Betty Crocker White cake mix which called for 1/2 cup butter. Since there is butter in the topping I thought it had a very buttery taste. It came out looking beautiful, though. Nice and light cake texture - not too dense, and nicely browned on the outside. Watch it doesn't burn. Everyone really liked. I would add extra pineapple on top next time and try home made cake mix or another box brand that doesn' call for butter.

So easy and so good. Used a 10 in. cast iron skillet. I sprayed with a little pam. I used a yellow butter recipe cake mix.It looked like too much cake batter, so I made 5 cupcakes with the extra. Used pineapple juice in the cakemix instead of water as others have recommended. Yum yum yum yum yum.

YUM. I used canned pineapple chunks because that was all I could find. I also replaced half a cup of water with half a cup of the pineapple juice to get some of the flavor into the cake... Made the cake smell wonderful.

Deicious, easy to make and good looking.  I made three for 30 people and had two servings left over.  The crowd walked into the dining room already raving about the wonderful smell in the air.  They loved it!  Two of my skillets held the whole thing.  One skillet was not deep enough so we simply used 4/5 of the batter and it came out fine.

it is difficult to mess this recipe up, however i would suggest using only 1/2 of the cake mix so that the cake portion is not so thick.

Wonderful!  All enjoyed after New Year's dinner, big hit. I used a 9x13 pan, it worked out great, also added a teaspoon of Almond extract. And used the pineapple juice as the liquid.  Used my own yellow cake recipe, when in a hurry will use packaged one as suggested.

This is an easy recipe!  I have used both white and yellow cake mixes, pineapple rings and tidbits. They all work wonderfully. I recommend using at least a 10 inch or larger cast iron skillet or you will be left with extra cake mix or have a spill problem in your oven. It did need to be cooked longer than the box stated as well. Hubby loves pineapple and I love easy...so this has gone into rotation at my house!

This turned out very well!  I made it late one Friday evening.  Saturday morning I went downstairs to find my husband and 7 year old son having breakfast...the center out of my cake! I used a 9"x13" glass baking dish and by the time those two got finished it looked more like a pineapple upside down horse shoe!!
I used a D.H. brand Pinapple Supreme mix.  It was certainly sweet and maybe a little too "pineapple-y" for me.  Also I used dark brown sugar because I didn't have enough light brown.  It gave the top of the cake a very dark look behind the yellow pineapples and cherries.  Not a bad thing, just different.  
It certainly was moist.  I reccommend keeping this one in the refridgerator.
Great cake!

I made this cake on Saturday, and it was a big hit.  I don't like to use cake mixes, so I tried the "Yellow Cake Made from Scratch" recipe by Foxy on this site, and it worked wonderfully.  (I substituted 3/4 C pineapple juice and 1/4 C cherry juice for the cup of milk in that recipe, however.)  Also, I didn't have a large enough skillet, so I just used a 13 x 9" pan, which was fine.  For my taste, 1 1/2 C of brown sugar is a lot, and I found the cake too sweet; but everyone else (men) raved about it.  And I didn't have much butter, so I browned the sugar in 1/2 C extra-virgin olive oil, which worked fine.  Overall, the next time I make this PUD cake, I think I'll cut down the brown sugar to 1 or 1 1/4 C and use butter.  But even with changes I had to make, the resulting PUD cake was great.

I followed some of the suggestions and used crushed pineapple and yellow cake mix.  This was sooo good I even converted some non-pinapple upsidedown cake eaters.  I did increase the cook time to 1 hour 10 minutes before the center cooked thru.  Will definetely bake again.

Excellent PUD cake!!  This was my second attempt at a PUD.  The first one I tried was for my boyfriends b-day, it was a two layer cake which ended up being dry and bland.  It was the first thing I had ever baked that hadn't turned out well (hey it was bound to happen sometime) but refusing to be defeated by PUD I made him this cake a few weeks later to redeem myself and boy did I!!  He ate half the cake in one sitting.  I used a little bit of extra juice in place of what the recipe had called for, for water.  It was very moist and had plenty of pineapple flavor. I will definetly be making this one again!!

I brought this cake to a Christmas gathering and was requested by several people to bring the cake and the recipe for New Years!  I used Duncan Hines Pineapple and added all the pineapple juice to reach the liquid requirement. It took about 15 minutes longer to cook than the box suggested.  The mixture filled my 10" cast iron skillet and rose pretty high, but it did not overflow.  Delicious & overwhelmingly popular!

My family loved this one!  I wanted to share some with my parents, but one of my daughters would not let me... she wanted to keep it all to ourselves!  My only problem was I also baked it about 15 minutes longer than the box said and the very center still came out gooey/doughy.  Maybe this is because I did not use the iron skillet; I just used a light-weight aluminum 9x13 pan.  Other than that, it was just perfect!

The recipe doesn't specify a skillet size so I used a 9" skillet. I couldn't use all the cake mix in the pan. I baked for an additional 15 minutes but the cake still came out gloppy in the center. I'm still trying to get the brown sugar/butter combo off of my skillet. If I try this again I'd use a 10" skillet.

Very tasty. Took about 45 minutes to bake in 8x8” pans. Used pineapple tidbits so make pineapple taste in each bite.

This was so simple and delicious!  I made it in an iron skillet and it turned out beautifully.  I used all of the pineapple juice and just enough water added to cover the liquid called for on the cake mix.

Very good and moist. I used a pineapple cake mix and used the pineapple juice from the tidbits only having to add a little bit of water to make one cup. I only used 1 cup of brown sugar and did not miss the other 1/2 cup. The black iron pan was very full but did not overflow. It did take almost twice as long to bake in the oven.  It was worth the wait!

Great recipe. Used Jiffy yellow cake mix and juice from canned crushed pineapple. After reading reviews. I sprayed with Baker’s Joy 6 foil lined muffin cups and a small cast iron skillet.

This was really easy to make and delicious. I skipped the cherries just because I don't like them. For the liquid, I took the advice of others and added rum to the pineapple juice and the water.  I used an 11" cast iron pan and it did not run over and practically fell out of the pan when I turned it over. Note: this is a very heavy pan and cake. A little help when flipping is a good idea! Thanks for the recipe! I'll make this one again.

I love using frying pans. Reminds me of the way that my grandmother cooked in the wood stove. I must be giving a clue to my age.

I followed the receipt closely but like previous reviews I used the drained pineapple juice as a replacement for the water the cake mix called for. I also added three spoonfuls of crushed pineapple (since I bought a can by mistake) to the cake batter. The crushed pineapple made it longer for the cake to finish baking but was delicious when eaten.

Made this today for my husband's birthday. Used yellow cake mix, used all the pineapple juice ( not syrup) that came in the can. Was only about 2 Tablespoons short of the required cup of water, so I used dark rum to make up the rest. Also added 1 tsp vanilla, because what the heck!  Baked in 9" cast iron skillet. I have batter left for cupcakes tomorrow. Baked close to an hour. Let cool 10 minutes and some of the pineapple slices and sugar stayed in the skillet. No worries,  just placed them back on the cake. It is excellent!  Will definately make this again. Very easy and delicious. Thank you

I made this 100% exactly as it was written. As suggested in the recipe I substituted half of the water on the cake mix package with pineapple juice. If I was to do it again, I'd use more. I really thought this would be too sweet, but it was PERFECT.

Easy recipe. My husband's favorite cake. As others suggested I used Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme Cake Mix. I also and
substitute the pineapple juice from the can of pineapple instead of water that the mix calls for. Sometimes I use my kitchen torch on the pineapple to crisp it up a little.

We used Fresh Pineapple instead of canned, and it turned out amazing! (For the cakemix we used milk and butter instead of Water and oil, as well).

As-is, this recipe deserves 5 stars. Simple and delicious, and thoroughly idiot-proof. I like to sprinkle cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice over the brown sugar & butter glaze, but it isn't necessary. I also add a short can of crushed pineapple to the cake mix in lieu of water, but again that's a preference. Love this recipe!

Here's what I want to add to all the glowing reviews:
Took it out of the oven at 29 minutes, inserted knife which came out clean-- no second, third tries of sticking it back in oven to make sure it's baked all the way through.

Want to use FRESH Pineapple? No problem. Cut the slices about a 1/4" thick and place as directed. But you will need to buy a can of pineapple for the juice (not syrup) to add to the cake mix (although this may not really be necessary).

The recipe doesn't indicate what size of skillet to use. I only had a 9-inch and I knew it would be too small. So I made two cakes, one in the skillet and one in a 9" round pan. Just upped the butter to 3/4 cup and brown sugar to 2 cups in order to cover the bottoms of both. Cakes came out great!

cut sugar to 1 cup- added pineapple juice in place of water- heated butter, sugar,pineapple and cherries to med- hi to caramelize- then added batter to bake- perfect for Mother's Day! I used my 12 inch cast iron- it was my grandmothers's-:-)

I asked my husband what I should rate this cake at and he stated "10"! Needless to say, he loved it and declared to everyone that it was the best he had ever had. I will now be making it for my oldest son who loves a good pineapple upside down cake.  We will see what his rating is.
I substituted yellow cake mix for white as that is what I have always used for pineapple upside down cake. 
No doubt I will be making it again as it is going to be made tonight or tomorrow for my son.

Just delicious. Be careful with the size of cast iron skillet that you use because it may over flow.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated. Incredible and easy to make.

Hands down an easy cake that every one loves and takes seconds from.  I replaced the 1 cup liquid (water) in the cake mix recipe with 1/4 cup aged rum, 1/2 cup pineapple juice, and 1/4 cup water.  Also use 1/2 cup unsweet Ned applesauce instead of oil.

I reduced the brown sugar and was glad I did. Next time I would reduce it further and only use 3/4 cup. Instead of water in the cake I used 3/4 cup pineapple juice and 1/4 cup spiced rum which seemed to be a good amount as some people could detect it and some couldn’t so it was nice and subtle. Added cinnamon with the brown sugar, wish I had added some to the cake. I think a bit more pineapple would be good as the amount called for won’t fully cover the top. 4 stars for good bones of a cake but it needs a little more love than the ultra basic recipe calls for.

Great, easy recipe.  I didn't have pineapple rings, so I used crushed pineapple (well-drained) instead.  The only issue was that since I used my biggest cast-iron skillet, I didn't have a cake plate big enough to flip the cake onto...whoops.  (The fact that I served the cake on a giant crawfish platter did not detract from the taste at all...lol!)

I used the juice from the pineapple instead of the water and I used a yellow cake mix because that’s what I had in my house. We made it in a mini bundt pan and a 9 inch round pan. Amazing! My picky eater LOVED it.

This cake was so easy to make and it came out perfect!  I used a Staub cast-iron skillet, 10.5". I did use the pineapple juice instead of water but that was the only change.  Cooked for 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  Waited exactly 10 minutes and removed it from the pan, perfect!!!  Will definitely be making this again.

What is this with people not having an iron skillet? That is a must have item in all kitchens, and the very first item I got for mine. I have been using cast iron skillets for years to cook cakes and cornbreads, and it makes a huge difference in how they cook. Over the years I have either bought or inherited cast iron, and I now have several dozen skillets :) The old ones are the best. Even when all are taken good care of and seasoned properly, the old ones are made better. But, to the recipe.. This if the same recipe I have used for years, and it is delicious! One of my all time favorite cakes. Ihave used the slices, and the little tid-bits with good results. I have tried using crushed pineapple, but it isn't nearly as good. And NEVER.. I mean NEVER forget the cherries!  Oh, and ALWAYS use butter in this recipe.. Don't use margarine. Margarine tastes nasty nowadays, anyway.

Awesome recipe! I didn’t have an iron skillet big enough so I made it in a 13x9 pan. Next time I will cut the brown sugar down to only 1 cup. A lot of it stuck to the pan, and it was still pretty and super sweet!!!

Have never made this before and this recipe was wonderful.  Adding the pineapple juice instead of some of the water made it moist and delicious.  My hubby is in 7th heaven with this.  Only thing I had issues with was cook time.  The instructions said to follow cooking directions on box but it took 44 minutes at 325 to cook in my cast iron skillet.  Worth the wait.

This is one of my new favorites. I followed the directions and a couple of comments including using the pineapple juice in place of the water and using pineapple cake mix. Add a cold glass of milk in a glass and you’ve got the makings of a good night snack. Yummy!

I used Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme cake mix. I did discard some of the mix to fit the No. 6 iron skillet I have. I followed the rest of the directions exactly. Timing was about 10 minutes longer for me. I will always make this in an iron skillet in future. It does improve the taste and texture of the topping.

Made this in a 9x13 pan and used canned pineapple in pineapple juice (not syrup) and used the juice instead of any water. I also chose a yellow cake, Betty Crocker extra moist cake mix.  My guests said it was SCRUMPTIOUS! They also wanted the recipe.

I must have done something wrong.  Divided into two 9 inch cake pans. The amount of brown sugar was way too much. I pitched it all and started over with a recipe from a tried and true cookbook.

This is an easy and delicious recipe!  I followed other's suggestion of substituting  pineapple juice for the water in the cake mix.  Added one teaspoon vanilla to the cake mix, and a dash of cinnamon to the brown sugar.  Releasing the cake from the skillet can be tricky.  A well seasoned skillet is highly recommended. This is a keeper!

I wish I would have used the pineapple juice in the cake batter but the thing I would change in the recipe is to make sure the sugar is well melted into the sugar so it soaks more easily into the cake... without a little heat to blend the sugar mine seemed a bit grainy but overall I would make the recipe again... I used a pineapple box cake mix in a 10 inch square cast iron skillet.

Omg this was a huge hit and so easy!! I used a 10 skillet and it poured over and i had to cook it for almost 50 mins.  I sprinkled cinnamon over the pineapples then topped it with coconut. It was fluffy, moist and my BF loved it! My kids were in love with it too! will make this again soon!!

I have made this cake a number of times.  It is so easy and takes NO time to get it into the oven.  When made in an iron skillet, it is a nice thick wonderful upside down cake.  Try it using crushed pineapple instead of rings.  Every bite has the reason we make this cake on it...the pineapple!  If you want the color of the cherries, use them to make an appealing design on top of the crushed pineapple...beautiful.  
A GOOD-EASY-GONE CAKE!

So so Good! I totally can't wait to bake it again. I added nutmeg and only used 1/4 cup of water as suggested by other bakers. I'm a beginner so I made the silly mistake of trying to bake in a spring form pan! Butter burned all over my oven floor, plumes of smoke came from my oven. I thought that pan would make the end result prettier. Oops! Its a long story but I fixed it and it was fabulous. I made it for my dads birthday and there was not a piece left! Even the five toddlers present devoured it. Thanks for sharing.

This was first time making pineapple upsidedown cake. This recipe is fantastic, we give it a 10. I used a Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme Cake Mix. I also swapped out 1/4 of the pineapple juice (from the pineapple slices) for the water from the directions on the cake mix. Oh and I also made it in two 9 inch round pans. >^..^

This turned out well. I used a 9x11 pan. I used pineapple juice for 2/3 of the liquid in cake batter that called for water. It stuck a little bit in the center if you look at my photo. I cooked it at 350 for 30 minutes exactly and let sit for an hour. It was still warm when I took out. I think if I had waited any longer the bottom would have hardened too much and really would have stuck bad. I'll make this again. Very sweet!

First time trying a PUD cake and I am happy with my result. I wish I would have used more of the pineapple juice, but now I know for next time. Because there will be a next time. I'm also happy I was able to use the cast iron skillet. Cooked great and came right out. I did take more like 45 minutes to cook through but worth the wait.

Use 1c brown sugar, Pineapple supreme cake mix (Duncan Hines), 1pkg vanilla instant pudding and pie filling, 4 eggs, 1 cup pineapple juice instead of water and 1/2c oil.Bake 40 minutes and cover the last 10-15 min if needed to prevent from burning top of cake. This cake always disappears at every family gathering. Delicious!

I made this exactly as the recipe only I didn't have a cast iron so I used an 81/2x13 glass pan. It was yummy and when it came time to eat it it went fast. It was so moist and easily to flip onto a plate. This is a must make recipe and a keeper. Thank you so much for posting.

I didn't change any of the ingredients, and baked the cake in a heavy skillet  It was a little heavy  to turn so next time I'll probably use an aluminum pie plate and turn the pan when it is cool enough.  The kids really liked the cake, both taste and texture,  and Alyssa and Cory went home with a small amount of left over.

Turned out  great but instead of the  cherries I used fresh blueberries and also used a yellow cake mix with the pineapple  juice. Kids said it was awesome!

Luscious. The best pineapple upside down recipe I've used.I used a 10" cast iron fry pan.The cake is denser with way more flavor than a box cake. I used half vanilla and half almond extract. Otherwise i followed the recipe. Next time I may try precooking the brown sugar and butter a little before adding the fruit to see if the syrup will get crunchy.

Followed others advice with pineapple juice sub for water and added  1 tsp cinnamon to brown sugar and my husband and kids ate half of it in 1 sitting! Did break when I flipped it though.

Delicious and extremely simple to make. Do not cool for longer than the recommended 10 minutes as the cake will stick to pan. 7-8 minutes should be plenty.

I've made it twice so far as directed and it has been a hit! I used the 1/2 cup pineapple juice left in the can and 1/2 cup water in the Supreme Moist Classic White Cake recipe. Super easy and I will be making it again on Thanksgiving by request of the family!

this review is  not to take away from the original one.. I just put a small twist too it... I soak my pineapples in rum, sometimes myers dark rum or malibu rum.. I use the light syrup from the pineapple in the cake mix and add shaved coconut to the mix , then I also use the rum that I soaked the pineapple in,,. and bake everything as directed.. this is very yummy!!!

I've made this many times using yellow or white cake mix and it's always delicious! We omit the cherries and use the pineapple juice in the cake mix as directed and it looks and tastes amazing each time! The only thing to note is that it does take longer to bake than the box mix indicates.

Great easy cake.  Brought it to dinner at a friends and everyone loved it.  I have to say that I used a lemon cake mix and added coconut after the pineapple.  Turned out perfect!  Thank you for the recipe.

Although this cake was quite good, it didn't quite own up to the memories I had of my mother's recipe. I chose this one because she used a cast iron pan and so does this one. I think the difference probably was the use of a cake mix rather than mixing my own fresh ingredients. I'll look for a alternative to cake mix next time. Meanwhile, this cake was easy, tasty and very attractive.  One hint I might add; try very hard to center the cake on a platter before turning it. Once it is overturned off center, it's nearly impossible to straighten out.

This is really excellent as a base. I also messed with it and it has become the beloved dessert in our home, and to take to friends. I used canned, crushed pineapple and don't use the cherries (just not a fan, and I feel like the crushed pineapple gives a better cake to pineapple ratio - I want it in every bite!) I replace the water with as much pineapple juice as I can, and then add an extra egg, about a half cup of plain greek yogurt and a box of vanilla pudding mix. To the brown sugar, I add about a teaspoon of cinnamon and mix it in well before distributing over the brown sugar and butter. I use a large (11 inch) cast iron skillet and bake at 325 for about 35-40 minutes until done. It's fantastic.

I only used one cup of sugar divided into two pans and this was way too sweet. I had such high hopes but I can't eat much of this. The pineapple stuck in the pans after I turned them over so I had to scoop out the pineapple and add it to the top of the cake. In my opinion, way too much sugar. way too much....

I made this pineapple upside down cake and my husband loved it.  He is a picky guy, and asked me to make it again. 
I followed the ladies' advice and added more sugar, more butter and added 1 cup of pineapple juice.  I baked for an hour and 10 minutes in a 10" iron skillet covered with foil. It was delicious!  Thank you for the recipe Anne!!!

It looked lovely.  It was entirely too sweet.  It was over the top sweet. I will try this recipe again, but cut the brown sugar to maybe 1/2 cup.

I've never been a real fan of pineapple upside down cake. However, this is boyfriend's favorite cake. I made it for him on Easter. I must say it was amazing and EZ!!!

I found out that in the larger pan I had to bake it in about 10 minutes longer but this cake is so delicious. For those that are dairy intolerant instead of butter I use coconut oil.

As other bakers have suggested, I replaced most of the liquid in the cake mix with the pineapple juice from the can of slices. I made it in my 13" cast iron and baked it for about 43 minutes. Gorgeous!

Excellent and quite easy.  There's just nothing like a "black spider" as my grandma used to call it.  I used fresh pineapple and a small can (almost 1 cup) of pineapple juice.  I followed the directions exactly and the cake popped right out of the pan.  Impressive!  I served my dinner guests, including 3 teen boys and everyone raved.

I made this exactly as directed and it was great .  I think I would decrease the brown sugar next time - it was just bit too sweet.  Everyone loved it.

This cake was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe but added pineapple tidbits to the batter as well as shave coconut on top of the brown sugar before I added the batter to the pan. I used box of 16 ounce cake mix and used an 8 inch cast iron pan and although it was full, it didn't overflow and Rose perfectly.

Yum!!!  So good!!  I made it with yellow cake mix and replaced the water with the pineapple juice. I prefer to use crushed pineapple over the slices.  Baked it in a special pan for pineapple upside down cakes.  It was so delicious!!!

In a fruit basket I had recieved a pinapple and I had to use the whole thing up before it could ferment. While searching for recipes I found this little delight and the family couldn't get enough of it. I found it surprising how it called for boxed cake which made things so much easier for me in the end. Thanks Anne!

Great recipe!  I added about 1/3 can of crushed pineapple with some of the syrup into the recipe as well.  This made the cake extra moist.  So good!

Great with fresh pineapple!!! I had a fresh pineapple to use so I used it for the pineapple rings as well puréed and added water to make up all liquid in cake mix. I used a 13" cast iron the only issue is the sugar didn't dissolve audit should have , next time I would cut out 1/2 cup sugar and dissolve it in the butter first the cake is plenty sweet and has a great fresh taste !!

I don't own a cast-iron skillet so used a 9x13 banking pan. Heated up the butter and poured into the pan and then added the brown sugar. I then continued the recipe as written. After baking the cake it becomes like a brownie like text and thin just like one. Note: it took longer than 30 minutes to bake...more like 40-45 minutes. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! My family now begs for me to make it this way.

This was a great recipe for my first time making a pineapple upside down cake.  It came out so light and fluffy with a great top and was very easy to get out of the skillet.  I didn't make any changes and don't plan to in the future.

Simple recipe but...  Brown sugar did not dissolve properly; instead, a lot of it separated from the butter, which ran into the bottom of the cake plate once served--making my cake soupy & unappetizing-looking later.  In the past, I've had good luck mixing up a syrup of brown sugar, butter and crushed pineapple on the stove top,  then pouring it over pineapple rings and cherries in a greased 9x13 (or two 8" round pans) and last, pouring prepared cake mix (with reserved juice subbed for some of the water) on top.  Next time I'll stick to what works for me, no shortcuts.

My iron skillet isn't big enough, so like others I used a 9 x13 glass pan. Also used a yellow butter cake mix and it was delicious.  I used a little less brown sugar (1 cup) and it's plenty sweet! Had to bake it just a bit longer than the mix package said and it's still very moist. My husband likes pineapple but I'm not too big on it, but this is really good. Easy too! Will make again.

this was really good - I was hesitant due to some of the negative reviews.  I did as others recommended - cut the butter and brown sugar in half and used a yellow cake mix.  35 minutes it was delicious, light and fluffy. Do not expect a heavy cake which I was hoping it would not be.  my family loved it.  I used a 12 inch skillet and it was perfectly cooked.  I think the skillet is key as it keeps the heat more than a 9x13 pan.  We will do this again!

Oh wow! My husband and I just celebrated our anniversary in Hawaii and old friend gave us fresh pineapples to bring home! Chopped those into chunks vs the rings, used someone's idea in the reviews and used Duncan Hines pineapple supreme cake mix. I followed the recipe on the box-thought using pineapple juice would make it too sweet and I was correct. Used Tillamook butter with the brown sugar and quartered 5 cherries..... Seriously amazing!!! So flavorful and moist! Love having it in a Dutch oven! Will add it to on A LOT longer than the recommended time. I added 10 additional minutes several times while reducing the heal level so as not to burn it... Need to figure out the magic temp and time for my specific Dutch oven.

i added the pineapple,e juice to the cake batter. I rarely bake but it was a special occasion. Right on!  Everybody loved it. Didn't have a cast iron pan so did it in a 9x13 pan instead.  Scrumptious.

I followed it step by step from the video and it turned out great. I did cook for 35 minutes. I was worried that it may stick to the cast iron skillet, but I made sure to only cool 5 minutes before turning it into my serving tray. This was a fun recipe to try.

First time I have ever made a pineapple upside-down cake and it was very easy and turned out great. I used a 10" stoneware baker, butter yellow cake mix and used the pineapple juice in place of the water that the mix called for. Took to work for a bake sale and everyone loved it and said it was very moist.

This recipe turned out perfect!  This is my husbands favorite kind of cake. I followed the directions exactly, except it had to cook considerably longer than it states on the cake box. It took about 45-55 minutes for the center to be done completely, once it was done it tasted wonderful.  I used a round 9 inch cake pan, a 10 inch pan would've been a better pan to use.

Made this for my brother's birthday, everybody loved it. I used almost all the juice from the can of pineapple slices in place of most of the water that the cake mix called for, and I also cut back the brown sugar on the top (bottom?) to about 1 cup.

Tastes very good! I think I prefer a homemade cake batter, however, as the box cake was a bit too light and fluffy for a pineapple upside down cake. Maybe it was just the mix I used?

This is a phenomenal cake! I have made this cake twice using the suggestions of others. It is a phenomenal cake! I used pineapple juice instead of water and yellow cake mix (Duncan Hines). I used a 12 inch cast-iron skillet in the cake took about 45 minutes before it was done. I also recommend cooking the butter and sugar together so in makes  a syrup before placing the pineapple rings into the pan.

I tried this recipe tonight and I also believe that it calls for too much brown sugar.  I have a 12 inch pan and it still took forever to bake.  In addition, since the food companies have started skimping on the products and reducing the packaging (cake mixes no longer come in 18.25 ounces but are 16.25) the recipes are all a little off.  I had to cut my cake up and make a trifle out of it.  I think this is a good recipe but I need to experiment with the measurements to come out right.

This is a pretty good recipe. I made it twice: once almost exact recipe (took out the cherries) and one with a little alteration. Both were excellent.

My alteration was that I used fresh crushed pineapple and the juice from it.

This was a great recipe!  I never thought of using the pineapple juice in the cake mix, so that was a new idea.  I made mine in a 13x9 pan and used a butter cake, rather than a white cake.  It was excellent!

It was a basic recipe with a simple flavor. I think the cake was a little to light of a batter. When I tried to cut it, the carmalized brown sugar came right off the cake. Also, I took the advice of some reviews and uses a 9x13, thinking my cast iron wasn't deep enough, the cake barely raised and was spread to thin. I think I would use yellow cake mix next time, might have more flavor.

Hmm... I had high hopes for this cake and was disappointed! The only changes I made were subbing the juice for water for the cake batter and used a 9 by 13 inch dish. This was a soggy mess (I called it mud) and the only way my hubby enjoyed it was under ice cream. It really did turn out more like a topping than a cake. I'm a rather competent cook so I hesitate to say it was me..  Though with all the great reviews maybe it was? I have to try this again as my daughter wants a pineapple upside down cake for her birthday. I will update the review if I did in fact go wrong.

Excellent recipe. I used the pineapple supreme mix and the juice from a 20oz can of crushed pineapple. I baked mine in a cast iron chicken fryer which is a 10 1/4" 3" deep skillet. This would nee a 12" skillet if you're using the standard depth. We like to use crushed when we are baking these for ourselves, more pineapple.

This cake is delicious. First, I used other reviewers suggestions, and made the cake in a 13x9 inch pan. I used yellow cake mix, and instead of water, added pineapple juice. I had to add just a tiny bit of water, then added veg oil, and eggs as directed. This cake is moist, and the taste of pineapple, cherries, and brown sugar add to the flavor.This recipe will be our dessert for Easter.

I made this the night before in a 9x13 pan.  I followed the recipe exactly and made sure to flip it upside down into another 9x13 pan after 10 minutes.  It did not stick to the pan and was the "right" side up when I brought it to the party.  It was super good when microwaved 15 seconds and served with cool whip or vanilla ice cream.  If I make it again and don't care about the presentation I think I will make it with pineapple tidbits so it is easier to cut smaller pieces.

This was excellent but only gave it a 4 because I thought there was a bit much brown sugar.  I used 1 1/2 cups firmly packed, but maybe the recipe didn't mean for it to be firmly packed since it does not say that.  So maybe I used too much!  Next time I'm cutting back a bit and I bet we will be able to give it a 5!

This cake is amazing- I made it in a 9 x 13 glass pan. Since I used a fresh pineapple there was no juice so I subbed out some water in the cake mix with juice from a freshly squeezed lemon. I used sweet butter so I added some salt on top of the pineapple and butter.  I used yellow cake but I could see it working with whatever. Great  stuff.

Very easy! Love it.  I did take the advice of others and I also use the juice from the pineapples. Only as an option, I accidentally used yellow cake mix instead of white one time and actually like it a little better :). The white cake mix is good too. Very versatile recipe.  Thanks!!

I did not have an iron skillet, melted the butter in a 9x13 glass cake pan,sprinkled brown sugar over the butter, added the pineapple slices and cherries, added the cake batter (prepared according to manufacture directions). Once it was done, I turned it over onto a cookie sheet, it came out beautifully & everyone enjoyed!

This was the best pineapple upside down cake I've ever had and the family agreed. I didn't change a single thing & cooking it in the cast iron was the key in my opinion.

I added 1/4 buttermilk, pineapple juice and sour cream. I used a rectangular baking dish which wasn't enough batter so next attempt I'm going to double up on the batter for more cake. I also dont cut my cherries.

This is a hit at our house!  Made a couple changes, just cause the white cake didn't sound good to me.  I used a pineapple cake mix and added  1 small pkg of vanilla instant pudding.  I used a deep cast iron skillet and did have to cook it a little longer..  used a butter knife in the center till it came out clean.  Very moist!

I have made this cake 5 or 6 times and it is wonderful!  We don't have an iron skillet so I just use our regular oven safe skillet and it turns out great.  We usually serve this with cool whip.

This was delish!!! I made it for my kids for the kick off of the new "Psych" season. (If you are not familiar, you have to find a pineapple in each episode.) It was a big hit! My mother even licked her plate --- and she is a propper lady! It was very moist --- almost too moist as it was a bit messy to cut --- but who cares when it tastes this good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added the pineapple juice to the batter. I also disolved the brown sugar in the butter. It was a perfect fit or my 11" cast iron skillet. Thanks for posting the recipe Anne!

Great recipe. I used a French Vanilla cakemix and mixed by hand, liquid and semi-liquid ingredients first, then added to cake mix. Whisking and some labor seem to make things taste better. Used a cast iron skillet and also used pineapple chunks instead of rings, because that's what we had. However, I've never liked cutting the rings when I eat PUDC, so this work better on multiple levels.

This is a high impact, low effort dessert, so I strongly recommend you make it a showcase part of the evening. Make it after the meal while everyone is chatting and sipping, then put a cake plate on the table, shake the cake in the skillet to loosen it a bit, then flop it out in front of everyone. If you get the results I did, there will be ooohing and ahhhing and then the smell of warm cake will waft up. Everyone hands down thought this was quite an event, and gobbled the cake while saying it was one of the best things they had ever eaten. I had chunks and cherries all across the golden sugary bottom of the cake, and hope I can post a picture somehow, as it looked very beautiful. 

You will have your cake and eat it too...until it's gone!

This was an awesome cake!  I used a yellow cake mix.  For the 1 cup water called for I used 1/2 cup juice from the pineapple and 1/2 cup coconut rum.  I baked it in my 12" Pampered Chef skillet.  I used one can of pineapple ring and then filled in all the empty area with crushed pineapple so there was pineapple in every bite!  It was totally AMAZING!  Moist, the topping had a little crunch to it.  Everyone loved it!  Will make again and again!  Next time I'm going to try using fresh pineapple and will soak it for a bit in the coconut rum and then use the juice and rum for the water.

Waaaa!  What did I do wrong?  I thoroughly drained the pineapple and assembled as instructed  After 30 mins. the cake appeared done (toothpick came out clean) and I let rest 10 mins.  When I flipped it over, the cake was only baked around the edges....the middle was raw batter near the bottom of the pan--even though the tester came out clean?! *****FOLLOW-UP**** I flipped the cake back into the pan, returned to the oven for another 10-12 mins and it actually turned out great, all things considered.  My son was helping me, and he had added more pineapple to the pan (we used crushed) without draining it.  The added moisture caused the cake to need extra baking time.  Even though it started as a flop, it is already half eaten.  Excellent!

Always a hit with my husband! Make sure to put the pineapple juice in the cake mix and use as much butter as it specifies even if it seems like a lot, otherwise the cake will stick to the pan.

It was a hit! I did decorate with the cherries as seen in the picture. Since I do not have an iron skillet I used a regular round cake pan. It came out beautifully!
I will be using this recipe again in the future!

Very disappointing. I knew I would be getting a heavy dessert, but this was like a cake mix cake soaked through with butter and brown sugar. The butter/brown sugar mixture doesn't get enough concentrated heat to caramelize properly.

I love this recipe! This was my first time making a pineapple upside down cake. I used my home-canned cherry jam instead of the maraschinos, and a yellow cake mix. It was YUMMY!!! Thank you so much! I also used the pineapple juice instead of water like the other reviewers said, very good stuff!

Wow - delicious recipe!  I made this for my father-in-law for his birthday and he LOVED it.  I used a yellow cake, added a tsp of cinnamon to the brown sugar and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I'm not one for straying from recipes but didn't have a skillet, had yellow cake mix on hand and love cinnamon, so followed some advice/comments from others and went for it.  So easy and delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

Followed the suggestions to drain pineapple juice into cake mix.  Also added 1/2 of the smallest can of crushed pineapple to the mix.  (Made the cake VERY moist, almost to the point of not done in the middle, but Mark called it "perfect".)

I don't have cast iron, so I used the stoneware lasagna pan.

Was nervous about flipping it out, but followed directions & it worked perfectly.

YUM!

The cake was so easy to make and it was delicious. My husband says this cake is now his favorite. He requests it every weekend. Substituting the liquid the recipe calls for with Rum and Pineapple juice makes a yummy adult cake.

I've had a craving for this for a while and thought it was funny that I stumbled upon this recipe. I've been making it for years! This time I used pineapple chunks and cut the cherries into quarters. It's an Equal Opportunity Upside Down Pine Apple Cake. Everybody gets some of the good stuff!. Be sure to use a very sharp knife for cutting through the fruit to keep the cake pretty!

Very good but WAY too sweet.  Need to cut brown sugar down to no more than one cup.  Maybe just covering the butter is enough.

I had a box of white cake mix, a can of crushed pineapple and a sweet tooth. This recipe really hit the spot! I didn't use any water in the cake mix, just used the pineapple juice and added sour cream until I had the correct amount of liquid. My iron skillet wasn't big enough and I didn't have an 11x13 pan so I used an 8x11 pan. I baked it for 35 minutes at 350 and another 20 minutes at 325. I will definitely try using the iron skillet next time and just make some little pineapple-ly cupcakes.

Thank you! I have never made this because I thought it was too complicated...but, OMG this is so easy! my hubby took it into work and it was gone in 5 minutes;-) I did use the juice from the pineapple for the water required for the cake mix. I also used pineapple cake mix.

I don't have a cast iron pan, so used two 9in round pans and a homemade yellow cake recipe. I did the tip about subbing some pineapple juice for liquid and ended up doing 1/2 cup juice and 1 cup milk. Really should of followed the tip for putting a pan or something underneath because the liquid boiled over, and I still have a nasty mess to clean. Overall though the cakes turned out wonderfully. Had to cook for 10 minutes more then recipe called for, but cakes were perfect. Dense and soft at same time, golden brown glaze on top. Took one cake to work, and it got very good reviews.

Fabulous!  I used a yellow cake mix, 3/4 c pineapple juice from can, 1/4 c rum, 1/4 c water, 3 eggs, and half a stick of butter to make the cake batter.  Next time I'll try pineapple chunks, as the rings didn't cut well for attractive serving.  May add pecans or walnuts to the butter , sugar, and pineapple layer.

Four stars because I changed some things, but overall very good.  I used only 2/3 c. brown sugar because I used a 9x13 pan and that amount covered the bottom of the pan.  It made the "crust" very buttery though since I still used 1/2 c. butter.  Like many others, I used the pineapple juice for the water in the cake mix.  I also used a pineapple cake mix.  And I didn't use cherries at all since I don't like them.  I did use a can of pineapple chunks instead of rings and that worked just fine.  Made a very moist cake and I will make it again.

I substituted the maraschino cherries for a whole can of regular cherries just because I hare maraschino cherrys. I spread the cherrys all over the pineapple. The cake came out delicious! My husband took it to his office and people still ask me for the recipe. My advise substitute the cherrys.

Both my husband and I LOVED this recipe. I used fresh pineapple and didn't have any juice, so I made the cake mix with just water, but it was SO good with the fresh pineapple that I'll never do it another way. I used a 10" wilton pan, made sure the pineapple was thinly sliced, and it fit beautifully. My only issue was that I deducted 1/4c of the water because of all the butter on the bottom, and the very middle didn't cook all the way through. Next time I'll be sure to cook a little longer and at a slightly lower temp.

I used my 12" cast iron skillet and it was filled to the top.  A smaller skillet wouldn't have held all of the cake mix.  I did sub some pineapple juice for about half of the water and applesauce for oil...turned out moist.  Great cake!

I first fixed this cake for my Mother's birthday (she always baked a pineapple upside-down cake for my Grandma) and she LOVED it! I couldn't believe how good it was. I've fixed it three more times since, and although it is EXTREMELY RICH it is very tasty--I like adding a dollop of cool whip.

Yummy!  I asked my daughter to make me a pineapple upside down cake for Mother's Day and she did a great job picking and making this recipe.  My mother made pineapple upside down cake when I was a kid and it wasn't this good!  She used a white cake mix with crushed pineapple and it tasted great.  We will definitely be making this again.

Ive made a lot of different pineapple upside-down cakes and this is one of my favorites for sure! Im making it for the second time in one week tonight. The only change I made was using the pineapple juice in place of water and it took a little bit longer in my oven.

This is my husbands favorite cake.I have tried both a pineapple cake mix and a yellow cake mix.Both are good but we prefer the pineapple.I add pineapple juice in place of the water.This cake is so incredibly moist and delicious.I used to make pineapple upside down cakes from scratch but they were never as good as this one.This is the one time that I actually prefer to use a mix.I highly recommend this cake and be sure to cook it in the cast iron skillet.

This is one "sweet" recipe!  My DH, who absolutely loves pineapple upside down cakes, said from now on, this is the only cake he'll eat! I followed the advice of others and used the liquid from the pineapple in place of the water. Because he loves pineapple, I used both pineapple slices and pineapple chunks. I placed the chunks in the areas wehre the slices didn't fill. I used a pineapple upside down cake mix in place of the white cake, and couldn't be happier with the recipe. This is a very sweet and moist cake and is absolutely delicious.  I did make my first cake in a 9x13 cake pan which was disasterous when I tried flipping it, but the second time I made it in a cast iron skillet and had no problem whatsoever when I turned it over.

I've made this 3 times. once for my family, for a Christmas party, and for my sisters class. All three times it was a huge hit. its a very simple recipe that anyone can make. one suggestion i have is instead of using the pineapple rings use the ones that are crushed. it's a lot easier to cut.

It was great!!  My family hasn't stopped talking about it.  I used pineapple flavor cake mix from Duncan Hines I think.  I also had to use (2) 9-in. round pans and of course twice the pineapple and cherries.

Super easy and delicious! I used 1/2 each light and dark brown sugars for more color, and a little less than called for.  Used my cast iron skillet and it took about 45 mins. to bake.

Came out perfectly!  I didn't have a cast-iron skillet, so just did it in a 9x13 pyrex pan and it came out great.  I put the pan in the microwave to melt the butter... it was delicious... and SO EASY!  I can't wait to make it again :)

OMG! This was the first pineapple upside down cake I had ever made, not sure why. This was soooo easy and soooo delicious. We started eating it the minute I turned it out of the skillet. We had vanilla ice cream with it while it was still warm and YUMMYYY!!! I will never make one in a regular cake pan after this.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

A keeper! Baked it for my moms 78th birthday cake. She loved it and so did all the guest! The changes I made was substituting all liquid requested on cake mix box with the reserved juice from the can of sliced pineapples and a can of crushed pineapple. I sprinkled the crushed pineapple over the top of the cake batter before putting it in the oven to bake.  It was deliciously moist and makes a great presentation!

This recipe is simple and delicious. My only suggestion, and believe me, it makes a world of difference, is that instead of using regular brown sugar; I used brown sugar cane. It comes in hard round balls. You can find this in any tropical, or latin grocery store. And also, scramble it, don't grind it fine. It is truly delicious. Use two and half cups instead of what the recipe calls. Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I didn't have a cast iron skillet so I used the regular 9x13 pan.  I also used the Duncan Hines pineapple cake mix.  It came out looking so good.  I thought it was too pretty to eat!  I will definitely make this again.

This is how I always have made pineapple upside down cake; in the cast iron skillet is a must.  The only thing I change is I add some slivered almonds with the butter and brown sugar mix. Just adds a little something extra.  Yum!

Great recipe. It so easy. I don't use a skillet, I use an 13x9 pan. I also sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg on top of the pinapples before adding the cake on top.

Excellent cake...Add pecans to bring it over the top!  It really is the easiest cake to make, and it is SO impressive to company.  They think you did something very special for them.  I use a yellow cake mix, and if I am making it for just the family I use crushed pineapple (less presentation, more pineapply :)  I also ALWAYS use pecans in the topping. This is very nearly the recipe I have been using since I was twelve from a kids cookbook.  Thank you.

really yummy. It was light, and fresh and sweet without being too sweet. Oh and EASY! I'm not a fan of the bright red cherries so I put normal ones in instead which worked well. I forgot to substitute some pinapple juice for liquid in the batter, which I will try next time as I imagine it will tie it in nicely together, to keep the flavour consistant. Thanks. PS can't load a pic cause it was all gobbled up before I could get my camera out! haha

This turned out really good! I cut the sugar to 1 cup & used yellow cake mix. Also used 1 cup of the pineapple juice instead of water in the cake mix. This made a sweet, very moist cake. Next time I will use crushed pineapple instead.

I made this cake today, The topping is a lot sweeter than I had plannned but the cake is very good.  I will make it again but cut the brown sugar to more like 1/2 cup instead of 1 1/2.  I wondered if this could be an error as it is very, very sweet.

For some reason, I always thought that making a pineapple upside-down cake was hard, but this proved me wrong! Not only did it turn out beautifully, it tasted like a homemade cake. Thank you for proving me wrong!

I made the recipe exactly as directed and had negative results.  The center was very uncooked so I had to bake it another 20 minutes to get it done, so the result was mush. On to another recipe!

OMG! This recipe is awesome. I took the advice of others and made it in a 9x13 pan.  Used about half the amount of water with the other being pineapple juice. It was great!!!! And yes like the others as soon as it comes out of the oven flip it over and remove it from the pan. I waited to long and the center stuck a little. But in all a great recipe and i'll be making it again.

All in all this was good, nice flavor. I thought it was a little too wet. Plus, my cooking time took about 7 minutes longer.

Made this in a 9x13 pan.  Had no cherries.  Everyone loved it!!  Make sure you use butter with the brown sugar -- makes it extra scrumptious.  Even hubby, who doesn't like sweets, said it was good.  We will make again..

Made this in a 9x13 pan and it came out looking so impressive! My family said it not only looked great and it tasted a million times better! I used a vanilla cake mix since that's what I had on hand and it was awesome.  Only think was the cake was about to break when i turned it upside down. If anyone can give me tips to avoid that next time i will appreciate it.

I make this recipe all the time for my girlfriend. It's so good. I like rum soaking the pineapples as well. Really makes it good when you substitute the water with pineapple juice in the cake recipe. I also use pineapple cake mix. Thank you for this recipe.

I used yellow cake mix instead white as that was what I had on hand. I also substituted a quarter of the water and the other three-quarters I used pineapple juice with the cake mix  I didn't want my cake to be too sweet so I used only 6T of butter and 1/2cup brown sugar for the "upside down" part of the cake.  It turned out beautiful in my cast iron and   tastes perfectly!  Thanks for great recipe!

This is the best pineapple upside down cake I have ever made.  Based on other reviews, I used a skillet and sprayed it with non-stick cooking spray before melting the butter. Used all pineapple juice for the liquids and also used Fudge Marble Cake Mix. It turned out perfect and didn't stick to the skillet at all.

Followed the directions and even used the pinapple juice for the water in the cake mix. Did not like this at all. Found it too dry for my taste.

This was really really good.  I used the juice from my pineapples in the cake batter as someone suggested, but couldn't taste a difference.  I also baked it in a 9x13 dish and it was excellent.

I had to cook this cake over an hour in my cast iron skillet to get the center firm. I agree with reviewer SMALLIE81 (Jan 01) that it really looked burnt, not nice looking at all. I did find a pineapple upside down cake mix & used that instead of a white cake mix. Probably keep looking for other recipes.

This was very good.  I cooked the sugar/butter first to help it carmalize a bit and patted the pineapples dry before adding them.

AWESOME! So yummy, I took the suggestions to add the juice and i added a bunch of extra cherries and yellow cake - it was so EASY and good I can't believe it! I took a picture because it was so pretty, I will definitely make this for company hot & fresh to show off a bit! ;)

This was amazing!  I used an iron skillet and that made for an easy recipe. For some reason our cast iron was not big enough for the cake so I ended up making 6 cupcakes as well.  I used a yellow cake mix and a fresh pineapple (cut into chunks) and I didn't use cherries cause I didn't have any.  Came out easy and was really delicious.

This was a delicious recipe and very easy to make.  I used the tips from one of the reviews and used the pineapple juice in place of half the water.  I also used a yellow cake mix just for the color.  My little brother ate most of it by himself and he typically will not eat deserts with pineapple in it.  :)

I have made this cake twice this week because I had PUDC over Christmas at my families house. The cake tastes okay, but it doesn't look anything like the pictures-mine is very dark, almost burnt looking. But, the cake is not burnt!! Perhaps it is because of the dark brown sugar?!Maybe I am supposed to use light brown? The cake is done and not overcooked, but both times it came out burnt looking. I really want to make this cake, and have it presentable!!

Good recipe IF you put the pineapple juice in instead of the other liquid in the cake mix.  If you forget, it just isn't the same.  *grin*.

Oh my goodness! I never cared for pineapple upside down cake, but my daughter wanted a laua for her birthday party so it fit the theme. It is simply scrumptious. The smell is enticing and the taste matches. I couldn't recommend this more.

The taste is AMAZING!!  I had a problem with the cake sticking to the pan and it looked like a mess when I tried to flip it out.  Any ideas on what I did wrong??  I want to make this again since my Mom, Dad, Hubby and Uncle went crazy over this cake last night.

I had to bake six cakes for a dinner and I wanted a fool-proof, simple and tasty cake. This recipe fitted that to a tee! I just melted the butter in a microwave and poured into the baking pan, instead of heating the whole skillet up. The cake was popular amongst my guests and one even requested to take home almost half an entire cake!

The recipe was excellent. Using the pineapple juice in the cake mix was a very smart idea. I used yellow cake mix instead of white and used a metal baking pan instead of a skillet. I think next time I make it, I'll put more cherries on it (requested by my hubby).

Sorry to go against so many rave reviews but...maybe I'm just not a big fan of pineapple upside down cake. This cake was just so-so to me. I don't think I'll make this one again.

Pros: 
Easy to make.
Only a few ingredients.

Cons: 
Too sweet (I even cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup)
Tastes like box cake
Requires a large skillet

This was the most moist cake ever.  My whole family loved it.  We followed the input of others and substituted some of the pineapple juice for water.  Very easy to make and will be a staple for our family.

This is a great recipe we loved it and I am not a cake eater but a good pineapple upside down cake is my exception. The next time we make it we will use all pineapple juice and cake from scratch and let you know.

My husband loves pineapple upside-down cake, and this was the best recipe I've tried so far. I followed the recipe exactly as is. It turned out beautiful, and was very moist. I did have a little batter left over, but not a lot. I will be making this one over and over! Thanks for the recipe!

We liked this quite a bit, but decided the cake mix made it taste too commercial.  Next time I make this, I'll use my Nana's cottage pudding recipe (which I'll be posting on the site soon)for the cake.  The topping was absolutely delicious, and the cake was as pretty as a pineapple!

Perfect!  Next time I will make two.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, and I used lemon cake mix, because that was what was in the cabinet.  Thank you.

This recipe was ok.  While I definately earns point for being so easy, I think I'll stick to my previous recipe (Betty Crocker's).  This recipe was a little too sweet for my taste.  Also you could tell it used boxed cake mix - making it from stratch has a different texture.

Great recipe- got rave reviews from my brother, a pineapple upside-down cake expert! I followed the suggestion to decrease the amount of sugar, used 3/4 to 1 cup. Just the right sweetness and a moist (but not mushy) cake.

Just like Grandma used to make!  I have an 11 inch skillet so I used two boxes of cake mix.  I filled the skillet a little over halfway and then used the remainder of the batter to make some cupcakes.  Turned out great!

This was my first Pineapple Upside-Down cake, and it was beautiful! We did not eat it until the second day, so it was a bit soggy. Will make again and eat it on day one!

The hubby was a little skeptical when he saw it in an iron skillet.  But, after tasting it, he & the kids admitted that it was the best pineapple upside down cake that they've had!  Made a couple of changes, though.  I used crushed pineapple instead of rings, used only 3/4 C. - 1 C. of brown sugar & had to bake it a little longer (toothpick doneness).  

I just made a second one going by the actual directions & have decided that I'll stick with my changes. There's way too much brown sugar & it spills over in the oven.  The first one was much better. Still a very good basic recipe!  Thanks Anne!!

Delicious!  I replaced all water with pineapple juice and used dark brown sugar.  Cake came out moist and sweet and my husband loved it.

Yummy. I made in cast iron skillet which gave a darker color but family loved it. Lots of extra cherries too.
