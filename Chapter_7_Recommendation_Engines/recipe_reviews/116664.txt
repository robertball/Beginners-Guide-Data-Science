These are good and really fun to make!  The dough smells wonderful.  I left out the dried fruit.  The icing is really thick and it piped out beautifully.  I doubled the recipe and made 12 buns, but I'm thinking I should have made about 15, because the buns turned out a little too big.  ;)  They rose beautifully- very high.  I used 1/3 cup white whole wheat flour in this recipe with great results.

This was a great and easy recipe.  And I loved that it only made 6...perfect for me!  I didn't have any currants, so I substituted with cranberries.  And I also chopped the raisins and cranberries so they presences wasn't as obvious in the finished rolls.  I also added about 1 t orange zest.  Not sure why, but I had to make a double batch of the icing.  I will make these again!

Mmmmm, so good! I've never made hot cross buns before and these turned out great. I used a candied fruit mix and raisins. I doubled the recipe and it made 2 dozen dinner roll-sized buns. Perfect for Easter!

Just made these buns for Easter and had to taste them.  Absolutely yummy.  And, great for the small family.  I added extra raisins, craisins and some citron fruitcake mix.  All the other recipes seem to make a huge amount and this was just right for the 2 of us.  I'll definitely be making them again soon.  My husband ate 3 at one sitting!

I usually have difficulty with yeast bread but found this easy to make. Perfect size recipe, only change was using all raisins because I couldn't get the currants. I also ended up doubling the icing...just like sweets!My husband really enjoyed these and I'll make them again, hopefully with currants this time : )

Best yeast anything I've ever made! These are simply delicious.  I omitted the all spice and raisins so I used twice as many currants. Sooo delicious hot out of the oven with butter and salt. I can't wait to have these with our Easter dinner tomorrow with the frosting!

These were ok, but I'm bumping up my rating from 3 to 4 stars because I know I have difficulty working with yeast breads, especially when doing it by hand.  The buns came out much denser and heavier than I was expecting - the hot cross buns we've had are very light and airy.  I totally changed the flavor by using dried cranberries and blueberries and omitting the allspice and adding a little nutmeg.  In my case, a little orange zest would have worked nicely, but the texture of the bread itself was not what I was hoping for.  I may adapt this to my bread machine - which has more experience kneading dough than I do! - to see if it comes out lighter.

Very good, surprisingly light and fluffy.  As others have said, you have to double the icing recipe.  I left out the fruit and allspice because I'm not a fan and used soy milk instead of dairy milk.  They're very good but if I make them again, I'll add more cinnamon and leave the vanilla out of the icing (it gives it an odd taste).  The "prep time" is an error because it forgets the hour and a half of rising that needs to be done which seriously threw me off!  I only picked this recipe because of the short prep time then I got to the rising and..... sigh.  Oh well!

I was very pleased with how these buns turned out. I knew it wouldn't be enough so I multiplied it by four. My husband didn't think they were fruity enough so I added more fruit the second time. Because I generally make recipes in larger quantities I found it helpful and quicker to snip the crosses on top with kitchen scissors.

I made this recipe for Easter as my husband told me he loved hot cross buns. These were superb!  It will be my recipe for anytime we feel like Hot Cross Bus!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe. It only makes 6 which is perfect for myself and my 6 year old - a fussy eater who also loves this recipe. The buns were light and airy and slightly sweet. They smell great and taste good enough to eat without any icing. I should say that I had to make this recipe twice as I got the milk too hot the first time and those buns took hours to rise and never got quite as light as the second batch where the milk was the right temperature. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made the dough in my food processor.  I had to add a bit more flour to get the right consistency (but I live in a humid climate, so that's normal.). I let the dough rise abou 90 minutes on the first rise. The buns  had a great texture and taste.  I will be using this recipenoften.  Thanks.

Ah-maze-ing! I doubled the recipe and added coconut milk (real milk from the dried coconut - blend hardened pulp with water and squeeze out the milk!).  This yielded 6 circular disposable foil pans of mini buns (6 each). i used less sugar and some melted mini marshmallows in shortening too but you have to be very careful, it gets pretty hot so i added boiling water and quickly stirred till it became more manageable. Add only when cooled.  It was the first time i tried it and everyone said it was so tasty and moist. It made cute gifts, when cooled just cover with the transparent lids. We gave them as gifts today, Holy Thursday.  Will definitely try again. Thank you Barbara!

These were very good, but I had to add a good bit of extra flour to make the dough workable. As written, the dough was very soft. I added about 1/2 cup of extra flour.

Nice...I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and currants, and the flavor was nice. When they came out of the oven, I tasted one and noticed a slight yeast flavor, but when it was slabbed with jam and margarine, the yeast taste was covered up. I also needed to add one of the four teaspoons of sugar to the yeast and milk mixture to proof the yeast. My husband who says he is a hot cross bun connoisseur, said they were "pretty good."

Really enjoyed this recipe... The dough rose beautifully and made a light bun.  The only changes I made were using all currants (personal preference) and cutting the dough into 8 buns rather than six. Exactly what I was looking for!

I loved this recipe. I grow up with my mom making hot cross buns and now I can make them for my family. They are so easy to put together. The only thing i can add is that i had to add and extra 1/2 cup of flour to get the buns to come together.

I made a batch of this tonight and my company really enjoyed them. Like another poster, I only added the raisins (no currants or other fruit because my family doesn't like it). I chose this recipe because it only made 6 and others had left out the currants too. These are delicious. I did not make the icing cross either, just cut them to show the cross and they were very delicious. This is a great recipe for those concerned about sugar intake as it is quite low but still a treat. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I did without the allspice and used cardamom instead - just a personal preference.  I also doubled the recipe and ended up with 18 buns.

good taste. Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with somewhat flat biscuits. 3 stars since the taste was good - and I concede some cook error/fault.

I just made these (a double recipe).  I added zest of lemon and zest of orange and instead of currants I used dried blueberries.  They are fabulous.  I will make them again - and won't even wait for another Easter.

These were ok. They needed more spices and raisins/currants. Adding candied peel would improve them too. The recipe said to use "softened" butter, but really you need to use melted butter. Also the recipes says the buns will be "Ready in: 45 minutes". It doesn't take into account the rising time! You have to add on an extra 1.5 hours for that.  Like others, I also had to double the icing recipe for the crosses.

I didn't like it. I thought it tasted too yeasty and there wasn't enough flour. I am going to find a different recipe.
