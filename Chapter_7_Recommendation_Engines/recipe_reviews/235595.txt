This is a tried and true method for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs... and the only method I've used for years.  (I used to struggle mightily to hard-cook a decent egg.)  For those who are complaining about the yolks being undercooked, perhaps you are starting your 17-minute timing a bit prematurely.  One should wait until the eggs themselves start to "dance" on the bottom of the pan; this is the exact time to turn off the heat, cover, and set your timer for exactly 17 minutes.  Do not remove the saucepan from the burner; I believe the residual heat to be an essential part of completing the process correctly.  Oh, and following these directions explicitly has always produced eggs that are easy to peel... but only after complete cooling, and I never use fresh eggs... only those that have been in the fridge for at least a week.  (After cooling according to the directions posted in Chef John's recipe, I usually cool them in the fridge for at least an additional hour before peeling.)  I hope these suggestions are helpful to others.

This recipe completely failed me. I followed the video exactly. When I cracked one open this morning for breakfast, it collapsed in a puddle. So disappointed, because that means I have five more failures in the fridge at home! UPDATE: The third time I made this recipe was a charm! Turned out, my eggs were not dancing violently enough before I turned off the heat per Chef John's suggestion in the video. One person's simmer is another person's boil, apparently. I suggest to others who had my same initial outcome (sad eggs) to try this recipe again and do not shut off the heat until you think you've reached a boil, as I bet we share the same misconception of what "simmer" means. Thanks, Chef John!

For those who've had trouble with the white sticking to the shell, the problem is not with the recipe...it's that the eggs are too fresh!  You should buy your eggs about a week ahead of the time you want to boil them, and let them sit in the refrigerator (do check the date on the eggs to make sure they will still be fresh enough to cook).  The longer the eggs sit in the fridge, the easier they will be to peel.

This recipe is great, this is how I've been making eggs my whole life, passed down from many generations. The only problem I have with it is not quite enough water and not a hard enough boil before removing from the heat source. The water should be an inch higher than the eggs in the pot, not just covering them and the water should be boiling violently. I can see why so many on here have had uncooked eggs and it's because there's not enough water to retain the heat properly. Also, the best trick I've ever gotten for peeling eggs came from my brother-in-law. If you use a small spoon (can't be too deep, the flatter the better) and after cooling the eggs and then smacking them all over to loosen the shell just peel a small part so you can insert the spoon under the membrane and gently turn the spoon and lift off the shell. Works perfectly everytime and I never have ugly eggs, no matter how fresh they are!

After following the directions as listed, I was very disappointed with how the eggs turned out.  The whites clung to the shell and the yolks were barely hard...resembling cool molasses.  This is not a recipe I'd save.

I didn't know how *wrong* my eggs were until I made them the right way.  These were not green, they were not rubbery, and creamy is exactly how I'd describe them.  Just a simple change in technique has turned a food I never touched into a favorite snack.  Thanks for teaching us the basics, Chef John!

This was a fail for me.  My eggs turned out like soft-boiled eggs -- runny centers.  No way would they make deviled eggs!  I have a couple of thoughts:  One reviewer says "I bet we share the same misconception of what "simmer" means". Perhaps, but the video very clearly depicted a very mild simmer.  The eggs might have been just starting to "dance", but they were not "violently dancing" as another reviewer suggests they should.  The other comment that I think makes some sense is to not remove the pan from the burner because the residual heat helps to cook them.  That only works if you are using an electric cooktop. Gas cooktops don't retain enough heat. 

This is similar to the technique I have used for years from my old Betty Crocker Cookbook which says to bring the eggs and cold water to a boil quickly and then cover and remove from heat.  Let them stand 22 to 24 minutes.  I tried Chef John's timing this time.  I won't be using it again.

Great recipe
1. Eggs have to be a week old not new eggs 
2. Bring the water to a complete boil 
3. Keep on the same burner after you turn off the heat 
4. Using the same burners cooks the eggs
5. Start the timer after you turn off the heat 
6. Enjoy 
I drained the eggs after 17 minutes added cold water and ice and let them sit for 10 minutes. 
This is a great recipe. I use for it in culinary school years ago

This has to be THE worst way to make hard-boiled eggs.  Came out anything but. Wound  up with  severely runny yolks and whites.  Couldn't even call it soft-boiled eggs.  You, sir, should learn to write a recipe correctly before posting them..people rely on details when it comes to helping them learn to cook.  BTW, followed  the recipe to a tee.  I signed up just so I could post this..very upset.

It's important to specify that you actually take the pot off of the heat. I have an electric stove and the burner stays hot. So merely turning off the heat is not the same as on a gas stove.

Has worked everytime so far. I add salt to the water and that helps peel the eggs later and also avoid cracking while getting to that boil. I always make a couple extra eggs and test one.  If not done just cook it longer.

My mother in law taught me to make my eggs like this about 25 years ago.  And they have always been cooked perfectly.  Peeling sometimes have been a problem.  So recently, I read to cool the eggs covered in ice water for about  20 - 30 minutes.  Since  making that small change almost all my eggs peel perfectly. I have read about others who have problems with this method and I don't understand it. (Oh yeah, I was taught to bring to a roaring boil, place lid on, turn off and set timer for 15 minutes) and then drain. My 25 year old son made these while I was in the kitchen (not paying attention to what he was doing)  just giving him instructions, while I worked on something else. They turned out with the white half done and yolk raw. So I threw them away and told HIM to give me the instructions I had just given him and the same thing happened again.  I threw them away, again. But when I did them myself they were fine, so I understand some people's frustration.  I'm not sure why this is happening!!

My eggs came out perfectly! Instead of draining the water the second time, I added ice to the water to cool the eggs further.

The first time I made it, it turned out horrible. I realized that it was because I removed them from the burner. WAIT UNTIL THEY START TO "DANCE", then cover them up and DO NOT remove them from the burner. Leave them for 17 minutes. After that, rinse them with cold water and let them sit for 20 minutes. To peel them easily, crack them and roll it and the shell should come off right away.

Never had hard boiled eggs go wrong until following this. Brought them to a good simmer,  covered pan, forgot about for 17 minutes and they were not done inside.

Perfect hardboiled Eggs!

I followed the directions at first and I tested one egg. That egg was runny in the middle. I took the remaining eggs and started cooking directions again, this time I boiled the eggs for about 5 minutes, resulting in perfectly hard boiled eggs. 

I suggest to be sure to boil eggs for about 5 minutes after the first strong simmering occurs. And before turning off the high heat burner for the 17 minute burner off period.

Never, ever fails!  I've been using this "hack" for over 30 years with always perfect results.  The only other "trick" to it is make sure your eggs are NOT fresh.  They will stick to the shell!

This did not work at all.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Cracked the eggs and they dribbled out 4 tablespoons of jellied clear liquid and uncooked yolk.  Not sure what is accomplished by turning off the heat.  Eggs can be easily hard boiled by leaving the heat on and boiling for 12 minutes.  Faster, far more effective, and less yuck at the end.

I live at a mile high, and have tried many foolproof recipes over the years. This one actually works! Also, the shell practically peeled itself, and no pits or breaks in the white. Perfect every time. Thank you!

Hard to peel. The tender whites tore off and the yoke was under cooked. I used fresh eggs by the way.

Wow, I’ve always struggled to make good hb eggs and these turned out exactly as described. The shells practically fell away and the eggs were delicious and buttery. FYI- my eggs were not fresh, they were almost 2 wks old. I won’t use any other recipe!

Best recipe so far for my deviled eggs which depend on the peels coming off. In addition, I always use older eggs (I buy them at least 7 days ahead) and I peel the shells by first rolling the egg on the counter pressing gently with my hand, cracking the shell all over and then peeling. This works for me. The shells will almost always come right off. But not every egg, all of the time. Nature is inconsistent, so I always boil 2 or 3 extra eggs than what I need to compensate.

These are the best and easiest to peel hard boiled eggs I've tried.  I took the advice of several reviewers and made sure the water was REALLY boiling before I turned it off.  I also placed my eggs in an ice bath after the initial cold rinse.  They were perfectly cooked and peeled wonderfully.  I peeled mine by shaking it around in a plastic container with a bit of water.  Worked great!

I followed the directions exactly, and my hard boiled eggs turned out PERFECT! The whites had the perfect consistency, and the yolk was solid yellow and just the right texture. The shells peeled off quickly and easily. Just follow the recipe and it works!

Followed the recipe exactly and they were very soft and hard to peel, taking the shell off removed half the egg with it no matter what I did and the texture was odd. I'm probably throwing the rest away.

I Love Chef John but this method does not work. I measured the temp with a thermometer on Simmer as noted and still after 17 minutes the eggs were liguid. I will stick to the old fashioned boil for 4-5 minutes and let sit for a few method.

These came out great. I’m at high altitude so I let the eggs rest for 19 minutes after simmering instead of 17. Followed all directions and the eggs came out cooked with no green surface on the yolks. Some eggshells came off easily and some didn’t— even though I let them cool for 30 minutes and they were a week old, but not a big deal.

Nailed it! After reading the reviews, I went with the "rolling boil" instead of the "simmer". Recommended times were adhered to strictly.  The eggs were relatively fresh (15 days prior to sell by date) and peeled easy by hand. Thanks Chef John!

Wow, It was so easy and made perfect Hard boiled eggs. I made Avocado Egg Salad sandwiches for my 3 sons this morning and they all replied in favor!  So simple so easy all you need to do is follow basic instructions and you will get perfect hard boiled eggs just like I did! I can see it becoming the way I make Hard Boiled eggs.

This is my new favorite way to boil eggs! This is the first time I haven't had cracked eggs or sticky peels. The shell slid right off after being in ice cold water. I did get it to a rolling boil before I turned off the burner. I also left it on the hot burner. I tested one first just in case. It came out perfectly cooked with a firm but not too firm yellow yolk. I uploaded a picture.

I have used a similar technique to hard cook eggs for years and, although I bring the water to a full bubbling boil and leave mine for 20 minutes instead of the 17 shown, I have made batches from four to 24 eggs at a time on both gas and electric ranges with only one failure. The trick I have found also seems to explain the failure; I make sure the pot is large enough to cover the eggs with at least one inch of water before starting and that I use a heavy weight pot (my current set has a heat spreading disk in the base and adds extra heat holding capacity along with the water to cook the eggs after the heat is turned off). My failure was in an aluminum camping  pot, barely enough room for the correct water and no heat holding in the pot and the water just cooled down too fast to fully cook the eggs from the retained heat. I hope this helps explain what others may be dealing with!

This worked perfectly for me.  I thought the best suggestion was to "wait for the eggs to dance in the bottom of the pan" before shutting off the heat. It was not easy to tell when the "simmering" had started.  The eggs came out perfect and were so easy to peel.  Thanks for the great tips.

My eggs came out pretty much completely raw. The outside of the whites were cooked, but the yolk and middle of the whites were completely liquid. I brought the rest of them back up to a boil and let them boil for a while, then sit for about 10 more minutes. After that they were pretty much what he described, but the whites stuck to the shell. Definitely won't make these again.

Worked for me! But some of my eggs were hard to peel... Could be the recipe or the age of the eggs? I may try the other recipe that does ice water then boiling again then ice...

I am awful at making hard boiled eggs even though it's seemingly easy, but this recipe helped me make the best batch I've ever made! And peeling the eggs under cold water was easy and fast, no frustrations.

Excellent recipe. I’ve been making boiled eggs for over thirty years. I never knew I was making them all wrong. I followed this recipe and my eggs came out perfect or exactly as the recipe said they would. The yolk was creamy and perfect color. They taste delicious!

Such a simple thing that is always hit or miss with me. I followed this exactly except did 12 eggs. Still had a bit of green and were very hard to peel. I lose a ton of white just trying to peel them. These were also brand new eggs straight from the grocery. My results are probably due to freshness.

I followed this recipe to the letter, just added salt and apple cider vinegar to the water. They not only came out perfect, but peeled perfectly as well. First time in my life THAT ever happened!

In the past, my hard boiled eggs came out inconsistently so I was looking forward to trying this method out. It worked beautifully. I still had a hard time with the peeling but it was not nearly as bad as in the past. Will definitely use this method in the future.

Made these today to dye for Easter. Used an electric stove and 3/4” of water covering the eggs. Once the eggs were really dancing along the bottom of the pot I covered them, turned off the heat and set a timer for 17 min. I( left the pot on the burner. ) I transferred them to a bowl of cold water for 20 minutes and then peeled one to check. Done PERFECTLY! And so easy to peel.

This is exactly the same as my grandma's (born 1867) recipe that she inherited from her mom.  It works perfectly every time.  Be sure to cool quickly with cold water immediately after the boiling is done.  It will result in easily peeled boiled eggs that are perfect.

I followed the instructions as closely as I could. The eggs were like glued to the shell. The yolks also stuck to the inside of the eggs. I have never in my life had this much trouble pealing a hard boiled egg. I will never and I do mean NEVER use this method again!!!!!

Have to agree with other comments on here- not a good recipe. I waited til the water simmered & the eggs started to “dance” on the bottom, turned off burner, covered & left for 17 minutes, then rinsed. All six were unusable. In full disclosure, I buy my eggs from a local farm so perhaps the comment about eggs being too fresh is accurate.

The eggs came out great... perfect yellow inside . I waited until the eggs were dancing before turning off the heat and left the eggs on the burner for the residual heat,as another cook recommended. There were light with a perfect yolk... yummy!

I've done boiled eggs like this for several years now, it's the only way to go. No ugly grey/green ring. They come out perfect every time. The only thing that I do differently is that I crack the shell when I put them into the cold water, and I do that because I have hens and the freshest of eggs. It makes fresh eggs easier to peel.

More like soft boiled eggs. You need more water and bring pot to a rolling boil then remove from heat, still covered for 15 minutes.

Just wasted half a dozen eggs and an hour of my time ?? As other reviewers have mentioned, there are different interpretations of “simmer”. Instructions should be updated with more specific details. It would have been helpful to know that the eggs should be “dancing” in the pan (which I interpret as a boil). Probably won’t risk this one again.

So bummed! I always have over cooked boiled eggs that are hard to peel so I have been researching and found this video how to. 
I didn't think to test it on a couple of eggs first. I put all 14 in there for my Christmas meal prep after I couldn't peel about 8 of them without the soft whites just peeling right off I decided to cut one open to see if I could at least use them in my dressing. Umm No! They were not fully cook and far from the Perfect Boiled Egg as the video states. Thank goodness I have time to go buy more eggs. Would rather have overcooked then under cooked. I really wanted this to work :(

This did not work.  I followed the directions as written. when I tried to peel the eggs the white and shell would not separate.  this yielded an awful looking egg. I was boiling eggs for pickleing  and to make deviled eggs and wanted the eggs to be smooth and appetizing looking.

When I first cooked them like this the eggs cooked perfectly but didn't peel well.. After talking with other cooks, I learned to put a tsp, of baking soda in the water, don't overcrowd the pan, and when they are cool enough to handle crack  the fat end of the egg and let them finish cooling.

You have to stand there and wait for the water to boil. I like to boil for 12 minutes then place the eggs in an ice water bath.  Eggs are perfectly boiled and peel perfectly as well.

Not the most efficient way for boiling eggs, as this recipe does take a long time from start to finish. However, I tried it. And it really does produce some quality, creamy-yolk, just-the-perfect-texture hard boiled eggs. So if you have the time, I recommend!

Who has an hour to hard boil eggs? Plus, waiting this long before shelling them makes them too cold to melt butter.

Yes, this method is OK, but the perfect way to make hard boiled eggs is to steam them in a rack.  The eggs are not in the water; the immediate plunge into cold water is the same, but with the steamer rack, the shells just slide off!  I'll never go back to the boil-in-water method!

I followed this recipe to the letter but none of the eggs were cooked! They were pretty much raw when cracked! Wasted a dozen eggs, thank you very much ??!

Comes out perfect! I always add one cup white vinegar to the water (before boiling) to change the pH which makes the eggs much easier to peel.

I had seen a different method on allrecipes that was just 9 minutes, but couldn't find it. I let the water get to a rolling boil before turning off heat and covering. After 9ish minutes, I ran under cool water, but then moved to ice bath for 15-20 min.  Easy peel, evenly cooked yolks, and perfect whites! Thanks Chef John and "unknown contributor"!

I could never get hard boiled eggs with a completely yellow yolk. Yolks always had a green color on the outside and were powdery.  Now I've got it!!  One important note: WATCH THE VIDEO! It will show you exactly when to turn off the heat. I've turned heat off too early and too late, but once I understood how to spot a "dancing egg" it's a success every time.

If the egg is hard-boiled, it will spin gracefully and smoothly. A raw egg will wobble because the whites and yolk aren't firmed up, so the center of gravity is shifting as it spins, causing the wobble. Science is cool.

Yolks were slightly undercooked,  like ramen eggs. I've used a variation of this method for years and here are some tips to avoid failure.  Use large eggs at room temperature; leave them out overnight.  Fresh eggs are more difficult to peel, use older eggs and ice water for standing, replacing the ice as it melts. This time and temperature is for sea level - so if you're at altitude - adjust.

This is close to the Jillian Michaels method to not making rubbery hard-boiled eggs.  If you bring to a boil and then turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes, rinse with cold and store, they aren't rubbery.  Not sure about 17 minutes.  Maybe someone can post the difference between consistency at shut off intervals

I boiled 15 eggs in a stockpot, and followed the recipe as stated. The eggs did not peel well, I only had 2 eggs that peeled perfectly and I found that the whites were undercooked.  I find that if I put the eggs in cold water covered completely, and leave them in 20 minutes after the water starts boiling then cool them I get half that peel well and then just give the rest to my dogs. I don’t honestly know of a tried and true way of boiling perfectly boiled where the shell comes off no problem eggs.

I know that many of the comments claim to be "tried and true" but this method leaves NOTHING to chance. Put  a couple-three inches of water in a saucepan and put on stove over high heat. In the meantime, put your eggs in a bowl and cover with hot water.  When the water is at a rolling boil, transfer the eggs to the pan and IMMEDIATELY set the timer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, place the pan in the sink and run cold water over them. That's it......easy-peasy!

This did work very well for me. I'm sure that the goal is to have the simplest possible recipe. However, if the results are so variable among cooks, clearly there are too many things varying between people's efforts  to cook the eggs to enable us to have reliable results. Most of those things that vary are unmeasured.  Variables: rate of  heat production by the burner at maximum; rate of heat absorption by the metal of the pot, rate of heat transfer to the water, surface area of water allowing heat to escape into the air,  rate of heat transfer from water into egg, age of egg, size of egg,  and perhaps even age and breed of hen.  Do you put in salt? Vinegar? What is the temperature at the center of the water of the pot when you turn the heat off? At the side of the pot?  212 F? Are all the eggs around the edge of the pot  and in contact with the metal?  Some in the middle? What I did was use salt and vinegar (why not?). Before cooking,  I turned the eggs on  their sides for 15 minutes, on their heads for 15 minutes as a member suggested, to center the yolks. I put pinholes in the top of the eggs (the end that floats) with a needle as my mother taught me, to stop the eggs from cracking. And to watch the bubbles come out as the eggs heated up. I put the 12 eggs in a Farberware 6.5 qt stainless steel pot with water up to 1 inch over the eggs, on an electric burner 2700 BTU on high. When the water was boiling my eggs did not dance. I covered the pot, turned the burner off, and le

I did exactly what the recipe calls for and exactly what the chef says....shut heat off just when it starts simmering.  He specifically said not boiling.  So I normally make them boil but instead did this as it read.  Huge fail!  8 eggs in the trash.....they were not cooked nearly enough.  Very disappointed in the verbiage in this recipe and by the chef.

I simmered and cooled the eggs for longer than the recipe suggested and they were still not solid when I cracked them.

I wouldn't make a change in this recipe, but I must stress that the eggs need to be at least 5 days old. The older, the better. The only problem I had this time was that my eggs were too fresh and the eggs did not peel perfectly. What was the difference? The first time my eggs have been in the fridge over a week. The second time? Take a guess.

Not nearly done. I should have known. It didn't seem like long enough to cook them.  Maybe his idea is "just starting to simmer" is different than mine.

This actually turned out nice! Although at the very end instead of just putting cold water in, I filled a bowl with ice water and placed the eggs in them. I think if I waited a little longer to take them out of the ice water it would've been easier to take out.

I was very pleased with how these turned out. I'm very picky with my eggs and would almost rather have them be overcooked, and rubbery, than runny. These were perfect. I did a whole carton so my husband can grab some and go on his way to work and he'll be super happy with em. Thank you.

Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't buy that it's the eggs being too fresh. All eggs you buy at the grocery store are weeks old by the time you get them. Nothing fresh about them LOL

I followed the instructions exactly, and the eggs were definitely not done.  I've used a similar recipe previously that instructed to bring the water to a boil, and that worked.  Either the type of stove and/or the interpretation of simmering must be a variable...

Followed directions perfectly and all of our easter eggs were under cooked and ruined. This recipe is not safe. Undercooked. Whites not fully cooked and yokes not fully cooked. Your recipe ruined Easter breakfast for my four chiildren. Horrible. Never will use "all recipes" again! We could have gotten very sick. Used grade A large eggs. NOT SAFE!!! DO NOT USE!!! The review posted about people complaining about undercooked yokes, I did exactly as instructions followed "wait for bottom eggs to dance", "residual heat" ...undercooked whites and yokes and could not peel them at all!!! Your method does not work. Climb off your high horse. Remove this unsafe recipe.

I followed this recipe to the T and my eggs came out runny.  I only found out when I accidentally dropped one on the floor while hiding it.  GROSS!  I was really disappointed as my husband really wanted egg salad.  I would recommend bringing the eggs to a hard boil rather than simmering and let it sit for 20 minutes.

If I could have a rating for 0 stars, then I would rate it that way.  This method did NOT work.  I followed it to a "T".  When I went to peel the eggs, the shells were sticking and would not come off smoothly.  I ended up with out of a dozen eggs, only 4 that look decent.  The other 8 were peeled down to the yoke almost.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I now have to boil more eggs and I guess I am going to do it my own way!!!!  And yes, my eggs were about 2 weeks old.

Turned out great but like others said I let it get to a low boil rather than a "simmer" before turning off and covering. I also learned if you have the eggs in the cold water first and they lay on their sides they are too fresh, if the sink but stand up they are perfect to boil, if they float they are too old.

The eggs were not done at all when I followed the video exactly.  The whites were still runny along with the yolk.  I think it needs to come to a complete boil and not just a simmer.  I did reboil them because it better to try than throw them away.  I brought them to a full boil and let them sit with the lid on for 10 minutes immediately running under cold water.  The shells stuck to the egg, but it was fine for chopping up.

I think I'll go back to my own method of hard boiling eggs. I tried this using brand new fresh eggs. They were cooked through but I had a terrible time peeling them. They were a real mess. Not very appetizing looking for devilled eggs.

I followed the directions using 4 medium eggs.  Cooking elevation was 68 feet above sea level using gas burner.  Peeled one egg, the white was runny, the yolk soft.  I scrambled that egg to finish cooking it, and boiled the others to finish cooking them.

The eggs turn out cooked but the peeling doesn't always turn out well.  I have a new method that works every time.  Lower your eggs into boiling water with a teaspoon of baking soda and adjust to a simmer with light bubbles.  Set timer for 13 minutes.  When time is up, place eggs in an ice bath for 10 minutes.  Perfectly cooked eggs and extremely easy to peel!

This is a scam recipe and "chef john" reported to allrecipes. 
Don't waste your time, fuel, and eggs on this .
If you know how to boil water you should be fine hard-boiling eggs.

I guess size of pot matters or my definition of simmer must be different. Ended up with soft boiled useless eggs for my potato salad.
Awesome

This worked out perfectly. I could never get my eggs to peel. When following the recipe to the T they came out cooked all the way and peeled easily. Thank you

Followed the directions to the minute and it didn't work.  I threw 4 good eggs away.  If you are looking for a recipe for hard boiled eggs, keep looking.

I followed directions completely, and the eggs were just right as far as texture goes. As for peeling them...half peeled fine, and the other half were a mess as usual. I would sure like to peel them all successfully!

I am happy to report that my first time making hard boiled eggs was a success! Actually, it was better than. I kid u not. On a gas range, in a  GreenPan sauce pan,  I gently placed 7 brown Vital Farms pasture raised eggs into a saucepan. I covered them w cold water and heated.  I took the advice of waiting til the water started rolling before killing the flame and covering. I waited EXACTLY 17 mins before draining the hot water and replacing w cold. One thing I did do after the water change was immediately put the whole pan w eggs inside in the fridge for 20 mins.  The reason was because the eggs warmed the cold water I put in. Well, it worked. The eggs were not dry, the yolk was perfect but peel em under cold water cuz the shell was still a lil warm and sticky. Most hard boiled eggs I had are just plain dry. Not these. Seriously, best I ever had.

This is the worst hard boiled egg recipe. I followed the directions to a tee. The eggs were soft and runny. I did the whole recipe again with the same eggs and brought the water to a rolling boil the second time and let the  eggs sit for another 9 minutes in the water before cooling them . They are still runny. Nobody should ever make this recipe. I had to throw the eggs out.

I wasted 6 eggs. When I went to peel them under running water after cooling for 30 minutes it was a disaster. 
Maybe I should have put them in the fridge for a few hours and tried again?
Tried this again a few months later. 
Effing awful. 
Wasted another 8 eggs.
Not cooked nearly enough. 
Soft boiled eggs is what I got. 
Very frustrated :(

I did make these eggs as instructed with a little scepticism but to my dismay, I was pleasantly surprised how good they came out.  You made me a believer. I usally add eggs to my pot and cover with water and once the water begins to boil, I lower the heat to a simmer and time them for 15 minutes, remove from heat pour off hot water then add cold water and allow them to cool.

This is the only way I will cook hard boiled eggs now. I let them simmer for a minute just when you see the eggs start to jump shut the heat off and cover. DO NOT remove them from the burner. They peel really easily and taste great on their own!

I always had a problem with hard boiled eggs peeling nicely no matter how I cooked them.  Then I discovered hard boiled eggs made  in a pressure cooker and they peel perfectly.  The shell practically comes off in one piece!!!  I will never boil in a pot again!! I use the rice selection on my pressure cooker  for 6 minutes with about a quarter inch of water on bottom with eggs on the wire rack. I have made up to 18 eggs at a time and they come out perfectly. As soon as the timer goes off, release the pressure and immediately cool in ice water. No more ugly deviled eggs!

Made it according to instructions but had much egg white left with the shells -- couldn't really use. Suggest to change water during the cooling 20 mins time. Have used Martha Stewart's recipe before and worked better.

Came out perfect!!... i waited until the water was boiling, covered and turned off the heat ( i have an electric stove). Timed it for 17 mins before transferring to cold water. Peeling was effortless, no sticking and eggs were firm yet moist. Thank you Chef John :)

Best hard-boiled eggs method ever, and I've tried them all. Easy peel, creamy yolks. Make sure to hit a hard boil before turning the burner off.

I agree that eggs should be a little older as they peel better as whites are thicker.  My yolks however were perfect.  Very light and fluffy.  I followed the recipe pretty much as is but did a little more than a simmer before I turned off heat.  Again, slightly older eggs are much easier to peel if making deviled eggs.

So, I made this exactly how it said. I had some problems getting the shell off and the white part of the egg coming with it. 2 of my eggs were pretty messed up and the other 2 I made were pretty good. I saw someone say something about eggs being too fresh, but these were not fresh. I got them a week ago. When peeling the egg, I found I got the best results when I peeled parts directly under the water with the water hitting it to where it helped peel. I don't know a better way to describe it, but my eggs that were good, that's what I did. I hope people understand and this helps them.

I tried it exactly as you said with the exception of peeling under running water. I am in Thailand and my tap water is not potable. I use bottled water for cooking. it is true, I did not have green on my yolks, but a couple were slightly runny.  about 60% of my egg whites stuck to the shells. not happy.
I found it seems to work better when I add salt & vinegar to the water and let the water boil for a minute or so. I suspect that older eggs seem to peel easier.
An interesting note, In Thailand 90% of the eggs are brown, white eggs are a premium

11/29/2016  I tried it a couple more times, Yes, I discovered older eggs work better and immediately dousing the eggs in ice cold water helps. I also let the water come to a full boil for a minute or so, and my yolks did not green.

I did this method following the directions and advice of the added comments to a T. I am an accomplished cook and this recipe failed miserably. Perhaps it works with an electric stove top versus my gas powered one. I would not recommend this method as my eggs were barely cooked and runny. Waste of 6 eggs.

First time I tried this method and it worked beautifully.  However, it takes a very long time to finally eat, since you fist wait for siming, then wait 17 minutes, then wait 20 minutes. So much waiting, and not great for impatient people. On the positive side, it did really work and taste delicious; not plastic and the yolk was perfect. thanks.

I turned off the heat the moment the water started to bubble, just like the recipe said, unlike reviewers who said you need a full rolling boil.  I do have an electric stove, however, and I left the pot on the warm burner after I turned it off, which may have helped.  Perfect eggs!

Awful!!!  Even the 4 and 5 star reviews say this will not work. Should have read befor trying. Use the good old fashion way from the Betty Crocker cookbook. Waste of eggs and time. Please change the star rating of this recipe allrecipes.com. You have never failed me before!  ??

Fail. I followed the recipe exactly and the whites all peeled off with the shell. I bought my eggs a week ago. Just read that you should bring the water to a boil before adding the eggs and the eggs should be cold straight from the fridge to help with this problem. I guess I will try that next time but I'll have to buy more eggs since I just wasted all mine on this recipe...

We have laying hens and great supply of fresh eggs.   This method is OK for old grocery store eggs, but  not fresh. Good news - even with day-old FRESH eggs, I get amazing results by STEAMING the eggs - 13 or 14 minutes in steam and then immediately place in an ICE WATER bath for 15-20 minutes.  Once in awhile a shell will crack with the steam method, but the egg is still pretty and edible once peeled.

I make eggs this way all the time - total perfection! You must follow the recipe exactly! Using this recipe, you don't have to worry about using "old" eggs.  If you have trouble peeling them, try starting at one of the ends.

I follow this method to make hard boiled eggs, except I let the water get to a boil, and I don't let my eggs sit for 17 minutes--just 10 minutes. I wait until the eggs are good and cool (probably 20 minutes) and sometimes I don't even need to peel under the running water. I have noticed that if my eggs are too fresh, they are a bit harder to peel.

I make sure the water comes to a boil then turn off the heat and cover for 12 minutes. I also take out the eggs and turn them over in the box the opposite way they are standing for about 15 minutes. This gives the yoke a chance to float to the middle and makes a nicer looking egg. After running cold water over the cooked eggs put a shot of warm water in a glass with one egg and shake to crack the shell. Under warm water this shell should peel right off attached to the thin membrane between the egg and the shell. Not only are the eggs going to look nice but there will be no green ring around the outside of the yoke.

Oh, Chef John, these eggs turn out perfect every time! My mom taught me to make hard-boiled eggs as a kid, but her yolks (and mine) were always slightly greenish-grey. Enthusiasm for my egg-salad sandwiches and deviled eggs has increased tenfold since I started using this recipe! My husband has started eating two of these hardboiled eggs each morning for breakfast now. He loves them, I've never gone through eggs so fast! The yolks turn out a perfect, delicious gold every time.

Perfect every time, absolutely! Saw a great tip recently to peel these protein gems: place a hardboiled egg in a pint sized Ball jar with about a half inch of cold water. Seal the top and shake 4-5 times. The shell slips off with minimal effort!

I followed this method to the letter to boil my Easter eggs (I had watched the video too.)  I should have checked before coloring the eggs, because I discovered too late that all of our Easter eggs are very much soft-boiled -- runny, with a liquid yolk.  Thank goodness none dropped on the carpet.  The few that had somewhat solid whites were impossible to peel cleanly.  No egg salad from this batch.

Follow the directions exactly and you cannot miss. Used this 10 or so times and has been perfect every time. Thanks Chef John!

The eggs were a nice texture and yolk color, but even after having the cooked eggs cool in water for 20 minutes, the shells disappointingly still stuck to the egg white, resulting in a bumpy shelled egg!

I'v e tried this twice following the directions exactly as stated and each time resulted in failure..medium soft boiled eggs - aargh. Maybe it's the type of pot - I don't know. Back to my old system.

Followed recipe exactly and yolks firm but orange and tasted fine but shells stuck like normal, tearing up so I was lucky I was making egg salad not trying for devilled eggs. Will try again with chilling in fridge an hour like other commenter suggested

I've done these this way for years--I just let the water come to a full boil before the lid/remove from heat trick, and set the timer for 14 minutes. I also put the eggs into an ice bath. I think the shock helps the shells come off easier.

My mother had the same technique, however yours differs slightly. Wait to boil then let set and for shorter time. Equal results!

Tried this process and it works wonderfully.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I passed this on to my daughter who was also having issues with getting the shells off.

Maybe it was beginner's luck, but this recipe worked great! I know how to cook LOTS of things, but I had never made boiled eggs!! I had a craving for them and came here so I wouldn't screw them up! My eggs came out perfect!! Very delicious!!

My eggs came out very undercooked and in a poached consistency. Will try again, but will leave simmer a few minutes longer, and maybe let set for 20 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly to make Easter eggs.  The eggs couldn't be peeled.  A layer of white stuck to the shell of every egg.  I had to use a knife to remove the eggs and still lost a lot of white.

I'm a big fan of Chef John, but these instructions did not work for me.  Followed the directions and the yokes were done perfectly, but the egg shell would not separate from the shell.  Tried cold water and then warm water to no avail.  So a large part of the egg white went down the disposal.
