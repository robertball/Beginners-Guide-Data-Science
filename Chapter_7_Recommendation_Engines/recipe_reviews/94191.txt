Very good and quick.The only thing I changed was using fresh boneless chicken instead of canned.  There is just something wrong with canned chicken - yuk.  Will make this recipe again.

This recipe is so quick, so easy!  I couldn't find tomato sauce with peppers and onions, so I used diced tomatoes w/ peppers and onions and zesty tomato sauce.  I also doubled the recipe.  It was awesome.  My whole family raved about it, and my husband got up to eat some in the middle of the night!
