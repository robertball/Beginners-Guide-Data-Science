This is a good trail mix. It was hard to find the Goji berries in the store. Kroger's had them in their healthy food section. They are expensive, so this recipe was really great at dividing the berries up. I tripled the amounts and put a quarter cup each of the mix in snack bags. Now whenever I go to the gym or am rushing out the door without my lunch, I can grab a snack bag of this mix and I'm good to go.
