I used mini pans- the middle ones that I have- it made 3 perfect loaves--- nice easy recipe-- we enjoyed with dinner for valentines- with 2 for the freezer-- thanks for a fun recipe!!- I did not top with melted butter-- we used as a base for mushroom/onion gravy that we had with snitzel and scalloped potatoes and green beans.
