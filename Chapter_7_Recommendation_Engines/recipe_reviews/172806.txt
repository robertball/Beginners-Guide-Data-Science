I scaled the recipe down, and unfortunately managed to forget the cilantro, but did add bacon - which is a great counterpoint to the smoky spiciness of chipotles, IMO. I also used roasted garlic instead of fresh, and will definitely make this dish again. *Update* - and again, and again - this is a go-to in my house now, I just love it.  But I have to give a warning about chipotles in adobo - they seem to have been getting hotter and hotter with each can, it seems. So make sure to start slowly, adding more as necessary to bring the potatoes up to your preferred heat level.  And while I don't seed my chipotles, you might if you are more spice-sensitive.

I used 2 large potatoes and halved everything else in the recipe. I took out the seeds in the chipotle but might leave half the seeds next time. I was afraid it would be too spicy if I left the seeds but they weren't. Maybe using all the chipotle seeds would have been too much though. Used all white cheddar cheese but I think any cheese would have been good in these potatoes. Excellent potatoes!

Mmm! I don't eat potatoes often (perhaps because growing up it was always "meat n potatoes", and still today Sunday dinners with the family include them) but decided to buy some cute baby reds from the farmers market. I like the skins, so I didn't peel them, or cube, just boiled. I skipped the garlic since I didn't think I'd like it in this raw and didn't feel like cooking it. Added a shredded cheese blend and milk...skipped the mayo and cilantro. Loved the flavor and textural components: smoky and just spicy enough, creamy with the right amount of chunky texture, cheesy and flavorful. Bacon would certainly be a great addition, maybe with some sliced scallion and it would be reminscent of a loaded baked potato. Yum!

We all loved these potatoes. I made them exactly as stated. We have also used this recipe for double stuffed potatoes, even better. They have a nice bite without being too much, great for a bbq.

This is a great twist on regular mashed potatoes.  I recommend mixing everything and then adding the Chipotle peppers.  It could be very spicy, just add some and taste until it's spicy enough for youl

This is a super spicy smashed potato recipie.  So if you like spicy you will probably like this.  I made it for a work function and everyone raved!  I did mark it spicy.  I made it just the way it reads and it was fantastic.

I've made these many times throughout the years and I love them. I recommend using only one chipotle pepper though unless you like things super spicy. I went ahead and used two this go around and I will be going back to one. Also if you only use one, you can replace pepperjack cheese for the white cheddar which is nice variety too.

We tried as written & can only give 2 stars. We'll try again w/some changes - more butter, milk, less chipotle pepper, maybe more cheese & cilantro.  If this works it'll probably be a 3 or 4 star rating. My hubby thought these were very dry & the chipotle flavor overpowered everything else.

I am a very traditional mashed tater person: butter, sr.cream, milk, salt, pepper, maybe a touch of garlic, so, I really went out of my comfort zone to try this recipe. It was great without the cheese! I tried it again with the cheese and didn't care too much for it but I don't like cheese in or on my potatoes. Thanks for sharing a great variation of an old traditional recipe!

These were a really nice change from traditional potatoes. As other reviewers suggested add the chipotle SLOWLY. The heat can sneak up on you quickly.

I love this recipe.  All I do different is use half the cilantro, otherwise it kind of takes over the dish.

Absolutely loved this, even after deciding to leave out the mayo and cut the amount of cheese and cream in half (to make it a bit healthier, even though I did end up adding another tablespoon of butter). I would definitely make the "full fat" version as stated for a party, the flavors are just wonderful and you can adjust the amount of chipotle pepper you want in there if you don't like spicy food. Thanks for sharing, I will be making these often!

Got to add thinly sliced green onions before mashing.  A few mashed capers adds another layer of flavor.  This is a great recipe to begin with but every great recipe can be improved upon!

This was a great recipe! The only changes we made are that we substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the heavy cream and added chopped bacon. We served it with grilled BBQ chicken and was a great side.  It was so good we repurposed it the next morning into potato pancakes!
