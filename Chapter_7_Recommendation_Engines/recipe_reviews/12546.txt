We made it just like the recipe says, and it was delicious, even though my little brother complained saying the butterscotch pudding tasted coffee-like.
MAKE SURE YOU LET THE PUDDING SIT. I have made pudding before, and in a hurry I had not let it sit at all, I kept mixing continuously. Letting my pudding sit for two minutes while my mom lectured me on how to layer the pie right was the best food technique I've ever learned! It will actually thicken into pudding, instead of how liquidy it looks when you add the two cups of milk. I was also surprised when the crust tasted like brown sugar, though it didn't stick well to the cream-cheese mixture.

Excellent!  Everyone loved it.  I noticed that a few reviews stated that it wouldn't fit in a pie pan, but the recipe states that it should go into a 9x13 pan.  I put it in my cake pan and it turned out just right.  I will probably add some nuts next time though.

This recipe was a hit at a family gathering I took it to.  It makes two 8" pies.  I made one with an Oreo cookie crust and one with  a Nilla wafer crust.  I folded the Cool Whip into the pudding mixture for the top layer.

Easy to make and delicious. Makes enough for two 6 inch ready-made pies crusts. Looks pretty with fudge syrup drizzed over the top.

This recipe is truly the "original" Mississippi mud recipe. My friends from the South always made an extra for our family. We love it and it's easy to make.

I've made this for two occasions now and it was always the first empty dish.  Wonderful, sweet, delicious!!!  Didn't have butterscotch pudding so vanilla was the substitute.  Definitely a keeper!!

I am a retired dessert taster for a baking company and this is one of the best mud pie recipes I've tried. It turned out excellent.

I cut this recipe in half so I could prepare in a pre-made graham pie crust.  However, I kept the cream cheese as 8 oz to double that ingredient.  I mixed the entire 8 oz of cream cheese with the whipped topping and reserved about 1/3 of the mixture for the top layer instead of just having the whipped topping as the top layer.  My family LOVED this and I didn't even have a chance to take a leftover piece home to my boyfriend as my Grandma claimed the last piece for herself to keep!  Since I have 2 half used instant pudding packets (since I halved recipe), I guess I'll have to make this again!

I tried this recipe after my husband had told me to look up a recipe for it, we absolutely loved it and everyone else that has tried it also. You can alter the nuts to go with what you have on hand, and I also bake the crust for about 5 minutes at 350 degrees. It just makes for a somewhat toasted taste. Whether the original recipe or with a few alterations, this is still great!!

Quantities listed do not fit in a 9 inch pan. 12 is too many for the number of containers of whipped topping.2 is probably enough.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I made it for a work lunch and everyone loved it. Before I knew it, all of it was gone. I made some slight changes just to reduce the calories. I used neufchatel 1/3 less fat cream cheese and no sugar pudding.

Very easy and my family's new favorite dessert! I used vanilla instead of butterscotch and a chocolate graham cracker crust. I've found my heaven on earth :)

Super easy and I love that it makes a 9x13 size. I was told by one that it reminded them of a fine pie they had on a cruise ship once- how great is that!!The cream cheese layer is pretty thin and I think that next time I may double that  as its my favorite part.

I received this recipe as a part of a recipe book from my Bridal Shower a few years back.  This pie is to die for!!!  Every time I make it I get rave reviews and people always ask for the recipe.  Make it, you'll love it.  Its nice and sweet, but not heavy or rich..its just enough sweet and creaminess!! I'll make this over and over.  I'm actually thinking of using Jello's Pumpkin Spice jello to make it for Thanksgiving.

Rather than white sugar, use powdered  sugar and you get a much smoother, granule free mixture.  Also a touch of vanilla contributes to the flavor.  Other flavorings with the cream cheese portion may be good as well.

I have been making this for years now and have never written a review.   My Family starts begging for this dessert as soon as they see the first Halloween decoration up.  The only thing we do differently is i keep it frozen and serve it frozen they seem to like it that way

This was SO good!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except I put chocolate sprinkles on top.  A note: even though it is a "pie" it goes in a 9x13 pan NOT a 9" pie plate- it specifically says that in the directions though I noticed a couple reviewers didn't catch it.  VERY good and we will definitely make again. Thanks!

I added to the recipe by adding about 1/4 cup walnuts chopped very fine to the graham cracker crust mixture and once the crust was formed I stuck it in the oven for 5 minutes.  After everything was done I sprinkled just a few chopped walnuts on the top and it turned out really good.

so delicious...I used heavy whipping cream and whipped it into the topping instead of Cool Whip. It was so light and airy. Yum!  I also used Oreos, & used vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch, since I don't like butterscotch.

I have made this several times for my boyfriend and his family... They always love it and ask me to make more. For me personally I think it is good but I would probably modify I few things, make it a bit more artisanal.  Pros are super cheap to make and even though it says a prep time of 30 minutes... It usually takes me 12 - 15.

This dessert was part of my Mother's Day menu.  Made the day before and it was perfect the day of.  I'm not the biggest fan of butterscotch, so I used vanilla instead.  But it will be on my Father's Day menu for my dad.  And I think he will love the butterscotch.  Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written and it was so good! I only have a couple of 9x13 pans and they were in use.  I grabbed a couple of the flimsy throw away foil pans at the store.  They will work, but b/c of the crust, I won't do that again.  This deserves a glass or metal sturdy pan.

My stepson (a very picky eater) LOVED this!  He preferred it without the whipped topping on top.  I made two pies out of it - one with a graham cracker crust and one with an oreo crust (as suggested by another member).  Both were big hits!

Good recipe! Super easy! I changed a few things, I made my own Oreo crust (crushed up a whole thing of Oreos, minus the middle, and mixed with 12 tbs of melted butter and baked for about 10 mins at 350) and instead of using butterscotch I used vanilla. I used 2 9in pie tins to make it in and was a perfect amount. I will make this again the same way I made it the first time, but instead of using the frozen whipped topping, I will use canned whipped cream because the frozen stuff melts and just doesn't look pretty even though it tastes good.

I made this for thanksgiving dinner, and it was incredible! I left out the butterscotch, though. I also added Cadbury chocolate curls on top. Delicious!

MMMM! This recipe was very delicious! We made it the exact way the recipe said except we halfed it, and instead of using a 9x13 pan we used and 8x8. My daughter loved helping me make this and she loved how it was a no bake pie. However, it was very hard getting the cool whip-cream cheese mixture to stick to the graham cracker crust. I also recommend putting the pie in your freezer right after, if you don't plan to eat it right away.  Tastes delicious, and I hope you enjoy it as much as my family and I did!

Loved it! I made it in two 8 inch graham cracker pie crusts and instead of chocolate shavings on top I used chopped pecans and it was delicious! Big hit!

Scrumptious!
I made a few changes that made it more yummy:  Multiplied the cream cheese layer by 1.5.  Did the same with the pudding layer.   Sprinkled peanut dust and 2 crushed SKOR candy bars on top of the cool whip layer.  This thing disappeared fast!  My husband insisted that I sneak a piece to save for him for the next day before everyone devoured it.

When I was little, my aunt Jen would come to visit around thanksgiving and Christmas time, and would always bring a Mississippi mud pie. Fast forward and I’m now a 27 y/o bachelor living on my own and for years have never been able to replicate her recipe. Well after a few alterations, this is it, just as I remember it. I stuck true to the recipe, except for the butterscotch pudding which I ended up omitting, and I also added in crushed pecans on the cool whip and cream cheese layer, and on the top layer. I used a Pyrex dish to make this in, and after pouring in the graham cracker crumb mixture and pressing it in (I used a spoon to do so), I stuck it in the oven @ 350 for 20 or so minutes. This helped the crust solidify into a solid piece and added an extra crispness to the overall recipe.

Tastes great but super sweet!! Gave me tummy aches every time  I ate it. I made the puddings and let them firm in the fridge and crust in the freezer before assembling the pie. I added crushed Butterfinger Crisps on top.

Flavor is good but this is not how my mom made Mississippi Mud Pie back in the 1970's. Am looking for that original tasting recipe.

Ok, the flavors was great BUT my pudding layer wanted to slide off the bottom cream cheese/sugar/whipped cream layer. Did not present well. Any ideas what I can do, other than chilling overnight. I tried that with 2nd pie already.

I made this for a family dinner. It was so easy and everyone loved it. Following some of the other reveiwers, I used 2 chocolate puddings and left off the butterscotch. It was also very good the next day when we finished it off.

This was super easy and turned out wonderfully.  I didn't use my hand mixer to blend the cool whip and cream cheese, so it was a little lumpy, but I'll make sure to do that next time.  I baked the crust for about 5 minutes at 350, and had no issues with the layers not staying together.  I did use powdered sugar instead of regular sugar to avoid graininess as someone else stated, but everything else was the same.  I'll try variations with different puddings or an Oreo crust, but the recipe is great as is!

Outstanding recipe!  Super easy, yet elegant.  My husband's new 2nd favorite dessert.  Great for dinner parties when you don't have much time to prepare the dessert.  I added a bag of melted chocolate chips to the cream cheese mix for a little more chocolate-y flavor.
