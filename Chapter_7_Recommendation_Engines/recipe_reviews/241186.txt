I followed the recipe to the letter except I didn't add the glaze. Snickerdoodles are best with only cinnamon sugar. This recipe was no exception. Of the entire pan, only two small corner pieces were left after I had friends over. I'm sure if I didn't have other food to eat, this would have been devoured! I couldn't wait to cut into this because the house was completely enveloped with the smell of brownies with cinnamon sugar. The taste did not disappoint at all. I'll be making this easy dessert again! 

Thank you for the great recipe!

Holy Cow!!! These are delicious! The ones I made came out chewy, soft, and moist! Tastes just like a snickerdoodle cookie! Only changes I made, (and I made them only because I didn't have the exact ingredients) I subbed light brown sugar for dark brown and I didn't do the glaze (which in my opinion doesn't need) because I didn't have heavy cream on me. I left it in the oven for 40 minutes but my oven is wonky. I love, love, love it! Definitely doing this again!!!! Great recipe!

I thought these were fantastic!  They're chewy and sweet and the topping got crunchy.   We will definitely make these again!  I didn't make the glaze but it was awesome.

My husband loves snickerdoodle cookies! I promised him a batch, but was squeezed for time. . . So I tried this recipe. It was easy to put together and delicious (I did not add the glaze). The taste is a combination of snickerdoodles and blondies (cinnamon, butter and brown sugar). Will make these again for sure!

I have never reviewed a recipe on this site, but I had to review these blondies. I am a pastry chef, but rarely eat desert, not my thing. However, I could not stay out of these!! With and without the glaze. If you love cinnamon, these super simple bars are for you! Super yummy. Make them, you won't regret it, well, unless you eat the whole pan at one sitting.

These are yummy! I left out the ginger in the topping, because I was all out. Can't wait to have one for breakfast with a cup of coffee.

I think there is a problem with this recipe. I don't think it should call for 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon in the topping that is sprinkled on with the sugar.  I knew it was too much looking at it and reread the recipe atleast a half dozen times.  Pretty sure it should only be teaspoons.  Came out tasting like the cinnamon challenge...pretty disappointing! :(

So delicious! I didn't alter the recipe at all. Baked it for my daughter's soccer holiday party and it was a hit! Look forward to making it again soon. Thanks for a delicious recipe :)

My boys love snickerdoodles, but I have never been a fan of making the dough balls and rolling them in cinnamon and sugar.   I needed a faster way to get that great cinnamon and butter combination. These bars are my answer!  They are rich and buttery, and the ginger in the topping adds a nice kick to the spice.  Everyone loves them!

These turned out delish! I did read other reviews so I was careful with the cinnamon. For the topping I used 2 tsp and for the glaze (which my husband said they needed-I don't think it was needed. ;) ) I did half a tbsp. I only used 1/3 of the glaze-it made a lot. I definitely think it would be too much to add more. The glaze was super cinnamon-ey. A little spicy just by itself. :P I would change it to 1 tsp next time and only make half of it. They were a hit at a party we threw last night.

So tasty. Soft with firm edges. just the way I like it.  Wasn't super sweet, but enough sweetness. Make sure to mix the batter well after adding the flour, baking powder & salt mixture. I baked it for 27 minutes & it came out perfect.

These are so goood and they definitely solved my craving for cinnamon too!   I did not use the glaze but I did use all the sugar/cinnamon topping that it called for.   Any excess I just shake off before biting into the piece.  Very yummy.  I will definitely make this again, and again!

Simply one of the best blondie recipes ever. Only one caveat: I have to agree with those who say that the glaze is too cinnamony. I'd reduce the cinnamon to teaspoons instead of tablespoons. In any case, simple to make and really delicious too eat!

My family loved these!  I didn't quite have enough brown sugar, so I just added regular sugar to balance what I was missing and it was still wonderful.  So much easier than making snickerdoodle cookies and tastes just like it.  Crunchy on the outsides and gooey goodness in the middle.

My batter was so dry and cookie like. I followed everything to the T but still had a dry brownie. Was the 2 2/3 cups of flour much?

My family LOVES this recipe. It's not only easy but delicious. The taste profile is similar to a large sugar cookie but it's a great alternative to regular chocolate brownies. 
I personally left off the ground ginger as my family are not big fans of the taste of ginger. So, that's entirely your call! But this will be in our  regular baking rotation!

I love how easy this recipe is and how easy it is to personalize. I have made it as is twice but without the icing. This time I added a little applesauce to the mix. WOW, so good.

The first time, made it without the glaze - the second, with it. The family loved both versions, since we're all cinnamon addicts. I preferred the first, with glaze it was a bit too sweet for my preference. But all in all, a lovely, quick and easy to make dessert.

I will agree, if you make the recipe as is without glaze, they are dry. However, I made the glaze and it makes such a huge difference. It adds some moisture. These are great!

Delicious! It has a very strong cinnamon flavor, even for a snickerdoodle. I love it, but it could be a bit strong for some.

Too sweet for us. Made as printed except with whole grain flour instead of white.
