Very good!! We love quinoa and I'm always looking for new recipes to try. This one was a hit even with my 8 and 10 yr. old daughters. I didn't cool it down overnight like the recipe instructs, I just stuck it the freezer for 15 minutes and then I proceeded with the recipe. My only changes were to add more veggies like some sliced zuchinni, mushrooms, celery. I stir fried the veggies for a few min. as we like them a little crunchy. We paired this with Asian Lettuce Wraps recipe found on this site also, super good and healthy dinner :)

Awesome as is!  I doubled the ginger (because I cut up too much) and the peas (I like them).  It is perfect.  I like it better than fried rice!  I served it with beef and broccoli from this site.  The next time I will just add meat and extra veggies and mushrooms right to this recipe. With the extra veggies I plan to double the sauce.  Great recipe!

it was ok-  we eat a lot of quinoa, but this recipe just didn't seem to win us over.  I think maybe we just prefer it with brown rice.

This was awesome. We absolutely loved it. I didn't have teriyaki so I whipped up a little version myself. I had a quinoa blend from Costco that I used. I goofed up here and there. Too much onion. The pan got too hot when I added the egg but this allows lots of flexibility and room for error. My husband said it tasted like it has meat which is a good thing for him. I'm afraid I found something that he wants me to make again. Also, we served it with some bok coy and cabbage. That's it! I would be eating more now  but I promised I'd let him take some to work tomorrow. :)

This was good. I made it with rice because I wanted rice but will make it with quinoa next time. We felt it has the best flavor for fried rice. I doubled the sauce amount and it turned out to be a little too much. I will probably add half the amount of sauce next time as I like having extra sauce.

I did use L.S.chicken both to cook  the quinoa. I also added some chopped cooked b&s chicken (thighs) to heat up near the end. I used Snow Peas instead of frozen peas too!  (Added with the onion and carrots) Very pretty and yummy.

This was a tasty, easy dish.  The only change I made this time was to double the fresh ginger.  Next time I will also 1.5X the sauce and go with 3 eggs.  All just personal preference.

Cooked the quinoa right before and then put it in the freezer for 15 mins, while preparing the other ingredients. Didn't have teriyaki sauce so just added more soy sauce, with a little sugar and some salt. Added some leftover chicken and made it a main dish.

I have not seen my husband this obsessed with any food in quite some time. He insisted that the neighbor try it lol. I made this in a slightly larger portion to use up all my (red) quinoa. He has eaten it every single day for almost a week and tells me every day how good it is lol. I added some chicken breast to make it a little more filling. This is absolutely a keeper. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!!!!

I'm fairly new to quienwa. I just used my rice cooker about an hour before cooking this dish. Then I cooked chicken in the pan. And set it aside to add later.  I didn't use shallots or ginger. I used frozen peas and carrots witch I added after onion was cooked along with some fresh chopped broccoli. ALSO I added some red pepper flakes to my bowl. 5 Star. Will make again. Happy I have leftovers.

I thought that there was a little too much soy sauce. I will either use less soy sauce or add more quinoa next time.

I made this exactly as written (except that I did add mushrooms), and I thought it was kind of bland.  I think maybe more sauce will help.  It's a great dish to have ready for lunch at work.

This was pretty good.  The eggs just kind of disappear as in fried rice they usually stay more chunky.  Other than that it was good!

I halved this recipe and it made 2 "entree sized"  servings for myself. This was delicious. Usually, I don't care for the taste of quinoa, but the sauce in this masked it very nicely. Will be making this again and again!

Super easy and delicious. Perfectly quieted my craving for Asian food tonight!
The recipe definitely lends itself to easy modifications and I'll try it next time with shrimp or tofu additions. A keeper!
