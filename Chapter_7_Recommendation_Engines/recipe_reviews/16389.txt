Perhaps more precise measurements would help? (example - four tomatoes...big ones? small ones?)Ours turned out mushy, bland and overwhelmingly tomoto-ey - and the appearance was NOT appetizing, to say the least. 

Flavor improved somewhat with the addition of sriracha chile sauce, but this is NOT a recipe we'll be using again.

This was a good way to use up left-over pork roast.

For this recipe, I served it as a side dish and left out the pork. I also cooked up instant rice (as I've never had luck with long grain rice). Instead of 4 tomatoes, I used a can of petite diced tomatoes. I had company over and served this rice up with chicken thai meatballs. Everyone raved over the flavor of the rice. The fish sauce added a wonderful flavor.

Everyone in the house loved this recipe, especially me. I never tasted anything like it before and I would make this again, very good.

I liked this after adding cayenne pepper.  Rest of the family tried a bite then turned to PB sandwiches.

Mine turned out very slushy, bland, and tomatoey.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I couldn't even eat it this time, so I can't risk trying it again.

I added 2tbsp of fish sauce, 2 eggs, salt and pepper to taste. My husband preferred the dish with some Vietnamese hot sauce. Great quick one wok dinner.

Fish sauce seems to be beyond the repertoire of my local gorcery stores, and I tried three places before giving up.  As a result, I tried the recipe with Hoisin sauce.  I ended up with a so-so taste and a gummy texture, though whether that was the fault of my alteration or the recipe I couldn't tell.  We ate it, but I won't be making it again.
