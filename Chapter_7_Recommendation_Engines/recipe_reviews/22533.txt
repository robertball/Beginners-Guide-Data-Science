Thank you for posting this recipe! I couldn't locate my copy from last year. This dish is a treat! Sweet potatoes and pears make a wonderful combo and it's a nice change from the standard marshmallow topped casserole. Try it!

Delicious!  This was a piece of cake to make.  I tossed the potatoes in my stand mixer to whip them, added the sauce, added the other ingredients and the cooked pears, turned on medium high and we were all set.  This was very easy to make, and very good to eat!  My two year old loved it, as did my in-laws.  We'll definitely have this one again.

This is a GREAT recipe. A little different from the standard "sweet potatoe casserole". Delicious! The pears really give this dish a wonderful flavor - I even used canned pears, and instead of OJ, I used some of the reserved liquid from the can of pears. So good! (If you must, you can even throw some marshmallows on top for those marshmallow loyalists!)

Very good!  Note to self: Omit the milk to make them a bit stiffer. When scaled down to 3 servings (which is more like 6 for a side dish on a holiday) use 3 small sweet potatoes, 1 1/2 pears simmered in a tablespoon of water and 3/4 tsp vanilla until tender, a tablespoon of butter and a little less than 1/4 tsp cinnamon.

Oh. My. God. I *just* finished making this and while I am the only person who has tasted it so far, (it's for T-giving tomorrow) I am absolutely floored by the wonderful mix of flavors... it filled my house with the most terrific smells and I cannot wait to bake it one more time and serve it! Yummmmmmmmmmm!

Yummy! I toasted the walnuts prior to adding them to the mashed potatoes to give an extra nutty taste: it was so good I didn't even add sugar! Next time, I might use one or two extra pears.

Wow, this one stole the show from the Turkey!! My dad went for three helpings and so this recipe will make it all the way to Switzerland since my parents just have to have it!! Due to time constraints I also used canned pears but it didn't seem to hurt the recipe at all. I will make this one over and over again. Thank you for sharing!

A new twist on an old favorite.  I loved adding the pears.....I even used an extra one.  I didn't have enough sweet potatoes on hand (I used canned), so I added canned sliced carrots to the mix and it turned out great.  I'm taking it to work tomorrow for Christmas dinner.

This recipe got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. It's a nice twist on mashed sweet pototoes. I used 1/2 canned pears and 1/2 Anjou pears. Instead of OJ I used the pear juice leftover in the can. Easy and yummy!!

Hrm...just didn't like the flavor all that much.  I didn't puree the pears, just cooked them until quite soft.  Kind of disappointed...all that work and I would have rather just eaten a sweet potato with butter and brown sugar.

This dish had a nice combination of flavors and not overly sweet like most sweet potato casseroles.  I made it last year for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it and requested it for this year also.

This is Divine!  Instead of evaporated milk I used just a splash or two of half and half when cooking the pears and did not use ANY sugar-the pears are sweet enough.  I will be making this again and again!

I usually don't bother making sweet potatoes because my family doesn't care for the traditional overly sweet versions topped with marshmallows.  Everyone really liked this recipe.  It can be made ahead of time and I think it tastes even better reheated a couple of days later.

I cut this in half and still had plenty for four, now have 3 servings frozen.  It was very tasty, I made it as a dry run for turkey day.  Will definately make again, but may use less sugar since it seemed plenty sweet when I had just added the pear.  Kids loved it.  I left the potatoes slightly lumpy and just mashed the pear.

I was going to give this 3 stars but my guy liked it more than I did.  I didn't like it at all until I decided to add a lot more brown sugar.  You do taste the pears and it has an interesting taste.

This is very good!  I'll probably throw in just a little more cinnamon and nutmeg next time.  Also works with marshmallows baked on top.

This is amazing, I added 1/2 of the B sugar and no butter! And it still turned out amazing! I did add a few little marshmallows on top because I love them. The way I prepared them I figured about 125 calories for 1/2 cup. Worth the calories to me!

I was so excited about this recipe! I cut the oranges in haIf and juiced the orange by hand and spooned out the meat- not too bad once u get your rythm. I followed the recipe using baked sweet/yam potaotes  cooked in foil  w/ a dab of butter; 1/2 c white sugar 1/2 c brown and i used the juice from the orange.  The mixture was very good; but after baking in the orange cups, their was a bitter taste!  I will use the recipe( minus the orange cups) for a pie or just a casserol; but they are pretty!

Used white sweet potatoes and backed off on the brown sugar a bit, and it turned out well.  FYI, this is not a 20-minute prep time!  Plan for at least an hour, with the peeling and slicing time on top of everything else!  Enjoy...

Great recipe. Although, we are trying to watch our sugar intake. I left out the brown sugar, milk and orange juice (didn't have the OJ) . It was plenty sweet enough and was a great addition to our Sunday dinner. Next time I may add a couple eggs to make it stiffer and sprinkle the nuts on top. Yum!
