We actually skip the spices (except salt) and cook them with just the graham cracker crumbs.  Then we serve them with homemade applesauce. They are moist and yummy!

Quite tasty!  I liked the mix of spices.  My husband doesn't really like cinnamon with savory foods but he said I could make this again.

I grew up eating a simplified version of this. Like Baxter5, we didn't use any spices on them other than salt and a little pepper.

You also don't need the egg, just coat and pat the crumbs on well. I prefer the flavor of the graham cracker crumbs without the egg to mess it up.

Very, very yummy when prepared this way. My favorite pork chops.

This was unusually different. I'm not so sure that I like the addition of the rosemary. I think if I make this again I will use a combination of panko & graham cracker crumbs. Overall it was an adventure for my tastebuds

A quick recipe to throw together that was loved by the whole family, even our picky little ones.  You probably don't need 2 full cups of graham cracker crumbs... I used 1.5 cups and still had lots to spare.

I made some of my own modifications like making a balsamic glaze and Pan fried Apple. In general this recipe is perfect I just like to add the extra.

I only baked these for 30 minutes since I was using small boneless pork chops, and they were very tender. They tasted good, a little sweet and somewhat unique, though I didn't think they were phenomenal. However, my 4-year-old son who doesn't usually like meat kept saying, "Mmm!" and ate every bite. That's definitely deserving of 5 stars in my mind!

This was very tasty. I double coated the pork chips - first coat was no egg, just dipped in the crumbs. It was then dipped in the egg and in the crumbs again. Very moist chops. I will make this again.

I left out the rosemary as it is not my favorite. Didn't use the egg just coated in the graham wafer mixture. Smells delicious.  Served with roasted sweet potatoes.

This is a good recipe. I left out the rosemary and curry. I used graham crackers, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and egg. I think next time I will leave out the pepper. The graham cracker crumbs and cinnamon give it a sweet taste that is just perfect.

I omitted the rosemary and added ginger. Delicious flavor, but salty. Next time I will salt to taste afterward. Our 2 young kids (both under 6) loved this, as did my very picky husband. Will try apple chutney with it in the future.

I liked the topping, it was a nice change from the usual coatings for pork chops.  I did leave out the rosemary because I don't like it, but followed recipes otherwise.

Yum!  Tastes great, especially with a side of applesauce or cranberry sauce.

Really tasty. I live in England and we can't get Graham Crackers but digestive biscuits were a good substitute. Will definitely make this again!

Omitted the salt due to a low-sodium diet and the rosemary. Substituted shake-and-bake mix for the graham crackers. This was delicious with a nice kick. Chops turned out very tender baked in the oven.
