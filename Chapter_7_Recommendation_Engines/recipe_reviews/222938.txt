This chicken was phenomenal~ After adding salt! Instead of garlic powder, I used garlic salt.  I also used minced garlic under the skin since I didn't have any garlic cloves, and put some of the minced garlic in the can of beer.  We put our chicken on a foil lined cookie sheet and placed on indirect heat on the grill.  Our chicken was a 5 pounder, we did 1 1/2 hours at 300 degrees, then cranked it to 400 for about 45 min.   The chicken came out super moist with crispy golden skin!  We will definitely be making this again!!!

The best thing about any beer can chicken is how moist and tender the meat is - this is no exception.  The absence of salt was very noticeable - this really needed a nice sprinkling of kosher salt over the skin.  On the grill or in the oven I place the chicken is a heavy metal baking pan.  The drippings make a wonderful gravy and all the rendered chicken fat doesn't total the grill.

I have been searching for a low sodium beer can chix recipe.  Some ppl can't or shouldn't have the salt.  The others can put it on their plate.  Thank you Berube24. I also substituted butter for Canola Oil. Mighty Tasty!

This was sooo good. I knew it would need salt so I added seasoning salt. I can't believe someone would give this recipe one star without trying it!

Excellent! Fall off the bone delicious.  I followed Recipe exactly and it was great. Family loved will make again. One thing I did want to say is that I cooked with a 6lb chicken and it took alot longer to cook. At least double if not more.

Very disappointed. I made exactly as directed and this just wasn't tasty for us. The meat wasn't juicy and the paprika was over powering.
Maybe I had a sub par organic chicken? I may try this again without the paprika and with the addition of some kosher salt instead. I love garlic, and really wanted to like this recipe.

The chicken was absolutely terrific -- it was moist and flavorful.  I did make two changes to the recipe.  Instead of using 2/3 can of beer I mixed it evenly with apple juice.  I also used prepared garlic instead of fresh cloves.

Berube24, Simply Awesome.  Have been looking for the perfect Beer But Chicken recipe - AND THIS IS IT!!!!! Moist and full of flavor, the best I have ever had.  I even took it to a covered dish dinner at church!! Nobody but the preacher and I knew it was made with beer.
