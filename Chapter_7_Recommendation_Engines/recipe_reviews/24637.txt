The first time I made them, they were ok. The second time I used no milk and melted Hershey Kisses....that made them great.

You may want to heat the milk with the chocolate. 
Hot chocolate and cold milk do not mix well.

I prefer a more crunchier coating for cherries. This would be better on strawberries. If you haven't made something like this before I would choose a more detailed recipe.
It isn't specific on how much milk. Only says till smooth but chocolate melted is smooth before the milk? Definatley don't use the entire 8 oz of milk.

I was so happy to find a chocolate dipped fruit that didn't have huge amounts of shortening in it.  Thanks!

Worked great with strawberries, make sure to double due to the fact that 3 servings just are not enough.

After reading the reviews...I didnt add the milk. I just melted the chocolate and dipped... but I did cheat a little, I soaked the cherries in razzmatazz schnapps for a couple days, drained, and dipped. Perfect:)

Very bad, I added the milk like it said and it did not work right at all, it clumped very quickly. So I did another batch and this time put the milk in first and heated then added chocolate in and heated it with it, it still clumped very badly.

This was ok.  It worked well for a Valentine's Day treat. It was simple. I used it on strawberries though.  However it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. For me it worked better drizzled over the berries instead of dipped.  I will be trying this again though to see if I have better results!!!  For now, if I could give it 3.5 stars I would. Thanks for sharing it!!!
