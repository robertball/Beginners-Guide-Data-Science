I made this for my quinoa loving daughter and she was so pleasantly surprised when she tasted it.  I think she was expecting my usual quinoa salad…she had no idea she was in for a lovely dressing with what she described as an added sweetness…the asparagus and feta paired so nicely with the dressing…I wish we could have included the crunch from the toasted almonds but due to allergy had to omit.  This is a definite keeper for us… Thanks anninlondon.

I used gluten free quinoa and goat cheese( is find feta very salty) These are the only changes i made. I had this salad with a baked chicken breast and it was wonderful, it is a very tasty salad that i will make again. Thank you anninlondon for this truly lovely salad..

I really enjoyed this! Followed the recipe as written. Served with a balsamic grilled chicken and it was a good match. When I make this again (and I will) I will add a little garlic and decrease the lemon juice a bit - just personal preference. Might serve this over wilted spinach next time.
Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I really liked this as a basic recipe! I added red and yellow cherry tomatoes, used lime instead of lemon and didn't use the mustard or EVOO but it still turned out AMAZING! Light, healthy and a perfect side dish to our favorite grilled chicken recipe! Thanks!

So, so good. Versatile. Swap in pine nuts or Parmesan; add strawberries or peaches or seasonal cherry tomatoes. : D

I skipped the almonds and sautéed the asparagus with leeks, garlic and mushrooms and added fresh diced cucumbers, tomatoes and mint at the end. Served it with grilled salmon. This was the perfect, light springtime meal.

I doubled the recipe, used red quinoa, added only the feta cheese, asparagus, and dressing(which I changed up a bit).  The asparagus I roasted at 425 with olive oil, salt, and garlic rather than boiling it.  Other than that, I changed nothing and loved it!

It was lovely. All the flavors melded together. The only change I made was that I didn’t add all the dressing after all and it tasted great.

Used this as inspiration to make something kinda different.  I substituted a big cucumber instead of the asparagus and replaced the almonds with black olives.  I also just decided to rely on whatever light dressing I had on hand instead of making my own.  Simplified the recipe, but it really popped this way.  I see some other recipes that add avocado.  I might try that next.

Thought the receipe was okay. A bit blan with a strong lemon taste. Next time I would do 1/2 of the lemon zest. I did not have any fresh asparagus so, I added a avocado and diced tomatoes.

So easy and good on a hot summer day. Also so healthy and yet filling. Versatile as well. You can add other things to it. I had some cherry tomatoes and sugar snaps out of the garden. I added them. Color and crunch. Husband loved it.

Very good.  I used Chinese red rice in place of the quinoa, otherwise, everything else the same.
