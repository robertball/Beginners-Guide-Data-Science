I've never liked broccoli, but this recipe has come the closest - I might actually make it again! I can't honestly say I "liked" it, but I didn't dislike it, so 4 stars simply for the impressive fact that I was actually able to eat a whole serving without making faces (and also because it was super easy)

Really like this with more time for browner stalks. I added blanched almonds which browned nicely.
