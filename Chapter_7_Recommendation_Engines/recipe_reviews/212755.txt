I only made the tomato portion of this recipe and served it as a side dish.  It was very good.. but very strong.  It would be nice served as a garnish on meat.

Very nice!  However I found the chicken stock flavor was overpowering.  Make sure to use a low sodium version as to not make the taste to salty.  The tomato comfit was divine!  I will make again.

Loved the tomato comfit - I agree it can be used for many other dishes, even a steak.  I had a little trouble with the polenta mixture getting firm, I would cut down on the stock, or even easier there are a bunch of different polentas out there already to use with flavor, just fry that and add the tomato comfit with the arugula and cheese.
