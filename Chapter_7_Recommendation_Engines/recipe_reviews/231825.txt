Delicious! I did make a few minor changes...I only used 1/2 cup butter total. 1/4 cup for the chicken/veggies and 1/4 cup to make the alfredo sauce. I used a whole 8oz. pkg, of sliced mushrooms (I used baby bella), 4oz. cream cheese and only used part of the other cup of heavy cream (just enough to thin the sauce out a bit). I guess you could just say that I halved the sauce. The sauce was so good that I was afraid to ruin it by adding the egg, so I omitted it, lol. It was still plenty for 1# of pasta. This had a really great flavor, and I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So delicious! very easy to make, though it did take me a lot longer than I had originally planned; but that was probably my fault:/ very creamy and delicious my 12 year old sister said she's "going to fall asleep because its so dreamy" thank you for sharing!

Rich, creamy and very delicious!  However, next time I make it I will cut the cream cheese down to 5 or 6 oz, instead of 8.

I've made this twice now. It is so delicious! The first time, I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was still a 5 star recipe. Very rich and creamy. The second time I made it, I used about half of the cream cheese (roughly 4oz. instead of 8 oz.) and I liked it better this way because more of the parmesan cheese flavor came through. The sauce was still rich but not overly so. Definitely will continue to make this-so easy too!

I tried the recipe as written, however, I did add a few crushed red pepper flakes and some chopped onion with the mushrooms and peppers. I also used linguine, as this is what I had on hand. The only change I would make next time is to add 1 more breast half, as mine were a little small & my husband said it needed more chicken. Will definitely make this again!!

I cooked the chicken in olive oil with Italian seasoning and added the red pepper to it. The last few minutes of cooking the linguini I added broccoli to cook along with it. I also added spinach to it once mixing in the pasta with the chicken and sauce. To the sauce I added muenster , jack cheeses as well as queso fresco.

Good, will make again but omitting the cream cheese & adding more garlic to the sauce. I used Italian sausage instead of chicken.  My fiance said he would eat this every night if I let him.

This was rich and delicious. Tasted like a Cheesecake Factory pasta dish. I used broccoli and quartered mushrooms and only about half the cream cheese that it called for. Next time I will add some crispy bacon for a twist.

The flavor was good and I liked the mushrooms and bell peppers. I think it would have been better with a little more bell pepper and mushrooms, and possibly with a little less butter. The sauce mixture was easier to melt than when just using Parmesan cheese. Worth trying!!

Iwe prefer the sweeter red bell pepper, used one and half. Regarding butter, choose a lower calorie alternative, half & Half & half fat free will work, may need a thickener- flour. Overall a great dish. Cheese it up with your favorite.

I didn't make any substitutions other than adding onions because we love onions in our home. I definitely would make sure to use fresh vegetables and maybe add spices to the chicken so there is some seasoning in those bites of meat.

Very bland, way too much pasta and not enough sauce. It would be much better with about half the amount of pasta indicated in the recipe.

We loved it! 
For those that change the entire recipe then give it a low rating because it wasn't good, give your head a shake. 
I only substituted low fat cream cheese and used half and half instead of whipping cream. It was SO good. Definitely will make again. Thanks!

I absolutely loved this dish! I've made it several times over the past few years. It's a pretty dish since it's colorful and is a delicious comfort food. It's rich, but not overwhelmingly so. Everyone always loves the dish, and there's never any leftovers! I plan to make it again real soon!

Made it for my foreign film club, and it was a hit!  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I had to make some substitutions.  I didn't have any heavy whipped cream, so I used plain yogurt.   I added extra garlic - because I LOVE garlic, and doubled the peppers, because I had extra that I needed to use up before they went bad.  I put in some fresh Thai Basil from my garden.

Not a fan.. Too heavy, creamy and bland for me. I followed the recipe, did add  zucchini, broccoli and  topped with crispy bacon crumbles and quartered sweet grape tomatoes . Won't make it again, even though my husband loved it.

This has become my favorite pasta recipe! I absolutely love it, so yummy. I have made it a few times already and have never used any egg. Also I only used cream cheese the first time...it was just as good without it. As other users suggested, I used some pepper flakes too.

Great taste and quick to prepare! I cut the cream cheese amount in half, left out the egg at the end, and used Gluten free pasta too! Delicious !!
