This was really fun, and I am not even remotely good at crafty things.

I have made this... I am a fan of cheese balls and this was fun to make.. took a bit but fun..
As for flavor it was good not as good a a crab cheese ball.
My company very much enjoyed it..

Love the recipe but added dried cranberries and apricot with honey and did not use the ranch mix.
