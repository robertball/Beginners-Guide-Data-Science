It's a good soup but why would you put sugar in it?  Must sugar be added to everything?

I'm vegan and my family is not and we all loved it! It looks soupy when I opened the instant pot lid but it thickened up overnight which I like it a little thicker so it was perfect. If you prefer it soupy I would think you could warm it up on the stove and just add a little water. Either way, we liked it a lot and I'll definitely make it again. It was really easy to make.

Followed the recipe exactly and we used the Kitchen Basics unsalted vegetable stock. We used an Instant Pot, 6 qt and let it natural release for 30 minutes. Pretty perfect.

You need to  Make far too many  Substitutions and additions in order to make this dish edible.  And even after all of that,  It's just not that good.

Very Good. To give mine a little more zing, I added canned diced tomatoes with green chiles and a little less pepper. It was a hit.  Very good soup even with the chiles.

Very tasty.  The black pepper gives it quite a kick.  We used pearled barley and it comes out good, kind of like small pasta shells.

Easy to change the veggies in this dish and make it your own. Adding beans, spinach, or lentils would all be great. My girlfriend just told me to take it away from her or she'll eat it all.

I personally prefer it with half the amount of broth. Turns out less soupy and more of a hearty, filling, and satisfying meal.

Made this according to directions with the exception of the tomatoes-I used garden fresh rather than canned. I also didn't have bay leaves so added garden fresh basil. This soup turned out quite watery initially but thickened up after letting it sit for a while. It was very delicious!
