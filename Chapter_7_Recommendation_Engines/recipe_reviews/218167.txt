When I first started dating my husband, I was just learning how to REALLY cook. I found this recipe in a Quick Cooking magazine and made it to impress my in-laws. I did not use cook and serve pudding, I used instant vanilla pudding. I spread a thin layer of strawberry jam on the crust before I spread in the pudding/peanut butter layer. My mother in law never did get to try it--my father in law at the whole pie all by himself! I now make this for my kids while telling them the story about their Grampy who ate the pie until he was sick and they absolutely love it. This recipe will always be one of my favorites based on memory alone.

Wouldn't recommend it--unless it's for a child's birthday party (even they may not like it).
