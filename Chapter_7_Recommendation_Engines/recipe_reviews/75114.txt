This recipe had the basis of what I was yearning for in coleslaw.  I made one adjustment by adding 1T. of grapeseed oil to the dressing. Yummy as a side dish with grilled chicken.

I like the tartness that the lime juice brings to this coleslaw, found the cumin a little overwhelming, so I will cut that back a bit in the future.  That little kick from the  cayenne is just perfect for the dressing, and I love the way this breaks down nutritionally.

I wanted to make the asian coleslaw with ramen noodles, but after cutting up my cabbage and green onions, I realized I was out of ramen noodles! So I decided to make this recipe instead. I didn't have a sugar substitute, so I just used sugar!

extremely tangy, i guess this isn't the style i like. Coleslaw should be creamyâ€¦ this was way too limey.
