If someone's going to worry over the sugar, TRY THIS:  a touch of molasses for the brown sugar flavor, and then a touch of stevia.  Parsnips aren't easy to eat for a lot of people (though I absolutely love eating them mashed with carrots if there is a small touch of cream in them - again, a not so healthy addition, but some people give up on veggies if they can't use a touch of something to tame the strong flavors...., and, well, I guess I'm one of those who finds her family eats more veggies, and less sweets AFTER dinner, IF she adds just a touch of sugar to the veggies during dinner.......)

This has WAY too much sugar to be considered healthy. Tastes fantastic, but rots your teeth.
