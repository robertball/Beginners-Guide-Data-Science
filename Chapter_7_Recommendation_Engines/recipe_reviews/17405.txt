Scarlett, I'm sorry about your friend's lack of cake, but you can make a double boiler with a metal bowl set inside a saucepot with somme water in it. You don't need to go out and buy one. I would recommend using a tried and true recipe for a special occasion, rather than one you haven't made before.

The cake was great! I made it for my father's birthday(a day ahead of time) The icing a little thinner than I like, but I know cornstarch(a teaspoon at a time) will thicken any liquid. Also, I put the icing between the layers and on the top only. Used fudge icing for the sides and a border on the top, then filled in the top with this icing and used the fudge one to write on the cake with. As for the double broiler issue, as was suggested, a metal, or glass bowl in a pot. Also, due to modern convinece a micro wave works well to(30 seconds at a time and stirring between each time segmant. But the most important thing I think everyone should remember is this. Baking is an exact SCIENCE! If you do not follow the messurments precisley, the recipe is doomed before it every goes into the oven.

I had this recipe for quite sometimes and I made it this past weekend.  The cake was great!! It was moist and it barely lasted a day.  Now I know some of you had problem with the icing.  Well, I went to the orignal (4 egg yolks, 1/2 stick butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 can pet milk, 1 1/2 cup of sugar) cook for 12-20 min depends how thich you want it.

I made this cake for my best friend's birthday party (which I was hostessing).  The icing directions say "until the mixure thickens."  THICKENS TO WHAT CONSISTENCY??  DOES THAT MEAN I COOK IT 4 MINUTES OR 15 MINUTES?"  I'm sure that's why the other reviewer's icing didn't solidify.  Thickens like pudding?  Thickens like glue?  Who knows??  The author of this recipe might want to include the number of minutes neccessary to acheive this "Thick"ness.  Also, a double boiler??????????  I don't know anyone that even OWNS a double boiler, other than my grandmother.  Needless to say, my friend did not have a birthday cake for her birthday.  Thanks.

When I was making this, I was saying to myself--I'm not sure I will make this again-lots of steps, time, ingredients. But just one taste changed my mind. I took it to my daughter's school for the teachers and staff--they keep talking about it even now. I did add about 1 tsp. cornstarch and doulbed the icing and frosted the sides. I also used 4 oz. German choc. plus 1 oz semi-sweet for the cake. A definite winner!

To all of you who complain of the frosing not being thick enough! Have you looked at the picture?! The Frosting is dripping down the cake, which means its' not supposed to be thick also if you left yourselve enough time you would have had time enough to make a new cake!

I totally agree!  This is the best "German Chocolate Cake" recipe I have found.  It does take some extra time but it is WELL worth your effort.  It comes out light and fluffy and moist and the frosting is perfect.

The cake is time consuming to make.  I had the same problem with the icing not thickening.  I finally took it off the heat, added lots more coconut then called for and put it in the fridge for a while.  At that point though I still went out and bought some frosting because I didn't have enough to cover all the layers and the top and sides of the cake.  Next time I think I will do it Betty Crocker's way!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  Cake is wonderfully moist.  However, I too was unable to get the "frosting" to thicken up.  HOWEVER . . . one of the older reviews on this recipe stated that you're making icing, not frosting, so it isn't supposed to be thick.  I made a 3-layer cake instead of four.  I put a little bit of icing in between layers, poured enough over the top to where it ran down the sides (looked lovely) and put the remainder in a bowl next to the cake.  Icing lovers added additional.  I enjoyed my slice without extra icing.

The only modification I made was to use 4oz of chocolate rather than 4 cubes.   This may be the issue for those who think it isn't very chocolatey, as sometimes squares are different sizes.  That said, this is hands down the best German Chocolate Cake I have ever made.  Everyone at my company party raved about it.  The icing isn't supposed to be very thick.  It is icing, not frosting. It runs down the sides and is so darn good!  Next time, I will make a double batch of the icing as I had to skimp a bit between layers to have enough.

I also had problems with the frosting thickening. Someone mentioned that it is running off the sides of the cake in the picture. That is true, but th frosting was still way too runny even compared to the picture. After cooking it for 40 minutes and it not thickening much I thought maybe it would thicken once I added the other ingredients and let it cool. I checked it when it was near cool and it was not thickening so put it in a sauce pan directly on the burner at med-high heat and brought to a full rolling boil, stirring almost constantly, and brought it up to 250 degrees (using a candy thermometer, if you don't have one they are cheap, I bought mine at walmart for about $3). I kept it boiling at 250 for about 10 minutes, still stirring almost constantly, and then removed it from the heat and let it cool. It was just loose enough that you could spoon it on top of the cake and spread it around. Several people said the cake took alot of time. Other than trying to get the frosting right, which I know now how to do it next time so it goes quicker, I found the cake very easy to make and it went very quickly.

i have to agree with scarlett1 on this.  the frosting never thickened!  i cooked it for 30 minutes and then just figured it might thicken when cooled.  it didn't.  it was very disappointing.

I found this to be a very moist cake although I followed the recipe for the icing exactly but the icing never thickened up so the icing mostly ran off of the cake.

Delicious!! Moist! Made it for my Husband's 31st b-day and was a hit. I didn't use the frosting recipe, b/c I didn't have that much cream on hand. The texture was pudding-like, but not dense.

My mom used to make this cake before she had an electric mixer and used a rotary beater.  They were great.  Since she's not with us anymore I have taken on the task...with a electric mixer.  This is the trick I use for the frosting if you only want to ice the tops of the layers.  I add extra coconut and nuts, and make it the night before so it thickens (I just leave it on the stove/counter covered up).  It will be much richer, but there's no way getting around it...the cake is rich anyway.  Also the preparation is not so time consuming.  I used to make the cake then the frosting; then I'd have to wait for the hot frosting to cool, blah, blah, blah. I keep my cake in a covered cake carrier and it stays moist.

Terrific cake. Time-consuming, yes, but was a hit with my family. Used a more traditional frosting as other reviews suggested. Didn't know how to beat egg whites to stiff peaks so I googled it.  My brown organic eggs where difficult to separate yolks from whites. Would probably by liquid versions of eggs for next time. My first layer cake- tasted much better than it looked!

This recipe did not turn out the way I was expecting!  The frosting was a soup, not a frosting which was terrible!  The directions are not detailed enough.  And to top things off the cake stuck to my pans (even after following the greasing instructions).  I had to puzzle piece the cake back together using store bought frosting as paste!!!

i would give this a 5 star rating because it tasted so good but i cant because the frosting did not turn out at all. like another rater said "what thickness" when you are cooking in the double broiler. i swear i was cooking it for 20-30 min and i gave up. thought the fridge would help thicken it. it took so much time we didnt have time to let it thicken in the fridge. good thing i had left over german chocolate squares, i made frosting with those. i poured a lil of the coconut frosting on and put the chocolate frosting on the sides and some of the top. looked like a mess. but everbody loved it.

I have not made this recipe but it sounds delicious and that is why I gae it a 4.  I was thinking that if you omit the eggs when you make the icing, use heavy whipping cream, you will beat it til it does get thick, then add cocnut and nuts and beat till stiff, there would be no need to cook it!

AMAZING!! I suggest making the filling before making the cake... even a day earlier.  The filling needs plenty of time to thicken up.

Should have taken the other review advice. Bought frosting for this after the recipe flopped.  Cake was ok I guess, just know before hand that you will need to buy the frosting.

Use two egg yolks and frosting and allow at least 15 to 20 minutes to cook.  I do not have a double boiler so I use a stainless steel bowl over a pot.  Not a recipe for beginners or if you are in rush.

I don't get the gripes that others have for this recipe.  Maybe its the difference between people who know the terms and those who don't.  I'm a dude.  I followed the instructions to the Teeeeee.  German chocolate is my favorite.  I've tried many different recipes.  Aside from freezing the cake (because I didn't have to), this is the most moist, and tastiest recipe I've ever had.  I've had cakes with $60 dollars of ingredients and weighing over 10 pounds on the safe that didn't taste this good.  The icing was perfect, also.  If you want to really try this recipe I'd recommend putting the cell phone down.  Congratulations on this great recipe.

I tried making this cake for my husband's b-day and it was a disaster. This was hands down the most frustrating baking experience I've had. I bake, but only do cakes a couple times a year. I should have known NOT to follow the instruction to let the cakes cool in the pans. The cake stuck in the pans so badly. I completely lost one layer. Two other layers had to be pieced together. A trick that worked was to put the pans on the stove to heat the bottom a little until I could slide the cake around in the pan, then I was able to flip the cakes out mostly whole. So, DO NOT LET THESE COOL COMPLETELY IN THE PAN!! Let them cool 10 minutes or so, then run a knife around the edges and try flipping them out of the pans. The cake tasted fine. It's really light and fluffy. I used bittersweet instead of German's chocolate, so it was a little less sweet, but I thought it was great with the rich German Chocolate frosting. I didn't use this recipe (I thought the pics looked weird), I used the "German Chocolate Cake Frosting" recipe instead (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/german-chocolate-cake-frosting/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=german%20chocolate%20frosting&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe). I would recommend it for flavor, but the instructions aren't accurate and it takes forever to cook until it thickens. So, in the end I was able to save the cake, but I have never ever had so much trouble with a cake in my life. Geez!

This cake would be delicious and rich if everything went well. However, although I greased and floured the four 9" pans, the layers stuck to the bottom and came out in pieces! I was going to just glue the whole thing together with the frosting but the heavy whipping cream mixture for the frosting never did thicken. After an hour, I took it off the double boiler and added the nuts, coconut and butter. Even though it has cooled down, it is still like soup. Very disappointing and very costly. I wish the recipe had told how long it took to thicken the frosting mixture. I'm off to Safeway hoping they have a German chocolate cake to take to my son's family for Christmas eve!

My family loved this cake, which I made for Thanksgiving. In fact, my own comment was "this is a  fine cake!" (and I'm extremely picky about my own cooking). My only complaint is that the cake baked up to be very heavy (but still moist and yummy!).  I added extra coconut to the frosting to make it a bit thicker and topped the cake instead of adding it down the sides (where the liquid ran anyway).   We all agree, the cake is twice as good on the second day. In normal cases, I would have left the cake with my family. But it was so good...it traveled 200 miles back home with us, lol.   I doubt I'll have alot of events special enough for another cake of this caliber...but this one will certainly be on the list if/when there are!

The cake was labor intensive, but not difficult. The frosting didn't work at all. "cook the mixutre until it thickens". It only thinned! What a waste of ingredients. I recommend making the cake but finding another frosting recipe.

I tried this cake today but haven't eaten it yet. Although, the cake looks fluffy and yummy. The icing problem was same for me, didn't thicken, buuuuuuttt I found a solution I bet no one would ever think of. I used instant potato flakes and added them in until the icing got thick enough for me. Then upon adding the coconut and pecans it got a perfect consistancy. BTW the instant potatoe flakes tend to pick up the flavor they go into so they do not taste like potato. Try it with stews and things you want thickened, it'll do it better than cornstarch, after all cornstarch tends to give a different taste and sometimes don't do the trick, as it did not to this icing.

Made this for my son's party. I must admit I even went to the store and bought a back-up cake mix...but it was completely unecessary! This is a hit among children and adults who dont have to watch their weight!

I made this cake and everyone seemed to love it! In my opinion, the frosting made the cake absolutely terrific.   The only complaint I had was that the cake was very light and fluffy tasting. I’d prefer my German chocolate cake being more heavier, especially a homemade cake. I hope they didn’t think it was a box cake with homemade frosting.  I took pic.

I made this for the first time for my dad's birthday last week.  It turned out spectacular - thanks to the previous reviews.  I opted for the traditional frosting (Coconut Pecan Frosting 1) which I found on allrecipes.com as well.  I added an extra oz. of the german chocolate squares.  The only mishap was my fault - I did not grease and flour the pans well enough.  One layer stuck but I was still able to salvage.  Wow!  This cake is delicious!

I have no idea what anybody is talking about, with the icing not being thick enough? Our icing was the consistency of average icing, and may I add that it was one of the most tasty icings I've every out into my mouth? DE-licious! I have to say though, that this cake was not very chocolaty, so next time I will add an extra square of chocolate and some cocoa powder. We drizzled some caramel on top, so it made it look even prettier, and made it taste even better! Instead of German chocolate cake this was more like gooey caramel cake. But we didn't care, we all ate every last bite! A very moist and flavorful cake, I will definetly make this again. (Oh, and don't worry, the batter should be very puffy)Delicious, thank you for the recipe!

The best German Chocolate Cake ever! I used store bought icing, since I don't even know what a double boiler is, but the cake was phenomenal!!!
