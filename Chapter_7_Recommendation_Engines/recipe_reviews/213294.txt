The recipe is kind of bland unless you add a few more  things. I added garlic and some green onion and it turned out pretty good. I think next time I will also add a little salt and more pepper because it still could've had more flavor.

Per other reviews, I decided to add a few more ingredients.  I sprinkled seasoned salt on each layer and crumbled a couple of slices of swiss cheese between the layers.  It was a hit!

This was simple and very good!  I did add one chopped fresh serrano chili, which gave it a nice kick!

Delicious and easy!  This is what scalloped should be like.  If you change it then its something else.

I had a can of cheddar cheese soup, so i used that instead of cream of celery. i cooked the potatoes in the microwave half way so i only had to bake for about 45 minutes.

I added a sprinkling of salt and handful of cheddar cheese over both layers.  My stepson declared it was the best potato dish he had ever had.

Easy peasy! And, good too! Recipes with a few ingredients are what I'm looking for during the week. It's a great way to "jazz" up a potato dish. We liked and I'll make again.

This was not to my liking, I'm sorry to say.  I used some lovely little fresh-dug redskin potatoes and I am sorry I did - the taste of the cream of celery soup overwhelmed everything.  Yes, it's easy and fast.  But in this case the shortcut didn't do the dish any favors.

I gave this a try exactly according to directions and liked it well enough to double the recipe for a family gathering.  It went over very well. An easy and reliable comfort food.  Not quite as good as it would be with all fresh ingredients, but close.

I made this exactly as directed.  Taste was good, but the whole thing needed more liquid.  Next time, I'll use two cans condensed Cream of Celery Soup and 3/4 cup milk.  Hopefully, that will do it.  Or maybe, just the one can of soup with 3/4 cup milk.

This recipe was awsome! I seasoned each layer with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and diced ham. I forgot the paprika, but I don't think that really mattered. Don't know if the sauce was suppose to be thick or thin. Mine was watery, but it didn't matter. It was still very yummy.

I made this last night as a side dish to grilled lamb.  It was really good, and hit the spot.  A great comfort food dish!

Very tasty after additions: cheddar cheese, garlic powder, & dash of Worchester sauce to mushroom soup mixture (didn't have cream of celery). Doubled the soup mixture & didn't add salt since the soup is already salty enough & forgot the butter but it's not really necessary when adding the cheddar cheese. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was wonderful!  I used one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken, since I didn't have chicken gravy.  Added some thinly sliced onion, celery and red bell pepper and several dashes of hot sauce.  I had some whipping cream in the refrig so threw a cup of that in also.  I had a huge lasagna pan full (used twice the potatoes), figuring on freezing the leftovers.  What leftovers?  And there are only two of us in this household.  This will be my scalloped potato recipe from now on.

*edit  Forgot to add that I baked it at 325° for two hours.  You can't hurry scalloped potatoes.

I was a little nervous about making this recipe as it is different from the way I normally make scalloped potatoes, but it turned out absolutely fantastic! I will make this recipe from now on.  I used cream of chicken soup as I did not have cream of celery on hand and it tasted great.  Also added some diced ham.  Very delicious... the family all asked for seconds!

Good comfort potato.  I did add a couple things - a decent scoop of sour cream (b/c I used more potatoes and did not want to dry out), dash of rosemary and thyme; topped off with a little shredded cheddar cheese on top.  When I was eating them, I realized I forgot the onion :(  The family liked them alot.

Delicious!!  Added 4 slices of american cheese to the center layer.  It really made a difference in flavor.  Good addition and good recipe.
