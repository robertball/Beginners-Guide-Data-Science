This was almost verging on excellent.  I had never cooked a squah of any kind before and I found this to be very easy.  Neither of us had ever eaten spaghetti squash before tonite and it is now on my grocery list to buy again.  My husband absolutely loved this dish and has requested me to make it again as well as asking me to substitute spaghetti squash for pasta as he is trying to watch his waistline.  We both agreed as did other reviewers of this recipe that there is something missing.  I had added a little bit of garlic powder but next time I am going to add a minced fresh clove or two of garlic and a little extra pepper.  Maybe a sprinkle of chili peppers would be good too.  Thanks for a great recipe and a new food in our repertoire.  *** NOTE ***  I made this dish again and this time I used fresh Italian Roma tomatoes, 3 cloves of garlic put through a press, I squeezed in some fresh lemon juice while the tomatoes and onions were simmering and I added a good sized spoon of dried oregano.  This dish became superb with these changes.

This was terrific!  Such a wonderful, summery flavor.  I added a couple of cloves of chopped garlic in with the onions as well as some Italian seasoning.  I also used a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of chopping fresh.  So simple & yummy.

First off, the hardest thing about this dish is cutting the squash in half. Since I was having trouble, I just microwaved the whole squash in the water. After 5 minutes, it was easy to cut, then I did as the recipe said.  The only difference I did was add 2 cloves of garlic with the onions.  I've never made S.Squash, but I enjoyed this recipe soooooo much!!!! I'll definately make this again !!!!

I used 1/2 of a 3.5 pound spaghetti squash (the smallest I could find), and this recipe was perfect for 2 servings, but it wouldn't have fed four as a main dish. It was delicious, I just added a bit of Italian seasoning and garlic powder, pureed half the tomatoes, and used shredded mozzerella instead of parmesan.

This recipe was really good.  We've never had or made spaghetti squash before and my husband was really leary (due to a traumatic squash incident when he was young).  I combined this recipe with the Spicy Spaghetti Squash recipe from this site.  I cooked the squash in the microwave for about 16 minutes and halfway thru flipped over the halves and put a tbsp of butter into each half with some garlic power and some salt and pepper.  I ommitted the capers and made the sauce using 2 cans of diced tomatoes, red wine, onions, green peppers and zuchinni.  Next time I will drain one can of tomatoes before I add it-- the sauce was slightly watery.  The squash itself doesn't have much flavor-- it is slightly sweet so adding some red pepper to the sauce and salt and pepper was definitely a hit with my husband.  He really liked it and said I should make it when his parents come to visit!

I was so excited to find a recipe, replacing the pasta in some of my Italian dishes. However, the squash was a bit crunchy. Next time I will make sure to cook it longer.(I should've looked at the reviews before cooking :) I added sweet basil, oregano and garlic powder to the dish, and omitted the lemon. I will definitely give this recipe another shot!

Actually I didn't really follow this recipe except to cook the squash, I followed the directions for the squash and it turned out perfectly!  I just made regular spaghetti sauce (homemade) to put over it - a very good alternative to pasta :)

I really wanted to like this recipe because I absolutely LOVE spaghetti squash, however I do think it is missing something (NOT MEAT!) and after reading a few other reviews I realized it is missing GARLIC of course why didn't I think of that and I would also throw in some mushrooms next time. I will try it again because I'm sure I will find a way to tweak it to perfection for me. Thanks for the idea. Oh, and I just microwaved my squash whole for a little over twenty minutes turning it every 6-8 minutes.

It's actually not bad.  I'm trying a new diet for 10 days which includes fruits, vegetables, and tuna.  I did alter the recipe a little by adding garlic and mushrooms to the mix with the zuccini.  I didn't measure the cracked black pepper, but I'm guessing I probably added more to the vegetables than the recipe called for.  I thought the meal had good flavor, was light, and filling.  My boyfriend did enjoy it, however he decided that he doesn't like squash.  It reminds him too much of pumpkins.

WOW - this recipe shouldn't be limited to South Beach Diet! or any diet.  Has a delightful flavor & makes a great side dish .. if you make that about 8 servings for this recipe!  Something different! Low fat, low everything except veggies, easy to make, appealing presentation, and taste great!

Not bad - just needed some garlic and a lesser cooking time on the tomatoes.  You don't want to cook them to death!  Just basically heat them through, which preserves their color as well as their fresh flavor.

I was really surprised when halfway through dinner I realized I like this way better than real spaghetti. My husband and mother-in-law agreed. My husband needs meat, so I added the italian style turkey sausage (cooked and sliced) that's allowed on SB, and used extra onions and mushrooms in the sauce in place of the zucchini because hy husband's not a fan of squishy squash. It was so good, we'll be eating this regularly.

I really liked this a lot, I was looking for a different recipe for squash. Instead of usual tomato sauce,butter and grated cheese. I did not have zucchini, it was still so good.
I halved cherry tomatoes, added crushed garlic and put it all in the pan together to let the flavors blend. I like that it is Weight Watcher friendly.
Thanks so much.

This dish was fabulous.  I am on weight watchers and the whole dish only counts as 8 points.  That's 2 points per serving.  It had a wonderful taste and there was soooo much left over.  I am going to make it again tonight for the weekend.  Thanks soooo much for this wonderful recipe

I was skeptical of this recipe but after I tried it it was FABULOUS.  My microwave, which is the cheapest kind Wal~Mart has, cooked the squash perfectly at 10 minutes.  I had run out of tomato so I halved grape tomatoes which I think gave it a really fresh taste.  I also added about a tablespoon and a half of chopped fresh basil which really enhanced the flavor.

pretty good!  baked in the oven and scraped out the strands easily.  I'm not on the South Beach diet, but will make this when feeling like a sweetened version of spaghetti and tomato sauce.

No, I don' think it tastes like pasta, but it is absolutely delicious! Of course, I love squash! I have made this also by just preparing the spaghetti squash and serving with my favourite tomato sauce and LOADS of parmesan cheese. I LOVE this, and I don't miss my spaghetti dinners so much anymore.

I loved this.  It was amazing and reminded me a lot of lasagna.  I used 1 spaghetti squash, and altered the recipe a bit.  I didn't include zucchini or lemon.  I substituted 3/4 can of stewed tomatoes for the tomatoes and added 3 cloves of garlic.  My twin also thought it was delicious.  Definately more of a lasagna taste than a spaghetti taste though.

OMG, I am in LOVE!  This is the perfect solution to my pasta cravings when I am on my south beach diet!  The mixture of vegetables is enough to drive your taste buds crazy over this great dish!  Not a hit for the kids or my husband, but great for any health nut who is looking for the pasta carb craving solution.  It might have gone over better as a side dish with the family!

This is a great side-dish in place of pasta!  I've served it with Chicken parmesan, sausage & peppers and even beef stew!  So versatile and yummy!

Btw, when I cook spaghetti squash in the microwave, all I do is scoop out the seeds and throw it in (no pan, no water).  It takes about 10 minutes per half for a medium sized squash.

used this as a base to replace pasta in a thai shrimp dish- PERFECT! so easy- only recommendation i have is to give plenty of cooling time before scraping out the squash- hard to handle otherwise.

This recipe is so cool! I've never had spaghetti squash before and I didn't know what to expect. It looks like spaghetti! This doesn't taste like pasta, but it's just as much fun to eat. I felt a lot less guilty about going back for seconds. I added turkey sausage and left out the lemon. It was so good. I will be making this regularly from now on. Great recipe!

Was alright. Texture was strange and not at all like spagetti. I think I needed to cook the squash longer as it was really hard scoop out of the "shell".

This was fantastic.  I added garlic, mushrooms, basil, and 1/2 cup of I can't beleive its not butter spray to the sauce at the very end.  The butter gave it a pretty color and definitely added to the sauce.  I tasted it without it and liked it better with the butter.  This is a versatile dish as you can add whatever you like.

I decided to try this recipe because my husband and I are on the South Beach Diet and we wanted something new.  I've never had spaghetti squash before, and I'm so glad I gave it a shot because this is delicious!!  We were both pleasantly surprised and we will make it again.  I didn't use any lemon, and next time I'll try it wil some mushrooms.  You can vary this in so many ways.  Don't skip the cheese!

This was very good. Only problem was that it was a little to sweet for our tastes, due to the natural sweetness of the squash; Davin typically doesn't use salt, but said I should add more next time. I did add some dried garlic flakes and some oregano to the sauteed veggies.    I'll definately be using the veggie saute again (on regular pasta, as a side dish, etc.).

i enjoyed this recipe.  i made a few minor adjustments.  i added minced garlic with the onion, i added a few pinches of italian herbs, thyme, oregano, and basil when i added the zucchini.  i also just juiced half the lemon and added that with the tomatoes rather than slicing it.  i also added a splash of red wine when i added the tomatoes and lemon juice.  all in all a nice, pleasant, tasty recipe.  i forgot how much i love spaghetti squash!

Excellent Dish. As said it was a bit bland, but upon adding Oregano as another member suggested it significantly improved. Remember that the lemon is not merely a garnish, and all will be well; it adds a tangy flavor that makes the dish perfect for nights out on the porch.

This was the first time I ever cooked with OR ate squash of any kind.  It was cheap, so I figured I would give it a go.  I am glad I tried it - because I found it to be very appetizing!  Since I had no zucchini, I did use fresh mushrooms in its place, and also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh.  Additionally, after reading some reviews, I chose to add in minced garlic and a fair amount of Italian seasoning.  I will definitely make this one again - thanks much!

I thought this recipes was great! I used halved cherry tomatoes as I didn't have any normal ones, and added chopped garlic, some lemon juice and oregano as well as a bit of tobasco. I really liked the spaghetti squash, it had a good flavour and texture. I can't have parmesan because it's not vegetarian so I diced a cube of laughing cow extra light and added it. Definately making this again!

I added a few other vegetables and the results were delicious. The lemon was a great touch, too.

I doubled the zukes (what I am going to do with the other half of a medium zucchini?!?) and added a sliced bell pepper. I used a can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh. I also added 1 lb of bulk sausage (Jimmy Dean Light in the tube, in fact), because my husband is not happy unless there is meat in his dinner. Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes made the perfect final touches!

Not bad - not bad at all.  I used spaghetti sauce (easier) and omitted the zuchini.  I added It. Sausage for a protien source.  My only problem is that the strands were still a little crunchy.  Is that OK, or should I have cooked it longer?

I'm not a big squash eater, but I found this to be pretty good.  I added some Italian seasoning for extra flavor.  I will use this recipe again.

This was not bad, but I found that I had to take it in and out of the m/w and extend the cooking time before the squash became as tender as al dente pasta. Overall, the cooking time was about 22 minutes for each half of the squash, hi power.

This is so tasty and easy to make.  It's also easy to substitute yellow squash, green beans, or other vegetables, and to add cooked shrimp, chicken, or pork.

I recently turn vegetarian, and this is a wonderful main dish for those of us trying to avoid meat or increase our veggie intake.  I took to a potluck and everyone loved it!  I didn't even mention it was low in fat.  I had the leftovers the next day for dinner and it was great.  I added fresh basil to the zucchini and think it added some to the flavor.  GREAT RECIPE!

Super easy to make (minus cutting open the squash) and very light and flavorful. I took other reviewers' suggestions and added fresh basil, minced garlic, garlic powder, and oregano. Will definitely make again!

This was super good!  I forgot the lemon at the end, but it was still delish.  I used a non-stick pan and left off he oil for the saute and it was still really good.  The only reason this isn't a 5 is because its not quite "the best" - but it definitely ranks up there!

surprisingly good! i wouldnt say that it could replace spaghetti, but its a really good and healthy change up. i felt really healthy eating it, and its good for my husband, who's becoming a fatty mc fat fat :P y is it that when a woman is preggo, her husband gets fat too?!? anyhoos, i digress. i used the arribiata sauce on this site for the spaghetti squash, that sauce is just awesome and soooo tweakable. will use this recipe again to help husband lose his beer gut :)

I have never made spaghetti squash before.  It was so easy and tasted great!  Did not have tomatoes, so I added half a chopped red pepper and one third a cup of tomato juice.  Turn out great!

My family enjoyed this very pretty dish.  The only thing I would do differently next time is omit the lemon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic! I'm not on the south beach diet but made this because I had the ingredients for it. My infant daughter loved it too. So good. I will definately be making this in the future.

This is a great recipe.  The only problem I had with it was it became too sweet after about 5 bites.

I loved this recipe! I did add a few things however. Italian tomato paste and a can of water, some bell pepper and mushrooms. and of course garlic! I think that gave it a little more bulk then just going on the ingredients below. All in all I will make this again!
