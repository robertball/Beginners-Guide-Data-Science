Tastes really good, similar to hollandaise sauce. It tasted even better with the mashed potatoes. I think next time I will put some veggies in it and try it with noodles or rice. I also wonder how I can make it not separate, it was probably the margarine I was using but it sucks when it separates because it doesn't look as appetizing as it really is. Also the recipe makes a ton which is why next time I will half it. of course I didn't use 4 chicken breasts because we usually get full with 2 or 3 cut up in sauce no matter what it is. But I don't think 4 chicken breasts would suffice with the amount it makes. definitely worth trying and tweaking to your tastes although the original is still very good!

This is really tasty! You can use skim milk you'll just need to add a little more flour for your roux. Don't let this recipe intimidate you, its easy and great for leftover chicken!

The secret is, it has no taste.  Where's the onions, celery, garlic, salt, pepper...ANYTHING!  This is NOT Chicken Fricassee.  This is chicken in a yellow gravy.  Sorry.

I think this dish is simple and delicious! I can’t understand why someone would write anything negative about it. If desired, add onions or veggies. But it definitely doesn’t deserve a negative review. It’s so hard to believe that grown adults cannot mind their manners and feel the need to write such awful things. Some people need to grow up and learn some respect. I give this recipe 5 stars because there is absolutely nothing wrong  with it. I personally will probably add onions to the margarine flour mix at the beginning next time. I put it over rice and steamed broccoli. My mother makes a very similar sauce and adds the onions to it. She uses the sauce to make a broccoli and cauliflower casserole. This is a simple recipe that is delicious. It’s like comfort food to me :)

I made this recipe as prescribed to give it the benefit of the doubt. I wish I hadn't.

1/4 cup of lemon juice? The end result of that particular ingredient is a disgusting and inedible waste of food!

This was okay. I liked it, though not necessarily enough to cook it again, but my husband couldn't eat it. However, he won't eat several creamy sauces. The chicken and sauce was good served on the mashed potatoes. My sauce separated but tasted fine.
