Used vanilla Greek Yogurt and almond milk.  Consistency was thin, so you'll either have to use a frozen banana or add some ice if you like a thicker smoothie.  Flavor is good, and I'm always looking for new smoothies.  Thanks EatCookLove90 for sharing your recipe.

I used regular vanilla yogurt and a frozen banana. It was a nice consistency and tasted good.

I didn't have Greek yogurt so I used a 100ml Mango-flavoured yogurt I had in the fridge.  This turned out well!
