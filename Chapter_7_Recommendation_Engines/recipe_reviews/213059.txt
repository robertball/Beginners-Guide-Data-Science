This is a good base to build on. I subbed the mascarpone cheese with Fage greek yogurt and added powdered sugar 1/4 c concentrated OJ and some orange rind. My daughter drizzled some agave syrup on hers for added sweetness and it was really good!

I usually make a quiche for Christmas breakfast but it was too labor intensive for me this year so I tried this recipe and got rave reviews. My daughter's fiance said that he felt like he was at an upscale Bed and Breakfast and everyone asked when I am making it next.  Thank you so much for a new family tradition!
