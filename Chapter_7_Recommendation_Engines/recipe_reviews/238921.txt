Great taste but the amount of topping is excessive for one can (15.5 oz) of beans.  The recipe makes enough for perhaps 10 cans of beans.

Great side dish with a couple of changes.  Used one clove of garlic and lightly saute in the oil.  Added 1 can of chick peas to that and lightly browned the chick peas. I also added about 1 tsp of paprika to the crumbs just before I removed them from the pan.  I added the beans to the chick peas and continued with the rest of the recipe.

This is the first Chef John recipe that I made that I did NOT like.  Will never make again.

I had some leftover beans and was looking for a way to use them. They came out ok, I only wish they would have had a little more flavor. I didn't have garlic olive oil so used ramp oil. Maybe it didn't add as much flavor as the garlic would have but I found this to be a nice alternative side dish. Will make again and add a little something to it.  I did use the cayenne, could have used more.

My husband, a vegetarian loves this.  I did, however, do a variation for myself...instead of beans, I replaced the beans with pan fried oysters (no add it, just a little pat of butter), and then add the sand.   Deep fried is just too much for me;  I like it lighter. If you are what you eat--my husband is a nut and I am crustacean.  Or maybe he's a bean and I'm a shell fish? (I did omit the vinegar in both.)
