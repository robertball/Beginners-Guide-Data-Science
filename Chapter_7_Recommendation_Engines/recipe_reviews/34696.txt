This is a good basic recipe, but I agreed with others that it had too much vinegar, and not enough flavor. I cooked mine in the slow cooker on low about 9 hours and that was good. I added brown sugar instead of white, garlic, liquid smoke, ketchup and dijon mustard. That made it better.

WOW!!! Couldn't ask for more: quick and easy to prepare, throw it all in the crockpot, ready when returning from work at the end of the day, house smells wonderful, a totally deeeeeeelicious meal, and after dinner my teen son printed out the recipe and taped it to the refrigerator door with a note which read: DON'T LOSE THIS RECIPE!!! (Great with potato salad or coleslaw and a sliver of watermelon.)

THIS RECIPE IS A WINNER!!! First I tried this recipe on the family. Concensus=SUPERB! (Even the kids loved it.) Then it was my featured dish at a huge family reunion, and though I'd made 175% as much as I thought I'd need, I found that I had to quickly thaw out what I'd frozen up the day before in order to satisfy the crowd. It was that good!! HINT: I found that serving is best with a leaf of lettuce on the bottom bun, which keeps the juices from softening the bun too much. Otherwise, don't change a thing. This recipes freezes well also. And incidentally, I didn't stand a chance of keeping this recipe a secret.

Delicious! Cooked a 5 lb chuck roast in the slow cooker thinking leftovers would be good for lunch the next day. WRONG!! NO leftovers. Great balance of flavors. Substituted dried minced onion, and added some hot sauce for a little kick. Everyone really enjoyed this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was okay.  I cooked the beef in the crockpot on low all day.  I thickened the sauce on the stovetop, but ended up adding bottled barbecue sauce.  This should be called "Shredded Beef Sandwiches", as they are definitely NOT barbecued.  I suggest using crushed tomatoes rather than diced, omitting the extra water, and swapping brown sugar or molasses for white sugar.  A little mustard wouldn't hurt, either.

This tasted incredible!  I changed it quite a bit but the recipe was a good starting point.  I used chicken rather than beef and simmered for an hour and a half.  Then I shredded the chicken and mixed it in with the juice which had thickened quite a bit.  I added more vinegar, Worcestershire sauce (used worcestershire for chicken rather than regular worcestershire), 1/4 cup of tomato sauce, 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce and a little bit of water and simmered that for about 25 minutes.  The meat was so tender and full of flavor.  I will probably use the meat for many recipes in the future, not just sandwiches.  Thanks!

After cooking overnight on high in the crock-pot, I doctored it up a bit, but very tender and just the right moisture after simmering shredded meat in juices for an additional 30 min & serving with tongs to shake off excess moisture.  BBQ sauce on the side but not necessary.  Used brown sugar instead of white.

This was awful - the meat itself was okay, but how was I to make a Barbecue sauce out of the tomato pieces floating in grease?  I took the meat out after cooking, and then shredded and made my own barbecue sauce to put over the meat.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This came out ok but it wasn't very barbeque tasting.  I boiled down the liquid at the end and after using the immersion blender, did come up with a thin sauce that tasted pretty good but didn't really taste like BBQ.

I was a little skeptical because I was afraid it the liquid would evaporate before the meat was too tender to shred or it would be too watery, but it turned out just fine. And the flavor was wonderful. I didn't get a vinegary taste at all. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

This was a great recipe!!!  I've tried other versions and  have found them to be dry and tough.  This was moist and the meat fell apart.  I actually cooked it longer than the 3 hours and add some dijon mustard and garlic for extra flavor.
My son and husband LOVED IT!!!!!!!

The flavor was good, but I think I was expecting the end result to be a red sauce - like a red BBQ sauce and it was not.  I just added a little ketchup and it turned out just fine.

I was really disappointed. The meat came out so runny. It was more like a soup. I followed the recipe to a tee except reduced the amount of vinegar. It had a decent flavor but was just really runny.

Too vinegary and not much other flavor.  The other beef barbeque recipe on this site is much better.

There seemed to be a  huge amount of juices at the end of the cooking time so I drained the juices and added a bottle of Bullseye Original BBQ sauce to make thicker. It was PERFECT once I added the BBQ sauce! Miscellaneous tip...if the meat is still not tender enough at the end of the cooking time, turn the heat to high and cook for another 30 minutes to an hour and then  shredding will be no problem!

Very good!  I would maybe substitute brown sugar for white next time, and maybe add some ketchup to give it more of a "Barbecue" flavor.  All in all, very good, and a great alternative to pot roast for a chuck roast!

This recipe was great!  I used my slow cooker and simply added an extra 1/2 cup of water and cooked it on low about 8 hours.  I also added a little barbecue sauce after it was cooked.

Awesome!  The whole family loved it.  What a great meal.  Used a bread and butter pot roast on the stovetop.  Had to turn once, check bottom early and often and turn down heat a little to prevent burning.  Used less vinegar and added a little water along the way.  End result was a new family favorite.

I followed to the T. The juice from the tomatoes , vinegar and water dried out and I had to keep adding water. The medium heat caused the meat to burn on 1 side. The meat did not get very tender. The flavopr was ok and I added more sugar and some ketchup to recipe at the end after I shredded the meat to give it some juice. It had a slight burnt taste and was a little tough.

Although the flavor was good - I used the advice of many here and did not drain my tomatoes - then it was too much like a stew and I could not pour it on the rolls for the sandwiches.  I tried to make repairs by adding a bottle of bbq sauce - but still too soupy.  Not a great success for me.

I use chicken breasts instead of beef, and serve this either in tortilla shells or on potatoe rolls.  Very delicious and Very easy.

Good, basic recipe. Added brown sugar and a little bit of regular old BBQ sauce. Made a lot. Also reduced the onion amount down to one.

This was very tasty, we ate it over rice.  The kids loved it and we had left overs the next night.

This was very good, but I prefer pork for this kind of dish.

THIS IS TASTY, THO I DID CHANGE IT A BIT. I USED BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS INSTEAD OF BEEF. I TOOK THE ADVICE OF A FEW OTHER REVIEWS AND CUT DOWN ON THE VINEGAR AND ADDED BBQ SAUCE WHEN IT WAS DONE.

this was a good recipe but not what i expected.  i used the crockpot set on high for 3 hours.  i got impatient (and didn't crack the lid as suggested) and boiled it on the stove for 15 minutes.  it was good on hogie bread with bbq sauce.

This is very simple and tastes amazing!!! I did, however use larger tomato pieces since the kids don't like them.  That made it easy to pick them out of the kid's servings.  My 4 year old and 1 year old loved this!

This was as easy as the recipe said it was.  Great flavor, and it smelled so good while it was cooking.  My daughter loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

I thought this had too strong of a vinegar taste.  I added a bit more sugar, but i think it just wasn't the recipe that I was looking for.

I made this in my slow cooker.  Although I didn't care for the taste, I was able to make it into a savory meal by adding a bottle of bbq sauce.

Excellent prepared in the crockpot.  I used a chuck roast.  Everyone enjoyed barbeque indoors.

I put this in the crockpot and let it go all day.  Yum!  Used leftovers for beef burritos, that was delicious.
