I made this dish for a bbq.  The changes I made were that I didn't use the bacon, used vegetarian baked beans, and cooked in a crockpot instead of the oven.  These were a complete hit!  Thank you for offering such a wonderful and delious recipe!

This is a recipe that I have beem looking for and finally found thanks to responses from folks in the community area of the web site.  I made just put everything in a crock pot, and cooked it on low for about 6 hours. The only difference is I used Splenda Brown Sugar instead of regular brown sugar.  Excellent recipe and thanks JOAN for sharing it!  Happy Day! Heart

Let me start off by saying that normally I do not like garbanzo beans or Lima beans or butter beans. I made it though because I hadn't had them since I was a kid and my kids have never tried them. This recipe was rated so highly I thought it would be  worth trying. IT WAS SO GOOD! I added a smoked sausage to it cut into coins and  made corn muffins and had it as a main dish. It was so good. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Made for a party of 11 adults and 3 kids around 7-9 yrs of age.  It was the hit of the party surpassing chicken nuggets.  I put it in a slow cooker and just let it go for at least five hours.  Still outstanding!!   My husband says "Put that in your 'keeper' file!

If I could give this more than five stars, I would.  We absolutely loved this bean salad!  I didn't have any cider vinegar, so I substituted white and it turned out wonderful.  Thank you so much for the recipe, Joan!!!

This was delish!  I was forced to make one change for the mustard powder - - I thought I had some on hand but had to substitute about 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard at the last minute.  This dish was wonderful, even with my substitution.  It is earmarked for future pot lucks and holidays!  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!

Very tasty, and a healthy dish. Substituted 1 lb. garlic herb & sun dried tomato chicken sausage for the bacon, and made this as the main course for dinner.

So yummy...I made the vegetarian version. I omitted the bacon and sauteed the onion in  olive oil. I used real mustard (yellow) and real garlic (3 cloves). I  substituted beans. I used, black and pinto along with the garbanzo and baked. It did take quite a while to make. I might attempt it again in a crock pot. Definately worth the wait.

Love this!  I omit the bacon to make it vegetarian and just use a little veg oil to saute the onions.  Also 28oz can of veg baked beans.  Its perfect for crockpot too.  Just make sauce as directed but put all in crockpot instead of oven.  Thanks!  I've been making this since I originally printed it out in 02/2007 and thought I'd finally review it while I was forwarding it to a friend.  :)

I LOVED this recipe!!!  First off, although I have learned to like beans, they aren't my "go-to" option usually.  But this recipe, with five kinds of beans, was AWESOME!  The only thing added that wasn't original was a link of Hillshire Farms smoked sausage.  I decreased the onion and probably had extra bacon in it.  I loved it the first day I made it and loved it more on day 2!  My kids weren't thrilled, but hubbie and I enjoyed it.

Loved the recipe, very easy to throw together. Only change I made was that I added some hamburger, turned out excellent. I'm saving this one for future use.  Thank you for sharing.

Very Yummy. I added smoke sausage to make it a meal instead of a side dish. I also cooked it in the crock pot. My son (5) who loves beans ate 2 bowls full. Thank you for a great recipe

These were great! I made them for Easter dinner. There were only two of us for dinner, but I ate up the leftovers within two days! Great, easy side dish. Nice replacement for baked beans.

I really enjoyed this dish, but my husband said that he prefers traditional baked beans over these sweet & sour beans.  I will definitely make them again, but only when I am prepared to eat the leftovers myself!

I have made this recipe multiple times and every time it turns out so good! I love that its relatively simple as well. I normally don't use all 5 types of beans, just whatever I have on hand (kidney, cannelloni & pinto usually).

I didn't care for this recipe. It seemed like a lot of work for something that didn't taste that good.  I would've been more content opening a can of baked beans and eating that. My husband enjoyed this dish more than I did, but he also didn't spend all the time preparing it.  I won't make this again.

Really excellent Bean dish.  Hearty and tasty.  We used veggie bacon too and it tasted great!  I use the crock-pot to cook it so I don't have to wait around 1 1/2 hrs.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it for our senior citizen Christmas lunch as a side dish for the ham, and it was perfect.  The changes I made was to add one chopped red bell pepper to the onion and sauteed them together.  I drained and rinsed all of the beans, except the baked beans, and then added 1/2 can water.  That kept the casserole from looking cloudy.  Also, I used black-eyed peas in place of garbanzo beans.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!!

I usually use Turkey bacon for everything, but I just don't think the beans were as good w/o the real stuff.  Plus, turkey bacon doesn't crumble as well as real bacon so the consistency was a little off.  The flavor was great and throwing it all into a crockpot makes for an easy side for a BBQ.  I will definitely make this again but w/real bacon.

I've made this for family get togethers and never have enough.  If your family likes baked beans I'd recommend trying this recipe.

I made this for Easter because I had all the ingredients on hand and was out of town before the holiday. It was super. I took home the leftovers and ate it for the next several days happily. I didn't have mustard powder and bacon, I didn't add the onions but used onion powder, and I didn't use the kidney beans either due to lack of space in my bowl. It was still fantastic.

This one was very different from anything I've fixed before. It tasted ok. Don't know if I would fix it again. It didn't have the "Wow thats good" and nobody wanted the recipe, which is how I know if my family likes it.

I am now the official bean maker for family gatherings, since I made this for my son's cowboy birthday party lunch.  They were a hit!  Love the flavor and the variety of bean shapes and textures.  YUM!

I thought these beans were awesome! I made them for a camp out that I was supposed to bring a side dish to and these were perfect. My mom tasted them and wrote down the recipe right then in her recipe book. Which says a lot! I didn't get any compliments however from anyone at the camp out (about 13 people) Not sure why - maybe people don't get that excited about beans!

Excellent in every way!! I used uncured bacon and thawed a bag of frozen lima beans.  I also did not bake it uncovered at the end- it seemed like it would be too dry.  Can't wait to reheat leftovers!!
