Well of course I like it, I submitted it.  Just wanted to add that I use SLICED water chestnuts that I then halve.  Enjoy.

Thanks Sandy for a great recipe! The only thing I added was a little ground black pepper. Served this over a bed of butter lettuce and received nothing but raves. Will certinely add to my recipe box.

Made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  There is enough crunch from the water chestnuts and almonds so I omitted the celery.  I had some shortly after I made it, and the water chestnuts distinctly tasted like the lemon juice.  However, when I had some the next day, all the flavors had melded together perfectly and it was awesome!  (I didn't add the grapes when I made it because I've done this before to other chicken salads and it makes it a bit watery and unattractive.  So I just add in some grapes right before I serve it.)   This chicken salad is much better the next day. Thanks for posting the recipe!

Thank you Thank you - this is the best chicken salad and so worth the effort to make.  Major Grey's chutney makes this chicken salad indeed heavenly!

Thanks so much Sandy! Absolutely fantastic!
Used to make a similar chicken salad with cashews. Loved the addition of water chestnuts and lemon juice!
