I thought the cereal sounded weird but it was surprising good.  I had to prepare it ahead of time for a camping trip.  Everyone liked it.

My mom always made a version of this salad every holiday. She would substitute whipped topping for the sour cream, since she didn't like sour cream. There were also no cornflakes in the salad, but I imagine they would be a good change every once in awhile.

As simple of this is...and it's soo simple you'd think me serving this would have gotten rave reviews.....it didn't. I served this to 5 kids and 2 adults. The adults were more into it but, the thoughts was the coconut dried the salad in the tastebud department...now the kids...well this wasn't as kid friendly as I had hoped. While I KNOW all the kids love all the ingredients...but the coconut. So I tried again making it without the coconut. And then, they liked it a little bit better. But complained it wasn't sweet enough for them. And the youngest out of the bunch only ate the pineapple. So go figure. Sorry for the poor rating. Maybe whipped topping would be better and sugar coated cornflake cereal.

Made this salad for the guys are work and they gobbled it up.  Use whipped cream instead of sour cream because that's what I had... and no cornflakes because I didn't have any on hand.
