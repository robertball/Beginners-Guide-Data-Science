My husband says this is in my top 3 cakes ever. I too hate for people to judge a recipe when they didnt make it correctly, BUT just to let you know an OPTION, I used all cranberries (no dates), TripleSec (orange liquor)and pecans in the bottom of my bundt pan. Wonderfully moist and delicious!  I am sure if you use dates and cranberry liguor
it would be perfection...

One of my favorite recipes--only difference is that mine calls for 1 tablespoon soda in place of 1 teaspoon each soda and baking powder.  Even people who do not like fruit cake usually like this one.

This was delicious! So moist and flavourful. Like another reviewer, I didn't have any cranberry liqueur so I simmered a handful or so of cranberries in water and sugar then mooshed the cranberries once they were cooked and added that to the batter. I made the cake in the afternoon and served it for New Year's dinner and the cake soaked up most of the sauce that pooled around the bottom. I didn't find it too sweet at all. Just perfect!

First of all I have been making a recipe very similar to this one, with a few exceptions for over 30 years (yet ours didn't have any alcohol or liqueur in it not even vanilla, it called for a cup of chopped and toasted nuts and the glaze called for a bit more sugar, but other than that it is the same).  These cakes make a great gift, and are usually a big hit at every holiday dinner party.  This cake is super moist with the soaking glaze. I remember mom always making this on Christmas Eve for our Christmas dinner, but to our surprise, dad always cut into it first thing on Christmas morning once he discovered just how good it really was. It became a tradition of ours from then on to have a slice while opening our Christmas presents.  Sip a fine cup of coffee or your favourite tea with a slice of this, and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how splendid this really is.

Thank you Staceyo for helping me relive some wonderful family memories of some long past Christmases. I'm ready to bake some more

My mom made this for a church potluck and only half of the cake made it out because the kitchen helpers helped themselves over and over.
We had to make a substitution as did not have any cranberry - flavor liqueur so she simmered fresh cranberries with a bit of water until they reduced enough to strain syrup off - it worked and the cake came out beautiful.  I was stopped by many requesting the recipe.

I didn't change a thing and it was superb! The cake was moist and, between my husband and I, it took us 5 days before finishing and it was still delicious, not dry at all. I didn't have cranberry liquor so instead I added regular cranberry juice. Definitely a keeper with a nice orange icing...yummy in the tummy! Thank you so much StaceyO for sharing this wonderful recipe

So moist! I did not have the oj, orange or orange liquer or dates. But I did have my homemade cranberry apple orange relish with walnuts left over from Thanksgiving the day before. I just added more chopped walnuts because I like them. Did not do the icing (cutting back on sugar)& the cake was sweet enough without it. Will make again next year!

Loved it. I did not have cranberry-flavored liqueur so I upped the OJ to 1/2 cup. Added the zest from two navel oranges. I also added 1/2 tsp orange extract, but I may skip it next time. Oh yes, there is a next time. In fact, I can't wait to make this again for a potluck. Compliments? Yes, please.

This cake is awesome.  I had no dates so I used raisins and added 1 cup chopped toasted walnuts.  No cranberry liqueur so I boiled down some cranberries with water and sugar, processed in mini chop and added to batter.  I took it to an event yesterday and there was not a crumb left.  One guy actually ate the crumbs off the plate.  Next time I am going to use dried cranberries for the dates and try using part brown sugar in batter and glaze.

This was pretty good. I skipped dates and added some more cranberries. I also didn't  have any orange zest. I made it in a bundt pan, and it was not full.
