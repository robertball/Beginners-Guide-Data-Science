I had a couple packets of organic apples and cinnamon oatmeal in the pantry I found. Thanks to the ingredient search on AllRecipes, I was able to use them in a sort-of new way. I didn't have almond butter so I used creamy peanut butter instead and I omitted the almonds, only because I didn't have any. The apple I used was a Sweet Tango. The kids thought this was great--they ate every bite. Next time, I'll try this with regular oats, I'll just cook it 4 minutes in the microwave.

Quick, easy and delicious! Perfect for when you need a hearty and healthy breakfast - fast!  I didn't have almond butter on hand so I left that out, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. A perfect mix of fruit and nuts with a nice touch of sweetness!

It seems like a ridiculous amount of work to then use instant oatmeal.  Use the real oatmeal.  As a timesaver, I cook a whole pot and store the leftovers in the refrigerator.  It keeps beautifully and reheats in the microwave well.  I make mine with coconut flakes, cinnamon, vanilla extract, some chopped nuts--whatever I have in the freezer, flax seed.  I find that it tastes rather like rice pudding; sometimes at night I'll have some of the leftovers cold--then it really tastes like rice pudding.  You could put in raisins; I'm just not a big raisin fan.

This is absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed is I used organic old-fashioned oats and cooked them in milk. Cooking in milk makes it taste just like instant oatmeal for those of us who grew up on instant and decided to make the switch to old-fashioned. All you have to do is use 1 part oats to 2 parts whole milk. Cook on med heat and stir constantly til the milk has thickened and the oats are the consistency/texture you prefer. I've used honey to sweeten, but when I was out of honey, I tried maple syrup and it was delicious as well. It's very filling, not to mention packed with tons of vitamins and healthy fats . My kids rave over this every time I fix it. My husband even likes it and he has never cared for oatmeal.

An instant boost in the AM. I love adding almond butter to my oatmeal, it makes it so much creamier.

So yummy! I didn't have almonds, almond butter, or honey, so I ended up changing it quite a bit, but this is a great outline for a great bowl of oatmeal!! I used peanut butter and a bit of brown sugar. And I cooked the oatmeal in the microwave. Since I don't like raw apples, I cut the apples up very small, and I cooked them in the microwave with the oatmeal. It was delicious!

I really enjoy this oatmeal in the morning. It's so hearty and warming before I head out the door. I do not use instant oatmeal but the old fashion oats

It was very good! It took me about 10 minutes to make. I would definitely make it again!
