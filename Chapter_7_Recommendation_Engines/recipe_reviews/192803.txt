I am the recipe submitter.  This recipe is meant to be made with raw cutup chicken.  It's very tasty when made as written.

I used real new potatoes instead of canned and it worked out great.  My 4 year old loved it and it was incredibly easy to make.

This tasted great. It took way longer for mine to get done. Probably because my free range chicken weighed almost 6 pounds and I used fresh potatoes. Great recipe though!

This is the best, moistest chicken you can imagine. I have been making this for years & now my children & Grand children are making it too. The only difference in the way I make it is... I use a whole chicken, stuff the sauerkraut inside & around the chicken. Roast it until the chicken is done ( the juice runs clear when poked by the thigh) I serve it with mashed potatoes & mix the sauerkraut in( on my plate) You can;t get any better than this. ALL the flavors blend together to make a wonderful tasting meal.

This was terrible. I chose one star because I had to to be able to submit my review. I would not suggest this to anyone. It tasted awful and will stink your entire house up while cooking.

I love chicken and sauerkraut. The acid from the kraut marinates the chicken as it bakes making it moist and delicious. I am of German heritage so the smell of kraut doesn't bother me a bit. It reminds me of my grandmother's house. I changed the recipe a bit. I added a can of drained diced tomatoes, 3 Tbsp of brown sugar, celery seeds and a grated granny smith apple or two to the sauerkraut. Cover the chicken with the kraut and bake. Yum!!

I altered this a bit by using chicken thighs, which I browned before adding to the casserole, and adding chopped fresh cabbage along with a thinly sliced raw potato and the sauerkraut. I also added a little chicken broth and some water before baking since I didn't have any tin foil to cover it. 
It baked in about 70 minutes and tasted wonderful! It's definitely comfort food but also pretty healthy, especially with the extra cabbage. The only thing I'd do differently when I make it again is double the garlic.

Quick to put together.  Tastes ok, something is missing though.  May have to play with this one.  I used sliced potato's and fresh chicken breasts.  They worked fine.

Well I shredded a store bought pre-cooked chicken and this recipe did not turn out well. It needed something else and maybe less kraut. The kraut was very overwhelming.

I made this last night substituted with chicken tenders, baby red potatoes, and Bavarian style sauerkraut... it was amazing! I also used grape seed oil instead of butter, for a lower calorie count. My husband, who is a huge fan of sauerkraut, cleaned his plate, and asked if there was more. Oh, I also added crushed red pepper flakes, for a bit of heat.

I read reviews and thought this recipe has good potential - I made is with a little modifications, and it was YUMMY! I got kudos from my family, everybody went for seconds. I followed the original recipe and added 1. more spices - half teaspoon celery salt, a few whole peppercorns, a few bay leaves and a few coriander seeds; 2. two sliced apples to add flavor (I think tart apples like Granny Smith work best here). As far as potatoes, I boiled white baby potatoes first, then halved them and added under the chicken pieces so that they would absorb juices. The dish was wonderful - very warming and satisfying. Thank you so much for that recipe, Geroniho!

A cheap dish to make and reassuringly filling in the winter months, it is something of a rural classic. Technically the vinegar from canned or Jar based Kraut infuses flavour into the chicken and I found this dish seems to work better with cut pieces of chicken. Adding a smaller amount of garlic allows the other flavours to come through and  adding a spoon of uncrushed red peppercorns helps to augment the Kraut flavour. Lightly precooking the potatoes in boiling water before adding also helped.
In terms of pairing with drinks this dish goes well with Beer and white wines, Alsace Gewurztraminer is a classic pairing.

I made this as written but didn't have garlic, I did use garlic powder however. It turned out delicious. If you enjoy sauerkraut you will like this recipe!

I finally found the perfect kraut. I made it exactly as written.  I loved that it wasn't as sour as your average kraut, I couldn't stop eating it. Boyfriend loved it too!

I sauteed- skin on breasts and portioned in half, added red onions for color and the garlic and one good sized chorizo sausage in bite sized slices as the chicken and sausage simmered the in the water drained from the kraut, I boiled the potatoes and added a tsp of chicken boullion paste to the water. When the potatoes were 3/4 done I layered kraut, potatoes chicken and sausage, topped another half cup of kraut and the last few potatoes, for the topping several slices of bacon chopped and a sprinkle of white cheddar cheese. In the oven for another 35 minutes at 350F. The chicken was moist, sausage complimentary, potatoes perfectly cooked. The crust was perfect and the garnish was a large dollop of sour cream! Das is gud!

I used boneless chicken breast it was really good. I would recommend addeing onions and a bit of salt and peper.
