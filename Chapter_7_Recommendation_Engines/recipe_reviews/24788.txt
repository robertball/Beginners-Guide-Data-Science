This turned out great.  I made a few modifications:  NO BEANS! I have lived in Texas for 27 years and no one has ever served me KRC with beans in it. We serve the beans on the side! Also, I used a mix of corn and flour tortillas.  This is a terrific recipe for it, not too much of anything - a perfect blend.  This casserole was derived from the famous King Ranch, in Kingsville, Tx. AAA+++ for flavor.

This recipe is a lot like a chicken enchilada recipe that I usually make, but this recipe is so much easier and quicker.  5 stars from my husband and 4 stars from me.  I used a 10 oz can of rotel tomatoes instead of the 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and it was perfect, not too soupy.

I really tried to like this recipe but my whole family just choked it down, which was a bummer because it is not the cheapest casserole to make with all it's ingredients. I followed the recipe to a tee but it was just yucky...maybe it needs corn tortillas rather than flour as they tend to become a mushy, floury mess.  Abyhow, it didn't work for me.

NEVER use flour tortillas in King Ranch Casserole!  They make the casserole gummy.  Only corn tortillas!

Very good casserole.  Husband loved it!  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  Used green pepper instead of red, plain cooked pinto beans with added 1 T. chili powder and 0.5 tsp cumin, and 16 corn tortillas instead of flour.  Had wonderful flavor and was not dry at all.  Will definitely make again.

excellent and MUCH easier than my old recipe!  i made is as directed and it came out just right!  i used one of those mesquite flavored roasted chickens from the deli at the grocery store to cut down on cooking time and it was wonderful!  oh, i did put the beans ON THE SIDE, as that is how we do it here in Texas :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe.  Subbed corn tortillas because what I had on hand.  My husband raved it was the best chicken dish I made in some time.  I knew I would like it but surprised me that my husband didn't just say it was okay.  I will be making it again for sure!

We loved this!  I used flour tortillas and had no problem, tho I used only 10- 8" tortillas rather than 12.  I also determined that 1/2 cup of the chicken broth created the right consistency of the soup mixture rather than a whole cup. It's a great left over.  Will definitely make this easy-to-make casserole again!

This is a family favorite!  The best part is that it is easily customizable to accomodate taste preferences and on-hand ingredients.  I prefer using Rotel and corn tortillas, but have made it exactly as the recipe states and have found it yummy as well!

Alterations made for personal preferance were corn tortillas-diced, whole chicken deboned, layered sauteed onions in olive oil. It was fantastic.

I made this for the first time when friends came over.  They loved it!  I sauted the onions and red peppers to soften them in butter first and then added the soup ingredients.  I also used ranch style beans and drained them because they are my favorite!  I used Rotel and didn't add the chicken broth to the mixture to make it less runny.  I also used corn tortillas and only 2 cups of cheese on top.  Baked for 45 minutes based on other reviews that it needs to be cooked longer.  Added sour cream to the servings when it was dished up.  Yum!

This recipe is great!  I accidentally put extra green chiles in there, but it turned out great!  I would also suggest layering a very small layer of the mixture on the bottom first to help moisten the first layer of tortillas.

DO not use beans nor flour tortillas.  Use 8 corn tortillas instead and only 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I have substituted Doritos tortilla/corn chips for the corn tortillas also. Be sure and add onion and salt and pepper to the water that the chicken is boiling in. Been a Texan for over 50 years, no beans ever in the King Ranch Casserole. Would not make ithis recipe as it is.t as is.

This is a pretty good recipe. I did make a few changes, and I agree that it did come out a bit soupy. I didn't have a bell pepper on hand so I  used celery instead. I sauteed the onion and the celery and added some cumin in butter until soft. Then I added it to the soup mix. I did sub out the mushroom soup for cream of celery and added a 1/2 cup sour cream to the soup mix.  I also used 1/2 monterrey jack and half sharp cheddar, and I used salsa wheat tortillas instead of white flour ones. I agree with another review that the flour tortillas make it a bit gummy so I might either use the tortilla chips or corn tortillas next time. I also skipped the first step by buying and dicing a rotisserie chicken. Yummy. I did use both rotel tomatoes and the can of green chilis as well as a 3 tsp. of chili powder because my husband likes things with a kick. He and his dad loved it. They gave it five stars.

Was pretty easy to make.  I would prepare the chicken ahead of time though to make this fairly quickly after work on a week night.  My very picky husband even liked it so its a winner in our house!

Followed instructions, but was very soupy.  The flavor was good, so my husband placed all the casserole contents into a skillet to cook down.  While it cooked, he cut the tortilla strips into smaller pieces. After that, it was great and more of a traditional, thicker consistency.  Not sure if my strips were too big, or if my organic cream soups were too runny.

This was absolutely EXCELLENT!  I did make a couple of changes, though.  I used what I had on hand.  I used onion powder instead of onions (family doesn't like onions and bell peppers).  I also used Rotel chili fixings instead of just tomatoes.  I also used 1 can of kidney beans (no chili beans) and a can of refried beans.  It turned out absolutely awesome!  My whole entire family ate it (not too spicy).  Even my picky kids and my toddler loved it.

Really a big winner at home.  Doesn't look to appealing when mixing things up, but the taste and smell more than makes up for it.  I used flour tortillas and they worked just fine.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!!

Prepared this for the first time for 25 people and got wonderful remarks, and gave the recipe to several guests.  Only thing I would do different is use Rotel rather than a regular diced tomato with green chilies.  Rotel has a bit of a spicier bite to it.  Terribly easy to fix too !

This was really very tasty!  I left the beans out, as I had never had it prepared that way.  I also made a batch without the tortillas for a chicken - cheese soup.

Great recipe! I crock pot an entire 5lb bag of chicken breasts with 1 stick of butter, and a jar of my favorite hot sauce. I kept the beans on the side. I almost doubled the recipe to make additional layers. I added a cup of Velveeta chunks, 3 small sweet peppers, a can of fire roasted tomatoes w/garlic. To help with thickening I added strips of flour tortillas to the mix which worked perfectly! With each layer I added a layer of corn tortillas then the sauce and chicken mix plus a mix of cheddar and Monterrey Jack cheese. I got four thumbs up thus far. Thanks for the basic recipe!

This was very delicious! I used corn tortillas as other people suggested, but otherwise left the recipe as is. Very cheap to make and lots of leftovers - perfect since I'm in college!

I'm wondering if there is an error in the recipe! The ingredients call for flour tortillas, but the instructions refer to corn tortillas. 

I made it with flour tortillas and agree with another reviewer that the tortillas were soggy and not good. The photo shows something more substantial on the bottom layer, but I can assure you, that was not the case with my efforts! 

The ingredients would be correct for standard Kings Ranch casserole....IF it had corn tortillas. 

I see others have been happy with the results, so maybe they did something different!

This was okay, I was expecting a lot more after reading the reviews. The tortillas really ruined this for me, they didn't add anything texture/taste wise, only were a gluey chewey part throughout the casserole. Might make it again skipping the tortillas entirely.

I made 2 versions of the recipe I split the soup and made one with tortillas and one with tortilla chips. Hands down the tortilla chips won. My sons and I devoured it.I didnt add cream of chicken soup, beans, or bell peppers and it still came out perfect.I had to bake it about 45 min more than what recipe call for because after 20 min it still looked very soupy. Very good will make with tortilla chips. I give the tortilla recipe 3 stars

This recipe was great.  I made a few changes to fit my family's liking... I skipped the cream of mushroom soup, red pepper, and had beans on the side.  I used fresh tomato instead of canned.  I also added chili pepper and cumin as some of the other users had suggested.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did use corn tortillas, added some garlic powder to the soup mixture, and used 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 Monterey Jack.

This was a great recipe!  It turned out to taste very "oniony" so I'll leave the onions out next time or maybe just use 1/2 cup, but overall it is an excellent dish and I will definately make it again.

A friend gave me a modified version of this recipe using a dozen corn tortillas (in place of the flour tortillas) and using 2 cups of Cheddar Cheese (instead of the 3 cup Jack Cheese combo).  If you cook the chicken in and aluminum pouch in the oven (450 degrees for 30 minutes) you can use the juice from the chicken itself instead of using the chicken broth and boullion cube.  This was a delicious recipe that I recently took to a Potluck of Anthropology Professors (one raised in Milan and one raised in Central America).  Adults and kids alike loved it (especially the afore mentioned Professors) and it lasted only 20 minutes on the buffet table.  Great Recipe!

Thought it was very good. Took it to a church potluck, came home with an empty dish. Alot of complements on it. I made one sllight change, I cooked the flour tortillas in a dry cast iron skillet first. That way they did not get mushy in the casserole. Other than that I made no changes to the recipe. First time I try a recipe I follows the directions exactly. How can you honestly rate a receipt that you have changed to fit your tastes.

It was okay. It's really similar to my enchalada casserole. I've never heard of King Ranch casserole before so maybe it's a type of enchalada casserole. I did add a little bit of corn and once I served the dish I topped with sour cream, green onions, black olives and fresh cut tomatoes.  The sour cream on top really made it better.  Liked it but will stick to my own chicken enchalada recipe.

I made this recipe and my family loved it. But I did make a couple of alterations , instead of the 12 flour tortillas I used 6 and then added crisp tortilla chips aabout half a bag. this made it less soggy, I omitted the chicken bouillon. I used cheddar cheese instead of the colby-monterey.
It is a very easy and quick to fix recipe, just wonderful. thanks

My husband really enjoyed it. However, he wants me to use crispy tortilla chips next time. He requested I keep the recipe and try it again. I think I just need to tweak it to our taste buds, so, thanks for the recipe.

First of all: TERRIFIC!!
I found out 2 weeks ago that I have gallstones, and cannot eat any fat at all.  For two weeks I have had nothing but bran and salads.  Well, not anymore, I just used low fat/no fat on the ingredients and I am not sick!! My 3 yo, 8 yo and 10 yo all asked for 2nds and 3rds and husband ranks it as a new favorite! Thank you so much, quick easy and good too!

I made this recipe, but I only used one can of chili - no beans, instead of 2 cans of chili beans.  I also only used 1 cup of cheese.  It was outstanding!  My boyfriend is hard to please and he said it was one of the best meals he's ever had.  (and his mom is a great cook!)

Yum!! Entire family enjoyed this one! Living in Texas makes it really hard to find a tex-mex meal that everyone enjoys.  But, with this recipe you can't go wrong!  (only caution would be for the youngsters - my 6 year old thought it was too spicy......but loved all the cheese!!)

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I have children, and thought the beans would turn them off, but not really.  My oldest and husband loved it!  I usually use more onion than others.  I used jar roasted red peppers (fresh too expensive), and it was fine.  I'm prone to spicey, so I'll probably add additional chili peppers next time.  I'm glad I found this recipe. It was even better warmed the second day. Thanks, Carol!

I like this recipe better than my old one, but, being from Texas,  I did not use beans, and don't know any Texan who does.  Also, I used corn tortillas, not flour.   That's how we made it in TX.  Also I added a bit of chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder for a little more zip.  Delicioso!

I've always used Nacho Doritos and it's so delicious with corn or hominy, hot rolls and a lettuce salad

Tried this tonight my partner loved it. I had to sub a few things and I found 2 cans of soup way to much and only used one and no water. It was plenty runny. I used chopped Jalapeno for the chiles and a can of chilli for the little bit of chicken and beans I was missing. I had too much sauce at that point. I did not shred the tortillas but rather layered it all in a pie plate and added shredded cheese to every layer. Served with Greek yogurt on the side. Very tasty. Thanks

This was awesome! I didn't have cream of mushroom so I added a large can of cream of chicken. I also sauted onion with some fresh mushrooms. I added a sm can of green chilis and 1/4 can of green enchilada sauce! It was perfect everyone cleaned their plater even my 23 month!

Made this for dinner last night and the husband loved it!  Great flavors, just enough spice, and very hearty.  It will become a staple in our home. Thanks!

I have made this recipes many times.  I do change a couple of things.  I don't like to bite onions, so I use onion powder.  I also use roasted red peppers, they add a different flavor.  I also add in some garlic, powdered or fresh, depending on what I have.  Always comes out great and makes wonderful leftovers!!!

Too soupy. Also, there was not anything exciting or different about the dish.

very nice and tasty, a little hard to get out in one piece though.
