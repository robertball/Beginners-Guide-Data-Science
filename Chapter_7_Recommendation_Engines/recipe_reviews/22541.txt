I found this in the Vegetarian recipe index. This is most certainly NOT vegetarian, since it contains gelatin!

I made this with raspberry jello and brought it to the office to get reviews.  Everyone loved it (I didn't tell them what was in it until they tried it!)  The consensus was that it was a little on the sweet side...maybe it could be made with pectin instead of some of the sugar?  I am anxious to try some other flavors!
