My wife and I find this to be an outstanding recipe.  We used my mother-in-laws pint gift jar of mincemeat that was spicy enough (no need to add spices as suggested by another reviewer).  Zest from an orange was a nice complement.  DO NOT MAKE CONFECTION topping until you taste the sweetness.  We will cut pack on a third of the sugar which ruins an otherwise excellent treat.

These are AMAZING. I made them for a recent buffet feast we had at our home and EVERYONE loved them. I ended up having to print out copies of this recipe. I left off the frosting too as they are already just super sweet and pretty by themselves.

This is a delicious recipe.  As suggested by others, I did not add the icing.  The bars are plenty sweet without it.  I may add some walnuts next time.  These freeze well.

These are delicious!  I didn't have any oranges, so I used a teeny bit of lemon juice.  We can't stop eating these!

A wonderful alternative to date squares!  Absolutely DO NOT add the additional iced topping as suggested!!  These mincemeat goodies are plenty sweet.  Adding the extra icing would just ruin them.

These are my new favorite Christmas cookie!!!  I have been looking for a simplified mincemeat pie recipe since I attended a semester of college in London---the refectory at my school had mini-mincemeat pies every day for the entire month of December....and I NEVER tired of them!  These bars come close in flavor, without all the hassle of making your own mincemeat, or bothering with a crust.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used an entire (27-oz) jar of mincemeat, and just zested a whole orange instead of measuring.  Thank you so much for this recipe--it will definitely be a tradition in my family from now on!!!

Thanks Rosina.  These are GREAT and I have made them MANY times...always a success.  I also use different preserves, apricot, orange.  Try one of your favorites.  I would hesitate using grape since it may be too runny.  ENJOY!!!

Didn't really like it much.  Each family member only ate 1/2 when I gave them a small bar of it.  I froze it hoping that it might be better after it was frozen.  Probably not.

Oh, yum!  These are really good & buttery.  I made them using a homemade mincemeat recipe that I found on this website.  It already had orange peel in it so I did not add anymore.  I baked them in my Pampered Chef bar pan & probably could have baked them for less time than the recipe called for.  They were a little hard around the edges, but still yummy.  I think the recipe would also be good with raspberry pie filling & chocolate chips.

Really good!  Tastes like a bitesized mince pie.  Easy to make.  Adding ginger 
frosting instead of orange is a tasty variation.

I used a whole jar of good quality mincemeat (750ml) and the zest from a whole orange (as another reviewer suggested) otherwise everything else stayed the same.  These are delicious!!  So much easier than tarts.  I would also line the pan with parchment or something to make getting out of the pan easier and easier cleanup afterward.  Excellent recipe thanks!

Wonderful!!  I did do a slight "goof" - I wasn't paying attention and forgot to bake the crust first, before putting the mincemeat in (I used a large jar and added walnuts as well!).  Fortunately - I just doubled the bake time - and with my oven - it came out perfect!!!  Will make again!!!!!!!!  Oh - also - didn't use the frosting at all - but would have been nice - had with vanilla ice cream instead.

These are great - just like date squares only I don't like dates much so mincemeat is a nice change. The best part is the yummy oatmeal base and top!

Thanks to my mom's mincemeat cake, I find myself buying marked down jars of mincemeat, after Christmas. But, mom's cake is a lot of work.  So, I stumbled across this recipe, looking for a way to use my mincemeat. I like this one a lot!  I like how easy it is.  I have not made this recipe, as written.  I agree with other reviews; the bars are sweet enough, without icing.  I also used an entire 27 oz jar of mincemeat, to avoid having leftover mincemeat.  I thought the amount was perfect.  I used the zest of a lemon, because I didn't have an orange, on hand. I loved the flavor! They are sweet; I wonder if they would be better with a pie crust/shortbread type bottom...something salty to counter the sweet.  However, having the same for the crust and crumb topping makes things easy. So, I may never get around to trying a different crust. If you like mincemeat, give these a try!

OMG!!!!  I just made this following the instructions precisely!!  I NEVER WANT MINCE PIE AGAIN  These are incredible tasting, give the same satisfaction as mince pie, so much easier, and actually preferred by those who like the mince spicy tasty without eating large portions of mince filling such as you get with pies!  Oh..thank you for giving me something easy and delicious to bake, particularly this year when I cannot do my usual heavy duty holiday baking!

Mincemeat pie was a family tradition when I was growing up.  Unfortunately, my family does not like it.  However, these bars are so yummy that my family loved them and I'm getting ready to make a second batch! (Made per recipe...didn't change a thing.)

This was wonderful!  Our family enjoyed it more than pie.  We make our own homemade mincemeat filling from our home grown apples......it was delicious!  Will make many times again and share with family

This was a easy to make and delicious.  Im not a fan of mincemeat but I have a few jars and thought I'd make something for the older people in the family.   I loved it.  Didn't put icing on because it is real sweet with the brown sugar.  Added nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger.  Lemon juice.   Very easy, and everyone is going to love it.   I have a great picture but it's too hard to put on here from my iPad.  Don't know why.

I halved the recipe and made it in an 8 x 8 pyrex and it still turned out so good.  I did not add any zest to my mincemeat because I liked it just the way it was.  I also did the icing and it was just right for me.  Maybe it depends on the sweetness of the mincemeat you are using as to whether or not you should use the icing.

a very nice change of pace from pies/tarts due to the ease of preparation.  I did measure out 2 cups of mincemeat and when I spread it on the crust, it was very scant, and leaving some areas very bare not covered at all.  I did end up using the whole jar of mince, and that really is the way to go because there is only about 1/3 of a cup left over from the jar anyway, and what am I going to do with that?   I also added the zest from the whole large orange.  These look very nice.  I did extend the bottom crust up the side of the pan a tad -maybe half inch- just so the mince wouldn't stick to the pan when taking them out.  This worked like a charm.   I did not add the frosting, as mince is very sweet as is.  Make sure they are fully cooled before cutting.  Thank you for this nice recipe!  so easy.

This is a great recipe. I used orange cranberry chutney as the filling.  Delicious!
