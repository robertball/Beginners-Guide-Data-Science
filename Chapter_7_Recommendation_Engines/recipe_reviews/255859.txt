WOW, I loved it!  I kept right with the recipe but baked the squash in the oven (400 for 35 min)  instead of the microwave.  Has more flavor and doesn't take the good nutrients out like the micro does.  Just called my mom and told her I'm making this dish for Thanksgiving instead of the normal yellow squash casserole, it was that good.

With the the exception of adding a full teaspoon of pepper (because I love pepper) I followed the recipe. Absolutely delicious, I don’t like bland food and this was anything but bland. I may play around with the recipe, but it’s delicious as is.

I thought this was pretty good and it's very quick to put together. I baked the mixture inside the shell instead of in a baking dish directly. I added some bread crumbs to the mixture to soak up any extra liquid this may have created. It makes a lovely presentation. Thank you for the recipe.
