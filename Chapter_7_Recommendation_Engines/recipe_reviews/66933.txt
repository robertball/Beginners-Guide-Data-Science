What a fun way to eat burgers! As soon as I saw this recipe, it reminded me of the *Bar Burgers* they serve at Dave and Busters. Except they use Hawaiian Rolls. So, for dinner tonight, we fixed Baby Burgers and they were EXTRA good! It all goes back to that saying we all know ~ *good things come in small packages*! Plus, these are super kid friendly! Thanks so much, Bridge, for bringing some fun to our Friday Night Dinner! :o)

i modified this for a lighter appetizer. I made the meat patties smaller (1 1/2 tsp). Too small to fry so baked them on a tray in a toaster oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. Before serving I spread mustard on the bread, added the meat and topped them off with a small square of cheese. Reheated the "burgers" until the cheese melted. Did not toast the bread previously, this made for a semi-toasted less dry bread.  As for slicing cherry tomatoes? Forget it. Optional, some grated onions.  Made 24 appetizers with about 10 oz. of meat. My guests at my last party loved these, they were tasty and not too filling for the dinner to follow.

My Variations
We didn't bake the baguette slices
We ran out of baguette, so we also used dinner rolls, cut in 4 & sliced in half
I used (my favorite) McCormick's Broiled Steak Seasoning Salt, instead of mesquite seasoning
I also added sliced, sauteed mushrooms onto my burgers

Notes
The dinner rolls turned out quite well, but were a little too bulky for my taste
The crust on the baguettes made them a little difficult to eat
Could've used full-sized tomatoes, instead of cherry tomatoes

These are good, but after making them a couple of times, we prefer them slightly different. First, I highly recommend you try these on soft Hawaiian sweet rolls. They are so good. Also, for a perfect game day treat, try this: Grill pineapple and fry bacon. Grill patties (I use the grill and make the patties the size of the bottom of a standard drinking glass - maybe a tad larger). Brush patties with bottled teriyaki sauce. Place patties on rolls with a small, thin slice of the grilled  pineapple, a small piece of bacon, and the cheese and/or condiments of your choice. This is our preferred way to eat them and my d/h and three kids agree. We'll be making them for the football games all winter!

I changed this slightly -- just used steak sauce and cheese on each burger instead of the lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard etc.

Cute idea for sliders. This made 10 burgers from 1 lb of ground beef. They weren't anything to rave over, just burgers though. I didn't know exactly what mesquite seasoning is, so I used a couple of splashes of Mesquite liquid smoke. Thanks Bridge, these were really fast and simple to put together in a hurry.

I'd like to try these on rolls next time. They were too tall to really eat! I'd also like to try the hawaiian version someone suggested. Still, for a basic appetizer, they were pretty good.

These baby burgers are perfect for a lot of guests!  I added blue cheese to one batch and had 1/2 plain and 1/2 blue burgers.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for my last cocktail party!  What more could a California girl living in France ask for!  I have never seen French people eat so fast, and with their fingers!  A huge crowd pleaser!

This recipe was wonderful.  I used hawaiian sweet rolls instead of the baguettes.  They were the hit of the dinner.  Thanks, Bridge.

I made these at home, and took it to a party.  Wasn't that great.  I know if I served them immediately they would have been a big hit.

rather than using Baguettes, I went with Pillsbury buttery home style grands biscuits.
