I love it.  I was searching for this recipe.  Sure glad I found it.  I'm originally from Cornwall, which is only a few miles from Lancaster.  Boy I sure miss the Perch Rolls. Mmmmmmmmm good!

WOW what a surprise.    I was a little leary becauce of the mixture of ingredients but what a surprise.   Even after substituting eggbeaters and margaring for the eggs and butter it was still great.   Might reduce the sugar by a couple of tablespoons next time.   I used it on Ahi Tuna and Halibut and got rave reviews.   Definitely a keeper.

I am so glad I found this recipe.  I'm a university student who lives 8 hours from Cornwall, where I grew up.  I was getting home sick and craving a perch roll.  You made my week!!!!!

This sauce had a nice flavor, but it never thickened for me.  I did everything per the recipe, and cooked the sauce for 30 minutes before I gave up on it ever getting thicker.  Maybe next time I will try adding more flour?

I live in Cornwall and my husband just called to say he had a mess of perch for dinner! Found this and made half the quantity (no water as per another review)and only 1/4 cup sugar. It came out perfect. Having had a Blue Anchor fish roll last week, I feel good about calling it 5 Stars. Could the water be for the bottom of the double boiler??

If you've ever had Lancaster Perch rolls, then this sauce won't disappoint.  My husband is a die hard fan of Lancaster perch rolls and he considers himself an expert on the taste of the sauce. He says it's "bang on! No doubt about it!"

This was alright.  I had to microwave the sauce to get it thick, and even added some cornstarch.  I've never had fish roll sauce before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was good to try something new.

This was a hit with myself and my kiddos.  I only hope I did it justice since I've heard about these fish rolls and have wanted to try them.   Now a trip was requested (by my munchkins) to try the original thing.   Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This would be a 5 star rating, but if you make it with the water listed in the recipe, it won't thicken. I made it twice. The first time it didn't thicken. After reading reviews, I tried again but  omitted the water:  it turned out perfect!

This sauce is amazing ! Made it with my family and it was a hit with everyone , only issue was it was not thinkening so I swapped the double boiler for a regular stovetop pot then added a simple roux (flour + butter) and it thickened no problem after that ! Next time I think I'll take the advice to skip the water ! I will definitely be making this again ????

This is a great sauce/dressing.  We have been using this recipe in our family for three generations in our tuna salad.  My only issue with this is the addition of water.  Leave it out it is not necessary and may be why some have problems with thickening. We first combine all ingredients except vinegar and simmer until thickened then add in the vinegar.
