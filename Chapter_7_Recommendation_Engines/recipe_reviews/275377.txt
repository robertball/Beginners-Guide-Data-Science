CAULIPOWER pizza crust is fantastic! Note this recipe says to put on two pizza crusts. I did use extra cheese and I absolutely tasted the fajita chicken flavor the recipe was going for. I felt the recipe needs a sauce. The avocado does make up for that some but it would be nice to turn the avocado into a guacamole sauce. This recipe gets five stars for the CAULIPOWER crust blowing my mind and the flavors topping the pizza being on point!

Easy to make. I had my husband try it and even he liked it. ( he’s a tombstone pizza guy).

Added jalapeños to the mix for extra spice. Will make for my book club friends now that I know it is good.

Melty, cheesy, tasty toppings that makes this a hearty, better-for-you pizza. And it's gluten free! CAULIPOWER did a great job with their line of crusts and I can't wait to try them all! I could not find the undressed crusts by me so I used a Margherita crust! I used red onions instead of white and added red peppers because I had them. Tastes like fabulous chicken fajitas on top of a crispy, tasty crust! Will be making again! Oh we omitted the avocado because it looked bad when I cut it open.

I could not tell that this crust was made out of cauliflower. Absolutely love the fact that it is healthier for you. I have been trying to do away with a lot of carbs so this worked out perfect. I think I will be using this all the time now to make pizza. Recipe was also great. The only thing I did different was I added some fresh mushrooms that I had on hand.

This one was definitely a keeper for our family and one we will try again in the near future. It was easy to make for dinner after work. Everyone (even our picky toddler) loved it! And it’s one of the few gluten-free recipes I’ve tried that didn’t sacrifice taste for the lack of gluten. Thanks, CAULIPOWER!

I was pleasantly surprised with the delicious flavor and the crispness of the CAULIPOWER crust. Chicken fajita pizza is outstanding.

The crust is great, cooks even.  These pizzas are easy to make them your own!  Add things you love and don’t add things you may not like or can’t eat!

We enjoyed this hearty pizza on the CAULIPOWER crust. I felt less guilt because the crust is better for you than traditional crust. The chicken fajita topping was great. I sliced the tomatoes and put them in the oven to roast a bit for additional flavor.  I will make this again.

Great idea for this delicious-tasting pizza!   For me, there was way too much topping.  Next time, I will decrease the ingredients to half of what's called for.
I followed the recipe to the letter . The balance of flavors were on point.  You can taste the different spices which play nicely together.
The CAULIPOWER pizza crust is crispy and yummy.   The choice of the pepper jack cheese was perfect and was melty with just enough of a kick to keep it interesting.
I was so looking forward to the avocado but when I sliced it open, it was unusable   Definitely will try that again in the future.
All in all, this better-for-you pizza is  going into my recipe box and will be making an appearance on our table again soon.
