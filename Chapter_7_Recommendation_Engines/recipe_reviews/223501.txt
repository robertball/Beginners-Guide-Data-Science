The only thing wrong with it was there wasn't enough, it was all gone, everyone wanted two servings.

I thought it was good, my kids ate it, but my husband said it was alright,  he thought the BBQ sauce made it sweet.  I will definitely try it again.  I will use a different BBQ sauce next time.  Nice for a change from the regular old meatloaf.

It was very easy to make and my family loved it.  There were no leftovers.  I didn't even need to make any changes to the recipe. It was perfect as is.

Pretty tasty but missing something.  I added some browned onions and used real bacon and sliced american cheese but this recipe still seems to be lacking something I can't put my finger on...  VERY greasy but it was good.  The kids and my husband ate it but no one asked for seconds.  May make it again.

I have always made my standard meatloaf with barbecue sauce vs. ketchup... no complains there... my issue with this one is the cheese choice and the lack of onions... First, onions HELP flavor the meat! Sure there are spices/sauces in there, but there is something about an onion. Also, I much preferred provolone stuffed meatloaf, the processed cheese pleases the little ones, but the adults A: prefer the provolone, and B: it is much more pleasing to the eye.

Sorry but we didn't like this meatloaf at all.  Followed the recipe exactly except for changing it to 4 servings.  Will go back to our old standard meatloaf next time.

My whole family loves this recipe! I don't really like all the ketchup that is usually put in meatloaf so this was a great alternative. I made a couple changes. I added caramelized onions and it gave it a really good flavor. I also, instead of doing the cheese in the middle, I just mixed in shredded cheese. This really is a great dish!!

I modified this recipe and made it a bacon cheeseburger meatloaf.  I added bacon (precooked and crispy) to the middle layer and also on top.  In the middle layer I added diced sandwich pickles and diced shallots and used a1/2 can of chopped tomatoes and lined the bottom of the pan with tomato sauce added. Topped it off with cheese bacon and tomato sauce.  I did not use ketchup as the sugars in ketchup tend to over cook and burn.  And this also makes for the best left over meatloaf sandwich ever.  Careful with the amount of tomato sauce so it doesn't get mushy and wet.  Just enough to coat the bottom of the pan and the top.  Also I always use 93% lean chopped beef to keep the grease to a bare minimum.

This was different and different is good sometimes when it comes to meatloaf.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add some onion and maybe cut the cheese in half.  I never thought I would ever cut down cheese in a recipe but it was a little much.

Loved this! Not big on meatloaf but this really tasted like the burger without the bun! Will be making this again and again!! ?? Made small changes but followed recipe exact except using one loaf pan, I used 2 smaller dishes and some minor taste enhancers.

I do not like meatloaf but this recipe was really delicious. The barbecue taste was throughout  and the meat was moist and full of flavor.

So this was a fluke I found this on a Sunday a few months ago.  I was looking for something different and WOW.  My kids and husband tear this up and ask me to make it once a week.  If you are looking for a spin on a traditional dinner this is it.  Make sure you do not use cheap processed cheese.  Also too much cheese can be a bad thing.  It is great with cheesey garlic mashed potatoes or homemade mac and cheese.  Thanks so much for sharing this one.  It makes a great leftover sandwhich as well (like a patty melt). Make more then you usually need cause they will have seconds!
