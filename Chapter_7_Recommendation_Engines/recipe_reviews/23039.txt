Great Ahi recipe. Taste just the way Mom use to make. I too, seared on a pan rather than the grill. Wonderful dish, will definitely make again.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.  LOVE THIS.  Was able to grill tuna to perfection - boiled the marinade down and put a small amount on top before serving and it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Oh My Gosh!!  What an outstanding recipe for tuna.  I use Trader Joe's Veri Teriyaki sauce and marinate the ahi tuna for one hour in the refrigerator.  Cook until medium rare inside, and top with homemade wasabi butter -- absolutely delicious!

This is a great recipe!  Also - regarding the nutritional information (so many reviewers were overly concerned about fat and sodium) - you don't drink the marinade!

This was so delicious and very easy to make. I used Lawry's teriyaki marinade, doubled the garlic, and added a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. My husband grilled the steaks for 2 minutes on one side, and 1 and a half minute on the other to produce the perfect medium rare. I boiled down the remaining marinade to pour over each steak and paired this with "Stuffed Peppers My Way" for a gourmet meal that pleased all eight of my dinner guests.

This is a tricky one to review. I was disappointed with the actual marinade. I let it sit in the sauce over night, and was surprised at the lack of flavor. However, the tuna steaks themselves were the best we've ever eaten, so the meal was far from being a disaster! (By the way, the comment regarding over 40g of fat in this recipe - it's not as if you drink the marinade. It quite clearly says 'The nutrition data for this recipe includes information for the full amount of the marinade ingredients')

Pretty good, followed others advice and marinated for 4 hours, depends on thickness.  For 1" steaks, 2 hours should do.

This went over big with my family.  We had nice, thick, fresh tuna steaks and I really didn't want to use a bottled sauce but we were on vacation and I didn't have the right ingredients to make a fresh teriyaki sauce so bottled had to do.  At the kids request we made extra sauce and served it over rice.  Our oldest liked this very well and he is not much of a fish eater.  Fresh tuna was another new fish we tried and will definitely be something we make again - just without a bottled sauce.

Perhaps I didn't marinate as long as needed but the flavor wasn't there on this and I was disappointed. Also my husband overcooked the ahi tuna -- do not overcook.

This was truly wonderful- I dislike fish and there was no fish taste at all to it, more like reg meat. One thing I will do next time is not cook it as long.

This was the most easiest and most deliciously tender tuna I have ever made or tasted!  My family just loved it!  The first time I made it they immediately asked when I was going to make it again.  We cooked it on the Foreman Grill for 3 minutes and it was the best!  Added a little red chili pepper flakes for a little spice and it was soooo good!

I left the Tuna steaks in the marinade mixture overnight and found the meat to be extremely salty tasting.  I followed all other directions to the letter.  My family did not enjoy this preparation at all.

This recipe was great. Even my husband, who generally doesn't like Teriyaki liked this one. I boiled down the marinade, as another review suggested, and poured it over the salmon and rice. Will cook again and again.
PS- I used SoyVay Veri Teriyaki sauce for the marinade.

Turned out great! It sounded like an enormous amount of marinade, so I only used 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce and 1/4 cup olive oil, and it was still more than enough to marinate four 6-oz tuna steaks.

Sounds delicious, but at over 40 g of fat per serving, I will take everyone's word for it. I would have to be out of my mind to try this...there are ways to eat tuna that are much healthier!

We cooked this on the gas grill (used thick Teriyaki sauce) and it was perfect! The leftovers were warmed up and used on top of a Caesar salad the next day. I'm craving it all again!

This was really good.  I added some minced ginger to the sauce which as really good.  Next time I'll use a better quality teriyaki sauce; I used Kikkoman which was too salty.

I have been going thru my recipe box and realized I never rated this. I made this at least once a week back in the summer time. It is alsome on top of a salad or on the side with couscous. I will be making this again and again. You only need to cook tuna for 3 min. on each side on very hot grill. yum yum!!! Too bad tuna has gotten so expensive.

I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I used Lawry's Hawaiian marinade mixed with soy sauce, I used a splash of olive oil, and I added the cayenne pepper, and fresh ginger & marinated for around 1 hour.  I served it over mixed greens for a light healthy supper. The tuna was so moist & tender - I will definately be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My wife and I are still eating this (as I type).  It is wonderful.  We never thought tuna could taste this good.  I did make a minor change to the recipe, however.  Not so much a change to the recipe as a change to the marinade.  I put the marinade in a vacuum canister for my Food Saver.  Sucked the air out and put it in the 'fridge for 30 minutes.  Then I took the meat out (swapped the top and bottom pieces) and repeated the process.  Oh, I also put a piece of soaked hickory on the grill for a smoky flavor.  Well, gotta go and finish eating my dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe idea!

Tuna and teriyaki is a delicious combination.  I have also tried teriyaki and lime combination for the marinade, and I would highly recommend that as well.  Thanks for the great idea!

This recipe was so good. We used it on Opah (Moon Fish) we had never had it before, I would recommend using just a bit less oil (we used olive oil). Thanks for this recipe.

We really enjoyed this. We marinated for 8 hours and cooked for a total of 4 minutes on the George Foreman grill. I think next time I would do it for 3 minutes though because we like ours a little more rare.

Excellent recipe. I cooked the tuna in my electric grill at home and it came out wonderful. I added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic for extra taste.

This is a great recipe. I tried it once with tuna and it was very good, but when I did the same thing with salmon it was awesome. I also added some honey. Very enjoyable and healthy.

This recipe is so simple, yet so yummy! My husband isn't a tuna fan, so I make his with tilapia, but I find the tuna perfect. So, it's a versatile fish marinade.

Made this for dinner tonight after my husband brought home a yellowfin tuna from his fishing trip.... Marinated it for 30 mins, and threw it on the grill for 8 mins each side.  ( I like mine well done.)  It was easy and delicious!  We both loved it!  Thank you!

Made this recipe with red fin tuna and it was so delicious.  Served it with some garlic sauteed green beans and it was a huge hit!  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Very tasty.  I served this to 3 and got one "fantastic" and 2 "very good". The fish was moist and flavorful.  It is important to not over cook tuna. Serve pink in middle.

This recipe was AMAZING! I took the comment from another user about reducing the marinade down and putting it on top of the tuna. I served it with a baby green salad, brown rice, and I put the sauce on the rice and tuna. I will definately put this one in my permanent file!

I thought this was good, not terribly exciting - my husband liked it though (he is a huge teriyaki fan).  DO NOT OVERCOOK!  It makes a huge difference.  I would be willing to try this again and try cooking it for a shorter time.

The marinade was very good.  I also made extra and used it to marinate boneless chicken breasts.  Instead of grilling the tuna, I cooked it in a skillet on the stove top.  I served it with rice pilaf and Pan-Fried Asparagus.  We also drank pineapple wine from Maui.  It was a great meal to remind my husband and I of our trips to Maui.

This is one of the very best grilled fish recipes I've made...I couldn't believe how good it tasted.  It is super easy to make and will certainly impress everyone who tries it. Guests will want the recipe, and family will think you've fuss over them for hours.

This was delicious and I will definitely make again.  However, I need to get much better wtih my fish grilling skills.  I went by the instructions listed and dried out the tuna horribly.  Next time I probably won't have the grill on high and won't cook it for so long, but that is no fault of the recipe.  Every grill is different and I'd never tried grilling tuna on mine.  Know your grill!

We were fortunate enough to catch a nice Ahi recently. I had a bit more than a pound to cook up, so I doubled the sauce, except kept the recommended measure of olive oil. I marinated the fish for 4 hours or so, flipping the bag once in a while.

The fish came out MARVELLOUS! Often when I marinate something, I'm unsatisfied with the flavor infusion. But this fish definitely was very flavorful; so much in fact I did not add any sauce after the fish came off the grill. 2 people eating fish that night said that was the best ahi they had ever eaten. I, too, agree.

Thank you very much for the wonderful recipe.

My husband and I LOVED this marinade it is so delicious!!  We tend to serve it with brown rice and some sort of a steamed vegetable.  It makes for a very healthy and VERY flavorful meal.  We also like to sprinkle toasted sesame seeds on top of the tuna steak once it is done for a finishing touch.

So quick, easy and delicious.  I usually marinate it in the early afternoon and then grill in a frying pan later for dinner.  I always add sesame seeds to the marinade too, I feel it adds a bit of Asian influence to it.

This was very good and easy!  I did marinate for longer - close to two hours.  Next time, I might try to make more marinade and keep aside to boil down for a topping as someone else suggested - not that it wasn't good bare, but I think that would be yummy too.  Thanks so much!

Just tried this recipe to the letter and Loved it!  My husband was leary about cooking it for only 3 or 4 total minutes so we tried one fillet for 6-8 minutes total and the other for 4 minutes total.  Both were great, but the one on the grill for only 4 minutes was better.  So good we are making it for my in-laws birthdays in a couple of weeks.

Bought a fresh tuna the other day and was wondering how to cook.  This recipe is easy to follow and superb in taste.  My sons like it.  I will cook like it more often.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, just made a little less of it.  I put the marinade and tuna steaks in a zip bag, and let them sit in the fridge for 45 minutes, turning them every 10.  Some of the best tuna I have ever had!

I marinated this for only 30 minutes, maybe less and found it to be salty for my taste. To be fair, I hardly use salt at all. Hubby gave it 5 stars. I squeezed a little fresh lime to balance the salt.

Yummy yummy yummy! The teriyaki was such a great compliment to the tuna. I recommend sushi grade tuna so you can please all in your group. I made a dipping sauce for each steak of teriyaki and saoy sauce with some ground ginger that was a hit as a compliment.

I marinated my Ahi tuna for a few hours in my own teriyaki sauce with extra ginger root. Then I seared tuna in a cast iron pan for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. I wasn't disappointed with the taste of the tuna steaks and teriyaki marination. I served with some white rice that was white peppered and topped with oyster sauce.

This marinade is really delicious. I think any brand teriyaki is fine. I've made twice, the first time I marinated for an hour and the second time for a 30 min. The one that marinated for an hour had so much more flavor. I got tons of compliments from my guest. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! Simple, quick, tastes great, impressive! We cooked it over a charcoal grill and followed the recipe exactly. We also put the marinade in a small cast iron pan and heated it on the grill as well to keep the fish moist, and as a topping when served. Be careful to stir it continually so it doesn't burn. Also be cautious not to allow the marinate spill and catch on fire in the grill due to the olive oil.

Tasty stuff! I like to add 2 Tbs of honey to mine. Easy to overcook tho, 5 mins a side on med-hi grill or 3 mins a side on a med-hot pan does the trick for me.

Fantastic dish! My husband, who is a little picky, absolutely loved it. I grilled it on a fish rack for the grill instead of directly on the grates. Turned  out perfectly.

This may be my new teriyaki marinade for all meats.  I used lower sodium teriyaki sauce and added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger (I only made 2 servings).  I let the tuna marinade for about 2 1/2 hours.  Afterwords, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and reduced the remaining marinade and served it over the tuna.

I liked it, but the teriyaki taste didn't turn out too noticeably. Next time I'll marinate the fish longer. Thanks for sharing this recipe!
