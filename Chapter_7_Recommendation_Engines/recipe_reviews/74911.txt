This recipe is good, but it needs an egg to bind it and a half-teaspoon or so of salt. Adding the salt will cure the "bland" flavor other reviewers have complained of. 

I also added chocolate chips.

This is my new favorite bar recipe.  I used whole wheat flour, raisins instead of walnuts and doubled the applesauce (unsweetened).  So yummy!

Pan size too small??  Are we making the same recipe?  The first time I made this recipe I followed it to the "t" and it worked out great.  I think the butter has to be creamed thoroughly or you might run into problems with the dry ingredients.  The kids really enjoyed it so I made it again and this time, I stirred in raisins and chocolate chips.  Even better!  A great after school snack.  Very much like a gronola bar so I cut the bars bigger.  I think this is going to be a great recipe to add different ingredients and experiment with the flavors.

We weren't impressed with the Apple Oatmeal cookie
bars. Not enough flavor and the pan size is too small. Maybe with chopped apples it would be better!

These were ok. Kinda bland and I actually added some cinnamon sugar on top.  I did make this without the nuts. I am looking for something similar to those new 'Oatmeal-to-go' bars, so this didn't really fit the bill for that.

Sorry, but these just absolutely did not work.  I don't usually read reviews before making something, unless the average score is low and I want to find out why.  But I printed this off a long, long time ago and didn't even know until I got into the middle of it that there was a problem.   What I got of this was just a very dry "bowl of crumbles" as someone put it.  I see people referring to them as being like a granola bar.  Perhaps this is how granola bars would be made and if I judged it based on that, I might feel differently.  However, there's two issues with that.  One is that they are called bar cookies, not granola bars.  I wasn't looking to make granola bars.  Two is that I first noticed a problem when it said to add the vanilla.  I looked in the bowl at what was a lot of dry stuff, and realized there was no way I could add vanilla to that, which is when I realized that something just seemed wrong, and came and checked the reviews.  OK, great.  With the advice of some other people, I added more applesauce to get some moisture and an egg to help bind it.  It at least did stick together instead of crumbling, but were still kinda dry and just not much flavor.  They were edible and I did eat some.  (Maybe I should dump the pic since that isn't really the way the recipe is.)

I added an egg and increased the applesauce to 1 c simply to bind the ingredients together.  Without this change, I would be baking a pan full of crumbles.

Excellent recipe! The only thing is, I recommend increasing the amount of applesauce, to roughly twice as much.

Thanks for the add an egg tip! I used apple cinnamon oatmeal, and cinnamon flavored applesauce instead (omitted the cinnamon).  Then drizzled with caramel syrup while still warm.  Would go great with ice cream while still warm!

I read that it was dry so I doubled the applesause and I added peanut butter and it was stuff extremely dry and floury. I might try it again, because I liked the flavor, but maybe with less oatmeal and a bit less flour? I don't know.

We loved this with ice cream. We ate the cookie bar warm and plopped a little vanilla ice cream on top and my husband LOVED it. He came home from work the next day hoping there was more to have again!

Needs something besides the applesauce to bind it. Tasted very floury. I had to mix with my hands to get it all to stick together. UPDATE - Hubbie told me to upgrade my recipe. He loved them. I snuck them in his lunch bag. He likes the sheetrock type of granola bars & really liked these. I like the chewy ones.

I also found I had to add quite a bit more apple sauce to make the mixture manageable, and my family found the final product a little dry and boring.  I tried again, and added 2-3 TBSP honey, which made it a bit better.  Still, I don't think I'll be making this again.

This turned out great the first time and everyone loves them!  I made two pans and froze them for fast school snacks.  This is even good warmed up with ice cream on top.  I did add about another 1/4-1/2 cup applesauce (I used unsweetened), chocolate chips and raisins.

I read the reviews and made a few major tweaks myself.  First of all I doubled the recipe, subbed pecans for the walnuts, added some whole flax seed (about 1/2c) and toasted all of them first in the oven for about 15 min.  I swapped the amounts for the applesauce and butter, and actually used vegetable oil. I used half the amount of flour, but used whole wheat, and added one egg and a tsp of salt.  Because of the reviews, I tasted the batter before baking to test for blandness and it was fine - I used the full amount of brown sugar and added a pinch of ground cloves for spice.  I put in two of the small boxes of raisins that I had in my cabinet.  I spread it in a jelly roll pan and baked for 25 minutes, and they are perfectly seasoned and chewy like those big Quaker breakfast cookies.  Maybe next time I'll play with other sweeteners (honey, maple syrup) to make more clean/whole food.

Used whlole wheat flour and doubled the applesauce. Added heaping 1/2 c dried chopped apples. Pretty good! Like the idea of an egg to bind it but it's not necessary.

Just made this for the first time. I substituted wheat flour, doubled up the applesauce, used 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds, added 1 egg, and 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. I was looking for a "granola bar" recipe when I came across this one. This recipe is fantastic. It is great and so easy to make simple additions and changes to according to an individuals taste buds. Thanks for the recipe. Next time I'm leaving out the chocolate and adding protein powder.

I used shorting instead of butter and can fruit  blended in my bullet to blend. I also increase the amount to 3/4 cups to make it really moist. I will surely make this often. The grandchildren loved it!

The recipe is good but needed a bit of tweaking to make it even better.  We double the applesauce, added extra cinnamon and added raisins.  These additions make a way better bar!!

I changed them up by using apple pie filling(1 cup), applesauce (1/4 cup), 2 medium eggs & 1 more teaspoon of cinnamon. It turned out great to go with my morning coffee.

I liked this recipe.  It was a nice flavor and it's very adaptable.  I didn't have quite enough apple sauce. I only had about a half eaten lunch portion container of apple sauce so I used that and diced up an apple.  I was out of vanilla so I used almond extract in place of the vanilla.  It did look a little dry so I tossed in a beaten egg and a tsp of lemon.  The kids loved the result.  I cut it up into bars and wrapped them individually for lunches and snacks for the upcoming days.  Although crumbly it has just the right amount of sweetness but still a healthy feel to it.  Next time I'm going to try adding cranberrys and orange juice as well to it.  The possibilities are endless.

There's got to be something missing from this recipe.  I made this, and it's too dry, too hard.  It's harder than a granola bar.  I felt something was missing with the batter, and I even added more applesauce to it.  Sorry, but this recipe doesn't cut it.  There must be something wrong with the recipe, something missing or the amounts are wrong.  Baking time should only be 20 minutes too with what I got from this.  Will never make these again.

Turned out very delicious; however, while in the process of cutting the bars into squares/rectangles, the granola texture crumbled. And even though I greased the baking sheet, the granola also stuck to the sheet one the cooling process was complete. I recommend following the recipe for the quaker oats oatmeal cookies and add eggs so the oats have a binder and substitute the raisens for applesauce (plain). Also only use metal baking pans for I think that was my mistake in getting them stuck ...

Flavor was good, but it was VERY dry. Needs some other type of liquid and maybe an egg.

They taste pretty healthy, but need something to moisten them up.  Like another reviewer, I added chocolate chips, and I'm sure it was an improvement.

This recipe was good.  My daughter loved them and she is hard to please.  I did have to add a little more applesauce because of the excess of flour.  I also added peanut butter chips!

We liked the recipe.  Not too sweet not too bland.  Basically a granola bar.  I agree with one reviwer, it would be great with ice sream.  Both of my kids (ages 5 & 3) liked it.  I did add a bit more applesauce (maybe another Tblsp or 2) to make it easier to mix.  I also added wheat germ (2 Tblsp) but I add that to almost everything I bake!

I agree this recipe needs something.  I added an egg, chopped apples, some more cinnamon and some salt. It was okay as a snack.  I made a glaze and drizzled it over the squares to serve it as a sweet. Also the consistency was very thick.  I could not beat in the flour, oatmeal, vanilla and cinnamon. The applesauce and walnuts I had to work in with my hands.  Were all the ingredients included?

I added an egg, plus used 1/4 C apple butter in addition to the 1/4 C applesauce (mine was homemade).  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white. The bars were a healthier alternative to some pure junk stuff - which I love :-)  The smell of them baking was great and the taste was very good.

I made it, but substituted raisins for walnuts. This simple recipe was really good warm out of the oven. I gave it 4-stars as next day it was a little dry. I warmed up a piece in microwave and that helped. Overall, it's a healthier snack that I would rather eat instead of candy.

Made this last night, made changes because of the other reviews, added a fourth a cup of white sugar,added an egg. Halved the amount flour, added a tbsp on honey, and more cinnamon... came out good, but it took a lot of changes before I liked it enough to bake it... would probably make (my version of the) recipe again

Made this recipe exactly as directed. It was difficult to remove from the pan. It crumbled too much. And the directions are missing an understanding of when to remove it from the oven, or how cool it should be when removing from the pan. Those directions might have solved the first two problems, but we won't find out because we won't make this again.

I will definitely make this again!  My substitutions:
1. whole wheat flour for regular flour
2. 1/4 ground flax seed meal
3. 1/2 -3/4 cup cane sugar
4. 1/2 tsp salt 
5. mix of dried craisins and raisins
I baked it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for the same time and it came out great!

Not the worst recipe but not the best.  I added 3/4 cups of applesauce with cinnamon and 1/4 cup of apple juice to moisten it up a bit.  I also did not use a 9 x 13 in pan.  I used a small oval ceramic dish.  I am not sure on the measurements but it made them more into cookie bars using this dish instead of the 9 x 13 in dish.  I also added cinnamon chips to the top before baking and caramel sauce after baking which gave it more flavor.  The actual bar itself is still pretty bland.  I think I will use this as a base recipe and keep trying different things to see if I can make more improvements to it.

Added another 1/4 of applesauce because it was so crumbly. Agree with many of the other comments--it turned out very bland and could benefit from some salt or some other flavoring (banana? Peanut butter?) to give it some interest. I ended up crumbling the bars and mixing the crumbs with Greek yogurt, strawberries, and blueberries. They were too thick/bland to eat on their own.

Just okay.  It seemed really dry to me so as others recommended, I increased the applesauce to 1 cup, maybe a little more and added an egg. I also did not have walnuts, so used pecans instead.  Looks the same now as it did when I put it in the oven.  I will not make these again.  There are much better cookie bar recipes.

I made these with a few changes from the original recipe. First, I took other reviewers' advice and added a large egg and 1/2 t salt. I also used about 3/4 cup homemade, canned (slightly chunky) cinnamon apple sauce, added a couple small boxes of raisins, and split my teaspoon of vanilla with maple flavoring. (This was a happy accident. I ran out of vanilla at the 1/2 t mark.) The chunks of apple, walnuts, and raisins give great texture and flavor, and the maple was a bonus. Not bland at all! In a 9x13 the bars aren't super thick, but they're pretty tasty!

This turned out to be a big pan of blah dry crumbles. We will freeze it and use it sparingly (with extra spices added) as a topping for yogurt and fruit parfaits.

I made these, with some alterations based on previous reviews.  I added one egg, increased the applesauce to 1/2 cup, and added two small grated apples.  I replaced the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice (personal preference) and a sprinkle of nutmeg. They were very good and moist, something I always worry about with oatmeal in baked goods.

Got this recipe from my bff.  Never tried the original version.  I make it with the addition of one small chopped apple (aprx 1 cup) and 1 med smashed bananna. We also use the 4 oz cups of applesauce. You can also add shredded coconut, Mini chocolate chips, craisins, raisins, etc. Love them!

I added 2 eggs, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.  Also used a 4oz container of applesauce instead of 1/4 cup. Then stirred in 1 cup each of peacans, butterscotch chips, and chocolate chips.  These turned out really good.

I wish I had read the reviews before I tried this recipe.  It needed more applesauce I believe to hold it all together.  It smelled wonderful as it was baking, but was very dry and brittle and I could not serve to my friends.

These were very hard and dry. Even with the modifications that other reviewers suggested they were difficult to eat.

Perfect recipe as a lunch box snack. I added sultanas and finely chopped the nuts rather than just chopping so it was safe for children to eat. I'd never used apple sauce before and had an interesting time comparing the ingredients of the 3 available brands in the supermarket (only the IXL contained 99% apples). Great to learn how to use a new, handy ingredient.

Not a bad recipe.  I used home made applesauce and I think it worked better.  Delicious with ice cream.  Not sure why the others said the pan size was too small, I found that the batter fit perfectly.

I thought it would be a flop--but my husband and son loved this. They said it was like granola.
