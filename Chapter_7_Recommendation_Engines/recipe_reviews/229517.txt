I live in Spain so some of these ingredients were hard to come by. I dressed this recipe up a little by subbing a mild Emmenthal for the American cheese, french bread cubes (with crust) for the wonder bread, and a tablespoon of dijon mustard for the dry mustard. We did indeed have the casserole for Christmas morning, and really enjoyed it!

Very good! I think the ground mustard gives it an extra good flavor!

Simple recipe with loads of flavor.  I took it to a brunch and everyone complimented me on it.  Even people who said they normally don't like egg casseroles.  I used sharp cheddar cheese as that is all I had, cubed ham instead of diced and cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was really watery on the bottom after baking.  I will make again but will probably add another egg or two.

This was quite good!  Much easier than my previous breakfast casserole.  I used Sara Lee Texas Toast and a couple of extra eggs.  I also used shredded chedder instead of American cheese.  I only had lunch cut Black Forest Ham which I cut up and still, this was a winner!!!

Recipe Group Selection for 11/8/2014 –I appreciated the simplicity of this recipe and how easy it is to adjust to your personal tastes.  I substituted Johnsonville sweet sausage that I had browned instead of the ham, and topped with a mixture of different cheeses I needed to use up.  I didn’t bother to remove the crusts.  It was filling and delicious - pure comfort food.  This is a keeper.

As others said.  This is a great basic recipe that can be altered to taste.  I made it in muffin pans and cooked for about 35 minutes.  That made it easy to serve and portion.  Next time I will add green chilies for a little more flavor.  Also, I used shredded cheddar cheese and had not liquid at the bottom.  Yum!

Recipe Group: Solid breakfast recipe. I enjoyed it very much. The only change I made was to add a little bit of freshly ground white pepper. I did find it a bit salty, but that may be because we are not accustomed to eating American cheese. There was a little water at the bottom of the pan but not enough to concern me. I did only refrigerate for an hour before baking. Looking forward to leftovers for breakfast tomorrow :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, Karen!

Recipe Group Selection:  08, November 2014 ~ A very good basic breakfast casserole dish.  I only had 6 slices of bread, so I did not cut the crust off the 6 pieces I had, to make up for the seventh piece. I used 1 cup of milk and 2 cups of Half and Half for the liquid.  This baked up nicely and set up perfectly.  I did let is rest for about 8 minutes before cutting.  This was served with fresh fruit and 'Banana Plum Bread' from AR.

The problem is you don't need 3 cups of milk - 2 is always what I use in all my egg casseroles - that's why this one's soggy

Delicious! I make this for a work party brunch, everyone asked for the recipe. I used ground sausage instead of links (Jimmy Deans Country Style), and baked closer to 80 minutes since I used a smaller, deeper casserole dish. Perfect.

This was a quick way to make Christmas breakfast.  BUT my guys didn't like  it!! It was a texture thing.  I thought the flavor was good. I used 6 slices of wheat bread with the crusts on, jack cheese and turkey sausage for the ham. You can't beat  the ease in the morning. Can't say I will make it again because of my picky kids but if you are looking for an easy tasty breakfast casserole this is a great choice.

I had a ton of cheese left over that I was afraid to use because it was going to be all cheese and very little egg.  I cut the cheese in half and doubled the egg.  The point was to have an "egg" casserole.  This is a good recipe and it's easy to modify it to your own preference.. and that's what I did.

I make this every Christmas but I put 3 cups of crushed corn flakes mixed with 4 tablespoons melted butter on top before cooking for 40 minutes at 375. I make the whole thing the night before and just add the corn flakes and bake on Christmas morning

Excellent----we used Jimmy Dean's hot sausage instead of ham, and being in Texas where everything is spicy (supposedly), we serve salsa with it.  Have served this for years, and now my kids serve it also.  My son just brought us some for tomorrow a.m.

Hearty and delicious!  I used one extra egg and simply layered a package of thinly sliced sandwich ham on the bottom.  I also used a teaspoon of spicy brown mustard since I didn't have any dry mustard on hand.  The bread was the Texas thick sliced white with the crust removed.  I left the aluminum foil cover in place for the first 50 min  and them removed it for the last 10.  I did experience some of the liquid at the bottom that other cooks did, but it was minimal and easily drained with a small spoon.  This one will be going into my favorites for another lazy weekend :-)

Very good!  I took this to a potluck brunch, everyone complimented the recipe and asked where they could find it.  I used Colby Jack cheese instead of american cheese.  Very mild flavor.  Very Nice.

We make it with Jiffy Cornbread as the bottom layer, then eggs/ham/cheese on top. It only takes about 40 minutes to bake, and it's extraordinary.

This was probably the best breakfast casserole I have ever made.  I did make some changes.  I did not include the mustard, but might next time.  I used bacon and a little bit of Jimmy Dean Sausage on the bottom layer (I didn't have ham), then hashbrowns (homemade with 3 small potatoes), then 1/2 the cheese, then more bacon, then the bread (which I cut to 3 slides of 7-grain bread because of the potatoes), then the rest of the cheese.  It was outstanding!

I have made this for at least 3 years now and am planning on making it again this year.  Super easy, make the night before then pull it out of the fridge and pop in the oven while we're opening presents and then have a yummy breakfast-perfect!
I do use shredded Mild Cheddar cheese and upped the eggs to 8-otherwise I follow the recipe.  Sorry I haven't reviewed before now.

I had some frozen hamburger buns to use up so I used them instead of bread. Loved it! I also added green peppers and fresh spinach to get some veggies in.

So, my mother made this every year for our family on Christmas morning except instead of using ham, we would put strips of bacon on top. I have not gone one year without eating this for Christmas breakfast.  The ham was also delicious!

This recipe was a HIT with the family! The recipe provided here was the perfect base for me to adapt with touches of my own. I used crumbled sausage instead of ham, I used day-old cubed baguette bread instead of sliced white bread, and I added cheddar cubes with the American cheese. I used a square glass pan and baked it at 325 for just under 2 hours to make sure it cooked through (since it would be thicker than described in the recipe). This recipe was delicious inspiration for a casserole that everybody loved. Thank you!

Great recipe, easy to make and delicious! I am gluten and dairy free so I modified it using almond milk, gluten free bread and almond milk cheddar style cheese and it was wonderful! I only had 4 slices of bread on hand so I also added a cup of thawed frozen shredded potatoes. Will definitely make again.

First attempt. Followed to a T and it was way too watery. Second attempt. Used 2 cups milk and 8 eggs. A lot less watery 
Needs a bit more time than the 60 minutes. Next time may use half milk and 8 eggs. Everyone liked it

Been making this recipe since the  mid 1970's, Occasionally I would add an extra egg, depending on egg size.  Kids loved it...and first kid up turned the oven on to preheat. it so they didn't have to wait too long for breakfast.

We've made this recipe for years. It is the best. Works well with bacon, too. Remember, if you purchase diced ham you must remove the water from the ham.  We microwave the ham between several paper towels.

The step of buttering the slices of bread and then cubing them was very time consuming because the butter just stuck to the knife. My guests really liked the creaminess of the casserole.

Tasty but runny. I cooked it 10 minutes longer than suggested but it was too wet. Not the preferred dish at the brunch.  But very tasty. Reheated it next day on stovetop to release the water. Was better but then just one more scrambled egg dish.

Perhaps it was the juices from the ham I used, but there was quite a bit of liquid in the bottom of the casserole which made the casserole to soggy to eat.

Fantastic- I ran out of milk and only did 1 cup and so it was very dense but still delicious.  I also used hashbrowns as a base as well as the bread and my husband loved it. I didn't have mustard powder and so substituted grey poupon which I wouldn't recommend but it worked in a pinch.

Perfect for both Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. Light, for those holidays with bigger meals later in the day, but filling enough were people won’t be picking at all your food while you are cooking later. Delicious with white sharp cheddar cheese and a little pepper. My family loves this!

As simple as the ingredients are, they blend together in an irresistible way...tasting even better a day or two later. I was tempted to make changes while assembling this for the first time, but decided to try the recipe on its own merits. I won't change a thing. Delicious as is!  Super yum! xox

Made this exactly as described except I left the crusts on,  and it was a huge hit. I've never used American cheese in a casserole before, but I'm glad I did. I've made it again for today, Christmas morning. Thank you for the recipe!

This is the brunch casserole my Gram made every Christmas.We lost her three years ago and seeing this recipe brings me right back to the good aromas and joy of being with her in the kitchen.Thank you for the wonderful reminder! The only changes she made was using shredded mild cheddar,an extra slice of bread,and greasing the pan with butter instead of cooking spray. Both are delicious though!

...used this as a basic recipe to use up some leftover potatoes, ham, and grilled onions - Sauteed these together to reheat, added chopped spinach, jalapeno, garlic salt, black pepper,  then eggs and finally folded in some Italian blend shredded cheese as it started to set up. Served in bowl with topping of  more of the shredded cheese. Only took about 10 minutes to cook instead of an hour. Yummy!

This was a big thumbs down at our home. I think it called for too much liquid. It cooked at 350 degrees for 1hr (I have an oven temperature gage & it read 350 when I put it in). It looked beautiful & golden brown when I took it out. But, the bread was soggy, it wasn't slimy (thank goodness) so it was cooked all the way through, but  it tasted too wet & too much like bread. I scrapped the whole top off & threw it out & saved as much of the ham, that I could. I put the chopped ham on a pan & browned it on the stove top. I'm so glad I had extra eggs in the fridge. I scrambled some eggs & served the chopped ham as a side.

Very good, easy casserole. I used about 1/2 of a soft,  french loaf of bread (had an extra loaf on hand that I needed to use) and 8oz sharp, shredded cheddar (had on hand) and it turned out great! Will make again.

I don't know what kind of bread was originally used when creating this recipe (hopefully, not plain old white sandwich bread.)  I used sourdough rye bread (with the seeds) for flavor & texture.  I also added a tiny sprinkle of garlic powder, and some fresh minced parsley.  It was very tasty after making my personal adjustments.

I make a variation of this same recipe.  However, I omit the salt due to there being enough in the ham and I add sliced pimento stuffed olives and a small can of sliced mushrooms.  I also use sharp cheddar cheese.  I used to butter my bread but I no longer think it's necessary and I put the bread on the bottom layer and then go from there.  I've tried other recipes but my family still prefers this one.

I changed the recipe to include the Spanish lady's changes. French bread, emmentaler cheese, and I did cut the milk to 2 cups because we live at 6000 feet. Also I also added the mild canned chili's from COSTCO.

With so many great reviews I thought I’d give this one a try. The flavour was great. Mine wasn’t runny at all but I couldn’t get passed the texture of the bread. It was very soggy. I tried cooking it a bit longer but it didn’t help. I couldn’t get anyone in my family to eat it. I might try it again but without the bread. Disappointed.

I add veggies, whatever is around. Today was mushrooms, green onions, and zucchini. I also used light sour cream for part of the milk. Breakfast sausage in place of ham. Texas toast croutons I was trying to use up in place of bread. Yes, I know, I changed everything. Point is, this is a great basic recipe I refer to over and over again, while making it mine (and a little different) every time.

Great breakfast casserole, very easy and versatile. Can use sausage instead of ham. I mixed the bread directly into the custard and baked the assembled dish immediately. Went over very well with my guy who hates “weird egg things”. Thanks so much.

I changed up this recipe a bit and it was fun and tasty.  Instead of bread, I used plain mini-bagels and instead of baking, I make them in a waffle maker.  Just the right amount of crunch and a moist middle.

This is a good, solid recipe.  I made it as written, except that I cut it in half, making four servings instead of eight.  I also followed the advice of others and used less milk -- in my case, that meant 1 cup instead of 1 1/2.  There was no sogginess.  Now that I've tried it as written, here's what I'd do differently next time:  1. Continue using the smaller amount of milk.  2. Omit the salt altogether, because the ham is plenty salty already.  3. Add some black pepper.  4. Add some finely chopped green and red bell pepper for a "Christmasy" look.  5. Bake it on a lower rack in the oven, because the top of mine got browner than I'd have preferred.  All of that, though, is just fine-tuning.   This recipe is a keeper, and who knows, maybe we'll make it on one of the other 364 days of the year!

This recipe turned out great and was super easy.  I really like the versatility of this recipe.  You can use any type of bread or cheese or spice combination and I plan on using cooked ground sausage next time I make this recipe!

I used bacon and sausage instead of ham and it turned out pretty good.  I also cut the recipe in half which I think made it just a little dry.

I made half a recipe. I listened to the other reviews and cut the milk down, i used almond milk. I also switched mushroom, green bell pepper, onion, and tomato in in place of the ham. Instead of salt and dry mustard, I used some oregano and a couple drops of dijon mustard. I left the butter out altogether. Lastly i used vegan cheese and probably alot less. I like it, it has a satisfying easy taste with just enough zing, my mom is less impressed (she wanted ham, salt, pepper, and lots of real cheese! XD) admittedly pepper probably would be a good idea. I plan to make it again. ^.^

I used leftover airy bread from the bakery and a mild white cheddar. I also halved the recipe and cooked it in a glass pie dish.  It came out decadent!

This was fantastic, my family loved it. I made a change, I added 1 pound of bacon instead of the quarter cup in the recipe. But  the family would like to have this on a regular basis. Sunday mornings when everyone is home.

After reading the reviews I opted for using a baguette rather than sliced bread, which I think added a nice texture and consistency. I used sliced American cheese mixed with cheddar and this was a mistake. The sliced cheese did not melt well and did not go well with the dish. In the future I will stick with cheddar or I may try goat's cheese or other types of cheese. I considered substituting bacon for ham, but went with ham which went very well with the eggs and melted cheese. Happy cooking!

I think I will make it again. I accidentally buttered both sides of the bread but that was fine. I also let it sit in the refrigerator for like 3 more day and then cooked it.It was really good it just had a lot of water at the bottom.(:

A very nice breakfast to wake up to and very easy to make. Although I'm not sure why the crust needed to be cut off the bread or why the bread needed to be buttered (there's already oil in the cheese, fat in the ham, and non-stick spray on the dish). It seems like those two steps could be skipped and still get the same good results. Also, I prefer cheddar cheese instead of American and, to save time, I  used an 8 oz. bag of shredded cheddar instead of cutting a block of cheese into cubes.

Total junk food. I make this type of thing with hearty bread (whole wheat/sourdough combo) and with sharp cheddar and low fat heart healthy Canadian bacon. I get raves.

This recipe is so good and I plan on making it for my family this Christmas when we are all together. I did make a few changes like leaving the bread crust on and omitting the butter. I added sautéed onion, red pepper, minced garlic, Swiss chard, finely chopped summer squash, and an organic seasoning called Herbie, that I use when cooking.
