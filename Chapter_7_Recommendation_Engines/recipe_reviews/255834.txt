I added a handful of raisins and about a half teaspoon of cinnamon aside from the cinnamon stick. I left out the salt and added a bit more sugar. Simple to make. Good recipe.

This is a great base recipe for arroz con leche. All regions have slightly different versions of it, I followed the recipe and added 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and a 1/2 cup raisins.

I added lemon zest to mine and it tastes so good. You don’t taste lemon in it but it adds kind of a mystery flavor that you just can’t put your finger on.

This came out perfectly creamy, and I used 12 oz evaporated milk and the rest whole milk. It wasn't very sweet, but I added some strawberries on top, and that sweetened it nicely without any extra sugar. Today I had some more just plain, and I added a bit more sugar. If you want to eat this for breakfast, it's fine without added sugar; if you want this as a dessert, definitely add more sugar.

It was very good and actually pretty sweet. I only made two changes. I didn't put in any salt and I used more coconut milk than I did regular milk.

I grew up eating this!  I tried this recipe and have to say the only thing I would change is the salt.  I think next time I would omit it completely.  Otherwise, great recipe!
