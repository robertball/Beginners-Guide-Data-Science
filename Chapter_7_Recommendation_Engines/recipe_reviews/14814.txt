Applause Applause Applause.  I made this the first time for a couple who had never come over to eat before.  I served it as an appetizer with a crusty italian bread cut in about 3/4 inch slices.  I doubled the recipe and we ate the whole thing it is that good.  My guests were stunned and are still talking about what a "great cook I am".  The reaction was outstanding and the dip is perfect.  I just added diced roma tomatoes and fresh chopped basil to the top just before serving.  Be sure to let the top get nice and brown.  If not it won't be hot all the way through.  We make this dish all the time now.  It reheats great. Nice presentation and excellent texture.  I would serve this to anybody at any occasion.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I substituted cream cheese for the heavy cream and I think that made it better.  I also served it in a bread bowl.  Everyone I've made this for LOVED it! :)

Great dip. I had a craving for spinach artichoke dip and it was satisfied. I will admit, I bartend for a restaurant whos spin dip is really creamy, and this recipe was really nothing like it. This dip was perfect with the garlic parmesan breadsticks I made from this site.  In case you are in search of a creamier dip, my restaurant uses chicken stock to make the dip thinner. Just a suggestion.

WOW!  Everyone loved this recipe!  I've made it 3 times since Christmas!  It also gave everyone a "taste" for artichokes, which was something we did not have prior to this! Some changes - I did not layer anything - mixed it all together and popped it in the oven.  I did not use the heavy cream and instead added two 8oz bricks of softened cream cheese. I used a combo Romano/Parmesan already grated cheese. I used the jarred minced garlic in olive oil (and I doubled it for our family). It gets just a little crusty on the edges, but everyone inhaled those too.  It is even better the next day (so it is safe to make a day ahead, if you can stand the yummy aroma!), and can be popped right back in the oven without losing anything.  This is a total keeper at our house - many thanks for sharing!  Wish I had some right now...

I doubled this recipe for a party and used a round chafing dish. I baked it in the oven for 20 minutes and then kept it warm over the sterno.   I also modified the recipe a bit: more garlic(!), some white pepper, SALT (it needed it), some cream cheese (i had leftover in the fridge) and oddly enough - freshly grated nutmeg.  The nutmeg really brought oomph to it.  I didn't add a lot, maybe 1/2 teaspoon (remember, I doubled this recipe).  It was a hit!  All proclaimed it to be better than a restaurants!

This is a fantastic dip, however, I highly recommend making it in a smaller pan - I used a square corningware casserole, and it came out perfectly.  I did not have any romano cheese, so I increased the parmesan.  I also increased the garlic to boost the flavor.  The main flavor here are the cheeses - if you want more spinach flavor, try "Holiday Hot Spinach Dip" on this site.

Very tasty and loved by all of my company, including the kids. My only change was that I used two cans of artichokes, one of which was in a marinade and I topped this dish with parm and a sprinkling of paprika.

The first time I tasted this dip was at a friend's dinner party.  We all polished it off within 10 minutes!  She gave me the recipe, and I made it the next week for my very picky boyfriend.  He devoured it...  Try using asiago cheese along with the romano for a nice sharp flavor. Delicious!

Loved this recipe!  I followed several other reviewers suggestions and made the following modifications: I used 4 large cloves of garlic - which made a huge impact on flavor since several people commented on the bland flavor.  I added an additional 7.5 oz jar of artichoke hearts and chopped them small.  I also used double the romano and parmesan cheeses.  Fresh parmesan and mozzarella made for a much creamer result although it does make a longer prep time due to the grating.  I added 4 oz cream cheese which i melted in the microwave first so it was easier to mix in.  Added a splash of fresh lemon juice, fresh ground pepper and sea salt.  It was so good I was licking the bowl while the dip was baking!  5 stars with the modifications.  Thanks to all those who made the great suggestions to make this dish spectacular! :)

I found this recipe on 5/22/2001 and I am still making it to this day! I love it and so does every other person that comes in contact with it. The only thing I do different know is use 2 cloves of garlic chopped instead of minced garlic. I love garlic!!!

Excellent flavor...made as directed with minor substitutions:  half-cup SHREDDED parm for grated romano and grated parm; Italian three-cheese blend for mozzarella.  I like that this recipe doesn't call for mayo or cream cheese.  Next time I want to try with double everything except spinach and artichokes as this dip is thick and chunky:  seems like the cheesy/creamy part of the dip is holding the spinach together.  Altho I like spinach, I would like to have spinach in my dip instead of vice versa, but that's just a personal preference.  The flavor of this recipe is excellent and I will use it again!  Thanks.  Update to my January 2008 review:  DON'T try this with double everything except the spinach...didn't work out AT ALL!!!

Missing lots of flavor. I think needs to be made with 8oz of cream cheese instead of the sour cream.

Subtituted cream cheese for the heavy cream & I also increase the garlic and used 2 whole cloves.
Make sure you mince the artichoke & spinach really fine. I think it improves the texture of the dip. Also, try making it in the crockpot to free up your oven while entertaining. Cook on high heat for 2-3 hours, stirring once. Turns out great!

OMG! I was looking for a dip that tasted like T.G.I.F.'s. This is even BETTER! I hv had this for 2yrs now & our family LOVES it! I just add everything in bowl & mince my garlic & use the 3 mix Italian cheese & dont forget SALT & Pepper VERY IMPORTANT. EVERYONE that tries this dip just go's on and on about how good it is! I also use jar artichokes & barley cut them so you get nice chunks of it, really good.  I also use roma tomatoes, tk out seeds & then cut into small cubes. I just put them right in the middle so if you want some you can & if you don't then that is fine too!  Love this recipe & Thank you so much for sharing this with everyone. I think everyone will make it there own in small ways but without this being the base starter recipe, wouldn't ever happen! I would never look for an other one! :) I use tortilla chips with my dip. I am Mexican so I hv too!!! :) Love my chips.

I made this recipe out of necessity.  I forgot I had to bring the dip for Thanksgiving and it was too late to run to Costco, so I found the recipe on my iphone and gathered the ingredients at the store.  I've made a dip like this before and it turned out "alright" but not MMMmmmm!!!  The only thing I forgot to do was put in the garlic... after it was done!  I know DO NOT forget the garlic!  I had some roasted garlic heads in the fridge and quickly smooshed them up and I put in probably 1 1/2 HEADS of roasted garlic... I know that's a lot but it was incredible and we all love garlic.  So I mixed up the melted mozzarella on top and mixed it back into the dip, incorporating the garlic and then sprinkled more mozzarella again.... cooked for another 20 minutes, took it out and hoped for the best.  The dip at Costco is one of our favorites!!  My sister tasted this and she thought it tasted just like it, if not better.  This was great... she wouldn't embellish her compliment. lol    I thought it was fantastic!!  I don't know if cooking it twice made any difference, but oh it was delish.  It was almost all gone by Turkey time and no one was hungry.  Went great with crackers.  I think the grainier the cracker the better.  :-)  Will keep this one forever!!

Note: Do NOT mistake  Artichoke CAPS for Hearts.  Huge mistake! ;-)  Wasn't paying attention when I was buying ingredients.  And I always buy marinated artichoke hearts... adds good flavor.

This was fantastic!  I have had the same taste & quality in a restaurant.  I opted not to use the blender to chop the artichoke hearts and cheese; instead I mixed them by hand which was just fine.  I also increased the garlic, but next time would use even more (1/2 tsp is seriously not enough!!).  Served with sliced baguette bread & whole-wheat tortilla chips.  De-lish!!!!

Really good, and easy to make changes for personal preference too. I always use fresh spinach and a little more then it calls for, more like 12-14 oz. I saute it quickly in a little butter and minced garlic until it wilts and then mix it in with everything else. I love that it's really chunky, more spinach and artichoke then cheese, although I usually add a little more cheese than it calls for too.

I made this for my superbowl get together and it was pretty good.  I don't really think it needs the romano cheese if you are serving it for a bunch of guys drinking beer, but it is a nice touch.  I would also bake this in a smaller pan next time because it was spread out so thin that it didn't get nice and melty in the middle.  Also--don't puree the artichoke!  Just chop into small pieces.

YES!  For once, a recipe WITHOUT cream cheese.  I hate cream cheese in spinach dips.  And this one doesn't taste like vinegar either-no hot sauce or vinegar called for!  We LOVED it.  I do not understand why someone said they would give it less than one star-they must have done something wrong.  My husband said it's the best homemade spinach dip by far.  Oh, we left out the artichokes.  We don't like them.

I give this a 10.  It is way better than Apple Bee's by far.  You just have to make sure to really drain and squeeze out your spinach so that your dip does not become runny.  I have made this a favorite for my events.

This was yummy and easy to put together. I used jalapeno jack cheese instead of the Romano cheese. I also substituted collard greens for the spinach since that's what I had on hand. Thank You Sherrie for a keeper:)

My guests LOVED this. I'm giving it 4 stars only because i couldn't really taste the artichokes. I think i will add more next time.  Very easy and simple to make!

This is good!  I did make a few alterations, though.  Instead of the heavy cream, I used cream cheese.  In my opinion, it made the dip creamier and cheesier--plus that's what I happened to have on hand.  Also, I used a blend of five Italian cheeses.  I love garlic so I doubled that, and added a little salt and fresh-ground black pepper.  It was delicious!  For a crunchy topping, sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and place under the broiler for a few minutes after baking.  I follow the low carb plan, so I top chicken breasts with this dip.  Yum!

This was delicious! I made it as described, with a few little tweaks. I didn't put everything in the food processer; I grated the cheese, mixed with 3 minced garlic cloves, then hand chopped the artichoke hearts. I mixed that together than finished with the spinach portion as described in the recipe. I think NOT processing the artichoke hearts made them stand out more in the final product. I baked it in a square 8X8 baking dish, which took a little longer to bake (about 30 minutes total) but it was well worth it. I sprinkled the top with a little more grated Parmesan. DELICIOUS!!!

Very good recipe.  I added another can of choped artichokes after everything was mixed. Because when you put the artichokes, garlic, romano, and parmesan in the processor it takes away the big chunks of artichoke for added flavor and texture!  Will make again

This dip was a big hit at my New Years party.  I used a fondue pot to keep it warm, served it with bread cubes, baby carrots and celery.  I also added a little more cheese than recipe called for and a little cream cheese.  It was wonderful,  It's so good I have made it again and I will continue to...This is definately a keeper

Friend's thought I'd bought this from a local restaurant and didn't believe at first that it was easy to make.Try it-it's wonderful, even if you weren't sure about artichoke anything in a recipe. Trust me-it's awesome.

Five stars as far as prep goes as this couldn't have been easier to whip together and perfect if you have a full evening of prep with other food items if you are entertaining. The recipe as is lacks flavor. To enhance the taste the next time I make this I  will try substituting Jalapeno Pepper Monterey Jack Cheese. And I will saute the spinach in garlic and and just enough butter to coat the spinach. I did add one spoon of a Peruvian Hot Pepper sauce I always have on hand and that did help boost the flavor. I'd have to say this recipe did not deliver very big in the flavor department. I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for a more flavorful version of this classic dip.

This was very good but lacked a bit of flavour to it. I believe adding some salt to the recipe would help. Also, I think I may take the advice of many others and replace the heavy creme with creme cheese. We will definitely make this one again!

In the restaurant this is typically mostly spinach and hardly any artichoke due to the cost.  This recipe is affordable and better than most restaurant versions.

I've made this over a dozen times! Its easy to make and tastes really good. I serve it with tortilla chips. I usually add some additional garlic salt on top of the garlic, salt and pepper. An easy tip if you wanna make it quick: Buy the Italian blend of shredded cheese @ the store and measure it out for each type of cheese in the recipe! This is how I usually make it :)

After reading the hundreds of reviews I was skeptical that I could pull off this dish without the many tweaks suggested (cream cheese, no heavy cream, etc).  I have to say I followed the instructions, with the exception I didn't have any other cheeses other than your typical Kraft Parm/Reg and shredded mozz in my fridge.  I used those and added two cloves garlic and it came out DELICIOUS.  Can't complain one bit.  For those who had a problem with the thickness, I added all the ingredients in my food processor.  It kept the mess minimal, and chopped up the spinach even more--making it a bit creamier.  

Thanks!

I added Asiago cheese and grated fresh parmesan for this dish. I also finely chopped the artichokes and used a little extra spinach, it was amazing! Brought this to a party where another person had brought spinach and artichoke dip as well...mine was scraped clean and hers still had half left by the end of the night!

this turned out great. if you use a blender like i did, add a little cream to the mix to ease the blending. i used half & half cream instead of heavy cream because other reviewers said it was too thick. i covered it with foil until the last 5 minutes. *for 4 people, 1/2 the recipe is the perfect amount.

This is a good recipe.  I added a few things to it: one medium red onion, minced, a tsp of pepper and a Tbsp of hot sauce.  I divided it up into 4 servings (enough for 1-2 people) and put the others in the freezer for future use.  Thanks for the recipe.

This had wonderful flavor (I added extra fresh minced garlic, simply because I'm a garlic fiend), and was excellent served with tortilla chips, and chunks of sourdough bread.
My only complaint was that it seemed a little thick as it cooled.  I might try adding a little extra cream or sour cream next time.  It was helpful to serve it in a stoneware dish, as it kept the heat a little better.

Delicious and super simple to make. I made a full batch and froze half to heat up another time. I served it with unsalted triscuits instead of tortilla chips.

Delicious!  To save money I did not buy the romano cheese and just used more parmesan.  This does need some salt.  I would mix it in before baking.

This was an amazing dip!  We followed the advice of other reviews and added 2 8oz packages of lowfat cream cheese (neufchatel?) and skipped the heavy cream.  Used mayo since we don't love the texture with sour cream, and used about 3/4 can of chicken broth to thin to a dipping consistency.  We also added quite a bit more cheese, maybe two cups total, then put mozzerella on top and it was absolutely perfect!  My kids ate it up, and since it made so much, they ate the leftovers the next day.  So did I.  So much for resolutions, this was GOOD! Addendum:  After reading the other recent reviews, I wanted to add that using sour cream (I have before in this type of dip) seems to make it curdle, which is why I did not use it.  I don't normally like mayo in dips, but it worked well in this.  By adding the cream cheese it adds richness and smoothness, and because it would be very, very thick otherwise, used chicken broth while beating until smooth, and I think that is what made it turn out so silky.  It was just so perfect!  Whoever mentioned the chicken broth, I love you!  We used more garlic, too, and the extra cheese was because I thought I thinned it too much.  It didn't taste terribly cheesey, though.  Again, perfect. I don't like chunky, pasty dips either!

I always order this dip in restaurants and so for my sister's bridal shower I decided to try and make it myself. This turned out amazing. Everyone loved it. even my mother & sisters, who don't like spinach or artichoke!!! I served it with wheat thins and tortilla chips... I will definitely make this for the next get together as well.

This was really good.  I modified the recipe because I did not have Romano, Mozzarella, or heavy cream.  I substituted Monterey Jack for the cheeses and half & Half for the heavy cream.  All my guest raved about it and have requested it for our next get-together!

This is the best dip ever!!  Everyone calls me to ask how to make it and I am expected to bring it to almost all occasions!  The only thing I have altered is I add almost two cups of the heavy cream to make it easier to dip into.  It's the perfect consistency once more liquid is added.

Everyone at the party *loved* this...even the hate-to-eat-green-things-guys.

I served it with smallish pieces of pumpernickel bread and carrots.

I didn't have any frozen spinach, so I used 5 oz. (instead of 10 oz.) of *fresh* spinach.  I actually just threw the spinach mixture in the food processor with everything else for a *very* brief pulse, so that I wouldn't even have to chop up the fresh spinach.  

This was wonderful.  One of my friends from out of town told me that I must make this dish every time we get together.

This had a very good flavor, but turned out very dry for me. I added more sour cream to what was left over.

This recipe is so simple and soooo good! My family loves their spin dip so it's the first thing we order when dining out for our appetizer....well not anymore we will probably be making this weekly! It also makes a large enough amount for entertaining and goes great with the "Perfect Pita Chips" recipe on this site. I followed this recipe except for following suggestions to add just a little chicken broth to make it smooth and creamy which also helps it from getting thick when reheating. Hope you all enjoy this we sure did

I have made this recipe numerous times!  I have used it as a sauce on pizza instead of a red sauce, and as a spread on a sandwich for more pizzazzzz.  It is very versatile.  I do however, change a few things.  Replace the frozen 10 oz spinach with roughly 14-16 oz fresh spinach and it seems to make a HUGE difference.  I add 2 more teaspoons of minced garlic, and 1 cup more cup of Fresh Parmesean cheese.   I have been known to make a batch and freeze it in small portions (pyrex is the best, you can take it from the freezer to the oven or microwave!).  Great for last minute events, and wonderful for parties all through the year.   I have not ever had a negative comment.   I am so very thankful for this great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  My family loved it at Easter - served as an appetizer.  After dinner, they were still going back for more.  They took the small amount that was left home with them!

This was just ok, too much spinach. It didn't have that creamy taste I like in my dip. Some of my family members loved it and some thought it was just ok. I served it with Hawaiian bread and I think that helped.

When I first tasted it, I was very disappointed at how bland it was, so I went back to check the recipe and make sure I didn't forget an ingredient. I hadn't, but to salvage it, I decided to add mayo, salt and pepper. It was delicious! We had eaten half of it before the guests arrived! This is a keeper, but make sure to add the mayo!

Finally, a Spinach Artichoke dip that actually tastes like spinach and artichokes, not like most which use a packet of seasoning which overtakes the flavor. This is indulgent and perfect.

I was pretty disapointed in this dip. It was pretty think, not creamy at all. I went shopping for the ingredients and realized there was no cream cheese in this recipe. Although the flavor was good...it still lacked the creamy texture I was hoping for...sorry, I will not make this again.

I did use cream cheese instead because I didn't have any cream.
I wasn't impressed with this right out of the oven, but it was much better the next day.  I agree that it's a bit dry for me and maybe I will try milk next time. Also, I used marinated hearts and didn't care much for that strong taste.

This is a great recipe, it will make your kitchen smell heavenly! I did not put the artichokes in the food processor, it turned out better just cutting the artichokes into chunks. It's really complemented with Wheat Thins or a similar cracker.

This one worked out yummy!  I haven't tried any of the other recipes for spinach artichoke dip, even though they're all highly rated, so I don't know how it ranks in comparison, but it tasted great to me.  .  I actually got the recipe from my mom (who probably got it from this site, too) so I decided to try it. I used marinated artichokes and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder (appx. 2 cloves) and I think it made a big difference. I considered using 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream like some reviewers suggested, but I didn't, and it worked out fine. Next time I want to use more artichokes, just cause I like them so much.

This came out soooo gooey and yummy - it was a major hit! I would make sure to serve it very warm, though. I took it to a family dinner over an hour away and hadn't thought about that.... it was cool to the touch when served and was hardly eaten. I, however, had tasted it straight out of the oven so I knew it was delicious.... The hostess sent me home with the leftovers and I re-warmed it in the oven and my husband and I devoured it with tortilla chips!!! Next time I will double it and make sure I serve it bubbly ;)

i've had a lot of trouble finding a recipe that works for me, whether due to my own ineptitude or not. however, this recipe was great and pretty easy. i did follow other's advice and subsituted low fat cream cheese for the cream. wasn't sure how much to use, so i added about half a block. turned out great! i meant to try the nutmeg, but forgot. it was delish anyway! also wound up cooking it for about another 10 minutes than called for. thanks for a great recipe! btw, is it just me or is squeezing the water out of spinach a pain in the pratt?

This recipe was good, but not what I had envisioned.  I was envisioning a dip that would be similar to the first one I had at Planet Hollywood.  I think I may have cooked the dip too long, because it wasn't creamy, but the taste was ok.  I'll try it again, but pay attention to the length of time it is in the oven.

I was disappointed in this dip. It was ok but not as creamy as I expected it to be. It came out too dry/thick for the suggested accompanying tortilla chips, had to tear up a round loaf of gourmet bread to go with it. At the cost of ingredients, I would not make this again.

I made this today but did NOT have spinach. I used fresh Kale instead.  I approximately used 5 large hand fulls of fresh kale and boiled it for a few minutes; drained and pat dried it for 10 oz. I proceeded with the recipe with a few changes. I added one small can of whole chilies that I pulsed along with step #2. I used Greek plain yogurt instead of sour cream. As a topping I added sprinkles of paprika.

This recipe is awesome! When I blend the artichokes in my blender it always comes out creamy. Doesn't matter, it is still good. I prefer the seasoned artichokes in oil. I double the recipe for parties and sometimes mix everything together the night before and then bake when ready the next day. Serving it with Pico de Gallo really steps it up a notch.

I followed the recipe and wasn't thrilled with the taste.  I refrigerated it, then later decided to try to improve it.  I added 4 oz cream cheese, more garlic, more parmesan cheese and a squeeze of lemon, baked it again for 15 minutes and it was much better.  The cream cheese really added a lot both in taste and texture.  My husband and son both loved it.  Next time I think I will add another can of artichokes as there wasn't enough for my liking.

I used a little skim milk with 1/3 cup of cream cheese instead of the heavy cream and I used a little more parmesan and mozzarella instead of the other cheese but it was super good! My whole floor loved it!

I can't tell you how many times I've made this recipe! Every time we go anywhere and need to bring something this is always requested. Presents nicely in a carved out bread boule and every crumb is always gone. 

I do up the garlic and Parmesan amounts for a little extra flavor amid the mild sour cream and mozzerella. Definitely prefer the hot version of spinach/artichoke dip to the cold one.

Amazing restaurant style dip.  I did make a few small changes.  Two 8 oz pkg of cream cheese instead of heavy cream, 14 oz marinated artichoke hearts chopped, two pkg of mozz, romano, parm mix cheese, three teaspoons roasted minced garlic and 12 oz frozen bagged spinach.  I made it for my family steak dinner and they loved it so much they requested it to be served as an appetizer for the crawfish boil the next day.  This is definetly a keeper.

Instead of heavy cream and sour cream, I used mayo and a package of cream cheese. Also added several dashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce and a can of crab meat. We both loved it!

You know what would make this a FIVE STAR recipe?  A packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix and some salt, some chopped white, yellow or green onions, and salt and black pepper to taste.  Try it!  It'll crank this recipe up to TOP NOTCH!

I found this recipe and gave it to my sister who is not the best cook. She made it for our  family Christmas Eve dinner. The dip came out great with no alterations! The family enjoyed it, and there was none left at the end of the night.

After reading a few of the reviews I decided to replace the heavy cream with cream cheese.  Although because of other comments that this recipe was a little bland I used a cup of Philly's herb and garlic cream cheese, a clove of garlic (instead of 1/2 tsp), and salt and pepper to taste.  I got rave reviews with the few changes I made above.

This is a pretty good recipe.  The first time I made this I followed the recipe and it was pretty good.  I made this again yesterday and changed it up a little.  I used 8 oz. cream cheese instead of the cream and added 2 cups of mozz. cheese.  Next time I will add more garlic.  I brought this to work for a coworkers birthday and it was a hit.  I will definately be making this again soon...maybe for Christmas.  Enjoy!!

Great recipe and so easy!! I put it in the crockpot (instead of the oven) about 2 hours before a party, and it turned out perfectly. Everybody loved it. I used 1 block and frozen spinach and 1 bag a fresh spinach (I doubled the recipe) and it was great. For leftovers, my husband topped his with Frank's Red Hot sauce and it was amazing! The spicy buffalo flavor of the sauce mixed with the creamy cheese flavor of the dip was delightful. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making this for more than just parties!

Best spinach dip ever, with modifications such as the following: I used all of these ingredients and added one 8oz block of cream cheese (like other reviewers suggested as an alternative to the heavy cream, but I still used the heavy cream) and one package of vegetable mix. I still modified the recipe by processing the spinach dip and the artichokes, and then mixing them, and the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl, no layering. Since I added a small block of cream cheese, I left some of the moisture in the spinach and I added extra heavy cream to help make the recipe creamier. I also garnished with diced tomatoes and green onions. Next time, I may add a lil bit of liquid smoke to intensify the flavor.

I made this dip this weekend for entertaining and this dip is absolutely delicious.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder for flavor.  This is definitely going to be on the menu everytime I entertain.

THE BEST EVER! I blended the sour cream, parm (no romano), garlic, cream (used milk other times), and the artichokes in a blender; I eyeball the milk/cream to make it blend a bit easier, but it still comes out much thicker than restaurant style. I squeeze out the water from the spinach by wrapping it in a paper towel. This recipe makes a lot, but does not last long in my household!

Yummy and easy to make.  I like a few personal additions: replace mozz with cheddar cheese, extra garlic, and a 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for some kick.  I also replace the heavy cream with fat free half and half.  You can use marinated artichokes for a little extra flavor too.  SOOO GOOD

call it operator error if you will, but perhaps fresh mozerella (you know, the one that comes in liquid) is not the key to this tasty dip. it's wasn't bad, just a little bland.

good potential...but needs alot more flavor. All the flavor is from the cheese...which didn't have enough punch for me. The garlic could be quadrupled and the salt close to doubled. I'd think about adding some onion, diced water chesnuts, and maybe even some diced roasted red bell peppers next time for more dynamic in the appearance and texture. Its a good start though..and if you prefer mellow flavors you'll love it as is.

Delicious! Myself and my boyfriend enjoyed it more than restaurant dips. It didn't have that extreme creaminess which is what we liked about it. Served it with a side of crostini.

This was great.  I added half a bar of cream cheese also at others' suggestion.  On top, I sprinkled some of the romano, parmesan and mozzerella cheese.  Took longer to bake then expected.  Made it up during the day, then set out an hour before baking...

Hands down, best spinach dip ever. I do like to add some softened cream cheese into my mix before I bake. Just be careful not to add more than a few tbs or you will over power it.

Great recipe!  Nice and thick and full of flavor!  I altered it a bit to suit our tastes...  substituted the heavy cream with cream cheese and doubled the garlic.  Super good!

This is the same receipe I've been using for years, but I add 1 package of softened cream cheese, 1 tbl spoon of lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp of salt. I tried this receipe as shown and it was not creamy enough w/out the cream cheese.

I also thought this was sort of bland. I  used cream cheese and a little milk to thin it out. Added slat and pepper after it was finished. Salsa is also good with this dip.

Very good dip. I made some changes based on what others said like subsituting cream cheese for the heavy cream, adding a little more garlic and using a four cheese grated blend with asiago instead of romano. It tasted even better the next day when I ate the leftovers. Will definately make this one again.

This recipe is soooo good! The only changes I made was using asiago cheese instead of romano, and marinated artichoke hearts, plus sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. Hubby and I both loved it!

This is really good and easy. It presents well and is much less expensive than the store bought stuff and tastes even better. I personally like it better before it's cooked.

This is the greatest spinach artichoke dip ever!!! EVER!!! This is so awesome.  I even got a fresh wedge of romano cheese to grate into the mix. I got jarred artichoke hearts, it was awesome.  I made this as a holiday appetizer and it went over tremendously well.  Thank you.

I also substituted cream cheese for the heavy cream, and added 1/2 jar of alfredo sauce, as suggested by one reviewer.  The result was perfect, it tasted JUST like the artichoke dip at the chain restaurant!

I made 3 substitutions due to lack of ingredients: I substituted plain, drained yogurt for the sour cream, half-n-half for the heavy cream and used additional parmesan and a little pecorino for the romano cheese. Other than that I really tried to follow the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, a taste test yielded a somewhat bland dip. I then added about 1/4 cup each of mayo and cream cheese, along with some fresh ground pepper, a little kosher salt, some red seasoning blend, extra garlic and a splash of lemon juice. Ahhh. Much better. 3 stars for the original (albeit with my minor substitutions) and 5 stars for the modified recipe. Average = 4 stars. Still a good rating for a good base recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Very good but instead of sour cream and heavy cream, add 2/3 of a jar of alfredo sauce. Definitely try that- adds more flavor and makes it more of a dip.

I really like this dip and have made it several times, but the straight recipe is a bit too spinachy for me.  This time I doubled the artichokes and cheeses and it was perfect!  I also use a pre-shredded romano, asiago and parmesan mix in place of the romano and parmesan.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it is always a big hit whenever I make it.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  First of all it needed salt, second of all it was dry and thick.  Next time I will add 1/2 tsp. of salt, and add a total of 1 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup more cream or milk to the recipe.

Awesome dip, all my friends ask me to make this dip regularly. I skipped the heavy cream once and wasn't as happy with the cream cheese subsitution as others, mine came out really thick delicious but way too thick. I prefer a creamy dip that dosen't break the tortilla chips, so the heavy cream or half and half is the only way to go!

This gave me instant popularity at the party tonight! People were fighting over the last bites! I liked it especially because you could really taste the artichokes. It was a good consistency - creamy, cheesy, and a good balance of flavors. The only changes I made were: no heavy cream (didn't drain all the juice from the artichoke can), added about 2 oz cream cheese, added a good 1.5 tsp salt, a little bit of nutmeg, added 1/3 c. mayonnaise, and I increased the garlic to 2 full cloves. Instead of pureeing, I chopped it by hand. I used a 7 x 11 dish and baked it for about 35 mins. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe was fantastic for my superbowl party!  I used some cream cheese as well, and added lump crab meat, extra garlic, white pepper, and a little hot sauce.  I served it with toasted pita points brushed with butter and a little garlic salt.

This dip was a hit at my company Christmas party. Several people asked for the recipe. There were no leftovers here! 
I didn't know if the parmesan cheese had to be fresh grated, so I used the regular Kraft stuff in the shaker and took a risk, and it was awesome!

I loved this recipe.  I served it at our Super Bowl party and it was a big hit!  I cut up french bread in slices, brushed some melted butter on it and broiled it for a couple minutes and served it with the dip.  This was a nice change from tortilla chips.  I will definitely make it again.

I chose this recipe instead of another one, and I wished I tried the other one instead!  I made this for a party, and it turned out to be somewhat dry and chunky.  I really like Houston's restaurant spinach dip and was hoping for something more like that. There's another recipe on here that uses Alfredo sauce, that may do the trick...

The recipe turned out to be much more moist than I originally anticipated- which was GOOD thing!  I mixed it all up ahead of time, and put it in a casserole dish to bake at our cabin.  I fed it to some picky eaters, and they seemed to really enjoy it.  I would make this my go-to recipe for artichoke spinach dip.

OMG - Yummy for your tummy.  I need to preface this review with the fact that I HAD to alter the recipe slightly. I didn't have mozzarella cheese. so I added an additional 1/2 cup Romano cheese and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  I also grabbed the wrong measuring cup for the cream and added 1/2 cup.  With those changes, this recipe tasted JUST like the Hot Artichoke Spinach Dip from The Daily Grill in downtown Washington DC (M Street & Connecticut).  To set it off even more, I buttered some Ciabata bread, sliced it into bread strips and toasted in a 400 degree oven for 7-10 minutes.  All I can say is MAGNIFICENT and feel free to unbutton your pants when you eat this!!

I misplaced my other spinach recipe and this one had some simular ingredients so I tried it.  VERY BLAND.  It lacked taste.  I will have to find my other recipe that had mayonaise in it, which now I know, makes a huge difference in taste.  Water chestnuts would of been good too, it needs a crunch to it. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!

Very good, although could use a bit more flavor (hence the four stars instead of five).  I tripled the garlic and added some salt.  I also used a blend of cheeses (in stead of the mozzarella) with some sharper tastes to give it a little more character.

This was easy to make and everyone loved it. I used a pre-made romano/parmesan cheese combo. Not sure if the ratio was the same, but it was still good. I added more than the called-for amount of moz. cheese and garlic to make it to my taste. And the recipe was easily adaptable. It lends itself well to adding/subtracting of ingredients to suit your own tastes. Making it again tonight for a neighborhood get together. THANKS FOR SHARING!

It was ok, but I ended up having to add another 8 oz of mozarella and some more sour cream.  It seemed like there was way too much spinach and artichoke and not enough creaminess and cheese.  But it was ok.

I was searching for a artichoke spinach recipe that didn't include a cup of mayonnaise... the though of that just makes me gag. But, I also needed a GF recipe. This one fit the bill perfectly. I went a little crazy with the cheese and added more than the actual recipe called for (you can never have too much cheese) and I used about a can and a half of artichokes, just because I like it that way. I also added a bit of salt because upon final taste it seemed a bit bland.... but overall, delicious, and exactly what I needed for my party!!!

I made this for New Years Eve, but took out the heavy cream and sour cream and used 8oz softened cream cheese.  Although I had made a double batch, it was gone by midnight. (I had to reheat during the evening)

I have made this for a while now and everyone loves it. I have revised it here and there, but I have people eating it without chips or anything else just plain. I put 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of hellmans mayo. I use the artichokes unmarinated i use 3-4 cloves of garlic with 1 cup of parmesam cheese and 2 1/2 cups of monterey jack cheese. People love it!!!!!

I made a few changes just because of what I had on hand. I used garlic seasoned artichoke hearts, used cream cheese instead of heavy cream and used pepperjack cheese instead of romano and it came out wonderfully! I also served it in a bread bowl which also was a hit. A few days later my boyfriend and I used the leftover dip as a filling in burritos and he liked it even better that way.

I was looking for a dip recipe for an upcoming bridal shower and this works great.  When I was making a test batch, I didn't have any minced garlic, so I subbed in powdered garlic.  We did find this needs just a touch of salt to bring the flavors together. Overall, a really good recipe!

Made it for new years eve and it went over great! Definitely eat it warm, not quite as delicious once it cooled.  Very easy to make ahead of time, the put in the oven when ready for it.  Also very good in a bread bowl or with triscuits.  I added a little bit of cream cheese just because I had some to use up.  Works well as leftovers too, just pop back in the oven.  I'm enjoying this for dinner tonight!

This dip is amazing!  It tastes exactly like a dip that I pay $11 for at a local bar/restaurant.  I'm soooo happy that I found this recipe. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a thick cheesy dip.

Not a big fan. It was very creamy, to the point of being watery. The spinach needs to be increased as the artichok flavor dominates. I felt the end product was missing something though not sure what.

Excellent!  You'll never miss the cream cheese for anyone who is doubtful....I used only 1/2 box of spinach, added a tad more heavy cream and a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise.  Mine was not dry at all and was definitely restaurant quality. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is very good. I made it as written. I did use a combo of fresh steamed artichoke and jarred. The taste is very spinach-y. Next time I will probably reduce the amount of spinach. It does have great flavor.

This dip was just OK.  I put all the ingredients into a baking dish, it came out nice a bubbly.  Then it went into a small crock pot to stay warm and I served it with tortilla chips.  Everyone loved it at the party, but I thought it was bland.....  Maybe it just needs a little something.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I thought it was very bland.  However, my guests disagreed with me.  After I cooked it, I put it in the crock pot on low for a few hours.  I then, added cayenne pepper, a squirt of mayo and some garlic salt.  When I served it, I cut up some tomatos for the top.  Like I said, my guests liked it.  I won't make it again.

EXCELLENT! My guests raved, and ate it all up in about 5 minutes! I should have made more! I will definitely make this again!

Changes I made were: substituted whipped cream cheese for heavy cream, used marinated artichoke hearts from glass jars for extra flavor, and added 2 teaspoons of freshly chopped garlic instead of the minced garlic. Also, I didn't think using a blender was really necessary and just made for more clean-up later. Just chop the artichoke hearts and spinach before mixing with the cheeses. I also like the way the mozarella gets crispy on top so I topped the whole dish with some of that before popping it in the oven. Makes it look GREAT! I baked mine for 30 minutes.

I subbed cream cheese for the cream and I was disappointed.  While I thought it would make it more creamy with substance,it made it drier.  It really needs the moisture from the cream and a little bit from the artichokes for creaminess.

Yummy! This was excellent. I did make a few changes.I didnt use a food processor, I just chopped the artichoke hearts. Instead of the cream I used an 8oz block of cream cheese which I soften in the microwave for about 30 sec on 50%. I doubled the sour cream & garlic. I used a mix of preshredded parmesan, romano & asiago cheeses. After everything was mixed together I added just a little bit of milk. It did lack a little salt so next time I'll add more. I also used a smaller dish, it fit perfect in a 7 x 11. Once it was in the dish I covered the top with another cup of mozzarella, so in all I used 2 cups. This was so creamy & delicious, even my mother was impressed(which isn't easy to do). This is definetly a keeper. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Very good, I added a little extra cheese for my taste preferences. The artichoke dip was a hit, the taste is even better a few days in the fridge when the flavors have merried together.

My husband and I LOVED this dish!  Be sure to chop up the artichokes so they are not too big of chunks.  We also washed them off so that the dip didn't taste too briney.  I added what cream cheese I had left in the fridge and it made it so creamy.  This is perfect eaten with a nice baguette or crackers.

This recipe was pretty good-not the best-but still pretty good.  I am a true beginner at cooking and this recipe was a snap with the aid of my food processor.  I would definitely try it again with some of the other suggestions.  It seemed like it was missing something to give it a little more zing.

I thought it was pretty good, my girlfriend thought it was GREAT.  For how unhealthy the recipe is, I thought it should have blown me away.  I am going to try it again with light sour cream and condensed milk (rather than heavy cream) as well as light mozzerela.  It might not taste as good, but my heart will thank me.  Oh, use a shallow bake dish, mine was not very spread out and it trapped a lot of the moisture durring the baking process.

After I made this recipe I felt there was still some flavor that it needed.  I made it by the recipe exactly.  I thought with the heavy cream it would be creamy but it was not.  I will continue to look for that great Artichoke spinach recipe.

Doubled the cheeses per another review.  It made a TON, and my friends gobbled it up!  Put some in the freezer so we will see how that turns out later.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Awesome recipe, so yummy!  Used cream cheese instead of heavy cream like some of the reviews suggested.  Made this for Easter dinner as an appetizer and got many compliments!  Will definitely make again.

Delicious delicious delicious!  I, like others, used sour cream instead of the mayo; I also added a bit more garlic, about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and used the cheese I had lying around (which happened to be Sargento Italian blend shredded cheese; I threw in a handful or so and sprinkled another handful on top).  NOTE:  This does NOT fill a 9x13 pan!  Use a square baking dish instead.

My husband and I thought there was a little too much spinach for our taste, but the leftovers made a fabulous pasta dish.  I used equal parts dip and ricotta cheese (15 oz), and added 2 eggs.  I boiled 12 lasagna noodles, and rolled some of the filling up in each noodle.  I laid them in a bed of alfredo sauce, covered with more alfredo, covered the dish and baked for 45 minutes. then I uncovered it and sprinkled with parmesean, baked for 15 more minutes, and then pulled it.  It was so delicious!

Delicious dip! I served with tortilla chips  and turned out great even though I grounded the mixture a little too much. Tasted much better when I sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top right when it got out of the oven.

This recipe is awesome, i brought it to work and the bowl was all but licked clean! I didnt bother buying the many specific cheeses, instead i bought a bag of the "italian blend" cheese, and used the suggestion of the whipped cream cheese. Everyone asked for the recipe.

We love this recipe!!!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and subsituted the sour cream with mayo.  However, I did add a tablespoon of sour cream to the mix before placing it in the baking dish.  Also, I layered the mozarella cheese throughout the dip.  It was wonderful.

have made this three times when I was hosting something, and the first two times I made it, I did not even get ONE BITE of it!!! I was busy serving, etc., and literally by the time I sat down to eat, it was gone!

The third time I made a double batch and made sure I got a little! It is SOOOOO GOOD. The best I have ever tasted.

This was fabulous - my family just gobbled it up as an appetizer last Thanksgiving.  I think it's even better than one served at a major restaurant chain.

I think this is just okay, but EVERYONE that has tried it loves it, including my veggie hating husband, a professional hotel chef friend of mine, and my mother-in-law (former caterer). I followed the recipe exactly, but I did put a little extra parmesan on top.  Thanks for the recipe, it makes me look like a talented cook to friends and family.

This recipe was delicious. I did not put the ingredients in a processor as we like this dip on the chunky side.  I used a 4cheese Italian blend and 1% milk instead of heavy cream - too fat heavy already. Served it with baked garlic pita chips.

Great recipe! I didn't have Romano so I used  Parmesan cheese for both portions plus added a little extra.  

For more flavor, try adding 1 Tbsp. of mayo. I gave my husband 1 cracker with the original recipe and 1 with the mayo addition and he liked the mayo one much better. It cuts down on the spinach texture.

OK...Next time I'll add another can of artichokes as I couldn't taste them at all over the spinach.  Loved the creaminess of this though. UPDATING TO ADD - I did try this with 2 cans of artichokes, and while it helped balance the spinach out, it still didn't have the tanginess and zip I was hoping for.

Although this dip was good right out of the oven, it was not as creamy or good and garlicky as others I've had. It dried out rather quickly on the buffet table though.

Ok recipe but could use A LOT more cheese and less spinach. I thought it had good taste but was missing something. Will have to try it again with altered ingredients.

A lot of spinach.  If you like the spinach dip of some of the major chain restraunts, you will want to use only half of the spinach.  Adding water chestnuts gives it a nice crunch.

This is GREAT!  We've made it at least five times.  I'm not much of one for measuring after the initial try, so I guesstimate, which makes it even faster!  One jar of garlic marinated artichokes makes it SO good! I drain the oil and put other veggies in it in the fridge for extra mileage.  My kids adore it and now love artichokes because of THIS dip!  Very rich, very satisfying and very much in demand!  YUM!

I would have prefered that it be mixed together rather than layered.  Also, it look a longer to heat through than expected and it never really got "bubbly".

The men at my party loved this, the women thought it was a bit bland.  I would probably make it again (I also used cream cheese instead of heavy cream, very good) but would add more garlic and other spices.

I baked this tasty dip in deli-sliced turkey placed in muffin tins. The turkey holds his shape and this dip complements it perfectly. This is an awesome recipe!

Good dip.  I made a few changes, I doubled the sour cream, added 1/4 c. mayo, 1/2 pckt of Knorrs vegetable mix and black pepper to taste.  Served this with with cocktail-sized rye and pumpernickel bread.  We even ate it when it was cold, not bad.

I had a dinner party and made waaayyyyyyy too much food but this was the FIRST thing to go!  It was so good.  In addition to the recipe, I sprinked fresh grated Paresan on top before baking.  I also used fresh spinach-steamed and chopped (just b/c I had it inthe house and didn't have time to buy frozen) and it was great!

Fantastic. Used homemade sourdough as the dipped item. SOOO good. The only change was we used a blend of mozzerella, romano, permesan, and asiago chees instead of just mozzerella.

What an excellent and easy dip!  I made this twice in less than 3 days.  This is something that you can experiment with by adding extra ingredients.  My only (MINOR) complaint is that I think it needs to cook a lot longer than called for.  I served this with homemade herbed, crusty bread.  Yum!

When I got the recipe I told my friends I would give them a tin full to try also.  After trying it, I didn't want to share but my friends are glad I did.  Best part of all though is that it's relatively low in calories and fat so I don't feel so guilty when eating it

I was hoping this would taste like the dip I recently had at a restaurant.  I figured with all the cheese in the recipe that it would be creamy but the spinach seemed to over power the taste rest of the ingredients and it wasn't very creamy.

I used artichoke bottoms because sometimes the hearts have a "woody" texture.  It turned out great!   I served it with a baguette that had been sliced, brushed with a touch of olive oil then put under the broiler to "crust up".  Great for parties.  I will definitely make this again.

I used an 8 oz box of softened cream cheese in place of the 1/3 cup heavy cream.  I chopped the artichoke hearts in the blender so they wouldn't be too chunky.  I also added a little shredded mozzarella on top of the dip before baking.  For a large gathering, I'd recommend doubling the recipe.  I made it the night before and baked it for about 45 min at 325 degrees for a double batch.

Good stuff ... 
I cooked and drained fresh spinach.
I would add more cream cheese and/or sour cream next time to give it a little more creamy/make it a little less dense with ingredients.

I make this all the time. I don't bother with the food processor or with mixing things in two different bowls and combining them later.  I just put everything in one small casserole dish (9x13 dish seems WAY too big) and stir everything after 10 minutes in the oven.  Also, I just use slightly over 1/2 cup of parmesan instead of a mixture of parm and Romano, plus I usually increase the garlic drastically (and add garlic powder).  I used to always make pita chips for this, but I've discovered I like it with tortilla chips right out of the bag even more!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious recipe! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and added a teensy bit more garlic than called for! It was fabulous! Got some pita chips to go with it, and am saving it for SuperBowl Sunday tomorrow, I did snag a little taste though.

Very easy to make I sub the heavy cream with 1% milk.  It was great. It does need a kick to it if you like, I might add pepper next time.  A keeper. One note I dont own a food processor and used my immersion blender and that worked fine.

This was every bit as delicious as the previous reviewers said it was.  The changes I made were to add some bacon pieces, 4oz of cream cheese and sub Italian 5 cheese blend for all but the mozzarella.  I had some fresh spinach I wanted to use up, so I sauteed it with the garlic in a little butter instead of using frozen.  Also, I did not bother with the food processor, just chopped up the artichokes and stirred everything together.  Topped with chopped tomato after baking.  It was easy and we will be making it often.  Thanks!

I made this for my New Year's Eve party. It did come out pretty good but not as cheesey as I would have liked. I did take some of the great suggestions from my fellow reviewers however. I did increase the garlic to one tablespoon and that really gave it some pop. I also added 4 oz. of cream cheese. Next time I will add 8 oz. f cream cheese instead. I also added 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice and about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt too. I look forward to making this again! Thank you Sherri for contributing this great recipe!

I added more garlic and did more cream cheese and less sour cream. Served with "everything" crackers. It was a hit. I used a stone baking pan and it stayed warm for about 30 mins! A big HIT!

I've made this dip at least three times. I follow the recipe to the letter and it always comes out wonderfully. It's a family favorite and I like to make when we all get together for special occasions.

I reduced the serving size from 16 to 8 and my husband and I devoured it in one night.  It was actually our dinner! I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted a mixture of regular milk and butter.  Since the size was reduced to 8, I used 1/4 cup of milk and about 2  1/2tbsps. of cooled melted butter. Also, I didn't have grated Romano cheese.  I substituted that with about 1 1/2 cups of shredded 'pizza' cheese which included shredded moz, provolone and romano! When mixing all the ingredients it appears thick but after cooking it loosens.  Cook the stated time (20 to 25 mins.) then top with extra shredded pizza cheese and turn the broiler on high to brown.  So so good.

Very good, but didn't seem to have quite as much flavor as restaurant tips. Might only need more salt or something simple like that.

I made this dish for a work event in the crock pot. Delish! The only thing I needed to do was add salt and pepper for flavor.  It did come out thicker than I wanted (I think b/c I left it in the crock pot too long), but with the addition of a little cream, I was able to take the leftovers and stuff them in a chicken breast for another delicious meal.

This is great. I used an 8oz cream cheese in place of creamer, added chopped tomato. Next time I would not put anything in the food processor. Instead chop up the artichokes and mix it all together. I would also recommend topping it with cheese so that I can get golden brown. We are this with croutinis and it was delicious. Looking forward to the leftovers.

I was looking for a base recipe and this came in very handy. 

I added and changed a lot so I won't add that all here, but fantastic for what I needed. Very versatile. 

My husband came home from work at 230am and ate the entire thing.

This is really good.   Everyone loved the garlic (I added extra...1 TBSN).  1 cream cheese block in place of the sour cream.  Added a little chicken stock to thin it out.  Extra cheese on top...I told someone to help her self to the left overs and she took it all after a Christmas party.

I made this with some modifications and absolutely loved it! I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream (same amount), used only parmesan and mozzarella, and added a few shakes of nutmeg; all baked in an 8x8 for an extra 5 minutes or so. I garnished it with parsley and long pieces of green onion to make it look like a little swamp so it could be served as "Dagobah Dip" for a Star Wars party! The picture also features a baked tortilla chip shaped like Yoda. This dip is thick and definitely needs a sturdy chip or bread!

This is always a hit! I've had people who don't like spinach &/or artichokes coming back for more. It goes great with pita or tortilla chips. The couple of adjustments I made: added a pinch of nutmeg & an 8oz package of cream cheese.

This dip is excellent! A keeper. I followed the suggestion of using a smaller pan to bake it so I used a round 8 inch round baking pan. I also baked it for a full 30 minutes and kept checking after 20 minutes for golden browning of the edges...it was DELICIOUS! I added a pinch of pepper and a pinch of salt but I think I will add a bit more salt to taste. I did not have minced garlic so I used one medium sized garlic clove and chopped it along with the artichoke and cheeses.

The flavor was ok, but really needed salt.  Also, I feel the cream was a mistake - mine separated out in a watery and cheesy mess.  Will keep looking for a good hot spinach dip without cream cheese.

I make this in the crock pot and it comes out much creamier. It takes a long time that way but I like it better. Also I sub the fat free versions of the cheeses and it's still AMAZING.

Awesome 
My family loves it but I changed it a little. 1/4  cup heavy cream 1/3 cup sour cream 1/3 cream cheese.
This is also good if you make a head and freeze it. Made it a week ahead for my husband birthday and was great.

Everyone loved this. I kind of threw everything into the foodprocessor so maybe it was a little over-processed. I used fresh spinach and plain greek yogourt instead of the sour cream/heavy cream. I halved the recipe.

I did tweak this a little bit. No heavy cream, cream cheese instead. Next time I will try both together. All in all, it turned out well :)

Seriously delicious and everyone loves it!  Definitely beats any cold spinach dip.  I added more mozz cheese and bit more sour cream.  Really easy and really tasty!  Serve with all natural (lower sodium) organic chips or water crackers to showcase the dip.

I made this for a NYE's party and everyone liked it.  The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is that it was not as creamy and spreadable as I would have liked. I would probably add 25% more heavy cream and sour cream.  Despite the dryness, it had great flavor!

So good, just don't make the same mistake I did, I used the food processer too long and almonst pureed the artichoke, it made it a little mushy, but had I not made the error, it would have turned out great :)

I made this recipe twice within a couple of weeks and it turned out differently both times. The first time, I thawed and drained the spinach just as instructed and it turned out SO TASTY! It was bubbly and thick!  The second time, I forgot to thaw my spinach and popped it in the microwave for a couple of minutes then just mixed it right in. I did not take the time to drain it and the dip turned out a little too watery for my tastes.  Make sure you THAW AND DRAIN your SPINACH!   Great, easy recipe overall and I will definitely be using this in the future!

Great recipe! Doubled the recipe for a party app.  Also, added 2 blocks of cream cheese.  The grocery store was out of the normal artichoke hearts, so I ended up using marinated artichokes from the mexican food aisle.  I thought the recipe was great - next time though I will increase the amount a sharp cheese, either asiago or parm for a bit more bite.

I use cream cheese instead of the heavy cream, because I usually have cream cheese in the fridge already. Also, I just use an Italian shredded cheese blend for all of the cheeses, tastes great and is less to buy! I have had only rave reviews from this recipe, a must try!

my boyfriend told me that this recipe is just as good as our favorite restaurant spinach artichoke dip. a high compliment since we have to get it every time we go to that restaurant. i use fat free or reduced fat sour cream. just a little skim milk to thin it out. and pizza blend shredded cheese. i usually only make enough for two of us in a little ramekin and it turns out really good. bake your own tortilla chips to go with it and it's even better!

Spinach overload. It was incredibly thick and quite bland. Added cream cheese to try to salvage it but it still seemed to be missing something.

I made this for a potluck and it did disappear quickly, but quite frankly I didn't like it at all. I followed the recipe exactly (for once), and it looked just like I thought it would, but I just didn't like it. Can't quite put my finger on why, but maybe it's just me since quite a few other people enjoyed it.

Very tasty, and disappeared fast! Added two cloves garlic. It was a bit runny, perhaps because I used fresh spinach, blanched, drained and chopped.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party because the reviews stated that this recipe tasted like restaurant quality dip.  I DID NOT have the same luck with this recipe.  Mine turned out dry and anything but creamy.  Wish I knew what went wrong because I really enjoy this kind of dip! I guess I will keep trying.

This is great if you like the flavor of hot spinach.  I needed to add quite a lot more garlic to this one. I did like the overall recipe and will be using it again

I loved this dip!  Tastes like the kind used as an appetizer in restaurants.  I made a huge batch and all of it went.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!!

Amazing! I doubled this recipe for a party at work and it was a HIT!!  I didn't have much time to prepare it, so I purchased the cheeses and one bag of mixed italian cheese (with romano, parmesian, etc) and one bag of straight mozzarella cheese and it worked great!

I have made this dip 3 times now and it is always delicious! In place of heavy cream I used some cream cheese and mayo. This is always a hit and is great for football season.

I made this for Easter with the family. It was gone within 30 minutes and I dont have a large family. The only modification that I made was that I added about a tablespoon (give or take) of olive oil.

I made it after reading all the good reviews about it. It turned out absolutely great!Everybody liked it and I got many requests for the recipe. The only con I felt about this dish is that it's a bit too heavy with all the cheeses. Not a good choice for weight watchers.

I love spinach artichoke dip.  I sub'd cream cheese for romano.  Also added 1/4c mayo.  Used fresh spinach.  Very creamy and yummy!  I like to spread it over pizza dough and top with mozarrella +/- parmesan.  It's a keeper.

I did the following and it turned out great:  Added about half a block of cream cheese and beat it with the sour cream, along with about half a jar of alfredo sauce.  It was delicious and thick and creamy.  It may be just fine with the sour cream and heavy cream, but I took the advice of some other reviews and decided to make it a little creamier.  Goes great with tortilla chips, crackers, or bread!

Great recipe and very easy.  I tried a blender and it did not work at all (maybe I have a bad blender).  I didn't have a food processor so I used a mini-chop and that worked perfectly!  I doubled the recipe and put it in the fridge until right before the party.  It took a little while longer to cook (about 35 minutes), maybe because it was in the fridge or maybe because I doubled the batch.  Regardless, the recipe went over great!  We had about 15 people and it was almost gone by the end of the evening. I will definitely be making this again!!

It has become my signature dish!!  Relatively easy to make - I find it easiest to make ahead and finish baking when I arrive at the party. I also use sternos to keep it warm.  What a hit!

I am, as well as many of the family, huge fans of artichoke dips. Little worried at about this when making it. I doubled or tripled the amount of garlic, we are all garlic lovers, bit also added a little garlic salt to the top.....as well as using 3 cans of hearts and few leaves. WE ALL RAVED!!! This is now etched into the "Tradition" book. We used Lays chips instead, maybe because of the salt, but I am truly amazed at this creation. I criticize ever S/A dip I eat, and this was amazing!! Make it your own, within moderation, and see for yourself! Thanks for sharing this, What do you think about adding crab to the mix?!? Happy Eating!

This was a big hit. Before baking it seemed a little dry. (This could have been due to my distraction and not following exact measurements.) I added a little mayo to moisten it up and sprinkled mozzarella and parmesan cheese on top before baking. It came out fantastic. Everyone loved it. One of the comments I heard was, "This is better than the spinach and artichoke dip at TGIF."

My boyfriend and I just loved this dip. Every time we go out to a restaurant which is most of the time, we always ask for the artichoke spinach dip. And making this dip at home beat most of those restaurants. Great recipe my only comment was I had to leave mine in for more than the recommended time. Yet over all it was wonderful and filling as a snack

I wanted to like this, but I found that it was just ok. Next time I might use 1/4 of the spinach and no roasted garlic!? (the spinach overpowered the garlic, so I thought it was a waste of time - and I LOVE garlic). Maybe I'll just use more  garlic and less spinach... we'll have to see.

This dip is perfect!! I made it for a game night with some friedns and now they beg me to make it for any occassion! I do chnage it up a little though. Instead of the cream I add cream cheese so its a little thicker. I also throw in a coulple of dashes of red pepper flakes, gives it a nice little kick in every other bite!!

Delicious!  First time I have tried making a hot dip receipe and I would recommend this one to anyone. As I was mixing everything together I realized it was a bit dry.  No worries, you can adjust the consistancy for a creamier dip by adding more sour cream.  Enjoy, ya'll won't be disappointed.

This recipe is awesome...I made this recipe for my brother's graduation party...needless to say with in the 1st half hour it was gone... and guests were asking for the recipe...I did take the advice of other reviewers who suggested to chop the artichokes instead of putting it in the blender... I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of minced garlic...I used a 6x9 baking dish...once i spoon in the mixture and flattened it out I sprinkled on extra Parmesan & Mozzarella cheese...This recipe was supper easy to make and could be made when company comes unexpectantly granted you have the ingredients on hand...Thank you for such a great recipe Sherri D!

I made this for a family get together, and although myself, my children, and brother in law liked it - my husband and mother in law just said it was just alright.  The dip in the restaraunts is better, but this is still pretty good.

Made this one about a year ago for a party...I was expecting big things from this recipe and I thought it was lacking. It seemed all I could taste was the spinach! I have found some different artichoke and spinach dips and will definately try them! Didn't care for this one too much, sorry!

This is the best spinach and artichooke dip I've made or had in a restaurant!  I doubled the cheese to make it extra cheesy, and it really was delicious.  I made it for a party, and it was COMPLETELY gone!

This is easily the best artichoke dip recipe I have ever tried & I have tried almost all of 'em! This rivals the artichoke spinach dips served at restaurants. My husband LOVES it & everyone I've served it to does as well.

This was delicious!!!  I didn't have any romano, so I just increased the parm and it was still great. I'm a big fan of garlic so I put about double the amount in the recipe. I'll make it for every holiday / gathering that we have from now on.  yum!

Good recipe....not great.  Maybe no one was really in the mood for spinach dip the night I made it. Had 3/4 of it left over and decided to use it as a filling for a calzone the next day.  Used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site and made one huge calzone!  No leftovers with this idea!

This was delicious, but had too much spinach for our tastes.  Next time, we will use maybe half the spinach.  It was overpowering to the point where I could barely taste the other flavors.  I love spinach, so it turned out great, though, but I'd prefer to let the other tastes come through more...  I followed recipe exactly except I used a blend of mozzarella, romano, provolone, and asiago instead of just mozzarella, and because I have an old blender that wouldn't blend the artichokes and cheese without liquid, I added the cream to the blender instead of mixing in afterwards.  Good recipe, thank you!

This dip is soooo much better than the cream cheese and/or mayo versions. This is the only recipe I'll use in the future. Next time I will add a little more cream- it was a little dry. Could be because I added an additional cup of cheese on top and baked until that layer was browned. Yummm!

This dip is a true knockout! When I prepare this dip for a party or holiday gathering people stand around the dip chatting and eating until it is all gone. The VERY BEST variation of the recipe I have ever made!

I wasn't planning on adding the mozzarella, but after tasting it without, it was just missing so much flavor that I went ahead and tossed some in there.  I also only used about 1/2 the box of spinach because I was afraid 10 oz. would over power  (especially since I already felt like there was too many artichokes).  I added some garlic powder, salt and pepper and used light mayo instead of sour cream.  I think next time I will definitley use sour cream though, I think that's JUST what this recipe was missing (I just hate a recipe where you can taste the sour cream and was afraid it would happen with this).  I'm bringing some in to work tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes...it's a tought crowd!

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  It lacked taste.  I prefer the recipe that uses mayonnaise.

I was excited to try this recipe after reading the rave reviews .... I was very disappointed, while the flavor was good, it was very dry - I had expected the cheeses to melt together and get real gooey.  Mine did not, the cheeses all got soft but never melted together. Not sure I would try this recipe again.

very good.  I used the food processor for the hard cheese and garlic but I hand chopped the artichokes because I like big chunks of artichoke and I can sort out the hard leaves that are some times on the canned artichokes.  I made it 3 times (3 different events) the first weekend I tried it.  Yummy!!

I don't 'get' all the rave reviews of this recipe.  It needed at least 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, as it was bland.  I didn't like it with chips at all, crackers were OK, but toasted garlic bread probably would have helped the taste best.  I will use this as a base to come up with my own variation because it was not creamy at all and I kept it warm the whole time.

I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with the end result.  It wasn't as flavorful or cheesy as I would have liked but I did use asiago cheese instead of the called for romano.  Maybe next time!

I absolutely LOVE this dip.  It's quick and easy and every one I make it for LOVES it.  I've given out this recipe more than any other.  It's a real fave of our family and friends, I make it for pretty much every dinner party we have.  Yummy!

This was good but I thought it would be more like the restaurant dip I had. Maybe it was a bit too sour and not creamy enough. Anyway, not bad.

Next time I'll only use half the artichokes....I don't like them all that much. My husband has been asking when I'm going to make this again. He ate half the pan for his dinner! He loved it.

I misplaced my printed version of this recipe and had to contact one of the people I passed it on to to get it back!  I've used both the marinated and unmarinated artichoke hearts and everyone loved it both ways!  I served it at Christmas and one woman who normally doesn't eat much, plopped in front of the dish and cleaned out our tortilla chip bowl.  To top that off, I e-mailed the recipe to another friend, and when we went there for New Year's, guess what she served...!!!  It's been pretty much a party staple ever since.  Thanks!!!

It's a major hit - I made it once, and now it's requested by my friends.  I've tried a few similar recipes and this is the best one I've found.  As another "reviewer" noted, don't use marinated artichokes in the jar ... use canned.  Also, I liked it better when I began adding 2 cups (1 bag) shredded Monterey Jack cheese.

I made this for Superbowl Sunday and everyone enjoyed it.  So simple to make, I used a handheld electric food grinder to mix the artichokes instead of a blender so clean-up was a snap.  A few of my guests told me that this dip tasted as good as or better than the restaurant Friday's.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really easy and delicious!  You can also make it a day ahead of time and pop it in the microwave to serve.

I grated my own cheese which took the most time overall to prepare this dish.  Everyone really enjoyed the dish.
