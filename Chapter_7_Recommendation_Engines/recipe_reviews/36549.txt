Excellent - I've been searching for ever for a honey vinaigrette to match the one at my favorite restaurant; this one finally does it.
The first time I made this the garlic taste was too sharp, so now I add some salt to the minced garlic and crush them together with the side of my knife on the cutting board to make more of a paste.  This mellows the garlic a bit and gives the dressing a smoother consistency.  I also mix the honey, apple cider vinegar and garlic together first, then add the oil while whisking constantly (I think this is called maing an 'emulsion') - this keeps the oil from separating from the other ingredients when the dressing sits.

My mom thought I was nuts when I started raving about this dressing.  Then I made some to put on a tortellin and spinach salad (also from this site).  She was in love.  The dressing is super easy and I always have the ingredients on hand.  You do have to let it sit for at least 45 minutes though, I shook it frequently during that time.  It helps the honey to disolve.

I love this dressing!  I love how simple it is to make and it contains ingredients that I always have on hand.  You definately have to let it sit for a while before serving so the ingredients can come together and blend.

Excellent!!!  I added a little extra apple cider vinegar (1/2 cup instead of 1/3 cup).  My husband loved it too.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over.  Thanks Dawn!

A favorite dressing but I add a small spoon of Dijon & tiny bit of salt & pepper. I make this most every week in mini processor to make creamy. Process all then drizzle in the oil. Pour into old cruet & makes me happy. Good on salads with chicken or with fruit. Also a good dipping sauce. Make the day before.

I use to have a sweet dressing that I loved, but somehow lost it.  When I came upon this recipe - I was hoping it would be delicious since it used honey, rather than sugar.  I'm soooo excited because this recipe is absolutely perfect and couldn't be simpler.  One tip - I would use 1 more garlic clove, unless your cloves are extra big.

This dressing is yummy. I didn't feel like measuring out the ingredients, so I just guessed, but it's super hard to mess it up! Just depends on your taste. I just used an old salsa jar that I had washed out to shake it up. Very easy...thanks!

I found this vinaigrette to be very bland even with 2 garlic cloves. I would not make again.

An excellent and very easy dressing!  I used fresh lettuce from my garden with some onion, carrots and a little ribeye steak I had left over.  With a few mushrooms it would have been perfect!  I mixed mine in the blender and hit the blend button a couple times while I was waiting the 45 minutes and it was super.

Five star rating on this one! My boyfriend said he was putting it on his list of favorite things I have made. Easy and delicious. My only suggestion would be to add more garlic for a stronger garlic flavor. I did because we LOVE garlic in our house.

Very good. I used Extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Next time I will try vegetable oil as I found it heavy in the oil taste. I also will add more honey. Overall a great vinaigrette.

It's great as is but I like to add more honey because I have a sweet tooth. It is great over a salad made with spinach, tomatoes, julienne apples, cranberries, gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts.

Yum yum yum! This has become my daily salad dressing. I make a week's worth in a jar and just stick it in the fridge. It is definitely better after it's been sitting for a while. I do a couple things differently, though. I only use about half the oil. I like my dressing really vinegary and I think vinaigrettes usually have too much oil in them anyway. I add a pinch of salt which really brings out the flavors. Also I use jarred garlic since it has a milder taste. If I do use fresh, I don't put as much in because it's too strong. Overall, great dressing!

not good.  Let it sit overnight, and it still only tasted like oil.  Added tons more vinegar and honey, which helped, but still no garlic flavor.   It just wasnt' for me.

Awesome dressing recipe! I did make some changes to the recipe though. Instead of vegetable oil I used EVOO, I also used a mix of Apple cider and rice wine vinegar (2 parts apple cider to 1 part rice wine). Finally added some fresh ground black pepper (couple grinds). I was amazed on how simple and delicious this turned out!

Good but made a few minor changes.  Used garlic powder (that's all I had), added a little extra cider and honey and added salt, pepper and Italian seasoning to taste.  Husband loved it!
update:  try reducing oil to 3/4 cup.

I scaled the recipe to make 12 servings, but the serving sizes as listed are actually 3 tbsp rather than the traditional 2 tbsp. I also added a pinch of salt and fresh black pepper. Not bad in flavor (very sweet) but I didn't get much garlic from it. It *definitely* improves with time, so I'd recommend making it the night before you intend to serve it. I will make this again with considerably less oil, as the oil adds more calories than it does flavor (even if you use something more pungent like olive oil), and a lot more garlic.

I thought this was pretty good. I made it exactly as written. It's pretty simple, but the sweetness really made a difference. Unfortunately, I could hardly taste any garlic (which I like), because my "2 cloves" were not very big. I might not make this again, but in a pinch, it's worth knowing about.

I added a bit more honey and it was very good. It got better the longer it sat in the fridge. Good alternative for those who don't like a strong vinegar flavoured dressing.

A winner!! I did add some salt and pepper, but otherwise I made it just as the recipe states.  I served this on baby romaine with shaved asiago and toasted almond slices. Everyone went back for seconds (and thirds)!

Ugh, not quite sure what happened when I made this vinaigrette, but it tasted awful. Mixed it with a basic carrot, celery, cucumber and apple salad, would have been great but it tasted excessively oily and the honey seemed to make it too tangy. Didn't substitute any ingredients at all.

I don't like giving negative ratings, because this is food and everyone's palate is different.  However my palate didn't care too much for this recipe. I tasted the oil and not enough seasoning

We are watching sugar consumption in our household, which is why I tried this honey sweetened vinaigrette.  I served the dressing over a spring blend of lettuces, and found the flavor of the dressing to compliment delicate lettuces a great deal.  This was a great option that was simple and didn't overpower the flavors of the salad itself.

Best dressing I have made or purchased in a very very long time. Easy & had all ingredients on hand.  Making ahead of time is a must so flavors can meld. Simply delicious!!

Quick. Easy. For Christmas dinner the salad got many reviews.  It was light but flavorful. Not too sweet and not too tart like some vinaigrettes can be. Nicely balanced. I added it to mixed greens (including spinach), carrots, mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, cucumbers, finely shredded cheddar jack cheese and croutons.

Great dressing... played around with the ingredient amounts a little. I upped the vinegar and garlic. Now mine has a bit of a bite. Overall, great dressing.

This tasted like straight vinegar as it was prepared according to the recipe.  I added extra garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano to balance out that flavor.

Great dressing and I always have those ingredients around. I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup sunflower oil to give it a richer taste. My husband loved it!

Killer!  Modified only minor calculation - used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup vinegar.  Threw all ingredients into my BULLET to blend perfectly.  Great over chop salads: iceberg lettuce, corn, tomato and heart of palm.  LOVE IT... will become a "staple" vinaigrette.

With just four simple ingredients I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Loved it with spinach salad! It definitely needs time for the flavors to combine. It's a bit harsh fresh. I made it 2 days before Thanksgiving dinner and everyone complimented the flavor. I think this is something I'll crave!

This is fabulous!  I've made it a couple of times now and have since modified it a bit (just personal preference and experimentation...great as written).  I add a TBSP of dijon mustard, coarse ground pepper and sea salt, fresh parsley from my garden, combo of olive oil and coconut oil (healthier), combo of rice wine vinegar and cider vinegar. I also mix it in my food processor to help it emulsify. YUMMY!

My DH and I loved this dressing.  I doubled the garlic and used 1/2 cup each oil and vinegar to lighten it up a little bit.  The nutritional info for my version of this recipe for 2 Tbsp is 113 calories, 10 g fat, 56 mg sodium, and 6 g carbs.

This has a great flavor, although the fresh garlic made it too "hot" for my three year old.  My one problem was how oily it was.  Perhaps it's a good thing - but I found I wanted to eat more of it than I should, as I wouldn't normally eat spoonfuls of oil... Thanks for this recipe!

Great oil to vinegar ratio with just the right amount of sweetness. I did add a good amount of pepper and a few pinches of salt to give the dressing some more dimension, although it's definitely not a necessity. I didn't have honey, so I substituted agave, which still worked very well and I used olive oil instead of vegetable. I feel that this is a good recipe to play with (as long as you get the first 3 ingredients right). You can add fresh herbs to infuse in the oil, feta/parmesan/blue cheese, sundried tomatoes, dijon mustard, etc. Go wild!

YUM! Was looking to try out a different vinaigrette since I've been on a salad kick lately and was getting a little bored with my go-to mustard vinaigrette (also from this site and also very good!). I was also looking for something that used apple cider vinegar. 

This came out wonderful! I added a little more honey towards the end as I felt it was still a little too acidic. Per orkid419's suggestion, I also added a pinch of salt with the garlic and whisked in the oil. Came out lovely served over a romaine salad I had made. Trying it tomorrow for lunch with a spinach/fruit/blue cheese salad.

Since I ran out of balsalmic vinegar to use for my normal vinagrette I quickly scoured this site to find a vinigrette recipe for dinner. Since this recipe was a piece of cake I chose it because I was under a serious time limit. I wasn't expecting what I received from this recipe. Although it has little ingredients this recipe tastes like something out of a restaurant. I quickly replaced my balsalmic recipe for this one. AMAZING! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I liked this, but it didn't have enough flavour. It tasted just a bit too oily. If I make again, I will cut the oil bye 1/4 or half and keep the other ingredients the same.

Very good dressing! It was super simple and I had all the ingredients on hand. I might try adding some tarragon and dijon mustard to it next time to see if I can get it closer to tasting like OB's mustard vinaigrette. Thanks!

Spur of the moment, I thought, "A honey vinaigrette sounds good." and then found this recipe.  I used olive oil and decreased it just a bit for personal taste.  I also added a pinch of salt, which I think really brought out all the flavors.  Served it with mixed green, apple, crumbled goat cheese & walnut salad.  It was perfect!

Our new favorite dressing. Can't believe how easy and how few ingredients are in it. I usually make a 1/2 batch using 2 T of both vinegar and honey. Goes super on a salad topped with strips of steak, blue cheese and sugared walnuts. YUM!

Really easy to put together & a lot less $$$ then buying pre-made dressing.  Hubby loved the strong garlic flavor, me...not so much.  Next time I'll add less garlic.  Still yummy on the greens.

I felt like this vinaigrette is just good, not great.  After reading the reviews I expected something more I guess.  This dressing didn't make my salad, my salad made the dressing.

Very tasty dressing BF hates honey but loves this dressing.  He asks me to make it all the time.  I add a little more garlic to it.  This does need to be made a few hours ahead of time to break down the sugar in the honey, and the flavors to blend well.  It keeps for about 2 weeks (if it lasts that long)

I used garlic powder cuz had no real garlic and added a bit of parsley cuz I like green spots in my dressings so I can see where I put it, other than that I followed the recipe with the very available ingredients. Thanks!

This recipe is delicious made according to recipe but has so much potential.  I love the flexibility this recipe allows for.  Will add this to my list of delicious homemade dressings to keep on hand.

This is so good, and it couldn't be easier to make. I think it's way better a day or two after making. I had this over mixed grains and a simple salad today, and I was eating the food of the gods!

Everyone loves this dressing.  I initially tried it because a friend doesn't eat anything with mustards in it and most easy vinaigrette recipes call for some Dijon.  This was a hit and easy.

I am addicted to this taste, (even though I am a hot and spicy kind of gal.) Used raw vinegar and olive oil and didn't find it bland, just a great delicate taste. I keep adding it to everything.

I found this dressing probably a year ago on here, and I need to thank you!  It is fantastic!  I add a little more garlic because I'm a big garlic fan, but I have received so many compliments on this dressing!  Thank you so much!

Thank you dawner for the great salad dressing.I did have to change the apple cider vinegar to a product called Salada vinegar as that's all I had but oh boy was it ever good.UPDATED:I tryed it with the apple cider and did not like it.If I had started with the apple cider then I probably wouldn't have made it again.

This salad dressing got GREAT reviews!  I used a healthy oil blend and reduced the amount a little bit, I used minced garlic from the jar and doubled that amount, and I added a pinch of salt.  I made it the night before, and I served it over a salad of mixed greens, sliced grape tomatoes, cucumbers, and sliced almonds.

Wonderful! Got Rave reviews from frieds and family. I used it on a normal tossed salad. The Salad went very fast! I added alot of Garlic and was generous with the honey and used rice vinegar which gave it a nice kick. Will definetly use again.

yummy as written, just wish it could be slightly healthier. i might try others' suggestions of 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup oil next time. served it on a salad of mixed greens, craisins, almonds and mandarin oranges, and it went perfectly.

I love Italian and Vinaigrette dressings, and this quick dressing is perfect for those nights you want a salad but have no dressing in the refrigerator.  In my opinion it tastes better than what you can buy in the store.  I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil.

One of my favorite salad dressings. I used 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup oil as someone else suggested and thought it was perfect. I poured this over baby spinach, sliced red and green peppers and cucumber. yum yum!!

a very nice change from the sweeter dressings I always use.  This was great on spinach with mushrooms and croutons.  The mixture of slightly sweet with the salt of the croutons was good.

I love how simple this dressing is. I definitely think the amount of oil used should be reduced!  I went half and half with the vinegar and oil, and added a little extra honey.  (Note:  I am a huge fan of vinegar, this advice might be too vinagery for some tastes).

This is an "ok" vinaigrette, not as flavorful as I had hoped. Will not be making again.

Excellent.  Well received by my guests who attended a luncheon.  I have passed this recipe to a number of people who are also now using it instead of store bought.

Wow. I just made this. I’ve never had luck with salad dressing before. Added a bit of salt and pepper and as one person recommended I put everything but the oil into a food processor. Mixed for a while then added oil in a stream. It came out smooth and rich tasting. I’ll keep this recipe  for sure !!!!

Following the suggestion of other reviewers, I doubled the garlic. Since this recipe uses vegetable oil (I used avocado oil) I was able to make this in my Vitamix (olive oil gets really bitter in a blender) and it turned out so smooth and emulsified it was downright creamy! We loved it and have already made it twice.

I think this recipe is a good starting point if you’re like me and needed general guidance as to what to use for a honey garlic vinaigrette. I had to improvise a little bit because I realized too late I was out of some things. So instead of ACV, I used red wine vinegar. And because I was low on veggie oil I used the 1/2c I had left plus a 1/2c olive oil. I saw someone else mentioned the lack of flavor, so I “jazzed” it up a bit and added salt, smoked black pepper, smoked paprika & a dash of red pepper flakes. Addiing those seasonings helped A LOT in making it not so bland. I’d recommend doing that if you find yours lacking taste as well!

This was delicious the first time I tried it, which was after letting it sit for about an hour.  However, when I had some the following day, the garlic taste was much too overpowering.  I couldn't even dilute it by adding more of the other ingredients.  I'm pretty new to cooking, but after some research I think it's because I used a garlic press instead of mincing the old-fashioned way.  Will try again using finely chopped garlic.

Made this tonight. Had all the makings for a salad but soooooo sick of ranch. Why did I ever buy bottled dressings??? Been making my own (salad dressings), for a few weeks now and they are so much better then store bought. This recipe is delish and will be a keeper. I did add a tablespoon of Dijon as another reviewer suggested. I love mustard so...took her advice. Thought it would add more flavor.

Delicious and simple,  I agree with other users juat a bit of mustard to even out the acidity.  I used mustard powder,  it didn't drastically alter the flavor,  juat mellow it out.

Decided on a simple salad and used this as the dressing. I did add 1/2C apple cider vinegar instead of 1/3C and also threw in an extra clove of garlic. I added about 1tsp of sugar too. I emulsified it with my Ninja too. Will def make again.

The recipe was an ok base-starter for a vinaigrette.  For some reason, all the ingredients tasted as if they floated on their own rather than blended.  It was only after I realized that the base was begging for celery salt and pepper that the flavors began to merge.  Once the tweaks were made, it also served well as a meat marinade.

A bit bland for my taste.  I cut the honey down to 1 tbl and added some dijon mustard.  Added a bit of crushed red pepper, salt and black pepper.  May need some fresh herbs as well.

I doubt I follow the recipe exactly as written, I just mix in the ingredients until I like the taste (and add Dijon mustard and pepper) but I love this recipe and eat it nearly every day on a salad.  Very light but lots of flavor.
