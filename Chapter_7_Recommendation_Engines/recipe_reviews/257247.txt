I had these for breakfast (right out of the oven) AND lunch (at room temp) today, and they were very tasty. I don't have a large (6 muffin) muffin tin, so I used ramekins instead.  It took about 11 minutes for the egg whites to set up, and then I turned the oven to broil and let them in an extra minute on broil before removing them to add the cheese, as runny egg whites freak me out! I used a fancy shredded Italian cheese blend that has provolone, mozzarella, asiago, romano and parmesan in it, as that's what I had on hand. I also just cooked the proscuitto in a pan on the stove top. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I put grape tomatoes with salt and basil  under eggs in each basket and put bacon on top of the cheese. Delicious!!!
