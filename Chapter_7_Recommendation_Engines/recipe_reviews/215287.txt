To solve the issue of having a "running" pie, Alton Brown suggests letting the apples draini(once you add the sugar) in a collendar for one hour then proceed with your recipe using the drained apples.  I did this and sure enough, no running or over liquid apple pie!

I have been using this recipe for 40 years...and my mother before that. Only difference I saw was we use 1 tsp of cinnamon and don't use the lemon juice....I may try that. We dot the top of the apples with butter before placing on the top crust. Then I sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. For those who are home crust makers (me for 39 years) I use these Betty Crocker crusts....only take a little of my whole wheat flour, spread on a board and roll the crusts just a little thinner...and people think I still make my own. Smile.

For the best results dot the top of the apples with butter before putting on the top crust.  Also, try using several different varities of apple, such as Golden Delicious, Gala, York etc. in the same pie.  It really adds depth of flavor. Sometimes,instead on lemon juice, I throw a handful of fresh cranberries on top of the apples to give it the tartness and flavor of fall.

I am 63 years old and have never made an apple pie without using the canned fruit pie filling.  I had 4 small Granny Smith and 2 large Jonathon apples on hand that needed to be used so I made the pie with those.  I followed the recipe exactly as originally posted, except I did use 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, because I love the flavor of brown sugar.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon/sugar on the top after giving it a light milk wash. This pie is fabulous and I highly recommend it to even the novice cook.  I doubt I will ever make an apple pie again without using this recipe.

I've made this pie for more years then I can say. It's requested of me at every outting. The flavor can't be beat. On top of this, I've used the Pillsbury pie crust ever since it was put on the market. Why go to all the trouble when this is just as good as homemade. I do tweek the recipe a bit and I know you'll find wonderful results with this. I put dabbs of butter on top of the apples before layering the top crust. Once the top crust is in place and crimped, I brush the top with egg yolk. You can either sprinkle with colored sugar or leave alone. The color of your pie will be a beautiful golden color. It doesn't change the flavor, but it sure enhances the appearance. Your pie will be the most beautiful around.

Very nice.  I blind baked the base crust, coated with egg white and baked another 5 minutes.  Added cranberries and walnuts to the filling.  Delish.  Base was nice and crunchy, not soggy as it sometimes gets with an apple pie.  Will make again next week for Thanksgiving.

I just made this for my husband and he loved it. I have to say the easy crust is perfect every time and I realized that whatever fruit I have around the house can easily turn into a delicious pie using this simple crust.

I've been getting rave reviews using this recipe. I apply an egg wash to the top crust before putting it in the oven so it looks nice and golden brown. I found the egg wash on another site; I beat 1 egg yolk with  1 tablespoon of milk and apply to the top crust.

I have been making this recipe for 51 years although I too dab the apples with butter before putting on the top crust.I also use more cinnamon, probably a tsp., plus nutmeg and a little allspice.  My Mom made this recipe from 1933 when she married till her death in 2002.  Of course we both make our own pie crusts, although the Pillsbury refrig. ones are very good and do save time. I put evaporated milk (brush it on) the crust before baking.  It also makes the crust a lucious color. Great recipe!!!

My husband loved this pie. I used my own homemade crust and as suggested by the other reviewers, I left out the lemon juice, put in a full teaspoon of cinnamon with dabs of butter on top of the apples before putting on the top crust. I was looking for a quick, basic apple pie recipe to use up some Granny Smith apples I had and this was perfect.

I don't even LIKE Apple pie, and I LOVED this!!! I don't know what makes this so amazing, but it's just perfect and received many compliments (including my friend who is a complete health nut and never eats pie) when I made it for Thanksgiving. It's light and tender and the crust is flaky...just all around amazing. Depending on how deep your pie dish it, I would recommend upping the apples to 8 cups and increasing the corresponding ingredients accordingly. Also, pouring excess liquid out of the mixture once the apples have been evenly coated will prevent sogginess, as will spooning the apples in with a slotted spoon. I did a lattice top and brushed it with egg wash and the color turned out nicely. I will use this recipe even without the Pillsbury crust, although the crust is so perfect if I'm in a hurry I can just use the Pillsbury crust. This recipe is a winner for sure!

This was a great classic apple pie recipe if you're in a rush. I used granny smith apples for more of a sweet tartness. I also changed the sugar combination slightly. I subbed 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/4 cup of the white sugar. After putting the top crust in place, I brushed a slightly beaten egg white over the top and sprinkled with 2 tsp. of sugar. Everyone LOVED this pie and I will be making it again for Thanksgiving.

This pie is awesome, I use a tsp. of Apple Pie spice, along with the other spices, I love this pie, thanks for sharing!!! For those of you that are having trouble with a runny pie. After it gets done cooking, leave it in the oven until it cools. It works for me EVERY TIME.

I always dot with butter and amp up the spices. I never peel the apples. Use a combo of braeburn, fuji or galas with granny smiths~ but I don't peel them! You can substitute the lemon juice for sherry and sprinkle about 1 tbs of cinnamon red-hot candies! They melt and everyone wonders what that secret ingredient is that makes the filling look reddish-pink! I always get raves for these changes!

This was my 3rd attempt at home baked apple pie, and the 2nd recipe I tried it with. I like this recipe much better than the other I used.

The first 2 tries were a bit of a letdown, having just tossed the raw apples & spices in the pie crust to bake. End result was a soupy mess with semi-burnt top crust and undercooked apples. 

By this attempt (and after reading some suggestions here) I sauteed the apples in a large skillet on the stove top before baking in the oven. This time there was no "apple soup" and the apples cooked thoroughly, tho maybe I sliced a little thin or cooked a too long on stovetop, since it was nearly applesauce. Even still, the flavor was amazing!

On the stovetop I added about a tbsp of butter and used a little extra lemon juice, and very gradually added flour to the skillet over medium heat to thicken the juice. The more thoroughly you cook the apples in the skillet, the shorter bake time needed in the oven (prevents burnt crust!). 

I think for the next pie, I'll make sure the apples are no less than 1/4" thick, shorten the cook time on the stovetop (no more than 10-15mins) and use a slightly higher heat.. I think that should do the trick!

To us these premade pie crusts just makes for a very thick crust so the reviewer who suggested rolling them thinner has the answer.  Nothing worse than a pie with  a thick crust.   Actually when I was taught how to make pies you were supposed to have the crust so thin you could see thru it.   This is a good basic recipe but much too sweet for us and also suggest you use only granny smith apples.

absolutely delicious!  I usually can not make an apple pie that tastes good, usually mine are not sweet enough or else too sweet, this was just right.  I used honey crisp apples, and sliced them very thin, I've had other times I didn't slice thin enough and ended up with a crunchy pie.  I did add just a tiny bit more sugar and it came out perfect! Finally  a recipe I feel comfortable with.... next time I may even attempt to make my own crusts!! wonderful recipe!! Thank you for submitting it!  I also made sure that I added the lemon juice!!

Great pie!  The only thing I did different was add cinnamon/sugar sprinkles to the top before baking. I also baked in a dark pan so it didn't take as long, so keep an eye on it if u don't use a glass pie pan!

Literally the best pie I've ever had! My family agreed. Super simple to make, only change I made was dotting the pie with butter before putting the top crust on.

We tried this one out prior to Thanksgiving.  It was wonderful!!  I dusted the crust with a sugar/cinn mixture prior to baking.  What a nice touch.  Will use this recipe from now on.

i didn't have any nutmeg or lemon so instead of lemon i used a little bit of freshly squeezed orange,  also i only put it in the oven for 50 minutes at 375 and it was i a little too brown so i'd put it in for 47 minutes next. Otherwise it was Great

We loved this pie! I did take Alton Brown's advice from his latest cookbook and cooked the filling in a skillet prior to baking. This kept 2 things from happening. First, it was not a runny filling so my bottom crust was done in the center of the pie and it was flaky. Second, and a bigger issue to me - I had no "empty crust dome". I had apples top crust to bottom crust. The flavor was spot on perfection for our family. Thank you for posting.

This pie is absolutely fantastic!!
I used the French Pastry pie crust recipe from this site.
I did add about 4 tablespoons of butter dabbed on the top of the apples before putting on the top crust. Also brushed with egg wash to make a beautiful golden appearance.

i also used granny smiths, braerburn apples.  best apples for baking for me. either one for apples or just one kind

I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for and I didn’t have lemon juice so I used lime juice instead. Very easy recipe and came out great!

I added an extra cup of apples to make my pie higher and a little extra flour to solidify the juices. Came out perfect. A real crowd pleasers.

We thought it was great. I do not bake! I had some left over pie crusts from a chicken pot pie and a gozillion apples, so I decided to give it a try. I was going to make Chef John's easy classic pie, but the link from the video goes to a different recipe. Luckily I found this recipe in the comments from that. The only thing I did differently was to egg-wash the crust before baking and bake at 375 for about 50 min (from Chef John video). Yummy!

This was the first apple pie I have ever made and I must say this recipe came out delicious. I only added tsp of the lemon and put in extra nutmeg. I will be using this again for the holidays.

I've made this at least twice. It's delicious. I found that my apples were very juicy and made the pie runny. The second time I made it, I used lemon powder instead of lemon juice. Problem solved. I found that it tastes even better the next day!
