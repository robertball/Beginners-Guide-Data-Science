Modified to be Gluten Free
- Rice Panko

Surprised that this didn't have a lot of punch in the flavor department. Everything was good, the GF panko bread crumbs worked out perfectly as a substitute.

Next round we will season the chicken a bit more when cooking.

Easy Peasy. Only addition is that I use an egg to dredge the chicken strips thru first so the cheese and Panko will adhere much better. Delicious

The recipe does not specify whether  to use grated or shredded Parmesan (big texture difference). I intended to use grated but realized after it was too late that I was out. I did have shredded though and after using that, I am certain grated is what the recipe submitter is wanting you to use. The flavor was excellent but the coating didn't stay on good.  Good recipe! Thanks for sharing!
