We really enjoyed this at our home. Please don't judge, but  I didn't have time to make dough. I had a Pillsbury french loaf that filled in nicely.  Instead of mustard I made 1000 island dressing, (mayo, ketchup, and pickle relish). The possibilities are endless, ham and cheese, Philly cheese-steak, Italian meats w/marinara, turkey w/ bacon and Caesar dressing.  .  .  The sky is the limit!  Thank you, NEHCTERG, for the wonderful recipe.

What a delicious recipe!  I used 1 Cup of rye flour and caraway seeds in the bread ingredients.  I LOVE ruben sandwiches and this was no exception!  It is a half-day project though and contains expensive ingredients.  Sometimes you just gotta splurge, though!

i love to make bread! this stuff is a big hit at my house. we like corn beef brisket. when i make it the left overs are for this bread. the only thing i changed is, i mix a little thousand island dressing in with the sauerkrat and layer cornbeef, then sauerkrat and then cheese. if  cheese on bottom it makes to soggy. great find! thanks lisa

I had been making this for years from an old recipe book i had. When I moved and couldn't find the book i searched high and low on st. patty's day for this! i was soooo happy to find it here! my family and i LOVE this and make it every march 17th; its so much better than the traditional bland corned beef and cabbage. i have graduated to making 2 or 3 at a time because we can never get enough!

We made this according to the directions the first time.  We liked the idea of the crust but it was a bit thicker and harder than we liked.  In the interests of time, the next time, I thawed a loaf of bread dough during the day in the refrigerator.  I let it rise a bit then rolled spread it out and added the corned beef, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut.  I did the same type of braid, spread with beaten egg and then baked it at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  

We used this recipe for a dip/sauce.  
    1/3 cup mayonnaise
    1 1/2 Tbsp ketchup
    1 1/2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
    1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
    Salt, to taste
    Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Great concept NEHCTERG but we like these slight changes.

This was so yummy. I did not make the bread from scratch. I used the Pilsbury French loaf. Yum and easy.

Fantastic use of leftover corned beef.  I did substitute 1c rye flour, but it was completely unnecessary.  The yellow mustard adds a great flavor and brightness to the bread.  I mixed some Thousand Island with hot cream horseradish and we dipped the sandwiches in that.  So very tasty!

Oh... my... goodness!!! I made this a bit ago and it was fantastic! Didn't change a single thing about it and it turned out wonderfully. My fiance ate nearly the whole thing in one sitting. I will definitely be making this again!

Everybody loved this recipe.  I didn't use the corned beef. Instead I used left over roast beef, mashed potatoes, corn and peas.  Made a gravy to dip it into.  It was a big hit

This was REALLY good! I will be making this often with other sandwich ingredients too. I substituted one cup of rye flour for one cup of the regular flour but you couldn't taste the rye.  I also skipped the egg on top. I make bread a lot so instead of the directions for step 1, I mixed the yeast, warm water (about 110-115 degrees) and sugar together and let it sit until it became frothy, about 5 min. Then I added it to the flour, salt, mustard and butter.  I mixed it together and then kneaded it in the Kitchenaid for 6 min.  I let it rise, covered with a towel, until doubled, for about an hour. Then I followed the rest of the directions starting with step 2.  I then mixed ketchup, mayo, pickle relish and horseradish together (like a spicy Thousand Island dressing)to dip the sandwich in. I wouldn't recommend putting it in with the sandwich stuff before cooking so it doesn't get soggy but it was the perfect dip. Great way to use left overs from St. Patrick's Day!

This was a hit with every member of the family.  I definitely took some liberties with the recipe.  I used the refrigerated french bread loaf and unrolled it to "load it".  On half of the loaf I used the ingredients stated with the exception of using Thousand Island Dressing instead of yellow mustard.  On the other half, I used the rest of our roast beef (sandwich meat) and coupled it with Russian dressing and American and cheddar cheese.  Both sides were totally devoured with many pleasant comments.  Thanks for posting!  Now I know what to do with our lunchmeat before it goes bad!

Excellent recipe! I made the "ham & cheese" variation that is mentioned in the intro and it was the first dish finished at our Sunday football party. Everyone (including the kids) loved it and asked that I make it for every gathering.

Made this recipe with one addition...since I always order reuben sandwiches with onions, I added thin sliced onions and some caramalized onions cooked with a bit of garlic...it was delicious.  I do feel that the crust was a lot of work and puffed pastry with a spreading of mustard would have been much easier and it will try it that way next time.  If you love a Reuben...this is well worth trying.

Love this recipe! Its great for one of those days that's a bit chilly, and you have an extra pair of hands to help with the prep work. I used the ham (leftovers) and cheese option, with sauerkraut. Its on my personal list for the future.

Very good my family loves Ruben so this was a nice twist.  Would suggest putting thousand island dressing in with the sourgrout as other suggest or having a dip.  Very good.

I wanted an easy, casual meal to serve to friends one afternoon, and ruebens seemed like a good choice.  I did a quick allrecipe search, though, in case there was a recipe above the norm.  This loaf was the PERFECT option.  I was able to do all the prep work in advance, bake it timed to guests arrival, and remain free from the kitchen once it was time to eat.  I will definitely make this again.  I knocked one star off because 1) I think it needs more filling (probably heavier on the meat for us) and 2) it really should be served with Thousand Island (or a dip of Thousand Island flavor)  Oh... and a little tip... use a pizza roller to cut the side strips for folding over the loaf.

I wish there was an option for 4-1/2 stars because I liked this recipe a lot and can see lots of variations on the theme.  This Reuben loaf was a bit dry for my taste, but I bet adding 1/2 cup of Thousand Island dressing to the kraut would do the trick.  The mustard in the dough is borderline genius and really adds to the flavor profile, I may double it the next time I make it.  I did sub 1 cup of white for rye flour and added caraway seeds for that bit of earthiness, which is highly recommended.     

I am eager to try this as a Buffalo chicken version with provolone or roast beef with sauteed onions and cheddar.

I just made this tonight with a bit of homemade corned beef and it was FANTASTIC! I thought the recipe was simple and did exactly what it called for. We have some leftover ham from Christmas and I know exactly what to do with it now.

This was VERY good and looked so pretty on the serving plate!  I cheated a little and let the bread machine do the kneading and rising, and when the dough was ready, I rolled it out and followed the recipe.  Dough was very easy to work with, and everyone liked it!  I would out of sauerkraut, so that was omitted.  I made homemade Thousand Island dressing (recipe from this site) into which to dip the slices of reuben loaf.  YUMMY!

I've raised 3 kids on this recipe.  We've varied it to suit the leftovers in the fridge.  Sweet Italian sausage, peppers and onions are my fav.  All you need to remember is that you need 1. Sauce 2. Meat & Cheese 3. Veggie topping.  Bavarian Sauerkraut is the best on the reuben.  I've used chicken and broccoli, ham and swiss and pork with a wonderful sweet pepper relish.  Possibilities are endless and once you pull it out of the oven everyone is impressed with how it looks.  Store bought dough works just as good and saves time.

I make this during the football season. Not everyone loves it, but if you like rueben sandwiches this is a great recipe and you can not beat the look sitting on a buffet. This recipe added mustard to the dough and my husband really liked that change.

Made it twice. I don't like yellow mustard so the first time I used spicy brown. The second time I used the yellow and found it works better with the dough. Nevertheless I love it.
