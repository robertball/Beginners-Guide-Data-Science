OMG, this is so good! I made it 2 nights in a row, and hubby already asked me to make it again this weekend. Shirataki noodles take some getting used to, but to those following keto, they are a welcome substitute for pasta. Make sure you follow the directions in this recipe on how to prepare them properly because simply taking them out of the bag and rinsing isn't enough. The flavors in this recipe are well-balanced and the shrimp is perfectly cooked. Even if you aren't keto, make this, and serve over regular noodles. You won't be sorry!

If you are thinking of making this recipe, I urge you to use anything other than Miracle Noodles as the recipe calls for.  This recipe was the first time I ever cooked or tasted them, and they were so unpalatable that I could not stomach this meal and had to throw it away without eating.  They didn't absorb much flavor and have a rubbery texture; not at all el dante at all.  I noticed the package instructs users to avoid using the noddles in spaghetti-style dishes because they aren't a good replacement for Italian noodles; which was my first sign this recipe would be a bust.  

Based on the time and money I wasted and then not even being able to eat the meal, I have to rate this as a 1-star recipe.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the sauce or shrimp, just don't use miracle noodles!

So much flavor! The shirataki noodles are not the same as real noodles, which you will miss. But they have zero calories and zero sodium so are well worth the substitution. Just get used to them as a unique thing, and donâ€™t mourn for pasta.

I am not on keto, so I cut the butter in half and doubled the wine and lemon. It was very very good.

I used more shallot, garlic, and lemon because you can never have too much of all that. I couldn't find those exact noodles so I opted for a rice based pad thai noodle and I liked it just fine.

I made this and it was great. However, I Spiralized yellow squash. But that was the only change.  It made sticking to this diet easier when there is good food.
