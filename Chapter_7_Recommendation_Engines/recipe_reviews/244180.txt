We really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't use the pita chips and I didn't toast the quinoa.  My husband loved it "as is" but I sprinkled Cajun seasoning on mine for a little kick.  I'm glad I didn't notice the other review or I probably wouldn't have tried it.  Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only difference is that I didn't have a jar of alfredo sauce so I made my own.   It did make a lot so I had a lot of leftovers.  I could probably cut the recipe in half for  4-5 people.  When you see quinoa in a recipe you think healthy,  But there is a lot of cheese and oil and butter so that erases the healthy part.  But it was very tasty.  I would make it again.

Overall not bad.  Cut Quinoa in half, doubled chicken.  Needs some spice.

We made this according to the recipe. If you love fettuccine Alfredo, but you are sick of fettuccine Alfredo, this is a great recipe to try. It makes a lot, though. We enjoyed it, and will be inserted it into our regular rotation.

Want to rate this fairly.  Was following recipe exactly until I
hit the alfredo sauce.  Didn't have anyso had to punt.  Substituted Barilla's 4 cheese sauce & used tomato soup instead of cream of chicken.  Not all the quinoa could fit if I wanted everything else to. Have about 2 cupsleft for another dish (fine with me!)  Makes a lot and was delicious!!  Will try it again usng the alfredo sauce,
