1. Hard to brown sausages with all those veggies in the way; I removed them to brown the sausages.

2. I worried there might not be enough liquid in the Instant Pot, but the tomato sauce and the veggies provided plenty.

As most other reviewers, veggies need to sauté longer and it’s impossible to brown the sausages with the veggies in the way. I browned them in a frying pan and put them back in the pot for pressure cooking. 
Overall a good recipe with a couple of tweaks!

Turned out great! Don’t add any extra water right before pressure cooking it as the tomato sauce will be all watery and thin.

My family loved this recipe.  Not fans of green peppers so added yellow, red and orange peppers.  Also used farmers sausage and it was delicious!

Used chicken sausage. Agree with reviewers that found it hard to brown sausage with veggies. Would remove veggies to brown sausages next time. Deglazed pot with red wine. Served over pasta.

This was beyond excellent! No changes!  Used mild Italian turkey links. Agree sautéing veggies took a bit longer. Took veggies out of pot to brown links and put all back in.  It was so good, the two of us ate the whole thing and we are not big eaters. Will definitely make again, will be perfect to make for company as well!

Made this with a mix of sweet and hot sausage. Hard to saute all those vegetables in the IP, had to remove them to brown the sausage,  then removed them from the pan and deglazed with the tomato sauce so I did not get the "burn" notice. Served on rice, makes plenty of sauce. Next time I will use all hot sausage and add some herbs and spices.

The times are way off! It took almost 15 min. To get the vegies tender. Then how are you supposed to brown the sausage when the pot is full of peppers and onions? It turned out good but poor timing.
