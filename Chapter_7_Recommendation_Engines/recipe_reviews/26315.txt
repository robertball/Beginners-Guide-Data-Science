This is a winner!  It is pretty easy to make and the cooking time isn't too long.  (The cooking time only lengthens if you are using a thicker dish.  Using a pan for tartes is good because you get a good piece of cake, but the thickness won't be too much.)  Be prepared for the sweetness of it because there is a lot of sugar in the cake.  Also, I would recommend refrigerating the cake for longer than 1 hour because the colder the cheesecake, the better it will taste and also, the easier it will be to get out of the pan.
 - I was able to make this recipe living in France, where they have no such thing as real cream cheese or real sour cream.  They have similiar variations which proved to be just fine.

I found this cheesecake to be way too sweet, and it had a really sweet aftertaste that finally went away after about 30 minutes. I think it was caused by the confectioners sugar. So if I try this again, I will omit the sour cream topping and use only white sugar in the cheesecake (and cut the sugar down to 1 and 1/4 cups max). Then I will put fresh blueberries on each slice right before serving. I also found that I had to bake it for almost an hour rather than the 25 minutes stated in the recipe. It hadn't set at all at that point.

This cheesecake was very good.  I was told by one person that it was the best they had ever eaten.  It is very sweet, but very tasty. Cooking times may vary as I had to bake mine about 7 minutes longer than suggested.

This term is cheesecake,not eggcake. If I wanted sweet scrambled eggs, I'd have looked for that recipe.

4 because it didn't have that strong creamcheese flavour I was expecting nevertheless it was good. I would make it again but I would add more cream cheese to the batter.  My boyfriend says it tastes more like a creamcheese pie. I also had to bake 30minutes more than the recipe recommeded. I was surprised because it says 30minutes. I didn't even make the sour cream topping because I didn't have time. I have a 15 month old baby so I wanted something that wouldn't take a lot of time.

Good, not great, but very easy to put together.  I, too, missed the creamcheese-y flavor, but suspected that might go to the light side with all the sour cream.  But it's still a good dish.

The cheesecake tasted absolutely fantastic, not as creamcheesy as others but still great. Unfortunately, be warned. If you read the instructions, you'll see that this certainly is not ready in 1 hour

Based on other reviews, I left out the powdered sugar in the batter so it wasn't too sweet, and added strawberries upon serving.  It did take closer to an hour to bake instead of the stated 25 minutes.  Everyone loved it!

I made a chocolate raspberry swirl. I put about a half cup of semisweet chocolate chips, 3 tbsp of raspberry preserve, and about 1/4 cup milk in a sauce pan to melt the chocolate. I  let it cool it a bit and then added it to the cheesecake. I used a butter knife to swirl in the chocolate. Then I baked it.

I thought it was just great as is. I did have to cook it for 45 minutes instead of the time stated. Also, I used a pre-made graham cracker crust and it was overflowing in the container. I would suggest making your own.

This was a disaster; I should have read the reviews.  Was looking for a small cheesecake  pie recipe for a store bought graham cracker crust for a small party.  I am out of town without a spring form pan and my recipes.  1st: it makes way too much for a 9 in pie plate.  The recipe was not specific by what it meant by a 9 in graham crust and the picture was misleading.  2nd:  it is way TOO SWEET and eggy.   This is not a cheese cake but more of a custard.  3rd:  the baking time was not even close.   It was still liquid at the end of the stated time.  I guess I will buy a cheesecake from the store since I am out of time.

It was a quick simple recipe to follow however I used carnation milk , sugar in the raw , 1 egg, no topping or confection sugar and cooked it for a bit longer. It’s good but next time I’ll use less sugar other than that it’s perfect thank you

I’m giving it four stars as I think the recipe creator really needs to address the sweetness of the pie and length of time cooking. I’m so glad I followed other reviewers’ advice. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and I baked it for 45 minutes at 350.

So easy to make and it was delicious.  The only thing I would change, next time, is adding the strawberry glaze. It was hard to spread on the berries, and I did not really feel it was needed, as the cheesecake itself was sweet enough. I will be making this a lot.

Delicious and much less time than a different recipe I’ve tried.  The baking time was longer than the recipe said but it worked out beautifully. This is a keeper recipe. Next time I may try a deep dish pie plate as the filling was nearly overflowing.

I did not care for this recipe. The only thing we could taste was the egg. I'll stick to the cheesecake recipe my mom has.
