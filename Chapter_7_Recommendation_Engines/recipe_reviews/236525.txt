There’s a little kick from the wasabi paste and a little crunch from the panko.  They’re definitely outside the box, but it was nice not having the “same ol', same ol'” deviled eggs.  Hubby said you can make these anytime!

Loved this recipe! I made these as an appetizer for an asian-flavor inspired dinner party.  Even the person who hates eggs ate these! I had to make a second batch so I could get some they were so popular. You can easily control how spicy these are by how much wasabi you put in. I like to sprinkle the tops with sesame and a few of the panko bread crumbs for a little extra texture on top. I'll definitely be making these again soon!

Loved the taste!  Easy eggs to prepare, they look great on a platter.  They will be a wonderful addition to an international banquet of foods!

I made this as given and thought it was terrific. Dry pan toasting your own sesame seeds gives the highest note to the aromatic quality that these have.  You need much less than the amount of sesame seeds given but this is hardly a complaint. Instead of getting out the decorating bag and metal tip I loaded the mixture (which I had blended using a potato masher) into a small zip baggie and cut off a corner.

Yummy!  Love the crunch of the toasted sesame seeds and gave it a really nice flavor.  Only used 1/4 cup of mayo but followed the recipe ingredients as listed except for the panko breadcrumbs - really don’t think you need them. Added 1/2 teas of dry ginger.  Perfection - just enough heat but not overpowering.

So good. Have made these several times and only get rave reviews. My boss really likes them. I make them for him pretty often. Happy boss, happy employee. 
Didn't change a thing. 
Thank you

I made this recipe and a regular one just in case the taste was too different. My family loved it! They said next time don’t bother with the regular recipe.

A nice tang and a nice kick to normal deviled eggs! I would suggest halving all ingredients except the eggs since I had plenty of paste leftover, but it was pretty good!

A good recipe. I made it a bit more spicy by adding additional wasabi to the mix. I also replaced the sesame seeds with some very finely sliced red onion which i marinated in rice wine vinegar with a pic of sugar. let sit about 30 minutes and drain. 
Togorashi is great to sprinkle on the finished eggs.

I often make deviled eggs with unique fillings as appetizers. This Japanese version pushed my crab-filled version from its number one spot. My guests loved them!

Very pleasant, w/ the soy taste leading.  I agree that a ½-tsp grated ginger, or even ground ginger, would widen the filling's taste profile; maybe even a dash of fish sauce and a hint less soy.

I've been banned from making regular deviled eggs. I'm only allowed to make this recipe for parties now.

I will definitely make it again. We love wasabi, poke, sashimi, sushi, and all things Japanese, but I did cut the seasonings--wasabi, shoyu, and mayo  in half. Our guests raved!

I made these for our Asian infused Christmas dinner. They were excellent. They were devoured within minutes and I made a double batch. The only thing I did different was to add more sesame seeds on the top! Thank you!

I made these for a ladies night get together one time. They were gone so fast I only got the one I tried before serving! Its a wonderful twist on the normal deviled egg that no one expects. I left out the wasabi paste because my grocery store doesn't carry it and added extra ginger.

Yummy.  Great twist on one of my fav foods.  I'll probably cut the sesame seeds to 1 Tbsp. next time as I felt they were a bit overwhelming.  Also I had to use wasabi powder rather than paste because I couldn't find it.  As a result I felt it didn't have that punch.  Will try to find it for the next time.
