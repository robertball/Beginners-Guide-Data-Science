This was my first time making bread and I thought this was going to be a disaster (I put in alot more that 6 cups of flour and the dough was still super sticky, the dough grew so much it spilled over the original bowl I put it in, even after I put the dough in the individual pans, it grew and grew and one of the pans had dough spilling over). However, the end result to my surprise was perfection! delicious fresh bread!!! Will put in a bit more honey next time. Definitely making this recipe again!

I halved this recipe and made one sandwich size loaf.  I used white whole wheat for 1 cup of the flour and used melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  I did have to add almost a full cup more flour to achieve the correct dough consistency, but it baked up nice and moist with a soft, but sturdy crumb.  I was happy that there is only the merest hint of sweetness.  Thank you, this will go in the recipe box.

I scaled this recipe to 12 servings (1 loaf), but I see that the previous reviewer scaled in half for one loaf.  I baked this in a 9x5 pan, and even after 1-1/2 hours on the final rise, it never did rise to 1" above the loaf pan.  Unfortunately, when I was putting the pan into the oven, it slipped out of my hand onto the oven rack and deflated, so I didn't take a picture.  However, I'm going to try this again, making half a recipe, and using one 9x5 pan.  If you're scaling to one loaf, you may want to consider an 8x4 loaf pan which should give you more height.  On the positive side, the dough really was easy to work with, and it tasted good, so I'll do an update soon on my next effort.

I havenâ€™t made bread in a long time so very worried how this was gong to turn out. This has to be the easiest and best bread I have made. It calls for 6 cups of Flour and I put in 6.5 cups and it was perfect. I also only made 2 loaves out of it but cut them into 4 to make smaller loaves. I picked this recipe because I wanted a honey recipe instead of sugar and it was beautiful. Thank you so much !

I agree with another poster. This was my first attempt at bread, and I had to use quite a bit more flour than the 6 that it calls for but in the directions it said it may take more so I just went with it. Also, the honey, though it sweetens the bread, doesnt offer a lot of honey taste which I guess i expected. All in all, this was a delicious bread! I will make it again

Very nice bread.  Hubs loved it even more than the Bagel Bread he has been raving about for 6 months . . .I guess he's found a new favorite!  I did have to add about 1/2 cup more flour, and instead of making this into 2 loaves like others did, I made it into 4.  It made for small loaves, but it's just the 2 of us so that works even better.  I used the bread machine but took it out after the dough cycle and baked on 350 for 40 minutes.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!
