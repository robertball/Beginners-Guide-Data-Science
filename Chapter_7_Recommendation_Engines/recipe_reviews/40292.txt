Men are not the only ones who love this dish!  My entire family, including the picky eaters loved it.

The only change I'd make would be to cook the dredged chicken in half olive oil and half butter first, removing it to a warm platter in a slow oven.  Proceed with the vegetables and sauce before reintroducing the chicken to the sauce to complete cooking the chicken through.  

I also used fat-free half and half and it was undetectable.  This sauce is flavorful on its own and doesn't even need the help.

I served this on a bed of angel hair pasta with a salad, sweet baby peas, and garlic bread.  It was an immediate hit that we'll be having again often.

Absolutely fantastic!  Following the reviews, I browned the chicken first, removed the chicken from the pan, and followed the rest of the steps, doubling the sauce.  I did omit the salami and salt and used red wine instead of the sherry (out of sherry).  I returned the chicken to the pan and simmered until it was the consistency I wanted.  I served with orzo, salad, and herbed toasted bread.  Next time, I will use a  low sodium broth (was a little salty even though I didn't add salt - and I love salty), and I will mix the orzo right in while it's simmering instead of cooking separetly.  Cant' wait to get at the leftovers!

This recipe is SO delicious.  However, you can easily reduce the amount of prociutto and salami to save money and reduce the saltiness.  (1/4 of the stated amount is perfect) Do not use any extra salt in this recipe and use a low salt chicken broth.  This recipe will impress anyone!

Family definitly liked this recipe very much.  Did not have any prosciutto on hand so made it without.  I cooked the chicken first in a mixture of half olive oil and butter.  Then put the chicken on an ironstone serving platter which I had previously microwaved for 3 mintues to get it warm.  This kept the chicken hot while I prepared the rest of the meal.  Will make this one again for sure.

All I can say is WOW!!!  It was the quality of a nice italian restaurant.  My daughter said it eased her craving for Olive Garden.  I altered a couple of steps...After dredging the chicken in seasoned flour I fried in oil.  Then I poured most of the oil out and cooked bacon and summer sausage (didn't have proscuito and salami).  then added onion garlic and red pepper. didn't have marinara so I crushed 3 whole canned tomatoes and some of the juice and a little tomatoe paste.  Added some italian seasoning and the rest of the ingredients and added the chicken breast to the sauce. Let that simmer and reduce and serve over vermicelli or and pasta....AWESOME!!!!

BTW....if sauce is still too thin...mix 2 tablespoons of corstarch with 1 tablespoon water.   add to the sauce little by little (folding well over medium high  heat) to the desired consistency.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. It tastes like something you would order at an Italian restaurant. I only used half of the hard salami. I'm glad I did because it was quite oily.

This was just amazing. I did not have any Sherry so I used white wine, I didn't have any mushrooms. Can't wait to try the recipe again with the mushrooms. Can't wait for the leftovers tonight. Thanks for adding this recipe!!

Delectable.. My sauce was a little runny but other than that.. excellant. I would have never thought of combining marinara and cream!

This recipe is sooo good. I had an italian friend tell me that this was the best chicken dish he had ever had in his life. I made just a few changes for personal taste only. I used about 8-10 chicken tenders instead of breast. I didn't add mushrooms because I don't care for them. I added about 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese to the sauce and use a full cup of marinara. Exellent Dish!!!

The sauce in this recipe was VERY good. Not at all bland like another reviewer stated. Followed recipe exactly, just doubled the sauce because I needed 5 breasts. The prosciutto and salami add incredible flavor. The sherry is not overpowering as long as you follow directions and reduce by half.   I do suggest using thinner chicken breasts. Mine were quite thick and took extra time to cook through and since they basically stew in the sauce for a bit they came out a little dry.  Will definitely be making this again!

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for 4 years!!! I finally made it and am so glad I did. It was scrumptious! However, I didn't have sherry so I used white wine and it turned out great. Served this over pasta. YUM!

We all loved it. I followed recommendations not to add salt and only used half the salami. I left out the mushrooms, since some family members have strong feelings about fungi. Since then I've made it without salami, and that's great, too. A real crowd-pleaser: savory and colorful.

This was a wonderful and tasty recipe. The sauce was to die for. The only change I made was eliminate the salami and used imported Italian proscuitto. (less salty and more tasty in my opinion). I also used home made marinara sauce from a local deli. winpaul from Ottawa, Canada.

This was good. I made it as written with only a few changes. I cooked the chicken in olive oil first, until browned on both sides. I removed the chicken and then added a bit more oil and cooked the onions, etc. I then added the chicken back to the pan for 5 min each side (my breasts were thick). I had no salami so I left that out, but otherwise, followed as written. Next time, I'll pound my breasts thin. Served with thin pasta. Wish the kids liked it....

We didn't love it and we didn't hate it. It tasted very very similar to a Chicken Marsala dish that I make - and I think we'll stick with the Marsala since it's a little easier and takes less ingrediants.

Very good! Somehow I ended up making enough sauce for an army though. I don't think its quite 5 star worthy, but it was definitely tasty and I will be making it again.

My husband and I agreed that this was a four but would be a five with the following additions.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using half and half instead of heavy cream and using and 8oz container of fresh mushrooms.  The next time I will either add fresh chunks or balls of mozzarella right before serving or top with a cheese with some bite like asiago.  The other thing that I will be sure to have on hand the next time because we were really wanting and craving it this time, was a nice crusty bread for the delicious sauce.  YUM!

This is so good. I didn't make any changes to the recipe ingrediants, only the way that I cooked it. I simply made the chicken first, set in a warm oven, then made the sauce and added back in at the end. My pan is not big enough to mix all the sauce ingrediants appropriatly with the chicken in it!

We loved this! Didn't have any salami so I did without but otherwise followed the recipe. It does seem like some of the steps could be doubled up in order to reduce prep time. I also had to add a little bit of butter before frying the chicken breasts because the pan was dry. Otherwise the taste was great and cannot wait to make it again for company.

loved this- easy to make
used chicken thighs, about a cup of sliced mushroom, just happened to have the 1/2 cup (or so) or sherry, marinara sauce had whole cherry tomato--it was great; cooked chicken and kept warm as others recommended and made sauce.  Just the sauce alone on a pasta would be great.  I'll double the sauce next time.

I have made this several times now, and as suggested by others, I used fat free half and half.  I also coked the chicken first, then added mushrooms, onions, garlic, prosciutto, and salami.  Everything else the same, and I served with orzo with basil and parmesean from this site...fabulous!

This recipe would probably be great as is but I did not have all the ingredients on hand. I didn't have any mushrooms so I added asparagus near the end so they didn't get mushy. Also, used wine instead of sherry and doubled the prosciutto instead of using salami. All 5 of us loved it (this is very rare for us)! Thanks!

Wonderful! I did not use the flour for dredging the chicken and use it as a low-carb recipe in this manner. Lovely!

As I sit here typing, I am eating leftovers of this fantastic dish.  This was the best chicken recipe I had used in a long time.  I did leave out the sherry because I didn't have any but even without it was superb.  I also have to disagree with some of the other reviews:  There definitely need to be more orange foods!

This is a great recipe, not too salty at all!  It is easy to prepare and is an easy way to dress up chicken breasts for company.

This dish has exceptional taste. We served it with aspargrass and mini cheese ravioli's. We dressed it up with a little grated parmesan cheese. A real keeper. G.W. in California

This recipe is superb and our friends loved it. I didn't change anything although I may try using light cream next time. I served it over baked spaghetti squash and I'd do that again. Not only does the squash have fewer calories, it goes so perfectly with the flavours of this recipe. This is a keeper!

Very tasty !!  I didn't  have prosciutto or salami so I used all I could find ......bologna and pepperoni.  Weird I know, but it still produced good flavors in the sauce.

I love this recipe! I've been making it for many years now. I tend to enjoy the chicken cut into small pieces, and I do add more cream to make a lighter and thicker sauce. I highly recommend this to anyone!

This was a tasty weeknight dinner. Didn't take too long to make and the sauce was delicious. With the right sides and some wine it could also be a romantic Italian weekend dinner as well. The only thing I added was a little bit of roux to thicken the sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

This was fantastic!  I doubled the sauce and did the chicken with thin sliced chicken breasts dipped in egg and flour mixed with Italian  bread crumbs.  I fried the chicken first in olive oil, removed and then made the sauce.  Added chicken right before serving.  Served over angel hair.  It was fantastic.  I used 3 lbs thin sliced chicken breasts, and double the sauce...1 jar sauce, and 1 cup plus  ff half and half ( instead of cream).  It was superb!  I have a lot left over for another meal of 4. ( served 4).  Thanks for such a GREAT recipe!  Highly recommend you try this

Tasted pretty good, but had to remove the mushrooms, salami, and proscutti while the chicken cooked because they started to burn while the chicken cooked.

This dish is simply fantastic!  I loved every minute of cooking it - takes some time, but it is so simple!   And the clean up was so easy - everything is cooked in one skillet!  This is a dish we will definitely be making for friends and family in the very near future.  I highly recommend serving it with some hearty bread - you'll want something to sop up the amazing sauce with!

I was not impressed by this meal at all & neither was my husband.  I followed the recipe exactly & the wine taste was so overwhelming that I couldnt taste any of the other ingredients.  Not to mention that once you add the marinara sauce, the whole thing turns this bright orange color that does not look the least bit appetizing.  I will never make it again.

Made this for company recently, they loved it too. Mine didn't look nearly as pretty as the picture, it came out really sort of brown and not at all appealing looking but the flavor more than made up for the taste. Next time I make this I really need to plan ahead better so I can do everything in the right order and don't have to make other components wait. I did leave out the salami and just used prosciutto as I don't like salami. Plus I didn't feel it needed all that extra fat.

Only reason I give it 4 stars is that you need a lot of sauce to get the full flavor, otherwise it's a little subtle.  I like sauce so I loved it.  My family isn't big on sauce so they thought it was good but maybe not worth the trouble.

I've made a lower calorie version of this which we loved...though I tried this original one first and froze a sample of the sauce to test against the low-calorie version. There was plenty of sauce and the calories are almost cut in half.

Original ingredient on left: substitution follows
Butter:   3 tbspn olive oil (did not add extra tspn butter at end)
Chicken: 6 chicken breasts (1 bag frozen Tyson chicken breasts)
Sherry: 1 oz apple cider vinegar + 3 oz water and 1/2 tspn vanilla extract
Mushrooms: 1 cup sliced
Onion: 1 large chopped
Marinara: 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
Prosciutto and Hard Salami: 3 oz instead of 4
Half & Half: Land O Lakes Fat Free half and half
Black Pepper: 1 tspn -- no extra salt

I browned the chicken in the oil, then removed from skillet. Cooked onions and mushrooms...added rest of sauce ingredients. Cooked abt 15 minutes. Added chicken, simmered till reduced to desired consistency.
Refrigerated overnight to allow flavors to marry. We couldn't tell a great deal of difference between the two.
I served with steamed spaghetti squash and grilled asparagus. YUMMY both ways. Will make over and over.

I might use low salt chicken broth next time, but otherwise it's a definite keeper!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I loved this, and so did my dad whose name happens to be David! :) I cooked the chicken first and then added the vegetables like another reviewer suggested, and I sort of eyeballed it with the salami and prosciutto. I attempted to pound out our extremely thick chicken breasts but it still took a little longer than I thought for them to cook all the way through. But that's ok. :) I got lazy and didn't add the parsley or butter at the end.

LOVE this Chicken recipe. So tasty. I did however cut the amount of salami and proscuitto in half on accident and am glad I did.  It was a salty dish which I really love and is great without the full amount of meats.

This was tasty, but odd at the same time.  My husband and I liked it more AFTER a few bites.  My 2 year old loved it...but then, he loves salami. ;o) I doubled the sauce recipe since a lot of people wished there was more, and it was good to have the extra sauce for serving it over the angel hair pasta I made.  My husband said, "Give it a 4", so I did. :o)

Very good. My family all loved it. Has good flavor and relatively easy to make. I left out the garlic though since the pasta sauce has garlic in it and the meats have such flavor. Served over whole wheat egg noodles with green beans. Will definitely make again!

This dish was excellent.  I have cooked it multiple times and it is always a hit!  I sometimes double the sauce to have extra for the egg noodles.

Was kinda disappointed.  just bland, nothing special. I think next time I will try to make the sauce separately using a good quality maranara and make the chicken breaded and baked and them combine the two, kinda chicken parmesagne style.

I did not really care for the flavor of this.  I was very optimistic becuase I like all the ingredients, but it didn't really go over with me that well.

This was good, but if you're used to eating healthy, I don't suggest it.  It was very "heavy" on the stomach.  It felt like we had consumed a lot of fat.  We won't be making it again.

This was an absolutely delicious dish!  I cut everything in half since there's only two of us and it still came out perfectly.  Oh, also I omitted the prosciuto and salami.  The sauce was um um delicious!

This was an excellent recipe--a great company dinner.  I only had three chicken breast halves, so there was plenty of the delicious sauce.  I also added a jar of drained artichokes because we really like them.  I did not add any salt which was a good move as the prosciutto and salami are plenty salty!

Great recipe. The sauce had a wonderful flavour. I omitted the salami as I didn't have any on hand. It tasted so good without it I probably won't bother adding it next time either.

My husband and I loved this dish.  We used Low Sodium chicken broth, a very dry sherry, and the dish was perfect!!!!  The longer the chicken simmered, the better the taste!  We will definately serve this dish again.

Way too salty and not appealing to the eye (a horrible orangy color).  Wouldn't recommend this for a dinner party, that's for sure.

Excellent recipe that is easy to modify according to taste.  It's worth spicing up a bit, but otherwise good as is.  Let it reduce and it will taste all the better.

Great dish. I have been cooking for a long time and I love finding dishes like this. I may have changed a few things but as this is written it's great. Give that chicken a good browning first and you won't be disappointed.

Very good! My family all enjoyed this with southern style green beans and buttered fettuccine noodles!
I left out the mushrooms because I'm the only one in my family who would eat them. I used 4 strips of bacon, cut into about 1/2" pieces instead of prosciutto, and I used some skinless turkey sausage instead of the salami. I also added a little extra chicken broth and heavy cream at the end. Taste the sauce before you serve. Mine had a lot of flavor (probably because of the salt in the bacon and I may have added closer to 2 cloves of garlic), which is why I added a little more liquid. The sauce is so good, I would recommend serving with rice, pasta, or some other plain grain. I used my green beans to soak up the sauce, it was so good!

A great sauce that can easily accommodate changes to what you have in the fridge. Didn’t have marinara, so I made some. Didn’t have prosciutto, used bacon. Didn’t have sherry, used ACV. Don’t care for mushrooms, subbed artichokes. Didn’t have bread crumbs, put some white cheddar popcorn in a food processor. Sauce was great, doubled the amount. Followed others on cooking the chicken first and setting aside while working on the sauce. Served with steamed broccolini and mashed potatoes. Winner, winner...we’ll you know the rest!

Big family hit.  Did not change much this first time around.   Added two more cloves garlic and topped with Romano cheese.   Goes into the rotation as it is not easy to find things that everyone in the house rated highly.   Thanks!

OUTSTANDING!   This is one of the few recipes that are truly 5 stars! I will definitely make this again.  It is a lot like Vodka sauce (Sherry is used here instead) - it is just so delicious.  Cooking for just two people so I used only 1 boneless chicken breast that I pounded out and cut into "nuggets" and it was perfect.  Started by browning up the salami and prosciutto, and then adding the onions (no extra oil for sauté).  Had enough left over that I made it into a casserole a few days later by just adding mozzarella cheese to the top of the dish and covering to heat up.  Delicious again - how great is that!  This is full of flavor and is not oily at all (another reviewer).   Thank you for submitting this gem.

Excellent recipe!  I took other reviewers advice and didn’t add any additional salt. I browned the chicken breasts first then removed and added them back after I had all the sauce ingredients in the pan. It was delicious!

Awesome!  I doubled the sauce and I should have added more chicken, because it is so good you want lots more!   We put it on fresh fettuccine, but itwould have been good on rice or with potatoes.  It’s a winner!

Followed recipe and found it to be incredibly salty due to prosciutto and salami.

I could not get enough of this! I made this exactly as written serving it over plain brown rice. I would not change a thing. The sauce is delicious!! My family devoured it including the kids (ages 6, 4 & 1). Will definitely make this again!!

I made this recipe as directed with two exceptions: I substituted gluten-free flour to accommodate hubby's gluten intolerance, and I sautéed the chicken in butter and olive oil til browned per another reviewer's suggestion. The sauce was thin so next time I'll add some cornstarch to thicken. Even better as leftovers, as the flavors have melded even more.

this recipe was awesome, i would definately make it again.  i did not use the salami or marinara sauce, substituting a little more prosciutto and crushed salt free San Marzano tomatoes.

The flavor was amazing!  Definitely making it again!  A little thin on the sauce but the taste made up for it.

I've made this with and without the meat.  We love it. The meats add a lot of salt so I would be hesitant to serve to guests.

Followed directions as written.  My husband and I really enjoyed.  The kids not so much.  Would make again for the two of us.  Thanks!

When you said men love it, you were right!  My husband told me this was the best thing I've ever made.  It had great flavor and was easy to make.  Because there was so much sauce with it I served it over steamed rice.  I also used a fat-free half and half instead of cream to cut down on the fat a little.  It was wonderful.  I'm so glad I tried this one.  I will definitely make this again, and often.

One word to describe it...SALTY!!!  I didn't even add the salt it called for because I suspected it would be that way.  Very good if there was a way to cut back on the salt.
