This is an excellent cookie. It was a little tricky to bake, though. They will brown if the oven is too hot. A plain cookie is easy to make too. Substitute 1/2 teaspoon vanilla for all of the crushed peppermint. I piped them with a large star tip and they make pretty cookies.

They turned out okay... but I made some mistakes that you should avoid.  First, be sure to watch the cookies. For me, 90 minutes was too long.  Second, if you are piping the meringues out, make sure that the candy canes are very finely crushed.  Third, beat the eggs a little longer than you think you should (call it very stiff peaks).  Folding in the candy canes causes the eggs to deflate a little bit.   And finally, don't add extra peppermint extract like I did... mine are just TOO minty.

This cookie was delicious! Sweet and light and perfect for the holidays.  My only comment is that the recipe as is only made about 13 cookies, not 54, as the recipes states.  If you need a bigger batch of cookies definately double or triple the recipe!

Add one tiny drop of red (turns pink)to easily make look as good as there are. Very happy with the outcome. I had just remembered my mom making these when I was a child. They are so easy! Changes I made from reveiwers were a pinch of cream of tartar and lemon juice instead of cider vinegar(didn't have on hand).

Although these are AWEFUL if you misread the recipe (like I did the 1st time around) and use 1/8 CUP of vinegar vs. 1/8 TEASPOON...   When following the recipe, they turn out great!  I added 3 drops of pink/red food coloring and 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint and it was just the right amount of minty and sweet.  Can't wait to make a bunch for Valentine's Day!

these were the highlight of my christmas season this year.  i ended up making several batches.  they were described as "all the taste of a candy cane without all the work" by one of my friends.

one change that i made is that instead of using candy canes, i used the wrapped peppermint candies, about 15-20.  worked just fine and tasted great.

Quite good, but not the best. An excellent low-calorie dessert. It tasted very much like marshmallows. I made several changes to the recipe: 1) Altered recipe to 28 cookies 2) Used fresh lemon juice in place of vinegar 3) Added a pinch of cream of tartar 4) Instead of peppermint candies/candy canes, I added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract 5) Sprinkled each cookie with unsweetened cocoa powder.

I am surprised how much I enjoy this cookie.  It is really delicious.  I didn't have any peppermint extract to add and I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough flavor... WRONG!  My oven was too hot and they turned a little brown so I will use a lower temp next time.  Less a pastry bag fiasco, these were extremely easy to make and tasty!

Great "cookie" to round out a holiday cookie assortment. Made the meringues exactly as recipe stated, with a little less candy cane because I only had 2. I crushed up my candy canes in my mortar and pestle. One fine and the other more coarse to sprinkle on the top. I also piped them out  and they look adorable. Oh, I only baked mine for 60 minutes. Start checking them at 45 minutes, knowing they will crisp up more when they cool off. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing!  It was easy enough to make with my 8 year old daughter.  She loved watching the egg whites turn to meringue.  The peppermint made it perfect.  It would make an excellent Christmas/Valentines treat.  It gave us something to do with all those candy canes.

These cookies are really yummy! Light as a feather and especially good if you add a hint of almond flavoring and that creates a sweet fluffy cloud with notes of crunchiness(from the candy cane) and almond. If I were you, I would add a few more candy canes than the recipe calls for. This not only adds flavor, but some color as well. Please refrain from adding red food coloring as this will most likely turn the cookies brown. I tried that last night and needless to say, they were a bit flushed of color but still tasted wonderful. These cookies are absolutely to die for!

These were very good. I used 1 tsp of vanilla flavoring instead of the peppermints. and I only baked them for 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of the 1 hour 30 minutes. Very Very good.

I've recently been placed on a temporary low sodium diet. I'm also trying to lose weight. A recipe for meringue cookies was featured at the Weight Watcher's site today, and I remembered eating them as a child. We called them Forgotten Kisses. I figured the sodium to be quite low, and so wanting a treat, I decided I wanted to make them. But the recipe there calls for baking them at 200 for three hours! I didn't want to wait three hours so I searched here and found this recipe which is very close to the one at the WW site. I did make a couple changes so I could get a lower sodium count, and because I didn't have anything peppermint on hand. I did not put any salt in, and increased the vinegar to 1/4 tsp. I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 T unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips. I only baked them for an hour and they were ready to come out. They are a wonderful way to get that chocolate fix. I only got 14 cookies, so the submitter must make them quite small. I figured each cookie to be 52 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, .5 gram of fiber, and 8 mg of sodium. I remember making these lemon flavor as well growing up and they were delicious.

Unbelievably delicious, easy and delightful.  My guests adored them.  I added some chocolate chips to half the batch.  Wonderful!  I took out of the oven 20 minutes earlier and had my heat turned down on the oven to 215 because my oven is hotter

I used powdered egg whites instead of fresh.  I piped the cookies into pretty drops like the picture, but they melted in the oven to a drop cookie shape.

I tried my own variation of this recipe and used Cinnamon Imperials instead of peppermint chips.  turned out ok.  I think they taste a little funny (never the bigest fan of meringue cookies),but after a few seconds, you get that cinnaminy taste, and I LOVE CINNAMON!

** I changed the recipe pretty heavily**

I had egg whites left over from making some creme brulee, and I didn't want to waste them, so I threw some of these together.  

Didn't have vinegar or cream of tartar so I just put in the lemon juice and they came out perfectly.

I had seven egg whites, but I just tripled all other ingredients.

Then, I split the meringue into thirds, put 1/4 tsp vanilla, almond extract, and orange extract in each different third. The orange batch was not delicious, fyi

I make these cookies all the time! I add a few drops of peppermint extract to the mix and about 1/4th of a teaspoon of vanilla extract as well, it helps with the egg white flavor and tones down the sweetness just a bit. I only bake them for 75-80 minutes because at 90 they start getting brown around the bottom edges and they don't look as pretty. Keep in mind when making these that when you take them out of the oven they set up completely in a few minutes, even if they don't feel crisp right out of the oven. You'll know when they're done if they peel very easily off the aluminum foil, if they're still sticking to it and you need to tug them, either wait a few more minutes to set longer or pop them back into the oven for 5 more minutes. This recipe made about 30 half-dollar sized cookies. So if you need to make a lot (and I would! These are fantastic!) you should double, or even triple the recipe.

I wanted to include these cookies in the teacher's cookie baskets. I tried to pipe them but the candy canes kept getting stuck in my star tip. So, I used a spoon to place a small dollop on the pan. The "blobs" did not look great and were so uneven.  I added red food coloring and the cookies turned a shade of light brown once I cooked them:( The kids were not wild about this cookie. However, I did not give up on this recipe. I have made them again with the following changes: I used a mini chop to crush the candy canes into fine particles. This worked well with my star tip. I did not use any food coloring. I also added peppermint extract. The cookies now look uniform and very pretty.

This recipe absolutely rocks! This was my first try at meringue cookies and with this recipe, it won't be my last!  Easy to do and makes a lot.  Tweaked the second batch and made chocolate with Andes pieces and they turned out just as well!

My mom can't have flour.  This is a nice addition to my Christmas cookie plate.  I also think it would be a nice topper for Hot Chocolate.  For other flour free Christmas cookie recipes, look for Church windows and buckeyes.

I had a hard time getting these right. I could not get stiff peaks until I added cream of tarter. The first attempt failed because I carelessly left a bit of egg yoke thinking it wouldn't matter. I did some research at the hour and a half mark of my kitchenaid beating the egg white soup and found that any fat or oil left in the meringue will cause it to fail. My second attempt went well until I dumped the crushed candy cane in the mix. I don't know if it was because I dumped and folded too quickly or because I thought crushed peppermint m&m's would be good and they just didn't mix in the meringue. So the second attemp turned to soup. It's my day off so with my remaining eggs I worked in the charm of the third attempt. I used eight egg whites 1/4 teaspoon vinigar 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter for good measure. I beat this in the mixer on high until there were peaks. I then added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon peppermint flavoring and slowly shook in two cups sugar. Also I added pink food color. Yes you can buy pink in a neon food color collection. Success! I piped my cookies out and baked as directed. I did lower the temp to 200 as I noticed the bottom rack was getting tan on the bottom.  They are good and hard to eat just one.

Everyone loves these and they are so pretty! A few things about meringue: it usually doesn't work out on a rainy/damp day. Use a cold bowl and room temp fresh eggs. Then, keep checking while they bake so they don't brown - turn the temp down or off if necessary. Follow the "rules" and they turn out perfect! Thanks for the great recipe.

Thanks for all the reviews! I used the recipe and the pointers given. My daughter helped me and sifted the crushed candy so I only used the finely crushed parts. She used the rest for a brownie recipe that called for crushed candy. Only the small ( smaller diameter than a quarter) cookies were dried well. Some larger ones were soft inside,  still good but different.

LOVE THEM! Great pink color, VERY minty. I took them to various parties, and people LOVED them if they liked mint.  or for a classy look to cut down on mint flavor omit folding in the peppermint and just sprinkle on top for the look.

These cookies were really good. I'm not a big candy cane fan, but I liked these. I didn't have any cider vinegar, so I just used regular white vinegar. I even read the recipe incorrectly and instead of using 1/3 of the total candy cane, I put in 1/3 cup and they were still good.

I followed directions as written but did add 1/8 tsp of cream of tarter since southern Texas is usually humid. I got over 60 candies but I think it's b/c I made each with about a teaspoon worth of product. They need to be small to dry out completely.  I used a canister type cookie maker with star tip b/c my pastry bag & tips have disappeared. It worked but took longer & not as pretty as I wanted them. I used an oven rack 1 down from the center & the 1 below to cook both sheets at the same time.   If you're making this for an event, practice on a batch so you can get the hang of it. I did sift the crushed peppermint through a strainer & used the powder to fold in the mix, adding by spoon some of the small pieces to make a third, leaving 2/3 of the bigger pieces for sprinkling on top. They are fabulous! I will be making these again!

These turned out great! I had my oven set to 200 as suggested by a few others and after the first 45 minutes checked on them every 15 to 20 minutes until they were just right. I also let the meringues cool down in the oven after shutting it off. I found that I used maybe only 2/3s of the crushed candy cane in and top of the meringues. I've made three batches so far! In the first I added a drop of red food colouring but it didn't give enough colour for my liking. In the second batch I separated the batter in half and added a few drops of red food colouring to one and a few drops of green food colouring to the other. Perfect for Christmas! The last batch I swapped out the candy cane for 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I sprinkled half of the vanilla batch with the candy cane and they taste SO GOOD. Light, sweet and with such a great taste. These meringues are honestly so addictive. My husband, who isn't a fan of candy canes or anything minty, likes these.

Good recipe but instead of adding the salt I added cream of tartar so the egg whites would retain the fluffiness and hold up.  I also turned the oven off after I put the cookies in and let them sit over night (I made them in the evening).  They turned out perfectly.

I have been making these since I was little. They were called OVERNIGHT  MERINGUE COOKIES back then. After you preheat the oven, put cookies in and turn oven off. Leave in oven overnight and in morning you have perfect cookies.

I preheated the oven to 350, put the cookies in and set the timer for one minute.  After a minute, I shut the oven off and left the cookies in the oven overnight.  I also added a teeny bit of cream of tartar (less than 1/8 tsp).  Delicious.

DELISH! Just a tad hard to scoop onto the baking pan (couldn't find a pastry bag). I checked on them periodacally while they were baking to make sure they don't overcook. I would highly reccomend to anyone looking for a festive holiday treat! :)

The candy canes add more chewiness, use less candy canes next time. Other than that they tasted fine. They were the first meringue cookies I made.

The yield is smaller, I was thinking others that were noting that were using cold eggs rather than room temp, but I piped them on the small side and I got 70 out of a double recipe. I also sifted the pepper mints so I used the fine ones in the meringue, and the coarser ones on top. I used to make these when I was. In Girls Scouts, but we put in mini chocolate chips and frosted flakes cereal. Yummy! You can also do green with mini chocolate  chips, just break the chips up a bit after a few minutes in the freezer and add a drop or two of mint extract. Also, no real need to be over 200 degrees in te he oven...

This is a good idea for a recipe.  I made the meringues smaller so as to get the 50 servings.  I felt like 225 for 90 minutes was too much so I lowered the temperature to 210 and took the cookies out about 15 minutes early and boy am I glad I did.  The cookies were already tanned in color and had a hint of a burnt taste.

I will make these again but I will have to lower the temp to 200 and start checking on them before an hour.  I think the smaller size was actually a plus as it allows the cookies to be crisp all the way through, and with a little adjustment on the cooking temp and time I hope they will be a winner!

They turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly as far as that goes but I piped them onto the parchment paper instead of dropping them by the spoonful before sprinkling the crushed candy cane on top.  It took the full 90 minutes to get the bake right, I started checking at 45.  I didn't have any problem with them turning brown at all.  They looked so delicate and beautiful.   I will definitely make them again.   I took them to work for a cookie exchange and they were very popular. Thanks for such a great recipe. The only difference I had with the turnout was I only got 28 cookies instead of 56.  I don't know how tiny they would have to be to bake 56.   But they were 28 wonderful cookies.

This cookie is so refreshing!  It's sweet and minty and just addictive.  I followed the recipe exactly and made 3 batches.  I found too like other people that 90 minutes was too long. The first batch I finally checked at 60 minutes and they were already browning, so I turned off the oven and let them sit for another 10 minutes or so before taking them out of the oven.  The second batch went in and again I found them browning at around the 60 min mark, so I turned the oven off once more.  The third batch I decided to turn the heat down to 220 and they seemed to brown a lot less and I didn't feel the need to turn the oven off until around the 75 minute mark.  However brown they were, the cookies were all delicious so I'm using all of them in my cookie exchange tomorrow.

Follow Mary's recipe exactly.  If you add extract, make sure to use only a few drops or your egg whites will go flat.  This is delicious, fun, easy, and a light treat.  They didn't make it to the dessert table on Christmas Eve, they were gone long before that!  A huge hit I will definitely make again.

I think this is a great basic meringue cookie recipe, and I must agree with the reviewer who piped them. A star tip clogs if candy pieces are not crushed well, so I just used the round collar to pipe these out. I did use the cream of tartar (1/8 tsp) as recommended by another reviewer.  I made these small & bite size but DID NOT get 54 cookies---got about 28-30. I also used the same recipe --deleted the mint candy, added the vanilla & dusted with cocoa as recommended by another reviewer and they were really delicious! Took them to our cookie walk and they were a hit!

Great recipe!  Made it 4 times using peppermint, cappucino chips, cinnamon chips, peanut butter chips and powder, and dark chocolate chips with cocoa.  Each one was great.  Found two keys - you must be able to touch meringue without it sticking, then let it cool on the pan (in the oven is OK, too).  Had never used vinegar instead of cream of tartar.  Works!

I really liked this recipe. I changed it up a bit though and instead of candy canes I added a few drops of peppermint extract until I could smell the mint in the meringue. It turned out tasting almost like homemade butter mints.

Very easy to make.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find my large piping tip and therefore "dropped" them.  Didn't come out as pretty but still tasted good.

I did as someone suggested and sifted the crushed candy cane using the dust inside the cookie. I used a 12" disposable pastry bag and made one pan into quarter-sized cookies then the second pan into the size of chocolate kisses. I also checked it at 45 minutes bake time. The kisses were done at 45 minutes and the larger ones needed a bit more time.  I ended up preferring the smaller ones and will be giving them out for holiday treats.  I've never made meringue cookies before but this is going in the "keep" book!

I liked the recipe however the amount of peppermint extract was a bit too much.  Everything else was fine.  They baked up just fine and looked very pretty for a bridal shower.  Next time I will cut back on the extract.

Very good, but I did not get as many as the recipe states. I only got about half as many. I ended up making 2 batches. They both came out very nice!

These were popular at the Christmas get together I made them for. They definitely don't make 56 cookies, instead they made around 15. But of course, the size of my cookies were quite large. I added a little bit of vanilla extract and red food dye to my meringues. I also think 90 minutes in 225 degrees was too much, mine only took around 40.

These were pretty good. You need quite a bit of food colouring to get even a light colour. Made them in pink and green for Christmas. Sprinkled w crushed candy canes. Found out I'm the only person in my family who likes meringues, but they were classic and looked pretty on a plate. Thank you.

Its great. Not for me though.
Very simple recipe. Awesome if you want to make something for a potluck or party.
I'm sure it depends on your oven but 90min was too long for me. I left them in about 70 min 
Sweat pepperminty and light and airy and really great. I do recommend

Adorable, low calorie for finicky holiday cookie exchangers and tasy! 
Super easy except the candy cane powder cemented to my nostrils is a bit potent

I love these little meringues!  They are so easy to make and you can pipe them into almost any shape; mushrooms, Christmas trees, etc.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't have peppermint candies so I used a combo of vanilla extract and almond extract. They baked for about 90 minutes and came out very well. I'm making another batch today!
