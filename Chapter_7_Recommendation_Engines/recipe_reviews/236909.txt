I made this as written, and while not bad, the spices overpowered the broth. I had never heard of using Chinese Five Spice in a soup before and that may have been the reason for my rating. Interesting recipe, however I would not make again.

Loved this recipe! The aroma coming from my kitchen was amazing! Very easy to make and full of delicious flavors! If you're not a fan of shrimp chicken can easily be substituted or even made with tofu. Would highly recommend giving it a try & we will be enjoying it again real soon!!

I didn't have all ingredients but was still good. Didn't have wine or lemongrass. These probably would have added more flavor and wasn't sure how family would like it. They did so next time will make as recipe says.

We don't eat celery and I couldn't find lemongrass but stuck to recipe otherwise. It was not awful but my husband needed to add a lot of soy and cayenne to feel that it tasted okay.
