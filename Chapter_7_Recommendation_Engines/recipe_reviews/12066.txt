My husband and I really enjoyed this chicken lasagna.  I also brought some to work after I froze some.  And everyone at work wanted the receipe.  Also, I used 12 noodles instead of 9. And I used the no-boil noodles.  I let them soak in cold water for 20 mins.  This way the noodles do not soak up all the liquid when cooking.

This was delicious!  Even my picky boyfriend liked it. I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and cream of chicken with herbs- it gave it great flavor. I also added a package of frozen chopped broccoli for some extra veggies and some chopped green pepper.  Next time I think I'll add red pepper to add color.  Using frozen chopped cooked chicken, frozen broccoli and prechopped onion and pepper made putting this together a breeze!  Its even better the next day too!   will definitely make this again.

This is excellent!...I doubled the recipe first time I made it(mainly just so we could have leftovers).Knew it was going to go over well in my house and it sure did! Husband and kids all loved! Big time saver for me was just buying 2 rotisserie chickens and throwing it all together....made recipe exact, except added extra mushrooms and served it with Bruscetta and salad and topped it all off with an Italian Cream Cake.  Thanks for a great lasagna recipe!

This was good. It does taste more like a chicken casserole than a lasagna.

I have received so many compliments and requests for this recipe.  I made it for our wrestling tournament and for a high school girls Bible study, as well as a women's potluck dinner. It's a hit!  I use onion powder tho, since kids don't usually like the real thing.

Very Good! I added 1/2 - 3/4 cup Chablis Blanc wine to this.  I add wine to most of my casserole type dishes for the extra flavor that it adds.  Also reduced the amount of cheese because I didn't have that much on hand. Guests begged for the Recipe.  A winner!

Very Good. I used a mixture of mozzerella sharp cheddar and monterey jack. (I didn't have enough of any one type) Wonderfully cheesey and rich, but a bit soupy, but that was probably my mistake. This is a keeper.

Very filling and great the next day! I added ricotta cheese and a plentiful helping of fresh garlic. Loved that extra kick. The boys in the house are requesting this one again!

This was average. Too rich for me but still a good recipe for those who like a rich, creamy lasagna. If possible, omit the poultry seasoning if you are using prepared rotteserie chicken like I did.

Fabulous!  My husband told me that if I got the recipe off of the allrecipes website to give it five stars!  I agree with him.  I made it just as the receipt is written.  The cottage cheese makes the recipe. It really does taste like a version of a lasagna.  I always substitute the cheeses and sour cream for the fat free or low fat versions if I can to help around the waist line.  Did turn the broil on for a few minutes at the end to get the cheese on top brown and a little crisp.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

Really delicious! I added a few extra spices and more cheese but it would have been just as great without it.

Best non-traditional lasagna ever.  This is the recipe that got me first interested in this site.  I tend to add an extra can of cream of mushroom, and double up on the meat.  It's so tasty I've had it disappear overnight.

Excellent recipe and not hard to make. I reduced the cheese to only 2 cups of mozzarella because that is all I had on hand, and it was still wonderfully cheesy. I also added half a 10oz package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and cooked. Husband loved it! We'll have this one often.

this is good if you like chicken and creamy soups. it tastes not much different from a regular chicken casserole. it is very filling and even my husband, who has a huge appetite, couldn't eat a second helping, nor did he want seconds. i'm a bit disappointed, but I don't regret trying it out. it is worth the try. oh and you can use the whole box of lasagna noodles (i used oven ready) if you just use more layers.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this! When we have dinner parties, I get this requested all the time.  If you're not conscious about how you're going to eat this, you can actually cut out the cottage cheese and/or sour cream and add more cheese. I've only ever made it with Mozzarella since that's all I keep on hand. It may not be the most healthy thing, but it sure is amazing! Thanks so much for this!

I added garlic powder and fresh basil.  More importantly, I used my own smoked chicken.  Delicious!  My son said please make it again!
