Loved the idea, it was perfectly sweet and I could taste the chocolate. Rather than adding cocoa powder to the milk/egg mixture, I just used chocolate milk. Turned out great!

Cute idea, but probably not something I'd make again. Like other reviewers mentioned, the cocoa powder just didn't want to mix into the egg mixture. I thought about warming the milk then adding it into the egg mixture, but I didn't want scrambled eggs. Perhaps using something like a cocoa mix, like Swiss Miss or Nesquick would have been an easier mix...but that is not what the recipe called for.

Even my I-Shirk-Away-From-Anything-Remotely-Sweet-Or-Chocolatey mother ate three slices (yes, an achievement for her)! Pretty good, but nothing exceptional. You couldn't really taste the 'French Toast-ty' thing in it; it was like a lovely chocolate toast. I omitted the baking powder because I was out of it, and it turned out very good. However, I needed to use 13 slices of bread (store-bought). I needed to use A LOT of oil, even with a non-stick pan. HINT: Fry them well till crisp; the texture is like that of a cake-ish bread when they aren't fried really well. I also found they taste better when cooled, not steaming hot from the pan; and this is coming from a person who won't come within a mile's radius of remotely cooled toast, French or otherwise.

I have not made this but if you mix the cocoa and sugar together making sure there are no lumps in the cocoa. Then add the milk, a little at a time making a paste. Slowly add the remaining milk; mixing to make a syrup. Add to the other ingredients. There should be no problem getting the cocoa to mix in.

Nice recipe. Whenever you try to add a dry ingredient, you must whisk the sugar and cocoa or cinnamon with the eggs first then add the milk little by little or it will all separate and rise to the top

I made this recipe this past weekend.  I saw the reviews about difficulty mixing the cocoa in the mix...I was able to get it mixed in well with a hand held mixer, it took about a minute but got it to work on low to medium speed.  the french toast turned out well...not too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness.  I also used half and half instead of milk...

This was good and quick enough to throw together. I had a little difficulty getting my cocoa powder to incorporate with the other ingredients. I’d suggest mixing the dry ingredients with just the eggs first and then adding the milk to make this incorporation easier. This was delicious served with cherry pie filling and powdered sugar.

I just have to say we loved this.  Made it exactly as written while being snowed inside during the Blizzard of 2010 in Southern Maryland.  It had a nice and rich chocolate flavor - justed used a little less sugar.  We also had Almond Syrup that went really good with it.  Thanks lots.

This was very tasty and pretty quick to make for a homemade breakfast.  I scaled the recipe down to two servings which worked very well.  I also used Wonder Smart White bread and defrosted some strawberries which I quickly mashed with a fork and poured on top with the syrup.  My picky four year old ate every bite.

Oh wow. I have to give this a 5 star review for one simple fact: I *hate* French Toast. However, I loved these to pieces! I didn't have any fruit-flavoured syrup, so I improvised by making a quick syrup out of cherry pie filling on the stove. I know that these will be making a regular appearance on my breakfast menu! I also love how the ingredients are simple and commonly stocked in most kitchens.  No outlandish or odd ingredients; everything is simple and straightforward for a quick, easy to make meal that anyone can love. Even a french toast-hater like me can be converted.  I noticed people have said the cocoa doesn't wish to mix in. I had no problems, but I used a sifter to blend the sugar and cocoa in at the same time, eliminating the lumps in the cocoa. It *did* settle at the bottom, but mixing it between cooking times on the stove helped keep it together.

Just made it. For the people complaining about the cocoa not blending with the egg mixture, you need to make a paste of the cocoa, sugar, baking powder and salt with a small amount of milk first. Then once the cocoa has dissolved, add the rest of the milk and whisk to combine well. What I do after all has been combined is pour the mixture through a mesh strainer to remove any egg shells or lumps so you end up with a nice smooth batter. It was actually pretty good, and a nice change from the usual french toast.

I had the same issue mentioned before with the cocoa not wanting to mix into the rest of the mixture, but once I got it it went really well.  I did notice that the cocoa wanted to burn before they bread(store bought) was cooked, but once I got the timing down it turned out well.  They do taste really chocolatey but I topped mine with bananas and it tasted great!  I'll probably try the chocolate milk next time though

I have been making this for years adding almond flavoring and topping with sweetened whipped cream and fruit. My B&B guests loved it! If you are having trouble mixing the cocoa in, try mixing it with the sugar in a small amount of warm water first.

Just OK. I like regular french toast much better, and this did not look appealing at all. You will have to whisk the mix very well to add in the cocoa (otherwise it will not blend in). I think next time I will just add a tablespoon or so of cocoa to my regular french toast batter, because it did add a good flavor, but I don't think it should be the main taste.

Yummy. After reading other reviews with complaints of the coco powder not mixing, I mixed my dry ingredients first then the milk and eggs, and slowly added the wet ingredients to the dry while whisking together and it turned out fine. Just did basic butter and syrup, but next time fruit will be added as other reviewers have suggested. Thank you for the recipe.

A nice recipe for when you are looking for something different, I sifted the dry ingredients (cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and sugar) and beat the eggs in one at a time, then slowly added the milk. I substituted fructose instead of sugar as I am diabetic. 
Cooked on low-med heat. 
My daughter who loves Nutella used this on hers, everyone else used their favorite toppings from maple to golden syrup. This is a recipe I may make again if the family ask for it.
Personally I still prefer traditional French toast.

The problem that I  had was the cocoa powder would not blend in with the remaining ingredients.  The first four slices had a thick coating of cocoa powder on them and they were not edible.  The remaining slices did not have enough cocoa powder in the batter so they did not have an enough chocolatey flavor.  I used a wire whisk in making the batter.  My suggestion would be to blend the ingredients in a blender.  I was wondering if chocolate syrup could be substituted for the cocoa powder or if chocolate milk could be substituted.  Anyway, I will not be trying this recipe again.

These were really good but very chocolatey.  My 3 boys didn't eat it.  I used store bought bread and was able to get about 12 or 13 slices. I only soaked each slice for about 10 seconds.  They cooked up really nice my electric griddle.

My kids love chocolate chip pancakes and this is even easier (and healthier as it turns out!). Be careful to let the excess egg wash drain off before you cook it in a pan or it might be a little mushy in middle. I had some egg batter left over after the kids left so I put it in a remikin dish, tore up pieces of leftover bread and microwaved it for 8 mins on level 4. Guess what??!? I created wonderful servings of chocolate bread pudding which when cooled was a hit after school with a little confectioners sugar or whipped cream. I will make this for sleepovers and be a neighborhood hero or make the bread pudding alternative when we have people over and impress the whole crowd! Next I will experiment with skim milk, a lower egg white/yolk combo, and whole grain breads to find the healthiest version-- maybe even add a tablespoon of flax seed. I highly recommend using egg beaters to fluff up the eggs and mix the cocoa completely into the egg wash. Add cocoa a little at a time at low speed initially or it will create "cocoa smoke" and you'll have more to clean up than eat.

These came out delicious. I just wisked the cocoa and dry ingredients together first, then added wet.  Seemed to blend just fine, Maybe letting it set a little bit when mixed and re-mixing may help. I used thicker 7-grain toast and loved it, Just got to cook it on a lower setting and for longer with thick cuts.

To mix the cocoa powder in evenly so you don’t get lumps, I mix the powder with a little of the milk/egg mixture to make a paste. 

Then combine the rest of the milk/egg mixture with the cocoa paste.

I also add a little vanilla and cinnamon to accent the chocolate.

for easier blending of cocoa, stir together the cocoa and sugar until well mixed, then proceed to the rest of the prep.

This is a nice change from regular french toast, but I had to cook mine at more of a medium-low heat to cook it through without burning the cocoa powder.  I would not make this all the time, it is more for a breakfast party or holiday breakfast or other occasion, since it is a little rich.

I made just enough for me (2 pieces):  Following advice of others, I combined 1 Tbsp Cocoa (Hershey's Dark) and 2 Tbsp sugar.  Then I mixed in 3 Tbsp milk, one Tbsp at a time.  Added the egg.  I remembered the baking powder but forgot the salt.  I cooked them on each side for about 3 minutes and they were great!  Very chocolately, but not overly sweet.  I have a small whisk that I used to combine the ingredients.  I will make this again.
5/29/2016  -- I did make this again.  Forgot the salt and the baking powder and don't see that it made any difference.  I used a tsp of raspberry jam on top of each piece -- a great addition.  This is going to be a staple of Sunday morning breakfast.
June 2016 -- My granddaughter and I made the full recipe for dinner one night.  No left overs!  Love this recipe!

WoW!! Thank you,

We loved the chocolate french toast.  We ate them with out any topping and we will make this again.  Thank you for creating such an addition to our lives.

Tip:  I use my waffle maker to cook french toast.  It looks a little funny.  But, it cooks faster, both side are done at the same time.

The taste is really good! Some of the cocoa powder doesn't mix with the other ingredients so the first 2 slices of bread have dry cocoa powder on them, and they were kinda black after being cooked. But they taste really good nonetheless! And after that, the cocoa powder is gone so the 3rd slice and so on didn't have any problem at all. And once again I will say, the taste is yummy!!

This was a nice idea, but I really didn't taste the chocolate much. I added some Nutella and chocolate syrup for a more chocolatey taste. Dipping the bread for 20 seconds seems a bit too long for me. Also, I'm not quite sure what the purpose of the baking powder was. It didn't seem to add anything. Overall, it tasted good and is a nice change from regular French Toast.

I really liked it, and used a good quality dark cocoa. The cocoa stirred into the mixture really well, and was rich and tasty! Sweet and yummy. I had mine with a little powdered sugar, vanilla yogurt and fresh strawberries. My son sprinkled powdered sugar and squirted a nice amount of maple syrup on his.

This recipe is great! I tried it alongside another recipe and this one was much better, but vanilla may make it better. Mixing was not that hard, just add the cocoa powder to the whisked eggs to form a 'paste', then baking powder, then slowly add the milk and sugar, while maintaining smoothness. Or make a paste from cocoa and oil, then add to whisked eggs, as cocoa is fat soluble. Thank you

This is a fun and simple recipe that can be made without the cocoa powder to prepare basic french toast. I served it with fresh cherries on the side.

I put a little less sugar than the recipe required.  The Chocolate French Toast was excellent.  Served with a can of cherry pie filling which was also very tasty with the toast.   If you like chocolate you will enjoy eating this delicious French Toast.

my boys loved it!  however, it did stick to my non-stick griddle so I'll have to spray the pan next time.  I used my immersion blender and the cocoa blended perfectly without any lumps.

When I mixed up all ingredients, it began to foam. I'm not sure what happened or why it did that. I threw out the pieces of bread that had been coated with the foam. I served the rest to my family and they thought it was really a great find.

Took a few tries but the issues I had have more to do with instructions or the lack thereof. First, if you just throw the ingredients together the cocoa will clump. Period. To resolve this I mixed the wet ingredients and sifted the cocoa into the dry. Mix up the dry well then whisk them into the wet. Make sure to use an upwards rotation while whisking. This left me with a foamy chocolatey goodness. I used store bought bread because that's what I had and a 15 sec soak per side is almost too much (10 wasn't enough) cooking time was almost spot on but I did reduce the heat (4 out of 10) because the mixture was burning before it cooked all the way through. I also helped presentation to make sure you let the bread drain for a good 10 sec before throwing it in the pan. That way you don't end up with it flowing around the sides. When it did I used the spatula to slide it away. As a side note, leftover mixture does a slightly odd looking but tasty scrambled egg.

I used Nesquick instead of sugar and cocoa powder (dissolves MUCH better), and served with canned cherry pie filly and cool whip. Much better than ordinary French toast!

This was really great to have when we had the cravings of chocolate, but wanted something filling and not candy!

I warmed my milk then added the cocoa mix. This works so much better.

This was pretty good. I added even more chocolate flavor to it by making chocolate bread the night before. If you will heat up some of the milk first before whisking in the cocoa powder, you won't have any problem getting the cocoa mixed in. I added vanilla to the recipe, which makes it taste and smell even better. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I cut the recipe down to 1/4 since I was just feeding myself. I replaced the sugar and cocoa with 2 Tbs of some really nice organic hot (dark) chocolate mix I had on hand, which solved the issue of mixing in the cocoa powder. The bread was 3/4" thick slices from a hearty whole-grain, seed-covered baguette. I normally fry my french toast in coconut oil, but this time I used 1/2 butter for the flavor. The toast came out sweet enough that I just topped it with plain yogurt, and it was fabulous -  as well as healthy.
As usual, I had a little of the mixture left over so I scrambled it, with a sprinkle of shredded coconut mixed in. Yummy!
