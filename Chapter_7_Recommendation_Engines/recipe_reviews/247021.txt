5 stars all the way! I'm not a big tuna fan, but wanted to try something new and different.  This tastes like something you'd be served at a fancy lunch. Very elegant and also very versatile. Great as lettuce wraps, in a whole grain wrap, stuffed in a tomato, you name it! I used butter lettuce because that's what I had on hand and I also used about half the amount of red onion. I served it over 4 lettuce leaves for a delicious lunch.  I did find that this made 4 very small servings...to me this was more like 2-3 servings if you're having it as a main meal.  Also, this makes a lot of balsamic syrup. I halved the syrup ingredients, and still had plenty. I think a light drizzle is all that's needed, so as to not overpower the other ingredients.  The sunflower seeds are a fantastic touch, so don't leave them out! This one's a keeper and I'll be making it often! Next time I might also use a bit more capers, since I really like them.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using a 7 oz can of tuna (Costco) & a little less than a can of small white beans.  I was surprised how much I liked it. The balsamic syrup & sunflower seeds send it over the top. Next time I might add some avocado!

Quick and easy recipe. Loved the flavor! Very fresh and healthy. The sweetness of the sauce was a great balance against the tuna and beans. Even my 6 year old cleared his plate. Would make again!

I love this!  The creaminess of the beans really takes the tuna to a new level.  I added diced celery, too.

This was great! I used turbinado sugar instead of brown (it was all I had) with a touch of maple syrup.  I also put it on a bed of lettuce, you get more greens and the serving seems larger.  I will definitely be making this again!!

I loved this. I added halved grapes and put it on a whole grain wrap with lettuce. There were leftovers so I had it the next day and it was even better!
