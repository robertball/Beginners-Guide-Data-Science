I doubled the recipe, used roasted, New-Mexican green chilis, added cilantro, salt, a LOT of freshly ground pepper and used Colby-Jack cheese.  Very tasty, very easy and very quick!  I have already been asked for the recipe and I just served it for the first time a few minutes ago!

Very yummy, but not spicy.  I was hoping to recreate Central Market's Green Chili Chicken soup, but this was creamier.  I would definitely add something to spice this up.

Very easy to make, used boiled chicken instead of canned. I did use canned green chile's with much success.

MMmmm... this was really tasty.  However, my husband and I had this as a meal and it was barely enough.  I would double it next time, and use twice as much chicken - just a little skimpy.

Good recipe. I used grilled chicken breasts instead of canned and some diced tomato as well. It worked okay with regular milk instead of half-n-half. I would recommend it. Nice served with the buttered tortillas.

Delicious soup - reminds me of Chicken enchiladas.
Both of my teenagers loved it.  I doubled the recipe thinking it didn't seem like much, but it is so rich, I think the proportions are probably about right for each serving.  We love spicy, so I added some diced jalepenos.

I used a pound of chicken breast, which I cubed and sauteed with the onion.  I also used about 1 3/4 cup of half & half. I put 2 cans of green chiles into my chopper to make them a bit finer, then I added another can of chiles which I didn't chop.  I also added a small bag of potatoes to the soup.  It was so good!  My husband and I really loved the creamy texture.  I will double the recipe next time, however, because between me, my husband, and our 3 older daughters, we ate every drop of this!

An excellent, easy and very flavorful soup. My husband and I love it and I've shared the recipe with friends and coworkers. I usually double the recipe and sometimes change up the seasoning to include chipotle. This also freezes very well.

This soup is a hit in our household.  I cooked the chicken myself, rather than using canned.  I also used fresh green chilis and sauteed them along with the onions and added some salt and black pepper.  I served it with steamed rice so it would be easier for my 22 month old to spoon up.  Perfect for a cold winter's evening.

A nice mild creamy chili soup that is easy to make for one or two people. You could easily add in extra spices or herbs and maybe even a can of beans if you desire. I put in one chopped jalapeno pepper and some shakes of Mexican oregano, and dried parsley for some extra flavor. I was delighted to see other reviews that used canned green chilies since fresh are not in the markets this time of year. I let it gently simmer for about an hour to allow for the flavors to release. I'm sure I'll make it again and hopefully have fresh chilies next time, although it was very good with the canned chilies.

This was great, perfect dinner on a chilly day. I doubled it and added rice, a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and chicken stock to thin it out and add more dept of flavor. I'm going to try it with potatoes next and add more chile flavor. As is this is good for someone who just wants a little heat.

I thought it was good, nothing special, but it tasted okay.  My kids wouldn't eat more than a couple bites, though.  It is *really* easy, but I probably won't make it again.  It's kind of bland.  Not what I expected.

This was my first try at "Southwestern" cooking and I was very pleased. I roasted fresh green chilis, added a chopped jalapeno, and used fresh chicken.  I'll definitely make up a big batch to freeze.  Delicious.

Patricia, thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.  I am always looking for soup recipes to eat in the winter and this fits the bill.  But, I also have this as a starter when I'm fixing Taco's  etc.

This was perfect for a quick weeknight meal and using up leftover shredded chicken.   I doubled the recipe and simmered it for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.  I only had about 1 cup of half & half  on hand so used whole milk for the rest.  I don't think the half & half is really necessary anyway as the cream soup is already so rich.  Canned green chilies worked well and I also added about a cup of leftover white rice.  I forgot to serve it with cheese and sour cream but found that it was not missed as, again, it is already so rich.  Served with tortilla chips. Even better the next day!

I liked this, but I will be playing with it.  swapping out 1/4 cup of cream for milk to begin with, then maybe a rotisserie chicken instead of canned

My co worker made this today and it was fantastic! She only changed a couple things. She substituted the half and half with evaporated milk and some chicken broth. Also she added a little bit of cream of celery soup because she didn't have enough cream of chicken soup. I will definitely make this at home as soon as I have a day off lol!

It's a good base but I made quite a few changes. I doubled the recipe because the original does not make a very big batch. I added a bit more onion, red bell pepper finely chopped up, more green chile about half a cup more, a bunch of black pepper, I baked some chicken breast and shredded it and added it about a lb., cilantro, some chicken broth to thin it out a bit. I don't think I would have been happy with the original but with my add in it was very good. I would recommend this recipe but most definitely tweak to your personal liking!

Honestly, as written it's a little bland. I doctored mine up with some seasonings and served it with tortilla chips, and it was pretty good. Loved how quickly it came together.

I used real chicken, a can of green chiles, plus real peppers. You can use peppers of your liking to get it hot or mild.  
I added a 2 cups of mixed cheeses to it to richen it up.  and an extra cup of half and half  this down all the cheese. 
Added a few more spices like garlic, salt, pepper and beef bouillon.

This is a family favorite. I double or even triple the recipe, use Anaheim peppers (about double the amount called for) and about a half a jalapeno.  I sauté the peppers with the garlic and onion to get them nice and soft.  Get it to a nice slow simmer and dump in about 1 and 1/2 the cheese (I use Monterey Jack). Serve with warm tortillas or garlic bread. We love it.

I tweaked this recipe a bit. First I doubled it for a football party. Second I did not use the canned chicken. I used sweet Italian sausage. It gave it really nice flavor. It was a big hit and I will make it again.

I made this tonight and it was very good. I used canned chilies and skim milk instead of the cream. I added diced jalapenos after reading the reviews because I wanted a soup with some heat. This was fast, easy, and delicious.

We have goats, so our alterations involved using our rich goat milk instead of half-and-half, and using chevre instead of sour cream.  We upped the 'medium' fresh Hatch chilis to 1 cup, and used mushroom soup instead of chicken, cutting out the chicken so the whole soup was vegetarian.  We adults liked the soup quite a bit, but the kid thought it 'tasted funny'.  We'll probably make it again and throw a couple XXX hot chilis in for some heat. :)

This was delicious, quick and easy!  I added cilantro and used New Mexico green chili.  I also used a larger can of chicken and one cup of 2% milk.
