These muffins are extremely delicious! A few things you have to remember. As another reviewer said, these muffins have the tendency to stick and be a disaster. Keys to not sticking.. Make 100% sure you grease the cups very very well. Also grease the top of the pan around the cups. Don't over fill. And make SURE you let them sit for about 20 min before removing from cups. These are really the most delicious muffins I've tasted!! Well worth the extra steps needed to keep them from sticking. They are soo very moist (the reason why they stick so easily) and AWESOME! I made them as the recipe said and wouldn't change a thing!

These were absolutely the very best blueberry muffins that I've ever had.  Everyone in me family LOVES them!  I followed another reviewer's advice and I added 1/4 cup of applesauce, plus I added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Someday, I might even try adding lemon flavoring instead.....either way, I bet they'll be delicious!

I added 1/4 applesauce to the recipe and used 2 pints of blueberries (we really like the muffins bursting with them) They turned out great! Baked the same time and did not add any extra flour or anything to compensate for the applesauce. Would definately make these again.

The only thing redeeming about this recipe is the good flavor.  Otherwise, these muffins were a disaster.  I am sure that I followed the directions precisely.  I carefully and completely greased each individual muffin cup in the muffin tin with shortening, and yet every attempt to remove a muffin from its cup resulted in the top breaking off and the bottom sticking in the cup.  I wanted to take these to work with me, but all I would have to show are some broken-off tops and some crumbs from the bottom of the muffins.  I am very disappointed.

This recipe stinks!  Not literally, but it was not the best recipe for blueberry muffins.  The batter came out purple (since you need to mash the blueberries and add it to the mix), it tastes very bland and if I cooked them for the full 30 minutes, they would have burned since they were well done at 22 minutes.  I will not make this again.

My husband and I loved the muffins. The only tweeking I did was add 1 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and extra 1/2 cup of blueberries. I also didn't sprinkle the sugar on top. I would use this recipe again!

I made this a non-dairy recipe by using water instead of milk though I found it needed about a 1/4C more of liquid.  I also skipped the topping.  They came out of the tins very easily (I used non-stick) even right out of the oven.  Everyone loved them though I thought they were slightly too sweet.

I also substituted applesauce for all of the butter, decreased the sugar a bit accordingly, and used whole-wheat flour instead of white. They only need about 20 minutes in the oven, 30 minutes is overkill unless you have monstrously sized muffin tins. They were healthy and moist, turned out quite nicely!

I found this recipe awsome!!!  It's more like a cake muffin than a heavy biscut muffin.  I added vanilla, a little lemon zest, and cinnamon and didn't mash any blueberries because I didn't want them to be gray/blue through-out.  I topped them with cin/sugar.  They are light, airy, and DARN GOOD!!  Thank you for this recipe, it's a keeper!!!

Excellent.  Only had 1/2 the amount of blueberries needed.  Still excellent!  Used paper liners because after reading some of the reviews I got a bit nervous about them sticking. Worked out great.

When I ate these, I couldn't believe I made them, and that I didn't get them from some fancy restaurant.  These were amazingly wonderful!  I tried it without the sugar on top... and I definitely like the ones with the sugar better.  It crystalizes the top and it makes them scrumptiously crunchy on top (but not too crunchy).  They were great.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again!

Delicious!  I already had two neighbors who I shared with ask for the recipe!  Just a comment or two about the recipe itself:  When I was preparing these the batter was quite thick, but that turned out not to be a problem as the finished product was perfect.  Also, I filled 12 muffin cups almost to the top and had enough batter to make 2 mini loaves as well.  To prevent sticking, I used paper liners, which worked perfectly.  For my mini loaves I just used PAM spray on the pans and they came right out of the pans after cooling.  No trouble with sticking whatsoever.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!  I followed it exactly and would not change a thing.

Wow, these were sooooo good!  I love blueberry muffins and this will be my go to recipe when I feel like eating some.  It's simple yet so tasty! I didn't want to alter the recipe too much, but I increased the milk to 1/2 cup since the batter was too thick.  I threw in some chocolate chips because I LOVE chocolate!  Yummy in my tummy!  Thanks OKBEE ;)

I LOVED THIS RECIPE.. I was looking for a basic muffin recipe so I could incorporate strawberries into it. I tried this one and used strawberries instead of blueberries and it is the best muffin I have ever eaten..

This recipe didn't work well for me.  The muffins didn't come out of the pan well, didn't rise, and had the consistency of cake (perhaps i over mixed it).  They didn't brown, they just burned.  I was disapointed.

Everyone enjoyed these muffins.  They have a good consistency and flavor.  I washed and coated the blueberries with flour prior to adding them to the batter and they were very even throughout the muffin.  I filled the muffin to the top and the batter made 10 average sized muffins.  I think the next time I might eliminate the sugar on top because my husband prefers them a little less sweet.

Very good!! But I also had a problem getting them out of the pan and used the freezer method. Either super-grease & flour, or use the cupcake liners. Really, really good though - I'll make them again, absolutely.

Used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white; added 1/4 c applesauce, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and a few shakes of lemon peel and cinnamon.  Used Splenda Mix for Baking instead of all sugar and 3 cups of frozen blueberries.  Turned out delicious!

30 minutes at 375 degrees? Really?! As an experienced baker I should have went with a lower temp and shorter baking time but with all the great reviews I thought maybe there was something magical about these muffins. They came out burnt, wasting some very expensive ingredients. Also, I did not see the point of going to the trouble of adding the sugar topping as it wasn't a crumb or struesel topping and didn't add anything to the muffins.

Best Muffins I have ever made. I did change certain things about the recipe however. Instead of just 1 1/4 cups sugar I put 1 1/2 since the problem I normally have with my muffins is that they are not sweet enough. 2nd since I only had a little less than 2 cups of blueberries I added one very ripe banana which I think made the muffin even moist. I will def be making these again!

Very moist!  My son is allergic to eggs so I used Ener-g egg replacer and it worked out well.  Also I ran out of butter so I substituted shortening (1/2 cup butter = 1/2 shortening + 1 tsp salt).  I omitted the sugar sprinkle on top as it was already very sweet; in fact, next time I might cut down on the sugar.  And for a bit of a healthy kick, I added 2 tbsp of ground flaxseed.  As for the blueberries, I only defrosted them halfway which I think helped make the muffins very moist when done.

These muffins are awesome! The sugar on top adds great texture to the moist muffins. I beat the butter and sugar for quite a while and the rest just folded in. I used fresh blueberries the first time this time I used frozen which I defrosted almost all the way and I could tell no difference. I never 'mashed' the bluberries as the recipie calls for. I figure they get mashed enough on their on when the batter is mixed and I like whole berries in mine anyhow. I don't know if I used the 1/4 cup of sugar it calls for I just put a spoonfull on top of each one before it goes in the oven. Also, I got 16 muffins both times.

The best blueberry muffins ever ! I didn't smash the 1/2 cup blueberries though and I used 1/4 cup fat free half and half instead of 1/4 cup milk.  These were so moist and tasted as if they came from some really good bakery!

excellent taste and moist texture.  USE CUPCAKE LINERS OR THEY WILL STICK and don't overfill (fill 2/3 of muffin cup) or top will stick.  we used tablespoon to remove (didnt use liners 1st time).  again this is an wonderfully flavorful muffin recipe

These were amazing!  The mashed blueberries really made the difference.  I waited until the muffins had baked for 20 minutes before sprinkling the remaining sugar on top.

Pretty darn good! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using margarine instead of real butter, since I never use the real stuff. I suggest eye-balling the sugar on top, 1/4 C is too much and just makes a sugary mess while eating. I made 17 muffins using regular sized muffin tins and used paper cups to prevent sticking. These passed the toothpick test at about 24 min and didn't need the full 30 min cooking time. Next time I will try adding a little vanilla extract to the batter for some extra flavor.

These turned out great, soft and perfect.  If you are using frozen berries however I suggest you use less than called for because frozen berries tend to be larger than fresh berries and take up most of the space of the muffin cups.

these were the amazing blueberry muffins! this was my first time ever making muffins and it was a simple, easy recipe! and they were delicious! I used liners so it would be easier to get them out. I will definately make these again! although, I'll probably use less than 1/4 extra sugar for the top, it was a little excessive!

I made these today, they were my first attempt at a homemade muffin recipe.  They turned out absolutely divine!  I used paper liners, which I definitely recommend for this recipe.  There are so many fresh blueberries that the muffins don't stay together quite as well as other boxed recipes I've made, the liners keep them together.  Also, I only baked them for 20 minutes since my oven tends to overcook everything...20 minutes and I had delicious, golden brown blueberry muffins!  The sugar on top went perfect with this recipe as it calmed down the tartness of the fresh blueberries.  Just perfect!  Thanks for sharing!

this was soo good! my only complaint is that it was really hard getting them out of the muffin tin in one piece, so definitely use paper liners. other than that, i used only 1  cup of white sugar, and only 2 cups of flour - 1 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white. and instead of white sugar on top, i used brown sugar. they taste fantastic! i will definitely make these again!

"These are, like, the BEST blueberry muffins EVER!" That was an actual comment received from one of my friends when I served these at brunch yesterday. I tweaked the recipe slightly. I added two pinches of baking soda, several shakes of cinnamon, and a tsp or two of vanilla. And then I poured in about a tbspn? of Sprite. Oh, and I crumbled brown sugar on top, along with the white sugar (and I put in two cups of white sugar instead of the suggested amount). They were very sweet, but oh so good! Oh, and my batter made an even two dozen. I will DEFINITELY make these again!

This is by far the BEST blueberry muffin recipe I have ever made.  I prefer them with about half the sugar sprinkled on top (1/8 cup or a tablespoon or two).  The tops are divine!! They're chewy and delicious.  The muffins are moist and light.  Everyone I have served these to has loved them!

The only thing I changed was I didn't mash the blueberries. I had read how several people had issues with the muffins sticking so I tried it first myself by spraying a lot of Pam on the pan. Ya I had sticking issues too. So I made the rest with paper cups and had else someone try one, for I am full off the first batch. LOL Anyway it peeled nicely so anyone concerned about it sticking use paper cups they were just fine after.

I brought a batch of these to work, and they got raves.  One foodie friend said they were the best blueberry muffins he had ever had.

I didn't have any milk or fresh blueberries when baking, so I made a few changes: 
•  Used 1/3 cup low-fat buttermilk rather than ¼ C milk
•  Used frozen blueberries rather than fresh

•  the frozen blueberries will make the dough stiffen (freeze up), so mound it in the muffin cups
•  because frozen, you cannot mash them, and thus the extra buttermilk

• The recipe says for 18 muffins, I used it for 12 to make monster muffins

Really good muffins...however, they started to burn at about 20 minutes. Had I cooked them the full 30, they would have burned. I used muffin tins and they did not stick to them. Be sure not to overfill your cups otherwise you will have a disaster on your hands. I followed the recipe exactly except I  did not mash my blueberries. They were gone fast. Everyone loved them.

I have no idea why anyone found this to be bland. They are bursting with flavor! I suppose the people who thought it was bland maybe didn't follow the recipe correctly. Adding the mashed berries into the batter really added a lot of flavor and made the muffins very colorful. I am not a fan of blueberry muffins because they tend to be bland, and I was actually making these for a friend. After I tried them, I kept half for myself! They are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, easy to prepare and very pretty! Thank you so much for the recipe! I will definitely be making this one again and again.

My picky 2 year old loves these.  I omit the sugar topping and mashed berries b/c I like to keep things simple.  I have subbed in almond flour for half of the AP flour for extra nutrition and calories and have have had success (although they're a bit more crumbly while hot).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Love these muffins!    They are already very moist, so I like to add brown sugar instead of white sugar which seems to make them moist without being as sticky.  Plus, it seems to taste richer.  I also sprinkle some brown sugar on top before they bake for a delicious sugar-crust if we eat these muffins for dessert.  I will try applesauce next time as other reviewers have suggested!

I really love the flavor of these muffins. I followed all of the directions, except the sugar sprinkling at the end. I used much less than 1/4 cup sugar on top. I did bake for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, which was too long and some were burned. I will definitely make these again, though I will start checking them at 20 minutes and go from there. I forgot to add: I used frozen blueberries (microwaved and mashed the 1/4 cup) and dusted them with flour before folding in. Turned out wonderfully!

Update: I made these again, but had to modify to 15 servings instead of 18. I baked them for 20 minutes exactly and they turned out perfectly!

A little dry. I used half whole-wheat flour for a healthy boost. Pretty basic, nothing spectacular, but enjoyable nonetheless.

I just finished making these and they were perfect!  I followed the advice for greasing/flouring the pan real well - even the top - and waiting the full 20 minutes and they popped right out of the pan no problem.  I did take them out at 27 minutes as they were browning and I didn't want them to be dry (I have an electric oven which tends to cook fast and unevenly).  I also added the teaspooon of vanilla that was recommended, just b/c I love vanilla.  I will definitely be making these again and again.

I gave this 5 stars because of my additions. I added 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla.    I sprinkled a mixture of cinnamon and sugar on top, before cooking. They are delicious!!

These were okay.  30 minutes is too long to bake (at least mine were a little overcooked).  Also, next time I will leave the blueberries whole, because the batter turned blue-purple and it was not visually appealing at all (NOTHING like the picture).  Made exactly as-is and probably will look for a new recipe.

WOW! I used this recipe and replaced the wheat flour with Oat flour because my son is allergic to wheat. I also used slightly blended blackberries and strawberries instead of blueberries. Oh my god, this turned out incredible! Oh yea I used berry juice instead of milk as I was out of it! WOW! Incredible.... moist and real berry taste!

ok i think i must have gone wrong somewhere cos my muffins definateley didnt taste amazing like other reviewers said they did. i thought they were a little salty and all my bluberries sank to the bottom :( i am not an expert at making muffins so maybe i made a mistake, also it is not really the season for blueberries so i dont think that helped as the berries didnt taste very nice. Am a bit dissapointed dont think i will be trying this recipe again, sorry!

These were S00000 delicious!! I did it exactly as the recipe said, and they turned out marvelously. I did it twice. Both times I just made large muffins so they just made 12 instead of 18. Same cooking time. I also tried it one time with mixed berries. Same amazing results! Oh and I also tried it with rice or soy milk for those with lactose intolerance. Yummy!

Absolutely delicious!  I cannot have dairy so I substituted applesauce for the butter and almond milk for regular milk.  I also used whole wheat flour because I didn't have regular and they still tasted great.  I sprayed a non-stick pan with Pam and did not have a problem with them sticking.

OK, I know everyone just loves these muffins, as did I. This recipe will work as a coffee cake as well as muffins. I will definitely make it again, but in loaf pans next time.  It does get a 5 for taste, though!

This was my first attempt at from scratch muffins, and I loved this recipe! It is a sticky batter, but the muffins turned out so moist. I also didn't have to cook them for 30 minutes, but that's fine too!   Also, I only put in 1 1/2 cups of blueberries, and the muffins still turned out fabulous. YUM!

This is a great and easy to follow recipe.  To make a healthier muffin you can substitute 1/2 the flour with oats or add some wheat germ in lieu of flour.

Finally - great blueberry muffins!  I honestly followed the recipe to a T (unusual...) and only needed to bake them for 25 minutes.  I used paper cups and was sure not to overfill them.  They have a nice sweetness to them that perfectly balances the blueberries.  I'll definitely keep this recipe and make them again.

These muffins were simply amazing!!! The only thing I did differently was bake them to about 25 minutes to keep them from drying out too much. But everyone loves them and I'll definately be making them again very soon! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

These muffins are wonderful!! I used paper baking cups, greased around the top of the muffin cups and waited a full 20 minutes after the muffins were out of the oven before trying to remove them. I didn't have any problem with sticking. Definitely worth the extra effort.

Good recipe. Like other reviewers I also substituted the butter for 3/4 cup of applesauce. In addition I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I didn't sprinkle any extra sugar on top. Will most likely make again.

I finally found the blueberry muffin recipe I was looking for!  I tried the "To Die For" ones on this site, btu I found those too sweet, not the traditional muffin I was looking for.  These came out perfect.  Only change I made was to not mash blueberries in batter and I only used 2 cups b/c that  is what I had.  These muffins lasted two days in my house.  Yummy.

I just finished baking these and Delicious!  I followed most of the recipe only using a 12 oz bag of frozen blueberries thawed and for the sugar topping, I just sprinkled a little raw sugar on top.  So good! As some other reviewers say, they do stick to the sides. I greased pretty well, and well was so enthusiastic to try them didn't wait the 20 min to take them out. I am making another batch tomorrow!

I didn't sprinkle the 1/4 cup sugar and switched 1/3 cup of flour for 1/3 cup of flax seed and they turned out great.  I used Nova Scotia blueberries from Whole Foods and they were the biggest blueberries I've ever seen and it seemed like too much blueberries so next time I will use less.  Also, I had a tough time getting the muffins out of the pan so I put the muffin pan upside down on top of a cookie sheet, they came out clean so may use the paper cups next time.  This was my first time baking muffins and they were delicious.  It's definitely a keeper!

I can finally make a moist muffin! This recipe is a keeper for me...excellent flavour (I added a few dashes of cinnamon)and the texture of cake instead of tea biscuits. I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of butter for colesterol control, and only 1C of brown sugar (no white).
This made 15 medium muffins..probably because I doubled the blueberries! ;-D

Very tasty. Used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, also thought 30 mins was too long.  Baked for 25 mins and a few burnt on the bottom- will watch more carefully next time.  I will deinitely bake again!  Everyone at my work loved them!

This is the first blueberry muffin recipe I have tried but it was a big hit in my house. 
I used 1 can of blueberries instead of fresh, with the liquid drained off of course. 
30 minutes did seem like I little long for muffins. I don't know if it's just my oven, but mine only took about 22 minutes.

I have made this recipe twice so far (in 3 days) and they just keep disappearing.  They are terrific.  The recipe is forgiving too.  I used cake & pastry flour and substitued frozen mixed berries for the blueberries for a switch and they still turned out great.  I don't have to look for a blueberry recipe again.

These are awesome!  I don't normally like blueberry muffins all that much but I LOVE these and will be adding the recipe to my collection of tried, true and frequently made favorites.  I made mine with a cinnamon, brown sugar, oatmeal, butter struesal topping which made them really sweet.  I put too much better in the topping so my muffins were exceptionally moist and fell apart in my hands but were oh so yummy.

I really whacked this recipe by using cake flour instead of all purpose flour. DON'T DO THAT. USE ALL PURPOSE FLOUR (bread flour may work with its higher gluten content).
I was after a really light and fluffy muffin, thus the cake flour experiment. Big mistake, all purpose flour should yield a nice light muffin! Anyway, creaming the sugar with butter seems key. DON'T skrimp on the creaming, as it adds a real smoothess to the texture. I also substituted Stevia in the Raw for half the sugar. Everything still rose and browned very nicely. Two cups of blueberries seems excessive; perhaps cut them back by a third to a half. My muffins were way too heavily berried; almost like a cobbler.
Anyway, the flavor is just about perfect. I plan to make these again with A P flour, but keep the Stevie - sugar blend and reduce the berries. I'll re-review after that adventure!

Great recipe! No changes, the sugar on top makes the muffin tops nice.  Who doesn't use paper liners for the muffins? Really ! What muffin or cupcake doesn't stick if you don't?  My husband loved them.

These were ok, but IMHO, nothing to get excited about.  They were definitely easy.   I made 18 as that is the yield that was indicated.  They were not big as suggested,  in fact, they were small.  Next time I will only make 12.   The only thing I did differently was use just 2 cups of blueberries and I did not mash any.  Just lightly coated with flour so they wouldn't sink.  I prefer the Blueberry Muffins to Die For, but will try these one more time and only make 12.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, used raspberries and blackberries instead of blueberries (what needed to be used in the refrigerator), added some vanilla, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and made sure to grease the pans well.  I also used butter and coconut oil together (again, just to use up what solid fats I had in the house) + turbinado sugar on the top... and these came out great!! No sticking, great flavor, and full of fruit!  Thanks!

Simple recipe, basic ingredients, no dividing of eggs, and totally tasty. Perfect for sea-level/low-elevation baking. I added chocolate chips with the blueberries and used a cake pan instead of a muffin pan; baked it for the same time at the same temp and followed all other directions. The results are pure deliciousness. Thanks for the great recipe!

The basic recipe is okay. It does produce moist muffins.  I had to tweak a few things for my family though.

1. There was way too much sugar for us. Especially when adding another 1/4 cup of sugar to the tops, the muffins came out tooth-achingly sweet.

2. I used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries instead of 2 1/2.  The muffins still had plenty of berries.  I think with the extra cup, there would have been more berries than muffins.

3. The recipe says to bake for 30 minutes.  My first batch smelled done at 20 minutes.  I went to check on them at 25 min and they were well on their way to burning. Perhaps I live at a higher elevation. Perhaps it depends on the type and size of muffin pan. I don't know.
For reference, I used a 12 cup silicon pan. 

Someone complained that their muffins stuck to the pan and fell apart.
I did not have that problem at all.
Perhaps that individual did not know how to properly grease their pan. I just used a non-stick coconut spray on mine.  If I had used a metal pan, I would have used shortening and then dusted the pan with flour.

These were my first attempt at baking muffins.  It was so exciting.  It was uneventful with delicious, beautiful, wonderful smelling muffins in the end.  I used other reviewers' advice.  I used paper liners and generously greased the tops of the muffin pan to prevent sticking.  Thank you for the recipe!

As a professional baker, I should have known that 30 minutes on 375 was going to be too much. They were so brown. On some the bottoms were even burned. The batter was thicker than any muffins I've ever made before and very difficult to get into the cups.

Quite honestly the best blueberry muffins I have ever had, and that includes anything store-bought. Outstanding. I only got 16 out of it as my batter was quite thick, but seriously, SO GOOD.

I halved this and got 11 muffins out of the mix . . perhaps I have big muffin pans. I didn't have isseus with sticking, really, maybe bc I sprayed the heck out of my paper liners.  They were coming off as I took them out of the muffin tin.  I also pulled out from the freezer what I thought were blueberries--surprise!  No, they were black raspberries, so I ended up with black raspberry muffins instead.  Very nice flavor, and yes, they do end up purple, but oh, well; kind of pretty anyway.  I do like the sugar topping, as it is a nice touch.  I will try to remember to try these with blueberries next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

A few things to note that I found:  The batter was thicker than I would have normally expected for a muffin so don't be alarmed if you find that the case.  Also, don't forget, like I did, to toss the blueberries in a small amount of the flour mixture before you fold them into the wet mixture.  And finally, though the taste is really good, I found the muffins a tad dry, but don't let that deter you from making these as it could have been my oven's issue.  A few very small additions - a little more than a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and few dashes of pumpkin spice, and instead of white sugar sprinked on top, I used cinnamon sugar.

This is the best blueberry muffin recipe. I did make a few changes even though they didnt need it. I added1 tsp vanilla and about 3/4 of a bog of chocolate chips and omitted the extra sugar on top. They came out so good and i plan on making another batch.

These were just 'okay'. Although I followed the recipe exactly, I found these muffins to be on the dry side. They could have used a bit of oil or apple sauce.

I give them 5 stars for the flavor--but only 1 star because they stick to whatever pan you make them in and don't hold together.

The batter was thick, had to use 1/2 a cup of milk. The muffins after 30 minutes felt like they were not done, but they browned nicely. I couldn't fold in the blueberries the batter was so thick. The muffins hardly rose, they stayed almost the same size as before baking. Because I'm diabetic, I used sugar substitute. Could that be the reason these didn't turn out???

This was awesome, I just made this again at the request of my son who previously didn't like muffins. I didn't have any trouble with sticking. I coated the muffin pans with cooking spray for baking (the kind with flour in it). Wonderful recipe, didn't chanage a thing - thank you!!

delicious!  I followed recipe exactly except forgot to put sugar on top but great anyway.  I greased the muffin tins really well and they did not stick at all.  Also I used freshly picked blueberries and mashed up the half cup and did NOT end up with purple muffins this just seemed to enhance the blueberry flavor.

The muffins came out great!!  My mother and son both said they were good!  I did not sprinkle the sugar on the muffins because I feared that it would be too sweet.  They were fine without it.  Thanks and God bless the contributor.

These didn't rise much, and the dough is very dry.  They do have a nice flavor, but are very sweet.  The best part is the crunchy tops.

Absolutely incredible!!!  Perfectly yummy - I wouldn't change a thing!  When I made this recipe, I filled one muffin pan - so, that's 12 servings, not 18 as indicated.  Do make sure, even if you use a non-stick pan, to grease and flour the whole entire surface of the pan - it'll make everything nice and easy in the long run  :)

This recipe was terrific! I really like  that the muffin batter is not overly sweet; it really let the sweet-tartness of the blueberries stand out. Note: this may be my oven, but I only needed bake the muffins for about 20-23 mins, and they were nicely browned on the edges. If I had left them in for 30 mins, they would have been burnt. Overall, great muffin recipe. Will definitely be making them again!

BEST MUFFINS EVER!! I made these this morning and they are delicious and easy. I added some extra stuff. I added 1t of vanilla and a little more than 2 1/2C of berries. I added the last 1/4C of sugar to the berries because they were really tart. I made sure to spray the pans really well, I couldn't wait 20 min. to take them out. I took them out of the pans after 5 min. and they came right out. I ran a butter knife around the edge and they just popped out. In my oven they only took 20 min. to cook. I will definitely make these again and again.

I am not a baker and these muffins turned out great! I did forget to add the extra sugar on top and I didn't have milk, so I used soy milk. The berries I had were fresh, but frozen a few days earlier. I used them frozen and it did not change anything. I did defrost half a cup in the microwave for mashing. I checked on the muffins after 20 min and they were ready, so the 30 min baking time would have been too long. I did not grease the tins, I used liners instead and they peeled away beautifully.

the muffins came out really good- I did not have the sticking to the pan problem that others did.  What I did do what add some lemon zest, and a 1/4 of a cup of applesauce, some 2 teaspoons of oat bran and a scoop of ground flax seeds.  I also replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with some whole wheat flour in hopes they would be more filling.   I also cooked them for only 25 minutes- my oven tends to run hot. Came out great!  So Far my husband has not noticed the added benefits and liked them very much!

I made these muffins last night with frozen bluerries that I happened to have in the freezer.  They came out great!  I scaled the recipe down by half and I added vanilla extract and lemon to the batter.  Friends and boyfriend called them "crack muffins" lol

Very good!  Perfect really!  I used spray olive oil in the muffin pan and was able to remove the muffins immediately after being taken from the oven so we could eat them hot with butter.  (Others had complained of them sticking to the pain, but not this way.)

I made these muffins today because I had some leftover blueberries and it was quite delicious. I did add about 2oz of cream cheese and 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract. I will definitely be making these again.

Very good muffins...mine were done in 25 min. and stood for only 10 because I couldn't hold my family off any longer.  Made the recipe as is except for adding 1/4 cup applesauce as someone suggested.  Great way to use plentiful blueberries in the summer!

Very moist, very tasty, and everyone who had one gobbled them down. I made these with an equal amount of applesauce instead of butter, topped with cinnamon-sugar instead of just white sugar, and found that the batter filled a dozen muffin cups rather than 18 for me-- but woooow! My mom said she couldn't wait for breakfast the next day so she could have another, they were so good! No need to add any butter/margarine to them unless you want the flavor because these already have the moistness on their own. Definitely going to be making this over and over again. Also, mine baked up in only 20 minutes. I sprayed the heck out of my tin with Baker's Joy.

These muffins were amazingly good and so easy to make.  My 4 and 6 year olds loved helping to make (and eat) them.  To mash the blueberries I put them in a ziplock bag between the two of them on the table and told them to pound away!  They LOVED that part almost as much as eating them.  I will definately make these again and again!

I'm giving these muffins 5 stars because they tasted incredible but they were lighter, fluffier muffins as opposed to the denser kind which I usually prefer. but that aside, anyone would love these, they were that good!

Very tasty muffins! I loved the idea of mashing the blueberries
it really adds a lot more flavor to the batter. 
I only got 12 muffins, instead of the original 18. 
Will make again!

Very Good.  These are not your typical blueberry muffin. They are very light and kinda fluffy. I added 1/4 of applesauce like other reviewers suggested and substituted light whole wheat flour for AP. I’ll definitely make these again. Update- I made this recipe agian as a loaf and baked for 55 minutes.  Turned out excellent!

Mmm! Very blueberry-y! I used cream cheese in place of the butter and substituted 1/4 cup applesauce instead of the eggs. Also used whole wheat flour and brown sugar and added just a teaspoon or two of grated lemon rind. Made it as a bread. My dad and brother loved it! Thanks Majorie!

This is one of the best muffin recipes I have ever found! I make them for my church often and I always get complimented on how wonderful they are! I use frozen berries- usually a triple berry- which I think adds a lot of flavor too! These are my staple blueberry recipe.

Mmmmm...yummy! I used mixed frozen berries instead of the blueberries. I used cupcake papers, the berries make the muffins fall apart on the bottom.

Thank you for this GR8 recipe!  The batter is very substantial - nice & dense - and makes great muffins (IMHO, much tastier than the "To Die For" muffins on this website).  They are easy & quick to make. To prevent them from sticking to the pan, I used muffin cups and greased the rest of the top of the muffin pan with Crisco.  This recipe made a dozen (as opposed to 18) when filling the cups to the top.  Be sure to allow them to sit for at least the 20 minutes that are recommended, too.  I altered the recipe by adding diced strawberries vs. blueberries, & used someone's suggestion of adding cinnamon & nutmeg - oh yum!  Lastly, they only needed to bake for 23 minutes vs. 30 minutes.

This is an excellent blueberry muffin recipe. I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh. I just thawed them for about 45 minutes on a plate with papertowels prior to adding to the batter. I also omitted the sugar on top of the muffins. I tried the recipe both ways and I think the muffins are perfect without sugar on top. This recipe is used weekly in my house now.

I've made this recipe twice now, following it to the letter, and both times my muffins have come out perfectly! I use muffin cups and haven't had any problems with the muffins clinging to the paper. Even the resident blueberry hater thought they were delicious! I may try substituting cranberries next time, just to see how it works. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love these! I substituted 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup wheat germ and 1 cup white flour.  I topped with brown sugar, but a struesal topping would be fantastic.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla too. Made in mini muffin cups baked for 12 min.  Very good, will be taking to playgroup tomorrow morning.

These were unbeatable. I used margarine instead of butter, and they were still great. Butter would have made them OUTSTANDING. Everyone said they were better than what they get in the bakery. It's a keeper!

First time baking blueberry muffins and they turned out great!  Added teaspoon vanilla and brown sugar along with white on top. Baked 25 mins. Will make again, maybe with applesauce next time.

These are delicious, with little burst of plump blueberries running throughout. For my mix, I swirled in a dollop of sour cream with my milk, used half wheat half all-purpose for my flour, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white, and sprinkled in some cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg. Next time I'll try substituting applesauce for butter. Yum!

Awesome. My very picky eater said they were "magically delicious." Made a few modifications based on other reviews. Added 1/4 cup Granny smith applesauce and 1 tsp vanilla. Did not mash any of the berries. Made 12 LARGE muffins; baked for 22 minutes.

This is the best blueberry muffin recipe I have tried. I love these! I've made them with applesauce and without. I think both are great. I tried it with the berry applesauce which gave the muffins a slighty purple tint, but really made them moist.

These smelled delicious and were nice and moist, but the taste of the bread was so plain! They were basically good muffins, but if they're not fresh-out-of-the-oven they taste pretty bad

Glad I read the reviews.  Made sure to apply non-stick spray to muffin tins.  I added vanilla and applesauce per some review notes, which helped with the thickness of the batter.  I forgot to top the muffins with sugar until they were about 10 minutes in...it still worked.  According to my son they came out great, so I’ll take it!

These came out delicious soooo good and moist.  I did though add a 1 teaspoon of lemon extract which made it a little more tasty.   I also mixed together cinnamon, sugar, flour and butter to sprinkle on top of some of the muffins..

I used 1/2 cup butter + 1/2 cup shortening + 1 tsp. cinnamon + 1 tablespoon vanilla extract.  These modifications made the muffins delicious and the top crusty.  This was a great basic recipe!

I gave this recipe 2 stars because I didn't make them personally my 14 yr. old daughter did (on my direction) I think adding a bit more sugar as well as maybe 1/4 cup more of milk would have changed the consistency of these. I did have her add a few drops of vanilla.  They had that baking powder or flour taste to them.  They looked perfect though and with some butter on them....I wasn't going to throw them to the trash!!!

I followed the recipe as is it and happy to say it turned out really good. I made 24 muffins all in all. So  I greased the muffin pan generously for the 12 muffins and use baking cups to another 12. so don't have problem  taking it out from the pan.

My family enjoyed this recipe as the muffins turned out moist and flavorful. I did have a little bit of sticking when I used an older cupcake pan (12) but recently purchased a new muffin pan (6) and had no problem removing the muffins after resting 20+ minutes. I added a dash of cinnamon and about a teaspoon of vanilla based on personal preference. The FULL 1/4 cup of extra sugar sprinkled on top is not necessary, but if you want it very sweet, stick with it!

The batter came out very thick and sticky, more like cookie dough than cake of muffin batter, so I was a little concerned when I put this in the oven.
After I got these out of the oven, my concerns were gone.  They look and taste great!  Not too sweet, but nice and rich with the creamed butter.  Even though I had some muffins cups with quite a bit more batter than others, none of the muffins came out burn or partially cooked.
One thing I did slightly differently when I put this together: my stick of butter was frozen, so I had to microwave it to get it soft enough to mix in the sugar and eggs.  Also I tried to smush the blueberries into the batter, but I did try very hard, and I just used the back of a spoon, so almost all the blueberries ended up whole.  The blueberries I used were very fresh.  I imagine frozen blueberries would probably result in a different consistency.

Yes the muffins stuck to the muffin cups and I sprayed them really well with Pam. I halved the recipe. I baked 3 at a time because I live alone.  So today I solved the problem and lined the cups with parchment paper.  They were delicious.

This is a perfect classic blueberry muffin recipe. As others have stated, make sure to let the muffins rest 20 min before removing from the tins. Four stars because these are very good muffins but not “special,” and when I take the time to bake, I want people to rave. :)

Outstanding!  Put extra batter into two mini loaf pans since I only had one 12 muffin bake pan (Baked those an extra 7-8 minutes)  Also added extra blueberries just to use up what I had.  Either way they are absolutely delicious and easy!  Thanks for the great recipe OKBEE

Wonderful muffins.  I took the advise of MommieTo2Boys and I greased and floured really, really good and they popped right out.  Even my fussy husband loved these.

Easy to make and very moist. I made it dairy free so my son could enjoy. Used applesauce instead of butter and unsweetened coconut milk. I also lined the muffin pans because a lot of reviewers said the muffins stuck. Super moist and I decided not to mash the blueberries and just folded them in. A blueberry in every bite!

These came out really good I used A little less than one cup of sugar because I didn't want too much sugar in my muffins since I used a whole pint of blueberries. I had to add a few tablespoons more of milk. But these are the best blueberry muffins. Will definitely make these again.

Delicious!!  I only mashed a few blueberries and kept most whole.  It's an absolute must to grease well and allow a little cooling to prevent from sticking.  They taste great even without adding the granulated sugar on top.

30 minutes is way too long! This recipe made 12 average muffins. Thank goodness I set the timer for 25 minutes instead. Even 22 minutes may have done justice. They started to get a little too golden for my taste. But, great recipe.

These muffins are great! I added some vanilla extract for some more flavor and instead of regular white sugar sprinkled on the top I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon. The bake time says 30 minutes but that is a little long. I think around 25 minutes is better.

I chose this recipe because I didn't have the buttermilk or sour cream that other recipes call for. I made these according to the directions and we think they were just ok. I felt like the muffin was bland outside of the bites of blueberry. The bake time was way too long for me. With 7 minutes left on the timer a few of them were starting to get very dark. Good thing I was watching them.  I don't think I will use this recipe again.

I made followed the recipe exactly and these muffins were very tasty!  However, they didn't hold together very well.  The bottoms crumbled somewhat after taking them out of the muffin pan.  Otherwise I would have rated them five stars.

I use a lot more blueberries than what is called for. I put half of my blueberries in a bowl and smash them before putting them in the mix. Then add whole blueberries that I stir in. This recipe is sooo good!

I GOOFED and forgot to add the milk.  My berries were frozen so I am hoping that they will add the additional moisture and not make them soggy. 

Just out of the oven, blueberries caused them to stick and I had not read the reviews about this as I planned to use baking cups but was out. I over beat the butter and sugar, and the batter which created a crunchy outside and soft delicious center.  I thought the frozen blueberries would make them soggy, but they did not. I will make these again but will pay special attention to preparation.

I chose this recipe over all the others because there was butter in the batter instead of vegetable oil and I wanted that glorious fluffy/sweet/buttery-ness.  Unfortunately, I thought these muffins were pretty bland and had more of a biscuit flavor.  This recipe filled 6 jumbo muffin tins perfectly and came out of the tins with no issue at all after about 35 min.  I might make this again and add some vanilla and/or more sugar to make these more muffiny than biscuity.  Not horrible by any means, but not what I was looking for in a blueberry muffin.

Very good. Made as written with the exception of the extra sugar sprinkled on the tops, as it seemed to me there was already plenty of sugar in the batter. I'm glad I skipped that because I still found them a tad too sweet. I would make again, but would probably cut back the sugar to 1 cup.

Awesome big hit with my grandsons last night.  Followed the exact recipie and since I am a person that loves to bake, I would not change one thing.  I always use muffin papers, no issues at all, you do want to let then sit and cool in pan for about ten minutes, easier to eat as they are so moist, delicious and extremely enjoyable.  The sugar that you sprinkle on top makes a crunchy topping which only adds to the little surprise

I'm not sure why this recipe has such high ratings. These muffins are moist, have a great texture, and I had no trouble with sticking, but the flavor just isn't there. They're actually pretty bland. I'm sure with a little tweaking they could be good, but I won't make this particular recipe again.

I baked at 365 for 18 minutes and it was PLENTY.  My oven cooks everything else at normal temperatures/times but I seem to see a lot of muffin recipes that say to bake too long.  I was a little surprised at how thick the batter was compared to other muffin recipes.  Turned out great though.  I greased the tins, removed immediately and they didn't stick.  I did not want sugar on top so I didn't add it.  Great recipe!  Only giving 4 stars because the cook temp/time as written is just way too long.

I think it was really easy to make , and good for those who likes simple taste . It is really a very useful recipe , I've tried it myself and I could say it turned out pretty awsome , but because I wanted a little more taste , so I added  a few drops of vanilla extract and some spice , but thanks a lot !!!

This recipe was really good. I forgot to sprinkle the sugar on the top but mistakenly put it all in the batter. Don't think it made a difference my family devoured them. I used a cooking spray and had no problem with them sticking came nicley out if the pan.

Other than adding a little vanilla, I made recipe as is at least 3 times, twice with fresh blueberries and once with frozen.  I keep coming back to this one and I am ready to make more right now; this recipe will not disappoint.

These were incredible muffins! I did do what other recommended and used half brown half white sugar, about 4 cups of (whole) blueberries (I picked them myself!), a dash of vanilla, and 1/4 cup of sour cream to ensure moistness. Not only did they come out beautiful (check out my photo!) but they were delicious as well. I filled the muffin tins only 1/2 way to ensure they wouldn't puff up and stick. It made such pretty petit muffins! Would definitely make again.

Pretty good, halved the recipe and followed it exactly. Not too sweet, decently fluffy, and really easy to make. The recipe gave a good proportion of blueberries too. First time I used a recipe without changing anything! 

However, next time I make this I would probably cut out some of the sugar to save calories. And anyways, it doesn't have to be as sweet. I'm trying to appreciate the natural flavor of foods without so many extra things being added in; it would be better to let the real blueberry flavor shine through!

The batter was quite thick, but I didn't do anything about it and just poured it in to very well greased muffin pans. They didn't stick much when I popped them out with a fork. I halved the recipe but I only got 6 muffins out of them when I was supposed to get 9, so make sure to make smaller muffins or otherwise adjust the calorie info

These muffins were very easy to make and the texture was great...light and somewhat cakey inside, with a slightly crunchy outside.  However, they were a bit too sweet for me.  Next time, I would try them with just  1 cup of sugar.  I made them exactly as written and the yield and bake time were perfect.

The problem in part is the water content of the blueberries.  The author wants you to mash some and fold the rest in.  If the batter is too wet or too dry, the amounts of other ingredients need to be adjusted.  

Mine fell after removing them from the oven and were soggy.  They cooked the indicated amount of time and the toothpick test said they were done.  They also stuck to a non-stick pan that had been used a couple of days before for corn muffins with no sticking.  I also prefer the blueberries just folded into a cream or yellow muffin.  These are reddish blue.  Not very appealing.  I would not use this recipe again.

Besides the dough being a little sticky, these muffins were delicious! Very moist, and crushing some of the blueberries was a great idea.

I loved these muffins! It was easy to make and tasted delicious. I read that other people were having a hard time getting them out of the pan so I just baked them in muffin papers so I did not have to deal with that issue. These are definitely muffins that I will be making again.

I just made this recipe and loved it! As per other reviewer's suggestions I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and upped the milk to 1/2 cup. I don't have an electric mixer, so my hands were very tired after making the batter but it is well worth the effort! I plan on trying this recipe with chocolate chips instead of blueberries next time.

Wonderful easy recipe. I used fresh frozen blueberries. One has to make sure they drain the juice after thawing. I reduced sugar and all came out fine. Baking time was spot on. And the muffins tasted so fresh.

Just made these muffins and they look and taste amazing, thank you for the recipe!  I wanted to only fill one muffin tin so I reduced down to 12 servings and it was the perfect amount of batter.  I used one large egg and I did NOT mash any of the berries, I didn't want purple batter.  For those who have trouble getting them out of the pan, simply buy some paper liners for your muffin tins.  I always use liners and never have a problem.

These are delicious!  Taste like you got them from a bakery only better.  The best blueberry muffins I've ever made.  This will be my go-to recipe for blueberry muffins from now on.  Made them two times and both times same results.

My 16 yr old son and I made these today after we went blueberry picking last week. It was our first time making muffins from scratch and these far surpassed my expectations! They are INCREDIBLE...moist and so full of yummy berries. I sprayed and used paper liners based on comments from others and had absolutely no problems with sticking or falling apart. These will definitely be made again and again in the future.
Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I baked these blueberry muffins last night and they were delicious and moist! I used 3/4 cup of cane sugar instead of 1 1/4 cup of white sugar, and added a little vanilla.  To those bad reviews, the fault is not in the recipe... Note:  you don't have to 'smash' some of the blueberries, the oven will take care of that.

These muffins are everything I wanted in a blueberry muffin. This actually was my first time making muffins at home, and this was easy. I did change the recipe by adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and I put flour on my berries before folding them in. I've actually been asked to make these twice because they were such a hit! I do recommend. Also, if you are going to use cupcake tin, use paper liners, so that you do not destroy the muffin when taking them out.

This was my first time making muffins from scratch.  They were incredible. I was able to make 2 dozen muffins and my husband ate a dozen in one evening.  They were that awesome.  I added 1/4 cp of applesauce as another reviewer suggested. I left everything else the same.

These were yummy! I think they could have been a little moister, but they were so quick and easy, I can't complain. They had perfectly crunchy tops, and were so good fresh from the oven. I used mostly fresh blueberries, but found frozen blueberries (microwaved for 30 seconds) to give more juice for the mashing part. I also cut the salt out of the recipe because I used salted butter, used a tad less sugar (cut by about 1/4 cup)and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp lemon extract. I got 14 nice sized muffins. Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out delicious! Wouldn't change a thing. BE sure to grease AND flour your pans just as the recipe said and your muffins will come out nicely, especially waiting the 20 minutes after coming out of the oven.

Followed this recipe almost exactly as it says, but took the advice and used some apple pear sauce instead of smashing the blueberry's, The muffins didn't make it to the next morning, my husband and daughter both ate them and lost count at how many each had.

This is the best blueberry muffin recipe I have found.  The only changes I made were using thawed frozen bluberries, not mashing any in (just folded bluberries in at the end), and reducing total sugar topping to about a tablespoon for the whole batch.  Don't worry if the batter seems too thick.  Use an ice cream scoop to divide the batter between the cups, and as others state, make sure to grease the tin well to prevent sticking.  Cooking spray does the trick.  These are delish!

I LOVEEEEEE these muffins !! I made them into mini muffins, great for the kids or just on the go bite to eat. So tasty :) One thing, a previous post mentioned that they were sticky... the batter was a bit of a nightmare haha. It was super sticky and a bit tedious to get into the muffin cups, but very much worth it in the end!

I havent actually tried one yet, but my son and father in law cant seem to get enough. I had a problem with only one muffin sticking, but the base of the muffins was so soft that when I was trying to get them out of the tins I thought I was going to break them.

Excellent! Added a teaspoon of vanilla and tablespoon of cinnamon for extra flavour boost.

These muffins were very good.  They weren't too sweet or bland, and not too difficult to accomplish. I enjoyed making them. :)

YUM!!  These are great--I used soy milk and milk-free margarine for my son who is allergic to milk and they turned out perfect!  For those who had trouble with the blueberries mushing--just coat the blueberries with flour before mixing.  I also used wheat flour to make them just a bit healthier.

I made the muffins just as instructed, except mine were done in 20 minutes and I forgot to sprinkle the sugar on top! They were still wonderful. I baked them in 2 12-cup tins, so I made sure to put a couple of tablespoons of water in the 6 empty cups so they didn't warp during baking. Thanks for a good recipe!

I've tried numerous recipes for Blueberry muffins and these are the best yet! Reading the reviews , I did add a little more milk and cut down on the amount of berries I used since mine were very plump. Also, I did forgo the extra sugar sprinkled on top. All in all, these were awesome!

Great Recipe.  I did add 1/4 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 because it seemed very dry. Instead of mashing any berries I folded the 2 1/2 cups of whole fresh Blueberries. Yum Yum!!!  My wife and kids ate the whole batch.

These are great, I didn't have butter pulled out cause I just woke up and wanted muffins, so I used 1/2 Shortening + 1 tsp salt like another reviewer said, and it turned out great. I also didn't use muffin pans cause my propane stove is leaking and I don't have a small enough pan for my roaster oven, so I used my 9x9 non stick pan. Also used frozen mixed berries cause that's what I had on hand. Yum :D

First time I've made blueberry muffins. Although my blueberrys "bled" a little, the taste was great. Not too sweet which I really appreciated. I substituted the butter for 1/2 cup apple sauce and a splash of vegetable oil, turned out super moist! I used a cupcake pan so I reduced my cooking time to  20 minutes. I didn't get the "sticking" to the pan issue, but then again I didnt add the "topping" that comes with this recipe. I don't feel that it needs it. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Simply awesome! I did make a few changes. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and I upped the milk to 1/2cup. I also used bread flour instead of all purpose flour. I find that bread flour makes all bread products I've ever made come out better. I also used a non stick pan and PAM cooking spray to avoid sticking and it working VERY well. It only took 20 minutes at 375 in my oven :). I will definitely be making these again! Thanks so much!

These were delish!  The first time I made them, the batter seemed really thick, so I had to add a little bit more milk.  The second time, I halved the recipe but kept the same amount of milk as the original recipe.  I also melted the butter instead of creaming it with the sugar.  Very quick and easy to satisfy a muffin craving with all on-hand ingredients!

Delicious! These turned out brilliantly for my first-ever batch of homemade muffins. Added a generous dash of cinnamon and a splash more milk to the batter, and I didn't quite use all of the flour. Also, I used baking cups so I didn't have any issues with them sticking to the pan. Wasn't sure exactly how much to put in each cup, but I filled them almost to the top and they turned out perfectly.   Thanks! Will definitely make again.

I made these as directed with one change - I didn't have fresh blueberries so I used frozen.  Pretty sure they would taste WAY better with fresh.  My husband liked them quite a bit nonetheless, but I thought they were too sweet and dense.

Question: Is the batter suppose to be so thick, or should I add more milk. I've made (other) muffins before, but the batter was NOT this thick. Anyway, I went ahead and added a splash more milk and I didn't realize that the berries had to be mashed, maybe that's why it was a little thick! They tasted very good! I've never made bb muffins before, so I might try other recipes, but these were good! What's wrong with purple batter anyway???

These muffins are great!  I followed the instructions exactly, and I took the advice of some other viewers to grease the muffin pan REALLY well.  The muffins came out the pan with no problem and were excellent!  My family loved them.  It made one dozen nice-sized muffins.

I think these are wonderful! I scaled the recipe down to 12 muffins (which calls for 1 and 1/3 egg- ha!) and these turned out great. Very moist. When you scale it down to 12, it calls for 3/4 cup sugar, plus a tbsp and tsp. I just added 3/4 b/c I felt the extra was unnecessary. The flavor was still very good!!! I also skipped the sugar on top. I will definitely make this recipe again. I had no problems w/ sticking- buttered and floured the pan very well, even the top part and there was no sticking at all. (I didn't use liners.) The only other change I made was the baking time- mine were done at 25 minutes. Hope you try this recipe; I think you'll love it!

These are wonderful.  I have never made homemade blueberry muffins that I really loved before.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had no problem with sticking in my silicone muffin pan, but they stuck a little in the regular one.

I love this recipe! I went blueberry picking and was looking for a good recipe, and I found it! I have cooked batches every day and all the neighborhood kids have gone crazy for them. I did make a couple of changes though. I used shortening instead of butter because I don't eat butter and I accidentally used bread flour the first time that I made them but they came out tasting so good that I kept the changes everytime that I made them. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe today, it is great it came out fluffy and yummy. All I change in this recipe is the sugar I put in and the amount of blueberries. I put 3/4 cup of sugar instead of what the recipe asked for and I put 1 3/4 cup of blueberries instead of 2 1/2 cups. It came out great . I will sure make it again :).

This was a very easy recipe.  Good taste and didn't have any sort of sticking problems with them.  I didn't, however, use muffin cups so that may have made a difference.  Only used 3/4 cup of sugar and they still tasted fine.  I would use this again, but probably with sour cream and olive oil, rather than milk and butter.

Wonderful and easy recipe! I was looking for something to do with all my blueberries that I had in the fridge. They were great, my husband couldn't even wait until I was able to get them out of the pan! He loved them! Will make them again for sure!

Made a 1/2 batch of these to whip up a quick dessert & use up some blueberries.  The recipe was quick & tasty.  I also added a little vanilla. Yes, they were purple but so what. My kids thought it was great.

I used splenda instead of sugar and added 2 T of honey.  I also replaced 1/2C. of white with whole wheat flour.  Did not use sugar on top.  VERY good.

we added 1/4c of applesauce, 1teaspoon of vanilla and a couple dashes of cinnamon, they tasted awsome.......however, this recipe (even without the added stuff) makes crumbley muffins, they fall apart, you can't really cut them with out having a mess on your plate ect. again they taste really good but i am going to hunt for a different recipe

This recipe was delicious! I typically use the Betty Crocker recipe with streusel topping, but I think this one might be a new favorite. I used blueberries that I had frozen from last year's pick, and they worked well.  Also I didn't need to bake for the full 30 minutes; about 18-20 in my oven worked well.

Wow, these are good.  I added vanilla extract, but don't think it made that much difference.  This is a recipe you can use as written!  Mine baked in 30 minutes, and made 12 regular and 8 mini muffins.

These are fabulous! I added 1/2 cup of applesauce, as another reviewer suggested. They are so moist. I used liners for the pan as I was afraid they would stick. I will make again for sure.

These blueberry muffins are delicious!I recommend omitting the sugar sprinkled on top of the muffin before baking because these little treats already taste like cupcakes and they bake to a wonderful golden color.

It was a great recipe and very easy to follow! I loved the idea of mashing up some of the blueberries; nothing like blue muffins! I did feel that 30 minutes was a tad too long, though! Will definitely make them again.

it's one of the tastiest muffins i've made.  more moist than other muffins i've seen. and the taste is just right! my niece says its better than those sold outside. well, being an amateur cook i'm quite flattered. the only downside i have was, that it didn't rise. maybe my soda was not fresh anymore? but i bought it a mth back and its cap is sealable.

These were very good and easy to make. I had one small container of blueberries left over from something else so had to cut the recipe in half. It still worked out great. It made 9 muffins, but I thought they would have risen more... otherwise I would have cut back to 7ish to make them all a bit larger. Kids loved them regardless and they disappeared quickly!  As other reviewer suggested I did add some applesauce and a small amount of vanilla, Thanks,

I looked and looked for a good blueberry muffin recipe and finally decided to try this one.  I followed the recipe, but added to it to suit my purposes.  I added 3 tbs of sour cream & 1 1/2 bananas along with 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  They came out great!  I usually have butter on my muffins, but did not even need to spread it on they were so good and had so much flavor.  I will use this recipe from now on.

PS. If you are looking to make them more healthy I used Organic Pure Cane Sugar by Wholesome Foods instead of processed white sugar.

Good muffins. A little on the dense side for my taste. I prefer a lighter texture. They took about 27 minutes to bake and were still on the darker side. I got 17 muffins out of the recipe. (Normal size) Thanks!

Great recipie, but I would say that these are cup cakes (very sugary), not muffins. It also suprisingly makes a great frosting.

excellent!
I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough blueberries, and it made nine lovely sized muffins. I used half of the sugar for the topping and it was plenty. Produced a lovely, moist, cake-like muffin. Thanks for a great recipe!

So good!  The only change I made was ommitting the sugar on top, just personal preference.  If you like a sweeter blueberry muffin this recipe is great.

Really simple to make. Don't overdo the sugar. I would judge the amount you put on by eye. I added the applesauce and they came out perfect.

These muffins are really incredible.  I made 6 big muffins and this batch fit perfectly in the pan.  I sprayed it with cooking spray.  I think they needed to cook about 5 minutes longer because of thier size.  I actually liked them because they weren't so sweet.  My husband doesn't like really sweet stuff and he really liked these.  I only sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar on top.  I can't imagine having all that extra sugar, but then again, I liked the little tart taste from the fresh blueberries.

I just got done tasting these muffins and I have to say that they are very good. I would give them 5 stars but I don't think the recipe as written makes them sweet enough. The sugar on top helps that a lot but not quite enough. I wouldn't eat these without plenty of butter for that reason. 

I will be keeping this recipe and tweaking it to make sweeter muffins in the future. I don't like my muffins so sweet like the "To die For Blueberry Muffins" from this site but at the same time I don't like them relying only on the berries for sweetness either.

These muffins are very good they have a nice texture. I always use fresh blueberries never frozen.  Do not over mix.  I did not put sugar on them either which I think would have made them a little to sweet for me.

I made this muffins this afternoon and the end result was very good; although we did find them a bit on the sweet side.  Next time I may reduce the amount of sugar to 1 cup and see how that goes.  The only thing really worth mentioning is that I used frozen blueberries and I made mini muffins (baked for 18 minutes) and both worked out really well.

If you are looking for a healthy wholesome muffin, this is not it!  But if you are looking for a treat-this is the one!  Very sweet and cakelike!  Between 2 adults and 1 3 yr old, we actually ate a dozen in one sitting.  YUM!  Didn't change anything!

I followed the directions as precisely as possible and the muffins turned out great! Though, the texture was a lot more cup-cakey than I imagined and they were a bit bland in taste. It's okay though. Less sugar means less calorie burning later :]

I made these last night and they turned out very good.  The only thing I would do differently is not add the sprinkled sugar on top and less blueberries, but besides that they were good!!!
