Ok - this was a total no-brainer that turned out FANTASTIC.  Hubby liked it so much when I made it for lunch that he asked me to make it again (same day!) for dinner.  Kids (age 2 and 4) both loved it - and since I pre-cook and shred my chicken - it was a matter of taking a bag of chicken from the freezer, adding veggies and soup, making the crust - and in 35 minutes we were eating - for me, less than 10 minutes to actually prepare.  This is definitely a new fav in this family - definitely a keeper *as is*.  Wouldn't change a thing except maybe adding salt and pepper.  Wow.

Personally, I love this recipe just as it is. But my husband and son are fussy about bisquit/dumpling toppings. (true carnivores I guess...)To make them happy, I usually double the chicken/vegetable amount and add milk to the soup to stretch the sauce. Since it's too much for a regular pie plate, I just put it in a casserole dish and it turns out just fine. You really can't go wrong with this recipe!

very easy.  I used Reduced Fat Bisquick and the crust was very light.  My husband who usually turns up his nose at pot pie actually ate the leftovers.

I like this, but will alter it next time.  My family said it had too much batter and not enough chicken or vegetables.

I've made this for years.  You can't go wrong with the "impossibly easy" pies.  I use reduced fat bisquick and fat free soups in mine and it fits in the strictest diet.  Always easy and always good.

This recipe was alright for a quick dinner. It was very very bland. It really needs some spices added and maybe some cheddar cheese. My husband did not like it! I gave the leftovers to him for lunch and he brang it back untouched and got something else for lunch. If you like bland food this ones for you but I will not be making this again!
