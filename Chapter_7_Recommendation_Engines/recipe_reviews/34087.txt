My family loved this recipe.  The children asked for seconds and this never happens.  What a nutritional and hearty meal.  Hats off to Kati

this was pretty good.  Not quite what I expected, and a little too "orangy" but that might have been the brand of marmalade I used.

As far as taste goes, this was great! Somehow I ended up with a soupy consistency (probably my own fault). I swear I used 3 cups of water as indicated. I'll definitely try it again, maybe with some pineapple added...

My husband and I loved this dish, but there's way, way too much water to make a sauce. I had to drain it before adding the marmalade and more adobo. I suggest only using a cup of H2O and adding more later if you think you need it.

We really did not enjoy this much.  I sounded good since I love citrus and chicken, but the flavor just did not do it for me.

This was delicious. I used an Abodo seasoning recipe from AR and left out the green pepper. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star rating is the water. Yes it is too much. I didn't use the fiull amount and still ended up having to add a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up.

I cooked this once and never cooked it again. I didn't like the flavor, it tasted processed...I think because of the jarred stuff.

This chicken was wonderful.  I am new to the kitchen, but when I made this for my fiance she wanted second and thirds.  Easy to make.  Follow the recipe to a T and it will come out good.  If you want it to be sweeter, just add a little more Orange marmalade.  This deserves 5 stars

The flavor was good but the texture was very watery we only put 2 cups instead of the 3 cups I would recommend  using one cup of water instead of 3, it was very watery other wise the flavor was interesting

It was really good. When I made it came out really watery, so maybe just use 2 cups of water instead of 3. I also used cut up chicken tenderloins instead of the thighs and breasts. It was delicious!

Not very good.....I mix the orange marmalade with the best teriyaki sauce money can buy...no celery...and fresh ginger, and green onion. Sesame seeds comes with the teriyaki, it sort of acts as a cork for the sauce...I also use a bit of fish sauce, with oyster sauce.
