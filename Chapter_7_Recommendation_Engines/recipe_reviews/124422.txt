Beef stroganoff is one of my husband's favorite dishes and this is very good. I partially froze the sirloin to cut it thin and then let that marinate in red wine, garlic, and worchesterchire for two hours before cooking. I cooked that then plated it. (no flour) I used a combination of green onions and vidalia (about 1 cup), fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 1 Tbsp. of worchestershire, added some dijon mustard and a bit more minced garlic. After I added the meat back in I reserved a bit of the broth to mix with 2 Tbsp. of corn starch. I added that to thicken then added 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese. I served it over egg noodles - YUM!

This is one of my fiance's favorite dishes and he requests it again and again.  I made a few changes of my own: I reduced the onion to about 1 1/4 and added 2 cloves of chopped garlic.  I also added a small amount (about 1/8 cup) of red cooking wine to the steak and used a package of fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the canned.  Delicious!

Pretty great.  I do recommend the included suggestions of adding garlic and red wine to the sauce and using fresh mushrooms, and with that - yum!

I just think that this recipe is wonderful.  I have made a few changes to suit the taste of my family more; omitting mushrooms, using 2 T. butter for onions and 2 T. butter for browning meat and using only 1/2 of a large onion, diced.  It still tastes outstanding and the left overs are just as great!

This is an excellent recipe for stroganoff, the best I have ever had the pleasure to cook.  I didn't have any Worcestershire in my cupboard so I had to make it without that, but it was quite a delight.  Mary Alice gets my applause.  I think my searching for the best stroganoff recipe has come to a close.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This is good when you want comfort food.  I added a couple of spoonfuls of dijon mustard and used fresh mushrooms.  The gravy got so thick while it was simmering that I didn't need all the sour cream.  Very satisfying and good flavor.

Such a comfort food! Used the ingredients called for, but used different amounts for my taste.  Simmered in red wime before adding the broth and only added a little broth at the time.  Simmered for an hour or so ( adding a little broth every so often) and only added 2 spoonfuls of sour cream.  The consistancy was perfect for me; not too runny or too thick. YUM!

Good flavor and I like the fact that the recipe doesn't use cream of mushroom soup.  I made this in my crockpot (6 hours) and it came out great.

Love the basil! I simmered the meat until tender, adding the sour cream last.  It was so good.

Very good!  I'm not usually one for "traditional suburban" dishes, but I had about 3 lbs. of cooked and sliced London broil to use.  This turned out very well.  Even though the meat was already cooked and I did not use the flour to brown the meat, the sauce was plenty thick enough.  My husband and children enjoyed this.  I will make it again, from the beginning next time!

Thank you so much for this recipe!!  It was fabulous!  The entire family cleared their plates, some had seconds (darn it - less leftovers for me!)  The only changes I made were to saute the onions in olive oil and use light sour cream.  This dinner had terrific flavor and is a new favorite.

I don't know much about beef stroganoff, but my mother raved about this recipe. I thought it was very tasty as well.  However, if you like a lot of spices, I suggest you add your favorites to the recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms and added some garlic as well.  Overall, it was tasty and I would make it again.

I would have given this a 1 star but my husband thought it was OK. I'm amazed at what people rate 5 stars (of course AFTER they've doctored it up). Recipe not worth saving and repeating.

Very good recipe!  I also used about half the onion and fresh mushrooms.   Instead of beef broth I used a packet of dry brown gravy mix made with 1 1/2 cups water.  This was perfect!

My family & I just ate this and it was awesome. I did make a few changes. Instead of Basil, I used Thyme, also used baby portabella mushrooms instead of white and I added red wine as well.

Excellent recipe, in general. I suggest a little garlic salt instead of plain salt, and suggest that the final mixture be simmered on low for at least 2 hours to make the meat more tender.  Will definitely make again. PS: use whole wheat egg noodles, low fat sour cream and olive oil instead of butter to make it healthier!

I couldn't see saute'ing the onions in just the butter. To impart more flavor, I browned the meat first, then set aside. I then cooked the onions, and then followed the instructions from there. Perhaps my onions were a bit TOO large, but I ended up reserving some for another dish. Also, I used fresh mushrooms, simply adding them as called for. Topped with a bit of freshly grated Parm and served over egg noodles, this was a nice week-night dinner.

I tried this on a whim because I didn't have my own recipe with me.  I did add a little red wine and added doubled the muchrooms ( because that's my favorite ).  Added extra Worcestershire and a touch of course black pepper.  It turned out so well - very close to my own recipe and but I believe the sirloin makes the dish vs regular roast meat.  5 stars on this one !!!

My whole family enjoyed this! Thanks- I don't find alot of recipes that both of my kids like, this one was a hit :)  I used fresh baby bella mushrooms that I sauteed with the onions and I added a bit of Wondra flour to the sauce to thicken it (I had used skin milk, it was a bit thin).  My husband said it was the "best beef stroganoff I ever had".

Wonderful Stroganoff, make just a couple of changes, used freshed mushrooms, beef bouillon instead of salt, and added a tps of Browning seasoning sause or kitchen bouquet.  I also let it simmer for 30 minutes, to get flavor moving around.  Thanks for Sharing this recipe Mary Alice, well make again and agin.

We are health nuts so we made some variations to this to reduce the calories without losing the taste. We used bison steak tips instead of beef and light sour cream instead of regular.  We also used Dreamfields low-carb pasta which is probably the only diet food on the market that tastes absolutely no different than the original.  I added garlic, red wine, and fresh portobello mushrooms instead of canned.  The onions were a bit to much so I reduced by about 25%.  This was, as my fiance said, "the best meal I've made in 3 years."

That says something, because I cook A LOT.

I liked this recipe because it was easily adaptable to be dairy-free!  I followed other suggestions to add garlic and red wine, and subbed fresh mushrooms.  If you saute in olive oil or fake butter, and use fake cream cheese or fake sour cream - this turns out great!

Wow!  If I could I would give it a higher rating.  The only thing I changed is I cooked the beef and set aside so it wouldn't get over cooked and I add red wine to the sauce.  I'll say it again-Wow.

So, so good!  I used many suggestions from the reviews.  I marinated in 1 c. cold coffee, 1 c. soy sauce & garlic salt for about an hour.  I added 8oz red wine(Shiraz), Dijon mustard, 8 pressed garlic cloves and then simmered for about an hour.  I didn't have fresh onions on hand, so I used some diced onions (a combination of red, yellow and white) that I had frozen.  I also used Top the Tater Sour Cream because I never have regular sour cream on hand.    Other than those changes, I followed the directions/recipe to a T.  Perfect comfort food!  Oh yeah, I skipped the 'shrooms (ick!) and Worcestershire Sauce (double ick!)  But other than THAT... I followed the recipe to a T.  :)

Doubled the broth, incresed the spices to match and added extra fresh mushrooms, but this is the best stroganoff recipe.  It will be the only one I use from here on out.  It was great!

Really good!  I used ground beef, and it was perfect.  I did add one tablespoon of grainy mustard, and also a few cloves of chopped garlic. Really nice flavor, though it's not the prettiest dish around.  :-)

Good recipe with the following changes:

Added 2 tbsp minced garlic. 

I browned the beef on both sides as the recipe directs and then let it simmer in the broth and other ingredients PLUS 1/2 cup of red wine for AN HOUR. It's too tough when made as the recipe is written, in my opinion. 

Then, I took out about 3/4 cup of the liquid before I added the sour cream. 

Next time I'll add 1/2 small can of tomato paste.

This is a great recipe.  My kids lapped it up and asked for more.  They were even excited about leftovers the next day which is unusual in our house.  The only changes I made were to add 3 tbsp paprika to the flour, 1 clove of minced garlic and 2 tbsp dijon  mustard to the sauce.  This is delicious and an excellent fall meal.

I tried this recipe to make beef stroganoff for the first time. We were pleased with the dinner but the overall flavor was a little weak. Many recipes I looked at call for condensed beef broth or bullion cubes, in the future I will sub the can of plain broth for something more concentrated. I salted and peppered the dredging flour and ended up needing to add quite a bit to the finished product. I subbed 8oz fresh mushrooms (sauteed with the onions) and cut my beef into cubes with good results. I appreciated how this recipe used onions and mushrooms and sour cream like the classic stroganoff I've had in restaurants. I look forward to making this again, thanks for sharing.

I really liked this, as did my very fussy husband (please nobody tell him there's sour cream in it). My 18 year old son liked it a lot as well. Five stars for ease of preparation and pleasing my tough crowd.

While this was easy to make, it tasted more like "Worchestershire sauce stroganoff" than beef stroganoff.  It was very disappointing considering the high rating.  I think that most of the other reviews changed the recipe, I noted specifically the addition of garlic.  Definitely looking for a different recipe myself.

Very good. I used fresh mushroom, beef stew chunks and added red wine. Served it on egg noodles the first night and over rice the second. Great both times!  Wonderful winter comfort food!

I wanted a stroganoff recipe that didn't call for wine, simply because I never seem to have it on hand, and also because my husband isn't fond of the taste of wine in food. This recipe was quite good and I will most definitely make it again, but I found it really depends on your ingredients. 1. A very good beef broth will rock this dish (I used College Inn's Bold Stock, and it did indeed rock the dish) 2. Use fresh, and only fresh. I prefer crimini - I think it lends to the brown flavors of the dish. 3. Worcestershire was perfect to meld the flavors. 4. I was apprehensive about the basil, but was curious, so I tried it. It's not necessarily traditional, but it is mighty tasty. 5. I think a full cup of sour cream is a bit too much. I like to preserve the "brown" flavors, so I'm cutting that back to taste.

Taste was fabulous!  Made 2 changes to the recipe.  2 large onions seems like an excessive amount of onion, so we scaled it back to 1 onion & it was plenty.  We used fresh sliced button mushrooms rather than jarred.  Very happy with the dish!!

Made this for lunch today, thanks, it was very good. Cut the amount of butter way down (I think I ended up using 2 tsp. since I was using a fatty piece of meat). Also, only had about a lb. of meat. Didn't add the onions as I don't care for them.

GOOD! An excellent alternative to tomato based stroganoff or dare I mention cream of mushroom soup. My family loved it. Definitively recommend freezing the meat 15 mins before slicing- the thinner the slice the easier to chew.

This is almost the exact way my mother makes her stroganoff (one of my faves growing up) except she always adds a few tablespoons of tomato paste to the broth mixture and lets it simmer a while, gives the gravy a little more depth and flavor is wonderful.  Great recipe.  Those that said it didn't turn out or "never make again" give it another try maybe just something went wrong, this is so delicious I can't imagine someone not liking it.

Good recipe. My husband loved it. I used thinly sliced round steak (because its cheaper) and it was still tender enough. I used olive oil and light sour cream to cut the calories. Because I didn't use butter, I also skipped the flour (which causes the sauce to thicken) and used cornstarch instead. I would cut back the onion and use lots of fresh sliced mushroom next time. Great flavor!

Good, but not great. As written, this didn't have enough flavor for us. I did use fresh mushrooms instead of canned, which I sauteed in butter with some fresh garlic. I ended up splashing in some good red wine, which added a nice boost in flavor. We liked it, but I won't make again. Thanks :)

Just okay for me and my family. Honestly I think a can of cream of mushroom soup and a scoop of sour cream poured on top of some slow cooked stew meat tastes as good as this recipe, without all the added work.

I make this on a regular basis for my family. Thanks to the wonderful cook who shared. This is one for when you drag yourself over the threshold at the end of the day and can hardly remember your name, let alone what you are going to make for dinner. It's easy and my children AND husband will eat it with a smile. This dish smells divine as it is cooking. Do yourself a favor and try the recipe. You won't be sorry. I do add fresh parmasean (sp?) cheese to the mix when I put in the sour cream.  
**update:  I still make this all the time.  I have found it even easier if you start the wide egg noodles to boil, skip the flour dredging, brown the meat in the cooked onion and butter mixture, throw everything else in except sour cream, and stir in a water/cornstarch mixture to thicken.  Then, add sour cream and noodles and it's all in one pan.  SO EASY and Delicious!!!

I am definitely adding this recipe to my rotation!  My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish.  I left the mixture simmering for about 20 minutes before adding the sour cream to thicken up the sauce a bit.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

Substituted fresh mushrooms (sauteed with the onions)and used low-fat sour cream and whole wheat egg noodles as suggested by another reviewer.  Very tasty!

1/12/19 - made this time with stew beef, followed recipe but added some red wine for flavor.  I forgot the sour cream until after serving and it really adds a lot to the flavor!  The meat wasn't very tender, I would likely marinate the beef next time for a few hours to a day to increase the flavor and softness.  Otherwise, very good.
4/24/2007 - AWESOME!  I made this recipe with some beef meatballs I had in the freezer instead of the steak and it was wonderful - my two toddlers, who don't care for much meat at all, at all of their dinner and asked for more!  This recipe was extremely easy and used things I already had on hand - I even made it the night before and just mixed the sour cream in just before serving.  Highly recommended - I will be making this again!

Very tasty stroganoff. Rich flavor, mellow, the basil adds a nice flavor. Not quite as good as my favorite recipe, but a keeper nonetheless. Very quick from start to finish, less than 30 minutes. The prep took longer than cook time. Thanks ever so much for sharing this gem! I give it 4.5 stars.

This was an easy to prepare hearty dinner.  Left out the mushrooms (personal preference) and the white wine and it still came out perfect.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It had great flavor and was nice and saucy.  The only change I made was to use fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned.  Good Job!  I will be making this one often.

I was looking for a recipe to use some left over pot roast. The family loved it. My son is not a big meat eater but he downed his whole plate.

I loved this recipe.  Unlike alot of strogranoffs, this dish was full-flavored. Basil was a welcome addition. The recipe is already fast to make, but I saved a step by using a seasoned beef broth that already had onions in it.  To cut back on saturated fat, I browned the meat in olive oil instead of butter and used reduced-fat sour cream.  This is the best stroganoff I've ever had.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It was good, it just lacked the kick that makes stroganoff crave-able.  Maybe a hint of ranch mix would kick it up some more?

Delicious!  To cut the fat & calories, I used light butter, nonfat low sodium beef broth and replaced the sour cream with nonfat plain Greek yogurt (I also sub it in dips, on baked potatoes, etc).  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I cut the onions in half and next time, I will tenderize the beef first as others have suggested.  With a few minor tweaks, this recipe is a keeper!

I thought this recipe was fantastic, although I did make some flavor enhancing changes.  Like other reviewers, I used fresh mushrooms.  I also used 2 TBSPS Worcestershire sauce, added some salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to my flour before dreging my meat, and added a TBSP of dijon mustard when I added the sour cream.  I used half beef stock and half red wine rather than the can of beef broth.  Sauteed my mushrooms and onions together with 2 large cloves of crushed garlic.  This was the best stroganoff I've had with the changes I made!!

Very nice.  Family loved, particularly the 10 year old boy.  While I was cooking I thought perhaps the next time I'd cut down on the onions, but the full amount turned out great.  Used fresh mushrooms and added garlic (both sauted with the onions).  I took the advice of some others and added some red wine with the broth.  Yum.

Fabulous recipe! I read the other reviewers' tips before tackling this. The differences between the exact recipe and what I did: I did not use NEARLY as much onion--probably one medium onion at the most for a full batch (I made  half batch since there are just two of us). For the broth, I went with half of what's recommended and used white wine for the other half of the liquid component. I also used fresh mushrooms and garlic. Finally, I jazzed it up with crushed red pepper and cayenne fearing it would be bland otherwise. Turned out great--total keeper!

I thought this was really good! Beef strogonoff was one of my favorite dishes as a kid, and this recipe tasted pretty similar to the one my mom makes. It did seem to be lacking a little in flavor, next time I make it I'm going to add some mustard to give it a little more kick. Overall though, it was really tasty!

This was really great! My grandmother makes a beef stroganoff that is more soupy, and my husband likes the more gravy kind, so he was really into this one! Great flavor, and it came together reasonably quickly. My 2 yr old son even liked it and slurped up the noodles. My husband told me to put this in the regular rotation.

This was soooo good!  I used meat from a leftover ribeye roast.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and fresh mushrooms.  I also cut the onions down by about half and I halved the butter. I also used a 14.5 ounce can of beef broth because thats the standard size.  It turned out wonderful and I will be making this over and over!

This was good. None of the flavors are as strong as what we expected, which was interesting, considering I added more than an entire tablespoon of minced garlic. Mine isn't nearly as pretty as Taste of Home's picture up there, with its pinkish tint and green garnish. The flavor here is similar to Salisbury steak with sour cream, and since we like Salisbury steak, we'll go with 4 stars. Thanks for the recipe!

I have not had Stroganoff in over ten years. I made this tonight for dinner and it was great! Only change I made is that I used 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms and I marinated the beef strips in a bit of Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 cup red wine for a few hours. I think it would have been a five star even with the changes I made. My picky daughter ate seconds, that says it all! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

Best stroganoff I've ever made.  Took some of the prior advice and marinated the thinly sliced sirloin in a mixture of coffee, soy & garlic for about 3 hours.  Also used some beef stock mixture - that combined with the soy provided more than enough salt.  Served ours over rice.

My husband requested Beef Stroganoff to take the chill off an extremely snowy day in Dallas (which is quite a rare thing). I was in the mood to try a new recipe and settled on this one. I'm quite glad I did. It came together easily, thickened nicely (but not too much) and had just the right amount of sour cream so it wasn't over-the-top rich; just nicely comforting on a very "wintery" evening. Thanks for this recipe.

This stroganoff is so good, it is now my favorite!  I made it dairy free by using Tofutti brand sour cream and gluten free by using corn starch instead of flour for dietary needs in our family.  Everyone enjoyed, I thought it was by far the best stroganoff ever!  I will, however, try cooking the meat in the slow cooker next time for an even more tender meat.

My husband gave this a "2 thumbs up!" That's saying a lot cuz he doesn't think stroganoff tastes good .  I sliced a sirloin steak into thin strips while it was partially frozen. Then marinated the meat in 1 c. brewed cold coffee and 1 c. soy sauce and Tbsp. garlic powder.In preparing the recipe I had to add about 1 c. of water to the beef broth, as it didn't make enough of a gravy for the meat. I also sauteed the mushrooms WITH the onions. Served over egg noodles. I hope I get to make this again. It is awesome!!! Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I had cooked leftover steak I needed to use.  So I cooked the onion in the butter and added the flour.   Added the broth and steak and continued on with the recipe.  It was wonderful.  Thank you for the posting.

Made this tonight for my family...minus the mushrooms since no one likes it. This was great! Made a double batch of the sauce and had enough left for lunch tomorrow.

Rating this four stars only because I did not see lots & lots of minced garlic in your recipe  Looked at all the different versions of this recipe & here are my 4 tips:   DO  NOT USE JARRED OR CANNED MUSHROOMS...FRESH IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO!!!  MAKE SURE TO USE LOTS OF WORCESTER SAUCE,THIS MAKES THE DISH!  AFTER THE NOODLES ARE COOKED DRAIN THEM REALLY WELL *do not rinse them*!  YOU NOW HAVE THE SOUR CREAM IN THE MEAT MIXTURE *HOPEFULLY IT "IS NOT" FAT FREE OR LIGHT SOUR CREAM*,  COMBINE THE NOODLES INTO THE MIXTURE,  STIR REAL WELL & LET STAND UNCOVERED FOR A GOOD 10 MINUTES...THIS WILL HELP THICKEN UP THE SAUCE & COAT THE NOODLES. Give everything a good stir once more before serving  ;)      P.S.,  I've been making this for years and each time I do different things to  it...this time I added a splash of hot sauce, some paprika, a splat of dijon mustard, a splash of lemon juice, and last but not least...a good splash of some Cabernet wine! :D    Play with it and make it your own!!!    ~Bon Appetite All~

We have renamed this "happy family stroganoff"  This is the comfort meal in our house, the only thing I added was a little sherry, since that was something my mother always had in her recipe. I think the basil is the trick though.

Pretty darn good. Add mushrooms. You can kind of use this recipe as a base and add/subtract ingredients for different taste.

Finally getting around to this review, this is very good stroganoff! Made as is and also used ground beef, which works well too. This sauce can easily be doubled, ( I'm one of those types that needs the extra gravy )...and can be easily thickened to the consistency you prefer. Fresh mushrooms can be used also. Will definitley continue to use this recipe..thank you (:

This was good, but seemed to be a bit runny. Was great leftovers because the sauce thickened in the fridge over night.

I thought this was good, but a little bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fat free sour cream, because it was all I had.  DON'T!!  It made it too runny.  I will use this recipe again, but I will add additional seasoning next time, and garlic too.

This was great with the basil. I doubled the recipe and served over wheat noodles, I also fried the onions and fresh mushrooms in nonstick spray and used a few tablespoons of oil to fry the meat, it was still great and kept the fat down.

This turned out fantastic. I haven't served it up yet, but I tried a little bit of it after it was ready.....YUM. And no harder than Campbell's Hamburger Stroganoff. I've been a fan of Red River's recipes since I'd checked out their cookbook from my local library. I did add an extra can of mushrooms and a little minced garlic. I'll make this again.

This was really good. I did make a couple of changes to try and make it more like my Mom's. I doubled the worchestershire sauce and added around 1/4 cup ketchup. Mine also needed a little more broth as the beef tended to absorb more flour than the recipe called for. Everyone gobbled it up!

This recipe was just missing something for me.  I did use meatballs instead of steak, but I felt the sauce was too sweet due to the large amount of onion and prior to adding the sour cream I was very nervous about the overall flavor, but the sour cream save it for me, but still not exactly what I was hoping for.

I used Flat Iron Steak and it was very tender, although I did simmer it longer than called for.  Very flavorful and delicious served over yellow rice.

I have not made this in years....Just what I was looking for!  Easy and good, maybe not "good for you". Served it with egg noodles and fresh cracked pepper. Used fresh mushrooms that I sauted with the onion. mmm mmm good.  Tomorrow - gym.

This was good, but not great.  I wouldn't describe as bland, but it is missing just a little something. Also, the sauce was way too thin for my liking.  Instinct told me to reduce the amount of broth, but I always try to follow the recipe as written the first time.  Even letting it simmer an extra 10 minutes did not help.  If you like thick sauce, I would either use only 6-8 oz of broth, or allow yourself a full 20-30 minutes to simmer.  I may play with this, but my search for the best beef stroganoff continues.

My kids loved it and that is saying a lot! I used a little too much broth and it turned out a little too watery but, that was my mistake. It did not seem to take away from the flavor though. Thumbs up all around, this will definitely be made several more times!

Yummy!!!  I added a little bit of garlic salt to my onions while they were cooking.  I also only used 1 1/2 onions (mine were very big).  The basil added the nicest touch!

Cannot skimp on the sour cream.  I needed it for the flavor.  My husband really liked this recipe.  I used ground beef, but think I'd like to follow the recipe's meat choice next time.

I tried this last night with wonderful results!  I did make a customization:  I sliced 8 fresh mushrooms instead of using jarred/canned.  I also added 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic, 1 minced yellow hot pepper (only if you are like me and enjoy a little zippity-do-dah in almost everything!) and 1 teaspoon of dried dill.  I sautéed the mushrooms, garlic and hot pepper with the onions then added the dill at the same time as the basil.  It was awesome and a keeper, thanks for sharing!

This is a go-to recipe for my family.  Only change is that I use fresh mushrooms and add a clove of garlic.  Maybe some red wine if I happen to have some open.

The best Stroganoff I have ever had. My family requests is over and over again. Its very simple to make as well. I didnt make many adjustments. I added a bit more basil but other than that its PERFECT! Dont change a thing.

I am awarding this recipe 5 stars for taste and ease of preparation.  I chose this recipe to use a leftover beef roast for an additional meal.  It was simple to alter the recipe to fit my needs.  I substituted the leftover pan juices for the beef broth.  I omitted the mushrooms for our family's personal taste.  The recipe came out delicious, and I will definitely use it again.

This was OK. My husband and I were both disappointed and thought that it needed something more. We both love spicy foods and thought this was kind of bland. I saw one of the reviewers added dijon mustard to it -- that seems like a good idea.

This is an awesome Beef Stronanoff. I used over a little over 1 1/4 C. of water made with a strong amount of"Better Than Bullion" for the beef broth and I used 2 C. of sour cream and a big can of mushrooms instead of the 4.5 oz. can. I also left out the basil because I could not remember it being in my old family recipe. However I do want to try it next time. I did not fry the meat in flour because I dont care for the flour coating on the meat in dishes like this. I mixed 2 big heaping Tsp. of cornstarch mixed very well in 1/4 C of  cool water to thicken the sauce.However the sauce is to thin so next time I will add more cornstarch to make it thicker because the sour cream thinned it out to much. I love this dish and have never tasted one that was a good as my old family recipe which got lost and forgotten. This taste just like it. Thanks for sharing.

I've looked high and low for a good sirloin beef stroganoff recipe.  I finally found it with this one!  It's perfect.  I just add a little fresh garlic when I simmer the beef.  We eat this up.

I hope this restaurant is still open because this hearty recipe needs to be shared with the world! Alteration: Add cooking Sherry when adding beef broth. Excellent with asparagus.

Awesome. I use beef stew meat that is already cut up in nice chunks I only use 1/2 onion and I don't use mushrooms. Other than that I followed the directions exactly and this comes out perfect. Don't skip the basil it adds a lot of flavor.

This was absolutely excellent! The broth and wochestershire gave this great flavor. I also followed the suggestions to use fresh mushrooms and dijon mustard which really helped add some zip to the sauce.

Now a staple! It took a long time to find a good Stroganoff.  I sliced onions, used 10oz. can of whole mushrooms & cut back the meat to about a pound.  Very easy & very good.  The kids even had seconds.  I served over lightly buttered egg noodles.

Gave it a 3* mostly because the sirloin (cooked this method/time) turned out to be tougher than it could have been, (cooked as a steak). Otherwise, the rest of the recipe was a 4* , (didn't change it at all). Don't know how the toughness issue could be tackled, (less browning and more simmering?).

This dish is awesome! I made it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!! Just one suggestion is cut the meat into THIN strips. When I made it, I just cut them just a little thick, it would've been a lot better if they were thin.

FANTASTIC!  I was concerned as I was out of some of the ingredients and snowed in so no option to get them; but the base for this is so good that it mattered very little.  Can't wait to try it with the 'exact' ingredients.  Substitutions made due to missing groceries: 10.5 oz Beef Broth => 10.5 oz Veggie Broth 2 lbs Sirloin Steak => 2 lbs Beef Bottom Butt Roast Sliced Very Thin 2 Large Onions     => 1/4 pkg. French Onion Soup Mix OUT OF MUSHROOMS - NO SUBSTITUTION Rice\Noodles        => Served Over Baked Potato

Absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe, used about half the onion, and used low fat sour cream. It was absolutely delicious and the sauce was the perfect thickness. Served over whole wheat noodles.

I was thrilled to find this recipe--this is exactly what I think of when I think of beef stroganoff.   My only modification is that I use one onion instead of the suggested two. Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.   I made this once without the sour cream because a family member has a dairy allergy, and it was still delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We absolutely loved this recipe!  I doubled the worcestershire sauce because I knew when I fixed my husbands plate he would cover it in worcestershire so I just saved him the hassle.  I have made several different recipes for beef stroganoff before(this is the first one I've made using sirloin instead of ground beef) but this is now our new favorite.

I marinated the steak in wine and soy sauce overnight and used only 1/2 of a large onion and added 4 gloves of fresh garlic. omitted the worchestire sauce and added a heaping tablespoon of sourcream on top of the individual servings.. Also used fresh mushrooms and sliced them.  This was a very good recipe with the minor changes.

Loved this! Didn't have mushrooms and family not a fan of them.  Used Gravy Master(1/4tsp) instead of 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  due to salt restrictions as well as using no sodium beef broth. Came out so creamy- aroma was wonderful as well as the taste

Great recipe ... I added a splash of red wine, fresh sliced mushrooms (instead of canned), and I also added a tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using fresh mushrooms (which I sliced).  Unfortunately, the end result was way too thin and rather bland.  It was a stroganoff soup of sorts.  I wound up adding a can of cream of mushroom soup, and some onion/garlic powder...at which point the consistency was better and it was more flavorful. I had high hopes for this dish and unfortunately it didn't hit the mark.

I have had my husband always creating a new "stroganoff" recipe from the day I met him, sometimes it was great and other times we couldn't eat it. I was amazed when he found this recipe and made it for dinner one night. It was the perfect combination of all the things that were right in the many versions he made. Thank you so much!

mmm mmm good.  I made this for the 2nd time tonight.  I use half the meat and onions and use a 15 oz. can of broth because we like the extra sauce.  I actually forgot to add the sour cream tonight but it still came out delicious.

Good recipe.  Made exactly as specified but had to add a little more broth- flour really thickened it up.  Next time I will probably grate some fresh Parmesan cheese on top to give it a little more zing, or maybe add a little wine with the broth.

This is an excellent recipe.  With a little advanced prep. dinner can be ready in a snap.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using the basil.  My family does not care for it.  I served it with broccoli, egg noodle and hot rolls.

I make a very, very similar stroganoff to this, using the same ingredients..its simply rich and delicious! The combination of the butter, sirloin and sour cream literally melts in your mouth. Its way better than tomato-based or ground beef stroganoffs. Since I stopped eating meat recently, I have not made this and wonder if there is any possible way to recreate it, we'll see!

Pretty good. I used chuck roast and cooked for about 30 minutes on simmer. Would have preferred it to be thicker so will adjust next time. Also needed to add more salt and some large shots of hot sauce.

So glad to have found this recipe!  I made it during a terrible snowstorm, so I had to use ingredients I had on hand.  I had to use a tougher cut of meat, so I sliced and marnated overnight in red wine - really helped tenderize!  Fat Free sour cream & fresh mushrooms worked really well in this dish for us. We will be making this frequently! Thank you for sharing!

I have made this recipe both "AS/IS" and have added a half cup red wine to the beef along with the beef broth, and either way it's phenominal. I add the red wine when I wnat to make the dish more "elegant" for company. A truly excellent dish!

This was delicous!  I kept testing to see if it had enough salt because I really just wanted to eat it right out of the pan while it was cooking.  I served it on wide egg noodles but next time I think I'll serve it over white rice.  Very good recipe!

The sauce for this recipe is AMAZING.  My only tweak was I added a couple spoonfuls of dijon mustard.  Served over egg noodles, this is super tasty and a new favorite!

Update:  Just tried this again with better steak.  This time, we found the sauce to be bland.  Won't be making this again.  I gave it a five because the sauce was really wonderful.  I used steak from our meat market that was called "Stroganoff Steak" and it never got really tender.  I simmered it in the sauce longer than called for, but it was still tough.  I will try again with sirloin because the taste was great.

Really great! For some reason mine wasn't as thick as I'd hoped, but I used some of the sauce and mixed it with a roux to thicken it and it was delish! My husband doesn't eat mushrooms, so I left them out. I also added a splash of red wine. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Made this tonite for dinner and it was a huge success.  I didn't add the mushrooms since I have those who don't like them.  Quick and easy and oh so good.  This will be made again and again in our house.

Noone in our family likes mushrooms, so left them out.  It was a hit.  Next time I might use some of the other suggestions such as dijon mustard or red wine additions to make this great recipe even better.

This was great beef stroganoff and I highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a great recipe. I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup because that seemed like too much. I seasoned the flour with Emeril's Essence and pepper, added 4 cloves garlic , 1 large onion and a pinch of sugar and 1 tablespoon Heinz Organic Ketchup along with the broth and seasonings. It thickened up beautifully and I had no problem at all with it being runny like some reviewers. Make sure you coat the meat with the full 1/4 cup of flour. I simmerede it about 20 minutes before adding the sour cream.I served it  over extra wide egg noodles garnished with fresh minced parsley. I have tried dozens of stroganoff recipes and this one stands out as one of the best. My husband said MMMMM after his first bite and said how tasty it was. I'm making this my keeper beef stroganoff recipe and it doesn't require planning ahead like the crock pot recipes.Thanks. If you're wondering if you should try this......DO IT!

Great recipe!  I made a few changes to suit my personal tastes.  I used 1 onion instead of 2 and used a few cut up  portobello mushroom caps for the jarred mushrooms.  I also added a little garlic.  I've made this for several groups and everyone loves it!

I was overwhlemed at all the stroganoff recipes and the changes people made to them. I decided to choose the recipe with the least amount of changes from readers...and that was a smart thing to do.  I only added garlic. Great recipe. Family loved it.

This was a solid dinner, great when you really need some comfort food! I basically cut the amount of butter in half -- there is no way you need all that in the recipe!

I have made this 2 times now and the secret for us is to cook the meat longer, for us it was tough if not cooked until tender which definatly was not 5 min. I also cooked this with ground beef for a large crowd and they raved about it! I would not change a thing in the ingredients just add simmering time.

My rating would have been higher, but the only meat I was able to get today was a Top Round London Broil, which was tough, even though I marinated it in Red Wine for a few hours. The sauce was very tasty, and with a more tender cut of beef this would have been much better.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I only had one large onion and thought that it was plenty.  Next time I will also probably cut back a little on the basil as it seemed to be pretty strong tasting to me, and I like spice. Maybe 1/2 or 3/4 tsp would be enough.  Good recipe, though!

This was good. I added garlic and a few other things to tweak to my tastes... but it was very enjoyable. Thanks so much!

Pretty good for a weeknight dish, but my kids weren't as interested as I thought they'd be.  Husband and I enjoyed it, but I felt it to be bland, and in need of some jazzing up.

This was excellent with a few additions to the sauce but before adding the sour cream:  1 tbsp. Bovril beef flavoring (you could also use one beef boullion cube), 1/4 c. red wine, 1/4 tsp. chipolte chili powder and 1 Tbsp. of tomato paste.  I also had to thicken with a flour/water mixture as it was a bit too runny for me.

Made this for first time-didn't have enough beef, for one thing.  I don't like onions much so I used minced onions...sauce was thin so I used the whole 16 oz container of sour cream!  Mixed the noodles in and heated longer to burn off some of the liquid.  I still felt something was missing, so I sprinkled a little cinnamon in--not sure that's what I was looking for, though!  Will try again.

My wife, son (12), daughter (8), and I all thought this dish was rather bland.  Followed recipe exactly as written.  Will not be adding to our rotation.
