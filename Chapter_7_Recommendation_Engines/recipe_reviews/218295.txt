This is a great "take to a picnic" salad.  There are never any left overs.  Anything left in the dish at the end of the meal always goes home with soneone at the picnic. I have to make a double batch so the grandkids will have some to eat at home.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  You can use any vegetables you like.  I have used cauliflower, asparagus, purple onions, jack cheese and hotter peppers.  I always try to use what is in season and freshest, and this salad is always always a hit.  The grandkids even use it as a snack after school.  What more can you ask?

This is wonderful.  I usually go for the sweet pasta salads but this one has changed my mind.  The only thing I changed was I used baby bowties...I just thought they were cute.  I would suggest letting salad set up in fridge for a bit to really get the flavors going.  Love it and making it again tonite!!

This was really good. I did everything as written except I used red bell peppers instead of green because it was all I had on hand. I liked the bit of color that the red added to it, so I plan on keeping it that way the next time I make it. Thanks!

This is my new macaroni salad recipe! It was sooo good! Great to make for bbq's in the summer.. I left out the green and black olives, carrot and pimento peppers. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was yummy. thanks for sharing your recipe

I made this recipe without altering the ingredients at all, and it was wonderful as is.  It was for a large birthday party and several people asked me for the recipe afterwards.  It's a bit different from what we're used to in this area, but delicious.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  Made it for my granddaughter's graduation party & it was a hit!  Tripled the recipe & didn't make any changes other than I added some mushrooms.  Very flavorful dressing.

Made this for an office luncheon (they are my guinea pigs for new recipes - LOL) and received nothing but rave reviews from EVERYONE (40+ women)!  This is a refreshing change from your normal run of the mill pasta salads.  After my success at work, tried this out on my family and WOW!  It's now added to the family recipe book - LOL

I made this for a cookout last week.  I used green salad olives (which have pimento) instead of the chopped pimento. Everything else was same as the recipe. I think I used too much macaroni since it wasn't as creamy as I would like but that was my fault.  There were compliments on this at the cookout.

I was not a huge fan of this pasta salad :( Too mustardy maybe? Maybe it's just my personal taste, but something just didn't click for me...

Made this for a cookout last night and everyone that tried it LOVED it.  It is just something totally different from any pasta salads I have tried in the past.  I doubled the recipe and the only changes I made were I added a bit more mayonaise and sugar only for personal preference.  I will be making this again soon and I want to add some diced ham next time.  Thank you Lisa Anne for sharing your family recipe, Chicago Macaroni Salad was a hit here last night in the Carolina Lowcountry.

Very tasty. I substituted half a red pepper for the pimento pepper. It tasted like deviled eggs to me which are amazing. Loved it and a 7 yo loved it that doesn't like mustard.  It's a favorite!

A definite staple for potlucks.  Made a double recipe with one and one half the dressing.  Don't need the extra calories!

I only added half the mustard and it was still way too mustardy.  I found another recipe on line that had a dressing that was just perfect.  Giving this 3 stars because the mix of ingredients in it was very good - something I'd never thought to do - add olives to Macaroni Salad but the dressing is totally wrong for me.

I was so excited to make my first pasta salad, and this recipe turned out great! I made a few slight modifications to accommodate my preferences and/or what I had on hand: Used red instead of green bell peppers, added sweet yellow corn, more mayo and less mustard, sweet relish, and no sugar. Also added cottage cheese. Oh, and I lightly steamed the broccoli first.

This is incredible. Ive made this twice, just this week alone. Its a great addition to many meals and overall easy to make. I made it without the pomento peppers. Made no difference. I found that I prefer to make it with more than what the serving size calls for in the veggies and cheese because i like the mixture of flavors more than noodles.

I made this salad for a recent camping trip. I was surprised by how mustardy and plentiful the dressing was and was worried that it was too much. I got many compliments on this dish however. It's a winner for people who love mustard.
