When I decided to try this recipe I already knew that it wasn't " coq au vin" - cream and cheese and tomatoes do not belong in that dish. But it looked interesting enough, so I gave it a go. Sadly, it just doesn't stand up to the classic. I missed the celery, the tomatoes did not add much, and I did not enjoy the combination of the cheese with the chicken.
I think I will stick with a more traditional recipe.

I sort of knew all along that this receipe was going to be really good. I got a bit confused which the receipe called for chopped onion and stated to place the sliced onion on the top. Nonetheless, I jump right over that insignificant hurdle and made it to the finish line. I added the reserve liquid that the receipe wanted to split away in the very begining because I don't believe in wasting something so good tasting. I am serving mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. This receipe is a WINNER!

Very, very good! A lot of steps, but well worth it.  My house smelled like an expensive French restaurant, and the meal tasted like it.  Thank you!

Delicious, and not that difficult to make. I did cook the onions with the mushrooms, though, and then added them both to the chicken.  This is very rich, so I served with butter & parsley egg noodles and a salad.  I took half of the dish to a friend and got rave reviews!

I left out the heavy cream and cheese based on some other reviews and more traditional coq au vin recipes. I also dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper.  The end result was AMAZING!
I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the cream and cheese actually take away from the recipe rather than adding to it.

This recipe was so delicious.  I have never made chicken thighs this good. It takes some time to cook but it is well worth the wait.  I served it along side mashed potatoes and asparagus as suggested.  I think it would also go great with some pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

In our new home in France, I wanted to serve last night's dinner guests a French meal and chose this recipe. Since the French traditionally marinate the chicken for 24 hours I did the same (in a 1/2 bottle of red wine, French herbs instead of Italian, garlic & minced onion). It was amazing. My English guests raved and had a second helping. The additional wine was needed for additional sauce to be sopped up with the fresh baguette I served with the meal.

I honestly didn't expect to like this. I can't stand mushrooms, but went by the book on this recipe anyway. My first bite I was completely shocked, the combination of flavors worked perfectly. The taste of mushroom blended right in, and even the mushrooms themselves weren't as foul tasting as I normally find them. I screwed up telling my daughter there were mushrooms in it, because she immediately stopped liking everything. I served with buttered noodles. I will definitely be making this again.

I did change this slightly to reflect a healthier/lighter diet. I used chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs and mine were big, so I tenderized them slightly and cut them into fourths. I used my own homemade italian seasoning. After I browned the chicken, I then browned the garlic (I did increase the garlic to 4 large cloves) with the onion and mushrooms before adding the wine and cream. I cut the cream down to 1/4 of a cup and I used fat free half-n-half. That was all it really needed just to give it that flavor without too much extra calories. I folded in the chopped tomatoes and let the sauce reduce over medium high heat for about 20 minutes before pouring it over the chicken, which condensed the flavor and eliminated the need for the cornstarch. I served this with Out of the Hat Rice and steamed veggies. There were no leftovers.

I'm not wild about using chicken thighs because they don't have much meat on them so next time I'll use chicken breasts. I used half and half in place of heavy cream. This was very good, I liked the sauce, and I will make it again. I did think it needed salt.

AMAZING dish!! I made it for a dinner party last night, and my guests were practically licking the plates. The only thing I"ll say is that the recipe said it made six servings, but it was really only enough for four people.

This was awesome! The sauce was so good I served over pasta to make sure I didn't waste any. I used chicken breasts that I pounded thin instead of thighs (I HATE chicken thighs!). I also used 1 can of stewed tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh. I cut the cream down to 3/4 of a cup and it was PERFECT. This was rich and filling and absolutely delicious, I will make often!

I'm sorry, for us this was just an ok pasta dish.  A bit on the bland side and needing more sauce.  Not bad, but I'll keep looking for a better one.

Excellent recipe.  I used a pint of home-grown canned tomatoes (no salt) instead of fresh and that worked well.  Also I added the onions with the wine stage to allow more cooking time.  I did not drain off half the original liquid, because you can't have too much sauce.  A definite remake in our house!  Thanks CLWEST 47!

I used 6 boneless skinless thighs and two boneless breasts.  I followed the recipe except I cooked everything on the stove.  I didn't have the cheese but I don't think it needed to be in there.  Delicious chicken.  Thank you.

Amazing! Followed recipe exactly, except I used chicken breasts and red wine as substitutes. Turned out great! I just finished the left overs for lunch and it tastes just as good today :) thanks for sharing.

Only one star because the chicken did get cooked and the mushrooms tasted really good, but otherwise, it was a lot of work for the blandest chicken I've ever had - absolutely horrible.

This was absolutely amazing!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and added just a touch of flour instead of cornstarch but all in all was a huge hit!  This will definitely be made again very soon.  I don't know why some people complain that it isn't like the "original".  Of course it isn't, it states that.  I am the type of person that always makes addition or changes to recipes to suit our tastes so trying stuff like this is fun for me and I am so glad I did.  **Edited to add that I have now made this several times, and even for company, and always get rave reviews!  If it didn't take so long it would be in my regular rotation but with 3 kids and a job this is definitely a special meal.

A fantastic and simple recipe - that captures the essence of Coq Au Vin.  

You can even replace the mushrooms with a can of cream of mushroom, if you are finicky about the texture of mushrooms.

I used more Gruyere - and avoided the cornstarch altogether.  As opposed to using a starch thickener... I just reduced it, and add more wine and cream.  I also was more aggressive with the browning of the chicken....which led to a richer taste as the crisp skin balanced out the gruyere a bit.

All in all a great and forgiving recipe!

Didn't expect to like this because it is so NOT a true coq au vin.  I was in a bind to make something interesting with limited ingredients available.  I LOVED this.  I had the chicken,  onion and garlic but that was it. I used half merlot and half madeira and used canned tomatoes.  Did not add the cream or gruyere.   It was already very fatty (as a coq au vin should be anyway) so I don't think the cream and cheese are really necessary but I may try it!  Served with mashed potatoes and garlic broccoli, though I also think it would be nice with rice.  
THANKS!

Although not authentic, I thought this was an easy, tasty recipe.  I made just minor changes:  used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh; doubled the garlic; sauteed the onion along with the mushrooms; omitted the cheese.  The leftover sauce was even delicious over noodles the next day!

LISTEN UP! This version of Coq Au Vin is AWESOME. I was excited about making it. Seasoned chicken with italian seasoning and put in skillet with olive oil and garlic. Added mushrooms (sliced) and fresh tomatoes and was surprised what a wonderful gravy this mixure produced.  I used 1/2 cup of burgundy and let simmer.  Transfered chicken to a cassorole dish and topped with about 1/2 cup of RED onion.  Added cheese (1 cup) and cream to gravy OMG it smelled so good and about 1tsp of corn starch, Don't let the sauce get to thick pour over chicken and bake for 30 - the aroma from the kitchen filled the house. Served with garlic mashed potatoes (from this site) and steamed mixed veggies. My 9 yr old son ate like a 29yr old man LOL he  couldn't get enough - My Hubby wants this dish in monthly rotation.  THANKS CLWEST FOR SHARING!!

Absolutely fabulous!  I made it for the first time for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  The only change I made was I used chicken breast instead of thighs, not a biggie at all.  Easy to prepare, and everyone thinks you slaved all day!

Highly recommend this one!!!!

This was absolutely awesome!  I would definitely make this again.  I added more garlic, more red wine, and more cheese.  I cooked some rice and steamed green beans as sides.  Excellent!

This was very tasty, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead and covered with foil when it was time to bake it. Looked very impressive when plated. 2 and a half hours seems like a long time to cook a meal, but it was well worth it.

I have made this dish several times now, and my family goes nuts every time. This is a very time-consuming dish, but if you get everything prepared ahead of time, it goes quite smoothly. We have tried it with both bone in and boneless thighs, and don't really have a preference. The boneless ones allow my teenage son to wolf it down faster, but I'm not sure that's a bonus! Don't be discouraged if it seems very difficult the first time you try it, just make a written list or a mental note of what is taking a long time that you could have prepared beforehand.

I used chicken breasts and I cooked the onions with the mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be using this more often. Even my picky kiddos enjoyed it and asked for more. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.

I can not say enough good things about this recipe!!!!!!  I made it for my family and even my son, who HATES mushrooms, liked it and my mom loved it so much she actually licked the plate!  ;)    And don't be turned off by how long it takes to cook -- its actually very simple to put together, you just have to do a little something to it every now and then and it is WELL worth the AMAZING results!!!    This was so good I'd like to make it regularly so plan to try the cheaper mushrooms (portabello's are expensive!), use chicken breasts instead of thighs (to try and cut some of the fat) and because there was a TON of extra sauce, next time I'll serve it over egg noodles.  Is tomorrow too soon to try it again? ;)

I followed this recipe pretty much as written, except I added a bit more cheese.  It was good, but not spectacular.  I'm not sure the attention it required was worth the result.

It was good, but not to die for as I was hoping. For as much work as I put in I thought it would be so amazing I would want to eat it all myself before even serving. I possibly will make this again, just throw my own twist to it. thanks though!

To die for! I don't even like chicken very much, and this was soooo good. I could have eaten a whole bowl of the sauce and mushrooms by themselves. Will definitely make again.

Rather impossible to not taste good, but it failed to really taste great.  It was overpoweringly creamy... and not much else.

My fiance made this and it turned out really well. Great dish although definitely on the heavy side. It is worth all of the time and effort.  Turned out nicely even though we used a really cheap burgundy wine.  Also good as leftovers.

I made some significant changes as I made this for 70 people. I switched to boneless chicken and cubed it. I prepared it in very large skillets, and then transferred to a roaster which allowed me to regulate the temperature very well. In the roaster, it did require frequent stirring, but I cooked it for 2.5 hours at 275 & it was perfect when served. I used baby carrots and Au Gratin potatoes as sides.

My husband made this and followed the recipe exactly. Thank goodness he doubled everything because it was so delicious and tonight we can have the leftovers. It certainly is not the traditional coq au vin recipe, but it is so yummy that it doesn't matter.

We were celebrating a trip to France with friends and I made this recipe for 12 using skinless and boneless thighs.   My guests absolutely loved it...nothing left on any of the plates.  I served it with bake at home French baguettes.  It far exceeded expectations.

This was a hit with the family (6 of us). A definite keeper. I did some research and saw there are many variations, for example: red wine vs. white wine, and so on. Julia Childe had an interesting version...that's up next.

I made this last night, and what's GREAT is that it's fairly simple.  The only thing I might change is to use less of the heavy cream.  The sauce / liquid that'd been simmering for hours (made up of the olive oil, red wine, garlic, spices, tomatoes and portabella) was delish, but when (per the instructions) I covered the dish in the heavy cream/gruyere sauce and baked it, I lost a lot of that flavor.  I think this recipe is excellent - however - as a very simple base, and I would just add salt and the gruyere/cream mixture to taste / to your preference.

It does say Coq au vin " MY WAY". So I wasn't expecting a traditional recipe. That doesn't mean it's not good. It was fantastic! Best part about it is that my kids have celiac disease, and this is gluten free. No evil wheat flour. Awesome. Five stars for something tasty that we all can eat. Nice job.

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavors were great, but the chicken was overcooked. It wasn't tender at all. If it had been, this would have been a 5 star recipe. The flavor was wonderful.

best recipe i've ever tried (i haven't been trying my hand at cooking all that long) but it's still an AMAZING meal.  tastes like you're a culinary expert, but really any schmo who is a shade above mediocre in the kitchen could handle this meal.  tastes amazing.  absolutely my favorite.

I thought this recipe was a good start.  I think bacon would be an excellent addition to this dish or a prosciutto to be more European.  I used a smoked Gruyere cheese and that was nice I thought.  I hated to drain all the liquid off of the chicken because then you also lose the spices you have added.  I think next time, I would drain all the fat and just add some additional Italian seasoning to make up for it because the fat separated from the sauce and looked unappetizing.  All in all an excellent and unique dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious version of the Coq Au Vin!  My family loved it and there were not leftovers!  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

This was delicious, lots of work. I used baby bellas instead of portabellas. The store I shop at only had huge bottles of burgundy, so I used a red wine I had on hand. The only thing was my sauce was a little runny. Which is strange since I added more cheese then what the recipe called for, I did use the cornstarch. Maybe I will increase the amount next time. It tasted great the next day as leftovers, I served mashed potatoes and green beans.
