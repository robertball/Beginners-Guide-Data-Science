Wondeful and healthy.  I used pinto instead of kidney beans as I've read pintos have more nutritional value.  I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and added two teaspoons of diced garlic.  I cut the cumin to avoid the "chili" comments a few had shared.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I served this over brown rice, again because it's a whole grain, and it was so yummy.  Great recipe that you can throw together in a few minutes and allow to cook all day.  I did 8 hours on low and then it was on warm for about 2 hours.  It was perfect.

Excellent- I was so happy with the way this turned out!  I used 2 cans of tomato sauce, one can of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of beans (non-drained) and one additional can of beans (drained).  Don't add the water- let the liquid from the beans and the tomatoes be the broth!  I cooked this on the stove in a big pot in about an hour and a half- no problems.  Also- wait to add the cabbage until you're about halfway done, and definitely add about a full head of cabbage.  This was great and we will be enjoying this again- thanks!

The soup was very tastey. It does remind me of a thin chili. Next time I beleive I will only use two beef bouillon cubes. I also learned you may want to add cabbage half way through cooking time. So it is not over cooked.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!!! I've made it over and over again since I first stumbled upon it, and my whole family loves it. I'm giving it 5 out of 5 stars because it's a great concept and it lead me to a new family favorite; but in my opinion it needs a few adjustments. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and we found it to be a little overpowering. Since then, I make it with the following changes: I use half the cumin, half the pepper, one 16 oz. can of kidney beans, one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, two 14 oz. cans of chicken broth, and no water. I also added 1/2 tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder. This suits our tastes much better and makes the soup alot less chili-like. I also leave out the oil because I don't see a need for the added calories/fat, and have found that leaving it out doesn't take anything away from the soup. To make this recipe in alot less time: Fry the hamburger and onion in a large soup pot until browned, drain, and put back in the same pot. Add all of the other ingredients to the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to med-low and cover with a lid. Simmer for 1/2 hour to 45 minutes or until the cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally. Serve and enjoy :)

We really enjoyed this soup. It tastes a lot like the cabbage beef soup at Shoneys restuarant. My husband had never heard of cabbage beef soup before, but he really really loved. I did add some garlic powder when frying the meat, and I also cut up some celery and dropped it in as well.

My husband and I both loved this soup. I only used 2 cans of tomato sauce and substituted the third can with a can of diced tomatoes. I did not add the water at all and did not drain the beans. It made a thick flavorful soup which I cooked in the crock pot.

Chili beans were a hit in this recipe.  I also used beef base instead of cubes to cut down on the sodium.  Ground turkey made this even lower fat; a great way to add some cruciferous vegetables to your diet!  Healthy and delicious!

This did seem a bit like chili with cabbage in it.  I used ranch style beans and black beans as well as a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and 16 oz. of tomato sauce.  I added garlic to the beef and reduced the cumin a bit.

I made this last night in the crock pot and it was delicious!  I added polish sausage, and used lean turkey vs. ground beef, 2 cans of light kidney beans, 2 cans of chopped tomoatoes, some fresh garlic clove, garlic powder, season salt,  and I used an entire head of chopped cabbage and put the cabbage in last so that it would not get over cooked.  I also did not add the water, because cabbage produces water when it cooks.  I am giving this 5 stars because it was very flavorful and healthy using the ground turkey and light ingredients.  I will post pictures.

I left out the salt and cumin.  Because it had bouillon cubes and canned sauce and beans,it already had plenty of salt.  The cumin made it taste like chili which was not what I wanted. Overall it had a nice color and taste.( Use dark red kidney beans for color ).  I also served with chopped cilantro .  Those who like cilantro thought it a fantastic addition. This is a low cost and satisfying meal. If I make it the day before..any fat rises and solidifies on top and can easily be removed for a low fat meal. Great with cornbread.

This is nice hearty soup for a cool fall day.  Even though I didn't use cumin, it still tastes like chili w/cabbage to me.  I used a lot of the suggested modification:  2 cans of tomato sauce, can of diced tomatos-not drained, a little minced garlic.  My bullion cubes were about 6 years old, so I used a can of beef broth instead.  I browned the beef and added all to the crock pot about 7 and it was on low all day until we ate at 6.

Made this again today (04/25/10) as we all just loved it.  I now call it my Stuffed Cabbage soup as I have also thrown in some leftover rice--1/2 to 3/4 cup.  And with the Paprika and other seasonings it really does taste a bit like stuffed cabbage.  I always saute onions (usually add celery too) until a bit of browning occurs then add the beef.  Once the beef is drier and brown I add the paprika and cumin and let them toast a bit before adding all the liquid.  REALLY GOOD!!!!  Just made this for dinner on a rather blustery spring day and it was very good.  I made some changes like adding 3 carrots chopped, a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, 1 14.5 oz can tomato sauce, 1/2 to 1 tsp basil, 1/2 to 1  tsp oregano, 1 tblsp sweet paprika, a few bay leaves, 1 tsp garlic powder (didn't have fresh) and a good sprinkling of cayenne pepper as we like a bit of zip.  Also used Jamison's Beef soup Base and about 18 oz of beef stock.  I then rinsed the tomato and Bean cans and added that water to the pot,--super thick and smokey delicousness.  Hubby had two big bowls!

I've made this delicious soup since 2007. I really liked the cabbage beef soup that Shoney's offers on the buffet & so used this site's great tool to type in ingredients you're looking to combine and to my great delight this recipe comes up AND a review mentioning this soup tastes like the Shoney's soup!  JACKPOT!  I took the reviewers suggestion of adding celery to soften up the flavor and also thought, hummmm, some chopped green pepper would also be nice & the soup turned out Yummy! I love this site!!!  P.S. I also found others suggestions great - to substitute beef broth or stock for the too salty bouillon cubes.

Yummy! I didn't think it would turn out so delicious. I always have hesitations when I look at the ingredients and see things we don't normally eat. Or I question how well they mesh. If you are the same way, make this recipe. It was so simple. Easy clean up. And the best part, my kids liked it. Sidenote: I cooked on high for four hours. Temp is too hot, it browned the beans and some of cabbage. I would suggest cooking on low for 6-8 hours. I also used 15 oz. tomato sauce. It needs 24 ounces.

Started this from memory, so had a few changes.  (I had looked at a similar recipe prior to making this.)  Don't think my changes were enough to change the basic recipe.  I had already chopped green peppers, onions and celery and had them sauteing in butter before I could get my daughter off the computer long enough to let me check the recipe!  I used a quart jar of my canned crushed tomatoes  and 1 can kidney beans.  (What I had on hand.)  Used bullion granules and left out the salt.  Other recipe called for 2 cups cabbage.  REALLY glad I used the 5 that this recipe called for!  May try 2 cans beans next time, but hubby and I think the cabbage is the star in this recipe. (He didn't even know he likes cabbage!  He does now! LOL)  Left cabbage a little crunchy, and it was great!  I also did this on the stovetop rather than the slow cooker.  My 12 yr old picky eater wouldn't even TRY it!  (Typical!)  My 9 yr old had 2 bowls and came back for a 3rd and 4th later!  Hubby and I had 2 BIG bowls each!  Absolutely delishes!!!!!  Thank you for a great recipe!!!!!  Edit:  I made this again without the green pepper and celery.  Must say that we liked it much better with the original changes I made. Still an excellent recipe as is.  Just adjust to suit your families tastes.

The best slow cooker soup I have ever made.  Thanks for the recipe.  I pretty much followed all the directions but used ready made beef stock with roast onion instead of stock cubes.

To up the vege content, I added frozen peas and corn in the last 4 hours of cooking time.

The cumin added a unique taste and I amped it up with a dusting of chilli powder.

I am going to make this again and again.  Hearty, wholesome and healthy too.

Fantastic soup, one of my favorites on this site! Very adaptable to tweeks. I do not use the oil when cooking the beef and onion and I do add 2 cloves of garlic to the mix. I use beef broth instead of water and thus do not use the bouillon, a 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes crushed well instead of tomato sauce and include a stalk of celery diced. I like it cooked in the slow cooker and do so for about 3 hours on high. When the cabbage is tender I adjust seasoning to taste and add a little bouillon then instead of salt for a deeper beef flavor. I like the flavor the cumin adds but I don't think it tastes like chili because to me chili needs chili powder. Another plus about this soup is that it freezes well.

This soup was awesome - my husband couldn't believe how good it was and healthy too!  My mom stopped by and had a bowl and now she wants the recipe too.  I like that it is made with tomato-based broth instead of chicken broth.  My changes: Instead of kidney beans I used black beans (I had them on hand), I subbed spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce (once again what I had on hand), and added some chopped sweet red peppers.  It turned out thick, filling and delicious!

Pulled this together with what I had on hand.  Used one 15 oz. can tomato sauce and chopped 3 plum tomatoes, 1 can pinto and 1 can black (our favorites), substituted beef broth for the water and bouillon. Used a whole onion.  Followed previous suggestions and cut the cumin down to 1t, used 1t of garlic powder, and chopped a whole head of cabbage.  Looking at some similar recipes I added 3T apple cider vinegar and 2T sugar at the end to improve the flavor.  Last thing, I would definitely put the cabbage in at the very beginning.  It cooks perfectly and melts in your mouth! Yummy.

My husband said this was the best cabbage soup he has eaten! I did use 1 can kidney beans and 1 can ranch style beans. I also forgot to use the cumin. I seasoned my ground beef with season all and I used 1 whole onion chopped. My kids and I also loved this soup! Will make again! I also added a can of diced tomatoes and pressure cooked it for 3 mintues. This was a 20 minute meal for us!!!!

Ohhh, is this good!  I don't change recipes normally, but I had already cooked down a chuck roast (in water) and cut it in pieces.  I was going to make a vegetable beef soup, but at the last minute I thought I'd check my saved recipes and found this.  I had a cabbage that needed to be used up so I made this.   Like others I did not use the cumin - we just had chili so I didn't want the soup to taste like that.   I had only a small can of tomato sauce, but I had plenty of stewed tomatoes I put up this fall.  So I used them instead but I'm positive the soup would taste just as good using the tomato sauce as written.   I added the cabbage half way through.   It is so good and so nutritious!   With the tomatoes, the beans and of course, the cabbage it's very good for you!   I recommend this to anyone and everyone.   I am bringing some to my mom and to my sister to try; I know they'll love it - I'm so sure they'll like that I have printed off the recipe to give them when I give them the soup!   Thank you for this delicious recipe!   (it's a very easy soup to make and is very "forgiving" to changes you may need to make based on the contents of your pantry!)

Love this recipe. I had to change a few things like, black beans instead of kidney beans.  A handful of carrots. I had no cumin, but I added about a TBSP of cayenne (I love spice) I added a can of corn and about 1 TBSP of fresh parley and 1 TBSP of cilantro. I took the advice of previous reviews and didn't add the cabbage until about 2 hours until I needed it to be done. And yes this recipe does taste like chili with cabbage...but without the quilt of eating too much red meat and eating healthy filling vegetables.

Great and simple recipe! I slightly modified it by using two chicken breasts (which I lightly seared for ~7 minutes before adding to the slow cooker), and I used 12oz tomato sauce and 12oz chipotle sauce which gave it a HUGE boost of flavor. I also put the cabbage in after 6 hours so it was only in the cooker for about two hours which made it not soggy at all. I'll be sure to make it again!

My husband loved this. I added 2 cups more water as we like our soup a little more juicy. I also added a dash of Worchestershire and a tablespoon of crushed red pepper for a bit of zing and spice. I just made our second pot of this last night. A big 2 thumbs up for this cabbage soup recipe. The best part about it, it's even better the 2nd day.

This was Excellent!! I did however make some changes. I used ground Turkey, 1 can Kidney beans, 1 can Garbanzo beans, 3/4 cup Matchstick Carrots, 32 oz low sodium beef broth instead of bouillon cubes, 20 oz tomato sauce, 14 oz of chunky tomatoes, i originally used 5 cups of cabbage but half way through eating the soup I added more cabbage. So next time I think I would do like 8 cups of cabbage...

A comforting and filling soup!! Yummy!  I did want to note, however, that this recipe with fill a 6qt slow cooker to the brim!  If you have a smaller slow cooker, you'll need to reduce the recipe proportionately!

This was very good, although I did make one modification.  Since I had only canned chili beans in the cupboard, I used those instead of plain kidney beans.  The soup was rich, flavorful and a hit with my husband, who was skeptical when I told him I was making cabbage soup.  The cabbage added a little bit of crunch to the soup.

The first time I made it as it is called and we loved it.  The second time I added cubed sweet potato and it was even better.  I am wondering about changing the beans to garbanzo, but haven't tried that yet.  Even my seven year old ate it up!

I changed this quite a bit - used sausage instead of beef, and black beans instead of kidney - but holy cow, it's wonderful!!  I don't think I'd have liked it as much with just ground beef, but the basic recipe is simply fantastic.  (I also just cooked it in a soup pot, since the day slipped away from me and I didn't have 4 hours to wait for the crock pot.)

I have made this Soup 3 times already and it just keeps getting better and better every time! Of course it always tastes better the next day after all of the flavors have molded together, but this is absolutely the BEST cabbage soup recipe that I have ever tried! This is definately a fave in my house and will be for a long time to come! EXCELLENT job on this one!!!!

Delicious! My husband claims to despise cabbage, but never even knew it was in there and loved it! I only used 1 can of beans, deleted the cumin, added more stock and a bunch of garlic.  I also simmered it on stove for a few hours. Very versatile.

I really enjoyed this!  I replaced the beef with MS veggie crumbles, and replaced the beef bouillon with chicken bouillon (what I had available), but I don't think those changes were very drastic from the original recipe.  Hearty, yet not heavy, filling, and you can feel good about it.  I'm sure I will be making this often!

We are really enjoying this soup.  I made this as directed, except I did cut the cumin back to 1 tsp and didn't bother using the vegetable oil (my beef rendered enough fat).  I cooked this in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.  The only change I might make next time is to use one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and one 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes, rather than just tomato sauce.  Thanks.

I thought this soup was excellent! I love soup, though, and I occasionally like cabbage if it is spiced well (and I got it on sale---its a very cheap and filling food!). My family was not so pleased---it smelled up the house, LOL. So I am the sole reviewer here as no one else would even try it. I am giving it 4 stars not because of the smell (cabbage is a stinky vegetable, no one's fault there) but because of the sodium. I only put two beef cubes in and only 1 tsp of salt. I did add a couple of dashes of hot sauce for flavor. I also a used a jar of pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce because that is what I had on hand and I added more water.

LOVE this soup!  I didn't use any oil.  Since I didn't have enough tomato sauce, I used one can of tomato sauce and one can diced tomatoes then added a bit more water.  All the other flavors are perfect and we really enjoyed it!  The cabbage is a great addition to this chili-like soup.  Thank you for the recipe!  :)

This was good.  To those who said cut the cumin, I disagree.  It needed it for flavor.  I started out not using it, and then added it later.  Just eyeballed it, didn't measure.  I don't think this tasted like chili, chili has chili powder.  I did add garlic with the browning meat and tossed some in the pot too, we love garlic.  I used white cantinelli beans (just a personal preferance).  I would recommend cutting the cabbage thin.  Instead of the 2 cups of water and bouillon cubes, I used a can of 99% fat free and reduced sodium beef broth.  Does the same thing, but cuts down the sodium and time.  I also threw the cabbage in with 3 hours left to cook (cooked on low for 8 hours) - I only did this because another reviewer said the cabbage would be over cooked.  I am wondering if I could have just followed the directions in the recipe.  The posted picture doesn't look anything like mine.  You could see the cabbage.  Served with some crusty bread, this was a good healthy dinner for a cold night!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of our favorite things to eat!  I use an entire head of cabbage, decrease the tomato sauce and add 2 cans of diced tomatoes, celery, and substitute 1 can of kidney beans with a can of navy beans for a little variety.  WE LOVE THIS SOUP!

This was fantastic! The only change I made was omitted the kidney beans and instead, I used cooked brown rice that I added in the last hour of simmering.  It tasted just like what we call "pigeons" (or stuffed cabbage rolls) here in PA.

Home run.  I did make a few changes as I'm on a diet and am diabetic so wanted to make it a little friendlier for me to eat.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also added a large can of diced tomatoes with juice in addition to the tomato sauce.  And finally, I threw in an extra can of kidney beans to up the protein content and added about two tablespoons of minced garlic.  We love garlic.  Thanks for the post.  This is a keeper.

I've made this a couple of times and the kids gobble it up.  It's a great way to get cabbage into them :)

This was good, and did make enough for left overs. The only thing is it's a bit salty. I had to add a Tbs of sugar and only put three boulion cubes. Almost taste like chili, just with cabbage in it.

I have made this one many times.  Instead of tomato sauce I use a can of crushed tomatoes. I also add some chili powder.  Consider it a healthy chili. Top with cheese and onions. Cornbread on the side.

This soup was very good. I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand so I used black beans instead of kidney beans, salsa instead of tomato sauce and beef broth instead of booullion cubes.

This was really good. Even my fussy 8 year old liked it. Basically he will only eat broccoli cheese soup or chili, no other soups. 
 Personally my family would like it with more of the tasty broth. I also thought I would like some peeled chopped potato in it.
 It does hint at tasting like a chili and I might consider cutting back on the cumin sometimes also. 
Very yummy comfort food. Ohh I also did not have a 24oz tomato sauce so I used a 28 oz can Pastene ground tomatoes.

I wanted it to be done in less than 4 hours, so I cooked this on the stove instead of a crock pot. I used dried beans (soaked overnight, and then cooked for only about 30 minutes and then measured into 32oz and added to the soup). I feel there was too many beans and not enough beef or cabbage. Next time I would cut the amount of beans in half and double the cabbage. Also, the cabbage should be added with only an hour or two of cooking time left so that it keeps a nice texture/flavor. I only used about a tsp of the cumin and added some thyme, marjoram, sage, and parsley. I served this with the herb bread from this site and it was tasty! It made a lot of soup, too! perfect for leftovers.

I am one of the least picky eaters out there, and I was so excited to make this because of the ingredients, but it was just awful.  I couldn't even eat it, it was so acidic.  Maybe I made it wrong, but I double-checked everything as I was going along.  Definitely will not be trying this again.

Very tasty!  I made this soup for my sick fiance and as it was cooking, he exclaimed, "Yuck!  It smells like cabbage in here, I hate cabbage!"  A few hours later - he was demolishing the soup.  I believe he ate all of it except one bowl; my bowl!  I used crushed tomatoes rather than tomato sauce which made a very thick base for the soup.  the reason I have to knock it down a peg is because it was very hard to fit all the ingredients in the slow cooker.  I have an average to large size cooker and I could barely get the lid on with all the cabbage.  It managed to cook down a bit but it was touch and go for a bit.

Very good, just two problems: 1- tastes kinda like Chili; Will read suggestions FIRST next time and omit the Cumin 2- a little less "soupy" than I'm used to for a soup, maybe I wont drain the beans next time.....

Excellent! My kids love this, they ask me to make it all the time! Hard to believe, especially since they normally don't like cabbage. They choose this over my regular chili! I like it because the ingredients are very low in fat and it's a very nutritious meal. Serve with  fresh Italian or French bread. The only change I make is omitting the vegetable oil when cooking the meat, it's not necessary. I usually use ground beef, but I'm sure you can use ground turkey to keep it real low in fat. Enjoy!  Even if you aren't a cabbage fan, you will love this!

Cooking Mama, really has a winner with this recipe. It was perfect on a cold winter day and the flavor was fantastic. I used 2 16 oz cans of unsalted canned beef stock in lieu of the bouillion  cubes. Also used freshly ground pepper from the grinder. Excellent recipe, very tasty. The slow cooker does all the work for this in 4 hours. Perfect hearty soup!

This one is great.  We did make a few changes, adding black eyed peas (a southern thing) and a cup of tomato juice in place of a cup of water (more flavor).  It turned out really well, especially with a side of cornbread.

I made this because I had a small head of cabbage in my fridge that I needed to use up. This soup is very good, but it is basically chili with cabbage in it. I also found it to be very salty but still good. I halved the recipe but the one thing I did change was the tomato sauce... I used one can of diced tomatoes and one small can of tomato sauce. This could account for the chili like texture... but either way it would still taste like chili. My boyfriend didn't really like it but he is picky.

Great soup, I will try other veggies besides beans next time.  I think so much more can be done with the soup beside a bean.  Perhaps a can of corn, veg-all, or fresh zucchini.

Just wonderful! I generally hate to alter recipes and then rate them as I don't find it fair to the recipe submitter. I can only imagine how great this is without the alterations that I made! With that being said, I made a only a few minor tweaks as followed: I only used 1 can of Northern beans (I don't like kidney beans), nixed the cumin, and used 1 regular can of tomato sauce and 1 regular can of petite diced tomatoes. So again, no major changed in my opinion. We ate this for dinner and I served with yeast rolls. I'm quite sure this will be one of those dishes that's even 10x better the next day. Fantastic recipe; thanks for sharing! :)

Definitely will be my New Year's Day meal from now on!  Every year I struggle to find a palatable way to eat my cabbage and black eyed peas on NYD.  The only changes I made were using black eyed peas instead of kidney beans,  using 16 oz tomato sauce and 16 oz canned chopped tomatoes, using beef broth instead of water, and using only 2 bouillion cubes.  My guests loved it and so did I.

My family- including the 8 and 6 year olds- eats anything.  Artichokes, saurkraut, no problem.  We love new flavors.  But it's a few minutes before suppertime, and I'm scrambling to make peanut butter and jelly for supper.  This is the first time that I've made an allrecipes.com recipe that was just straight up TERRIBLE!!  I checked and double checked the recipe, and I did it right... it just doesn't taste good.

I had bought a large head of cabbage at a farmer's market and was looking for a soup recipe that was a bit "different", and also healthy. The first time I make a recipe from this site, I like to make it exactly as it appears so I can rate it appropriately. My husband was definitely worried because he didn't think the recipe sounded good; I, however, had high hopes because of all the great reviews (and knowing that we both love cabbage).  The recipe did not disappoint, and I'm happy to say even my skeptical husband loved this soup! We both like spicy dishes, so once in our bowls we both added some hot sauce just to add some kick. As others have stated, it did remind us a little of chili, but that's okay - it's to be expected with ground beef, kidney beans and tomato sauce! The cabbage was wonderful and without the cumin I don't think the recipe would be nearly as delicious. I'll definitely be making this again!

Wonderful consistency ..... I only used two bouillon cubes and substituted ground turkey.  Totally hearty and flavorful.  I will be making this often.  Thanks.

Delicious and healthy. I substituted 2 lbs of ground turkey for the beef and don't use the beans. I also included a can of chopped tomatoes and substituted one of the cups of water for 1 cup of beef broth. A big hit with my husband and my 3-year old!

Cabbage Beef Soup Haiku: "Really liked this soup. (Thicker, and more like a stew.) Just missing ... something.) This soup was pretty well received at dinner b/c we adore cabbage, but it's just not quite as good as AR's "Cabbage Patch Stew"; still, I'm glad we tried this, and any meal's a win to me that's ready from morning in the crockpot, right to serving when I get home!

A bit on the salty side.  Omit the salt if sodium is a concern. Add the cabbage near the end if you like your veggies crisp like I do. I am not a big fan of cumin so I only used 1/8 tsp.  Yes, it is very chilli-like and not really a soup.  Try over rice and melting some cheese on it.

This soup was great, however, I opted for v8 as a base instead of tomatoe sauce, seemed to have more flavor. and lots of garlic salt!

Wasn't for me.  Family thought it was okay, but I didn't like it.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  Reviewers are right, it does taste like cabbage chili.  At first bite, I didn't mind but then the more I tried it, the more it wasn't for me.

As written, this recipe was just okay. This is basically a thin, bland chili with cabbage. People who rated it higher than 3 stars must have made some modifications to zest it up a bit.  I personally found that some hot sauce perked it up.

Very good! Used a bag of pre-shredd cabbage and carrots, and followed some of the reviews and used one can kidney beans and one can chili beans. Also used a large 24 oz can of Rotel in place of the tomato sauce, and just 1 cup of water. Yes, it is very much like chili with cabbage, but I will definitely make again!

I was leary of cabbage in this chiliesque recipe but it is absolutely amazing. I perfer the cabbage crunchier so I added it after an hour of cooking. I also skipped the bouillon and replaced with 1 1/2 tsp of chili powder with cocoa. I also used turkey meat and olive oil instead and 15 oz of sauce with 15 oz of diced tomatoes. Gonna make it again for sure.

This recipe was sooo yummy! It was perfect for a fall day.  I did change a few things.. I added garlic powder to the ground beef.  I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans (undrained), used 3/4 cup of water, 3/4 head of cabbage, & 3 beef bouillon cubes.  Also I added a cap full of vinegar once I had it in my bowl ( I really like vinegar) and it was amazing! It's a keeper and I'm adding it to my recipe book!

I am not a fan of cabbage. I don't particularly care for it. Not only did I enjoy it, but so did everyone else. This is a tasty hearty soup. I did as others substitute the tomato sauce, using crushed tomatoes instead. The only thing I added was chopped garlic clove. This is definitely a keeper! :D

This was sooo delicious! But I did change it up a little bit. I used ground turkey instead of the beef. I added 4 carrots, 2 celery, and 1 cup chopped eggplant. I can of rotel tomatoes. I omitted the kidney beans. The base of the recipe I kept the same. My husband does not like cabbage and he wanted nothing to do with this soup... that is until he had a bite of mine. He said it was really good. :)

We had several heads of cabbage to use up from this summer and this was one of my favorite recipes.  It was delicious and healthy.  It saves well and you can easily adjust the ingredients to fit what you have in the cupboard.

Very good!  Used ground turkey instead of beef, used only 2 bouillon cubes (instead of 4) and used 1 jar of organic Marinara sauce.  Also added a bit more water because I added more cabbage.  Also threw in a green pepper - chopped.  Smells great while cooking and tastes even better!  Even the kids liked this one.  Will make again!

YUMMY! I changed tomato sauce to 30 oz, 4 cups of water, 6 cups cabbage, no bouillon cubes, no veggie oil, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1 1/2 tsp pepper, drained beef really good, added a can of fire roasted tomatoes chopped, 1 tsp oregano and I clove of garlic chopped. Cooked on stove top on medium high heat for 1 hour so cabbage would be tender. Super flavorful!

Delish. I made this recipe for my family for the first time about a year ago, and I've been making it in big batches every month or so since; What doesn't get eaten is put into the freezer for use on lazy or cold days. Thank you very much for posting this recipe!

I made this on the stovetop, and added about 1/2 bag of Birdseye Steamfresh frozen long-grain rice...this addition really made it taste like stuffed cabbage soup.  I loved it!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Delicious! I seasoned ground beef & sauteed with onions. Substituted 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce, & 3 cups of Emeril's Organic Beef Broth for bouillon cubes/water + 1 cup of chick broth. We like a brothy soup! I did leave out the cumin based on previous reviews & used all of a small head of  cabbage. I did this on the stove top in a ceramic cast iron pot after bringing all ingredients to a small boil, then simmered covered for 2 hours on low. My hubby raved about it & I enjoyed it as well!

Great taste. It tasted just like how my grandma use to make it. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I just used half a can of tomato soup and a small can of tomato paste and added a little extra water. The cabbage was a little slimy but I'm not sure what I did wrong... If it was under cooked or over cooked...? All around really good.

Excellent!! I fixed this recipe for supper yesterday and it was a hit! My 8 year old son loved it and this morning he woke up and wanted the leftovers for breakfast! This is a keeper in my house!! I pretty much stuck to the original recipe though I did use 3 bouillon cubes instead of 4 and I also used 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomato. Thank you Nancy for sharing your recipe!

I really liked this recipe. I only have a few slow cooker recipes that I love. Like others, I also added 1 can of stewed tomatoes and and used 3 cans of beef broth instead of the buillon cube. I love cabbage I ended up using an entire head of cabbage. It turned out great! Will be making this again.

Yummy!  I used almost all organic ingredients.  I found a can of organic edamame (soy beans), so I threw that in, too, along with an extra can of organic diced tomatoes for the texture.  It hasn't even finished cooking, but I CAN NOT wait for dinner tonight.  This recipe has made so much food, my crock pot is almost overflowing, and our family of 6 will be able to eat this for a couple of days.  I did use the whole head of organic cabbage.  It was a good medium size.  PLEASE try this recipe.  You will not be disappointed! =)

Excellent recipe.  Used cannelli beans instead of kidney beans as that's what I had on hand plus added some garlic as that's what I do, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  Very hearty and very tasty!!!!!

This is very good but it taste like chili with cabbage and no chile powder.  The cumin gives it some heat.  Would make it again.

I've made this twice now. Love the flavor (the cumin is a great addition) and love that it is high nutrition and low fat.  I did make one change in that bouillon cubes all seem to have MSG in them and we are avoiding that. So I just added water and a bit of extra sea salt

This was SOOOO good.  Since I was just making it for 2 people, I cut the recipe in half but still used a whole head of cabbage and it was perfect.  Used extra lean ground beef 96/4 and added fresh garlic.  I slow cooked it on the stove top.  Will be making this again and again!!  Thanks for a great recipe using cabbage!

Great recipe!  I added a couple cloves of garlic and also used both tomato sauce and diced tomatoes as my family likes them in the recipe.  I have also cooked this on the stove for about an hour and it turned out great.

So easy and really good.  I used one can crushed tomatoes (just like sauce) and one can diced tomatoes because that is what was in the pantry.  I cut back slightly on the cumin and used a little less bouillon - I use Better Than Bouillon because it is easier to control - to make sure it was not too salty.

This was my first soup I've ever made and it was great!  Thanks for the hearty recipe.  My husband kept saying "This is really good, this is really good".  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and mashed them down a bit with my potato masher.  I think I liked that better since it probably made the soup a bit thicker.  Thanks!

I feel almost as though I should rate this recipe as I did not follow is exactly. In fact I basically only used it as a base/ IDEA for a recipe. I added A LOT to it because I was not in the mood for runny and  I wanted something thicker. I was craving cabbage and chili type dinner. 

I added pinto and black beans as i do not like kidney beans, 3/4 of a can of corn (used the rest for corn bread), 8oz of tomato sauce, one can of diced tomatoes, small zucchini, and 1 cup of rice and i used chicken stock instead of the beef cubes and water because i had some on hand that needed to be used up. 

it tasted sooooooooooo good. I just melted some cheese on it. I cant wait for the left overs at lunch

Yummy! I added a can of diced tomatoes to add some substance.  I also added some rice for my kids (3 and 1 years old) so it was thicker. Very good with some french bread! Like an unstuffed cabbage with kidney beans.

To have more chili taste, I added a can of diced seasoned tomatoes, 4 additional cups of beef broth.  Not sure, but plan to replace my crock pot because recipe was too concentrated by the tomato sauce; recommend diced tomatoes be used instead.

This soup was wonderful.  I will add it to my regular soup rotation.  I like to seaon my meat, so next time I will use  less salt (maybe 1/2 teaspoon).  I also used homemade tomato sauce and added the canned tomatoes undrained, and I used a can of chili bean undrained.  This was so delicious I kept wanting more.  I hope it doesn't affect me too bad the next day!

Similar to a dish my mom used to make on the stovetop, she called it "slumgully."  I left out the cumin and put in a bay leaf, used a 28 oz. can of undrained diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and substituted sliced carrots for the beans.  The carrots give it a hint of sweetness and a bit more texture.  Easy and great on a cold night.

I added a can of each, sliced carrots, diced tomatos, corn, green beans, and peas. I only had 1 can of kidney beans so I used a can of chilli flavored beans also. I put some chilli powder in it too. My soup was between a vegetable beef soup and chilli. Everyone in my house loved it (9 people) and my mom, dad, and a couple of friends of mine loved this soup. I will be making this soup again very soon! Next time I make this I will make a double batch so we can have leftovers. This recipe is a good starter soup to expierment with. Thank you for the recipe.

This soup was delicious.  The only change I made was to add 5 cloves of minced garlic.

This was pretty good... but i was hoping for something more like stuffed cabbage without all the work... maybe next time I will add in cooked rice at the end instead of the beans? It was also pretty salty.

This was delicious!! My little ones loved it. Granted, I was worried because cooked cabbage smells so awful, but I was delightfully surprised. I'll probably make it again, but I'll bake a cake or something immediately afterward to rid my house of the smell.

I expected this to taste like chili, and it did.  It was definitely a good way to get kids to eat cabbage!  3 out of 4 kids I served this to said it was delicious (the 4th doesn't like chili).  I also added more cabbage than called for, about 8 cups.

Very tasty!  I even made the mistake of doubling the cabbage (I was cutting the recipe in half) and it still tasted great - next time I will double cabbage too!

I was craving cooked cabbage--there is nothing wrong with the recipe but the cumin ruined the flavor for me....just a personal taste preference. I wanted it hearty like my gray used to make and the cumin made it taste more like a chili.

I didn't have kidney beans so I added frozen vegetables. Also I did not have bouillon cubes so I used homemade beef gravy left over from a roast and added lots of water so it would be like a soup. I left out the tomato sauce because of the acidity of tomatoes. Other than using this recipe for a base I love the soup. Very good. Will make it again.

I was skeptical when making this recipe because it seemed too simple to have a lot of  flavor but I had cabbage in the fridge that needed to be used up so decided to give it a try. 
Oh my! This was delicious! Everyone in the household really enjoyed this soup.  There wasn't much left for leftovers.

This is a delicious, hearty, easy to make soup in the slow cooker. I made a couple of small changes, decreasing the cumin by 1/2 tsp.I also added two diced carrots for flavor and color.  We wanted a little more broth so I added an additional cup of water with a teaspoon of vegetable paste

Too salty for my tastes. I make adjustments each time I now make it. One of which is that the 2 cups water I use beef broth instead, and then omit the 4 beef bouillon cubes. I love having this on a cold day, warms me right up.

Good soup with a lot of flexibility. I cut the cumin to 1/2 tsp. ( wife is not a fan of cumin) and added some garlic powder (1/2 tsp.) and oregano (1 tsp.). I also did not use beef bullion  cubes but used a 14 oz. can of reduced sodium beef broth instead of water to reduce the sodium. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and only used two 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce.

Yum Yum! This is a new slow cooker fave, easy to make, no hard to find ingredients. I took a few posters advice and placed cabbage 1 hr after slow cooker started. Just a slight change. Used 2 1/2  cups  beef broth ( covered the water and beef boullion in one shot). My family loves garlic, sauteed 1 clove with ground beef and onion. One pinch red pepper for a tiny kick.

yum yum yummm!! Such a wonderful hearty but healthy soup for a cold day. I did add 1 extra cup of water because I used a homemade tomato sauce and thought it might be too thick. The end consistency was perfect. Not too brothy and not too stewy... I also omitted the beans because husband doesn't care for the them but they would of been a wonderful touch.

I made as directed, except I used shredded cole slaw mix to save some time.  As others have said this was very reminiscent of conventional chili.  

It was good, but maybe not suited to my tastes for some reason.

This soup was delicious. I successfully used ground breakfast sausage in place of the ground beef. Very hearty and great for cold winter nights. It makes a lot! More than 10 servings by my measure.

AWESOME recipe! It was SUPER delicious and is one I will make again, again, and again! I did add diced tomatoes like some suggested. I also used chili beans which had chili seasoning since I didn't have cumin. I added a tad bit of sugar (because sometimes I like a sweeter soup!) Overall, LOVE this recipe! Perfect for a cold day! LOVE THIS SOUP!!!

This is better the next day. I added carrots, pinto beans and some garlic and used V8 instead of the tomato sauce. This was filling with some cornbread and makes a lot (probably enough for 8). Also I cooked mine on the stove for about an hour and a half. I'll make it again.

Good recipe.  Listen, in order for the cabbage not to get soggy, just cook every thing else in a pan first.  I used sausage.  When it was almost done I threw in some peppers and onions, then garlic powder, pepper, chilli powder, and paprika.   Then I added diced tomatoes with chilies and I used black beans. Yes, all undrained. Now pour all that cooked food into your pot. I poured in low sodium chicken broth instead of water until it floated but mine was spicy.  Lastly, add your cabbage.  To make it not taste like chili add thyme.

A really good base start for cabbage beef soup. However I did make some changes to suit our taste. I used beef stock instead of water and I used a whole medium onion, left out the cumin as I didn't want a chili taste. I also add a little beef base to give it more flavor. Had pinto cooked and used those. Really good.

Had a head of cabbage I needed to use and came across this recipe and it sounded easy, which is how I cook, and I hoped would be good. 

Thought it was a great recipe that I made a few adjustments to.  

I omitted the oil, I only used a 1/2 lb of 90/10 ground beef, I used about a cup of chopped onion, 1 tsp chopped garlic, increased cabbage that I shredded fairly thin (just threw in handfuls) 1 can kidney beans, 1 can chickpeas, 1 can pinto beans, 2 - 10oz cans of tomato sauce, threw in about a cup of salsa I had leftover,  used 4 tsp of beef Better Than Bullion instead of cubes, and then used about 2 tsps. of dry chili seasoning mix.  Added a little garlic powder and a little onion powder as well.

It is absolutely delicious!  I cooked it on the stove, no slow cooker here.

Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

My husband andi really enjoyed this soup/stew. I made half the recipe. I followed the suggestions and I did not add cumin, added diced tomatoes, and 1 can of beef broth with 2 beef buillion cubes. I sautéed onion, celery, and carrots, and 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil seasoned with adobo seasoning and pepper. I added 3 allspice berries,a bay leaf and a little brown sugar and let it simmer for about an hour. I alao threw in some frozen mixed vegetable. Very thick and hearty. Very easy to make.

My family loved this soup.  I did make some changes recommended by other writers.  I eliminated the 2 T. of oil (used Pam)when cooking meat and onions. I used 2 cans of dark red kidney beans rinsed and drained, 1 can of chili beans not drained, 2 -14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes, 15 oz. tomato sauce, 2 beef bouillon cubes, no cumin, 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, 1/2 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. onion powder.  I also did not add any water.  Brought it to a boil and then put on the cover and cooked over med low heat for 30 minutes(stirring several times) and then added the chopped whole cabbage head (about 9 cups)and cooked til cabbage was tender about 30 minutes.  Next day it was even better.  Will make this recipe again.

This was super easy, healthy and tasted really good!  I used a whole medium onion instead of 1/2.  In stead of measuring out the cabbage I just chopped up a whole medium size cabbage.  Cabbage doesn't have to be finely chopped.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with the juice and as far as the cumin, I just sprinkled on a bit and that was enough :)

I used this recipe as a guideline really, but what came out of it was delicious! Here are my changes: I added a large carrot, 3 stalks of celery, I used 1 large tomato and a 1/3 cup tomato sauce, and I added a bunch of paprika and oregano and left out the salt. I had to change a lot of the ratios due to having a small crockpot, so it turned out a tad salty, I should have used left one or two of the bouillon cubes out. The cabbage wouldn't fit in the crockpot, so I left it to cook all day, and then transferred it to a pot, added the cabbage and simmered for about 30 minutes.

Thanks for a great recipe!  I have made this many, many times now and don't know why I haven't rated before.  My son is allergic to chili powder and this has become our replacement for chili.  I make it according to the directions except for substituting black beans for kidney beans.  This recipe makes a flavourful, mild thick soup or thin chili.  We serve with a bottle of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, guacamole, sour cream and either tortilla chips or warm French bread.  This recipe freezes and reheats well.  (Note: I have used both packaged coleslaw mix and fresh chopped cabbage.  The fresh chopped cabbage provides a better texture for the cooked cabbage but I use the packaged if it is on sale or if I am trying to save on preparation time.)

This should be renamed to Cabbage Beef 'Stew'.  This hardy meal is perfect on cold days and will fill you up.  Made it for the first time last night. I was worried it would be too salty with the 4 bouillon cubes and the added salt.  It came out great and has a lot of fans.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Really enjoyed this!  I made a few changes but nothing to really alter the result.  I used ground venison instead of beef.  Added green pepper and celery when browned the venison and onion.  Used 1 can of kidney and 1 can of chili beans. Used 1 can of crushed tomatoes, 1 can of Mexican stewed tomatoes and 1 can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce.  Chili powder instead of cumin.  Omitted bouillon cubes and salt, trying to lower the sodium content (also tomato paste has less sodium that sauce). Husband and I love cooked cabbage, but never used it in soup before.  Will do so from now on!  Great recipe that stays great with many variations!  Adding potatoes was mentioned by a reviewed, will probably try that next time.

amazing, healthy comfort food.  I left out the vegetable oil and added chili powder for the cumin.  Also cooked on stovetop so added 2 extra cups water. Even the kids loved this one.

I used chili beans becuase I do not like kidney beans. I added a can of rotel. It was like chili, but that made me love it even more. I served it with cheese and everyone loved it. I cooked it on the stove top for about an hour and half on low cause I didn't have time to do it in the crockpot last night. Will def make again. Will try adding a little garlic and red pepper flakes next time.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was way to salty for me and my husband.  There is already salt in the canned kidney beans, tomato sauce, and in the bouillon cubes.  I would suggest that the salt be left out, and then if you desire more than you can add it when you eat it.  The cumin was a bit over powering, and I would suggest that it be dropped maybe to 1 teaspoon.

I fell in love with cabbage beef soup at Shoney's, so was glad to find this recipe. This was so comforting and hearty. Tasted delicious and was easy and quick to make. I was too impatient to use my slow cooker, so I brought it to a boil on the stove and simmered it for about an hour. Came out perfect. I used chicken broth instead of water, used 1 16oz can of diced tom and 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce. I seasoned my ground beef prior to browning and added a little celery seed and cayenne pepper to the soup. Everything else I followed as written. The cumin did make it taste more chili-like than I remember, but it was good nonetheless. Next time I may halve the cumin or try a difffernt spice, maybe coriander, and see what difference that makes. I served it over plain white rice and it was so filling and tasty! Can't wait to get home to eat more.

I've been making a soup similar to this for years.  The only differences that I have are: I use turkey smoked sausage instead of hamburger, tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, 3 T. vinegar, and no cumin.  It is so good on a cold day.  I serve it with corn bread.

I made this to use some cabbage from Hubs' garden.  I used beef broth rather than the water and bouillon cubes, and I didn't drain the kidney beans.  Perhaps I should have drained the beans, because my soup had a sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting.  Although it also could have been that my tomato sauce was sweeter than others.  All and all a good soup.  Froze the leftover portions for later.  Thank you!

i had to give this 4 instead of 5 only cause i made so many changes.  first of all, i found this last minute so didn't use the slow cooker, just threw it all in a pot (after browing the beed of course) and brought to a boil, then simmered for an hour.  i used 16 oz tomato sauce and 8 oz diced tomatoes, skipped the water/beef bouillon and used 2 1/2 cups beef broth, added 2 chopped carrots and only 1 teaspoon cumin.  it was DELICIOUS!!

Delicious chili. It really is just chili with healthy cabbage hidden inside - can't taste the cabbage.

Good recipe, but did make some changes to make the stew more flavourful. I definately recommend to add at least one or two cloves of garlic (minced) and a bay leaf. I used low-fat ground turkey instead of beef to make the meal healthier. It tasted even better on the second day! Served it with flaky home-made biscuits and it was a real hit!

Great, as is! Next time I do think I'll add more cabbage, though, and a can of crushed tomatoes.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious! As per helpful suggestions, I made just a couple of changes. I did not use water. I used 1 can cannellini beans NOT drained, 1 can of pinto beans mostly drained, and 1 can of kidney beans mostly drained. I also used 2 cans of tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes instead of 24 oz of tomato sauce. To make it a bit less fatty, I used extra lean (97/3) ground beef and did not use oil. Once again, this was amazing!!!

Loved this soup!  I thought the beans and cabbage together sounded a bit strange, but since I like both, I decided to try it.  Based on what I had on hand, I used ground turkey, 1 can red beans, 1 can black beans (both rinsed and drained), 1 14 oz can tomato sauce and 1 can Rotel tomatoes and chiles, for a little kick. I also added a bit more cabbage.  Over the last few days, I ate the entire pot of soup by myself.  With my modifications, this is my new favorite soup.

An excellent recipe! Quick, easy and tasty. I use this recipe as a base without much variance. I like to double most ingredients, except for the cumin. I also add either fresh or canned stewed tomatoes. We eat it with corn  bread. A definite hit in my house!

I absolutely loved it! It was easy to make and turned out delicious. I substituted ground turkey for the beef and thought it was good also. Definitely will be making this again.

This was great. Made it over the rainy cold weekend, and I almost finished off by myself!  However mine was more like a chili than a soup but either way it was great. Thank you

I made this and gave some to my dad who is a very picky cook and doctors up everything.  He admitted that this was the first recipe that didn't need to be changed and he has asked me to make it several times.  I did however add tomato chunks the first time I gave it to him.  This is a keeper!

Fantastic soup!!  I didn't have any black pepper but didn't miss it.  Also didn't have beef broth so used chicken flavor Better than Broth.  Turned out great.  Highly recommend.

Loved this soup! I used a pound of ground turkey instead of the burger and added a can of diced tomatoes. I am not a fan of cumin so I did not use it. I used 6 beef cubes instead of 3. My husband and I can not eat spicy foods. Even with out the cummin it was a very hearty and filling soup. Sometimes it is best to just let the flavours of the food come out on thier own with out adding any spices.

Have made this many times now , it is one of my family's favorites. I have made both in a slow cooker and on top of the stove, and turns out great all the time. I have taken it to pot lucks at work also, and they loved it. Reminds me of a soup my Mom used to make, I always top it with a little sour cream. Along with a loaf of homemade bread from my bread machine, it doesn't get any better than this on a cold night!

It was a lot like chili, but it was wonderful!  I love the cabbage and the flavor is just right.  I did add some cup up tomatoes, but it was just to use them up.  I would add some next time, but it doesn't have to have them.

This is a GREAT recipe. My husband and I love cabbage but there are only certain ways we really like it cooked. This is perfect, and very versatile if you choose to add particular ingredients you enjoy! I use a couple of cans of homemade stewed tomatoes!

This was a delicious soup. My husband and children loved it! The only minor alterations after reading some of the reviews, is I used tomato juice instead of sauce only because I like it soupier and I only used a pinch of cumin instead of the whopping 1 1/2 tsp it called for since some reviewers complained of it tasting too much like chili...also used beef broth instead of bullion cubes. So DELICIOUS!

My family and I have really been blessed by this recipe, I cook it at least once a week. I use Red Beans and Black Beans. I like the seasonings just the way they are. I like cabbage so  I put about 7 cups of cabbage. I chop the cabbage very thin. I have told a lot of people about this recipe. My 2 grandchildren love this.  They are 11 and 6. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Saundra Jordan

Yummy comfort food!  I forgot to defrost my ground turkey early enough, so I ended up making this on the stove.  I sauteed the onion and ground turkey, and added a clove of garlic.  Then I added everything else.  I simmered over low heat, covered, for 1 hr 20 mins.  It came out wonderful.  I added a full 30 oz of tomato sauce instead of 24 oz and I'm glad I did because it was a really "chunky" soup as it was.  It didn't taste like chili at all to me, and I'm a big chili fan.  It tasted more like stuffed cabbage without the rice (that would be a nice addition).  Easy and delicious.

Yum!  I skipped the vegetable oil and used 2-15 oz cans of tomato sauce.  This turned out really good.  I sprinkled some shredded cheese on top, and it kind of tasted like a cabbage roll soup.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful.  My kids loved it as well as my husband. I did not find a need to change the recipe for anything.  It did not taste like chili to me, and it definitely needed the cumin for the flavor.  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!!

good - but use beef broth instead of cubes and water, and will need more broth.  Also would add green peppers - could also add carrots.

Quite tasty, and a winner. I did do some adjustments due to our own diet preferences.  Used ground turkey, low sodium beef broth instead of water, pinto beans and added a can of diced tomatoes. This would also be good with corn, carrots or celery added.  Will make again.

I made this soup for the first time. I decided to use 1/2 can garbanzo beans (chick peas) and about 1 can of black beans instead. I also added yellow squash to it. This was my first recipe on this site that I tried and it turned out really well and tasty. I think that maybe thinly shredded beef would also be great in this soup rather than ground beef and I may try that next time.

Good recipe and reminds me of my great-grandmothers stuffed cabbage.  I yook heed of other reviews and added a can of stewed tomatoes, and went for chick peas for beans.  I think they could be omitted though and I didn't use any cumin.  Held off on adding any water until all ingredients were in, and added 6 boullion cubes.  Also, added some carrots, just because thats how my grandmas sauce was.  Defintely make again.

This soup was very good.  I did make some changes though.  I did not use cumin because I didn't want a chili taste.  I used 28 oz diced tomatoes and 8 oz tomato sauce.  Also added 2 cups cooked rice I had on hand and it reminded me of a stuffed cabbage soup.  Very good, very filling, reminded me of my Mom's stuffed cabbage without all the work.

This is so easy to make and tastes great.  It does have a chili quality to it but that didn't matter.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used about 1 1/2 cups of v8 juice, can of diced tomatoes with garlic, and a can of tomato paste.  I only had one can of kidney beans so I used that and a can of great northern beans.  I also dissolved the beef cubes in the water before I poured it in the crock pot.  This was so good and so easy.  Definitely will make again.

This is pretty good, although I'm not sure if I'll make it again.  It is like chili with cabbage.  I only used 16 oz of tomato sauce, and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I added a can of pinto beans because I thought it should be a little thicker.  Since it seemed like chili, I went ahead and added chili powder, etc.  Again, pretty good but may opt for chili next time.

Loved it.  It does taste like a chili though.  I used three cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce as that is what I had on hand.  Substituted one can of blackeyed peas for one of the cans of kidney beans.  Added garlic and celery salt and some elbow macaroni at the end.  Will make again and probably add some corn.

How can a dish so simple be SOOOOOOOOOO tasty?!  I thought "Chili with cabbage...hmmm."  Sure glad I tried it!  Only things I did different was add some chili powder and a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. After ladeling it in a bowl, I added some sharp shredded Cheddar.  Great winter dish and I'm sure this is going to be a regular go-to soup!

I made this with garden burger crumblers instead of ground beef (for my diet).  Well, I barely got to eat any of it!  My family, including my 3 picky toddlers devoured it.  

I made a few personal adjustments (added garlic, left out cumin) but stuck pretty closely to the recipe.  Thanks for a great one!

Instead of using beef bouillon, use beef (or even vegetable) stock.  You won’t have a sodium issue.  I used 1 can of pinto beans & 1 can of black beans (that’s what we had on hand) as well as a full 28oz. can of tomato sauce.  Overall, we were pleased with the soup.

This was very good, very much like chili with cabbage.  Instead of water, I added two cans of beef broth, also diced tomatoes and a pinch of chili powder.  It indeed makes a large batch but great for leftovers.

Followed the recipe pretty much, maybe added more cabbage.  I simmered in a stockpot rather than a slow cooker because I was afraid the cabbage would overcook.  I thought the soup was very good and will definately make again.

We used Boca Ground Burger instead of meat. I would recommend using a bit less of the bouillon as it came out a bit strong, but otherwise, we will be making this one again.

This soup was good, but nothing outstanding in my opinion.  I did add a good amount of garlic powder to it, and used celery, green onions and a half a red pepper that I needed to use up.  It is a good, filling winter soup, and it does make a lot.  I served mine with shredded Cheddar on top for some extra flavor.  If I make this again, I'll definitely scale down the recipe, since I have a lot left over.  Thanks!

Excellent soup! I think the next time we make it, we'll cut back the cumin and pepper a bit, but I have no complaints whatsoever as it is. A definite keeper!

This was good. It was like chili with cabbage. It could use some more flavor. Next time i will add some hot sauce, peppers and use different beans.

I didn’t use as much cumin, maybe a teaspoon. Seasoned the meat and onions with garlic pepper and used two 14 oz cans of beef broth instead of the bullion. Came out great!!

I treat the original recipe as a starter recipe.  I added 2 cartons of beef broth, 2 extra beef bouillon cubes, 3 sliced potatoes, 3 cups of frozen peas/corn/string beans/carrots mix.  & 1 can of fire roasted  tomatoes and garlic powder.

Love this recipe!

We loved it, but it tasted more like chili than cabbage soup. I believe the chili taste could be attributed to the cumin.

Delicious, simple and cheap to make. This is a great hearty and healthy recipe for a cold day. I made it per directions and it was good. However as the recipe is pretty simple you can tailor it a bit to your tastes. After it finished cooking I added some paprika, cumin, chili powder and apple cider vinegar to really make it pop. I’ll definitely this recipe again. Other reviews said it reminds them of a chili bit it reminded me more of unstuffed cabbage rolls than chili. This is a great option for busy people, and those on a tight food budget.

I've made this twice now and I will make again at least once every fall. We have friends who bring boxes of tomatoes, cabbage and corn, so I used some of each in this soup. The second time I skipped the cumin and added red pepper flakes, because we like spicy soups. I also added about 8 ounces of hot Italian sausage which we thought created a nice variation, but the original is excellent too.  Serve with hot French or Italian bread. Yum!

My husband is not a fan of cabbage, but I am. I made this soup expecting to be the only one eating it, but I was wrong! He loved it! This is more like cabbage chili. It is thick and perfectly seasoned. We will definitely make this again.

I made several substitutions. I used one 19 oz can of lentil soup plus the two 15 oz cans of kidney beans. One cup homemade chicken broth. 1.3 oz baby kale. One chopped carrot. Two cups homemade bone broth, instead of water. 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1 because the (2) bullion cubes were salty enough. Two minced garlic cloves and 10 oz of sweet fresh tomatoes. Very yummy, will be making this again!

After reading the reviews I made a few changes!   I eliminated the beans and cumin as I did. It want it to resemble chili.  I added 2 tsp of minced garlic and 2 stalks of celery.  For the juice I did add the bouillon cubes, 1 cup of water, 1 quart of stewed tomatoes, and 14 oz of tomatoe sauce.  With one hour to go I added the cabbage!   I made rice as a “side” for those that wanted to add it to their bowl!   Delish!!!!   Will definitely make again!  Was similar to what I would call a cabbage roll soup.  Would maybe add green peppers next time!

I was surprised that my husband loved it. He added hot sauce, shredded cheese and sour cream to his bowl second bowl. I used a whole onion, 6.5 cups cabbage, 1.5 lb lean beef, 2 lb can of dark kidney beans, 28 oz crushed tomatoes, 4 cups beef broth, and at least 1 T. of cumin in mine.

Very good.  I only had one can of tomato sauce so I added about 2 sauce cans of water.  Also added 3 tbsp of brown sugar after cooking.  Cooked in a pressure cooker in 26 minutes.

This was great!  Kids loved it!  Just used turkey instead of beef and only used 3 bullion cubes.  Also, used a whole carton of beef broth instead of water and left out the cumin.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

My family loved this!  I did cut down on the tomato sauce and add a can of diced tomatoes  and add garlic but other than that it was delicious just about as is!  Made for good leftovers for lunch the next day too!

I cooked the hamburger with garlic and Lawry's salt.  Added the onions raw into the pot.  I cut back on the Cumin like other suggested.  Also used chicken broth instead of the water.  

I thought it turned out ok, but I would cook it on high a hour longer because the cabbage really didn't get done enough.  I'd also use 2 pounds of hamburger and cut back on the cabbage a bit the next time I make it.  I

I doubled the recipe and used my electric pressure cooker.  Waited the onion, celery and chopped carrots first off.  Then added the ground beef and wanted it no longer pink..Used  almost 4# s of ground beef. Kept flipping till was  no longer pink..Drained in in my colander and back into the pot. I used 2 qts. boxer beef stock.  2 came diced tomatoes, 2 cans red kidney beans rinsed and 2 cans tomato sauce. Stirred around and while getting back to boil, added all my spices. Used your same amounts salt, pepper and half cumin.  Also added 3 medium bay leaves, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp of oregano, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of sweet paprika. Mixed it up a all and added medium head of green cabbage. Put pressure lid on and put on Soup setting and 16 mins. later it was done.  Left pressure down natural release a c opened to take a look.  And of course  had to sample it and t didn't disappoint.  It was absolutely delicious.  Put lid back on and pressed Warm for another 1 hour till my big kids arrived.  They ha d to have some for home so I have some left for me.  I'm 80 yrs young and think I can't cook anymore but had to be honest  the goodness came from my subscription to Alllrecipes .s. This was made in my 8qt. Electric Pressure Cooker.  Thanks!  Allrecipes

This way okay but it actually tasted like chili. I was hesitant to add 1 & 1/2 tsp of cumin but I wanted to follow it exactly. The cumin really canceled out any taste if the cabbage.

I used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce called for. I also added a teaspoon  of Italian seasonings.  It is great soup. 
Since I live alone, I froze 4 good sized single servings so when I come home and don’t want to cook I can  heat up  some soup and have a special meal.

Instead of 24 oz of tomato sauce I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. I substituted beef stock for the water and bouillon cubes. I’m not a fan of beans so added diced bell pepper. 
Delicious!!  I’ll make this again.

I used my Instapot ....used sauté function for beef and onion. Used two cups of low sodium beef broth instead of water and I threw in an onion soup mix instead of bouillon.  Cooked on high for 30 min.(no Cumin)Awsome!

It was wonderful! Even my 3-year-old granddaughter liked it. Very easy to make and good left over, too. 
I'd make it again for sure.

Don’t know what all the fuss is about. I found this to be wildly bland. Used  a bottle of GF beer instead of water, added tomato paste (to be fair, I didn’t have tomato sauce so used diced tomatoes), added 3 cloves of garlic...didn’t make  much ch difference) added both  onion powder and garlic powder. Added red pepper flakes. It finally started tasting like something other than bland. 
Prob won’t save this recipe as I have a WAY better one that uses cabbage and ground meat!

I tried black beans because that is what I had, but I think the kidney or pinto would be better. I liked it and will make again.

It was quite good with additions: 1 1/2 t. garlic powder, soy sauce, W-Sauce, Ranch dressing mix, Frank's Red Hot. Before that it seemed bland. Also used cole slaw mix for the cabbage. It was too thick for 'soup'. Next time will add more broth (never water).

I can't stand kidney beans so I exchanged them for pinto. Tasted Great! 
I recommend this recipe for a do-ahead.
Wondering if ground turkey would work or if I'd have to do some spice doctoring.

In place of the water and bouillon cubes I used beef broth. I used a whole large white onion, and also fine chopped two stalks of celery and a green bell pepper. This is now part of my cold weather comfort food library. A variation on this that I also made was to substitute halved brussell sprouts for two cups of the cabbage. Why? Because I didn't have enough cabbage on hand and I had the brussell sprouts. Turned out VERY tasty. I used a pound of Jimmy Deans pork breakfast sausage in it too.

Scrap the water and beef bullion and don't drain the beans.  Use a cup of beef broth.  Use crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Stew meat gives it a chunky texture but chili ground beef also is good.

Very tasty soup.  The only changes I made was to omit the oil when browning the ground beef with the onion.  I added a couple of cloves of fresh garlic to the mixture before adding the other ingredients.  For the wet ingredients I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Instead of water I used about 2 1/2 cups of beef stock.  I only used one can of pinto beans and found that I needed to add almost 2 tsp of Himilayan salt, 1 1/2 tsp cumin and a little over a tsp of black pepper.   I added the cabbage last, brought it to a slow simmer on the stove top, covered and let it simmer for about 45 mins.  It made a thick, tasty and satisfying soup on this cold, snowy day!  I will make this again!

I like curry instead of cumin. Easy dish to make and if you like cabbage, you'll like this.

THIS SOUP IS DELICIOUS. Used the instant pot for the browning and slow cooking.   I subbed fresh carrots for the kidney beans.  Will make again.  I didn’t mind the cumin but some of  the guys didn’t like it. .  Next time i’ll cut back.

Very good! I changed a few things based on other reviews but this is a very good recipe! Browned ground beef and onion on stove like the recipe said. I added a can of diced tomatoes to the 28 oz of tomato sauce; I used 2 C beef broth instead of water and bouillon but I added 1.5 t of Better Than Bouillon beef base (I always use it for soups and stews because the flavor is so good!). Because the BTB has salt in it, I used only a dash of salt, and I love chili but didn't want this to taste like it so I reduced cumin  and pepper to 1/4t each. Threw it all in my InstantPot for 15 minutes on high pressure with a quick release at the end and it came out perfect!

This was pretty good. I used turkey, 1 can of pinto beans, 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, no cumin, and a can of chicken broth plus a cup of water. I added the cabbage an hour after starting it on high from some of the other comments, but wish I had added it from the start. I only did 4 hours and the cabbage could have been a little more cooked IMO, but still turned out good.

I used this as a foundation and then switched it up a bit. Used pinto beans because that is what I had on hand. Used diced tomatoes instead of sauce. Omitted cumin. Added an additional 2 cups chicken stock. Added 2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp oregano,  basil, and thyme. My husband added Sambal chili paste to his portion to kick it up a notch. I plan to make rice to serve it over.

I  made it in my Instant Pot.  The only change I made for pressure cooking was to reduce the cumin to 1 teaspoon. Sauted the hamburger, draining fat as it browned, then dumped in all the rest. Used manual setting, 7 minutes, natural pressure release for 10.  Other changes just for preference were I used one can of pinto beans and one of kidney. I always use Better Than Bouillon instead of cubes. And I used one 8 oz can of tomato sauce plus one 14.4 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of all sauce. No salt. Delicious and easy. My husband was looking for seconds today.

We loved this stoup----cross between soup and stew!  I made it on the stove and cooked for about 1 1/2 hours.  I didn't use ground beef but stew meat, trimmed of fat, cut into small pieces, browned and drained of as much fat as possible.  Then added to sauteed onions and the rest of the ingredients.  I used a 24 oz. can of Del Monte Traditional Pasta Sauce, Better-Than-Bouillon instead of the cubes (approx 3 T.). a large, sliced carrot and some celery to the mixture---those were my changes.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good, but did change the spices. I didn't add cumin based on other reviews and instead added coriander, a bit of thyme, and garlic. I put all the ingredients in the crock pot for 8 hours on low and it turned out just right!

I didn't make any changes and thought this was awesome. Had to have two bowls. I'll look at other recommendations for next time but the only thing I might do is shorten the cooking time a bit to have crispier cabbage. Awesome just the way it is, too.

Leave out the cumin and you have the "Cabbage Soup Like Shoney's" that I have made for years.  Much prefer it without the cumin, so it doesn't taste like chili.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  I did change the recipe a little. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also only used a teaspoon of cumin. Delicious!

I'm giving this recipe a 3 because without the changes I made it would have been quite bland. I added garlic and some dried herbs. After browning and draining the beef I cooked it in the crockpot on low for 6 hours. It was delicious and convenient and my kids loved it!

This a hearty and delicious soup. More like a stew. I added  3 garlic cloves. I will make it again and possibly add another type of spice as well.  Perhaps a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little kick.

My daughter is home with a new baby, so I made this soup. Only change is I read in the comments to use pinto beans instead of kidney beans, so I did.  I added garlic and carrots, because we had them and I love garlic. Great leftovers!

We  enjoyed the soup. I took the advice of another cook and added tomatoes instead of some of the tomato sauce. If I make it again I will add the tomatoes but add the tomato sauce also for better overall flavor.

I used ground turkey, and chicken flavored granules, instead of the beef bouillon cubes.  Also adapted for use in my Instant Pot and the whole process from beginning to end took about 1 hour.  Delicious recipe, and a real keeper!

Delicious and easy to make.  I didn't have the beef bouillon cubes, so I substituted a can of beef consommé.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the T.  I will make this again.

I opted to use beef stock, in place of the water, and omitted the beef bullion cubes. I don't care to use them in cooking, they're too salty for me. Other than those two changes I thought it was tasty and will be making it again.

This was great my girlfriend and I loved it. I did what another reviewer suggested and omitted the cumin and used chicken broth instead of water. Cooked for 5 hours on low and it was amazing. Only one minor complaint it was rather salty so I think when I make it next time I will omit the salt as well and use 2 bouillon cubes also it needed a little more cabbage so I think Id use 7 or 8 cups next time but that all aside it was great and definitely one for the recipe book.

First, this was very, very good!  IN fact, my husband commented several times as he was eating it how much he  liked it!  As always, I read the reviews before making and followed some of the tips including:  omitting the cumin, substituted pinto beans for the kidney, and used a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes rather than the tomato sauce.  Instead of 2 cups of water,  I dissolved two large beef bouillon cubes in approximately 3/4 cup boiling water and added that.  I also added the cabbage half way through, again as suggested by others.  During the last hour of cooking, because the soup tasted a little bland, I added approximately 1 tsp of Louisiana Hot Sauce and a Tbs of Worcestershire sauce.  (If I had used cumin, this probably wouldn't have been necessary, so might try that next time.)
However, it was delicious as made, so perhaps I shouldn't make any changes.

Wonderful flavor; especially enjoyed the cumin.  I didn't use oil or salt.  The next time I made it, remembering how much I liked the cumin, added a bit more and ruined the  soup!   Now I stick to original measurement ;-)  Tastes just as good after I've defrosted leftovers.

I made this as directed, with the exception of the oil - I forgot to buy vegetable oil, so I used canola oil instead. It came out with more of a chili-like consistency, which didn't bother me at all.  I liked it and I'd definitely make it again.

Loved it!  I added extra sauce, broth and water to make it more soup like.   All three of my kids loved it, which never happens.  :)

Family loved it, and the leftovers were even better.  I substituted great northern beans, they were nice and mild.

So I had a cabbage casserole that no one liked.  How to use casserole?  I made this soup.  In the end I did add some cayenne pepper and chili powder for some spice.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the following changes to suit my family's needs/wants: double the beef (95% fat free sirloin), use a whole onion, use olive oil, use a proper beef stock (organic, no salt added) and substitute 20oz of cashews for the kidney beans to make it Whole 30 compliant. This a very savory soup- not chili at all!

Very tasty and easy to prepare. Think the cabbage is best when it is not overCooked.

This recipe is good.  But I used it as a  base recipe and added my own things to make it work for my family.  After reading the reviews and tasting after 2 hours on high, I realized it needed help.  I added Italian stewed tomatoes, and 1 tablespoon sugar to offset all the tomato.  People were saying too acidic.  I also added 2 tablespoons of cajun seasoning, as the cumin was there,  just needed more of a kick.  Turned out pretty good.  My family liked it marginally, wasn't raved about, but all in all, its s good base recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

This is absolutely delicious!  I followed this recipe plus what others did differently and added as well such as the diced tomatoes and 3 cups of tomato sauce.  I also added beef broth instead of water (I used more than 2 cups).  I used the entire cabbage as well.  On the kidney beans, I used 3 cans.  I also used a large pot instead of the slow cooker only because it was not going to fit in my 6 qt slow cooker.  I cooked this for 1.5 hours.  I added the cabbage about half way done.  Oh....I also added small red potatoes.  Delicious!

I love how rich and flavorful this soup is. I added another can of tomato sauce (15 oz), did not drain the beans and used 4 cups of organic beef stock. I used the entire head of a small cabbage.

Im not a cooking person. But was in the mood for cabbage soup.
It came out perfect. I made it less soupy, more  casserole. I would put it over rice.. But it never got to that Bc we were eating out of the pot. It was so good!!
I would add extra 1/2 lb. of meat next time.and maybe another can of kidney beans.. It came out great. And it was so easy.

Amazing! I didn't brown the meat, just crumpled it and threw it in the crockpot. SO moist. Also added red pepper flakes, subtracted 1C of water and one can of beans. It's thick and delicious.

My husband and I loved it! So easy and a total comfort food. My husband actually said it's one of the best things he's ever eaten and to please save the recipe.

The only thing I changed was that I did not have cumin so I used ground cayenne pepper instead.

I will say though if you are sensitive to the effects of beans, cabbage and onions, well, you know...

I made this tonight and gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because i made changes. This was an awesome foundation. I used ground turkey and also added some Italian sausage which was awesome. We like some heat so I added red pepper flakes and some cayenne. I diced up several garlic cloves, and also added Italian seasoning and Worcestershire.  I used tomato sauce from my own garden tomatoes and two small cabbages from my garden. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and one can of white kidney beans and one can of red kidney beans. It was AWESOME!!!

Just made this a few days ago and I love it.  I think I put in a bit more than 5 cups of cabbage and I had to add about another cup of water.  It turned out like a thick chili and really reminds of the chili from Wendy's.

When I showed my husband the recipe, he didn't like the idea at all (cabbage).  I made it anyway.  :-)  As usual, I tried to reduce the sodium.  Didn't bother with the vegetable oil, because the skillet I used is well-seasoned.  I added a little garlic powder while browning the meat.  Used no salt added/reduced sodium beans & 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can petite diced tomatoes (for texture).  Skipped the 4 bouillon cubes and 1 tsp salt; instead I used low sodium beef broth and a little beef Better Than Bouillon instead.  Toward the end of cooking, I tasted & added maybe 1 T sugar and a fair amount of Worcestershire sauce.  Next time I will likely reduce the cumin, and add some paprika.  ~~  Husband enjoyed the soup (said it was good), but our daughter didn't eat much (not a surprise).  I mostly liked it, but will adjust the seasoning a little the next time.

I had searched for years for this recipe!! We had this soup at Shoney's in Mobile, Alabama after working at an outdoor event in December. We were chilled to the bone and this just warmed us up instantly.  I made this yesterday and DH loved it. My 87 yo Mom also loved it. A neighbor stopped by, joined us at the table and left with a "to go" jar of soup and a print out of the recipe!!We love this recipe. Thanks for a very happy end to our search for this healthy, warming, soup, NancyScott - well done

This recipe caught me by surprise how delious  it was and how much my entire family loved it... I have picky eaters at everyone gave it two thumbs up! I added Tapatio Hot Sauce to it which gave it a great flavor. I loved how much this recipe made we had leftovers and it was tasty the next day too.  It's nice finding something that is quick to prepare and makes the family happy :-) I will definitely be cooking this dish again soon.

It gets 4 from me, simply because it needs paprika and to be served over rice. Like a lazy way to make stuffed cabbage.

I'm another fan of Shoney's cabbage beef soup and since they went out of business in my area I've been in serious withdrawal...I'm also trying to eat more healthy and this soup is ideal.  I did make a few changes based on available ingredients and my personal preference of wanting a more spicy soup.  Changes I made:
I skipped the vegetable oil because I cooked the hamburger straight from a frozen block.  I used ground chuck vs ground beef.  I used one frozen bag of "stir fry mix" from dollar tree which has red and green bell peppers as well as onion in it along with about 1/4 cup dry chopped onion.   I added a can of tomatoes with green chilies (rotel).  I used a 27 ounce can of creole creme style red beans.  I used 2 cups of beef broth and skipped the bouillon cubes. I used a 24 ounce jar of Basil pasta sauce and finally I used "french fry seasoning" for the salt and "garlic & pepper" for the pepper. I probably used 6 cups of cabbage as well...my only regret is not adding more cabbage after the first cabbage shrunk to make an even larger batch as I'd have more to freeze etc.  I used a 7 quart slow cooker. I think next time I'd try some minced garlic instead of the garlic powder

I enjoyed this and it had a good flavor.  Next time I will only use 1 can of beans though.  I couldn't get a bite with fewer than 4 beans in it.

My husband doesn't like things too tomato sauce*y so I only used a small low sodium can of tomato sauce. We have to eat low salt so I used low sodium vegetable broth for part of the water/cubes. I did have to add more water later. I love recipes that allow you to clean out the fridge/pantry so I used up a bell pepper, some carrots and lots of fresh garlic along with a whole onion. Used a can of Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes and a can of Ranch Style Beans. I also used my own spice mix. I realize I changed the recipe up, but this recipe lends itself to using up what you have and customizing it toward what your family eats. It was really good and even better today for lunch!

My toddler & I loved this! It reminded me of a thin, milder chili. When i make it again, I won't add nearly as much salt as the recipe calls for. It's great leftover too! I added canned tomatoes also. Overall, it is good... I will keep this recipe and cut the salt.

Just taste like chili with cabbage. I even omitted the cumin, added basil, oregano, garlic, and bay leaves. I liked it because I love chili but my husband didn't like it :-(

This is a great recipe and so easy to make. The only change I made is I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of one of the 14 oz cans of sauce and sprinkled in a little cayenne pepper to spice it up a little more.  Everything else the same and my husband has raved about it and said that I can make it again,  any time!  It's a keeper!

I have this in my slow cooker right now. I looked for a recipe that used hamburger and cabbage. I was happy to find this recipe as it contained ingredients that I already had. I did not add the salt; but did add garlic. I am looking forward to eating this. I printed the recipe and will probably make it again.

This was great & simple. I used ground turkey instead of beef and in lieu of the tomato sauce I used 1 can Rotel tomatoes and 1 can Italian seasoned chopped tomatoes.  It added a nice little kick.  My husband really liked it so I know it was good!  Giving 4 stars due to having made modifications. Thanks for the recipe!

this is cooking now and tastes like a yummy vegetable soup. i did add a can of mexican style stewed tomatoes to serve as a filler. aslo a little more cumin and cayenne to suit my tastes. nice easy recipe. thanks update:  forgot to mention i halfed this recipe and it made a ton. also decided to cook up some elbow macaroni and add. even though i precooked the noodles they wound up absorbing a lot of the liquid so i added a little more tomato sauce and half a can of bef broth. came out great.

This is good soup.  I browned extra ground beef and onions on the weekend (when I made spaghetti), making it very easy to pull this soup together on a workday.  I added fresh-cut carrots.  I cut the cabbage in large shreds to help it hold it's shape in the slow cooker.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours (then it set on the "warm only mode" for about 2 hours).  This delicious soup was nice to come home to.

Use a can of beef broth instead.  Comes out tasty, though I feel like I need to add something more to really put it over the top.  Very good simple meal, though.

Very good recipe!  I used canned beef broth (2 cans), 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 8 oz. can tomato sauce, and added chopped garlic.  About 1 hr. before it was done, I added a couple of small chopped potatoes, and some fresh dill, which gave it a wonderfully tangy flavor.

This tasted good, but it did not knock my socks off.  I'm probably won't make it again.

Nice hearty soup/chili.  I used beef broth instead of the boullion, also some diced tomatoes. Increased the garlic, onion and peppers.  Added a little cajun seasoning, worcheshire sauce and chili powder.  I love all the cabbage, might add even more next time!

I think soup is an opportunity to layer all sorts of flavors, but no matter what I did to this one, it just tasted like a bunch of stuff that came out of a can.  My kids liked it, though (of course, they also like canned ravioli), and they didn't notice the cabbage, so I suppose that was a good thing.  But this is not one I'll be making again.

Very, very good recipe.  I was not sure how it would turn out.  The only change I made was to throw in a can of pinto beans to sub a can of kidney beans (i only had 1)  Very tasty.  My husband that it was a lot like chili, I thought it was more of a stew than a soup.  Either way very tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great soup, and very easy to make.  I was hesitant the first time I made this a year or so ago.  But it was pleasantly surprising.  My 3 young children even enjoyed it.  We will continue to make this in the future.

This is more of a chili than a soup, and I find I really prefer it that way!  It didn't look like much going in and I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like it, but it was absolutely delicious and a great warm meal after leaving work on a cold day. My boyfriend loved it, too!

This was an excellent dish. I made a few modifications. The first was adding a teaspoon of minced garlic while browning the meat. In the slow cooker, I used three beef bullion cubes and one can of beef broth; did not add any water, only used one can of kidney beans (not drained), a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, and two stalks of chopped celery. I used nearly an entire cabbage head. I served this with garlic bread. Husband loved this dish!

This was just okay for me.  I love to make soup and I try tons of different recipes in the winter.  I was excited to find this because it had cabbage in it, but you can't taste the cabbage anyway.  I agree with another reviewer that it basically tastes like chili (but you can see cabbage in it.)  It tastes fine, I just wasn't looking for another chili recipe.

Will make this again.  I didn't have any cumin so I used 1/2 teaspoon chili powder.  I also added 1/2 cup uncooked macaroni 1/2 hour before serving.  I also used package cabbage for cole slaw.  Very good!!!

This is a good soup, but not great one in my opinion. It's basically chili, with cabbage mixed in. Cumin of course is a very powerful spice that tends to "chilify" soups and that is defiantly what happened here. Due to the fact that a peeve of mine is people not following the recipe at all..and giving it a bad review...I did follow the recipe in spite of my cumin concerns. The only thing I did differently was I added beef stock in place of the water/bullion cubes, because bullion cubes are very salty and I have high BP...and low sodium stock is a good substitute. However it was good, and this is a good way to work more veggies into your diet. My 10 year old son even enjoyed it and he typically hates tomato, cabbage, and beans - so go figure. lol So basically, if you like chili, and like cabbage, you will enjoy this soup, but I've had much better. Thanks for the recipe!

We enjoyed this recipe.  My husband even took the leftovers to work the next day (which is a very, very good sign he enjoyed it!)  I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked on the stove.  The only changes I would make for next time would be to add more cabbage. There wasn't quite enough cabbage in a serving for our taste.

this recipe actually made me happy! My kids who are not big cabbage eaters gobbled it down and asked for more! Not to mention, these ingredients are filled with vitamins,minerals,antioxidants,and fiber. I told my kids if they finished their spinach salads they sould have seconds...and they did!! WOW!!! this is a permanent meal in my house, Thanks so much! SO YUMMY!!!!! Switched olive oil for veggie oil for the nutrition value otherwise followed as said.

When I first read this recipe I thought it sounded great, but worried about my family liking it. Boy was I wrong. They loved it! The only change I made was to add undrained pinto beans because I did not have the others on hand. Perfect to come home to after a day of sledding on the hill! 
Thanks!

I followed the advice from others and omitted the cumen all together. I used turkey meat and only 2 cans of the tomatoe sauce with one can of chopped tomatoes. I added lots of garlic and put it in the crock pot and went to work. Now it's after dinner and between the 3 of us, it's almost gone.This is definitly a dish I will be making again but maybe next time with homemade rolls.

Pretty tasty.  I hate cumin so I left it out.  I didn't love the consistency of the beef I guess because it had been in the crockpot all day.  There's a cabbage roll casserole on here the I LOVE.  This is similar except for the beans.  This makes a lot.  We'll be eating this for a week!

This was good but it made WAY TOO much for 2 people! I got sick of it after a couple of meals and still had enough for 4 more meals, at least. If I make it again I will cut it in 1/2.

This was excellent! Very similar to the cabbage beef soup served at my favorite steak house. For some reason I mis-read the recipe and only included 1 can of beans instead of 2. I was still great and will use 2 cans next time! Thanks for the great recipe!

this is a perfect soup for winter.  I like the fact that you can change the ingredients around to what you have on hand.

This is easy and very tasty.  I didn't have beef so used ground turkey, and veg. broth cubes instead of beef broth cubes, and used half tomato sauce/ half diced tomatoes.  Love the cabbage!

My husband hates stews and being a new mommy I gave it a shot. It makes alot of leftovers but we ate it all and most of our leftovers hot the trash. My husband just loved it, and so did I.

Somehow this recipe left me wanting more, especially based on past reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I agree with a few other reviewers--this is chili with cabbage.  Won't make again.

This recipe was sooo good I couldn't wait for my husband to come home for dinner so I ate alone. Mind you i didn't follow the correct measurements - I just did it on my own and made some adjustments.I left out the cumin, added celery, green peppers and used crushed tomatoes instead (that's all I had on hand).  I seasoned my ground beef with jerky seasoning, salt, black pepper, powdered garlic, Braggs* amino acids (like worchestershire sauce but, all natural no salt added) and chilli powder and garlic powder then let marinate for about 2-3 hours. 

I ate it with Kofta and naan, delicious. 
The only problem I had as delicious as it was, it didn't sit right on my tummy maybe 2 bowls was too many. I'm freezing the rest so I can eat it for dinner on those days I don't want to cook. This recipe is a def keeper!

We enjoyed this soup.  I used half a pound of ground beef instead of a whole pound because we are trying to watch our fat and calorie intake.  We ended up with less than 10 servings of soup, but that's okay--with just two of us, there is some left over for lunch this week.

This is an awesome soup! If you have picky eaters, cut the cabbage thin and small and they will never know it's cabbage!  I used 8 cups cabbage, and will use the full head next time.  The flavor is out of this world--great for lunch the next day!

This came out really good, my 2 yr old liked it.  I gave it 4 stars cause it came out to be more thick than a soup, more like a cabbage stew.  But it was still very tasty.  Made a lot for leftovers--so I packed it up into small containers (single serving sizes for later use.  Yummy!

Maybe I expected more after reading the reviews, but I was not impressed with this recipe.  I don't think I would make this again.

After reading the reviews I changed the following. 1 tsp Crole Seasoning for salt and pepper, 2 cans beef broth, 2 cans tomato sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes. 2 cans undrained chili beans and 1 head cabbage. This recipe is probably good as printed but I like to play around with them. Either way this is a keeper for me.

This soup was alright. My husband liked it but my daughter and I didn't are too much for it. I think the chili taste threw us off. I think it would make a good chili soup w/o the cabbage. Maybe add some corn.

Used entire head of cabbage; probably 2 times the amount recipe calls for. A bit too salty with the beef cubes; next time I will use half (2 cubes) the amount.
