Fabulous recipe! These muffins turned out light and moist with a touch of lemon. I subbed buttermilk for the half-and-half and cut the baking powder in half to compensate.  I added a bit of fresh lemon juice along with some lemon zest to heighten the lemon flavor which complimented the fresh raspberries beautifully. Next time I'd up the rapberries by an extra 1/2 cup.  I can definitely see this recipe working equally well with blueberries! I topped the muffins off with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven. They baked up beautifully in exactly 22 minutes. Perfect with a cup of tea!

GREAT FLAVOR, GOOD TEXTURE....I MIXED IN BLUEBERRIES WITH THE RASPBERRIES , ALSO ADDED A LITTLE LEMON ZEST AND MADE THEM INTO MINIS. MAKING THE MUFFINS SMALL, YOU REALLY GET THE BERRY TASTE.

YUM-O!!! SOO good! I did use whole milk instead of half&half and it worked out great. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and they were still a little sweet for my taste so next time I will try 1/2 cup sugar. These are also delicious with orange extract instead of lemon. GREAT RECIPE and it can be used with any kind of berries!

Deelicious.  For dairy allergies, I used coconut milk, which is great in place of half and half. I used raw sugar, half whole wheat pastry flour, a splash of lemon juice and sliced almonds on top.  I'm sure any combination of berries is fantastic, because blueberries and raspberries were great.  They rose nicely into perfect little domes. Great recipe.

Excellent recipe!  The batter made 17 standard size muffins.  I used 1/2 tsp. lemon juice and 1 tsp. of grated lemon rind instead of lemon extract.  Gave them a great lemony flavor.  The raspberries get very mushy inside the muffins which in my experience is normal.

Delicious muffins.  We'll be making these babies again.  We made a few substitutions since we didn't have the ingredients.  We used 1/4 cup cream cheese and 3/4 cup 1% milk in place of the half and half.  We also topped them with streusel from the Raspberry Streusel Muffin recipe.  The kids raved and called for them every morning!

These were really good muffins.  I sprinkled some coarse white sugar on the top before baking to give it a crunch.  1 tsp. of extract can be substituted for 1 tsp. lemon zest.

i love making muffins and have my own little eccentricities about it... like using buttermilk instead of other liquids. i have some to use up anyway, so I used 1 tsp. baking soda instead of baking powder, and swapped out the half and half for buttermilk. I'm sure the original recipe is great, too.. would've tried it if I had half and half on hand!

Because I do not have a jumbo pan, I used a regular muffin tin pan. I used whole wheat white flour, buttermilk instead of heavy cream (I'm running low on ingredients--tomorrow is grocery day) and in place of the vegetable oil, I used melted butter. Before sticking these in the oven, I sprinkled them with sugar to pretty them up just a little more. Most of my ingredients were organic. Pretty good raspberry muffin, my family really enjoyed them though next time, I think I'd like to add more raspberries and maybe some lemon zest. I think these would be good with a crumb topping or lemon juice/confectioners sugar glaze, too. NOTE: I got twelve large-ish muffins out of this recipe, 350* for 18 minutes was perfect.

These were great!  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I used a couple substitutions.  I used almond extract instead of lemon, and a frozen berry mix (blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries) instead of just raspberries.  I added some ground flax seed for some added nutrition.  They turned out great!  I haven't tried these with the lemon extract obviously, but the almond extract tastes awesome in these and if I make them again I will probably use the almond.

I followed others advice and used lemon juice and zest instead of extract. Every time I make these they never last more than a few days.

This is a great basic quick bread muffin recipe.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white, almond extract instead of lemon, and whole milk instead of cream.  Also, I used mini muffin pans and altered the baking time to 12 minutes.  They turned out wonderful!  I even overheard my son in the other room say, "Something smells delicious!"  I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking to wow the family for breakfast.

I had raspberries that had become a little "soft" and didn't do well atop cereal which is why I bought them.  I went looking for a recipe and found this one!  I had everything on hand so I went for it!  They turned out wonderful.  Even hubby enjoyed the muffins.  I cut the sugar down and used 1/4 c. and the rest, I used splenda.  These were yummy!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I subbed the half-n-half with coconut milk and at the last minute sprinkled the tops with white chocolate chips.  23 minutes at 400 in a jumbo muffin pan.  Made 6 large muffins.  I am eating one right now and deem it delish!

The muffins were terrific!   I used freshly picked raspberries from my garden.  After reading some of the reviews, I did add grated lemon peel and some lemon oil from King Arthur Flour, in addition to the lemon extract,  for a more lemony flavor.  I would make them again!

I've made these muffins twice so far - the first time with raspberries and the second time with blueberries.  They were amazing both times.  I do prefer to use fresh lemon juice instead of the extract and I think it compliments the fruit perfectly.

These were quite good.  I halved the recipe and made 2 different batches.  First batch was with NO changes.  Second batch I used 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 high fiber flour.  !/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda.  I used egg substitute (egg beater's) and subbed the cream for soy sour cream.  I also used 1/4 cup liquid lecithin for the oil. I added lemon zest to both and topped both with Fruit Pie Crumb Topping recipe from this site.  Both were equally delicious tho the healthier version didn't round up quite as much.  I did not fold the raspberries in but placed some in the muffin pans then added the batter, another few berries and then the rest of the batter.  This kept the berries whole.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good. I didn't have lemon extract, so used 1 tbs. lemon juice. I think I'll increase that next time just for some added kick, though, because it wasn't very strong. I think I'll try blueberries next time...then blackberries...LOL The possibilities are endless! My super picky kids really like them, and I do, too!

Made as is, except without a jumbo muffin pan made regular sized muffins.  They were not very lemony, which may be a fault of the brand of lemon extract I bought, I am not sure as it is not something I normally stock in the kitchen.  I was thinking that next time I start thinking about baking these I'd add the zest of a lemon to the batter, or maybe zest a lemon and use a mortar and pestle to grind it in to the sugar before hand to extract more of the lemon oils?  Will try again as they rose beautifully.  Thanks for sharing

Yum!  Super simple and good! I used what I had on hand.  No heavy cream so I used whole milk, no frozen raspberries so I used fresh.  My raspberries were a little tart but the muffins had a nice texture and were very good!  They rose beautifully.  I put sliced almonds on top before baking. Can't wait to try this recipe with blueberries!

Very good muffins that were moist and light just the way I like them.  I added a tsp. of lemon zest to the batter.  Next time I make these I will add more lemon extract or real lemon juice.  Couldn't really taste much lemon.  I also doubled the raspberries.  I got 18 standard muffins.

These were great!  I used buttermilk instead of the cream so I only used 1 tsp of baking powder.  I used 1 tsp of lemon zest instead of the extract as well.  I also used blueberries, blackberries and apple instead of raspberries.  They made about 18 regular size muffins and baked fro 25 minutes.  I found these to have a little more of a cupcake taste than a muffin taste but I thought they were delicious!

These were delicious! I used whole wheat pastry flour, 3/4 cup of raw sugar, fresh raspberries, and yogurt instead of half & half. (didn't have any!) I also didn't have lemon extract, so I zested a medium-sized lemon and used that along with the juice from 1/2 of the lemon. I made 12 muffins and a mini-loaf, and they were fluffy, tart, and sweet. So yummy!

Everyone loved this recipe!  I made normal and mini sized muffins and decreased the baking time by a few minutes.  Yummy!  Next time I will double the amount of fresh raspberries.

Delicious! I divided the batter in half before adding the fruit and added a generous 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries/raspberries to each half, so I made 4 blueberry and 4 raspberry jumbo muffins. I filled the cups to almost the top, and they had a nice high dome. I love the lemon flavor, and the muffins were very moist. Great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I had fresh raspberries on hand and was so excited to find this recipe! I substituted almond extract for the lemon, and added 1/2 teaspoon additional almond extract, then added large crystal, sparkly sugar on top with slivered almonds. My husband LOVES these muffins!

These are fantastic.  We made them with fresh berries right off the farm, added walnuts, and used almond extract instead of lemon.  We also substituted apple sauce for the oil.  We liked them so much that we made a second batch two days after making the first!

I rated these low because the raspberries (I used fresh) turned to mush inside the muffins, which was a turn-off for my family.  Maybe I did something wrong?  The overall taste was okay but I think they could have used a bit more flavor.

I used blueberries for this recipe. I found I really could not taste the lemon in the muffins after they were baked. I will try them again - using a bit more lemon flavoring and I will try it with raspberries.  I also found that they did not puff up a lot either so I ended up with smaller muffins than I was expecting.

These turned out quite well!  I used both raspberries and blueberries (divided batter in half), but made 16 muffins instead of 8 jumbo ones.  They only required about 14 mins cooking time and I decided to add the zest from half of a lemon (love lemon flavour!) and since I didn't have lemon extract, just squeezed the juice from the lemon.  My oldest son ate 2 in a row!  They remind me more of a dessert type muffin, which isn't a bad thing - yummy!

Awesome recipe! I used almond extract instead of lemon and two percent milk and replaced a half cup of flour with oat bran. I doubled the berries! Delicious!

Delicious! Very moist.  Other than adding the zest of one lemon, I followed the recipe and could not be more please.   I say I followed the recipe but I will admit that I seldom take the time to measure fruit.  I"m sure I used more than the recipe calls for.

I set the servings to 30 muffins, they came out great but were not lemony at all and I used 1 Tbs of lemon extract, 4 Tbs of lemon juice, and 2 Tbs of lemon zest. On top of that I used a lemon glaze and it still was not as lemony as I would have liked. I used Blackberries instead of raspberries. 20 minutes in 400 degree was perfect and I ended up with 34 in the end.

They were a little sticky, and cooking them slower and/or longer didn't make a difference.  They weren't as flavorful as I had hoped, but all in all they were a good muffin

These were pretty good.  I'm giving a 4 because I think they could use more lemon flavor (I love lemon).  But they are a very good muffin, and took no time at all to whip up, so I do recommend them.  I used evaporated milk instead of half and half, and blackberries in place of raspberries.  We had these with lentil soup and green salad for dinner tonight.

I have made these muffins several times, and they are delicious--especially with some lemon zest added to the batter. This recipe works out perfectly "as is".
