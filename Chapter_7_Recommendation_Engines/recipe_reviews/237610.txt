Delicious and very easy to make stirfry! I substituted cashews for the peanuts and red pepper flakes for the cayenne, and it came out great! I like REALLY spicy stirfry, and this did not disappoint. Great recipe!

My husband and I really liked this dish.  I neglected to notice the title "spicy" peanut chicken stir-fry...it really is very spicy.  I served with rice and that helped cut down the spice some but next time I prepare this dish I will half the amount of cayenne.
I also added a little garlic salt to the chicken while it stir-fired.  Delicious dish and I will make it again!

I made the recipe as is but next time I would definitely add some natural peanut butter and more soy sauce as both my husband and I felt like something was lacking. I am surprised that it wasn't very "peanutty" as that is how the recipe was described. But of course taste is a very subjective thing so perhaps to the creator of the recipe it is... Not enough for us though!

This was an excellent stir fry sauce. I doubled the sauce and used vegetables that I had in the fridge. Onions, garlic, broccoli, red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, snow peas and chicken. I served it over brown rice and we all loved it. I will make it again. Thank you for the great recipe.

Loved this recipe!!! My husband  mentioned 3 times this week that I hit a home run!! I order this when I go to a local Asian restaurant that I Love,  honestly,  I was surprised that this recipe is every bit as delicious as the very upscale restaurant!!! AND It is SO easy and quick to make!!!  I added  1 or 2 fresh hot Serrano peppers ( we like spicy) from my garden and used Uncle Ben's 90 second microwave Brown rice ...Yummy!!!  Will definitely make this   Over and over again!!!

Very nice dish, easy and quick to prepare.  Added celery and mushrooms and a squirt of ginger paste.  Used red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne.  Would have liked a bit more peanut flavor...maybe I'll grind them next time...

I love this recipe. I usually do it with shrimp instead of chicken.  I stir fry the veggies first and then add the shrimp to cook when I add the sauce ingredients.  I do a double recipe of the sauce with the exception of the Cayanne pepper. I just use 1 teaspoon of that. I like spicy but not that spicy!

I did add veggies, garlic and fresh ginger.  I only used 1 chicken breast which was enough for 2.  My better half was looking for more sauce.  Depends on how saucy you like it.  Really liked the taste.

I used chunky organic peanut butter instead of the chopped peanuts and it added a great dimension to the recipe. Any vegetable addition is ok too. The first time we followed the recipe to the letter but it lacked in something. It was made up with the PB.

Fantastic. I wanted to double the sauce, so used double the stock, soy sauce, and cayenne, and left the sugar, vinegar, and corn starch as indicated. Worked perfectly but was very very spicy. We like spice but this may have been a bit much. Next time I will use 1.5 tsps cayenne if doubling the sauce. I threw in other veggies as other reviewers had (mushrooms and zucchini). Mixed rice noodles into the wok so that the sauce got incorporated all the way through. Will definitely make again and again!

I did make a few tweaks. Some for available ingredients; some. I’ve been cooking and eating Asian food for most of my life. With my alterations, this was surprisingly delicious. I’ll make it again.

I've made this about 10 times at least. It's a favorite around our house. The only thing I changed after the first 5 times or making it, was I started using chicken breast. They're less fatty, I think.  Anyways, this recipe is delicious and pretty easy to make

The only thing better than a 5-star rating would have been leftovers!!!   But it was so good there weren't any.

This came together so fast.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  As per other comments, I doubled the sauce and reduced the cayenne.  It was perfect.  I will be making this again and again!!  Thanks for sharing.

Too spicy for me and I love spice.  I could only eat a little bit as the heat was too intense. I think with half the cayenne this would be much improved. This was fast and easy to put together and I think it just needs a few tweaks with the cayenne to be more suited to my tastes. My sauce was too thick though and I had to add water to the final product to get it turned back into a "sauce" rather than a paste. I didn't have chicken broth but I used the broth from canned chicken soup as a substitution. I might double the garlic next time as I like garlic and you couldn't even taste it. This would be easy to personalize and add in other vegetables with the red peppers or even other meats for a "Happy Family" type dish. Not bad, but simply too spicy to enjoy as written for me.

I doubled all the ingredients in the sauce except for the cayenne and the vinegar, but it was still much too hot for me.  I served with ramen noodles.  If I make again, I will increase garlic, only put a hint of the cayenne in and use chicken breast instead of thighs.
