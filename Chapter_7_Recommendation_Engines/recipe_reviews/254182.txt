Made it yesterday, and my husband liked it on is waffle.  I made it in my cast iron pot, cooked it to about 205 F. It is a little soft but very good.  I used raw sugar so it turned out a little darker, but that is ok.  Will be giving some away for Christmas.  Will be making it again next year.

I've never had or made a spicy jam before, but decided to try this recipe for the few peaches I had that needed to get used.  It is delicious! Since I just made about half, I am keeping it in the fridge, rather than canning.  Try it, you'll like it!

This jam is delicous! I love cinnamon so I changed the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I didn't have all spice so I added 1/4 tsp of ground  cloves. I gave this out last year as Christmas gifts and the family was sad when we used our last jar. Definitely a keeper!!

I really like this jam!  But it does take a lot longer to cook down than recipe said and it still comes out a little runny.  I think it’s a little sweet but my family thinks it’s perfect.

Tastes delicious and works with other stone fruit as well.  Had some on toaster waffles this morning.  The only thing I think it ‘might’ need is pectin or some other thickener.  I say might because if you’re not a fan of runny jam (I don’t care) you might want it thicker.  But tastes great and works as is for me.

This came out perfect. The spices were so delicious with the peaches! I made no changes at all. I bought more peaches so I could make it again this week... we've already finished the 3 jars I originally made!!

1st time I made this I didn't understand why no pectin was used, so used a bit of liquid pectin at the end to give it a thicker consistency.  2 wks later we opened a jar & must admit, ok on hot bread/toast, yet served cold from the frig. it was a bit too stiff - tastes GREAT tho'!  BATCH #2: Made it again (no pectin).  Delicious & better consistency! So far I used the called for 6 cups of peaches.  Each time I only got  4 EIGHT oz. jars of jam instead of the full 5 SIXTEEN oz. jars the recipes says it'll make. Am I the only one w/this prob.? 3RD TIME: Used 12 cups peaches & doubled rest of recipe.  Got TEN 8 oz. jam jars instead of just four.  Took more time, but was well worth it!  PERFECT gifts for the holidays!

I am now making my fourth batch this week because I can’t keep it away from my family and friends!  Definitely a crowd favorite!  And I decided to try a batch with 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. It was good, not quite as sweet, but not quite the peachy flavor either. Probably won’t do that again.  I also add some vanilla.

Took me a lot longer than recipe stated to make. You will need about 15 LARGE peaches for this recipe, and it is better if they are slightly overripe as they will peel much easier. I used a hand mixer instead of a potato masher and it worked ok, but the jam was still a little too stringy for my taste. The processing only worked for one of my jars- the other did not seal properly but it should be fine in the fridge. Additionally, it only made 1 1/2 jars of jam- not 5.

You can also substitute pears in this recipe. It's delicious. I give some away at Christmas to friends and they always ask in January and February if I have anymore left. We like it on homemade biscuits with our morning tea.
