I am so addicted to this stuff!  I didn't use onion, added some bell pepper, and used olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper instead of Greek dressing.  Also have used fresh dill, green onion...this is a really versatile recipe.

This salad was alright.  I think next time, I would put more of the vegetables, and less of the lentils, as they don't have much taste.  And maybe use a mix of grains, instead of just the lentils.

Wonderful salad!  I made this while we were on vacation and ate it at almost every meal.  I love lentils, but had not found a "wow" recipe in which to use them until this one.  I've made it several times since and will say that the choice of dressing really makes a difference.  I'd recommend Ken's Healthy Options Olive Oil and Vinegar, or one of the other higher end dressings.  I also added olives and green onions and used as a dip with pita triangles.

This was a great salad, and great for my first attempt at using lentils. I did add some bell peppers and just used olive oil, vinegar + salt and pepper for the "dressing"

This recipe looks and tastes great! I couldn't find canned lentils so I used a bag of dried lentils, cooked for 1/2 hr. I also forgot to get "greek" dressing so I used 2/3 cup Italian and 1/3 cup lemon juice. Turned out great and we had a ton! Using the bag of lentils we had eight cups of salad!

Adding lentils is a good idea to make a Greek salad more filling, but the texture of the lentils did not fit with the tomato and cucumber.  If you do make this, finely chop the vegetables to make it easier to eat.  Also, you can make the onions a bit tender by letting them soak in the vinaigrette for 30 minutes before adding them to the salad.  Next time, I'll just stew some lentils and dill as a side to the Greek salad.

This salad was awsome!! I didn't have greek dressing so I used the oil/dressing that came with the feta. I don't know what lentils are either so I used kidney beans. This was the top recipe that came up in my feta/kidney bean search. Brilliant.

I also added green pepper but didn't use the dressing because it gets moist enough with the cheese and tomato setting together in the fridge, especially if you use crumbled feta. It was a healthy salad for a hot summer night. Put fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder in it if it needs something.

We really enjoyed it ! It was so easy to put together and loved just having to open 2 cans of cooked lentils.  My husband suggested I add dried cranberries and slivered almonds (we got the idea from a restaurant salad) and that was a great idea!

Very good...started with dried lentils instead of canned and it turned out great. Only thing is that it makes a LOT...we had lots of leftovers!
