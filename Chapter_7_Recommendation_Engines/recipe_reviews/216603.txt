I make this dish whenever I have leftover chicken.  I just throw the chicken in a bowl with mixed veggies and cream of 'whatever I have on hand'.  I thin out the soup just a bit as it does thicken up while baking.  I also put a puff pastry in the bottom of the pan as well, my family LOVES the crust!!

Gram's Chicken Pot Pie Haiku: "Creamy comfort food. It's from 'Kraft', so I changed it. Still, a good pot pie." If this was a cook's personal recipe, and not branded, I may have followed it more closely, but the ingredients' list just seemed like it needed ... something else. So, I sauteed onion, garlic, celery, carrots and bell peppers in a little butter, mixed that into the bite-size chicken (which I marinated overnight in the Italian salad dressing), and used a couple cups' worth of random frozen veggies. As another reviewer said, this recipe is very forgiving for customization due to what you have on hand - cream of "xyz" soup, frozen veggie medley "123" - but it still needed some additional seasoning. (Maybe parsley, paprika, red pepper?) Also 30 min. was definitely not long enough for mine to be both warm in the center, as well as golden crusty on the puff pastry, but after all was said and done, it satisfied the random pot-pie craving that's been on my mind grapes.

Made this tonight and really liked it. Its simple enough that you can add tweaks here and there to really add some zing. I didn't have puff pastry on hand so I used two tubes of croissant roll dough for a full pastry shell, more like a traditional pot pie. Other than substituting the pastry, I followed the recipe as written but it did give me some ideas on extras for next time I make this.

I've made this recipe a bunch of times, and have used many variations based on what I have on hand at the time.  This can be made with any type of poultry, ham or even smoked sausage.  I make a double-recipe and usually use two different kinds of soup and leave out the salad dressing.  The biggest hit yet was just last night when I used one can of Cheddar Cheese soup with one can Cream of Celery .  Soooo cheesy and good.  Oh, and I add milk a little at a time till the thickness is just right for my tastes.  Try brushing a little melted butter on top of the puff pastry crust (in place of the egg), then sprinkle some herbs or Italian seasoning on top for a little extra pizzazz!

I forgot the Zesty dressing and didn't think it made a difference and didn't have any eggs on hand so lightly misted pastry with Extra Virgin Olive Oil and crust was perfect! Will definitely make again.

Great starter recipe.  I changed it.  Added can of cream of mushroom soup, bag of mixed veggies frozen, about a cup of frozen spinach, small bag of carrots/broccoli/cauliflower, small can of mushrooms, sour cream and plain greek yogurt, sliced red/green/yellow peppers, onions. This was a hit with my family.
