This chocolate cake is the first chocolate cake I have ever made from scratch. I will NEVER buy boxed again! I used 6 tbs of coco powder in the dry mix instead of baking squares because I didn't have any, so I just added 2 extra tablespoons of butter to  the milk and water mix and it turned out wonderful.
 Also I've never made sour milk before so I took another reviewers advice and put 1 1/2 tsps. of vinegar in the milk but it still was not sour in 5 minutes. I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds and it was seperated and was peeerfect sour milk. Thank you for this recipe. Everyone loved it!

Thhis chocolate cake is excellent.  Moist, chocolatey, delicious!  I'll never use a box again!  But one caveat...do not use spray to grease the pan or the bottom of the cake will stick.  I solved this problem by using butter and flour to grease the pan.

i loved this cake.  it was super-easy and came out so moist and yummy.  why do people even use box mixes?!  i used a cream cheese frosting which didn't go that well.  next time i will try a whipped cream frosting!  i had no problem souring the milk.  i just added a bit of vinegar to the milk and waited about 20 min.!!

This was a big hit, used 1.5 cups of sugar, and used regular milk, not soured, came out great. Used chocolate frosting III, My family is already asking for it for the next birthday party.

Aunt Mary has come up with an AMAZING chocolate cake!  Very moist!  Turned out fantastic and it was SO easy.  I was a bit worried, as the batter was very runny, but it baked up nice and fluffy.  I did add about 8 more minutes to the baking time just to make sure it was done inside.  Thanks so much for this one!

I thought this was OK but didn't think there was anything special or exciting about it.  I felt it was more of a snack cake, thought it was plenty sweet enough on its own and didn't frost it -- that would've just been too much.  It would be very nice if ingredients could be listed in the correct order - much easier to make sure everything's gone in that's supposed to -- and to keep me from panicking when it lists adding eggs and I don't see them... oh wait, they're up at the TOP of that list.

This is now my resident chocolate cake.  Very easy to make and everyone loves it. The hardest thing is getting the milk to sour.

Very good – an easy to mix up, uncomplicated, no creaming required medium-dark chocolate cake.  The batter is “runny” because it’s supposed to be.  There are many similar chocolate cake batters just like this that bake up with excellent results, just as this does.   I have a preference for butter over margarine, so I made that substitution, as well as using leftover coffee for the water.  Rather than souring the milk (1 T. vinegar or lemon juice and enough milk to make 1 cup – let stand about 10 minutes), I used buttermilk that I had on hand and think is a better alternative.  I made 12 cupcakes with a half recipe and they baked nicely (no caving in, no “muffin tops” and no high doming) in 20 minutes.  This cake is moist, chocolaty and flavorful.  I frosted them with a basic vanilla buttercream frosting.  I can’t imagine finding anything to dislike about this!

Easily the best and easiest "from-scratch" chocolate cake that I've ever made!  Have given this recipe to several people at work and all loved it too.  The frosting is scrumptious too.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, Jennifer!

I just made this cake today, and if truth be told, I haven't made a scratch cake in about 15 years. It came out moist and flavorful.  

I made a few changes:  I used butter instead of margarine; all I had for margarine was "I can't believe it's not butter".

I did not have unsweetened chocolate squares, so I used the substitution on the Hershey's Cocoa box.

I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar; it was plenty sweet.  I think box cakes are a thing of the past for my baking needs!

To make "sour milk" for this recipe, put 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice or white distilled vinegar in a 1/2 cup measuring cup and fill with milk. May need to wait ten minutes or so until milk curdles lightly (use before big clumping occures).  GREAT chocolate cake recipe!.  Easy and delicious!

Yum! This cake turned out very moist. The texture and flavor on this was almost identical to a Hostess chocolate cupcake. I'm hooked, this is a wonderful cake!!!!

I was really pleased with this recipe.  I was worried when the batter looked extremely thin, but proceeded to bake 18 cupcakes and they came out very moist and chocolatey.  The kids liked them alot.  Thanks for an easy, delicious recipe!

I followed someone's suggestion, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I regret that, and would have liked the additional sugar. Next time I'll use full amount. In a 9x13 glass pan, needed an extra 7 minutes of cooking.

This was just okay.  I attempted to make this cake into a layer cake.  It did NOT work.  I thoroughly greased the pans, but when I attempted to take the first layer out of the pan, the top of the cake came out while the bottom of the cake stayed firmly planted in the pan.  Not good.  It was a good opportunity to taste the cake at least.  :o)  The cake was nothing special.  The texture was a bit spongey and it did not taste overly chocolatey.  So putting aside the fact that the cake crumbled, I just did not really like the cake all that much either.  Oh well.

God Bless you Aunt Mary! I finally found the recipe I have been looking for-the perfect Chocolate Cake. It was moist, chocolatey and very very tasty. I teamed it with the Chocolate Cream Frosting II from this site and had a great hit with the family for my cousin's birthday! Thank You!

This was easy. Scaled it back to 12 serving for cupcakes. I thought the flavor was light. Cake moist. I paired it with fluffy pnut butter icing and the icing flavor was prominent.  All in all good. Only change was butter for margarine.

Awesome cake! I doubled this recipe for my daughters birthday cake though I left out 1/2 a cup of the liquid (used 1 cup of coffee, 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk for the doubled version) and had to sub the second 2oz of unsweetened chocolate with cocoa powder but no big deal there. I carved this cake into a Dora and it was dense enough to hold up to that for sure.

Very moist.  To make it gluten free I used Bob Mill's all-purpose GF flour.  I add just a little bit of vanilla extract.  Everyone loved it!  I could eat the whole myself!!!

Pretty yummy! I made this one because I was short of most items for baking (no buttermilk, no vanilla, no nothing!) and it turned out pretty scrummy. I DID, however, use twice the chocolate and extra butter. Only cons were that with only 2oz of chocolate it's probably not going to fix those cravings, and it was VERY sticky in the pan- maybe too liquid? Should have lined with parchment paper...

I don't know how anyone else got this recipe to work, but basic bakeshop principles show this recipe is off...aside from the fact there is not enough chocolate...this is why you do not bake when extremely tired....you miss big things.  I now have a huge mess in my oven to clean.    Thank goodness I have a cake mix in the cupboard for emergencies.

I'm totally baffled as to why some reviewers gave this 4 or 5 stars. If I were to take a bite of this without knowing what it was, I'd never identify it as "chocolate" anything.  I should have trusted my instincts when I saw a chocolate cake recipe on the wrapper for the baking chocolate that called for the entire bar, and this one was only calling for 2 squares.  I'm going back to Duncan Hines.

Yummmmmmmy! This cake was scrumptious, fast, and easy! Here are the changes I made, only due to the ingredients I had on hand: I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, whole fat buttermilk instead of sour milk, I sifted all the dry ingredients together a few times, and I did NOT reduce the amount of sugar. The batter was very runny, but even still it baked up fluffy and moist after 25 minutes in my oven (baked in a glass 9x13 dish.) While the cake was still hot, I poked some holes in it with a fork, and poured over a can of store bought chocolate frosting i had melted in the microwave. After cooling enough to eat, it was delectable!! Enjoy this recipe-it's a keeper!!

Made this cake twice.  Both times the chocolate ended up separating a bit, so it was like I had small chocolate flakes in the cake.  Also a very mild chocolate taste - I personally like a richer chocolate taste.

Wonderful!! I kept asking my mom for My Grandma Mary K's chocolate sheet cake recipe.  She couldn't find it so I used this one. It was fabulous!  It tasted just like I remembered.  It also does taste like a hostess cupcake and if I can find a good filling recipe I will make cupcakes out of it with cream filling.  Yum!! I did not have chocolate squares so I used 6 T. cocoa + 2 T butter.  I frosted it with Chocolate Frosting III from this site. *Note:  Mom found grandma's recipe and the only difference was that she added another 1/2 c. of shortening which I do no think is necessary.  This recipe is terrific!! Thanks!

Made my cake with 1 cup Splenda and 1 cup sugar and used regular milk.  Used two 9-inch cake pans and baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  The cake it ok - tastes like a chocolate cake, wasn't moist, wasn't dry and it didn't crumble when I put the icing on. Iced with Chocolate Frosting I.

So so good. I didn't exactly let the chocolate mixture cool to room temperature...didn't have the time for that...and everything still turned out great.  Awesome with a buttercream frosting.

My father went crazy over this cake...he prefers it with cream cheese icing to bring out the subtle chocolate. Nicely balances the icing.

I used 3/4 c baking cocoa and added another 2T butter as I didn't have chocolate squares and subbed hot coffee for the water. Fantastic chocolate cake! Thank you for sharing Aunt Mary's recipe!!

I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars. It's not that it was bad at all. It had a pleasant taste to it. However, the batter was rather watery. I wanted to use this cake as a base to a black forest cake so I wanted layers, obviously. I only have springform pans because they are easiest to work with! Lets just say I had to place a big sheet of aluminum foil on my bottom rack ;) lol so beware!!! But like I said, it just came out of the oven and I nibbled what dripped off to tast with my own chocolate buttercream frosting and is DID taste delish. Oh, and under no circumstances was I able to use the spoiled milk. I had it all ready in my measuring cup and it went down the drain ;) I used regular no fat milk. Which very well could have been my problem, but I did add an extra 1/3 cup of flour before placing in prepared pans. Hmm... now I'm not sure what it is! Oh well, I will make this again but I willll be making a few moree changes!! =)

I was very pleased with this recipe. I never use margarine but use butter due to the GMO's in margarine. Very great tasting cake. I use the buttercream frosting referenced. And was very proud to present the cake to my family.

I am not sure about this recipe. When I think of chocolate cake, richness and fluffy come to mind. I put all of the ingredients together and baked it and it actually came out very good tasting but they came out like brownies. This is a thick cake and does not rise much. To me, this was disappointing.

Just made this for our Christmas dinner.  FABULOUS!  So moist (wrapped in plastic as another reviewer suggested).  The batter was very liquid, but baked perfectly. I did add about 3T baker's cocoa.  Topped it with chocolate butter cream, whipped to be extra fluffy.  The cake didn't need a heavy frosting.  This will be MY chocolate cake recipe!

This was excellent...followed directions except I made my own sour milk (1/2 cup 2% milk w/ 2 tsp. white vinegar...let sit 15 min. until curdled or beginning to curdle).  Cake was very moist and delicious chocolatey flavor. I did not find this too sweet. Thanks!

This did not turn out well at all.  It was too light, fell apart coming out of the pans, and couldn't be iced back together.  Also, not a very chocolatey cake.  An old standby "6-minute Chocolate Cake" is much easier and better tasting.

It is a good recipe.  The texture was nice and fluffy.  The only thing I did differently was put less sugar and used semi-sweet chocolate instead of the unsweetened.  I will be making this cake again.

Perfect! One very important change though: the time is too long.  Cooked for the time stated it makes a good cake.  But it really needs less time and it's AMAZING.  I make two 9 inch rounds at 25 minutes and that may even be a few minutes too long.  I make it as cupcakes at about 16 minutes.

Nice, moist crumb, very delicate and slightly denser than boxed, with a slight crunch.  This is better than boxed, of course, since there are no trans fats or corn syrup!  To make the sour milk just put 1 1/2 tsp vinegar in the milk and wait five minutes for it to thicken.

I use organic flour, soured almond milk and organic sugar.   I also use 6 tablespoons of baking cocoa and add two extra tablespoons of butter.  My family loves this recipe and it's so easy to make.

Outstanding!! I was looking for a chocolate cake recipe made with sour milk and this one reminded me of one my mother used to make.  It was the best chocolate cake I've had in many years.  I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect.  So moist and no frosting needed - we served it with real whipped cream.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

The cake turned out great with a wonderful texture and was very moist. I used butter instead of margarine and greased the pan with shortening and it didn't stick at all.

In my view, this chocolate cake is pretty mediocre.  I used twice the chocolate called for in the recipe and it still wasn't very chocolate-y.  The 1C of water makes the batter very runny. Perhaps substituting milk for the water and cutting back on the amount a bit would help. I wouldn't bother with this one again.

I'm kind of a cake snob so I almost turned up my nose at this super easy recipe.  I'm glad I didn't because it is unbelievably moist and satisfying without frosting. I also cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups and used really past-its-date sour smelling milk. I can't wait for my milk to go bad so that I can make this again!

This recipe was amazing! I followed the directions exactly (except I didn't use sour milk, just regular). My husband ate this cake everyday until the pan was gone. I frosted it with the 'Chocolate Frosting II' recipe from All Recipes. If you are looking for an excellent chocolate cake recipe, use this one, you will not be disappointed!

I don't know what I did wrong (I followed the recipe exactly), but it just wasn't good. It wasn't good textured, it wasn't good tasting. Maybe I'll give it a go some other time, but I'll probably just find a new recipe.

I have made this cake twice now.  Both times it turned out great.  I don't have sour milk, so used regular fat free.  I don't think it is too sweet, but I LOVE CHOCOLATE!
I serve it with seven minute frosting!  YUM!
Thanks for a great recipe my whole family enjoys.

This cake is delicious!!!  I usually don't substitute anything when following a recipe but I did not have sour milk and I did not have vinegar to make the sour milk, so instead I used sour cream (1/2C).  The batter is very runny but the cake turned out supper moist.  We all loved it.

So rich and delicious!  I made the 'best buttercream' to go with it, though now I wish I'd used a dark chocolate fudge type frosting, as this cake is sweet enough without the uber-sweet buttercream.  Even better the next day! (if it lasts!)

Edit: If you have a stand-by Texas sheet cake recipe, try using the pour-over FROSTING on top of this cake.  If I wasn't already married, I'm pretty sure I could use it to convince someone to marry and/or impregnate me.
