I was pleasantly surprised by this! I only used a pinch of cumin and added mozzarella after broiling. I did use a knife to slice my bread (such a rebel). Tasty! Thanks :)

pretty good.  I think it needs more garlic, but I always think that.  :o)  Bf gobbled it up. When I asked him if he liked it, he told me he did and told me I was going to say it needs more garlic.  Little stinker . . .anyway, I'd add fresh minced garlic next time, but all in all it's worth repeating.  I didn't realize it needed to sit in the fridge for a while and so I just made it then put it on the bread right away, which was fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

We thought this was pretty good and quite different.  For my family's taste the poultry seasoning was a little over powering so will just omit it next time.  A fun variation to garlic bread!
