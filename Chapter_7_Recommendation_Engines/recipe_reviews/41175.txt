People who liked this had 2nd helpings but others didn't even finish their 1st helping and thought it had a "funny" taste (because of the avacado)and just pushed it around their plates. Mixed review totally.

I liked it Mom loved it Husband thought it was okay. The texture is creamy the flavor is sweet lime not overly sweet so it can be a salad or as mom says a dessert. The dressing is something I can live without but it does go well with the jello mold. I loved the texture so smooth and creamy.
