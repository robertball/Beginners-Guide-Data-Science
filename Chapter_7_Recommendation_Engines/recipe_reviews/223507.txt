Holy Cow, was this ever good!!  I served it during a girls spa weekend at our ranch.  I served the leftover amount to my husband 4 days after making it and it was just as good!

DELICIOUS!  This got me to write a review for the first time.  Made it the first time as written, except used a bunch of green oinions as they were on hand and just 1/8 C white wine vinegar for the same reason.  Put all in my Vitamix and absolutely loved every drop - so much so that I made it again right away adding a couple big handfuls of spinach - again in the Vitamix, for a healthy and tasty on the go lunch smoothie.  The spinach did not alter the flavor.

My only change was to omit onion since I do not like it.  My husband and I both thought this was wonderful when we sampled a spoonful.  We didn't eat it that night, but a couple days later.  Upon trying to eat an entire bowlful, we both found it was just too much.  A small portion as a side to complement another food item such as a chicken breast or pork chop would probably be perfect.

I'm going to jump on the band wagon for this soup.  Easy to make and refreshing on a summer day. The jalapeno pepper complements the cucumber and honeydew melon nicely.  I threw in some fresh dill just because I had some in hand.

The only recommendation I would make is to use only half the jalapeno at first and then adjust it to your desired level.  

Personally, I like the kick but for some guests it may be too much.  I must admit  that it was up there but perhaps it was just the pepper I was using.  (And I'm not shy about eating spicy food.)

This was so addicting! I have been making all kinds of soups this week, and figured I would try a gazpacho since I've never tasted, let alone created, one before. I was out of regular onion, so used green onions, and only had white vinegar instead of the white balsamic. The sweet and the sour and the kick of jalepeno in the back of your throat - it was amazing! Totally a winner for nights where I need something quick and fresh but still full of flavor!

I added an extra jalapeño cause I like it spicy! I put a dollop of Greek Yogurt on it to make it a little more rich and to kill the burn. Overall very tasty, I would definitely make it again. :)

BEST GAZPACHO OF LIFE.
The recipe is perfect as is - but I added cider vinegar instead of balsamic because that's all I had, and I added some fresh dill because I had it on hand.  Hats off to the chef for making my day with this recipe.

I have made this several times and each were either very good or excellent.  I have substituted depending on what I had on hand and it is a very forgiving recipe.  It’s great if you like to play around and see how modifications alter taste without risking having to throw good food and money away.  I like to omit the avocado even though I like them.  Using half the jalapeño works well as the heat is an after taste that lingers too long. Maybe wasabi next time?  Vadalia onions work better than white.

I thought this was a weird combination of ingredients, but it had enough stuff that I liked so I had to try it. So glad I did! What a delicious combination of flavor and sooooo refreshing on a hot summer eve. So good repeated within a week for my sister and her husband. It disappeared quickly??

This recipe is delicious!! Savoury and refreshing! I put my own twist in it by doubling the recipe and adding 3 chillies instead of jalapeño and using 1/4 cup coconut white balsamic and 1/4 honey ginger white balsamic instead of regular. Had a sweet and spicy Thai kick!

What a great recipe. Very refreshing. I've made it twice so far and haven't altered the recipe at all. I'm making it again this weekend for my daughter and son-in-law.

I actually didn’t use white balsamic, instead using dark balsamic and adding Greek yogurt. Got a bit of a darker color for obvious reasons but was still very good.

I've made this 4 times now.  I use the whole melon and the juice from a whole lime, but other than that I use the ingredients as listed. (I do add a pinch of salt but leave the pepper out as an option for others.) I've never used white balsamic vinegar before and am so glad to have been introduced to it!  This lovely cold soup is delicious. I want to eat it for all my meals and in between.  My husband is also a fan and in this summer's oppressive heat this delicately sweet soup is especially refreshing.

I love cold soups, and this one is terrific and quick to make.   The only change I made was to use less vinegar, 2-3 tablespoons.  It was spicy, which I like, but if you prefer milder heat, start with less.  Yum!

Crazy simple. Excellent taste pallet. I served it as an non alcoholic aperitif  in a cordial glass. It was a supreme hit. Must serve cold.

Made this as written with one change. Couldn't find white balsamic vinegar so I used another type. This was delicious! Just the right amount of heat. We drink this with a straw and it is SO refreshing! Will definitely make this again!

Excellent excellent!  An unusual blend of ingredients that works just right.  The only changes I made were to decrease the vinegar and add fresh dill.

This was really yummy. The only changes I made to the recipe was to use a little less onion and add a big handful of spinach like another reviewer suggested (for health benefits only...it doesn't affect the taste at all). I used a pretty big jalapeno and liked the extra kick. Great for a hot summer night.

I've never had gazpacho but heard good things and I was hesitant about making a soup in summer but this came out delicious and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day

I made this for company and they loved it...everybody asked for the recipe!  I tripled the recipe because there were six of us, but I ended up with lots left over.  I ended making it into a smoothie by adding protein powder.  It was really good like that, too!

This was my first time making any kind of gazpacho.  Absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to try another recipe...and make this one again for company!

Refreshing and delicious with a terrific balance. I went light on the onion but otherwise prepared as indicated. I was skeptical when I spotted this recipe, but it's definitely a keeper.
