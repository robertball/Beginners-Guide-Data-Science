Tasty. My crockpot doesnt have medium so I cooked for 5 hours on low.. 4 1/2 -5 hours is plenty of cooking. I would suggest a different roll though. I liked the sweetness but it was just too soft... soft meat soft bread... needed some texture

Three pounds of chicken breast was way too much for us. I used two pounds and still have too much leftover. I used the whole bottle of Franks Red Hot and one packet of dry Hidden Valley Ranch. Cooked for four hours on low and chicken was done. Next time I will remove chicken at three hours, shred, and cook for one additional hour. Star rating based on portioning and cook times from recipe; final product with tweaks was great.

This was a huge hit with the family! Not too spicy, just right, my 1yo even liked it. Very simple. 3lbs was not too much for this family. I did cut down cooking time to 4 hrs on high. New family favorite ?

I liked it... it came out really salty but that’s because of the hot sauce and ranch. I liked the balance of the sweet roll! 
Give it a try ;)

I followed the recipe exactly (minus the cooking time). It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be but it was good enough for our buffalo chicken wraps! Thank you!

My first time with this recipe and I made it as directed. A definite hit with the family. I'm a sissy when it comes to heat so one was enough for me but the genuine taste of chicken wings was good. We topped ours with ranch dressing.

3 ingredients, how can you go wrong?!? I was a bit concerned about using an entire bottle of hot sauce, but the chicken was tender and delicious. I served it on buns with a drizzle of blue cheese dressing which compliments the heat. Great option for hot summer supper

My family loves this recipe!  It is a regular for us!  I do add a block of light cream cheese to the chicken after I drain off most of the liquid.  I serve the chicken on King’s Hawaiian rolls, with dill pickles and blue cheese dressing!  Yum!

I made this for a family get together and everyone from my parents to my kids to their significant others, loved it! As they were eating, they were telling me I'd have to make it again!
 The only thing that differed from the recipe is that I cooked it on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken and put it back in the crockpot for an hour.

I made this according the the ingredient list. Unfortunately, I prepared it for a party without trying it out prior to the event. In my opinion,it  was terrible, and I would not recommend to anyone.

Came out good.  Easy recipe for Bachelor cooking.  Recommend Defrosting the Chicken first & not going from Frozen.   Real Zip & Tang.  Easy clean up.  Recommend going with the regular Bottle, I used the large bottle of Frank’s & it was a bit much for the recipe; but no issue with a little “Buffalo style Ajou” cheers

A little too spice for the kids. But otherwise a ZERO CARB low fat well seasoned Chicken Breast. 
For thawed chicken breasts 4 hours on low is fine. Check for done-ness to make sure.

We really liked this recipe and will make it again in the future. I served this on slider rolls with oven baked Parmesan potatoes.

Easy, cost effective, and delicious, this is a great meal you can box up and munch on for a few days.
