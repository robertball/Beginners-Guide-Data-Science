My husband and I loved these deviled eggs.  We are huge feta cheese people and I didn't measure the cheese, just added it.  I used white balsamic vinegar as I didn't want the brown to turn the yolks a funny color.  I did omit the olives, due to personal tastes.  The filling is so wonderful in these, that I think it would make a great egg salad spread to use with crackers, bread or a wrap.  I just used my small cookie scoop to fill the eggs.  I had a little of the filling left over, so I ate it on a couple of crackers.  Shyla, this is a great recipe that I will be using again!  Thanks for sharing!

Unfortunately, I realized I omitted the balsamic vinegar after I had stuffed the eggs.  However, they were still very tasty and delicious.    Next time I will be more generous with the feta cheese (personal preference).  These were wonderful and an excellent variation to the generic deviled eggs.

Tasted great, but the egg yoke mixture was a little less thick than I would have liked.   I may try again and leave out the tomato.

These were delicious!! Because of the basil and tomato, I'd say they are more like Italian deviled eggs rather than Greek. I plan to make these again for summer family get-togethers.
