This was absolutely delicious!  I substituted broccoli for the green peppers to humor my children and I think it made it even better!

i had a lot of left over havarti cheese after company left so i looked for a recipe w/ havarti. this was great!  Really, the 'Best Ever Pasta Salad'.  I didn't have bow tie pasta on hand so used small shells.  I'm a vegetarian and it is very good w/o the chicken. I plan to make it again for the holidays because it is also a very good looking salad - I think I will double the amount of pimento to add more red color.

I took this to a family party and got good comments on it. I enjoyed the mixture of flavors. I will probably make this again in the future. The only things I might change would be to increase the pasta to 2.5 cups and decrease the chicken by 1/2. There was a lot! Thanks for a great recipe!

This turned out super tasty. I added a small amount of garlic to it.  For the chicken I seasoned it with garlic sea salt and lemon pepper.

I made a couple minor changes, but this still came out very tasty.  I substituted thawed frozen peas for the green pepper  (food allergy) and instead of using regular chicken breast,  I used a large bag of Tyson precooked,  precut grilled chicken breast strips. My oven was out, but I think I'll probably keep this change just for convenience.

The dressing is wonderful--but 3 cups pasta was necessary for good ingredient balance. Adding chopped pepperoncini was a big improvement.

We modified this slightly with cheese we had on-hand. However the dressing for this salad is what really makes it! We're definitely keeping this recipe around for the summer months!

Sorry, I would say not the best.  I tried this because I love Havarti cheese, but I thought it was dry, and even with all those ingredients, still did not have a lot of flavor.  It's OK, but just does not seem worth it to me to make again.
