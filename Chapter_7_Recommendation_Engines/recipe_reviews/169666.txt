I was skeptical to be the first to try this recipe, but it came out really well! I used this recipe as a topping for veggie cornbread casserole to REALLY get the veggies in there, and it was a big hit! I used the diced frozen broccoli for ease, and a ts of b.power bc I didn't have soda but it rose fine anyway. I think I might add some garlic to it next time, to boost the flavors. This recipe's a keeper, thanks!!

This was barely okay.  It stuck to the pan, and was kind of bland. It did taste very broccoli-ish, so it fills the veggie requirements, and it did not have too much oil in it, so it was healthier than most cornbreads. I do not think I will make it again, though.

I might have used a different type of cormeal, but this recipe didn't turn out like I expected.  It lacks of flavor and consistency.  I might have used more milk and some cheese, I don't know. Thanks anyways!!

I substiuted Jiffy mix for the cornmeal.  Had to add a little more milk but they came out great.

We did not care for this at all. Mine came out dry and salty with little flavor.  I may attempt this again to see if I did anything wrong--I follow the recipe exactly. But will likely look for a different recipe.

I think the cornbread needs to be presoaked... there isn't enough liquid otherwise... I I made this with about 1/2 cup milk  in the end and was about right. As i mixed it in 2 tbsp at a time, it kept soaking it up.
