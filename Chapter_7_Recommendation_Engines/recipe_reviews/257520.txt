The sourcream/mayo mixture was over powering to the imitation crab. Next time I will add the mixture to taste with the crab. A pinch of cayenne would help too.

This is delicious as written. Thanks for sharing it, but it would have been better and more honest though not to name it as 
"Crystal's", since it can be found online (word for word) at Tasteofhome, where proper credit to the original publisher was given. (It was originally published as Seafood Nachos in Light & Tasty February/March 2002).
