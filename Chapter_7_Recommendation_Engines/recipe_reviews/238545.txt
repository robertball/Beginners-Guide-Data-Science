This is so delicious!! I've done a lot of baking but never tried a homemade buttercream. (So many recipes call for shortening! Yuck!) This is light years better than tub frosting and so quick and easy. I used instant espresso instead of coffee (because that is what I keep on hand) and Lindt Sweet Dark chocolate. The espresso adds a wonderful depth of flavor. Thanks for the recipe. I will never buy chocolate frosting again.

Very good, fairly easy, and rich frosting. I used this on a black magic cake for an existential chocolate experience.

This was a very nice & easy frosting...it pairs well with the Nairobi Chocolate cake & I'm sure will be a big hit at the scout bake sale.  I made according to recipe, but for personal use, I would decrease the sugar by 1 cup...but that's pretty typical of us, I do the same on our cream cheese frosting for Italian Cream Cake, we just don't like our frosting so sweet!

Easy recipe to play with.   I decreased the coffee at the end and added vanilla.  It was great!  Just what I was looking for.  I WILL use this recipe, again.

IT coffee 3-4T cream, add 1 tsp vanilla.Pinch of salt.Nice dark smooth buttercream frosting. Just enough for 8‚Äù round three layer cake

This is a deep chocolate frosting which any dark chocolate lover will enjoy.  I used the dark chocolate "Endangered Species" bar and Dunkin Donuts decaf coffee which made a fairly rich, deeply satisfying frosting.  The cupcake paled in comparison.  I will certainly make it again though this was too much frosting for 12 cupcakes.

My family's favorite chocolate frosting recipe - easy, dense and fudge-like! It wouldn't be a birthday cake at my house without this frosting on top.
