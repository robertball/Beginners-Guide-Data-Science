This is a great chicken soup.  I made it for my husband who is sick with a cold and it really hit the spot. I used only one onion but next time will try two as the recipe says. And I added salt and pepper and a little bit of italian seasoning. Also, I used chicken thighs since they were cheaper than a whole chicken and we like dark meat better anyway.My husband really raved about how good this was. Definitely a hearty chicken soup and a keeper!!

This is a great recipe and a fantastic fall meal! I changed a few ingredients, based on what I had in my cupboards and fridge. I used an orange bell pepper (instead of red); I added a cup of shredded spinach just before serving (extra ingredient---it wilts by the time people begin to eat it); I used about 5 frozen chicken tenders (instead of a whole chicken); I used fresh corn kearnels from one ear of corn (instead of canned or frozen corn).

This soup should not be eaten until it has been refrigerated overnight. The first day it was so/so, but the second day it was a wonderful, original blend of flavors.

This is a Great Chicken Soup.I just changed a couple things.I added 2 cloves of Garlic and Salt and Pepper. Instead of the Barley I used 3/4 cup of orzo. I also used a 3-4 lb Chicken and simmered for 2 hours instead of 1 hour before pulling the Chicken apart and then simmer again for 30 minutes before adding the orzo.
Doing this gives you more than 3 hours of cook time and makes this an Amazing soup no matter when you eat it.

This is a great simple recipe for chicken soup.  I find that poking an onion with whole cloves and adding it to the soup adds great flavour.  Also, if you allow the broth to cool and refrigerate overnight, the next morning you'll be able to skim off any fat that has congealed on the surface and you're left with a great fat-free soup.

My family loved the soup.  I just added a few extra ingredients--I added a head of garlic (chopped) and some cayenne pepper for a little kick.  My 9-year-old liked it so much, he asked me if I could rate it above 5 stars.

This soup is definitely hearty; lots of vegetables and chicken but very bland.  It is a good basic soup that can take many different directions depending on the blend of seasoning/spices added.  By itself, it's just so-so.

This was VERY good! I only rated as 4 stars due to the lack of seasoning. I halved the recipe, increased the barley a little, and added 1 t. minced garlic, 3/4 t. salt, 1/8 t. each of pepper, sage, thyme, and basil. It gave it just enough flavor without overwhelming you.  Without it I think it would have been fairly bland. My entire family REALLY liked it! Even my 5 year old raved about it saying "this is the best soup ever!" and he doesn't like soup! Very good! It will definately be made again! Thanks!

Amazing soup - flavor was wonderful.  Just what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I grated all my carrots.  The red bell pepper really added a nice flavour to the soup.  thanks for sharing!

Tastes amazing! I cheat by buying a rotisserie chicken from the local market. I throw away the skin and toss the chicken into the water with the vegetables right off the bat. It cuts down on my cooking time. There's enough broth to satisfy my fiancé and I (he loves it, I hate it).

This is a terrific chicken soup.  I doubled the amount of barley for a "fatter" soup.  I also agree that it's better after an overnight in the fridge.  It also freezes well.  It's a keeper for us.

At first my husband didn't want to add the barley, but when he did, he realized it added a wonderful texture to the soup.  We like extreme flavors, so he added a lot of extra seasoning.  All in all, a great soup.

This is a good base recipe, but it lacked any seasoning at all. I made as directed, but added salt, pepper, parsley, and granulated garlic after tasting. I served this with Rosemary bread and it was delicious.

Needs more seasoning, for sure.  Very bland.  I loved the barley in this soup, but the corn was not appealing to my family.

I love this resipe except with a few changes myself ---leave out the red pepper and corn there not needed in such a great chicken soup, I also use a tablespoon of ginger--so great if someone is sick with flu or cold or just under the weather a bit its great for all that ails you, as granma use to say. I grew up with this and its a hit with all the family on really cold days too. We call it chicken ginger soup though.

I really like this recipe but I have to add garlic, cilantro and tomato & instead of the red  bell pepper I used chopped jalapeño, I like to add potatoes & pasta (shells etc) salt, pepper & knorr seasoning + condiments and spices ...(Thyme,marjoram,rosemary,oregano, basil, savory and sage.)

Great recipe, loved it and it keeps you full ALL DAY!
I added some flour mixed with water to thicken it. You can also use corn starch.

I have a pot of soup cooking all winter long. My husband says this was the best soup I had made yet. I added 1 tsp. dried thyme and the juice of about 1/2 lemon to give it a little dimension.
