I made this without the sausage, just 1lb. ground beef. It was very good and I had four very large Portobello mushrooms and divided into 1/4lb patties.  I think the sausage would have spiced it up more but 2 pounds of meat would have been too much. Maybe 1/2 pound sausage 1/2 pound ground beef next time.

I added some fresh minced jalapeño and topped with extra sharp cheddar cheese.  Easy recipe.  Nice savory flavor.

Delicious!  I made it according to the recipe and it seemed a bit spicy (I love chorizo and I love spicy).  Next time I think I will omit the chili powder or cut back on the chorizo.  So tasty though.  Husband said he would give it 5 stars!  Will definitely make again!

So delicious! We had a lot of stuff that was going to go bad so we ended up throwing in a whole bunch of veggies and seasonings and sauces and cheese into the meat. We gobbled them up and had leftover meat to make meatballs with!

Really good!  I added some diced bell pepper and a couple of serrano peppers with the seeds since I like it spicy.  I made one patty just like a hamburger and put it over some lettuce and tomato and topped with avocado,  sour cream and salsa. I kept the rest raw and stored it in the fridge to have the next night cooked fresh on the mushrooms.  That was great too with some cheese sprinkled over.

I loved it, but my husband said that the chorizo overpowered it.  So , next time about half as much chorizo.

We love chorizo and mushrooms and found this to be a delightful dish. I assumed the temperature was the same throughout the cooking process and did need to cook the patties longer than stated to get to desired temperature but didn’t think that was worthy of a lower rating. The time to cook will depend on the size of your mushrooms and how high you pile the filling, thus the need to specify minimum temps. We plan to modify with baby mushrooms  for a party appetizer next time around.

No changes, other than making four larger burgers, rather than eight smaller ones. Cooked for 30-35 minutes rather than 20 called for in recipe.

It did not say the temperature after adding the paddings. I baked 30 min at 375F, it still did not reach to 160 degrees inside.
