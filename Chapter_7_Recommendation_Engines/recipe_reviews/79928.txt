The recipe would have actually gotten four stars had it not been for the raspberry vinegar that needed to be added at the end. It COMPLETELY ruined the chicken. I've used raspberry vinegar before, but this just did not mix with the chicken. It became so acidic and overwelming with the strange flavor combinations, that when I was putting the chicken onto a plate after letting it simmer in the vinegar, I literally began to choke on the steam from it. The odor of the spices and vinegar made my eyes begin to tear, and my nose and throat were also began to burn. My advice, DO NOT add the raspberry vinegar. Leave the chicken as it is with only the lemon pepper because it tastes great then.

I cooked this chicken for my family, and every single person who cooks asked me for the recipe.  It's a definite keeper.

My husband and I thought this was excellent, kids weren't overly thrilled with it.  That being said, I will be making this again.  Two reviewers mentioned the rice was mushy.  I made mine in a rice cooker and had no problems.  On the stove, you have to make sure all the liquid boils down and be sure to not stir it.  If you stir rice while it's cooking, it gets very sticky.  The flavor on the rice is very mild, but it's ment to compliment the chicken.  If you want a more flavorful side dish, definately skip this rice.  I thought it was great though.  HTH.

I replaced raspberry vinegar with 1/2 cup apple juice and a dozen fresh/frozen red raspberries and one Tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar.  It was absolutley delicious.  Thank you for this new recipe to be placed in my cookbook!!

The other day my friend and I tried to make this recipe, and we were very dissappionted.  Before we added the raspberry sause, the chicken was actually so delicious that my friend and I were afraid that the vinager sause may just ruin the chicken entirely.  We were right.  Not only did the acid from the vinager sause burn my friend's eyes as she was pouring the chicken and the sause into a serving dish, but the sause was not good at all.  At first I didn't think it was too bad, but after eating it for a while, I discovered how terrible the sause was because it did not balance out with the chicken at all.  We were so desparate that we actually dipped the chicken in raspberry jam, which did make it somewhat better.  The only reason why I am even giving this review 2 stars is because of the chicken we had made before we added the sause.  I advise everyone to make that and just skip the sause unless you want irritated eyes and a bad after taste in your mouth.

Delicious! The subtle flavors complemented each other so well. This is great for those who like something that's not overly potent once in a while. This is a definite keeper.

I thought this was excellent!!!  I would suggest stirring the coconut milk before pouring, since it seperated so badly.

The chicken was tasty and fast. The raspberry vinegar made a nice sauce. The rice, however, was not as flavorful as I would have liked and made too thick by the coconut milk. I think a side vegetable, like snap peas, would make a world of difference to this. Overall I'd say this dish has a lot of unfullfilled potential.

I would most defintely say this meal is very whatever. The rice is very bland and simple i would add in shredded coconut for more of a taste. The chicken is absolutely amazing before you add the vinegar. I would really just serve the chicken with the rosemary and lemon flavored. The rasberry chicken just tastes sour and not very good.

The Raspberry chicken was great!  Tangy, sweet, great reaction from my boyfriend.  But the coconut rice wasn't so good--a bit mushy, and pretty bland.  Next time I'll go with a different side dish.

This was excellent!  I'm from a small town and I couldn't find raspberry vinegar, so I substituted with pomegranate-basalmic, and it was absolutely delicious! My sister swears that it is restaurant quality, and the leftovers made my coworkers very jealous the next day...  An addition that I will try next time is some actual shredded coconut in the rice (an Indian student suggested it). Thank you!

OMG OMG this was divine!! I read the "too vinegary" reviews and to avoid that problem, I let the chicken simmer until nearly all the liquid evaporated or was absorbed. And the Rice was DIVINE!!! I've never had such amazing tasting rice before!!!  I served this with steamed broccoli that had been tossed with garlic butter.

I made this for some guests who seemed to like it. it reminded me of something at a chinese restaurant for sure, but probably less bad for you :) I know it's not the same at all, but instead of raspberry vinegar I used blueberry syrup and white vinegar lol. I thought it was good. but maybe Im not the one to ask because I dont mind a potent vinegar taste at all. SUMMARY: VERY GOOD AND LOTS OF INTERESTING NEW FLAVOUR COMBINATIONS

The rice for this is awesome. I made it in my rice cooker and it turned out perfect. The chicken tasted very good and was moist. Myonly complant was the color of the chicken. I used raspberry balsamic vinegar, and when i reduced it, it turned black.

Actually ended up baking instead of using stove top. So I followed the same directions with breading chicken,except added rosemary in with flour and other ingredients. Then mixed the raspberry vinegar with a little olive oil (used a little more of each). Stirred chicken while cooking and kept adding the raspberry vinegar & oil throughout cooking. Skipped the rice and grilled red & green peppers with onions - seasoned with lemon pepper, rosemary, and white wine vinegar. They complemented each other very well. Made the kitchen smell delicious and tasted even better!! I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

I made this exactly as directed except I did not have the raspberry vinegar. Instead I used chicken broth and a little soy sauce. The result was a yummy dinner that  I was able to make with just what I had on hand. Thanks for sharing, I've already been asked to make it again soon!

I tried this last night because I'm always looking for something a little bit different. It came out great and my fiance, who is a very picky eater, LOVED it. He said it tasted like sweet and sour chicken with a raspberry twist. I couldn't find raspberry vinegar at my local grocer, so I just used raspberry vinagrette which probably gave it a sweeter taste than it would have had.    I made the coconut rice with just water and coconut milk and then topped it with some toasted coconut when it was done because fresh ginger is very strong and my fiance doesn't like it. It went well with some steamed sugar snap peas on the side. Maybe I'll go back and try it with the ginger next time though, just to satisfy my curiousity.

This chicken is amazing.  The reviews that said it was too vinegar tasting must not have boiled it down enough.  It `makes 1`a nice, fairly thick but still light sauce.  It isn't supposed to be watery.  The rice could have been better but the chicken was way better than I expected.

I have made this several times in the past and my husband and I love it. I only used 1 cup water and subsituted litehouse walnut raspberry vinegrette. I added a bit of chicken stock to de glaze the pan before adding the vinegrette and topped with a few fresh raspberries. Will def make again!

The mix of the sweetness of the rice, in which I added a little bit of shredded coconut and some sliced almonds, and the chicken in the vinegar sauce was very good. A keeper!

This recipe is one of my favorites.  It has such a nice taste and is really easy to make.  I made it over Christmas for my parents and my mom asked for the recipe and now makes it all the time as well.  When I make it I usually add some mushrooms when simmering the sauce and they really add to the dish.

WOW!!  This is wonderful.  I was unsure of the two distinct flavors together, however I made the recipe as is, and loved it.  My husband and my Son, are always skeptical when I try something new, but they both liked it as well.  I will definitely make this again.

I hate it when people write a negative  review after  making a recipe for the first time and change a few ingredients.  Well after reading all the reviews I decided to make this anyway. It was awesome and yes I did change a few items only because  I had them on hand.  The first change was using 2 cups chicken stock instead of water and  and 1 3/4 cup Silk Coconut / Almond milk instead of plain coconut milk. I cooked the rice in a rice cooker so it wasn't over done or mushy. It came out very tasty and perfectly cooked. I used black pepper because I couldn't find the lemon pepper in my pantry which worked nicely with the flour.  After removing the chicken from the frying pan, I fried the rosemary a little because I forgot to put it in at the same time as the chicken. I  sliced up a green pepper, putting that in the frying pan too before adding the vinegar. I used a cranberry  balsamic  vinegar to reduce and it made a beautiful glaze on the chicken. I  wish I would've taken a photo to share but my family inhaled dinner too quickly. This is a keeper for sure!

It was bland and the overabundance of liquid ruined the texture.

the vinegar was completely overpowering! So much so that one of my children had a hard time breathing around the fumes. I wouldn't add it again We all loved the rice (even though my 5 kids generally don't like rice!)

Flavorful chicken. Rice needed salt or less water or both.  It was a little "crumbly" even from the rice cooker, but the coconut flavor was just right.  It just needed "something".  Not really a sauce for the combo but still a suitable match.

I agree with others who say that the raspberry vinegar totally ruined the dish.  Perhaps I didn't reduce it enough... perhaps more time spent reducing would let more vinegar evaporate and reduce the intense vinegar taste.  Besides that, the proportions for the rice seemed off:  it calls for over 3 cups of liquid for 1 cup of rice; my basmati rice instructions say 1 1/2 cups of liquid for 1 cup of rice.  I used 2 cups of rice instead of one and the rice cooked up fine, though I didn't like it.  It had a too-intense coconut flavor.  Also, 1/3 cup flour for that amount of chicken did not seem like enough; I used 2/3 cup.

This was delicious. I read some of the negative comments, but tried it anyway. My tips are to shake the can of coconut milk very well before opening it to avoid the need for stirring much before cooking. USE BASMATI RICE!Do not stir while cooking. I used only 1 tsp of jarred fresh ginger but will use more next time. All you need is a little salt at the table and the rice is great- creamy and delicious. The chicken was perfect- just be sure to let the vinegar reduce- you do not have to stand by the pan breathing the fumes:) It only takes a few minutes to reduce.

My husband and I were having date night in, and I thought I would make this because I had it in my recipe box so long, and I never tried it.  I'm glad I did.  Talk about flavorful and fragrant!  This one is definitely a keeper!

Good recipe.  The rice was great, but I cooked it with the coconut milk and added a little extra water because the amount called for seemed like way too much.  I also put the vinegar in right after taking the chicken out which de-glazed the pan and reduced the vinegar making a small amount of syrupy sauce to put the chicken  back into.  I was a little concerned about it being too 'vinegary' but once it reduced down it was fine.

I could only find raspberry wine vinegar and I had the same experience that a few of the other raters had when cooking up the vinegar: the smell became unbearably strong.  It even stung my eyes to walk into the kitchen and I can still smell it and it's been 2 days! My boyfriend thought the smell might make him sick! I only added a few pieces of the chicken to the vinegar to test it out and b/c the smell was still so strong, I wasn't up to tasting it on my chicken, so the chicken was pretty good without the vinegar.  And since many people noted the blandness of the rice, I made the more highly rated Asian Coconut rice and that turned out well.

This is SO good.  The only suggestion I would make is to cut the water down from 2 cups to 1 cup when cooking the rice.  Since a can of coconut milk is used I think 2 cups of water is too much as it causes the rice to be over cooked.

One of my favorite recipes I have ever made.  I absolutely love this one and so does my family.  My husband does not even like raspberry but he loved this one.  The rice is wonderful as well...

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, although it definetly made a LOT of rice for us.  I couldn't find raspberry vinegar so I ended up using Renee's raspberry vinaigrette and it tasted wonderful.  This is a recipe I will certainly do again.

My daughter thought this was delicious but I just thought it was ok.  It seemed a bit like the 'sweet & sour' dishes you might get at the Chinese takeaway.  
Also, like other reviewers, I liked the chicken better prior to adding the vinegar.  I also had to add some garlic, salt & pepper to the sauce to tone down the sweet/pungentness of the vinegar - may have also benefited from some cream (I didnt have any).  I think the other raspberry chicken recipe on here is much preferable, esp with a few tweaks.
However, I did like the rice (nice smooth & subtle taste) - I simply put in microwave instead of boiling on stove.
Thanks for the recipe - I am nearly out of the raspberry vinegar I was given now!
