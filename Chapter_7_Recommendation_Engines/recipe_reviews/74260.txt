This dish depends entirely on the Alfredo sauce you use.  I used a sauce I know I like, and it came out great.

This recipe was delicious. Made it for company, so I had to omit the red bell pepper and mushrooms, but it was still very tasty. I couldn't find 17 oz of Alfredo sauce anywhere in the store. So next time when I make this again, I think I will use a little less pasta. But overall, this was easy and very good!

I prepared this with no changes and the dish turned out delicious!!!  I made the full 6 servings and believe me the leftovers will be eaten for lunch.
