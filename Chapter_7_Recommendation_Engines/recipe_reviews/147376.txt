Not the sofrito I was looking for.

Margie's Cuban Sofrito is the closest I've found to what I know as Sofrito.

I guess Sofrito is like Ragu, your mama's is always best.

This had no flavor.  I ended up putting some oil in a pan, and cooking it down to take the bite out of the onion and garlic.  I added cumin, salt, pepper, bay leaf and oregano in order to get a similar flavor to what I was looking for.

I understand the caribbean has a lot of islands and this mixture of vegetables seems more suited for flavors like allspice, cumin, and habaneros.

I scaled this down and blended into chunks and used in place of salsa.  Were all pepper lovers here and it turned out very good. Can't wait to try it in other dishes. Thanks for the post.

I never had sofrito as a american girl but my cuban hhuband and brothers did not like this one at all. They said maybe it Puerto Rican Sofrito but not Cuban. I don't know. I never had it. I though it was OK. but 5 of them beats me. I was so sad. They like it but was not happy that it was not like there mom's. We all have been tring to find a recipe that is Cuban style sofrito to make ropa vija which is my husband fav.

Authentic or not, I am a huge pepper, cilantro, and tomatillo fan. That being said, I whipped this up for an afternoon snack. I did scale it down from 96 to 24, seeing as I was the only one eating it, and other reviewers stated the original amount makes quite a bit. I'm glad I did. I served this over white rice (tasty!) and also used some as a salsa for tortilla chips (perfect mild "salsa"). Great recipe, thanks.

Not bad but as written makes a lot.  Perhaps cut in half?  Adding lime and salt also really helped spruce up this dish.  Makes a tasty addition to seafood, meat, etc.

I can't comment on its authenticity, but I liked the ingredients, and thought I'd give it a go. I initially made it as written but ended up adding salt, more garlic and also some hot sauce. I threw in some jumbo shrimp, and it was really good. Served it over rice. Husband enjoyed it alot. Thanks!

I have been doing this for years.  This process will cut your cooking time to almost nothing.  If you use a plastic spoon to draw from the jar, it will last a lot longer.
Excellent tip

In Puerto Rico Cuba or Dominican Republic we don't use tortillas nor green onions and no orange or yellow bell peppers either.
We use onions white yellow or purple fresh cilantro garlic green and or red bell pepper, abilities which are a small greenish yellow pepper resembling a scotch bonnet but without almost no heat and tomatoes is optional we blend all these together in a blender or process in a food processor.
The ratio is about 1 to 1 ,some people use a whole head of garlic..but THESE ingredients are authentic to Spanish speaking Carribbean Socorro.

I'm Puerto Rican and I make my own Sofrito, but I was interested in trying this with all the tomatoes as traditionally Puerto Ricans do not put tomatoes of any kind in their sofrito.  It was ok but needed a little salt and pepper in the batch. Also sofrito gains flavor with time otherwise it will be bland. When making a batch of any sort let it sit overnight in the fridge. It could make all the difference in your meal. Also amazing to let your pork or beef marinade in over night. I'll be posting a few authentic recipes soon.
