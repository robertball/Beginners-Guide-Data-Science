This had a very nice flavour.  After chilling in the fridge for awhile, though, mine was still completely liquid, not syrup at all. I made it exactly as the recipe stated but perhaps I measured my butter incorrectly or something. No matter, even though it was liquid I put it on my oatmeal pancakes and it tasted great! UPDATE: I also recently made this to put on Strawberry Vanilla Pancakes from this site and that was a great flavour combo! Was still very liquidy again, but not a big deal.

This is not the typical syrup but I really did like it.  I put it on buttermilk pancakes and found it to be a light, pleasing taste.  I did use 1 teaspoon of vanilla becuae 2 seemed too much.  I could always add more I decided.  For me 2 would have been too much.  Do try!

I upped this recipe to four servings. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. That was the only change I made. We had this over Herman pancakes and it was so good--though it had a LOT of vanilla. Quadrupled, it was two tablespoons and two teaspoons of vanilla! I'd like to make this again cutting back a bit on the vanilla and with a touch of cinnamon. Very simple and a good fill in for when you're out of pancake syrup.

Very good.  Used coconut milk because I didn't have regular milk on hand.  Used only one teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Not very thick but tasty.

I did a test run on this syrup without having a reason to use it but I tasted delicious and I'll definitely whip them up the moment I'm in need of a syrup.

Excellent recipe. Of course you will have to adjust it to your liking like any other recipe. However I utilized the ingredients asked for and did as the recipe asked. The only thing I did that was DIFFERENT was not mix everything up once the honey and butter was done in the microwave melting. Instead I poured a little bit of the milk and vanilla (mixed up already) into the honey and butter. 
I did not feel the need to let it sit in the refrigerator. It was great this way. Of course I through some of the milk and vanilla mix away because I only wanted to use a little bit which kept it from being so watery. Such a lovely taste. Thank you so much.

Oh my vanilla! The syrup was verrrry liquidy...I put it in the freezer to try and get it to congeal...it only helped a little. The biggest issue here is the amount of vanilla. I made 4 servings of this and my gut told me 2tbs & 2tsp of vanilla sounded absurd, but I did it anyway

I made this due to not having any maple syrup, it was really good !! . I doubled recipe. I used our stove top and put the honey in plus vanilla let that honey reduce its thickness then added the milk and butter .. I set aside and it thickens up after letting it cool down .. Turned out great .. Light taste . Just made some   Ragluar pancakes

Very good flavor. Just made for the first time. I am about to make pancakes, and know it will be great. It is very thin, not sure what to do about that, but it tastes wonderful.

This recipe is amazing! I made it(4 servings)  using halb of the vanilla  as recommended  by other reviews. It is thinner than traditional  syrup but I liked the light flavor and texture  much better. We had it over waffles with fresh blueberries on top, delish!!!

This was a nice syrup recipe, although it was too runny. It had a nice balanced flavour.  Also, I added just one teaspoon of vanilla instead of two. Tastes great with pancakes!

This was so yummy and fast. I made the recipe to feed 8 people so I did 2 tablespoons butter and milk, 1 Tablespoon vanilla, and 3 Tablespoons Honey and then followed the directions. I will be making this again.
