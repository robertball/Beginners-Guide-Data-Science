Since I am of that "vintage age," this recipe did bring back wonderful memories as the submitter suggested. An easy to make cheese ball that requires minimum ingredients. Always a hit for a delicious appetizer.

I was looking for a simple appetizer that would complement the pineapple used to make my Easter ham. I love how simple this cheese ball was but I suspected it wouldn't taste like much more than cream cheese with little chunks of pineapple in it. Unfortunately, I was right. While making it, I considered adding in some of the pineapple juice for more flavor but figured it would make the mixture too loose. I also thought about toasting some coconut and mixing it in, but didn't. I wish I had; it may have jazzed it up a bit. Otherwise, it was a bit too bland to make again.
