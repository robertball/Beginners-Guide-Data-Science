I'm the person who submitted this recipe and I appreciate all the feedback, both positive and negative. I use the largest cukes I can find and use the full tablespoon of sea salt because "water follows salt" (think "Osmosis").  Adding salt to cukes, zucchini, etc. will help dry them out. You most certainly can decrease the amount to suit your taste but as the majority of reviewers mentioned: you MUST drain the cukes thoroughly or you'll end up with a runny mess. I like the idea of using a salad spinner (an item I don't have) but I have to rely on time and patience when I make this (or squeezing by hand if I'm in a hurry and they're still too wet after 30 minutes). I'm glad that most of you have enjoyed this recipe, and I also enjoyed seeing some of the twists on it.

This cucumber salad is very tasty!  I salt my cucumbers for a bit and then drain them.  You always have to drain the liquid off the cucumbers.  The salt is what makes the cucumbers soft and salt-flavored.  Delicious!

I'm sorry, I followed the recipe exact. After I covered the salad with plastic wrap and let it sit, I came back and the bowl was filled with liquid. The salt had continued to pull liquid from the cucumbers and onions which made this thin slurry that made having dressing impossible.

Don't forget to drain the cucumbers!

I used cucumbers from our garden.  Follow the steps EXACTLY, especially the draining part.  I put mine in a salad spinner, which automatically caused a separation between the cucumbers and the brine.  I also waited the full 30 minutes indicated.  I also added a sprig of fresh tarragon that I chopped up and it added an amazing flavor.  I made it a bit last minute so I wasn't able to keep it in the refrigerator the full two hours, but it tasted great after cooling for 45 minutes. The incredible thing about this salad is how crispy the cucumber remained, even the left overs we ate the next day..  I've made it twice already; my husband loves it.

As a kid growing up, my mom used to make a recipe similar to this.  I knew the basic ingredients, but not the measurements.  I am so glad I found this recipe.  I didn't want to wait for the cucumbers to drain, so I squeezed out the juice.  This worked very good.

When I saw this recipe I hoped it would be good, thought it sounded good.  After making it, I can honestly say it was better than I had hoped.  It was easy to make and ended up with a flavor that was much better than I had anticipated.

Tastes just like my grandmas. Delicious, Cut mayo 1/2 and use about 1/4-1/2 cup sour cream.

Love it just as is, or you can just make it with mayo, vinegar, and a packet of the dry hidden valley ranch mix. Delicious!

This is such a creamy and delicious salad. I didn't have dill weed and it is still perfectly flavored. I will be picking up Dill for the next time but it is fantastic without it too.

Delicious! So refreshing with great flavor! I used fresh dill and used half mayo, half sour cream. Make sure you squeeze the liquid out of the cucumbers to avoid runny results. I will definitely make this again and again!

I didn't have a problem with it being too runny as some have noted, but i also let it sit  in the salt mix for an hour and I let it strain for an hour as well. The only thing I did different was add mayo and sour cream since I personally love sour cream and I feel made it less tangy.

I made this last night as a side to my barbecue.  I only put in 1 cup mayonnaise and that was way too much..  I also added a touch cayenne pepper, a.touch white wine, fresh dill, and fresh squeezed lemon juice. I will not make this again.

I thought the proportion of mayo sounded a bit high, so I used 2 gigantic English cucumbers; I still think I could have cut the mayo more. Nice balance of sweet and tart, and, yes, it IS creamy!

I made this to go with our evening meal and it was delicious. My husband doesn't normally like cucumbers done this way and he loved it!! Two things I did differently was I used English cucumbers because that's what I had on hand and after salting them and letting them sit in the fridge for 30 minutes, I rinsed them under cold water to remove some of the salt and drained them well.  I made the dressing exactly as written and it stayed thick and creamy after several hours in the fridge. I'll be making this again!

I remember this recipe from when I was a kid. I used 1/2 of the mayonnaise and used the other half lite sour cream. I think next time I will rinse the cucumbers after the salt bath, but it tastes the way I remember it the way it was.

Made this for a 4th of July party and I should have doubled it! There were no leftovers! I followed the directions but allowed my cucumbers to drain about 1.5 hours total. I hate runny dressing! It was amazing! My 4 year old daughter asked me to make it for her birthday so that's saying something! My mil doesn't typically like creamy cucumber salad but she had multiple helpings! I will be making this for every summer party we have!

I made this salad for myself so I halved it. It was great. I mixed the mayo and seasonings in a side bowl to mellow out together while the cucumbers and onions drained. I did use some sour cream with the mayo, I typically use 50/50 blend for salads like this. May add tomatoes in the future.

So easy and flavorful. Great summer dish if you are looking for something very light. The only difficult part of this recipe was waiting two hours for it to sit. The only change I made is that I used Splenda instead of sugar.  So if you have a few cucumbers and you don't know what to do before they go bad, give this a try, you won't be disappointed.

Too salty. If I make this again, I'd reduce the salt to one teaspoon. I did drain the cucumbers the recommended 30 minutes.

This was a hit with the whole family.  Cool and creamy on a hot day.  Simple to make.  But it is important to let the cucumbers and onions sit with the salt and then letting them set with the dressing.  But well worth the wait!!! The family keeps asking when are we having it again?

The salad was excellent. Next time I would not use the salt though  just for health reasons. I don't think it would get too watery without the salt.

Thank you mhudson!  Terrific recipe exactly as written. Only change I made was to use salad spinner as a reviewer suggested  (great idea) and added a few celery seeds because that’s what my Mom did.  Even my picky husband likes this!

Just made today. Excellent flavor. I used three huge cucumbers that I cut in half and seeded. I like cutting the slices a little thicker. I don't bother having it sit for a 1/2 hour in bowl, I just salted cukes and onions and let them sit in colander for an hour stirring every so often to drain liquid. I used it as salad dressing - the flavor is amazing. Definitely will make again. The mayo could probably be cut to a cup or maybe even 3/4 (but why would you?!?). Vinegar should be cut then too. I also used lots of fresh dill.

Made Dad's Creamy Cucumber Salad for the first time today and it came out great! (The key is to make sure you drain for 30-40 minutes). Will make this a lot during the spring/summer. Thank you Allrecipes.

I looked at a lot of recipes for this dish and went with this one. Oh boy! The mayo was way to much and I only used half of what was suggested. I was able to salvage it by adding another cucumber and an additional 1/4 cup sugar and vinegar. It increased the amount of servings but now that it is fixed I'm ok with that.

Yum!! Salting & draining the cukes is a must. After they've drained, I usually press down with a paper towel to get even more liquid out. This makes a LOT of dressing - you can use more cucumbers than are called for in the recipe with the same amount of mayo, etc. Love the pepper & the dill: I sometimes just make the dressing part to dip veggies in. Thanks for sharing!

Yum! This is really good. I chopped the onion small and used less to make it more appetizing for our kids but the flavor still came through nicely. My mother always made cucumber salad with onions and black olives in a vinaigrette but I really love this creamy version. I'll definitely make this again and will probably include the olives next time.

Light and delicious! I don't like raw onions so I was hesitant on making this. The brine helped soften the onions. I made the recipe as directed with no modifications. Will make this year round. It reminds me of a salad my grandma made all of the time.

Very tasty. The dill weed was the best ingredient! I only let this sit for about 1/2 an hour before serving, let the sliced cucumbers sit for 1// an hour at room temperature and then drained. I used a mandolin slicer for super thin slices, worked great! ( just don't slice your finger, nasty!)

I can not use mayonnaise thanks to food sensitivities so I had to sub greek yogurt mixed with a little bit of avocado oil to thin it out a little. I'm saying this only because I know there may be another person or two who may not be able to use mayo. Surprisingly enough, this still came out pretty good though I personally think I'd use a different vinegar next time.

I followed recipe as is and this is delicious. I have made this twice in less than a week so I consider it a household favorite. The second time I used larger cucumbers and a little less mayo. I think I will try to use sour cream with mayo the next tine I make this.

Love this. If you have properly drained the cukes and onions the salt content is just right. I squeeze out more moisture with paper towels. The dressing never goes runny like other salads. Making this about once a week because I can't get enough.

Wonderful! I'm a low carber, so cut sugar in half, was still wonderful. I keep thinking of all of the cukes I threw out after letting them compost in my fridge because I didn't get to them, and thinking, "I could have made THIS!" Wowza. I hope the people who didn't read the part about draining make this again. You don't know what you are missing!!!

I used a third of the mayo and substituted sour cream, but a lot less than the total cup and a half. I salted and paper towel drained the cucs, but will try the salad spinner next time. Substituted 3/4 of a shallot for onion (not so strong & adds a little color). Didn’t add sugar. Also added some “Deliciously Dill”. Everyone loved it!!

Way too much mayonnaise. I grew up with a more vinegary version. I'd suggest you cut it in half and add to taste. I also doubled the amount of vinegar.

A great hit.  First time I made it I cut the cucumbers thinner as pictured but although the flavor was great they were a bit limp.  Second time I cut them just a tad thicker and it was perfect!  Everyone loved it, a great change from your normal heavy pot luck foods..

The only thing different that I do is, I use 3 cucumbers, dice up some tomato, use a packet of stevia instead of sugar.  Oh, and I dice my onion very small.  Delicious.

I did not have any dill, nor sea salt, used kosher salt. We liked  pretty salty but will make again! Maybe cut salt a bit, Will make sure I have all ingredients next time.

Wow! This was exceptional and reminded me of my mother's cucumber salad. Thanks so much! It's a keeper. I used 6 oz of 2% greek yogurt, 1 tbsp of mayo, cider vinegar, ground pepper, garlic and fresh dill for one cucumber. The salting and draining really made a huge difference.

Easy to make and has good flavor but the recipe as written has way too much cream mixture IMO for the quantity of cucumber/onion in the recipe. I put it in a colander and let the sauce drain til there was the quantity I like - in the future I’ll use half the amount. (And yes, I did let the cuke/onion/salt drain for a half hour after letting it sit for a half hour.)  I’d recommend adding the creamy mix slowly, til it’s to your liking.

This is the best cucunber salad recipe i have ever had. The only changes i made is that i use a sugar substitute because i don't eat refined sugar and i use a little less as well and i usually add a little more dill weed but thats just a personal preference. It is so delicious that i usually make it every week!

So my variations were that I soaked my sliced cucumbers in saltwater for a day before draining.  I used a spiralizer to make my red onions extra thin because I don't trust my knife skills.  And I used waaaay more cucumbers so I doubled the ingredients.  It turned out amazing!  I didn't have any separation of the cream.  It all stayed together and tastes amazing.  Thanks!

Just like the cucumber salad my Grandmother made when I was a kid.  I rinsed off the salt before adding the mayonnaise mixture or it would have been too salty.  We added more cucumbers and onions to leftover sauce.

I made this and brought it to a dinner, it all went. I does taste like my grandmothers, I was leery on the garlic, but added it and I did add another teaspoon of sugar, used white onion that was what I had on hand, and rice vinegar. I did use the salad spinner which worked great. This will be my go to recipe for sure!

I made it exactly the way the recipe was written,except I did add more mayonnaise,then stated, because the dressing was a little more runny than I liked it. Other than that, it was delicious. My daughter said she could use the  dressing as a dip.

This is now my favorite cucumber salad!  I use Hellman’s light mayonnaise and it is still rich and creamy. I like saltiness, but you may want to wipe or rinse off some of the sea salt since it is still quite salty after the 30 minutes with the salt and the 30 minutes draining in the colander. The recipe seems to me to make way more dressing than needed for two large cucumbers, so I saved some in the refrigerator for another day. Or, you may want to use twice as many cucumbers with the original amounts. I can’t stop eating this!

THIS RECIPE IS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE MY GRANDMA'S CUCUMBER SALAD RECIPE.  THE ONLY CHANGE THAT I MADE WAS ADDING ONE SLICED HUNGARIAN YELLOW PEPPER  (I HAD IT IN THE GARDEN) WITH THE CUCUMBERS AND FRESH MINCED GARLIC WITH THE MAYO MIX.  IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO USE THE SALT TO GET THE MOISTURE  OUT OF THE CUCUMBERS.  I'VE  NEVER USED THAT METHOD WITH CUCUMBERS AND IT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

Because of my long hours, I sprinkled the salt (more than recipe) and placed cukes/onions in a plastic bag overnight.  Before leaving for work I did a quick rinse and put them in a colander  until I got back 12 hrs later.  Just mixed 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and #3 cloves of fresh garlic.  I also used Splenda vs sugar.    Forgot to add a touch of cayenne pepper or smoked paprika, but what I just tasted was phenomenal.  Thanks for sharing your Dad's recipe!

Followed almost exactly except didn’t have white vinegar.  Googled a substitute and decided on lemon juice.  I added a little more sugar to make it a bit sweeter since I’m not a huge onion fan but the rest of the house is.  It was pretty darn delicious!

I always get these creamy thinly sliced cucumbers and onions at salad bars, buffets, farmers' markets, etc.  I've wondered if they were made with yogurt, sour cream, or milk, but mayo didn't occur to me till last weekend at a farmers' market where I asked, the the woman at the counter told me Mayo!  
So, I'm hungry for a midnight (3:30 AM) snack, have all the ingredients, and attempted a quickie replica without measuring.  I peeled and sliced one cucumber, and I let the cuke slices salt for awhile and after I rinsed off the salt they had that soft texture and slightly salty taste.  I skipped the onion THIS TIME - not a good idea to be using my super sharp chef's knife at 3:30 AM.   I spooned what seemed like about 3/4 c of mayo from the jar but then  I slopped in way too much vinegar, so I quickly scooped out as much vinegary liquid as I could, and put in additional mayo and probably doubled the sugar.  My creation is pretty good, and I am confident that next time when/if I measure properly it'll be perfect!

This is an absolute KEEPER! We had it last night with grilled salmon, and if it had been polite I think each one of us would have licked the bowl. I used half and half mayo and Greek yogurt, and was able to adjust the flavor with a tad more yogurt, as I found it a bit sweet otherwise. I used a mandolin to slice both the cucumber and the onion, in order to get them both super thin. As others have said the draining of the cucumber is key. After several hours in the colander I squeezed even more excess water from the cucumber/onion mix, and refrigerated until about one hour before serving. I drained it again, and then added the creamy sauce.

I was skeptical that this was basically ranch dressing with dill on top of cucumbers. I was wrong. This is a great recipe but makes a lot of dressing that you can use for other stuff with some added salt or simply add more cucumbers! Thanks for sharing!

I tripled the cucumber, chopped 1.5 onions and 2.5 tbsp of salt then doubled the dressing and didn't use up all the dressing but most of it.  If I tripled the dressing it would have been to much for me.  Also, didn't have time so let the cucumbers, salt, and onions drain in a colander overnight.

Just made it but with half the mayo(1/2 cup). Also added a spoonful of sour cream due to the reviews. The one piece I tasted was great although I could have used another cucumber or two since there was a lot of sauce even after cutting it down by half. Thanks for the great recipe! Definitely will make again next week! I think I will use 3 tablespoons of vinegar since I like the taste. The great thing about cooking is you can adjust it to your own personal taste!

Yum. Easy. I used green onions instead because that’s all I had. It was just as good as when I made it with sweet onions. I also used stevia instead of sugar because I am diabetic.

Not good. I followed directions. Too salty. Too oniony. I added 1 medium onion and it overwhelms the dish. Don’t recommend this recipe.

Delicious!  I rinsed the salt off after the 30 minutes and then let drain another hour.  It was still rather salty so next time I’ll decrease the salt a bit more and still rinse them. 
I only used  1/4 tsp of garlic powder since hubby isn’t a fan, and next time I would add at least one more cucumber as there was plenty of dressing.

Great Recipe!!  It really brings back wonderful memories of my mom. She would also serve with chopped boiled egg.  Reading the reviews, I would remind people that this type of recipe should be adjusted according to your own tastes. I use the ingredients listed but amounts should vary based on what you like. I use sour cream and mayo for the base, and also use white and apple cider vinegar. Just keep tasting as you go until you find your preference.  Also, you need to salt and drain the cucumber and onion mixture A LOT before adding the dressing. I let mine drain in a colander covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 hours in the fridge, stirring a few times, then pat them dry with paper towels. This will keep it from getting soupy much longer.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

My friend told me about this recipe. We were overloaded with cucumbers so I tried it. I didn’t change anything. It is great and is even better the next day. Hide back a little if you want seconds for yourself.

I used three large cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and a bit of red pepper. I reduced the mayo to one cup and used a tablespoon plus two teaspoons of vinegar. One tablespoon of fresh dill,  a small amount of fresh chopped garlic (less than a clove) and a dash of salt. I didn’t want it to be overpowering. It’s marinating now but I was pleased with the taste of the dill sauce. Can’t wait to try it. Will update (if I remember)

This is a tasty way to use the fresh cucumbers and dill from the garden.  Fresh dill is the way to go with this recipe.  Next time, though, I will use half the salt.  This was waaaay too salty for our family!

UPDATE: Had left over carry out Gyro's Sandwich  but not enough sauce left on it. Took some juice from cucumbers & onions and added it to sandwich. It was perfect! 

I will definitely be making this again! Awesome recipe! Thank you for sharing! I didn't have enough mayo so I took another reviewer's suggestion and topped the mayo off with sour cream. The end result was delicious!

I made it vegan, used vegan mayo. Delicious! I also reduced the salt bath time by half. I like my cucumbers a bit crisp.

My mom is the master of cucumber salad. After years of trying to make it like hers I gave up. I decided to find my go to recipe. I am happy to report THIS IS IT! It is delicious and flavorful and a nice variation.

Great recipe, very tasty, similar to how my parents make it back in Minnesota.  The key to not getting it too liquify is to make sure you put the cucumbers in a colander for 30 minutes or to make sure all excess water is off of them.

Wasn't bad. I did cut down on the salt. I used a salad spinner to remove the liquid from the vegetables. I also added quartered tomatoes which added a nice flavor. Next time making it (and I will be making this again) I may not dry the vegetables so well ,or I may add some olive oil to the mayo as I found the dressing to be too thick.
Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I used to make this with sour cream instead, but I much like it better with the mayo!  I would make it 3/4 cup at most.

I added:
3 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons dillweed
Everything else was the same
Family favorite now when our cucumbers start ripening. I make a batch of dill sauce, I add as much is needed to each cucumber mix, and I store the extra sauce separate.

After reading the reviews,  I salted the cucumbers and let set about 20 minutes, then put them in my salad spinner. I highly recommend doing this!!! I made this for my husbands lunches, and because he is not a huge Mayo fan i use 1 cup mayo 1/2 cup scour cream. He sent me a text over lunch telling me how much he LOVED the salad!!!

I made a lot of changes based on the comments. I reduced the sea salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons and I only used 1/4 cup of real mayonnaise. I used fresh burp-less cucumbers from the garden and my fresh dill, about 2 tablespoons chopped. It turned out absolutely delicious! I would have given 5 stars if I didn't need to make the adjustments.

Loved the way this turned out, very flavorful and creamy! I did read the reviews and used 1 cup of mayo and it was plenty. I have been looking for a good creamy cucumber recipe and this by far is my favorite. I will be making this again no doubt!

This could well be Mom's Creamy Cucumber Salad, for to me it is. Mom made this one with love and I loved it! I added  things by feel with a little taste here and there. The warm happy memories flowed with each bite. Thanks for the memories.

I wanted to use up an English cucumber and found this recipe about 45 minutes prior to serving dinner.  Even just one-half hour marinating produced a very tasty salad, despite missing the dill weed.  I actually preferred the salad as my main dish that evening. My picky - excuse me, selective  -  husband asked that I keep this recipe.  The four stars  are only because I will have dill weed on hand the next time I make it.

I drained my cucumbers for longer than called for. I also used a cheese grater to slice them evenly( backfired and they came out chunky and paper thin) I also sliced some into thick pieces. All the different sizes and shapes worked better then having them uniform. I have also used the dressing I made for two batches and have enough for two more. Next time I will half the recipe.

Made this with Best Foods Vegan, cut the red onion very thinly and served about 20 minutes after prep, was delicious and a total hit. Easy, tasty, done!

It was very good but requires about half the amount of mayonnaise probably due to the wetness of the cucumbers.

I will make it again.  You must follow the instructions to the letter about draining the cukes.  I used my lettuce spinner to drain the cukes during the last 1/2 hour and it worked very well.   Next time I will cut back on the pepper. While this is no doubt  what gives it some taste aside from the salt,  1 Tsp of pepper is too strong for my own taste buds.

I made this and substituted most of the Mayo with low-fat plain Greek yogurt. It was delicious and everyone at my party raved. I had to send the recipe out because it was so popular.

This was a very good dish a little on the sweetie but that can be corrected next time i make it. The dill was just the right amount. Good texture with the thinly sliced onions and cucumbers.

Used 2 very Large Cucumbers, 1TBL of Apple Cider Vinegar and 1/2 tea. of Black Pepper. Turned out great!  Still had enough sauce that I could have added an extra cucumber.

Cucumber salad similar to this was fairly regular for me growing up. So I tried this recipe and wow! The onions and dill made it new and special.  My chow hound brother agreed! The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because hey...it's salad, not steak

Let me start by saying I don't even really like cucumbers and I thought this was great.  Followed recipe, aside from using apple cider vinegar and honey instead of sugar, and added mayo without measuring until I was happy with the consistency.   Everybody loved it.

This was very good and refreshing for a summer side. The salting and letting the cukes sit helps to keep them crisp. I thought this was very good. Thanks!

Love it!  I made a half recipe. cut the salt from 1-1/2 tsp. to just a 1/2 tsp.  For the sauce I reduced the mayo to 1/4 c. and added 1/4 c. sour cream.  This dish came out marvelous!  I couldn't stop eating it and that was before it was even chilled.  Will make again.  Maybe try lemon pepper instead of black pepper next time.

Very good!  I rinsed the cucumbers after draining but should have rinsed more - a bit too salty. I also used half mayo and half sour cream to be lighter. This recipe is a keeper.

Loved the flavors!  Have made numerous times.  For two people, we pared done to one cucumber and skipped the salting step since we eat it right away and it turns out fine.

I was looking for something to make with the bumper crop of cucumbers from my backyard and this recipe was one I could do without a trip to the store - all pantry ingredients. REALLY GOOD! My husband liked it - great alternative as a side dish during the summer hot days! I didn't change a thing.

I made this tonight and it was great.  I did soak the cukes in salt overnight and drained and squeezed them before adding the dressing.  I made a small batch, so I made the dressing in a separate bowl and added what I wanted. I added a bit more dill weed then called for and a few chopped tomatoes.  The salad is a bit runny, but that's the nature of cucumbers once cut.  I will definitely make this again.

Good recipe. Best one I've tried from this site. I like the flavor. However, with 3 medium sized cucumbers, there was still way too much mayonnaise. It would be good to know how many ounces or cups  2 large cucumbers yield.

Very tasty!  I drained the cucumbers and followed the recipe exactly.  When I put the sauce on the cucumbers it seemed like there was way too much, so I only used about half.  Even half way too much for the two cucumbers it calls for.  The dressing is delicious but could used for a much bigger batch or cut in half.  I will definitely be making again, but I won't be wasting half a jar of mayo in the process.

I have never had a cucumber salad.  I'm not a fan of onions but tried this recipe anyways.  This cold salad is the best.  Even better the next day.  I had reduced the onions before but next time I will use a large onion and use the full amour.

Have made this several times with English cucumbers & reduced the sea salt. Sour cream/plain yogurt can replace the mayonnaise. Either way is delicious!

This is a great recipe for a summer side dish. I have made cucumber salad before, but this is the best I have ever tasted. Husband loved it too! Thanks for posting.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I cut the recipe in half to just try it out and I will definitely be making the whole recipe again soon.  I am a little sensitive to raw onion so I cut the recommended amount in half.  It still seemed a bit much so I might cut it to a 1/3.  That's just personal preference so I'm not lowering the rating or anything for that.  All in all, very easy and very good.

I made the recipe as written & it was too salty. My mother used to make a salad similar to this one, ( I just loved it), & I was hoping this was the same, but I think she used sour cream not mayonnaise.   I'll keep searching!

This is really a great salad. I used sweet basil out of my planter instead of dill and put some pickles in it to "kick it up a notch." I also used more sugar than the receipt calls for to sweeten it up. I will definitely make it again!
