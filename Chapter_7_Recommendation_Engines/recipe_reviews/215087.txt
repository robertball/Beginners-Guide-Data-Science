I have been making these for years and they have always been the hit at our Christmas parties. I just use pork in mine and serve them with a sweet and sour sauce.

Made these tailgating on Sunday.  They were gone in a heartbeat.  I'll definitely make again.

Time consuming but not difficult.  I'm not sure if Italian Sausage is the way to guy and I think I might prefer my wontons boiled for soup instead of fried, but these make a lot of appetizers if that is what someone is looking for.

These were a bit labor intensive but certainly worth the end result. After trying them, I think next time I will cut back on the five spice just a tiny bit. The cinnamon flavor was overwhelming in the sense we are used to more savory wontons then sweet. I was also worried the beef mixture would be raw but it cooks up just fine and there is no excess grease. Overall, a real winner with my gang!

Do not follow these instructions, make sure you cook the meat first or you will end up with raw meat and burned wontons. Even with the oil turned down, still having the same problem.  Cook the meat first!  Other wise they taste great.
