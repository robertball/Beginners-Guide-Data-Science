This recipe is absolutely heavenly for pistachio nut fans. I took them to a Super Bowl party and they absolutely raved about them and scarfed them all up :) I did not change a thing and I sifted my dry ingredients 3 times as noted by the submitter. I used Ricks Buttercream from this site to gild these fabulous and tender cupcakes. I will be making these again on St Paddy's Day as suggested. Thanks so much for sharing Candice!

Just made these, and they are divine!  I chose a homemade buttercream frosting to pair with them.  If you know a pistachio lover, you must make these for them.  Toe-curlingly delicious!

It was amazing! Super soft and moist, not too sweet, just perfect. I made it for guests and it was eaten all in the same day :D
Thanks for the recipe

I found the recipe to be super egg-y and not in my favorite kinda way. My cupcakes also never rose properly, it looked like egg souffle before fallling during cooling. If I ever have left over chopped pistachios again, I probably would not give this another try. NOTE to folks reading this... I used full AP flour instead of 50/50 and I do not recommend doing that...it makes for a pretty tough cupcake.

The taste is great and the cake is moist, however, it never rose for me. Nothing the frosting can't take care of aesthetically though! I will try again once I get a chance to go buy more pistachios and update. Maybe adding 1/2 baking powder and 1/2 baking soda will do the trick.

I’m in no way a great cook. I’m a 36 year old father of 3 who until recently could barely make boxed Mac and cheese (thank god for my wife or the kids and I would never survive). But I must say I made these on my own and they were a hit. Had some company over who pulled together just over $100 to bribe the kids into telling them who really made them or where I bought them. Only change I made was instead of crushed pistachios on top I threw some into the blender and rolled the already iced cupcakes into the powder. (To be fair I only did that to hide my poor icing skills). But either way these were by-far the hit of the party.  Awesome and easy to follow recipe!!!

These cupcakes were great! My local grocery store used to sell the best pistachio cupcakes but for some reason they stopped making them. I was sad, but now I can make my own :-) The only thing I did differently was instead of using 2 tsp of vanilla extract, I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp pistachio extract for a little extra flavor. So yummy

These are very fluffy and have a wonderful flavor. The only thing I intend to change next time around is I'll be mixing the pistachio and sugar mixture in with the dry ingredients instead of folding them in at the end so as to better disperse the pistachios.

This recipe is amazing. I tweaked it a bit only using 3/4 cups of sugar. After creaming the butter and sugar I added the milk, essence, and 5 cups of green food coloring. I then added the pistachio pudding mix and then sifted the dry ingredients. Changed the flour to 1 1/4 cup and 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda.

Tasted delicious! I topped them with buttercream (added in pistachios to the buttercream) and they were amazing! I was a little concerned with the amount of egg but they turned out great!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and the result was excellent!  The pistachio flavor is rather subtle, but it beats the artificial flavor that comes from recipes using pistachio pudding added to vanilla cake.
The cupcakes rose beautifully and are moist and tender.  I will definitely make these cupcakes again.

The cupcakes were light and moist.  Very refreshing change of taste for dessert.  I added two drops of lemon extract to my buttercream frosting and they tasted great!

I love this recipe.  I did not change a thing.  I make a lot of cupcakes and this batter was the smoothest batter I have ever worked with for cupcakes.  The cupcakes were moist and very flavorful.   Pistachio is such a subtle flavor but these cupcakes were wonderful.  Okay, I just remembered, I changed one thing, I added a sprinkle of sea salt to the top of each cupcake and it brought out the flavor.  Thank you.

The only change I made only to my taste is halved the extract amount to equal vanilla and almond....I'm an almond extract fan.  But great recipe!!!

Saw same recipe on Watkins Pistachio Extract box.  Along with vanilla I added 2 tsp pistachio extract as stated on box.  Gave a more flavorable pistachio/almond flavor.  Made stabilized whipped cream for frosting. Again, used some pistachio extract.  Yummy...would make again

I followed the recipe exactly the way it appeared. I assumed the pistachios should be unsalted so those are what I used. Would be curious to see if anyone used salted, roasted pistachios. I made them for an event at our church, celebrating the 100th birthday of one of our members. Mine, with others, produced a display of over 100 cupcakes.  I was sought out as so many people loved them and  wanted to know who made them. They were in great demand and went quickly. They will be my new go-to treat for special occasions.

This is a really excellent recipe. Just the right amount of pistachio flavor and perfect cake consistency. I made them exactly as described including the triple sifting. I made a cream cheese frosting and sprinkled chopped pistachios on top. I'll definitely make this again!

These cupcakes were absolutely perfect! They were sweet (but not too sweet), rich, moist and very flavourful. In place of the eggs, I used EnerG Egg replacer and a tbsp of sour cream (as I usually do for egg replacement in cakes). Will definitely make this again!
