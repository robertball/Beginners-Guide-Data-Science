Great taste, I added the zest of lemon to it cut into very tiny pieces just for additional flavor and a crushed vit C tablet for longer shelf life / to avoid fungi formation.

I wanted to compare this recipe to mine,& I found  out that apple butter is actually better with vanilla extract. This recipe is very flavorful  and was just missing my touch. As I always say,"A little vanilla extract never hurt anything''!
