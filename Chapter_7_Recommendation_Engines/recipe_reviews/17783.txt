I have made many recipes from this site and have been generally very pleased, but find myself not rating the recipe, for one reason or another.  However, I found myself compelled to rate this one!  I made no changes other than to add some smoked sausage links.  My husband and I were amazed at how wonderful this was!!! And, in the middle of August in California.  You'd expect this to be a winter soup, but it was wonderful at lunch time, (along with a smoked sausage sandwich).  I made enough to freeze but did not add the peas or sour cream at freezing (will do so when reheating, think that is part of the secret). Anyway, couldn't be more impressed for such a simple recipe. We had an extremely fresh head of cabbage, think that is partially what made it so good.  Make sure you make this one!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Yummy! The house smelled so good while it was cooking we could hardly wait the 20 minutes it took to simmer. We added a cup of chopped, cooked chicken and along with garlic bread it made a quick, hearty and delicious meal.

This was a good soup that was easy to make.  My family loved it.  Next time I am going to use a little bacon grease instead of the olive oil to really give it some flavor.

Very Good Flavor! I thought this had wonderful flavor.  I omitted the flour because I avoid it and so the soup was a little bit more brothy.  Economical too!

I was looking for a way to make something of the random leftover ingredients I had around, and this definitely turned out to be a great choice. I made a couple changes: I used vegetable broth, omitted the peas, made my bacon bits fresh then used the bacon grease in place of the olive oil, and substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream. Otherwise I followed the recipe and my boyfriend and I both loved it. Not only did it taste great, but it was a fantastic hangover cure as well! Will definitely make again.

Excellent taste. Very full flavoured on the pallet. I will make a large batch next time to share as I ate 2/3rds of it the first nite. Highly recommended...

I made this recipe as stated except for the peas (didn't have and kids don't like).  For a cabbage recipe it was a nice change to add sour cream.  I love cabbage and am always looking for ways to enhance its flavor.  I did add some crushed red pepper flakes and some sliced kiebasa that I had left over from the night before.  Added a nice flavor.

This was very yummy! I made a few changes: used 3 oz. bacon bits, low sodium broth and doubled the cabbage. I will omit the peas next time, their flavor stood out too much.

This was quick, easy and good!  With no time to shop, I made several substitutions.  I used fat free plain yogurt since I didn't have sour cream on hand and some mixed frozen vegetables instead of fresh carrots and frozen peas.  I dissolved 6 chicken bouillon cubes in 5 cups of hot water instead of canned broth and doubled the cabbage and onion.  I was surprised by the great flavor for such a quick soup.  My kids seemed to enjoy it too!  I'll make this again.

This recipe made one delicious pot of soup!  I made a few minor modifications; I used 2 pieces of cooked turkey bacon, cut into strips, instead of the bacon bits, I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic after the onion was cooked, and added a few shakes of Italian mixed herbs toward the end.  To avoid the problem others had with the sour cream separating, I first removed the soup from the heat, then added the peas (unthawed).  The heat from the soup is sufficient to cook the peas at this point, then in turn the soup is cooled down enough to safely add the sour cream, while still being nice and hot for eating.  Thanks so much for the great recipe, and I look forward to making it again soon!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I followed the recipe as written except I added a smoked turkey wing instead of bacon. This is a very good flavorful soup. Thanks for sharing

I give this recipe 4 stars as is but it has 5 star potential. I used homemade chicken stock instead of canned broth and 3 strips real bacon instead of bacon bits. I then sauteed the vegetables in a bit of bacon fat to really sear in that flavor. 

This is by far one of the bests batches of soup I have ever made!

This soup was very, very tastey. I added a lot of rice (I had some cooked leftover in the fridge that needed to be used). And instead of peas, a can of mixed veggies. I also added extra water to make up for the rice. Soooo yummy! Will for surely make again! Thank you Anne!

This was really good.  I subbed chopped smoked sausage for the bacon and added a bit more than was called for (about 1/2 cup).  I also added only 1/2 teaspoon of salt rather than 1 teaspoon as called for.  I will definitely make this again with these same changes.  I also think I will try adding some diced potatoes in next time too.  My husband even raved about it and he doesn't usually like cooked cabbage.  Thanks!

This was okay. I used about six strips of turkey bacon, one ginormous onion, organic broth, organic shredded carrots, omitted the salt, peas and sour cream. Instead of sour cream, I used 1/4 cup of fat free half-n-half. This needs more spice, I just can't pinpoint what it is.

I was hoping that this would be a much heartier soup.  I added extra cabbage but there was much more liquid than I thought.  This would be fine for a first course but it is not the kind of soup that will fill you up so I recommend serving it with sandwiches or an entree. I'm not sure that we will eat the leftovers.  Just not that memorable.

I had left over cabbage from another recipe. My husband and I were nervous to try the recipe but this was delicious. Add homemade wheat bread for those of us who like to dunk into our soup and this was great.

This was really good actually. I left out the peas just because it sounded kinda outta place. Also, I added a link of smoked sausage and used real bacon instead of bacon bits. Really enjoyed this recipe. I think it would be better on a cold winter night:)

Excellent taste. Followed recipe except I accidently opened one can of beef broth instead of chicken. After trying soup, which was delicious as is, I added ramen noodles (no broth packet). Very good. Next bowl (next meal) I added soy sauce to make it more oriental. Water chestnuts is another option to add crunch. Very good. This is a excellent recipe as is or an excellent recipe to add other ingredients of your choice.

MMmm, good stuff!  I added more pepper and some red chili flakes to give it more kick and swapped the peas for corn (just personal preference).  I used dried bacon (the bagged stuff from Costco) but may try with real bacon next time so the flavor stands out more.

Wow, I thought I would have to spice this up more, but it was already good (I did add a little more pepper and some kielbasa sausage along with the bacon bits) and my husband who doesn't like soup said it was pretty good!  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was ok.  I'd make it again if I had leftover cabbage but I would not plan this as a meal otherwise.  I used an Organic chicken broth and it was very bland so I had to add a ton of salt and pepper, this could be one reason I wasn't thrilled with it. Also the cabbage came out a bit too crunchy for my taste.  I think I'll cook it longer next time.

This soup was ok, it is  a nice base for modifications. It is easy and quick. My only complaint is that the sour cream "broke" and floated to the top in little drops even though I added it off the heat. Next time I am going to use heavy cream instead. Also I will use cubed ham for the bacon.

This was a very flavorful soup.  I had no idea from looking at the ingredients.  I made it with vegetable broth and will serve it for company.

I may have tweaked this recipe a little bit I accidentally adding cooked chicken, and I added my own bacon bits from 4 strips of thick cut bacon and instead of sour cream I use heavy cream because that's what I had in the fridge oh, and I have to say this is one of the best soups I've ever had.

I liked this soup very much. You must eat it carefully so you don't splatter your clothes with the cabbage strings. I used a whole package of cabbage for slaw. I added 2 chopped chicken thighs and omitted the salt - it didn't need it. Oh, I used 2 slices of bacon cut into small strips instead of bacon bits and olive oil.

This is now my husband’s favorite soup. Rather than bacon bits, I used a whole pound of apple smoked bacon that I baked in the oven on a cookie sheet on parchment paper which eliminates clean up. I poured off about a tablespoon of the bacon grease into the pan to cook the onion to which I added the cut up bacon. I also omitted the peas because my husband doesn’t like them. I used a whole bag of shredded cabbage that came with shredded carrots. Next time I would like to add more carrots. Very flavorful!

This could easily become my favourite new soup. I had a hambone that I was boiling for a different soup and changed my mind when I saw this recipe. I know this one doesn't call for a ham bone but I decided to try it anyway. I used the broth I had and added some more chicken broth to make up the amount called for. I used the shredded bagged cabbage to make it even simpler. I followed the recipe as instructed and enjoyed it very much. It's a bit different than other soups and I loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have any carrots or peas so it was basically cabbage, onion and bacon. I added caraway seed because I thought it needed something.  Next time I may try adding some sauerkraut and maybe some Emerill's Essence. I liked it as a base for experimentation!!

The amount of time stated for cooking this, the cabbage just disintegrates. I added the other veggies later and they were fine, but I really wanted edible cabbage.

I just made this soup with a few things added. I added carrots, celery, bell pepper, and a little bit of garlic minced. I did not measure the cabbage but instead just chopped up a small head of cabbage and mixed chicken broth and chicken stock. It turned out great! We all love it and the broth is wonderful! I did added maybe a tablespoon more of bacon bits for flavor and than let cook until everything was cooked through. It takes a bit more time but it's worth it. We have not tried it with the sour cream but are looking forward to it, oh and I did not add peas :) never have liked them.

I was looking for a soup to use up left over veggies in my fridge. This turned out great. I used real bacon and added sausage thanks to another members review.

I made this with a couple of additions. I threw in some chopped ham and mushrooms and it was awesome. My husband had some and couldn't believe he liked something that had cabbage in it. Definitely a keeper. Worth trying..thank you for a great recipe.

This was so good, I was a bit nervous adding the sour cream, but it was well worth it!!  Yum Yum.  
I too used real bacon, not bacon bits.
Will make again!
