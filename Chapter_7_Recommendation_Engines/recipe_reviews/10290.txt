This recipe was pretty good but a little too much flour tasting. But still very tasty.

I made this recipe with my 7 year old Christmas 05 and she had a blast. We were even able to add food coloring to the dough. This was a fun simple and quick recipe (great for kids) but I felt the flavor could have been better with a more complex recipe.

I refrigerate for 45min or so and roll this recipe out for cut out cookies and ice with buttercream icing. The floury taste is masked and these cookies bake nicely cut-out. Layer between wax paper lightly floured to roll out then cut. My college boys love these.

Delicious!  Everyone at work loves it.  I've given out MANY copies of the recipe.  I don't understand the ratings that say it is flour tasting.  Maybe they aren't using real butter.

I can see how people would LOVE this but I am giving it four stars because I found it to be too floury I prefer a VERY sweet semi-moist cookie. As for the recipe itself it was easy to follow and the cook time was almost spot on.
