Awesome!!! This is definitely the recipe to try for rapini-beginners (it was my first attempt to cook with it) - you will be won over!

Now I did tweak the recipe a bit by adding a large, diced onion into the mix with the garlic and let it caramelize a bit... the sugary, sticky onion bits are a fantastic complement to the slightly bitter rapini. I also added a healthy splash of cream towards the end (my rapini was starting to look a little dry) which made a nice 'sauce' that covered the pasta and brought the everything together. 

I know this is a vegetarian dish but next time I will also crumble some bacon bits on top...drooling already.... Thanks for sharing, niki!!!

Really simple, really yummy!  Great way to use rapini.  Sounded too simple....but it was excellent.  My husband & daughter loved it too!

Very delicious. My boyfriend usually remarks to these kinds of dishes saying, "I don't like green stuff in my pasta" but this time he said, "I like this!" aka phenomenal. The flavors complimented each other really well and it made great left overs.

I was in a rush, so didn't chop the nuts.  Would strongly suggest to do this cause the bites with nuts were 10x better than without.  Rapini needed some help to cut the bitterness and this did it.  Used extra parm cheese as well.

Absolutely love this!  I had some rapini in my CSA box that needed using and this was perfect.  I used whole wheat pasta and subbed cashews for the walnuts (what I had on hand.)  I also added some onion because I needed to use that as well.  I probably added more cheese than what was called for, but I feel you can never have too much cheese!  An easy, quick meal that's easy to customize will always be a keeper in my book.

Very simple, but I never would have thought to mix nuts and rapini... Turned out great! I think this would make a great base recipe for a pasta salad as well.

I just made this yesterday. The only thing I added was light cream to make it more moist. It came out very good. Will make again.

Make sure the rapini is fresh or the bitterness is intense.  White beans ,drained, cuts some of the bitter.  It is an aquired taste.

Okay, I may have gone a little substitution-crazy, but the gist of the recipe was still there. Kind of. I was just using what I had on hand, so swapped rapini for gai lan, garlic for onion, and Daiya 'mozzarella' for the parmesan. I wasn't a huge fan of the walnuts (when I tried them before cooking, they weren't sweet enough for my taste), but they complemented the rest of the dish quite well. Next time I'd probably add more of the green veggies, since they were a little bit sparse here. All in all, quite delicious!
