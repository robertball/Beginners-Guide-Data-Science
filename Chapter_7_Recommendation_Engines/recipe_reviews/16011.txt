I'm confused...there's Ã¯sn't any "chicken" in this chicken soup...

Bland. It might be quick, but the extra time it might take to add more ingredients and flavor would well be worth it.  Soup out of a can tastes better.

Recipe was a bit bland.  I added 1/2 cup of chopped chicken (leftovers) seasoned with a dash or two of seasoned salt and it definately was a good, quick and easy soup.

No flavor at all. This was a waste of good broth.
