The jelly in the jars looks absolutely amazing. I made my apple juice from fresh apples and the resulting jelly is fantastic. So I can absolutely brag on this one. I made no alterations on this recipe. I did however use my remaining apple pulp to make All Day Apple Butter submitted by Terri. I yielded 8 half pint jars and also 11 half pints of Apple Butter for only 5 1/2 lbs. of apples.

This jelly was a big hit at the craft bazaar I participated in.  It really is a pretty color.  I made a cloth circle out of a Christmas print and tied it onto the top of the jar with a green ribbon, and tied a candy cane to the side.
The taste is really good, but it did take a couple of days for the jelly to set up.  Not sure what I did wrong there.  It has a nice but mild cinnamon cany taste, which was stronger, I thought, when I first made it, and seemed milder a couple of weeks later when I tried it again.  
I plan on making some more on my days off, as I gave some for gifts, and people want more!  I would have to say it was a hit.  But I am going to try adding a little more red hots this time, as I would like a more intense cinnamon flavor.
Another suggestion, if you can't find Red Hot candies, which I did at Walmart, maybe you could use the round red cinnamon flavored candies.  Should work.

I got 7 8oz jars out of this. It is a beautiful rosy red color. It tastes like baked apples, which I love. Nice recipe. Very easy. These will be included in the gift baskets I'm making. Thank you for the post.

This was really tasty. I put the candy through the food processor until it was a powdery consistency. I'm not even a fan of apples and cinnamon but this jelly tasted really good. Was able to make 7 jelly jars.

Very quick, easy and BEAUTIFUL jelly recipe.  The color is very Christmas.  The jelly is very sweet but tastes great on hearty wheat toast.  Hubby likes it spread in Triscuits!

What a great jelly recipe! So easy and great flavor. It did take about a full day to set up. I followed the recipe and would not change a thing. Found the red hots at walmart. I got 6 of the 8 oz jelly jars.

Great recipe!  Set wonderfully!  Perfect amount of red hots! The only thing I changed was that I used apple cider.  Jelly still had that beautiful "see through" color because I skimmed the top layer.  Definitely going in to my christmas baskets this year!  Thank You!

I mistakenly added the whole bag of red hots to the recipe, but happy accident. It was delicious and we also made a pork sauce glaze out of the jelly that was very good.

So easy and SO tasty.  I am happy to find this recipe after tasting the jelly a friend shared with me.  My batch yielded 6 8oz jars - no more, no less.  This jelly is enjoyed with softened/room temp cream cheese and a plain water cracker.  Also, we use this as the "J" in PB&J sandwiches.  A different flavor for a jelly, and a nice change once in a while.

This was a good starter, but WAY too sweet.  I used the no sugar pectin, and took off a cup of the sugar, and it was way better.  I see making Christmas gifts in my future.

Amazing recipe! It has a wonderfully subtle apple cinnamon flavor and it very easy to make.  I used Simply Apple juice (in the fridge section of the store) for a more intense apple flavor.  My jelly set up perfectly and I had no problems with jelling or anything.  I got exactly six half-pints out of this recipe. It also made my house smell like Christmas!

So pretty and so good!  I forgot to by pectin and made the jelly anyway without it.  No problem!  I put a little on a saucer and put the saucer in the freezer for just a minute to see if it was set. (I got this information by googling how to make jelly without pectin.)   Perfect!

Made yesterday and they are already setting up nicely.  Got 4 12 oz jars with about 4 oz leftover for tasting.  Couldn't find Red Hots in the candy isle so used the cinnamon candies found with the cake decorating stuff.  I brought it to the boil on medium (not high) to give the candies time to melt completely. The jars look beautiful and the jelly is very sweet with a distinct red hot candy flavor.

This was my first time making jelly and I'm glad I chose this recipe. I read online that the No sugar needed pectin is the best for jelly making so I cut the sugar down to 3 cups and upped the apple juice to 5c. The reason for that is the recipe for apple jelly on the insert for the pectin called for 6c of juice and 4c sugar. I personally don't like really sweet jelly so the end result was perfect! I ran to 3 different stores looking for Red Hots and found them at a gas station. They came in $.25 small boxes. I bought 8 but only needed 5 for a generous 1/2 cup. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this more often.

Fantastic candy apple taste! Very easy, I got 6 jelly jars. I did not change a thing in recipe. It is very sweet, but its a candy apple in a jar. Wonderful red color as well.
This was my first time making jelly. I gave four stars because in the directions it does not say remove air bubbles (I think that is why one of my jars didnt seal, and it may get funky later b/c of the air).Totaly my fault, BUT I was following the recipe and didnt reference my ball blue book before hand.

I think I may have done this wrong.  it tasted fine and smelled fine on its own but on bread it may need something else.  Maybe onto of butter or peanut butter.

this turned out really great! I used all natural, no sugar added apple juice. The unfiltered juice gave a really good apple flavor that I think would be missing if you used just regular apple juice. Spending the money for good juice really makes a difference!

Very, very good! I was a fool and made a double batch. Big no-no. It didn't set up after a week so I found some instructions online to re set it by adding more pectin,water and sugar. It turned out great. This was my first attempt at canning, certainly not my last. I am hooked. Awesome recipe.

Just made a batch for Christmas gifts. Delicious and beautiful! The only pectin I had in the house was Sure Gel no sugar needed.  I used it and only used 3 cups of sugar. Will be making a few more batches tomorrow after I pick up more Sure Gel

I haven't made jelly since I was a child and I was worried about figuring out if the jelly was set or not.  I used the freezer test, and it turned out just fine.  I was really pleased with the presentation, and mine looks exactly like those pictured--brilliant, jewel-toned red.  I'm very pleased and I think this will be one of those centerpiece items in next year's Christmas gift baskets!

Thanks for sharing this Betsy!  I made about 4 batches for Christmas gifts and am very pleased with the color and taste.  I could have used a bit more pectin, but I will know that next time.

Super easy and a very pretty jelly.  I added jalapenos and habaneros to mine.  Great with cream cheese and crackers.  I am making up several batches for Christmas gifts.

If jelly can be beautiful, then this is. It taste wonderful. I always get lots of compliments on it. People always ask if I have more. It's great on everything from from toast to pork-chops. The only negative I can say is that it is always just a little on the loose side.

This was easy to make, color was a beautiful ruby red.  My neice got married and had a small family wedding.  Her future husband is an apple orchard owner.  We made 8 oz. jam jars as favors for each guest.  We got tons of compliments from guests.

Wow very easy!  Smelled so good when it was cooking.  I made a batch and tasted it and ended up making 4 batches the same day to give as presents..  The kids really like this jelly!  It looks like Christmas

love the flavor of this jelly even though I've never been a big fan of red hots. I added a teaspoon of vanilla at the end of cooking (I always do with jams and jellies). This is as close to perfect as it gets!

Made this according to the recipe except added 2 more tbs of pectin.  This is terrific, I'm not a fan of redhots and was afraid it would be too much and that they wouldn't melt fast enough.  I was wrong on both counts  the taste is like that of cinnamon baked apples and it set beautifully!

So yummy, even my picky eaters love it. I did boil it a lil longer after adding sugar and then I processed the jars for 10 minutes because of our elevation:-) I will be making this again!

Recipe turned out mostly great.  I would have preferred the jelly was a bit thicker set, but this could have been due to my not cooking it down long enough.  Gave these as gifts in decorated jelly jars and they were a hit.

This recipe was OK. It looks pretty, and smells delicious but I didn't care for the flavor. It was too sweet and too candy-like I guess. Maybe I'll try it again and use less sugar.

This jelly was absolutely beautiful! And it tasted great too but it was a little sweet...next time I will try decreasing the sugar some. I used a 3 oz. pkg of liquid pectin instead of the 1.75 oz dry. The jelly hadn't totally set up by the morning after making it but I'm sure it will ... I will update if it doesn't. Great recipe Betsy Porter...thanks!

Wonderful and easy.  I have made two batches so far... will start on my third when I get more jars.  I love the color and the flavor.  My hubby isn't much of a jelly eater, but he loved them as well.  Thank you for the recipe.

I just made two batches of this.  The color is very pretty and the small amount that I tasted was great as well!  These will be going in my Christmas baskets this year.  I got six 8 oz jelly jar from each batch for a total of 12 jars.  This is probably because I only used about 4 cups of sugar in each batch instead of 4 1/2.

Thanks for a really easy recipe and a fabulous tasting jelly!  I just loved the color that the red hots added...so pretty!

I made this recipe today with my 10 year old and 5 year old Daughters for teacher's gifts. It was so easy and fun to make. Great taste and pretty color.  
We made 2 batches and it made twelve 8 oz. jars.

This doesn't taste anything like candy apples to me - but it's actually quite delicious!  It is definately unique and has more of a cinnamon flavor.  Perfect for breakfast parties or holiday gift-giving!

This is absolutely beautiful jelly...almost too pretty to eat!  It was a hit with my family.  When I make new jellies we enjoy trying them out on saltine crackers.  Yummy!  I will definately be making this again.

This recipe was a hit! I couldn't find red-hots and I'm not even exactly sure what they are but I did try to find cinnamon hearts (cinammon flavoured hard candy).  Unfortunately they only sell them aound valentines day and I couldn't wait.  Instead I used cinnamon flavoured jelly beans. The only difference was the undissolved candy sunk to thebottom instead of floating making it harder to remove.  It turned out great and has great flavour. the whole recipe was quick and easy to make.

So beautiful and absolutely the easiest jelly I have made!  Everyone that tasted it liked it - but couldn't see their way to eat any more than a small taste.  Very strong 'red hot' flavor.

VERY GOOD on cream cheese, using teddy grahams to dip! I did add an extra handful of redhots and a dash of lemon juice. also, adding a T of butter once it starts boiling will keep it from boiling over!

Bright and cheerful!  My 10 year old son loves this jelly and asks for it each time we make toast.  It has a very strong cinnamon flavor, so you might want to cut back a little bit on the Red Hot's to tone it down but otherwise this recipe is spectacular!

I really enjoyed this jelly, everyone who tried it enjoyed it as well.  It definately has a red hot taste to it, but a little muted.

I make this every year for gifts for neighbors and everyone really loves the flavors of this jelly! I love how simple it is to put together and the unique flavor that the cinnamon candies give. It also looks so beautiful and festive in the jelly jars. Thanks for posting. :)

Really good, it set fine, made it just as it says, only added 10 minutes to my processing time because I'm at altitude.

I made this jelly because it sounded easy and very festive. I sold it at a friends boutique next to jars of green jalapeno pepper jelly and put out samples on top of cream cheese with wheat thins. They loved it. I love that it's so easy, the color is a clear bright red and it tastes great on toasted sourdough with butter! Yum!

I used red hot candies. I thought they all were dissolved but in the bottoms of some jars there are little clear candies. Ooops! Watch for this. It hasn't set yet, I'm hoping that will happen soon. I finely chopped some apple pieces and put them in each jar for texture. I likely wouldn't do this again. The plain clear texture seems more desirable.

Very good.
I even made it without pectin and just cooked it longer, to thicken it, as a syrup for pancakes, waffles and ice cream

Just came from store with ingredients to make our 4th batch of this fantastic jelly. Have given it for gifts, my GK's ask for it when they've run out at home and today I'm showing a neighbor how super simple it is to make, at her request after they finished a jar in a little over a week!  Delicious on hot biscuits, toast or even crackers and cream cheese.  The color is gorgeous and the taste is beyond delicious.

beautiful color, beautiful flavor; made it twice and it wouldn't set either time.  Not sure what the issue was, but wasn't investing in a third time.  Sure wish it had worked, it's a brilliant idea.
