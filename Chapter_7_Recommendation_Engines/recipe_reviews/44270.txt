Terrific recipe.  I used pre-cut matchstick carrots and cooked with apple juice and seasonings in the microwave for 3 minutes.  Toasted pine nuts (didn't have hazelnuts) in a dry skillet while the carrots cooked.  Added light butter, the carrots with juices, and honey (only 4 tsp based on reviewers' comments).  Warmed together in the skillet for about a minute--9-10 minutes total time from start to finish.  We loved this.  Think it will go on the Easter menu.

This is an outstanding recipe for a "special" twist to carrots that everyone seemed to love.  Even picky eaters seemed to love these carrots because of the different texture (shredded) as well as different taste!  The hazelnuts added a nice crunch to the sweet, fresh, flavorful carrot taste. This recipe could be served with almost anything.  My only complaint is I should have made more!

This was great. I'll definiatly take this to dinner parties. A little on the sweet side, but I also used fresh from the garden carrots so I would probably cut back the sweetener next time...

Oh my! My boyfriend just ate these carrots at dinner and said, "Wow!" Best carrots ever. The hazelnuts give such a great texture. I chopped my carrots in thick circles, and they turned out GREAT.

Tanya! I have been looking like crazy for this recipe all night.  This is my favorite Easter recipe and I was so sad to have lost it! These are terrific.  I could eat these for dinner and nothing else and be very happy.  Fantastic recipe!  Don't you love the Jacksonville Inn? You are my hero!

This dish was really good. I read through the other reviews so cut back on the sugar and used molasses instead of brown sugar. I didn't have a problem with it being too sweet at all. Not so sure I'd use the garlic next time; there were enough flavors going on without it. It was an excellent accompaniment to the ham. Really easy to make, it presented really well with the different colors and a favorite on the table.

Delicious blend of carrots and sweetness. Unfortunately, I didn't have any hazlenuts, but they still tasted great, especially paired with lamb!

For this recipe I substituted apple juice for the concentrate, almonds for the hazelnuts, and fresh cilantro for the parsley since it was wat I had on hand.  It was very good.  My 2 year old ate it also, with no complaints, yay!

I'm deleting this one from my recipe box. I like carrots just steamed with butter, but I wanted to try something different for the holiday. I did not like it at all. The paprika or something made it spicy and the flavor combination was just weird. Out of 6 people, no one had seconds, so that tells me it's not just me.

This is a really wonderful recipe that is a sure to please the crowd.  I'm not generally a fan of cooked carrots, but I love every bite of these (as do my very picky children).  The first time I made these I tried to steam and grate the carrots as directed.  Ack!  That's A LOT of work, and ended with disastrous results.  My husband I ended up painstakingly cutting the cooked carrots into small pieces so they looked like they were grated.  Lesson learned.  Now I grate uncooked carrots with the food processor (less expensive than purchasing grated carrots) and follow the remainder of the recipe.  The grating snafu almost made me drop a star in the rating, but the flavorful punch these carrots have definitely deserve the full five stars.  Thank you!

5 stars for originality, 5 stars for addictive factor, and 5 stars for flavor.   Jacksonville carrots are for those that want to impress. I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception that I used normal apple juice instead of concentrate - won't do that again. Use the concentrate, I can imagine it gives it a sweeter apple flavor.   You can really make this ahead of time, just wait to "saute" the carrots when you have 5 minutes left of all your other dishes to be done.   A must try!

This was a delicious recipe.  I didn't have honey and wanted to make it so i substituted maple syrup.  It was still delicious. What an interesting and delicious way to serve carrots.

Excellent recipe!   I could eat these every night.  Prepared them just like THYMEFORME's review with the precut carrots and used pine nuts instead of hazelnuts.   Very quick to make and so delicious!

Great recipe ! The flavours were really really good. Thank you :-)  I only wish I had made more so there was some leftover.  This would make a great snack to have on hand.

I really liked them, but my husbadn thought they were too sweet.  He loved the hazelnuts, though  wants me to start adding toasted hazelnuts in when I cook dill butter carrots  green beans.  Definitely give it a shot if you're looking for a sweeter side dish.

I could appreciate why a lot of people liked this but it just didn't work for me. It was far too sweet and tasted more like a dessert than a veg side dish. The addition of nuts was odd and didn't add much to the dish.

I've been dying to try this myself and I was having "experimental Wednesday" last night which ended up with 12 people instead 5 so I may have goofed up the measurements because everyone complained about the nutmeg so I have to try this again - next time going much lighter on the nutmeg.  IT smelled good and everyone thought it looked fabulous and they all thought it so much trouble but it was EASY!  So I will try again then re-review

I can't wait to take these to Easter Dinner.  They taste great and the color is so vivid and rich looking with the glaze.  This will be a unique substitute to yams.  Amazing!

I'm not normally a carrot fan but a friend was serving these so I decided to be polite and give them a try. So good that I can't wait to make some of my own! This is a very fancy and delicious way to make carrots.

Excellent! Great dish to prepare when company's coming! Very tasty! Used approximately 4 tablespoons of butter, and it was plenty.
Cut the carrots into bite-size coins before steaming and it made it a lot easier. Super yummy with hazelnuts and pecans- I've tried it both ways. Yummy!

I have had a hard time finding good carrot recipes, this one was amazing. Some of my family members love any vegetable recipe and they were thrilled with this one. Some of my family members avoid vegetables and they were thrilled with this one too, that is rare. Thanks for sharing.

We did this for an early Thanksgiving and it seemed to go over well.  I doubled the recipe for 11 people and was lucky to get a few strands.  It will now be a recurring player at Thanksgiving!

yummy! I used dried parsley because it is what i had and agave instead of honey. The only issue i had was shredding the carrots after they were cooked. I think perhaps i cooked them a tad too long because it was just too hard to hold onto them over the grater. I ended up partially shredded and chopped. The flavor was perfect. thanks for a great recipe!

My husband always laughs at me when I say "Carrots are EVIL!" and finds ways to sneak them into whatever we have for dinner. I meticulously remove them! However, after trying this recipe, I LOVE it!  This is the ONLY way I will (knowingly) eat carrots!

Very good. Stongly flavoured. I left out the garlic as others suggested, and instead of shredding, I cut the steamed carrots by hand into matchstick like pieces. This was faster and easier on our hands.

I just wasn't crazy about this one despite all the other rave reviews. Maybe it just was a little more work than I cared for.   I still prefer carrots with a simple glaze of brown sugar and butter.  I will say that my family really seemed to like it.

I keep them whole, quartered or half, precook them to “al denté” pile them in a crockpot do the sauce as directed holding back nuts & 1/2 the parsley, it can be prepped to this stage the day before. Set crockpot on low or high 2to 3 hours before serving add remaining parsley and nuts before serving. “Mom you’re the only person I know that can make carrots even better then carrots already are” my 25 years old son.... every family diner I get requested to bring these carrots, I have 2 family Christmas diner to attend this year and both side of the families have asked me to bring the carrots....

I didn't have any apple juice concentrate so I substituted apple sauce. I'll try it with the concentrate next time. But these were really very delicious!

I doubled this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was very well received with 
lots of compliments. I followed the recipe exactly except that i steamed the carrots over apple juice, adding some of that juice last as opposed to apple concentrate. I also cut the carrots into discs instead of grating them. Super yummy. My husband says its a keeper. :)

These were fantastic. I will definitely be making again, probably decreasing the amount of honey next time. I cut a few corners with these edits: carrots - chopped up handfuls of baby peeled carrots, apple juice concentrate - used apple juice instead, parsley - used dried parsley, butter - did not clarify.

I'm not a big carrot fan, but the hubby is. I didn't have most of the ingredients, but I did what I could with apple juice and the seasonings I did have. They were pretty yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

Not your standard, boring carrot recipe.  It's easier to mash the carrots instead of grate.  Made some adjustments:  used a bit of cinamon apple sauce, orange juice, grated ginger, minced the hazelnuts (bc it was easier to put in magic bullet), and NO SALT :)

Whoever wrote this recipe obviously has a lot of time on their hands.  There is no way that this only takes 20 minutes for total time.  Also, the skins are almost impossible to get off of the hazelnuts.  I ended up leaving most of them on.  I couldn't even get them off with a clean scouring pad. In the end, the carrots didn't even taste that good.  They had too much butter and they just tasted like plain carrots that were greasy with some hazelnuts thrown in. I will not waste my time making these again.

I was doubtful about the garlic but with all the great reviews I tried it but it did not go over at all at the potluck I ook this dish to.  It would probably be good without the garlick.
