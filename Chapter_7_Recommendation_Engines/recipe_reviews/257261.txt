Incredibly delicious! Creamier and smoother than my childhood Cream of Wheat! Subbed white sugar with brown, and added a touch of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla (sorry, I didnâ€™t measure). Also pairs phenomenally with hot apple cider! 112% recommend this recipe to Cream of Wheat lovers.

This cream of wheat definitely didn't have any lumps. It had to be the creamiest bowl of porridge I've ever had. I was really skeptical of all the liquid and the long cook time. But, it's worth it if you like it creamy. I thought it was just sweet enough. Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect METHOD!! But tastes much better if you use no salt, butter, sugar, etc. and only use Semolina flour and Milk and Water ONLY. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this vegan using soy milk and earth balance butter. But I'm sure it would be delicious with any other vegan milk. I also added a little cinammon and vanilla extract. Its fantastic! Can't wait to feed this recipe to my kids for breakfast someday!

Creamy, I used blue corn meal. The family enjoyed eating and dipping toast in it. The babies loved it too.

This was so creamy and delicious.  i was sceptical at first with all the fluid and cooking time as well but, I was blown away how great it was to the normal way on the box.  Thank you, I will definitely be making it this way from now on.

I made this ahead to heat up tomorrow morning and tried a bite. It was incredibly creamy and delicious with the touch of vanilla and maple syrup I added. I will eat it with berries, maple syrup, and maybe some nuts.

Very reminiscent of my childhood. Really enjoyed this recipe. Quick and easy prep and deliciously creamy results. Will definitely use again. (Very easy to adjust to taste as well - add more / less milk, cinnamon, more sugar, etc.).
