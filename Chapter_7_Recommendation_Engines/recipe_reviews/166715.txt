This turned out awesome, but I totally modified it almost beyond recognition based on what I had on hand. I omitted chile pepper and ginger, and substituted szechuan for hoisin, 2% milk for coconut milk, and garlic powder for fresh garlic. I used half the amount of peanut butter (smooth) and then threw in some crushed peanuts. It turned out awesome though!!!

This recipe was good, but I made some changes the second time around that made it phenomenal. I found the consistency to be better when I tried it with smooth peanut butter, and tossed some crushed peanuts on top when serving. I also added a half cup more of chicken stock, and the juice of half a lime for that authentic tangy Thai zing. When cooking for kids or those not fond of spicy dishes, substitute the chile for 2 Tbs. sweet chile sauce. All in all a great sauce.

Flavors didn't seem to meld well--I don't think the tamarind goes well with peanut. It was heavy, which is uncharacteristic of all other good Thai food we have had. I won't make this again.

Super easy and tasty, this was exactly what I needed. I omitted the fish and hoisin sauce sauce I didn't have any, and used evaporated milk instead of coconut. Went great over some leftover rice pilaf.

I've been searching for tamarind sauce recipe to make at home that tastes like a sample sauce I had a few month ago called singing sauce or singers sauce(i don't remember.) I would've never thought of adding fish sauce and coconut cream to a peanut-tamarind sauce, but I'm very excited! Thank you for sharing!

Loved it.  Went great with chicken satay sticks.
