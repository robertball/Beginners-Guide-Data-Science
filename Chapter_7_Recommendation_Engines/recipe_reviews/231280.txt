Perfect for a cold winter night, problem was, that its been so warm around here, that I was jonesing for a chowder, glad I found this one!! I added a couple Bay leaves for some extra flavor. I warmed up some rolls and dinner was ready! Delish! Thank You Ruthannlacombe:)

I love this soup. I added thyme, used chicken stock instead of water and used cream of celery soup. I also didn't bother to buy half and half. Used all milk, still very  good.

I didn't use mushroom soup. Instead I thickened the soup with corn starch and water, mixed together, then added at the end. I used pre-cooked bacon bits. I also added about 1/2 tsp black pepper and several shakes of crushed red pepper.  It was good!
