I had Snow on the Mountain at a church ladies party right after Thanksgiving (using leftover turkey).  I thought "What a strange ingredient list!". BUT IT IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE RECIPES and I have served it twice since I found this recipe.  Everybody loves it and comes back for seconds.  Try it and you will like it.

I was very scared to make this dish but I was feeling brave. My boyfriend asked me to find this dish because he said it was something his grandma used to make (before she passed) for special occassions when he was younger. I've never heard of this before, there were few reviews, and the combo of ingrediants got me worried but I really wanted to surprise my boyfriend. I reduced the pineapple ALOT and didn't use any coconut. When he came home and saw this dish on the dinner table, he was very happy. The taste is nothing like I've ever had before but it was very good and my boyfriend said it was just like his grandma's, which I'll accept as a huge compliment! Thank you Nancy - for teaching me something new and providing me another way to make my bofriend really happy!

I have made this recipe a few times. My daughter-in-law has her own gravy recipe she uses. It is always a hit with us, but we put all the ingredients that we want in seperate bowls. Like a smorgasboard. You can use the rice as a base and pile on the toppings you like. That way everyone is happy. Great for company too.

I make this in the crock pot for super easy preparation and EVERYONE LOVES IT.  It's just really hard to get them to try it.  In the crock pot I dump the following: frozen chicken 2 cans cream of chicken soup 1 can chicken broth  and let it cook all day while I'm at work.  The chicken shreds itself nicely.  Then I make white rice in my rice cooker ($10 from target).  Then let everyone add pineapple chunks, cheddar cheese, chopped celery, and chow mein noodles.  Its Fantastic and SUPER EASY!!

I really liked this recipe, but my family wasn't that thrilled with the strange combination of foods...the flavors go well together even though they are so different...it is a 'fresh' tasting asian style flavor without being stir fried..really easy and quick to put together...the recipe calls for too much of the sauce I think, so next time I will cut that part iin half. I left out the pimentos and it was good without it, but the saltiness of the pimentos would probably be good too! Over all i really liked it and loved how quick it was put together. I will make it again, but likely not with my kids around :)

You wouldn't think that all these interesting flavors would mix together so well, but they do and the product is very good! Also very easy; most everything is bought in the can and ready to serve, and the other ingredients just require chopping. After layering all the ingredients, eat RIGHT AWAY-otherwise the chinese noodles get soggy.

We make this without the gravy or pineapple. Instead we cube 4 cups cooked chicken and heat it in 3/4 cup Italian dressing and instead of pineapple, we use chopped pickles. We don't use pimento. Everything else is the same, though and it is great.

Wow, no one in my family took more than one bite - including me!  It just wasn't a good flavor combination for us - and the nuts just made it worse.  It was very visually appealing, though, and if you like that strange combination of flavors, I can see the appeal.  It just didn't work for us.

This was pretty tasty. We used it for a women's retreat and allowed the women to put their own plates together. It IS an odd combination of flavors, but by serving it buffet style, everyone has the opportunity to pick and choose what they want to include. Best of all, it's very, very easy to adapt this recipe to a large group!
