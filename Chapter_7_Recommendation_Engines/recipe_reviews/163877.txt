AWESOME recipe using red skinned potatoes!  I did not have canned potatoes so I cubed about 8 small to medium sized red potatoes and boiled in water on the stove top about 8-10 minutes.  While potatoes were cooking, I caramelized the onions with the EVOO and also added 1 tablesoon of honey (was out of agave) to add more flavor.  Drained potatoes and added remaining ingredients.  Totally forgot to add the 1/2 stick of room temperature butter on top of potatoes! This dish really did not need the added butter (or calories) because it really has a good flavor with the paprika and caramelized onions.  I garnished with rosemary before serving.  Next time I may put some rosemary in this dish prior to baking.  I will make again.

Tasty!!!!!! I REALLY like these! I used fresh potatoes, and boiled them first. I thought while making them that the garlic would be a very heavy taste, but it was not at all. The sweetness of the added onions is great! I will make this again and again...thank you for sharing! By the way...I made NO changes to this and they were perfect!

A definite keeper, my family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except for using fresh potatoes instead of the canned. I peeled them, quartered them and put them in the microwave for 4 minutes before proceeding with the rest of the recipe. Thanks!

I had some cans of potatoes that my Mom had given me. Had no idea what to do with them having never used them before. I googled and this recipe popped up. Great one and so easy. They tasted fresh. No one could tell they were canned. Yay!

Wow! Amazing recipe!!! I used fresh red and yukon gold potatoes and one vidalia onion and one red onion, mmm. I didn't add the butter before the paprika either b/c I'm trying to watch the calories.

This recipe is great!!  I used fresh new potatoes cut into large bite sized pieces.  Then I followed the suggestions of several people...  I precooked the potatoes for 4 minutes in the microwave.  I then added some oil - stirred the potatoes in the oil, added the seasoning, and baked the potatoes.  When the dish was 10 minutes away from being done, I stirred the potatoes and added the caramelized onions and paprika.  I didn't add the butter at the end, it didn't need it.  This recipe is a keeper!  There was a small amount left over and I look forward to using it in a scrambled egg breakfast burrito tomorrow, yum!!

OMG - these are so so good.  I used fresh red potatoes, cut them into wedges and only boiled them for 10 min.  Didn't want them to fall apart when tossing them and they cook in the oven long enough to finish cooking.  10 to 15 min. is not long enough to properly caramelize onions in my experience.  I cook them slow for about 30 min at least.  I also used less butter and these potatoes were still so awesome - so glad I tried this recipe - thanks Gigi!

Delicious! We varied the recipe slightly and it still came out great. The second time we made these, we boiled boneless skinless chicken breasts for about 10 min, cut the chicken into cubes slightly larger than the potato cubes and placed them in the dish as well.  On top of the paprika, we added a bit of basil instead of butter. The chicken came out EXTREMELY moist. Definitely going to be a dish served again!

Great recipe, but some of my more  caramelized onions burned after the baking.  Next time, I'm going to slice the potatoes, and not cook the onions as thoroughly as I did. Also, I'll reduce the amount of butter because it really wasn't needed all that much.

These were good for a different type of potato dish.  Instead of sprinkling the paprika on top of the mixture, I mixed it in with the garlic and oil and potatoes.

These were really lovely!  My very picky husband said I have to make these all the time now!  I left out the dried minced garlic because I didn't have any, but I don't think it really needed it in addition to the salt and powder, imo.  And I just mixed the paprika in with the rest of the spices.  Also, I didn't put on the extra butter at the end and I don't think I will when I make these again.  Thirdly and lastly, caramelising onions takes longer than 10-15 minutes and on a lowish heat, but they are a great addition to these tasty potatoes!  :D  Thanks so much!

These were wonderful.  The only thing I will differently next time is add the caramelized onions the last 5-10 minutes of baking.  They cooked too long and dried out a lot.  Why don't I caramelize onions more often???  YUM!

Fabulous! I boiled tiny new red potatoes (cut in half to bite size) for ten minutes as others recommended, and added very thin strips of red pepper, some skinny asparagus, and two large garlic cloves slivered. I carmelized the onions in 2 tbsps.butter and about a teaspoon and a half of sugar once they started sizzling. I didn't carmelize completely(maybe about 10 minutes on medium heat). The 40 minutes in the oven on 400 did the rest :) I also stirred about halfway through cooking time. Fiance could not stop raving!!! Thanks! :)

These potatoes were very good.  I went with the canned potatoes which was a new product for me, but WOW, how did I not know about those before?  They made everything so much easier!
The only issue I had was the onions getting a bit crispy in the oven, I think I'll add them closer to the end of cooking next time and see if that works better.

I made a few changes, but this recipe is great! I actually used half of this recipe and half of another to create the PERFECT potato side dish. I made the caramelized onions and used the seasonings (except the dried minced garlic... and with what I used, I didn't measure it out, just tossed it in). Instead of using the canned potatoes, I used fresh red potatoes. I cut them into wedges, soaked them in cold water, patted them dry, and tossed them with the seasonings. I put them in the oven on a baking sheet for 20 minutes, flipped them, put them back in and baked them for another 15-20. When they came out, I tossed them with the onions. Serve with ketchup. YUMMM! Perfectly crispy wedges.

The only change that I made was to replace the canned potatoes with fresh baby red potatoes.  I've made this 3 times since I tried it the first time 2 weeks ago and compliments to the chef were high!!  This recipe is delicious.

Excellent recipe.  It does not need as much cooking oil and butter as listed.  I used about 1/2 of the oil and 1/4 of the butter and it still turned out FANTASTIC.  This made it a much healthier and lower calorie recipe.  My daughter and husband also liked it----although neither of them ate the onions.  I, on the other hand, ate their share.  They do not like onions to begin with so their vote didn't count.  The potatoes were easy to separate from the onions so even if you have some like me who do not like onions this is still a good recipe.

The spice listing can mess you up as you are suppose to sprinkle the paprika on the end. The flavor overall was pretty good, but the caramelizing and then baking the onions made some of them burned. I like the texture the potatoes get after the baking though, with the crispy edges.

This was delicious.  As a personal preference I'll reduce the amount of butter and oil in it the next time I make it.  I think it'd be just as delicious (and a bit healthier) with a reduced amount.

Very good. Would make again. The only problem was my onions came out of the oven burnt. Maybe I caramelized them too long in the skillet.

These were really good!  I changed the servings for 2 and followed it exactly as the recipe states.  My husband and I LOVED them!  Will definitely be making them again soon!
