This recipe was disappointing. As a vegetarian, I love a good bean salad. Some of the best bean salads I know of happen to be very simple as well, so the lack of ingredients didn't surprise me. However, this bean salad is BLAND. I am not posting a photo because my "simple" salad turned out to be a tad more complex - I kept adding different ingredients and herbs in order to salvage the salad to no avail. Don't make this salad - there are so many better ones.

I really liked this. I made as written but feel you need to cut back on the oil and add more vinegar. This was simple and straight forward and I will make it again for sure.
