This was a complete waste of expensive seafood. It takes a whole lot longer than 1 hour for the shrimp and scallops to "cook" in the lime juice and since I listened to this recipe they never fully finished since everything else was already added. This recipe might work if you get pre-cooked seafood, but if you don't then you have to soak the seafood overnight in just lime juice before adding everything else. The 1 hour is very misleading and inaccurate.

This dish came out fantastic. I only gave it 4 stars instead of five because I think the measurements are a bit off in this recipe. For instance, I served 12 people on easter with using 2 1/2 lbs shrimp (4 seemed Way too much), 2 cucumber, 1 lb immitation crab (instead of scallops), and 1 large onion. This made so much that I had a hard time finding a bowl to hold it. It was hit at our feast and everyone had some; as well many went for seconds. I still had nearly half a bowl of leftovers! (which is fine by me :)

I made this for a potluck sort of affair, and it was well-received. I used one lb shrimp, one lb scallops, and one lb haddock loins (I'm a poor college kid, I can't afford $50 worth of fish), but kept the veggies the same. To facilitate eating with chips, I chopped up the fish to about the size of a fingernail. We ate this with globs of sour cream and guacamole, and some people even took some home. 

I made wraps out of the leftovers for lunch and dinner today, and I still have leftovers! This serves waaaay more people than I was expecting. The only problem is that it isn't as good the next day.

So good! We have ceviche (made from my grandmother's recipe) every summer, served in martini or margarita glasses, of course, and Javi's recipe is the real thing.  It's low-cal, too, which makes it even better. Highly recommended.

I've been looking for a good ceviche recipe and all I had to see was the picture to know this was the one. I am from the Sonoran Mex area and this is the closest thing I've found to what they serve in resturants in that area. Thank You

We used 2 lbs shrimp and 3 lbs talapia to cut on cost, but other than that we followed the recipe and loved it. We cut the shrimp and fish into smaller than bite sized pieces before adding the lime and lemon juice, so it cooked very quickly, an hour was more than adequit.  We brought this to a party, hoping to munch on left overs for dinner and came home with an empty bowl.

We always let the seafood sit overnight or for a few hours in the lime/lemon juice to "cook". Then drain a small amount of liquid before adding the rest of the ingredients. We mix in  the chopped cucumber last since it will get mushy in the mix. Add a few slices of avocado on top and it's perfect!

Loved this and it was a big hit at the bunco party I took it to.  The shrimp cookedd within a couple of hours in the lime juice so it was fine.  Next time, I will leave the cucumber in big chunks, just a personal preference, and I'm thinking of adding avocado chunks.  The flavors though as is in this recipe are fantastic.  Thanks to Javi for making me look good ;-)

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I found that the measurements were off. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, and it took 6 + hours to "cook" the fish. It made way more than my family of 4 could even put a dent in, it also was very fishy tasting and we were quite disappointed.   Now the 2nd time I made this I chose to make it with 1/2lb scallops, 1lb hake Fillets, and 1/2lb redfish,  also doubled the amount of lime juice  (86'd the lemon juice) to fully cover the fish and let it sit for about 30 min while I prepared all the veggies (I split the amounts of veggies in half) and added a dash of cayenne pepper too. ; )  we like it Hot*    The lime juice "cooking" time was reduced to 1 hour 20 min and it was the best Ceviche we have had including our trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I hope this helps anyone who had the same issues I had my first attempt making this ceviche recipe.

Not my favorite ceviche, but this is really good. We added squid and haddock to the mix. A bit limey, but otherwise very good! We sliced some French bread thinly, toasted it with olive oil and garlic powder, and ate it with the ceviche. We enjoyed this a lot.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used shrimp, crab, and scallops.  After reading the other reviews, I set aside a few hours for the shrimp to cook.  It came out beautifully!

The recipe is easy and great.  I modified it by using a purple onion instead of white.  I also refrigerated my seafood with the lime/lemon juice overnight and added the vegetables the next morning as well as the salt & pepper.  Once it was all complete it went back in the fridge for at least an hour before serving.

Excellent recipe but if you want to kick it up a notch, add some "Clamato juice" and some chopped avocados. Happy, happy!

I don't know how this can cook in one hour?  Mine was entirely raw on the inside - I had to microwave it.  I think you need at least 4-5 hours and I also think you need way more lemons and limes than he recommends - all the fish has to be covered in juice.  Four limes and one lemon doesn't seem anywhere close to enough.

Next time I will either use bay shrimp or pre cooked shrimp. Takes a lot longer than an hour for the shrimp to cook. Very frusterating.

Used Tilapia instead of half the shrimp and am glad I did! This made soooo much! It was awesome, the tilapia was a little less expensive and there was plenty of fish in the Ceviche and it tasted awesome!

Nice, authentic, the scallops are a nice touch. From reading other reviews, don't cut too much lime and lemon juice when scaling down recipe. It also helps to dice up the seafood, don't "cook" it whole.

The 1 hour "cook" time in the lime/lemon juice is definitely not enough.  I even cut the shrimp into smaller pieces and by the 5 hour mark they were still raw inside.  I am going to let it sit overnight but I feel like it won't be that good letting it sit that long.

It was a hit!  Instead of scallops I added Tilapia.  It took longer for the fish to cook in the citric juice but made it early in the morning and was ready to eat by dinner time.  Would have also loved to add Avocados but could not find any ripe ones in my local grocery stores!

Just add clamato if you have it to make it sonoran style and have ketchup on the side.  It taste really good.

Shrimp were ok, but ahi tuna and halibut are the best.  Cut raw fish into little bite size pieces and let sit until they "cook".

Okay, I became too nervous about eating raw shrimp and let this sit overnight.  It should not have come as a surprise to have found myself with a big bowl of rubbery shrimp in the morning.  It was still pretty good but the consistency was pretty tough.  
2ND TRY:  I did it again and once again, the shrimp did not "cook" even after it sat for 5 hours.  So, I removed all of the shrimp and separated the chopped veggies from the lime juice.  Then I dropped the shrimp into boiling water until they were pink (45 - 60 seconds), transferred them to the chilled lime juice for a couple of minutes, and mixed them back up with the veggies.  Next time, I'll start by boiling the raw shrimp first, then I'll let everything soak for a while!  It's a tasty meal but jeez-louise!  What a hassle!

This wasn't bad.  My neighbors recipe is a little better.  I did add some avacado for another added texture and flavor...all in all it was decent and easy enough to make.

I love this....I make it without seafood as well just to have a light dinner. I serve all the veggies on a tostada (hard fried corn tortilla). I also add a few TBLS of clamato rather than olive oil. I omit the peppers because I don't like them but this is s delicious meal and very healthy.

This is a wonderful BASE recipe- I adjusted the amount of shrimp. I used about 1 1/2# shrimp and 1/2# bay scallops.  The lemon and lime juice should also cover the seafood for at least an hour before adding the other ingredients to be sure they get "cooked" enough.   Left overs the next day were good, but the shrimp got "tougher" after sitting in the lime juice so long.

This is the best ceviche recipe!! It does make a ton!!! But it's soooooo good. No changes needed BUT because I'm paranoid, especially with guests involved, I have always baked the scallops at 350 with a tiny bit of salt and pepper just until the edges start to brown (I lightly spray a mini muffin pan and put one large scallop in each tin.) And also out of paranoia, I boil the shrimp for just a couple of seconds... I can't remember how long I let it marinate in the past, but probably more than an hour because I'm always making a ton of food for parties and let me tell you, this is always a favorite!! Thank you and cheers to Javi!!

Perhaps really fresh seafood necessary?  I had such high hopes & was so excited to make it for our family's cinco de mayo supper.  But we were disappointed! Followed recipe exactly -- except made the recipe calculated down for only "3" (that is, using 1/4 of all ingredients).  In our family of 6, only one enjoyed it.  The rest of us found the shrimp too tough.  Just bought my shrimp today, so it was as fresh as I can get at my grocery store, but husband says we might give it a go again when we source some fresh-caught shrimp.  Also, we've enjoyed ceviche at restaurants in the past, but usually with fish only vs shrimp & scallops.  Might try the fish suggestions that other cooks listed in their reviews if we revisit this recipe.

I think the recipe's ingredient list is right, but from the other comments it's seems many people have trouble with the instructions. My fish did "cook" in the lime overnight. I refrigerated fresh cod cubes in key lime juice for 24 hours. My mistake was  the "key." Key limes are too limey. I did drain out the excess juice before adding the other ingredients, but perhaps I should have rinsed a bit. Next time I try I'll do the extra work and use fresh squeezed juice from regular limes.

I am sure this would have been delicious ceviche, unfortunately, I followed the recipe as-is, and my seafood NEVER "cooked", not even overnight and I ended up wasting what would have been otherwise good seafood. You should cut the seafood pretty small, and/or let sit in the lime juice much longer before adding the other ingredients, and/or poach the seafood a little bit before adding. Either way, this was a major disappointment.

I made this for a big party and it was a complete hit. I left out the scallops and made 1/4 of the recipe. I like my ceviche a little sweet,  so I added 3 tablespoons of ketchup and a pinch of Penzy's Chipotle Powder. It was delish! I will make this one again and again and again!!!

ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!!  Because of what I had read on the Food Network site, I did dunk my shrimp in boiling water for just a second and then immediately put them in ice water.  I also added a diced avocado just before serving so that it wouldn't get too mushed up.  Everything else I did be the recipe and it was the hit of the party.  I have already been asked to bring this to our July 4th Bash---a double batch!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe to a T.  So sad that the shrimp never cooked themselves fully in the lime juice.  Even let it sit over nite. I will try again, but this time using cooked shrimp.

I made this tonight for the 5th time and it is so delicious! Few changes from the directions I made were: Marinating the bay scallops alone for about 5 hours. When I have made this previously, I had tested different chill times, but definitely marinate it for 3hrs+. I purchased pre-cooked tiger prawns from the seafood bar and diced them. The seafood guy told me I really wouldn't want to marinate any raw shrimp in lime unless its rock shrimp (which I did before and it was great!). Granted it was just his personal opinion, but it seemed to work for my taste. I mixed in all the rest of the ingredients, including the shrimp after the bay scallops finished marinating. Saved a bit of the marinated juice to drizzle over the top. Overall this is a very delicious, super easy, light and fresh appetizer to make for a group of folks or in my case, just for me to snack on!

We followed the recipe and the shrimp were still raw after 5 hours.  that was very disappointing!  We ended up microwaving the ceviche for it to be cooked for a party.  The flavor was good, but cook the shrimp first.

4 stars for the taste ! This is a seafood cocktail not ceviche. Ceviche you grind up or chop up real fine, let it marinate for 24 hours or so. Had the right ingredients.

Tasty - I lightened-up on the serranos (not all like it hot, put on the side). 1-2 Avocado - chop (stir-in) or slice (goes on top) ; and, Use less lime (used bottled) and more lemon and that's what worked for me!  This Guera got a request for a 2nd batch and was told it was the best they've ever had, by those who make/eat this frequently!!!!!!  Javi your recipe ROCKS!!!!!! Thanks for sharing.

It was really good, but I didn't add the oil, because I don't like the taste of oil in something you eat cold, and I had to add extra lime juice. Overall still 5 stars

I have made this recipe by following the directions as stated and it was fantastic. I also make a shortcut version that is excellent by using 2 lbs. precooked and cleaned thawed shrimp cut in half, omit the serrano pepper and scallops, 1 tomato chopped, one cucumber chopped, 3 green onions chopped, one jalapeno diced small, add one chopped avocado, 2 limes squeezed, 1/2 lemon squeezed, 2 tsp. olive oil, 2 tbs. fresh chopped cilantro, salt & pepper to taste, refrigerate one hour, serve on flat fried corn tortillas or with tortilla chips. Fabulous! Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe!

I had the same problem as other reviewers, my shrimp and scallops didn't cook. But, since I had read the views I did it overnight (but still didn't cook). So I went ahead and sautéed it. I'm wondering if it's because my seafood had been previously frozen?

This recipe was fantastic, But the only downfall was the seafood does take a lot longer to cook in the lime and lemon juice I found overnight really did the trick the shrimp was nice and pink all around and the scallops were nice firm :-) Flavors totally rocked my socks off.

Ideal Food for a Day!
I am nuts about food and always bake and cook every chance that I get! Every Sunday is the ideal day for baking and cooking such. I really made sure that it is nutritious and even mix herbs with it for a unique tang!

Very good.  Since I was short on time, I didn't want to wait for shrimp to cook in lime. I dunked the seafood in boiling water for 10 seconds prior to cutting. Pretty good ceviche. I was told leftovers were better the next day.

Scaled down and only used shrimp, but this is a great foundation recipe for ceviche.  Certainly as enjoyable as ceviche we've had at quality restaurants.

This was delicious.  The shrimp weren't fully opaque after nearly two hours, so I cut them in half--I'll start the process that way next time.  Regardless of any substitutions for the seafood, be sure that you add enough lime juice to fully cover it for food safety.  This is great with avocado chunks added at the end.

A keeper. Very good ceviche recipe. I did add chunks of fish to this and hot sauce, which added a nice kick! I love ceviche. Thanks.

I have had ceviche in Mexico & this is pretty close in taste. I like it best with shrimp & a good white fish. I also added radishes. It is good with scallops though. I like to eat it as a dip with tortilla chips.

I made this using 2 lbs of seafood (a mixture of scallops, halibut and shrimp) and the rest of the ingredients as written, except that I halved the cilantro and used one tsp salt. I cut the scallops and halibut into smaller pieces and marinated them in the fridge for four hours, and added the (already cooked) shrimp and the veggies for the last hour... and I added some chopped avocado at the end. Ample for 10 for appetizers (with corn tortilla chips), and we have leftovers. Thanks for the recipe! Delicious!!

Let me give you some advice. Cut the shrimp into smaller pieces and juice way more lemon/lime than what this recipe calls for. If you juice enough to cover all or almost all of the seafood, it will cook in 30-45 minutes. Also, add some avocado chunks. And if you are like me and don’t like the taste of raw onion that much, let the onion cook in the lime juice along with the seafood.

I have made this recipe a handful of times and the finished product is always delicious - but getting there is a struggle because if you follow the directions exactly as written, you aren't going to have cooked fish for 6-8 hours.  So, cut all the fish into small bites and mix the cut pieces in a large bowl.  Then divide the fish into two or three shallow glass dishes (like cake pans) and cover the fish with lemon and lime juice.  Set that aside until it starts to turn pink.  Then, add a portion of the salt, pepper, onion, jalapeno, serrano and cilantro and olive oil to each pan.  let it keep "cooking" until the fish is done.  Drain off some liquid from each pan and dump everything back into a large glass bowl (always glass - metal can interfere with the reaction of the citrus and fish) and stir in cucumber and tomato then serve immediately.  Finished product always gets rave reviews!

This was a great recipe.  I quartered  it since ceviche  is better on the first day. I diced the shrimp  and they pinked up just fine. If you poach them it isn't really ceviche.

The reason it was inedible is because the time for letting it "cook" in the citrus is radically incorrect. As others suggested, I cut up the seafood (shrimps cut into 4 pieces each, scallops (large) cut into 6-8 pieces each) and I doubled the marinating time (2 full hours). I was being very careful about this, because this dish was supposed to be my contribution to a potluck, so it had to be ready on time. It was nowhere near ready. At the two hour mark, the shrimp was still gray and translucent. At the three hour mark, it was beginning to become opaque. Obviously, it was useless for my potluck. I'm pretty irritated.

As soon as the lime and lemon juice mixed with the shrimp the color turned to opaque within 3 minutes.  The recipe is great and would recommend it to anyone who knows what authentic shrimp ceviche should taste like.

This is really good! I covered 2 1/2 lbs. of shrimp, 1 lb. of fake crab chunks, and 2 chopped cod fillets with lime juice over night, then in the morning added 3 roma tomatoes, 1 onion, 3 jalapenos, salt, pepper, cucumber,  garlic powder, and cilantro. I didn't add oil. I also added some clamato juice, after I then drained about 1./2 of the lime juice off so the shrimp wouldn't get rubbery. It made a huge mixing bowlful. I am guessing that it's at least 12 very large servings.

I use two cucumbers, no shrimp, all fish and add a couple more limes worth of juice. Really needs to sit for 4 hours + before fish is done.

Made this tonight and it turned out well. I found that this needed more lemon/lime in order to "cook" and as some other reviews have mentioned it needed quite a bit longer before it was done.
