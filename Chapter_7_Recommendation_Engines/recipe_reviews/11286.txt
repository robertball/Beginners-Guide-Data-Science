This is a fantastic bar cookie/brownie! My husband and daughter agree:) It is delicious as is but I could easily see it without the nuts and marshmallows and it would still be delicious. The only issue I had was when I mixed the egg in after removing the pan from the medium heat - next time I will allow the mixture to cool slightly before adding the egg because the egg cooked a bit. It didn't affect the end result but I didn't like having cooked egg in the mixture. When I took the bars out of the oven they looked very raw in the middle but I took them out anyway. After about 2 hours they did firm up and were perfect. I personally liked them even more the next day! I can see bringing these to gatherings and bake sales with great success!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter was so thick I worried I did something wrong, but the end product was delicious.  Another reviewer mentioned when the time was up the middle didn't look done, but she took them out anyway.  I should have followed her advice because I left mine in a few minutes longer and they were slightly over done (but still tasty).  Next time I will put foil in the pan and then grease the foil because it was very difficult getting the bars out of the pan.

These are very different! A cross between a brownie and a candy. Just a note- one bag of butterscotch chips is 1 2/3 cups.

Everyone in the house went nuts over these! I played around a bit. Didn't have any butterscotch chips so I used white chocolate instead..then reversed it using semi sweet and added white chocolate. This is just a great recipe to play with. A

These are FANTASTIC! The only warning I can really give is that they are V-E-R-Y rich! When I make them again I will probably cut them into small bite-size squares and serve them on a platter because a whole "brownie" size piece was almost too much to eat @ once because of the richness. Awesome bars and incredibly easy to make!

Wonderful cookie. Always gets compliments. However the second time I made it, I modified the process just slightly and found it much easier to handle. I didn't leave it on the heat as long as recommended. This is what I did instead: Melt butter. Remove from heat. Add brown sugar, stirring/mixing well. Add butterscotch chips. Stir till mostly melted. Add beaten eggs and vanilla. Stir again well. Add flour and baking powder gradually, stirring all the while. Add marshmallows and chocolate chips, mixing well. I don't always include the nuts and I don't add salt. I like that you only have to dirty one saucepan; don't even use a bowl.

Sorry but these were not good at all. I've never had a bar from Nordstrom to compare but these were a huge disappointment. (1.) They tasted like nothing but sugar in a chewy form. I love all the ingredients but strangely when you put them all together it was nothing but sugar overload. I think if you blindfolded someone and gave them one they would be hard-pressed to tell you that there is butterscotch and chocolate chips and marshmallows in there. I certainly couldn't taste any of those items. (2.) In spite of baking for only 25 minutes they were awful to get out of the pan and still have them look presentable. (3.) My pan was a nightmare to get clean after these babies. I would have given them one star but my husband brought them to work for a potluck and they were all gone after it was over. Two of his co-workers said they liked them which surprised him because he thought the same thing that I did when he tried them. Sorry. I wouldn't make these again.

You must like very sweet & chewy treats to enjoy these. I LOVE them. Avoid using a nonstick pan-you'll just scratch it up. Using a Pyrex glass pan might've made clean up easeir. The recipe should say to temper the eggs or bring them to room temperature. One of them curdled- I forgot that rule.

4 stars because I reduced the choc.chips butterscotch and marshmallows by half. Otherwise it would have been WAY too sweet! To retain the butterscotch flavor I would incorporate 1/2 cup butterscotch chips in with the choc.chip/nut/mallow mixture. Also it is a MUST that you line the pan with foil. After cooling slightly I lifted out by the foil and cut into bars.

I wasn't too sure about these when I saw the batter. (It almost reminded me of blended yams with marshmallows sticking out all over). After baking they looked better and tasted amazing!! I didn't use any nuts and more like 1 cup marshmallows and choc chips...as well as only one bag of butterscotch chips. I think anymore would be way too sweet to handle. I will be keeping this recipes with my alterations and definitely making again.

I must say I was a little skeptical when I read the ingredients. I couldn't see how any recipe with SO much sugar (butterscotch chips chocolate chips marshmallows AND brown sugar) and could be anything but sickeningly sweet. But with all the rave reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I should have gone with my instincts. I think after just one mushy bar I have developed diabetes. I love sweets and anything with chocolate is OK in my book but this was SO sweet and SO mushy that it was beyond enjoyable. I wouldn't waste your ingredients on this one.

These turned out just perfect! Exactly how I remember them at Nordstrom. I left out the walnuts because I don't like them and these bars were still wonderful. I also sent half of them to work with my husband yesterday and his coworkers are already requesting more. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't really like these that much the first day I made them (without the nuts) but for some reason they tasted SO much better the next day. My boyfriend ate nearly half the pan! I'd suggest that if you plan on taking these to a party make them a day ahead of time (assuming you can keep away from them). The only reason I won't make these very often is because they're almost a little TOO good and not at all good for you!

I thought this recipe did not turn out good at all. I wonder if maybe my butterscotch chips were a poor brand because they didnt melt very well. If you do make this recipe make sure you dont add the eggs to the hot mixture because youll fry them. Gradually blend them in a separate bowl. I would recommend a different recipe.

Absolutely the best! I used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch b/c that is what i had on hand and had to substitute some baking chocolate for some of the chocolate chips b/c I ran out...these were still fabulous! I took them out of the oven just a bit early so they are perfectly moist and a bit gooey just like a i like them! I will definitely make them again....I can't wait to try them with butterscotch chips! Definitely a KEEPER!!

This was just not an impressive recipe. I was all excited reading the ingredients but upon tasting it it didn't taste anything different then your average chocolate chip cookie bar. The flavor of the butterscotch was all but lost in the flour and the marshmallows didn't contribute anything in my opinion. I would use less flour and more butterscotch and I might even add dried cranberries in place of the nuts. I'll wait til next year though. Just not motivated enough to try this again. Still reeling over the disappointment.

I have made these but have yet to taste them as they are in the oven as I type. They smell good! I just wanted to put it out there that when I did the first stage in the pan I didn't read the directions properly. I plopped everything in the pan at once and heated. The mixture was separated into a peanut butter like paste on the bottom and a butter oil slick surrounding. If this happens to you do not fret! Once I added the eggs (mixed it in the stand mixer) it smoothed right out and all seem to have gone well after that!

I didn't have marshmallows and don't care for nuts so I skipped those. Plus I was a little low on butterscotch (about 1 1/2 cups) so I added a tablespoon or two of peanut butter. They were definitely very rich and sweet but I liked them. My boyfriend who isn't big on sweets liked them. And my coworkers all loved them. They were easy and a crowd pleaser they will definitely come around again!

I got this recipe from a friend and have made it often... we stir in the marshmallows and chocolate chips while it's still warm and omit the nuts. It makes a really yummy gooey brownie-like treat that stores freezes and also ships really well. Great recipe!!

I printed this recipe out probably a year ago and finally got around to trying it. I used only 1 cup of chips because I had "double chocolate" chips which are very rich and I used pecans instead of walnuts. The batter looked very strange going into the baking dish. And I have to admit was even stranger looking after baking for 25 mins. I wasn't sure if it was "done" but pulled it out in fear of overbaking it. For all it's strangeness I was pleasantly surprised. It had a good taste and gooey texture that I love. You definitely have to wait for it to completely cool because they set up so much better. While it's not one of my all time favorite recipes it's a definite keeper. And something different for a change of pace from the typical cookie or brownie. Thanks Cathy:)

This was soooo goood! I served it for my graduation party and it was gone in literally seconds!! Next time I will make a bigger batch. I actually messed up on this recipe... I added the chocolate chips before the batter was comepletely cooled and the chocolate melted into the batter! But I think it really added to the taste anyway. I also didn't have any walnuts on hand so I made mine with pecans. Thanks so much for the recipe I will be making this again and again.

This was very good and certainly worth baking. I used 1 package of butterscotch chips and that was sufficient. It is a good "blonde brownie" type recipe that I will use again. I would think if chocolate chips were substituted as suggested by some other reviewers it would be more like a traditional brownie.

These are good...I'm eating one while it's still warm & I know some reviewers said they are better the next day but..... I added a little coconut & maybe next time will use peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch?? I also used a little less marshmellows and chocolate chips just because that's all I had. Will make again as they are easy & good.

This is one of my new favorite desserts! They're very similar to brownies but so much better. The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips in place of the butterscotch chips. I can't wait to try it as the recipe is written next time.

Maybe I shouldn't rate this one. I have never had a Nordy bar before so didn't have any preconceptions. I tried it because it used some of the ingredients I wanted to use - and i love butterscotch. But the butterscotch flavor was lost somehow which is strange since the only thing that could have overcome it was the marshmallows...anyway despite my disappointment the pan disappeared in very short order. It was certainly a viable cookie bar just not what I was hoping for.

A friend brought these to a potluck this weekend and we all loved them! I ate more than I should admit that day (and the leftover ones the next day). Sooo good!

These are way too gooey and sticky for bar cookies. Very difficult to get out of the pan because they don't stiffen up at all. Maybe add more flour and make regular drop cookies from the batter?

It was okay but didn't make it to my xmas cookie platter. Altough I liked how easy it was. I might use a different chip instead of butterscotch next time w/out the nuts. Make sure to completely cool before adding the chocolate chips and marshmallow.

Delicious. We actually enjoy adding the chocolate chips before the batter has cooled entirely and letting the chocolate partially melt into the batter.

These were gooey and rich. We loved them. I did not have butterscotch chips so I used chocolate chips instead. Delicious.
