This is a great starting point.  I made the dumplings exactly as stated.  First I think they need more semolina, the mixture was a little thin and my dumplings fell apart in the water and it wasn't even a strong boil.  Next time I might try making the mixture and then letting it sit in the fridge to firm a bit.  
The taste was really good.  I have been trying to re-create dumplings from a little deli in my hometown and these came closest to taste, I just need to work on texture.

I made this recipe on a cool day with low humidity and it was a nightmare.  The first reviewer was partially right... it is a starting point... but fiddle as I tried it never came together to form what I would call dumplings.

The recipe made four lovely little dumplings. I used a very fresh egg from my chickens - not sure if that was the difference - they certainly didn't give a hint of falling apart. Instead of putting the dumplings in boiling water I put them into my bubbling soup. Could have used a little more seasoning.
