"These ribs are freaking fantastic!" - a direct quote from my fiance. I think the trick for tender ribs is the indirect heat cooking method. The only changes I made were using pineapple juice concentrate instead of juice (intensifies the flavor) and I added more garlic and fresh chopped ginger to the marinade. Holy , these were good!!! We are both serious carnivores and I would be proud to serve these at any celebration. Thank you so much!!!

This is really a fantastic alternative to BBQ pork. We loved it. I didn't actually marinate it, though. I made the sauce and dumped everything in my crockpot on High. The pork was super tender and moist and had a great flavor.

Really good ribs.  This is the first time I had ever eaten ribs with anything but BBQ sauce on them and it was a very nice change.  The ribs were moist and flavorful.  I only marinated mine for about five hours, but they were still really good.  The wine and rosemary were a really nice change to the flavor.  I am thinking I may try marinading pork chops this way.  I will keep in mind for the next time I want something a little different.

This was a great marinade/sauce. I added minced ginger because we're diggin' the ginger these days. I didn't grill the ribs because I thought they would be too tough (plus it's COLD outside). I rested them on a bed of onions, covered them with the sauce and cooked them in the oven 30 minutes on 400 and 30 minutes on 325. Tender and nummy. Not sure if ribs is the best choice for this sauce. Looking forward to using it on chicken breasts and cooking them on the grill. Thank you for a great tasty marinade recipe.

These ribs are the best my family abd I have ever had.  Beside having to marinate them they are very easy to make and everyone should try them.  I can not wait to make them again and plan to for our next Fourth of July party.  Our thanks to the submitter for such an awesome recipe

I made this recipe as written except used minced garlic instead of slices. The marinade is wonderful,the rosemary adds a great touch (I'm not usually a fan of it). I'm not sure if the ribs I had were prehistoric-sized compared to other people's but they took forever to cook (maybe 1 1/2 hrs total?? I lost track). the meat was tender but it was not falling off the bone. I think I'll try this marinade with a different cut of pork... maybe chops or a loin. Very, Very Good!

I marinated it for 3 hours and then put in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and it was very flavorful and moist. The white wine and rosemary really adds a great taste to the meat. Delicious and easy!

My husband and I agreed that these were hands down the best country ribs we'd ever had... possibly even the best pork, period.  SO tender and so much flavor.  We only marinated them about 3-4 hours. We can't wait to make them for company!

These ribs were wonderful! We used very lean pork ribs, which usually dry out when cooked. But this recipes kept them moist and full of flavor. We added a can of chunk pineapple and it added a little extra pizzaz in the presentation. This recipe was a great alternative to BBQ Country Ribs. We also made mashed potatoes to accompany the meat and the left over juices were AMAZING as a light "gravy."

This was really tasty -- I am not a fan of barbecue sauce, so this was a refreshing way to prepare the ribs.  I love the taste of rosemary and garlic with pork.  I marinated this overnight and just threw it on the grill when I got home from work.  Will try this with pork chops next time.

This was very, very good and a wonderful alternative to ribs with BBQ sauce. I reduced the amount of oil to less than 1/4 cup, otherwise followed the recipe. Marinated for almost 24 hours, then tossed it into the crockpot for 9 hours. It was fall apart tender with a very good flavor. I reduced the juices on the stovetop to pour over the meat and rice. I think next time I will cook in the oven to let the fat from the meat run off and not infuse the meat so much. This will be kept in the Favorites file

made as directed and sauce smelled wonderful, so I was excited about the idea, but the ribs were so bland and tasted like (very basic) roast beef. Won't make this again.

Followed almost exactly, except for marinading time. Only got about 4 hours in instead of 8 or overnight. Will aim for the longer time next time. Also would slather on some BBQ sauce during the last 20 minutes of cooking. Excellent recipe though.

These were the best.  They had a Chinese pork type flavor.  I did not have pinapple juice so I used apricot juice instead.  They were spectacular!  I only marinated for about 4 hours.  They would only get better with more marintate time.

I just wish the marinade was a bit more pungent.  It wasn't as pronounced as I would have liked.  The ribs were REALLY tender though.  I got REALLY thick ribs, too.  They took about an hour to cook on the grill.  The temperature of the grill ranged from 325-350F

These were very good..however, made a few minor changes.  I am not a big fan of wine..therefore, I don't cook with it.  I did replace the white wine with apple cider vinegar.  Also, added ginger(from a good ole spice jar). Everything else done the same....except for good ole mother nature raining on my parade.  I broiled them for 45 min and they came out delicious!  I didn't baste them w/the remainder of sauce, however basted w/sonnys sweet bbq sauce.  Very yum.

These were good! Marinated overnight as per recipe, the flavorings were subtle but tasty...hubby said "Mmmm!"  Grilling over indirect heat was a challenge, as the grill is round & not real big, so some got real dark quickly...so put them in a foil pan & finished the cooking...will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!!

I had such high hopes but, alas, the result was not overwhelmingly wonderful.  Just OK.  I followed the recipe to the letter, no exceptions. The pungent smell was not a turn-off but nor did it beckon hungry eaters.  We rarely get to eat ribs so this recipe will not reappear in our home. Very interesting ingredient list.

Loved the change from bbq sauce.  Wonderful flavor and tender ribs. My son gobbled up the leftovers which is something he normally doesn't do.

This marinade was very good.  I didn't have time for 8 hours or overnight.  I marinaded them for 3 hours then slow grilled them over pecan wood.  Very tender... I recommend brushing on some Jack Daniels Tennessee Hickory grilling sauce the last 20 minutes or so.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very simple to make and my husband really liked it.  It didn't need to cook as long as the recipe stated.  That was the only major variance I found.

Liked this recipe. I didn't have pineapple juice and instead substituted a Capri Sun Fruit Punch. Everyone liked the flavor.

These were delicious. Will definitely make again. Boiled up the marinade for a long time then used it over the cooked ribs. Great recipe!

We LOVE this recipe!!  Have made it often...decided it was time to give credit where credit is due!!  I will admit to adding ginger to the marinade ( only because we LUV the ginger tang!!).  Other than that...AS IS recipe!!

05-31-16 ~ We really enjoyed the taste of this rib recipe.  I had an opened can of pineapple, so I used that juice rather than regular canned juice.  I did marinate overnight and DH grilled as directed.  Had a great meal - the ribs, grilled romaine salad, grilled zucchini and grilled garlic bread.  Plan of making these ribs again next week.

I substituted gluten-free soy for Worcestershire to make it vegetarian.  Also, not a fan of anchovies (usually in the Worcestershire).  Really good!  It cooked about 10 mins. faster than expected.

I used 3 boneless ribs weighing a total of 1.3 lbs. They were like leather. The cook time was much too long. I will stick with using store bought Hoisin when I'm in a hurry and cook to my instinct. these looked and felt done after 25 minutes! Wish I had heeded my hunch.

These were very good.  Next time I think I would cover them after they brown a bit because they were a little dry or make them in the crock pot.
