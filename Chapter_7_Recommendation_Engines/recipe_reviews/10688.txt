I have no idea why there are so few reviews for this recipe. It's phenomenal!! Hearty, homey and wholesome, full of flavor.  Equally at home with a tall, cold glass of milk or a steaming mug of latte. I made two minor alterations. The 2 tsp of salt seemed too high to me, so I cut back to 1-1/2 tsp and the result seemed just right to my palate. I discovered I only had 1 cup of raisins, so I filled in with a cup mixed of craisins and cut-up prunes. I did allow them to cool before mixing them in, as directed, and I did chill overnight. However, the second time I made them, I didn't chill, and there was no discernible difference in the end product. They don't spread on the sheet, so what you see going into the oven is pretty much what you get coming out. Mine, therefore, were much puffier than those pictured. Lovely, chewy texture which equals a good keeper. The spice makes them irresistible. 10 minutes was perfect timing. The recipe makes a lot, so perfect for a crowd, one you'll be proud to serve. A fabulous heritage cookie jar filler.

These are great cookies, especially right out of the oven! I baked some half an hour ago and there are only two left. I mixed up the whole batch, formed them into four rolls, and keep them in the refrigerator for quick treats.
  One thing I did wrong is to mix the raisins in with the dough in the Kitchen Aid mixer. After boiling the raisins, they broke up instead of staying whole. Next time I will mix them in by hand.
  I think I will add some chopped dates next time too, and maybe increase the nutmeg a bit, and add some nuts. They would make Hermits that way.
  But they are GREAT cookies!!!!

We really liked these cookies.  Great with a cup of tea before bed.  I can't bring myself to use two teaspoons of salt in anything, so I used one and they were fine.  I also bake everything at 350, and use no stick pans so I didn't grease the pans and I baked them at 350. Great cookies for raisin lovers.

My father made a similar cookie, he called them Yummy Raisin Cookies.  He added a cup of chopped walnuts, used 1 teaspoon of salt and skipped chilling the dough.

Made these cookies just as the recipe is written.  The only change I made is that I really didn't let the raisins and water cool before I added it to the dough and I did not chill until the dough was firm.  I don't think it mattered, though -- They turned out great, especially if you like cookies with a cake-like texture to them.  Next time, I will error on the side of baking for less time.  They looked kind of pale when I check on them at 10 minutes, so I baked them for 12 and were a little darker than I would have liked them to be.  Will definitely make again and again!

Awesome cookies!  Once in a while instead of boiling the raisins I soak them in spiced rum overnight :)  Very tasty.

If you love raisins, you will love this cookie.  The predominant flavor of the raisins provides extra sweetness to the cookies.  Next time I would add walnuts to tone down the sweetness.

Great cookies! Very moist and tender. I didn't have any raisins so I used dried blueberries and cranberries instead. Turned out great!

So delicious! When I made the recipe, I doubled the vanilla and spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon). It made nice soft cookies that had everyone asking for more!

Fantastic cookie!  I used a little less salt (1 tsp) and used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar.  They were delicious - light, soft and sweet! I tried baking batches at 375 and 350 - I found they turned out best at in my electric oven at 375 on an upper level rack.  YUM!

Very cake like. Mine did not spread but puffed up so I did the PB cookie trick and marked them with a fork. They still puffed up but not as much.  Made a nice design on the top. Could have used a little more spice but a nice cookie overall.

These cookies are a firm favourite with my family...soft, fluffy, full of flavour and raisins...yummy (and I hate raisins)!
I did make a few adjustments to the recipe - cut the sugar to 1 & 1/2 cups, cut salt to 1 teaspoon and finally I only cooled the raisins & water slightly and didn't chill the dough at all...made no difference to the cookies :)

Just made these with Red Flame raisins from Indio, CA. I guess I thought the raisins could carry them, followed the recipe. They turned out a bit bland for my taste, could see adding nuts and more spice, and some butter. A vintage recipe worth tweaking.
