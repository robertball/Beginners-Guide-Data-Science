The batter is delicious, but I can't get them to crisp up.  Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?  I'm following the recipe, and cooking them to a golden brown, but they stay soft.  Help!

This is the pizzelle recipe that my family has used for years!  I'm glad to see it here!  I do use melted butter instead of margarine, but otherwise make mine exactly as written in this recipe.  These are light and delicious!  Make sure to sift the flour and baking powder together before adding - it makes the pizzelles lighter.

The ingredients in this recipe are the same as mine, but I use butter.  My recipe came from an elderly Italian woman who made the BEST pizzelles!  My instructions say to sift the flour and baking powder....add up to 3/4 c. water to thin, if necessary....batter should be thick, but fluid enough that it will ribbon off a spatula and hold it's shape...bake until steam subsides but doesn't stop.  Another instruction is to cool on paper towels...can put in a 200 degree oven to crisp further.....if using anise extract, use a 1 oz. bottle.  Oh, and the ingredients say - 2 T. Anisette or 1-1/2 t. Anise oil.  I use the oil and often add some anise seeds to it.  Always get compliments on my pizzelles!!  (and I'm Irish! LOL) This recipe will make about 100 cookies.

This recipe had a great flavor but failed to state the importance of sifing the flour or the cookies will be heavy and thick.

I got 7 and 1/2 dozen pizzelles out of this recipe. I added 2 and 1/2 teaspoons of Anise Seed along with the Anise extract. Then I varied the recipe by substituting the Anise extract with 3 tablespoons of Vanilla extract and I added 1/4 cup of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder to the sifted flour to make chocolate pizzelles. I got 7 and 1/2 dozen of those as well. I will definately keep this recipe to use over and over.

THis is a wonderful recipe for crisper pizzelles.  I prefer this texture to the softer kind - it doesn't get any better. I use butter and also sift - it makes a difference in the texture for sure.  You could also put in a bit more anise.  grazie!

Very good, I used butter and used pure vanilla extract instead of anise, but kept to the same measurements.  I have an electric iron that makes 4 at a time so to make it easy on my self I put the dough in a pastry bag, and then just squeezed out the right amount, this makes it very simple and controls the amount that you use to make even cookies.  Each iron is different and you need to adjust the time and the color you want, after a few days of curing the cookies, I now know that for my iron what color means done and for me it is a very light color because my iron makes them so thin.

Fantastic.  My Italian inlaws like them better than their own!  I use vanilla instead of anise - just personal preference and then dust them with powdered sugar.
Addendum: I use real unsalted butter (not margarine) and a good real vanilla and I have never had a problem with them not crisping up and have never had leftovers!  I have made this recipe dozens of times over the years.

Awesome! Been making these for years and they are going back on my cookie tray again this year at Christmas. I tend to like vanilla and lemon flavoring so I usually add that. I never use margarine, only butter. For best results sift the dry ingredients.

These were great!  I made them in my friend's krumkake baker and they came out just fine.  I like them with raspberry whipped cream when they are rolled into cones.  Can anybody tell me how you pronounce pizzelle or krumkake?

These came out  delicious, very crisp so I don't know why some people had problems with them staying soft.  I used butter instead of margarine because I just don't use margarine for baking.  While they were cooking, my husband came in the kitchen and said "something smells like my childhood" (he's Italian). He said they tasted just like the ones his mother used to make.  I have a Salton electric pizzelle baker and the only disappointment is that the designs were very faint so they don't look very pretty. Machine directions said 90 seconds but that was too long, about 75 seconds was perfect.

Ah, pizzelles... how do I love thee! This recipe is very good and pretty standard for pizzelles. Definitely use butter instead of margarine, and sift the flour. I've modified this recipe by substituting almond extract for the anise and adding 1/4 cup finely chopped almonds. Also, for chocolate pizzelles, substitute vanilla extract for the anise and 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder for 1/4 cup of the flour. So yummy!

This is a great traditional pizzelle recipe.  My husband requests that I make these for every Christmas.  It is best to let the eggs get to room temperature before beating.

If your pizzelles do not harden up, blame it on the humidity.  You must make pizzelles on a dry day.  I hope this helps!

I've made pizzelles for about 30 years now (Mom always made them for Christmas).  Since I hate anise, she always added vanilla butternut flavoring and I still do to this day.  I think it tastes great!  Something different to try if you don't like anise and vanilla isn't quite enough flavor.  Also, my iron must be super hot as mine cook in 10 seconds.  Any longer and they burn.  All irons are different, so experiment.

Yummy AND crispy.  Several people have commented that their cookies were NOT crispy.  The problem isn’t the recipe but in how you cool the cookies.  Place them on something like a wood cutting board as it does not conduct heat or hold in the steam the way a pan will.  I tried both methods today and discovered a big difference!  Also, cookies should be 100% cool before you stack them.

By far the absolute best pizzelle recipe I've added to my collection of favorites. Everyone loves this cookie, dough is great to work with. Also was asked to bake for an authentic Italian 80th birthday celebration and these were a favorite of the party!

These were the best I've ever made. The thicker batter was perfect in my pizzelle baker that tends to make the cookies very thin. Light crispy and perfect with coffee or tea. Can't stop eating them!

After receiving a pizzelle maker at my bridal shower, I went on a mission looking for a good, traditional recipe.  On closer inspection I realized that EVERY RECIPE ON HERE IS THE SAME!! At least for the anise and other plain-flacored versions on here, the recipe is IDENTICAL in ratio of sugar-flour-butter-egg, etc. The only difference is the size of the batch, ranging from a 12, 6, or 3 egg size, and the amount of flavoring, which varies to taste.  Reviews saying this was the same as the recipe that comes with the pizzelle machine dashed my hopes of a "traditional" recipe, although the one variation I did see was a few (including an old recipe I was given) that left out the baking soda but required the dough to rest.  My impatience always wins! As for the recipe itself, I found it worked quite well.  They turn out crisp and delicious (I use 1T anise extract, 1Tvanilla and 1/2t almond for a 3 egg size batch, which makes about 4 doz) Don't leave your iron while they are cooking!! They brown quickly and the "cook til there's no more steam" rule never worked for me.  They are also rather soft immediately after removing from the iron but crisp up fast so you'll want to lay them flat as soon as possible, preferably on a rack.

1. These cookies are outstanding. This will be my permanent recipe. Adjustments: used real unsalted butter instead of margarine and used vanilla in place of anise (personal taste).
2. I'm not sure about the people who had 'soft' cookies- mine crisped up beautifully. My only idea is to make sure that you use an electic mixer for the eggs and sugar and make sure to beat long enough (when I thought they were 'fluffy' I kept going for a couple of more minutes). I usually skip sifting the flour, but I didn't for this recipe. Definitely sift.
3. The trickiest part for me is always figuring out the right amount of batter and the right cooking time. For my iron, a full tablespoon (measuring spoon) of batter and 1 min 12 seconds made beautiful cookies.
4. There was a little 'overhang' around the edges of some of the cookies- use kitchen shears to cut off any extra to make perfectly round pizzelles.

I made these for Christmas, and they were the best Pizzelles I've ever tasted.  They were light and crispy.  Best of all, they didn't stick to the Pizzelle iron at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were perfect.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is a great recipe with one exception,  YOU MUST USE REAL BUTTER if you want your cookies to crisp.  If you are looking for a fluffier softer cookie margarine is fine but then you will not be able to shape them in to cones, bowls or tubes.

For those having trouble for them crisping, I always use 4 cups of flour, and instead of margarine, 1 cup vegetable oil.  I've never had a problem with them not being crisp and delicate.  Also, if you HATE anise like me, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. lemon extract will do nicely in its stead.

This is an excellent cookie recipe.  It WILL work fine as stated; however, it was just a tad too sweet for me.  I would drop 1/2 c sugar and add a 1/2 tsp anise (my preference).  Also, SIFT the flour before mixing it in.  I had some lumps, and I did have to add 1/4 c water to thin it.  Otherwise, you will be very pleased!!!

I used this recipe to the "T" ... They came out excellent!!  This was my first time making pizzelles and you really have to get a feel for the iron as for the amount you spoon in and the time you leave pressed.  The more I made ... the better they got.  :)

I never understood why anyone would drop $$ to buy a press that only makes a certain type of cookie, until I had the good fortune of trying one. Oh my goodness, just about the best dang cookie I've ever eaten. So good, that I had to go buy one at Bed Bath and Beyond. I do like them better using vanilla in place of the anise though.

Great recipe and nice & crisp!  I, too, used melted butter and feel the anise extract was just the right amount for our taste.  As suggested by another reviewer, I trimmed the edges with kitchen scissors and they are "picture perfect".  After trying other recipes over the past 40 years this will become my standard.

This is almost like my family's recipe, except I used vegetable shortening melted. It gives a more crispy "cookie' than butter. I gave this recipe 4 stars because it had too much baking powder. I made 1/2 batch with 2 tsp. baking powder. I had trouble keeping the cookie thin & crispy. 2nd batch I used 1 tsp. Made for a nice crispy cookie.This is photo with 1/2 the amount of baking powder.

My Mom's favorite recipe.  Came with her "Pizzelle Chef" iron.  She would cut the  BAKING POWDER IN HALF  to make the pizzelle wafer thin and crunchy.  Everyone would rave about her pizzelles because of the thinness!!  She would also add a drop more flavoring.  I always think of her while making these.

These were very light, crisp,  and flavorful. I have a few tips that really helped make my pizzelles a big hit. 1) SIFT flour before you measure it out. 2) Mix eggs and sugar until very light and fluffy. 3) I added 1 1/2 tsp Anise seeds in addition to the stated anise extract.  4) Use butter. They come off the iron soft but as they cool on the rack they crisp up nice. I will definitely make these again. So easy and so yummy.

I made 1/2 recipe only.  I just made this recipe with orange emulsion and they came out delicious.  I used real butter. Got 32 pizzelles. They came out soft, but then they crisped perfectly after placed on cookie rack. ( When they cooled.)  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I thought this was the closest to the recipe I was looking for,which uses a dozen eggs and oil instead of margarine or butter.I  use oil of anise which gives the cookie a stronger anise flavor because the alcohol doesn't burn out as it does with the flavoring.A trick to keeping them crisp is to try not to make them on a rainy or humid day and like my grandmother did,she stored them in a brown paper bag or in a card board box never stored or wrapped air tight.Oh!! Thanks for the great recipe

This is the pizzelle recipe we have been searching for!!!! We are a big Italian family and have grown up making pizzelle's since we were young. Sometimes they'd turn out great, other times they would come out soft (we like them crispy). This recipe is wonderful! I used melted butter and sifted the dry ingred. like others recommended. I used 1/4 c. total of almond & vanilla extracts, and an addt'l 1/4 c. Amaretto. They are fantastic! Thank you all for the great tips..I LOVE this website. The reviews make all the difference in helping to see what helps and what doesn't work. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is the best recipe I have tried. Even better than the "family recipe" passed down in my husbands family! These turned out crisp, and perfect! I did add a bit more Anicon* and a teaspoon of vanilla, but this recipe came out perfect and will be the one I use from now on!

For those of you that can't crisp up the Pizelles. Been making them for 45 years and depending on the humidity, you have a problem.  Too rectify, you can place on a cookie rack in a low temp oven 300 degrees and bake for a few minutes till they are crisp. Then pack in an airtight container.  Also, I use butter that crisps up better than margerine.  This recipe would taste better using one bottle of anise extract or 1/2 tsp. of anise oil.  The extract is not that strong when combined with the above ingredients, but that is a personal flavor choice.  When warm, you can also roll them into a cone shape and fill with pastry creams. smokeygal

I have made numerous pizzelles always searching for the perfect taste...I finally found them.  Excellent and most authentic pizzelle yet.  However, I made a couple of changes...I use butter, I add almond extract and one teaspoon graded orange peel.  They are light and crispy...Mine never turn out soft.

We make these every year and can't make enough. 

Ideas!
you can also add some food coloring to them for the holidays. Also Make sure to sprinkle with Powder sugar. Also try with Vanilla extract or pepermint.

Yay!  I was searching for something that tasted like my Italian Grandmother's recipe.  I made these today as sort of a "test" run.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and they were perfect!!  I am very happy with this recipe and will make again for the holidays.

This is the recipe that came with my mother's pizzelle iron. When she gave it to me, she said "You must use margarine! Butter will make them burn.". Well, I don't generally use margarine to cook with so I use 1/2 butter 1/2 maragine usually and sometimes all butter. Mine always turn out nice and thin and crisp. My Mom and my Aunt asked me "How do you get them so light and crisp!?" I said, "I use butter!" The looks on their faces was too funny! I cool mine on a cookie rack and only stack when they are completely cool. I always make sure my baking powder is fresh and add 1 TBSP of anise seeds along with the extract. The flavor gets stronger as they are stored. We have always stored them in cookie tins with waxed paper on the top and bottom. They last for a very long time like that. My grandmother and mother made hundreds of these for our big Italian family each year for the holidays. Now it's my turn! :)

First time I ever made these and they came out perfect!  I used salted butter as per other reviews and they hardened quite nicely.  I am so pleased.  Recipe yielded 5 dozen pizzelles and a small bag full of edges for on top of the kids ice cream (mine too).  Thank you

This recipe turned out perfect. Just like I was looking for. For those of you whose pizzelles were not crisp, make sure you are using butter and not margarine. Some margarines have alot of water added.

I used two bottles plus another teaspoon or so of anise flavoring, but we like them with a lot of flavor.  This recipe is just like my dad makes.  For Christmas, he puts red and green food coloring in the batter and makes them in those different colors - really pretty.  These also freeze well.

What a fabulous recipe!  I did substitute butter for the margarine, and doubled the amount of vanilla the recipe called for.  I also sifted the flour and baking powder before adding it to the batter.  Great holiday cookies for gift giving!

I haven't yet tried this recipe but plan to.  I believe the correct way to pronounce Pizzelle is "peat sell ease".  My husband is Italian and he loves these cookies with the vanilla flavoring.  I like the anise and the vanilla.  I have never tried any other flavoring.

You have to let pizzelles set over night out before you can store them in a box or Tupperware to get hard if you place them into a container to soon they will never get hard

Great recipe and lovely flavor.  For those who's cookie wont crisp you need to give the cookie more time. I think pizzelles are better eaten the next day.  I place a piece of wax paper between each cookie after they ARE COMPLETELY COOL and then loosely wrap a stack of the cookies in one large piece of wax paper. Meaning they are not totally air tight. The next day the cookies have crisped up just right. Delicous.

Whoaa! My family uses this recipie too :)  Alot of people seem to to be having trouble getting them to crisp up---  the best way is to leave them on racks over night and then wrap stacks of them in wax paper.  you also need to make sure you are using an iron that is thin enough for them. :)

Just by looking at it, it seems really good. I don't have a pizzelle iron though. Would a waffle maker do?

Perfect!  I made some with anise and some with vanilla - both had great texture and taste.  They're even better with a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  Great for cookie exchanges!

I just made these for the first time.  They were perfect! I wanted two different flavors so here is what I did. I waited until the end of completely making the batter before adding the flavor (anise). I split the dough in half. I added 1 tbls of anise extract AND anise seed to one batch and to the other batch I added 1 tbls of almond extract and you know those honey coated almonds that come in a little bag near the bagged salad in produce section of the supermarket? I took about 1/4 of a cup and ground them down a little smaller. I added those to the almond extract batter. Oh wow.  I have two amazing pizzelle batches.

A group of us were giving a bridal shower at school and decided on a sundae bar.  I used my pizzelle maker to create 4 delicious flavors of ice cream bowls, made like waffle cones bowls, creating 105 bowls.  This review is for the ‘Pizzelles II’ – I made them into strawberry flavored cookies/bowls by changing the extract.  The batter for this was quite thin and I had to be very careful when forming the bowls, although the broken ones tasted wonderful.  I also rolled some of them and sprinkled with powdered sugar to use for a Girls Night Out dinner.  They were a hit with that group.  I got 60 cookies from this recipe and it took 40 seconds per batch. The other recipes were:  ‘Italian Pizzelles’  ‘Pizzelles III’ and a personal recipe from ‘What’s for dinner, mom?.'

This was the first time I made pizzelles. Couldn't seem to get the right amount of mixture to put on the pizzelle iron. It would ooze out the sides or there wasn't enough. Hopefully next time I will get it right. I used butter, left out the anise extract & added 3 Tbls. Vanilla extract. The Grandkids & adults all loved them. Next time I will make them using the anise extract. Made about 4 dozen I think, they kept disappearing off the cooling racks. Takes time cooking them but well worth it.

great recipe!  used the suggestions from other people to sift the flour/baking soda.  I also used a plastic bag to squeeze the batter onto the pizzelle iron,  (that worked awesome) It made about 50 cookies.  I did have to add some water because the batter was really thick.  Thanks :)

Followed recipe to a T & they turned out really nice.  I used my medium Pampered Chef scoop & I placed dough slightly above center.  I cooked mine for 1 minute 15 seconds.  They were turning out too dark if I kept them in until there was no more steam.  The texture is crispy, but I live in Western Colorado where the climate is desert so no problems with humidity softening up the cookies.  I am going to make another batch with almond extract.  I got 44 cookies using the medium scoop.

I make these like crazy over the holidays and people can't get enough of them. This recipe is perfect for producing thin, crisp pizzelles. I don't like anise, so I make some using vanilla extract instead of anise.

I use butter, not margarine, and I sift the flour and baking powder together before adding it (1/2 or 1/3 at a time) to the batter. I'm also sure to beat the eggs and sugar till fluffy before adding the dry ingredients. The pizzelles come out thin and crispy every time!

For those of you looking for crisper pizzelles...  Make sure you squeeze your iron all the way and hold shut while they are cooking.  My Grandma likes hers thick and barely even shuts her iron but I like mine crisp so we use two irons while making pizelles, this also makes baking go faster!

I am a first time user with a pizzelle maker, I got a Cuisinart on E Bay really cheap and thought I would start with this recipe. The recipe was so easy, I used butter instead of margargine and vanilla and a little lemon. the only problem was getting used to the parameters of the iron. But I did CHEAT, and use scissors to cut around the edges while they were still warm and this gave them nice crisp edges. I cooled on a cookie rack, the only way to get them perfectly flat and then sprinkled with confectioners sugar. My family loved them and  I really liked the Pizzelle maker. It was easy to use and fun!!! will make them again!
Any ideas for fillings??

Putting  pizzelles into an airtight container will cause them to soften.  Instead, after cooling, try wrapping them in aluminum foil in stacks of 8 or store them in a cookie tin.  Hope this works.

I didn't make these as pizzelles, we don't have a pizzelle iron.  But I did make them in a waffle iron instead.  They were a little heavy (due to the iron), but the flavor was great.  They tasted best fresh, but were good left over, too.

I received a pizzelle iron as a gift. A friend gave me her recipe for pizelles, and hers always get rave reviews. But her recipe requires the batter to chill overnight. I saw this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. A+++++! It was so easy, and my pizzelles turned out perfect! Thanks, Betty!

Absolutely love this recipe! The pizzelli come out nice and crisp. Only substitution I made was to replace anise with vanilla extract. I also sifted the flour. I use two different types of pizzelli irons and to make sure the pizzelles come out thin and crispy, I apply the batter then shut and hold the iron closed for 10 seconds.

Love this recipe!  I make with vanilla & Almond Extract because the kids don't like anise.  Also - I only use real butter.  Margarine will keep them from getting crisp. Keep in a loosly sealed container (tin) to keep crisp (not airtight) I cool these on wax paper directly on the counter and I don't sift flour before adding to the egg/sugar mixture.  Awesome recipe!!!   Thanks!

This is the exact recipe my familt uses when we make pizzelles. We like soft pizzelles and this recipe allows them to stay softer rather than crunchy. My grandmother was the only one who knew how to keep them crunchy because that is her preference. I use melted butter, and a full bottle of anise along with a tsp of anise oil. It sounds like too much, but after they are cooked you will notice how much more flavor they have.

Excellent!  This is the old recipe my family uses also.  However, I add vanilla extract to mine.  It is also easy to replace the anise with any flavor extract for a variety of tastes.  (I use approx the same amount for any extract.)

I lost my grandmother's recipe, and was really skeptical about someone else's recipe, but this one is spectacular.  Stays true to the italian pizzelle flavor, and I wouldn't change a thing!

I made a variation by substituting cornmeal for the flour and adding chopped jalapeños. Then sandwich 2 pizzelles with cream cheese between. Yum!

I, too, used butter. Also used vanilla extract instead of anise, and 3 tsp. cinnamon to make cinnamon pizelles. Only took 25 seconds to cook on pizelle maker. Cut immediately with pizza cutter into fourths. Then onto cooling racks. Will dip edges into chocolate and crushed candy cane.  They turned out perfect..

This is a fantastic recipe.  Turned out very well for me.  Some reviewers remarked that they could not get their cookies to crisp up.... one possibility is that they did not bake them long enough in their pizzelle maker. It seems I always have to relearn just how long to cook them.  Experiment with varying amounts of time and you will probably find success.

I work at a private community hall as the manager and I made these with vanilla instead of anise and asked a hall full of people to try one and give me any feedback it was all positive no negative comments at all thanks for the recipe tastes just like my childhood at my italian grandmothers house.

Definitely not enough Anise flavoring... I ended up adding the folowing : 2 additl tblspns of Anise 1 tblspn of Vanilla Extract 1 teaspon of Cinnammon  and I still feel like something was missing. I did sift the flour with the baking powder and they got nice and crispy. I'll probably use this recipe again in the future, but I'm open to suggestions on additional ingredients to try. It was definitely missing something!

Perfect! I do used butter, and to those that had trouble with the cookies not getting crisp: I noticed that a lot of us that had good results mentioned that we use butter. I'm not sure if that's the problem, but it's something you could try. I also opt for the vanilla to the anise (substitute in equal amounts) and feel free to try different flavors that you like (e.g, lemon, orange, etc.).

Great recipe! I used butter instead of margarine, and added anise seeds (2 and 1/2 teaspoons)to the batter. They turned out great, light and crispy. I noticed others had trouble with them crisping up, and that could be caused by using margarine that has a high percentage of water in it. I have never tried it with margarine, as I am very happy using butter instead.

His grandmother making pizzelles at the holidays is one of the favorite memories of my Italian-born husband.  So when I made these, and just the smell brought a tear to his eye, I knew they were authentic.  And they do taste great. I did need to thin the batter with a little water though. Also, I used butter instead of margarine.

I love this recipe, I make it every year for Christmas.  Instead of just anise extract, I use 1 tsp of anise extract and 3 drams of Anise oil because my family likes more of the anise flavor.

I got this exact recipe from my sister-in-law a number of years ago and it's a must have each Christmas.  I suppose it depends on the iron but I think 90 seconds is way too long.  I generally don't need over 30 - 45 seconds with mine.  For a change of pace, you can substitute vanilla for the anise, or even some lemon extract.   I find that with the lemon extract, I need more than the 2 Tbsp., about 3 Tbsp. actually.

I use butter, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. They come out crispy and stay crispy, whether I cook them until they’re golden or not. I actually prefer them soft, maybe they’re soft with margarine? They roll up perfectly and you can use any filling you like.

I read all the comments before making as this was my first time making Pizzelle's, very helpful tips. 

We used butter, melted and cooled. We also sifted the dry ingredients as suggested. 

These turned out great! I layed them on paper towel, as someone mentioned, and let them cool completely before putting into containers. 

These were made on my electric Krumkaka Baker.

I played around at the end and left some on longer for a more brown, crispy cookie (my personal favorite). 

Can't wait to try other flavors like orange or lemon zest, among other great ideas I've read. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This is my favorite pizzelles recipe. The only thing I do differently is I add 1tsp vanilla and I only use butter in this recipe for a very delicious cookie!

You can make make soft fluffier Pizzelles by leaving the wire at the end of you pizzelle maker off as they cook. For traditional thin crispy pizzelles put dough on hot press and latch the handles together with the wire.

Did the recipe exactly like it was written in my stand up mixer except I used real butter, and they came out perfectly.  Crunchy, great taste!

Just like Nonnie made, using a coal stove and two hand held irons.  No modifications since it was identical to her recipe in proportions.  35 seconds is perfect with my iron..

I made this exactly like the recipe but with vanilla as I did not have anise. I did, however, resize the recipe to 10 servings knowing that what they call 18 servings is like 60 cookies.  Excellent recipe as written and all the variations I could come up with make me want to open a pizzelle store. ;)  Think.. you could do chocolate, hazelnut, peppermint for the holidays, cinnamon and the list goes on. Thank you for this easy recipe! Mine were crisp and perfect. I used real salted butter. I did not sift the flour but did use bread flour.

If you sift it will work. Sift the flour into this and mixture and your will get crisp pizzelles . Unsifted flour is  about a 1/2 of a cup more than you need. Sifting allows a fluffly texture.

I found that I needed to add 1 more egg and a tablespoon of water to make the batter thinner. This made them crisper. The recipe was good otherwise and the cookies were delicious.

Great recipe! Didn't have the recipe book that came with our iron, and found a few on here. But this seemed like the best. Very tasty...the family ate them all up so quickly! 

One change: Added some vanilla as the anise was not enough. Also didn't have baking powder, and added 3/4 a teaspoon of baking soda. They are definitely thicker and fluffier than the recipe I'm used to, even with pushing the iron all the way down.

This was the first time I have made pizzelles.   The flavor was spot on but I  watered down the batter as was suggested by another reviewer.  Original recipe was too thick and gave more of a waffle appearance.  Once batter was watered down it was perfect.  I did take someone elses suggestion to also crisp them up in the oven.  Some of mine were on the soft side.  Over all I would use recipe again.

Even with sifted flour, had to add about an extra 1/3-1/2 cup to get dough dense enough not to stick to my iron. Also, used butter ISO margarine. Otherwise, this recipe has produced the best I've made so far.

This seems to be a pretty common basic recipe for Pizelles.  I don't think I've ever had them before, but recently received an iron to make them so thought I would try.   Took a few tries to determine how long to cook.   Following the recipe exactly, I needed to thin it up a little to get crispy cookies.

The only thing I did was I didn't use too much dough and I pressed the handles together as they cooked/baked.  They came out crispy and not too anisey which was good. The only other thing I can suggest is if there are edges oozing out just move them over with the spatula and squeeze the handles together , this way you don't have to be cutting them off, etc.

This is the recipe I use but without the baking powder. It isn't really necessary. Also, for those whose cookies are coming out soft, it may be your iron. Those plastic ones are pretty much  and don't close tightly enough to get them to the correct thinness and crispness. Do yourself a favor and invest in a metal iron. They can be pricey but are totally worth it.

Very good.  It took me a bit to learn how to not make them too large.  They didn't roll very well, but they more than pass the taste test of the resident Italians.  I would definitely make them again, and maybe even play with different extracts for fun.

I had made pizzelles as a part of our Christmas cookie tradition since I was a little boy, and for the last few years we have been without a pizzelle maker. We finally got another iron this year and we did not have our recipe, as it was on the box of the old iron. This recipe is the exact one we have used for years and works beautifully for Americanized (replaced the anise with vanilla) pizzelles. cant wait to experiment with flavorings like I used to do. this recipe does not get crunchy at all, pizzelles made with this are light and almost flaky when done, just the way they should be. Thanks again for the recipe!

Another variation of this recipe is for Chocolate Pizzelles by simply adding: 1/2 c cocoa, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 tsp baking powder. Sift these 3 ingredients together and add to recipe. 

Makes about 60 pizzelles. You can also roll these to fill with dessert fillings of your choosing.

Awesome and so easy!  These are my husband's favorite but I've never made them until this weekend.  I was a little worried that 2 tablespoons of anise extract was A LOT but they turned out GREAT!  Thin, crisp, and really tasty!

I used vanilla instead of anise. Yield depends on the diameter and thickness of your pizzeles.  I found if I used the batter just after mixing it together (more room temp) I got thinner pizzelles and if I refrigerated the dough first, they were slightly thicker.  Love this, tastes like Christmas at my Grandma Benedetti's house.

If your cookies will not harden or crisp up, try storing the cookies in just a brown paper bag. My family makes these cookies every year and always store them in a paper bag and they always crisp up.

Same as my family recipe... I like to flavor mine with single malt scotch and ground walnuts... If you dip them in the powdered sugar before they are cool, they can get soggy.. Also some margarine works better (name-brand) than others.

Excellent recipe.  I made two batches substituting vanilla extract for the anise in one and lemon extract for anise in the other.  As other reviewers suggested, I sifted my dry ingredients.  I shaped some of the warm pizzelles around a small wood cylinder to freeze and pipe with filling for future use and I shaped a few others around a small bowl to be used as dessert cups for later use.  I cooled these all on a wire rack and they were perfectly crispy.

I used butter instead of margarine and sifted the flour very well. My pizzelles were still very thick and gummy. I added a half stick soften butter to the dough- blended well... still too thick. I added about TBSP vegetable oil... then poured in some more sugar hoping it would caramelize a little. Oh yes, and about a TBSP vanilla extract. Still too thick. Finally I poured in 1/4 cup warm water. I realized at this point I was fooling with it too much. I finished off the whole batch, allowing them to brown more than I initially wanted hoping it would help crisp. In the end, I got pizelles that are about twice as thick as needed, only slightly crisp, but nice tasting.

This is a classic recipe. I would definitely use real butter instead of margarine, but otherwise follow the recipe and you can't go wrong. I'm not sure why people are having trouble getting them to crisp up. Mine are fully crisp about 1 minute after removing them from the Pizelle oven. I just cut the recipe in half when I want a smaller batch.

My only complaint is that this recipe made way more cookies than I had anticipated. 18 servings? Only if a serving is five cookies each. Otherwise, this recipe rocks.

Didn't have any anise extract. So I used half vanilla, half almond, and a small dash of lemon extracts. They crisped up beautifully and mighty tasty!

This was excellent!  nice flavor, and was nice and crisp.  worth making again, but like some other reviews, and going to put anise oil in it too.

This recipe was great. We have been looking for the perfect pizzelle and we have finally found it. Followed the recipe exactly.  Did take the advice about sifting the flour and baking powder. Worked wonderfully.  Thank you.
