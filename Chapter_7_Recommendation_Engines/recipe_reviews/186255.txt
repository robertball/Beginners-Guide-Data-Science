I took the chance with no reviews and made this for my Sunday school class. I did mess up and bought strawberry filled crepes instead of cheese filled but these still turned out delicious. Two others asked for the recipe. All in all a huge hit.

I made this for a house full of guests one morning. Everyone raved! The two year olds wanted more more. It was easy and delicious. My only problem was finding a store that carried cheese blintzes in our vacation community.

This is a delicious recipe that lends itself to many personal variations. For example, I used cherry blintzes, and substituted low fat sour cream and sweetener. The only change I really had to make was decreasing the baking time. In a convection oven the dish was definitely ready by 30 minutes. I would recommend anyone trying this recipe for the first time to watch the oven. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will incorporate into my Sunday breakfast menu.

FF Sour Cream works fine, too. If you can't find cheese blintzes you can substitute any other flavor.  Or, in a pinch, if you can't find ANY blintzes, use a can of pie filling underneath the souffle mixture. Then, you'll need a spoon to dish it up-it'll be rather sloppy yet tasty.

I served mine with heated blueberry pie filling on the side- yum! This is even better than my mother-in-law's recipe, but I'd call it Cheese Blintz Souffl√©. 

I did find that there was some extra liquid in the bottom of the dish. My understanding is to use the blintzes frozen. Perhaps I'll try to thaw them next time and see if that makes a difference. If anyone has any ideas, please comment. 

(Hint- check the International section of your store's freezers. That's where I find them. But cheese are popular; I got the last two while there were lots of fruit filled ones left.)

This recipe is wonderful!  I will definitely make it again!  I couldn't find cheese blintzes, but maybe I looked in the wrong spot.  Anyway, I used crescent rolls from a can, made them into rectangles, added a cream cheese and sugar mixture, rolled then up and put the into the oven to begin cooking while I worked on the souffle part.  Then I added the egg mixture and followed the recipe as given.  My brunch guests and I were very happy with this one!  I can see that this recipe would work well with lots of flavor variations!  Thanks for the great recipe!
