Excellent hot fudge sauce. I used evaporated milk and pure vanilla extract. One of the best I've made yet.

Terrific thick hot fudge sauce! Ridiculously easy, you'd never guess marshmallows were the secret ingredient. I followed the recipe exactly, except I made half a recipe, which was plenty. Seems very adaptable - a keeper recipe!

Very easy hot fudge sauce - used it to top off snow icecream. I grabbed an opened bag of mini marshmallows, melted them with the butter and a mixture of heavy cream and skim milk. Stirred in bag of chocolate chips and serious splash of vanilla and a little salt.  We had thick creamy hot fudge sauce on our ice cream. Use a few less marshmallows or dark chocolate chips for a not as sweet sauce. Yummm!!!

Absolutely delicious and oh! so! easy!  Excellent!  I made half a batch, and that's probably a good thing!  I had to finish rounding out my depleted supply of semisweet chips with milk chocolate, but I'm sure that didn't make any difference!  Very delicious!

Put it on chocolate cake and ice cream. This was excellent. We only had mini marshmallows, so did 3 1/2 cup minis. Followed the recipe the rest of the way.

So yummy and creamy. I substituted cream for half of the milk and used half milk chocolate chips and half semi-sweet chips.

A great way to use those half dry marshmallows!  This sauce is easy, very adaptable, and oh so good on strawberry ice cream!  I also had some unsweetened chocolate squares which I melted in with this recipe.

I have made this several times, but I always use the 7-ounce jar of marshmallow creme instead of the marshmallows. It keeps nearly forever in the refrigerator, and it makes a great gift.

Easy and good. I used dark chocolate chips. Tasted more "fudge'y" that way.

absolutely delicious!!! I made the recipe exactly as stated, but had to give it 4 stars because I had to add more milk as it was way to thick. I probably added another 1/4 - 1/3 cup more of milk.

This was very easy.  I decided to see if it would work in my high speed blender, (Blendtec)  I let the ingredients come up to room temperature and put the milk in first, I cut the marshmallows in half, probably not necessary, added butter, salt and vanilla.  Then I used "soup" to heat it up, then added the chips.  I used 65% dark chocolate, which for my taste, I'd rather maybe have milk chocolate.  It came out beautifully smooth and I refrigerated for a couple hours and took a spoonful of peanut butter and a spoonful of fudge, tasty!  This is really a quick method.  Also I decided to put a scoop of gelatin powder into the milk, let it bloom first, I wanted it thick.  So I don't know how it would be without that extra, but it should set up fine from reading other chocolate sauce recipes using a high powered blender.  Haven't tried warming it for pouring, cold spoonful's are good snacks.

This was a disaster.   It turned out "greasy" and since I was making it for company,  I had to quickly look for another recipe and start all over.

Delicious hot fudge sauce. Followed recipe exactly except added 1/8 tsp espresso powder to pot when the marshmallows were melted. Was a little too sweet for my taste.Next time would use a few less marshmallows.

This is very easy to make!  I made this recipe in order to use up a partial bag of older, sticking-together marshmallows.  It turned out great! I will definitely make this again.  This sauce is very rich, even for me, an avid chocolate lover.  So a little goes a long way, especially on chocolate ice cream!
