After reading the other reviewss I was skeptical about trying to make it. The recipe was quite tiresome to make but when it was done didn't care for it at all. I didn't like the lack of brown sugar and it was just to burdensome to make. To any of thoughs who are going to make this recipe GOOD LUCK

This was the worst cake I ever made.  It was time consuming and difficult.  The eggs, butter, flour mixture was as sticky as tar making the whipped egg white fold very difficult and time consuming.  Not to mention the awful sugar melting in the beginning!  The end result was dry and dense.

Was my first attempt at a pineapple upside-down cake, and I think I did alright.  The only thing I couldn't swing was melting the sugar.  Everytime I got it to melt and tried to transfer the mixture to the 13x9, I ended up with a saucepan full of hard toffee.  I think I need a little more practice in the baking arena!!  I opted to mix brown sugar and butter and layer that in the bottom instead.  My grandfather loved it after all!!

Too time consuming. My family did not like this recipe at all.  Too eggy. The two mixtures were too difficult to fold in together.  I prefer brown sugar over melting the white sugar.  This not a good recipe in my opinion.

There should be a negative star rating. Iâ€™ve been baking since I was 9 years old and this is the most screwed up recipe I have ever attempted. It was a massive failure! I wish I had read the reviews before I attempted it... I will from not make that mistake again! I usually have great luck with the recipes from AllRecipes but, this one should be removed from the site.
