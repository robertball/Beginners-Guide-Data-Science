Way to go SUNKIST2, a delicious recipe.  I made this exactly as directed, prep was easy and everything came together nice for a great meal. The sauce was perfect and the ribs were nice and moist.  We will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is flavorful and easy.  Have made this several times no changes to the recipe.  To make it even easier You don’t need to brown the ribs. Just put everything in the slow cooker and let it go.  Family favorite!

This is the first time I’ve ever tried cooking ribs and this recipe is GREAT! We used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of one cup and we cooked them for closer to 12 hours. I will absolutely use this recipe again for ribs, and will likely use this marinade for chicken or pork in the future. Thanks!

These turned out great!!  I didn't have white wine so I used white grape juice instead.  I also skipped the Chinese spice because I couldn't find it.  But they were still delicious!  This will be a go-to recipe for our family, for sure.

This was DELICIOUS!!!  Made it EXACTLY as directed in the original recipe.  Super easy.  I just put the ribs directly in the slow cooker with baking to make it even easier.  Came home from work 8hrs later & the house smelled fabulous.  Made some rice & spooned the extra sauce over.  No leftovers—too yummy!!  Will definately make this again—a Sunday dinner worthy meal easy enough for a work night!

Flavor was good but the ribs themselves were fatty, I may try again with a leaner cut.

The flavor was delicious. However, next time I will use a bit less sugar. It was very sweet.
