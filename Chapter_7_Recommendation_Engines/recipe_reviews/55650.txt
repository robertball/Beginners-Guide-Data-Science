I made this without mushrooms because I didn't have any. I added a splash of red wine, some (preheated) Trader Joe's green beans (long and skinny) and a pinch of Italian seasoning instead of Rosemary. It was wonderful served with homeade mashed potatoes and "Jiffy" brand cornbread. I used both thighs and boneless skinless breast. My husband raved about this meal!

This recipe is wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was to add cream of tomato soup, and I served it with white rice instead of polenta.  My guests raved about it.

I don't like polenta so I served this over pasta.  It was ok.  The rosemary was overpowering.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so i used canned.  I won't try again.

The first time I made this I needed a quick meal and made the sauce just as instructed. I thought it tasted "thin." Then next time I simmered the sauce much longer, and hour or more, before adding the chicken. It was much better with longer simmering. And of course the day after it was even better, so now I double the recipe and plan leftovers.

Good recipe.  I added green pepper and a little cooking sherry, and threw everything in my slow cooker.  Also added some oregano, and used boneless, skinless individually frozen breasts.  Omitted the diced tomatoes and the polenta.  Easy and came out great.  Good over rice.

Only made the cacciatore portion of this recipe, but my entire family gobbled it totally up.  Very flavorful and easy.

This was pretty good, however I would recommend simmering it slightly longer than the recipe requires.  I prefer my chicken cacciatore to fall off the bone, but that's just my preference.

Great tasting dish! I used fresh tomatoes, added oregano and marinated the thighs in white wine, olive oil, rosemary, garlic and oregano for 2 hours before I browned them. Also, I served it over parsley rice instead of the polenta.  My family loved it!

This was very good without being amazing. A good 'stick to your bones' hot meal for a cold day. I ended up with way too many vegtables in the sauce, and while they were tasty, I still think I'll cut the vegtable portion in half next time I make this.
