Made for Recipe Group. Hubby liked it. The sauce was good, I think it may have cooked down a little too much, we like a little more. I used beef broth instead of water. The pasta absorbed a lot of the liquid, I don't think I would cook it as long before putting everything together to bake the next time. I have never used mostaccioli before, and thought it was really pasty once the dish was done. This may have been because you put them in uncooked first. Otherwise a good dish!

Recipe Group Selection:  16, November 2013 ~ This is a very good pasta dish that is a little time consuming.  I used a half pound of ground beef and a half pound of Italian sausage.  The flavor was very good, but the bake time was off in my oven. After 20 minutes the pasta was no where near ready for the final 10 minutes baking. I continued to bake for 15 minutes before adding the mozzarella and then baked for 15 more minutes.  The finished product was very good and it serves a lot! Leftovers were very good warmed up the next day.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and my guests loved it. I did substitute half of the ground beef with Italian sausage.

I halved this recipe, but otherwise made it exactly according to the recipe.  Perhaps it was due to my reducing the ingredients to half, but this turned out extremely dry for me and with not quite as much flavor as I was wanting and anticipating.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, matmyers!EDIT:  I forgot to add that like another reviewer, the pasta needed an additional 15 min. of bake time before adding the last layer of cheese and baking for the last 10 min.  If I were to make this recipe again, I think I will precook my noodles and then proceed with the recipe.  Thanks!

I had to use high protein elbow macaroni, but it worked great. I did add some fennel because we like it, but I think it would have been good "as is". We loved it, and we served guests and they loved it as well!

This is some kind of YUM!!!  I make it as written but can see so many other variations: substitute beef for lamb or Italian sausage or ground pork...  Use different cheeses, add eggplant or spinach or whatever. I'm going to let my creativity take control.
