I made these for a recent camping trip, to rave reviews from the family (although they laughed at me for "going to the trouble" -but it really wasn't any trouble :-)

I used rosemary skewers from the garden, and brushed it all with a garlic infused olive oil before grilling.  I also forgot the pesto, but just happened to have some fresh basil (see why they laugh at me...)so just made a simple vinaigrette and sprinkled fresh basil over the top.

I was unable to find a local suppy of the seasoned skewers, so I made do by soaking regular bamboo skewers, then rubbing each well with a clove of garlic.  My peppers were red and green and I used mini mozzarella balls from the farmer's market and my own homemade bread.  This was a pretty presentation.  Next time I think I would simply brush the skewers with garlic infused oil.

Loved this salad.  Didn't use the special skewers but it still was great.  Made it while camping over an open fire.  Will make again!

I made this for ***Recipe Group***.  The grilled vegetables were very good.  I made garlic infused olive oil since I couldn't find any of the specified skewers.  My personal taste preference is to have just the skewer of veggies with no lettuce or mozzarella.

I made this for the Recipe Group and I was not able to find the skewers called for in this recipe, so I had to use regular wooden skewers which I soaked in water. Having said that, these were very good! I could not bring myself to spend $5.29 per pound for red and yellow peppers, so I just went with green peppers. When I seasoned them with the salt and pepper, I also sprinkled on some garlic powder to make up for not having the garlic seasoned sticks...that seemed to work out well. I served them on a platter, omitting the romaine, drizzled with pesto and placed mini mozzarella balls around. Hubby and I both agreed that these were very tasty! I could definately see myself making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used regular skewers soaked and I heated olive oil and garlic together to infuse them I also left out the bell peppers and skewered red onion in place and used the warm infused garlic oil brushed on the skewers while cooking on the grill.  served as an appetizer delicious

Everything I hoped it would be!!  This was awesome; I loved the flavor the grill imparted to the bread cubes and veggies.  I made a few changes; I added red onion chunks to the skewers (cuz I love them) and only grilled them about 2 minutes per side--the bread blackens quickly, even on low heat.  Also, instead of making the basil pesto, I used Argentine chimichurri because I'd made some the day before and needed to use it up.  Argentine food has so much Italian influence, I knew the flavors would be perfect together and they were!  I know this is a big change, since the pesto surely gives the dish a very different flavor, but I am sure the pesto will be equally delicious and look forward to making it again soon.  Thanks!
