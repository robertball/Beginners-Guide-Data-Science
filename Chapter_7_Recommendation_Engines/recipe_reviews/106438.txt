All the flavors of fall come together in this bite-sized little treat that's nicely spiced with the perfect amount of sweetness! These baked up beautifully in no time at all. The kitchen smelled wonderful which was an indicator that these would taste delicious. I opted to use half white Splenda and half brown sugar Splenda and added a generous splash of vanilla. I thew the apple in my mini-food processor vs. grating. You can easily sub nuts or dried cranberries for the raisins. Perfect with a piping hot cup of tea!

These are a very nice little muffin. Like others have suggested a bit of allspice would have helped round them out.

These smelled AMAZING while they were baking! I was a little concered because the wet ingredients had a rather lumpy texture, but once the dry ingredients were added in, the batter became nice and smooth. I ended up making 12 regular sized muffins instead of 36 mini muffins. I increased the baking time to 20 minutes and lowered the temp to 350. They were a bit more crumbly than I would have liked, but still very good. If I make them again I will add some allspice as someone else suggested and more apple. I brought them to work and they were well received.

These are very tasty little muffins! I simplified the direction and also made some adjustments. I added a splash of vanilla extract and a pinch of ground cloves. I used Splenda brown sugar blend instead of the plain granulated sweetener. And to make the directions easier I just mixed all the dry ingredients together in one bowl. Then in a separate bowl I mixed together all the wet ingredients. Then I added the wet to the dry and mixed until well combined. I used mini cupcake liners and scooped the batter to the top of each with a melon baller. Then baked as stated. These had a nice fresh apple taste but I would decrease the amount of lemon zest next time to half. These muffins taste much better when they're cold! A very nice muffin recipe. Perfect with a cup of coffee or tea. Thanks Splenda!

We enjoyed these, just sweet enough.  I think they could have benefited from a little allspice and brown sugar Splenda blend for some of the sugar, but overall they were very enjoyable!

I thought these were just ok. They should have tasted better for all the work that went into them.

These muffins were very nice. They're a bit sweet, a bit dense and nicely satisfying. I didn't miss the sugar and my family didn't suspect a thing!

Great combination of flavors.  The oats, molasses and apples tasted yummy together.

3 20 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/106438/miniature-apple-muffins/ ...  I changed things, but not enough to make this review invalid.  I added 1/2t allspice & 1/4t ground cloves; 1/2t vanilla.  'Soaked the oats in the apple juice, which was 3/8c & added 2T olive oil.  'Didn't add the apple.  'Want to wait until I know the base is good before;  crazy, yeah, I know.  This didn't have any flavor.  I don't understand.  Does the apple provide that big of a difference  It should still taste apple-spicey.  Very disappointed.

Will make again!  Instead of apples I added a cup of blueberries.  I also added 1/2 c  dried cranberries sweetened with apple juice concentrate instead of raisins.   I used orange zest instead of lemon and added orange essential oil and cinnamon essential oil to boost the health benefits.  The options are endless.  So yummy!
