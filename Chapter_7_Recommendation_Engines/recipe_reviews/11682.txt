Delicious! I made this vegetarian without the prosciutto and it was terrific.  Before I set up all the incredients in the saucepan, however, I sauteed a whole red onion in about 1 T salted butter.  Then I deglazed the pan with the vodka and added all the other ingredients.  A few other changes: I replaced the fresh parsley with fresh basil and replaced the garlic powder with an equal amount of fresh minced garlic.  I also added about 2 1/2 cups diced baby portobello mushrooms.  I followed some other reviewers' suggestion and only added 1/2 c grated Romano cheese because I didn't want the flavor to overpower the rest of the sauce.  Next time I think I will just add a pinch of black pepper (even at 1/8 t it was too much) and maybe double the amount of red pepper flakes.  This fed two very hungry souls, with seconds for each of them, and then there was still about half left to freeze.  Thanks for a great recipe! Everyone requests this when they're coming over for dinner!

I am a BRAND NEW COOK who just discovered this site and this was the very first recipe I decided to try (I have always enjoyed Penne a la Vodka in restaurants).

I am GLAD I DID because it was so EASY and came out so YUMMY!!!  I had it with some friends and neighbors and it got great reviews by all!

I LOVE THIS SAUCE!!!  It froze well and then it tasted EVEN BETTER THE NEXT TIME I REHEATED IT!

Thanks you so much, Angela, for sharing this easy and sumptious recipe.  It was the perfect recipe for this beginning cook and I look forward to enjoying many more new recipes.

TRY THIS ONE!  It is RICH and HEAVENLY!  ENJOY!

I have been looking for a great alla vodka recipe.  I have finally found it.  I made a few changes.  I left out the proscuitto and the peas and used 3 - 4 fresh cloves of garlic instead of the powder.  If I don't have fresh parsley. I use dried.  Good Luck.  Life is short so eat drink and be merry!!

I have made this recipe for years, love it every time!  I dice the roasted pepper, just a personal preference.  The prosciutto definitely makes the dish.  Tried to sub 1/2 and 1/2 for cream last time, didn't come out as good - stick with the cream - it's worth it!!

Tasty sauce.  I forgot to add the Parmasean cheese which made the sauce a bit thin but still delicious.

This was a wonderful dish!  I added fresh garlic and left out the roasted peppers and it was just marvelous.  My boyfriend almost ate a pound of rigatoni!!!

This is an awesome recipe!  I did not use the peppers, and made a few other changes.  Instead, I just used red cayenne pepper, fresh garlic, chopped onions, turkey sausage, and pureed tomatoes.  It was absolutely delicious - a big hit in my family.  Try it!

I was so impressed with this recipe. It was a breeze to put together and the outcome was so good. My husband and I thought this was one of the better pasta dishes we have had in a long time. The only thing I did differently was I added more peas than the recipe called for and extra crushed red pepper because we like more heat, but other than that, we followed the recipe. We will make this a staple in our house. Thank you for the great recipe, Angchick!

Tasty but a lot of work for the results. The proscuitto is what makes this dish! We dropped the tomatoes and spices and used a jar of favorite tomato sauce, then added the cream, vodka, proscuitto, crushed red pepper flakes & cheese. Better!!! You don't really need the vodka and the peas add color but nothing to the flavor. As someone suggested, you can make this with fat free half & half, too. I have done this; tastes good but the sauce is not quite as thick.

This was fantastic!  Hubby and I could not resist eating a second helping.  It tasted very authentic although I felt it had a little too much garlic and would probably use half the amount next time.

MMMMMMM!!! This pasta was FANTASTIC! I didn't have any prosciutto on hand, so I substituted with  ground beef, I used 2 cloves fresh garlic instead of the powder, spaghetti instead of rigatoni and a can of basil-oregano diced tomatoes. I also omitted the peas and red peppers. My boyfriend couldn't stop complimenting on the dish, I am sure I'll be getting the request for an encore soon :)  Thanks for sharing, it's a keeper!

Replace 1/2 of the cream with low sodium chicken broth to reduce fat; amazingly good! Subbed Sweet Italian Sausage-Johnsonvile brand for proscuitto.  Brown whole sausage in skillet turning frequently.  Remove, slice in 1/4 in. slices, return to skillet, continue to brown.  Then, place in collander to rinse under cool running water to remove as much fat as possible. Add browned sausage to sauce & simmer a short while; ladle over pasta for serving.

Super easy recipe that is so delicious! My 4 year old even gobbles it up! I have made this recipe for a few years now, and everyone who has had it thinks I slaved over the stove for days. I have always omitted the crushed red pepper flakes and the peas, but that is just a taste preference. I will be making this recipe for years to come!

This sauce was so tasty I could hardly stop helping myself to it as it was cooking!

Things I changed....didn't have any vodka, so I substituted a dry white wine - maybe 4 oz. Used dried parsley and dried chopped garlic.

It was good as leftovers, but I didn't find it outstanding, as I thought when it was fresh. 

I think next time I'll leave out the proscuitto. Maybe it's because I'm a novice, but it got rather dried out while the sauce was simmering and didn't seem to add much value.

I have made this recipe, exactly as directed, on many occasions often when we have dinner guests.  I serve it with home made baguettes followed by a light dessert.  A simple meal which everyone loves, and most have second and even third helpings.

Everyone Ive cooked this for really likes it.  I usually substitute ham for prosciutto because the prosciutto is a bit pricey and its still good.

Excellent, but of course, I altered the recipe and reduced the cream to 1 cup since I prefer a more tomato-y sauce than creamy sauce. Will definitely make again.

Fantastic!  I love this recipe!  I made this last night for my Mother-in-law for her birthday and it turned out beautifully.  I omitted the peas, I don't like them too much and they weren't missed.  I served it with fresh garlic bread and caesar salad, perfect dish for entertaining!  Thanks for a good one!

All-in-all I was pretty unimpressed with how this recipe turned out.  It was incredibly sweet...something I was NOT expecting.  I don't know...I just thought it had a weird flavor.  It wasn't completely unedible (in fact, my roomate liked it alot)...it's just not "my thing".  Probably not a helpful review, but my review none-the-less!!

Wow-wee! This was AWESOME! I messed up and put the cheese in at the beginning, but it made no difference, it was still great. And I used another posters tip and sliced up some fresh garlic instead of using the garlic powder. I served this to my father-in-law who is a chef (try not being self conscious about your cooking when you're serving a professional!)and he gave many a compliment and said he would serve it in his restaurant. Angela thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe.  Easy to prepare.  The sauce tastes wonderful.  I left out the peas and added mushrooms.  I'm not a fan of parmesan cheese so I left it out completely and the dish still tastes great.  My friends loved it!

We loved this, it was something different than regular old spaghetti sauce but still simple and fairly quick to throw together! I did puree the red peppers in my food processor instead.

Delicious.  I didn't use prosciutto, but did serve with Italian sausage.  Also, I used fresh garlic instead of dried.  The second time I made this dish I forgot to put the Parmesan in and it still tasted great.

Great recipe.  Fast easy and tasty.  I substituted shrimp for the proscuitto.  Not quite as much zing but I added some fresh basil to compensate.

I have been making this recipe for about 2 years or more now.  It is a hit every single time.  I usually add more of the meat to it (about 1/2).  Truly a classic and excellent, unique dish!!!!

I skipped the prosciutto and the peas and it was still great!  Very easy to make - one of my favorite standby recipes.  Goes great with cheesy garlic biscuits on the side.

VERY VERY GOOD. I had the girlfriend's famly over for lunch and I had to impress and I decided to go with this one. Thank God I did! It was awesome. Everybody raved about it. I used tri-color rotini just to make it colorful and I skipped the peas, and it was great. My eight year old couldn't get enough of it. She had it for lunch AND dinner that day.

This was very good. I used fat free half&half instead of cream. Worked well. I also did not have vodka, used Gin, instead and really couldn't taste it. I think you could probably do without if didn't have any. I did use the peas, but next time may use spinach instead. I do think this would be wonderful with shrimp. But do agree with others. Does not make 8 servings.

Loved the pasta. The sauce was so creamy and rich that everyone liked it. Even though it was creamy, the sauce was not too heavy but just right. Best Vodka Rigatoni recipe ever and would recommened this recipe to anyone who likes pasta with Vodka sauce! Great stuff!!!

Wonderful tomato-based sauce with a light, creamy texture.  Does take a lot of work to make, however.  I'll reserve this for special occasions.

I omitted the roasted peppers and used pancetta instead of prosciutto.  The peas were also a good addition.  I cooked this recipe for my 5 housemates and they were going nuts.  As was I; this is probably the best vodka sauce i've ever made. Oh yeah!!

It's ok, but missing something...maybe sun dried tomatoes? Maybe more garlic?  Fresh or roasted garlic? Something just wasn't 100% satisfying about this dish.

Excellent recipe! Very tasty sauce recipe that brought back the memories when I used to eat Vodka Rigatoni at an Italian restaurant in New Jersey. My girlfriend raved about it so much that both she and I finished everything and didn't leave a drop of sauce on the saucepan. Keep up the good work and please post more super duper pasta sauce recipes!

Maybe it was the red peppers, I used, but I didn't add any sugar either, and it still seemed too sweet. Also, the red peppers seemed overpowering, but it smelled wonderful.

A good recipe. I prefer the other vodka sauces that's on this website. Next time I make this, i'll reduce the amount of cream. It diluted the taste of the other ingredients. (besides, it's always easier to add more cream than take it out.) We also added more vodka (yum!) and black pepper to give it a bit more depth of flavor.

Wow, this is the first of several dozen recipes that I've awarded a 5-star rating to.
It was a bit of work for a beginning cook, but well worth it (it made 3 meals for me). Two quibbles: I didn't really taste the vodka so maybe it might just as well not have been there; and the peas seemed to be an odd addition to the dish (they tasted good, but just seemed out of place). But the tomato-cream sauce with a quarter-pound of prosciutto was fabulous. I'll be making this for The Woman I Love soon.

This was absolutely delicious.  I left out the procuitto, peas, and roasted red peppers and added shrimp during the last few minutes of cook time.  Very easy to make and tastes FABULOUS.  If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.

I took this to a party as an appetizer. The group are all cooks and very picky.  THEY LOVED IT!  I didn't put the peas in.  I'd say this cost about $20.  (so 2.00 a piece for 8 - we had 10 and because it was so good it was all gone as an appetizer).  I'm very picky.  This is good.  I'd use it as an appetizer (first course - which I will do for New Years Eve) before a big meal. P.S if this was the main course this would NEVER feed 8.  Maybe 6 people and all my friends work out.

This was very good. Even my 21 month old had three helpings. I didn't use the crushed red pepper and halfed the roasted red pepppers because of my kids. The only thing I might change next time is to half the sugar because it was a little sweet for my taste but my husband didn't think so. It was very easy also. Dinner was on the table in under 40 minutes from start to finish.

Excellent pasta dish!  Be sure to get the rigatoni with ridges to pick up extra sauce.

This recipe was really good...the only problem was that there were no left-overs!  A quick & easy dinner that looked and tasted like it took more work than it really did.

everything was tasting great until the recipe called for 1 whole cup of parmesan cheese,it totally drowned out the flavors of the ingredients.One quarter or a half a cup at the most will due.Will try this one again though.
