Great recipe.  I doubled the dip because I had 4 avocados.  No beans, I just put the avocado dip in a bowl and put a layer of finely shredded mexican flavored cheese.  Excellent.  Thanks!

Very tasty.  It was a big hit at a work party.  Next time, I will reduce the mayo and sour cream by half - I prefer thicker avocado dips and would like more avocado taste.

This dip is AWESOME!  Oh so flavorful, both my 1 year old and my 3 year old love it.  I did cut the mayo and sour cream by half as recommended by another review.

This dip is a huge hit especially in the spring and summer months. It tastes AWESOME! The fact that it is a cold dip makes it so refreshing on a hot day. I brought it to a party once and everyone wanted the recipe, it has been made by various friends of mine too!
