This is a good and tasty fish. In my opinion, the sauce was a bit vinegary, so next time I`ll use less vinegar. Habanero pepper is unavailable here, so I used jalapeno pepper. I sauted the vegetables a little more than the recipe says. Very good, easy to make and unexpensive dish, will make often, thanks.

This is a great recipe. Used less vinegar as suggested by other reviewer. Sugar provide a sweetness to carrots.  Used too much habenero but it was great anyway. Will make often.

This was an easy dish to prepare. The flavor was very simple and delicious. I like the simplicity of the flavors. The snapper is complemented well by the spicy-tangy kick from the pickled veggies and peppers. Definitely use 1/4 cup of vinegar (as seen on the video) not 1/2 cup if you don't want the vinegar to overpower your taste buds!

Delicious. Used the pickle with different kinds of fish in addition to the snapper.

I love this recipe super simple and great tasting. Stick to the recipe, but use a little bit of cooking common sense, which is instill in us folks that grew up on dirt roads in the woods/country. Okra and tomatoes go well with this dish, also some FuFu. Enjoy!

The hot carrot & onion pickle really make this. I added vinegar and hot pepper carefully, and we really enjoyed the result.   Thanks so much for sharing this, Chef Robert!  We will be raising a toast to you and your grandmother tonight.

I would substitute white wine for vinegar or reduce vinegar.

I liked it, but it uses more vinegar than what's needed.

OMG this fish is so stinking good it doesn’t make sense! That relish is amazing!!! Don’t change a thing. Try and find bonnet peppers if possible :) Worth it but sub a habanero if it can’t be found. So good!
