It is delicious, but way too much sugar. It made so little batter that I didn't have enough for a 9x13 pan so I used a smaller one,so the next time I make it will use less sugar. It had the consistency of biscuit dough, so I am thinking that strawberries would be a good topping also.

Aside from making this in a slightly smaller pan, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out okay for me.  My family really loved it, but to me it tasted quite eggy (though the texture was correct).  I will probably make it again, as it was pretty easy, and my family did enjoy it, but it's certainly not my favorite.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!! The end product was perfect and not to mention delicious.
I added some more vanila and used canned strawberries instead and it worked out great. This recipe was so good that I believe any fruit filling would work well. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made this with a jar of home-canned apple filling instead of canned cherries.  I also substituted Mexican vanilla for the vanilla extract. It was very good...better than I had anticipated.

Read the reviews before I started - reduced the sugar to 3/4 C, and replaced 1/4 C of that with brown sugar. Also reduced to 2 eggs and added 1/4 C water. Used a smaller pan (not 9x13) and baked about 35 minutes. Yummy!

I've tried this recipe twice. My fiance loves this cake. Sweet and simple. The cherries ooze out of the cake. It's delicious warm or cool. Light and perfect.

Fantastic!  My family loved this and I will most definitely be making this again!  I think you could use any flavor of pie filling!

I make this regularly. I substitute the oil with applesauce though and use yogurt and fruit instead of pie filling. Everyone loves it!

This was great! My family loved it. I used a full teaspoon of vanilla but otherwise prepared it according to the recipe. I will certainly be making this often!

Fast, simple and sweet! Made it this morning for the church brunch and got several compliments in spite of the fact that it was over done.  Word of caution, don't wait until the 40 minutes are up, check on it early.  I took mine out at 35 minutes and it was well browned.  Still, I will probably make it again.

I changed the serving to 16 (don't you love that feature?). It turned out we'll and looks beautiful. I was baking I a glass pan so I let it cook for 45 minutes which might have been a little too long as it was a little dry.  I think this needs a little something- dollops of cream cheese maybe?

I follow the Instruction for this cake, and it is the worst cake ever. The texture  taste egg-gy and un-cook. I throw it in the garbage.

The texture was as it should be, but the flavor was just... blah. I even used a full tablespoon of vanilla. I think it was using oil as a fat instead of butter. I tried to make it more interesting using half coconut oil (a crowd pleaser for brownie mix in the box by the way, for a subtle complexity of flavor). But nope, it was very blah tasting. Less flavor than pancakes, and those are all about the butter and syrup right?

I picked out some of the filling, which was great (different brand)

I  used 2 eggs as suggested by one and the change was a great flat crispy crust that was incredible, not a cake but pie.. the whole thing too sweet for me but my neighbors chowed down to the last piece. Considering that I am baking at 6500 ft above sea level, it may be the mountains again or the egg, that's a constant learning curve that makes all cooking interesting here.
