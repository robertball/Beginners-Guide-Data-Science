I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. I also use chicken flavored stove top stuffing. Instead of leaving the breasts whole, I cut them up in cubes. I then season with lemon pepper, salt, and pepper to taste.  While I am browning the chicken, at the end I add some chopped onion, and a bit of green, red, yellow, and orange peppers. I cook till my onions start to turn clear.  My whole family loves it, including the kids. Not to runny for us at all.

Saved this recipe so my DH would have something quick and easy to make for dinner. He did sub sour cream for the milk and the gravy had a nice texture I think milk would have made the gravy to runny which is why I rated it 4 stars. The only issue here is that is so "package" (but that is really to be expected given the ingredients)  tasting but other than that it was a nice hot dinner and he didn't spend a ton of time in the kitchen.

This was delicious, and very easy! I had leftover turkey so I used about 2 cups of cooked turkey instead, along with Stovetop stuffing and cream of celery soup. It's very filling and got rave reviews around the dinner table!

i made a few modifications:  i chopped up some portabella slices and added them to the butter before adding the chicken; i cut up the chicken into pieces to try to cut down on cooking time, but i don't think it made a difference; i used heavy cream and cream of chicken soup; and i omitted cheese.    the result was creamy (not too liquidy), flavorful dish!  not sure how often i'll make it since my kids don't trust anything that resembles a casserole, but i thought it was tasty!

Easy recipe.  I added sauted onions, mushrooms and celery to the stuffing.  Also put salt, pepper and garlic powder on the chicken.  Very flavorful meal and filling.  Serve with a small salad.

Quick and easy!  After reading the reviews about how runny it is I decided to take another member's advice and use sour cream instead of milk and it was wonderful!  I also used Stove Top Stuffing (because that's what we already had).  My boyfriend loved it and even his sister (who doesn't like mushrooms) tried it and liked it.  I will definitely make this again!

I used 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of milk like others had suggested. I also added some pepper and seasoned salt to the sour cream, soup mixture. Overall it was good, not outstanding... just good. It was quick so I will probably make it again.

For a 20 minute recipe, with very few ingredients, this was great.  My kids loved--except for my picky daughter who didn't like they it looked and felt in her mouth.  I substituted cream of chicken and used Stove Top Savory Herbs flavored stuffing.  I also sliced up the chicken into thin strips and mixed it in.  I'll be making it again.

This was kinda hard to review since I made some of my own changes along with changes found in other reviews. My revision gets a 5 so I give this one also. My wife loved it also! I did not put the cheddar cheese on top. Doesn't sound good on this recipe.

Eh, nothing spectacular, but it's good and came together pretty easy. I left off the cheese though. It just seemed like a really weird addition to this recipie.

I added bell pepper, mushrooms, and onions to my dressing and seasoned to taste. I also used cream of chicken, because that's what I had. I noticed it said nothing about seasoning the chicken but I did myself. Lol. My husband liked it, so that works for me.

I followed one of the other reviews and substituted sour cream for the milk.  Absolutely loved it.  A very nice tangy flavor and so creamy.

Always looking for different chicken recipes that my husband will like as he's not a huge chicken fan and I am.  He liked this a lot.  Used chicken tenders. Did use cream of chicken soup and sour cream, but did add a little milk as well. Used Stove top Stuffing.  Just a little cheese.  My apologizes to the poster for all the changes, but it's mostly what I had on hand and it's a really good, quick and easy meal.  Thank you for sharing.  Will make again.

Super easy. I didn't use chicken breast, instead I only had chicken tender strips;seasoned with salt and pepper.(only took 5mins cooktime)Also only had Stove Top stuffing so I used that, another thing used was cream of chicken (seasoned with black pepper) We all enjoyed the dinner. I didn't find it too soggy. I think next time I make it I will heat the soup and milk in a seperate pan so that it's heated through faster.

Pretty good to eat, but not to look at. Turned out mushy but till edible. I added some brussell sprouts to mine and cut the chicken up before adding it back to the pan of stuffing. I also didn't add the cheese but only because I'm making a bunch of dinners at once and needed the pan. My husband will more than likely add cheese to it anyway.

I made the recipe exactly as directed, although the stuffing mix I used was Mrs. Cubinson's and not the PF (I have an onion allergy and can't use any other packaged stuffing). It wasn't super fancy, but the flavor was pretty good, it was quick and easy, and that's what I was looking for. I think in future I'd make it again, but I'd add sour cream instead of milk, and I'd probably add some garlic.

I was making these out of over-spiced pre-cooked chicken breasts. Then I realized that I was out of cream of mushroom & cream of chicken soups. Time to improvise! 
I decided that jarred Alfredo sauce had most of the components of the cream, parm & other goodies, so I went for it.
It turned out great!!!

Brined my chicken in the morning & made my own stuffing mix.  Added cooked mushrooms to a little extra butter.
It was very easy weeknight meal.

Another winner for an easy weeknight meal!  Followed the recipe  and was very surprised by the flavors.   Very good as is and has lots of potential for trying different "things" with it.

It is good, but not a great meal. We still make it quite a lot, though.

I cube the chicken so I don't have to cut it up for small kids later. I add garlic and onion, then too with Frenches Fried Onions and there is always empty plates! This is a favorite of the whole family.

This was very easy and very good. I used Stove Top Chicken flavor instead if the Pepperidge Farm (That's what I had on hand). My husband liked it, so I'll be making it again. Only change I may make is to cut the chicken up before cooking it.

This was a very good, easy weeknight recipe. Only things we did different was used cream of chicken soup since my wife hates mushrooms and we added a little garlic, salt and pepper to the chicken while cooking. Will definitely be making this again.

The amount of gravy made the stuffing soggy, so it was nothing great and tasted sort of "packagey".
