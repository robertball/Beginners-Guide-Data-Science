Gonna try this one this weekend. I did a bit of prep today. Heres a tip.. cut off the stem and use a potato peeler to scoop out the membrane and seeds. it worked for me quite well. then just put the cream cheese into a sandwhich bag, snip off the corner and pipe the cheese into the opening. Less mess!

Just a tip for those handling peppers.  All you have to do (so you don't have to worry about gloves or baggies on your hands) is coat your hands in olive oil.  If your hands end up burning rub them in milk, not a milk based product..MILK.  It takes the burn away immediately, and even works on the lips (sometimes it burns there too after eating a hot pepper).  My Grandma used the oil method and passed it along to me, and also the rubbing of the milk.  IT WORKS TRUST ME!!!

I enjoyed this recipe - the only thing I would have to say was that it was not hot enough.  Perhaps it was the jalepeno peppers I used.  I think next time I will either keep the seeds in or perhaps use some crushed jalepeno peppers in the cream cheese mixture.  I really liked the fact that none of the stuffing oozed out.  I had my doubts since I have never tried making anything like this before. DEFINITELY WILL KEEP USING THIS RECIPE.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE AMANDA.

Like a previous review said, make sure you wear rubber gloves (or if you don't have rubber gloves, put a ziploc bag over you hand) because you can easily burn your hands with the hot oils from the pepper.  It won't feel like it's burning when you are doing it, but a few hours later, the burning will be so intense you can barely stand it!  Also, I tried leaving some of the seeds in as one of the reviewers suggested, and they were REALLLLY hot.  So, if you do that, be really careful how many seeds you leave in.  Perhaps it was just the batch of peppers that I used...but I think they would've been hot enough without any seeds.  My husband and I both LOVED the cream cheese filling with the cilantro and roasted garlic though...it was to die for.  I will definitely make again - but I will definitely wear gloves next time and save myself from being in agony all night long (seriously...the burning lasted more than 12 hours...)

These were okay, but my husband and I thought the strong flavor of the cream cheese kind of overpowered the jalapenos.  I might try them again with less garlic and cilantro, and also without cooking and peeling the peppers first; they were pretty flabby, and one of the things we love about jalapeno poppers is the crunch!

MMMM...Yummy!  These are good, but very time consuming (I tripled the recipe)...I can def. see why jala poppers are so expensive when you buy them out and already made; I did add some canned chopped jalapenos to the cream cheese mixture, which I think, made them a little hotter...my husband thought they were outrageously hot (but they weren't).    Anyway, I enjoyed them, and I would make them again, only next time, I might leave my own addition of chopped jala OUT, so that my *pussy cat* of a hubby can enjoy them too!  Haha!   Thanks for the recipe! :o)  And yes, use a ziploc baggie (as someone else pointed out) to pipe the filling into the jala.; it is a BIG help in saving time and its so much less messy!

ALERT!!!  To help keep the burn off your hands and in your throat from the fumes...while cleaning the peppers, use plastic gloves and clean them under water.  It is a life saver, trust me, good luck...countrygirl,  :o)

Loved the cilantro/garlic in filling.  I leave stems on (as handle) for easier breading. I slice lengthwise along one side & use potato peeler end (prev mentioned) to gently scrap out seeds & some of the ribs. I swish around in water to help flush seeds out - then blot peppers dry. Using a baggie to pipe the filling works like a charm too. (Tip: lightly dust filled peppers with flour or cornstarch 1st so egg adheres better). Because this process requires a few steps I make at least 40 (or more) a batch. I prep the crm cheese and peppers one day...fill and bread (I use Panko crumbs) the next.  I immediately freeze (single layer) on large baking sheet & then store in airtight bag. Poppers ready & waiting - YAY! Note: Jalapenos can vary in heat intensity and you can't tell by sight, feel or smell - only once you take a bite. P.S The 'Raspberry Inferno sauce" recipe on here goes wonderful as a dip for these! Give it a try.

this was a good recipie.. my mistakes were truly my own. My motherwas given some pepers and it was passed that they were jalapenos... WRONG they were habaneros uh so I was killing my self and my friend with them. We only made it through 2 each... but the flavor was good.. And it killed her stuffy nose.. LOL. Defienitely will try again and I will go get my own peppers from the store... lol

I have to say the filling for this is excellent.  I added cheddar cheese to the cream cheese mix and used the leftovers as a delicious dip with crackers.  This is a keeper.

This is a great popper recipe! I substituted panko bread crumbs, and cut out the veins inside the pepper to decrease the spiciness of the recipe. I serve with Trader Joes Sweet Chili Sauce.  Yum Yum! To increase the spiciness of this recipe, simply mix the seeds from the peppers into the cream cheese mixture.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and they turned out super duper spicy. So hot in fact that my husband had to put them in the fridge over night and ate them the next day because they burned his mouth so bad. I suggest if you do not go for the extraordinarily spicy then do not broil the jalapenos before stuffing them with the cream cheese. Might be unbearable for some. Other than that, my husband thought they were great.

this recipe is good but i changed a few things. first i used a serrated knife to lightly scratch the skin instead of peeling it, to peel it was taking to long and was proving (for me) to be impossible, second i added a little bit of sausage to the filling mmmmmm good. have fun and enjoy!!

My Husband & I are starting a small restaurant and I am testing recipes.  This will be on our menu!  I had several friends as testers and they gave it rave reviews.  The best crust I've ever had.  Much better than what you normally get in a restaurant, which is prepacked & frozen.  
I left the stems on the peppers. It makes a nice presentation & easier to pickup.  
Make sure you blanche the peppers until they start to get soft.  If not, you have crunch, raw peppers.  
Thanks for the sharing this great recipe.

I cut the peppers in half and stuffed with cream cheese mixture (I omitted cilanto and added shredded cheddar) Then I breaded the poppers and put into the fridge for an hour to firm up. Right before frying, I breaded the poppers one more time to give the poppers a nice thick, but not to thick, crust. I will use this recipe again! YUMMY

this recipe had a good flavor to it which shocked me because most popper recipes are either bland,chewy or undercooked. I would also recommend lowering your oil temp or to use a peanut oil or some oil that can handle the high temps and not ruin the flavor of the popper. not good if left over the next day.  Guys dont be macho, trust me USE GLOVES when handling the peppers

I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but this was not the best or easiest recipe ever.  It sounded simple enough when I started, but I have to agree with other members about when trying to make these with gloves or something else on your hands, it's not exactly very easy.  My kitchen looks like a disaster area now and they only tasted so/so.  I will try them one more time just to see if it was me or if maybe there is a better recipe out there for poppers.

These were WAY too hot for me.  I wasn't even able to finish 3 and I normally love poppers.  My guess is that a lot depends on the peppers that you buy and maybe how ripe they are, but I don't know what to look for to determine how hot they'll be.  The recipe was also very time consuming.  The peeling, deseeding, and filling were all a pain.  I didn't have gloves, so I put ziplock bags over my hands which made the job harder.  If I were to make these again I might not roast the peppers and I'd probably cut them in half, which would make the seeding and filling easier.  It would also cut the heat by increasing the filling to pepper ratio.

Very good. I don't like cilatro so I left it out and cut back on the garlic. Also better if you put them in the freezer before you fry them. It helps the bread crumbs stick better.

Absolutely delicious!
But more work than I want to go through again in the very near future.

It's August, the Jalapenos are in abundance so I grabbed a mess of them from the garden with good intentions and WOW did I set myself up for disaster. Two days later I had them all finished and ready for the freezer. 

They are a delight to the taste buds, but if you do a huge batch for freezing like I did, be sure you have a stool to sit on!
