Here are some changes that make these muffins even better....  OMIT: sour cream     ADD: 1 stick butter (room temperature), 1/2 cup chopped pecans    INCREASE: white sugar to 3/4 cup.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut orange in pieces and remove pits.  In food processor, put in whole orange, o.j., egg, and butter.  Blend for 3 to 4 minutes.  Sift dry ingredients into a bowl.  Mix in chopped dates.  Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until just blended.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes.  You'll love this even better!

I mixed the orange juice, chopped orange, chopped dates, egg and sugar in my blender. I increased the sugar just a bit, from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup, and used fat free yogurt for the sour cream. 
The flavour is lovely, and I made no other changes.

When I read through the recipe, I assumed that "peel" meant "zest," so that's what I did, and the flavor was spot on. I even used water instead of orange juice, since I didn't have any, and the flavor was just orangey enough. The texture was deliciously perfect. If you're having problems with the texture, consider switching to "Metric" up above in the "Servings" section and weighing your dry ingredients, especially your flour. It will make the baking process much more foolproof. Plus, it's a lot easier on clean-up...just place your mixing bowl on the scale, press tare, pour your ingredient to needed weight, press tare, pour your next ingredient, etc. No need for measuring cups let alone scooping and leveling and getting flour and sugar everywhere. I've converted all of my recipes...just because I like less cleanup! :)

Although I added cinnamon, the muffins were a little bland. Next time will add more sugar & spice.

Yummy and moist like little puddings. I added some ground cloves and cinnamon, and  only used 1/3 the skin from the orange. I don't think I would use any more peel than that as the variety of orange I used had quite a thick peel.

am a bit ambivelent here as far as rating.  Would rate 3.5 stars. I read all reviews first and used just 1/2 the orange peel reserving the other half in case I wanted to add more but didn't need to.  These did have a very nice orange flavor.  Put the eggs, juice, sugar, dates, and orange in my food processor.  I thought at first I had added too much powder or soda because it had that 'fizzy' look and texture but realized it was just reacting with the acid in the juice.  Subbed some of the oj with fresh pineapple juice and they still had very nice orange flavor.  The problem I have with this is #1.  not really sweet enough so would be more like a breakfast muffin.  I intend on glazing them w/some 10x sugar mixed with oj and zest to help with this.  #2.  I was alarmed when I saw one reviewer mention the word 'pudding' like texture.  I found I had to bake them a bit longer to get rid of that spongy pudding like texture and it didn't completely.  Added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. each of allspice and nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cardamom.  These blend of spices were complimentary.  Very good flavor but just lacking in sweetness and the texture.

Sorry, didn't like these at all. Made exactly as recipe stated and found them bland except for the overwhelming taste of orange skin (and I only put in half the skin).  Thanks anyway, Maria.

Mmmm, these were fantastic.  I was a tad hesitant to put the entire orange, skin and all into the muffin, but they turned out just right!  Instead of sour cream I used peach yogurt because it was all I had and the recipe still worked well.  One of the best muffins I ever tasted.

I made these for Christmas morning and I would have given this recipe 5 stars except I had to throw out the first batch. I made them exactly as printed (orange with peel) but when I tried one it was so sour! The next batch I made the same except I peeled the orange and used grated zest instead. They turned out much better without the peel.
Next time I will add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to punch it up a little.

These muffins were well received by everyone who tasted them. However, I changed some things in the recipe (which is why I only gave it 4 stars). 
I zested the orange, discarded the rind (white part) and food processed the inside. 
I also upped the sugar to about 2/3 C (maybe a little less), and added cinnamon and nutmeg. This recipe NEEDS cinnamon and it gives the muffins a great smell. 
I will totally be making these again. 
If you don't really care for orangey things, don't make these little guys.

Fantastic! I loved it.They came out really nice. I added a little extra sugar-2/3 cups, and added raisins (boil them in water/rum first) instead of dates. It came out perfect.I will surely bake these again!

I replaced egg with 1-1/2 tbsp vegetable oil, 1-1/2 tbsp water, and 1 tsp baking soda for the egg. Very moist and delicious.

I have a similar recipe, from another source, minus the sour cream.  It produces a more moist muffin.

This turned out very good using the adjustments other people made. No need for sour cream, yogurt  works perfectly without the extra fat. I blitzed the orange, orange juice, dates and egg in processor. Sifted dry ingredients and then added the wet processed ingredients followed by the yogurt. I also added pecans (half a cup) and a tsp of mixed spice which i think made a nice addition. I zested my orange first and then removed the excess white pith all around before processing. But that's just me because I didnt see the need for the extra non-nutritious bulk the pith would add. Would definitely make again!

The peel of the orange makes the muffins bitter!!!  If I make these again...I would peel and only zest on top with a sprinkle of brown sugar.  I have better muffin recipes.

Great recipe! - I've made these a few times with only slight modifications, and everyone liked them (including my 5 yr old nephew). Only changes I made, based on reading reviews: did not use orange peel, but used orange zest instead; changed 1/3 cup sugar to 2/3 cup sugar; added 1/2+ tsp cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg to dry ingredients.  They turned out fine, not too sweet, a good muffin for breakfast or with tea.
