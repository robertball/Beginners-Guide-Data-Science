Daughter Ashley is giving this a five because she said it was the best meatloaf I ever made! The girls and I are mexican food freaks, so I'd have to agree with her. (Mick, you've gotta try this) It was a little hard to roll but it could have been because I always use ground turkey instead of beef for my meatloaf and it tends to be a bit softer. Anyway, we absolutely loved this recipe Julie and I'll certainly make this again and again!!!!

After trying this recipe I couldn't believe it wasn't rated and put in the hall of fame for the best meatloaf! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. This is now my family's favorite! Thank you!

This is a great recipe.  I add some salsa to the refried beans as well as cheese as I am heating it.  To make the rolling easier I lay this out on wax paper then pull the edges up and use a spatula if needed to roll it.

My husband and I both liked the taste of this, but I think the procedure needs tweaking.  I found the layers slid as I tried to roll it, and it didn't turn out very pretty.  I had the foresight to put the foil wrapped roll into a loaf pan, and it's a good thing I did since the foil leaked a lot of liquid.  I will make this again, but layer the meat, then beans, tortillas, cheese and the remainder of the meat in a loaf pan, top it with the salsa, and bake it for an hour.  Oh, and I only used half the beans in the meatloaf and served the rest on the side.

This was good but if using salsa, use a thicker type or drain some of the liquid. I also spread chipotle pepper paste on top for more spice.

Hands down, the BEST meatloaf recipe out there.  This will please even the meatloaf haters! The only downside to this recipe is that it is a little difficult to roll, otherwise, dynamite! Keep em coming!

My daughter loves this recipe, and she's picky! We use the hard taco shells or nachos inside the meatloaf because that's what she likes, and it turns out really good. Tried it with jalapeno's, olives and some hot sauce and just as yummy!

All I have to say is "WOW!" This was a great variation of a classic...full of flavor and easy to make.  My kids and husband couldn't get enough and keep talking about how yummy this was. Thanks for a great new family favorite!

My husband and I were nervous when it came out of the oven, but it was delicious.  It was tough to roll the loaf, but worth the trouble.

I'm sorry to be the downer here, but we didn't like this recipe at all.  I think maybe I mixed the meat mixture too much but it was hard to handle raw and very tough after it was cooked.  The inside part ended up being a little too mushy.  We ended up throwing it away.  Thanks anyway.

Not bad. But I would stick with bread crumbs. It was to soft and crumbly. But it tasted great!

My very picky 7 year old daughter loved this even and had 2nds, which is odd for her. It was hard to roll up and fell apart after it was done cooking but it was still very delicious.

Very yummy meatloaf! I made a few changes so I could use ingredients I already had, and they worked okay. I added some garlic salt and chopped onion to the meat mixture, I heated and mashed some kidney beans instead of refried beans, and I used a bottle of La Victoria salsa verde mixed with some sour cream. Like everyone else said, I had a really hard time rolling it, and it crumbled on serving, but the flavor was delicious!

Unimpressed.  I generally don't review recipes, but this one was not forgettable.  The flavors aren't bad, but the appearance was atrocious!  I would highly recommend making a 1/3-1/2 inch thick slab of meat rather than 1".  By the time you add refried beans & tortillas, it is nearly impossibly to roll.  I would make a rectagular shape 7x14 type size, 2 tortillas thick on each end.
All in all, it can be saved, but I was not impressed. The flavors didn't blend as well as I would have hoped, altho better rolling technique will help.  Best of luck & don't try it on company!

This was my idea of a reverse burrito. I probably wouldn't serve it to my family if they were expecting meatloaf. Although it tasted fine, there really wasn't a lot of flavor to it. We ate it with nachos to add some flavor.

Did I do something wrong? This tasted terrible. I will stick to old-fashioned meatloaf made with eggs & breadcrumbs or oatmeal.

I was really surprised how good it was since it had sugar in it. Our family loved it. I would have to say it was the best I ever had.

This seemed weird to me at first and we needed a bit of practice with the rolling part, but now this twist on meatloaf is a monthly favorite. I use chipotle refried beans and my own taco seasoning spice blend to give it more kick. I also use ground sirloin, 2% cheese, and two low-carb wraps to help keep it healthy.

We had this tonight for dinner. It was so yummy.  I used ground turkey instead because my hubby can't eat ground beef.  I also used refried black beans from Trader Joe's.  We LOVED it.  I will be making it over and over again.

Great recipe. I'll need to find a substitute for the beans since my husband is not big on beans. I couldn't see trying to roll this so i simply layered the ingredients in a large loaf pan... 1" of meat, tortilla, beans, salsa, cheese; repeat and end with meat and a little more shredded cheese.  I also cooked it, uncovered, in the microwave. I believe it was done in 30 minutes in my microwave.  I took it out when it was done on the edges and pulled from the sides.  Good stuff!

I thought it was fine.  My family didn't like it much.  It's a very impractical recipe.  You can get the same effect without going to the trouble of rolling it up.  Just make a taco salad to get the same effect.

I loved this recipe and so did my family. My dad is mexican so to add meatloaf and make it mexican was a great treat. I used salsa verde(green sauce) instead of salsa and my family really liked it.I sauted some onions and added that to the mix and some left over rice and it made a great touch. My mom hates onions and she even liked the onions in it so yeah. Thanks for putting up this recipe and I will definitely make this recipe a million more times LOL!

I havent had a chance to taste it but there was no way i could roll that however i can say that i tried so i just layered it exactly how it was said to layer before the roll adding an extra layer of cheese on top i also added a can of green chiles drained and black olives, im going ahead and cooking it for an hour to make sure that it does cook all the way through and i did shape it into a loaf with alumanim foil all around it.

I did this same recipe in a crock pot and loved it. It cooked perfectly. Between 4 adults there was no leftovers. The one thing I added was I took tortilla chips and ground them up and used them like bread crumbs. Then we used the meat for taco salads. Also a 16 oz jar of salsa is not enough for the recipe.

I couldn't quite manage to roll it, but it didn't really matter. The taste was fabulous! I think I'd just layer it in a square pan next time rather than try to make it look like a meat loaf. Serve with sour cream. It's delicious!

Delicious!  After reading the reviews and how nobody liked rolling it jelly roll style, I decided to try it a different way.  I put about half of the meat mixture in the bottom of a pan shaped in an oval with a bit of a ridge going around the outer edge.  I layered everything, shaped the top half of the ground meat into an oval, placed it on top, then pinched the two halves together.  Pinch them well, or your layers will all leak out!  I also put some cheese on top of the loaf during the last five minutes.  AWESOME!!

This is a great change from typical meatloaf.
