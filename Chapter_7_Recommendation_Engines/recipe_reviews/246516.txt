The family loved these! I opted not to add the extra pepperoni and cheese to the top b/c I didn't want it to be too messy for the kids to eat. The great thing about these is that you can add any of your favorite pizza toppings, sort of like homemade hot pockets...great idea~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

My family loves these! We just buy the canned pizza dough, and I will let the kids vary in fillings too. We have done it with ham and cheese, bbq chicken... it is all great! For the traditional pepperoni version, I also serve it with marinara to dip.
