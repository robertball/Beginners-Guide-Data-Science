I didn't realize until it was too late that this makes sooo many cookies. I had to hunt in my kitchen to find a bowl big enough to mix it all. I was hoping that I had realized it ahead of time so that I could cut the batch in half. Then I tasted a warm cookie...oh my goodness! These are delicious. I wouldn't change a thing...not even the amount.

This is a simple recipe with basic ingredients and a taste that everyone will enjoy. I used craisins instead of raisins which I believe made it look a little nicer. These cookies are cake-like and spread out a bit on the pan. A halved recipe was plenty for my purposes.

A bit too sweet but very delicious! Easy to make. I made about 80 cookies with this recipe. I used half shortening half butter. Result: very soft cookies.
