It was not difficult to make these cookies. They have an interesting flavor that combines a little bit of spice with the sweetness of a cookie.

What an interesting cookie. Think spiced rice pudding with chunks of Mexican chocolate in cookie form. The cayenne is a very welcome kick. I had to use gluten free flour which was predominantly starches and the batter was quite runny. I added a half cup of sorghum flour. This thickened the batter a bit and after refrigeration the batter scooped up quite well. Thank you for the recipe.
