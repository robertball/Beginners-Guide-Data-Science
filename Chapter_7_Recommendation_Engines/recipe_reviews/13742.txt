Believe everyone, this is a terrific recipe!  Always a big hit.  Try adding an egg and a half a can of sweetened condensed milk and bake in a large iron skillet.  It's awesome.  We like our cornbread a little sweet.  This has a great texture.

This is a great recipe but it needs cheese!! I used about 2 cups of shredded cheese. Bake the casserole first with out the cheese and ten minutes before it's done, pull it out and add the cheese. Bake 10 more minutes and it's perfect!

My sister has a version of this too, hers calls specifically for the Del Monte corn brands and Jiffy mix.  Hers bakes at 350 for 50-60 minutes, GOLDEN BROWN and toothpick clean.  Always a winner every where I take it and never any leftovers.

This exact recipe is all over the web. The only variant is in the egg. I added 1 egg. Didn't drain the creamed corn, did drain the regular corn, used low fat sour cream, and my butter was salted. Cooked uncovered at 350 for at least an hour. Came out perfect - just the way my family always makes it.

Great recipe. I also added 1 egg to thicken the casserole and cooked it for about 20 min extra. I will save this recipe and use again. Thanks!

This casserole is delicious- makes a great side dish, but I would recommend stirring it before serving. It takes away from the initial appearance, but helps the casserole from being too runny. .

Tried this recipe this past Thanksgiving, and it was mouth-watering. The next time I cook it)which will be soon), I will use all of the liquid from the whole kernel corn, and a tad less of the muffin mix. All in all though, it has a good chance of replacing the macaroni & cheese that my family can't seem to get enough of.

I love this recipe. Everyone has demanded that I make this one again soon. I doubled the recipe, added about a cup a shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese, added 2 eggs and baked it in a 9x13" pan. The pan was VERY full. It needed to cook a little longer than prescribed: took an hour. BTW, I read prevous reviews and halved the butter; so 1 stick for a double recipe. Used a sweet corn bread mix (Jiffy) and it turned out slightly sweet almost a dessert but definitely not. Anyway thanks for posting a recipe I didn't need to fool with too much and I'll definitely be making this one again soon!!!

I think this needs the addition of an egg. I will make it again but next time with the egg.  It also takes a full hour to cook.

I love corn casserole and the sour cream is not the dominant flavor.  My mom first made this while we were visiting with her and I throughly enjoyed it.  Too bad you can't classify this as a dessert.  Great for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Will definitely be on my menu in the future.  Thanks Pam.

A similar recipe calls for 2 eggs instead of the butter.  It is also yummy!

I made this for a potluck.  I followed the recipe, but used light sour cream and added 1 egg.  I thought it was a little too greasy for my tastes, wish I would have added 1/2 the butter.  I got lots of compliments on it, though. I think next time I'd add 2 eggs so it's a little fluffier. It was really thin and dense. (I used a cake pan instead of 1 qt dish too). Took 1 hour to bake.

Such a great dish-always a crowd pleaser.  Make every year for Thanksgiving.  I think that I cooked it for 1 hour, 5 minutes.  At 40 minutes,  the center was still like mush.

Great as is...but I add sweet red peppers,cut into bite sized pieces, plain yougurt instead of sour cream and 2 eggs.....I usally make this ahead and let it sit covered in the fridge for a few hours.Then bake as directed...remove from oven and let it sit for about 15 minutes before serving...it holds together better that way.

Had a dinner party last night, where I served this dish, along with enchilada soup...It was a huge hit:))  I didn't have any cornbread mix, so I combined dry ingredients from a regular cornbread recipe. I did add a can of diced green chiles, and shredded cheddar cheese to the mix. I will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this Corn Casserole recipe many times and it has been a huge hit; however, I have tweaked it to fit my taste a little better.  I love the idea of a sweet Corn Casserole, so I add about half a cup sugar to the mixture before I bake it.  I found it helpful to drain the kernel corn so that the casserole does not turn out "soupy".  This recipe can also become a "quasi-desert" by sprinkling sugar, honey, and a small amount of butter on top during the last 10 minutes of baking.  If done right this can give you a caramel-like crust.

Oh my gosh, when I'd finished mixing the ingredients I wasn't so sure how this would turn out, but looks were certainly deceiving! DELICIOUS!!!  I subbed two eggs for the butter and like many others used the box of Jiffy Corn Muffin mix and added a couple of tablespoons of sugar.  Thanks for an absolutely delicious recipe!

This corn casserole recipe is AMAZING. Everywhere I've taken it potlucks, gatherings, etc) it has been raved about. I make a few substitutions: I used light sour cream, and I use only a little margarine (about 1/4 cup). It still comes out perfect. Thank you for this great recipe!

Wonderful flavor!  It was a little goopy so next time I will drain the corn before adding it.  The recipe didn't say to drain so I didn't the first time.

Love this....use Jiffy cornbread muffin mix. Drain the whole kernel corn. Bake at 350 for 1 Jr or until browned. More like a corn pudding. I make this to serve with Texas chili....wonderful

This recipe was delicious!!!!!!!!!!  I think the author should specify to drain the can of whole corn and also to make sure that the amount of the corn bread is exact.  My box was a little less and the dish was too wet.  I also think I would cut the butter in half next time.  Will make this again, and again......

I've made my version of this for years.  I use 1 8 oz. pkg finely grated cheddar and 3 T. regular butter, 1 egg, 1 8 oz. sour cream, 1 can each of creamed and regular corn ( drain whole kernel corn) and 1 pkg Jiffy corn muffin mix.  This is a favorite of my husband and expected every holiday as a side dish.

I love this recipe, and have been using it for years.  The only bad thing I can say for it, is that it always takes about an hour and a half to cook.  But it's totally worth the wait!

Tonight I am making it again, adding an egg and using a muffin tin, to see if I can get it out of the oven in less than an hour.  I'll report back...

UPDATE:  This worked great in muffin tins, and made serving super easy!  Bake time was 30-45 mins.  Pull them out when they still seem squishy, and they'll set up in a few mins.

Just like Grama used to make! I have made this -8 times and haven't changed a thing...except one time I thought I had cream corn and didn't. So I opened another whole Kernel can of corn, drained it and put it in the Vita-mix with a little bit of half and half I had on hand until I got the consistency of the creamed corn and it worked perfectly! Other then that, this is the best recipe ever. My kids say it taste like Fred Flemming's Corn casserole and ask for it often.

I made this for the first time, for Thanksgiving 2010. I thought it would be a nice change from regular corn. Well, it was a big success...I had to double the recipe, as we had a big crowd for Thanksgiving dinner, and I got many compliments on the Casserole.  I made it exactly as the recipe states. I will make this again.

delicious! I doubled the recipe and found that it needed an additional 20 minutes or so to finish cooking.  A big Thanksgiving Day hit!

This is an excellent recipe and a Thanksgiving staple at our house.  I highly recommend using the JIFFY brand corn muffin mix.  If you like crispy edges, put it in a 9x13 pan and bake at 350º for 45 min.

Love this casserole but have added shredded cheddar cheese and traded out the sour cream for french onion dip.  Works perfectly and I don't have to chop onions.

We just love this casserole ... along with another variance (CCII) on this website.  The few additions we add to this one is 1 or 2 eggs depending upon egg size, baking the casserole in a 9x13 pan to have a crisper edge and using Jiffy brand corn muffin mix ... extra sweet and corn flavored! Make this for the upcoming holiday season and your family will give you kudos!  :O)

This recipe is so good. Everyone loved it.  And I omitted the butter altogether and it was still very rich and creamy.  The cream corn and sour cream make the butter unnecessary. Especially good if you are watching your calories.

Wow. I cut back on the sour cream and butter by about half and it was still so dense and thick, I baked it probably a half hour longer than stated and it was still not done in the middle.  I think my expectations were for something like a super glorified cornbread and this was much more mushy.  The taste was really good, but I think I'll try this again with a lot less butter and sour cream to get the texture I was expecting.  It did taste really really good, though!

This is a family favorite.  I make it every year for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas.  If using a smaller/deeper dish, allow for extra baking time.

Awesome! This casserole couldn't have turned out any better. I did as the previous reviews stated and added an egg to the mixture as well as the shredded mozzarella cheese on top 10 minutes before removing from the oven.

Just perfect! I'm wondering about experimenting a bit next time by adding a little of that cheese to the mixture instead of just putting it on top. Hmm...wonder how it will turn out.

Delicious!!  Nothing else is needed. It is perfect the way it is.  I drained the water off the corn niblets 1st.  Most of the corn bread mixes are 7.5 ouncse so I used a little less of the other ingredients to compensate for the difference. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT, EASY AND DELICOUS RECIPE----KID APPROVED!

This was absolutely AWESOME! Rich, creamy and divine! The cornbread mix I used had sugar in it. The only change I made was to use half the butter.  Next time I will try to make this with fat free sour cream and no butter at all... just to see how it turns out low fat.  I will be making this for Thanksgiving dinner!

Tastes great, when it finally cooks.  A 1 qt casserole is not nearly large enough.  I HIGHLY recommend using a 9 x 13 cake pan rather than a casserole dish, otherwise it will be in the oven much longer than the recipe calls for.

This has a great corn flavor so for all you corn-lovers, I would suggest this...
However, I have two issues with this recipe.
The first being that it takes well over an hour to bake properly. The suggested forty minutes were not enough.
Also, this is majorly greasy! In the future I will be using half the amount of butter. (And this from someone who LOVES buttery flavor) It is definitely good, but some improvements to this recipe are called for.

I made this in a 1 quart casserole bowl. It took longer to bake than the recipe states so the edges were well done while waiting for the center to get cooked. Next time I'll bake it in a rectangular dish. Other than that, the recipe is great!

The family loves this. Made it once with Jiffy Corn Muffin mix and once with cornbread mix. I prefer the regular mix as it takes an element of sweetness out but either seems to work well. A touch of cheddar on top at the end is nice for a little difference but the dish can stand on its' own.

I have made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas both times our family has loved this.  I add 1/2 teaspoon real vanilla and 1 egg.  I let it set in the baking pan for about 15 to 30 minutes and scoop it out into a low bowl and it looks like a mound of corn cake.  We love it.

Easy and delicious. It was a hit at Thanksgiving this year.  I used regular stick margarine with No Salt Added canned corn, and it tasted great. Was a little bit drier than I expected, but I think it was due to overcooking, plus I drained the whole kernel corn.

I made this for Thanksgiving in the toaster oven while the ham was warming. It was a huge success...everyone loved it! I was so suprised, since it was so easy and I had never tried it.
I would absolutly recomend this to anyone in need of a tasty and fast side dish.

My mom has been making this recipe for the holidays ever since I was born 22 years ago! I have always loved it. It is the easiest and best corn casserole I have had. The only thing that we do different is we use salted butter instead and we cook it for 50-55 minutes, until it is slightly browned on the top. Delicious!

Very good recipe! Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I modified it a bit by adding 1/2 can of sweet condensed milk as our family likes corn casserole on the sweeter side.

Ok... So my SIS made this yesterday for Thanksgiving ... And I am not really a corn person... It was delicious ... Went back for seconds... The only thing different was she sautéed onions and bell peppers and added to the mixture... And she did use jiffy cornbread.... Yummy...

To those of you who are stating that this recipe is too soft and gummy or mushy, that is how it is supposed to be.  This is a corn spoon bread recipe, renamed as corn casserole.  Corn spoon bread is supposed to be eaten with a spoon.   The only reason I rated this as 3 stars instead of four was because it took far longer to cook to a proper consistency than was stated when made in a 9x9 pan.  Next time I will make it in a 9x13. Other than that it was a 4 star recipe for us.  I did reduce the butter to half the amount, used no salt added corn and added one large egg and a couple of tablespoons of sugar because I prefer a sweet spoon bread.

I thought this recipe was quite good although I think it needs more of a savory flavor. I was short on time and added some green onions. I used a 9x13 pan which I think worked better than a smaller pan which would add to the cooking time. I increased the oven temp to 375 during the last 15 minutes of cooking because I was worried that it wouldn't be done on time and with that, I still cooked it for 50 minutes.. I didn't change anything else other than using lite sour cream. Others have mentioned adding cheese and I really don't think it needs it. I will experimenting with it to give it some zip, maybe a small amount of jalapeno. Will definitely make it again. Forgot to add that I drained the whole kernel corn.

Made it tonight for dinner and it was a big hit! Even my mother-in-law had seconds. The only thing I would do differently is use half the butter next time. And maybe it was my oven, but I had to bake it for an extra 15 minutes to get a little bit of the brown crust. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This was my first time ever making and eating corn casserole so I don't have much to compare it to. It was very simple to make and was well received. A couple of people said it was too moist in the center- I'm not certain is it is supposed to be! The leftovers were even better. I thought the flavors were right on and I will make it in the future when my hubby BBQs.

Meh.  So so.  I thought this recipe sounded great, but was sorely disappointe :(.  I found the baking temperature wasn't sufficient.  It was still liquid and pale after the recommended temperature and time.  I then bumped the temperature to what was recommended on the cornbread recipe.  Had to cook for twice as long.

I've made many corn casseroles and this one is a keeper! I did add 2 eggs a handful of cheddar cheese to the mixture. It was a huge hit for Thanksgiving! We had many delicious sides but this one received the most compliments from adults and kids alike. I doubled the recipe but it was wiped out quickly.So simple but fabulous. Thanks so much for sharing!

It came out very well. One of my son's friends said it was awesome. I think I should have used more cornbread mix but the casserole was moist and easy to prepare. I will make it again.

This is one of the BEST recipes I've tried on here.  We've made it about 6-8 times for our house, and I took it to a potluck dinner at work.  It was a hit there as well.  My brother liked it so much the first time that he made it again the very next morning.  AWESOME stuff, and DEFINITELY recommend.  Will make over, and over again.

I found this on-line right before Thanksgiving and i decided to make it for something different.  Everyone loved it.  There was nothing left over.  It was such a great hit that I decided to make it again for Christmas.

Amazingly good! Tastes like Chi Chi's corn cake. I was short 1 cup of frozen corn and it still turned out great! Since we have diabetics in my family, I used 2T of Sweet N Low instead of sugar. Couldn't tell the difference. Definitely a keeper.

I cant believe the people that change every thing in  recipe and then complain when it doesnt taste good  and give it a bad review.  Here I go but I am not complaing.  Very good but I did follow others that made it and drained the corn and added an egg. It did take an hour not 40 minutes.

Very easy recipe - I used a Marie Calendars' corn muffin mix and baked in my cast iron skillet.  I do not believe contents would have fit in my 8x8 pan.  I did add an egg to the batter to help it "sit" upl  This was wonderful!  I didn't have shredded cheese on hand so was looking for a flavorful recipe without cheese.  I am sure adding cheese to this would have been great too, but pretty perfect without!  I served this as a side to the fresh catfish I caught and fried up this evening.....YUMMMMM!!!!!

Used pan where corn casserole was thicker so had to cook longer... 60 to 70 minutes. Unfortunately I didn't think of that. Next need will use margarine.

Highly recommend for big get-togethers. You can substitute lo/non-fat sour cream and reduce the fat content without it turning runny. Make sure you preheat...needs 350 degrees for the whole cooking period.

I've made it several times. It does the trick, but I think it could also use a little bit of *something* too. I'm just not sure what! Chopped red pepper, maybe?

This casserole is the best!  Here is a really easy trick to make it one dish.
Preheat the oven- once it reaches the desired temp. place the stick of butter in your casserole dish.  Once it is melted- add all remaining ingredients- mix well.
All done in one dish!  I think this is super good- we love it for special meals.

I was really hopeful for this dish, but it turned out really gummy in the middle. I think it was too much sour cream. I followed the recipe.

Very good.  I added an egg as others suggested.  I took this to a potluck and except for a tiny corner, it was all gone.  I added just a dash of black pepper to add a litle seaoning.  I used a 2 qt dish and it was almost full, so I'm not sure how a 1 qt dish will work.

Easy, excellent, everyone loved it.  I made it just as is except I did melt the butter first.  Took it with me to a church gathering, got rave reviews. Exactly wat I was hoping for.

Soooo good!  Excellent recipe-  would not change a thing.  This is really fun to put with Mexican entrees.  If you use a ice cream scoop to serve it, it looks really authentic and festive!

This recipe wasn't what I thought it was going to be. It tastes like bland goopy cornbread with corn in it. I even baked it longer that the instructions said, but it didn't help. I won't be making this again.

I've been making this dish for years.  It is a main staple at fall gatherings.  The only difference between this recipe and mine is I melt my butter.

I made this and took it to a potluck the other day.  It was a nice side dish, not interesting enough to stand on it's own though.  Very easy to make.

I made this casserole for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it!! Just raved about it! I used 1/2 cup of the water from the canned corn kernel and left in the oven for 55-60 minutes as opposed to 40. Was awesome!!

Thanks a million for the recipe!

Pretty good. Was out of creamed corn so used another can of whole kernal and added milk. I used salted butter, added a little more salt and pepper. Still thought it was a little bland. However, we like spicy foods. This took a lot longer to bake than the recipe states. I had hungry family swarming the kitchen waiting on this to be ready while the ribs and beans were already done.

A co-worker brought this to a pot-luck. I had to get the recipe. 
I am not big on veggies, but this tastes like dessert. Fluffy, warm and delicious. You've got to try it to believe how good it is.

This very good.  I added an egg, because all other recipes for this had one in it.  I have to agree that it look longer to cook than recipe said.  I had to cook it a hour.

For years I raved that my boss's corn casserole is the best I ever had. I finally got her recipe and made it for my family's Thanksgiving. It was a hit! I did omit the sour cream just because I had some family members who absolutely hate sour cream, it still turned out great. I also added an extra egg as suggested. For some reason, when my boss and I made our own batches side by side, we found out that if you over mix the batter, it adds to the bake time. My batch ended up taking 2 hours to bake while my boss's batch took only 1/2 an hour, just an observation we noticed.

Love this recipe! I’ve made it in an iron skillet and in a flat muffin pan, which makes them crunchy if you cook long enough.

Bake in a larger dish 9X13, add an egg or two. It took over 90 min in a 1qt casserole dish and is pasty. I was so excited by all the 5 star ratings but now I'm left with corn goo and dinner has been over for a while.

My brother has made this recipe for years and I now make it too.  The only change we do is add an egg and cook in a 2 qt. dish.  I don't understand the comments about it being runny or thin or having to cook it longer.  We both are checking it at 30 mins. to make sure that we don't over cook it and make it too dry... and we both Love cheese...but yuk...not for this recipe.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone seemed to like it.  I added a small sauteed onion to give it a little more flavor.  It's easy, and I can see making it again for my corn-loving husband.

Flavor of corn casserole was good, however it can still use a little bit of improvement. I had to bake casserole longer than what the recipe required. Casserole was a bit gummy, but after refrigerating overnight and microwaving it next morning casserole came out o.k. I added a bit of cheese to enhance the flavor.

Lowered rating by one star because of incorrect dish size--it will NOT fit in a one quart container. One quart is 32oz yet the recipe calls for 54.5oz of ingredients. Use a 9X13 or 2qt dish. 
I had to bake 60-75 minutes for it to lightly brown & for a toothpick to come out clean. 
Added one egg per suggestion of my mom, other ratings, and similar recipes. Used salted butter because that's what I always use. The 8.5 oz corn muffin mix is code for a box of Jiffy.
Overall, good flavor & goes well as a side to poultry/pork but not very economical--around $4.

I added one egg, drained the whole kernel corn, and added cheese the last ten minutes.  I cooked it for about 50 minutes.  It came out moist and tasty.  Im only rating it four stars because i added the cheese and egg.  Definitely will make it again.

I LOVE this recipe! This is my signature dish for family gatherings, and everyone loves it!!! It's super easy to make. A few suggestions would be to add cheddar cheese to the mix, and/or spread it on top towards the end of the bake time. If you want to add a little kick, you can include jalopenos as well.

I've made this so many times now.  It's becoming a staple, but kind of fattening, so only once in a while. Very easy, highly recommend, especially if you're looking for a pot luck dish!  Just double it & makes a large amount! I've gotten so many compliments!

This recipe is so good!! I used Jiffy corn bread mix and added a pinch of sugar for a sweeter taste. I also used 1/2 the amount of sour cream, but added 1/2 stick of cream cheese. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it turned out great!

I added an egg and drained can of kernel corn, also I used salted butter.  It was a major hit.  I doubled recipe to make 9x13 dish. Then doubled it again and made another 9 x13, it was gone within the first 35 minutes of the party! Everyone wanted the recipe, should I tell them its on Allrecipes.com! LOL

I made this as a side dish with prime rib and it was a hit. Everyone loved it!  I made it in a round 1 quart casserole dish.  It looked like a souffle when it came out of the oven.  I did not make any revisions to the recipe, but may try adding green chilies to it for a south-of-the-border twist.

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I added one egg as suggested by several reviewers.  This was sweet but not overwhelmingly so, and the texture was great.  It was a huge hit...many compliments.  I will make this again for sure.

Very delicious. I made this to complement some fairly spicy chili I made. Took other reviewers' advice and added an egg. I baked it for 55 minutes and it came out with the consistency of more of a slightly fluffy corn pudding. I drained the niblet corn, too. Next time I make this I might add another box of corn bread mix (or another half a box) to help it feel a little more like corn bread which is more what I was really craving I guess. Still excellent as is! Sweet, soft, filling comfort food.

Tip:  Drain the kernel corn or it will be runny!  This dish always gets completely eaten when I make it for a potluck or church functions or whatever.  Today, I am trying it with the addition of an egg and 3/4 c. cheddar cheese.

A really excellent recipe. Mine calls for an egg, and can cook up to 50 minutes. It's great for reheating, as putting it in the oven a second night gives it a great toasty texture on top, sort of like a muffin. The kids love it, too!

I think I added too much whole corn and it took longer to set up than the 45 minutes.  I turned off the oven and left the casserole in to set up - it took about 30 minutes.  It was delicious and everyone like it a lot.  I'll make it again using the right amount of everything.  Any issues I had with this recipe were operator error!  Yum!!

I love this dish.  I do have to cook it a bit longer depending on which oven I am using.  I like to sprinkle paprika across the top at the end of cooking to make the dish look a bit more colorful.  I have used several brands of cornbread and it is always good.

I begged a neighbor for her "scalloped corn" recipe. This is the one except the neighbor's calls for 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup. Draining the whole kernel corn makes the casserole more firm, closer to corn bread. Next time, I will reserve at least 1/2 of the liquid to get the scalloped consistency. Using low fat sour cream worked too. Either way, it was a hit at my house.

Didn't vary from the original recipe but found it took one hour to bake. Also, I would prefer a little bit sweeter, so will try next time adding a bit of sugar. Otherwise we liked it well enough, but will make the above alteration next time.

I've been making my version of this recipe for years and it's a family holiday must! I always add an egg and a couple hand fulls of cheddar. Most times I add a 1/4-1/2 a cup of whole corn also for texture. Try it, you'll LOVE it!

I use salted butter... I've made this recipe for all holiday meals for years and years and it's always the first pan to empty out.  It's a great compliment for turkey, ham, steak, and pork chops.  Too easy.  Too good!  LOVE IT!

I was just introduced to caron casserole a couple of year ago and my boyfriend's family always had it during holiday dinners. This was my 1st try at it and I was worried that it might be different from his grandma's recipe. I had heard of people using cheese and some different things but wow, this was AWESOME!! It tasted just like I wanted it to. Thanks!

A friend of mine gave me a similar recipe many years ago. Though it calls for corn BREAD mix I have mostly used corn MUFFIN mix (which is a bit different in it's rising ability) but without problems.  Also, I top mine with swiss cheese slices about 5 minutes before removing from the oven.

IU've used this recipe for years. My husband teaches at a small school and at Thanksgiving they serve dinner to the students.  I am always requested to make the "corn casserole"  The teachers hide it for themselves. lol  I also saute green pepers and onions and add to the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and was pleasantly surprised!  After taking it out of the oven, it didn't seem to be evenly cooked, so I mixed it up and returned it to the oven for an additional 10 minutes.  Perfect!

I did not like the texture of this corn casserole. The taste was not bad, but I guess I am used to my Aunt Kathy's Recipe. Her corn casserole is more fluffy, not pasty. Sorry, but not my favorite.

Delicious recipe!  Only negative thing I have to say about it is that a 1-quart baking dish would not be big enough.  I used a 2-quart, and the mix almost overflowed after cooking (therefore, 2 quart is the perfect size, but 1 quart would have been insufficient).  Thank you for sharing!

The recipe came out way too greasy and took longer to cook than the stated time. It did not reheat well, either. I am willing to try it one more time using an egg as suggested by fellow foodies.

This was pretty good.  I didn't change anything and it came out tasty.  My toddler (who usually sticks to a few certain foods)even ate it.  We called it corn cake- and the "cake" aspect sold her on it.

I've been making something like this for years now. I melt the butter, add an egg, but only put about 1 cup sour cream. I think this makes it perfect! Not too runny,  or too much like true cornbread, either.

we think it turned out really great. we used a large casserole dish, and the finished product was too shallow. we suggest using a smaller dish and 3/4 can of the kernel corn.

I gave four stars as written. I have always made this same recipe but mine calls for 2 eggs also. I always use Jiffy corn muffin mix for this and turns out great every time. Baking time is 30 - 40 minutes. Sometimes I add jalapenos and top with cheddar cheese if going with chili. So very easy to make.

I was visiting my daughter-in-law for the holidays and asked if I could help.  Well, I got to make this fabulous corn casserole in just a matter of minutes.  Everyone raved about it.  The next day, Christmas, we had so much left over that we reheated it and we all thought it was absolutely great again.  I am now making this for my New Year's Eve party for 40 friends.  It's a can't-fail recipe.

I have to give it 5 stars because it is the easiest thing on earth to make. A total idiotic moron could make this. I think it's supposed to be a bit mushy ... lots of corn flavor. It would be great with jalapenos and cheddar.

Really tasty!  I used Mexicorn to add a punch of color and flavor.  I served it with a kettle of homemade turkey chili we had on Thanksgiving day.

By the way, we saved our "big" meal until the Saturday after Thanksgiving when all our family came in from out of town.  In our home, every day is a day to give thanks.

I added one egg as per the other reviews.  It took 1 hr 25 minutes to cook through.  I think the taste is ok, I feel like there is something missing.  My husband and I put crushed red pepper flakes on top to spice it up a bit.

I found this to be a little bit gummy, and I had to bake it twice as long as what the recipe said.  I even wound up sticking it in the microwave to get it all the way cooked through.  As a result, everything else was on a the table and I ended up not even serving the corn casserole.

I have made this recipe for the last 2 years for both Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. My adult sister (who won't eat anything!) loves this dish. I've also taken it to office potluck dinners and have gotten rave reviews! I had to write the recipe down for several different people, luckily it is a very simple recipe to remember! It is one of the easiest and inexpensive dishes I have ever made. I does have to be cooked longer than 40 minutes, usually 50-55  minutes or until top is golden brown.

This was awesome! My husband is very, very picky and even he loved it. I will continue to make this dish. I did add some chopped onions and I used a 13x9 in. pan (I had to cook a little longer - total time in oven, 50 min).

Talk about a easy recipe. Just mix everything together & pour into the pan. This is a little sweet to me but my husband & 12 yr old son loved it & told me not to change a thing. I did add an egg to this as others suggested.

I get so many requests for this recipe! I've never tasted a corn casserole as delicious as this one. Don't tell my Mom, but I now think I found a corn casserole recipe better than hers...:)

I made this along with Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili last night for the Super Bowl and it was a huge hit! I did add an egg as others recommended.   Great recipe.

It was a hit at Thanksgiving this year!  My sister-in-law kept raving about this dish.  It even warms up nicely in the microwave.  Also a great addition to a Mexican themed dinner!!

Used regular salted butter.  Fantastic and easy recipe.  The family all raved and requested this for every holiday.  Easy to throw together and scales nicely.

I loved the creamyness of the dish.  As I prepared it I found that I didn't have sourcream or creamed corn! So I added more corn and used yougurt instead!  Great!

This casserole is FANTASTIC!  My Dad used to make a similar version of this years ago and I was looking for a corn casserole to duplicate his recipe and came across this one, and it's even better than his.  It's super easy- almost fail proof, and everyone loves it.  This is always the first thing to disappear at Thanksgiving, so much so that I've started making extra servings so we have plenty left for leftovers.  I've given this recipe to my Mom, sister and aunt, and they all have said it's a big hit with everybody everytime they make it.  The recipe is great just the way it is, you don't need to add or subtract anything- just make plenty of it, as it will go fast!

I made this for the 4th of July gathering we had and everyone really liked it.  The only thing I can say is it took my oven about 55 minutes to cook it thoroughly.  I will make this again it was easy and very tasty!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

This is really tasty, and very similar to the stuff I get at the local mexican restaurant.  It's very mild, slightly sweet, and goes fantastic with super-spicy dishes for some contrast.  It was exactly what I was looking for, thanks!!

This is a great recipe that I make every year for two different Thanksgiving celebrations.  I double the recipe and bake it in a 9x13 pan until a knife inserted comes clean (about 45 minutes).

The basis for this recipe is, of course, the famous "Spoon Bread Casserole" recipe by JIFFY. They make the corn muffin mix that most people use in this recipe. Their recipe calls for using the small size cans of corn: 8.75 oz. whole kernel (drained, of course), and 8.25 oz. cream style. It doesn't call for the larger cans (14 to 15 oz.). (Those leave the casserole too wet, I find.) Importantly, their recipe also calls for 2 eggs, and a higher oven temperature of 375°, and a baking time of 35 to 40 minutes (in a 1½ quart dish), or until the center is firm. That recipe is on their website. I make a point of waiting for the surface of the casserole to be quite golden brown, too.

It was delicious, but recipe doesn’t say anything about draining (or not draining ) corn niblets.  So, I drained.  I added an egg, after viewing other comments, and used 1/2 a box of Trader Joe’s cornbread mix, since it was a 15 oz, not an 8 oz. box.  Then I added fresh rosemary to the batter.

Which of these “alterations” made the cooking time not work, I have no idea, but it took an HOUR for this to bake !  It totally missed my Christmas dinner- so disappointing..

Otherwise, would have gotten a 5, not a 4.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious.  The second time I added jalapenos and it was even better.  Loved it cold, but reheated in the air fryer was the best.

Very easy to make and turned out delicious!  Doubled the ingredients and baked in a large cast iron.  I left it in the oven until it was baked thoroughly which was abt 20 mins more.  PERFECT

For my taste, i would have preferred something with more of a spoon bread texture. Maybe next time I’ll try a recipe for corn pudding. This just tasted like cornbread with whole corn kernels in it.

This recipe is perfect exactly as it is! I’ve been making it for a few years now. Every time I make it, people brag on it and beg for the recipe. It is quick and easy.  For anyone who isn’t a fan of sour cream, you can’t even tell there is sour cream in it.

I’ve always made this using an egg in the recipe at the holidays. Today I used all my eggs making a friends birthday cake (Black magic cake with Caramel frosting IV) so I was happy to see this recipe that didn’t call for an egg. Looks like it usually does, so I’m sure it will be great!

Loved it! Quick tips: reduce the butter and add cheese. Cook time can vary greatly, go for a balance of crispy edges and gooey center. I doubled the recipe, reduced butter by half, had no eggs to add. I baked it in a 9”x13” glass pan for an hour and 15 minutes. I stirred it half way though, I highly re on

I reduced the butter by half, and added green chilies. Needed more than 40 minutes to cook (so I put it in the microwave on simmer for 5 minutes, to free up the oven.)  I don't like this too sweet, and this recipe worked out well.

I added egg and a little shredded cheese to it. You can also add a little extra whole kernel corn if you don't like it as runny.

My boyfriend is obsessed with this! I already made this twice in less than a month! This recipe is so easy and delicious. But it needed more sweetness. I’ll definitely add some condensed milk (like another review said) next time!

OMG - this is so warm and comforting!!  And versatile - great as johnny cake with honey or syrup, or with chili.  It's got such a nice, smooth mouthfeel and just melts in your mouth.  I only used 1 can of creamed corn, 1/2 the butter, 1 egg, and a little less sour cream as I didn't have enough.  I'm addicted to this!

Always a crowd pleaser!  I did double it and added 2eggs. I drained the juice from one can of regular corn.

I really liked the recipe, it is quick and easy.  Great option for a pot luck. Note.  The whole corn needs to be drained.

This is very good.  I served it Christmas Eve. My guests loved it.  
The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture before baking.  I will be making this again

I added a chopped green onion, salt and white pepper. 
Great base recipe for your favorite ingredients!

My family loved it! I made this for Thanksgiving and I wasn't sure how they would react since they do not like creamed corn. I followed the recipe exactly, which as an Italian, we never do.  They loved it.  It is delicious and not too creamy. They were actually upset it went so quickly.  I will definitely be adding this to my list of favorites.

This came out really well and I liked it... the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my family said they hated it!  Seriously, hundreds of people loved this recipe, I thought this would be a hit with my family and they said they couldn’t handle the texture (the corn!) .  I just wanted to warn anyone that has texture issues or if your family does, this is not the recipe for you ??. Sadly I will not be making this again because it was a huge waste for me

I tried doubling the recipe because I was feeding a crowd. It took over 2 hrs to cook and the middle still wasn’t done me. Otherwise very tasty. I will try again as a single batch.

I also add an egg for a single recipe as well as a can of green chili peppers.  This is a family favorite.  New addition is French's now makes jalapeño's like their fried onions...nice texture addition for topping.

Followed directions as listed with the following adjustments: added an egg and it was fluffier than usual. Nice.  Lactose intolerant so I subbed ghee for butter and Lactaid cottage cheese blender-ed smooth for sour cream. Perfect. Baked for an hour. Bake it in a clear glass dish Until the bottom starts browning.

Made it for the family Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it and wanted more. I made a double batch in a 9"x13" pan, and it needed about 15 minutes extra baking time, though our oven also runs cool.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone really enjoyed it.  I did have to cook it longer than listed because it was so moist.   This will definitely be part of our holiday menus from now on!

This is fantastic!  I usually use fat free Greek yogurt in place of sour cream (in everything).  That works well too!

I have made this before,it was delicious,my husband wanted me to add more corn(Niblets) this time,so I added 1/2 can more and instead of yellow corn I used white sweet corn,and last time I added cheese on top and put it back in oven long enough to melt,every one loved it,this is for Thanksgiving dinner,so I made it ahead of time,I pray it’s tasty,won’t know until turkey day??cheese won’t go on until I heat it back up and then I’ll add it.

Delicious but not sure of texture.  Took it out at an hour and it was crispy on the edges but mush all around.

I actually made this twice this season - once per the basic recipe + 2 eggs - turned out just ok - a little flat and dry.  For Thanksgiving dinner I added the green Chile’s, cheese and used mexicorn - no eggs.  Fantastic!!!  Family loved it.  I will make it this way from now on!

Very good.  No changes.  Everyone loved it!.  I made it in an oval baking dish and it took a little over an hour to bake.  If it sloshes when you shake it, it is not done.  Should not be soupy.  Next time I might drain the kernel corn so there is less liquid.  It should brown lightly on the top.

Very good and a new family favorite!  I didn't change anything except used a 6oz package of cornbread mix. I drained the can of whole kernel corn, & didn't the can of creamed corn. One of these recipes you keep forever!

It was pretty good - - made it just like the recipe said but drained the kernel corn.  Was very close to cornbread.  If I make it again, I may follow the suggestions of adding green chilies and cheese.

I read the helpful reviews before making this so I tweaked the ingredients a little and it came out much better than I expected!  I really love this and will definitely be making this again.  I added one extra large egg to make it fluffy, drained the liquid out of the whole kernel corn completely and added one tbs of sugar to add some more sweetness to it.  I also started checking the oven at 45 minutes and only needed to bake an extra five minutes and it was just perfect!

This recipe is always a crowd pleaser. However, per other reviews, it ALWAYS takes longer to firm up (15 minutes minimally), especially if you double the recipe. I've made it as is and with the addition of a cup of cheddar cheese and scallions for something a little different.

At the last minute I was asked to bring a corn dish to Thanksgiving. I chose this recipe because of all the positive comments. I made it just as the directions stated and it was a real hit!!! I am sure we will be having this throughout the year and not just on Thanksgiving.

1st review I've written since joining this site a year ago. This recipe was that good! Made it for a family gathering & it was a huge hit! I know you should rate recipes as is, but I took the advice of other reviewers and glad I did. Used 1 box of Jiffy mix, added 1 egg, drained the whole kernel corn, added 2 tablespoons condensed milk (needed to use it up) and baked in 9x9 casserole for 1hr.  It wasn't served until 2 hrs later (long story) but it was still warm & delicious! Great corn flavor & sweet but not too sweet. Will definitely be making this again!

My whole family loved this (even the ones who don't love corn).  I doubled the recipe and cooked in the biggest flat pan I own so it would not be too thick.  I sprayed the pan with nonstick 1st and then melted the butter in the pan in the oven (only used half the butter called for in recipe) and added an egg (two actually, but I doubled the recipe).   I added grated sharp white cheddar to half of the mixture before cooking, but after cooking/eating, I could not even tell which half got the cheese!  I'm glad I cut the butter in half or it may have been greasy, especially with the cheese, even though it didn't make much difference (I added about a cup of cheese).  This was really good.

I make this often and it's wonderful.  I always use 2 cans of creamed corn instead of 1 of creamed corn and 1 can of whole kernal corn.  Delicious!

Great!  Easy to replace sour cream with vegan mayo, if you want an egg and dairy free option.

This recipe is a delicious remix to regular cornbread. I added the 1 egg as others suggested. My family gave it rave reviews. This will definitely become a new BBQ staple.

This is nearly my mom's recipe, but with the added bonus of extra corn! So good. Not corn bread per se - more of a dense spoon bread - but that's a good thing in my book.

Made it exactly as written the first time and everyone liked it but a bit too creamy. Second time added two cans of whole corn and family finished it all asking for more!  Will be doubling recipe next time so I can have some leftovers??

This version is easy to make, but I modified mine and added frozen vegetable mix to it.  Just a good warm casserole.  Put side by side with some nice chili.  Don't mix together though in the bowl, just a little bit of each on the spoon.  
Outstanding for a cold day.

Made this last night for a church function and everyone loved it including me.  It was my first time making a corn casserole.  I doubled the recipe with the exception of the butter I kept that at the one stick (1/2 cup) and baked in a 9 x 13 inch pan.  Allow yourself enough time to bake this, it took a good 50 + minutes to set and for the knife to come out clean.  I saved this in my favorites and will be making again as it is so easy and so delicious.

Very easy recipe and tasted great.  Next time I will use a honey cornbread recipe to sweeten it up just a bit, or perhaps a jalapeño cornbread to spice it up.  Easy prep and was a hit with the family.

I made this over five times in two months and very time it was a hit. My family love spicy food so I chopped a quarter of a hot pepper, added onion and garlic and it was  just perfect.

Been making this for years - - always a favorite for family gatherings! I always add an egg though & my daughter & I discovered out that by adding honey tastes like what they serve at our favorite Mexican restaurant!  I always double this as that is just right for an 8 X 12 casserole dish. I just put in 3-5 T of honey  one of my favorite recipes!!

So good, we all loved this one.  Will make this again.  Mine had to cook for about an hour before it was done.  I also stirred it after the 40 minutes were up, then cooked it for another 20 minutes.

A delicious recipe, just like my mom makes it.  The only change I do is bake it in a 13 x 9 pan.  The reason:  everyone in my family likes the chewy outer edges and the four corners are the first four pieces gone from the dish!  The only dish I make the inside pieces are the last to be eaten.

I have been making this recipe for 4 years, and it's a winner at any party! I am expected to serve this and it's so simple to make and so tasty! I usually double the recipe because it's so good and I serve it to quite a few people. I would definitely add an egg (or two if you're doubling it). Awesome to make as your Thanksgiving dinner contribution, or if you need to make an awesome and QUICK side dish that everyone is sure to love. (I use Jiffy brand corn bread mix because it's been a trusted brand in my family for years). Enjoy!

I made double for a group of over 50 people, and it was a hit!  I was nervous about it since I've never made it before, and it was a large amount.  The recipe couldn't have gotten any easier.

Huge hit! The only thing I did different was add a little heavy cream to make it a touch creamier and I used a bag of frozen kernel corn. Everyone loved it! I will be making this again!

I made this for my very picky son one year for Easter. It now appears throughout the years at different holidays. I strained the whole corn and partially melt the butter (partly because I forget to take it out) and it turns out great every time.

When I first made this my nephew didn't like it due to texture so the next time I made this, once out of the oven I mixed in a bowl, set aside for 30-mins, then portioned out patties using a silver ring and pan sautéed on both sides to make a crust and add color. He loved it!
Make half this recipe if possible for 2-4ppl, we had a ton leftover, but it is a great leftover.

after reading the reviews, I added an egg, but forgot all about the butter, but it still turned out moist and yummy!  Cooked it for an hour in a cast iron skillet.

Love this stuff! Like many others, I add an egg to thicken. The other thing I do a little different is to use 4 oz of cream cheese and 4 oz sour cream vs using a full 8 oz of sour cream. It gives it a little creamier, comfort-food feel. Yum-o!

Made the recipe as is and it was awesome.  May suggest cooking a little longer so it's not so runny but still a great side to any meal!

This recipe is amazing. It is great as posted. Super easy to prepare and the ingredients are simple. The second time I made I added chopped Jalapenos and a packet of equal because we like the spicy/sweet combination. Delicious. Everyone that has tried it asks for the recipe. This will definitely be added to my line up for holiday meals.

Definitely add an egg to this recipe.  It does need about an hour to cook.  I only used 1/4 cup butter b/c 1/2 is way too much and would turn out greasy and mushy as others have complained.  I added about 1/8 cup condensed milk to make up for a little liquid.  Try 1/4 tsp nutmeg and some pepper for extra flavor and grate some cheddar on top for those who complain it is bland.

I made this today for my husband and I as a side for our Thanksgiving meal and was very disappointed. I should have followed some of the other reviews and added some sugar. I have had other corn casserole dishes and they had a sweet taste to them but this didn't at all. This was not at all what I was expecting. I may give this one more try and add sugar to it because I did like the texture of the casserole, just not the taste.

I liked the recipe.  Just a tad greasy for our taste.  Also it took longer than 40 minutes.  I did not read the reviews before making this (was rushing to get supper on the table) so I did not know to allow extra time, and it did hold up the meal for 10-15 minutes before it was ready.  But, it has a good flavor and I'll make it again with perhaps not quite as much butter.  A good, easy recipe.

My child is a picky eater, but really likes this recipe.  There is another similar recipe that calls for addition of cream cheese, but we find this one to be just as good without adding cream cheese to it.

Very delicious! Just like my mom makes during thanksgiving. I had been craving this for a while so I decided to make it tonight for dinner. I didn't have a package of corn bread mix, so I made my own. I used 1 1/4c. Flour, 1c. corn meal, 3/4c. sugar, 1tsp. salt, and 1tsp. baking soda (mixed in 1tsp. vinegar when combining all ingredients from this recipe) It came out wonderful, but I added a little tiny bit too much corn bread mix, so it was not as creamy as my moms, but it was still amazing! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this casserole this evening.  It is always great for a quick and easy side dish.  I halved the recipe to accommodate just the two of us, and froze the extra corn to use again later.  Delicious side!

I first tried this recipe in college for a girl.  I wanted to show that I knew how to cook, but didn't have any recipes.  I am now married to her and she still asks for this to be cooked!  

I don't put the specified amount of butter, I take a knife through margarine and get a healthy "southern" amount.

This is the best version out there! I've tried the version with an egg added to the recipe, and it comes out too dry. I've been using this one for Thanksgiving since 2006.

Delicious, Simple, and Budget Friendly.  I have had spoon bread at Don Pablos and always wanted to know how they made it.  This taste almost exactly the same.  I did drain the can of whole kernel corn...It certainly doesnt need the tablespoon or 2 of "juice" from the can.  No other alterations.  Paired with salsa chicken for a super dinner!

We love anything corn + a casserole=delicious! This was so easy to prepare, but I did take prev suggestion of adding an egg, and I really do think that it helped bind this casserole together. Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written. I give this recipe 4 stars for it great taste + ease of preparing. Thanks for the recipe (:

Mmmm this was our first time having this and my hubby and I loved it. I only used half of the butter (1/4 cup) and added 2 eggs. I cooked it for 70 minutes. Delicious! Not runny at all!!

I LOVE this dish. Super easy, you only get one bowl dirty, and the taste is addictive. Next time I'll try adding an egg as some of the other reviewers have suggested.

Oh my goodness! I didn't even get the mix into the oven, before my husband and myself were eating it. I did add some garlic powder and I didn't have a whole container of sourcream, so I added some evaporated millk. Delicious!

This tasted ok, but it was very runny.  I don't know if the corn should have been drained?  The recipe did not say so I did not do it...looking back maybe that was my mistake.  If I ever make again I will drain the corn, but my family wasn't overly impressed.

very good---I added the whole can of corn and did not drain AND I added an egg and some cheese on top.  I also baked it a for about an hour.  Next time I will add some peppers or something like that to give it a little color.  Will definitely make it again!

I have to say that this is the best corn casserole I have ever had. I did make one small cahnge though. I only had 6.5 oz package of corn bread so I used 2 of them and added a 1/4 cup water to it and it was awsome. I have had several store bought and have made a few recipies but none of them had the flavor of this one. Definately a keeper. Oh and was still awsome as leftovers a few days later.

I love this recipe! I've been making it for years; it's easy to double for large gatherings. The only thing I change is substituting frozen corn for the can of whole kernel. Enjoy :)

My mom loves corn pudding and this is really easy to make.  Dont be worried it is very runny going in the oven it thickens considerably when it bakes. Not as good as traditional granny recipes but quicker and can be fairly low in fat with modifications.

This is an excellent recipe - easy to prepare - delicious - best if served hot out of the oven - I added a small can on chopped green chilies - otherwise it may be somewhat bland. Add salt and pepper if you wish. I would make it again - I doubled the recipe and also used frozen corn - yummy

Everyone loved this. I had to bake this for closer to an hour. I read complaints that this was too runny so after 25 minutes I mixed it all up and patted it back out so it didn't get ugly. I added a little black pepper to the mixture and 5-10 minutes before I took it up i added shredded cheese to the top and put it on broil. Turned out perfect!

This recipe was amazing!  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it so much, they want me to make it for Christmas.  I didn't change a thing.  I did double it to make enough for my family, and it doubled very easily and came out delicious.  This is definitley a keeper.

A family friend brought this casserole every year for Christmas, and it was always my favorite dish.  I was lucky enough to find this recipe and I was able to make it for Thanksgiving this year!  I tried to double the recipe and put it in one of those 9x13 aluminum lasagna pans - but it was too full.  I ended up taking some of the batter and freezing it - hopefully it will bake up alright.  In the future, I will only make 1.5 recipes - as two is just too much!  Besides that - it tasted delicious and everyone really enjoyed it!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Will try a version with chilis somtime soon, but loved it as is.   Definitely soft and not too sweet.  Good with or without turkey and gravy.  We did this in addition to stuffing, not instead of.

I have made this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and if I dare show up without it; I think I would be in big trouble!  Even corn haters love it-it is awesome!  I do leave it in the oven around 10 minutes more to make it golden brown on top.

This was great, the only thing I would change is to add a litle more liquid next time as it was just slightly dry after warming up leftovers and I think a little extra liquid would have helped.  It was fabulous though.

I give this three stars because it is a great potluck recipe...simple, cheap and people seem to really like it, but for my personal taste I think its just blah. It's smells just heavenly while it's baking, but the flavor (or lack of) is just disappointing. I would not make this for a family meal, but it's a failsafe recipe for potlucks, as people just scarf it up...go figure.

Great, plain or vanilla yogurt is a good replacement to sour cream. I know it sounds weird but its great. Also, add an egg and 2tbsp. or suger

this is really good.  I added two eggs and 1/2 can sweetened condensed milk for added sweetness as suggested.  I will definitely make it again this way.
If you follow the recipe as is, it's plain and I didn't like it and my family didn't like it so definitely need the changes I made above.

Didn't give 5 stars because it is corn afterall, and no corn dish is 5 star quality. But, as corn dishes go, this is definitly one of the best. Was looking for something than just plain ole cream of corn or corn on the cob and this was a great choice. The kids liked it as well and will be making this a regular dish.

The absolute best corn casserole EVER!  I always get asked to make this for functions (even though anyone could make it easily).  And when I make it, I always share this web site so people can come get the recipe themselves - they always ask how its made!

This is a winner recipe. I make this exactly as stated whenever I need to bring a dish somewhere and it always gets wonderful remarks. I personally am not a sour cream fan but you cant taste it in here. It just makes it extremely moist! A++++++

I made this recipe as written and was a little disappointed. First the recipe needs to be baked in a 2qt pan not a 1 qt pan. Second, after 40 minutes of baking it was still somewhat raw and not even a little brown on top. I cooking this for a little over an hour to get it solid enough to eat. Maybe my expectations were a little out of whack with this recipe but it needed something. I think an egg and a tablespoon of sugar would have helped this alot. The consistency was a little too runny for me and it wasn't sweet enough.

Pretty good! The important thing is the family liked it @ T-Day dinner. Only thing I added was (1) egg but this was still slighty runny and took a little longer to finish cooking.

Made this for Thanksgiving meal. So easy and so good!  I listened to other reviewers and added one egg.  Left out salt and pepper. There was plenty of salt from corn even though I used no salt added whole kernal corn. Better for those of us with hbp. It was perfect.  I ate way too much! Definitely 5 stars!

Wonderful! I didn't have unsalted butter so I used margarine.  After 40 min the center wasn't fully set so I microwaved 5 min and it was perfect. My family all voted this in for Thanksgiving this year!

Love this dish.   It is soooo easy to make it's a sin !!  I have made it the night before and baked it the following day.   It's always a hit.  I make this alot during Thanksgiving.  My daughter just made this for us the other night and she's 16 !  Super easy and tasty and fairly cheap to make.

A wonderful recipe!  I have been making this as a side dish for a few years and it is a family favorite.  Always present at holiday dinners, a nice change from the same old stuffing.  For an easy main dish add a small can of peas and diced carrots and some ground pork sausage.  Yum!

Very easy and delicious.  I used Jiffy corn muffin mix because I like a sweater taste.  It took longer to bake than directed.

This was excellent.  Served with chili at a football party.  Everyone loved it, many requests for the recipe.  

It did take a little longer to cook than indicated but it was great.  Will be making it again super bowl sunday

*** since I first reviewed it this has become one of the most requested dishes for me to bring to events...a 'signature' dish that's easy - gotta love it

I like this recipe, but prefer a creamier texture so omit the can of corn kernals.  I also add about 1/4 cup of sugar to sweeten it up a bit.  reminds me a bit more like the old CHI-CHI's corn cake.

My family loves loves loves this recipe in fact it's always requested for holiday gatherings. This reminds me of the sweet corn cake once served at Chi Chi's.  Sometimes I add 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp sugar also cooking time is closer to 1 hour or longer if doubling the recipe.

This was good, but my family wasn't wow'd by this recipe.  I cut the butter in half and added an egg like many reviewers suggested.  It was kind of gooey and mushy.  I think maybe next time I would skip the sour cream, or at least use less of it.

I would say a 5 because it is great if you want all that corn, for me I eliminated the whole kernal corn and added 1 egg to the mixture cooked at 350 for 45 min!! Tasted great if you dont like all the corn and want if fluffy!

This is a great recipe for holidays or potlucks--so rich it's a treat, but super easy to make.  One or two drained 4oz cans of green chilies are a good add-in.

We tried this at Thanksgiving and everyone gave it a great review.  My children and grandchildren love cream corn, but I don't so was looking for something we all would enjoy. This was just the ticket.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving and all of it was gone. The sweetness of the muffin mix and the sweet crisp corn are great together. I will make this again very soon. It is very easy to make.

Several years ago friends of mine invited me to dinner and this casserole was included.  I fell in love with it and asked for the recipe, which they stoically refused to share. Since finding it, I have prepared this several times, all year 'round, though I add a wee bit of sugar.  It's down-home goodness, the kind of recipe I wish I could've grown up with.

This did take a lot longer to cook than stated.  It was pretty good, but maybe just too different from what we're used to - didn't go over all that well.

Very good, but it took alot longer to bake then the recipe said for me. I ended up baking almost an hour at 350 degrees. I was using a 1 1/2 Qt. Corning ware casserole, so maybe that had something to do with the long cook time.

I have been making this casserole for a very long time (long before I saw it here).  Everyone compliments me on it.  It's a great side dish!!
