These are really good.  I omitted the MSG and substituted homo milk for heavy cream.  I used lean ground beef and fried them without butter.  These changes made the dish healthier and from family reviews, they loved it! The flavour of this dish was superb.

This is great recipe - it is very time consuming but I only make it once a year, for Christmas Eve.  Actually, I make them ahead of time - the meatballs freeze beautifully.  Then I just have to brown them and make the sauce.  My mother's family is Scandinavian and they always cooked with these spices.  I do think the sugar quantity is a misprint.

I've made this about 4 times now and has become a tradition at Christmas as we serve mostly Swedish dishes.  Time consuming, but worth it.

It's nice to see a traditional Swedish dish made with traditional Swedish spices.

Serve this with lingenberries to enhance the flavor.

MSG??? Both parents born in Sweden and Mom never put onions in anything she called Swedish. American (yeah I'm one too) are onion crazy. At least this one's got the cardamom in it. For me - No onions, no mushrooms, no green peppers either.Â  No thanks but if you prefer go for it.

There is no question in my mind that 1/2 cup sugar is a typo error,try 1T or less. I used only 1/2 cup butter in the total recipe and used 2 cans evaporated skim milk instead of cream. Also, added mushrooms.I personally loved the blend of spices in this recipe. Do make this if you do not have time for kitchen clean up.

Meatballs are WONDERFUL!!! The sauce, however, is a bit sweet to our tastes. I'd cut the sugar down in half, even by 2/3.  Otherwise, I received many compliments when I served them as an appetizer.

OK, this one is a ton of work-took me a couple hours to get everything together, but it was so rich and satisying, it was worth it!  The sauce was awesome over hot cooked egg noodles, plus it made a lot so we ate this for a few days.

Very good, but if using fresh ground cardamon, cut it in half.

My hubby and I loved this!  I took the advice of an early post and cut back on the sugar and also left out the MSG, but otherwise stuck closely to the original recipe.  My kids preferred the meatballs w/o the sauce.  Not everyone will like the spices in the sauce.  I served over rice and this made a lot.  I saved about half the meatballs to freeze for another time.

This was the best swedish meatball recipe I've ever made. I made them vegetarian using soy crumble, and it worked out fabulously. I followed the reccomendation to only use 1 T. sugar, and that seemed perfect as well. It was a considerable amount of work, but well worth the effort. I will definetely make these again.

Meatballs are ruined by the extremely sweet sauce.  If you omit the sugar this may be good.....I always try a recipe as written the first time.

Good meatball, but needs much less nutmeg. When I made them without nutmeg they were gobbled up by all!

The spices were very different - too strong and different for my family.  I thought it was OK but my family hated it.  We gave it to the dogs.  The recipe would be very good with fewer, more traditional spices.

This was way too sweet for me.  All I could taste was the sugar.  A lot of effort for a very O.K. outcome.

The sauce was interesting. It was edible, but different. Not sure if we'll make it again, but I love cardamon and enjoyed that aspect of the sauce.

I followed the recipe exactlly and they were way too sweet for us. I tried adding some sour cream and then some dry red wine and they still were not edible. I may try them again without using any sugar.  The spice blend was good just overpoweringly sweet.

This is very authentic. Better than my own recipe. Anyone that doesn't like this recipes doesn't like real Swedish food. I'm shocked that this doesn't have 1000 positive comments. You don't need msg and I use butter crackers instead.
