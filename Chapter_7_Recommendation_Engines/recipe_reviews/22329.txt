I tried this recipe out and it was really great!  I sauteed some onions & garlic (just a little), seasoned up the pork chops and cooked them fully.  I cooked the sliced potatoes seperately only to give them some color and when they were about done, I mixed the chops & taters together, added cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup (two cans each, we have a very large family) and heated it through.  It was GREAT and there were no left-overs for the next day.  Even my picky son ate two servings!!  Don't try this recipe without first seasoning the chops and adding a little seasoning to the potatoes, too; otherwise it will be way too bland.

I'm sorry but we did not like this at all.  The pork was bland and there was no flavor with the potatoes at all.  I don't think that I could give a true rating if I was going to change everything and add a ton of spices.  As written...too bland, but tinkering with spices your family likes will definately help with flavor.  I won't be making as written, but would try again with lots of spices. Thanks for the post.

Yum!  This is very close to a recipe I grew up with, baked by my mom.  She used to add about 1 tbl. of caraway seed to it. :)  Now, I add the caraway and a layer of thinly sliced onions, too.  Delish!

This was so good! My husband and kids loved it. The meat was very tender and the potatoes tasty. I added garlic powder, salt, pepper and onions and had it with fresh green beans. Delicious!

I seared my chops first with a good helping of onions and placed the mixture into my slow cooker along with garlic roasted mushroom soup and a lot more seasonings. Good base recipe but I think without the additons it would have been too bland for my gang. Thanks for a good start!

My husband, a meat and potatoes guy, loves this dish. I sprinkle a little onion soup mix over the potatoes before adding the cream soup. I usually make only two chops and the potatoes have room to brown nicely where they touch the pan. Gourmet it's not, just down-home good.

I took the advice of others and carmalized some onions, then added garlic along with the chops to the skillet.  I also added a couple shakes of beef bouillon granuals to the soup.  This meal was not only handy in a "quick fix" way, but it was tasty as well.  It did the trick for my fam.  The chops came out tender enough to cut with a butter knife, great served with fresh steamed green beans.  Thanks Valkyrja!

The only thing I changed with this recipe was I rubbed the chops with orgeno, salt and pepper. The I spinkled them with garlic powder when they were cooking. I also added more potatoes since I used 6 pork chops and I used 2 cans of mushrooms soup. This was SO GOOD! I will definitely make it again!

The *** I gave this was mostly my fault... Here's what I did: I sprinkled the pork chops with seasoning salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning before browning them with some chopped onion. To the soup, I added garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and chives. Now, here is where I probably made the mistake: Per previous comments, I wanted to make sure there was enough sauce, so I added a small can of evaporated milk. DO NOT ADD EVAPORATED MILK!! My potatoes ended up sticking to the bottom of the pan so bad that I was scraping overcooked/almost-burnt potato chunks out. The potatoes ended up tasting GREAT (even the overcooked, scraped-out bits!), but the chops didn't come out so well. My daughter ate some of the chops but both my husband and I were really not thrilled with the chops. They were really dry. Again, probably my fault. Next time, I'll either use the original recipe (plus seasonings) in the slow cooker or I'll just cook the potatoes in the soup and prepare the chops separately. Thanks for an interesting base recipe! *** UPDATED 12/14/05 - Made it again without the milk, same stuck-to-the-pan end. Must be my pan. It's easy and convenient, the taste is fine (once you spice up a regular can of soup)... But the chops weren't great and the baked-on factor means I probably won't make again.

I seasoned chops with salt, pepper, and oregano. Cooking onions in pan with pork chops (after chops are lightly browned) and using Progresso (uncondensed) mushroom soup made dish much more flavorful. Delicious, really.

This is actually a very good recipe if done right. First you would want to use a more fatty pork steak versus pork chop (this helps not only the flavor of the dish, but the flavor of the meat.) 
Before frying the pork, you need to coat it with flour. Then on med. high heat you brown the pork steak. Season with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic to taste. Make sure you just brown the meat on both sides, as it will finish cooking in the oven.
Slice your potatoes fairly thin (russet potatoes are best) as this will decrease your cooking time and your pork will not get too dry. Place potatoes in a prepared 13x9x2 cooking dish (spray with cooking spray.) By the way, this takes 6-8 large potatoes and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1 can of milk or evaporated milk.
Pour soup over potatoes, making sure to cover potatoes thoroughly. Save enough soup to pour over pork.
Place pork on top of potatoes and pour just enough soup down the middle of each pork steak, (do not smother.)
Cover with foil and bake at 375 for 35 to 45 minutes, or until juices run clear of meat and potatoes are tender.
Green beans any way, shape, or form are an excellent side dish for this meal.
I hope you enjoy this as much as my family and I do. My mom started making this dish for me when I was a little girl. I am now 50 years old and enjoy it now as much as I did then, and so does my family and friends.
Thanks,
Kim's Korner

This was a huge hit at my house!  My finicky 12-yr-old even had seconds.  This was very easy to prepare!  I prepared this in my electric skillet as it was roomier than my frying pan.  I did brown the chops with onions and garlic in a very small amount of olive oil.  Very, very good.  My family can't wait to have it again!

No doubt, this is an easy recipe. I made a couple of modafications because my wife and daughter have Celiac disease and can not have gluten. Every condensed cream soup has wheat, so I have to make my own. Take 3 Tbls of gluten free flour and mix it over med/high heat with 3 Tbls of melted butter, add 1 cup of broth or water slowly and reduce heat and season. Being we're working with pork I used baccon greese instead of butter...thats right cream of baccon soup. I added green bell pepper to the mix and seasoned with tyme, oregeno, sage, season all, salt, and pepper. I noticed that it did'nt mention a cooking heat so I did it on medium and it was pull apart tender. Good recipe all in all.

I seasoned with salt, pepper and oregano before putting in my cast iron on med high. When they were about done I added the potatoes and soup and made sure the potatoes were well coated. After that I put the whole pan in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes (though I think 30 would have been better for the potatoes).My husband and I loved this.

This has become a family favorite. I do add dry onion soup mix and sometimes saute some onions and garlic.  It is a easy delicious meal!

Very easy and filling.  My husband liked the flavor much more than I did.  I thought it was kind of bland, even though i also sauteed onions and garlic with the pork chops.  I may try it again with some variations to liven it up a bit.

Yum!  I actually made the pork chops without the potatoes, and it was very easy!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and sauteed some onions in the pan, and I also used some parsley and garlic powder to add some flavor!  With these small changes, it was a very delicious and SO easy!  Thanks!

I can see how if you only make this recipe according to the instructions given, you wouldn't like it.  Here's what I did and it came out great!  Season chops with salt, pepper and granulated garlic.  Saute chopped onion, celery and garlic - set aside.  Brown the chops in same pan.  Add sauteed veggies.  Add the shroom soup (I used Amy's organic cream of mushroom soup in place of the freaky brand name MSG soups) and potatoes.  Simmer covered as directed.  YUM!

I made the recipe exactly as listed and it was just OK.  I was surprised that the potatoes ended up mushy (almost like mashed potatoes) but the soup got mostly absorbed so there wasn't the creamy sauce I expected.  If I make it again, I will add some water and shorten the cooking time.

DH loved this casserole!  I thought it was ok.  I did season the chops with salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder.  Also added two slices of onion.  Next time I may brown the chops a little more and carmelize the onions for a little more flavor.
Make sure to turn down the heat to low or medium low after adding the potatoes and soup.  Both were deliciously tender after 45 minutes!

I made it exactly like the recipe called for, and the soup cooked down to nothing and the pork and potatoes were overcooked.  I did like the taste, all I added was salt and pepper.  Next time, I plan on adding lots of mushrooms and watching it better so nothing overcooks.  It was a very easy and potentially delicious recipe!

The other half seemed to enjoy this as a change of pace, more than a meal.  I'm just so-so with it;  it wasn't bad, but it lacked any strong flavors it would need to really push it over the top (plus, the consistancy of the potatoes was a bit mushier than I would've preferred).  Others have mentioned putting onions in it;  if I try this again, the onions will definitely be included.

This is a great weeknight dinner. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked it in the oven. I also added a sprinkling of salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chops before browning. I topped the sliced potatoes with a sprinkling of dried onion flakes, before adding the mushroom soup. The chops came out tender and tasty. Plus the potatoes started to brown around the edges and were creamy and delicious. This recipe is a keeper with the few changes that I made. My adult son who doesn't care for porkchops ate two of them.

I made this recipe today for my wife and I. I used 1" thick boneless sirloin chops and browned them very well in a hot skillet. They came out tender and juicy and we both loved the potatoes which were cooked perfectly. I added a little chopped onion and about a 1/2 cup of chopped celery. Very good and tasty. Will make this again and again.

Easy recipe to prepare.  Like others, I added spices to meat. Family enjoyed the flavour of the potatoes and mushroom combination.

I used cream of chicken and I cut the chops into bite sized peices.  It was very good and tasty.  I will add more liquid next time though.  I will make this again!

Like everyone else I added seasoning to my pork chops (seasoning salt, paprika, garlic powder and pepper).  I was feeding five people, so I put my in a 13x9, covered with foil and did it in the oven.  Still the same amount of time.  It turned out great.  The pork chops were supper tender (I hate tough pork chops).  And the potatos were soft too.  We will be doing this one again.

I give this a 5 just for the ease of it. You should have no problem seasoning this dish to your families taste. If you look at the ingredients as written, you should be able to tell if you would want more spices in it. Some people dont over season their food, if they season at all.. I'm sure the soup mix would be sufficient for flavor to someone who just throws the chops (or whatever you're cooking) in the oven and bake them plain, as I have seen many do. My mother included. Anyway, I just put the chops (without browning) or potatoes, which ever I have ready first in the pan followed by the other. Whip up the soup mix, adding garlic, pepper, or whatever I feel like putting in that night. Pour it over the chops and potatoes and bake. Simple, quick and delicious. The whole family loved it. Thank You!!

All in all it is a good recipe but to add some flavor I always add onion to it...just slice them up in O's and add it to the soup mixture before adding it to the oven..just a little tip :)

The pork was very tender, but all in all, the recipe was extremely bland.  I even stopped cooking 10 minutes early, because the soup mixture was completely cooking down to nothing.  I was expecting more of a casserole (creamy) taste and look to it, but it was just pork and potatoes when it was said and done.  I think with some tweaking, this recipe could be delicious.  Thanks for sharing it!

Easy, taste was very good but the potatoes & chops turned an unappetizing grey when cooked in the oven (left at 275 degrees for 1 1/2 hrs. while at soccer practice).  Will make again in electric skillet or on top of stove.  Added some onions and sliced mushrooms.

This was great.  I've made pork chops like this before with mashed potatoes for the gravy.  This was a nice alternative.  I used cream of chicken soup instead and also added onions and mushrooms.  The chops and potatoes were wonderful.  I used an electric skillet and simmered everything slowly.  Very good.

I think I will try it again with the onion soup. I drained a can of campbells gumbo and used the broth I also added 2 carrots and one stalk of celery. It was very like stew and was delicious to eat. I had salad with it and it was very filling even with the thin cut chops I had in the fridge. the chops only needed 20 but the vegetables needed 40. The chops were moist and juicy.

We did not care for this. Seasoned the pork chops with special rubs I had, browned potatoes separately, used Golden Mushroom soup as it is more flavorful.

I tried this last night. I browned the chops with masala powder for a kick, sauted onions, garlic and 1 chilli together with some red bell peppers and the soup and baked covered. Chops were tender and the chilli and masala was a nice kick. Will be making again

This was pretty good and easy.  My only change was that I added spices to the meat.  I couldn't imagine not adding a little.  Anyway, next time I'll try adding some fresh mushrooms and maybe a little cheese.

Potatoes were great, but I think there are better ways to prepare pork chops. Rather bland, even seasoned with garlic salt as a previous reviewer recommended.

Flavor was good and this didn't require a lot of thinking-I always appreciate that when cooking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe-I was having a pork chop emergency!
