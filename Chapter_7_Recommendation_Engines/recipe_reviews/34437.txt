Thsi first time I made this i followed the recipe, however it turned out a little tasetless. The next time while cooking the chicken i added some balsamic vinegar. I added italian spices and crushed red pepper to the sauce which made it much more flavourful. Oh and to make it low fat I used milk instead of cream and it turned out great!

Great flavor! I did season the chicken before sauteing -- and I substituted portobella mushroom slices for the shitake.  Next time I will use more mushrooms and more sauce.  It needed a little more of both. Both my husband and son said this was a definite "thumbs up".  This would also be good with a little broccoli tossed in ...

My husband loved this recipe as much as I did. I found it at the last minute because I wanted to use the portabello mushrooms in my fridge. It was quick and I am happy to have found it. The only adjustment I made was to double the mushroom sauce. We like our pasta very wet and figured if there were leftovers some would absorb into the pasta. I added grated pecorino romano cheese. It was perfect. Yummm :)

I served this with Isaiah's Pretzel Fried Chicken so I didn't add the chicken to the dish. I didn't have shiitakes but I did have baby bellas. (Costco sells huge packages for about five dollars.) Because mushrooms soak up butter when you saute with it, I did add a couple more tbsp. When I plated it, I sprinkled some fresh grated parmesan over the top of each serving. The flavor of the pasta, the cream, onions and mushrooms was a winning combination. We ate every little bit. I'm SO making this again. My husband calls this "Snooty Mac and Cheese". I can only imagine what it would be with the chicken. NOTE: If you plan on making this with the chicken, you might want to make a recipe and a half of the sauce. Without adding the chicken to mine, the sauce was just enough. I'd also add garlic next time.

Loved this.  Very easy.  Used half and half and increased it by 1/2 cup.  Also added 3 cloves garlic and a little flour to thicken the sauce.

Simple, straight-forward recipe -- it's great for when you don't want to fuss with dinner too much!  I sliced my mushrooms and doubled the amount (we like a lot of mushrooms), and added assorted additional seasonings to spice things up a bit, since the one danger with this recipe is the potential of being a bit bland.

This is quite creamy and also quite flavourful. I intentionally over cooked the onion to get a bit of a charred sweetness, and I added the mushrooms early to sautee them a bit. I also added half a clove of minced garlic to the sauteed onions for added flavour. Mistakenly, I used 10% cream as opposed to heavy cream, but added flour to help with the thickening. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  My husband loved it.  I used a light table cream instead of the heavy cream and just added a little flour to thicken it up.  I also simmered the chicken in the sauce for a half hour or so.  I doubled the mushrooms and added extra pepper and salt.  Easy and simple... would make this for guests

I loved this recipe! It's the first actual recipe I attempted, because normally I just throw whatever into my sauces. They always come out well, but I didn't know how to make just a regular cream sauce. In the last five minutes after you've put in the chicken, I add some freshly grated parmesan. It's so yum!

This was delicious, and I didn't even use cream -- to save some calories and lower my fat intake, I used whole milk and chicken stock instead.  I added a little nutmeg and some hot pepper flakes.  Can't wait to make it again.

I didn't have heavy cream but used Campbells Cream of Mushroom soup instead.1 can of soup is very very salty and makes a lot, I ended up adding in garlic, vegetable stock, milk, chopped celery, bacon, cheese and some ketchup. Substituted oyster mushrooms for shitake as thats all I had. End result was quite tasty eaten with crusty garlic bread (recipe also from this site)...with all the additions made, was also good as a stew.

This wouldn't have been as good if I hadn't made some modifications. I mixed others suggestions with my own ideas, since I'm feeding a 20 mos old with this. He loved it! I added frozen peas, minced garlic, fresh basil, and some grated Parmesan, and some diced tomatoes that I threw on top after it was on the plate. Delicious! (Note: I used frozen shitake mushrooms that were presliced). This was quite fast for the flavor! I wish I would have made more for leftovers!

I really enjoyed this.  I omitted the chicken and doubled the mushrooms as another reviewer suggested.  Although I am sure it would be great with the chicken, I just try to eat less meat these days.

The key for me is to stick with the recipe but use fresh ingredients. Fresh mushrooms and cream with homemade pasta is wonderful. The only drawback is overeating.

This was great. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. As others suggested, I added veggies like onions, bell pepper, onions, mixed veggies. I steamed the chicken in taco seasoning to give it more flavor. Husband loved it, served over rice.

I thought this was Great!!  It was simple and delicious.  I took others advise and marinated the chicken for an hour or so just to give it some flavor.  My onions were extra sweet and really made the dish.  I'm planning on making this for a family dinner when my sister and mom come to visit.

Simple and tasty. I used more mushrooms, also added some grated carrot, frozen peas,fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, black pepper. I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder before cooking it. The family loved this one, I like that I can sneak in some veggies. We also put some cheese on top.

Since reading the other reviews showed that it was bland, I took one of the reviews' advice and added balsamic vinegar to the chicken as it cooked. I also added canned stewed tomatoes, which brought out the flavor. It still needed salt, but me and my friends made the batch for about 20 people so we decided to leave it as it was. Overall, it was pretty tasty and most people had seconds!

One of our new favorites!  I did add garlic with the onions and sauteed them with the mushrooms before adding the cream.  This is a fantastic recipe!

I changed the essence a bit by using shallot instead of onion and chanterelle mushrooms. I also didn't have much chicken, so I diced it fine, the same texture as the mushrooms. Plenty of flavor. I can't imagine making this any other way now!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not, but my dish did not turn out like the picture so it was not what I had expected. It would have been better if there was more flavor. I even added garlic like others suggested but no such luck.

This recipe is outstanding!!  I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms but my boyfriend loves them so I decided to try this.  I added thyme, sage, black pepper and crushed red pepper.  I also substituted milk (2 cups) and corn starch for the heavy cream.  It was fantastic!!

I thought that this was a wonderful recipe! Very tasty. I used sliced crimini mushrooms instead of Shiitaki (the Shiitaki mushrooms didn't look very good at my local grocery store). I will definitely be making this again!

I love because the recipe is easy and only 2 main ingredients involve. I season the chicken for 1/2 hour,cook it after i sauteed the mushroom,onion and garlic. I used light cream and added bit of flour. Add alot of pepper and seasoning pepper and it will taste good. My family love it and definitely ill do it again

this was a really tasty and easy dish. i'm just learning how to cook, but even i was able to put it together without much difficulty. i think i'd probably grill the chicken on a george foreman for expediancy sake next time and add some additional herbs. all in all, a good go-to dish

This was so blah and I spent so much time trying to make this edible. As written, it is nothing. I added garlic, rosemary, thyme, generous amounts of salt and pepper, chicken broth, more heavy cream, parmesan cheese, nutmeg, a tub of Aloette. You get the picture. By the time, it was all said and done, we had dinner but it was nothing like the original recipe. Used button mushrooms instead of shitake.

I make this recipe vegetarian, omitting the chicken and doubling the mushrooms. Using sugar-free soy milk instead of cream and adding 2 tsp vegetarian oyster sauce for extra flavour when sauteeing the mushrooms in the beginning. For picky eaters, I omit the onions completely, and instead of salt I use flavour enhancer (a pinch of MSG towards the end).

Turned out all right, but seemed to be lacking in something. The addition of seasonings or more veggies might spruce it up a bit; the dish (even though I added some garlic salt to the sauce as well as seasoning the chicken while sauteeing) was just too plain on its own.

Pretty good pasta dish. And it made a lot, enough for 7 to 8 servings ! I knew this dish would be little bland for my taste as is. So, I  added  some garlic powder and some dried herbs beside the salt and pepper to both the chicken and the onion/mushrooms, and some grated Permesan cheese when the sauce had thickened. Also, I used extra mushrooms and half&half for cream. There wasn't enough sauce for the amount of pasta and chicken. I would up the sauce next time or reduce the pasta amount.

Tried this for the first time last night and it was very good! Made a few changes. I added garlic for a little extra flavor and seasoned the chicken before I sautéed it. I also used penne pasta instead of bow tie just because that is my favorite pasta.  I used only 3/4 of a 16oz box and it was plenty.   I also used button mushrooms but might add more mushrooms next time for flavor.  I'll probably use a whole pint of heavy cream for extra sauce because I found myself with not enough sauce to coat the pasta and will probably add Parmesan cheese into the sauce for an extra flavor! But overall I absolutely loved it!
