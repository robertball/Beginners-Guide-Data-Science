This flan is delicious.  I prepared it two days ago, but I made a couple changes: Instead of using regular milk, i added one cup evaporated milk and a can of coconut milk and it was great!
Advice: Be careful for not over cooking the sugar for the syrup, it may get bitter.

This was so easy to make that I was suspicious.  However, I served this to a dinner party of 8 people and it was fantastic.  It tasted fabulous and the texture/consistency was perfect.  I served with a dollop of whip cream and some fresh quartered oranges and dark chocolate on the side.  Even the guests who do not normally like dessert were raving!

I was looking for a recipe to replicate the coconut flan I had while in Costa Rica.  This recipe came very close!  I didn't do the sugar layer, only the flan itself.  Maybe next time, I will do the entire recipe as described.  My husband and co-workers all agree this is a good recipe!

This was fantastic!  I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and splenda inside the flan while using real sugar for the carmelized part.  I baked it in ramekins in a pan of water.  The texture was perfection and the taste was wonderful!  Even my egg-boycotting daughter loved every bite!

Served this flan to the family after a very spicy dinner of Chile Colorado and 6 of us ate 3/4 of the whole thing and then the kids fought over the last piece - it was delicious! Swapped out the evaporated milk for coconut milk, left the sugar out of the egg mixture, added 1 teaspoon of Mexican vanilla as previous reviewers have suggested. I put 1/4 cup water with the sugar for the caramel mixture - this will help control the sugar browning process. Poured the caramel into a preheated 10" x 1.5" round pyrex dish with straight sides. I cooked the flan in a water bath. Be sure not to use a good dish towel for this as it bled the color out of a good towel. Next time I may try it with out the water bath method as it adds a lot of work. Also I forgot to pre-heat the water for the water bath and this extended the time of cooking to almost 90 minutes! Once cooked I let cool for 15 minutes and then ran a knife around the outside edge. Since we were going to eat dinner in about 2 hours I put the flan in the freezer for about an hour and then moved to the refrigerator. After dinner (about 3 hours after the flan came out of the oven) I put a serving plate over the top of the pyrex dish and then inverted it so the flan came out on top of the serving dish and out of the pyrex. The caramel flowed beautifully over the top and down the sides - it looked perfect. Not only was I surprised how good it all came out, my family was equally impressed and I am now considered Chef Extrordinaire!

I didn't like it but everyone else liked it in the house. It didn't last more than a day! I think it's because I am not a chocolate lover. Be careful when putting the chocolate cake mix on top of the flan. You have to put it on very gentle in order to keep both layers seperated.

This is a good flan recipe. I made this, however my family isn`t flan lover.  The texture was creamy and tender. I didn`t add sugar into the milk mixture.

My favorite coconut flan is the one on this site by Milly Suazo (Coconut Cheese Flan). However, that one calls for cream cheese and I was making a flan for a friend who doesn't care much about cream cheese. So, I decided to give this one a try. I wanted the coconut flavor to be noticeable so I did as many suggested and replaced the evaporated milk with a 14 oz can of lite coconut milk and omitted the extra regular milk. The flan came out good but I wasn't wowed by it. Everyone else seemed to enjoy it a lot. I think the coconut flavor didn't stand out as much as it could have. Also, flans are made in a water bath, please don't skip that step. I've made hundreds of flans over the years and for the last 15 years I have always made the caramel in the microwave. Put the sugar and some water in a Pyrex cup and heat on high for 10-15 minutes until it turns amber. Handle with care. You can use that same caramel to make decorations for the flan. Wait until it starts to harden a bit and drizzle it on top of parchment paper. When it dries up (in a minute or two) you can lift up the decoration and use it to top the flan once you have flipped it and it's ready to be served.

Two "firsts" on one day (yesterday)- cracking a coconut AND making flan!  A great success - a great recipe.  I read and followed some other's notes: used canned coconut milk in place of evap. milk, used half heavy cream and half 2% milk for the 1/2 cup of milk, added about 1 tsp Mexican vanilla and about 3/4 tsp coconut extract (only because I happened to have some). I sprinkled about 1 T. of the finely shredded coconut over the top before baking (next time I'll try toasting it first). I did bake in a water bath to ensure even cooking, and perfectly done in 45 min., as per the recipe.  Another good trick, as someone suggested, is to place your empty baking dish in the oven to warm up good before you pour in the caramel - it coats smoothly and beautifully with no effort!! I'm sure it would come out just as wonderful using the evap. milk.  The most difficult part is WAITING to eat it!  (No one waited 9 hours....and now it's ALL GONE!)

First time making Flan fun, making Flan the first time for others to enjoy, nerve racking! Smiles on guest faces and compliments... Priceless! I read through the reviews first. I'm glad I did. Adding the 1/2c sugar to the custard would have been way too much! As is was the flan was quite sweet. When I made the caramel I had started the oven and put the pan that the flan was going to be assembled in on the oven vent to get hot. When the sugar was melted to the color I wanted, I poured it into the hot pan and tipped it to evenly spread the mixture and set aside to cool. I made two versions of the flan. One with condensed milk and evaporated milk for a plain flan and topped it with some dark chocolate peels and a raspberry sauce. Flan 2, I used the condensed milk and coconut milk, with the shredded coconut in the mix and then topped it with toasted coconut peels. Several people asked for the recipes and couldn't believe I've never made flan before! Had to admit that I was so nervous when it was time to turn the flan out onto the serving plates with so many people watching! I thought for sure the caramel was going to stick to the pan!! But all the Oooo's and Ahaaaa's said it all though! Thanks for a great recipe to work with!

Even with replacing the evaporated milk with coconut milk, the taste of coconut was very subtle.  However this recipe deserves 5 stars because this was the best flan I've ever tasted.  I had never made flan before, so I followed other reviews and used a water bath and made sure not to over-cook the sugar.
UPDATE: I made this again using cream of coconut instead of evaporated milk and frozen shredded coconut and it was so good!  Much more pronounced coconut flavor.

I took the advice of some of the other readers, and used coconut milk instead of evaporated milk, skipped adding the half cup of sugar, and used heavy cream instead of milk. The result was fantastic. I brought it to a Cuban themed dinner party, and everyone loved it and went back for seconds.

YUM!  I made this for my Dad's B-day and everyone keeps asking me to make it again!  This recipe is very similar to traditional family recipes I have tried before, but the coconut  took it to another level.  Since other reviews indicated that the coconut taste was mild I decided to use one cup of shredded coconut in in addition to substituting the evaporated milk for coconut milk.  I also added a teaspoon of almond extract and did not use the 1/2 cup of sugar in the mix.  It turned out great and was very surprised at how easy it wast to make!  Will def make again.  One tip, I melted the sugar in a nonstick pot and it took way too long to brown (35 min), I will use a metal pot next time as recommended in other recipes.

Left out the additional 1/2 cup of sugar as others did.  I thought it was sweet enough without it.  I took advise from others who have made flan and warmed up my dish in an oven while it was preheating so that the carmel wouldn't harden too quickly.  Worked perfectly.

Flan is big in my circle and this flan is one of the best we tried. I did not have evaporated milk so I substituted that with the same amount of coconut milk and cut the sugar to 1/2 or 2/3 of suggestion. And it was a crowd pleaser. People could not get enough even after I doubled batch it already. Thanks for the recipe!

Quite a good recipe; the taste of the coconut flakes is excellent, though beware of burning and clumpiness on the sides and bottom of the dish - I would recommend baking this in a hot water bath just to even out the texture.

Great Flan! My husband is Cuban and he says it's JUST like his mom makes ; ) I made a couple small modifications as well: I don't add the 1/2 cup sugar nor the 1/2 cup milk to the custard mix and I use only 5 eggs. Straining the mix through a fine mesh before baking makes the texture MUCH nicer......yummy!

Overall, the flavor and texture of this recipe were excellent.  I made it for a luncheon at work, and it was very popular.  This was my first time making flan, and it took me a good 30 minutes to get the sugar melted and get everything assembled.  I had some clumps of sugar that did not want to incorporate into the caramel sauce, and I was afraid of overcooking it, so I gently broke them up with a fork and they melted right in.  I substituted coconut milk for the 1/2 cup of regular milk, and added 1 tsp. of Mexican vanilla.  Next time I will probably leave out the 1/2 cup of sugar.  A useful bit of information would be the proper size of the baking dish.  I used a 2.5 quart 8" diameter Corningware dish, and I think it was too small.  I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes to get the flan to set.  I think the extra cooking time caused some problems with the caramel.  When I turned it out the next morning, there was still a lot of the caramel stuck to the bottom of the dish, and it was hard like candy.  Fortunately, there was just enough liquid caramel to salvage the flan.

Very nice.  I substituted coconut milk because I didn't have evaporated milk on hand.  I didn't put any coconut flakes in either. I made this recipe once before and followed it more closely.  Both times it has turned out well.  There is another recipe for flan on this site I enjoy more though.  It adds cream cheese to the mix (which I'm sure you could do here). It is less authentic of course, but very creamy and less eggy in flavor.

Very yummy and easy flan. Everyone who had it, instantly loved it. I did however make a very small change to the recipe. I substituted the 1/2 cup milk with its equivelant of heavy cream. This made the flan creamier. I also bake my flan in a water bath in the oven. This helps the texture of the flan. Thanks Esther for a great recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! The texture was perfect. I replaced the evaporated milk with a can of coconut milk and still kind of wished it had even more of a coconut flavor, so definitely don't worry about that subsitution being too overwhelming.

Excellent recipe. This recipe can be made with less eggs--4 or 5 can also do and you can leave out the 1/2 cup of sugar if you don't want it too sweet. Otherwise, great recipe!

I really liked this recipe. I did what another reviewer suggested and used coconut milk instead of the milk. And, I used 4 oz. less the evaporated milk. Delicious!!!

Great recipe! I didn't even use coconut, but this was great for regular flan too. I added a tsp of vanilla and baked it in a muffin tin for about twenty minutes in a water bath. Very good!

I didn't add sugar to custard since I used sweetened coconut.  Very tasty!  Be careful not to over cook or else the texture is like hard gelatin.  I had lots of caramel linger in pan though.

These were reminiscent of the Coconut Flan we had in Costa Rica last year. It turned out very well and was surprisingly easy. I used the coconut milk instead of the evaporated milk as other reviewers suggested. It turned out very smooth and the flavor of coconut was just right!

I used 1/2c coconut créme coffee creamer, and therefore omitted the extra half cup sugar, milk and coconut. It provided enough coconut flavor, and there was ample sweetness from the condensed milk. I had to drink some milk to wash down all the sweet! The "caramel" was a failure. It didn't taste altogether burned, but it certainly didn't give my flan any flair. I baked in a 9" pie dish, but there was more milk mixture than space in my dish, so I put the remaining extras in a 9"square, and put that in a water bath since it didn't have caramel in the bottom. When I inverted the square, it didn't come out, Duh, so I cut it down the middle, and lay it in a plate with a spatula. The pie plate did invert easily. Between the two, they are okay, but because of the overcooked sugar, i did prefer the square.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is I'm not sure what a flan should taste like! However, I really enjoyed this recipe. Something I learned from other flan recipes is to turn finished flan onto serving plate; I had no idea you were supposed to do that as this recipe assumes you know. Very tasty though.

My mil (mother-in-law) LOVES flan...she has been known to order two, when we've gone for mexican.  She loves this version.  I didn't have a lot of luck with the sugar syrup the first couple of times I made it, so...the name of the game is improvisation!  Maple syrup or carmel latte syrup.  Pour into the bottom of the pan before you pour in the coconut egg mixture!  When you invert the flan, if you don't end up with enough glaze, just pour a little more over the top, and everybody's happy!  Enjoy!

was never a fan of flan until i made this! this is soooo good. I subbed in a can of coconut milk and used fresh shredded coconut that i toasted in the toaster oven before putting in the flan. This is so good! Everyone who tried it loved it. It's rich creamy and delicious! Thank You!

This is the 3rd flan I've made but it's the only one that impressed my 86 year old father-in-law from Puerto Rico. The family absolutely loved it. Others have suggested baking it in a bath which I'll try next time because I left some of the caramel in the dish when I turned it out. Other than that, the dish was amazing.

Unreal.  And just got better with age.  I know because the leftovers that stayed in the frige for a few days were even better and more beautifully permeated with gorgeous caramel color than when I first served it.  I, too, had trouble with the caramel hardening too quickly so I kept microwaving it in short bursts to get it to flow over more of the plate.  Turns out this wasn't necessary since the flan is watery enough to liquify that layer to perfection as it sets and it oozes nicely around the entire pan.

Great recipe!  I made this for hubby's squadron luncheon and they raved!!!  I made this the first time and it bombed (I have no idea what I did wrong, but I was determined to try again).
The caramel/sugar coat hardened too fast so I had to make several sugar batches in order to cover all of the bottom of the glassware. Oh!  I almost forgot to mention that I took the advice of someone of this site and added a can of coconut milk to the mix along with everything else since I didn't have shaved coconut on hand.  It still tasted great.

Very good. I liked that it had a  mix of evaporated and sweetened condensed milks. I did not add sugar to the egg mixture, agreeing that the caramel sauce would add enough sweetness.

Delicious !! Just like the one I make for years but I do not use the sugar(1 1/2 cups) the sweetened condensed milk and the caramel sauce makes it sweet enough. It can also be made with regular milk. I also usse a water bath to bake it.

I tried this recipe and it turned out really good. My only problem was: there was way too much sugar in it. Next time that i will try it, i will probably put less sugar

Very good and very easy flan.  I had a bit of trouble with the sugar syrup, but the actual custard came out very nice.  The only changes I made was to add a bit of coconut extract to make it extra coconutty and I baked it in a water bath.  Came out perfect (except the sugar syrup I overcooked!)

I made this for my boyfriend and his family once and it lasted all of a few hours. They eat flan like most people drink water and never have they had coconut in it! Since then I have been asked maybe twenty times in two months to make it again! I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe! Prepared pretty much as described except that I substituted the milk for cream and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup. Great texture and taste. Next time I will add more fresh coconut and reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.

I made this exactly according to the directions. What a disaster. Directions say to run a knife along the sides and refrigerate overnight. Needless to say, the Carmel rehardened and now it is stuck in the pan as you can see. If I was supposed to turn out before refrigeration, the directions should have said so.

I swapped coconut cream for the 1/2 cup of milk and left out the extra sugar in the custard. One very picky flan-lover ate 3 slices and said it was the best she's ever had!

This recipe won't work at high altitude. I live a 6800 ft, maybe that was the problem. The taste was great, but the texture was grainy. I have made flan many times but couldn't find my regular recipe. I thought 350 was a little high, I usually bake them in a water bath at 325. Great taste, but texture was  off.

Fantastic!  I also used heavy cream instead of milk and a can of coconut milk instead of evaporated milk like others suggest and left out the 1/2 cup sugar.   Having never made this before, I was confused when the caramel went super hard in the glass plate before I added the custard, as I thought it would 've stayed liquid.  But I was relieved at the end of the baking time - it did become a liquid again.  I baked in the oven at 350C in a water bath, took about 10 minutes longer but really gave it a nice smooth texture.    Will make this many more times!

This is a good basic recipe for flan, but if you REALLY want intense coconut flavor, make the following changes:   #1 - substitute sweetened condensed coconut milk (such as Coco Lopez) for the regular sweetened condensed milk and #2 substitute coconut milk for the condensed milk.  As the last step, sprinkle some sweetened shredded coconut over the top of the flan before covering and baking.  If you follow these alterations, you will end up with a flan that has an extremely intense coconut flavor.

This is amazing, with a little changes. 
I used an extra 1/2 cup of milk and used 1%, omitted the sugar for blended ingredients, used blender to mix and threw a handful of almonds because I love nuts! Also 1 tbsp off vanilla, no water bath. Took it to a couple's house for bible study and was a total hit, I immediately got home and had to make another one for the family.

I prepared this today and it was lovely. Like many others, I made some changes. I did not add the 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of milk, or the 6 eggs (I used 5 large jumbo eggs). I figured since the condensed milk is filled with sugar, adding another 1/2 would over do it. I also added 1 tablespoon of white vanilla extract and added 1 cup of fresh shredded coconut instead of 1/2 cup. Although I did not follow the exact instructions in this recipe, I am still grateful for having found this one!

I added fresh coconut and blended it in the blender…. I also added a little bit of chocolate, cinnamon and Oaxaca cheese for texture…. i really reccomend it!!! Instead of baking it by itself in the oven, you should bake it in another pan of water so it doesn't burn, since i have a small electric oven, that was perfect!

Overall, this was a very good, easy to follow recipe.  Everyone who tried it enjoyed it.  However it did taste a little bit to "egg" for me.  So I think the next time I cook this I would remove a yolk or 2.

I'm in charge of dessert for a girlfriend's weekend so decided to try this out.  I'm so glad I did; it totally reminds me of the filling my Mom put in her custard pie.  It was always a favorite of my Dad & I.  mmmmm, comfort food!  I'll be making another one next Thursday in anticipation of our Mexican fiesta dinner on Friday!

I had tried to make flan before and maybe it was me, but it didn't turn out as good as this one. This recipe is easy to follow and my flan turned out great. The only change I made was that I used coconut milk, instead of regular milk and I didn't add the shredded coconut. Next time I will.

I did not use sugar and exchanged the evaporated milk with coconut milk and it taste perfect!
