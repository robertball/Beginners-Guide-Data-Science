We didn't measure the snow, probably had way more than what the recipe calls for. The snow was icy but still yummy-  more like a snow cone. Kids mixed chocolate syrup in theirs.

This is the easiest snow cream recipe out there! I did use more snow than what the recipe calls for, I used 12-13 cups instead of 8. This made it more of an ice cream like consistency. Note- I used vanilla bean paste... that isn't dirt in my snow cream pic,lol.
