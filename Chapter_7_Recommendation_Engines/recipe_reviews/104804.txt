I agree that it is a great starter. I took an Indian twist with this one--double the curry, some cucumber, some onion, and some golden raisins (this makes it!). I also used half the amount of mayonnaise and substituted the rest with yogurt.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 instead of a 5 because as written I found it a little boring but it's a great start.  We ended up adding some season salt, garlic, paprika, and a small onion.  We found it too creamy and it did not make enough for 4 sandwiches so next time I will use 6 eggs and keep the mayo the same.  That being said, it's a really great base to start with and we will be making this frequently.

First I used a homemade coleslaw dressing instead of plain mayo. I used red onion. I didn't have any bread so I made some rolls with pancake mix. Just use a 2 to 1 ratio with milk. (2 cups mix, 1 cup milk.) Kneed the dough, on pancake floured surface. The biscuts were sweet, and it went great with the egg salad. I will make this again!

I really like the addition of curry to egg salad, however as another reviewer mentioned, the recipe as-is is rather boring.  I jazzed mine up a bit with pickle relish, dash of mustard, red pepper, minced onion, and parsley.

Wow!  The best egg sandwich ever!  I use 12 grain bread, slightly toasted and it is just yummy!  Everyone loves it.  Thank you for sharing.  God bless.

I always thought egg salad sandwiches were missing something. It was missing curry! Gives it a little tangy bite. Will use a little bit less curry in the future and add chopped green onion like I usually do... but this is a great idea!

I have been making a different version of this recipe for over 30 years (more like some of the other reviewers suggested).  This concept is great, but it just doesn't have that extra *oomph* quality needed to make it truly outstanding.

As is, I gave the recipe three stars.  The egg salad tasted good but was missing oomph.  Once I threw in green onions, olives, and celery it became a four star sandwich.

I love this recipe.  I'm not sure if it is the type of curry that we used (Penzey's) but my husband and I LOVED this!  We did not find it as boring as others but I could see spicing it up a bit.  I may try that next time.  I did add 1 teaspoon of dried, chopped onions and used 6 eggs instead of 4 like other reviewers had suggested.  I may even add an extra egg next time I make it.  Fantastic and thanks so much for the great idea!  Yum!

I used this recipe as a guide. Used a heaping spoon of mayo, added finely chopped celery, onion, dash of mustard, dash of tumeric, dried parsley. I added  salt and it was way too salty. Next time I will obmit it all together. Love the curry!

I think curry in an egg sandwich is delicious. I did have to add a few more things though or the curry is very over powering. I added 2 tbsp of green onion, 1 tsp of paprika, s&p and I added cheese and lettuce to the sandwiches.

Quite good, nice and easy twist to just plain egg. I added garlic powder to mine too.. I also put tomato on the sandwiches, egg can get too heavy on its own otherwise.

My 3 kids, ranging from 13 to 6, and I all loved this recipe. Although, I too made some additions; ground mustard, spicy Indian Curry powder, onion and garlic powder, french onion dip, paprika and a little powdered sugar. YUM! It turned out great!

I love curried egg salad sandwiches but this has too much mayo and not enough seasonings.  I use a heaping TBS of mayo along with a 1/8 tsp dijon mustard, a little chopped onion, a sprinkling of celery salt, and pepper, a dash of cayenne and any dried herb I'm craving. If I have celery in the house, delete the celery salt and replace with kosher salt.  Hope you like it.

Very blah. Egg amount should be doubled (Or mayo halved). I follow the recipe "delicious egg salad for sandwiches" by wifeyloves2cook and add a teaspoon of curry powder to that. Delicious!

I love eggs and I love curry.  This was so easy and it was delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and I wouldn't change a thing.  From now on this will be my egg salad recipe to go to.

Adding curry is a great idea for egg salad. I liked it. I didn't change the recipe, but I know if I were making this for my husband, it would need some additions. As far as servings, I cut the recipe in half and ate the whole thing.

5.9.17   If you're an egg salad fan and like curry,  you'll go bonkers over this sandwich.  Over the past several years, I've grown to love curry and thoroughly enjoyed this combination (and even added a bit more curry to it).

Really yummy idea for a starter. I added diced red onions, diced celery, sweet pickle relish and some parsley. The curry really kicked my usual egg salad up a notch!

Have made curried eggs in many forms for a number of years. This particular one needs more curry.

This was pretty good, but a little bland like others said.  A good base to work with though and add other ingredients.

Good recipe, I think a little plain though. I added dired cilantro to the mixture as well as a srpinkle of nutmeg. Tasted wonderful on toasted wheat bread.
