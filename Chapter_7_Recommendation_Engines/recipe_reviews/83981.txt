This was great! We omitted the onion and pepper and substituted chicken as we already had a lot of vegetable side dishes. We marinated for about 2 hours, then did shrimp, pineapple, chicken, pineapple and more shrimp. YUM!

Quite simple to make (after peeling and deveining shrimp of course)...My family loved the chipotle flavor--a very good marinade!

Unfortunately, the marinade didn't "wow" me at all - I marinated the shrimp for approximately two hours, and it really overpowered the taste of the shrimp...as a side note, I used Lawry's Tequila Lime and Caribbean Jerk on chicken and beef - they were terrible.  I am going back to making my marinades from scratch - it's well worth the effort!

Sooo good!  I made this camping and it was a huge hit.  I just used a chipolte marinade.  Great Summer and cook-out food.
