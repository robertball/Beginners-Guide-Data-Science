As written, this recipe would warrant a 2-star rating.  But with some changes, it could well be 5-star!

As others, I also added crushed garlic (1 large clove), and a few dashes each of soy and worcestershire sauce.  Without these flavor enhancers, the recipe would be quite flat.  I also reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup; fearing that 1 1/2 cups would be way overkill.  1/2 cup was perfect, and I used the lite version with success. Once the sour cream and flour mixture was added to the mushroom and broth mixture, I cooked everything on med/low heat for about a minute to cook the flour a bit (raw flour is not a good thing).

For further improvement next time, I'd add a few teaspoons of tomato paste to ramp up the flavor and richness of the dish (tomato paste is sometimes found in beef stroganoff recipes).  Also, unless you're a strict vegetarian, I would recommend using beef broth in place of the vegetable broth.  Lastly, I would reconstitute a few dried mushrooms (ex:  dried porcinis) and add them into the mix.  This would pump up the 'mushroomy-ness' of the dish.  For texture variety, you could also add in some other types of fresh mushrooms (button, oyster, etc.)

Lastly, don't cook your noodles before starting to prepare the stroganoff.  They will get cold and sticky by the time you're ready to use them.  Instead, cook 'em at the last minute.

Once served up on your dinner plate, add a dollop of sour cream to the top of the stroganoff.  Yum!

Good thing I read the reviews!  As written this recipe would have easily been a 2.  With the review recommendations its a 5+++!
Here's what I did to make it taste great: 1.  slowly cooked the onions so they became caramelized (took at least 25 mins on very low heat), 2. add a mixture of portobello, crimini and shitake mushrooms, 3. added 3 cloves of garlic when sautéed the mushrooms, 4. added half a cup of wine after mushrooms were soft and cooked for about three mins, and then added 1 cup of stock, 1/2 tsbp of soy, 4 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, 5. added about half a cup of sour creme and 1/4 chopped fresh parsley.  Awesome with modifications!

My rating is for the version that I made. I cut the sour cream to a little over half a cup, then cut the flour to about 2.5 Tbsp. I cooked the onion and mushrooms with one minced garlic clove. When the mushrooms and sour cream mixture were on low on the stove, I added: 1 tsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp worchestershire sauce, and a dash of white wine. I used a lot less parsley - just threw some in and then decided it looked good. The recipe was really tasty. I loved it - finally I've found a vegetarian equivalent to my Mom's beef recipe! My 17-year-old cousin said that she isn't usually a huge fan of vegetarian dishes, but she really loved this one. I'll definitely make it again! Great for company, although I'd definitely double the recipe, because it was not a lot.

I have never had stroganoff before so I have nothing to compare this to, but I thought it was delicious and sooo easy. I made some substitutions to make this recipe dairy-free: vegan margarine and Tofutti Sour Supreme. I didn't have all-purpose flour so I used whole wheat which was awesome, surprisingly not grainy at all. I added a dash of soy sauce as others recommended and I served it atop rice instead of egg noodles. I'm looking forward to making this again!  I would like to comment that substituting beef broth for vegetable broth seems to negate the purpose of a mushroom stroganoff recipe.

I have made this twice now-it's awesome!  I don't remove the mushrooms from the pan-I just add the broth in with them and boil to get really great mushroom flavor in the sauce.  This has become a favorite!

Quite tasty I must say. Like others, I added a dash of Worchestshire sauce and lite Soy sauce...plus a splash of white wine.  About a tablespoon of garlic helped as well.  I used a mix of Portobello, Shitake, and Oyster mushrooms and about 3/4 cup of Fat Free sour cream (mixed with about 2 Tbsp whole wheat flour).  Mixed some red onion with Walla Walla sweet onion. I put this over whole wheat rotini with good results. The second time I followed my own suggestions :-)using used homemade chicken stock (needed to get it out of the freezer) and whole wheat fettuccine. This time I used Light sour cream and mixed onion with diced shallots. Once again it was really good. BTW, consider on your time constraints...I like cooking the pasta of any dish late in the cooking process. Seems it mixes w/ sauces etc better when it's hot out of the colander. It wants to keep cooking when put in a hot sauce...so keep that in mind, under cook it by a minute. If sauce is coming out of the fridge...feel free to cool the pasta by adding it to the cool sauce (cook pasta for full length of recommended time in this case.

Just an FYI, while adding worcestershire may add flavor to this dish, it makes the recipe non-vegetarian. There are veg. worchestershire options out there but you have to look for them.

I took some of the other reviewers' advice and cut the sour cream (I used oat cream to make it vegan) to 1 cup. I also subbed some of the broth for red wine. As written, the recipe would probably lack oomph but with a few tweakings, it's great served on whole wheat pasta!

I originally found this recipe on a package of portabello mushrooms and have prepared it several times.  We love it!

This was not only simple, but delicious. Over the top, high-class eats. I used half butter, half EVOO because I was using a non-stick pan and I didn't want the butter to scorch. I also used half FF sour cream and half FF yogurt. I ended up needing to thicken it up a bit, so I used a quarter cup of white wine and two tablespoons of cornstarch to make a slurry, then added it to the stroganoff. (I must have overlooked the flour in the recipe in my excitement to make this recipe.) Very, very good. This one's going to be a repeat. NOTE: For you low-carbers like me, I ate this over a bed of steamed broccoli. For those who aren't worried about that, I made Light 'n' Creamy Mashed Potatoes for my family. EDIT: Hubs thought it would have been better had I used red wine instead of white. Noted. I failed to mention that I also added some fresh minced garlic and worchestershire sauce.

Pretty good.  I made some adjustments to the recipe.  I only used 1/2 cup sour cream per other reviewers and it seemed like plenty.  I added some garlic.  I also replaced some of the broth with red wine and added a splash of worstershire sauce.

I followed pinky pinks addition with a few more modifications. I used fresh sliced portobellos  from an 8 oz pkg. I added a couple of fresh shitake mushrooms sliced, and a handful of dried exotic mushrooms that I soaked in hot water. For the broth I used the broth from the mushrooms and a tsp of Better Then Bouillon mushroom flavored. I sprinked with thyme and when the mushroom had let go of their juices I added 1/2 cup of sherry. Cook until the alcohol burns off.
I have been looking for a great meat free recipe for Stroganoff for a long time. This awesome with the changes/additions.
 Good thing I read the reviews! As written this recipe would have easily been a 2. With the review recommendations its a 5+++! Here's what I did to make it taste great: 1. slowly cooked the onions so they became caramelized (took at least 25 mins on very low heat), 2. add a mixture of portobello, crimini and shitake mushrooms, 3. added 3 cloves of garlic when sautéed the mushrooms, 4. added half a cup of wine after mushrooms were soft and cooked for about three mins, and then added 1 cup of stock, 1/2 tsbp of soy, 4 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, 5. added about half a cup of sour creme and 1/4 chopped fresh parsley. Awesome with modifications!
Pinky pinks additions are attached.

This has become a staple in our house. I do, however cut the amount of sour cream in half and replace it with cream of mushroom soup. My 2 year old daughter likes it too.

I made a few of the changes recommended - added Worcestershire and soy, reduced the sour cream, and subbed 1/2 c. broth for red wine. I also did the broth/wine in a small saucepan and reduced it down while the onions and mushrooms were caramelizing to save some time. I didn't need to use flour at all since I let it reduce down and the flavor was much more concentrated and delicious.

This was very good but my boyfriend thinks it's missing something.  I think next time I will experiment by adding some garlic or other aromatic.  Otherwise, a very good meal.

I must say I don't understand why people insist on making their own recipes and then rating them. If I like 6 pounds of bacon fat and a cup of sand in my stroganoff, then rate the recipe a 5, how does that help anyone? I made this recipe as-is first. Gave it about a 3. Keep in mind this is a stroganoff recipe, not a mushroom sauce. Funny how many people cut back on the sour cream, then say the recipe is bland. When I tried the recipe first, I started with 1/2 c sour cream per suggestions and found it just tasted like mushroom sauce. So i added in the rest. Much better. It's stroganoff guys! Sour cream is a big part of it! When I made it again, I did try many user suggestions. I actually (my own idea) used half an onion, 2 shallots, and 2 cloves garlic. Also did 1/2 cup wine and 1 cup broth. Added a full pound of mushrooms, and after cooking them, added the wine, broth, etc., straight to the mushrooms without removing them from the pan. Also added a few dashes of soy and worcestershire, salt, white pepper and thyme to the sauce. Pretty much tried every suggestion made here. Even after all that, I can't give this more than 3 stars. There is a tang missing and I'm not sure what it is. Have seen some sights mentioning mustard and tomato paste, so might try that next time. Not a bad dish either way, but by no means a favorite.

This is a fantastic dish but I made a few changes. I added a clove of minced garlic with the mushrooms. Also added 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 3/4 teaspoon worcestershire sauce along with the vegetable broth. I added one 12 ounce package of soy crumbles to the mushroom mixture to boost the protein of this dish. I cut the sour cream down to 1/2 cup and reduced the flour to 2 1/2 tablespoons. My significant other thought he was eating hamburger stoganoff!

This was pretty good, but I found it really rich! I used beef broth simply because I had some in the fridge I needed to use up, and added a tbsp of worcestershire sauce and some soy sauce per other reviewers. I would suggest not cooking your egg noodles so soon, as mine were done way too early, and got a bit too cold and stuck together by the time I was done the stroganoff.

great basic vegetarian stroganoff - easy to make, very delicious.  I halved the recipe, used a bunch of green onions, and used sliced white mushrooms instead of portabello.  came out great!

I couldn't stop eating the sauce!!  So yummy!  However I did use the suggestions.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and sauteed them with the onions.  When I added the mushrooms and they softenend a bit I added a bit of Thyme, Oregano, Pepper and a bit of Cayenne I used no butter, only a tsp of oil and cooking spray to sautee veggies in.  And I used a tbs of cornstarch instead of flour to make sure there was no flour taste in the food.  At the very end I added the parm and blended it in.  I found this recipe with the suggested changes good.  I hate changing a recipe...but it's always good to have the guidline to make it even better...thanks for sharing!  Would like to try with beef or meatballs too!

After being turned on to portabellas, I started trying them in all kinds of dishes to stand in for meat when I tasted how meaty they were.  The additions of soy and worcestershire are great ideas and I would say add the sour cream to taste.  I wouldn't start off with so much.  Someone reccommended you could substitue beef broth for the veggie.   Perfectly fine!  Not everyone who enjoys vegetables is a vegetarian, so I say whichever you prefer!

I love this recipe! (Beef stroganoff tastes strange to me now.)  I suggest making your own broth (from bouillon) - use the amount of bouillon suggested for 1 1/2 Cups, but only use 3/4 C water. Then you don't have to boil it to reduce the liquid volume. Remember that the mushrooms will release juices too. Even better if you add Worchestershire, soy sauces and white wine and minced garlic. Fat free sour cream is okay, it still stays creamy.

I made this tonight for my husband and 13 month old daughter and we all liked it.  I made this vegan by replacing the butter with Earth Balance spread and sour cream with Tofutti Better Than Sour Cream and egg noodles with regular veggie sprials. We didn't have parsley so I sprinkled with a bit of dried basil.  This was super yummy and we'll make it again soon.

This turned out great. I cooked some garlic along with the onion, and added a little white wine to the broth after it was reduced. It got rave reviews at the table.

One word sums up this recipe:  BLAND.  Actually. two words.... extremely bland!  I was so excited to try this recipe, because I love mushrooms and I love stroganoff.  Perfect combination.  However, this recipe, as it stands, does not do it justice.  The first time around, I followed the recipe as is.  It was unpalatable.  So, then I scoured the comments to see what other additions I could make to salvage it.  So I added garlic, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, onion soup mix.  It was only then that my family & I could eat this.  Also, as one commenter already wrote, this recipe from start to finish take a lot longer than the recipe alots.  So if you do decide to make this, I would give yourself one hour.

This was really good. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and I used half regular portobellos and half baby portobellos. I also only used one cup of sour cream (because it's all I had). It was perfect.

Would only rate 3 stars "as is."  Good base and great concept, but would have been bland for my taste.  With some changes, absolutely wonderful, 5+++!!  Used half the amount of butter, 16 ounces portobello mushrooms, and added 2 cloves garlic, minced to mushrooms and onion mixture.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups of sour cream, I used approximately 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup ricotta cheese--mellowed out the sour cream taste while maintaining the creamy consistancy and enhancing the flavor.  I found a cup (or so) total to be plenty for me.  Instead of the veg broth, I used one cup of beef bullion and about a 1/4 cup white wine. Added soy and worcestershire sauces as other have suggested.  Decreased the flour by about half.  Omitted the parsely as I did not have any, and it was not missed.  Garnished with fresh grated parmesean cheese. DELIGHTFUL!!!!  I cannot wait to make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  As other reviewers said: add some worcestershire and soy.  That I did.  Other than that the recipe was followed exactly.  It was very good.  Others have said the sour cream was overpowering.  We didn't think so.  Will make again.  Thanks!

As a very good recipe its 4-star/it needs some French White Table Wine(Cuvee Blanc)by Georges DubCEuf/Worcheshire-sauce maybe on the side/I think some Vegatarians don't consider DAIRY-VEG./so there's a selection in the recipe..Garlic(maybe not)..Leeks would be good/...very nice combination in a simple sauce.

I made this for our family as one of my children has decided not to eat meat, we all really enjoyed this and I didn't need to add fattening stuff to "make it better" I kept it meat free and healthy, and tasty too. I didn't need to add any meat for "flavor".
I have used this as my base recipie twice and loved it.

The changes I did make was I did add garlic, I cut out the butter (I jsut used olive oil to cook the onions and mushrooms) and cut the sour cream down to 1/2 cup.

For a twist try adding lime or key lime flavored yogurt!!

This recipe was delicious with the changes suggested by previous reviewers.  I also added several cloves of garlic (4) to the onions and mushrooms.  I also added a dash of Worcester and Soy sauces,  and two tablespoons of dry red wine. I reduced the sour cream to 1 cup and used the recommended 3 tablespoons of flour and 1 and a half cups of vegetable broth. The end result was a rich, hearty, creamy sauce that I will definitely make again!  Next time I will use different types of mushrooms as I've read others recommend this lends a very rich mushroom flavor. I should add that I used Earth Balance vegan butter and Follow Your Heart Vegan Gourmet Sour Cream. Absolutely fantastic.

I make this more closely to my beef stroganoff recipe. Three types of mushrooms, portobello, crimini and regular. Used beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lots of pepper, then added 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of Marsala wine (just because I happened to have it). Reduced, then added 1/2 cup sour cream off the heat and stirred it in.  It was very good and company really liked it.

The five stars are for the recipe as edited by the top reviewer. We eat this on a regular basis and it's delicious! I've tried to sub greek yogurt for the sour cream, and it tastes ok, but makes the texture weird and lumpy. Stick with reduced fat sour cream.

This was delicious and very easy to make. My meat eating man loved it. I used half sour cream mixed with greek yogurt and it was very thick; probably didn't need the flour.

I  dashed in some W and (low sodium) soy sauce, reduced sour cream to ~1/2 cup (a little more next time) and added about a T of dry sherry.  Used 2 t low sodium   BTB organic beef base for the broth. Skipped the flour but used a bit of Wondra at the end.

I made this dish this evening and thought it pretty good.  I sauteed the onions, removed them, then cooked the mushrooms.  I like the onion cooked, but not indistinguishable for serving.  I had 2 other varieties of mushrooms, prior to buying the Portobello, so I included those as well.  I don't trust first time recipes, so I made a rue in the skillet used for the onions and mushrooms, developed the gravy taste to my liking with W.sauce, pepper, mustard and onion powder, and Maggi, then added the mushrooms and onions.  Once warmed through, I added the sour cream-- once again to taste.  I don't like the gravy too sweet.  This may not be something I would serve for company, but a solid recipe for the weekdays because it is easy and quick.

Love this vegetarian version of stroganoff! My husband loved it to and I will for sure be making this again. I did the same changes that I'd seen in the reviews. I added a clove of garlic, cut the sour cream down to half a cup (and it was still plenty rich and cream), along with cutting the flour to about 2.5 tbsp. Then added 1 tsp soy sauce and 1/2 Worcestershire. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the original recipe needed tweaking.

This was delicious using the modifications within the reviews - I added a tbls each of soy sauce and worschester sauce, 2 tsp of tomato puree and cut the sour cream to just under 1 cup. I also cut the flour down to 2 tbls. The recipe takes longer than 30 mins, but the resulting meal is rich with flavor and very meaty.

Very good!  I omitted the parsley and used pre-sliced baby bellas, but other than that I pretty much followed the recipe.  I wouldn't call it 4 servings though, more like 2 1/2, but it's delicious nonetheless.

YUMMY!  If you're not a vegetarian, you won't miss the meat.  Our family is not vegetarian, but thought it would be good to incorporate one meatless dish a week.  I added:  1 tbsp of yellow mustard to the sour cream mixture and substituted dried parsley flakes instead of fresh. I also added 1/4 cup of white wine at the end. I should have decreased the sour cream by at least 1/2 cup, next time I will.  There was a lot of sauce left over.  I did the egg noodles but also added 3-cheese filled tortellini for more substance.  You can find that in the refrigerated section.

I agree that it's a good starting point but made most of the recommended changes.  I doubled the recipe, added worcestershire and soy sauces, garlic and minced onions, replaced 1/3 of the vegetable broth with white wine, added "meat" crumbles, and decreased the sour cream.  It was a hit and a keeper of a recipe--modified of course.

This recipe turned out very bland and it had an overwhelming flavor of sour cream. We will not be making this again.

Great!  Followed suggestions of other reviewers: added a few dashes of soy and worcestershire; added a few ts of tomato paste; cut down on the sour cream. Definitely will make again.

This is a fabulous recipe! I took the others' advice about reducing the proportion of sour cream. I ended up doubling the broth, adding a TBS of flour, and using a 16 oz container of fat-free sour cream. The result was delicious. We all loved it, and are looking forward to the left-overs!

I used whole wheat egg noodles and decreased the sour cream by about one third.  I also added 1/4 cup red wine to the mushroom mixture before it reduced.  This was very good with a salad with dried cranberries, gorgonzola, and peptitas.

This was just okay, but I think I made a mistake by using fat free sour cream and did not cook down the veg. broth enough.  It seem to taste to watery.  May try again, not using fat free.

loved this; wasn't sure what to expect- the flavors were rather complex! I followed the reviews of others who reduced sour cream to half a cur, added half a cup of sherry, one cup of broth, half tspn soy, 4-dashes of Worcester. It took a little time to cook, but I enjoyed every bite!

Followed Pinky Pink's mods (1. slowly cooked the onions so they became caramelized (took at least 25 mins on very low heat), 3. added 3 cloves of garlic when sautéed the mushrooms, 4. added half a cup of wine after mushrooms were soft and cooked for about three mins, and then added 1 cup of stock, 1/2 tsbp of soy, 4 dashes of [vegetarian] Worcestershire sauce, 5. added about half a cup of sour creme and 1/4 chopped fresh parsley. Awesome with modifications!).  DBF added a small spoonful of sour cream to the top of his bowl, which mellowed and improved it.  Perhaps I will use a full cup of sour cream next time.  (For the future, need approx. six small portobellos.)

I tried this today having taken careful note of the other reviews, without which the dish would have been bland indeed! I did not take the onions, garlic and mushrooms out of the pan, but continued with red wine, soy sauce and worcester sauce, and then the stock. As sour cream is hard to come by in Athens, Greece, I added some thick low fat yoghurt with the flour, and the result was sensational: sweet from the onions, slightly sour from the yoghurt, and earthy from the mushies, soy and worcester sauce. I'll be making this again soon!

I also like the modifications that pinkypink made. I did the flour/sour cream mixture and it came out a bit lumpy but I thinned it our with 1/4 cup white wine and 2 tablespoons water and kept stirring until it was thinner. Cook the noodles last. I dumped them in pot as soon as I removed the mixture from the heat. Also, I never cooked anything in a seperate pan. I just kept adding to the same large skillet. The least amount of dishes I have to wash, the better. Good eating!!

This was pretty good! I used shiitake and white mushrooms, (oops), which was okay, but I think I'd use the portobello mushrooms next time. I wanted to give mine depth of flavor, so I used beef broth instead of vegetable, which was a good move. I also added one large clove of minced garlic with the onions. Next time, I will add two cloves. I put in a dash of cooking white wine and Worcestershire sauce, which added a lot of flavor. I, like some other reviewers, used only 1/2 C sour cream and 2 T of flour, which were more than enough. Great recipe--my husband gave it a big thumb's up! :)

Excellent!  I had a variety of mushrooms besides portobello, so I used them.  Tasted great and it reminded me of the stroganoff I used to eat as a kid!

This was a fine weeknight meal, but nothing spectacular.  I added some worcestershire sauce and omitted the parsley (personal preference).  Update: using beef broth in place of vegetable broth really enhances the flavor of this dish and brings this up to 4 stars for us.  Also, I add the flour into the skillet first and let it cook for a few minutes before carefully stirring in the sour cream.

I have been looking for a vegetarian version of stroganoff for a long time. I followed other suggestions here and cut the sour cream in half and used a little soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, white wine, garlic powder, and paprika, and I still felt like it was missing something and was kind of bland, though my fiance, who is not a vegetarian, liked it the way it came out.I imagine it would be dreadfully bland made as written. I did not like the fresh parsley with it. If I make it again I will add more seasoning, and use dried parsley.

I used this recipe and suggestions from others as a guideline. I cut the sour cream to 3/4 cup and used 1 cup BEEF broth and 1/2 cup wine. Added garlic, and 2 tbsp. worcestershire sauce. I left the mushrooms in the pan when I added the broth. It didn't reduce. Next time I will use only 1 cup of BEEF broth. I will also use 1 cup sour cream and add a few dashes of soy sauce along with the worcestershire sauce. The flavor was good, but it wasn't creamy enough, and you could taste the broth too much.

As written it's a three - decent but bland and a bit sweet. Adding balsamic, garlic, and Worcestershire fixed it. Lots of pepper. Oh, and browning the flour a bit along with the mushrooms, Roux style.

My family loves this meat free version on stroganoff.  I usualy add some garlic too and use brown rice instead of the noodles, it adds some nutty flavore and crunch too the smooth rich flaver of the sauce.

Just a quick comment --traditional worcestshire sauce is made with anchovies. Make sure you get vegetarian worcestshire sauce if you're making this for a vegetarian/vegan. I'll report on a vegan version of this recipe tomorrow.

Unbelievable!! Used modifications from COOKINGIRLLJ. Ive never made anything vegetarian taste so good. Taste more beefy than beef. It tastes more meaty than meat. Btw, I cubed the mushroom so they looked like chunks of beef.

This was a very good dish.  We all love mushrooms, so my family didn't miss the beef at all.  Definitely does not need as much sour cream as suggested!  I used less than a cup, and I think I'll reduce it a little more in the future.  I did follow the suggestions of others and threw in some garlic, as well as 1/2 c. red wine (replaces 1/2 c. of the water), and a dash of Worcester and soy sauce. Very flavorful, and the leftovers were great, too!

Mmmmm!!! There aren't very many meat-free dishes that my husband gets excited about. But this one was a "keeper" from the first time I made it. The only change I make is adding salt, pepper, dried thyme, and dried oregano to the mushrooms when I saute them. The fresh parsley is a must for this dish.

I didn't make this as is, but followed the suggestions given. I used two portobella caps, 7 buttons, and I reconstituted porcinis in beef broth and then filtered the broth thru a coffee filter and reused it in the recipe. I used several dashes of worcester and soy sauce, and 2 tsp of tomato paste. I also used 1/2 cup of sour cream, but would probably up this amount to 3/4 or so next time around. I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with the onion, just cause I love garlic. Next time I'll also probably grab some fresh parm at the store and sprinkle it on top. Very yummy... this one is definitely a keeper!!!

My husband makes this for me on *special* occasions.  It has become my favorite meal to be made at home.  Absolutely in love!  Must use fresh parsley and mushrooms!  (I see others cut the sour cream, however, that is my favorite part, the results are super creamy. My husband never follows the recipe 100%, but he doesn't skimp on the cream!)

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. We have it almost once a week, in an attempt to add more veggies and decrease the amount of meat we eat. This makes it easy. I also use Worcestershire and soy sauce to give the dish a full flavor.

A great recipe!  It takes a bit longer to prepare (so I don't make it often), but it reminds me of my mom's recipe (except her was beef and I am a vegetarian so it is a great compromise!)!

This was a wonderful, rich, and hearty dish. Glad I read the reviews before I made it myself as I made a few significant changes. I added a stalk of celery and a smashed clove of garlic in with the onions. I added enoki and shitake mushrooms. In with the broth I added a dash of soy sauce and some white wine and reduced both the flour and sour cream by half.

Very good and light.  As written, this recipe is probably bland, but I changed it a lot.   I used 1 c. beef broth and 1/2 cup white wine.  I used only 1/2 c. lite sour cream and 2 T. flour.  I sauteed garlic with the onions, and added sage, thyme, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, a little tomato paste, and salt.  I served with a little sour cream and fresh parsley on top.   Good recipe.

This was really good. Like many reviewers, I added garlic, red wine, and beef broth, and only added about 1 cup of sour cream, which was definitely plenty. Tastes great and is filling!

I have always made beef Stroganoff with mayo and sour cream even though I'm not too fond of mayo and needing to add a lot of things to make it taste not so bland. I am so glad you thought of a better, yummier ing. like MUSHROOM.  talk about  a brain f... on my side (lol)  Anyway, my husband liked it so much he brought some to the guys he works with and they all loved it.  Great recipe, thanks 4 sharing.

5 stars with some changes (haven't tried it without).  I put a bit of paprika in the butter at the beginning, added a minced clove of garlic a minute after the mushrooms were in, didn't take the shrooms out when I reduced the veggie stock, added a splash of worchester and braggs (like soy) to the broth.  Then I mixed up about 3/4 cups sour cream with the flour, added some of the shrooms/sauce to the scream and mixed it well before adding it back to the pan.  I did this in the morning and put it in the fridge all day, then warmed it up while I cooked the egg noodles.  Mixed in parsley at the end.  It was really good.

It was delicious.  I used crimini mushrooms in place of the Portobello, and McCormmack's Worcestershire pepper (it's vegetarian whereas the sauce isn't) in place of ground pepper, cornstarch (1/2 the amount) instead of flour... and sauteed a clove of garlic with the onions.  Super creamy and yummy.  Served it with toasted garlic potato bread, a side salad, and buttered corn.

This was very good!  I modified the recipe based on others' suggestions.  Instead of 1 1/2 c. of vegetable broth, I used 1 c. of broth, 1/4 c. white wine, 1/4 c. sherry.  I also used 1/2 c. sour cream and 2 1/2 T. flour.  I added both soy sauce and Worcestshire sauce but I didn't measure - just drizzled.  Next time I'll add more Worcestershire sauce.  Also, I think I will double this next time.  There was enough for me and my husband last night and for one person to have leftovers, but I like to have more leftovers so we can both take lunches to work.

Great recipe, made better by suggestions from other users.  I added the white wine vinegar, soy sauce, worchestershire sauce and garlic.  I also used just 1/2 cup sour cream as suggested by other reviewers.  Also, made it egg and dairy free by using soy sour cream and egg free pasta noodles. 
With a dollop of sour cream and paprika over the top, husband and I would give it 5 stars.

I followed the advice of others by using a porcini mushroom broth as a base and also adding soy and worcestershire.  Also cut down the sour cream to half cup and it was wonderful.  I'd double the recipe if you were serving 4.

I made this using most of the advice the other reviewers mentioned and I still was not that impressed. I felt it was pretty bland except for the parsley which I felt overpowered all the other flavors.

This is a 5 star recipe with modifications suggested by Cookingirllj:
 -add 1clove garlic to onion. 
 -Add dash of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce. 
 -reduce sour cream to 1/2c.
 -use beef broth instead of veggie
I also added about 1/4 c red wine to the broth while it was reducing. I used combination of oyster, portabello and other mushrooms. I ended up adding a bit more broth and wine at the end because it was too thick. But in the end it turned out yummy. Even my picky husband went back for seconds. :-)

One of our favourite restaurants has a mushroom stroganoff on their vegetarian menu which my daughter loves. She has been asking me for some time to try and make it at home. This recipe she said is just as good. I followed it exactly and it was far easier than I imagined and very quick to make as well. Another one to add to the folder I am compiling for her. Thankyou CHORDATA.

This is a fantastic recipe...the only thing that I did different was I browned the mushrooms slightly.  If you do this with care they will not fall apart due to the thickness of the mushroom.  This is a great way to "step away" from meat once in a while, and you don't even miss it.

Excellent recipe, especially with the modifications suggested on this page.  I also included garlic, used a bit worcester and soy, and added some wild mushrooms for additional flavor.  My wife and I have just started to eat purely vegetarian and this was the first non-meat dish I ever made and we both really enjoyed it.

This recipe was a lifesaver for me when I had to cook for a guest and had less than 45 minutes. I used portobello and shitake mushrooms, about a cup of light sour cream and 2+ tbs of flour, plus dashes of worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and nutmeg, based on recommendations of other reviewers. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used a much smaller amount of dried. I also didn't have vegetable broth so I used Better Than Bullion, which made for nice flavor.

Everyone loved the recipe and didn't miss the meat (I cook for vegetarians and meat eaters). They all said to add it to my regular repertoire, and I will definitely double the recipe next time I make it.

Excellent.  I served this with a salad and accompanied with a good glass of Merlot Cabernet.  It was lovely. I did add 3 cloves of garlic, a tsp of mustard and a dash of woster sauce.  The beef which is usually the main ingredient in a stroganoff, was not missed.

This was superb!!!  I followed the advice of others and used only a 1/2 cup of sour cream, added some garlic to the onion and mushroom mixture, and threw in a few splashes of soy sauce and worschestershire sauce.  Oh my, I almost felt guilty for eating something so meaty!!  It really tasted exactly how I remember beef stroganoff tasting, I really loved it.  So did my two year old daughter!

My cousin's wife and I are the only vegetarians in our family. I wanted to make a special entree to take to our family's Christmas gathering, so we would be sure to have something significant to eat, as well as show off how delicious vegetarian food can be to our non-vegetarian, meat-and-potatoes Midwestern family. I had many compliments as to how good and filling it was.

As I was cooking it (last-minute, of course!), I worried that there wouldn't be enough sauce. There was! I like my sauce seasoned heavily, so I added extra garlic powder, and extra pepper.

I will definitely make this recipe for other special occasions. Loved it!

This is a wonderful recipe! It is so easy and lets the natural flavors of the onion and mushrooms come through. I add a bag of fake ground beef to 'beef' up the protien and add fresh minced garlic. I recently made this for a friend and it is her new favorite.

I liked this recipe better after adding some soy sauce and vegetarian worcestershire sauce as other reviewers suggested.  Without those additions the sour cream taste is overwhelming.  I'm glad I tried this recipe, but will stick to my usual mushroom stroganoff which is easier, just sautee a variety of thinly sliced mushrooms with butter and seasoning salt, add some sour cream to taste, and whisk in veg. broth to your preferred consistancy.

I thought this recipe was great! My husband agreed and said it was better than his family's beef stroganoff recipe! The only alterations I made were adding 1 clove of pressed garlic in with the onions and mushrooms, 1/2 of sour cream instead of 1 1/2 and adding 1 Tablespoon of soy sauce to the broth. I thought the fresh parsley taste was too strong, so I might lessen the 1/4 cup in the future. Definitely a keeper!

This is a good base recipe.  Did read some of the reviews saying it was missing something so I added garlic, worcestershire (1 tbsp or too taste), and soy sauce (1 tsp or to taste).  Used these ingrediants in other stroganoff recipes, adds that extra tangy zip to the cool creamy flavor of sour cream.

This was good.  I used sherry like suggested and very helpful to bring flavor.  Sauce was too thick - I think there should have been something with the sour cream to make it a little smoother.  Overall, a really good vegetarian meal - really easy.

5/5 in terms of taste (if you follow the reviews.)
My mom, who normally hates sour cream said it reminded her of tuna noodle casserole, and ate a large plateful. It made enough for 2 people, eating two generous portions each, and it's easy and cheap enough for a weeknight meal.

I was out of fresh garlic, and don't normally have fresh parsley or worcestershire sauce, so I subbed garlic powder, dried parsley, and seasoned salt. It was actually very good, even without fresh ingredients. I used 3/4 lb. of button mushrooms, next time I'd use at least a pound. I used 3/4 bag of egg noodles. Next time, I would use the whole bag (there was enough sauce left over for one more medium-small portion.)

Sauce: I would add less flour next time. This one is because of my technique, I cooked the sauce for a few extra minutes to get rid of the floury taste, and the sauce continued to thicken. I added about 4 scoops of pasta water to thin it (bonus is it helps the sauce stick to the pasta) while it cooked. I whisked the flour in without the sour cream, after adding the veggies back in, thinking it would work, and there were a few lumps I had to scoop out. Next time, I'd add the flour and whisk before adding the veggies back in. I added 1/2 Tablespoon of soy sauce as well, and I think that really made it. I actually thought the sauce was really good without the sour cream, so if you're out of it or with someone who doesn't like it, you could maybe add a pat or two of butter instead. You defini

Creamy, yummy, easy, even my husband loved it and he doesn't often rave about my cooking. (I do better at baking, truth be told).  I added Gardein Meat Crumbles to the mushroom mixture and that made it extra thick and hearty.  Of course I added a tad more sour cream too.  Hardly any leftovers.

Even though I don't eat mushrooms I cook them for my vegetarian grandson.  I have to say the end result of cooking this was it smelled very good!!  Thanks for all the suggestions as I don't taste these mushroom dishes that I cook the thanks and yumms I got were evidence that this recipe is a def keeper. Cut the sour cream as suggested, used 3 T. flour, soy and Worcestershire sauce with a dash of white wine.  Will be making this to take with me to Easter dinner at the daughters house.  Thanks for sharing

I have to disagree with the reviewers who say this needs any alterations to be a 5-star recipe.  I've made this several times and it is simple and fantastic!  The only specific thing I do is to use Better Than Bouillon Mushroom Base as the vegetable broth.  My "I hate mushrooms" husband pushes aside the portobello slices but loves the sauce.

Soooo delicious, not missing the meat at all. Took a couple of pages from other reviewers and added some soy sauce to the cooking mushrooms, would have added worchestershire sauce too if i had it but the soy sauce alone added a good bit to the meatiness of the dish. Also added a couple of small cloves of garlic, a few pinches of dried thyme, and kept the onions and mushrooms in the pan when i added the veggie broth. Next time I'll make a double batch because this went fast and there were arguments over who got more.

Unless you're using a Worcestershire sauce that's labeled vegetarian (they do exist), you're no longer making a vegetarian dish as it is traditionally made with anchovies.  Might as well just make a beef Stroganoff if you're adding Worcestershire sauce.  As with most, I thought the sour cream was a bit heavy handed and even wonder if it was a typo that was meant to read 1/2 cup.  I did a quick check and MOST recipes that use sour cream used 1/2 - 1 cup (Alton Brown had a non-veggie version -- using beef broth -- that used 8 oz of sour cream and 4 oz goat cheese)

My rating is after changes other users made as well as my own. I added garlic, Worcestershire, and soy sauce, and used less sour cream. In addition, I used mushroom broth instead of vegetable broth for a more streamlined flavor, and I left the vegetables in when I added the liquid so that they cooked together. I also added a tbsp of bouillon veg broth powder to enhance the flavor (low salt, no msg). The primary and only thing I didn't like about this Amazing and Easy recipe was that the parsley overpowered the other flavors. When I make this again I will use dried parsley added during the simmering process so I am not smacked in the face with random parsley flavor while I am eating the stroganoff. good base recipe.

Yikes!  This was tasting very good until I added those last ingredients.  The only change I made to this recipe was that I followed the advice of others and cut the amount of sour cream in half, but in the end all I could taste was that sour cream!  Husband said it was "ok" and I couldn't eat it.  If I ever make this again I will either use yogurt in a smaller amount or make a cream sauce that is less overpowering.

I used this as a great starting point. Like the others, I too added white wine, worchestshire sauce, soy and garlic to taste.  I made it dairy free by using tofutti sour cream and vegan butter spread. Amazing!!!

It's a good start.  But you've got to at least double the mushrooms & bear in mind that a "large" onion is fairly subjective, so feel free to add more onion.  I added Worcestershire (2 T), Salt, freshly ground White Pepper (1/2 tsp), 2 minced cloves of Garlic and Dill (1/2 T).  

If you want to keep this a vegetarian dish, then make sure you use VEGETARIAN Worcestershire (it exists!).  Definitely do not cook the noodles at the start of things - just have the water hot and ready to go by the time you're adding the sour cream.

Using Beef Stock would certainly give it more depth of flavor, but then why wouldn't we just go ahead and use meat in the recipe itself?  Beef & Portobello Stroganoff would be OUTSTANDING.

WOW!  I have made this many times now, so I should prepare the unsuspecting of the clamor:  I had to make about 4 batches of it for my production group because everyone kept demanding more!  And I was the only vegetarian of the bunch.  Also works with brown button mushrooms just fine!

It was pretty good and easy to make.  However next time i will add some cream of mushroom and take some of the sour cream out.

good basic recipe...now for the modifications:  I addede two cloves of garlic to the onions while saute-ing,  added two fists full of leftoever grilled veggies, omitted the broth...wanted it more stew-y like than saucy...I ran out of sour cream but had buttermilk, so in it went!  yum!!only used about 1/2 cup of the buttermilk when mixed with the flour made a nice roux(?) it was nice...tasted yummy

Soak veggie stock in vidalia onions and heat up just a little bit.  Add a pinch of salt if needed.  This will get rid of the overpowering carrot taste of most packaged veggie stock.

I always start recipes as listed but then adjust as needed.  This was super bland prior to taking the advice of other reviews.  I added a tablespoon of tomato paste, some soy sauce, Worcestershire and garlic.   used light sour cream and it was still tasty.  Will be making this again (with modifications).

With the changes, this won the approval of even the biggest carnivores at my stroganoff-off.  I used chanterelles, shiitake, and portabellos.  Great over egg noodles or rice!

I rated this (4) because it is a good base. I did read the reviews  And added the white wine, Worcestershire, soy sauce
and garlic. It was wonderful and I will make this again. I added (1) tablespoon of browning sauce at the end to deepen the color. Excellent

I did add cream, cut the sour cream in 1/2, and used linguini.  I thought it was a keeper but I will make additional changes next time to get it to perfection.  It was just missing something. :)

I really should have read the reviews first. I'm a new vegetarian, and was very excited to see a stroganoff recipe. I don't know if it was the amount of sour cream, or what, but I'm a little disappointed. I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm sure it'll be good if it's tweaked.

As stated in many other reviews, this recipe as it stands is not very good. There is waaaaay too much sour cream to enjoy it. I would definitely heed the advice of the others who have customized this dish if you choose to make it. It definitely has potential, you just have to work on it!

I don't think this version mimics a stroganoff. It's very tasty in its own right but as a mock stroganoff, it just didn't do it for me.  If you're a vegetarian looking for a yummy dish I would recommend but not if you're looking for a beef stroganoff like dish.

Made the recipe exactly as written. We loved it! Maybe add a touch of garlic just because we love garlic, but this is an easy stroganoff recipe I will use again.

I made this dish a couple weeks ago and I was not really impressed.  It didn't have much flavor.  I'm a huge mushroom lover so I was really excited to try this but ultimately I was left disappointed.  I just read some other reviews with different revisions.  Those might help, but as is it’s kind of boring.

Very easy to make, has a pungent distinctive taste. Not kid friendly, my three yr. old and five yr. old refused to eat more than a taste. Their six year old brother said he liked the noodles (our son, the diplomat).   I thought it was great.

Delicious!  I did add the suggested things such as garlic, lite soy and worcestershire sauce.  It was just as good as the stroganoff I order at my favorite, expensive restaurant.  I will make this again.

I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.  So easy, and really flavorful.  Thanks to all the great tips, I modified mine as follows:  added some chopped cremini mushrooms with the chopped onion, cut down sour cream to 1 cup, added some soy, worcetershire, and dry mustard to the sauce.

This was fantastic.  I used light sour cream and store bought sliced "baby bellas", it was so quick and easy to put together.  It wasn't quite as good leftover.

The recipes is very good, however the 30 Min, said to make is a bit off. I would say closer to 1 hour to 1.25 hours. and I would say to cook the egg noodles last not 1st.

I used pre-sliced baby bella mushrooms to make for even quicker prep.  At first I thought there was too much sour cream flavor, but it really mellows.  Makes for great leftovers, just make sure to reheat on low so the sour cream doesn't separate.

I love this recipe.  I also add a decent amount of garlic when I make this, and some dry mustard.  Worcestershire sauce is good, but not vegetarian (though you can buy a veggie version).  Cream sherry works well.  Sometimes I add a bay leaf while I'm cooking the broth, and some dried thyme.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is great if you look at all of the modifications.  Adding garlic when you saute the onions is a must as well as adding soy sauce, Worcestershire, and pepper with the sour cream.  I used low fat sour cream and it was delicious.

Awesome!  Did not miss the beef.  Took advice of other reviewers (thx!) and used 3 portobellos, beef broth for veg, 3/4 c sour cream, garlic, a bit of soy sauce, worchestshire, and tomato paste.  We loved this!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Beautiful recipe.  Better than Beef Stronganoff!  I used the advice of another reviewer and added soy, worstershire and tomato paste (2 tsp) and it was amazing!  Also I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup.  5 stars!

This was absolutely delicious. I used portoabello, crimini, and shitaki mushrooms and used only 1/2 a cup of sour cream, added some cloves of garlic, and added a little soy sauce.

Used regular white mushrooms since it was all I had, and added some fake hamburger...very good.  My husband, the meat eater, liked it better than the regular meat stroganoff I made!

As a vegetarian, I've gotten into a rut with the same old dinner recipes, but this one is definitely  different and tasty!  I would cut the portabello mushrooms into bit sized pieces and into even smaller pieces if you're serving this dish to kids.  I also add about a quarter cup of frozen peas to up the nutrition. Other than that small adjustment (and the addition of lots of white wine), the recipe was delicious.

I'm so glad that I read other reviews and added garlic and worcestshire sauce, or I probably wouldn't have liked it. With the additions, it was really good. My boyfriend is a vegetarian, so I've learning to make meat-free meals that we both like and this one will probably get a regular rotation. I used all the sour cream it called for, but don't think I will use all of it next time.

I trusted this recipe because of it's high reviews, but it does not warrant them. I did substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream - which I DO NOT recommend - but I cannot see that such a large amount of sour cream would taste much better. I will look elsewhere the next time I make stroganoff.

As a new vegetarian, I'm always on the lookout for tasty dishes like this one. I followed the recipe to the letter, with one exception- I didn't add parsley. It was very rich and tasty- I didn't miss the beef at all. Next time, I will probably cut back on the sour cream- it was just a little bit too rich for me. Delicious nonetheless!

The only change I made was adding garlic.  Next time I make it I will cut back the sour cream and do some of the other suggestions.  Great place to start.

I tweaked this waaaayyy too much to judge it fairly, but it turned out fantastic, so 5 stars it is! I used chicken broth and white wine for the liquid, cut back on the sour cream, added some worchestershire, garlic and pepper and a little salt. It thickened a little too much, but I blame that on myself for cutting down on the sour cream, but not the flour. It was one of the best dishes I've cooked from scratch in a long time, so I'll definitely be making it again. Thank you for a great base recipe!

Awesome recipe-but I made the following changes: *Reduced sour cream to 3/4 c. *Used a very large onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1 stalk celery, a few green onions/scallions, and half a yellow bell pepper for more depth of flavor *added a dash of soy sauce & Worcestershire sauce along with salt & black pepper for flavor & spice *adding a T. or two of tomato paste would be an awesome addition, in a pinch (I didn't want to waste a can) I added a generous squirt of ketchup.  That is a "secret" ingredient in another stroganoff recipe that is a family favorite.    My 7 year old son asked if this was a 'five star' recipe because he LOVED it, I told him it definitely was.  Everyone in our family of 5 loved it-we will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe.  I used a lot more onions which I think gave it a good flavor, and a lot less sour cream.

I really like this recipe. It was my first time trying stroganoff from scratch & i thought it was accessible and good. I followed the notes & added soy, worcestershire sauce & a bit of white wine, which i think helped. How i goofed was in doubling the recipe (also suggested) and i think the 1/4 cup & 2 TBS of flour was excessive. I also want to say I think quality of sour cream is important, it might have helped a bit with flavor since its not a very spicy recipe & all ingredients need to shine. Same for portobellos, some from the market as opposed to the grocery would have helped. Otherwise good, think next time I'll add less flour & season with kosher salt & fresh pepper to taste.

The reason Im giving this 4 stars is because I think the sour cream was a bit too much, it could have been fine with a little less. Overall though the meal was quite nice. Very creamy, Im deffinately making this again!

Very good! I would recommend using your best judgement on the sour cream amount, however. I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and used about 1/3 cup of sour cream. The only other changes I made were to omit the onions (preference in this house), used beef broth, and added a clove of garlic, minced. Thanks! :)

I made the substitutions and additions recommended by other reviewers, but it still didn't have much flavor.  And this is definitely a dish that you don't want to eat as leftovers.

This is proof that vegetarian recipes can be hearty and filling -- good stuff! The leftovers are even better, too.  Changes required: add garlic, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce (vegetarian worcestershire sauce does exist, no fishy stuff in it), 1 tsp soy sauce, and use only 1 cup sour cream (instead of 1 1/2).

The recipe as it reads is alright... bland though.  I think my changes made it better.  I used beef broth and put beef round steak in it at the verty beginning I floured the steak and pan fried it cut in sections in the pan with onion and portabello mushrooms.  VERY tasty this way!

My whole family thought this was great. At the end, I mixed the noodles into the sauce, and added some frozen peas and a splash of white wine.  

We may have gotten a little impatient and ate it too soon... the sauce that sat on the stove longer cooked down and stuck to the noodles better than the first helping we ate. My 2 year old and I both ate 3 helpings of this! Great recipe. I've always wondered how to make this without canned soup (yuck!).

I add Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, red wine and tomato paste with the broth to make up the 1 1/2 cups.  Very good.  This one I even serve for guests with banquette and salad.

I am a picky vegetarian and have wished for a stroganoff without meat that was wonderful.  This version was incredible and incredibly easy as well!  I couldn't get enough, and I'm making it again a week later!  For your preference it would be easy to change the spices around, add some garlic, paprika for a spicy touch, or other herbs, but my fiance, and I greatly enjoyed it as is.  Thanks!

The first time I made this I used chicken broth, as that was all I had, and decreased the sour cream. I also added worcestershire sauce to the mushroom with diced shallots and garlic. It was wonderful. The second time I made I used an organic vegetable stock, that was much stronger, and needed to use the full amount sour cream to get the same creaminess. All in all it is a great recipe. The whole family enjoys it, including my three kids. I even passed it along to my vegetarian sister.

I discovered this recipe about 6 months ago and have made it at least 10 times since then. It's amazing! I don't remove the mushrooms from the pan to add the creamy stuff, I find if you leave them in there it makes the sauce more flavorful.

wonderful meal option, affordable for those with a tight pocket book, just wonderful. I added a teaspoon of garlic to the onion and it added a little extra flavor to it. Worthy of five stars!

5 Stars with these Changes...Agree with most--way too much sour cream.  & do the onions, garlic and 'shrooms in pan at same time.  My version is much easier and even more delicious--try it!
Follow basic recipe but: 
Fry onion and  a heaping tablespoon of chopped jarred garlic until soft.
Add chopped or sliced mushroom, parsley, stir often until soft.
Add 1 1/2 cans vegetable broth, stir until light boil.  
Mix one heaping teaspoon CORNSTARCH (not flour) to the remaining half can of veg broth.  Bring to boil, when thickened, remove from heat and add in 1/2 cup of sour cream, stir 'till mixed.
Add cooked noodles to mushroom mix, stir until heated fully, serve with a plain vegetable (we liked broccoli as the side)
Enjoy and revel in the praise.  You earned it!

I followed the suggestions-- garlic, soy, less sour cream-- and it turned out really well. A couple things I did: used a Lipton onion & mushroom soup mix in the mushroom-reconstituting water instead of broth. (Gave more flavor and thickened faster.) Added red wine while reducing. I'm a vegan, so I used tofutti yogurt with a shot of champagne vinegar for tartness. Sauce was very creamy and thick. I could make this- with all the recipe tweaks of course! - for company.

My rating is also for the "doctored" version.  I probably  used half the butter.  I added Worcestershire only (not a fan of Soy sauce), a can of mushroom pieces along with the yummy portobello's, about a tablespoon of tomato paste then I added about a tsp of cayenne to the sour cream/flour mix. I used chicken broth I had on hand.  We also only use whole wheat pasta products and this was great with WW egg noodles.  This was so delicious we will probably have it a couple of times a month.  Thumbs WAY Up

None of the flavors seemed to mix.  We could all distinctly taste the sour cream.  My family agrees, this is the worst meal I have ever prepared.

Sorry, I can only give this 2 stars "as-is"...WAY too much flour and not enough broth to make a smooth sauce.  I made it a second time with some modifications and it was superb that way, though!  I doubled the broth, only used 1 tablespoon flour and added chopped garlic, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and tamari.  Much better this way, and lots of sauce to slurp up!

Not my favorite but I used tofu sour 'cream' and do not particularly care for it. Will try again using heavy cream from my raw milk share.

This recipe is great, especially for a mushroom lover like me!  I did make a number of changes based on recommendations of other reviewers as well as my personal preferences.  The changes I made are as follows: I used Chantelle mushrooms as well as Portobello, I only used ¾ cup of sour cream, I added 3 cloves of garlic, I used 2.5 tablespoons of flour, I did not remove mushrooms from pan when I added vegetable broth, I kept cooking the stroganoff when I added the sour cream, I added 1 teaspoon soy sauce and ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce with sour cream, lastly I topped the dish with fresh parsley rather than mixing it in.  This dish turned out very creamy with intense flavor.  It was a very heavy meal, but delicious.

This was a great starting point!  I did make some changes based on the reviews of others & a few swaps to help reduce the caloric content.  I used greek nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream, and only used a 1/2 cup, changed the flour ratio accordingly, used red onion, and baby bella mushrooms. Also added a dash of soy sauce, a few shakes of granulated garlic, and cut WAY down on the butter for cooking the onions & mushrooms.  Will definitely make again!

This dish was okay. The flavors seemed a little off - and even 1/2 cup of sour cream was way overwhelming. I cooked it for another 30 min on low after adding the sour cream to try to blend the flavor in some. Maybe next time I'll try lite sour cream or heavy cream. Or another Stroganoff recipe.

Well I had never made a stroganoff before, so this was a good one to start with, as the whole family adores mushrooms.  I used 8 oz of baby bellas, and 16 oz of white button mushrooms. (I made a larger batch).  I also used beef broth instead of the veggie. I used red onion, and made the adjustments others had mentioned with soy and worch. sauce, etc.  Yummy.

I thought this dish was delicious! The only thing I'll do differently next time (and I will make it again!) is that I'll only use half of an onion, as one whole one was too much for us. A really great recipe though!

Great veggie alternative to the classic stroganoff! I took the advice of others and cut the sour cream to 1/2C and added in a tbsp of Worchestershire sauce.  Also sauteed some garlic along with the onion and mushroom.  Just the right amount of creaminess without going over the top. Delicious!

I made this for dinner last night and really enjoyed it! I don't know if my quantities were off, but if this serves 4, it must be 4 with tiny appetites! :-) Anyway, I changed it a little - used a combination of portobellos and baby bellas (had the b.b.s on hand); cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup and used lite, which was plenty; forgot the parsley at the end but was still good without; veg broth instead of chicken, which gave it a good flavor; and a sweet onion. Licked the pot!!! Thanks!

love this recipe. I add red peppers and onions to it. I also cut the amount of sour cream. Just a reminder to clean the bottom of the mushroom..take the fins off or your stroganoff will be purple! Great meal!

Liked this one a lot.  Not sure why, but lately it seems as though I have a strong addiction to mushrooms!  Makes for a nice change from the standard stroganoffs...I did add some minced garlic to the onions and mushrooms as they cooked.  Chose to use less sour cream and mixed it with a can of cream of mushroom soup - blended that in along with a few shakes of soy sauce and would say that this is pretty appetizing.  For a healthier alternative, I used whole wheat egg noodles, only this recipe really helped them from tasting like cardboard!  Personally, I would say this recipe is a keeper.  Thank you!

delicious definetely a keeper, I added some worstershire sauce and little beef stock.  It was a little thick so next time I think I'll leave out the flour.  My family loved it thanks for sharing.

This is the best stroganoff I have ever made. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and it worked out very well. Also, I didn't have a portobello so I used button mushrooms. I'm sure it would have had even more flavor with the portobello.
The only thing about every home made stroganoff I've ever made is I can't taste the sour cream (and I don't think this is the fault of this recipe). So, next time I'll probably reserve some extra sour cream to dolop over the individual servings.
Otherwise this was a wonderful and tasty dish!

a scrumptious recipe. I only used 1/2 C of light sour cream and it was all that i needed. Also subbed veggie broth for chicken.

I loved this dish. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions for a long time and added 3 Tablespoons of sherry to the mixture as another member suggested. I also used beef broth instead of veggie broth. Next time I would reduce the sour cream by 1/2 cup. Will definately make this recipe again.

It looked too simple - but I was definitely surprised at how good this came out! I used regular mushrooms & tofu-sour-cream-substitute & it still worked really well. It was EASY & delicious. The only addition I made was a couple of tablespoons of mirin (or sherry) - EXCELLENT. Perhaps the reviews that suggested it was missing something could try this?! Definitely a keeper recipe...

Delicious! We tried it with olive oil instead of butter and tofu-based sour cream, and it turned out beautifully. We served it with grilled salmon.

I makes this all the time, and I'm not even vegetarian.  I don't always use portobellos, though (they're too expensive) but even with those regular cheapo mushrooms it tastes great.

This is delicious! Just be sure to remove the under gills from the mushrooms or the dish becomes a blue-gray color. It's a great vegetarian meal that even my meat loving husband asks for.

It was tasty, healthy (with low fat sour cream).  I've had better stroganoff, but this is the best vegetarian that I've been able to make.

I just made this tonight and it was excellent!  Both my boyfriend and I really loved it.  We are in Germany so I substituted Quark for Sour Cream and it worked great.  I also used regular brown mushrooms because I couldn't find any portobello mushrooms and it tasted just as good I think.  We put it over Spaetzle (german egg noodles) and really enjoyed it!  We'll definitely be making it again.

This is a great recipe.  I used beef broth and fat-free sour cream.  If anything, I'd use less sour cream the next time (because there will definitely be a next time!).  I highly recommend this one.

I loved the taste of this recipe but as another reviewer said, mine also had a funky blue/gray color.  I think I would cook the mushrooms longer next time and adding a little wine also sounds great.  Very good!

I think I made a mistake with this recipe. The taste was fabulous but the color was a definite turn off. I used portobello mushroom caps. Could this have been the problem? Sauce was bluish grey-not very appetizing. Should I have used ordinary portobello mushrooms?

Very good...I want to try it again though and maybe add in a little bit of wine to give it a little more flavor...may use a little less sour cream too.  But really good.

This was delicious!  Those who cut back on the sour cream 
and are adding tomato sauce, etc, you know it's stroganoff, right?  Of course, you leave all the sour cream in. Also, why would you add garlic?  I used lots of pepper, salt of course, and my Eastern Europe spices. Keep the measurements because they are perfect.  

I remember the first time I had beef stroganoff as a kid, it was wonderful. I'm vegetarian now, so I loved having the same amazing dish without meat. Thank you!

This is very good.  I wasn't sure how I would like the Portbello Mushrooms but they were so good.  Easy, fast and great tasting.  It's going to be a go-to when we need a creamy hot meal.

I followed the recipe (almost) and my husband who is a meat eater loved it.  We both did.  The only difference was I used 3 tsp of arrowroot instead of all purpose flour which made it gluten free.

Even with only one half cup of sour cream, it was too much sour cream. It was good before any sour cream was added.

Very good! Followed the second reviewers recommendations adding white wine, soy sauce, worchester sauce, and only 1/2 cup sour cream. I didn’t remove the mushrooms and simmered in broth until desired thickness was reached . It only made about 3 servings of this is the only item being served.

As others have stated, I’m rating the dish created with the  changes I have made.  It was delicious!!  I sauteed the onions for 15 to 20 minutes until caramelized and then added the mushrooms(1/2 Pound portobello, 1/2 pound Shiitake.  I also added 1/2 cup red wine to the mushrooms.  After the mushrooms became limp, I removed them and put in a bowl.  I added the vegetable broth to my pot and added 2 TBS of Worcester sauce and 1/4 c soy sauce.  I then mixed 2 TBS flour with 1/2 c sour cream.  I wished this until well blended and started to thicken, I then added the mushrooms back and added salt and pepper to taste.  I then served mine on top of steamed spaghetti squash.  I will be making this again!!

My rating for this recipe is based off of preparing the dish as the recipe reads. I figure if I have to make changes to it than I am preparing a different recipe so here goes.  Bland!   Very little flavor. I would recommend reading the reviews before you prepare this dish and making some of those changes. It was very easy to prepare.

I made this recipe as written and it didn’t turn out very well. Way too much sour cream and the onion taste was overwhelming. Otherwise it was very bland. I will not make it again.

This is one of our go-to recipes! Easy, tasty, keeps in the fridge and freezes well. I like to add some fake seasoned meat (Boca or Tofurky) and play with the spices, but all in all it's fantastic as a base for experimentation or on its own. Yum!

I took the advice of others and included some chopped garlic and Worcestershire sauce. Also, I added about 2 tsp of Greek seasoning. 

And I didn't start the egg noodles until the sauce was simmering.

With these changes, this recipe was quite good.

As written this is bland. With some changes however, this is wonderful. I did add garlic and sauteed in brown butter. Used beef broth (no veggie broth on hand) and reduced with mushrooms and onions still in the pan.  I added cornstarch to the sour cream and a splash of soy sauce and Worcestershire then warmed it all. This was delicious. It's definitely going into my meatless meal file.

as is, this is good, but bland. i took the advice of other reviews and added a generous splash of red wine, some minced garlic, and far less sour cream (about 1/2 cup), and it was delicious. i’m vegetarian, but i cooked some beef tips separately for my meat eating guests, and they LOVED it. absolutely scarfed it down. it was delicious with egg noodles and quite rich. thank you.

These two carnivores didn't even miss the meat in this recipe. It hits all of my stroganoff craving requirements, and is perfect for Meatless Mondays. I'm keeping this recipe close at hand for sure.

I used baby Bella and sauteed sirloin steak strips in a separate pan for my meat eating boyfriend. I made the recipe as is for me and added about 4-5 ladels of the sauce to his strips. We both thought the meal was excellent. We will be making this again.

As many others have said, this is pretty bland as written. I added garlic and lots of garlic salt and it made it a 4. And if you aren't vegetarian I would use beef broth, but it still is good without it.

Will definitely make this again. The family loved it. Followed some of the suggestions listed in the reviews. Added some garlic, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce for flavor. Also I doubled the recipe and used  1\2 cup each of red and white wine instead of just broth. Absolute winner in my book.

This was okay.  It was pretty easy to make, and I think the fact that I wasn't wowed by this recipe was more the result of circumstance than anything else.  It took a while between finishing the meal and getting it onto the table, and it is not at its best at room temperature.  

I did make it with shallot butter instead of regular, which I think added some flavor.

Pretty good. I did not remove the mushrooms from the pan. Also didn't mix the flour and sour cream together before adding to the mushrooms - that would have been way too many dishes. Added some Worchestershire and truffle salt at the end.

Loved this recipe.  A few changes.  I added tofu and garlic when you add the mushrooms.  Add salt, pepper and paprika once everything is fried.  While the vegetable broth reducing, add 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar and 1 table spoon tomato paste.  Only use 3/4 cup of sour cream.  Really delicious.

Quite tasty! Good meatless yet hearty dish. I took the suggestions of some other reviews and cooked the onions longer and lower until caramelized, added 2 cloves of garlic, and subbed 1/2 cup of red wine for 1/2 cup of the broth.  I used the full 1 1/2 cups of sour cream and it was perfect for a stroganoff...I'm not sure why so many reviewers are cutting it back to 1/2 a cup, I don't think I would even taste it at that ratio. I will definitely make this again!

Made it vegan by using vegan sour cream.  Used mushroom broth instead of vegetable broth to intensify the mushroom flavor and also added one Not Beef bouillon cube to add the beef flavor.  Really good recipe!

Tried it as is this first time; am thinking I will add some garlic powder next time for just a little kick.  Otherwise, it was great and I will definitely make it again.

This was a good recipe. I followed some of the other reviewers modifications, 1/2 cup sour cream and caramelized onions. I also add some cooking sherry and it really enhanced the flavors, plus some salt and pepper.

Hubby said it was very good.  Stayed with recipe except for splash  of worcheshire.  This time I used beef broth because it was all I had.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to adjust the recipe but overall it was pretty good. I cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup,  only 1 tsp. of flour and several generous shakes of salt, pepper, soy sauce, worcheshire sauce and 3 clove of garlic.

Loved the Recipe.  Thought it was delicious as is.  Very easy to make.  The parsley is totally unnecessary and nearly ruins the dish.  Otherwise this is a quick 30 minute dinner and easy to make.

Came out tasty - made the mods discussed below, soy sauce, Worcestershire, beef broth, garlic. I used four large mushrooms and the ratio was just about right. Used about 1 1/2 cups of sour cream (all of one of those small containers). Thickness of the sauce was good, enough to coat the noodles but not runny. I am making this again!

I used plain yogurt (without high fructose) in lieu of sour cream and I cooked the onion in avacado oil in lieu of butter.   It was delicious.  Very easy to make.

I am so disappointed! I wish I'd read the reviews, because everything smelled and tasted *amazing* right up until I added in the sour cream. Then all the lovely flavor of the onions, mushrooms, and broth were gone and I could only taste sour cream. I tried to save it. I added in some Worcestershire sauce and more broth, but I still only tasted sour cream. After doctoring it and doctoring it (more broth, more Worcestershire, a bit of tomato paste, some salt), it's now better, something I can eat a whole bowl of. But I wish I could go back to right before I put in the sour cream, when it was very nearly perfect, and only add 1/2 cup or so of sour cream. I will be trying this one again, but following the reviews instead of the recipe. Sorry.

A wonderful idea and is so close to the regular Beef version.  Only changes,... I used beef broth (I'm not a vegetarian) instead and a can of "Healthy Recipe" mushroom soup instead of all that sour cream.  A single dollop on top was enough sour cream for authenticity.

I just made this for dinner and it was absolutely amazing!! As someone who likes to eat vegetarian as much as possible, I really appreciated this recipe. The only change I made was adding a little salt to each plate which really brought out the flavors. Also, don't skip the parsley since it really added a lot!!

This was very tasty and serves a great purpose.  Meatless Mondays!  Only one skeptical child, but my older daughter and husband enjoyed it.  Next time, I may try adding beer for added flavor.  As we are not vegetarian, just looking to consume less meat, I actually used beef broth instead of vegetable broth.  Additionally, I was unsure about how it was served and mixed the sauce in with the egg noodles.  Big mistake.  It still tasted great, but I won't due that again.

I loved this recipe with a couple of tweaks made after I read some reviews and different recipes. I cut the sour cream to one cup and the vege stock/broth to one cup. I also added 2 tsp of minced garlic, 2 tsp of soy sauce, a 2 tsp of paprika and about a half of a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Loved it and managed to finish it all myself in 24 hours. Oops.

I'm a college student, so I tried to make this as easy as possible on me. I replaced the portobellos with baby Bella's, the sour cream with Greek yogurt, but I did take the advice of adding some soy sauce and a bit of red wine to the sauce. WORTH IT!

Pretty good. I only used 3/4 cup of sour cream, and felt that it was "too milky" for me. Next time I'll only add a dollop of sour cream, and experiment using Kitchen Bouquet.

Easy and tasty! I chopped the mushrooms so the shape wasn't recognizable to my mushroom hater. A great meatless Monday meal!

When my 11 yr old daughter decided to become vegetarian I was scared.  This was wonderful though!  We all loved it, and I'm extremely picky.  I use way more mushrooms than called for though.

Thanks to the reviews I did alter a bit, by decreasing the amount of sour cream and adding some worchestshire sauce. Also I added some red pepper to give it a "kick"! Husband and I loved it! Easy, easy meal to make!

If making with vegetable broth, you will need to season well. I used beef broth and it still  needed seasoning as others mentioned. I added Worcestershire sauce and paprika. I left out the parsley for personal preference. Everyone liked it- will make again.

I read a lot of the reviews and finally decided to make the dish as written. I'm glad I did. It was excellent. I love stroganoff with meat, but I didn't even miss it this time. I'll be making this again. Thanks CHORDATA!

I am addicted to this recipe. Not being a beef fan the Portobello mushrooms are a great replacement. I love the sauce but you definitely have to like sour cream. I make the recipe exactly as is.

I followed the directions exactly. And the outcome was more like a sour cream stroganoff instead of a mushroom stroganoff. And I added garlic powder to the recipe after making because it was lacking something. I think if I try this again, I will add minced garlic and either less sour cream or maybe use cream cheese.

I followed this recipe almost exactly except I used one 8oz container of sour cream instead of 1.5 cups. I wish I'd read some of the reviews first. Next time I will definitely add garlic and cut down the sour cream to a half cup. I'll also cook the mushroom mix on a lower heat (mine cooked up a bit too fast and got a little burnt, but that's my fault). I'm otherwise happy with the recipe for something quick that doesn't require too many special ingredients or planning ahead. :)

I just want to let people know that if you want to call this a vegetarian dish do not add Worcestershire sauce!  There are anchovies in it.  If you want something that tastes a lot like it, try Pickapeppa sauce; it's really good and strictly vegetarian!
Also, I put a lot more mushrooms, garlic and I also added red and green bell peppers; which is the way my mother always made it.

OMG !! I was vegetarian for 12 years during the 90's in the UK - So I have tried LOTS of restaurant Mushroom STroganoff!! This was FANTASTIC!!

My DH decides he is not eating anything with eyes (Did the joke with the potatoe he wasnt amused LMAO but I giggled) anyways He Loved this (I am still reeling with pleasure for this!)

I did add soy and I added garlic.....DID YOU KNOW WORCESTER SAUCE HAS ANCHOVIE OIL IN IT?? Would skip if your vegetarian!!

I prepared this using some of the other suggestions; added garlic, reduced the sour cream. I added paprika & a tiny bit of celery seeds. Two of our children are vegetarians, with one closer to vegan so the vegan Worcestershire Sauce is a staple in our cupboard, I added a dash, plus a dash of Kikoman. It went over well here & I will keep it on my go-to list.. Thanks so much everyone.

I thought this was great as is.  I did use button mushrooms which im sure makes a difference. So making this with portobello mushrooms makes it better.  I had left over turkey so i added it in my left overs the next day. It was even better.

This was a great and MASSIVE dish! I would change the number of servings from 4 to 6, we have PLENTY left over and will be eating this for days.   I used crimini and white mushrooms instead of portobello, simply because of what I had on hand. I cut the vegetable broth to 1c, and the sour cream to 1/2c, as others did. I also omitted the parsley, because I did not have any fresh on hand. I substituted whole wheat egg noodles for standard dry egg noodles as well.   I added a clove of garlic to the onion and butter while cooking. I also left everything in one skillet, instead of removing onions from the skillet and cooking the broth as a separate dish.  This was a great dish, and previous suggestions were SO helpful.

This was pretty good, but I wish I had read the reviews before making it. WAY TOO MUCH PARSLEY. Maybe I didn't chop it fine enough, but that was the #1 complaint at the table. Sounds like white wine and garlic would make it better too. I didn't mind all the sour cream.

My husband loved this! I'm not a big mushroom fan, but I thought it was pretty good. We didn't have portobellos so just used jarred mushrooms. Next time we'll get the rights ones, I'll also use less sour cream next time - it overpowered the other flavors. We served with green beans.

Like others, I used olive oil instead of butter, and added a good amount of chopped garlic with the onion.  I also threw my mushrooms in the food processor to make a "mince"....I told my kids it was ground beef because they "hate" mushrooms...but they enjoyed this! (I told them later what it really was!)  I don't know if I'll be able to get this by them again, but over all a good recipe with some changes.

It was great overall. I did modify the recipe slightly, however.   1 T of butter Add only 1/2 onion 1 cup of sour cream 1 1/4 cup veggie broth Add more mushrooms :)!    I'm a dietetian so little changes such as this can really make a difference nutrient and taste wise!!

WAY TOO MUCH SOUR CREAM. I think if you reduce it almost half this would have come out better. I've made stroganoff before and this recipe was quite different.

We loved it! I think next time I will use a lot less sour cream and try olive oil instead of butter just to make it a little healthier. Also, I threw some white mushrooms in with the onion in the food processor to make the sauce thicker and more filling. Adding garlic to this recipe really made it taste yummy! Definitely a keeper!

Very good!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and added a FEW dashes of Worcester sauce (I love that sauce).  I also added just a dash of apple cider vinegar.  I minced three cloves of garlic (use less if you're not as big of a fan).  Finally, I used only 1 cup of sour cream.  Next time I'll use a half cup like others have suggested and will probably add some cream of mushroom to it.  Oh, I also used a few dashes of paprika, which gave it a nice kick.  Very comforting meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe and it turned out great!  I did read the reviews beforehand and did cut out 1/2 cup of sour cream.  However, many reviews mentioned adding worcestershire sauce for taste....This is a vegerarian recipe, keep in mind that worcestershire does have anchovies in it.  The dash of soy sauce was good but did make it salty.

I bought the ingredients for this recipe and proceeded to neglect the mushrooms; needless to say, by the time I got around to cooking this, they were sad indeed. However, I sauteed the mushrooms the night before with 2 tsp of butter and refrigerated them for the next day. When ready, I sauteed the onion with 3 cloves of garlic in a bit of olive oil, and threw the mushrooms back in towards the end. I added a few shakes of soy and worcestershire and took scraped them into a bowl after a few moments. To the pan, I added 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and reduced by 1/3. Finally, I added it all back in off the heat along with a mixture of 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 1/2 tbsp of flour (whisked together separately). Cooked for 2-3 minutes until nice and thick, and added a few grates of fresh black pepper. Served over egg noodles -- absolutely delicious and easy, too! A definite keeper recipe!   Would be interested to see the nutrition facts after such a dramatically reduced amount of sour cream...

I thought it was a little too heavy on the sour cream, but it was pretty good.  My husband wasn't a huge fan of it but he would probably prefer meat to mushrooms. :)

This was really good, with the modifications that other reviewers suggested.  I added a clove of garlic, dried porcini mushrooms, a teaspoon each of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce, plus a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste to the sauce.  I also cut the sour cream/flour.  It ended up being a very satisfying stroganoff, despite the lack of meat.  I'm glad to have found a delicious substitute for one of my favorite dinners from the old meat-eating days.

The sauce as written is wonderful.  I used regular button mushrooms and when removing the mushrooms and onions to make sauce, I microwaved 24 1/2 oz ready made meatballs, then returned all to sauce as directed to heat together.  Great meal!  BevKn

This was excellent, but just short of five-star in my opinion.  I should have read the reviews regarding the sour cream - next time I'll cut that in half as the sour cream flavor was very strong.  Other than that, my only change was to add some garlic.  I could see where a little wine or maybe some Worcestershire, as others mentioned, would work well here, too.

Was amazing with some alterations! I replaced butter with olive oil and added 1 large clove of garlic for some more flavor. I also added some worcestershire and soy sauce to the veggie broth, and used whole wheat flour to thicken. Like the other review said, try to get your egg noodles to finish at the same time so they don't get cold and stick together.

Mmmm, great idea in theory.  If everyone rated the recipe as written, I don't think it'd have 4 stars.  Is sounds funny to say that Stroganoff has too much sour cream flavor, but this one does!  For me & my fiance, this was one of those meals where your first couple bites are delicious, but then you're already sick of it.  If I chose to give vegetarian Stroganoff another chance, I will try one of the beef stroganoff recipes on this site and leave out the meat.

I used soy sour cream and instead of butter canola oil, to keep onions from browning and a little clarified butter, then olive oil after the mushrooms were sauteing.I usually use garlic for everything however, this is a German or, Russian food not Italian. I loved beef stroganoff when I could eat whatever I wanted to, with real sour cream and this is so close as is I was satisfied and glad I am now able to eat one of my favorite entrees again. It was perfect as is.

I thought that this was a super-delicious meatless entree - with additional seasonings.  I added quite a bit of paprika & garlic to the onion/mushrooms.  I'm not vegetarian, so used beef broth to which I added some worcestershire sauce.  Cut back on the amount of sour cream, but could have used even less.  And I was making just two servings, but used an entire 8oz pkg of white mushrooms.

This is a great recipe.  I added a few things based on some previous reviews....fresh minced garlic, a beef bouillon cube to the vegetable broth, and used a little less sour cream.  It turned out so flavorful.  A huge hit with the hubby.

Very good and pretty quick recipe!  I made a few changes based on my preference and other reviews.  While cooking the mushroom and onion mixture, I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and about a tablespoon each of soy sauce, worcester sauce, and ketchup.  I also decreased the amount of sour cream to 1 cup and it was more then enough.  My husband loved it and asked me to make more for his lunch the next day!  :)

This was very good.  I made only a few alterations, adding garlic and using a wider variety of mushrooms.  The flavor was great and the dish was very easy to make!

I followed other suggestions to reduce the sour cream to 1/2 cup and flour to 2 tbsp.  I also added Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce after the sour cream.  I also left the mushrooms in the pan when making the sauce and it turned out great!

This was a great recipe with suggestions from previous reviewers.  Added Worcestershire and soy sauces, and it was delicious.

This was amazing! I did use the modifications from several reviews - add minced garlic, worcestershire and soy sauce, as well as reduce the sour cream to 1/2 cup. I used non-dairy sour cream and butter to make it vegan, and it was still delicious! What a great winter meal!

This was spectacular with the following changes:
Substituted 1 1/2 c veg broth with 1 c beef broth, 1/2 c sherry, and 2 T worchestershire
Substituted 1 c sour cream with 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c cream of mushroom soup

Followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  Will definitely make again.

This was good, though I agree with reviewers that it needs beef broth for that stroganoff flavor. Even though it wasn't quite stroganoffy enough, still very good.

This was a good substitution if you can't or don't want the beef. I made it with different mushrooms BUT you must use portobello to maintain that "beef" stroganoff expected taste.  I would cut the sourcream amount to just 1 cup it was a bit too much), but I would make it again.

I still wasn't wowed by this even with the alterations but it was nonetheless a good meal. I caramelized the onions on low heat for about 25-35 mins. I then added a mixture of portobello, cremini and white button mushrooms. After that I added a splash of red wine vinegar, 1 tsp of soy sauce and 2-3 tsps of Worcestershire sauce and the broth. After that cooked out I seasoned with salt and pepper added in 3/4 cup of sour cream and 2 tbsp of flour and cooked it on low heat for 15 mins and added the chopped fresh parsley in. The color was an icky grey, did not look appetizing but the flavor was nice.

This was fine but nothing special, we thought.  We also added minced garlic, Worcestershire and soy sauce but it never thickened the way I would have liked.  Good vegetarian choice but not something we'll have in regular dinner rotation.  UPDATE:  After using only 1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream, I got the texture to where I wanted it.  We'll be having this more often with these changes.

good stuff!  i added soy sauce and worcestershire sauce like everyone else.  i also made the rue with the butter and flour so i didn't have that raw flour taste...my 2 year old loved it!  and my four year old who only likes mac and cheese ate half with out complaining so it is a start.

definitely not the best recipe i've found. incorporating some of the advice in the reviews, i added worc. and soy sauce, and cooked the mushrooms with a minced clove of garlic. despite this, the sauce was overpowering. I've never had stroganoff before, so i'm not sure how valid my opinion is - i didn't think it was that great though.

I took combined advice from K. Wallace and cookinggirllj, adding the garlic, white whine, soy sauce, and worchestshire sauce.  I didn't cut back the sour cream though as my boyfriend loves sour cream.  It was still slightly bland, next time I will probably add some different mushrooms for added flavors.

Added garlic. Wish I had some wine to throw in, but this was awesome!  Would be great with chicken added...with or without the mushrooms.  Could also be used as "the starch" served on the side.

This is a fast and easy way to get the meaty taste of stroganoff without the meat.  I used my turkey broth from Thanksgiving in it instead of vegetable broth and it was still wonderful!  Thanks for a really great and useful recipe!

I found the outcome of this recipe ok.  

I did substitute some parts:

-Instead of butter I used Olive Oil
-cornstarch instead of flour

At the end of it all it was a little bland and a little on the sour side because of all the sour cream.  Next time I will try what other reviewers have done with the soy sauce, worchestersire, etc.

Outstanding recipe.  Everyone in the house loved it even the baby who demanded more bites.  It is creamy without being overly so and the amount of sour creame gives it a good bite without being overpowering.  It was simple to fix and took a minimum of time.  This will be one that reamins a constant for us.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was ok.  It tasted mainly of sour cream, when I was hoping for more and diverse flavour.  Probably won't be made again in my home.

Absolutely delicious. As a recent veggie-convert, I've been missing my mom's beef stroganoff. This is delicious!

I did not enjoy this dish, nor did my dinner guest. The sour cream is all I could taste. It has been years since I last ate stroganoff (back when I was a carnivore), and I remembered it tasting much richer and more flavorful.

excellent recipe. i added garlic, worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce as others recommended. also reduced sour cream to 1/2 C. added Quorn chicken patties, but i think it would also be great with some morningstar crumbles.

This is a GREAT recipe.  My whole family loved it.  I added a little bit of garlic powder for extra flare.
Thanks for sharing!

tup tup tasty! I just made this and...mmm! It's good! I didn't have Portobello Mushrooms so I just used run of the mill mushrooms and it was great! Next time, I might add a slight touch of garlic powder though!

I made the following changes and was very pleased:

1. Used beef broth, rather than veggie broth. Next time, I'll go all veggie to see if it's still great.
2. Added 1/2 tsp soy sauce, and 1/4 tsp worstershire and simmered it with the broth. Next time I will also add 1/4 cup red wine during this step.
3. cut flour down to 2 Tbsp.

Delicious!  I did a little tweaking (worcestershire, tamari, paprika, low-fat sour cream) .. but man was it good!  Just went ahead and used the whole can of veggie broth and thing of sour cream (16 oz) .. let it simmer a bit .. was a little runny - if I would have had patience I could have thickened it up more - but I was hungry! :)  Very easy and tasty recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  I added two tablespoons of garlic and 2 tablespoons of tamari (type of soy sauce).  I used light sour cream and whole wheat noodles for a slightly healthier version and it worked nicely.  I've seen that a lot of stroganoff recipes call for nutmeg, so I think that I will add a pinch next time.  This recipe will definitely become part of my menu rotation. Thanks!

Yum!  My husband (who isn't a big fan of mushrooms) even liked it.  My toddler liked it too.  I didn't have sour cream, so I used 2/3 of an 8 oz. block of cream cheese.  It didn't need any more.  I also thickened it with a couple T. of cornstarch instead of flour.

Awesome basic recipe! I improvised and added chopped pork, celery and fresh spinach. When it was done, I put everything in a baking dish, covered it with shredded cheese and broiled it. Yummy!

This is a delicious recipe.  I followed other reviewers suggestions by adding soy sauce & reducing the sour cream by 1/2 cup.  Next time I will add more mushrooms.  My husband & toddler went nuts over this.  I will definitely make it again!  Try it, you'll like it!

This was very good with tweaking!! I added some garlic, more mushrooms, and I cooked the noodles in vegetable broth instead of plain water. Also used half yogurt and half sour cream.  YUMMY.

My boyfriend (age 47) and I (age 37) did not care for this recipe at all and we both usually love portabellas.  It just seemed really bland to us and it was definitely missing something, though I am not sure what, and I am normally very good with spices.  

I gave it a 3 because I think that maybe other types of mushrooms, perhaps a mixture of them, would be much better.  Also, if you have ideas for seasoning, this recipe sure could use it.  The dish was easy to make, though.

Tastes great with rice!  Super creamy and good flavor with some chicken broth.  I probably should've added more mushrooms, but it was absolutely yummy!

This was awesome.  It ended up being a little too thick though so I took some of the juice from some green beans that had been in the crock pot all day and thinned it out a little.  I also grilled a flank steak rare and added that to it.  I made this at work and everyone LOVED it.

We had this last night.  There were a few modifications I made...I didn't use the onions b/c I don't like them.  I used onion powder & garlic powder instead.  Also, I used a whole pound of portobellos and the whole 12 oz. bag of egg noodles.  I didn't have vegetable broth, so I used 2 cups water with a pkg of au jus mix.  It was delicious!  I'll definitely make it again!  :)

I really liked this idea but I wasnt crazy about the sauce. My husband gave it 4 stars but I had to give it three - I think it was missing something - wine maybe - dont know - I will play with it though. Thanks

Creamy, filling, and DELICIOUS!!!  I substituted cremini (baby portabellos) mushrooms for the portabellos after reading other reviews about a funny color.  Turned out fine with the cremini mushrooms.  I also added about 1 cup of vegetarian ground beef and substituted half the sour cream with a condensed mushroom soup for flavor.
