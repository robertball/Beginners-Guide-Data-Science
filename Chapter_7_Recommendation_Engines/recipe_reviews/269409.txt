My only change was substituting more chocolate chips for the chunk chocolate because it was 20 degrees and I didn't want to go out! Delicious cookie. Very rich and very chocolatey. I used a small cookie scoop -- 1", I think -- and wish I'd made them even smaller. Baked  3 dozen and froze another 2 dozen.  My husband loved them.

These are a new favorite, very chocolatey. I did not sprinkle with salt and next time I will probably reduce the salt in the dough by half as they were a bit salty for my family's taste. Instead of the chocolate chunks I mixed in crushed toffee candy and cooked a bit longer for a crisper cookie. These are great with coffee/tea, on their own, and packed in lunches.

These are so good ... I'm already making a deal with myself â€¦ if I eat these while exercising, can I eat more?
