There was an error in this recipe as originally published. The original recipe calls for 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, not eight packages. The correct amount now appears on the recipe.

This recipe was so easy to make. I used Hershey Kisses for the surprise inside, and everyone loved them. The only thing I added was a chocolate cream cheese frosting which went very well with these cupcakes.  I will definitely make them again.

The proportions listed in this recipe HAVE to be off.  It calls for 8 8oz packages of cream cheese.  I used 4 and doubled everything else and STILL had some left over. It said to mix chocolate chips in with the cream cheese but didn't have the chips listed in the ingredients.  Not keeping this one in my recipe box.

7/12/01:  Looks like the recipe has been corrected.  I might just try it again.

I've been searching for a recipe my grandma used to make and this is pretty darn close.  She used the foil mini cups instead of full size.  I think her end result is more like a brownie than cake.  So call your grandma before she dies, don't wait like I did!

Anyway, I used a can of cherry pie filling instead of the maraschino cherries.  I just put half a cherry with some goo on top of the cream cheese mix before baking.  I also used dark chocolate chips because IMHO they are the only kind!

You do have to be careful about filling these too full, the cake mix overwhelmed a few of these.  My grandmas were always level with the top of the foil cup.  She was a very careful chef!  One recipe made many more than 48 minicupcakes.

Oh, and I also tried the new Yogurt/cream cheese mix...tasted too much like yogurt.  Second batch I used 1/3 less fat cc and it was great.

I had it brought in as a birthday treat, only to find out that there was a problem over the diversity of "treats" in the "muffins" (I refuse to call them cupcakes because they are not cake) ALso, some kids with allergies had trouble... Like the nuts and such.

This was awesome,but the "heaping spoonful of cream cheese mixture" was a bit off...might need to double that part of the recipe.  Family loved it!

Not so good.  Maybe I'll try it with some other cream filling but this one just didn't go over so well.  Too much extra stuff on these.

Made these a couple of weeks ago and they turned out great! I added a kiss in the middle of the cream cheese filling. Sent them off to my husbands work and had request for recipes within an hour! :-) Thanks for making me look like a baker sedona39
