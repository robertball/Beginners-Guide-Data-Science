I followed this exactly, and my husband and I loved it! Thanks! Also, I did add the peas...
4/18/2017 I want to repeat that we love this recipe.  I always chuckle when I read reviews from people who don't follow the directions, and then give the recipe a bad review.  Yikes! Follow the directions and enjoy this dish! Yummy!

Simple Chicken Curry Haiku: "Daughter said of this, 'it looks like mustard gravy!' Turns out we loved it!" Despite its bright yellow hue, I am still surprised at how much we adored this meal. I had to toss in a handful of frozen green beans (would've preferred peas, but was out) during the last 5 min. boil w/ the chicken b/c the color was so off-putting. I halved the recipe for 3 of us, and we ate every last sloppy bit, pouring what seemed to be a ton of the sauce over a blend of quinoa and brown rice. Even w/o the addition of the green beans, it would've tasted just as wonderful, and there's no question that when I give something 5 stars, it's definitely going in the keeper file!

I added mushrooms and frozen peas. I cut the salt in half.  I also used ghee instead of butter,  whole wheat flour and lite coconut milk.  It had to cook about 15 minutes to get to the right consistency, but it was good.  A bit healthier alternative.

Absolute favorite! I make it at least once a month. I do double the curry though. Trying the shrimp version next. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good!
I added a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetable mix and subbed lemon zest because I didn't have lemon juice.
Will definitely make again!

Good recipe - we enjoyed it.  I did reduce the curry powder as I was concerned about the amount.  Ultimately, I had adjusted it to 2 teaspoons and that was plenty for us.

This was delicious! Followed the recipe and didn't make any changes. My kids loved it, too. We put it over white rice. I will make this again!

This was fantastic, we love garlic so I added a few cloves after the onion was tender plus some bell pepper, broccoli and carrots. The whole family loved this meal.

Thank you for sharing this recipe, my family thoroughly enjoyed tonight's dinner!

Really good recipe. Then I made the healthier version. Wheat flour, honey instead of sugar, avocado oil instead of butter, Low sodium chicken broth. It was still good. Served with brown basmati rice and broccoli

This was so good--creamy and savory! I followed it almost exactly except I used a little nutmeg instead of ginger, used almond milk, and added some green pepper with the onion. It was delicious over rice and I'll definitely be making it again.

This was very simple and very good.  Everyone in the family loved it.  I will play with it a bit cause I would like it to have a little more curry flavor, but that's me. I love curry. :)

SOOO easy and delicious! Mix in some more veggies when stir frying for a healthier dish. Very adaptable-almost any veggies will do the trick

Made it mostly according to the recipe but I added some coconut oil instead of all butter. Maybe that would account for the bitter flavor.
