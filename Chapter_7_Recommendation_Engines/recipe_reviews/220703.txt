I loved the fish and the salad. The only thing I had to change was the vinaigrette. It was incredibly sour and not flavourful enough when I followed the recipe, so I added 2 tbsp honey, some salt, and 2 tbsp minced fresh ginger, and I liked it much better. Thanks for the recipe.

Already had a salmon marinating and was only able to try the salad dressing - this one's delicious! Followed the recipe to a T. Served it with spinach, salmon, onions, edamame and chow mein noodles.

I tried this without the noodles and with  lettuces and veggies from my garden.  Everyone loved the salmon and the salad.  My children both asked for more salmon.  I personally want to modify the vinaigrette and go with about 2/3rds of the recommended rice vinegar.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe is super easy and extremely tasty. Remember to lightly grease the grill(turn the flame off). Great week night healthy meal.
