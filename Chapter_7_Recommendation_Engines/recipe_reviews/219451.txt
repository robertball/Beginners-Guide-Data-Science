I found this recipe rather blah. Rather than using the foil, I added thickly sliced onions and rest the chicken on these pieces. Then, seasoned it with garlic pieces and fresh tarragan in the cavity and under the skin. I love it lemony too so added a whole lemon that I pierced with a fork numerous times and placed it in the cavity also. The slo-cooker makes it so tender and convenient!

I like the idea of elevating the chicken using the foil balls, adding carrots and onions, and using the slow cooker to make the evening meal easier. BUT I really prefer the spice mixture of Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style. That is by far my favorite whole chicken recipe on this site. This one is just ok for me.

This chicken was so moist and tender, melt in your mouth tender.  However, I didn't like the idea of cooking my chicken along with aluminum that's why I only gave it 4 stars.  I put the whole seasoned chicken on top of baby carrots and celery and sliced onions which added great flavor to the broth.  You definitely have to season the chicken well.  I used the drippings/broth to make a delicious gravy.  Definitely a keeper.

I injected my chicken with a butter sauce and used a creole seasoning. It's soooo juicy! My family loves it!

I had never thought to roast a chicken in the crock pot.  So glad I tried it.  After reading the reviews, I used some spices with more layers of flavor as someone else did, the sticky chicken recipe.  I also put onions in as well as used the foil.  It was a huge hit!

I purchased a roaster with a pop up timer and the chicken was completed after 5 hours. I never had a chance to put in the veggies. tasted delicious.
