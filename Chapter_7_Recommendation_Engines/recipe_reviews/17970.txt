Great recipe!  I made the healthier version described by another reviewer and substituted half the oil for an equal amount of applesauce.  I also substituted 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for 1/4 cup of the white flour.   It turns out a loaf that is not too sweet but has a nice tart-sweet taste.  I devoured one loaf in just a day by myself.  Next time I will try all applesauce for the oil and more whole wheat flour for the white flour.

This is a very good, flavorful and moist bread. I adjusted the recipe as follows with favorable results: 1) cut the recipe in half (to make one loaf), but still used 1 whole egg; 2) added about 25% more rhubarb and cut it up into blueberry-sized pieces; 3) used apple sauce instead of oil; 4) increased the cinnamon and added most of it to the batter; and, 5) added flour to the topping, a bit at a time, until it became crumbly enough to sprinkle on top of the bread with my fingers.

This bread is so YUMMY!! I found it refreshingly different; perfect for Spring. I packaged the second loaf to send to my boyfriend's office, but he refused to take it! He enjoyed the bread so much, he would not share it. I added half of the cinnamon to the bread batter and the other half to the topping mixture and I thought that added just the right amount of spice to the bread batter. I will be making this again as Mother's Day gifts and as a "Welcome to the Neighborhood" gift for our new neighbors. Thanks for a great recipe!

I will also be freezing rhubarb to make this later in the year, it was great! I increased the rhubarb to 2 c (next time I'll use 2.5) and used almonds instead of walnuts. I added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and some oats to the topping mixture, it was the perfect touch. This bread held up well at room temperature for several days, retaining its moisture and never tasting stale. Next time I'll add grated lemon rind and maybe replace some of the oil with yoghurt, it was possibly a bit greasy.

This is one of my favorite recipes. My mom used to make it and its especially good chilled the next day. I tried it this way, with the topping added before baking, and it was good, but i like it a little better if it's added halfway through so it stays crunchy on top. excellent recipe!!

Not the prettiest bread I ever made, but it sure does taste good!  The topping sort of sinks into the bread making it look like it has little craters, or kind of a pebbly looking top.  And it slices a little crumbly, althoughI barely waited until it was cooled, let alone chilled.  I substituted a cup of buttermilk for the milk and lemon juice and kind of wish I would have left out the nuts as their presence was a little too prominent for me.  So why the three stars and not higher?  The baking time is WAY off, and frankly, with nearly 200 reviews, I'm surprised no one else has commented on this.  Forty minutes?  No way.  I baked this in a Pyrex 8x4" loaf pan at 325 degrees, for about 55-60 minutes, which is fairly typical for most quick breads.

This was great bread. I love rhubarb, and we have a plant in the backyard. I was bored this evening, so I decided to harvest it, and make this bread. It turned out really moist, and really tasty. I left the walnuts out as I don't really like them, and added a little extra rhubarb, and it was still really flavourful. I love the sourness of the rhubard with the sweetness of the bread. It's a good thing it makes 2 loaves because the 1st on is almost all gone! I think it would be great if some strawberries were added as well.

This is a deLICious sweet bread!  The brown sugar batter (no white sugar), is GREAT with the tartness of the rhubarb.  I used half canola oil & subbed the other half with homemade-today applesauce (just call me Martha), and used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour.  Had to use pecans because wasn't sure my walnuts were fresh enough.  This bread turned out GREAT.  Thank you, Lori! You helped to use a fraction of the rhubarb from our garden and gave us an excuse to use more!  It would be fun to try with other fruits too.

Wonderful texture and flavor. I really like the fact that the tartness of the rhubarb makes the bread seem not so sweet. I have found, however, that with any recipe that calls for rhubarb, cut and measure out your rhubarb first. The put in a freezer-safe bag or container and freeze at least overnight. Take out and let thaw before using in your  recipe. Drain using a colander; rhubarb will be very mushy. It is a time-consuming step, but well worth the effort. Especially in pies and breads, the rhubarb comes out of the oven very tender. Not to mention it takes all the cooking time to soak up all the flavors of the recipe, not to tenderize. Try it and see if it works!

Great!  I've never baked anything with rhubarb before, and at first it tasted...  different.  But after I got over its "differentness," it became one of my favorites!  The crumb topping is wonderful.  Here are some suggestions for other Health Nuts like me - I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, omitted the walnuts and added more rhubarb (walnuts are very high in fat, but it's the good omega-3 fatty acids like in fish and soy), and substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour.  You would never guess it's "healthy"!  Also, next time I will make in two 8x4 instead of 9x5 pans.

This recipe was awesome for me!  I added some cinnamon to the batter as well as the topping; enough to my liking and I thought it made the bread taste better.  I made two  batches and in the second I added probably a 1/4 more cup flour to thicken up the mix a bit and added probably a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.  In the topping, I also mixed the sugar, cinnamon together with COLD butter, into a crumble and it spread much easier....the second batch was way better!  I also upped the rhubarb to 2-2 1/2 cups and it tasted/worked just fine!  An overall GREAT recipe with a few modifications!

Wow, haven't had anything "rhubarb" for about 50 years except fond memories of those delicious rhubarb pies my mother used to make so I wanted to make this bread.  I got the rhubarb from the produce dept and it was already sliced and I wonder if that was the problem.  I followed the recipe except used low fat sour cream in place of the milk and did use cinnamon/nutmeg in the flour.  I cut the rhubarb into small cubes and it made exactly 2 cups.  I used 4 baby loaf pans and it took an hour to bake.   The topping was as the recipe said and it didnt' sink into the bread as I added the nuts to the topping instead of in the bread mixture.  Couldn't wait for this to finish baking.   What a disappintment!  There is no flavor to this bread.  Its very moist and tastes good with butter on it but it has no particular flavor.  I wonder if the rhubarb was old or what?
Don't think I will make again, so sorry!

Great recipe! I followed the advice of others and used half applesauce/half oil, as well as half whole wheat/half AP flour. I made them into muffins (easier to share at work) and they turned out beautifully! I skipped the nuts this time (not everyone loves them, oddly) but will for sure add next time! Standard-size muffin took about 25 min. Added struesel about 18 minutes into cooking time and it worked well. Also added about 1 T cinnamon to batter to give extra flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is definitely a keeper. I made a few alterations, but it's mostly original. Just split the flour half/half white and wheat flour. And, split the oil, 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cut unsweet. applesauce. I added and extra 1 tsp. vanilla and cinammon to the batter. Also, put in 1/2 cup more rhubarb (love it). Great recipe, just mix some powder sugar and lemon juice, and drizzle over loaves. Yummy!

I got rhubarb from my mother in law yesterday. I looked for recipes on how to fix it. I found this bread and made it first thing this morning. It turned out so good, I gave my second loaf to my parents and made two more loafs for myself. I ate almost a third of the first loaf before my husband came home from work. THis is a wonderful tasting bread and will be great to make on a cold day this fall!

I had leftover rhubarb from making rhubarb/strawberry crisp and it was a little wilted, so I decided to make this and it was a good solution for rhubarb on it's last leg!  It was good, but I thought it definitely needed to be eaten with butter or jelly on it.  Next time I'll use cinnamon in the batter instead of just putting it on top.

I made this because I had leftover rhubarb from a pie recipe. Though it was moist bread, I almost wonder what it would taste like if you also added apples to it. Who knows?

Very, very good.  It's not the prettiest looking bread but it's delicious, especially the next day.   For gift giving, I might try adding the topping later into the baking so it looks better as other reviewers suggested.  I am also going to try this substituting the apple  for rhubarb.  I am always disappointed when I run out of rhubarb and can't make any more of this bread!

Very good bread!  I was more than a little skeptical about the baking time - it just didn't seem long enough but it tested done after 40 minutes.  Then when I cut a sample about 30 minutes later it seemed kind of "loose" like it really hadn't baked long enough.  However, it was just perfect this morning and quite tasty.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you so much!

I've made this twice, the second time, I made sure to chop the rhubarb into small pieces so there wouldn't be mushy parts in the bread.  I also doubled the nuts and the topping.  Excellent.

My husband enjoyed this bread. I will have to wait to taste it myself, as I have a head cold and can't taste anything---:-(   I think that next time I will adjust the recipe with half oil and half applesauce, as other posters recommended, and definitely add more rhubarb. I could see that the texture was soft---not heavy, which is good. Fortunately, I put one of the loaves in the freezer, so there will still be some for me later. I would also recommend chopping the rhubarb coarsely, for more flavor.

I am not a huge rhubarb fan.  I was given some for my husband who is a huge fan. I could eat this bread ALL DAY LONG. It is so good. I am going to make it many more times.  I made as is and it was fantastic. I cooked it about 5 minutes longer than suggested.

We used 2 cups of rhubarb and added 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter (at the suggestion of some previous reviewers). I baked both loaves in dark pans, and 40 minutes was perfect. I did use parchment paper (again at previous reviewers suggestion). I did use the topping but may try it once without it as it seemed good enough with the extra cinnamon in the batter.

5 for flavor...4 for final product.  As is typical for me, I couldn't get the bread out of the pan.  LINE with PARCHMENT in the future!!  (And there will be a future.)  I subbed melted butter and coconut oil for the vegetable oil and used vinegar instead of the lemon juice as it was what I had on hand.  Other than that I followed directions and the taste and texture were fabulous.  It also took about an hour for the loaves to be done.  Next time I might try making into muffins instead -- shorter cooking time, and I don't have to worry about sticking.  Liners. :)

This was the BEST rhubarb bread, if not the best bread I have ever had. Moist, flavorful, and the perfect amount of sweetness! This recipe is absolutely delicious the way it is. My whole family loved it and wanted the recipe, great way to use up your rhubarb!

I had never used rhubarb before and was just looking for a simple recipe. This one was very simple and tastes amazing!! I always worry that breads will come out too dry but this one is super moist and flavorful. The topping really adds alot of great flavor. I'll definitely use this recipe again. Thanks.

The bread had great flavor but the texture was actually squishy like a sponge. Perhaps I did not bake long enough.  I will try again and cook a bit longer.

Made this last week to take to a women's retreat.  I'm glad I took a slice before I set it out.  I went back to see if there were any leftovers so I could have another slice......nope.  I also left a loaf at home and when I got back there were 2 slices left.  This was amazing bread.  I followed the recipe except that I used 2 cups rhubarb and doubled the topping.  Will probably make again soon.

I really liked this bread and it smelled so good baking.I went ahead and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a little nutmeg  to the batter after reading a few reviews that it was kind of bland.I also used two cups of rhubarb and omitted the nuts.I used applesauce for half the oil and since I didn't have lemon juice I just used white vinegar instead.I made four mini loaves which I baked about 35 minutes and they turned out very moist and flavorful.I especially loved the brown sugar topping and next time I may put a little in the middle too.This is a great bread to make for spring and I plan on buying more rhubarb just for this.

I did substitute half applesauce for half the oil with good results. Also used 1 c whole wheat flour instead of white. I found the bread needed to bake about 55 minutes instead of 40, and found out after that the pans should have been greased and floured instead of just greased. But great texture and taste! I love the tang of the rhubarb with the sweetness of the bread. Oh, and I just sprinkled cinnamon and "raw sugar" on the top of the bread instead of brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter.

Excellent! I have frozen some of my rhubarb and look forward to making this for the holidays. I used applesauce in place of the oil. Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and included enough flour in the topping to make it crumbly. I made 1 regular sized loaf and 3 smaller loaves. Freezes well too.

Great bread!  I added 2 cups of rhubarb instead of 1.5 cups and 1 cup of toasted pecans instead of 1/2 cup.  Also added cinnamon to the batter as other reviewers wrote.  Coat the pans with baking spray and you won't have any stickage.

I have been making this recipe for six years now.  I even freeze my rhubarb so I can make it all year round.  Everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe.  I love that the toping sinks to the bottom of the bread (or muffins) for a sweet suprise.  I do make one modification and that is to add another 1/2 cup of rhubarb to the batter.  Sweet and tangy.  I would have never thought to add cinnamon to rhubarb but wow what a treat.  Thanks, Lori

This was very moist and good.  The topping added a nice crunch even though it didn't look like it would.  I think next time I will add a bit of cinnamon to the batter.

Found myself with a lot of rhubarb so I made up a few batches of this wonderful bread. I looked at some of the reviews and tried it a couple of ways. The first I substituted 1 one snack cup of applesauce for part of the oil and increased the rhubarb to 2 cups. I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon into the batter. I added 1/4 cup oatmeal to the topping, increasing the butter slightly. It turned out wonderful. The second batch I didn't add the applesauce and increased the rhubarb to  1/2 cups - we really like rhubarb, and I really have a lot of it. This was good too, but I think I like it better with the applesauce. In the last batch I am used a slightly smaller pan as I like the bread a bit taller. That is still in the oven. Very good recipe.

I've made this many, many times and always get rave responses. My husband thinks it's the best thing I make and I bake a lot! I substitute raspberries for rhubarb frequently and it comes out great. To keep the raspberries from sinking, just dry them well and toss gently in flour before stirring into the dough. I also use pecans with the raspberries and they combine to make a nice flavor.  I'm sure this recipe could hold other fruits if you wanted to try it!

I have made this twice this  spring and we love it.  I add more than twice the amount of rhubarb and almonds instead of walnuts.  Definitely take much longer to bake so be patient.  Since there is only 2 of us now I half the recipe and make one loaf.  Works well.

This was a hit for Father's day and a wonderful use for the always plentiful Rhubarb in my garden.  I did wait half way through cooking time to put the topping on and kept the nuts out of the bread to mix with the topping.  Everyone raved about the wonderful crunchy topping!  
Thanks!

I like the fact that this makes 2 loaves. I had to use frozen rhubarb and did not thaw it. The topping was a little gloppy so difficult to spread evenly but tasted good. This took a little more than an hour to bake through properly so test carefully. Overall an enjoyable springtime dessert.

This recipe is wonderful! I changed a couple of things just for "healthier reasons" If you substitute 1/2 cup flour for 1/2 cup oats soaked in 3/4 cup boiling water you don't sacrafice moisture at all and it adds texture. I also used 1/3 cup apple  sauce in place of 1/3 cup oil and cut brown sugar to 1 cup. I shared this with friends over for Sunday afternoon supper and they loved it. You can serve it warm out of the oven with a little whip cream.

This is a very good bread.  I used buttermilk instead of milk and lemon juice and pecans instead of walnuts. I did not add the topping, and I always use more vanilla than called for. This is a keeper one for us. It stays nice and moist if it hangs around long enough!

Made some changes: 
- Substituted whole wheat for all-purpose flour. Big improvement in texture. 
- 1.5 cups brown sugar is overkill. Scant 1 cup is good. 
- In previous versions, I've also chucked in strawberries, when I worried that the bread will be too tart.

All I can say is totally delicious, made two loaves today, and one is almost gone. The only thing I changed, was left out the nuts, but other than that found it to be very very good. Will most definitly be making again.

This is a great recipe with a few changes.  I would use 8X4 inch pans and cook at 325 degrees for 60 minutes.  I added almond in place of vanilla extract and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter.  For the topping I used 2 tbls each of white and brown sugar instead of 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Fresh rhubarb is great in this recipe.

I do not know what I did wrong with this recipee but it never got done.  I kept it in the oven an extra 20 min.  I finally took it out and thought this must be how it is supposed to be and then the middle of the bread collapsed.  The part that was done tasted good, but I guess this one just didn't work for me.

After reading some of the reviews - how moist the bread was - I thought it might be better served as a cake (banana nut & coffee cake came to mind as a comparable).  I used a 8x8 baking dish and covered the top with tinfoil until the last 20 mins (had to cook the cake longer than the recommended). I made it twice within 1 week for 2 different groups of friends.  The second time around, I used 2 cups of rhubarb and 1 cup of nuts - as a result the cake was a little less moist (an improvement).  Both groups agreed that it was more like cake than bread and loved the crunchy topping.  An easy recipe which I'll definately do again!

This is a great recipe!  I used rhubarb fresh from the garden - maybe 2-3 cups and I added coconut to the topping for some crunch - YUM.  I don't see how people think it's too sweet!  The only thing I found is that it has to cook longer than stated - about an hour -  and it is so moist that it needs to be tented with foil for the last 20 minutes or so.
This one is going into my 'favorites' file!!

I have made this many times and it is always outstanding...but seeing this is Nov. and I had no rhubarb, I was forced to think  "out of the box" and I used granny smith apples instead...it worked wonderfully!  I suppose this is how new recipes are invented!

Awesome rhubarb recipe!! My husband loved it!!  I'm on my second batch this week!!  I didn't change the recipe much but we love the tartness of the rhubarb so I added 2 cups instead of 1.  Also, added pecans to the second batch because that's what I had in the pantry.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This turned out SO well! Just wanted to let folks know, this recipe veganizes very easily and comes out pretty great. I made some substitutions based on preference and some just because I was missing ingredients (like I used white vinegar in place of lemon juice because I was out of lemon juice). I replaced half a cup of white flour w/ coconut flour (then added in an extra half cup of liquid so it didn't dry out). I used vanilla almond milk in place of regular milk, replaced half the oil with applesauce (as per other commenters), used a flax "egg" (1 Tbsp flax meal, 3 Tbsp water), added an extra half cup rhubarb (per another suggestion), used nearly a full tsp of cinnamon both in the batter AND in the topping, and anywhere it says oil or butter, used coconut oil. I did have to bake it a bit longer, but that often happens when I sub in coconut flour (and thus need extra liquid). SO GOOD. I was worried the sugar might be a bit high, but this bread is not too sweet at all, just enough to balance to tartness of the rhubarb. Definitely give it a try!

The first loaf didn't rise well so I followed the advice of some reviewers and used 2 3/4 cup flour, 1.5 t baking soda, added 1/2 t cinnamon to the batter and used 2 eggs instead of 1.  It is in the oven now and looks like it is rising much better.

fantastic!  very moist and tasty.  I skipped the nuts and added 1/2 cup of chopped strawberries.  Baked for 50 minutes at 325.  Brought the second loaf to work and had people asking for the recipe.

We are big fans of rhubarb. This recipe was my first try at a bread and it was a big hit.  I really liked the recipe at first glance because it included items I normally have on hand. I did increase the rhubard to 2-1/2 cups because of another review and the doubled the walnuts (we're big fans of walnuts, too).  I had to increase the cooking time by 15 minutes due to the extra rhubarb.   This recipe is definitely another great way to cook with rhubarb other than the crisp I usually make.

This tasted soooo yummy, but the bread was pretty heavy and didn't turn out "bready", more bread puddingy.  Well make it again as the 4 mini loaves I made disappeared in 1 day!!

This was delicious!!  I never use oil in my baking anymore.  I replaced the 2/3 cup oil with 2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce and used 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour and it turned out GREAT!!  I also didn't add the nuts because my kids don't like them.  My kids love this bread and I will be freezing rhubarb to make it this winter.

Actually I found the bread very moist and delicious.. I followed recipe mostly but used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and sprinkled some nutmeg in the batter, used 2 cups rhubarb, did not use nuts - it made 4 little loaves however I did cook them at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes then loosely covered it with foil and decreased temp to 325 degrees for another 20 minutes. One of the loaves I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on as I ran out of the other topping...

Will not make again, followed advice added more rhubarb, it cooked for well over an hour still a sloppy, gooey mess. Lightly greasing the pan does not cut it, only half the loaf came out, waste of time, money and rhubarb.

this is (as others said) a very moist dense bread. I liked a lot as did my daycare kids. The rhubarb have it a nice tang. I didn't have any walnuts, so that may have added to the moisture, but I will have them next time and perhaps throw in a bit of spice (allspice or something)

This was easy and delicious. I pretty much followed the recipe except cut it in half but used 1 whole egg, turned out great! Will be making this again with the rhubarb I have frozen.

This was good! I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, and added the topping after it had cooked for 20 minutes. It took closer to 48 minutes to finish cooking for me. Thanks!

Super super super. By necessity, I'm off milk products at the moment, so I made this with unsweetened rice milk - though when I'm back on dairy, I think I'll try this recipe with buttermilk. Other minor changes: I omitted the topping just because I felt like it, used 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. white, pecans instead of walnuts, and cooked it about 60 minutes. I think it would have been excellent with all whole wheat flour, and I would have definitely used applesauce instead of oil, had I had any applesauce or apples. Also, next time I think I'll experiment with agave or honey with a touch of molasses so as to scale back the refined sugars. Hah. After I make all the changes I want, if they work out, I'll post my own recipe :D

very moist and delicious!  i substituted applesauce for the oil and didnt add walnuts.  the topping was good, but was wet so i couldnt "sprinkle" it onto the loaves.  so when it cooked, it just kinda sunk into the bread and made indentions.  good taste, not good appearance.  made the recipe again and added more flour to the topping until it was crumbly and it turned out better.  but then, this recipe is good even without it!  oh, and i double the cinnamon and it wasnt strong at all or real noticeable for that matter.
thanks!

Great recipe and very unique flavors, sometimes it comes out very moist in the middle and not sure why.  Still tastes wonderful.  I substituted half the flour for whole wheat, half the oil for applesauce.  Had to cook longer but have made 3 times already this summer.

This recipe was very good!  I make some changes after reading through the reviews.  I used 2.5 cups of rhubarb, an extra 1/2 c. of flour, added cinnamon to the batter, and doubled the vanilla.  To save some calories, I used egg substitute, skim milk, light butter, and half apple sauce and half oil.  It turned out great with all of these changes.  I have already made four loaves and plan to keep this recipe handy!

This stuff is terrific. I've made it as written, and also with 1/2 the oil subbed out with rhubarb mush (the leftover strained solids from making rhubarb syrup. I have WAY too much rhubarb to deal with!). This 2 loaf recipe yielded me 4 mini loaves (5ishx3ishx2ish) that were finished in about 27 minutes. I agree that the bread itself needs a little "something" for extra flavor. Applesauce, rhubarbsauce, nutmeg, cinnamon. Whatever you add,you really can't go wrong.

This is really good bread and a great way to use rhubarb.  I used 1.5 cups (2 stalks) of rhubarb and next time i will use about 1 cup more!  This is a great recipe that folks will enjoy.

I followed others' suggestions, substituting half applesauce for the oil and half wheat flour for all-purpose white. I used about 2.5 cups of rhubarb and 1/2 a cup of walnuts, which turned out to be just right.  I added extra vanilla and next time will add cinnamon to the batter.  I added flour to the streusel topping and used cold butter, cutting the mixture with a pastry cutter. It took exactly one hour to bake.  I took one loaf into the office and it was quickly devoured.  I will make this again.

I have to admit, I was not optimistic about this bread because I'm not a fan of rhubarb, but I wanted to find a good recipe that my father would like.  I was very happily surprised when this bread was done.  The smell was so heavenly that I had to taste it and YUMMM!!
I left the nuts out, but next time will try pecans or walnuts.  This is definitely going in my family recipe book!

This bread is excellent. Any rhubarb lover would like this. Easy to make; HOWEVER....I had to keep mine in for 70 mins. (I kept checking every 15 mins. after the suggested 40 mins.) Now that I know, it won't be so time consuming next time!

Yummy! I substituted half the oil for applesauce and 1/3 of sugar for sweetener and it still turned out great. I'm sure it would also work well with other kinds of tart fruit.

OH MY GOSH!!! This is excellent. I made muffins, a loaf of bread and a cake all using the same exact recipe. They all turned out delish!. Here's my description of the bread. Sweet and moist with chunks of tart rubarb. I made it for a family get together and everyone loved it. Rises more without the topping but if you like it sweeter, the topping is perfect.

We loved this! As the one reviewer said, it was more like a coffee cake or a banana bread. I will make this again. Maybe next time I will add a little more Rhubarb and coconut for the crunch. Thanks!

It was okay.  I reduced the oil by about 1/4 of a cup, upped the rhubarb to 2 cups, replaced rolled oats for nuts, and left out the butter in the topping and sprayed it with some cooking oil to moisten.  The part that tasted the best was when you got a bit of the topping w/a piece of rhubarb in a bite.  Otherwise the dough was rather bland and not sweet enough for me.  If I make this again I will try adding more vanilla and sugar and some cinnamon to the dough and put less sugar on top.  I chopped my rhubarb pretty small also and would probably up the amount to 2 1/2 cups.  Mine was not to oily and the bread was very moist.

Very good, very moist.  The suggestions from other reviewers were very helpful.  I used 1/4 c. oil, the rest applesauce, 2 c. rhubarb, 1/2 t. cinnamon in the batter, and added a little oats and flour to the topping.  The loaf was done in 45 minutes.  This one is a keeper.

YUMMY!  The best word to describe this.  I nibbled all night until it was practically gone.  It was the first time I've made anything with rhubarb.  How simple and delicious.  After reading previous reviews, I used part oil/part applesauce and it wasn't greasy at all.  Thanks for the great receipe!

DELICIOUS!!  I have never heard of rhubarb bread before...boy am I glad I found this recipe.  I thought the recipe called for a little too much oil so I think next time I'll try it with applesauce instead.  Also, make sure you cook it thoroughly.  I had to cook mine for 20 minutes longer than the recipe said!!!

Awesome flavor , Moist and easy to make. I added lemon zest to the mix just to kick it up a notch.

This is a lovely little quick bread. I used 2 cups of rhubarb, pecans instead of walnuts, and tossed in a chopped apple.  It is moist and flavorful and toasts up beautifully. I got rave reviews on this one.  As others have said - baking time is way off.  Mine took 55 minutes.

I only got to try a little of the bread on the ends because the baking time is WAY off. As soon as I took it out of the oven, both loaves sank in the middle. I should have known better, but didn't see anything in the reviews about increasing either the temp or the baking time, so I figured it'd be okay. It tasted good, and I'll make it again. Think I'll increase the temp to 350 and try for 40-45 minutes.

I would replace the oil with yogurt or applesauce. Also, it needs more rhubarb.

Delicious! I will definitely make this again.  However, as has already been mentioned by previous reviewers, the baking time is way off - mine took about 55 minutes.  I also used 8 x 4 pans rather than 9 x 5.

I just made this and it was very good! The only problem for me was that at 325 degrees, my loaves took almost 65 minutes to cook, and they are not over cooked at all.  Because of this, most of the large chunks of rhubarb cooked away so there are not a lot of bites of rhubarb left.  Maybe my oven is baking at too low a temp but I have not noticed this with anything else.  I just recommend to double the amount of rhubarb, and maybe bake it at 340, just to make sure it does not take an hour.  

Otherwise it is very good!  I also doubled the topping like others recommend.  I added a tsp. of cinnamon to the mix as well.

OMGosh!  So happy I found this recipe.  My hubby loves it and even though I'm not a rhubarb fan, I really liked it.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer but didn't mind because my kitchen smelled great and I swirled the topping.  Definitely will be making this again!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Loved it! I used whole wheat flour, applesauce for the oil, and subbed in 1/2C oats for flour. I also had a handful of chopped strawberries I put in for fun. Could have used less sugar with those in it. Will definitely make again!

Yuk!  What did I do wrong? ! My rhubarb bread is AWFUL! The rhubarb is still really tart, the cake/bread itself isn't anywhere near sweet enough and the whole thing barely rose at all - the finished loaf is only 1 inch high! I bake a lot and my cakes are usually successful but this is the worst cake I have ever made. What a waste of lovely fresh rhubarb!

I tried this recipe using a gluten free flax whole grain flour.  I didn't have milk so used soy milk instead.  It didn't raise very high but it is wonderful.  It doesn't taste like a lot of GF flour recipes.  I recently had 2 grandchildren diagnosed with celiac and so am trying to find recipes for them that they like.  This one is great.  The flour is Premium Gold Flax and Whole Grain All Purpose Flour.  I'll be trying many more recipes with it.

This is a "go to recipe" for me. I have made it many times, and my family loves it.  Our rhubarb plant goes crazy every year, so we make a lot of this.  I add oats to the topping, and add it half way through.

I wasn't all that fond of this bread, although I love rhubarb.  The bread didn't hold together well for some reason, and wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting.  I baked it as one large loaf, as I didn't have smaller loaf pans, so maybe that was why.

I made this recipe last night.  I followed the recipe except added 2 cups rubarb and added some oatmeal to the topping.  Fresh out of the oven it was good, but after sitting overnight it is great!! I took it to work and everyone likes it.

Very, very good! I followed the recipe as written. Only issue was the bake time was much too short. I used glass loaf pans and took about 70 minutes to bake through. I think it should be 350 degrees for 50-60 minutes. Will definitely make again, probably this weekend!

Recipe is delicious as written--5 stars.  I substituted fresh strawberry puree for half the oil and it was wonderful.  The next time I make this I will use strawberry puree for all the oil and reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup.

This is really good bread and was easy to make.  I followed the recipe with one exception; I didn't add any nuts.  It turned out great.  I lined the bottoms of my pans with parchment and the loaves came out easily.

My husband just left the house saying, " I almost died this morning because I ate some of that rhubarb bread for breakfast. SO GOOD!"  I always end up baking this for closer to an hour at 350F, but our oven is finicky.   I also add ground cloves to the crumble, as well as some whole cloves as a garnish, and does the house ever smell amazing!

We love this bread. I use slivered almonds instead of walnuts. The only problem that I have encountered is that I believe 325 is too low to bake it. I had to bake it for 40 minutes to get my tester to come out clean.

I also made the healthier version, doing half whole wheat flour and using applesauce instead of oil.  I did not do the topping but sprinkled extra cinnamon on top.  Turned out well.

I think this would be better if the topping were put in the middle of the loaf. The loaf itself lacks spice.  I went ahead and used buttermilk instead of the milk/lemon mixture. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and cut back on the sugar like other reviews suggested.  Did not like the addition of nuts to this bread. Don't know if I would make this again. Love rhubarb and the flavor just doesn't come through enough.

I made a few changes. Cut down sugar to 1 cup. Added an extra cup of rhubarb.  Used a bundt pan.  Cooked an extra 15 minutes because of the pan.  Did not use topping. Very very moist!

This was more like a rhubarb coffee cake.  My husband is a cook and he said that this was the best he has ever had.  I doubled the topping and it just went throughout the entire loaf giving it a coffee cake texture and taste......made it for myself.......we devoured it....made it for work....same thing.

Great!  I think next time I'd leave off the topping.  I personally think it takes away from the rhubarb taste.  I also replaced sugars with splenda.

It was a really really moist bread!  I think it would be great without the brown sugar topping.  I made it dairy free because of my daughter's allergies.  I subbed milk for soy milk and used shortening for the topping instead of butter.  It was really good.   It was my first time using rhubarb and I was thankful it turned out great!  I used 2 cups of rhubarb though instead of the 1.  I'm glad I did too because it seemed to be the right amount.

This is  one of the best rhubard bread I have ever had. I made a few changes, I used a total of 3 cups packed dark brown sugar, used apple sauce for the oil, added 1 additional egg, and used buttermilk instead of the milk and lemon juice. I also put a slice of cream cheese when putting the batter into the pan. Was a very nice change

Very nice bread with a nice flavor and is moist. Made a few changes only because I find it hard to follow a recipe without changing something...Added 1 cup chopped strawberrie just for another layer of flavor. Substituted: 1 cup whole wheat for white flour, 1/3 cup applesauce for 1/3 cup oil.  Before baking topped with 2 Tbs. finely chopped walnuts and 1 tsp. Turbinado sugar which made a simple, slightly crunchy, not overly sweet topping.  Tested for donenss with toothpick, as it took longer than 40 min
probably because of the strawberries.  Thanks very much for this recipe!

This is really good. I used 1 1/2 c. wheat flour & 1 c. reg. flour. I always
use dark brown sugar. I also substituted
1/3 applesauce & 1/3 c. oil. These loaves were not very high so I made it again using smaller loaf pans & they came out beautiful. I sprinkled brown sugar & cinnamon on the top(no butter) about halfway through the baking time. I baked them about 50 min. using the smaller pans.

This was delicious! Although, it took an hour to bake in my oven. I thought the brown sugar topping was going to be like a streusel, but it just sort of absorbed into the bread. Still very good though! I had chopped up 4 large rhubarb stalks. This was way too much, 2 would have been plenty.

My daughter ate the whole loaf by herself! Instead of mixing a streusel topping, I just sprinkle some brown sugar and cinnamon on top. It took an hour 15 min to bake though.

My husband says he dislikes rhubarb but he loved this bread!  Said it was the only way he's ever had rhubard that has been enjoyable!  I loved the brown sugar in this.  It was very easy to whip up, too.  I loved the cinnamon topping and it was very easy to make- don't skip it.  I used half applesauce for the oil.

This recipe turned out really well.  A couple of changes: I didn't use any oil, instead I replaced it with unsweetened applesauce.  Next time I'll reduce the amount a bit though, since it was a really wet batter and took longer to bake - more like an hour and a bit. Also, I did add cinnamon to the batter, but next time will only sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top and forget about the margarine/butter.  I might wait part way through the baking process before sprinkling it on, so it won't sink.  Also, I used pecans, and extra rhubarb.

This was very yummy. The only change I made was using 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg because I was out of cinnamon and it worked very well. I would definitely make this again. However, I needed about an hour for my loaves to finish and it was a touch crumbly-- still tasted great though, and that's the important thing.

I've made this recipe lots of times and my family loves this bread.  I always use frozen rhubarb (found it right next to the frozen blueberries at the grocery store!!)  which works out great for me since my dad loves rhubarb and asks for this bread all the time!  Some have mentioned that this bread does not have much of a rhubarb flavor...but I have not found this to be the case...could be the frozen rhubarb maybe?

This was a complete waste of two cups of rhubarb! There was NO rhubarb flavor! I didn't even use the topping~I could see where it would just sink in. Made my usual streusel topping. It gets one star for being a moist nut bread. However, that was NOT what I was looking for.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  I substituted applesauce for some of the oil and upped the rhubarb.  Also I made muffins instead of loaves, and baked at 350 for 30 min.  Texture and flavor were good, just too sweet for my taste, and I thought the topping wasn't necessary.

Previous review is right; loaf does not rise much.  Tried one without the topping, & was a bit better.  The topping does get mushy also.  Consistency of bread was a bit sloppy; not firm.

pretty tasty.  not sweet enough for my tastes but most of the family liked it.  maybe i didnt do something right but the loaves didnt rise much, just stayed flat.  the topping was delicious but turned to soft mush.  i prefer a crunchy topping i guess.

Great bread that is moist and tastey.  Like some other's I increased the amount of rhubarb(used about 2 cups).  I substituted pecans for the walnuts.  With an oven at 325 degrees the cooking time is closer to  hour.  Overall a very nice bread that is not overpowered by the rhubarb flavor. Thumps up on this one.

Very good quick bread!  I used applesauce in place of all the oil, a round quarter teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter, and 1 3/4 cup of rhubarb.  (My kids helped me mix it all up.  Easy, easy.)  I also added some flour to the brown sugar crumble to make it easier to sprinkle on the batter.  I added the crumble top after baking started...about 10 minutes in.  It did take an extra 20 minutes or so to bake.  Wonderful bread.  I will definitely make this again!

Just made this today!  Great!  I tweaked it a little and cut back on the oil, added some fresh lemon zest into the batter and added some dry oats and more cinnamon into the topping mix.  Also, baked for about 1 hour.  Just wonderful and am going over to my Mom's to get more rhubarb so that I can make this again.  Try it!

Good flavor, but way too moist for my taste.  If I make this recipe again I'll substitute plain yogurt or just use less oil.

I am a big fan of quick breads and this one is excellent!  I will be using a lot of my rhubarb making this recipe again and again.  I ommitted the nuts (don't like them) but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did not have a problem with the topping like other reviewers did...I think it is supposed to bake into the bread a little bit.

Very good. Husband, kids and coworkers all liked it! More of a cake, than an actual bread, but the name bread makes you feel less guilty eating it!

My topping just sank through to the bottom of the bread and stuck to the pan.  I'll make it without the topping next time.

Have tried other Rhubarb bread recipes and this is by far the one that is most moist. It is very very good and I halved the oil with applesauce ,to be better for my husband.

I didn't have enough brown sugar for batter, so I substituted 1/2 cup white sugar. I baked in 1 large loaf pan instead of 2 9x5 for 1 hour.  End result:  very moist, very delicious.

\Made this tonight and this is a keeper.  nice and moiset although it took a longer time for mine to cook.  I did add 2 cups of rhubarb so that may have kept it looser.  i also added a handful of oatmeal to the butter sugar topping.  the smell was heavenly.    going to freeze some to see how it is after thawing.   also wonder if freezing the fruit and then draining some of the liquid off would help

Very moist tasty bread.  Would maybe add 1/4 cup more rhubarb for more of a rhubarb flavor.  This is a keeper.

This bread is so yummy!   I barely had it out of the bread pan and my 12 year old daughter was begging for a piece.  Well, 3 pieces later she was finally content.  I made the recipe exactly as given.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I did end up baking it for about 50 minutes and then let it cool in the pan for another 10.  This is my new favorite rhubarb bread recipe!!

I needed to bake it for quite a bit longer than stated (maybe 15 minutes?), but it was delicious! Very moist! Be sure to store in the refrigerator because I'm sure it'd mold quickly!

Love to use all the rhubarb coming from the garden. First time trying this recipe and like that it makes 2 loaves so easily.  I will use some/all applesauce next time as many have suggested and add some/all the cinnamon to the batter also!  I agree with the review regarding the bake time though. Mine was in the oven at 325° for an hour and I still wasn't sure if the center was done.

Not bad, recipe is a keeper! I did not add nuts & I added WAY more rhubarb  because I actually like to taste it in my breads and it adds a little bit more moisture. I had a mix of small/lg pieces of rhubarb and used at least 6 cups of it. I used mini loaf pans and finally tried my muffin top pan that I've had for yrs. Muffin tops I filled about half way and baked for about 20min? I may try less next time..and add even more rhubarb to them to make them more moist than cake like. Mini loaf so far tasted great!! I didn't make the drizzle for the top...with all the loaves/muffins I would have needed to make more than the recipe called and said forget about it! Instead, to try it out, I just sprinkled some brown sugar on top the mixture before baking and tried to pat it down a tad.

Did not make any changes to the recipe. Bread was a bit moist (possibly slightly underbaked), but it didn't matter - it was gone within two days. Yummy.

Turned out very good though I think the temp shld be 350 rather than 325 as it took an extra 25 min to cook through! But the taste!!!!! OMG Fantastic!!!! I used pecans and almonds and added a tsp almond flavor as well and oatmeal to the topping....delicious is all I can say!

I had some leftover rhubarb from a pie I was making, so I whipped this up. I took one loaf to work to share and it was GONE!

The 5 star rating is for the flavor and delicious moistness of the bread.  I have made two batches now, and a couple things were problematic. 1) at 325 degrees I had to cook the loaves for an hour, and 2) getting the bread out of the pans didn't work well at all with just oiling. The second time I floured the pans as well and it worked much better.   Also, I allergic to walnuts, and it was super yummy with just rhubarb. The second time I added chocolate chips!

great recipe but tweaked it a bit. I did 1/2 oil and 1/ 2 apple sauce, added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of baking powder, doubled the topping and baked it for 55 minutes

Excellent way to use frozen rhubarb. I drained the thawed rhubarb and used about 2 1/2 cups instead of the 1 1/2 cups that the recipe calls for. I also used applesauce instead of vegetable oil and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. It turned out to be a great recipe!

I used 2 1/2 cups of fresh cherries instead of rhubarb. And i doubled the topping bc it was just delicious and I wanted more. Other than that, it was delicious and very moist. Great recipe.

Excellent recipe! My mom made this for years just without the nuts. I upped the rhubarb to 2 cups (based on a very similar recipe).  Also, be prepared for baking at least 50-60 minutes.  Didn't do the streusel topping and we didn't miss it.  Just as good and a wee bit healthier.

I replaced 1/2 c. Wheat flour for white, 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon in batter and 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon in topping, 3 cups of rhubarb, mixed in 2 Tbsp. of quick oats with topping ingredients and no walnuts. I baked them in 8x4 pans but next time will use 9x4 as that much rhubarb made them quite full!!  It is delicious and very moist.

I made 1/2 recipe, but with 1 egg. I ended up adding more rhubarb and cooked it longer and it turned out great.  I didn't add the topping, but it was very moist with the extra rhubarb, and tangy.  I am making it again!

Husband and discriminating grandson (considers himself a foodie) gave it a two-thumbs up!  I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I chopped the rhubarb into 1/4" pieces and patted dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.  Also increased rhubarb to 1-3/4 cup.  Additionally, sifted the dry ingredients together along  with a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Used half applesauce and half oil as others have suggested.  I made a streusel topping containing 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 2 tablespoons oatmeal, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and cut 2 tablespoons of softened butter which I sprinkled across top of loaves.  Baked in three 8" x 3" pans.

As other suggested, I swapped applesauce for oil and increased the rhubarb to 2 cups . I needed to cook 10 extra minutes for the slightly larger loaf.  I also invented a different topping with some nut-free Kind granola and coconut flakes. Everyone enjoyed - it's much better after chilling for a day. Not overly sweet and not overly tart either. Will make again.

Tried this recipe as the Sunday morning snacks at church needed to be replenished.  I used whole wheat flour and  2 cups of rhubarb as others suggested.   I forgot to put the topping on it before baking, uh oh!  The loaves tasted just fine without it, and who needs the extra sugar?  I had also used a scant measurement of the brown sugar in the loaves.  I baked one loaf in a 9x5 pan and other in an 8x4 pan at 350 degrees for 45 or so minutes and used parchment paper to line the pans, which I haven't done before.  That made the loaves so easy to get out of the pan.  The result was delicious, nice and moist, and everyone I saw trying it commented on how good it was.

My family loved this recipe!! I left out the nuts because that's their preference, but it was still de-luscious!! I  put it in mini loaf pans, it makes about 4 mini loaves. I had a hard time getting the loaves out of the pan though, any suggestion? I used Teflon pans with cooking spray and cooking spray with flour and still they stuck. It doesn't matter, my family still loves it, I've made it 3 times already!

I've made this 3 times now, as I'm trying to use up rhubarb and everyone seems to like this bread.  I've used up to 2 cups of rhubarb in the recipe with no issue.  I always bake 1 regular 9x5" loaf, and then a mini loaf pan (that is how much batter I have).  I've made without the sugary topping 2 times and it's just as tasty and saves a bit on calories.  I also sub out some of the oil & use applesauce instead (about 1/3 C).  In one loaf I added some pumpkin spice chips, though they seemed to dominate the flavor.  I really haven't found a reason to try a different recipe, as this one turns out well & is easy to adapt.

I have made this recipe often and it is my favorite rhubarb bread recipe. It is also great baked in a 9x13 cake pan, omit the crumb topping and serve with whip cream!  One reviewer said it sank in the middle,  it should not, I am guessing it need to bake longer.  Wonderful! I give this recipe 5 stars!!

Never cooked with rhubarb before, made this and subbed 1/2 whole wheat pastry and 1/2 applesauce as other reviewers suggested.  Next time will omit topping, don't think I needed it.  Really good, will make again.

A very good recipe! Made this yesterday and was very anxious to see how it turned out because I had to adjust the ingredients to fit my pan! Everybody loved it!! "You must make this again!!" was the comment that I remember the most! And I definitely will...maybe even try with another fruit as well!

This bread turned out really moist. I ended up baking it for closer to an hour.  I did add more Rhubarb as others had suggested. Yummy. Next time though I think I'll skip the 'topping'  and maybe exchange some of the brown sugar for white.

This was my first time making Rhubarb bread and it was tasty. I made a Gluten Free version and used Rhubarb from the local farmer's market. My alterations were: GlutenFree Flour for the regular flour, organic, natural (no sugar added) applesauce for the oil and I doubled the topping. We couldn't wait and ate 2 pieces hot from the oven. The bread is moist, sweet and tart. My 10 year old finds the rhubarb a bit tart so wanted more topping, but I think it's just the right balance.

My daughter made this. Moist and yummy! The nuts really add to the texture that might otherwise be rather light.

I make this a lot in the summer and freeze the loaves for later because I don't like the consistency or taste of frozen rhubarb. I have to bake my loaves for 55 minutes. I also fill my 2 cup pyrex measuring cup with chopped rhubarb so I am probably using about 2.5 cups.

Well is in oven right now I really do not know except the baking time is taking a long time. Been in oven 45 min and still doughy when I test it with a toothpick. Giving it more time but looks good and smells wonderful. I got 1 loaf pan and rest I put in 2 veggie tins,I make lots of bread like this. NICE for gift giving. I am sure it will be good. Love rhubarb. Thank you. :) came out of oven and it was VERY delish. :) will make again.

This bread was quick and easy and taste really good.  I made it just how it was shown but put it in a in one Bundt Cake pan.  Put some course sugar on top, but next time I make it, I will have ingredients to make a glaze to drizzle on it!  Yummy!

Tasty and simple.  Per some suggestions of other reviewers, I 1) reduced the oil to just over 1/2 a cup (but did not replace the difference with applesauce due to not having any on hand, but it was perfectly moist and not oily at all using just the amount I used), 2) used about 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb, 3) poured about 2/3 of the batter into a bread dish and used the remainder to make 6 muffins, 4) I omitted the crumb topping altogether to save a few calories and found that it was definitely sweet and tasty enough without it, and 5) mixed in 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon with the dry ingredients.  Would definitely make this again!

A 5 star recipe with a few modifications: use 2 cups of rhubarb instead of  1.5 cups, bake for closer to 55 minutes, and add some regular sugar to the topping mixture to give it a crunch and it will also make the bread prettier :)

Mine was finally done around the 70-minute mark. Also, the bread itself was flavorless if you didn't get any rhubarb or (sunken) topping in a bite. Adding some cinnamon to the batter would greatly improve this recipe.

It was yummy.  I added equal parts of orange juice, applesauce and oil.  I used part whole wheat flour.  I also added pecans, raspberries, orange zest and cinnamon to the batter.  I sprinkled the loaves with a little cinnamon and sugar after putting the topping on before baking.  My friend said her husband does not like rhubarb but he ate some and really liked it and traded me some fresh salmon for a loaf of it.  I have friends asking for the recipe saying it was very flavorful and moist.  Tweak it to your liking!!

If you really like rhubarb try substituting half the oil for a 1/2 cup of cooked rhubarb sauce sweetened with Stevia.  I also found whole flaxseeds a substitute to the high sugar topping that's in the recipe -  I cover the whole top with them before baking - adds a wonderful crunch!  Putting the cinnamon in the batter along with a combination of whole wheat pastry and all-purpose flour is the way to go too.  Moist and tart - yummy!

This is a great rhubarb bread recipe. I made this several times throughout the summer. I started adding a little bit of orange zest to a few recent attempts & that was also a wonderful addition.

I used whole wheat pastry flour in my half recipe. I used 1 tsp cinnamon and more in the topping. I had a half peach to chop up and add. Baked about 40 minute in a loaf pan.

Yum.  The brown sugar crystallizes into a wonderful sweetness that accompanies the tartness of the rhubarb.

Great bread!  I added 2 cups of rhubarb instead of 1.5 cups and 1 cup of toasted pecans instead of 1/2 cup.  Also added cinnamon to the batter as other reviewers wrote.  Coat the pans with baking spray and you won't have any stickage

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  The first loaf was gone before it cooled down.  I skipped the nuts because I didn't have any.  I also didn't have any eggs so I used 1 heaping tablespoon of corn starch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water instead.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to help with the rising.  It was great.  I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for part of the white sugar.

great quick bread.  I added some extra cinnamon-sugar on the top of the bread before I baked it. I also I find the bread stays fresher by storing it in the refrigerator. will make this again.

My first attempt it was really good warm but a bit undercooked. It got a little soggy the next day. Next try was a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes and much better results. I also had scant cups of rhubarb in case that had added to sogginess. Might double the topping next time.

What a yummy bread!  I had to increase the baking time by 20 minutes and turned the temperature up to 350.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Will definitely be making it again.

So good! love the chunks of Rhubarb tartness. Swapped some applesauce for oil and increased the cinnamon (in the loaf) as others said, and decreased sugar to 1 cup. Perfect for that fresh rhubarb.

Very good recipe! This was my first time making rhubarb bread and I had some crushed pineapple that need to be used up, so I added 1/2 cup of that to the batter. Had to cook it a little longer, but WOW...what a great taste!! I will definitely be making this one again!

I skip the nuts and the topping, guess I'm kind of a purist.  For an even MORE awesome treat, try toasting a couple slices.  Use the broiler, watch it closely and flip after it's nice and brown (the toaster gets way too messy). It carmelizes and is oh soooo irresistable!!!!!

I've never had rhubarb bread before...this was delicious!  Not too sweet like some breads, it was just right.  The topping added a nice touch.

Terrific!  I have made this several times for my family and my daycare kids.  Everyone gobbles it up.  I did substitute 1/2 applesauce for the oil and used some extra rhubarb.  To save time I omitted the topping and just sprinkled a bit of cinnamon in the mix.  No nuts due to personal preference.  Very nice - not too tart!

I wouldn't change a thing about it! ...and that's for eating rhubard for the 1st time as well! Actually, I did use 1 cup of whole wheat flour, but I often forget that is a change to note! I was a bit worried when the batter looked a bit runny, but all turned out very well.

This recipe is good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt the bread was a little bland.  If you didn't put the brown sugar/cinnamon/butter topping on the bread it wouldn't have much of a taste to it.  So next time I make these I will either double the brown sugar mixture that goes on the top, or I will add cinnamon to the bread batter as someone else suggested.  Also, I didn't have walnuts on hand (plus I don't like them), so I used pecans instead.  I will use this recipe again as I have lots of rhubarb this time of year and am alway's looking for new ways to use it.

I love how this bread turns out, but it always takes longer to bake than 40 minutes. I've made twice now and both times I've turned the oven up to 350 after 40 minutes and it still takes a good 15-20 after that. Maybe it's my oven?

Yummy!  I've just finished eating the first warm-from-the-oven loaflet, and it's delicious!  I made 8 loaflets and a regular-sized loaf.  Like other posters I subbed half applesauce for the oil, one cup of whole-wheat flour and added some spices to the batter.  I added oats to the streusel topping, and left out the nuts because I didn't have any.  I also used two cups of rhubarb (I was trying to get rid of my garden surplus--no luck, it was still only 3 stalks!).

Great to have another recipe to add to my rhubarb repertoire!  I'll add some chopped ginger next time.

This recipe is very good.  It tastes more like a dessert than a "bread".  Serve it with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for a great dessert!

I'm sorry, but this bread just had no flavor.  I used fat free sour cream and 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1 cup of all purpose as others had suggested.  It was very moist but just no flavor.  I left off the topping--didn't want the extra sugar, but maybe that's where all the flavor was.

This was wonderful!  I did omit the nuts, substitute half of the oil with applesauce, and use half whole wheat flour with great results.  I also gave it a little sprinkling of cinnamon in the batter.

Very good.  Was looking for other recipes for rhubarb other than a crisp & this was perfect.  Absolutely loved it.  Gave a small loaf to a friend at work (she had given me the rhubarb) & she really liked it also.

I followed the advice of some reviewers and used 2 3/4 cup flour, 1.5 t baking soda, added 1/2 t cinnamon to the batter and used 2.5 cups rhubarb.  I love rhubarb, and I think this turned out just OK.  It won't slice - the pieces of rhubarb make it sort of crumble.  I might use it as a base for a bread pudding, it needs a bit more flavor.

A bit too bland to suit my taste, but pretty good. Next time I'd add some extra cinnamon and probably omit the topping.

i made this using a bread machine instead of by hand.

Next time i will definately make it by hand as it did not rise very much and thetoppin wasn't crispy either.

never the less my mum seemed to enjoy it. it's lovely warm served with icecream. 

i should also keep it in the fridge if i were you because it was very moist and would have gone moldy in a few days if it was left out at room temperature.

i used 3 cups of chopped rhubarb but i will only use 2 next time. i added sunflower seeds instead of walnuts,i also subsyituted 1/2 the oil with yoghurt to make it more healthy.  i added wholewheat flour instead of white flour. i added flour and oats to the topping to make it more crunchy.

thanx 4 the recipe.

I followed the recipe with the exception of upping the rhubarb to 2 cups.  I found that this recipe made rather flat loaves.  I think the topping is too wet, it melted down into the batter and made craters in the top of the bread.  The next day, the top of the loaves were rather gooey.  The taste overall was good, but I think I'll keep looking for a recipe.

It was a bit greasy, but very moist.  Not much rhubarb flavor (my husband was surprised when I said there was rhubarb in it) so increase the amount of rhubarb.

I substituted soy milk and margarine for the dairy products listed here, and egg substitute for the egg. I've done the same in other recipes with no problem, so I imagine the issues with this were a result of the juiciness of the rhubarb or the increased topping. I increased the rhubarb to about 2.5 cups, and the nuts to about 1 cup. I also made about 4 times the topping called for in the recipe. I sprinkled one loaf with about 1/2c nuts after pouring into loaf pan, and then evenly divided the topping between the two loaves. The loaf with no nuts on top came out very weird-looking, but tastes pretty good (all for me!), and the one with nuts and topping looks quite good, but certain bits of the topping taste slightly burned. Some of the rhubarb bits lost their color in the oven, and most became very mushy--still tasty though. If you make the recipe the way it's called for (and have a decent oven, unlike me), you should turn out some excellent bread, although you may wish to use Leslie Sullivan's hint about how to prep the rhubarb. BTW, the cooking time, esp. for the loaf with additional nuts, was much longer--over an hour, I'd say. Also, this bread improved greatly in taste and texture when kept overnight.

This is very good, but just a bit too sweet.  Next time I'll add more rhubarb.  The temperature and baking time didn't work for me.  Other quick bread recipes I have call for 350 degrees for 60-70 minutes.  I'll go that route with future attempts.

This was the most delicious bread!  I don't like rhubarb, but everyone else does, so I thought I would try this. Oh, so good! I only tried it when it was still warm, so I don't know if it is as good cold. Oh heavens, I would definately make this again. I made it without the nuts and with canola oil. I wish I could have some right now. I haven't been able to find a good rhubarb crisp recipe, but I don't care any more because I can make this bread now. Make sure you have lots of brown sugar on hand! -- Ok the second time I made this, it wasn't as big of a hit. I used older rhubarb. The bread was still soft, but maybe I shouldn't have cut the rhubarb in such small chunks. I liked the topping, but nobody else did. Hmm..

This is the best rhubarb bread I've ever eaten.  My husband does not like rhubarb, but he loved this bread.  I will fix it often!  I left out the nuts and it was still delicious.

This is a great recipe. I followed it as written and did not find it greasy at all as other reviewers had indicated. Have a lot of rhubard to use up so I'll be baking additional loaves to freeze. Thanks for sharing with us Lori.

This was good.  It took longer to cook than 40, closer to 50, 55 minutes.  Very tasty though, a nice use for Rhubarb.  My preschoolers loved it.

I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT THINGS TO DO WITH RHUBARD BEING WE HAVE A VERY LARGE PATCH OF IT AND THIS BREAD IS JUST WONDERFUL. EVEN MY 10YR OLD JUST LOVES IT AND HE DOES NOT USUALLY EAT RHUBARD.

Delicious but very greasy. Next time I will follow other reviewers advice and reduce the oil,but wanted to see what the recipe was like as is. I think I could add another cup of rhubarb, too, especially if I didn't use as much oil.

I tried a number of rhubarb recipes from this site.  My husband and I liked this the best.  It is a great recipe!
