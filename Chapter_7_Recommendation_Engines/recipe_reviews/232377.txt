These brownies are amazing! I altered the recipe slightly with the following substitutions:

3tbsp vegan butter margarine -> 3tbsp virgin coconut oil,
1 cup sugar -> 1/2 cup evaporated cane juice,
3/4 cup cocoa powder -> 1/2 cup cacao powder + 1/4 cup cocoa powder,
1/2 cup agave nectar -> 1/2 cup rice malt syrup.

I think the original recipe calls for too much sugar, considering agave is sweeter than cane sugar I highly recommend reducing the sugar to 1/2-3/4 cup. 
I drizzled chocolate melted with coconut oil over the top and it went all crispy! You can't tell this recipe is gluten free and when I was looking for a brownie recipe I wanted to use the two flours (almond and brown rice) in the recipe so it worked out perfectly! So pleased.

I am new to gluten-free baking  I decided to jump into the game and this will be one of my "keeper" recipes. The consistency is perfect - just like most people are expecting from the traditional brownies. However, the cocoa flavor was a bit too strong for my husband's prefeeence; there is a slight bitter after taste. That can easily be remedied on the next batch. This was my first time substituting for eggs and I didn't have chia meal - but I knew from my reading that flax meal would work so that is what I used.  and it worked great!  Because my 8x8 pan was in use, I decided to make these into the mini-muffin tins and baked them at 350 for 15 minutes. I let them cool for just about 10 minutes then gently scooped them out with a soft plastic fork so as not to break them. (Hard to get out once they are totally cooked). Made about 3 dozen. The guys at work will devour them.

I took a prior users suggestion and used coconut oil instead and it turned out amazing. My wife is on severe diet restrictions because she is lactating and our son has some in tolerances, but these brownies actually passed as almost real brownies. I am highly impressed

The slightly bitter cocoa powder aftertaste threw me off. It was HARD to mix with my hand mixer. I'd recommend a good stand mixer. I substituted the recommended sugar for organic coconut sugar + the agave nectar. IMO, it's not too sweet.....it has the same sweetness as a boxed brownie mix. It's really grainy though. I would like to substitute the almond meal for almond flour. I had to add another TBSP water to get it to mix in the bowl. I think the original recipe needs to be tweaked to get the best result

It was very dark and grainy.  I will stick to using flax eggs with a more traditional type of recipe.

This was absolutely amazing, I used coconut sugar to give it a healthier twist.  My husband and my neighbors enjoyed these can't eat just one brownies.  This was the first time I used Chia Seeds, loved the texture and how they made everything gel together.  Making them again tonight!
