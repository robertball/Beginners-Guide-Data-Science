This recipie sounded good, so I tried it...I used dark brown sugar, and I didn't have parchment paper, so I used cooking spray.  I also used Milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because they are my fiance's favorite.  They turned out Great!!!! Totally easy.  I made one pan, and now I have to make another to give as gifts.  Allow for time for the choco. chips to solidify.  My fiance couldn't...they were half gone before I realized the chocolate WOULD solidify ;)  Thanks for the EASY, tasty recipie.  I will definately make these again...Tonight!

It's the holidays all the regular crescents were gone, had to use low-fat, I'm not sure if it made a difference but I didn't like the way it turned out.  I used the size pan specified but it was to big and the butter/sugar mixture ran off.  I will try once more using regular crescents and a smaller pan.

These were a hit at the party I took them to, many requests for the recipe. I thought a jelly roll pan was a bit big too and it took a while to roll the dough out that thin but really was a nice crispy crust. Work quick with the sugar mixture, it sets up fast. Great receipe, thanks for sharing.

I’m not really a big fan of nut cookies, but these are amazing! Plus, they’re very easy to make if you’re short on time. I made them before bed and then cut them into bars the next morning after they had cooled completely. They were a bit hit at my work’s Christmas party. The flakey crust, sweet brown sugar/nut layer and the bittersweet chocolate are a wonderful mixture of flavors and textures. I’ll be making these again very soon.
