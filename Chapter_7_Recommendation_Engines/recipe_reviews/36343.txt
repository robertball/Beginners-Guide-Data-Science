Let's put it this way I went back for more, (eating in another room) and they were all gone.

Awesome! The flavor is perfect. I would warn though, steamed ribs smell terrible! They don't really start to smell good until they start the second cooking (broiling).
I did not have Seasoned Salt, so I used Tony Chchere's Creole seasoning, with excellent results.

This was delicious.  I used guava paste and let them sit in the refrigerator all day. Very sweet but still spicy. I'll definitely be addint this to my recipe box.

I give the glaze a 5 but I want to try it on another cut of meat. It did not do it justice somehow.

Tried this one ribs yesterday and it's definately a keeper.  I'm looking for more recipes with guava or quince but unfortunately not coming up with much.  Thanks for this great recipe.
