This was an outstanding recipe! I tweaked it a little bit, and I would highly suggest adding these few items for extra flair:
--1 slice of pepper jack cheese (for kick)
--1 stalk of celery
--A couple toes of garlic
--1 gold potato, chopped
--Parm cheese (just a little bit)
--2 slices of crispy bacon chopped fine.
I served mine in a bread bowl with sharp cheddar cheese sprinkled on top, and it was absolutely fabulous! (See pic). This will definitely be one of my new staple recipes! Thanks!

This is a delicious, restaurant-quality soup that reminds me of the broccoli-cheddar from my favorite gourmet soup-and-panini shoppe.  It is an absolute MUST to use fresh garlic (I used four cloves, minced) and fresh broccoli to get the full flavor this hearty soup deserves.  Sharp or extra sharp cheddar is also necessary, don't use regular or mild, you'll get a bland soup more like a cream of broccoli.  I would absolutely make this again, it is a wonderful complement to a sandwich or burger.  The day I first made it, I had a bowl for lunch and then loved it so much I had it again for dinner!  Fairly quick and simple and it freezes well, too.

Lovely. Choose a flavorful cheese and grate it yourself. Prepackaged shredded cheeses have caking agents that prevent them from melting well. I usually choose an extra sharp and of course FRESH broccoli and FRESH garlic.

I decided to make this soup in hopes that it would be a great substitute for running to Panera all the time. It was very good. Very cheesy. Easy to make.

This was SO GOOD!  The whole family loved it.  Easy recipe to follow, great for my first time making broccoli cheese soup!  I was happy to find a recipe that called for "real" cheese, as opposed to "processed cheese food".  I used unsalted butter, low-salt broth, 1% milk, and fresh broccoli and garlic.  After reading some of the reviews, I was afraid of adding the flour/milk together for fear of grittiness.  Well I followed the recipe and it worked out so well.  It thickened the soup pretty much upon impact (lol).  Not gritty at all.  It was very creamy and smooth.  I think skim milk would work just as well.  I actually had to add a bit more milk to thin it out because the flour thickened it so well.  Served with fresh bread and it was so delicious.  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I will double the recipe so we can have more of it!

This was fantastic!  My husband and I love Panera's broccoli and cheddar soup and thought this tasted very similar.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen (boiled for about 7 minutes in the broth), mild cheddar cheese, added more garlic and used black pepper instead of white.

This is a great soup. Very very close to St. Louis Bread co./panera breads recipe.
I saw a recipe that was suppose to be their actual recipe, but took much time for a weeknight meal. This one was so simple and yummy!!
The only thing I did different was to add a grated carrot with the onions and use minced garlic.  I happened to have some leftover heavy cream so I added 1/2 cup along with the 1 cup 2% milk. This soup is still great the next day or two.

This is so delicious! I always make it with fresh cauliflower and extra-sharp Cheddar. Fresh broccoli works really well too - or a combination of the two - and if you like blue cheese, Stilton takes it to a whole new level. This soup never fails to please. Thanks!

AMAZING!!!  I've been looking for a cream of broccoli soup that I like and I've finally found it!  I would definitely recommend using fresh garlic -- I used 2 cloves and it was perfect!  I used medium cheddar and it was great!!  Definitely try this recipe!

This soup is THE best Broccoli Cheddar soup I've ever had.  I first made this about 2 1/2-3 years ago and I have been using it ever since.  I wanted a soup that would be similar to Panera's broccoli cheddar but this surpasses it by FAR.  My favorite part of this recipe is that it uses REAL cheese.  I always get a block of sharp cheese and grate it myself.  You can definitely taste the difference.  The first time I made this I was too nervous to change anything...but it doesn't need to be changed at all because it is absolutely DELICIOUS as written!!

Very good, and like the Panera version, it's quite thick. I used 1/2 medium onion, which was more than enough. I also added two small cubed and peeled potatoes. I boiled them alone for a few minutes in the broth etc. before adding the broccoli, which was fresh not frozen. I also added some hot sauce and quite a bit of salt towards to end. This recipe is delicious and doesn't need any more cheese, and I am a cheese lover.

Thanks for a great tasting super easy recipe.  It tastes pretty much exactly like panera bread broccoli and cheddar.  I pretty much followed the recipe, I did add some shredded carrot and thought the consistency was perfect.  Some people thinned it out, but if you like the thickness of panera bread broc-n-cheddar than I would not thin it.

Only a couple of things I'd do differently next time, I felt that it needed a little more cheese and I would use fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  It was delicious made just as is though!

Great taste, easy.  I doubled it because I knew it would be amazing!  Used green onions instead of regular onion.  Also used minced garlic I had in a jar in the fridge.  I agree with some of the other reviewers......use sharp cheddar.  Makes the taste so much richer.  Nice.  Thank you! ;)

OMG this is tasty tasty tasty! I added some smoked gouda along with the cheddar and it give it a nice smoky undertone. Mushrooms would be a good addition as well. You could probably add whatever type of cheese along with the cheddar that you wanted; provided it has a strong flavor. I'll also chop the onions up a bit finer next time, but I'm not a huge onion fan.

This was really nice on a cold night with crusty bread and green salad. We really liked it. I think it is a wonderful base recipe that could be used with additional veggies. I had never tried the method of mixing the flour into the milk before pouring into the pan. It worked just fine. I just whisked the flour and milk together a little at a time. Usually when I have made cream soups/sauces, I've started with butter and then flour and then milk. So that was interesting and didn't require much babysitting, which makes the soup very easy.

LOVED it! Made it when we had a guest over. Good thing it turned out so delicious! Only thing for next time is I'll prob use a medium cheddar instead of the sharp, but that's completely a personal preference. Thanks for posting this!!

I made this for Dinner, Absolutely delicious! Definitely use fresh garlic and broccoli for a better soup, but if you're in a hurry the frozen broccoli and garlic powder works just fine! Great recipe!

This was very very good! I made it for my DH's grandmother's 92nd birthday and everyone loved it. My only worry was the mixing the flour in with the milk, which it came out pretty smooth, but with just a tad grittiness to it. Maybe next time I'll try doing it with cornstarch but other then that it was great!! Thanks!

Nice and easy. Easily made vegetarian by substituting vegetable broth for chicken broth. I used four cloves of fresh garlic in place of the power and used an extra four ounces of white cheddar. Will make this again, definatly.

i LOVED this recipe. i did alter it a bit though, i used broccoli florets and pureed half the soup to leave some chunks. also i used real garlic and half monterey jack cheese/ half cheddar.i needed a few more servings but didnt have enough ingredients so i secretly added a can of cream of broccoli soup with a can of milk . because of this addition i did add a little extra cheese. no one could tell i added the can it and was perfect. just as good as panera's but with the love of homemade. thanks!

This was awesome. I used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 (I was worried that skim milk would be too watery) and it was the creamiest, smoothest broccoli cheddar soup I think I've ever had. My boyfriend made me swear that I would start making this regularly.

so it says ready in 40 minutes.  try 20 minutes.  this is soooo easy.  i did have to use boullion(yikes, i know) but added 6 cubes to 4 cups of water. (4 cups in a quart, right?) it still turned out wonderfully.  i'll be taking this to my babysitter who's father just passed away, to ease their burden a little.  I'll let you know what they think too!!

Fantastic!  My husband and I are Panera addicts - so we were a bit skeptical, but this is the real deal!  I would recommend using the brand name chicken broth rather than the generic, that seems to make it a little bit better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Don't try unless you really like garlic.  I thought this had way too much garlic powder.  It tasted okay, but no one could come close to finishing a small cup.  The flour also had a "raw" flavor.   Easy to make, though.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! I made a view changes on the second round and I will never use another Broccoli Chedder Soup recipe.  I reduced the onion to 1/2 of an onion, used fresh garlic, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, 1/4 t. of nutmeg and WAHLAH.. FABULOSO!!! My neighbor actually asked me to make some for her birthday party dinner.. what a gift!!.   YUM, YUM, YUM.

Excellent! Tasted great, was just the right consistency. The only thing I did differently was that I used some half and  half I had on hand instead of whole or 2%. Will definately make this again.

This is a very nice, smooth & creamy soup.  I subbed fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder, used fresh broccoli, 1% milk, sharp cheddar, & added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper toward the end.  Thanks for the recipe, Pam!

Excellent!  It went so fast I'm not sure if they even tasted it.  I only made a single recipe and my Mom said, "I thought you would have made some for me to take home."  Needless to say that was last week and tonight I am making a double batch.  Hopefully it will last at least a day!

This soup was delicious and very easy to make! My husband isn't usually a fan of broccoli-cheddar soup, but even he liked it. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used reduced-fat butter and it was still very rich & creamy. The sharp cheddar really adds a nice flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Excellent soup.  I just devoured it.  I don't know what I was thinking to put in garlic powder, I always use fresh garlic, but I just didn't think about it and I followed the recipe, and I do think it would have been MUCH more flavorful with fresh.  I will be making this again.

Despite my goofs, this soup was still good.  How did I forget the flour?  I don't know, but I did.  Then, I suspect because the temperature was too hot, and maybe because I used an "off" brand of cheese, the cheese clumped and did not melt properly.  I would probably have rated this soup a "4" as I prepared it--so I didn't feel right penalizing the recipe for my goofs.

Delicious soup! I added potatoes to mine, because that is just what i'm used to, but this recipe is very good and spot on with texture and the amount of cheese you need. You can add more broccoli too. I like a "loaded" soup with tons of broccoli and potatoes so that's just what I did and there were no complaints in my house!

Very good soup. I only had bagged shredded sharp cheddar and it was still good, but I want to try using my own white cheddar next time. I added the hot sauce (not very much) at the end and it gave the soup a nice kick and tang. In my double batch I used two big bags of Trader Joe's frozen broccoli. The pieces were huge and so I pureed one bag in the food processor before adding, then added the second bag whole. Next time I would maybe use a different frozen broccoli - the pieces were kind of large. Pureed broccoli made it nice though.

This was SO easy to make! I only used like a quarter of an onion just because I hate cutting onions and I used more garlic powder than it called for.  Also towards the end of cooking, I stirred in some Tabasco sauce.  I thought it was REALLY good except that cheese you use matters because I used cheap cheese and I could taste it... I bet it would be amazing with better cheese.

I just finished making this...  I wished I would have read through the reviews first.  I used a bag of shredded cheese..  I am left with little pieces of cheese that won't melt.  Soup still has great flavor, the cheese peices just give you something extra to chew on I guess.  Next Time I will shred my own cheese.

I eat Panera's broccoli and cheddar soup a few times a month and this does not match that soup, BUT, it is good.  Adding dijon and hot sauce gets the recipe closer to Panera's, but not all the way there.  I used 10 oz of cheese instead of the recommended 8 oz and the soup ended up with a flavor that was too cheesy.  Stick with the 8 oz that is recommended.  I ended up serving my soup as a fondue with sourdough bread and apples and carrots because it was so cheesy.  I used extra sharp and agree with earlier recommendation to go with either sharp or a mix of sharp and extra sharp.  One note - if serving in crock pot, which I did, after an hour or two the soup starting losing its smooth consistency.  So I recommend serving soon after making it.  I will try this recipe again and will add dijon/hot sauce again but this time I will follow the 8 oz sharp cheese recommendation and maybe then it will come closer to Panera.

I stuck to the main copycat version of Panera's broccoli and cheese soup.  Used 1/2 onion, no garlic powder, used cracked black pepper, used 1/2 pound fresh broccoli, 2 cups broth, 1/4 cup flour, 2 cups fat free half and half.  Butter and cheese stayed the same.  Before adding cheese I also pureed half broccoli in blender.  My whole family agrees this way is 5 stars!

Awesome soup!   I ended up making a roux with the flour and milk (melt 1.5 tbsp butter, add 2 tbsp flour, slowly add milk) and added the cheese to the milk.  Yummy!

So far the best homemade Broccoli soup I've made.  Very easy and totally cheesy!   I halved the recipe for 3 servings since I'm the only one in our family that eats soup. Used two cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  2.5 cups of chicken broth(homemade) and a little over 1 cup milk to flour(1/4 cup)  I also just shredded a bunch of cheese but didn't weigh/measure it out. Turned out really great and I'm for sure making this again as its a great way to use up leftover steamed broccoli

Great recipe.  I sauteed fresh garlic before the onions, used fresh broccoli florets, and pureed after the milk and flour was added to thicken.

I took the advice of others and used fresh broccoli and garlic. I also shredded my own sharp cheese. The only thing I did different, I used skim milk. The soup still had a rich, creamy texture and the taste was AMAZING!!!!

We went to Saint Louis, MO for Christmas 2007 and absolutely fell in love with the Broccoli Cheddar soup at Saint Louis Bread Co. (Panera Bread). I got back home (to Australia) and have been craving the soup ever since i left. I found this recipe online yesterday and made it tonight and OMG it is delicious, my partner loved it too (phew)!!! This brought back mouth watering memories :) Thank you so much, this will definately be a family favourite!

I JUST finished making this and it's absolutely delicious! I just gave my family a taste and they love it as well. I used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and fresh broccoli instead of the prepackaged one. Thanks for this recipe! I'll be making it again and again.

As I usually do I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I used fresh broccoli and will use fresh garlic next time. This was very quick and simple and ideal to make for my daughter when she got home from work tired and hungry. She's requested it again soon. Many Thanks.

Fantastic.....I only used 2 tblspns. of butter instead of 4, used about 4c. fresh broccoli floretts, added another 2c. of water and 2 boullion packets in addition to the quart of fat free/low sodium chix broth, used fat free 1/2 and 1/2, and reduced fat cheddar. Just the best soup, my family loved it! I did leave the flour at 1/2c. and the soup thickened beautifully, will keep in fall/winter soup rotation.

I didnt care for this at all. The flour should be added in the begining and cooked like a roux. The uncooked flour tasted awfull and gave it a gritty texture. And I used sharp chedder and it didnt have great flavor so I added some velveeta and it was better.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I've tried many variations on broccoli cheese soup and this has been the biggest hit with my family.  Both my boys (ages 4 & 5) asked for second helpings!  I did make some changes; couldn't find chicken broth in my cupboards, so substituted 1 can cream of celery & 1 can cream of mushroom, then added water to make 1 qt.  Next time I'll try as written, just to see how it compares.  I like mine thick, so I used full measure of flour and loved it!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  Just what I've been looking for!

Excellent recipe. Simple, delicious, and cheap. I've made it regularly for several years. Served with some bread the soup can easily be a filling dinner on its own. The only change I typically make is using minced fresh garlic (2 or 3 cloves) instead of powder.

This is GREAT! Happy to be able to use my white pepper that I bought at Penzey's. I thought that it might be too garlicky with that much garlic powder, but NO! I used a 16oz bag of frozen florets which I rinsed in hot water & then cut the stalks off as I don't really like them. I shook the flour with some of the half & half that I was using up (in a jar) but I don't advise that.......I had lumps that I had to deal with! So do whisk it. Doesn't need extra salt IMO. Thanks Pam!

I have made this soup several times, and it always turns out wonderful! I use a bag of fresh broccoli, and steam it in the bag in the microwave for 3-4 minutes before adding it to the soup.

I always prefer fresh vegetabl.I took a chance and made it for my elderly parents while visiting and they each ate 2 helpings!  I will be visiting them again soon and they want me to make it again.

Delicious soup! I used homemade broth and cut the pepper in half, glad I did as it was peppery enough! I also mashed the broccoli a bit in the soup as I prefered it  a little pureed. Will become a regular recipe in my house.S o easy!

I just made this soup with a few variations for my newly lactose intolerant son.  I used lactose free milk and smart beat lactose free fat free cheddar cheese.  I also used fresh garlic and broccoli since that is what I had on hand.  It turned out amazing!  I'm so happy that an old favorite of my sons can be enjoyed again!

Really good recipe.  Added the fresh garlic as suggested by other reviewers. Didn't have sharp cheddar on hand, so I added mild cheddar PLUS abou 1/8 cup of cream cheese. That helped sharpen the flavour of the soup.

I made this for my grandfather who is 81 and fell down the stairs. he was in really bad shape and said the my soup was the best soup hes ever eaten and that I was a genius (LOL!) it was SO good, I ended up making a second batch for myself and brought it to work for everyone in the office to taste. EVERYONE loved it. There are a bunch of vegans/vegetarians in my office, so instead of using chicken broth the second batch I used vegetable broth, and it was exactly the same taste. I also used fresh broccoli instead of frozen broccoli for both batches, and that was the only change I made the first go around (and that's not a very big one!) this soup is great as is, I didn't even need to add extra cheese or anything. Will DEFINITELY make this again, maybe even put it on the menu at my diner!

Amazing! I made a few very small changed for dietary need. We loved it, my whole family loved it even the picky 5 year old. We fought over leftovers, although we ate so much we only had about one serving of leftovers to begin with. My family has asked that I make it AT LEAST once a month.

The changes I made were: I am a vegetarian so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, I only used half an onion because my husband isn't a fan of onions, and I skipped garlic powder because I was out. It came out delicious, and the changes I made aren't huge taste changers so I'm sure it would have been delicious either way.

Wonderful! I was looking for a quick, simple recipe I could make while at work (at an ambulance hall), that did not require a blender or food processor. I came along this and thought it sounded too good to be true. I used fresh garlic rather than the powder (only b/c I didnt have the powder) and followed everything else to a T! Turned out fantastic and plan on making this for my hubby when I return home! Fantastic, very simple recipe!

So incredibly easy to make! My family loved this soup, including my picky 6 year old. We tried freezing the leftovers, but that was a mistake. It came out hard like a quiche once it was thawed and reheated.

I loved this recipe, made it several times. A little different each time. I like to add potatoes and ham, it's great! And also some crumbled crispy bacon and parm cheese. Of course since your adding more ingredients you need to add a little more liquid, about 2 cups more chicken stock, 1 cup more milk and almost 1/2 cup flour. Overall really simple, tasty and great the next day! lots of leftovers

Just fantastic. A yummy, cheesy soup. I'd suggest chopping the frozen broccoli into smaller pieces. Very good.

Delicious and easy to make.  I recommend using white cheddar cheese.  The orange stuff gave it an unappeitizing color.

absolutely wonderful recipe!  i made a few of the suggested modifications (added the regular amount of cheese... but also added 4oz shredded mild cheddar and 1/2 a package of cream cheese. Added 1 shredded carrot and 2 very finely chopped red potatoes....)  SO wonderful and SO filling! This is definitely a new favorite!

I've been making this soup on a semi-regular basis (at least once a month) for two years now, and I still adore it. I get requests for it when people come over for dinner. It's one of the best soups I've made, and it's versatile in the sense that you can adjust the cheesiness to your personal preferences (we're cheese fanatics here, so it gets quite a bit of it).

Just like Panera! I load it up with exorbitant amounts of broccoli because I like chunky soups. I've made it using both chicken broth and beef broth and my husband and I actually prefer the beef broth base because it makes the soup taste richer. It does color the soup a bit darker though.

This turned out great! I have note made many soups, but wanted to learn this one for sure. It was very easy and VERY filling. I did change just couple things. I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and i omitted the onion as i hate them. :) I also used 1% milk (because that is all I had) instead of whole. I added chopped bacon to it as one reviewer said, and it was fine, but i probably won't do that again. I served this with a french baguette and a baked potato (for my husband) and I was full after the first bowl! It also makes wonderful leftovers - I am enjoying mine now as i type! Absolutely will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

We really enjoyed this recipe! I used a potato masher to mash the broccoli up right before I served the soup since we like it more fine, but other then that kept everything the same. Even our 2 year old gobbled it up!

Made this soup tonight.  It was VERY quick and easy and was quite yummy.  I carmelized the onions for added flavor, used 1/4 c. cornstarch instead of flour and a mexican four-cheese blend instead of the sharp cheddar.  I like my soup salty so of course added lots of kosher salt.  Pretty good soup for how quick and easy it was.  Also, used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and mashed it slightly with a potato masher once it was tender.

This is my new Broccoli Cheese Soup Recipe. My husband is a big fan of this kind of soup and he loved it.  I did make some changes though because I did not have all the right ingredients. I used mozza instead of cheddar and I used 4 cups of water with 2 bouillon cubes instead of the chicken stock. I also cut the garlic powder down to 1 tsp. instead of 2... this was just perfect for us... I think the garlic taste would be overpowering with 2... and I only put half and onion in... since my hubby isn't such a big fan of onion. So yeah... just goes to show you can make do with what you have and things can still turn out great. :) Thanks for the delicious recipe!

The only thing I did different was to use fresh broccoli. But the soup had a weird texture. It should have been smooth but it felt like it had grains in it. I think it was the shredded cheese that just didn't melt right. Will look for a different recipe.

this soup is GREAT! I used two crowns of fresh broccoli which resulted in the need of pureeing 1/2 the soup down. super good!

Excellent & easy.  The perfect soup for a crisp, fall day!  I just finished making a batch and am very pleased with the finished product.  I used extra sharp cheddar (and since I had a little monterey jack left over in the fridge, I added it as well), and chopped one large carrot for color.  My husband claims it tastes every bit as good as the Panera soup.

Love it!  Only thing that's tricky is getting the right sharpness of cheese.  Sharp seemed not quite sharp enough in the end, and Extra sharp was way too sharp.  Maybe next time I'll use half and half.

I thought there was way too much garlic in this recipe.  It was good, but not exactly like Panera's. I probably will make it again, but use quality garlic and only 1 tsp.  I also added a small amount of Velveta to make it more cheesy.

My friends and I make dinner for each other every week, and on my turn I was really wanting to make a broccoli cheddar soup, so I found this recipe and tried it. It was fantastic, my friends Grandmother would not believe that I made myself! Awsome for a first time soup maker! I will make this a major household recipe

VERY GOOD! I am making it for the second time tonight, except making double! Best with fresh garlic and broccoli (and not quite as much pepper), and even better day 2!!! A must try for broccoli cheddar fans!

Excellent. I used an 8 oz container of all natural sharp cheddar cheese spread that melted very well. I also added some garic salt at the end. Perfection!

I made this for the second time last night; this time I made it with extra sharp cheddar. It was just what it needed to make it cheesy enough for me. Enjoyed it with BLTs and a tall glass of iced tea. Yum.

This was really easy to make and very good.  I used fresh garlic and added carrots and potatoes.  I do think it kind of tasted like cream of broccoli, but I used mild cheddar instead of sharp.

I would describe this as more like a cream of broccoli soup than cheese and broccoli.  Perhaps I should have used a more strongly favored cheese, but my family thought it was a little bland.  Great texture though.

Great recipe!!! Just made this and I have to say it is wonderful and so simple. I did a few things different. I added black pepper instead of white,    I used 3/4 of an onion, I added one clove of fresh minced garlic when sauteeing the onions (I ususally used garlic powder but I actually had fresh this time) and I used 16 oz (1 lb)velvetta instead of chedder cheese. The velvetta makes it very cheesy and very rich. So good!!!

This by far is one of the best homemade broccoli and cheddar soup I have ever tasted.  I have tried many but this one was exceptional.  I cut the flour down to 1/3 cup and it was the perfect consistency for me.  If you like it really thick, leave it the way it is.  Thanks Pam, it was truly delicious.

I can't believe I hated cooked broccoli with cheese on as a kid. I made it mostly for the BF and it was so very good. We followed the recipe but used half the onion and instead of salt to taste I used garlic salt just 'cause we like garlic. Next time i'll add the broccoli closer to the end because I use fresh and like it a little crisper. ALSO I used vegi stock. And sometimes use mushroom stock and add mushrooms right before the broth to make it mushroom broccoli cheddar soup, the color is a little wierd but very good.

This is really good and easy!!A++++++++++ I did like others and added some carrot I ran through the food processor. I had to add a lot more milk to thin it out. But so what? You make it to your liking! I added chicken soup base you buy in a jar, for the broth. It's a teaspoon, to each cup of water. I doubled this recipe and it made a big batch to heat & eat for a few days! It really is tasty, n just add more salt or boullian, and garlic powder, if you like. Thank you Pam!

This was rather easy to make.  I substituted real onion for about 1/4 c. minced onion, and it was still rather tastey.  I also added about 3/4 can extra broth to thin it a little as it was extremely thick.  Very good tast though and easy to make.
