I have recently tried pumpkin cornbread and loved it! I thought I would give this a try because I have several family members who eat gluten-free.  This did not work at all for me.  It had so little cornmeal in the recipe, that you couldn't taste it and I would not think of it as cornbread.  It also was very "gummy" and crumbly.  It was difficult to cut a piece without it completely crumbling and falling apart.   The flavor was very sweet - almost like a pumpkin cake.  Unfortunately, I won't make this again.
