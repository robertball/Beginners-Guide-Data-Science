Excellent cookie!!!!!   I was impatient, and didn't let my butter get to room temp, so I used a little less flour so the dough wasn't too dry.  I also subbed half the coconut for chopped almonds!  Thanks for the great recipe Donna!

I wanted an easy cookie recipe using coconut that I could take to a cookie exchange. This was a hit. I was worried when I was making them because I used a small scoop to ensure even sized cookies and the dough didn't seem to stick together very well because it was so tender. I didn't bother to roll them into balls, just scooped them onto the parchment paper, flattened with the bottom of the glass and baked. They came out of the oven a bit delicate ( ok, I didn't wait til they cooled before I tried to cool them on the racks). The next morning they were sturdy and worked well for the exchange. My husband is a big coconut fan so I may add 1/2 tsp coconut extract next time, but they were delicious as is. Perfect with tea.

I made it exactly as written and they are very tasty, they smell fantastic when cooking. I will probably add a splash of cream next time to help with the cookie dough being a tad dry to work with but the consistency did not harm the flavour in any way.

Made these for Valentine's day using a cookie heart mold and homemade icing, these cookies were perfect.

Thought I would give these a try.  Used coconut oil instead of shortening.  Delicious!

These were real good. The dough was a little on the crumbly dry side i think I will add a splash of cream like another review suggested.

If you"re a fan of almond cookies these are wonderful. I put 5-6 almond slices on top of each cookie prior to baking just because I like the added look and texture. However, the cookies are great without them as well. 
You really do need to allow the cookies to cool a few minutes before removing them from the cookie sheet because they are very fragile when hot.

Great new recipe to add to my holiday baking!  I didn't flatten the cookies, but rather left them in balls (they flattened slightly in the oven).  I did bake my closer to 14-15 minutes until they had a hint of golden brown on the edges. And, instead of a drizzle of chocolate on top, I put a Mound (get it?  LOL) One cup of melted chips made way too much for just a drizzle - not a problem!

These are good and they are easy to make. I made them even easier by adding 1 cup of mini chocolate chips in with the batter instead of drizzling it over the top and that worked out great. I gave 4 stars because the next time I make the recipe I will alter it to my preference. The almond flavoring was very strong, my kids and husband thought these smelled and tasted like Christmas cookies. I will use half the almond extract next time and make up for it with actual almonds. I think it needed that crunch of the real nuts in there too.

I thought these were pretty delicious. I didn't have shortening so I replaced it with butter. Even though I had chocolate chips, didn't add it to the cookies. Still yummy without it.

Turned out great!  Dough was a little crumbly, so I had to "squeeze" it into a balls to get it to stay together (flattened them to about 1/2 inch thick).  They held together fine while cooking though.  It took 13 minutes to get them to have any golden brown on the edges.  Next time I think I'll:
-  Add 1/2 tsp. coconut extract  (for a little extra flavor)
-  Replace shortening with coconut oil
-  Replace half of the coconut with chopped almonds

These cookies are amazing! This was the first time I have ever tried this recipe. We put a half cup of sliced almonds and my family loved them! I recommend this recipe to you and your family.

Delicious and easy.  When I heated the chocolate as instructed; the chocolate in the center of the bowl burned.  I melted the chocolate my old way.  Place all chips in bowl and microwave on high for 1 minute and then stir until smooth.

Killer Cookies. The coconut, almond and chocolate mixture are to die for! They were super easy to make yet they make you look like a baking professional.  Well Done!
