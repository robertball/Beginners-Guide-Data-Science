I really enjoyed the the chocolate flavour of this pie, it wasn't heavy but the flavour wasn't diluted as you might expect. Do keep it in the fridge, it will not hold up for long periods of at room temperature.

This was my favorite pie on our Thanksgiving table. It was very light, delicious, and easy to make a few hours or a few days ahead. The only thing I did differently was that I made an Oreo crust and sprinkled some crumbs on top. Sadly this is a pic of my last piece...until Christmas!
