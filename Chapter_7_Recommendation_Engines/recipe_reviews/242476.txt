Noah approved! My 3-year old nephew and I had a blast making these today. He made these into shapes using large odd-shaped cookie cutters. I just dumped a 1/4 cup of rice mixture into the cutter and let him press the rice mixture with his little fingers. I used gluten free bread crumbs. I left out the soy due to not having access to the ready rice mentioned, I used Uncle Ben's Mediterranean Express Rice. They baked in 10 minutes perfectly. At first, while you are mixing them, they seem like they won't stick together - they do, be patient. Mix with your hands and press it into the cookie cutter. Both adults and kids will enjoy these. Thank you Mis7up for your fun recipe.

This was quick and easy. I used calrose rice and substituted crumpled saltines for the panko.  I ate it with sweet chilli sauce and it was delicious.

Great recipe - quick and easy, and makes a wonderful presentation. We used a cherry blossom shaped cookie cutter. I was also afraid it wouldn't stick together, but it did! Wonderfully! Topped each rice cake with some sautéed shrimp in an Asian sauce. Thanks, Uncle Ben's Rice!

These were quite good. I made the recipe as stated and I too thought they would never hold together once I lifted the ring. They baked up just fine and held together beautifully. As prepared, we thought on their own they were a little bland but when dipped in a bit more soy or ponzu, they were fine. Maybe just a touch of salt or perhaps some chopped green onion to give them pizzazz. My husband also used them as a base (see picture) for holding other parts of his meal. All around- tasted like fried rice and something we'll make again!

This tasty and inventive dish reminded me of a favorite fried rice, only with a classier and more appealing presentation.  I served it with sweet and sour sauce, along with a stir fry as our main dish.  I had concerns it would fall apart on me, but it held together beautifully, and it’s so easy too.
