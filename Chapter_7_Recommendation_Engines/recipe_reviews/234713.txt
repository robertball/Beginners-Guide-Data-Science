I've fried green beans before but these have them beat hands down! I have always had trouble "double dipping" and I struggled getting the 2nd coat to stick to the beans here too but enough did and the seasoned crumbs made all the difference in the world in terms of flavor. The green beans were fresh from my garden which is always a bonus. One tip I learned is to ditch the two bowls for the flour and breadcrumb and use gallon size ziplock bags instead. Not only is it less messy but the beans coat so much better and clean up is a breeze. Drop them in, zip, shake, and you are done.

Super delicious. To make it easier and make the fried layer stay on better, we premixed the bread crumbs, eggs, and flour and added a little water. They came out perfect

I made these gluten free. I used white rice flour and gluten free bread crumbs and did my own seasonings. Absolutely delicious! thank you so much for the  recipe

Made this for Christmas 2018, with only one (ill advised) change.  I substituted Panko bread crumbs for the regular crumbs called for in the recipe, but wouldn't advise it. The  Panko crumbs are too coarse for the delicate texture of the green beans. Also, be cognizent that these beans fry up super quickly, so don't walk away from them. Thank you for a great recipe!

I like this ennovation! It's a delicious food  even my picky kiddo  didn't even resisted. I like the whole idea of making it so appealing to kids. You can also try cooking any pasta dish made with  bentilia pasta it's a pasta made out of beans. My family is loving everything about it. As a parent the healthy factors are all that matters in preparing foods that's also yummy of course.

These are excellent. As soon as I pulled them out of the grease I tossed them with sea salt and ranch dressing powder. Great!

Really good with an addition of flavoring.  I added garlic, and pepper to the flour, and the panko.  Also it needed an extra egg, but I knew that the minute I cracked it, must have been a small egg mixed into the large eggs or something.  I will make it again as the whole family enjoyed them.  Nice change to the green beans and for "fries".

these turned out perfect. I had no problem with the breading coming off.  They looked just like the picture and were delicious!

These turned out very well, I seasoned my (panko) breadcrumbs with msg salt paprika and oregano. Other than that I left the recipe the same. I needed more egg than the recipe called for, but otherwise I liked this recipe a lot. I had never blanched green beans before, but I think it did them a lot of good in this case

There wasn't much coating left on them.  They were still  pretty good.

My family loves fried green beans. We used to get them at the LoneStar steakhouse, but the only one in our area closed.  I used "greasy cut-short" beans, but next time I'm going to use regular pole beans. We love flavor so I added garlic and onion powder, smoked paprika and cayenne pepper powder.  I have done the double dipped method before, but had issues with the egg. I  used my immersion blender to scramble the eggs and added just a dash of milk  and to my surprise I didn't have any issues. I used the zipper bags as recommended in another comment and I'm glad I did.  The taste is wonderful!

Delicious yet simple! Added another egg per other reviewersâ€™ suggestions. Used large bags to ease prep and everything was coated nicely.
