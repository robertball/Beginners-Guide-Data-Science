i thought this was excellent-i used store bought frozen pizza dough and thawed it according to package directions.I also just spiced up the dough w/basil,oregano and italian seasoning-and omitted the provolone cheese-and baked at 450-not 500 degreesfor about the same time-will definately make again!

These were good but would be better w/ marinara sauce in them. Next time I would not mix the ricotta w/ the other cheeses, rather spread it beside the filling.

The crust is great on these, but the filling was a little bland.  Will make it again but with spinach instead of the broccoli, and more garlic.

Very pretty.  But too much dough.  Or, not enough filling.  Will make again, but halve the dough.  Making the dough in the breadmaker was new to me, but I liked it a lot.  Plus, it was a whole lot easier than mixing by hand, which is what I usually do with pizza. Would definitely recommend putting marinara on the side.

Yum! My first try at making calzones and these came out great. My only modification was using cheddar cheese instead of provolone, and adding some ham that I shredded in the food processor and they still came out great. Everyone loved them and ate their entire calzone.

yummy!  I subbed basil for the oregano (I was out), added a tbsp of spag. sauce to each one, and used a slice of provolone in each instead of grated.  Enjoyed by the whole family, and looking forward to the leftovers for lunch!  I'm gonna try the dough for pizza crust next time I make it.  Also, I used plain flour & hand mixed the dough - let it rise for an hour before rolling out.  Worked great.

I substituted spinach for the broccoli because my family loves spinach, and these were incredible. I absolutely LOVE this dough, and use it for homemade pizzas, too. Absolutely delicious!!!

Mama mia where do I begin! Labor intensive and bland. A pinch more salt, oregano and garlic to the overall recipe. Use less dough for the fold over. Think balance between the filling and the amount of crust you want. I would do this one again but do it with a meat filling instead. Very disappointing.

Yummy!!!  I also used frozen bread dough...and had alfredo sauce on the side for dipping!  Like others, the cook time was off and they were ready in 10.

This was a quick delicious recipe...  I made the dough in advance, used some for pizza, froze the rest and then thawed it for this recipe... it really cut down on prep time.  It was easy to alter the recipe by adding my favorite fresh veggies and meat or meat subsitute.  Highly recomended!

This is great!  Served it during a football game instead of pizza.  Made it easier by thawing a loaf of frozen bread dough. Seems the pepperoni was left out of the recipe, but I used it and the flavors together were awesome. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box and experiment with different variations of ingredients.

These were very good, but the baking time is a little off. I had put them in a preheated oven and set my timer for 20 minutes and it was too much, next time I will bake them only for 10/15 minutes.

Excellent, though a little labor intensive. Not for a real beginner. I've also used this dough with "traditional" pizza toppings and sauce and it is very good. It doesn't freeze well though.

not enouth filling ingredients for the amount of dough - and you bake them at 500 degrees for 30 minutes???? no way.   The dough and filling are good - just needs some adjustment on size and baking temp.

I substituted fresh broccoli (put it in raw so it did not get mushy when cooked), and added dried oregano, crushed red pepper and freshly grated garlic and omitted the provolone.  Used refrigerated pizza dough and added homemade pizza sauce inside the calzone.  Yummy.

I made the crust by the recipe in my bread machine and it was too dry. I added more water. I didn't have mozzarella, so I used Romano. I also added chicken and cooked with the cheese and broccoli. I cooked at 500 and for 20 mins. The dough was so hard that we just broke open and ate that. I may try again with pre-made dough.

Good.  I overbaked them a bit so the crust was heavy, but the inside was still good.  Needed a little marinara sauce on the side for dipping, though.
