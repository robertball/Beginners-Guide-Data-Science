I never know what to make with the delicata squashes in my CSA box and this was a great and simple way to prepare it. Delicata is not my favorite squash in general, but glad it didn't have to go to waste, and now I know what to do with it!

Easy and delicious, followed recipe exactly. A nice change from some of the other seasonal squash.
