I have made a similar recipe using Creas of Chicken soup for years.  I always thought mine was so good it couldn't be improved on.  My husband has informed me differently.  Last night was the first time he ever passed up second on the meat so he could have more potatoes.  I guess I will have to change my recipe now.

I only made half a recipe so instead of throwing away two half cans of soup I used only one can of Cream of Potato soup.  I also really liked the hint of dill in the backgroup.  I added a little extra cheese because I like my potatoes extra cheesey.  I thought they had great flavor and so did my husband obviously.  I will make again for sure.

It tasted like potato and celery soup straight from the can with an 1/8 of a teaspoon of dill-That you can't even taste anyway.

Great sidedish recipe!! Although I made as is, I think you could easily add some red/green chopped bell peppers and maybe even some fresh mushrooms.  This could even be made into a maindish if you added some chopped ham or chicken.  I'm not sure if the milk is neccessary but it was still very good and we all agree that it should be made again! Thanks Maureen for sharing!

The only thing I changed was mixing the cheese in with the potatoes before baking; otherwise, I didn't change a thing and it was delicious--we had it with chicken last night; we're having the leftovers (because it made a LOT!) with with steak tonight.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Maureen!

For anyone new to this recipe, add the cheese with the rest of the ingredients, put your mixture into a  greased baking dish, then sprinkle the top with extra grated cheddar, as well as a nice sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese.   Bake as directed and be sure to check your potatoes at the one hour mark. Not all ovens bake the same so a quick check at one hour could save you from burnt potatoes.  Once your potatoes are baked,  you will have a wonderful tasty side dish to please your family!

These potatoes are absolutly delcious! without a doubt this recipe is a keeper. However, next time I will try cooking covered with foil for 30 minutes then remove foil and cook until browned. (my guess about another 30 minutes) A+ recipe!!

This recipe is quite delicious if made properly.  I have a similar recipe tht only calls for 1-2 cans of condensed cream of 'something' soup.  Depends on the amount of hashbrowns you use.  My favorite is cream of mushroom.  I don't add too much milk or dried dill, however I do add a pinch of cayenne pepper, and some seasoning salt instead of regular salt.  I also mix in a cup of grated sharp or old cheddar cheese into the hashbrown mix, as well as a generous amount of  cheese on the top.  I have yet to come across any of my guests to complain about this dish.  Usually I am asked for the recipe.    By the way, thanks Maureenburr for sharing your mum's recipe.  That makes it even more special

This is my new favorite side dish! Only changes I made were to use green onion instead of yellow, and throw in a little garlic powder (which I do to almost everything), and I halved the recipe, so only used 1 can of cream of celery soup and no cream of potato. Great recipe, thank you!

This is pretty good. I think that chicken instead of potato soup would have given it more flavor. I omitted the dill. I think also that sauteeing the onions might have been more to our liking. Using Healthy Request soups and low fat sour cream helps  with the unbelievable fat content listed. Thanks.

These were not a big hit with my potato loving family.  I think there's just too much other "stuff" beside the potatoes -- it's a little bland (which could easily be corrected with some additional spices) -- if I try again, I will use less soup and sour cream --

In the south we call this Hashbrown Potato Casserole. Been making this holiday staple for years! I use cream of mushroom soup (just 1 can) and no dill. I mix everything together including the chesse, melt 1 stick of butter or margarine, put 1/2 in the casserole and use the other half to "grease" the baking dish. YUM! My 2 grown children request this everytime we get together!

I liked the recipe, and will use it again, but it needs more flavor.  I'll play with it next time. More cheese or salt, maybe?

This was to die for.  Anyone who gave this a bad review (vitalismom) did something wrong.  And besides that, such a negative review, shows much immaturity on "their" part.  Try this recipe and if you feel you need to ad anything else, do it.  I will certainly be preparing this again.  My entire family cleaned out the dsh.  Thanks to Maureen for sharing!

I have made this recipe for over 25 years. It alwaz a favorite at potlucks or when we have people over for dinner. Definitely the cream of chicken soup puts this dish over the top! (Use instead of the cream of celery.) Boiled grated red potatoes if you have the time, instead of hash browns and chopped green onions instead of the regular onion.  No dill weed in mine, although I like dill weed. This dish is great with just about any meat. It is also great reheted with eggs in the morning! I crumble up almond or honey nut flakes for the topping.

I have made a very similar casserole for many years.  I use a small package of Velveeta instead of shreded cheese, which makes it very creamy.  I also heat the potatoes in the microwave for about 15-20 minutes, so they are about half-cooked before adding the other ingredients.  Otherwise, the casserole tends to cook around the edges before the center is done.

I have made a version of this for years, but I use a can of cream of mushroom & cream of chicken to give it some flavor. I also add a stick of melted butter. I then fry up some breadcrumbs with butter and put them on top of the cheese (and i mix some cheese in with the potatoes). The breadcrumbs give it some texture and added flavor. There are times when I've had leftover chicken or leftover bacon, and i chop it up and add it too. This is a very good recipe to change it up in many ways

Because this is what we had on hand, we used defrosted O'Brien-style potatoes, green onions instead of regular onions, half as much cream cheese, 1 can only of cr. mushroom soup, 1/2 cheese mixed into the potatoes, 1/2 cheese as topper. No Dill. No Milk. Cooked covered 35 min, then 15 min uncovered, then 5 min w/cheese on top to lightly brown. Tastes like a loaded baked potato. My family loved it along side a beef main dish.

Followed this recipe but not sure what happened.  Bought everything fresh but it had a sour taste and the top was crispy and inside too mushy.  I've eaten this made by someone else and it was good so I'll try another version

Excellent recipe.  Has a lot of good flavor.  I added diced leftover ham and french fried onions to make it a complete meal.  Would also be good with broccoli added in (but my kids prefer the broccoli on the side).  Great versatile meal.

These were very good.  I didn't have company coming that night - so I prepared the whole batch, but split it into two 8x8 pans.  I baked one off and froze the other one to have later.  (I can't wait to have the second pan!)

Didn't match up with what I was looking for, although it sounded yummy. The taste was "off" from what I expected. Not sure if I was supposed to use the shredded hash browns or the cubed hash browns. I used cubed. Sort of a bland taste. The cheese that I put on top formed a crusted layer that almost couldn't be punctured and it didn't melt into the potatoes as I would have liked. Everyone's got a different "taste bud" and this seems to satisfy a lot of members - but I'll be using a different recipe in the future. Thanks for the ideas!

I made this dish for the first time yesterday (for Sunday dinner) as per the recipe. I baked it in two 9X13 pans. All of our guests loved it!  I highly recommend that you try it!!!  I'll make it again next month...

I thought it was me.  There is just too much sour cream in this recipe.  But I made it for the family (all 23 of them), most mentioned it tasting way too much like sour cream.  It needs to be worked on, less sour cream and more of a few other things. But I don't intend to re-write a good base recipe and add the things we might like.

FANTASTIC! Everyone went for 2nd or 3rds. Two changes that I did were...instead of cream of potato I used cream of chicken and I used two bags of potatoes. The dill just adds enough to make people wonder what the secret ingredient is. Turned out great and it's a keeper.

These were great cheesy potatoes. I did not have enough sour cream, so I used a little extra milk and 1/3 of a package of cream cheese. I mixed all the cheese into the potatoes rather than put it on the top. I also added 1/4 teas. of the dry dill, and it really made a great outcome. They had kind of a sour cream and onion chip flavor, but so creamy.

This recipe is great! I usually mix the ingredients ahead of time then stick it in the oven about 1 hour before dinner time. Everyone who has tried it has raved about it! I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a potato casserole.

I loved this recipe.....throw it together and bake...what could be easier.  I subsituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of potato and used light sour cream and cheese.  Still was creamy and delicious.  It's also great warmed the next day!

This wasn't the greatest potato dish I've ever had.  I think there was too much sour cream involved.  I could taste that more than anything else.  I may or may not make again.

Meh. Less than average, not terrible but not great. If I was to make it again, I would not use cream of potato soup-- it causes weird lumps of potatoes within the hashbrowns. I'd go with cream of mushroom. I would also mix a cup of cheese within the potatoes.

A Nice change from mashed potatoes.  Made a few changes. Made half a recipie which made plenty with left overs.  Used cream of onion soup (which campbells makes and I had never heard of ) Omitted dill, used a little red pepper instead, and mixed the cheese into recipie- baked uncovered 1 hour- turned out perfect.

Excellent and super-easy!  I use 1 can cr of chicken in place of the potato soup; white OR gr onion works well depending on your taste; try sprinkling a little parmesan on top along with extra dill & paprika.  Use at least 1/2 sharp cheddar for a little extra bite. Use lo-fat s. cream and healthy req. or lo-fat soups to ease the conscience; and stir in about 3/4 of the cheese, with the rest sprinkled on top.  Excellent cheesy potatoes!

I made this for my very picky family for one of the many Christmas celebrations/dinners this season.  My family LOVED it.  The next night leftovers were still delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe suggested except that I did not add the cheese until the last half hour of cooking like a previous reviewer suggested.  I will definitely make this again.

These were great!!! As always, I made a few changes, but nothing major. I only had cream of celery soup, so I used 2 cans of it instead of cream of potato. I cut the salt in half, and may even cut it more next time. I used 2 cups of cheese, mixing in half with the potatoes, and putting the other half on top. I did skip the dill, because I was afraid it would not be kid friendly. I think I would have liked it though. I liked that this recipe used milk instead of butter. The other similar recipes often call for a stick of butter. I like that this recipe cuts the fat significantly. I used skim milk and the recipe was well-liked at our Fourth of July gathering. Thanks for sharing

Sooo easy and sooo good!  These are always a  hit. I stir half of the cheese into the potato mixture and put the other half on the top along with some crushed cornflakes. Also, using sharp cheddar gives more flavor.

The first time I  made this I took it to work for a "potato bar" potluck lunch.  Everyone LOVED it! I used 2 cups shredded cheese and reduced the sour cream to 3/4 of the 16 oz. container.  Will definately make this again!

This recipe is just not for us.  I am sure adding garlic would help, also less sour cream but will keep trying other potato/cheese dishes.

Good, not super spectacular. The dill was largely undiscernable. I may add more dill if I prepare this again. It is quick and easy. One common sense recommendation I will make is to mix all of the ingredients together before adding the potatoes. That will allow the wet ingredients to mix properly, so globs of soup don't form.

Another keeper! I had to substitute cream of mushroom for the cream of celery, but I'd imagine it would be just as tasty either way.  Texture was great.  I added diced ham that I had leftover in the freezer and it had a nice flavor.  No issues here - thanks for a great recipe!

For all the trouble, it wasn't anything special.  It wasn't bad, it just didn't wow us.  One tip I would like to add:  it didn't say so in the recipe, but I treated the hash browns just like I would thawed spinach.  I made sure I squeezed a lot of the water out, because I was afraid it would be too "soupy" if I didn't.

These were really good. Couldn't find cream of potato soup in the market so I used 2 cans of cream of celery instead. The only change I will make next time will be to mix most of the cheese in with the potatoes before baking, then sprinkle the rest of the cheese just before they are done.

I loved this recipe!  It's very similar to "funeral potatoes" wich is overdone in my area, but it's so much better!  The dill is a nice twist.  I used chicken and mushroom soups instead of the celery and potato and added 2 T celery salt.  I also used half cheddar and half jack cheese and cooked it in a crock pot (adding the cheese at the end).  Despite the calories (and fat content YIKES!) I will definately make these again.  Thanks!

Very good.... a lot less greasy than the paty potatoes that are made with the crushed corn flakes on top.  A big hit and easy for a party!

Wow.  This is soooo easy and sooo good.   I made this dish twice now and have been asked for the recipe.   (My friends are amazed at how easy it is!!)  It's a great idea to add a nice touch to a formal dinner or a treat to a weekday meal!

I have made this for yrs. This specific recipe is lacking.    I make a little different - cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, no dill weed and 3x more cheese, and parsley & chives.  In a crock pot for 3 - 6 hrs.  Easy and loved by many!!

I added crushed corn flakes and doubled the cheddar cheese. Took the large pyrex dish to a funeral reception and that dish was empty in 10 minutes and people were begging me for the recipe. But I did no taste it. Need to make more.

I have made this many times, sometimes I make it with chopped bacon or browned hamburger.  So versatile, there is absolutely no end to variations!  One thing I always do though is I sautee my onions up in butter first.  It really makes a difference!

Holy cow, these are good!  After reading the comments, I used sharp cheddar cheese and mixed it in with the the other ingredients, increased the dill from 1/8 tsp to 1/2 tsp dill (actually Pampered Chef All Purpose Dill Mix), and sprinkled more sharp cheddar over the top.  Mine took 75 minutes to cook.  This is so good that it is going to be my go-to recipe for holiday side dishes and pot-lucks.  I can only imagine the joy of adding diced ham to this.

Love these.  I added a layer of crunch  by crushing about a cup of corn flakes mixed with melted butter and layering them on top for the last 30 minutes of cook time.  I also used the hash browns that have peppers and onions mixed in, and added some chives and cream cheese.  I also used cream of celery instead of potato

I made this dish tonight to go along with steak and it was delicious. The only thing I did differently from the directions was used onions flakes instead of onions and added garlic powder. I also mixed everything together and put in baking dish. I baked covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 45 minutes. Turned out great.

I made this for the first time today to take to a pot luck.  Oh my goodness, are these potatoes delicious!  I got many compliments and was asked for the recipe.  Per some other reviewers' suggestions, I did mix half of the cheese into the potato mixture, and I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of potato soup just because it was a personal preference.  Obviously these aren't something a sensible person would eat on a regular basis, but as an occasional side dish they can't be beat!

This is a delicious recipe that can be easily customize to make it simple...or really special. Always a hit for our family's Sunday Brunch. I add a pound of bacon, which I cut in small pieces before I fry (makes it easier).  Drain the bacon on paper towels, remove all but a teaspoon or so of the bacon grease and then fry the onion (I use 1 med onion, chopped) in the grease until browned.  Add bacon and onion and the cheese (save some for the top, or add more, but the cheese should be mixed in with the other ingredients, not just put on top). Bake for an hour.  Perfect!

I don't eat meat so this is my favorite recipe for company potatoes. Everyone always loves them when I make them. Kids love them too!

When I made this I used o'brien hashbrowns and took out one of the sour creams and added a can of cream of mushroom.  My family loves these and if you have to make them for a large crowd very easy. Just made them for around 170 last weekend... I also srpinkle Doritos on the top for a twist "Yummy"!!!Thanks for the share:)

These went over pretty well.  I had these at a picnic the day before, so I wanted to try them.  I think the other recipe was different and didn't use the soup because it was a bit drier.  I didn't use the sour cream because my husband hates sour cream.  Also, I like my potatoes cheesy, so I used the suggestion of others and added cheese right into the potatoes and also used a jar of cheez whiz, which I melted in the microwave first and then just stirred it right in.  I think next time, I might just use one can of soup so that it's more balanced for my tastes though.

The first time I tried this recipe it was for a banquet for 40 people. It got RAVE reviews. I thought it was quite delicious as well. My husband ALSO thought it was delicious. I would recommend this recipe to ANYone looking for a change for the regular potato. It's simple and easy to cook. You don't even have to peel or cut potatoes!

This is my favorite recipe to make when I go to family or social gatherings.  The only thing I do different is use about 10 cut up fresh potatoes instead of frozen. This makes it so much better.  I also leave out the dill weed and paprika.  I'm usually the one eating the left overs, which I don't really mind at all.

I made this over the weekend for a pot luck party.  Nobody could get a second helping because it was gone after the first round!!  Not the healthiest ingredients.....but this will be one for when we splurge a little.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good base recipe, although some of the spicier palates around here needed more flavor. But this is a good pot luck dish for the office or family get-together.

This is so easy and feeds a lot of people. I omitted the dill and have added bacon bits or cubed ham as well as using green onions or scallions instead of white or yellow onions. Very good recipe.

I made this and took it to a party.  Maybe I am just my own worst critic, but I wasn't all that impressed by it.  Everyone else, though, said they loved it, and I even had someone ask for the recipe.  I think other reviewers are right-- there may be just a bit too much sour cream in it, and it tends to kind of weaken the other flavors.  Will use more onion, less sour cream, and maybe some other spices next time.  Actually, stirring in some more shredded cheese to make it cheesier might be good, too.

This seemed like it had way too much sour cream.  I would cut the sour cream in half and add a little more cheese.  Maybe a little garlic salt would give it more flavor too. It did not go over very well with my guests. :(

Yummy! Next time I will put the cheese on top the last 15 or 20 minutes of baking. The cheese was a bit too done but otherwise this is great. It is also very simple :)

I was disapointed, this didn't turn out as good as I thought it would.  The whole thing tasted kindof bland.  I was expecting something more like a hashbrown casserole.
