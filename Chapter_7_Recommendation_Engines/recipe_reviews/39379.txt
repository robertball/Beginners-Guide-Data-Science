easy to make but mine didn't taste like anything. also, took twice the amount of time to fully cook.  i like the idea of it but it needs something more.

the recipe is pretty good. "Large baking dish" is rather vague. I used a 9x13x3 inch dish and the veggies would barely fit. I used half the veggies and added cheese when served. It tastes awesome.

This was really tasty, just hot enough. Maybe would have been even hotter the next day, but there was just nothing left!
