This recipe had delicious flavor! I found them to be slightly runny depite adding more oats to the recipe. A few small tweaks - I added a teaspoon of espresso powder and a quick shake of ground cinnamon. I was happy to eat this recipe out of the bowl! If you are able to wait unlike me, then make sure you give them the full 30+ minutes to set up before enjoying.

If you use regular, rather than quick-cooking oats, you will not get the proper consistency for the cookies to be dry and not runny.

Worked great with old fashioned oats, I just let the mixture sit in the pot for about 10-15 minutes before I scooped them onto the foil.

I agree with Guru -- all of these require QUICK oats ... the regular ones have to be cooked too long to absorb properly - with QUICK oats success every time

Loved these! Used the quick cooking oats and let the mixture stay at a ROLLING boil for a full min and they set up just great! Wonderful flavor!

*UPDATE*
Made this yesterday (above) using Justin's peanut butter and they came out beautifully. Tonight I made them using regular Jiff extra crunchy peanut butter because my husband likes some crunch in the cookie and they came out verrrry runny so I added probably a 1/4c of quick oats to the done mixture and that thickened it up nicely. 

I think the kind of peanut butter you use makes a huge difference!

A little sweet for me.   Also, using wax paper requires no cooking spray and yields better results.

I was looking for a recipe I had made for years. I made this version using quick cooking oats. Was very runny. I added another cup of oats and it was fine.

I have been searching for the recipe that would take me back to when my mom used to make these. This one is spot on. I used quick oats and crunchy peanut butter. They are awesome.

I only used this recipe as a base and altered many things, mainly for personal preference.  First, I melted unsalted butter and Jiff brand Salted Caramel Hazelnut butter (this is not as thick as peanut butter) in the microwave.  I omitted the sugar and cocoa powder.  I then mixed in the vanilla and oats.  They did take a little longer to set, but I found them to be delicious and did not want to share, but I did :)  I found them to be plenty sweet enough.

5+  Stars for these delicious, fudgy treats!!  I have been making this exact recipe for many years.  When I was little my gram used to make these for us all the time.   We love them and they are a family favorite for sure.  These taste like fudge, only better!  Sometimes I add walnuts and they are to die for!!  Make sure you cook them long enough and mix well to incorporate the oats with the liquid.

Exactly what I was craving and not too sweet. Didn't set completely solid but that's ok it's only been 1 hr since I finished them, perhaps they'll set a little bit more.
