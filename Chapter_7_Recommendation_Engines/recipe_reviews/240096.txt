Very good simple and quick. It is a perfect healthy side dish any time but you could definitely play with the spices in the fall. My 2-yr-old wouldn't touch it but I think she will if she sees it enough. It's def in the rotation!

Really good. My cooking time was much longer than that suggested but I had guessed it would be that way so was prepared for it. It was so nice to find a sweet potato recipe that didn't ask for any sugar. Even my picky 4 year old enjoyed it.

Super quick and easy recipe! I followed it as written though in the future I will probably just bake it entirely.

Apples and sweet potatos are so good together. I sliced the apples to make pretty rings. Instead of microwaving i baked mine. It took about 45 minutes but oh so worth it.

Great and easy. This will be repeated. I followed the ingredients but didn t measure. Hardest part of the dish was peeling and cutting the sweet potatoes. Since they cook slower than the apples I may nuke them alone for a few to make chopping easier
