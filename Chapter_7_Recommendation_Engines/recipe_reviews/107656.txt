Nice variation on the turkey wraps theme! I couldn't find tomato basil tortillas so I used regular ones but I used a flavoured kind of cream cheese. I made half the roll-ups with sun-dried tomatoes and the other half without and we prefered without. Will certainly make again for it is a very healthy and flavourful lunch!
