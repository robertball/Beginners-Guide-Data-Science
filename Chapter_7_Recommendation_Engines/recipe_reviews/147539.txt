1st off... YOU MUST USE A GOOD NON STICK PAN FOR THIS! I made the mistake like others and used a reg pan the first time I tried this and I burnt half of it and the other half was mushy... I did make some changes... My 4 potatos were HUGE so it was more like a double batch. I left the skins on and cut the potatoes in half and than cut thicker slices rather than cutting into chunks. I doubled everything and used 6 tbs butter and 6 tbs extra virgin olive oil, just to be healthier. I used 5 large cloves and instead of the chives at the end I diced half a sweet onion and cooked that along w/ the garlic. Doubled the salt and pepper. The first time I made this I used the paprika but this time I was all out and it was still good. I started the cooking directions exactly as written but once done I continued to cook it to get it alittle crisper... I cooked it on med heat and every 5 to 10 mins I would turn/flip the potatoes. It took about 45 mins total and the potatoes were a nice gold brown w/ lots of crispy bits in it. And don't worry about breaking the potatos.. those broken pieces are the pieces that get nice and crispy... That's the best part! This was a HUGE hit and I've made this 3 times in the past 2 weeks! Thanks for the recipe!

Great home fries!  I partially cooked my potatoes first and used seasoned salt vs. regular salt.  I added come chopped onion and the addition of fresh chives was great. I did use a non-stick pan - not sure if that makes a difference.

Maybe I did something wrong.  These were not at all crispy, the bottom of the pan burned.  I followed directions exactly and I'm usually a good cook.  I sliced the potatoes as the recipe said but see in the picture they are more chunks than slices, maybe that was my problem. Is there a secret I'm missing.  Used a stainless pan, not nonstick, maybe that was the problem???  They weren't terrible, we ate them but nothing great.  Would love to try them again as other reviewers described, crispy outside, etc.

I made these tonight to go alongside some kabobs and they were really, really good!  I followed the recipe exactly with a few minor exceptions.  I cut the recipe in half because there were only three of us eating; I used 3 cloves of garlic; I used half butter and half EVOO and I used seasoning salt instead of regular.  The end result was really delicious and I will definitely make these again!

These were delicious...I added extra garlic and I chopped up a vidalia onion as well that I cooked up with the potatoes, they added a little sweetness. The chives added at the end were yummy!!

Fantastic! I swapped out the butter for some EVOO and baked them instead. I also added  3 extra cloves of garlic and 2 tbs. of Essance of Emeril. My kids gobbled them up.

These were delicious.  I added extra garlic, sliced onions, and powdered chicken boullion for more flavor and they came out really good. This method yields flavorful, browned potatoes - the best recipe I have found for home fries!

Very good, and not at all difficult. I will make them with more garlic next time, as the garlic flavour was pretty tiny. If I could rate them 4 1/2, I would. Thanks for a great recipe,Steve.

Super easy and super delicious.  I used three cloves of garlic for half the recipe (3 cloves for 2 potatoes), and it came out garlicky enough for me!  A great addition to brunch.

These were really good, but they didn't crisp up as I had expected.  Served with Chicken sandwiches with caramelized onions and chutney from AR.  Thank you BachelorSteve.

This is how I always make my fried potatoes.  And I don't use a non-stick pan.  I use a well-seasoned cast iron skillet.

I tripled all the spices, and my russets were done before the "mix in chives" step so I didn't need the final 10 minutes. It's all to do with how big your pieces are, and how well your pan conducts heat. I used cast iron, and got beautifully browned potatoes all around. Do feel free to add a sliced onion right from the beginning, it'll caramelize and blacken a bit with your potatoes and be crispy and wonderful. Thanks, Steve!

These had pretty good flavor.  I made some changes to the heat though.  I basically followed the recipe except at the end, I did not cook them on high heat for 10 minutes.  If I would have done that, they would have been completely scorched.  So, I cooked them on medium low for 10 minutes instead.  I really enjoyed the favor though.  I will use this recipe again.

I also used a chicken bullion cube, and I think it mada difference. My friends raved over this and I will be making it again this evening for my BF.  This time I will leave the skin on as I am hoping for some more crispiness. Thanks Steve!

I followed the recipe as written with one exception ~  used a bit of minced onion I had on-hand, instead of chives (because I forgot to buy some). I cooked it in a large cast iron skillet, and it turned out PERFECT!!! Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Very good, and easy !!!!

I've made these a few times, but made a couple changes each time.  The first time I made them, the only thing different was to use more garlic and cut the potatoes into small cubes so they cook faster.  Came out great, but I actually prefer to use olive oil (and maybe just a pat of butter), double the garlic and also add some dried thyme.  Very simple but tasty!

Excellent! Only substitution was chopped red onion for the chives, since I didn't have any.  Also doubled the garlic.  Cut the potatoes pretty small so they'd actually cook in about 30 minutes.  Going to try 1/2 EVOO and 1/2 butter next time.

I'm sure with quite a few changes (like a non-stick pan!), this would have been fine. But as is, it tastes average, the potatoes end up mushy, and your pan will take forever to clean.

I used a heavy duty non-stick pan and these turned out perfectly.  I did add a lot more garlic, salt, and pepper.  Very good!

This is a great recipe and just what I was looking for. I had a small, very ripe tomato from the garden that I diced up and put in as well as 2 leftover pieces of bacon. What a treat!!! Thanks for the base.

These potatoes are AWESOME!  The most incredible home fries I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly & thought the instructions were perfect!  They cooked up crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and the flavor of paprika & chives is spot on!  This will be a repeat in our house for sure!  The Hubster said that he would gladly eat these at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  :)  Thanks so much for this keeper recipe!

I cooked up some bacon and when it was time to make the home fries, I used part of the bacon fat with a little butter to cook the home fries. With an onion, and a side of bacon and eggs.....this is breakfast heaven.

Pretty good home fries recipe. I added a drizzle of olive oil (helps keep potatoes from sticking and burning as just butter will do) and added a little white sugar  (2 tsp.) with the other seasonings. This helps to give potatoes a slight caramelized appearance without making them sweet. i also increased the garlic as we like allot of it in my family. Overall, was well received and have added to my recipe box.

Home fries are a staple on the weekends served with sausage gravy and biscuits! I like to add a small amount of water to the pan with the potatoes and butter and cover to steam the potatoes for a short time.  I love to add roasted red pepper strips and crumbled bacon to change them up.

Yum yum! I really expected the potatoes to either burn or be undercooked.. but it wasn't! It was so soft and delicious! The reason I gave 4 stars was because it wasn't crispy, and I added a lot more garlic and paprika for it to have that delicious flavour.. and any way to keep those condiments from burning?

These were good and had a great texture (just the right amount of crispyness, yet tender inside) but could use a little more flavor.  I used three cloves of garlic, but it could use more.  Still really good though- I ate some dipped in ketchup, and some plain.  Good both ways!

I followed recipe as written, except I boiled my potatoes 10 minutes prior to quartering. You don't want them too soft. It's important to use a really good non-stick pan and allow each side to crisp us before flipping chunks. Great base recipe to build on.

Made these and they were delicious. The only change I made was I cooked some onions along with the garlic before I added the potatoes. My picky son even asked for seconds! :-)

I used EVOO and it still stuck to the pan but smelled delicious while cooking and tasted great at the end!  Added one chopped onion at the beginning along with lots of minced garlic, paprika, onion powder and garlic powder.   Will try a cast iron skillet next time in the hopes of it sticking less.  My husband and I enjoyed this very much!!

Great recipe, perfect texture with some crispness. I cut the cooking time down to ten minutes though, and added a LOT more salt - I can't see how 1/4 tsp would be nearly enough for this recipe.

These may be the best eat at home, home fries.  I followed directions pretty closely, except I added a bit of olive oil with the melting butter and I added extra garlic.  The last 10 minutes I put the potatoes on a cookie sheet and placed in the oven on broil.  I had the over door open a bit and I watched them to make sure they didn't get too crispy.  Really, really good!

Nice recipe but it needs some tweaking because the potatoes started to burn. 15 minutes was to long. I added onions and peppers with the rest of the ingredients. They were tender after coming for 5 minutes, any longer they will burn. The seasoning was on point. I will be making again with some adjustments.

Great recipe. Have to turn the potatoes often enough so one side doesnt crisp too fast. I added sone water near the end so the potatoes could get a little more tender as well as some chunky salsa go add more flavor...

I followed this recipe exactly except I used 3 cloves of garlic and Yukon golds. I have to say they are very tasty but WAY too buttery, I wish I only used 1/2 as much as the recipe calls for.Oh well I will work out real hard tomorrow :)

I like the way a cast iron pan makes the potatoes as crispy as you want...non-stick can't do that as well. I always use a mild olive oil..doesn't burn & is healthy.  I also love the taste of carmelized onions. I add thickly diced onions with the potatoes & cook slowly. If you like fresh garlic, it needs to be added towards the end of cooking...maybe 10 minutes. You need to use a metal spatula to scrape up the crispies as they cook. Yum

With the substitution of extra virgin olive oil for half the butter, this method of cooking home fries worked very well. I especilly liked the fresh chives, but i did not increase the heat when adding them, as my potatoes were cooked through at this point.  You could add onions and/or green peppers and vary the seasonings to suit your taste.

These were decent. Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 EVOO.  It was a bit much, maybe next time used 1/2 butter and 1/4 EVOO.  I also added a bit more salt (I used Kosher), and a bit more paprika.  I thought they were good, and my Easter brunch guests really enjoyed them. (No leftovers)  I will make them again.

Instead of frying the potatoes, I boiled the potatoes for approximately 20 minutes.  I melted 2 tbsp of butter, instead of 4 tbsp, and combined the remaining ingredients.  After the potatoes had cooked, I drained the water and added the mixture.  I covered the potatoes and allowed them to set for ten minutes before serving.  They were great and I had fewer dishes to wash.

This is how I always make my potatoes for breakfast... The only thing I do differently is put a thin layer of water before I cover the potatoes then leave them alone. They come out perfect for me everytime. I use parsley instead of paprika. Love these in the morning!

Mine didn't cook for the recommended time.  They were done a lot faster.  They did start to stick and burn to the bottom of my skillet, but I was able to save them.  I used red potatoes since that's what I had on hand and I double all the spices.  These had a really great taste and turned out really soft.

These weren't very spectacular.  I had to add much more seasoning than was listed on the recipe for less potatoes.  Still wasn't very tasty.  As another reviewer mentioned, bottom of the pan burned.  Next time will use water on the bottom to (hopefully) prevent this from happening again.

These were very tasty and went great with breakfast. I did make some changes though.  I used 3 cloves of garlic which was a nice garlicy flavor without being overbearing.  I also had no chives so I chopped up one small onion and added it in with the garlic and spices.  Came out delicious.  Thanks.

I didn’t use a non-stick pan but I did use some vegetable oil plus butter. I put it on high for five minutes covered and turned a couple of times to get a nice brown without burning. Then I turned it down to low for 5 more minutes. I used smoked paprika, season salt and parsley instead of any chives or onions. Great recipe!

These were excellent made in a large non stick fry pan using ghee instead of butter. I didn’t have chives so added 2 minced scallions during the last few minutes at the same time as I added fresh minced garlic. I dislike the taste of browned garlic so opted to cook it only for a few minutes. The taste was wonderful and the outsides were deep brown with soft yummy insides. Thank you for posting Steve.

I never match the same quantities when I make these, usually eyeballing everything but I always use white potatoes.  Regardless, the combination of ingredients is perfect and they are always a hit.

I followed the cooking steps and times exactly, and didn't overcrowd the potatoes in the pan, which would have created a steamed mush.  And I always add more garlic and onions as I do with every recipe!  Superb!

This is my go to recipe for home fries! The only thing I do different is sautee a small onion (thinly diced) with minced garlic at the beginning. Then, add the potatoes and follow remaining steps! My hubby and  two growing boys cannot get enough. 

Enjoy!

Very easy - I used unpeeled fingerling potatoes & onions from my mom's garden. Easy & delicious. Next time will cut butter in 1/2. Using a nonstick pan I don't think as butter was needed.

I started off using the hot, leftover bacon grease to fry the cubes. Then I seasoned the potatoes  with everything mentioned but I added rosemary and a quarter of a thinly sliced onion. Once the edges were crispy I then added a tablespoon  of butter and immediately  covered the pan. 
I eyeballed it from there stirring in between seasoning and "steaming" with the butter, nothing stuck to my nonstick pan. It did however, make the house smell like "breakfast" 
I also kept it on medium high heat... it literally took all of 10 mins minus the potato prep.

I made this in a non-stick pan. Very important. I also used quite  a bit more butter. Maybe 3 times the amount. Even at medium heat, I was noticing too much butter burn off. I'm sure my oven plays a part in that. The cooking time was spot on though. I also added some onions to the pan as well. Next time, I plan on adding some peppers and onions. The important thing is the cook times are right on so you can play around with ingredients.

Hearty and delicious--a meal in themselves! I love the crispiness on the outside and texture of the added spices. I also add regular paprika and dried onion bits, even if I have fresh ones, which I dice and cook along with the potatoes. One thing to stress is that they won't brown much unless you use butter, and even less so if you use a non-stick pan. If you don't want the excess fat, then use oil but bake them instead.

First off, you don't need a non-stick pan. You need to know how to cook. I just made these in my carbon steel pan with no problem. Fried up some bacon first, then used the grease for the potatoes. Excellent! Crispy, brown and fluffy in the middle. A keeper for sure.

AMAZING!!!! I mostly stuck to the recipe, although I did make a few minor changes. I used three potatoes medium (there was only two of us), used two tablespoons of butter and about a tablespoon of olive oil, added extra garlic (one just isn't enough), and added 1 small onion. I also used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, which meant I didn't need to add paprika (it was in the salt). As many others have mentioned, a nonstick pan would be VERY usefull... My pan was a big mess afterwards. Not fun. And as many have mentioned also, I didn't need the extra ten minutes. Turned out absolutely wonderful, and me and my sister ate almost all of it! Thank you for this amazing recipe!!!

Good recipe that I've used for years...Except... Partially cooking the potatoes saves a lot of time.  I use unpeeled red potatoes, and chopped onion.  I never use margarine or butter in these.  Olive oil is delicious and is much healthier.

Easy, great recipe...growing up this was called smothered potatoes, we would add sliced onion while cooking and sometimes serve with ketchup...always good!

These are the best home fries I have EVER made! I did large cubes and left the lid on for 15 mins, off for 10. Used half butter/half evoo, garlic powder and chopped onion for chives as I didn't have any. This will be my go to recipe for now on.

I made these in my cast iron skillet and they were excellent!  I used smoked paprika instead of plain.  I'll be making these often. They were a hit.

I cubed the potatos and they came out perfect.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Flavor was fantastic.

I tried cooking these with both a non-stick and copper bottom metal pan. I found that it took a little longer but that it didn't burn in the copper bottom pan (I think that might be because I used olive oil not butter... not sure tho.) I used at least twice the amount of garlic and lots more paprika. Mine haven't been coming out as crispy which I have discovered is from using new (young) red potatoes instead of russet. I will be making these all the time!
