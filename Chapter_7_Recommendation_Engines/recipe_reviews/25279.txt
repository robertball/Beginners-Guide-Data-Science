I am a huge fan of EASY, fast, and nutritious meals -- and this is one of them!  The only changes I made were to use bottled peppers like someone else mentioned in the reviews; eliminated the olives (just because I don't like them); and used Thai long grain rice (since I have a gigantic bag of the stuff).  I don't like super hot meals, but this dish was a flavourful heat.  I found myself adding a bit more jalapenos each time!  Don't make the mistake I did at first though -- I drained the black beans.  It was still good but it is oh so delicious on rice with more sauce! I make a pile of this stuff, and dole it out as a snack, sidedish, or main meal with salad.  I also did what someone else suggested: sautee some onions and garlic and add it to the beans -- YUM!!  Thanks for a quick recipe with minimum dishes to clean up afterwards!

After reading the reviews, I drained most of the liquid from the beans.  The whole family enjoyed this and my son thought it was excellent.  He rarely likes anything I cook.  I did add a cubed cooked chicken breast to make my hubby happy.  Next time will add some more chicken and my son asked to add more black olives next time too.  Thank you Amy for a great recipe.

I drained the juice from the beans as suggested by other reviews-big mistake! The beans were too dry.  The flavor was great! I loved them but I would say LEAVE THE JUICE!!  This is definetely one of my favorite side dishes nad I will make many more times!

This was easy but I have to agree I did not think it was spicy at all. It would be good to serve with some type of spicy meat.

This is a great recipe. I did make some additions that I think just added to it. I sauteed some chopped onion and garlic and added to the beans along with the other ingredients. Also added cheese,green onion, olives, cilantro, shredded lettuce and sour cream on top but did not put it back in the oven just left it "fresh". Serve with some tortilla chips to scoop...Yummy!

I made this with regular white rice and yellow onions as that's what I had on hand. I also threw in some sliced pre-cooked garlic and jalepeno chicken sausage to make it more of a meal. I don't like the texture of undrained, unrinsed black beans, but the mixture was rather dry, so I added in half a can of diced tomatoes with as much juice as I could squeeze out. Turned out pretty good. Thanks, Amy!

I should have gone with my instincts.  I thought it was strange to leave the beans UNDRAINED, but I followed the recipe anyway.  It was terrible.  It was incredibly watery.  We tried straining it through a slatted spoon as we served it, but though this removed the excess liquid, it also strained away most of the spices, making it flavorless.  We ate a few bites and chucked the rest.

Gosh I'm glad (most) everyone liked my dish!!
Just wanted to add that lately I've been adding about a 1/2 cup of salsa to the beans before baking them---yummy!  Bake it a little longer so its not too watery. Also, I've tried using chili beans (in the sauce); that works too.

Pretty good.  I like mine a little spicier.   Might add garlic next time and more hot stuff. Still reminded me of Texmex beans.  Will make again for sure.

This dish is great if you like spicy. It goes great with chiken and steak as well.
Or you can have it alone wth a nice salad. (Goes great with Greek salad).
I like to add a bit of garlic to mine

We thought it was pretty flavorless.  It needs either meat or more spices.

I make this all the time! I cook the un-drained beans on the stove top, in a pot.  Adding the peppers and spices. 

I'll sometimes substitute the rice for quinoa (depending on what I have in the pantry).   

I top it off with diced tomatoes, avocado, fresh made salsa, and a spoon of sour cream instead of the grated cheese.

I was really happy with this recipe.  I added some sauteed veggies to kind of bump up the nutritional value (onion, portabella, red and green bell pepper, zucchini).  The only problem I had was the rice, but I have a tough time with brown rice sometimes.  Anyhow, I thought it was delicious and I could actually see this as a great burrito filling.  Excellent and I will definately use this recipe again.  Thanks!!

this recipe is a good starter. I added a can of corn,1lb of cooked ground beef, can of drained diced tomatoes, 3 cups cheese, cheyenne pepper, 4 chopped jalepenos. I did drain most of the beans liquid but left a small amount. I baked covered and it turne out great, I served over brown rice.

Kay, I'm not going to rate it, b/c I changed it alot, so I dont think my finished product turned out the same as the intended product. But it was still freaking awesome :) Cooked 1/2 can of black, and 1/2 can of red beans on stove over low simmer for about 30 min (w/ about 1/2 the juice from each can) with cayenne pepper (little more than a tablespoon) cumin (little less than recipe stated), 1/2 a can of green chilies (instead of jalapenos) and a couple of good dashes of garlic salt. After bout 30 min added some spicy sausage and let all that simmer for about another 10 min, then added the cooked rice and stired it all together. Served with Authentic Mexican Cornbread from this site. Yum :) nice and spicy

Easy to reduce sodium!  Simply drain the beans, rinse, then add approx 1 cup of low sodium chicken or vegetable broth, preferrably homemade.  This will keep the beans from drying out, and creates a nice 'sauce' when put over the rice.  I also took one of the previous suggestions and sauteed up some onion and garlic, along with half a red pepper, and added it to the beans.  Delicious recipe, will definitely make it again.  Thanks Amy!

This is the ultimate desperation dinner--quick and easy with minimal clean-up.  I used a mixture of black beans and kidney beans (do NOT drain the beans and bake uncovered) and added a healthy splash of red wine vinegar and three cloves minced garlic for a little extra flavor.  It was still a bit bland for my taste, but that was easily remedied with some Tabasco.  I only had Arborio rice, so the finished dish was quite creamy once I topped it with low-fat sour cream and cheddar cheese, but the texture and flavor were great!  My picky husband was *impressed* and I had a really tasty dinner that provided enough left-overs for next day's lunch.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

As written, this is about 3 stars because it isn't all that flavorful, it's too liquid-y, and it calls for too little rice for this amount of beans.  I made more rice, drained the beans, then added salsa, garlic, and lime juice (which takes care of the dryness other reviewers had mentioned).  I also increased the cumin powder to 2 1/2 tsp. and left out the olives (never liked them).  With these changes, it is a great, filling dish that has plenty of flavor. I'll make it again, but with the changes mentioned above.

Very good!  I added a spoonful of sour cream on top, and it cooled the spices off just enough to really enjoy it!  I don't think the brown rice needs to be cooked for 40 minutes though... I bought a box of instant brown rice, and only needed about 15 to be cooked completely.  Otherwise you just burn the rice.  I thought the large quantity of beans would overpower the taste, but it definitely did not.  I will make this one again!

This was really good! I added some shredded rotisserie chicken on top. Be careful of the chili powder & jalapenos - my husband thought it was too spicy after a few bites, but this was easily fixed by adding beans to it. Also, we topped if off with a dollop of sour cream.

I changed these just a little -- I didn't have any brown rice, so I used regular.  I added 1/2 cup canned tomatoes with green chili peppers, and diced some polish sausage, sauteed it, and mixed it in.  Delicious!

This was really good... I too drained about half of the liquid, but I later wished I'd kept all of the liquid because I personally don't like semi-dry beans and rice.  But it was a very good recipe!  The only other change I made was to omit the black olives because the hubby doesn't like them (oh, and I used two jalapenos from a can because I couldn't find fresh!).  Thanks for the recipe!

this should please even bean-haters!  I was helped by all the reviews; i ended up keeping just a little of the drained bean juice, I added garlic and extra green onion and put extra cheese on top. If you don't drain all the bean juice and you let it sit for any amount of time, the rice will absorb the juice.  Cilantro as a garnish after it is cooked is nice also but  not necessary.  I mixed the beans and rice first before cooking also.

I found it odd that the description had 3 kinds of beans but only black are mention in the recipe?? See following--
"Black, red, and pinto beans are baked with jalapeno peppers and spices, and then served atop hot brown rice."

This recipe was excellent.  I did not have fresh jalapeno peppers, so I used about 1/4 cup from a jar.

I made this last night and it was WONDERFUL! I used the salsa as well which gave it a nice flavor. I would make this again, and it was so cheap too, I didnt use the cheese or sour cream on top and it was still delicious.

I love this! We've made it several times, only I add a pound of pan fried chicken, three jalopenos and twice the amount of olives, and add fresh green onions as a garnish instead of baking them with the beans. It is super simple and cheap- I follow the recipe's original serving size and we have enough for a few lunches and dinners- it's hearty and very filling! I eat the beans and rice topped with salsa, sour cream and chives. My husband and son put the mixture into tortillas and make burritos- this is a family favorite - we make it about once a week.

Because I love the typical Puerto Rican style of red beans and rice, I used kidney beans instead of black beans and added sofrito in addition to the seasonings suggested.  I omitted the cheese to make a vegan version of the dish.  It was delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Next time, I will add more heat.

Tasty and healthy with great flavors-- I think instead of baking the beans I will just heat them on the stove next time (less time and easier cleanup!) Thanks for the recipe!

We absolutely love this Beans & Rice recipe and I have made it numerous times. I like to add sauteed diced onion & minced garlic to the beans before baking, but other than that, I think the other spices are spot on and the jalapeno is a nice kick. We love spicy food and this is a hearty, satisfying dish. Sometimes, I'll make taco seasoned ground beef to add to the beans & rice bowl, top with shredded lettuce & sour cream, and it is total dinner delight. :) Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Pretty good. A little bland. I ended up wrapping this along with some chicken and salsa into some whole-wheat tortillas. The idea was great, and I think I'll spice it up a little more next time.

I don't like the slimy juice in the cans of black beans, so I used one drained can of black beans and one undrained can of chili beans. I only put jalapenos on half, so my husband and I, as well as my picky kids, ate it right up. We used instant brown rice, and increased it to 2 cups.

Very good, easy, and healthy.  This one made our "tried-and-true" list. :)  After the first time, though, I decided that jarred jalapenos were better than fresh - so I didn't get pepper oil in my eyes (OUCH!).

Excellent, easy to make and tasted great.  I added half a cup of medium salsa and will switch to 1 1/2 cups of salsa next time and skip the jalepeno.  I also added a tsp of garlic and only 1/2 tsp of cumin because of personal preference.  I didn't have black pepper and used cayenne instead.  This was healthy and very flavourful.

This was a great recipe and easy to follow too. I impressed everyone with this dish, and would probably make it even hotter next time! Might try draining some of the bean juice to lower the sodium a bit, and I thought it needed more like a cup of rice for the amount of beans there were...

I made this recipe exactly as it read, and for my husband and I (who actually happen to be bean lovers), this was WAY overpowered by the beans. The heat and spices were good, but there are definitely several things I will change next time I make this.  First of all, I will drain the beans.  Not draining them left this way too soupy.  I ended up putting it all in a pan on top of the stove to try to cook some of the liquid out (instead of baking it as the recipe reads.)  Next time I think I will also trade one of the cans of beans for a can of corn (drained).  I will also heat it on the stovetop again(for faster results) and then mix my cooked rice into the bean/corn mixture to make it more of a dirty rice dish.  Then I'll add the cheese to the top at the end.  All in all, the idea of this recipe was good, it just needed a little tweaking.

Loved it.  My wife, who likes "spicy, but not too spicy" said it was "very, very good."  If I was just making it for myself, I'd kick it up a notch, but I tend to like very spicy.

This recipe was great!  I read the reviews before cooking, so I added about twice the chili powder and cumin, and we left off the cheese at the end because we were using the beans in burritos.  

Excellent accompaniment to a good spiced chicken recipe!

This is a very good recipe!  I followed the instructions as indicated with the exception of the black olives since I didn't have any.  I replaced them with green olives. For those like me who like their food hot and spicy, this hits the spot.  However, for those who like their food a bit milder tasting, I would suggest to skip the chili pepper in the black bean mixture. Next time, instead of using brown rice, I'll be using par-broiled rice.  For some reason, brown rice doesn't appeal to my palate. Besides that, this recipe is quite good and I will definitely make it again.

It was very easy to make and smelled really great while it was cooking, but i thought the end affect lacked flavor.

It was spicy but that was all we pretty much tasted.

Overall, i liked it as a side dish (ala' red beans and rice style) but not as the main course.

I used 1 16oz can of red kidney and a 24oz can of pinto beans for this. Used 2 habanero peppers instead of the jalapenos because I knew they wouldn't be spicy enough. I then added the cooked rice into the casserole dish. After 30 minutes I put the cheese, olives and chives(instead of green onions)and another 1/2 cup of cheese on top. Only put it back in for 2-3 minutes because the cheese was melted. It was still so hot after sitting on the table for 10 minutes we couldn't eat it.  I would suggest letting it sit for about 20 minutes before you want to eat it. Ours was very creamy and spicy. It is an easy, quick, nutritious meal that I will definitely make again. 4* only because I changed a few things!

This recipe was great!!  I love trying new things out on my husband who, by the way, loves spanish food.  This was great.  We had no left overs.  The only thing I suggest is that if you like alittle extra rice make some b/c this was just enough for 4 in my house.  yum!  Thanks again.

I made this the other night with a few additions: I first sauteed onions with chorizo sausage, then added the beans and seasonings as listed with the addition of some salsa since I had no jalapeno on hand. It was a yummy dinner and equally yummy lunch at work today. I prefer a little spice so I added some hot sauce when I served it, but otherwise it was very good. Boyfriend liked it too.

This is excellent. I used black beans and white rice, since I didn't have any brown. It seemed soupy when it came out of the oven, but once you put it over the rice, it's perfect. And very easy, too!

The recipe was great. I added some organic Italian sausage, but thought that something was missing. I really don't like tomato sauce in recipes, but wonder if maybe a natural tomato product or possibly some diced tomatoes just before serving might be good. I share my dish with my mom and she loved it! Maybe I am a bit too hard on myself!

Make with Goya Black Bean Soup (cuban) instead of just the black beans and you'll get an additional wonderful spiced version.  Five stars with the cuban soup instead of plain black beans.  :-)

The family LOVES this recipe.  I use the amounts of seasoning that we like. I have never added the black olives because the kids just don't like them.  Sometimes I add some precooked chipotle monterey jack chicken sausage.  The beans and rice create a very filling meal.

I reduced the recipe to three servings. We paired this with (allrecipes - Crispy Chipotle Lime Tilapia with Cool Avocado Sauce) a great combination. I cooked the beans on the stove top instead of baking.

Delicious and quick!  I cut this recipe in half and made some changes using what I had on hand. I added a small can of chopped green chilies, chopped onion, and minced garlic.  I used jalapenos from a jar and white rice.  I omitted the black olives and green onions because I didn't have them on hand.  I drained most of the liquid off the beans, and still had plenty of juices, especially with the undrained chilies.  I will make this again very soon!

I'm very disappointed with this dish. I would not call it Spicy, in fact we found it quite bland. I added extra onions and some garlic and it was still bland! Had great texture, and so much potential. I'll make this again, but with more tweeks.

This was a very good recipe, the only reason I am only giving it 3 stars was because I made a few changes.  I used day old rice from the night before and put that in the bottom of the dish, then added rinsed and drained black beans, along with diced tomatoes with the juice and I added a little less than a 1/4 cup of water for more liquid.  I cooked that for about 20 minutes then added onions and cheese.  I will make this again with the changes I made.

This is one of my favorite meatless meals to make.  I fell in love with brown rice after trying this recipe-at first I was a little apprehensive about it.  I didn't have any jalapeños but I just about added every hot spice that I own and it was delicious! I did not drain the black beans and it was still great I thought.

I used a can of black beans and a can of dark kidney beans (because I did not have enough black beans). I used garlic, omitted the onions and olives.  I also added cooked chicken and a few tablespoons of salsa.  My 7 year old gobbled it up, but the 3 and 5 year olds were unimpressed.  I think this is a keeper, but I think I will have to wait until i am done nursing because the baby was up all night!

I used a 9x13x2 pan, didn't drain, and didn't cover.  The consistency came out nice and creamy.  The flavor is good and wholesome tasting, though not spectacular.   But this might be because instead of chili powder, I used cayenne pepper.  I'll probably surf around and try out some more black bean recipes before making this again.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I brought it to a potluck and everyone loved it. The brown rice gave it a nutty texture. I gave the leftovers to a friend and the next day she served it over scrambled eggs. Yum!

I love this recipe!!  I doubled it and then also doubled the rice so it was 2 cups uncooked rice to 4 cans black beans and took it to a church lunch.  I added extra cumin and some garlic salt.  I did not drain the bean juice and cooked the beans as suggested then put the rice in a 9 x 13 dish and the seasoned beans on top.  I only topped with the cheese and gr. onions since my hubby does not like olives.  It was a big hit at the church lunch and I will make this again.

This was pretty good but I ended up making them spicier by adding some green chili peppers, garlic, and onion powder.  I drained and rinsed the beans, put them in a pot, cooked on top of the stove in a little beef bouillon, just didn't see need for the oven.

Wonderful dish. Can't wait to make this again. Served with a grilled chicken breast recipe from this site and loved every bite of both. I used canned jalapenos (about 2) and it was plenty spicy. And we like really spicy food. Also added more chedder cheese (I only had mild, instead of sharp). Next time I might add some fresh cilantro on top.

I halved the recipe the first time. I also used Daiya cheese and instant rice. This is definitely a keeper.  As a vegetarian, I'm always interested in new beans and rice recipes. 

Thanks Amy. Great recipe.

Great easy recipe.  Will be adding it to my rotation of recipes to make. I used white rice instead of brown, made 2 cups of rice.  I added onions and bell peppers which i sauted before adding it to the black beans.   Fed 3 people, only leftover rice.  Next time going to double black beans and other ingredients  so we can have leftovers.  Will definitely be making it again.

This was super yummy! I did not drain the beans - the extra "juice" is delicious over the rice. Without the extra juice I think it would have been a "dry" dish. I added sautéed onions, garlic and Turkey Kielbasa! My husband loved it as well! Definitely will make this again.

I went against my better judgment and followed the directions to a T, not mixing the ingredients together, but sprinkling them on top of the beans. I was left with flavorless beans beneath a glob of everything else. 

Probably should mix the spices and other ingredients with the beans so the flavors actually mix and influence each other, which is part of the point of cooking.

For our tastes it was surprisingly mild even though it has jalapeños in it.  So don't be afraid of the jalapeños!  We do like it really spicy!  So much that can be done with this one, I look forward to making it again.

This turned out better than I thought. Very easy. I used a mixture of red and wild rice. I can see this becoming a staple for dinner

I made this today and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very simple and easy to make, right up my street! The only thing I did different was to omit the cheese. For those who thought it wasn't spicy, please note that the condiments are to be adjusted to your personal taste. Definitely a keeper!

I omitted the olives because my family doesn't really like them. I took 1 reviewed suggestion and added sautéed onions, garlic  and bell pepper. I used white because I already had it in the pantry. The family loved it. It was a tad too spicy for me so I added corn to quench some of the heat. I will definitely make this again especially with my cornbread side.

Needs more heat. Next time I try it I think I'll add onions to the main dish. Works as a chip dip.

This will definitely be put on the make-again list. I did salt it a bit but it needed even a little bit more salt. The jalapenos were the best part, I'll put more in next time and maybe a bit more cheese. Thanks for a nice recipe!

After reading the reviews, I made a few changes based on our tastes.  I poached two small chicken breasts in a small can of V8 juice, then diced them and saved the juice.  I added the juice and the chicken to the drained and rinsed beans, the cooked rice, and the seasonings and jalapeno in a casserole dish.  I heated this per the recipe, then sprinkled on the cheese, green onion, and two chopped yellow chilies I had.  My husband loved it and I will be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My wife hates beans. I've taken her to New Orleans multiple times and can't get her to try red beans and rice.

She went back for seconds on this.

P.S. Sprinkle some lime juice on each serving.

A tasty topping for the rice.  I spiced up the beans with more cayenne pepper (because I like it) and added the fresh herbs I had on hand.  Usually we drain black beans, but not in this recipe . . . a nice quality.  Moist and flavorful.  Later I used the beans in a Black Bean Breakfast Bowl (recipe from this site), with avocado and eggs.  The pleasure continues!

Extra chile powder and some curry. I don't like hot but I like flavor. Used all then liquid with the beans and it cooked up thick and poured over rice it was great. Added a little sour cream when serving. Very good quick easy meal.

I made exactly as the recipe the first time and it was really good.  The second time I added onions and garlic and it was even better.  I'm just me so had lots of left overs and found it even better the next day.  The second time I added  onions and garlic.   I used some to make stuffed peppers for dinner and it was delicious.  I didn't find it too runny in the least but I made sure I left the lid off during baking.

My husband raved about this dish!  I have to admit I made changes knowing in advance our love of spicy food; I increased the cumin to 1 1/2 teaspoons and doubled the amount of jalapeños because they came out of my garden and I knew they did not have a lot of heat. I also added a pound of hot Italian sausage cut up and cooked seperately.  This one will be done over and over.

This recipe is delicious!  I did make a couple of changes suggested by others especially  because of lack of liquid that made dish less enjoyable. I sauteed a cup of onions, chopped- with a large clove of garlic with the chopped jalapeño. Added to remaining ingredients except cheese along with 1-1/2 C of fresh canned tomatoes, 3/4 C water and 1T. Vegetable soup base. I rinsed and drained beans also. My family loved this recipe. The heat intensity was just right

I just finished eating this and it's now in my library of favourite recipes.  I try to make the recipe exactly as written the first time and then tweak it later but this came into my inbox and sounded like my husband would like it as he loves spicy food. I wanted to make it right away. However, I was missing jalapenos.  I  chopped half a red and a green bell pepper which I had left over and put a rounded tsp of of hot chili flakes for added heat.  I chopped three cloves of garlic. I put a little olive oil on the botom of the dish and put the peppers and garlic in first until the garlic was absorbed into the oil and the peppers cooked a little.  Then I added the beans and spices. Didn't have brown rice or regular white, so I cooked black with a 1/c cup barley and basmati  separately as an interesting mix.  I then followed the rest of the directions. Just before the cheese and olives, I added all the rice to the dish and mixed it in so it could really absorb the flavours. It was incredible and enough to feed an army. My husband loved it and so did I. We are trying to eat  more vegetarian meals. Although I wasn't able to make is as written, this was an excellent recipe! So two thumbs up to the cook and many thanks for posting this.

I decided to drain the beans instead of following the recipe. Big mistake. Once I made it properly even my wife ate it, and she does not like beans.

This  was easy but I feel like it lacked a depth of flavor. Just a little boring and flat. I'm having it again for lunch today with added salsa and cilantro, and I'll see if it improves. Otherwise, I'll read through the reviews and make some additions next time I make it.

Delicious recipe!  Loved the olives on top, that was awesome and something I wouldn't have thought to include in a beans and rice dish.

This dish is DELICIOUS. I like to make a big batch of it and use it for lunch every day. I also add cooked shrimp to it for some extra protein and flavor. This is not very spicy on it's own so I like to add extra spices!

The beans still had a little too much bite for me.  I think i will have to stick with the long way.   But the flavors were really good.

This was great! I ended up adding celery salt and bay leave as well. I did a half recipe; so it ended up being a 1/4 T celery salt and a bay leaf as well. It was amazing!

I loved this recipe! I was looking for an uncomplicated bean recipe to add inject some variety into a pasta heavy diet for marathon training.  I usually make a recipe following the instructions once before making changes.  I did not drain the beans and my version turned out great.  Now I add another jalapeño pepper and instead of serving it on top of the rice, I stir the rice in before putting it back into the oven to melt the cheese.  I also serve with a bit of fresh grated cheese on top.  Very filling when served with a side dish of veggies.

This was great!! I mixed a little chorizo with the rice and topped it off with eggs over easy. I also had it without the rice and it was still good! I will definately be making this recipe again!

This was pretty good. If you read through the reviews, the person who submitted this recipe has reviewed it saying she adds salsa to it before baking it. I didn't try it that way, but I will in the future, because salsa would give it that missing jazz that I felt it needed. I do think we prefer our black beans to be riceless (we used this as a side dish) so I'm not sure I would try this one again, but I'm glad I did. Thanks for the recipe! (BTW: A 2-quart casserole dish is smaller than an 8x8 glass baking dish, though an 8x8 will work too. I had to google it because I had no idea how many quarts my dishes hold!)

This is a great, simple, tasty meal that everyone will love!! The only change I made was substituting the regular cheese with low-fat cheese.  It was perfect!

I had to change this up just because I didn't have everything and took a few tips...drained and rinsed black beans, added a can of undrained garbanzos, added half small can of white corn, about 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 cup chopped green pepper and 2 cloves chopped fresh garlic.  Drizzeld olive oil over and used a mix of grated jack cheese and crumbled Velveeta.  It was so delicious!!  I will also use leftovers in burritos.  Thanks so much for sharing my husband loved it!

I love this recipe though I modify it quit a bit. First of all I use one can black beans and one can pinto. I drain the liquid from the pinto beans but use the black bean water in the recipe. Additionally I add a can of corn, one chopped red pepper and a chopped onion. Mixed together with the rice, cheese, green onion and olives this makes a great burrito filler!

Quick, easy, and cheap! I didn't add the cheese in order to make it healthier and it was just as tasty. Aslo, canned jalepenos work just fine when you don't have fresh ones on hand.

This tasted much better than expected!  I made it just as written except that I used white rice instead of brown and doubled the cheese.  I also mixed the rice in with the beans while baking it.  This had a very unique flavor with the olives and the beans.

This was very good and so easy. I used quinoa instead of rice. I also subbed about 1/2 cup roasted green chiles for the jalapeno, and I used half red and half green chili powder. I'd add one or two more green onions next time.

Awesome easy recipe!  So easy to adapt to one's own taste and ingredients on hand.  I avoided the "drain beans or not" debate, because I make beans from scratch to avoid too much sodium. Thanks for sharing!

I used black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Adobo, cumin, and hot sauce.  I added shredded cheddar cheese as directed.  I don't have jalapeno peppers on hand, I hate olives, and I was too lazy to cut up onions.  I forgot to add salt, but it tasted decent to me.  I ate it with coconut jasmine rice.

This was an ok dish. It did need a bit more flavor. But it was still good.
