This recipe is awesome.  I used a larger tenderloin.  4-5 lb tenderloin serves 10-12 adults. I roasted in 425 degree oven 7-8 mins per pound for medium rare (temp 135 degrees) Make sure to roast UNCOVERED.

I rarely write recipe reviews, but I have to say that this was the best tenderloin I have ever made. Everyone at my dinner party loved it!  I rubbed the tenderloin with the herbs and lots of salt and pepper. I then gave it a really good sear and roasted as directed. It was perfect!

I have finally found - after years of searching - the perfect recipe for our Christmas dinner.  Last year I tried a "Herbed Beef Tenderloin" recipe from this site.  It was pretty good, but this one was amazingly good.  I may make it more often than just for Christmas.

WOW!!! I made this for Christmas dinner this year; first time following this recipe and first time cooking a roast tenderloin. Everyone commented on how good this was. I cooked.a 10lb tenderloin at 425 degrees for 10 minutes per pound to get it to 130 internal temperature. This fed a crowd of 8 people well (everyone had third and fourth servings). My husband commented it tasted like something you get at a steakhouse restaurant and it was the best Christmas dinner EVER! I've been asked to make it again and again. I multiplied the seasoning to make it enough for the size of the roast and I used butter instead of oil and sautéed the garlic, rosemary, and thyme before spreading it on the seared beef.

I liked the flavor and the idea of cooking in the oven... but 
the temp was way off at 350 - after 30 mins the 1.4lb roast was  nowhere close to done. I upped it to 425 for 10 mins and it came out fine. Let it rest and then it was an awesome meal....

Absolutely fantastic. That's all I can say about this recipe. For everyone that is having problems with cook times - USE A MEAT THERMOMETER. Every piece of meat is different. An oven safe meat thermometer will ensure that the very expensive piece of meat you just put in your oven will turn out properly.

Good rub, good sauce, and unless you don't like tenderloin, why wouldn't it be 5 stars?

I also used a larger roast at 4lb so I doubled the ingredients and baked at 425 for 7 min per lb.  Once I let it rest covered for 10 min it was gone in less than 5 min!!  The creamy horseradish sauce was excellent!!  Will do again!!

I've made grilled beef tenderloin roasts in the past that were out of this world, so I figured this one would be good, but my expectations were somewhat low. But I wanted a recipe that I could make in the house. Well, this turned out to be phenomenal!! The rub was delicious, and the horseradish sauce complimented it so well. We all loved it!! My roast was slightly smaller, but the cooking times were just about the same as the recipe stated. Perfect!

We used a 6lb top sirloin and it took longer to cook. I didn't brown it, just roasted it at 425 for about 1 hour and 20 mins or so and then let it rest. Very important to let it rest for at least 15 minutes. That sauce was a perfect addition. It's especially good for people who think they don't like horseradish as this is a much milder taste. Yum! Thanks!

Good meal and tasty, but cook time was way off. Cooked at 425 for full 30 and was (rare!!!) In middle. Would cook at 375 for 45 min.  Or use thermometer to be sure.

I wish I had read the most recent review because it was completely accurate.  I went by the cooking temperature and timeline in the recipe and it wasn't even close to what the reality was!  I ended up with more than a hour's extra cook time, in addition to raising the temperature in my oven, and all my finely honed timing for Christmas dinner went right out the window- while the roast tasted very good, I'm sure I could have found another recipe to equal the taste and one that wouldn't be so problematic.  My suggestion is you shop around- this simply wasn't worth the hassle.

I actually used the simpler cooking directions from J Miller’s Blue Cheese Beef Tenderloin but the horseradish sauce here is awesome.

This was delicious!  I made it for a group of 10 people and everyone, youngsters included, really enjoyed it.  Tender, flavourful and relatively easy to prepare.   I added 1/4 cup of grainy mustard to the herb mixture.   Also served store-bought horseradish along side as well as a Green Peppercorn Sauce.    Will definitely be making this again!   Note: I also upped the oven temperature to 425 F and roasted 6-7 minutes per pound. Meat thermometer is  a must!

made it with a whitetail deer tenderloin, the cook time was completely different (as expected) but this came out great. It was a monday dinner for us so just twice baked spudatters and salads were a nice compliment. Very simple, very tasty, easy clean up.

Delicious - I made it with slightly less herbs than called for because my family is suspicious of too many green things on their meat. Also had to use dried rosemary because the store was out of fresh. Still very tasty - would definitely make again.

This is by far the best beef tenderloin I have tasted. I decided to go with what others recommended and bake at 425 and avoid  searing the roast. I will also try the rub on other types of roasts...it is that good.

Nice flavor. Although i think the rosemary or thyme (not sure which ) made the flavor a little odd. Thus the 4 stars. Next time i will omit one.  Did not make the horseradish sauce but the meat was good with the garlic mixture. Used a meat thermometer and cooked to 135 and it was med rare.

Best dinner I have ever had!  Just use a meat thermometer to cook it to your perfect temperature and make sure you tent it and let it rest after you remove it from the oven.  Better than anything I have ever had in a nice restaurant.  Enjoy!

Amazingly good. And I barely know how to cook! It was really easy to make. I paired it with a big Caesar salad and it made a lovely meal.

Family favorite.  Easy, tender, juicy. I cook mine in a cast iron skillet.   You can deglaze your pan with a little red wine or beef broth if you care for a little gravy.

I followed the recipe without any changes.  Because I was cooking for one with an 8 oz tenderloin I used a meat thermometer to know when to remove the tenderloin from the oven.  The tenderloin was delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

When I saw this recipe, I just knew I had to make it, but I wanted to save it for a special occasion. So, I finally got the chance to make it tonight for my family's Christmas Eve dinner and it was absolutely delicious! The tenderloin itself was juicy and tender with just the right amount of herns and seasonings, and the creamy horseradish sauce complemented the tenderloin perfectly. This is quite possibly the tastiest beef tenderloin I've ever eaten! I will certainly be making this dish as soon as beef tenderloin goes on sale again.

Our go to for roast dinners! My family and friends love this. For the horsey sauce I add a couple dashes of Frank's red hot sauce and Worchestershire also some chopped fresh chives. Roasted baby potatoes green beans and a pan gravy perfecto:)

I just made this for Christmas dinner. It was fantastic! My 4 year old that doesn't like much more than PB&J ate this up and my husband that doesn't like horseradish, loved the sauce. It was a definate hit. I'll definately be making this again.
