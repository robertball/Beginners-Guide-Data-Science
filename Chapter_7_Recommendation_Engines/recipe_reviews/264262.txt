I made this recipe for my husband, who is on the keto diet. I used almond flour instead of coconut, and misread the recipe and used 3 oz. of cream cheese instead of 3 TBS. He said they were great, and asked me to make them again. Yay!

As the recipe is written, these were just ok..  I topped half of them with nuts and those were better
