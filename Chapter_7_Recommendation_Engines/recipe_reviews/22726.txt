This is kind of an aquired taste, but I love it.  I salt the rim of the glass instead of adding it to the drink.

OK, I know what I made was not "salty"....but it was good. Using the recipe here, I skipped the salt, and added in 3/4 oz triple sec. Smooths out the grapefruit bitterness, and is very refreshing.

I never needed any salt with mine. This has been my favorite drink since before I found out it was called a "Salty Dog" - I just asked for a gin & grapefruit.

Honey, let me be your salty dog!  One of my all time favorite drinks.  Rarely add the salt but it's good either way.

Not bad. I'd use margarita salt next time, rather than salting the drink. Ahoy!

Love salty dogs! But I prefer to salt the rim of the glass, margarita-style. A salty dog without the salt? I don't think so. And use a good gin, like Tanqueray.
