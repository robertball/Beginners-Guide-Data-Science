I have made this before and it is a hit with my kid!  It's better than having to buy or borrow a spring form pan and waiting for an hour or so for a cake to bake and then chill.  What's best is, you can decorate your own way and have a different cheesecake every time!

I had high hopes for this recipe since the reviews seemed to be so high.  The recipe was very easy to put together and cooked in exactly the 20 minutes that the recipe stated.   We were not a fan of the texture of this recipe.  I was expecting more of a cheescake texture and they were more cakey.   It is possible part of this was because of the vanilla wafer crust that baked into the filling.

Cheesecakes don't get much easier than these. I did crush the vanilla wafer. These turned out perfect.

Amazingly easy to make!  They have a very mild cream cheese taste and I prefer my cheesecake just a touch more on the richer side.  I made a raspberry topping for them and they looked great!

These were really easy to make. They came out creamy and tasted perfect with a nice fruit topping.

I really liked how simple these were to make. If I made them again I might cut back the lemon juice a bit for personal preference. I have never cared for the cookie in the bottom as the crust, but boy it sure speeds up the time and mess to make them. Although, I probably wouldn't make these at home just to eat, they would be great for a party solely for their ease. Someone mentioned that the foil cups were the best to use for baking. I thought they worked well and the cheesecakes were evenly cooked. They come with both a paper and foil liner which makes the cheesecake batter more stable. When they were done I took the wrapped cheesecake and put them each in a Halloween paper wrapper for decoration and topped with whipped cream and fall colored chocolate candies. I liked that they weren't overly sweet tasting too.

Very good and super simple to make too! I wanted them to have a Halloween theme, so I tinted the batter orange, and spooned them into Halloween cupcake liners (I got exactly 12 out of this). When they were done/chilled, I decorated them with chocolate, sprinkles and sugar decorations. They were a big hit with my family, and that makes them a keep in my book~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
