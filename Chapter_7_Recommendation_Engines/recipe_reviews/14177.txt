I enjoyed this at a friend's BBQ and had to have the recipe! The combination sounds odd, but the end result is fantastic. I served it with grilled andouille sausage and creamy potato gratin. It was a memorable meal thanks to this inspired dish.

I am now using all splenda and no sugar, about 6 or 8 of the little coffee size bags...I some times grate carrots in it... Seems to last for weeks, i.e. I ain't dead yet...I keep it in the frige at all times, I probably use more onions, celery then called for...You can't go wrong..

This recipe is Great with modifications. I followed another's suggestion to use 1/3 cup sugar (white), 1/3 cup oil, 1/3 cup cider vinegar. I also used 3 stalks celery, 1 whole red pepper in place of pimentos, 2 carrots shredded/grated, and 1 onion finely chopped. I think the caraway seed could have been increased a little bit. I might try that next time. Thanks for a new way to prepare sauerkraut!

I thought this was good.  I might decrease the sugar a bit next time, but it really is a delightful change of pace from regular sauerkraut.

Wow, tangy is right! I love sauerkraut, but the cider vinegar seemed to overpower it a little too much. Next time, I'll use a bit less than 1/4 cup.

*edit* I took this to work, everyone raved. Some begged me for the recipe, too. So, although I didn't care for it at first, other people couldn't get enough of it.

I did not know what taste to expect and was pleasantly surprised. I would cut the oil and sugar in half next time and perhaps try fresh shredded cabbage instead of kraut.

This is amazingly good.  Went well with a pork roast and corned beef and cabbage.

The only reason I gave this less than 5 stars is the stated amount of sugar seemed like too much, as others have remarked. I used 1/2 cup and that was plenty.  I didn't have pimento on hand but my bell pepper was red and gave it great color. The 'kraut I used was homemade and already had shredded carrot in it, otherwise I think that would have been tasty addition also. It was a BIG hit at our dinner party with plain pulled pork sandwiches, even though it only marinated for about 4 hours, so don't let that stop you from making it! We will be having this salad again, for sure!
