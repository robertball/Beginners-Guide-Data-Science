The only addition I made to this recipe was to substitute Root Beer for the water.  After cooking, I removed the roast from the sauce mixture and shredded it with 2 forks......then used my immersion blender to "liquefy" the celery, onions, etc.   I removed approx. 1/2 of the liquid to serve as an additional dipping sauce along with the pulled pork.  Returned the shredded pork to the crock pot and heated for add'l 30 min.  Served on toasted Kaiser Buns.......DELICIOUS!!!

It's okay but a lot more difficult than it needs to be. All you really need to do is put your roast in the crock pot, I like to use a pork tenderloin 4 pounds or more, and dump a jar of hot banana   peppers on top. Cook until it's done.  Put it in a very very large bowl and take your hand mixer to it, it'll shred up in a matter of seconds, banana peppers included. Then mix up a blend of your favorite barbecue sauces start with Sweet Baby Ray's and what other sauces you like along with some vinegar and go on from there and don't forget to add the Liquid Smoke that's the key to the whole thing.

This is a perfect cool-weather meal! It was easy to prepare, as I had everything on hand, and it came out perfect for us. Serve with extra barbecue sauce on the side, and chips and cole slaw for an easy meal.

Excellent, excellent!  It was fairly simple to put together, although I made double the amount in the recipe.  The taste was not overpowering, so my son who doesn't like barbeque sauce flavor could still eat it (and it tasted great)!  If you want it saucier, simply add some onto your pork on your sandwich.  Top with coleslaw and you are all set to go!  Fair warning- this gets very soupy during the cooking process so, in order to place it on a roll and not have the bread turn to mush, you need to be sure the meat is drier.  If you are eating it out of a bowl, no sauce problems at all.  One of the best parts of this recipe was the incredible smell it made all through the house, for almost the entire day- superb!

This recipe was so easy and quick to put together before work (no browning of meat!) and it was a very tasty dinner to come home to.  We loved it!  Lots of leftovers in our two person household, so I discovered the even better taste the next day!   As I used a sweet barbecue sauce, it made a very delicious base for wraps the next day.  I just heated the pork and wrap for a few minutes and added a salad greens mix, pea shoots, julienned apple, julienned cucumber, and avocado, no need to add dressing, as there was plenty of flavour in the pork, and wrapped it up.   I added a large salad on the side for more greens, Super delicious!  My son loves the pulled pork!  We have eaten and enjoyed lots, and I still have enough for one more night!  I will make this again!

Really good, simple. I didn't even have to keep it in the cooker for the total 8 hours. It was falling apart by hour 5, and was ready by the 6th hour. Made delicious sandwhiches on brioche rolls. My boyfriend and I loved them. Paired well with a refreshing pasta salad.

This is a very easy meal to prep and cook. I did find it to be a bit bland and added 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp onion powder, and 1 additional tsp of garlic powder. Next time I make it, I think I will add more chili powder as well. Overall a very good meal. Thanks!

I made this with 2- 4lb bone in pork roasts. The ingredients doubled just fine. I followed the directions with the only exception of adding 2 heaping tablespoons of concentrated tomato paste, my family likes that flavor on pork.
The cook time for my crock pot was 6 hours on high. The bones slid right out!  While I cooled the meat to shred, I put the sauce on the stove to reduce, then skimmed some of the fat off. I returned the shredded meat and sauce back to the crock pot on warm. It held nicely until supper time. We add hot sauce at the table to accommodate individual taste preferences.
Thank you for a great simple recipe!

Having read the reviews both before & after making the dish I will tweak the recipe to sub the water for beer/ cider. Worth blitzing the liquid but would want it slightly thicker. All in all, will try it again!

Was a little uncertain about the ingredients but,  followed this recipe as written.  Turned out great and the flavor was just what I was looking for. The liquid as it cooks is thin but, once I drained it I just added a little more barbeque sauce to the pork on a toasted bun from the bottle. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Barbeque Sauce for slow cooking (Hickory & Brown Sugar flavor) This pork is pull apart tender.  When the recommended 7 hr cooking is up test it by using a fork to pull the pork apart.  If it does not pull apart easy just leave it in for additional time.  I added another hour. For sure I will make this again.  By the way, left overs are amazing Enjoy!

Will definitely make this again.  Now whenever we get pulled pork at a restaurant kids always compare to mine and so far Mom's is still the best!  Made essentially per recipe.

I omitted the celery entirely, as I never seem to get any flavor out of cooked celery, and 2 cups seemed a bit excessive to me.  I also added root beer in place of the water, as that's what I use for liquid in my other pulled pork recipes and I like the additional flavor the root beer gives.  The recipe without the celery is great!  The pulled pork was very flavorful.  It will be a go to recipe for me.  Maybe someday I will even be brave enough to add the celery!  Thank you for the recipe.

Great flavor! I cooked the meat on High for 5 hours and the sauce was a bit too watery. Cooking longer and slower would make a thicker sauce. Yes, I would make it a again and use a nice hoagie bun.

This smelled amazing while it cooked all day and tasted just as good. Made with Famous Dave’s sweet and spicy B.B. sauce and served with extra sauce on the side. Drained liquid and served on toasted buns with Cindy’s coleslaw also from this site. Glad it made a lot, plan to make barbecue pizza with some of the leftovers.

Fantastic recipe! Made just as the recipe stated but used less water. Once the post was done I pulled the pork, placed it in a casserole dish and let it sit for a little while. After about 15 minutes I poured some of the sauce over it and let it sit again for another 10 minutes which helped the sauce thicken. Best pulled pork recipe I’ve made to date!

Delicious & so easy! Used a 1.5lb center cut pork  loin roast in a 6qt crock.   4 hours on low,  shredded the meat and cooked in the sauce on low for another 45 minutes.  Was worried while shredding that the meat would be tough but it turned out perfectly tender and very flavorful... don't skip the simmer time after shredding!  Since the roast was smaller we used one medium onion and 3 stalks of celery (about 1c) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I used a teaspoon of salt and 1/2t of pepper "to taste" and it was perfectly seasoned.  A little more effort than just dumping a bottle of bbq sauce over the pork but the 5-10 minutes of prep was worth the great depth of flavor.  We prepped the night before and took the crock out of the fridge about an hour before cooking so it was really effortless.  Saved this recipe for future use and looking forward to enjoying it again!

I read a review that said it was excellent exactly as written so I made no changes.  I had a 3 1/2 pound pork butt and used that and the recipe just as it was written.  It was excellent and my husband, who is very discriminating, also loved it.

One of my favorite go-to recipes when I know my day is filled with errands.   I used the recipe exactly as specified and it is a huge hit with family.   Now that my family has added 2 more, using the adjustable meal preparation amounts has become a huge lifesaver.

This was by far, the best pulled pork ever!!! Next time, I’d probably cut back on the H20 and use more BBQ sauce

Your recipe was great your way,but in the sauce, it would be better if a little bit of brown sugar in the recipe.

I used a Swift Premium petite pork shoulder (already trimmed) and a pork tenderloin to equal 4 pounds. I cut the pork against the grain before adding to crockpot.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. I would not add the water to start. It was a little runny after shredding the pork. There is plenty of liquid and doubt it will be dry. You can always add some water or bbq sauce  if needed after shredding if it is to thick.  Winner.

This was so delicious!  I made it according to the recipe but omitted the onion and celery bc I didn't have it on hand.  The flavor was delicious!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was bc it was very runny.  It would be nice if there was a way to thicken the liquid.

This is a pretty good pulled pork but needs just a little more zip. Couple of dashes of hot sauce were perfect.

This was easy and very good. The only change I made was using chicken breasts instead of pork. That's what I happen to have. I mixed the sauce and veggies then put in 4 large frozen yes frozen chicken breasts because I for got to take them out of the freezer. Worked great! Served them on toasted slider buns with coleslaw. Yum.

FANTASTIC!  Made it as recipe stated, then took 1/2 of meat & put it in another crockpot with a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's  hickory smoked barbecue sauce.  The crowd all wanted the barbecued pork.  Next time will put sauce on all of meat - and there will be a next time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This has great flavour but I find it makes too much liquid since none evaporates in a crock pot.  I will definitely use much less next time, and then add BBQ sauce as needed once I've pulled it.

I went by the directions. Mine was a little bland and just seemed to be missing that ZING! Had to douse my bun in BBQ sauce to get it better. I was too watery. There really isn't any better way than just cooking it in the slow cooker natural with no sauces and stuff then shred it when done and put your own sauce on it. And I don't like the root beer thing either when I tried that it tasted root beer BBQ. I won't make this again.

I made it once and followed the recipe. It was good.
the second time I made it I simply used a pint of Herberts BBQ Sauce and that was all.
I liked the flavor of the Herberts BBQ sauce, available in Texas sold by HEB Grocery.
I will use it next in Tamales and will send in an update.
