I've used this and similar recipes for several years. The only additional suggestion I would make is to drop a quartered onion and 3 or four cloves of crushed garlic into the water prior to broiling the ribs. That seems to "punch up" the flavor of the ribs quite a bit.

Today's pork is mostly pre-tenderized and it is unnecessary time or flavor-wise to par-boil ribs. Flavor is better if you put in oven, uncovered for 20 minutes, then add BBQ sauce and finish for 10-15 more, let rest 10 before eating.  It still falls off bone.

I usually don't have luck when preparing ribs, but these turned out well.  I added a little extra sugar to make the sauce not quite as tangy.  I will  try the sauce with chicken also.  Overall, a good recipe.

A really superb and easy recipe. My wife is VERY particular about the taste and tenderness of her ribs and this recipe satisfied even her. The sauce SEEMS like just another ordinary one but I can assure you that the flavor is really first rate. THIS will be our rib recipe from now on. By the way, we agree that it needs a bit more brown sugar.

This recipe was okay. I think the sauce tasted a little too much like ketchup and I would rather have used garlic then onions, the onions were a little overwhelming. To tweek the recipe, I would use less ketchup, more vinegar and brown sugar/mustard and add a little worcestershire sauce.

This is my first time making ribs. The flavour was delicious. However, I think the oven temp. is too low. Sauce took forever to carmelize. I had my guests in a holding pattern for 45 minutes longer than the time I had planned to serve dinner. Will make again with a higher oven temp.

My initial thought was that it was just a mediocre recipe, would probably make it again but nothing to rave about...  Put the left overs in the fridge and just had it, two days later - it seems to improve with standing!  It was finger-licking good!!!

This recipe is great - I always have the ingredients at hand and it's so easy and tastes fantastic. I forgot the lemon juice and had to squeeze a lemon over at the end, I think it would have been too sweet without that. Also, I could only find individual ribs so I didn't bother boiling them first, the meat was tender after being cooked in the sauce anyway.

Very good.  I added about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire to the sauce and covered the pan with foil while the ribs were baking.  My whole family loved this dish.

GREAT Ribs.  Had to midify the recipe a bit as I didn't have a couple items on hand.  Substituted cider vinegar with 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 rice vinegar.  Also wasn't able to add the lemon juice right away (until Hubby brought some home!!) so I added more rice vinegar and then added the lemon about 1/2 way through cooking.  
Everyone loved it.  Definately do again.

The best instructions, but I kind of cheated.  I bought boneless pork ribs and followed the instructions with boiling and baking.  I used the bottled Barbeque Sauce, and they still came out mouth watering.  This is the best recipe I found on all recipes besides the punch I found for my Wedding Shower.

Thanks for a very simple and tasty recipe.  This is just the sort of rib recipe I have been looking for.  I live in Portugal all winter where we have wonderful pork and this will fill the bill.

I've collected a lot of rib recipes, always trying to find that an even better one. Based on the comments, I thought this one was going to be one to treasure. Sorry to say, I won't make it again. The sauce, which is the main feature of the recipe, was just average.

Very good!  The family liked it alot.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I thought the pepper called for was way too much.  I'll cut the pepper in half when I make it again.

I liked the sauce as a base for another sauce. I added raspberry jam, orange juice and sugar to perfect it. I also substituted the Onion for about 1 1/2 T. of Dried Onions. My family said WOW!!

Tastes like real barbecue sauce and uses things I keep on hand so I don't need to go to the store.  Everyone loves it and friends ask for the recipe.

Great!  My first attempt at cooking ribs and I couldn't have been more satisfied.  We're a "rib-loving" family so the pressure was on, but my kids and husband loved the sauce--husband couldn't believe the sauce wasn't out of a bottle.  Wouldn't change a thing except make more ribs next time!

I have tried many bbq recipes but this one really rocks! I added a couple chopped red chillies and my housemate and I literally fought over the last mouth-watering bone.

Even my husband who doesn't like pork thought this recipe was a real winner. A great recipe for family dinners as well as for dinner guests.

These ribs were pretty tasty but a little tangy for my taste. The meat was very tender and fell off of the bone. I'm going to try them again using a jar of barbeque sauce. I think they will be great!

I think this recipe  would be better
if a little more brown sugar was
added.

Excellent! I added water to the sauce as it thickened to avoid burning. It worked very well.
