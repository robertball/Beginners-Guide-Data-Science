Good recipe for tweaking a little - I used all green pepper and chopped up a fresh tomato because I didn't have Mexican stewed, and used more rice.  Next time I'd like to try it with the right tomatoes, to get a little more sauce for the rice, but it was very good!  Great side dish for fajitas.

My daughter is starting to help out with the cooking and this is the recipe she chose for dinner yesterday.  It was very good and made a large amount.  The only change I would suggest is making more rice for the amount of the bean medley...maybe 1 1/2 cups.  Otherwise it was perfect and very quick and easy.

It's pretty much what you might expect from any "Mexican Rice"-style dish.  Easy to make, and a hit with the 8-year-old.  The adults added a bit of hot sauce.

As written, this is a great vegetarian recipe combining brown rice and black beans to create a complete protein.  Since we are not vegetarian and my husband likes some meat with his supper, I sliced two boneless, skinless chicken breasts into strips, seasoned them with some chili powder, cumin, cilantro, salt & pepper, and sauteed them before I added the onions and peppers, etc.  I also used seasoned black beans to give it a bit more flavor, and added more of the above seasonings when I added the corn.  We topped it all off with a bit of shredded Mexican cheese blend and a dollop of low-fat sour cream.  My husband and I agreed that the sweet flavors of the corn and the Mexican diced tomatoes combined very well with the spicy black beans, onions, garlic, and seasonings.

My parents wanted to try new foods and this dish was my contribution and it was well liked.  This is a great tasting recipe.  It is hard to transport so just make sure you have a large bowl and keep the rice seperate or just cook the rice at the location.

I tried this with the submitter's suggestion of using salsa instead of tomatoes, b/c I don't like stewed tomatoes.  I just used a basic, mild salsa (one I normally buy & enjoy with tortilla chips)...and it was horrible.  Maybe the stewed tomatoes give it a different flavor?  It was easy to prepare, and I liked the base of corn, beans, peppers, onions, & garlic.  If (and it's a BIG "if") I do this again, I will try to season it myself.  Maybe some cumin & cayenne or crushed red pepper?  And like another reviewer suggested - fresh tomato.

We really liked this.  I used regular long grain white rice.  I had no red pepper and didn't have nearly as much green pepper which is okay with me since we're not big pepper fans.  I used canned corn which I put in the last 5 minutes or so so it wouldn't get soggy.  I added a small amount of cumin.  Very yummy, servd as a side dish with chix drumsticks.  Could be a whole meal, really.

I tripled this recipe to take to a dinner, then ended up not going, so I had oodles.  I gave several servings to several friends, and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

This was great! I didn't have mexican stewed tomatoes, so I just used regular stewed tomatoes and added a packet of taco sauce. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written and it's delish! We ate it as a filling in soft tortilla shells and my whole family loved it! A definite keeper!

This is a wonderful dish.  I often make this the day after taco night using the leftover beans and taco meat (In my case I use veggie crumbles).  The only other change I made to the recipe was using whatever can tomatoes I have around and adding 1 tsb of cumin for added flavor.
