I used to work for Arctic Circle before they automated everything; we made the secret fry sauce from scratch back then.

This is almost it!  For the restaurant, we would've omitted the pepper; added a little paprika, and a little mustard.

Tasty and easy sauce to perk up burgers!  I meant to buy dill pickle relish specifically for this recipe, but picked up sweet relish instead - it was still delicious!  In fact I don't even like sweet relish, but at least I've found a use for it now.  Not so sure where the review about "too much garlic" came from - I found the garlic powder to be very subtle.  Perhaps fresh garlic would have been overpowering, but as stated this recipe is a nice blend of simple ingredients that results in a very nice new condiment! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very similar to McDonald's Big Mac 
sauce. I made this last weekend and
slathered it on hamburgers we'd 
barbequed. Nice change from your 
typical ketchup/mustard/mayo. I added
a little Tabasco for a little kick.

Would use again.

A good burger sauce, I used relish for the chopped pickles.  I've tried this one and Best Burger Sauce from this site and I have to say Best Burger sauce has a much better flavor.

After we made this last night I thought to myself... 'I know this taste'. After thinking about it I realized it's Thousand Island Dressing! I see I'm not the only person who's figured this out. I mean it taste's fine. But if your not a fan of that dressing, dont make this.

I thought this was great. I made half of the recipe in the morning, for dinner that night. I did add a sguirt of mustard to it as some suggested, you can taste the difference between this and store bought 1000 Island Dressing. Very good recipe.

I made a small batch of this tonight just for dipping oven fries.  It was really good, and my husband who always uses mayo and ketchup for his fries was really impressed.  I can't wait to try this on a burger!

A nice alternative to ketchup!  Had company and wanted to make the burgers special and this worked.  I halved the recipe and chopped the dill pickles very fine (kids don't like chunks).  Very good...will use again this summer for our many bbq's.  Thanks for the recipe

Delicious as a spread or a dipping sauce! We served it on Chicken Sandwiches and also as a dip for our potatoes. This tastes just like In'N'Out!

Not bad but with some modification it could be better.  There's too much garlic powder and its aftertaste is off-putting. It also could benefit from a little sweetness, maybe substituting some sweet pickle relish for part of the dill pickle.  It was better once on the burger but Iâ€™m not likely to make this again.

YUM! I just eyed it (same amount of mayo as dill pickle, then half ketchup etc) I think I made about a half a recipe.  We used it to top 3 burgers and the only downside is that I wish I had more! Great recipe, thank you!

This is a classic burger sauce from the famous chain that is now a part of history.  No need for the black pepper, but that's personal preference.  If you don't want to go to the time of chopping the pickles, a nice relish will do perfectly.  You can't go wrong, and will never buy it from a bottle again.

Just like McD's secret sauce.  Made this for a grilling party, and it was devoured!  My bf even asked me why I had not made this before, and requested it for EVERY time we have burgers.  Will definitely be making this often!

I do this a lot myself.I will use mustard and mayo with garlic powder,sometimes cumin,basil,thyme, red pepper,basicly a variety of seasonings can be added to enhance the flavors.Ketchup,mustard,and mayo works good together with a variety of seasonings to spice it up.It's funny how something so simple can be so good!

Wow, this sauce is the reason I make burgers! The only change I make is to use 1 clove fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I also pat the chopped dill pickles dry with a paper towel so it doesn't get so runny!

Very tasty  I did alter as per my taste and others suggestions.  Doubled the mayo and ketchp and pickles.  Added less garlic powder and black pepper than called for.  Also added cayenne pepper and a splash of white vinegar.   Willl make again and again!

A bit of paprika, mustard and hot dog relish instead of pickles makes this the best sauce for our family.  We use it for burgers, chicken fingers and fries!

I made the recipe exact. Fresh pickles and all. Its got potential. I had to revive my tomato and garlic paste by doubling the ketchup and mayo. It still tastes like garlic. Careful with your garlic!

Good sauce! Add fresh minced garlic if you like a little  stronger garlic flavor! Also added paprika instead of pepper as one review suggested. Everyone who's put it on their burgers loved it.

I made this just expecting it to taste like mixed sauces, but it's better than the sum of it's parts! It made an absolutely fantastic flavour and went fantastically on our vegan teff-burgers.

I used about 1/4 cup garlic mayo (left from another recipe) + 1/4 cup regular mayo.  Other than that, I followed as written.  So yummy!  Hubby made a grilled ceese with it.  Told me that it was a 10 star recipe and we needed to keep a batch in the fridge at all times!

This is a good sauce, the only change I make is to reduce the pickles by 1/2 and add 1 tablespoon of fresh minced onions, then let it meld in the fridge a bit. Thanks for the recipe.

Does taste like thousand island dressing.  Still good though. BTW for fries I prefer tartar sauce to dip them in instead of ketchup.

I personally enjoyed this sauce on my burger, it was a nice change from the usual. Reminds me of thousand island dressing. I did use sweet relish instead of pickles.

I like garlic, but it was a little too prevalent here. I think I will sub half onion powder next time and maybe add a little mustard as well. I liked it though!

I didn't use the garlic powder because I was out, ignored the pepper, but I added a tiny bit of mustard as suggested and followed the rest of the recipe with dill relish in the place of chopped pickles (lazy!). Right after stirring, it tasted a little bland, but after about an hour it tasted so much better and I plan on making it again. 

Definitely make it well before your food is ready. It's very similar to popular special sauces in fast food restaurants.

I've been making a sauce like this for a long time! This recipe is just what I like- a good balance of creamy and tangy. I didn't add chopped pickles to the sauce but I put sliced pickles on the burger and covered them with sauce. Quick, easy and great tasting!

I just made this and its very similar to A&W mozza burgar sauce. I used sweet pickle relish and used 1/4 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of miracle whip, replaced the ketchup with chili sauce. I also used a little less garlic powder but still added the pepper. Absolutely delish!!!!!

Made a batch this weekend exactly as written and we loved it.  It tasted great on burgers and we've enjoyed it with fried zucchini chips, fish sticks, and as a dip for pretzels.  This is a keeper for sure.

Really does taste like In 'n' Out sauce! We moved to Texas from California, and the one thing we do miss about Cali is In 'n' Out but now I feel like we can almost recreate it at home thanks to this recipe.

We've been using this recipe in Quebec for years.  It is very good and tasty.  I use it mostly for dips.  If you do not have all the ingredients, just mix in ketchup and mayo together.  For a sweet dip add a FEW drops of maple syrop.  Makes a quick good dip!!!!

We've made this like McD's would. Added fresh onions, made the patties really thin and few pickles. Smell and taste like McD's. Next time will butter the buns for a greasier meal. Delicious!

This was good, but as others stated, it was more like Thousand Island dressing.  I used pickle relish instead of pickles, and did add 1 Tbl. mustard, and that helped some, but I think I will keep looking for the recipe I had in mind.

This rocks.  Used sweet pickle relish because that's all I had.  This will become a regular addition to my burgers.  Thank you for sharing!

This is an honorable attempt to decipher McDonalds' "secret sauce", but the secret is; it's actually thousand-island dressing.  That's it.  Just thousand-island.

This is a copycat of McD's special sauce on the BigMac burgers. Almost identical. I used sweet pickle relish. I had made several different burger sauces and we had a taste test, this was the winner. Thanks Soifua, this burger sauce rocks!

Wow!  This was so good!  I used some baby dills that I put through my food processor to chop up and kept all the measurements the same.  Yum!  I can't wait to make this again and use it for all sorts of burgers, fries, etc.

Definitely too much garlic.  We love garlic, especially my husband who puts extra garlic on everything and after a while this was way too much.  Next time if I make this again, I will probably only use maybe half the garlic.  Otherwise this would probably be good.

We thoroughly enjoyed it! I made one change that made this taste exactly like zaxby's "zax sauce" I added a few squirts of siracha! It was really really good even without the siracha.we used it for French fries as well as burgers!

The best! I also use green pickle relish instead of pickles, as I did not have pickles the first time I made it. (I also only use about 1/4 cup)Delish! Always requested at BBQ â€˜s. Thank you for the recipe! Itâ€™s a hit with everyone.

This makes a great burger sauce!  This is similar to another recipe that I make, but this one is a little less sweet.  I did use sweet relish in place of the chopped dill pickles.  I also added in some finely minced onion.  It does taste better when it marinates an hour or two in the fridge.  It spruces up any ordinary burger!  Thank you for the recipe!

This wasn't a bad sauce, but "Best Burger Sauce" on this site is far better. If you make it, I'd suggest following other reviewers' advice: swap the pepper for paprika and add a bit of mustard.

I tried this recipe the other night on some burgers we just got with our beef order. I was just about done trying to make the perfect burger when this came along. I must say it has renewed my interest in continuing my search for a better burger. This is one of them. The dill pickles in this recipe is a must and just enough ketchup to turn the color pink and then just a dab more. Good stuff. When I was growing up we had a place called Gino's that made the Gino giant with a sauce like this. It really took me back.

This recipe is easier than a dallas cowboy cheerleader after a 12 pack! I didn't use regular ketchup. I used jalapeno ketchup by heinz and deleted the black pepper. I also used a 1/4 teaspoon of minced garlic instead of garlic powder I didn't have any powder. I also put the chopped pickles on a napkin to dry. Boars head pickle chopped. Now for the burgers I used 90/10 hamburger with 1 tablespoon of A1, 1/2 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. Then I put the burgers in a 6 count muffin pan for 30 mins at 350. We like our burgers a little rare. Everybody on this holiday weekend loved it!!

This was just ok for me, too much pickle flavour, although I'm not a huge pickle fan anyway. May try again but decrease the pickles by half.

Great spread!!  You can really load up with this, and take nothing away from the rest of your burger.  I mixed it a couple of hours before and let it meld and chill in the fridge.  My wife loved it as well.

Very easy to make with ingredients we usually have on hand and quite tasty too for a change from the regular ketchup and mayo. Keep in mind that it makes a lot. Thanks for the recipe!

Hus-b and I thought this was pretty good, but felt like it was missing something. I used sweet pickle relish since that's what I had on hand. I will have to play around with this recipe a little.

We really liked this for something different from the usual ketchup and mustard. I made it earlier in the day to allow the flavors to blend in the fridge. I also used sweet pickle relish instead of dill pickle, but will try the dill pickle next time. I will definately make this again! Thanks for posting. :)

This was good but I was hoping it would taste like the sauce on the Big Mac. Still good but like another reviewer said it reminded me more of a Thousand Island dressing.

We really enoyed this recipe.  Added a little extra dill pickle.  The contrast between the sweet flavor of the mayo and ketchup with the pickle was excellent!  We liked it so much so, that during dinner I got up and put some in a bowl to dip our hamburgers that already had some on them.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Soifua this was incredible! I knew I was low on ketchup so I adjusted everything to match what I had on hand and it was perfect. My only goof was that I used sweet pickles but it still tasted great. I will use dill nest time and it will taste just like it supposed to. But this was perfect and I will make sure I always have some in the fridge!

This was very tasty, just like the sauce on a Big Mac. I added a bit of mustard and paprika, like a previous reviewer suggested, and served it with Cheeseburger Pancakes, which is also excellent.

I really like the sauce but am only giving 4 stars because I thought it needed some sugar.  Maybe next time I will try it with salad dressing and not regular mayo.  Very good, am enjoying it with the skinny fries  from this site.

I will never make burgers without this again! I ususally don't care for pickles on my burgers so I was hesitant with this one but it all blended together nicely for a great taste. So simple, easy and quick!

So Good! I originally made this sauce to put on our burgers and have since dipped pretzels, fries, celery and carrots into it.

Yum! This was good! I didnt have any dill pickles, so I had to use relish. Very good, next time I'll use the dills and I know it'll be even better!

Just made this for grilling burgers tomorrow night. I decided to sample it before putting in the fridge.  I dipped some cocktail shrimp in the sauce...very good!! Looking forward to having it on the burgers tomorrow!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Soifua!
