I thought this recipe was great.  In fact, I cooked it twice in one week; the second time over chicken.  The marinade was tangy and I loved the texture of the salsa topping.  The ingredients are a little expensive, but once you buy the two bottles of liquor, you may use them again and again for this recipe, or cocktails, hehe.  For the reviewer that stated that the fish was dry, you shouldn't marinate it for longer than the recipe states (and then give a bad review).  Fruit juices and/or liquor are known to "cook up" fish, such as ceviche.

This has become a weekly favorite.
I live in rural Mo, having moved here from southern Ca. Adding variety to the standard fried-meat-and-potatoes local fare can be challenging.
This recipe fits the bill. You'll never see a grouper in any of *our* local grocerey stores, but we do occasionally get talapia (sp) and that works well.
We also also use it on bonless chicken breasts and its wonderful!
 
Its a great meal on a hot day, because its light and the chilled salsa sets it off.

We used Sea Bass and this recipe was AWESOME!!!!  Like others, we dod not have Orange Liquer, and skipped it (based on the feedback to NOT use OJ - which we were going to). We also baked at 350 deg for about 25 minutes.  We personally liked it better with the salsa.  This was sooooooeasy and so darn good - gourmet with 5 stars!!!!

The only fish I normaly eat is sushi because I don't like cooked fish that much. But I have to say this is the best ever. I substituted Red Snapper and Scallions for the cilantro. All I can say is WOW!!

Made this, but omitted the salsa.....was EXCELLENT.  My husband said it tasted like it was from a restaurant. I also basted it with a little butter on the grill. The person that gave it a bad review must have marinated it too long, fish will "cook" itself if left in any citric acid for too long.  They said they did it the night before........good lord that would've turned it to mush or ruined it!

I used some fresh amberjack from our trip to Islamorada.  This was a big hit and we will serve it again.  Have shared this with others.  Served grilled corn on the cob from my freezer full of local produce.  With a salad with key lime vinaigrette, AWESOME!!

I made this recipe for about 30 people and turned even the biggest "seafood hater" into a fan!  I left out the cilantro and don't feel the recipe suffered without it.  I would advise making a little extra marinade since it adds so much flavor and keeps the fish and the salsa moist and flavorful. Thanks Bill, for a recipe worthy of even the best cookbook!!!!

This is excellent.  2nd time I've made it.  This time I used Grand Marnier, organge roughy, red onion, fresh tomato and basal from the garden.  It is now part of my recipes. Make this, you won't be disapointed.

This was a very tasty fish dish. It was like something you would get at a restaurant. Did not use the orange liquer as I didn't have any. I think the salsa was a lot, so next time I might scale it down.

Truly a restaurant quality dish.  The reduced sauce is delicious and really adds to the flavor.  Used rockfish fillets... A good fish with enough taste to work well with the salsa and sauce.  Family gave it 5 forks, the best I can get.

EXCELLENT.  I somehow 'forgot' to cook and use the marinade but, even without, the fish tasted amazing.  I'll definitely do the cooked marinade next time.

Love this recipe!  Have made it many times, but I've always added a chopped avocado to the salsa - makes it even better!

Amazing. We used some Rockfish that we had frozen, but this sauce would be good on any light fish or even chicken. YUM! YUM! YUM!

This was absolutely delicious!!! It did taste like a restaurant meal.  We served the marinade & salsa on the side because we weren't sure of how it would taste.  I only used 1/2 of a pepper & it was plenty hot enough.  I've been telling everyone about the recipe, can't wait to serve it to company.

I was SO disappointed with this recipe!!  From all the great reviews, I had my expectations set high.  It was expensive to make.  I used Mahi-mahi & soaked it in Jose Cuervo tequila & Grand Marnier the night before.  The fish turned out dry & the salsa was gross with it.  It was so bad I couldn't even finish it.  So disappointing.

This looked and smelled fabulous, but I botched it... my own fault! I decided to use orange juice instead of the orange liquer as I didn't have any on hand and it seems expensive just to try one recipe.  If you're thinking about doing that, DON'T! It makes the final product *way* too citrusy. Like eating fish shaped orange! LOL But that was MY fault, not the recipes.  Next time I'll try it with the liquer. Hopefully by posting this I'll save someone from making the same mistake :) BTW other than my goof, it seemed to work quite well with mahi mahi.

Fantasic. Would not change a thing. Side note: The "Red Grouper" fillets I brought back from FL. were approx 1.3 lbs each and not a 6oz fillet as called for in the recipe.

Great! Great! Great! I actually made a big substitution, though - I used swai instead of grouper. The fish guy at the supermarket had no idea what grouper was, so couldn't recommend an alternative. Swai was on sale, so I took a chance! My wife couldn't stop talking about how good the dinner was.

I have used this recipe with red grouper, red drum (redfish), and black drum. It turns out to be pretty labor intensive and the liquor ups the price of all of the ingredients. The grouper was purchased fresh and I followed the recipe exactly. The result of an afternoon of cubra libras and prepping the dish was a wonderful meal. Truly excellent with rice and an Asian vegetable dish. I caught the red drum and black drum on separate occasions and had great afternoons prepping them as I did the grouper and they were also fantastic. Follow the recipe, use fresh fish, fresh salsa, and enjoy!

I liked the marinade, but I didn't like the grouper. I'll try this again with tilapia. I'll probably reduce the triple sec, too--it was a bit too sweet.

Most of the reviewers are correct - this is a winner.  I'm surprised by the people who would use Grand Marnier in a recipe with a the name 'Margarita'. Who uses GM for this drink?? Triple Sec or Cointreaux are much more suitable and have the right flavor. Husband was wild about this dish. I'm not a great Grouper fan-bland, boring tasting fish very popular(and expensive)here in S.W FL. Very tasty and easy and may make it again,however, I tend to search out new and different dishes all the time, so . . .

I would have suggested marinating this longer for more flavor.  I also used Captain Morgan's spiced rum which cut through the tartness of the lime juice and worked well.

This is quite good! I used mahi-mahi and had to place in the broiler due to the change in weather. The next time I plan to follow the previous reviews and grill. I believe that by cooking it this way will seriously put this recipe over the top.

Excellent! just love it! the sauce gives it the perfect sour/tart flavor to the fish, while the salsa gives it that clean tast but still  at the sametime flavorful.

This was very good, but not GREAT.  It was  expensive to make, of course, so I guess my expectations were pretty high.  I added grilled corn to the salsa per other reviews, and that was a MUST for this recipe, imho.

Pretty good, but the taste of triple sec is just too strong for my buds, maybe use 1/2 of the amount unless you like the stuff, but all i could taste was the orange flavor of it. The fish alone though without the boiled topping on it is pretty awesome.

No..."Awesome" does NOT do this recipe justice!  The words "Frigging Incredible" sums it up for me!  All the flavors just melt together.  The marinade is just unbelievable!  This has gone into my FAVORITE list!  The only thing I did different...I broiled it instead of grilling.  4 to 5 minutes each side.  I only did that because the weather was so bad outside.  Thank you, thank you for putting this recipe together, Bill!  My apron is fluttering!  LOL!

This was great.  We couldn't find grouper so we used Mahi Mahi.  It worked great.  Didn't change anything else.  Thanks for a great fish recipe.

It was absolutely fantastic!  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the marinade.  It really was a winner of a recipe.

I use this website all the time and this is absolutely the best recipe I've tried. My only change was grouper instead of sea bass.  Next time I will add more jalepeno for a bit more kick to the salsa.  Be sure to make the Cuervo Especial Oasis cocktail.  It really complements this dish.

Very tasty!  I used tilapia because that is what I had on hand and the marinade turned out good and tasted great with the fresh salsa.  Also served with avocado slices, fideos and margaritas!  A delicious dinner!

Hmm.  I marinated the fish (tilapia) for about 40 minutes and you couldn't taste the marinade at all.  It was good, and the salsa was fantastic, but it was a bummer about the marinade.  Buying a bottle of Grand Marnier and good Tequila isn't cheap and so having it not really soak in was sad.  I added a little bit of salt and pepper to the salsa and snacked on it while I was waiting for the fish to grill.  My guests liked that quite a bit!  :) Overall, good, not amazing.

The marinade/salsa combo is a subtle yet exciting flavor. We took the wonderful suggestion of grilling corn, then shaved the corn and added it to the salsa. We doubled the cilantro in the salsa and then scooped a double helping of the marinade in to the result. The excess salsa looks beautiful, and even if your guests don't eat it all, it really makes a good impression. Maybe sop it up with some japapeno cheddar bread (yum).

We make this with fresh Ahi tuna and sub in a green chili for the jalapeno. The cilantro makes it fresh tasting and amazing. The sauce is also great when poured over rice. A staple in this house.

This was really good and simple to make. I used mahi mahi and  I ran out of lime juice so I mixed in some lemon juice and it turned out perfect.  The onion tomato mixture really adds a nice flavor.  My husband thought this was great and asked me to make it again!!!! Great recipe!!

This was made a fantastic dinner, very light and summery.  We used mahi-mahi, and it turned out perfect.  It was very flavorful. The "pico de gallo" was yummy slightly warmed by  the margarita.

The only thing I did differently was I used Chilean Sea Bass - I couldn't find grouper. It was so delicious.  The salsa was pretty spicy - and I like spicy - but next time, I think I will use half a jalapeno.  Other than the change in fish, I followed everything to a 'T'.  Highly recommended.   Thanks!

I loved it!!  My whole family loved this recipe.  We used mahi-mahi instead of grouper and it was fantastic.  We scaled the salsa down to 1 tomato and it was plenty.  We used the salsa on fajitas the next night!!  I am sure red onion would have been great in the salsa.  Excellent recipe, I will definitely cook this recipe again.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It's unique and flavorful.  I didn't have tequila on hand, so I used vodka.  I also didn't have orange liqeur, so I used orange juice.  I'll definitely make this recipe again- - maybe even for company.

I thought this was delicious!  Very simple, very tasty and makes a great presentation for company!  I made it for Mother's Day & all the girls raved about it.  I marinated the Grouper overnight.  For the salsa, I omitted the onions and cilantro (we don't like either) and substituted chopped scallions and fresh parsley.  I let that refrigerate overnight, too and it complemented the fish wonderfully!  I can't wait to try this marinade with other fish.  Served with real Margaritas, some grilled asparagus (recipe also from this website) and lemon pepper rice.  Try this...it is so light and easy, but FULL of flavor!

This was very good. I also had talapia on hand and used it. Very good flavor. I didn't even add the salsa, it didn't need it! A keeper.

If I could give this one 8 stars I would! I used Halibut since that's what we have the most of. My husband likes halibut and chips the most, so I was a little worried about 'ruening' it. But we both love Mexican food so I gave it a try. We totally loved this recipe! I marinated the fish for 3 hours, boiled and served the sauce over it all. The pico de gallo was a perfect compliment to the fish. We also grilled corn and summer squash. I can't wait to make this again! Much healthier than fish and chips too. Thank you Bill!

Great summer recipe!  I marinated it overnight and made the salsa 2 hours before serving with no problems.

Execelnt dish! Instead of using lime juice you can substitute a margaritta mix. I suggest Daily's Green Demon. It adds a bit of sweetness. I served it with a grilled corn salsa. It got great reviews with my guests! A perfect summer dish to enjoy outside with good friends!

I really, really enjoyed this...my hubby liked it.  He would give it 3 and 1/2 stars because he felt you couldn't tell it was fish, but I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars.  I am NOT a fish lover (he is), but this was a nice, light, flaky, and tasty dish, which is nice for someone like me trying to incorporate more fish into our diets.  The flavour was light and refreshing and the salsa combined with the flavours of the marinade are absolutely perfect!  I did not change a thing in this recipe, other than to use fresh tilapia from the butcher and I oven-baked at 325 degrees for approx. 15 minutes (these aren't thick cutlets).  If you don't like fish, I highly recommend this dish.  I also feel this is company worthy and very pretty.  (We served with Chef John's Hash Brown recipe, which was really nice with it (and hubby wanted to try).  Would be great with roasted baby potatoes.

After reading so many positive reviews, we thought this was a no-brainer.  Instead we all found it mediocre--a little too salty, and the marinade over-powered the fish instead of bringing out its flavor.   Combining the so-so flavor and the cost of the fish and the Grand Marnier, we were sadly disappointed.   It was simple to prepare and we did serve it up with grilled corn on the cob, margaritas and all but I guess this one just isn't for us.

A couple of issues here. Please don't marinate your fish for 30 mins. in that much lime juice, it starts to turn into ceviche. The beautiful flavor of the marinade is lost if you just drizzle it on the fish, not to mention it gets into everything else on your plate. I would serve it as a dipping sauce and when I tried it that way tonight, it really complimented the pico de gallo and the fish. A really flavorful recipe but I prefer the changes I made. Btw, I tried it exactly as written before changing it up a bit. Thanks Bill! :o)

This recipe was everything I hoped it would be based on the reviews.  I can't wait to try it with different fish and chicken (I used Chilean Sea Bass this time).  Truly a restaurant quality dish - especially because of the double duty marinade to sauce.  Thank you!

We really liked the marinade, but the salsa was horrible. It didn't blend well with the fish at all. I am going to try the marinade with an orange based salsa next time to see if we like it better. I have used the marinade on chicken as well and it tasted fantastic!

I do not like to drink Margarita's. However, I must admit that this recipe was incredibly delicious. The flavor was gourmet. My husband who did enjoy a frozen margarita along with our dinner said it brought out the flavor of the recipe even more. This was so delicious, I am definitely sharing it with many friends! Wonderful!
