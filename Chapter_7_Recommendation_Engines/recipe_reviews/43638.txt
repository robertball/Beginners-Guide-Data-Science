My kids think that this is the magic medicine that, puts you to sleep, heals a hurt, helps you study and signals a cozy chat. My family from New Orleans used to make it and it was called "Orgeat." What I need is a recipe that keeps for the almond syrup. It is costy now that it is used for flavored coffee.

This is extremely yummy - I am a bit of a sweet tooth, so I added a little sugar

Comforting, satisfying, creamy and pleasantly sweet night-time drink. Reminded me of the warm milk and honey Grandma would sometimes give me before bedtime sooooo many years ago.  Mine was a a Sugar-Free Vanilla Dream, however.  I didn't have almond syrup but I did have the sugar-free vanilla. This may just be a repeat during the upcoming winter months.  If not, I'll be sure and keep it in the back of my mind for when I have grandchildren of my own.

Note that almond SYRUP is used, not extract. Toranii or similar coffee syrup works well. I make this with soy or almond milk.

I love the steamers at Starbucks, and tried this recipe. Something about warm milk on the stovetop just doesn't taste the same! Love the almond syrup!

This is also just as good with nonfat milk and sugar free almond coffee syrup.
