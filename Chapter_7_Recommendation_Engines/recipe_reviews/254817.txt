Let me start by saying salmon is not mine and hubby's favorite so we are particular with how it is cooked. With that being said, I did make a couple of changes. I think this recipe would be good as written but we like our salmon with some char on it that the grill brings. So, instead of baking in the oven I did grill it and I added some chili flakes because we like our salmon spicy. I made the butter sauce as directed except that fresh dill is nearly impossible to find in my area so I keep a jar of freeze dried dill on hand at all times. Not quite the same but not too shabby either. The butter sauce /dill combo is excellent and pairs very nicely with salmon. This is an excellent recipe and one I would definitely recommend.

I didn't cook it as long as it as it said, because I like my salmon medium. Other than that it turned out perfect. I used a 2 lb filet to feed my family, served it with a wild rice blend ( which went wonderfully with the butter sauce ) and fresh broccoli . There were no leftovers!

This recipe was amazing! My family actually had seconds if the salmon which is a big surprise because two of my kids donâ€™t like fish. Thank you.

Except for changing out salmon for orange roughy, which I already had in the freezer, I followed the recipe to a T.  We thought the sauce was somewhat bland.  Other than some salt, I don't know what else the sauce needed, but it DID need something else to "lift" the flavors up.  It IS low-carb, so for those watching carbohydrate intake, this recipe is a good choice.  Uncomplicated too and could be easily made on a work night.

I used 4 thick strips of  salmon with no skin. The  marinade baked into the whole piece and was so delicious. I served it over spinach sauteed in oil,butter and garlic. Will definitely make this again!

Here's proof that a great dish doesn't have to be difficult to make. Actually, "great" falls short of describing this "oh, my gosh this is really, really, really good!" Ideal for company because you 1) put it in the oven and set the timer and 2) pull it out of the oven, sprinkle the almonds and bring to the table.

I made it exactly as directed, except I used skinless salmon. My PICKY 7 year old daughter loved it and ate all of it. We were big fans!

This was delicious! My whole family loved it. I used a lot of dill, but it didn't seem to overpower the dish. Also, sealing the dish with aluminum foil kept it from drying out, which usually happens when I cook salmon. I forgot to put on the toasted almonds, but it was still amazing. I'll try it again soon with the almonds.

Easy and good the only change i made was to add some capers. The pan juices are great on a baked potato :)

My husband and I eat salmon all the time so I'm always looking for new ways to make it. This sounded promising because of sauce ingredients.  Very disappointing. My husband said it didn't taste of anything. Not a keeper

In my quest to find a really good salmon recipe, I had high hopes for this one and then only to be disappointed!  Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because my husband said it was okay.
