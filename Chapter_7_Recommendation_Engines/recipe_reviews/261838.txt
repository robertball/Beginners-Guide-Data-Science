Made as written and this turned out pretty good. There is a couple of things I want to mention. The recipe never calls for slicing the sausage links but that is something you will need to do. On that note, I did use the links but next time I will use the ground Italian sausage. Cauliflower is pretty bland and the soup could have used the flavor of the sausage throughout. I used mild sausage because my store didn't have the hot in the links. Because I used the mild, I added some crushed chili flakes to my bowl.  This is a great soup but I do recommend using ground sausage instead.

This soup is amazing! I only puréed half of the cauliflower because I wanted some chunks and used bulk sausage but stuck to the recipe. You won’t be disappointed! Thanks for sharing!

Substituted zucchini for the kale and used kielbasa as that was what I had on hand. It was filling and good, but hubby wasn't a fan of the pureed cauliflower.
