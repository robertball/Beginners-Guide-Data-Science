I followed the recipe to a T and it was a hit! Once I got home, didn't have any leftover ham so just added chopped up mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, etc and it was just as delicious as a veggie quiche ~ the recipe is definitely a keeper!

I didn't like this one. I think  it was the "Bisquick".

I used fresh spinach which took a bit of time to prepare but the rest goes so quick that you could do this even with a mild hangover. Very tasty; I added 4 shakes of habanero sauce,  1/2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce and a generous shake of spicy Mrs. Dash for optimal flavouring.

This was amazing! Normally when I make quiche there is always too much filling, but with this recipe the amount is perfect. I've made this twice now, and the second time I doubled the recipe the and froze one quiche for later. Gave the frozen one to a friend who said it was delicious and not too runny at all! :-) I used leftover Christmas ham, and the second time I made this recipe I did not have as many onions so I used green peppers in addition and it still tasted wonderful!

When making it again, I'll use much less milk.  Mine stayed too wet in the middle.  My spinach probably wasn't as dry as it should be.  Taste is wonderful!  Will definitely make it again.

Made as recipe stated although I only had cheddar cheese so used a full cup. I wondered how it would be with bisquick added in and it actually came out good. Very quick and easy! Hubby is picky about quiche and he loved it too.

Really tasty.  I didn't have Monterey Jack so I used Mozzarella and Cheddar.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. My husband really liked it and went back for seconds and claimed the rest for the next mornings breakfast.  Will be making again.

I made the recipe almost as written.  The only difference is that I made the bisquick mix from a recipe I found online since I already had the ingredients for it handy. I thought it turned out fine.  It was not my most favorite quiche and it was a bit different from the traditional quiche. I think that’s just taste preference.  I think if you are wanting to switch it up from the regular quiche every once in a while this may be one to consider.  I’m not sure if I’ll make it again.

Ok, so I changed a lot, sorry.  I used fresh broccoli and frozen spinach; cooked both before baking. I didn’t have any baking mix so I didn’t use any....  I only used 1cup of milk based on a couple of prior reviews. Definitely overfilled my pie crust that way and didn’t use quite all of the egg mixture but it still tasted delicious. Toddler and husband loved it.

This was very quick and easy. I substituted mushrooms for the ham. Also used fresh spinach. I think it may have helped to soak up excess liquid some have reported. Also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of salt.  Will make again!

I am not a very good cook and it turned out great, as pretty as the picture. The only change I made was the substitution of  orange bell pepper for the onion. My husband tried it reheated in microwave later and he enjoyed it even though he doesn't normally like spinach!

This is super easy to make! I’ve never used Bisquick in my quiche so I’m curious....but so far so good! I did add a full cup of a shredded cheese blend (cause who doesn’t love cheese?) :) Enjoy!

It was very easy to make and very tasty! The only change I will make next time, is to cook the onions just a little bit to soften them.

thank you for the version of Bisquick's Impossible Pie from the 80's..i usually do this with zucchini, but was looking for one with spinach and ham and mushrooms. I use a combo of sauteed onions, mushroom and garlic added to the leftover spiral ham with combo of monterrey jack . The original recipe calls for oil instead of milk, so that's a change. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I wasn't sure about the spinach bottom, and yeah - none of us liked it.  Plus I noticed there was absolutely no seasoning mentioned.  I figured the ham would add salt, so I did add pepper and garlic powder.  I will make this again, but I wanted more crust, so I'll skip the spinach bottom and double the batter to get a truer quiche crust.  Definitely was simple enough!
