Chili aka Heaven Haiku: "Reduced for one pound. Didn't use habaneros, canned chiles instead." I did everything as directed, except reducing my ground beef to one pound, and all the canned ingredients to single cans, as well as swapping a small can of diced chilis for the optional habaneros. (Tender tastebuds at the table, so I usually make chili on the more tame side, and then add Sriracha or Chipotle Tabasco to my bowl.) It could benefit from the addition of some salt and pepper, and as w/ any other chili, it's always fun to garnish w/ whatever's around, colorful and complementary - cilantro, grated cheese, Fritos, green onions, sour cream... Thanks for sharing a little bowl of heavenly chili, Mike!
