The brandy is the key to this recipe!  My step-mother (from Madrid) showed me how to make this.  Use Spanish Rioja wine.  I go a bit heavier with El Presidente brandy and go a bit easier on the fruit juices since that was what I was taught.  I can see where some would prefer a sweeter version but me, I like the juice from the fruit to add their signature flavors, not anything else.  Make sure to let it sit for several hours before serving.  A definite party-maker!!!

I made it for 50 servings & everyone absolutely loved it!!!! No sugar &  used gingerale instead of carbonated water; used rum, not brandy; used peach schnapps, not triple sec. Refrigerated all ingredients night before. Made it early that afternoon & sat container in an ice chest. Added cold gingerale just prior to serving. Sooooo good! Can't wait to have another BBQ to make it again!

This IS the best sangria I have ever had.  Definitely needs to sit at least overnight.  I omitted the sugar and used 7-Up instead of the carbonated water.  FABULOUS!  I made three batches for a recent cookout and it was gone in the first hour.  Thanks for this definite keeper.

A very forgiving recipe! We made this last night for a party, and everyone enjoyed it.  (We made it last for an Easter gathering, with boisterous reviews.)  Last night, one person switched from white wine to the Sangria and never went back! We made three changes because we think we are "Sangria Aficianados."  We omitted the cherries and carbonated water, and added 1/2 cup Peach Schnapps, and substituted diet 7-Up for the water.  Aside from the basic bones of this recipe (the wine, oranges, lemons, limes and specified liqours), many variation work.  Apples and Pears work.  We always add Brandy and Triple Sec and use 7-Up, but if something is not around or we run out, we find substitutes.  I have friends who add dry fruit to their Sangria.  (I think it is sweeter, but tasty.  They used dried mango and pineapple.)  This is really a great ice breaker at a party of friends or acquaintances.

Oh my goodness! This is to die for!  I made it for a backyard BBQ. My only mistake was making only a double batch!  I was shocked to discover that the men would pass on beer for some sangria! Just a tip, it must sit overnight or longer!  Also, don't mix the sprite or soda water.  It doesn't need it.

I will admit that when I first made this recipe and took a sip I wasn't sure I would like it, but letting it sit for approximately 24 hours made all the difference in the world.  The flavors from the sliced fruits really come out after the Sangria sits overnight. I doubled the recipe and it nearly made two quarts. I am not a maraschino cherry fan so I left those out. If you would like, you could add a little club soda to your glass to tone it down for those who cannot handle the stronger flavors of the alcohol.  My husband liked this and thinks I should make it again.  I concur!  Great drink for warmer weather!

I thought this recipe was the most awful thing I have ever tasted.  I go to Mexico every year and this was a far cry from the 'real thing'; absolutely nasty, I definitely do not recommend this!

Awesome....  I was making this for a large group and had a hard time figguring out how much alcohol to buy.  Here is what I bought to make enough to make 5 times the recipe (30 servings).  4L jug of Carlo Rossi Sangria wine,  750 ml bottel of Blackberry Brandy, 750 ml bottel of triple sec, and a couple of 2 liter bottles ginger ale.  I used all the wine and most of the brandy and triple sec.  I added the ginger ale before serving and only used about a 1/2 a bottle (wanted to add more so that it would serve more people but the taste testers said it was great and not to add any more).   I did not use sugar and made it the night before.  I should have made the serving for 60 or even more because it went fast.  Will absolutly make again, and I dont even like wine!!

Definitely the best! I used chianti, ginger ale, and apricot brandy because we like a sweeter Sangria. Hardly a 'far cry from the real thing'- Sangria originated in Spain, not Mexico!
I made 2 recipes, and every drop of it was gone at the end of the party. I'd call that a success :-), Will definitely make again.

Outstanding!  I prepared this to go along side Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a big hit - which is especially noteworthy because about half my guests were of Spanish heritage.  I doubled the recipe and added a lot more fruit than is mentioned above, inlcuding peaches, pineapple, grapes, 4 different frozen berries and Mandarin oranges.  I skipped the carbonated water and used Ginger Ale.

Loved it.  Next time I would chop up the fruit more.  Also I omited the frozen lemonade and added more lemon juice and sugar. I also added a little bit of lemon zest.

I consider myself a Sangria "Critic"  and I can say this recipe is wonderful-perhaps the best I've ever had (move over Olive Garden)! I cut back the lemons and limes by half and removed them  after a few hours vs overnight (otherwise it gets very sour tasting). I have used limeaid (instead of lemonaid-can use either), always use gingerale (vs sugar and tonic water) and **blackberry brandy** (my favorite ingredient so I add about 1/2 C more). This is fabulous anytime of yr and great "on the rocks". My family & friends beg me to make for ALL gatherings now....so I always double the recipe. You will love this recipe even if you don't modify anything...enjoy!!

This recipe was hands down, the best concoction I've ever brought to an event.  I say this for two reasons; one, everyone at the brunch I was at commented on how great it tasted (I eased dropped of course); two, everyone was hammered but giddy!  The only thing that I really did somewhat different...add strawberries with the other fruit.  Also, most important of all is be sure to let the fruit marinate overnight (8hrs) and don't add any soda to it, yet).  I waited until I arrived at the brunch and then added 7-up to it.  This way, it had a little bubble flavor to it and the soda wasn’t flat sitting in the fridge overnight!  The apricot brandy was good additive!  7 gallons of this stuff makes for some really good stories out of people you’ve never met!

great recipe!  no need to use expensive wine-- i used $3 wine from trader joe's.  if you are a lightweight like me, you don't need to put in the brandy nor triple sec.   tasted fine without it.  experiment by putting in different fruit juices, such as cranberry, apple, grape, etc.  sprite, or carbonated fruit sodas are a great addition, too (don't use diet).   i skipped the cherries & didn't miss them.  i recommend making a block of ice in a tupperware & put sliced fruit in there, and put it in the punch bowl.  very pretty.  i also recommend using organic fruits since you will be drinking the juices & oils from the skins.  don't wanna risk any pesticide getting in your drink, as the fruits will be soaking for hours.

Wonderful recipe! The entire batch was gone almost immediately. I cut down on the amount of sugar used and opted to add all of the cherry juice from the maraschino cherries for extra sweetness...yummy! I also decided to add apples as well but found that it is best to add them right before serving so that they do not soak up all of the alcohol (they were pretty potent the first time I made this recipe and allowed the apples to soak overnight). By far the BEST Sangria recipe I have come across. Thanks for sharing!!

I've made 3 other Sangria recipes and this is by far the best. For the triple sec I use Cointreau but I think any triple sec would be just as good. I just happen to keep Cointreau in stock. For the brandy I use Wild Cherry brandy. I omit the sugar completely. I mix it all up, then let it sit for about 18 - 24 hours. Then I take a glass, fill it with ice cubes, fill about 1/3 to 1/2 of the glass with Club Soda, then top it with the Sangria. Oh My Goodness...it is the best! I would have never thought that using club soda would be my preference, but it most definitely IS.  I made a triple batch for the Fourth of July (only 4 of us total) and I had to make another triple batch the morning of the second day, or we would have run out.  Try this recipe exactly as it is written, and then you can easily make any adjustments you prefer. However be forewarned, you need to plan ahead a wee bit, because if you let it sit over night, or even 4-6 hours, it is much much better. Everything seeps and melds together and mixes just wonderfully.I think that is the secret to this particular Sangria recipe.

Excellent recipe! It was a huge success at my son's graduation party! I used a low cost merlot and cherry brandy, skipped the sugar and offered seltzer on the side for anyone who wanted to add it. I quadrupled the recipe so I would have enough to last the entire gathering...which I didn't! Many asked for the recipe before departing the event. I have made it since using apricot brandy, which was also wonderful. I will caution you that if you have left-overs, remove the fruit. If it sits more than a day, the skin's give it a bitter aftertaste.  An excellent summer-time offering! Thanks for the recipe!

People who snub this recipe as inauthentic are right ...real sangria is the cheapest booze, mixed with half-rotten fruit, intended to get you drunk cheap. Add a bunch of sugar to hide awfulness, and serve cold and fast to get the party started!

American sangria recipies are much better, and far more refined. This one is a great starter!

Everyone should try different add-ons. I hate brandy, so I used spiced rum instead. I've also sloshed a little Cointreau in before.

I've added pomegranate juice, pomegranate seeds, blood orange slices, blackberries, cherries and even ginger ale (reduce the sugar if you try that.) Sangria is a great chance to try some unusual fruits to jazz up the look if nothing else; just stay away from overbearing flavors.

This is the best Sangria recipe. Period. 

I serve this at least once a month at my Yappy Hours (I own a little doggie daycare) and everyone raves about it and want the recipe!

I do some modifications however. I HATE the bitterness that most sangrias have so instead of sliced citrus I use mango, pineapple, watermelon, strawberries, etc - anything but fresh sliced citrus so you don't get the bitterness of the rind.

I made this for a girls only dinner party and it was a huge hit! 
I used peach schnapps and rum. I cut up all the fruit and let it sit overnight in all the liquids (except the wine). An hour before serving I added the wine (I used a cheap Merlot) and since there was no room left in the serving bowl, I left out the ginger ale and let people add it to their cups along with some ice if they wanted. Refrigerate everything the night before, including the wine, and it will stay nice and cold. Will definitely make again!

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  This makes the best sangria ever.  I made this almost exactly true to the recipe the first time, and then made a few changes the next time to suit our tastes.  I used limeade instead of lemonade as we found it a bit too lemony the first time.  I added club soda instead of carbonated water right before serving and did not add sugar or cherries as it was plenty sweet enough.  Another change I made was to add frozen grapes before serving to keep it cool and added 2 more oranges for more fruit to munch on.  This is so good and refreshing on a hot summer day you will want to keeping drinking it but it hits you harder than you realize.  We were already feeling it after the first glass, so be warned! :) Thank you so much for this recipe!

So easy. So delicious. I do recommend waiting to add citrus fruit until 3-4 hours before serving. If you leave the fruit in overnight, the Sangria can take on an acidic taste from the fruit.

I made this last weekend for a birthday bbq. I made mine in an iced tea jug the night before adding everything but the optional carbonated portion. Then I took 6 ice cube trays and dispensed half of the mixture into the trays. The following morning, I popped the frozen cubes back into the tea jug, added a can of sprite and gave it a stir! It was very yummy but I do have one complaint. While I was inside getting all the food ready to serve, it disappeared! I only got to have one glass :( Will be making often this summer! Thank you

SO DELISH!!!  I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly  (will get to that in a bit).  I doubled this recipe and it was SUCH A HIT at my 'Fiesta' themed party!  Now, for the adjustments/additions I made.  In reading other reviews, I adjusted as follows:  I used an entire frozen lemonade container (tube).  I did not add any fruits (no sliced lemon, no sliced lime, etc) until it had been marinating in the fridge for about 12 hours.  Then 4 hours before serving, I added diced apple (1 red, 1 green), diced strawberries, diced lemon, diced lime, and blackberries.  Instead of carbonated water, as I poured each drink I topped it off with a little Ginger Ale (in some cases I used Fresca, which was my personal favorite) and put a few extra blackberries and diced apples as a garnish.  It was light, refreshing, and DELICIOUS!! I  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe!!!  :)

This is a definite 5 star recipe!!!  However, my husband and I made a few changes/substitutions. We used Pinot Noir instead of dry red wine, Appleton Rum VX instead of brandy, pink frozen lemonade concentrate instead of regular and ginger ale instead of the carbonated water. Oh and Grand Marnier (triple sec).  Like some of the other reviews….it is very…very important to let rest a minimum of a day. The only issue we had was that we could only make one pitcher. Therefore we are on our way to replenish our ingredients and buy a bigger container.

I made this sangria for an autumn bonfire party recently and it was such a hit! I made a double batch and we could have used more  - it's THAT good. 

I used a 1.5L bottle of Barefoot "sweet red" wine as the base for this sangria and it worked really well. You don't need an expensive wine to make great sangria, after all. Since I made a double, I used a whole can of thawed lemonade concentrate. For the fruit, I used two cans of (drained) pineapple chunks, a jar of maraschino cherries, 2 oranges, 2 lemons, 2 limes and a quart of fresh strawberries. I omitted the sugar and add a 2 liter of ginger ale prior to serving. Also, I let the fruit sit overnight and pulled out most of the citrus in the morning. I froze the citrus (and a few other fruit pieces) throughout the day and then added the frozen pieces back in prior to serving. You definitely want to make it at least 24 hours in advance to let it sit and soak up all the goodness before serving. 

I will definitely make this again. Fantastic!!

This is a great recipe, but a little on the sweet side, even without the sugar.  I put in only 1/6 of a cup of lemonade concentrate and eliminated he maraschino cherries as well as the sugar.  I found the fruit slices overwhelmed my pitcher, but I like them in the glasses.  I fished the majority of the fruit of the pitcher before serving. I then sliced fresh lemon and orange slices and placed them in each glass and placed one on the rim of each glass as a beautiful garnish.  Sadly, they made it very difficult to drink and all fruit ended up in the glass.  With these changes I was asked to make this cocktail for every family function. Only after a double batch can put up with my in-laws.  : )

Lieke other reviewers, I used Taylor Lake Country Red, econo-jug-inexpensive wine.  I used rum instead of brandy, because I didn't have any brandy.  Otherwise, followed the ingredients.  Didn't water down with anything carbonated.  The Bunco-babes and I loved it, especially after three glasses each.  It will definitely creep up on you.  Warning to peri-menopausal women:  may lead to hot flashes.

The best sangria ever!  The only I've ever had that compares was in Madrid at Zaharas.  I did away with the club soda and used whatever fruit was handy (mostly apples, pears, and oranges).  If you can let this sit overnight you'll be in for an even tastier treat the next day.  I scoop out the old fruit and dice up fresh for the wine glasses.

It is no wonder why this has 5 stars it is amazing! If you have a big enough punch bowl, I recommend tripling the batch for larger groups. A single batch would be good for a group of 4 anymore and you want to double or triple it.  I tripled it for a party of 15 and it was gone in about 2 hours. So if your party-goers enjoy sangria make a lot. The key is letting it sit over night in the fridge. Also one other tip to save on wine is Traders Joes – 2 Buck Chuck works great- I have used the Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and the Shriaz and got great result. (I do not recommend Chianti that other Sangria recipies call for, I think it always comes out too sweet.) I never have any leftovers of this when I have a party. I never use the sugar I think it would be too sweet and I always have two litters of club soda for people to add to it if they like, but I don’t mix it in the bowl.  Also if you can take some of the lemon aid, maybe a little bit of water, some OJ and fruit and make an ice ring the night before to float in it so you don’t have to dilute it was ice.

Added 2 cups diet ginger ale in lieu of optional carbonated water; added 4 cinnamon sticks. These changes made it 5*. Tried it without the ginger ale, and it was too tart for my taste.

Ohhh Yeahh, THIS is the ONE! Incredible! Bartended for over 20 years, yet THIS recipe just blew me away. Make it, LOVE it! 

 No sugar used and also chilled all ingredients, added only some of the citrus fruit to sit then removed it and added more fruit just prior to serving.

 Added frozen grapes, as well as frozen berries just prior to party to keep cool, per another reviewer (GREAT IDEA, btw!) 

 Also diced fresh peaches, apple, whatever ya got prior to serving. Ah-MAZ-ING!

Thanks for this oh so yummy recipe!

BEST SANGRIA EVER!!! LOVE IT!  
I do make alittle change, I use a can of sliced pineapple and use the juice with/in place of the orange juice.  I also throw in a ton of fruit. Strawberries, pomegranite, pineapple plus the oranges, lemon, and lime.  And I used the advice of others and top it off with a splash of Gingerale.
Thank you for such a great recipe.

Maybe it was just us, because this recipe got so many rave reviews, but we found it to be way too strong for our liking.  I think I'll make it again and cut back a little on the brandy and triple sec.  *FOLLOW UP* - I made this recipe again, this time using rum instead of the brandy.  I cut back just a tad on the rum and triple sec, and used the ginger ale in place of the carbonated water.  HUGE improvement.  I would say this is now a 4 star recipe.  Also, do not like maraschino cherries so I used strawberries instead.

Hands down one of the best Sangrias I have ever had in my life.  Tip, be sure to make the night before so it has a chance to ferment and add the carbonated water before serving it (to the jug), I used Ginger Ale.

Delicious!  Instead of the sugar (simple sugar) and carbonated water I like the diet ginger ale.  I also add some of the maraschino cherry juice.

This really was great! It was my first time making Sangria, and I chose this based on the many rave reviews. I tripled it to fit in my beverage server nicely, and I ran out of triple sec the third go round, so I added more OJ and let it sit overnight. I will say that it tasted great immediately, so I"m not sure if it sitting overnight is really that crucial to this recipe. I took the fruits out in the morning, and added fresh fruit prior to serving with some ginger ale. Next time I will try Blackberry brandy, as I had some last weekend and it was amazing in the Sangria. **  Be warned: this is very strong if you do not dilute with ginger ale or club soda.  The way I made it was wonderful! I will make this again and again. It's the best recipe I"ve found.

Absolutely delicious Sangria. I loved it all throughout. One small change I had to make was to deduct the triple sec (didn't have any), and adding Ginger Ale. I had a BBQ for Canada Day, and this Sangria flew like nothing else. I had to prepare a second batch. A total keeper, thank you!

We liked this sangria as is, but LOVED it with the tweaks we made the second time we made it. We used orange mango juice, and that gave it a great flavor. We used blackberry flavored brandy and cut the amount in half since the original recipe was too strong for us. We substituted limeade and lime juice for the lemon juice and lemonade and thought it was so much better this way. We used cheap Spanish Rioja wine and did not use the sugar. Definite thumbs up from us, and we'll be making this all summer long!

I made this for girls night out and it was a hit.  I doubled the recipe.  A few people thought it was REALLY potent and decided to switch to my Tropical Martini's.  Those who were REAL drinkers enjoyed the robust taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made several sangria recipes and this is my favorite. I made it for a party and it was a hit. I also continued to have it for the next two days (I made a bit too much), and it still tasted good. I love this recipe. I don't use brandy because I don't like the taste of brandy. Sometimes I throw in the ingredients without measuring, and it tastes good regardless because all of the ingredients work well. I usually leave the cherries out too. I just thought it was a lot of fruit and they weren't necessary for me. Instead of carbonated water, I add ginger ale sometimes. Be sure to add it at the last minute though if you want bubbles.

Excellent Sangria! We've tried several Sangrias around town to great disappointment, but this recipe was a huge success. Saving it in my Recipe Box for another batch soon :-).

I would remove rinds on fruit because it will leave a bitter taste.  I minus the sugar and lemon and used grenadine instead of the sugar.... Delish!!!

I skipped the cherries, used a whole can of frozen lemonaide and substituted gingerale for the club soda.  I did not add sugar - I added other sweet things :)  Most Excellent!! I will freeze any leftovers, if any...., and make slushes :)

This recipe is fantastic!  We tripled this for a party of about 12 people and had to make another batch when it ran out.  DEFINITELY use the sugar, but we didn't change a thing and it was perfect.

I made this for mom's night out and had to make another pitcher everyone loved it so much.  It is definitely tastier if you let it soak overnight.

This was a hit at party I made this for yesterday. I left it the fridge overnight.  I didn't use sugar or club soda. I left it up to the guests if they wanted ice in their drink.

This is my "go-to" sangria recipe.  I don't add sugar or seltzer water.  Caution: this is a strong drink.  Sip it slowly over ice and enjoy eating the alcohol-infused fruit.  You won't be disappointed!

This is an amazing recipe. I've never had sangria before and decided that this recipe most appealed to me. I used everything the recipe called for and am I ever glad I did. I let it sit overnight in the fridge and it turned out beautifully. Thanks HJacoby!

I made this sangria for a party with co-workers. They LOVED it (a couple even overindulged!) and I'm now required to bring it to every party. I don't use any sugar, but I do add fresh sliced ginger. I would say the longer it sits, the better it gets. Mine sits for a minimum of 12 hrs. I leave seltzer and Gosling's ginger beer to the side of the sangria pitcher, but many prefer it straight. When its not 25-50% diluted with seltzer or the like, take care-its pretty strong!

A 5-star recipe! Most sangria is too sweet for me, but this one, made with club soda and no white sugar, is perfect. Even my wine-snob guests loved it!

I made a double batch of this recipe and it was gone in a half an hour. They LOVED it! I added a few strawberries and omitted the sugar and it was amazing. Just made a double batch for dinner (it is WAY better when it sits for at least 24 hours)

How refreshing! I omitted the lemon juice and triple sec and subsituted peach schnapps. I did quadruple the recipe and used only 1/2 cup sugar and a whole container of frozen lemon concentrate. I used more brandy and peach schnapps than listed. I will make again.

Delicious...I doubled the recipe and served it at a summer party, and it was a huge hit.  Other than doubling it, I didn't change the recipe, other than leaving out the cherries.  It is strong, but you won't realize how strong at first. It is so good, you may be tempted to drink it too quickly.  Very, very good.

You've got to double or even triple this recipe if having a party.  I spent all weekend making Sangria. It was THAT good!  Also, I left out the sugar completely.

I made a double batch of this for a big gathering and everyone loved it!!  I used white wine (as there were going to be kids running around and didn't want red wine drinks getting knocked over onto the carpet!) and ginger ale and it was excellent.  Will definitely try with the red wine next time...when there are only grown ups around!

This is a great recipe for sangria.  I used spiced rum in place of the brandy, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I would recommend making more than one pitcher though.  We ran out fast!

I had a sangria taste test at my house one weekend (I made 3 different ones) and this recipe got first place.  Here's what I did:

1. I did't measure the brandy, I poured enough to cover the fruit and let it sit for 36 hours.
2. I used merlot
3. I did NOT use sugar or cherries
4. I used Diet 7-up instead of carbonated water/ginger ale.

I will make this again and again!

Very forgiving recipe if you don't have everything on hand. Changed it up a bit to make it similar to the sangria I drink at my favorite tapas place. Used apples and oranges as the only fruits, no sugar, ginger ale for bubbles and I used one bottle of Merlot and one bottle of bottled Sangria wine (I doubled the recipe). I just made some for tomorrow night and I'm "sampling" it. It's really good but I can tell it's strong!

i made 5 gallons of this today for my bbq. i used a fifth of brandy and 2 gallon jugs of wine. i didnt use the triple sec i forgot it so i upped the orange juice because triple sec tastes like oranges. i used 7up since i already had it for the party. this was beautiful and all that was left was a 2 qt pitcher and everyone was very smiley.

Just to add a little kick I added another 1/2 cup of brandy and instead of sparkling water add 1 bottle of champagne. That mixture will make everyone forget it's summer. Try it, you'll like it.

Pretty good but still wish it were stronger. :) I used:
1.) 2 buck chuck - merlot
2.) Peach Shnapps instead of triple sec
3.) Cut the sugar out completely
4.) Added pears, apples, strawberries
5.) Had some 7-up on hand for guests
6.) Let the juice and fruit sit overnight

Next time I'll add more brandy and peach schnapps. yum!

The best sangria I have ever drank! I was sad when it was all gone. I mixed it with the ginger ale and it made it nice and smooth going down. I used fresh squeezed orange and lemon juice and also added a little bit of lime juice.

I've used this recipe several times over the past few years, but I realized this last time I've never rated it! It's so good I never have enough! For our wedding reception/housewarming, I made 4 batches and filled our pretty glass bev dispenser... it was gone in an hour flat!! Make WAYYY more than you think you'll need, I'm planning on 8 batches for our next party.

I have been making this for summer parties for the last two years and it is always a hit. EVERYONE loves it.  The 1st time they drink they always try to figure out all the wonderful tastes. I use inexpensive red wine by the gallon and it is just as great.  Hint, dont put the fruit in a skinny neck bottle!!!

I did not care for this recipe. Followed the receipe to the letter. It is much to dry and mich too strong. I made this for a dinner party and my guests couldnt finish their drinks. Embarrassing and very dissapoining.

This really IS the best Sangria I've ever had. I've made it 3 times in the last 3 weekends for friends and everyone (even white wine drinkers) really enjoyed it!!
1st time I made it pretty much to recipe - the 2nd time I didn't have any orange juice so fresh squeezed some and it was delicious.
Never had the cherries - but it was great.
And twice I didn't have the time for it to sit more than about 5 hours and it was still delicious.

just served this last night at my husband's 40th birthday last night and everyone loved it!  tripled the recipe, added apple instead of lime, and cubed it...would chop the orange and lemon next time so its easier to eat.  substituted limoncello for the triple sec, and a mixture of southern comfort and slivovitz (plum brandy) for the brandy.  served it in 1 gallon mason jars with ladles which looked beautiful!

There's only one problem with this, if you follow the recipe exactly it goes very quickly. Don't bother making it unless you double it! I add the sugar and just add the club soda when I pour it into a glass.

This is really good and definitely best done a day ahead.  I skip the sugar and use ginger ale or sprite instead of carbonated water (less chance of the sugar just falling to the bottom).  I also skip the maraschino cherries as I don't care for them and they aren't very authentic.  Cheap wine is fine here (in fact it's encouraged!).  I often use the jugs of burgundy that you can get for around $10.

I tried this out Friday night for a game night at a friends house. They like wine but have never had Sangria before, my friends loved this. I will definitely be making this in the future especially considering a glass at a bar is about $12 here and most of these ingredients I keep on hand anyway!!

Made a double batch of this on Christmas Eve (2010).  I should have made more because it was gone very quickly!  Made just a few small changes: used rum instead of brandy because that's what we had on hand, left out the sugar, and added diet lemon lime soda instead of the carbonated water right before serving.  It did need to be a little sweeter in my opinion, so I added a couple tablespoons of splenda.  Might just have to make this again for New Year's!

CRAZY good! I've made this many times over the past year or two and anytime I bring it to a party, bbq, whatever there is never any left and I always get requests for the recipe. I use cheap red wine (usually Trader Joe's 2-buck-chuck merlot) and usually use a peach or apricot brandy, and in a pinch I've used peach schnapps in lieu of the triple sec (hey, whatever works, right?!), and aside from the listed fruit I'll also throw in oranges, frozen or fresh strawberries, basically just whatever I have on hand. It's worth the ingredients and the time it takes for the flavors to blend. Yummy-yum-yum!!!!!!

A few neighbors got together to do a Progressive Dinner. The concept is you start at one house for appetizers and cocktails, proceed to another house for the main meal then finish at another house for dessert. I had the privilege of providing appetizers and cocktails. I wasn't sure what to serve because I have a few neighbors that do not indulge in alcoholic beverages. I also didn't want to spend the evening blending drinks and playing bartender and was concerned about a drink for the men so I decided to try this Sangria. OMG...this was the HIT of the evening!!! Even those who had a preference of not indulging had MORE THAN ONE GLASS! I followed the recipe but used Duplin Black River Red wine (it's a little sweeter) and I used Vernors Ginger Ale instead of carbonated water. I also pre filled the wine glasses with diced strawberries, peaches and maraschino cherries.   I agree with everyone the key is to let it sit over night. The neighbors were in no rush to proceed to the next house for dinner and everyone wanted me to write down the recipe. :0)

Incredible!  We loved this recipe!  Used Trentare 33 red wine ($6/bottle @ Trader Joe's), which was perfectly dry for this recipe.  Left out the sugar, cherries, and carbonated water.  I didn't have frozen lemonade concentrate, so I used an extra 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.  Served over ice.  Delicious!

This was amazing and easy. If you want a really sweet sangria, use Stella Rosa wine. Yum.

I made this for the first time during the Christmas holidays.  I followed the recipe strictly.  At the end of the evening guests were asking for more although I had doubled it.  Great! Everyone loved it.

Made for a party, and it was a hit. I used Appleton rum instead of brandy. I bought a very very large bottle of cheap burgundy wine. It gets better with age. We had the leftovers 5 days latter, and it was better! I also mixed with ginger ale instead of club soda and omitted the sugar. Why ginger ale, because it's Christmas. I already made three more pitchers for Christmas eve.

The key is soaking the fruit overnight. Wow, was this good!  I added 7-up instead of carbonated water and had rave reviews from all that tried it.  Everyone came back for seconds and the 2 pitchers I made for girls night was completely gone.  I quickly tried to whip up another batch, but obviously didn't have time to soak the fruit and it wasn't the same.  Fantastic recipe...Thanks!

After having tasted and made about a thousand different Sangria's over the years, I have settled on this one as the best of the bunch. I typically add additional fruits like strawberries and pineapple, or whatever I have on hand. I like to make a double batch so we have enough for the weekend. Always a huge hit.

The best Sangria recipe I have used!! It really does help to refrigerate the sangria the night before. Also, adding gingerale instead of club soda intensifies the flavor! Great recipe to have!!

This was excellent! I added sierra mist at the end, and not the water. I also added random fruits that I had in the house, so not everything in the list. It was great. Everyone enjoyed it and it was so easy to make!

This was a fantastic recipe! I subed the brandy for rum, triple sec for peach schnapps, used only 2/3 the sugar, and no carbonated water. Sweet enough, and potent!

This is a favorite for summer BBQs and people always ask me to bring it. I don't have a specific wine I use - though I prefer a dry red and use less sugar, testing to taste. I use the citrus fruit as recommended by the recipe, but it would probably be great with green apples instead, as suggested by another reviewer. Because I like to keep it "dry" rather than sweet, I add carbonation with lemon-lime flavored seltzer water instead of 7up. This one is definitely a keeper!

This is GREAT! I only had about 6 hrs for this to sit in the fridge and it was really good. I did not use cherries. When I served it I filled the glass with plenty of ice, put fresh lemon and lime slices in each glass added a few raspberries, blueberries and blackberries and topped it off with a splash of soda water. It looked as good as it tasted!

I tripled this recipe for a big bbq party. I used half blackberry brandy and 1/2 regular brandy. I used a red zin and had to end up adding some sugar to the recipe. Next time I won't add the extra lemon juice or lemon slices.  I think it might have helped to make it a little too sour. I wasn't sure if I should let this sit out all night without being in the refrigerator but my container was too big to sit in the fridge so I took  the advice of another review and stuck it in a ice chest with some ice overnight. Next time I might try apricot brandy because I like my sangria a little more fruity tasting and I don't think blackberry brandy is that much different than regular brandy. I forgot to add the sparkling water. I agree with other post. It doesn't need it.

As collectors of fine wines we generally sneer at wine "cocktails" or anything that alters the wine. But I wanted to try something a little different, and convinced my wine snob husband to do the same. I made this exactly as directed, the only difference being that I didn't see the need to add soda to the drink. I can see that if one is not  accustomed, adding a little soda could make it go down easier. I made it a day ahead, and we had it as a weekend cocktail--very tasty! I reminded my husband that I would order something similar at a bar, served in a tall glass with crushed ice, a straw, & garnished with a cherry or to, and happily pay 8 bucks. In fact, I think that's how I'll serve it in the future. Great summertime cocktail!

I make this regularly for parties and it never lasts!!! I usually only use about half of the sugar though, sometimes less, depending on my wine. All in all, this is an absolutely delicious recipe, and an oh so beautiful color! Don't forget to eat the fruit out of it the next morning. Mm mm good!
 
Sangria is traditionally a recipe from Spain (yumm...) and, this recipe is pretty accurate. The only real difference between this and a legitimate Spanish sangria is the sweetness, which probably comes from the addition of the lemonade concentrate (and also the sugar, which I've already mentioned, but nobody said it was illegal to like your booze sweetened!)

Very Yummy! This was a big hit at our New Year's party. We ran out and had to piece together another batch (I'm sure it wasn't as good, but at that point no one seemed to notice). As other reviewers suggested, I left out the sugar and cherries and added 7 UP at the last minute. I also added an apple and pear and let it sit overnight in the fridge so the flavors all mingled together.

My first time making sangria, but certainly won't be my last!  I made this for a birthday party that I was hosting, and I made 4x the recipe but didn't have much left over!  I'll definitely make this for our next party.   Set it out in a punch bowl...it makes a beautiful presentation!  Thanks for sharing!

WONDERFUL.  I made this for a party of 23, it's sweet but not too sweet and as several other reviewers have mentioned... the brandy IS key.  I used a dry Barefoot wine and went ahead and threw a few more fruits in just to add more color to the drink since this was a honeymoon-themed bridal party (threw in some kiwi and strawberries).  You really can't go wrong with the fruit combos.  Made this the day before the party (a must in order to allow all flavors to blend and fruit to marinate) but come day of the party totally forgot to add ginger ale and carbonated water (I was going to make two batches to see which was more popular among the guests), but the drink was a huge hit even without the fizz!

I've been making this Sangria recipe for three years now.  I make it ahead of time and share it with friends on our summer camping trips.  I've tried other Sangria recipes, and ordered Sangria in restaurants and this is BY FAR the best ever!  For my taste, the fruit & juice add enough sweetness, so I omit the sugar altogether.

Very Good!  Everyone loved this.  I doubled the recipe and used it two days in a row adding diet sprite just before serving.  I will definately make again.
2010 Update:  I have been making this for several years now and everyone I serve it to loves it.  I use a 3 Liter bottle of Chianti & quadruple the recipe for a big crowd.  I always make it the day before and leave out the sugar, and add clear american black cherry carbonated water from walmart at the last minute.  If there is any leftover it last several weeks.

Made this for the first time for a office/holiday lunch. I originally doubled the recipe and it went so fast I had to make another triple recipe. Everyone loved it. It was the hit of the luncheon. I used gingel ale instead of club soda. I also added apples and included the optional sugar.

This was really nice.  Not a five star for me, but clearly 4 star.  Now....as we had more and more sangria, the rating certainly went up and up!  Cheers!

This was a huge hit at my last summer party.  I made two pitchers and it disappeared in no time.  I did refrigerate it overnight as others have suggested which helped make the flavors mix.  Will be making again soon.  Great recipe.

This is excellent. However, if you don't use up all the Sangria the first day, be sure to remove the citrus. The peels make it bitter the second day.

Nothing not to to like about this recipe...it's sangria at its best.  Do let the fruit steep in the wine mixture as long as possible (I did overnight), as it really enhances the overall flavor of the sangria.  Thanks HJOCBY for submitting this recipe; it's a winner!

I wanted a sangria recipe for a special picnic I made for my husband, who LOVES sangria. Me, not so much...until now! It was just delicious, not too sweet or too tangy, just perfect. He wants me to make it every weekend. This is the first sangria I've ever had that I like. I made according to directions except I used raspberries instead of cherries, eliminated the sugar and used Sprite instead of carbonated water per other reviewers' suggestions. I also quartered my fruit and let everything but the sprite sit in a pitcher overnight in the fridge. Will be making a double batch next time! Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I'm personally not a sangria fan, but this was very well liked by friends & family.  Put it in a big beverage dispenser and made a frozen ice ring of OJ, wine and club soda w/ fresh fruit in it to keep it cold while in dispenser - looked very nice!

A-MAZ-ING Sangria! Easy to make and tasty to drink. I do recommend leaving the carbonated water on the side for people to add as they please. I will definitely be making this again!!

AMAZING.  Ok so I was worried at first about the amount of alcohol in here but this sangria disappeared on us.  I tripled the recipe for our party so I added 3 cans of gingerale to it.  That put the cherry on the cake.  Make sure to mix it from time to time because the brandy tends to go down the bowl which makes the last cups very strong.

I made this for a halloween party and it was super popular! I used cherry brandy and ginger ale instead of carbonated water.  For the fruit I just used sliced up oranges and apples.  Made it 24 hrs in advance and added ginger ale just before serving.  I also heated up orange juice and lemonade concentrate on the stove with the sugar, just to get it to dissolve fully.  Will definitely save this recipe.

I served this sangria at my wedding last month and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone loved it. I omitted the sugar and cherries, and used ginger ale instead of club soda. We made it the night before and let it sit overnight (a full 24 hours) before adding the ginger ale, it was absolutely perfect! We made 15 batches of both this red and another white sangria, and this one was gone before the end of the night! I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is great.  I modified it slightly by adding chopped asian pears and substituting Canada Dry Ginger Ale for the carbonated water.  It was such a huge hit at the last party that we ran out so this time we're doubling up!

Awesome recipe! I made a white version using a moscato. This is a sweet wine so be careful, you may not need the added sugar and use club soda.  I chopped the apples in cubes and soaked in the brandy overnight prior to making the sangria.  What an added surprise for those who bit into them.  I received many many compliments.

Love this recipe. I also tweaked it a bit for a lighter sangria as an alternative. I use White Zin instead of Red wine, use apple, canned pinapple (with juice), and mango for the fruit. I use no sugar, and use ginger ale instead of soda water. It is great either way. Dark or light.

Super yummy.  Made a huge batch so I multiplied by 3.  I didn't use the lemon juice or the sugar.  I let the fruit marinate in the mixture over night but removed all the citrus rinds the next morning.  I then added fresh citrus fruit a few hours before serving.  The drink received rave reviews.  The next day I removed the citrus rinds and added blackberries, strawberries, apples, and a few peaches (just what I had in kitchen) I served it with a few pieces of fruit in the glass, some ice, and a splash of ginger ale. (Subbed Sierra Mist when we ran out of ginger ale)  We ended up finishing it off that second night.  Not bad for 6 mommies!

Excellent drink!  We made a double batch and it was so delicious!  We added more fruit than called for, adding pineapple, grapes and orange slices.  We also used ginger ale instead of the carbonated water and only used 1/4 cup of sugar for the whole batch!

I received rave reviews when I brought this to a sangria party recently.  The only modification I did was used Sprite and I did add about a cup of sugar...I just prefer wine more sweet.  Highly recommend this recipe, as everyone who tasted it thought I bought it somewhere instead of making it:).

LOVE LOVE LOVE! I use the Gallo pinot noir (the 1.5L) and double all the ingredients except for the sugar, which I only use 1/4 cup. I omit the cherries and the carbonated water and its heavenly. Let is sit overnight.... VERY important. I have made it for the last three get togethers and with all that Sangria its gone by two hours in. If I had a bigger pitcher I would make even more! Delicious :)

The best!  I've made this several times since Thanksgiving (when I first made it).  It's now frequently requested by my friends.  :o)

***UPDATE***
I've since doubled the wine and I use a table red or a red rose wine; bump up the lemon juice to 1/3 c.; double the triple sec, orange juice, frozen lemonade, and sugar; and leave the brandy at 1/2 c.  Delish!  I finally have it right.

Honed to perfection is right! I have been drinking Sangria for at least 35 years and this is the absolute BEST I've ever had. Made it exactly according to your directions, took it to a party last night, and everyone LOVED it. Thank you!

I am used to making Sangria with a Monin mix, which is hard to find other than ordering it online.  So, i thought I'd give this a try last night for New Year's Eve.  I made a triple batch, it was all gone.  I have a new favorite!  And without the pricey Monin mix!  I, too, use Charles Shaw (Two Buck Chuck) wines.  They're our favorite and you can't beat the price!

Very tasty and a hit at the party! I substituted Citron Rum for the brandy, used triple sec, eliminated the sugar and used 7-Up instead of club soda.  I do recommend having some of the soda available for your drinkers to mellow the sangria if needed.  For reference, I used "2 buck Chuck" Merlot from Trader Joe's. I made a double batch and used 2 oranges, 2 limes and 2 lemons per the recipe.  Next time, I'll use one of each for a double batch just to save space in the pitcher and glasses. Also, I recommend halving the orange slices so they fit in the glass better.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious--I can't stop making it! This is also a fun recipe to play with.  I tend to overbuy when it comes to fruit, so I throw in whatever I need to use up--sliced strawberries and kiwi are my favorite additions.  However tempting it is to start pouring early, you're cheating yourself if you don't wait at least 24 hours.  If you can hold out for 36, even better.  This stuff gets better the longer it sits in the fridge.

This recipe is PERFECT. I've made this sangria several times and given the recipe away each time. The alcohol content is just right for a relaxing evening on the deck or your celebration of choice. I've also served the soaked fruit separately and that was a hit too. I definitely recommend this.

This has been a summer staple for five years now. How convenient that Costco sells cheap bottles of red wine, huge bags of lemons, limes, and boxes of oranges. It's like it was meant to be!

Served this at a party and it was a hit.  I left out the cherries and carbonated water, it was just right the way it was.  We used Lambrusco, it's a great, soft red wine with a hint of fizz.  Delicious!  As some others stated, be careful!  It sneaks up on you.

Just made this for our Memorial Day party and I couldn't resist sampling early :).  Never had Sangria so I'm not sure what this is supposed to taste like...but it's pretty darn good!!  Hubby and I are sure enjoying it!  Maybe there won't be any left for our guests hehe.  Made the recipe as written using Cabernet and a sweet red wine, no sugar but dumped in the entire jar of cherries, and ginger ale (I prefer my drinks a little sweeter).  I did as one of the other reviewers suggested and removed the citrus fruits the next day but left the cherries in-yum!  Nice recipe that I see could be easily tweaked for personal preferences.  Thanks!

This was truly awesome stuff! Read through the reviews and made only one or two tweaks...left out the sugar, allowed guests to add ginger ale as opposed to carbonated water to their own glasses per their own taste, and sliced up some strawberries, blackberries and apples to add to the citrus. Tossed in some frozen grapes to each glass to act as ice cubes and there you have it. I was having a paella party (try the Paella I recipe incidentally, you won't be disappointed in that one either) and even the men drank this as opposed to beer. Only mistake was not quadrupling the batch, made only as double and it was gone in no time!

I have not even let this sit overnight yet, and it is DARN GOOD!  I can't wait to see what it tastes like after 'mellowing' overnight.  I have a bottle of pinot grigio in the fridge, so I'll be making a white sangria with this recipe next.  I did not have the frozen lemonade, I forgot to pick it up when I was at the store, so I doubled the Orange juice and so far, so GOOD!

This is AMAZING!!  We doubled the recipe and made it almost exactly as listed, except we added gingerale instead of club soda right before serving.  It was incredible and will definitely use it for all our parties. Thank you!!

Never made sangria before. AWESOME recipe! Didn't have triple sec (so just substituted in more brandy) and didn't have lemonade concentrate (so just added in more lemon juice). Read the recipes that said it should really rest 24 hours and so I was a little concerned because I made it in the morning for an evening dinner party. Even with all those changes and letting it rest abour 8 hours, it turned out delicious! The whole pitcher was gone. Didn't add the carbonated water or the cherries- didn't care for them and the sangria still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty!
So, I hate when people talk about how they changed everything in a recipe because then it's not really the recipe! I didn't have everything the recipe called for, so I did my best to replace with simliar items.
I didn't have regular brandy, so I used cherry brandy. I didn't have triple sec, so I used Grand Mariner. I didn't have maraschino cherries, but I did have some sour cherries from Trader Joe's that I added.
I let it sit about 30 hours. YUM! It was a hit! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit. I made it exactly from the direction but added ginger ale instead of club soda. It was gone fast and I have already had two requests for the recipe.

Made this for my future sister in laws  bridal shower.  At first seemed a little strong, but the longer it sits the better it is.  I let the fruit soak for about 24 hrs, then took the fruit out that morning of the shower.  At the shower I added fresh oranges, cherries, strawberries and ginger ale.  I also skipped the sugar and instead of carbonated water I used ginger ale.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!  I was asked to make this for the bachelorette party.

Made exactly as directed.  Used a Spanish Cabernet and because it was pretty dry, I added the optional sugar.  Made about 16 hours in advance and it was perfect by the pool the next day.  I don't usually drink sangria but my friend is a fan and she said this was the best she has ever had.  And I enjoyed it too.

As another reviewer (scrapbookwife) suggested I used rum not brandy, peach scnapps not triple sec.  I omitted the sugar and used ginger ale before serving.  Very good.

Best Sangria you will ever have hands down!!  But beware, it does come up and bite you!!  I substitute Orange Crush for the orange juice, use the sugar, and NO carbonated water.  Better with a dry oak and spice red wine, then its not too fruity.  All my friends LOVE this recipe!!

I made a double batch (12 cups).  For reference; all the ingredients came to 1 gallon.  I did not add the sugar and opted for the Ginger Ale instead.  I also left all the fruit in the pitcher and instead of floating slices I put a pineapple spear in with each 8 oz. glass (juice glass).  It was a hit.

Awesome, if dangerous recipe. Have made it successfully many many times.   1) I recommend using orange curacao - I settle on this after experimenting with triple sec and others but invariably this provides the smoothest, richest flavor. 2) A raw cane sugar * lemon juice combo can easily be substituted for the lemonade concentrate (which is afterall just a shortcut). 3) I find a merlot is the best choice for a deeper flavor. 4) Make sure it is well chilled and all the fruit nice and alcoholic!

Sorry folks, guess you haven't had my friend Helen's Sangria!  She won't share her recipe and I thought this might be it.  I followed the suggestions of eliminating the sugar and using Ginger Ale as a carbonator, added gingerale to the glass at the end, didn't work.  Added the 1/4 c. of sugar and it didn't help much so when the brige group arrived, I dumped the 2 cups of Ginger Ale in the pitcher with the mix.  There were no 2nds asked.  Didn't expect any to be leftover but it is 'marinating' in the refrigerator and I will probably throw it out.  Oh, I did use a good wine that I would drink.  Too sour, even with sugar, and too lemony and fruit didn't look pretty, like Helen's.

Excellent! I left out the lemonade, sugar and cherries and substituted lemon/lime soda for carbonated water and it was fantastic- I needed to change the quantity to serve 50 people.  I bought several gallons (4 liters each)el cheapo red wine and adjusted the remaining ingredients to make several batches. I don't even like red wine by itself but this was muey fantastico!!

Whoa!  This was delicious - I used spiced rum vs. brandy, blackberry merlot and omitted the sugar.  Even my beer drinking husband enjoyed this cocktail!  The secret is definitely letting it sit overnight.  Very tasty with a great kick :-)

We made this for friends last weekend and it was a HUGE hit.  The only issue is that we didn't make enough!  We really don't know much about sangria so we were flying blind here, but boy will this become a staple for us from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! This IS the best Sangria recipe!  I typically can "take-or-leave" Sangria, but decided to try it out on company this week.  I wouldn't change a thing on the recipe - I did add club soda to the mix, otherwise it may have been too sweet.  Very YUMMMMMMY!

I made this sangria for a fiesta party and within 30 minutes it was nearly gone (and I even doubled the recipe!) It was a hit and I'll make it again!  I used peach scnapps and rum rather than brandy and triple sec.  I also used a liter of ginger ale and fresh peach slices just moments before serving.  Fantastico!!

I made this in the summer for a gathering, and I have been getting requests for it ever since! It's so good, it is smooth, you don't taste much alcohol but it can knock you on your but easily! I used 7-up instead of ginger ale, I mean lemons and limes are added so why not a soda with a lemon lime flavor? It is a must try, and save recipe, cause once you make it, people just won't let you stop.

I never liked Sangria in the past, but when I tried this, it was unbelievable!  I made a double batch and added 2 c of ginger ale.  I forgot the cherries, though.  Delicious!

This was SO good!  The best sangria I've had.  We made o.j. cubes so it wouldn't dilute the flavour and it was perfect! I also used Sprite rather than club soda.  Will definitely make it again this summer.

Great if you have everything, if you don't and need to make some compromises it's still flavorful. I did not have lemonade concentrate but a can of tropicana lemonade did well. Ginger ale was also a welcome addition in lieu of carbonated water. You can really make this recipe work if you taste as you add. We loved the result!

Mr. Yum Yum says YUM!  This Sangria is so good and a close match to my favorite restaurant, El Burro in Campbell, CA. I've made this many times. I do not use the carbonated soda because Sangria is better without it IMO. Nor do i bother with the cherries as they do nothing to enhance the flavor.  Mr. Yum Yum gives this 5 Oles!

This recipe is a good start. Add a sliced peach and macerate with citrus. Omit lemon juice, OJ and frozen concentrate. Cut triple sec in half, add ¼C of peach schnapps. Add the wine, omit the sugar and refrigerate for minimum of 3 hrs., preferably, overnight. Before serving, add 1L. of 7Up, reg. or diet. Gotta watch those calories!!

I 3X this recipe for Superbowl Sunday. And it was just about all gone. I would say it was a definite hit.  I have had peach sangria that I personally like better but this one was delish.  My advice... definitely don't skimp on the fruit.  I 3X'd all ingredients but the fruit and I was sorry, I ended up adding more the day of the party.  it will look like A LOT of fruit but it's much better!! To me Lime was the key, added that extra zing in contrast to the sweetness of the orange juice and lemonade.  OH and I did what others suggested and used Ginger ale.

I receive nothing but rave reviews for this sangria..  EVERY time I make it.. funny thing, when I made it.. I had no frozen lemonade concentrate. However, I found a frozen lime ice pop (real fruit) in the freezer.. broke it up, and put it in.. worked like a charm!  I am sure other 'substitutions' would work as well!~

Delicious! I used Rioja wine, added peach schnapps substituted fresh strawberries in place of the fresh orange, skipped the added sugar and used ginger ale instead of carbonated water.
Next time, I would skip the peach schnapps and lemonade concentrate, too - just didn't need that much sweetness for my taste.

I made this for our super bowl party last year. I doubled the recipe and still ended up having to make 4 more (double) batches. It is now the most requested think I make for parties. I used much more fruit and dumped in the entire jar of maraschino cherries.

Sneaky sneaky.  This has a wonderful fruity flavor, but it will kick back.  Beware - it's pretty addictive.  I've made this recipe "by the book" and it's amazing.  However, I was in a jam and had everything except the lemon & orange.  I left them out.  It wasn't nearly as pretty, but it was still quite tasty.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, more like I used it as a guideline, with great results!  I used the lemonade concentrate, orange juice, and triple sec as a base.  For everything else I just used what I had, lambrusco (not a dry red), chardonnay (to make up for the sweet red), and Yukon Jack instead of brandy (that's just what I had). I didn't add any additional sugar, but it didn't need it! I added a splash of seltzer water to each glass when served.  It was a big hit!!

AMAZING!!! This recipe is a definite keeper! Was missing some ingredients so had to tweak it a little but it turned out delicious. I omitted the Brandy and instead of using the lemonade concentrate I added extra fresh squeezed lemon juice and a little extra orange juice. Yummy. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Fantastic - very similar to the Sangria we had in Barcelona! Modifications I made:  used blackberry brandy and omitted the lemon juice - thought that would make it too tart, saved the club soda and added it by the glass instead of mixing it in.  This is my new favorite drink!

LOVE!! I halved the sugar, used diet ginger ale instead of club soda, & added strawberries then let it all soak together overnight. It was amazing! Next time I will omit the strawberries or add them right before serving because they didn't hold up well over time.

I've never made sangria before but, as other reviewers noted, this is an excellent recipe! It is strong but you won't notice by the flavor. I used a $10 (on sale for $7) shiraz. I would't recommend using the least expensive wine becuase there is a lot of wine flavor through the fruit.

I have made this sangria for several bbqs now and it is always hit. I usually bulk up the recipe by adding some carlo rossi sangria after i already multiply the recipe by 5. Usually add some strawberries too!

delicious, but quite strong, so watch out... it'll sneak up on you! i like adding extra oranges because i enjoy eating the fruit - they absorb alcohol and become quite potent in themselves, yet still taste great!

Awesome and easy to make!  I absolutely HATE red wine and had some left over from a party I hosted.  BUT this recipe made it delicious!  I used sugar and gingerale to counteract the dry bitterness of red wine.  Def recommend this!

Excellent.  I made mine the night before, and didn't add as much sugar.  I think the key is leaving it overnight though since I quickly whipped up a second batch (by popular demand!) and it was good- but not AS good.  Every time someone tried it they got a look of amazement. lol  It was such a hit!

This is FABULOUS! I made a double batch for a party and even the "non drinkers" were drinking this! I omitted the sugar and filled 1/2 of the glass with sangria and topped it off with ginger-ale! It was a hit at my party!

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I made this over the summer when my mother in law came up from FL. The only change that I made was adding different fruits. I added blueberries, mango, pineapple, and strawberries. I used brandy, Ed Hardy Sangria red wine and peachtree schnapps!

I've made this recipe or some version of it, as it is a very flexible and forgiving recipe, tons of times.  And it's always a huge it!  The only thing I have never done was add the sugar.  If you use a splash of sprite or gingerale it has plenty of sweetness.  This has been dubbed by friends as "the hold sangria."  Enjoy!

Absolute best recipie EVER!  I made this for a party hosted by my latino friend.  I was so nervous as I was the only non-latino at this party.  OMG, it was a success.  I am asked to bring this to every party she host now.  Thank you, thank you!  I made it once and let it only soak a couple of hours.  It was good, but the key is to let it sit overnight!

I just made this recipe for my BBQ that I had today. It was GREAT! I read all the reviews before making it and these are the changes I made. Im not a cherry person so did not include cherries. I used fresh squeezed orange and lemon juices when it called for that. i also used clementines instead of oranges, the flavor is so much better I think. I only used 3 rounded tbsp sugar as Im not a sweet drink person. I added 2 fresh nectarines and 2 cups fresh pineapple. I used sprite instead of club soda or gingerale as I had omitted some of the sugar. This was truly an excellent Sangria and several people insisted on the recipe before they left. It was a serious hit. You wont be dissappointed.

comparing this to some wine drink from Mexico ... Sangria is Spanish NOT Mexican. Spain has European influences and Mexico has S.A. Indian influences - in both food and drink. Different cultures entirely. Be careful of rating apples to oranges ... Oh, floating sliced apples in this is nice too. Remember to eat the fruit ... Yummo!

This Sangria is one of the best I have tried ~ I was taught to add the fruit and sugar first.  I take my wooden spoon and break up some of the fruit to release their flavors ~ other than that I use ginger ale (about 1 can per bottle)  ~ delicious! thank you for sharing!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit at my get togethers...people beg for me to make. I don't use ginger ale or club soda, just with some sugar depending on how sweet I want it. It does better if it sits in the fridge for a few hours before serving.

So good and very potent...so be careful.  Also Sangria is a very forgiving recipes with lots of different variations.  I used a sparkling wine and skipped the sprite/soda.  Didn't have orange juice, so added lemonade.  Perfect summer concoction!

OMG, this is SO GOOD! I made a quadruple batch for my 40th birthday party and it was a huge hit! I used frozen berries in addition to the fruits mentioned in the recipe. I also used an inexpensive Shiraz for the wine and let the mixture sit in the fridge for about 36 hrs. (After doing some online research regarding which type of wine to use, I found out that Sangria was originally made with inexpensive table wines to enhance their flavor, which makes complete sense and did the job! I can't see using an expensive wine just to doctor it up?!) I added Ginger Ale right before serving. Myself and my guests highly recommend this recipe!

I served this with a giant foccacia bread sandwich, and pepperoni salad to friends and they loved it.  I did not use the cherries, but followed the recipe exactly.  I served it straight without the seltzer water.  I will be sure to double it next time. WONDEFUL!

This was a big hit.  Instead of dry red wine I used the Boones Sangria. I used 8 bottles so this was a much cheaper alternative, and this still tasted GREAT!!  I also soaked my fruit in the triple sec and stuck it in the frezzer overnight.  This was a huge hit at our Holiday Party.

This was a hit at a party I had; just be careful, because it packs a punch! I doubled the recipe but found it to be too citrusy, so on my next try I didn't double the fruit slices, and it was perfect. I also used ginger ale in place of club soda, but I'm sure it would be good without. Don't forget the cherries - I love the flavor they add!

Delicious! I omitted the sugar because it was sweet enough. For one batch I used Menage a Trois, and the second batch I used Blackstone Merlot. Both were delicious, and the fruits are great to nibble on too. :)

I completely agree with everyone on how great this Sangria is!! My only  recommendation is that you don't just use one batch. The one and only batch I made went in about 5 minutes. It can serve about 5-6 servings. If you have a big crowd or you think that your guests will want more than one glass, double or triple this recipe! (Also, I omitted the sugar and water and added Sprite instead). It was Incredible!

Finally found a keeper Sangria recipe!!!  Almost gave up making it because it came out too tart.  No leftovers with this recipe.  I didn't use the sugar but the maraschino cherry juice (to taste)  1/2 jar juice to start with.  Also I used ginger ale (instead of c. water) but let everyone add it themselves to their own taste!  Everyone liked it!

Very good base recipe. Brandy and triple sec are a must.... skipped the lemonade concentrate and just added more lemon juice...Can vary the fruit- do NOT use marachino cherries (uck!). I used lemon, orange, lime and kiwi....the kiwis were delish soaked in the sangria.  I also cut the sugar in half and will likely skip next time.  Used an Australian Shiraz.

Loved it! I followed recipe to the T except for the sugar. I dont like Too sweet drinks, and let it sit 24 hrs. After it was done marinating I tasted it and was like oh no. Citrus without enough sweet so i added some sugar and 7 Up. FABULOUS!!!! I made it for my daughters 21st birthday party and everyone loved it. I put out wine too and nobody touched it. I put a bowl of extra fruit out, strawberries, blueberries, lemons, limes and oranges for people to add as they like. My new favorite drink!

Love this recipe!  I don't use ginger ale OR the club soda, nor the frozen lemonade, but add some of the cherry juice. I add a little extra lemon juice and half the triple sec and make a simple syrup with the sugar, as it mixes together much better.  I also marinate the fruit int he punch 12-18 hours, then "muddle" to get the extra pulp and juice - discarding the rinds before they add bitterness to the sangria. I buy the Taylor Lake County red in the BIG bottle (less than $12 at Walmart) - and it is great. Be sure to drink on a full stomache, as this has quite a kick!

I've been making this for a couple of years after having it at a friend's party...you can't beat this recipe! But I make mine with white wine (it's so good I haven't tried the red yet!), usually a cheap pinot grigio--Barefoot is great! I don't add the sugar, but do use ginger-ale instead of club soda. Like so many others have said, DEFINITELY make the night before...it needs time for the flavors to marinate. I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could!

Being clueless about red wine (I drink white) I bought the cheapest I could find (Gallo Cabernet Savignon).  I also had to improvise because I realized I didn't have the brandy OR the triple sec I though I had.  SO, instead I used burbon and orange flavored tequila that I had on hand.  Instead of the sugar I used sweet & low and added extra as I like my sangria just a little bit sweeter.  I marinated overnight (including the cherries) and it was the single best sangria I'd ever had.  I did NOT add the carbonated soda as it was perfect without.  I took the rest over to my dad, the sangria affectionado and he also proclaimed it the best ever....and we fought over the 'marinated' cherries.  If I can make it with tequila and burbon and still have it be phenomenal, how would it be if I followed with brandy and triple sec????  I need to find out!  I removed the fruit on my second batch--after leaving the citrus slices in for 48 hours my first batch started turning bitter.  This is definitely the new party drink at our house!

Excellent recipe! My guests were thanking me while drinking up the two batches I made. I used rum instead of brandy and sprite (omitted the sugar) instead of carbonated water. Also, I bought Trader Joe's Merlot wine ($1.99 a bottle!) I made the evening before my gathering and placed in a punch bowl. It made a very nice centerpiece with the fruit (apples/pears/orange slices) in it. I will definitely make again for the Holidays.

I made this to serve 50 at my housewarming pool party.  Instead of the recommended amt of brandy, I did half brandy and half peach schnapps.  Also, instead of sugar, I added a big jar of maraschinos with the juice, plus the recommended amt of soda (I used Sprite Zero.)  If I did it again I would only slice up one each of the citrus fruits-- I sliced about 4 of each and even that was too much perhaps because I served it in a beverage jar with a spigot at the bottom, instead of a punch bowl or pitcher, so people didn't have access to the fruit.  I had about 40 people at the party and the sangria was a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe and for all the suggestions!  Will definitely make again!

Made this for a dinner party last night w/ a cuban menu...it was WONDERFUL sangria!!  I doubled the recipe.  The only thing I did a little different was to use Splenda & pineapple juice in place of the sugar.  I will definitely be making this again & again!  Enjoy:)

I'm thrilled to have found this recipe.  We have about 50 bottles of yucky homemade red wine that no one will drink.  I used it with this recipe and it's fantastic!  Definitely try to make ahead.  I also skipped the carbonated water and sugar, and just gave my guests the options to add some sprite to their glass if they wish.  A huge hit, will make a lot this summer..thanks!

Awesome!  Made this last night for a cookout at our house and it was a hit - not a drop left!  I doubled the recipe and omitted the sugar.  I had cans of sprite zero sitting next to the pitcher sangria for guests to add if they desired.   Without the sprite it was very strong .    I added sprite to mine and it was perfect.

I made two batches - one with club soda and one without.  I think that I liked it better with the club soda.  I think it could have used more brandy, and I was glad that I didn't add the sugar!  It was really good!

This was amazing sangria! The BEST I've ever had, let alone made myself. I made twice as much but substituted brandy with rum and used gingerale. I took it to a BBQ and we couldn't stop talking about it! I've passed this recipe on to everyone who was there.

This is definitely the best sangria I have ever had (and I have tried many)!  I made two batches, one with a cabernet and one with a chardonnay, both were fabulous!  I didn't use the sliced fruit suggested or the cherries, instead I cut up oranges and granny smith apples into bite size pieces.  I added the sugar as suggested, but left out the carbonated water. This drink was the hit of the party, everyone wanted the recipe!  Thanks HJacoby!

This recipe is very similar to one that I use for holiday parties and other events...Its great and always a big hit. The only thing I do different is substitute white rum for the brandy, double the oj and omit the leamonade concentrate, and add pineapple slices instead of cherries!!! The great thing about sangria is that you can really make it your own by adding a variety of different ingredients!

Good sangria!  Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  I usually add blackberry or peach brandy to my sangria which gives it a great flavor.  NOTE:  Adding the orange, lime and/or lemon overnight will impart a bitter sour taste to your Sangria.  Add the fruit right before serving!  Enjoy!!!

We had a Sangria taste-off. I used this recipe and my "authentic" friend from Panama used his grandfather's recipe. I won.
I use blackberry brandy and the cheapest bottles of wine. I also let it sit in the fridge THEN freeze. Why? I have large parties and never know how much of this to make. So I make six batches and freeze. I put a frozen section into my punch bowl and pour Sierra Mist over the top and it gets slushy. (Alcohol doesn't really freeze solid.). I then add fresh oranges and raspberries. (I have also added fruit at stage one and frozen it. That allows the berries to soak up the alcohol; I prefer fresh berry taste vs. laden with brandy.)
Making it ahead allows me to focus on other things the week of the party, knowing my Sangria is done. Everyone asks me for this recipe. I claim it as my own. :)

I've used this recipe as printed and I've played around with it based on the ingredients I have on-hand and it's always been delicious!  I don't usually use the maraschino cherries. I've used peach schnapps and/or triple sec. Brandy is a must. I've added plums, peaches, strawberry, pineapple, etc. I always add some cranberry/raspberry juice (about a 1/2 cup) and I use a can of ginger ale that I add right before serving as suggested.  And I don't ever add sugar. You really can't go wrong using the basics of this recipe and tweaking it to make it your own.  You will want to double the recipe if you are having company. It goes so fast!  Thanks for sharing.

Wanted to make this Sangria for Christmas Eve so we did a "trial batch" first.   We love it!!  Hubby hunted for a recipe that would be a keeper and this is it!!!  We used half the sugar recommended and it really was sweet enough.  For those wanting a little fizz and a tad more sweetness we topped each glass individually with 7Up.  This is now our official Sangria recipe!!

Too much citrus as-is. Added more cherries and less citrus the second time around and was much better.

Wow, Wow, Wow!!  So delicious and strong but not too strong.  the changes I made: 1/4 cup sugar; gingerale added just before serving; chilled w/out fruit for 24 hrs. prior (added the fruit 9 hrs, prior to serving); added the cherry juice from the cherry jar; only 1/2 cup lemon juice.  LOVED it! thank you for sharing and thank you to all the other reviewers for helping me pick his recipe :) oh, I used a nice orange liqueur instead of triple-sec...taste better

I have been making this recipe for about 2 years. Everyone loves it and insists that I bring it to every gathering. I attempted a version with rum and was quickly told to stick to the brandy version. I cheat a bit and add the Costco brand sangria with sweet red wine since I prefer a sweeter version. I started with the original recipe and have tweaked it over the years with different flavored brandy i.e. peach, apricot, cherry, blackberry, you get the point. It’s much better when you let it sit overnight. It’s absolutely delicious and will sneak up on you if you’re not careful.

I use this recipe alot to make Sangria. I agree that the brandy is very important. The one thing I do different is take 3/4 c light rum and soak the fruit and 1/4 c sugar over night. Use the rum in the Sangria! Yum Yum

Great recipe, always a hit at parties.  I've noticed when I bring a batch to a party at which others have also brought sangria, mine always goes first.

Really great sangria!! I didn't have all of the brandy, but it still came out perfectly. You definitely need to add a touch of ginger ale on the top. I will definitely make it again!

I made this last weekend and it was FABULOUS!  As suggested in another review, I replaced the brandy for rum, the triple sec for peach schnapps and completely left out the sugar.  It was fabulous, not too sweet and very refreshing!!!!  I just made it again today for another BBQ tonight and am looking forward to sharing it!

I finally found the best sangria recipe. I did read the comment and instead of putting triple sec, I used peach schnaps. I also added cinnamon. Can't wait for the pool party to begin. They will LOVE it!

Ding ding ding ding ... we have a winner! 

My wife, daughter, and daughter-in-law are big sangria fans - especially in the summer. I made this over the weekend, and it was a huge hit. I didn't have limes or cherries so I substituted a frozen margarita mix for the lemonade concentrate. That gave it the lime flavor, and I don't think we missed the cherries. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly using the club soda instead of ginger ale.

Great recipe! We'll be doing it again. Thanks HJACOBY!

Was a big hit at a recent grad party.  I used *cheap* red wine and tossed in whatever random frozen fruit I had in the freezer (a berry blend, plus strawberries), in addition to the lemons, limes, and oranges. I left out the maraschino cherries and ran out of lemon juice on my second batch, so I just added more OJ.  Instead of carbonated water, I used Sierra Mist.  Yummy, and made a ton, too!

This is the easiest, delicious drink recipe I've ever made.  I made it as the recipe states the first time and it was delicious.  Then I started playing around, this is the beauty of this recipe: you can swap out things and get a completely different flavor.  I now use frozen limeade instead of lemonade, I add the full bottles of liquor instead of half, and a lot of fruit.  It's great after it's chilled a bit in the fridge, but it's FANTASTIC after it's "cured" for 24 hours... it's hard though :)  I usually fill a glass 3/4 full then top off with either Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist, or a fruity pop for a little fizz.  Just watch it, it sneaks up on you :)

Excellent recipe just ommitted carb water and sugar and used ginger ale before serving. I also used Lambrusco instead of a dry red wine. I also put apples in mine. A huge hit though, loved it!!!!

Awesome!  I had several "partial bottles" of light rum, dark rum, triple sec and added them all.  I also added some pomegranate schnapps...yummy!  An easy recipe to tweak!

I LOVED this sangria!  I made it for our house warming party, and scaled it to 50 servings.  I used a sweeter red wine, and cut out some of the sugar.  I also added some apple pieces.  Everyone LOVED it, even my sister and mother who don't drink.  Great Recipe!  Cant wait to make it again!!

This was incredible!  I have a huge sweet tooth but didn't need any sugar at all.  I did accidently dump in too much lemonaid concentrate but I think this is a very flexible recipe that you can have fun with.  Thanks for sharing.

Definately some of the best sangria I've had. I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it. Next time I'm going to let it sit for two nights instead of one because I had some leftover and drank it the next day and it was even better!

We have made this countless times and everyone always loves it!  I don't always use all of the fruit that it calls for, and I tend to skip the sugar but instead add Sprite - though I have followed the recipe to the letter, and it is great either way - just personal preference on taste.  Definitely a keeper!

GREAT sangria recipe! I have adapted the fruits some and use nectarines, apples, and oranges in the mix and add a slice of lemon to the edge of the glass so that the citrus rides with every sip. I have used this recipe to make sangria for a lot of summer parties and everyone just loves it.  Allowing to sit overnight/over 12 hours is definitely key. I have adapted the recipe slightly, and this is what I've found really brings out all the flavors. I mix the fruit with the brandy, sugar, and triple sec 2 days beforehand. Then the next day I add the orange juice, lemon juice, lemonade concentrate, and red wine. Then I mix the carbonated water individually for each drink the next day. Makes for a wonderfully refreshing summer drink!

This was ok, but I felt it had the flavor of the orange & lemon rinds which made it bitter.  It was better with served with ginerale.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I used orange curacao instead of triple sec and used only one can of ginger ale without sugar. We had everyone asking for seconds and more!

Wonderful! Brilliant! I tweaked it slightly, made double the amount in the recipe but added to the mix: 4 chopped oranges, 2 chopped apples, half a litre strawberries and a little gingerale (prior to serving) Let all the ingredients soak overnight in the fridge. Everyone loved it! :-D

Love this recipe!  Peach schnapps instead of triple sec is good. It can also make a great take along to a potluck.  Make in a ziploc bag the night before, put in a cooler, then pour into a pitcher with a little ice and club soda at your destination.

Like most people, I dropped the sugar and carbonated water in favor of ginger ale, and let it sit for a day. I made a double batch, and it was gone long, long before the wine, beer, and margaritas were.

I have made this recipe twice, and it turned out great both times.  The first time I followed the recipe but used rum instead of brandy (because I had it on hand).  I also added a pear to the fruit mix and left out the sugar.  Turned out great!  The second time my fiance added the whole can of lemonade concentrate instead of 1/3 a cup so we didn't add any ginger ale or carbonated water and it was still good!  It got great reviews from all who tried it.

So over the many times that I have made this recipe my aunt and I have made it to our liking: use blackberry brandy  use frozen raspberry lemonade concentrate leave out the sugar (way too sweet with it) mix everything together and pour into the glasses then add a little of the cherry juice and the carbonated water to each glass instead of the whole pitcher.  We usually omit the lemons and limes because we dont have them around as often.

This was a great recipe!  I made a few changes - no sugar, cherries or water.  But I did add Malibu coconut rum and fresh lemonade instead of frozen.  I think it would taste equally as good with spiced rum or peach schnapps as someone else suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic!  I love the way the fruit mellows the wine and the wine mellows the fruit - such great compliments to each other.  I made pretty much exactly as is except i omitted the cherries and the triple sec.  i also omitted the sugar as the lemonade concentrate is sweet enough for my tastes.  W/out the sugar and triple sec, its the perfect amount of semi-sweetness...not too much as to not be refreshing but just enough to make it a treat.  I took the suggestion of adding the soda as i was serving it for a little bit of fizz.  I made with Carnitas for a going away dinner - guests were very impressed as this is a very "fancy" yet easy beverage to serve - very fun!  Can't wait to make again.

I've never made sangria before, and I've had a few good ones and more bad ones at restaurants. I followed the reviewers' advice and used peach schnapps instead of triple sec, 7UP instead of soda water/sugar, and included raspberries. I made two batches and it was really really good! Even my friends who don't like wine or sweeter drinks enjoyed this...even my non-drinking mother had some and loved it!

This is a great recipe for Sangria.  Do refrigate it overnight because that makes it sooo much better.  Very smooth.  Good the first day but GREAT the second.  I did subsititure Grenadine for the sugar - adds the sweetness and enhances the color.  Definitely add the club soda right before serving - gives it a sizzle!

I had high hopes for this sangria for our July 4th party, but unfortunately it was a dud.  :-( Maybe it was the rain...but no one really raved about it or came back for more.

This is a fantastic recipe! I tripled the recipe but cut the sugar by half and left a bottle of ginger ale and a bottle of club soda next to the dispenser (a 3-gallon clear container with a spigot at the bottom and an opening at the top for the ladle) in case anyone wanted to lighten it up.

First time making Sangria.  Was a hit at dinner.  Doubled the recipe for 6 people and ran out halfway through.  Should at least triple if you have some sangria lovers / heavy drinkers.  Used half the brandy, and 3/4 of ginger ale (instead of carbonated water) called for.  No lemon juice, used more frozen lemonade instead.  No sugar.

I loved this!!  I made it exactly as is EXCEPT that I omitted the sugar.  I don't like super sweet drinks and I found that omitting the sugar made it taste perfect for me.  I used merlot for the wine.  I made it for a party and it was a huge hit- however it was very potent!  But in a good way.  I will definitely be making this again- this weekend in fact!

SO YUMMY!!!!  You need to definately at least double the recipe.  One batch is not enough!  I didn't try it with the soda.  I like it non-carbonated.  Can't wait to make it again!

I wanted to make a drink for my housewarming party and my husband sugested a Sangria.  I am not a wine drinker so I did a little research and ended up using 2 large bottles of Shiraz Cabernet and quadrupled the recipe. The only thing I left out was the lemon juice, I had only bought one lemon to slice up and since I used the frozen lemonaid I figured it would be ok.  I also took note of some of other comments and added some cherry juice.  I made this the night before and added the ginger ale before serving.  The Sangria got raving complments,  it was the hit of the party and there was not a drop left!  Definitley a keeper, I can't wait to make this on a warm summer night!!

Excellent sangria recipe! Made it for a shower today and it got great reviews. Didn't change a thing, but we didn't add any fizz because I prefer sangria that way.

Great. Great. Great.  Made it a day ahead of time to have the flavors blend, but me and my husband couldn't wait so we drank half of it the night before our party.  I had to put together another batch before and during the party.  i also added apples b/c i made it in the winter.  I would most likely make this again in the summer and add peaches and grapes.  I also used Seltzer water cut down on the sweetness.

This recipe is the best.  I have made it many times with different types of wine (I think Merlot is my favorite), and it always disappears right away.  I do add the sugar, but I omit the carbonated water.  I think it is best about 2 hours after you make it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent Sangria!  Left out the frozen lemonade (didn't have any) so I increased the sugar and lemon juice.  It was delicious.  Double batch was gone within an hour.  Be ready...this is so tasty its easy to forget how potent it is!

YUMMY! I also added apples..followed entire recipe but no carbonated water..it was perfect, sweet but not too sweet. I had another recipe last wk and it was awful! this is the right combo..I used Lambrussco for the wine, I know you can pretty much use whatever but I like specifics and this wine worked perfectly and was recommended.

I made this for a baby shower and had many requests for the recipe. One guest told me that she tried 6 or 7 recipes and this was the best she has had. I agree.

This Stuff is Fantastic! I followed the recipe.  Put in lots of fruit, let it set over night, added ginger ale right before I served it. It was a huge hit.  Even my mom, who doesn't drink much liked it.

Was trying to find an intersting drink to serve at my wedding. Adapted a bit and made berry sangria instead. Added frozen strawberry and raspberry juice. Then, put in some berry arbor mist with rose wine. Diluted it with strawberry sparkling water. Put some frozen strawberries and raspberries for an added touch. Anyone that gets married requests my berry sangria!

I made this recipe for my sisters bridal shower.  I was very excited since the reviews were so great.  I was pretty disappointed.  It was very tart.  I added ginger ale and some extra sugar and used a Merlot.  I'm going to try another batch tonight and use less lemon.  Hopefully that will work out better.

Delicious! After the first batch finished people asked for more. It is a quick fix and very tasty. I substituted Lemon/Lime soda for the carbonated water and it was great if you like a sweet drink.

Made this for a neighborhood pool party and everyone loved it. A very forgiving recipe, followed the recipe until I found I had another bottle of opened red wine so threw it in along with a some of the other ingredients, let it sit all day and served it up.

SO SO good.  I added apples.  I poured in a glass with frozen grapes (no ice needed that way) about 3/4 wine to 1/4 sprite.

I had never made Sangria before...but always wanted to.  I stumbled upon this recipe in the Summer of 2008.  I make it with my sister (it's our new backyard BBQ ritual) and we vary it each time.  Our guest feel that our Summer gatherings are just not complete without this EXCELLENT beverage.

This is the best Sangria!  Made it with Merlot, however any dry red wine will do.  The brandy gives it a "kick" so it is a bit strong at first so do let it sit if you can.  Have served it immedately after making it with no complaints :)

Did not like.  Used top quality ingredients and it wasn't good.  Not a good balance of ingredients, way too tart.  Probably won't make again.  If I do, I'll make  adjustments.

We made this for a housewarming party to serve with margaritas and chicken fajitas.  Went over very well.  We made it the night before so the fruit could release all of its flavor into the liquid.  I think we ended up tripling the recipe and had to make it in empty milk jugs for storage. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night for my book club ladies...7 outta 8 loved this drink! I used apricot brandy and peach schnapps and added strawberries…no sugar.   I had club soda and ginerale on hand as mixers per the other reviews.  Most went with club soda.  The one gal who didn’t care for it said it was just to sweet for her…even mixing with the club soda.  I can tell you I am not feeling my best today because I kept going back for more. I tripled this recipe and ran out…this is a keeper!

Everyone I serve this Sangria to asks for the recipe.  Absolutely fantastic!  I tend to skip the concentrate since it's too sweet for my liking.  Better make extras -- even the men love this one!

Awesome!  My husband and I made this for our family this summer and it was an instant vacation favorite.  We used apricot brandy instead of regular and it turned out really well.  We had to make it a second night because everyone loved it so much.

This was fantastic. I did make the night before. I did not add the sugar as it was sweet enough. I also did not add the club soda or Sprite to the entire batch. Rather, I mixed in individual glasses. Therefore, if people wanted it sweeter I mixed w/Sprite...if not I mixed with club soda. This was a big hit at my 4th of July party...doubling the recipe makes a gallon...I made 3!

I followed this almost exactly, but I changed the fruit up a bit. I used some fresh peaches and I cut down a bit on the limes and lemon. I also cut the sugar in half...not as necessary with the sweeter fruit. I served this party and it was gone in a flash...DELICIOUS!

YUMMY! Made it last weekend as an adult alternative beverage at my son's 14th b-day party and it was delicious! Used Cap't Morgan's pineapple rum, cheap grocery store merlot and pineapple/orange juice instead of plain OJ. For fruit used: oranges, limes, lemons, strawberries and cherries. Soaked fruit overnight in the rum and sugar and added the wine and OJ a couple of hours prior to serving. Definitely a keeper. I started another batch of fruit soaking but didn't need it so I put it in a large ziploc bag and tossed it in the freezer to thaw and make another day. I plan on using it this weekend!

This was very good! My guests really liked it and it was easy to put together. I made it only hours before my party and it was still good. Definitely would be better the next day though. I'll keep this one on hand for our next "happy hour". Thanks!

I liked this sangria, but I like the recipe that I normally use better. There was a lot of this left over at my party which is NOT normal for sangria! LOL

This drink would cost a small fortune if I had to buy brandy, triple sec, etc.  I have had Sangria in Spain and I can tell you it was absolutely delish without all the added liqeurs. Liquor may be quicker but simpler is better.

WOW!  I made this for a barbeque two days ago and its already known as the "infamous sangria."  I can see this getting made for years to come.  I left out the sugar and used all the juice from the jar of maraschino cherries.  Be warned: this will sneak up on you!

this recipe is fantastic! I used a sweet red wine, peach brandy, peach slices, pineapple slices, pear slices, and I added a cup of lemon-lime club soda just before serving. Everyone loved it!

This was great! I used Robert Mondavi Merlot for the dry red and everyone loved it.  If you want a party hit - definitely make this one - best sangria I've had.

I made this on two separate occassions over the summer and everyone loved it.   I omitted the soft drink, it's a lot stronger without it. I also added apples to the mix.  Update: I made this with Gallo Hearty Burgundy wine and because it's naturally sweet, sugar isn't necessary.

FABULOUS!!!  Served it at my daughter's wedding and it disappeared in a flash and everyone raved about  it. I made some substitutions/changes:  NO maraschino cherries or sugar water.  I used lime flavored tonic water instead of 7-up or gingerale.  The key to this  is the wine...the Rioja was fabulous.  I think marinating it with the fruit 24 hrs. in advance  is  also key.  I only used oranges, lemons and limes.  Can't wait to make it again.

I really like sangria and this was an awesome recipe.  My only advice is make A LOT becuase it goes quick!  I took another reviewer's advice and used giner ale instead of club soda and it was very good!  I tripled the recipe and still needed to make more!!!  I will definately be making this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing it!!!

WOW - Superb!  Served this tonight for a Cuban-themed dinner for six friends and the two batches weren't quite enough, so we hit a bottle of red wine after we ran out of the Sangria!  I loved the brandy and triple sec and don't think I'd substitute those.  I omitted the sugar and added Diet 7-UP instead of carbonated water.  Even the red-wine hater asked for more!!  The best new recipe I've gotten in awhile - thanks!!

Double batch was all gone!  Left out the sugar and used ginger ale.  Big hit.  Only refrigerated for about 5 hours, and was still really good.  Will definitely plan ahead next time, as I am sure that it's even better after sitting overnight.

Incredibly good! I went to 2 stores and couldn't find triple sec so I just left it out. The only other thing I changed was another reviewers suggestion to add gingerale instead of carbonated water. I served this at a ladies' night and it was a big hit! There are already requests for upcoming summer parties! Just be careful because it definitely packs a punch!!

This was delicious. I used peaches instead of cherries.

Also, I used a pineapple Mexican soda that I found in individual bottles in the Mexican aisle of the grocery store in lieu of the optional carbonated beverage. 

It really came out fantastic.

I think this is a five-star sangria, but I would recommend using a good wine.  My not-so-good wine made it more like a 3-4 star sangria.  Oops!

Leaving it for 12 to 24 hours is the key.  Everything has to 'steep'.  This is an excellent recipe.

I would not make this again..needs more sugar, too many lemon stuff. It has lemon juice, lemonade concentrate, 2 lemons and lime, that was way too much. I let it sit over night and it was very tarty. I put club soda into it to see if it made a difference, it did not. I wasted a bottle of red wine. I would not be making this again. I will look somewhere for best sangria recipes.

This recipe is awesome!  I've made it for 3 parties and it is a hit every time! The frozen lemonade concentrate and sugar makes it sweet enough. It does NOT need ginger ale. I use the carbonated water instead, just before serving. The recommended amount of brandy is good, but taste it to see if it's "strong" enough for you and your guests...know your audience though...this stuff can sneak up on you ;-)

I'm not one to write reviews, but I've used this recipe over 20 times and since I rely on others' reviews I'll do my part and share my experience.  This is the best Sangria recipe I've found.  Everyone i make it for raves about it, usually giving me credit.  I find that if you let it marinate it's actually best the 2nd day.  Also, I don't use the club soda, just my preference I like mine stronger!  This is by far better than any Sangria you've ordered in a restaurant.

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of not adding the cherries, since I didn't have any on hand. It was out of this world! I used blackberry brandy and it was even better than the $14 a glass, blackberry sangria at our favorite restaurant. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It' absolutely delicious!

I tried this because of the review that said, "I was a nobody; and now I am famous for my sangria."  Now I am famous for my sangria also. I am in Mexico for the winter, so we don't have the limeade concentrate anywhere.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I only put in four tablespoons of sugar and it was better without the sparkling water I added to the top of the glasses on the first round.  The first time I made it, I used a Pinot Noir and it was perfect. The second time I made it, I used a Malbec. A little dryer and darker in color. I will stick with the Pinot for this recipe. I did not use cherries, but added a plum, a peach and strawberries to the citrus. I doubled the recipe for 8 people and everyone loved it.  I didn't realize there were so many recipes for Sangria.  This one was fine and you really can't make a mistake, unless you make it too sweet.

This is the 2nd time making this recipe and I made a double batch and used 1/2 c of spiced rum and 1/2 cup of Brandy.  I also used Italian sparkling lemonade instead of club soda and added frozen pineapple to this batch and must say it turned out fantastic!

Delicious sangria. We used a little more brandy and a little less sugar. No club soda for us. We will make again soon for our friends.

This was delicious! First time to make sangria and it was a hit. Made exactly as is except for used an orange liqueur instead of triple sec. So yummy! Used a cheap brandy and $3 bottle of wine. Definitely making for future parties!

I've been using this recipe for a few years now and it has definitely spoiled me!! It's the ONLY sangria I'll drink--better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant and better than any other recipe I've tried.  I'm always disappointed when I try other sangrias because they just pale in comparison since this one has so much flavor and complexity.  I typically use blackberry brandy and a merlot and I don't like it sweet, so I skip the sugar.  It's definitely better the second day, so if I'm doing it for a party or something I make sure to make it ahead.  Thank you so much for this HJACOBY :)

Made a triple batch for my graduation party, it was gone within the first few hours.  Everyone loved it and was asking how i made it.

I followed the recipe but with a few minor changes:  
I added an apple, a pear, and a pineapple (with the juice). 
I used a blackberry brandy and triple sec.  
I left out the sugar (it's sweet enough without it.  If some prefer a sweeter sangria, add a shot of triple sec to the glass before serving). 
 I let it sit in the fridge for over 24 hours  and added seven-up just before serving. I did add ice to it, and it didnt seem to water it down at all.   When I ran out, I just poured in more wine, brandy and triple sec and it was almost as good as the original batch.  If you're looking for a knock-your-socks off Sangria recipe, THIS IS IT.

I love this recipe and so do my friends who help me drink it! 
I've never actually used the lemon juice as it's not something I have handy. I use the gingerale instead of sugar and carbonated water. I use orange juice and cran-raspberry in the quantities for the juice and concentrate. I use triple sec and blackberry brandy. And...so far... rave reviews and requests for the recipe every time I make it. Thanks for sharing!

I wish more people had mentioned if they used the optional ingredients. I added the sugar and probably didn't need to.  So, because of that, we definitely ended up cutting the sweetness with some seltzer. I'd recommend no sugar and then hopefully you wouldn't need the seltzer.  Overall it was good, but people definitely said it was a sweeter kind of Sangria. I used the Roijo that someone recommended. Maybe I'd try a different kind next time. Also, I would cut the rounds in half. The orange rounds were too big for the cups.

Ive made this twice now, first time I doubled it and people complained I didn't make enough so second time I quadrupled it and it worked perfectly. I add every fruit I can put my hands on around the house, apples, pears, frozen berries, you name it. I also use peach schnapps instead of the triple sec. LOVE the recipe.

don't bother with the extras like the sugar and carbonated water. i don't even use the maraschino cherries. the drink stands well enough alone with the mixed ingredients and fresh fruit slices. simply delicious.

Just made this receipe for the Labour Day weekend.  I had to make a second pitcher of it, as it was a great success.  We had purchased beer for the guys, and thought this would be a fantastic drink for the ladies...well, all the men loved it too!!!

I substitued lemon juice for lemonchella, and triple sec for peach schnapps.

I will definitely be making this sangria again and again! 

Best receipe....I have to admit, my best Sangria was in Barcelona, but now, this actually may have beaten that!!!

Enjoy all!!!

Super yummy - used Blackberry Brandy - 1/2 the sugar and a Rasberry Seltzer!  A huge hit - only let it sit for 6 hours and it was fabulous.  I just say this so people won't skip by it if they want to make it last minute! Will make again and let sit over night to see if it improves.  Oh - and don't bother making a single batch - you will need more!

We currently live in Spain... and this is goooood and similar to what you can find here. Very close to the real deal. We followed everything pretty closely. We did not have triple sec, so we omitted that. We DID add the carbonated water (1 full can) and white sugar to taste. Probably 1/4 cup??? Lastly... it needed a little extra something so we added a guzzle of tom collins mix (since it was in the fridge) BUT it would have been good without it! YUMMO

What a great drink for a summer LUAU! Good thing I bought extra ingredients. The first double batch that sat overnight in the fridge was the best sangria I've ever made or had. I used gingerale instead of club soda. I made several additional batches on the fly (total 9 gallons!) that were just as good. I scrubbed bottles of water, froze them and they worked great to keep the sangria cold without diluting it. Sangria and frozen water bottles were placed in a large beverage server with a spout/spiget. It was perfect and it looked amazing on the Tiki Bar.

This was so easy and delicious.  After reading reviews I swapped the brandy and triple sec for peach schnapps and rum.  Used 7up instead of the carbonated water.  I tripled the recipe and there was not a drop left!

This was a huge hit at my reccent BBQ. I could't even fill the bowl before people were coming back for seconds. I agree with some of the other reviews that it is best to let it sit for 24 hours before serving. All the flavors marinate then. I will definitely be making this for the girls trip later this year!

Best Sangria ever!!  This is a keeper I will definitely make again.  I made a double batch and it disappeared.  The only changes I made to the recipe was I didn't have any lemon juice so I substituted pineapple juice from canned pineapple chunks and I used Ginger Ale instead of Club Soda.  I also added additional fruit I had on hand which included apples, pineapple chunks, and oranges.

Skipped the sugar and used gingerale in place of the carb water.  I added a little cherry juice and chunks of pineapple.  Used cheap merlot for the wine.  I am basing the 5 stars off of what hubs and my father in law had to say- they both love red wine and they both loved this.  They were skeptical b/c Sangria is usually too sweet.  Leaving the sugar out worked for them.

OMG....this is the BEST sangria ever!!  I made it for a party, everyone loved it and constantly being asked to bring it to the next party or people asking for the receipe.  The only thing I did differently was omitted the sugar completely and used gingerale instead of carbonated water.  If you prefer an even less sweet drink then go with the carbonated water.  Perfect everytime.

I made this with a friend for the 4th. What a hit! Our guys loved it also. We didn't change a thing except to add more fruit and left out the sugar. We also couldn't wait it to drink it over night, but it was still delicious! Maybe the good wine was the trick to that?? Anyway, thanks for the recipe. It will get good use and make many people happy :-)

Used what I had on hand. Used blackberry brandy, along with peach schnapps. Added in lemon, lime, apple, and pears. Let it sit for a good 24hr. I then used ginger ale instead of a lemon soda.

I loved this recipe. The second and third time I made it I made some modifications: I eliminated the optional sugar and poured 1/8 cup of the maraschino cherry juice into the mixture. I used 3 cans of 7-Up instead of carbonated water, and floated 1 quart of rainbow sherbert on the top.  I colored some water in oleo tubs and froze it for ice. Very pretty; very tasty.

Simple, easy, delicious.  The hardest part was deciding on a good dry red wine.  I would suggest making a double batch if you're having friends over because it goes really FAST!

Great recipe!  Used peach schnapps instead of the triple sec, ginger ale instead of carbonated water, and left out the cherries.  Made the recipe for approximately 20 guests.  Super-easy preparation the night before.  It was a huge hit.

This was terrific!  I used Ginger Ale instead of the club soda, and Orange Liquer instead of Triple Sec.  I left out the sugar but added 3/4 cup of Peach Schnapps  I let everything sit overnight and this was SOOOO good the next day!   Thank you!

I made this recipe to serve runners in the South Okanagan Winery Association Half Corked Marathon (May 30).  I made a batch that used 24 bottles of wine.  Rave reviews from all the runners, and requests for the recipe.  Kudos to HJACOBY.

Very nice and refreshing. Very easy to make too! I used sprite, and i like how i could play with the flavor by adding more or less sprite in my cup... also yes it keeps tatsing better the longer the flavors have a chance to blend :)

So yummy!  Got rave review from all of our guests.  We like our sangria sweeter, so we used ginger ale and added the optional sugar.  We left out the marashino cherries, but followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  This was a perfect drink for a beautiful, sunny, warm evening.  We'll be making this a bunch this summer!

Everyone was raving about this. Made it on Mother's Day for a bapstism/combined with Mother's Day lunch reception. It was the only thing most people drank! I skipped the cherries and carbonated water/ginger ale but did use the sugar. Used a relatively cheap Cabarnet Sauvignon for the wine.

Excellent!!! I followed the suggestion of others here and left out the sugar, opting instead for gingerale.  Also added in fresh raspberries.  It definetly needs to hang out over night which is so hard to do but it so worth it! Everyone loved it but most importantly I LOVED IT!

This Sangria is really good. I have made it several times and depending on time & what I have on hand, I add or omit ingredients. Any way you make it, it's really tasty! As other reviewers have stated..go slow! it's so good it sneaks up on you!

This was so good!! I don't like wine so I was nervous but it was great. I made this for my birhday party and everyone loved it, my only advice is make lots of it because it goes fast. I made the recipe as is and added the sugar.

This is a great recipe.  I made it New Year's Eve for some friends and they all raved about it.  I did cut back on the sugar a little.  I am a little bit of a light weight so I added some Sprite to mine and it was fantastic!  Can't wait to make this during the summer!

I used ginger ale.  It seemed a little strong, but that may have been the wine I used.  We added ice to our glasses to "water down" a bit.  All in all, it was good and enjoyed by everyone.
UPDATE: Since my original review, I have made this several times. It has become a holiday tradition. I make two double batches the night before, and add ginger ale when it's time to serve. I've even added an extra bottle of wine when the quantity starts getting low to make it through the party! ;)

This recipe is great.  Every time I make this drink I run out so the last time I multiplied the amount by 5 ((I used a huge stockpot to chill overnight).  Here is a tip should you have leftovers, if you use fresh citrus with the rinds, remove them as they will cause the drink to become bitter.

I have never made nor tasted a better Sangria in my life. Every time I have made this my guests drink it like water. I cannot make enough of it. I usually make it exactly as written, minus the club soda, but I have used different fruit combinations, changed the amounts of sugar and/or juice based on what I have, and it still comes out perfect. I think the key is the balance between the brandy and the triple sec...mess with that and it doesn't taste quite the same. One thing is for sure is that you and your guests wil be loaded and happy.   One reviewer said "dangerous" and "excellent" in reference to this recipe. Agreed and agreed.

Oh so delicious :)  I left out the sugar also as I didn't want this to be like punch.  I added the club soda and glad I did because it lightened it a bit.  The punch bowl was empty by the time we finished our appetizers!

I was so hoping to love this recipe as there were lots of 5-star reviews, but honestly, I didn't like it. I tried making it twice. Once with Shiraz and once with Merlot. Not sure if it's because I used fresh-squeezed orange juice -- the oranges weren't the sweetest or tastiest, so maybe that's why.   I'm going to try the white peach sangria. Maybe that one would suit me better.

Followed recipe using fresh juices and did not include club soda.  Allowed to "marinate" for 24 hours.  Used cheap spanish red wine and cheap brandy.  Slightly sweet and very fruity.  Thanks!

This is always a hit. I eliminate the cherries, can't stand them, and add whatever fruit/berries I have laying around. Sliced pears, limes, oranges and whole blackberries is my favorite combination. If there's time, I like to make it the night before, and add cold ginger ale just before serving.

I made this for my Bunco group and the ladies were tipping up the punch bowl I served it in to get the last drop.  Several of the ladies attending swore upon entering the house they weren't big Sangria fans---this recipe made several converts!

I made a couple changes based on what I had around the house...still came out great/my husband said I have to make a big batch for when we have our 4th of July party next weekend. I left out the triple sec (did not have nay on hand/had plenty of booze without it/never noticed it was missing) and we had powdered lemonade mix around for the kids but not lemonade concentrate...so I subsituted the powdered lemonade mix. For the soda I used Sprite.Big hit!!

this was delish--and super strong!  The fruit does an awesome job of hiding exactly how intense this sangria is!  I added extra cherries.  we also used ginger ale instead of club soda.  Definitely let it all marinate over night . . . it tastes completely different (better) that way!  I used cheap box red wine (which is why I made sangria in the first place).  We didn't like the box wine, but it would've been alcohol abuse to throw it away, so I found this recipe to save it.  It worked!!! Thanks!

Deeeelicious! Served it to a group that included some former bartenders who have very high standards for beverages like this, and they agreed this was among the best sangria they've ever had.

I have made five batches of this recipe.  I use good brandy (VSOP), good OJ (not from concentrate) and good wine (the kind you would enjoy by itself).  I have never added the sugar or carbonated water.  This was the most popular drink at my last party (thus the five batches!)  This is a keeper!  P.S. This is NOT the Sangria I had in college.

This is a favorite in our household to serve at parties. We just recently had a Poker Party and all of our guests loved it! We made several gallons of this stuff and all of our guests were pleasantly tipsy and throwing their money out the window by the end of the night:)We also used ginger ale.  I got to say that it's not your traditional Sangria so if that's what you're looking for then maybe this recipe isn't the one for you.  But I'm not a huge fan of red wine to begin with, so adding all the other liquors and gingerale made it a bit sweeter for me.

I octupled this recipe for a birthday party and added 8 chopped granny smith apples, which I thought were pretty clutch.  Mmmm...I omitted the sugar and served with ginger ale and seltzer water optional.  It was a hit!  Not a drop left.  I also sliced half of the oranges in rounds but put in the rest in edible chunks and they were delicious.  I was a little short on brandy (used a 750 mL bottle, which was a little less than a cup short of what was called for) and I doubt that it made too much of a difference.  Would definitely make again!

HOLY MOTHER OF SILENUS! What a concoction. Fruity, flavorful and very very strong. Not that this needs any more alcohol added to it but it is also fantastic with champagne substituted for the club soda.

Great! I think I am still hungover from this wonderful sangria we made 2 nights ago! It was perfect with the Tortilla Espanola & Paella I made. We taste tested it without Gingerale first - it was terrific, then with Gingerale and it was terrific. Fun to make, fun to drink and looks so pretty! Thanks.

This is the best sangria I have had and everyone at my last party is insisting that I make it again for my son's rehearsal dinner this weekend. So I'm preparing to make a quad-duple batch! I followed the original recipe to the "t" but I did use another's suggestion of ginger ale instead of the sugar. Fabulous!

This recipe is amazing!  Honestly, I've never had any other sangria before, but everyone I served it to (3 different times) said it was fantastic.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used peach schnapps instead of triple sec.  I didn't use any cherries, but instead added blueberries, kiwis, and pineapples.  However, the pineapples were a bit iffy.  I guess they have some kind of special digestive enzyme in them and so they will do weird things to the sangria if you use a lot or if you add the juice as well.  I did both of these things once but it still tasted fine, just smelled a little ripe.  I made sure it was consumed the very next day.  Also, I think the cabonated water or 7-up really ruins this drink.  Try it without or let people choose if they want to add it or not.

This is an excellent drink.  I had never made Sangria before but was suprised how easy it was to make.  I have made this several times now because I keep getting asked to bring it to parties. I omitted the sugar and just used key lime flavored carbonated water to each glass I served and I omitted the cherries and added some sliced apples.  Thanks for a great recipe

This is the best sangria recipe yet! It is comparable to the one at my favorite Portuguese restaurant. As other reviewers suggested, I used Sprite (instead of sugar and carbonated water) to sweeten. I also used some of the maraschino cherry juice to sweeten it, as well. I didn't have oranges, but I cut up some strawberries to add. You can easily drink a lot of this because it does not have a strong alcohol taste. Be careful not to drink too much; the next day is a bit rough. :)

I just made this for a party over the weekend. It was very easy to make, and everyone loved it. I started with a double batch and ended up having to make another batch during the party because it went so quickly. I followed the suggestion of others and omitted the sugar and used diet Sprite instead of club soda.

We made three batches of this sangria for our Memorial Day party, and it was the favorite drink.  The only change we made was to use diet Sprite instead of carbonated water.  Otherwise, everything was the same - to the measurement in the recipe.

This is a perfect summer drink!

I drank the entire pitcher & now I don't remember if it was good or not.  Maybe I should try it again?  Just kidding.  It was excellent.  I wish I had omitted the sugar like others suggested though.  The first glass was a little too sweet for my liking - after the first glass though, I didn't notice it as much.

I made this for an anniversary party and everybody loved it.  The only changes I made were I didn't have any brandy so I used rum and I threw in the juice from the cherries.  Very good recipe!

I, luckily, added the carbonated water to a glass instead of the pitcher. I really didn't like it, so I would recommend trying that first. I also found this to be very strong (maybe because I left out the water? so adding more juice or something to compensate might be a good idea).

Love this!  Made it for a get together and even one of my fiance's buds snuck one in between his beers.  Topped it off with a little 7Up instead of the sugar.  Also used fresh cherries since I had them.  Would definitely make again.

I made 4 pitchers of this for christmas and it was a hit. I omitted the sugar. I added juices from pineapple chunks, cherry juice, I added oranges, limes and lemons. I used the triple sec and added
ginger ale. It was great 2 and 3 days later. Made it again for New Years. the liquor store recommended Taylor Lake Country Red in a giant Jug and cheap. It worked really really well. will make this again and again.

AMAZING! I love sangria, so there was no doubt I would enjoy this. I was so excited when my guests adored it too. The men were too "manly" to try it, but 3 girls (including myself) downed 2 batches. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe, just a few modifications.  Used spiced dark rum instead of brandy, a little sugar, no triple sec, more cherries and fruit, and no carbonated beverages.  A nice smooth sangria everyone loved!

This is the best sangria I have ever had. I did not use the carbonated water but did add 2 cans of gingerale and most definitely needs to sit at least overnight. Thanks for this definite keeper.

This is the best Sangria ever!  I've made this several times already.  The only changes I make are to leave out the sugar and cherries (don't like 'em), then serve mixed with ginger ale.  Beware - make 2x what you THINK you need because this goes fast!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have never made a Sangria before.  This was the first time having one and it was lovely.  I did add some ginger ale to my glass just to calm the strong taste a little.  I used Rosemount Shiraz wine.  I also used apricot brandy and a little rum added as well.  It marinated in the fridge for a day.  My boyfriend didnt care for it so I had to drink it all by myself.  It would be a great summer drink to take to cookouts!

I used this recipe to make sangria for the first time. It was sooooooo good. As some reviewers suggested, I omitted the sugar and used ginger ale in place of the carbonated water. I also added apples, peaches and plums. I made a pretty big batch and am happy to say it disappeared. Yummy!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday party, and it was fantastic!!!  I used four bottles of wine to make two 1-gallon pitchers.  I used rum instead of brandy and peach schnapps instead of triple sec.  In addition to the lemons, limes, oranges, and cherries, I also added pineapple chunks.  I omitted the lemonade concentrate and sugar, but added some of the cherry juice.  I let it sit overnight.  Also, I did not add carbonated water or soda to the Sangria, but had it on hand.  When serving, I mixed half gingerale with half Sangria in the glass for most people, but some of our more seasoned drinkers preferred it by itself or mixed with Red Bull.  The pineapple did NOT taste good when eaten, so I won't add it next time, but the oranges and cherries were to die for!  Great recipe!

I have never made Sangria and with all of the recipes out there I had a hard time choosing which one to make.  My best friend suggested this one.  I did not ad any sugar, but did add fresh nectarines in with the fruit.  All I can say is watch out...this stuff has  one heck of kick.

A fantastic recipe - it was gone at no time in my party.  I originally tripled the recipe, but still had to make another triple batch in the middle of the party because it was gone in under 30 minutes.  I didn't use the carbonated water, and let it sit overnight - delicious!

Excellent!  I omitted the lime slices and added peaches which was super yummy.  Instead of sugar I used honey and sweetened lime juice instead which gave it a nice flavor.  Next time I think I'm going to try using Oporto instead of Cabernet and then it will have the natural sweetness of the wine.  This was a huge success, I would recomment it to anyone!

This was a big hit at our thanksgiving dinner. We made a double double batch, used red table wine in a box and added a bit more liquor. Everyone loved it and knew which drink was theirs by which combo of fruit was in their glass.

We made this recently for a pool party and it was a hit.  Everyone enjoyed it.  We didn't wait the 2 hours before drinking it and it was still very good.  We used Merlot wine and rum (had it on hand).  We will make this again and again.

Easy and delicious...everyone wanted the recipe.  I omitted the sugar and cherries and didn't dilute with seltzer or club soda.  To a batch made with chardonnay, I added the lemonade concentrate, and to a merlot batch I used the limeade concentrate.  Yummy.

This was FANTASTIC! I made it for a tapas dinner party and it went over famously. I followed the advice of others and used gingerale in place of the club soda. Very addictive! Makes for a good party! Thank you!!!

This sangria was excellent. I omitted the sugar, the cherries, added peach schnapps and gingerale instead of  carbonated water. A summer keeper!

The brandy and triple sec add a flavorful twist (and some kick!) to this recipe. I used a cabernet and omited the sugar and cherries for a tangy, dry sangria.

I made a couple adjustments I peeled the limes in efforts of preventing the bitter oils from infusing since I was making it the day before- and I think it did the trick, several compliments were made about how it didn’t have a bitter taste like their recipe has. (YAY!)   2) we didn’t have a regular brandy so I used Tuaca instead since it is made with Brandy, 3) I used a cheap red blend wine ($4.97/bottle), 4) totally forgot to get the cherries, but it didn’t affect the taste apparently!  I made a gallon and took it down to the docks for our Cinco de Mayo potluck and it was a hit! I should have made 3 Gallons!  This is my go-to recipe now!

I made six batches of this for a party and it was a hit! Had about 15 guests and it was gone by midnight! Could have made even more! Followed the recipe almost to a t except I added a frozen tropical fruit mix and used 1 cylinder of frozen pineapple juice. I did not and would not recommend adding the optional cups of white sugar unless you want to give your guests an even more excruciating headache in the morning. Trust me it’s sweet enough. I also used pretty much the cheapest wine and liquor I could find and it was still great so don’t worry if you’re on a budget. Overall fantastic recipe!

I'd been using a Bobbie Flay sangria recipe for years which was usually a hit, but I wanted to try something new for my cousin's 18th annual Oktoberfest party this past weekend in PA. I checked out this recipe and decided to make it... I quadrupled the recipe to make 24 servings (2 (12-serving) batches). I followed the recipe closely MINUS the sugar and cherries. I also omitted the club soda/ginger ale. I used Trader Joe's fresh-squeezed OJ. I also hand-squeezed 2 lemons and 2 limes per 12-serving batch; I do this because I find when you add lemons and limes sliced up, the rinds make the sangria bitter. I added fresh apples and oranges but I removed the orange rinds (same reason as mentioned above), as well as blueberries. Used Spanish table wine, triple sec and brandy, let the whole thing refrigerate for 2 days. Needless to say, every time I walked passed the bar, I watched the sangria container go down, down, down. People RAVED and said, "Next year, you need to make more!" A huge hit! I loved the addition of the lemonade concentrate. I used 1 can per 12-serving batch. There's enough sugar in that - you don't need to add more. YUM! I WILL be making this again!

Love it. It is very good as is, but I prefer to sub half the triple sec for a higher end orange brandy (Patron Citronge) and use fresh or frozen cherries imstead of maraschino. I use a $12 red blend or a spanish red.

AMAZING sangria!  I skip the cherries and use Cran-Raspberry LaCroix instead of carbonated water.  Definitely let it sit for a good 24 hours prior to serving and add the bubbly water right before serving.

I live in McAllen, and this recipe has been a hit with guests this summer...to the point I make a batch almost every weekend, (guest or no). I stick to the exact recipe, yet, I've added small chunks of apple and I use an inexpensive pinot for my wine that pairs extremely with the fruit.  Next day, I take the dregs, pop them in the Bullitt and I got a fruit smoothy with a bang.

Unlike others who changed just about everything, I kept it the same.  I did not add the optional sugar or add any carbonated beverages.  I like sangria for what it is.  No need to alter it.  I used Campo Viejo Rioja.  I bought El Presidente Brandy per the top review.  I had little choice at my wine and spirits store for Triple Sec.   But I doubled this, and I could see myself drinking all of it.

This is my staple summer boat drink.  I always double the recipe and made a few changes...
I use Apothtic red wine from Wal Mart.  $9 a bottle.  I have also used an inexpensive tempranillo that is really good as well. 
I omit the water and sugar and just add a can of regular sprite per making, so two cans when I double it.    Do NOT leave out the brandy, it makes the recipe, and sometimes i add a little extra just for good measure.  
I also add a little splash of grenadine and some of the cherry juice from the marichino cherries.  I don't always have time to let it chill overnight and usually just make it in the morning and chill for a couple of hours before serving.  
This is by far my favorite sangria recipe, and it's requested everywhere we go.

I made this for a party with lots of international people from Spain and all over the world - I made 3 batches and it was all gone in about 1hr. I left out the cherries, used less sugar and used the juice from fruit instead of concentrate and let it soak overnight. Just before serving, I added lemon-lime and blood orange Italian soda to it to give it a light fizz. The trick is adding cinnamon sticks to it (learned that in Spain). Awesome!!

Loved this recipe!!!!  But not as is - made the following changes.  I omitted the sugar and used Ginger Ale instead of the carbonated water.  If you're going to let this sit overnight I suggest not using the citrus fruit.  I had some leftover from a party in the fridge for a couple of days and it turned bitter.  I'm making it again for a part and this time I'm going to try frozen mixed fruit/berries to add a little sweetness.

Made for  a wedding shower. I thought making triple the recipe would last - it was gone very quickly, even though we offered several other drink options. Reading through the reviews, I opted for using 7-Up and left out the sugar and water. I added sliced strawberries. Definitely let it sit overnight, it really makes all the flavors come together.

I got so many compliments on this! Definitely recommend! I made enough for ~50 people so I times-ed everything by 6:

-1 box (5L) of Franzia Cabernet

- 750ml blackberry brandy

-750ml triple sec

- 2 cups of lemon juice

-12 oz frozen lemonade concentrate

- I bottle of maraschino cherries (with juice)

- 10 oz orange juice

- 6 sliced oranges

- 4 sliced lemons

- 4 sliced lime

- 1/2 package of frozen mixed berries

I let this marinate for a good 48 hours and added ginger ale to those who wanted it. Almost everything fit in my 2 gallon beverage cooler so I recommend at least 3 gallon of you want to repeat this. It didn't need any sugar in my opinion :)

Changes? I should have made two batches.

I added the water later to sprizz it since we had two options: lemonade or water, for a sweeter or sourer taste.
It was delicious!

Definitely wait 24hrs before serving!

I have been using this recipe for several years and it's always a hit.  I usually double the recipe for parties and we never have leftovers. It's fruity and delicious but not too sweet.  I don't use soda or carbonated water, I like it better without.  So yummy!!

I used this for my wedding! I made it the night before and used ginger ale. Everyone loved it- but especially the ladies in attendance. I think my sister had +4 drinks! Which is probably why it was gone 30% of the way through. Should have made two pitchers! I am making it again for my housewarming party in a few weeks.

Best recipe ever. I did everything the way it said insted I used Brandi flavoring. Let it sit for 4 days without the lemons and limes. Add lemons and limes day of because it will turn sour. Still the bomb recipe. 
Thanks

Have made this several times and it is delicious.  My girlfriends ask me to bring it to our Girl's Nite Out.  To be honest, it tastes better than the sangria that I've had in Spain (too diluted).  This recipe is stronger, and we like it that way!

I tried this recipe for my daughter's wedding shower and she liked it so much that she asked me to make it for her wedding reception. I used Trader Joe's Morello Cherries and their juice instead of maraschino cherries. Everyone loved it and I have never had as many requests for a recipe as I did with this one!
I love that allrecipes gives you an automatic system for adjusting the number of servings.
Thanks so much!

I followed this recipe exactly and it is perfect. I squeezed fresh oranges for the orange juice and added club soda just before serving. I mixed the liquid ingredients two days before serving and added the fruit one day before.  Please, no fooling around with this one!!!

This is the best Sangria recipe! My father in law from Spain says this is very authentic tasting :). I make the recipe as is. I always make it the night before to let the flavors meld. I make it for parties, so I end up 6x the recipe. I used to use bottled wine- however tried it with the boxed wine and it is still delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!

I'm hooked!!!! Whenever I have guests coming over, they beg me to make this for them the night before. But don't let the taste fool you, though sweet, it does have a "kick" that sneaks up on you rather quickly :)

I followed previous suggestions and used spiced rum instead of brandy. This was the perfect cocktail for my deck party. I'm glad I discovered this drink in time! Thanks for sharing.

First time making a sangria.  Really, really, really good.  Used a big red as the base and used limeade concentrate instead of lemonade.  Served it to about 20 people for a family party. All loved it equally!  Didn't use the club soda but will try that next time just for fun.

This recipe is STELLAR! I fixed this for the first time at my Memorial Day Cookout and my friends and family were scraping the bottom of the barrel to get more! A few suggestions...I doubled the recipe to make a nice, large container of sangria! I also, used frozen, sweetened cherries, lots of oranges, limes and lemons. Substitute orange juice for orange concentrate and it's a hit! At the very end, add 1/2 bottle of sweet champagne to give that extra kick! Soo good! Will make again!

I replaced the triple sec with peach Schnapps. Nothing against the orange liqueur...I just wanted a different fruit liqueur that would complement the orange juice that's already a prominent flavor in this recipe. I also added a sliced peach along with the other fresh fruits. So good!

This was excellent.  Used 2 cups of gingerale, but don't add until ready to serve. Also, remove limes and lemons within 4 hours or so as others suggested or else taste is too sour. Can add other fruit. Next time, make double the batch!

This was my first time making sangria and it was a hit at out holiday gathering!  The only difference I made to the recipe was leaving out the cherries & ginger ale, but I added the sugar and 1/8 cup more brandy.  Next time, I will add a full 1/4 cup more brandy and the ginger ale/club soda.  Great recipe!!!

SUPER delicious. We always double this recipe at minimum, and there's never any leftovers. Definitely a hit at parties! Our only change is to skip the sugar (it's plenty sweet on its own), and substitute seltzer for ginger ale at time of serving (optional). 5 HUGE STARS!

great!  leave out the cherries and the sugar and the soda water.  a double batch in necessary for any gathering (fits in the smaller pasta pot).  For a party at our house, 3 or 4 batches are necessary.

Served this for my husband's birthday party.  Fruity and intense.  We did not dilute with carbonated anything and served over ice.  WOW!  Folks are still talking about the Sangria served and it's been 2 years since.

Great recipe!  Followed suggestions to omit sugar and add ginger ale (I added diet ginger ale).  Everything else was per the recipe.  If you ladle the sangria into a glass and then add the ginger ale to the glass, you can customize the strength to your guest's taste and each glass will be as "fizzy" as the first.

I believe the key to this recipe is letting it sit for several hours prior to serving. I've made sangria recipes before that were not very successful, but I made this pretty close to what was written (I took the 7-up suggestion from other comments, left out the sugar, used frozen black cherries because that's what I had on hand) and it was beyond amazing. I will be making this again...and as I'm taking it to a party this evening I'm regretting not making a bigger batch because this is going to be a big hit.

I liked this recipe. I wasn't blown away, but it was easy and tasty. I might just like it sweeter though, because I made a non-alcoholic version for the kids substituting sparkling wine and it was delicious!

I made this for our christmas gathering.  It was a huge hit.  My only regret was that I did not make more.  It really tastes better when it sits for at least an hour.

it is very, very good    ----  but add about 1/2 cup of Southern Comfort, and 2 sliced bananas, and 1 mango (sliced) for a really special taste !!!! Also  -- consider (i have done it both ways) using 7Up instead of Ginger Ale  -- both work equally well

Used Brandy soaked cherries because I had them and left out the lemonade, used more OJ and Ginger ale instead of water. Yummy!

I served this the first time for a house warming party and it was gone before I knew it!  The next time I made a double batch and still ran out early in the evening.  I did not use the sugar or the cherries either time, but felt nothing was missing without them.  All my guests raved that this was the best sangria they had ever tasted.  I will use this as my go-to party drink from now on!

The mix turned very sour overnight and was evident of the citrus rinds. I ended up using the sugar as well as adding 2 tsp of the  maraschino cherry juice to sweeten and mask the overwhelming citrus aftertaste. I made a 20 serving batch so 3/4 cup of cherry juice was used to salvage my expensive concoction. In other words, there is quite a bit of sugar in this batch. 

I would suggest removing the rinds of the citrus in lieu of adding so much sugar.

We make this recipe (tripled, at least) every Christmas Eve. We mix it in a huge stock pot, cover it with plastic wrap, and keep it in a cooler in the back hall for the family to sip on, over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The wine we use is often a Cabernet Sauvignon, or a Shiraz. The Brandy is a must. We have used both a cheaper "triple sec" and the patron orange liqueur. Since it is mixed, I recommend the triple sec. We generally leave out the sugar and leave the ginger-ale separate for individual servings. Everyone LOVES it. It certainly helps the holiday spirit as well, wink wink. This will be our third year making it. A family favorite, for sure.

The BEST sangria!  I have made this for parties and everyone has always loved it, even then men who typically drink beer!  I agree that it has to sit overnight, and the different modifications/substitutions mentioned in the reviews work, but it's good just as the recipe calls for.  I typically leave out the soda and have used all different kinds of fruits...apples, pears, grapes, limes, lemons, oranges, etc.  I've also used peach schnapps along with the brandy and triple sec. Very, very good!

I take the drink with me to all parties.  Love it!  It's a real hit!  The only thing I do different is I add Sprite right before serving instead of the sugar and carbonated water.  I also don't add cherries.  Delish!!!!

This is the best Sangria I have ever made!  The only changes I made were to eliminate the cherries (I don't like them) and added a cinnamon stick.  As far as the fruit goes, I cleaned out the fruit bowl, any kind of fruit works.  The key to this Sangria is the Brandy and letting it sit overnight.  Makes for a great party punch.  Enjoy!!

Made this Sangria for a dinner party tonight.  Doubled the recipe and followed directions as they are here, but added a bit more brandy and also used Sprite instead of the carbonated water.  Everyone said they loved it!  I will use this recipe again.  Excellent!

Fantastic!  A wonderful recipe-I've skipped sugar and used apricot brandy.  I've also topped off with either ginger ale or club soda, depending on how sweet I am in the mood for.

If I ever make this again, I'll follow some of the other reviewers suggestion and use rum instead of brandy.  I thought the brandy was overwhelming and there was a faint bitterness to the total taste.
Maybe I'm just not a sangria person!!!!

Wow! I tripled the recipe as I made this for a big party and it was a huge hit. It is by far the best sangria I have ever had. The only change I made was to omit the sugar and use 7-up instead of carbonated water. I also took the hint from other reviewers and added just 1/2 cup of peach schnapps to the tripled recipe. I think 1/2 cup per one recipe would have been too overpowering. The only complaint was why didn't I make more! There was not a drop left by the end of the night.

Wonderful. Easy to take basic recipe and adapt to whatever you have on hand. I used 2 bottles of Mikes "Lite" hard lemonade instead of the lemonade. My favorite version is with fresh peaches and schnapps. For the fall, I like to use finely minced apples.

Oh gosh!  I was so nervous to make this recipe because I wanted it to be perfect for my friends that were coming over.  I followed the recipe exactly, leaving out the sugar and using ginger ale.  I put it together yesterday morning. We just did the sampling and it is amazing.  Not too sweet and doesn't taste like nasty alcohol.  My disappointment? I don't think I made enough batches.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious Sangria.  We used the Seven-Up variation without the added sugar and it was a crowd pleaser.  It was sweet enough and full of flavor.

This was GREAT, just like I remember from Spain.  I left out the cherries, sugar & club soda.    However, next time I will only let the fruit stay in for about 8 hours.  I noticed that it tasted fabulous then, but after I let it sit overnight, the rind gave the sangria a bitter taste.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  The Sangria is a huge hit! It is so easy to perpare.  For a better taste let it sit overnight.

this sangria was fantastic. i made it for a playdate luncheon and the other mamas swooned. i did substitute gin and cointreau for the brandy and triple sec; it was a wonderful crisp drink. i skipped the sugar and marischino cherries, and added about 1/2 the ginger ale. warning, this drink packs a POWERFUL punch, and it is easy to drink a lot without realizing it. needless to say, everyone was at my house for a good long time. but even the non-sangria fans were true devotees before the day ended. last word of advice: make a double recipe at LEAST!

the. best. sangria. EVER!!    Wow! Thanks for such a rockin' recipe!!     I've substituted sunny D for the OJ and drank it without letting the fruit soak (just squeezed the fruit so the juices came out) and it was STILL fantastic! Doesn't last for very long around my house!!    If I could give this 10 stars, I would!

I made this for a large party and it was a huge hit!  I've just been asked to make it for the next party since everyone loved it so much.  The balance of taste was perfect, very smooth.  I couldn't find the cherries so I just used oranges, lemons and limes, delicious!  Thanks

Very, very good.  I made it the night before as recommended.  I substituted limeade concentrate because I had it on hand.  I omitted the cherries and added green apple.  I did use a little bit of sugar, maybe 2 tablespoons, to add just the right amount of sweetness.  It was a big hit at our party- I only wish I'd made more!

I made this sangria for my family party and I double the recipe to make a hugh punch bowl full of it. I was worried it was going to go to waste but instead it was gone half way through my party!!! We ended up using all the fruit left on the bottom to make other mixed drinks because it tasted so good. I commited this recipe to memory and will use it many more times. I did use the white sugar and I also used the maraschinl cherry juice as well and it tasted spectacular.

Made this for a Mexican themed dinner I was invited to. Was in a rush and didn't fully read directions, and made it a few hours before the party. It was still delicious, but my neighbor said the left over drink was even better the next day...so make the day before for best results!

SO FREAKING GOOD!!   I added chopped up granny smith apples and some peach schnapps.  I skipped the lemon juice and added extra frozen lemonade. I didn't need to add anything to sweeten it up. I just used the soda water and it was perfect!

This sangria is delicious!  I made it for my sister's bridal shower and received rave reviews.  I used barcardi instead of brandy, omitted the frozen lemonade concentrate, and did not add the sugar.  I've made it since and everytime I have, people are in love with it.

It's difficult to find a balance between the alcohol and fruit juice flavors, but this recipe does that very well. The last time I used this recipe, I substituted the frozen lemonade concentrate with a limeade concentrate (it's what was on hand) and the finished product was slightly more tangy, which I enjoyed more.

Excellent! Brandy is a must, as well as letting it sit for 24 hours. I didnt use triple sec, limeade, lemon juice or ginger ale. I added papaya, mango and strawberry chunks and let them sit for the 24 hours, then i served over frozen pineapple chunks. I tripled the recipe and it went quick. I used Carlos Rossi Sangria... will definately make again. oh, and its super strong when its freshly made, so letting it sit as long as possible is key in blending the flavors and toning it down.

Wow!  This is a great recipe.  The brandy really gives it a kick, along with all those juices and fruit.  I put mine in a decorative glass iced tea jar, and it looked fabulous (plus was easy for guests to help themselves).  Will definitely make again.

I used Sprite instead of carbonated water.  Put in lime, orange, mar cherries, and grapes.  We doubled the recipe and a party of 6 had approx 2 drinks a piece.  The fruit was the best part!  Chills for 24 hours before it was served.  It was a hit and will make again~

This recipe is unbeatable! I made 6 gallons of this the night before as one of the cocktails for my daughter's wedding.  It was all gone during the appetizers!!!  (and we had an open bar - guests could have anything) Everyone LOVED IT!!!

My friends and I have recently starting trying the Sangria at our favorite restaurants.  So, I made this for a group of women at a jewelry party.  I used Ginger Ale instead of the club soda.  It was a HUGE hit and several people asked for the recipe!  I will definitely make this time and again!

I made this last summer for a big outdoor birthday party.  Everyone drank this instead of the beer, and I had an entire keg left over.  It was the best sangria I have ever made or drank!  I did cut up apples, so there would be more edible pieces.  I did make it the night before, and it was perfect.

I made this for my husband's family reunion and it was a huge hit!  Guys who said they didn't care for Sangria were coming back for more and the beer was hardly touched.  I used carbonated water - otherwise it might be too concentrated.  I cut up the fruit into smaller pieces as other suggested.  Also, know that while the taste is smooth, this stuff is potent.   I'll definitely make it again.

My favorite Sangria recipe.  I always leave the cherries and lemonade concentrate out.  I am just not a big fan of cherries and I think the lemonade makes it too sweet.  I do add a little sugar, about 1/8 of a cup.  I also add club soda to each glass for fizz.  Love it!

We loved it! We wanted to be able to eat more of the fruit so we peeled the oranges and cut them up and added additional cherries. Next time, I'll follow other reviews and add more fruits, like pineapples, etc.

Great sangria. Everyone loved it! Used 7up instead of sugar and carbonated water. Added it individually to each glass as I was serving. About half and half. For some reason all of my fruit tasted very bitter after it had set for 24 hours even though it was not bitter when I added it at the begining. No problem, just didn't eat the fruit. Although I am curious as to why it was bitter. Will definitley make this again and am sharing the recipe already.

The recipe is GOOD...but...after making it once, we altered it to include 2 more bottles of red wine, changed the triple sec to Gran Marnier and left out the sugar, opting instead for the cherry juice as the sweetner along with the Ginger Ale instead of the Soda.  Awesome!  Made 5 gallons and it was even better the next day!

I second the person's opinion that this is a very forgiving recipe.  I used a red zinfandel wine that I had on hand, with everything as directed except triple sec because I didn't have any.  Went over well for a tapas party and complimented my theme perfectly.

Great recipe!  I didn't have triple sec so I added some Grand Marnier instead, I also omitted the cherries, and added a bottle of sparkling white wine instead of carbonated water or club soda, as other reviewers had suggested.  Packs a strong punch, but tastes great (do be sure to let it sit before serving, though).

Good recipe - only change made was to use Grand Mariner instead of the Triple Sec, as I am not a fan of triple sec. My boyfriend made this for a party and everyone loved it. The leftover fruit is addictive!

Delicious! I made this with some of the hints by other reviewers - no sugar or carbonated water but used gingerale instead; also, I added peaches and apples with the other fruit and left out the cherries. This was a big hit!

Excellent! I didn't want to purchase any additional liquor for the recipe, so I went with what I happened to have on hand (mango rum and Grand Marnier instead of the brandy and triple sec - though Grand Marnier is actually a variety of triple sec liquour that is made with cognac brandy). I did not add the sugar, and used 7up instead of soda water (again, I was trying to work with what I had on had). I tasted it when I first put it together and I questioned the recipe, but after having a day to mellow out it was outstanding. I made a double batch and everyone went back for seconds (at least). This will be my go to recipe for sangria from now on.

OMG-What a Fantastic Sangria. I haven't had Sangria in 10 years, but I remember loving it. I was afraid to make it for my Cinco de Mayo party (also my b-day) in such a large quantity, but it was a hit!. Made 48 servings-(ie; 4 cups brandy/triplesec equal 1/5. Cut sugar down to 1 cup; added pineapple and a can of peaches. Stored in frig overnight and bought 2 bottles of 7Up, which people could chose to add (and most did). Used a decent 5 gallon box of cab (= to 6.5 bottles) and a 1.5 liter.

good base recipe, but it left a very bitter after taste.  Had to fix w/ more OJ and simple sugar. Next time will steer clear of the citrus and opt for apples  and pears.

I absolutely love this Sangria. I don't use the triple sec or the cherry juice but it still comes out great everytime. I have even made it without the brandy and it was still very good. Everyone raves about how great this Sangria is. I make it for almost every party I throw.

This was wonderful!  I served it for a party tonight and it was definitely a hit! EVERYONE loved it and went back for seconds-and thirds! Fantastic and tasted just like the sangria that I tried in Spain!

I made this for a party and everyone raved about it, even the ones who don't like wine. I used the sugar and ginger ale instead of soda, and it was perfectly sweet for all of us who like 'girly drinks'. Next time I will cut the orange rounds in half though, to make it easier to eat the boozed up fruit (which everyone was doing when the pitcher was gone). Definitely a keeper.

This is a staple at our parties (which my husband and I throw quite often)!!  Even if it's technically 'out of season' or not really relevant to the current holiday celebration, our friends INSIST that we make this recipe!  It's the best; I cannot say enough good things.  The only alterations we made are to use limeade instead of lemonade and cherry brandy instead of regular...You won't be disappointed!

I made this for a dinner party. Every one of my guests loved it - even people who normally don't drink. I omit the lime, lemon concentrate, and sugar; instead of using triple sec I used Peach Schnapps; I added a little more Brandy; added apple and pear; I also did not add carbonated water. I let it sit over night in the fridge.  This is a fantastic Sangria recipe - my version is a bit strong but not too sweet. Next time I would try without adding the additional Brandy.

One of my all-time favorite drink recipes -- have made for various occasions now and everyone has always been pleased.  Never had sangria before this, but I'm sure nothing else will compare.

I've tried this by the recipe, and also using the peach schnapps / rum swap - both are delicious, though I don't prefer triple sec quite as much.  The first couple times I made it with Red Cat, bc that's the only type of red wine I know I like... however, after reading many reviews, I tried the cheaper red wine and it tastes just as delicious !!!  No need to use the more expensive wine -- I'd save that for drinking it by itself.  This sangria is fantastic.. thanks for the awesome recipe.

PS -- guests love eating the cherries after they've been soaked for a day !

Excellent. I like mine a little sweeter so used 7Up instead of carbonated water. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is fantastic!  Made 2 changes.. .left out the limes (afraid it would make it too bitter) and instead of the white sugar made a simple syrup which mixes MUCH better - and no one even knows they're drinking an alcoholic beverage!!  GREAT recipe!  I'll use it again & again!  This from someone who HATES wine!!!

I made this for a Halloween party and all my girlfriends loved it! Even the husbands enjoyed it.  I made my "Witch's Brew Sangria" even more dramatic by putting my punch bowl into a bigger Halloween bucket surrounded by dry ice and water.  The eerie foggy effect was perfect!

oh my god this was good. it was a lot of prepwork but for a party or shower its perfect. it was a hit at my sisters bridal shower. i did make some substitutions as recommended by some of the other reviewers and i was glad i did. 
first of all i used cherry brandy instead of regular brandy, i wanted a little sweeter recipe. i was afraid it would be too strong. i used frozen cherries because my supermarket didnt have fresh and delish and easy! the fruit soaked up a lot of alcohol so we were sucking on the pieces long after the sangria was gone and they were heavenly. 

i would recommend this recipe anyday and will definitely make it again!!!!!

Great recipe!  I also didn't make enough and both the men and women at our BBQ enjoyed this!  I also substituted the carbonated water with 7up and didn't add the sugar.  Pay no mind to the reader who didn't like this because they tried "the real thing" in Mexico - someone should tell them that this is a Spanish drink!

I made this for a party. Even those who "don't like Sangria" loved it. Some preferred to add club soda instead of lemon-lime soda (which they found too sweet).

I made this and was only able to let it set for 5 hours before serving, everyone loved it.  I was glad I made a double batch.  I also only had cherry flavored brandy and it worked out great.  I did omit the sugar.  Perfect.

Excellent!!! I used a Peter Vella burgundy (my favorite mexican restaurant uses it in their Sangria). Also used Peach Schapps instead of triple sec. I definitely like the addition of carbonated water for a 'summer' feel. We used one with citrus flavor. Absolutely wonderful. It's almost impossible to ruin this recipe. Next time I'll try a few variation and make a 'white' Sangria. Yum!

I made this for the first time back in March for my sisters surprise b-day party. I made a double batch & it was gone before the party was over. I followed the recipe exactly as written. You can definetly add your favorite fruits for your own personal liking. I have made it several times since the party & every time its a party favorite!! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I used a package of frozen berries (strawberries, raspberries and blueberries) in addition to the citrus and cherries.  I did not use any sugar.  I added soda water to the glasses as it was served.  It was delicious and a hit!

I looked at a number of sangria recipes on this site before deciding on this one for serving at my niece's first birthday party.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a bit more brandy.  
This was a great success!  It was refreshing and the flavors of the fruit blended perfectly.  I will definitely make this again!

I agree with everyone else!  This is a great idiot proof recipe.  I made it with cheap red wine and it was delicious.  As many others did before me, I omitted the sugar and used ginger ale.  I made a double batch.  It looked great in my punch bowl.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Great Sangria!!!  Have made this several times and everyone likes it.  I usually use one bottle of "Sangria" wine and another bottle of whatever red/apple I have on hand.  Doesn't really matter.  It's the other ingredients that make this Sangria special!!  Great in the frig for a few days.

Turned out perfect.  I will definitely continue to make this.  I make it with the sugar and I leave a bottle of tonic water nearby for anyone that wants to lighten up their drink a bit or create a more fizzy drink.

I actually only used half a can of pink lemonade and just the fruit, with one more orange in it. Turned out very very sweet and citrus-y and kept for days.

This recipe is delicious. The market did not have lemonade concentrate, so I went with limeade concentrate instead. I also used Burgandy wine in those big jugs. Oh and I added a splash of Rose's Lime Juice, too.

Great Sangria recipe!  I used ginger ale instead of sugar and carbonated water as suggested.  It was better after sitting overnight.  We did serve some right when we made our double batch and it was still good!

I used Spanish wine, like another reviewer did, spiced rum and 7-up. It was the best!  My mom and sister loved it too.  Thanks to the reviews I was able to put my own twist on this recipe.

I made both this recipe and "Conchi's Sangria" and did a blind taste-test with all my sangria-loving pals at our cottage.  This one WON by a 8-1 vote!  Skipped the cherries and added some granny smith apples which were fun to eat after soaking in the wine (and added to the buzz!)

Yummmmy!!!  Wow, what can I say!  The best sangria I have ever had.  I made one batch for a bbq, which disappeared in no time... (should have doubled it) I didn't add the cherries or the sugar, used diet sprite instead of the carb water and it was perfect. This one is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe.

I believe I may have developed a bit of a drinking problem because of this recipe...lol!  You can use inexpensive wine, make sure it's dry. I tried using a cheap box of wine so that I could prepare it for the masses, and it was gross. Something about box wine being sweet, yuck.  Do not change a thing and you will have the best Sangria ever!!!

Woweee! This is a tasty drink. And it was fun to make. I did cut back on the sugar a bit, but otherwise made exactly as the recipe states. I will have a pitcher of this on hand whenever friends visit. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW - this is AWESOME!!!  The only thing I did differently was to marinate everything but the red wine and sparkling water first - for about 2 hours, then I added the red wine (a Spanish Rioja) and let it chill for another 2 hours.  I can't even imagine how much better it could be if I'd started the night before!!  I didn't add the sparkling water - it would be a good way to stretch it and tame it down, but I didn't need to do either.
Thanks for this recipe!!  I was a very happy mother on mothers day (grin)

Fabulous!  My husband and I had another couple over for a Mexican dinner.  We served this Sangria. (The first Sangria I've ever made.) The guys had beer because "Sangria is girl's stuff."  However, after one sample sip, both of them switched from their beer to our girly Sangria! :) Unfortunately, after that, I wish we had made more than one batch!

very good!  I only gave it 4 stars because it's a little too sweet for me, so I just cut back on lemonade concentrate and sugar.

Much like the restaurants!

Oh my, this was good.  I had some leftover and did not want to pour it down the drain.  So I got out my trusty freezer containers and froze it. Talk about a yummy icee.

Made this for a party in a pinch, with only  3 1/2 hours for it to sit, and it was still delicious.  Was a better flavor the next day, but for all those who don't have enough time, I say go for it.  Left out the sugar and just used ginger ale like others here, found it to be easier and it was just the right sweetness.  Also, swapped frozen berries and pineapple for the cherries (which I don't care for) and thought that was a good change.

This was very good, but kind of strong. I used 7up with it.

This is an OUTSTANDING Sangria!  It has a major kick so make sure when you make it, your guests have plenty of time to sober up!  I like a little sweeter sangria so I ommited the cherries and put in sliced nectarines and served with ginger ale.  A do listen to the other reviews about making double batches...one isn't enough!

This is the best sangria recipe ever.I won't be using any other recipe from now on. I omitted sugar and water. Refrigerate it over night for best results. I used a inexpensive red spanish wine called El Paseo. Yummy!

Sept 15 2007 - I Tried this for the first time for a birthday party cook-out..Im not a drinker but this is so good i had 3 small cups of it.Sub barcardi lite rum for brandy & used peach snapps for triple sec.Instead of dry red wine used Arbor Mist Sangria Zinfandel.Forgot to add 7-up,still tasted great.Everybody loved it including the guys.Mother-in law not a drinker & she like it too.

FANTABULOSO!!   I did make a few changes, mostly because I didn't have a few exact ingredients.   Instead of 1/2 cup brandy I used 1/4 spiced rum with 1/4 brandy.  I used Cointreau for the triple sec because I'm a snob and prefer it.  Didn't have frozen lemonade, but did have pineapple sherbet, used two scoops.  No cherries, so I splashed in some grenadine.  My only mistake was that I didn't DOUBLE it for four people.  Oh and I added an extra peach.   The fruit was yummy over frozen custard later.  burp

I made this to serve as a pre drink for my daughters 21 birthday.  I excluded the brandy, and used gingerale .. for triple sec we used grand marniar. everything else was accurate.. it was awesome. everyone loved it and it went well with the fish tacos.  
I will definately make this again.
Cheers!!

I took this to a party.  It wasn't a big hit with the women, but one guy drank a ton of it because he wasn't getting buzzed off his wine coolers.  I thought it was okay, but wouldn't spend the money to make it again.

Wow!  This packs a punch!!  I will make it again, but add less brandy, or maybe use a flavored brandy, like peach.  Adding the ginger ale is absolutely necessary to dilute it.

This sangria is DELICIOUS! I made it without the extra sugar and used some canned peaches/nectarines and their juice. I only let it sit for about an hour and it was still fantastic. Topped off with ginger ale, it's marvelous! It certainly does sneak up on you...but very pleasantly :) Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delecious!!! Instead of buying triple sec, the liquor store sold brandy and orange together, it was very yummy!  Also, instead of adding sugar I bought a sweeter wine that was recommended by the sales rep.  Otherwise followed the recipe the same and everyone loved it!

Yowza!  Very very strong if you don't dilute it, and my guests didn't realize that!   Next time, will add the lemonade (or ginger ale or whatever) prior to serving for the sake of my guests!

I left out the cherries and sugar and added a peach.  I used 2-Buck-Chuck cabernet sauvignon, which worked just fine.  I made 4 batches and let them sit overnight -- this was a HUGE hit at my housewarming party.  We ran out in about an hour, and everyone was digging the fruit out of the pitchers.  Next time I will add pineapple and maybe other fruits.... great recipe!!

Great recipe as-is! I used Riunite Lambrusco wine and it was a hit! The second time I added half of a Fuji apple and a half cup or so of blackberries.

It is so easy to make and so delicious to drink!  Be sure the give the fruit 24 hours to marinate.  The flavors need that much time to meld.

This sangria was a hit at our holiday party!  I made it 24 hours in advance, substituted cranberries for the pomegranates and used club soda instead of the ginger ale to lessen the sweetness.   A triple recipe filled my 1 1/2 gal. dispenser and it disappeared quickly.  This recipe is a keeper!

i have been making this Sangria for my family holiday gatherings for more than 10 years.  i like to make it a day or 2 ahead of time to give the flavors time to settle.   I use  Grand Manier instead of plain triple sec, and use a frozen berry mix instead of the citrus slices.  I find the orange juice and the frozen lemonade is enough citrus for me.  I hope you love this as much as my family does!

I don’t drink but I made it for a dinner with friends. It was a hit! I followed the recipe as stated but I did add 7-up instead of water. Very easy to make. I would certainly make it again.

Awesome work. Better than any sangria I've tried from restaurants. I made it with fresca, instead of club soda and It's a super hit. Also that overnight portion of the instructions is very very important.

This recipe never seems to disappoint, even though I tend to change it up each time. I always leave out the sugar, find the freshest berries and citrus , sometimes change out or halve the lemonade with strawberry lemonade or mango lemonade and a floater of gingerale, ginger beer or splash of sparking wine. Absolute crowd fave at every party.

This was the best sangria I have ever made (or had)! I made a double recipe for a day on the boat, and it was a hit with everyone!

I love this recipe - and tweak it to my own personal tastes - using peach brandy and peach schnapps (instead of triple sec).  It has never failed me and my guests love it.

This recipe is great! I love this app! Only used 2 tbs of sugar and plain seltzer at serving. Also added a big peach. It sat over night. Delicious! The peach was amazing after soaking it all up.

Fabulous!

I adjusted the recipe only to fit what I had on hand but this was so great I'm keeping my edits.

Frozen lime juice instead of frozen lemonade
Gingerale instead of carbonated
Omit sugar entirely

We both agreed it was too acidic.  I think it was too much OJ.  We did not add sugar, but that would have made it too sweet.

Amaaaaazing!!! I cut the sugar in half and used a Cab for the win.  Filled glasses half with the sangria and half with Lemon flavored seltzer.  Everyone who tastes this raves about it!  Definitely a keeper.

I love that this recipe isn't too sweet!  We left out about half of the sugar, and each person added soda (or not) to taste. Even mis-reading the proportions and adding a little too much lemon juice didn't kill it - we just adjusted the other ingredients until it tasted good to us. YUM! This will definitely become a motorhoming staple.

I've made this on 5 or 6 occasions and I've been told every time that it's the best sangria they've ever had... I LOVE it and yes, it is that good... I follow the recipe exactly... I use inexpensive red blend wines, doesn't matter what kind, they all come out great... I don't add the white sugar, you don't need to... and I use a single serve bottle of 7UP (instead of carbonated water) for the carbonation and sweetness and I add it right before serving... I also cut up all kinds of fruits to  add, not just the orange, lemon, & lime as the recipe lists... I use apples, strawberries, peaches, etc... Again, it doesn't really matter... this recipe allows you the freedom to play around without screwing it up AT ALL... I will say making it the night before does seem to make a difference to the complexity of the flavors... But I've also made it and served it 15 minutes later because someone asked me to make 'that awesome sangria' and it's still fantastic!!

Definitely making again! Though I may use less rinds from the citrus, that flavour almost overpowered mine when I left it over night. Everyone loved it though! And it sure packed a punch from just one glass we were all feeling it quick. Deliciously dangerous haha!

Excellent sangria recipe! I made it as listed, and chose the option to not use the sugar, and used ginger ale instead of club soda. The brandy I chose was black cherry brandy. Threw some frozen strawberries in too. Made it the day before (added the ginger ale just before serving). It was delicious... and dangerous! LOL! This stuff tastes like punch but packs quite a punch! I'll definitely make this again. Next time, I'll cut the lemons, limes, and oranges into smaller pieces... while they looked pretty in rounds, they made it difficult to put some fruit in to each person's glass, and the smaller fruit was stuck at the bottom of the pitcher. By cutting them smaller it will be easier to use a slotted spoon to put some fruit in each person's glass before/after pouring.

Been making this for a couple of years after finding the recipe on this site. It is really a great recipe and friends and family always seem to enjoy it. I always warn those that don't drink very often to be careful, because it can pack a wallop! We mix it with club soda, ginger ale or Sprite.

I have made this sangria recipe on three separate occasions. Most recently, I made FIVE liters for a yacht party. The ladies smashed the first two liters before the boat pulled anchor and headed out to sea! I was stunned! Next time, I will double the batch. This is a very flavorful sangria. Do not skip any ingredients. It will not disappoint.

I used pomegranate juice instead of red wine,  an extra lemon instead of frozen lemonade, I froze Some raspberries and blackberries to add at the end and used sprite instead of club soda. Everyone loved it! Some folks added Prosecco to their drinks too, so I guess that means I could Have made it more fizzy? I used Rum instead of brandy because that is all I had At home.

Delicious and very strong!  I didn't have frozen lemonade concentrate and left that out.  I added fresh apple and blackberries.  I used 2 bottles of semi-sweet red and 1 bottle sweet red wine (nothing fancy!) and halved the sugar.  I let this sit overnight and added 2 cups of carbonated water (used my Soda Stream) in the morning.  I tripled the recipe for approx. 15 people and this was a huge HIT.  It was gone only halfway through the party and people were asking me to make more!  The flavors and fruit come together beautifully in a rich, deep red color.  

I was not expecting this to be so strong though, you can't really taste how strong it is.  Definitely a creeper!  I think I could easily make this using half the triple sec and brandy and still have it taste delicious.  I plan on adding more fresh fruit next time around.  Great recipe!

Delicious combinations!
Made it for a party and it was a hit. Definitely recommend making it a day or two earlier so fruit can absorb the juice. The club soda makes it a spritzer lighter version so some folks didn’t use it.
After cutting the fruit I sprinkled it with sugar and let it soak a few hours then I made the sangria and poured it all in a large pitcher. Yummm

I left out the sugar and used the optional club soda. It was still plenty sweet enough, very fruity and delicious. I gave the citrus slices a little squeeze to extract some of the juice into the sangria before dropping them in. So good, this is my go-to sangria recipe.

I don't drink, but have made this 4-5 times over the last year. There is never a drop left and people request it every single time we have a party. I don't use carbonated water and I add the fruit a few hours ahead (not overnight). It is a hostess' delight to see people enjoying this drink!

I don't know what it is about this recipe that I am not comprehending but every time I try to make this recipe I do not like it at all. I turn out disappointed each time I try to replicate this recipe. The ingredients sound about right but flavor wise, it's not working for me. If you really enjoy your sangrias, or are a bartender like me, you might want to pass on this one.

Way too much citrus for my taste!  I suppose I could've added the optional sugar and ginger ale, but I'd much rather use naturally sweeter fruit.

This Sangria is delicious!. Every bit as good as what we had in Spain. I cut the fruit rings in quarters and made the mix the night before as suggested. The ginger ale added a subtle taste and a little fiz when added just before serving. The fruits were sweetened over night and we ate them, even the lemons slices, too, after we tossed back the drinks. Easy to make and impressive when served in fancy glasses. This is a fun drink to serve with tapas or your favorite appetizers.

Made this for the first time a couple of years ago for a family Thanksgiving.   Now my sisters and friends ask me to bring it to every holiday and gathering.  Huge hit.  It does have to sit overnight to meld properly....and I add sparkling water or ginger ale before serving.

Delicious and easy to make. A real crowd pleaser! I skip the carbonated add-ins and use non-citrus fruits.  These get eaten with gusto!

I loved this Sangria! I didn't have lemonade so I used pineapple juice instead and it was delicious! Will definitely make this again. Only reason this is getting 4 out of five is that the recipe did not say to make a simple syrup with the sugar, which I did and it blended perfectly.

But you have to add the club soda. That’s not optional, as the recipe says. With the club soda, it’s good. Without the club soda, it’s extremely tart.

I was asked to make Sangria for a friend's party. I used this recipe. Being a non-drinker, I didn't know what to expect, but it was really good! The party guests and the host enjoyed it as well. I'll be making it again over the holiday season, and passing this recipe along.

This was fantastic! (One minor change, I doubled the OJ. )My husband, who isn't a big wine drinker, completely enjoyed this. I've forwarded the recipe to family and friends and they enjoy it too. Thanks for posting!

This was my first time making sangria, although I've had it many times before.  It was delicious!  I made it for our Labor Day cookout, and it was a huge hit.

In reading through the reviews before making it, I noticed a lot of people mentioned to omit the sugar and to use fresh-squeezed lemon juice if possible.  I did both, and also added blackberries in addition to the citrus fruit and cherries.  This will definitely be my new go-to for get-togethers.

I've made this several times now and it is fantastic!  The first time I made exactly as written.  I've since varied a few things for my taste.  I use a fruit brandy -- raspberry or blackberry -- and use 3/4 cup of it.  I put all of the liquids in over the fruit then use a wooden spoon to crush the fruit a bit.  I mix by the glass with about 50% ginger ale in each glass.  So delicious and refreshing!

No cherries, heavier on the brandy, ginger ale instead of carbonated water...this is a very tasty recipe.

Oh, and I always use Trader Joe's 2 Buck Chuck Cab Sauv, works great for this.

We made it with no sugar no soda.  It was not my favourite option to make because of all the very specific liquor to buy but it didn’t not disappoint!!!! It was amazing and we will make it and surely use up all our ingredients! Highly recommend.  And so easy!

My large glass serving pitcher was the perfect size for the single recipe, including the carbonated water (which is essential for authenticity,) fruit, and a top-off with ice. For the carbonated water, I used Topo Chico, a locally popular sparkling mineral water of Mexican origin. Since I was making enough for a big party, using a 3 gallon glass vessel, I made the "base" for this sangria, multiplying the recipe x3, to generously serve 25 guests. The "base" includes ALL ingredients EXCEPT the carbonated water, i.e. Topo Chico. To maximally maintain carbonation for each refill of the pitcher, I ladled one-third of the liquid "base" mixture (approximately 5 cups) into the pitcher, adding the slices of lime/lemon/orange, and 2 cups Topo Chico. To serve or refill each guest, a beverage wineglass was half-filled with ice.  I did not garnish with maraschino cherries as I do NOT use these food aberrations. This beverage was a party hit, with many compliments and no left-overs.

This was a huge hit at the wedding shower I recently had! I made two double batches and people were so desperate for more that I added another bottle of wine toward the end of the night just to extend it. I used peach flavored brandy and added a lot of different fruit: apples, pears, fresh cherries (I do not like maraschino cherries). I also provided Buffalo Rock Southern Spice ginger ale as the topper, which was a huge success!! I will definitely be making this again for any party I have!

Always a hit...my go-to sangria.  Perfect as it but it's versatile as a base too.  I often use a 1/2 or 2/3 can of frozen lemonade mix instead of adding the lemon juice.  I have also added canned or jarred fruit with the juice, instead of the sliced fruit...depends what I have on hand.  I've tossed in peaches, apples, pears....it all tastes good.  My favorite brandy for this is blackberry brandy.  I don't like carbonated sangria so I always leave it out.  I think it tastes better the next day so make it in advance if you can.

Absolutely delicious! I used Pinot Noir and I did not add the sugar, it was perfect. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is the way to go and make sure to make it the day before.

So great for a block party! Def let it sit overnight. I added diet white soda to lighten it up because I don’t like club soda and didn’t want the ginger ale. Perfect!

Substituted gran mariner for triple sec, substituted lemon juice for the lemonade concentrate, cut the sugar in half. The result was a smooth, fruit forward, refreshing blend — will be making all summer long

Yummmmm!!!I made this for a party and everybody loved it!! It doesn't need all of the ingredients. I didn't add the sugar,  orange juice,  lemon juice,  or club soda. I did add some fresh berries instead of the cherries also. I made 5 batches and there wasn't a drop left!

Loved the finished product but as with my favorite recipes on this site, I relied on constructure feedback from other reviewers! I skipped the sugar and lemonade concentrate. I replaced the club soda with ginger ale. It was absolutely delicious! I will definitely revisit this recipe in the future.

I have made this a few times and made various substitutions. The most important thing is to make it ahead so the flavors have time to blend together! Otherwise you really can't go wrong with this - its delicious. But be careful with it - everyone always wants more but they might be cursing you the next morning! :D

This is a delicious recipe!  I’m usually a dry wine drinker, but I love an occasional Sangria on a hot day. My husband is not a wine drinker, but I made this for our cook out and it was a major hit!  I omitted the sugar because I don’t need it very sweet - the triple sec is sweet enough - and I used regular brandy. Be careful, it’s a stronger concoction than you think!

Made this twice and its awesome. Prepared it exactly but used zinfandel and extra brandy which turned out good. Definitely let it set all night in fridge but also definitely take out the fruit because their flavor  overpowers the drink if left in more than one night.

I made this during the Holidays and it was a complete hit.  I did have to make some modifications as I did not want to run to the story but basically I just subbed rum for the brandy and ginger ale for the sparkling water.  It was amazing and everyone loved it.  I plan to make it for an upcoming summer event (and will at least double the batch!).  Thank you for the recipe!

Had some serious sangria drinkers over for the eagles super bowl win, and they all loved it. Made a double batch, stayed true to the recipe.  Easy and basic don't add the club soda it doesn't need it.

i drink a lot of sangria and this recipe is great!! if you want a stronger wine tasting sangria, don't use Ginger ale or 7 up or any carbonated drinks. it's fine in its own. i made a huge batch for a party. ONE RECOMMENDATION.. before letting this sit overnight, take out the lime and lemons after a couple of hours of making this because the rinds will eventually make it have a not so pleasant bitter taste.

I made it for a family party and people really enjoyed it. I recommend to leave the sangría overnight without the limes, oranges and lemons. An hour or two before serving, the citrus fruit can be added.

Please don't use Two Buck Chuck. True, you don't need to break the bank with the choice of wine but it is the star of the recipe and needs to be decent. Try a Garnacha from Spain. Tres Picos is inexpensive and a good choice. Excellent sangria that we all enjoyed drinking.

I doubled this recipe for a party and I'm glad I did because everyone loved it!  Not everyone wanted the club soda so I let people who wanted it add a little to their own glass.  Would definitely make it again.

Great recipe.  Used Perrier sparkling water (lime flavor) to add the fizz at serving.  Also did not have lemonade concentrate, so I added about 1/4 cup more lemon juice.  Dry and not too sweet.

First time making sangria. It was very time consuming to make. Made it for a backyard wedding reception and nobody would drink it. Was way too strong. Followed the directions and even tried to add ginger ale as others here suggested. Also, I ended up extremely ill. I'm not sure if it was the food at the reception or maybe the fruit wasn't washed good enough. But, I definitely had food poisoning. I personally do not recommend this recipe. I was a bit surprised after all the good reviews.

I have made this dozens of times, and it is terrific.  A lot of ingredients make it a little complicated, but it is always well received.  Don't use cheap red wine though....use the good stuff.  I use Meomi.

Excellent! Forgot the triple sec and it still tasted good. It was still strong enough for me. Took it to an event and everyone raved about it!

Excellent! I put 3/4 of recommended brandy in, and didn't add any sparkling water (I didn't want it diluted). 
Cutting the rinds off the circles seemed good, and if the circles are cut into bite size pieces then you can serve by ladelling (ladeling?) out the sangria + fruit. 
Definitely recommend making the day before, for taste and then it gets cold in icebox. But fine with ice cubes also.
Probably not as many circles as recipe calls for, are needed.
I used 1/2 as much sugar; adding the cherry juice may be good, too.

I followed this recipe exactly as follows minus the cherries.  After adding all the liquor I found that the brandy
 over powered it. Not sure if it would've been different if I let it sit overnight but I needed it for a party I was attending the same afternoon.  My solution was simple, I added another bottle of red wine and it tasted perfect! I llove the full bodied taste of it and it's not sweet like other sangria you might order at a pub.  I'm making it again for my bbq this weekend and I'll be adding two bottles of wine again. So good!

Awesome sangria!!! I used fresh pineapple and 1/4 cup of sugar instead of orange juice.... chopped up all my fruit and poured the brandy over it.. let it soak overnight in a big bowl.. then mixed everything together the next day! Fabulous! Definitely a keeper!

So easy to make!  Per other user reviews, omitted sugar and used ginger ale instead of carbonated water.  Key ingredient is brandy, and must make it the night before!  It was all gone super fast!  Party pleaser for sure!

Very good albeit on the sweeter side like,  and at that I was quite stingy on the sugar. I think I will skip the sugar completely next time I make it. And Yes! The guests finished the generous batch I had prepared!

This was ok but nothing spectacular... I don't like anything too sweet so I did not add the sugar and used club soda.  I think it's better after sitting 24 hours and not just overnight to give the flavours of the fruit time to blend in with the alcohol, I'd say it's actually a **** star recipe if you give it the 24 hours.

I wanted to right a real review; like actually following the recipe in its totality but I altered very minor things. For starters, I used peach brandy; I omitted the cherries: I added peaches and apples; as we speak the sangria is in the fridge so I haven't added the ginger ale (instead of the carbonated water like the recipe suggest) but it taste great without it!  I think this recipe is a hit!  I'm taking it to the beach today and I can't wait to share it with my friends!  I think if you followed the recipe exactly it would be great as well. I really didn't alter much. I will be making this again(but not to often bc sangria is not cheap to make! Lol)

This is our signature "welcome to summer "  recipe. I omit the sugar, no club soda or ginger ale, and use an inexpensive Spanish Tempranillo. Let it rest in the fridge at least one day before drinking. Yum, yum yum!

I've made this many times and it is wonderful. Easy to make and deliciously refreshing.  It certainly helps blend the flavors if you can let it sit 24 to 48 hours. 
Have tried a couple variations such as adding a bit of St. Germaine, Grand Marnier, fresh rasberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc. Use the base and just play around with flavors you find enjoyable. 
It is the best sangria recipe I have found!!

I made this drink recently for a birthday celebration and it was a BIG hit! I'm not a brandy fan so used rum instead and used ginger ale instead of club soda. Everyone loved it and can't wait for an opportunity to make it again

I did not have brandy so used my grey goose vodka. I used Gnarly Vine Red zinfandel for the dry red wine and  I did add the 1/4 cup sugar. I loved it!! This will definitely be my go to recipe for sangria.  Thank you!

This Sangria is so deliciously refreshing and it'll get you tipsy!! It received so many compliments and it's perfect on a nice sunny day.  I used ginger ale rather than club soda and I didn't add the sugar to my second batch, which was okay because the ginger ale still made it sweet. This is my new fab summer drink.  Even thru non-wine drinkers loved it!!

Great recipe. Multiplied this recipe by five for a party we had. Used a cheaper Spanish Rioja wine and were a little heavy handed on the brandy. We used fresh squeezed juices and dialed back the sugar to about half what was called for.  Next time we make it, we may try it without any sugar. Absolutely let this recipe sit in your fridge overnight and stir it every few hours to submerge the fruit that is on top. We tried it after making it and again the next day, and it was significantly better the next day.

This recipe can easily be adapted to the ingredients you have on hand.  The first time I made this on the spur of the moment, and didn't have any of the citrus fruits, or the lemonade concentrate, or the orange juice.  So I substituted Margarita mix for the lemonade, and fresh strawberries for the citrus fruit,  and it was delicious.

Huge hit with my family.  I will definitely make this again.  Rather than add sugar I added the jar of maraschino cherries, juice and all.  The sugar in the cherries was just perfect and no additional sugar was needed.

A hit every single time. I use cheap Cabernet, cheap brandy, orange liqueur sometimes instead of triple sec. I like to mix up the fruits. I have found that I don't like to add the sugar until after it's sat for a day because sometimes it gets too sweet. Whatever I use, this sangria always disappears at parties.

This recipe is wonderful! I love sangria but never made it before. My fiancé and I loved it. He even said it was the best sangria he'd ever had. We added strawberries and an apple so it wasn't too citrusy. A hit!

It was very good as per the recipe.  We could have used a sweeter version so next time I will eliminate the club soda and use ginger ale instead.  IMPORTANT ~ letting it set overnight or about 8 hours really makes a difference!  Mix ingredients the night before except for  club soda/ginger ale.  Add club soda or ginger ale just before serving.  YUM!

I made this recipe with two minor revisions. I don't eat high fructose corn syrup so I swapped out the lemonade concentrate for Newman's All natural lemonade.  I doubled the recipe and used about one quart of lemonade.  I also reduced the regular sugar to two tablespoons.  It got many compliments.

This is now our go to beverage for get togethers. We add the optional sugar and Sprite but skip the cherry.  Have made it four or five times and each time our guests plow through it quickly.

This was a nice recipe. I made a double batch and it was all gone. Without sugar was plenty sweet with the fruit juices. I used 7up to top because that's what I had but anything would do - champagne, ginger ale... Ahead of time I prepared all the fixings for an extra half batch except for the wine so I could pack it and bring it with me so I could easily create the second batch during our family gathering and that was a good idea since the first batch disappeared so quickly.

This really is great sangria! Due to the addition of brandy and triple sec it is super strong in flavor and alcohol, be warned. Adding ginger ale makes it taste more like a traditional restaurant sangria. Great recipe and I will make this my go to for sangria in the future!

I've made this at least half a dozen times and every time it's hit, I always get asked for the recipe. I opt for ginger-ale instead of club soda per the author's suggestion for a sweeter sangria. Yum Yum for Sangria Sangria!

Brilliant recipe.  Doubled it and it worked out fine.  It can be a little strong for some people so I added Soda Water to their drink and they seemed quiet happy!

I make this for every party and block party I have been to. I always get rave reviews on it. I leave out the lemonade concentrate (as I usually don't have access to that, and Sangria from Spain or Mexico wouldn't have it in anyway). We lived in Mexico and EVERYONE loved this. The key is making it in advance so that the flavors really meld. I always make it at least the morning of the day before I intend to serve it. You can make it earlier than that, just don't add the fruit pieces until 24-36 hours before. 

When we lived in Mexico, I used Rioja wine to make it (a cheapish one as you don't need high quality wine in this mixed drink). In the U.S., I have used Cabernet as I was unable to find Rioja.

I usually have Sprite and club soda on hand for people to add to it themselves. Some people don't want it watered down at all and some people prefer sweeter.

Whoa! This is great, much better than any sangria I've ordered in a restaurant. This is not a terribly sweet cocktail, which is what I prefer. I never use very expensive wines in this recipe (~$8 bottle), but I think the end result will depend on how sweet of a red wine you choose. This drink is STRONG. Definitely dilute with sparkling water as suggested. I'm a heavy wine drinker and I cannot handle more than 1-2 glasses of this at most. GREAT for summer dinner parties by the pool!

Awesome! I tripled the recipe and used half ginger ale and half club soda. I used Spanish red wine Tempranillo. I don't think it needs all the sugar listed maybe half. I used a 3 gallon drink container and it was about 2/3's full. Perfect! Very forgiving and huge hit!
Update: made as stated except but doubled it, used frozen pink lemonade (as that's what I had), didn't add the sugar or carbonated water.  Let it sit overnight and then in morning added one can of sprite. It was perfect and everyone raved!

I forgot to get the frozen lemonade so I added ginger ale instead of the club soda to add some sweetness. No sugar.  Used bag of frozen mixed fruits.   I also used apple brandy.  Definitely by far, the best sangria I have made this far. I still added the fruit the recipe suggests and went by all the recipe measurements.

Made this for a family cookout and thankfully made a double batch starting with a 1.5 liter of Merlot wine, and there was not a drop left! I did the exact recipe with 2 exceptions- I used two different brandies, one part regular brandy and one part cherry brandy (only because I thought I was going to be short on the regular brandy) and I didn't have Triple Sec, I had to use Cointreau (just another orange liqueur). It all fit in a really large pitcher that I have even doubling the fruit slices and the cherries you put in and I definitely made it the day before.  Right before serving, I did add 1 can of cold diet ginger ale just to cut it a little bit (although it was great without it too because I had to try it!!) and also added frozen cherries as ice cubes in the glasses before pouring! A true winner! And was asked for the recipe over and over!

This was the first time I made Sangria and it turned out great!  I added ginger ale and also added the sugar -- it was not too sweet; just perfect.  Made a double batch using 2 bottles of red wine and doubled everything else. Put in mixed fresh fruit and it was so refreshing!  Guests at my party all enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Every time I make this I get requests for the recipe. I omit the sugar since it doesn't need it. I also use Ginger Ale instead of Club Soda. Last weekend I subbed white wine for red and think it's just as good. Best if you let it sit a day before you drink. Salud!

I've had much better Sangria.  Pretty much an Cactus Club (for example) has a Sangria way bettter than this.  They also made significant  mistake in the instructions, that is, they tell you add the club soda THEN they tell to to let it sit overnight to allow the Sangria to absorb the fruit.  That's pretty dumb (for obvious reasons).

NOTE: I did skip the sugar, now that I think of it, it would taste better if it was sweeter.

I made this as a large batch for 20, and just changed a few things. I left out the maraschino cherries, added 3/4 cup of lemon vodka for an extra kick and used lemon lime soda instead of club soda. We let it sit over night and it was wonderful. We will definitely do thIs again.

First time we added the specified sugar amount and it was way too sweet.  Second time we left out the sugar and it was much better.   It was a big hit at a friends pool party.

Didn't have lemonade concentrate,  so used fresh lemonade instead. Added 1 diced red delicious apple. Did not add sugar, but added 2/3 can diet Canada dry. Used blackberry brandy. Fabulous!

I made this for a party today, and oh my gosh it was too sweet!  The sangria I've had overseas wasn't liquid candy. Possibly a good recipe but it's going to need some major tinkering not to make me cringe next time.

Found this a bit tart even though I did put in the sugar as well as used the ginger ale.   I made it first thing in the morning for the evening and I found that I tasted a bit of the rind flavor from the fruit which I do not like.     I also prefer using fruit that can then be eaten (oranges and cherries being the only fruit you will eat from this).  I like apples, berries etc.

I upped the serving size to 40 for a Memorial Day BBQ, and at that size, I realized it is almost *exactly* ONE of everything! There was no leftover alcohol to store for weeks in my cupboard or measuring cups to wash. Could not have been simpler!

- ONE bottle of brandy (750mL)
- ONE bottle of lemon juice (443mL, standard 15 oz.)
- ONE can frozen lemonade concentrate (12oz.) [The exact adjustment would have been about 1.5 cans, but since I don't drink lemonade and didn't know what I would do with that last half can, I decided to just use one.]
- ONE box of Merlot (5 L, 169oz.) [The exact adjustment called for 6.75 750mL bottles. I used a $14 box of Franzia, which comes out to just under 6.66 standard bottles of wine. Close enough.]
- ONE bottle of triple sec (750ML)
- ONE med. jar maraschino cherries (16oz.)
- 2.25 cups OJ (18oz.)
- 6 limes, 6 lemons, 6 oranges
- Sugar to taste

Except for the OJ, I didn't have to measure anything! 

Sorry for the mixing of metric and imperial measurements. I used whatever measure was most common for the item. 


**Also, since I made it the day of in a last minute rush, I heated up a bit of wine to help dissolve the sugar faster.

I'm not a wine drinker but my friends are. I went with this recipe because of the positive reviews and this was a HUGE hit!! I followed the recipe to a T with 2 additions fresh cherries along with the marichino and I added New York black cherry seltzer with ginger ale and no sugar. I multiplied the recipe *4 and it was amazing. I tasted it when I put it together and the over night marinade is a must. The taste difference is night and day!! Follow the directions and you won't go wrong!! Thank you so much for the recipe! This is definite a recipe I'll keep doing. It would make my Spanish Grandma so happy if she was still here to enjoy.

I made this for our monthly ladies night, and it was a hit. I doubled the recipe because I knew it wasn't going to be enough. I added strawberries,apples, and  instead of club soda I used ginger ale. I used about 2 scoops of sugar and no lime. One of the ladies requested that I make it for the next ladies night.

This is my go-to sangria recipe. I love it. Not too sweet, not too citrusy. I have also made it with a dry white wine and it's just as good. A great summer drink - but potent!!

This sangria was awesome.  I made it per directions.  I did use cherry brandy because that is what I had on hand.  We served it at a family dinner and everyone loved it.

I just made it for a party tomorrow. I tasted it and it's already delicious. I can't wait to try it! :-)

I have a question: Does the recipe call for freshly squeezed  lemon juice and freshly squeezed orange juice (or for already made orange juice like Tropicana?)

THANKS FOR SHARING!!

SO good!!  Best sangria I've made. I used half triple sec, half peach liqueur because I didn't check the cupboard before I started and didn't have enough triple sec   Didn't matter...pitcher was empty in a flash and got the party off to a great start!  Will definitely be a staple and all my summer gatherings.

This is my sangria go to recipe I have made this several times with great success, EVERYONE LOVES IT!!! I use minute-maid frozen lemonade and gingerale instead of the carbonated water I make simple syrup instead of adding pure sugar.

I like it better without the sparkling water. And I didn't have triple sec so I used something called aromatic bitter that I found at the supermarket.  Love sangria.

This recipe was excellent. It was just the thing for our girls night! For seven of us I tripled the recipe and had plenty. For the most part I followed the recipe as is except I used spiced rum and peach schnapps instead of brandy and triple sec. It wasn't as potent to me. Just had a nice relaxed feeling all evening.  I used ginger ale instead of club soda and sugar, used apples and oranges for the fruit. I served it over ice. My one regret is that i didn't let it set overnight.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made this for the professional championship football game and all the guests, even the guys, loved it!  I decided to make two separate batches.  With the first (red sangria), I used merlot (you need a medium-bodied red wine), Christian Brothers brandy (cheap), and a Patron Orange Liqueur (you can find a cheaper one).  For the second, I wanted to make a white sangria.  With that, I used Reisling (instead of the red wine), Captain Morgan Spiced Rum (substitute for the brandy), and Peach Schapps (vs the orange liqueur).   Per the recommendation of other reviewers, I omitted (or you can use half of) the sugar.  I chilled in the refrigerator overnight BEFORE adding the fruit.  I added the fruit a few hours before the guests would arrive (I added oranges, lemons, limes, grapes, strawberries, and apples).  Again, absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to have another event so I can try this one again.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe (with my suggestions).  Enjoy!!!  P.S.  If your containers are plastic and aren't stain-resistant, fruit will damage it if left in overnight (specifically oranges, lemons, and limes as they are acidic).  Some plastic containers even discourage adding liquor above 7.5% for that same reason.  I purchased glass, 2.5 gallon pitchers for this.  Worth it!!

I made this 10 years ago for my husband's 40th birthday party, and the whole party loved it.  My only problem was that it tasted so good, and I had too much of it, without realizing it packs a punch.  I'm making it again for his 50th.

I make this all the time. I've been using this particular recipe for about 10 years. I'm guessing I've made it over 20 times in total. I only make a few changes and it always turns out amazing and gets the whole family real drunk. 

What I do:
1. I don't care if the wine is dry or sweet, I just buy the cheapest stuff I can find that isn't boxed. I taste it. If its really sweet, I cut pack a bit on the orange juice. If it isn't so sweet I keep the OJ the same.  
2. Since the first batch, I NEVER add cherries (just kinda tasted weird and added their syrup to the recipe) or lemons/limes (too sour---I like to eat my fruit as I'm drinking the sangria)...
3. So I add more oranges and if I know it's all gonna be gone soon, I add apple slices (DO NOT add them if you aren't gonna be drinking it all the next day...cos the longer they are in there the slimier they get). 
4.I also never add the sugar (it's sweet enough) or carbonated water (detracts from the taste/my sweet buzz).

Always, no mater how much you want to drink it now, wait til the next day to drink it.

Fantastic recipe! I use ginger ale instead of club soda and then eliminate the sugar... That gives it just enough sweetness. I also add 1-2 apples and pears cut up, which add a tasty finish to your drink. You must make it the night before, otherwise it won't taste the same!!

Altered this recipe slightly. Used cherry brandy. Limeade concentrate (instead of lemonade), didn't add any sugar, and added ginger ale 30 mins prior to serving. Oh and mixed in some blackberries.  It was a huge hit.

If you are used to Sangrias from Mexico or any other country than Spain, it is not going to be the same. I love traveling to Spain, and Sangria is one of my favorite drinks. I make this quite often, here are my changes: No lemonade concentrate (ew), I squeeze a lemon and a lime instead. Instead of carbonated water (I just don't like it), I will use a splash of Sprite. I will juice oranges if I have them on hand, if not, then orange juice will do. No sugar, that's what the fresh fruit is for. I agree with the other reviewer from Madrid, it should be fruity, not too sweet, and strong (Brandy is a must). Enjoy

This Sangria was the hit of the party!  I used a sweeter wine (Lambrusco) and cut the sugar in half.  I also added blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries in addition to the oranges, lemons and lime.  I didn't use any carbonated water, didn't want to water it down!  I definitely will make this again!

Fabulous recipe! I used blackberry brandy, omitted the sugar. Cut the strength with ginger ale. Removed fruit after several hours so it stayed fresh, and still delicious after 3 days!

To make 24 servings I ommited the lemon juice in liue of using the entire can of frozen lemonade. Was a HIT at Thanksgiving this year. 5 stars!

I used this recipe to make my first sangria for my mother-in-law's 60th bday party. It turned out awesome!!! I read the reviews and made some changes considering the crowd at the party. I had rum at home so I used that instead of brandy. Since my mother in law likes sweet drinks I didn't cut the sugar completely but used half of what the recipe called for. I used ginger ale instead of soda water and waited until the party to add that so that it wouldn't be flat (You can always add more if you think it's still dry and taste more like wine) I made it a night before and let it sit overnight. I took some of the oranges and lemons out in the morning so it wouldn't be too citrusy. I added apples and strawberries in the morning as well. Make sure to at least double the recipe since it's gonna be the most popular drink at the party!

I make this every Christmas and just for fun on occasion!  Love it!!!!  I use 1 bottle of Pinot Grigio for a white sangria.  You can also switch out brandy for rum (spice rum too) and it's just as tasty.  I don't add sugar, but instead do what other posters have suggested and just add in 7-Up.

So I came across this recipe and thought it was going to be a hit. Everyone at the BBQ was upset. Upset because it wasn't enough. I made 3 times the recipe but accidentally added a little too much brandy(1/2 cup to be exact). Again its for 3 times the recipe. Everyone loved it. I didn't add any sugar nor the mineral water. I found it sweet enough and don't really like fizz. I made my recipe with spanish brandy and spanish wine(rioja) and added small slices of cantaloupe. It goes great with fruit. Thank you so much for the recipe. It is very authentic.

Made a 12 serving recipe of this for a dinner party without ever having tried it before.  I made it EXACTLY to the specifications provided, including the optional white sugar !!!  It was a HIT and we ended up drinking the whole thing and making more before the evening was over !!!  What a DELICIOUS drink (and so pretty, too !!)  I had requests to know what the recipe included !!!  Thank you for this great recipe !!!  I will be making this MANY more times in the future !!!!  : )

Most delicious Sangria I have ever made! Prepared it for my friend's wedding but used 7-Up instead of carbonated water and everyone loved it so much – we had to make more! Received so many compliments! Thank you H.Jacoby!

Delicious!! I was distracted, and without thinking, just dumped the entire can of frozen lemonade concentrate into the pitcher, so I just skipped the lemon juice. I added 1-2 tablespoons of sugar. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written, and this sangria was SO fantastic! Really delicious, everyone loved it. I will definitely be making a lot of this in the future.

Fabulous! 

I used blackberry brandy. And 1/3 cup lemonade concentrate plus 1/3 cup orange juice concentrate. No juice and No sugar. 

For the fruit: pineapple chunks, mini manadarin orange slices, and dark cherries soak up the wine and make a wonderful drunken fruit. 

Marinate overnight in the fridge, then add 1 liter club soda just before serving. Give your guests a long teaspoon to scoop out the fruit!

I made this sangria for a July 4h party and it was a huge hit!  I quadrupled the recipe to make sure I had enough and I still ran out!  I made it the evening before so the flavors would have a chance to blend.  Fantastic!

Toured Spain a few years ago and drank plenty of Sangria. For making it myself, thought it was a great version. Also made a white wine version. Made both for a dinner party and it was a hit.

Best sangria recipe ever. I have been asked to make this for countless gatherings including my friends wedding. Everybody races about it and there is never a drop left. Be carful though it is delicious and sneaks up on you. I usually use a box of red wine and a just the liquid ingredients to a serving of 30 makes enough for a large party. I also omitt the triple sec because my mom and I are both allergic to it.

I made this for a party I went to. I was little scared I wasn't going to like it after I first tasted it since there was so much alcohol in it. I didn't add any sugar and added sprite just before I served it. It was a hit! Everybody loved my sangria! Would definitely make it again!

Amazing amazing amazing!  after reading all the review I thought I would have to play with the recipe a few times to find the right one for me but I'm sold on the first try! I followed the recipe except I didn't add sugar. Definitely need to let it sit 24 hours to allow the fruit to naturally sweeten it. I did add a splash of ginger ale (small splash like maybe a tablespoon to my large glass lol )to my glass just to see what it taste like and it was amazing.  I did try it before adding the ginger ale and it was also amazing!  Definitely my new to go to drink! so refreshing on these warm summer days.  ENJOY!

First time I ever made Sangria and it was a HIT in my home! I even took it to my neighbors and they loved it and asked me to make a large batch for a jewlrey party their having.  The first time I had Sangria was in Chicago on St. Paddy's day and I could never find a place to compare too.  Now, a Sommilier in training, I gotta say, this is a Party FAV!

I've made this twice and everyone always loves it!  I make it exactly according to the recipe but don't use the optional carbonated water. I usually have to at least quadruple the recipe and found that you can get away with using inexpensive, boxed red wine.  I had the same experience as another reviewer - that the men who started out with beer and chose to stick with it when offered the sangria changed their minds after they tasted it and abandoned their beers and drank the sangria for the rest of the evening.  Definitely make it the night before for best taste. If you have leftovers after your event I suggest removing the fruit.

Oh my! This was my first attempt at making sangria and it so good! I made 2 pitchers, one with blackberry brandy, the other with white rum. I didn't add the sugar and it was just fine. Both were good, but I preferred the one with the rum. Try this recipe. You will not be disappointed! In fact, I am making a double batch for a Christmas Eve gathering and I can't wait to drink it again. Yum!!

I made this the first time for a huge 50th birthday party and it was such a big hit that everywhere I am invited, I am asked to bring it again!  I can't just double the recipe anymore, I have to make it x4 or more, LOL.  We are partial to the 7-up also and sometimes add other fruits like pineapple and apple, etc. and omit the sugar.  Leaving it to sit overnight, it turns out delicious every time.

Tried it.  Excellent.  I made a recipe and a half to fully fill the pitcher I was using, and it turned out perfectly. The key is letting it sit overnight to let all the flavors blend and mature together.  Used blackberry brandy and also nectarines, which we ended up digging out of the pitcher to eat. Delish!!!!

It was amazing!! Brought it to a friends birthday party! It was a huge hit! I made a double batch of it. I used Rum instead of the brandy. Did not add sugar-already sweet enough. Also used ginger ale instead of carbonated water. And also let it set for 24 hours in the fridge. Thanks to some of the reviews for the tips on adjusting the recipe a bit!

So tasty everyone always asks for the recipe! Only changes I make are that I don't use any sugar or cherries and, so that the batch goes further, I add a litre of flavored soda water (lime and wild cherry are my favourites :)

This recipe is fairly forgiving. I made a triple batch for a barbecue on the 4th of July. I didn't have limes to slice up, so I substituted a third of the OJ with lime juice. I added sliced apples, frozen strawberries and frozen blueberries to this the first night. The second night, I pulled all of the citrus and apples out and added a cinnamon stick and two mixed fruit cups to slightly alter the flavor. I used cheap Christian Brothers VS brandy and BOTA box Shiraz (which I love anyway), plus triple sec. It tasted FANTASTIC, but I wasn't feeling more than a little buzzed after several glasses. Maybe I'll skip the ginger ale next time. ;)

I have made many sangria's and this is the best by far.  I don't like mine too tart, so I don't add lemon juice, lemons or limes.  I use the oranges and also some apples too, depends on what I have on hand.  I use a sweeter red wine and no sugar.  I am asked to make this for every holiday and get together.  I always make a double batch and that usually isn't enough.  It goes down like juice but really packs a punch!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good sangria recipe. I had no lemonade concentrate so I just added extra lemon juice and sugar. I also used fresh orange juice. Very refreshing and very tasty.

I loved this recipe, but tweeted it a little for our tastes. I doubled the recipe, (used a Tempranillo for the red wine) added tequila, about a cup, also added fresh pineapple & a firm apple, cut into small pieces, a handful of grapes & a sliced kiwi to the fruit. I substituted a jar of natural bing cherries for the maraschino cherries (no artificial coloring or sugar additives) and used the cherry syrup in place of the sugar in the recipe. Then I used sparkling water rather than the lemon-lime soda. It came out great, everyone raved about it & wanted the recipe, which I posted the original on Facebook. Thanks, HJacoby, for submitting!

I always make a double batch, use real lemon juice, merlot wine, sugar, cherry brandy, and ginger ale instead of carbonated soda.  Also, let it marinate for at least 24 hours; that way the flavors marry and the wine has time to mellow out. A good trick to keeping it cold without ice, use frozen cherries!  Yummy!  It was gone in no time the first time I made it so I learned to make extra!

Made it for the second time last night. I add a little bit of the maraschino juice and use gingerly. I like the added zing from the ginger. I'll try using a flavored brandy next time for added flavor. This definitely is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe so many times...and get loads of compliments each time.  When the next person needs to make sangria, they always come to me for "my" recipe.  I try to stick with the fruit listed in this recipe, but you can definitely make it with other fruits.

Add the sugar to the cut up fruit, while you mix the other ingredients.  Let it sit overnight and it's much better.  I use tempranillo wine and have huge success.

I didn't have enough triple sec and was out of orange juice. Mixed up what I had which was everything else. I only had 1/3rd the required amount of triple sec.  I gave it a sample before going to get orange juice and more triple sec.  It tasted great! Like all other good sangria's I've had. Got oj and ts, added, tasted again. Not as good.  Left if fridge overnight. Again, not as good. The triple sec is just way to strong. Adds that synthetic orange type of flavor triple sec has and is just overbearing. I think using about 1/3 the recommended sugar is also a good idea. I didn't use carbonated water or ginger ale.  Next time I make this I'm going to do it exactly to the recipe, but with only 1/4 of the oj, 1/4 the triple sec, and 1/3rd the sugar.  I'm betting that will nail it.

I'd advise you to taste as you add though, and add these 3 ingredients last.  Dial it in how just how you like it.

This was a big hit at Tapas party I hosted.   I followed it to the letter, using Trader Joe's Velvet Moon cabernet sauvignon and including the optional 1/4 cup sugar and club soda.  It only macerated for about 3 hours and had plenty of flavor.   Personally, I found it a bit too sweet but not in an objectionable way.  Next time I'll try it without the sugar.  This recipe is a keeper!

I really liked the way this came out. I used Merlot for the red wine. I did leave out the suggested cup of sugar. I'm really glad I did because it's overly sweet without it. I didn't wait to let it sit overnight to try it and it was still good. I let it sit in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. Although, the leftover Sangria was better the next day after having sat in the fridge overnight. It would be nice to dial back the sugar even more-maybe less of the lemon frozen concentrate and replace with fresh lemon juice. The carbonated water was a nice addition and even helped dilute the sweetness of it. I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and it made it even more delicious! -Cheers! :-)

So good! I didn't have frozen lemonade OR enough lemons to get 1/4c of lemon juice so I just juiced 1/2c or so of lime juice and added 2 Tablespoons sugar to make it sweet like frozen limeade. I opted out of adding the extra sugar to sweeten at the end and used a sprite before serving. I let it sit 4 hrs and had to taste. Delicious!! Will be making this again;)

Made this last night for our neighborhood LNO and everyone loved it!  I tripled the batch and ran out.  Next time I will make more.  Will have to get a bigger punch bowl!  I also put a whole bottle of champagne in just before I served it. It was delicious!

I've been sadly drinking this Sangria daily. As others have mentioned, the sprite/club soda should only go in individual glasses as you're serving the drink, not over night. It is indeed delicious!!!!

Holy cow this was good!  I took the reviewer suggestion of using a plum merlo and think it made the drink spectacular.  I had several people ask for the recipe.

I first prepared this for a Christmas get together 2 years ago, quadrupling the recipe so I would have plenty. Everyone loved it, and there was some leftovers I used a week later for another party. It was still delicious. The secret is to let the flavors develop, and depending on how bitter the peel is on your citrus fruit, will last a couple of weeks.

What a fabulous recipe! All of my friends loved it and begged for the recipe. I kept everything the same except made a simple syrup instead of straight up sugar...definitely give this recipe a try, tastes just like sangria at an upscale restaurant.

This was delicious. Made it for a party, I tripled the recipe and it was all gone by the end of the night. I served it with carbonated water (about 50/50 ratio) and it was still very strong and tasty. Guests raved about it. We even ate the liquor soaked cherries at the end!

I tripled this recipe and made it for an office party.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I used the sugar and a mix of club soda and Sprite to get to the right sweetness.  This is a keeper.

I made 40 Litres worth (90 servings) over the weekend for my Girlfriends's 30th. It was an absolute hit! Everybody loved it and we went through the 40L in 3 hours. Surprisingly the compliments were about how good it was without being too sweet.
I largely followed SCRAPBOOKNWIFE's recommendations, but by making 40 L I had a lot of room to improvise. I used mainly white Rum instead of brandy (It's a lot cheaper) and mainly Peach Schnapps instead of Triple Sec. I cut up a whole pineapple, added 2 lbs of frozen strawberries, 15 oranges, NO Sugar, I didn't add any lemon's or cherries, only a few limes and what little lemon juice I had. I used ginger ale, grapefruit pop and 7-up and added Peach Drink, Berry Medley and Lemonade Frozen concentrates along with orange juice. Plus the 12L of red wine.
I made it all the night before aside from adding the soda pop which I put in just before the party!

I'll be making it again!

OMG. This is so good it's ridiculous.  The only thing I did differently than the recipe was to add frozen peach slices and frozen pineapple chunks.  I did let it refrigerate overnight and then added 2 cups of Sprite Zero right before serving.  The entire pitcher was gone in no time and everyone wanted the recipe! Fabulous!!!

Made 5 times the recipe for a pool party and everyone loved it! I did not use as many fruits as the recipe called for and I thought it was perfect. Definitely a keeper. Many of the guests said it was the best sangria they ever had.

I added the optional sugar and carbonated water.  I only had time for the Sangria to sit for 5 hours and it still tasted great!  I will definitely make this again when I have time for the Sangria to sit overnight.

Brought it to a neighborhood block party and it got lots of compliments. Used an inexpensive bottle of rioja, apples, plums, peaches and raspberries, added an orange the day of to avoid any bitterness. I also tried an inexpensive bottle of blackberry brandy, since that was one of the flavors in the wine.
I also used orange juice so I wouldn't have to go out and buy triple sec just for the recipe. Turned out really yummy and perfect with something fizzy - ginger ale or club soda. Make the night before and definitely taste test it to get the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Great recipe and will continue to use!

I made this for my sister's baby shower and it was a HIT! I took "MAMASPICE" review and went with her suggestion of using EL Presidente brandy and spanish Riojo wine. (I passed on using the carbonated water and white sugar) Since we had approximately 65 guests coming I wasn't sure how to gauge it so I made 2 gallons. I prepared it 24 hours ahead of time and stored 1 gallon in a glass beverage container with a spigot, and the other gallon in a reserve pitcher. The next day, I unveiled it and you could get drunk off the fumes, which wasn't a bad thing, but I didn't want my guests hammered after one drink. So, needless to say, I poured half of it out into a reserve pitcher to use for later and what I just poured out of the serving container I filled to the top with ginger ale. Thankfully, it sweetened it up perfectly, yet you could still taste all the flavors of the brandy, the wine and fresh fruit. I would say 90% percent was all gone by the end of the party. So if you want to keep it on the sweeter side fill half of whatever container you use with Sangria and the other half with ginger ale and only add the ginger ale right before serving. CHeers!

A perfect Sangria recipe for all those outdoor Summer parties. No Brandy, so I substituted Cognac.
I'm pouring this Friday night when our block starts the weekend round of "cocktail" get togethers. Pour over ice, add a splash of seltzer. What could be easier? Get fancy and add some Chambord instead of Triple Sec & add additional summer fruits to the pitcher.

Just mixed up a batch and, of course, had to do a taste test. Only change made was the addition of 1/2 cup of spiced rum and used Pellegrino instead of soda water. Fabulous flavour. This pitcher probably won't make it through the overnight resting period!

Fabulous Recipe! I've always wanted to make Sangria and this is the first recipe that I've tried. Definitely a keeper! I think it was a bit strong. We added more ginger ale and made this much more drinkable and refreshing.

Thank you!

Made this recipe this weekend for a barbecue and it was a definite hit! This was my first time making Sangria so I was a little worried that it might not turn out. Followed the recipe exactly and it was great! I plan to change things up next time with different fruits and try with a white wine. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it!  I added a green apple, used a Cabernet and used half the sugar and it was super good.  The apples really made it great. I also made it early in the morning so the fruit had plenty of time to soak up the alcohol and flavor the wine.  Make sure to get fruit into your glass because it was the best part.  I used 1/4 sparkling water to 3/4 sangria in each cup.  YUM.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious! The only change I made was that I added about a 1/4 cup of Amaretto, but that was only because I mistook it for the brandy bottle on accident.  I will probably keep that in the recipe the next time I make it though because it was so good!

Very good. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon and provided ginger ale to mix with it before serving. I thought it could use a little more sweetness, so will add some more sugar next time.  It was a hit at our Christmas get together.

Turned out great! I used a large bottle of cab to double the recipie.  My only change was I used about 1/2 cup of simple syrup to help it mix better.
Simple syrup - boil 1 cup sugar in 1 cup water, cool, and use

The best ever! I removed the peels from the oranges, lemoms and lime, based on several comments that the peel made it bitter after a bit, used half apricot and half cherry brandy. The fruit I had on on hand were dark cherries and  strawberries. This was heavenly. I need more wine so I can make it again. Lovely!

I like it, but I tweaked it to reduce the bitter/sour flavor.

I halved the limes and halved the number of lemon rounds. I omitted the frozen lemonade concentrate. I used the sugar. Prior to serving, I added a bit of orange soda, to taste. I kept a six pack of orange soda on hand all night. I used smoking loon cabernet sauvignon for the first batch. People really liked it and it was finished quickly. I refilled with trader joe's $2 charles shaw cab and the correct proportions of brandy and triple sec. I kept orange soda on hand and kept refilling. 

Watch out for the bitterness!

This is a delicious recipe! If you are using a sweeter red wine, you may want to adjust to less sugar added (taste it first!) otherwise it ends up being sugar overload.  You don't need to use an expensive wine either- all the ingredients meld together really well to make this a really enjoyable drink!

Great base recipe. A little too much citrus for me though. On my second batch I followed the directions exactly, except I omitted the lemon juice, limes and lemons. Also, omitted the club soda/ginger ale. I added mangos and pears (plus the oranges) instead and it was fabulous!! I served it at a neighborhood party and it was a hit.

Delicious and STRONG! I was going to a potluck lunch at a friend's house where I didn't know the other guests. The sangria was a hit the second I walked through the door - who doesn't like sangria? After a glass of this stuff, forget about being shy! Be particularly careful measuring out the frozen lemonade as it changes the sweetness of the recipe dramatically. Think about making two batches and letting them marinate with the sliced fruit overnight. My first batch was gone really fast! Definitely worth purchasing the hard liquor.

I use 7-Up instead of sugar and carbonated water, and I make sure to slice the fruits thickly, otherwise I find it's a little too much citrus for my taste.
I've also been adding red raspberries and pineapples recently - super good!

The crowd pleaser! It vanishes everytime I make it!  Only added about a tablespoon of sugar.  This time I let people take it how they wanted it...over gingerale, stright up or over Asti Spumante champaigne.  SOOO GOOD!  Make sure you double or triple the recipe and make a day ahead.

I made this according to the directions with the exception of making a simple syrup for the sugar, it was heavenly... A must have for any future event!

Had some work friends over and it was a HIT! Didn't use cherries or sugar and used ginger ale instead of club soda. I had sliced the fruit into really small pieces like at my favorite sangria place but I think next time I will use larger slices.

Upped this recipe for 30 servings and still wasn't enough.  Used 5 bottle of Jacobs Creek Shiraz.  Didn't add the sugar and didn't miss it. Put it all together the night before (except for the soda, which I used Sprite and added as we drank it) and let it marinate.  Used suggested fruits and added red grapes.  So good!  Packs a punch.  Will be the standard I use from now on!

I made this for a BBQ, quadrupling the original recipe, and it was all gone before the end of the night.  My guests raved about it and they all wanted the recipe.  I also used ginger ale in place of the club soda and only added half the sugar.  It was the best sangria I have ever had and will be making this over and over again.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was ok. I used a port wine instead of brandy which may have caused the really strong taste. And I didn't use sugar and added sprite before serving. Everything else I did the same but it was too potent for me. Once I added the sprite it was much better but still disappointing after all the great reviews.

This is the first recipe that I have ever rated on AllRecipes, although I have been using the site for years!  Love, LOVE this recipe.  Always gets rave reviews.  I did decide not to add sugar or carbonated water, but instead used lemon-lime soda.  I use a 1:1 ratio.  Very refreshing!

Made this for my weekend bbq and it was a huge hit.  Used apples, pears, cherries and mangoes.  My only grip is I didn't double the recipe.  Next time I know better.  Can't wait to make this again.

I made this recipe last summer for my boyfriend parents who are big wine drinkers. I used just a cheap bottle of red wine, peach schnapps instead of triple sec, and used mangos, oranges, and peaches.

This is a great base recipe, you can add any fruit you like and it still tatest great! I would agree with other reviews that throwing this together and letting it "marinate" overnight is key to the outcome.

So easy and really good. I made this for a party and everyone was asking me for the recipe. One thing I would do differntly next time... I would add about a cup more of wine and maybe a little less orange juice.

This is delicious!  I used half of a sliced orange and half the amount of club soda.  Added this and let the whole thing sit overnight. It was the best I have ever had, and friends said the same thing too.  Very satisfying and refreshing. Thank you.

I tried this recipe. I used peach brandy and I used the triple sec. I also added 2 1/2 cups ginger ale so it wouldn't be as strong.For me it is a little to strong and the triple sec gives it a taste I don't care for to much. It is a little bitter tasting to me. But,I do need to add I have never had Sangria before, so I am not saying it is not a good recipe. I was hoping for something with a smooth fruity taste.

When you use a really good spanish wine, it can make you very tipsy!  I had a cook out and made Anne's fruit salsa from this website.  My friends added the fruit salsa in this sangria recipe.  Very very good!

Left out the cherries and used peach schnapps instead of triple sec.  Great recipe, but it makes a lot!  If you are going to save it for a few days I suggest taking the citrus out after 24 hours.

Pretty good sangria. Not sure if it's similar to the real thing or not but it was pretty good and I would make it again. I liked it better with some ginger ale added to it also.

This is the best sangria I have ever tasted.  I only added one bottle of soda water because there was no room in the large container I used - it was a multiple recipe for a big party.  Every bit of it was gone at the end of the evening.  Thanks!

This is gooooooood....and strong!  I made this for my daughters 1st birthday party.  I had several people comment on how good it was and they aren't even drinkers.  Definitely let it sit at least overnight!  I didn't add the 7-up or club soda, but I might try that next time cause I think that would be really good too!

This was delicious and easy to make.  It even gets better as it sits.  i didn't have regular brandy on hand, so i substituted apricot brandy.  After 24 hours I removed the fruit so it wouldn't ferment or turn bitter.  One week later, I had some leftover and it was even more delicious.  I used Cabernet Saugvignon for the wine.

Ahh... sangria as it should be.  I did not add the sugar, but did add about 1 cup of club soda.  I also threw in an apple.  Perfection in a pitcher.  Yum.

Made this over the weekend ... it was wonderful !  Ended up drinking the whole thing with a girlfriend!  I added limeade instead of lemonade just because I didn't have any. Left out the cherries too. I'm going to try and make a white sangria next.

We jazzed it up with a little more of everything, due to individual taste and then brought it to a BBQ.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

Awesome! I took a 1.5 L bottle of Inglenook Merlot-- (cheap-- about $6.00) and I doubled the ingredients. It was wonderful. My company loved it. I didn't add limes. I let it sit in the fridge about 4 - 5 hours.  Will DEFINETLEY make again!

Made this Sangria for our July Sangria & Summer Wine Party. Friends helped me taste test the week before!I made several batches to the T but without the sodas. I used different reds (Malbec, Merlot, & a Cabernet) did use the cherries & some juice along with a partially ripened peach.
OMG we let it sit in Fridge for 48 hrs. and what a difference 1 more day can make. We did really like the Malbec Sangria it had a different flavor.

This is a great item to keep in the fridge during the summer in case company comes by or just when the mood strikes.  It is good to make in the morning for a dinner cook out.  Also, I do not bother with the fruit since it takes up room in the glass.  Just pour it over ice and yum, yum.  Be careful! It has a punch and goes down really easy!!!

This is a VERY tasty Sangria. I am NOT a red wine fan, but I really enjoyed this mixture very much. I left out the marachino cherries (don't like cherries), but followed the rest of the recipe verbatim. My company raved about it and I enjoyed it, too! Definitely a keeper recipe and will make it again.

I followed one of the readers suggestion to substitute Captain Morgans and Peach Schnapps for the triple sec and brandy and have handed this recipe out countless times.  You can add gingerale before serving if you don't want it so strong.

I have made this for cookouts for the last year, and it is by far the best Sangria!  I don't change a thing except quadruple the recipe, and it's gone in no time.  Definitely needs to sit overnight.  I serve mine over crushed ice.  Also, I use the big jug 'o wine, even though I would never drink that stuff alone, it doesn't matter in this recipe because there are so many other ingredients.  Wonderful recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly, except for the optional items.  Did not need the sugar or carbonated water.  Let the mix(without the wine) sit in the fridge over night, it was fantastic.  My new summer drink.  I will make this over and over.

I had to try this recipe with all of the rave reviews, and wow were they right. I have since made this Sangria with both red and white wines(with white I use apples to soak up the flavors). Both types have been devoured. I never use the optional sugar or club soda, but sometimes I use pink lemonade instead of regular and it tastes just as good (It dilutes the color of the white wine though). YUMMMY!!

I made this in a double batch, using a liter of Montepulciano D'Abruzzo, which I know is Italian,not Spainish, but what the heck. I used peach schnapps instead of triple sec, and instead of the traditional citrus, which makes it bitter if you leave it in too long, I drained a can of Dole tropical fruit, pureed it, then added it to the sangria, I also added about half of the juice. I sweetened with about 2 T sugar, and 1/4 c maraschino cherry juice, since the cherries just sink to the bottom anyway. I added the club soda to the glasses as we drank it...AWESOME!!

I loved this sangria!  It was my first time & I thought it tasted as good as any restaurant's.  I followed the recipe closely except for the following:  I used a sweet red wine & so I didn't use any additional sugar, I added pears to the fruits & I didn't use the cherries.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Delicious and Strong!! I used a wine "cube" of Cabernet/Shiraz. A friend of mine said a restaurant she used to work for used cabernet and it worked out great! I followed the recipe fairly accurately except I didn't have any o.j. so I left it out and I only added a teaspoon of sugar per batch. I didn't want it too sweet... Also as the carbonated water was optional, I had sprite out as a mixer and people could add however much they wanted for the desired strength. Everyone loved it. I suggest making a double batch:)

Oh my flippin' heck!  This is awesome.  I never thought I liked Sangria...but then a friend made some that changed my mind. I don't have her recipe so I tried this one.    My hubby doesn't like red wine and loves this too! I didn't have lemonade when I first made it - used lemon juice.  Also, I had orange and grapefruit juice to use up - yum.  Could really play with the fruit juice.  And I like this sagria both with and without the soda water (or ginger ale).  Enjoy!

Exquisite recipe! I skipped on sugar, triple sec, but added a pear, apple, mango/peach margarita mix, and gingerale. “Cooked” in the fridge over for about 18 hrs. Will be making it again for the next gathering.

I made about 30 servings of this recipe for a tapas party and it was long gone early in the night. Definitely a hit!

This is an excellent recipe. I used sprite instead because that's what I had on hand, everything else is as indicated in the original recipe. This will be my entertaining beverage from now on.

Fabulous. I only let it sit in the fridge for 5 hours and it was still wonderful. I added 1 cup ginger ale 1 cup club soda right before serving.

This is one of the most requested recipes I have ever made--I made it last spring for a luncheon and am still getting requests for the recipe.  Bravo!

This Sangria is awesome!  I didn't have any lemonaide concentrate so I used that same amount of lemon concentrate and added some sugar.  It's a huge hit everytime I serve it.  :)

I really enjoy making this recipe and my friends love drinking it. It seems like I never make enough. It is easy to improvise and add your own touches with this recipe. I make it a little differently every time and it always comes out great.

I made it for a party and everyone loved it (atleast that's what they said).  I didn't like the carbonation... thus 4 stars.  I didn't add the sugar.

A must for any BBQ!  This is the best Sangria!  I substituted the brandy for rum and used gingerale instead of the sugar and club soda.  I used a very inexpensive bottle of burgandy wine (as suggested by the liquor store employee).

Very good!  This reminded me of grapefruit juice which I found shocking considering the amount of alcohol it contained!  This is the only recipe I've ever attempted...

This was a great Sangria. I did use 7-UP instead of the carbonated water.  Everyone at the party really enjoyed.  Will definitely make it again!
