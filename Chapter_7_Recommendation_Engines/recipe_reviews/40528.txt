Tasted ok. Lots of prep, not enough taste-payoff for the required effort.

This was a very good salad!  My husband and I love Indian food and enjoyed this very much.  We will be making this again.

This was pretty good but WOW it was spicy. By the time I finished it my mouth was on fire and I had to drink two glasses of water, yikes!

Wonderful and filling. I used a sweeter balsamic vinegar (raspberry)  to add touch of sweet to go with the hot. I also cut the chicken first, tossed it in the sauce, and grilled the meat wrapped in foil.

This was great!  I sliced my breasts in half, thinner breasts are easier to bbq, they don't get dried out.  Also I marinaded them in this mixture for about an hour at room temperature.  Chicken was tender, and flavourful, will be a regular.  The salad was good aswell, but not crucial to the meal.

I didn't make the salad part, just the chicken.  I used creamy tandoori powder and added some sour cream as well to tone it down (never used tandoori before and thought it might be too spicy for the kids).  Then I baked at 350 for an hr or so and it turned out great!  Served it with some brown rice with cilantro and it was a good meal, even the kids gobbled it down.
