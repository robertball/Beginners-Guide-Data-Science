This has great potential but needs a lot more balsamic vinegar.  I think White Balsamic would be great in this and not give the salad thta muddy color.   The instructions on cooking the Isreali couscous are very different than the package instructions.  I tried it this way and after 25 minutes the liquid was not absorbed and the couscous wasn't tender.   Toast the couscous in a little olive oil - add the boiling water - cover and simmer on very low for 10 - 12 minutes until the water is absorbed.   I made this for the Western Region Allstar Faceless Frenzy July 2012.  With the changes mentioned above, I will definitely make this again.

I found this was a great side dish.  I didn't care for the shallot but that wasn't enough for me to mark it down.  Instead of dicing the mozzarella I just used the pearlini style -which is a fresh bite size mozzarella.  I think next time I'll leave out the balsamic and olive oil, and substitute some pesto

I got impatient and ate this at room temperature. It was great! I added extra basil, used red onion instead of a shallot, and omitted the garlic. I would definitely make it again :)

I made this salad and it was to die for!!  My dinner party loved it!  Only add the 1 clove of garlic - seems like it's too little but mixed with the onion made it perfect.  Also, I used 1 teaspoon of balsamic GLAZE and 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar instead.  Added a touch more fresh basil as well.  Was amazing!!!  Serve room temp otherwise will loose flavor when too cold.  Excellent!  Will definitely make again!!
**UPDATE NOTE** make this salad right before you are eating it-- room temp - does not hold well in fridge -- couscous sucks up the olive oil and gets very mushy** only good on first day!!

WE love this dish, It had great flavor. I suggest that you make this a few hours before serving so the flavors develop. Follow the recipe.
I paired it with Cod with Italian Crumb Topping and French cut green beans with real bacon bits. This was a very nice meal enjoyed very much. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

This was a simple and easy dish.  Great on a hot summer night.  Quick to make and delicious.  I added a lot more basil and added the couscous when it was still just a bit warm, so it really soaked up the flavors and wilted the basil a bit, but still had a nice bite to it.  I'll definitely be making it again.

This was really good but I didn't care for it cold. Next time I will marinate the tomatoes and cheese at room temperature and add them to the couscous when it's still warm. The pepper was too overpowering for me, next time I would at least quarter the amount.

Very easy dish. Can be a little more generous with the balsamic. Definitely make again.

I adore this recipe. I've made it with regular couscous and also with orzo. I think the Israeli couscous or orzo options are best. It's super simple & so tasty, especially in summer with garden tomatoes & basil. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

The caprese was good until I added the couscous then it became bland.  I tried adding more vinegar then it overpowered. I may give up on this one

Made it, love it! Has a nice flavor and it's fairly healthy to boot. I also suggest making it a couple hrs in advance so the flavors have to time to absorb into the couscous.Will definitely make again.

...this was wonderful...the only thing I did different...I used Trader Joe's Harvest Grains, instead of just plain couscous.
