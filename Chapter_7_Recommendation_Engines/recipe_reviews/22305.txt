This recipe is super!  However, instead of making a spread, I used this to make artichoke dip for tortilla chips and Italian bread.  In doing so, I skipped the food processor and coarse chopped the artichoke hearts by hand and used a garlic press for the garlic...it was fairly simple...took a whole 5 minutes extra.  Then I mixed the ingredients together right in the baking dish.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts since the recipe did not specify and it turned out great.  I did change the oven temperature to 350 and baked for 20 minutes because I wanted a slower cooking to help the flavors mingle together.  It turned out very flavorful and creamy...not greasy at all.  Great recipe!  P.S. I used FRESH grated parmesan cheese...not the salt licks in a green can!

I receive compliments and a clean dish every time I make this recipe.  The good news is, you don't need a blender or food processor to make this recipe.  I used a hand-held electric mixer to blend the ingredients together, except for the artichoke hearts.  Then I chopped the artichoke hearts and used a spoon to mix them into the other ingredients.  Quick, delicious and easy.

This is so delicious and I have not even heated it up yet!  I made this for New Year's Eve tonight, and I'm sure it will be a great addition to our appetizer table.  It was also very easy to make in my food processor.  I can't stop eating it!

When I'm having company and want an alternative to nacho cheese dip, this is the recipe I turn to.  I've made it several times, and it turns out perfect.  
I don't have a food processor, so I just chop the ingredients, it gives it a little more texture.  I'm also a artichoke-spinach fan, so I always add a thawed package of frozen, chopped spinach (or about 2 cups fresh, blanched in boiling water and then drained and chopped).  It's great served with tortilla chips and "crusty" breads.

This is a really great dish! I took it to a friend's barbeque where it was a huge success.  I recommend doubling or tripling it! I did not process the ingredient and instead coarsly chopped the artickokes and mixed all together by hand.  This made for bites with bits and pieces of artichoke.  Yummy!  For a spicy variation, try adding a chopped jalapeno or two.

This was so delicious! I only used half the artichokes and I chopped them instead of processing them. 14 oz of artichokes just seemed like it would be too much. I had only recently tried artichoke dip for the first time at a restaurant.  It was so good there, that I tried to find a recipe that came close, and this one does! The cream cheese and the parmesan really make it creamy and delicious!  And it got rave reviews from family and friends.  Served with warm herb bread, it's to die for!  I have also made this using fat free cream cheese and mayo - you can hardly tell the difference!

This is a really quick and delicious dish.  Guests really enjoy it and it also travels well should you be a guest at someone elses party.  I did however chop the artichokes rather than processing them.  This resulted in bits and pieces of artichoke throughout.  Very Yummy!

We enjoyed this.  I used fat free cream cheese and mayo (I am sure the full fat ingredients would be even tastier).  I am not a big fan of dill, so I replaced it with oregano and I am happy I did.  If I were to make any changes to this recipe, I would only puree half the artichokes and chop the rest, and maybe top it with a little shredded cheese before baking.

At Panera I had their new turkey and artichoke panini.  It was so good I wanted to make it for dinner, this artichoke dip works perfectly as the sandwich spread! Yummy, thanks for the recipe!

Used non-fat cream cheese, replaced mayo with non-fat Greek yogurt = guilt-free deliciousness.

Incredibly Delicous and wonderful appetizer!  I've made a couple of times and everyone has loved it.  I grate the parmesan cheese myself which is wonderful!  I don't have a food processor, so I just cut up and mix by hand and again, is fabulous.    We usually service with tortilla chips and baby carrots.  This is my new go to appetizer for guests and parties!

I made this exactly as is, except I used lite mayo and reheated in the microwave the next day. It was very rich and creamy. Completely unaware of who made the dip, I had 4 different people at a work party exclaim that they had to know who made this dip. I proudly told them it was me, but humbly thanked allrecipes for the recipe. It does reheat well, but I had to mix it often to distribute the heat because it's so thick. It makes an awful lot of dip, so use it for a party of at least 8 people.

I make this for about 80% of the parties we have and it is always a major hit.  I actually bake it in a Pampered Chef pie stone for about 40-45 minutes to make sure it's browned on top.  Highly recommend!

I've made this a few times now and it always is a huge hit. I always make it with low fat cream cheese and low fat mayo which makes it an even healthier option and when used as a dip it's a GREAT incentive to eat your veggies, since it pairs so well with zucchini and cauliflower. I usually serve it with a platter of sturdy veg, and pita chips & toasted baguette slices. If you have any leftover the next day just a few tablespoons makes for a healthy, special lunch too!

This was a hit for a family dinner for a appetizer.  I followed the recipe using neufchantel cheese and 1/2 cup parm and 1/2 cup 2% mozzerella.  Otherwise.. delicious!!!

After I made a couple changes (only out of personal preference) this was great! My husband and I decided to forgo the food processor and use a hand mixer instead. We added all ingredients (excepted artichokes) and whipped them together, adding a little milk for creaminess. Then we simply chopped the artichokes and beat them in! We served them with a tray of Club crackers and everyone raved!

Very tasty - I think it needed spinach though, and although I will definitely make this again, I'll also probably chop versus food process the artichokes.

This is a great alternative to other greasy dip recipes. Love it! The dills makes the recipe; gives it that extra something. Nice fluffy texture as well. I eat it with Stacy's brand pita chips.

I made this recipe because it seemed very similar to that which a local caterer makes. The good news is that that taste was right on! The bad news is that it contained an oil slick that looked like butter. I'm curious that I made it by the book but that nobody else seems to have had an excessive oil content. Any ideas what went wrong? Looked terrible but tasted great!

This is my favorite recipe to make for a party.  It is so easy.  You just throw it all in the food processor and then bake it.  I leave out the dill just because I never have any.  All my friends love it.

I made this exactly as written except that I didn't puree the ingredients.  I chopped them instead.  I found this to be pretty bland, but my sister (who admittedly prefers bland food) really enjoyed this.  I might make this again with the addition of a quarter cup of jalapenos to see how that works out.  Thanks for the recipe, Sarah.

I doubled the recipe for a party of nine people and it was almost all gone.  I served it with corn scoop chips.  It was yummy and I had requests for the recipe.  This is one that I will make again and again!  Fabulous!

Great dip.  I made a few changes due to lack of ingredients on hand.  I used half parmesan half mozzarella and sprinkled with a little Tony Chachere's (New Orleanians know what this is).  I kept it hot in a mini crock pot and we dipped with tortilla chips.  More people asked for a copy of the recipe than I've had in a long time.  Excellent!

My guests had never had artichoke dip before (me neither). They were a bit skeptical at first but they licked the bowl clean! I used less parmesan, espelette pepper instead of dill and mixed everything with a fork instead of turning the food processor on. This appetiser did better than my usual onion dip which is always the star of the party! Thanks for posting!

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer from a friend's recipe.  I don't own a food processor, so I used the blender.  It worked, but took a very long time.  I served with baked garlic & herb pita chips and it was excellent!

This wasn't that great.  I initally followed the recipe on the dot and ended up with mayo goo and all the artichoke disappeared.  I ended up adding triple the artichoke (chopped, not processed) and it was still gooey.  Won't make it again.

This was good, but not the best.  My guests enjoyed it very much.  I added a touch of lemon and I bet this dish would be outstanding with crabmeat.  Best served with tortilla chips or melba-like crackers.

This was awesome.  I used a mixer for all the ingredients except the artichoke which I chopped.  I also substituted low fat sour cream for the mayonnaise.  Instead of baking I put in a small crockpot and put on low.  It was ready in about 1 1/2 hours and was warm for the rest of the night.

Very tasty dip, but just a bit much dill. Next time I make it I think I will use just a dash of dill weed.

I made this for a dinner party the other night, with a yogurt-sized container of light sour cream instead of mayo.  I also used light cream cheese.  It was a hit!!  I got the most compliments on this.  It suited all tastes.

Made this for appetizers for a party and got rave reviews. Added more garlic.  Didn't have a food processor,used the blender.  Awfully thick for my poor blender.  Still turned out great.

Excellent!  The dill adds to the dip versus the normal garlic/artichoke dip taste.  In lieu of the garlic, I used Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic.  I also did not use the food processer based upon the recommendation of other cooks.  I served it with Nonni's Garlic Parmesan Panetinis.  Everyone loved it!  I will make it again!

This is an awesome dish! I made it for a friends party and because she doesn't like spinach artichoke dip but likes artichokes. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great! I didn't have a food processor so I diced the artichokes up pretty small and then mixed everything together with an electric mixer and it worked out just fine. I did add extra parmesan on top. It got rave reviews and a few thought this would be really good on mushrooms. So thanks so much for sharing this recipe and giving me a great party recipe!

I made it without the dill weed, but it still tasted amazing!  (I did take the picture after eating some of it, the top was a little bit of a darker shade, but only a tiny bit.)

This calls for way too much Parmesan cheese, resulting in a very salty taste.  I've made a lot of hot artichoke dips but this one is awful.

I had no idea what to make at the last minute.  Luckily, I had all the ingredients on hand.  Have to say, not many ingredients needed for this recipe.  Awesome!  What a great recipe!  It was great!  Will use this recipe time and time again.  It's a great Go-to recipe.  Thanks!

I love this!  I found this recipe many years ago and have made it several times.  It's always a hit.  I've always followed the directions to a "T" except that I heated the processed ingredients in a pan on the stovetop.  I would then put the dip in a fondue type bowl with a tea light underneath to keep the dip warm and creamy.  (Although it tastes fine at room temp, too).  Serve with water crackers.

Easy, easy, easy.  I make this recipe on a regular basis.  Usually always have the ingredients in the house.
