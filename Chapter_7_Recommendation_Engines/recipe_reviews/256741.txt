You can throw this together rather quickly! Love the layers of different cheeses on top. Great flavors! I added extra wing sauce and could probably add more just for my preference. Would be great to take to a gathering!

Ah May Ziiinnnnggggg! Got to love it when my flavorite, favorite Superbowl snacks collide into a single bowl.  Seriously, I ama big fan of the Buffalo Chicken flavor, but eating wings is a huge mess for my hands (and face). This dish is great because it's not nearly as messy but still has all of those great flavors that pair perfectly with a cold bottle of beer.

Super easy and super delicious! Using rotisserie chicken is genius. It's a great way to make a buffalo chicken "dip". I made this in an individual casserole serving -- and used pinto beans instead of black beans. A hit!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very easy to make using a rotisserie chicken.  Very tasty to.  It is also very versatile as you can add any toppings you want.  Made a very good "Friday Fun Food" dinner.  Would be great for Super Bowl.

This was such a tasty twist on typical nachos!  I loved the blue cheese on it.   The only thing I would do differently is add more buffalo sauce and a little more cheddar cheese.
