Great recipe, not only because it's delicious and nutricious but because it combines two of my favorite things - fruit and yogurt. I could live on the stuff! This is a great base to combine your favorite fruits or whatever fruits happen to be in season along with your favorite yogurt. I used red grapes and added in some banana. This made a ton of fruit salad - but since it's so hot and this is so refreshing that won't be a problem. I used fat-free vanilla yogurt and this made a great "go to" snack that was low in fat and calories. It was great spinkled with a little wheat germ on top!

I cut this recipe in half. I didn't have any pineapple so I omitted it. I also used halved green grapes. We loved this salad. Very simple and refreshing on such a hot day. It was SO wonderful--I think fresh fruit and vanilla yogurt has to be one of the best food combinations ever thought up. NO leftovers.

Mmmm Yummy. Really what's not to love here? Fresh fruit and yogurt. Fantastic. I got the best produce (lucky me) on sale (luckier me)! So I had to make this recipe. We couldn't stop eating it. Breakfast, snack, dessert all rolled into one recipe. Thanks!

Easy and tasty recipe! I made this as a side dish for a brunch casserole. I used a mix of kiwi, strawberry, bananas, blueberries and clementines.

Instead of vanilla yogurt I tried strawberry yogurt. I liked it that way much, much better and so did my family.  Recipie is a keeper!

Healthy, delicious, refreshing and it doesn't get much easier! For a one-bowl lunch, I went with what I had on hand. I cut-up strawberries and black grapes and also added blueberries and raspberries. Any combo of fruits would work. Topped with a good amount of vanilla Greek yogurt and then some fruit and nut granola. The granola added a nice flavor and crunch. This is would be good anytime....for a snack or light lunch. I'll surely make this again! Leslie, thanks for the great recipe!

Gave it 4 stars because it was time consuming and almost an overload of fruit.   I tried this but will stick with my original from 20 yrs ago...vanilla yogurt, coconut (unsweetened is fine since the yogurt and fruit gives this enough sweetness), canned drained mandarin oranges,  a diced apple,  and halved grapes.   Nothing is measured, you decide how much of each you want, depending on how much you make, too.  I've even added ground flax to make it healthier.   However you make a yogurt fruit salad it is always refreshing!  Great summer breakfast or evening snack :)
