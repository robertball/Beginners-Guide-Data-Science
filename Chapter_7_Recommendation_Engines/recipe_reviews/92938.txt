Easier and tastier than pumpkin pie!! I always use only 3/4 cups of 1/2 & 1/2  for the 1 cup of milk.  Otherwise it does not set up as well.  1/2 & 1/2 makes it richer and silkier. You can also make your own graham cracker crust and add toasted chopped pecans into the graham cracker mix before pressing it into the pan and baking it..Fabulous!

Pretty dessert but proportions for cream cheese layer make too much and the pumpkin pie spice had a very heavy clove taste. If I use this recipe again I will just use cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg instead of the pumpkin pie spice.

This recipe has been a Thanksgiving tradition in my family for years now.  My husband jokes that he knew he was going to marry me the first time he tasted my pumpkin pie. :)  The cool whip and jello make it lighter and creamier than regular pumpkin pie.  It's especially a hit with picky children!

This tastes just like Pumpkin Pie.  My family *demands* that I bring this pie to ALL our holiday dinners.  You can make it lower in fat/sugar by using a low fat crust, sugar free pudding, artifical sweetner, low fat cream cheese and cool whip.  Delicious!

This pie is absolutely delicious! I tried this out for Thanksgiving two years ago and ever since my family will not eat regular pumpkin pie, or any other pie for that matter! It's super easy to make and a major crowd pleaser

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have taken it to Thanksgiving dinners, potlucks and family gatherings and it is always a HIT! I have tried the low fat version of all the ingredients and it is still a great desert.

I love this recipe and make it almost every holiday for the past 5 yrs. My husband hates pumpkin pie, but will only eat it like this. A few changes I made to make sure the top layer doesn't sink into the bottom: 1. I use the whole 6oz block of cream cheese and I also add an extra 2 TBSP of sugar to it. Since this recipe tends to make more, I use the larger Keebler Elf 2 extra serving graham cracker crust (then I don't run into the problem of having too much). After putting in the bottom layer, I chill it for about 10 mins or less so it thickens. While it chills I start on the top layer.  Just spoon in a little bit of the pumpkin pie on top of the bottom layer, a little at a time. Be gentle so the two layers will stay. Don't worry if your not successful in making the pretty layers the first time, you will get the hang of it and will be able to tweak it and the recipe in the future to make it work!! Also, in lieu of 2 TBSP of pumkin pie spice, I just use 1 1/2 TBSP of it and 1/2 Tsp of cinnamon because for some reason I think I can taste too much ginger in my pumpkin pie spice. I may just be crazy! When cutting it, I wipe the blade of the knife each time I make a slice. The first piece is always a doozy getting out, but no worries, it all goes down the same!! Since making this pie at least once a month (5-8 during the holidays) I have never went back to traditional pumpkin pie in at least 5 yrs. You will not be disapointed!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was amazing.  I did not use the pumpkin pie spice mix; rather, I used cinnamon, ginger and clove separately.  I am not a fan of the traditional pumpkin pie (texture thing) -  this substitute verstion is one that my whole family endorses!

This pie is amazing and very easy to make. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cream cheese I don't know if it made a difference but it was good. I made it for a fall baby shower and 3 women were going to share one piece they ended up wanting 2 more pieces. Everyone liked it. It is creamy and has the right amount of spices. I am already getting requests that I need to make it for Thanksgiving.

If you like pumpkin, you'll love this recipe.  Very simple, tasty, and VERY creamy!  I like the subtle taste of cream cheese but I think next time I'll add a tad bit more for extra flavor.  Other than that, it's great!

I have made this numerous times over the years, and like a lot of others here, I have the worst time getting the layers to stay apart.  A few years ago I gave up trying.  Now when I make this I just mix EVERYTHING (except the graham crackers) together.  My kids call it "Pumpkin Smoosh"  and it's one of their favorite holiday treats.

I am not a big Pumkin Pie fan but this was delicious. Also, much easier than the traditional version. My 13 year old daughter made this and she's not very patient in the kitchen so it didn't look as pretty as the picture, but after tasting it she decided when making the pie next time she'd try to do it justice and make it look nicer. :)

Amazing dish! I love this pie! But I found that the recipe makes way too much for one pie filling. I can easily make 2 pies with the same ingredient amounts.

I had the opposite problem of the other reviewer, there wasn't enough of the cream cheese layer.  I also didn't like the pumpkin pie spice and would use different spices.

The flavor of pumpkin is lost in this pie. It tasted far too much like vanilla pudding. Plus, my filling was not solid enough, it fell apart when cut even after hours of refrigeration. A big disappointment.

LOVE THIS PIE! I've been making it for at least 13 years now! So here it is the middle of July and my son want's me to make it for his 7 birthday tomorrow! Thats how good it is! It should be a nice treat on a hot 90deg summer day,instead of a 40 deg fall day when I usually make it in November!

My husband is a firefighter, I tried this recipe about 3 years ago.  Now, it is a requirement every year.  "Don't bring the pie don't get to eat!"  It is difficult to please them all but this is a winner.  Way better than regular pie!

I've been making this pie for at least 15 years.  My family insists that when we get together, I bring "the pies."  I realized that you can make 2-6" pies using the same recipe.  The pies seem to hold together better.

Oh Wow, this was so yummy! We used Splenda instead of sugar, fat-free whipped topping, skim milk, and Jell-O fat-free/sugar-free pudding mix. Also used neufchatel instead of cream cheese and this was so good, and for right around 200 calories a slice, I actually got to eat a whole piece!

This is my absolute favorite way to have pumpkin pie. You just can't go wrong with pumpkin and cream cheese in the same dessert. I've been making this for a few years now and it's just not Thanksgiving without it!

Since finding this recipe on a Keebler Graham crust, no other pie will do at the Holidays for my family. Requests now come in for a pie for EACH of my family members to eat all alone! As easy as this is and as wonderful as it tastes, make several and share with the neighbors, co-workers or friends as gifts.  They will be waiting in line fork in hand when the holidays roll around!! Happy eating!

This recipe sounded so good, but it didn't taste right at all!  Maybe if it was cooked, it would taste better.

This is a family favorite and I will keep making year after year. Very easy and fast to make for all those who don't normally make pies.

This is so delicious!  Easy to make and very popular when entertaining!  I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and everyone raved.  It is also so beautiful to serve with whipped cream on top.  Looks wonderful.  I will definitely make this again!
