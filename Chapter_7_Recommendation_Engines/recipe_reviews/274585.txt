Very simple recipe.  I made this for a toddler and used this recipe as a side dish to go with macaroni and cheese. I think adults will like this too. I will definitely make this again.

Oh wow this sounds terrific - I can already tell it's gonna be a winner - headed to Kroger to get some fresh string beans to make it.
