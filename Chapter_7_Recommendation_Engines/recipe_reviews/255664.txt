4.2.18  Had one zucchini in the fridge, so this was the perfect way to use it.  This makes a really good appetizer, and is quick-and-easy, too.  I used more than a dash of balsamic (liked that flavor in this), and added the basil to the zucchini (recipe doesnâ€™t specify).    Certainly would make this again.
