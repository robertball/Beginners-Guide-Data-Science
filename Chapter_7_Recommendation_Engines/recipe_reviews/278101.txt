My family likes the way this dish came out  . This year I'm thinking about adding this to my corn beef instead of the traditional cabbage wedges with carrots .

1.22.20  We really enjoyed this, and the first thing that came to mind was what a great side dish this would be to grilled white German brats.  Next time, I’ll cut back just a bit on both the amount of bacon and the red pepper flakes, but that’s simply personal taste.  Good stuff, thanks for sharing!

I'm not familiar with cooking cabbage or what I think of as German-esque food, just because I wasn't exposed to it growing up (we're a turnip green/mustard green family). My husband's family are of German descent and his family's staple diet was American German-based...including 100 ways to cook cabbage. His parents have passed I wanted to bring back some of his old comfort foods. Deciding to start with cabbage, I chose this recipe because, well, BACON. He really liked it. I have a hard time rating it personally because I'm not quite to the point of liking the taste of cabbage. I added red pepper flakes to bump up the flavor. I cooked the cabbage in the bacon grease and in the future will probably decrease the amount because the cabbage tended to be a little greasy. Other than that, he was really happy with the dish and I'm happy to give him something that tastes like childhood.
