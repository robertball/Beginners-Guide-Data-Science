I believe some people are confused as to what REAL Louisiana Pralines are, and that they are VERY different from Texas Pralines.  Louisiana Pralines (pronounced PRAWlines) ARE a bit gritty, where as Texas  Pralines are chewy caramel.  So before folks give low ratings, I think they should do their research on the authenticity of the food and these ARE Authentic LOUISIANA Pralines......Girl who lived in Louisiana!!

I used all buttermilk and all white sugar.  These were ok, but nothing like my moms.  I'm certainly not the best at candy making but this recipe was easy to follow.  Glad I gave it a shot.  Thanks

This was my first try with pralines. They worked brilliantly for me even with humid weather. The only thing I did differently was did not cool the mixture 10-15 minutes after adding the vanilla and baking soda. We stirred about 2 minutes and then added the pecans and it was already hardening as we were placing them on wax paper. The texture was perfect.

I chose to use this recipe in spite of the bad reviews because I didn't feel that making this sort of thing in the microwave would turn out the way I wanted. I made some alterations- the most major being that I used walnuts instead of pecans, I also had no buttermilk on hand, so I substituted half and half, and also had no confectioners sugar, so just used white sugar. The result was good-quality candied nuts. Thanks!

I used this recipe under ideal conditions and followed the directions precisely.  The result was a total failure.  The pralines were more like sugared pecans - grainy and gritty.

This turned out rock hard for some reason. I'm willing to try again though. It might have just been the cook. (my mother in law)

Just made these and followed the recipe exactly.  Easy but as with a previous reviewer they were dry within a minute of stirring in vanilla and soda, so much so that I ended up pouring the whole dry crumbling batch onto the lined pan and will probably use as a praline topping for ice cream.  Great flavor though.

There are a few problems with this recipe.  Do not use confectioners sugar.  The cornstarch turns it into a messy ball.  Instead use all white if you prefer a lighter color or half brown, half white if you like them darker.  Also, skip the soda if you do not like chalky pralines. If you skip the soda up the salt in the recipe to 1/4 teaspoon.  Secondly, cut the pecans back to one cup otherwise you will have candied nuts.  Don't forget to toast the pecans as this brings out their lovely flavor.
