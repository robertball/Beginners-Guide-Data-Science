I make a variation of this all the time, especially around the holidays.  I use a half cup butter also, half as much black pepper and a few Tbsp of beer (or near-beer for those who prefer no alcohol).  It is a huge hit and everyone wants the recipe.  For US cooks, use 1 cup grated sharp cheddar if you can't find the cold pack.

I love this kind of stuff but was unsure of my wife so I made half the recipe in case I had to eat all of it. My only change was substituting green onions for the red, using the whites and greens. It was very good and she enjoyed it also. I'll be making this again but adding some crab meat. Our local supermarket sells their own crab/cheese spread that tastes so much like this spread as the base.

I personally didn't enjoy this too much. I love Worcestershire sauce in my meats  and never thought to put it in a dip. It was too overpowering for me, so maybe try less. Tasted a bit like barbecue in a way.

I have made several changes to this recipe  for a spicier flavor.  I use the basic cheese ingredients and to it add: onion powder, cayenne pepper, worcestershire sauce, 1/4 c butter, 2-3 T beer,  a dash of hot sauce and 3T of smoked paprika.  It keeps well in the frig and also freezes well

bf said this was an easy 4* recipe.. we enjoyed this with a few modifications.. i used tofutti cream cheese (lactose intolerant), a mexican blend for the sharp cheddar, onion powder for the red onion as i was out, and subbed chili powder for the pepper and paprika.. we were looking for something to stuff jalapenos with to make poppers.. we had a little leftover and had this on crackers.. i preferred this on crackers.. bf said he liked both.. ty for the recipe
