Less bowls/steps = I sliced the apples very thin, and put them in a medium skillet with the raisins with a quarter stick of butter to cook them a bit. It plumps the raisins and makes the apples more tender.  Then I drained the apple/raisins in a strainer over the baking dish, which greased it nicely, paper-toweling off the excess.
Added the warm apple/raisins tothe bread in a bowl, stirred well and dumped into the dish.  Then, in the same skillet I poured the milk, brown sugar, butter, vanilla (I used a whole teaspoon) eggs, and I added apple pie spice (could use pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, allspice, any of those) to the cinnamon, and just stirred it all together over medium low heat until the butter melts as directed and pour it over the bread mix in the dish and voila! I baked it nice and long, til it was 'set' and deep golden brown on top.  Wonderful wonderful stuff.  If I had had some wine or brandy to soak the raisins in.. I would have.  YUM.

Way too sweet. And I didn't even use the sauce part of the recipe. I will probably try it again, and add just 1/2 - 2/3 cup of brown sugar.

They were wonderful! I made them in muffin tins instead and it turned out beautifully! I didn't like the sauce though, it separated so I ended up just putting a little on top of each muffin when they were about 1/2 baked then finished baking them. I loved them and would reccomend the recipie to anyone!

the pudding was rather wet and watery though i baked it for more than an hour. it's pretty nice, but i think the ingredients should go straight into the greased dish instead of the bowl, in that way you can arrange it in such a way that the apples, bread and raisins go everywhere. also, i added a crumble of butter, flour and sugar on the top, and that was fabulous.

This recipe is delicious and oh, so easy.  As soon as it came out of the oven, my husband and I started eating it...couldn't wait for the sauce.  Maybe, I will make it, maybe I won't.  We are going to have it with ice cream on top or maybe Cool Whip.  I will make this often, I'm sure!

YUM!!!!!!!!!
I used 1C raisins and I put the sauce on before the pudding finished baking. It tastes delicious....but would probably 1/2 the sauce if I poured it over the top again.
I will definately be making this again and passing it on to everyone I know!

Every time I ask my husband what he wants for dessert, he tells me this recipe.  It's wonderful!!  I like it with whole wheat bread, and I skip the butter sauce (vanilla ice cream is much better).  When I make it for company I'm always asked for the recipe.  YUM!!

I read the reviews and made some changes.  I used 4 eggs instead of 2 (based on the reviews that it was watery), and I added 1 tbls of flour to the egg mixture.  I let the milk/brownsugar/butter combo cool on the stove, and added the egg mixture directly to that and poured it over the bread & apples all at once.   Then I baked it in a water bath, which helped it cook a lot quicker and more evenly.   With those changes, the recipe came out amazing, my hubby loved it.

I scoured the reviews and here's what I came up with: I needed to use a 9X13 to feed 13 people, so I doubled it, mostly, but kept the brown sugar at 1 cup. I also omitted the raisins. I used about 9-10 cups of whole wheat sandwich bread. I only had two apples, which yielded 2.5 cups, diced. I sauteed them in butter for a few minutes. Then I heated all together: 3 cups 1% milk, 1/2 cup half-and-half, 1 cup brown sugar, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, 2/3 cup salted butter, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 4 eggs. 
I sprayed the pan w/ Pam, poured the bread in the pan, mixed the apples in evenly, then poured the warm milk mixture over it all and made sure all the bread was really wet. I baked it at 325 for an hour and it was perfect.  If my family all liked nuts I would definitely put chopped walnuts in here. 
 Here's the clincher, though: I made an easy caramel sauce (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Salted-Caramel-Sauce/Detail.aspx?prop24=RD_RelatedRecipes) and poured it on top of the bread pudding while it was still warm, but not hot. It was amazing. The sauce was sweet and the BP wasn't super-sweet, which was nice!  Served it with homemade whipped cream. Even people who had no interest in bread pudding were having seconds. Next time I want to make it with chocolate chips and sliced bananas, omitting the cinnamon and allspice...  Good basic recipe!  UPDATE: made this 3x's in one week. Challah makes a world of difference! ALso, be sure not to 'cook' the milk/egg mixture, just warm it!

This recipe is wonderful - delicious!  The only changes I made were to sauteed the apples and raisins in the butter before adding them to the dish and I cooked it for about 5-10 minutes longer.

This was described as "heavenly" and made people forget all about Thanksgiving pies. So delicious. We took the advice in reviews and used a water bath, which made it soft, creamy, and perfect. Added a shot of brandy and some pecans to the sauce. Oh yeah, and my boyfriend used half-and-half instead of milk! Did I mention it's really good?

I'll admit, this was my first attempt at making a bread pudding, but I have eaten a ton if them in my lifetime, so I knew what I was looking for.  If I could give this 10 stars I would!  It was SO GOOD and SO EASY.  I made it in a mad rush last night to use up some leftover bread before a few friends came over, and the only things I changed were the following out of necessity: I used one apple and upped the raisins a bit to make up for it, I upped the vanilla to a whole teaspoon because I was reading the recipe fast, and I didn't have time to make the sauce.  I stuck it in the fridge for about an hour before I baked it to give it time to soak up the mixture, and I could not BELIEVE how heavenly this turned out for such a quick and easy bread pudding requiring items that are almost always in your kitchen anyway.  MAKE THIS TONIGHT!

Wonderful recipe....the use of a water bath is greatly helpful, by the way.

For the vanilla sauce, there is a quick, quick method I can suggest. (This was a trick done by the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco): Buy the best quality vanilla ice cream (made with vanilla bean), and allow the desired amount to melt at room temp. It makes an excellent sauce!

This was a very good pudding! The only thing that I would recommend doing is to cook it longer, so you get rid of the sogginess. This was my first time making it, but we did enjoy it. The sauce that goes over the pudding is sweet, and excellent.

I don't generally like bread pudding. I certainly have never made bread pudding. I was curious and made this on a whim. I will never be the same... this was amazing... the most tasty dessert I have ever had. I was so proud of myself. Ha! Thank you for submitting, you've made me a bread pudding fan!

w/o the sauce this recipe is the best i've tried so far.  the sauce was no different from the other reviews: watery and separated.  next time i'll make caramel sauce or serve it w/cream or vanilla ice cream.  i made changes to the bread pudding that i recommend: diced apples and using 3 cups instead of 2; more raisins; half the butter (the end result was still quite rich); double the vanilla. dicing the apples enables them to cook much faster and eliminates the need to use a knife when taking a bite.  next time i may use challah bread and add dried cranberries or prunes. it's easy to improvise on this recipe to make it healthier and tastier.  i can't wait to make it again. thanks for sharing!

I just wanted to use a little leftover French bread (enough for 2 servings of bread pudding) and was feeling somewhat lethargic.  I didn’t even have the proper baking apples.  So, I threw everything in a bowl (didn’t want to deal with extra dirty dishes), adding the bread and apples in after I had mixed the other ingredients very well.  I had buttered two ramekins and spooned in the mixture and popped into the oven.  I didn’t bother to make the sauce (too lazy); I just used vanilla ice cream.  So, despite my unenthusiastic efforts, the dessert was excellent.  Can you imagine how incredible it would have been if I actually put some energy into it?

Thank You Meshel! This is a great dish. I didn't follow the recipe exactly because after I cubed up the two French loaves I had, there was a lot more than 4 cups of bread. So I had to improvise, I used three apples and added extra raisins. I doubled the spices and vanilla, and sauted the friut in butter before adding. I used 1 1/2 cups of egg substitute, and because DH is lactose intolerant I used the Very Vanilla Silk instead of milk. I had to add more Silk, and I added a can of FF evaporated milk for richness. I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer and I used a bigger pan, but WOW! I also made the sauce but added water instead of milk. We drizzled the sauce on top, then topped with whip cream. Yum-O! A definte keeper for this family! Thanks again!

Absolutely delish!!!! I did make one change though. I baked the sauce right in with the other ingredients. It tasted just as good as the first time I made it by the directions given. This is a new family favorite!

My 21 year old daughter (the pickiest eater in our family) absolutely loves bread pudding, so while I do make it relatively often (and usually use one of my "traditional family recipes"), I am always on the hunt for an "acceptable alternative to the norm" -- and THIS ONE IS IT! I followed the recipe exactly (except that I used salted butter wherever margarine was called for and a 9x9 inch baking dish). My daughter rated it a 22. Both of my sons (who have always teased their sister about her bread pudding "thing") took a second piece before they retreated to whereever it is that they go, and my husband (who can take or leave bread pudding, depending on the day) specifically asked me to pack a LARGE piece with his lunch. Needless to say, I'm ALMOST at the point where I'm willing to replace my "traditional" recipe with this one.

Amazing recipe!  I cooked the thinly sliced apples and raisins before adding them to the bread.  I skipped the whole greasing of the pan and used the extra butter and grease from cooking the apples and raisins to coat the cooking pan.  I added a pinch of all spice to the cinnamon and cooked it for an 70 mins until it didn't slide around.  Instead of the topping, I did vanilla bean ice cream and it melted in the warm pudding bowl!  EXCELLENT!  And I must admit, it was my first time ever making bread pudding and now I won't make anything but this recipe!!

I am on a gluten and dairy-free diet so I had to adapt this recipe, but it still was a major hit with the neighbors. I used guten free white bread, and vanilla soy milk instead of cow's milk. I also used 1/2 cup of Blue Agave syrup instead of the brown sugar in pudding. I didn't have raisins so I used craisins plus a 1/3 cup of white chocolate chips. I also bumped up the vanilla extract to 1 tsp. The sauce also was changed to 1/4 cup agave syrup instead of white sugar and only 3 tablespoons of butter in place of the margarine. I threw in a shot  of bourbon to make it a hard sauce. It came out quite decadent, I must say. It was great served warm and even better the next day served cold with a warm hard sauce poured over.

I doubled everything except the brown sugar.  I added pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon. I left out the raisins and used a loaf or Pepridge farm cinnamon bread.  I always let the bread sit for 10 minutes to soak up the milk before putting it in the dish.  I used a 9x13 and it fit perfectly.  I always cook my bread pudding on 300 degrees, this one took 90 minutes.  The sauce seperated but still tasted good, just unactractive.  I'll find a different sauce for the next time.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I work full-time and this is a recipe that
can be easily put together and baked in the time that it takes for me to prepare
the main course.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to guests.  The only 
suggestion I would have is to be sure that the bread cubes are not packed to 
tight when measuring.  I had a tendency to fill my measure alittle to tight and 
the pudding was edging on too dry around the edges of the cooking dish.  Thank
you for sharing this delicious pudding recipe.

Delicious and great consistency.  As I normally do, I substituted splenda for the sugar and splenda blend for the brown sugar.  The sauce topping didn't turn out so good so I threw it out but the pudding didn't need it anyway.  Dollop of whipped cream and it was great.  Also, I sliced the apples in my first batch but found it better to chop them up in my second batch.  It more evenly dispursed the apples and the moisture from them.

I made this for a picnic in the park on this summer-like day with my sister.  She just kept mmming as she ate it and said it was fabulous.  I did add two more eggs and an additional 1/2 cup of milk as I do like a rich custard bread pudding and felt I could have added at least one more. I used organic Granny Smith apples as I thought the tartness would be a good counterpoint to the sweetness of the pudding and it was.

This bread pudding is WONDERFUL!! It is exactly like the Apple Bread Pudding from my favorite restaurant!  I just double the warm vanilla sauce and try not to eat the whole pan!  I have used homemade bread and it makes it even better, if thats possible.  Great recipe!

I remember my grandma making this recipe when I was little and I'm glad I found this one. It's perfect. My husband has never had it before and instantaneously loved it at first bite. I used one red and one green apple and couldn't tell much difference. I think the green apple gave it a twinge of tartness. I also used french bread like other reviewers suggested--gives it great texture. I didn't have ice cream tonight, so I made the sauce. I'd prefer the sauce to be thicker so next time I'll be sure to pick up some ice cream before making it again. Well, gotta go back for seconds...

oooh la la- so yummy. I was craving bread pudding-it had been years since I had it. 
Im not to keen on the vanilla sauce and may try and make it a thicker consistency but nevertheless this was a great dish. I may have used a bit more bread and you can even use more as it was still a little too moist. Cannot wait for some leftovers tonight, thanks so much.

I have made this twice and it has come out wonderful each time.  My boyfriend LOVES it.  It's best if you use cubes of an older Italian bread loaf. I'd never tried it before this recipe, but now doubt I'll ever use anything else.  It is a little custardy, due to the egg mixture, but that just makes it even better!

Very easy recipe to make.  I used raisin challah bread and added some walnuts.  I also substituted maple flavoring for the vanilla and added more cinnamon.  I didn't make the sauce.  If I wanted something extra I would get some vanilla ice cream or whipping cream but it was great without it. I halved the recipe and it fit in a 8 x 8 pan and cooked in 45 minutes.

Delicious! The kids asked for seconds -even the baby .... I only changed the method slightly trying to cut down on time and dishes. I simply microwaved the milk, sugar, butter mixture, then added it to the flavoured beaten eggs while constantly mixing. I then poured the wet ingredients over the dry and put it in the oven. It was ready to eat at about 35 minutes and finished five minutes after it was cool enough to eat. Thanks for the recipe!

Sooooo yummy! I made mine with cinnamon raisin bread made in my bread machine. Soaked raisins in red wine and slightly cooked the apples prior to mixing in so they wouldn't be as crisp. So rich and decadent!

A wonderful recipe! I pretty much followed the recipe for once and was happy with the results. The only change I will make  for next time: either pre cook the apples a bit or grate them. Also I cooked my Apple Bread Pudding in a bain marie with absolutely fabulous results! I didn't make the Vanilla Sauce though I might next time just to give it a try. I did serve with a choice of Vanilla Ice Cream or Pouring Custard. Husband says it was awesome with Custard.

This is way too sweet and has too much fat in it, especially if you make the vanilla sauce. Why not mix the eggs in with the milk mixture and pour that over the bread, raisins, and apple to avoid getting the "scrambled egg" bits in the dessert.  1 1/2 C sugar and 3/4 C butter in a recipe that serves 8 is TOO sweet and unhealthy to boot. I made the sauce because the dessert without the sauce looked dry.  I would not bother tinkering with this recipe.  I would just find a better one.

Oh my......this is the best recipe.  I used some left over Sweet Honey French Bread from this site because it was past it's sandwich life.  I also used two review ideas.  1. baking in the waterbath 2.  halving the vanilla sauce and pouring over the last 10 minutes of baking.  

It took more like 60 minutes to bake but WOW it was incredible.

This was a really good dessert-especially the sauce.  When I made it-I intended to use a springform pan-but found out too late that they are not water-tight. About half the liquid oozed out everywhere, but I forged ahead and baked it.  The (unintentional) decrease in the pudding mixture gave it more of a french toast taste.  But it was still great.

I love this recipe!  I've made it a few times, always to rave reviews.  Definitely use a nice, full bodied bread.  My only complaint is the sauce.  I think that I'm making it correctly, but it's pretty thin and separates easily.  After the first try I gave up and serve this with vanilla ice cream now instead (which everyone loves).  It's definitely a delicious keeper.

I liked it...but if you use a left over french-type bread, you will definitely need another 1 1/2 cups of milk & another egg as I did, because it's a bit dry.  Also, try about 1 to 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch in the sauce portion of this recipe because otherwise it's just runny.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of bourbon to this sauce - or you could add lemon juice - something to break up the sweetness.

Actually 4.5 stars.  This is a nice soft bread pudding but I like it a little firmer so I'll add another egg next time.  This has great flavor and IMHO doesn't need the sauce, which I ended up not making.  I plumped the raisins first and sautéed the apples in the butter as suggested by another reviewer.

This came out great - I had a TON of left over homemade challah bread and ended up throwing in a bit more (still have some left)and that seemed to take care of the undone problem that some reviewers have mentioned.  Other than that, it came out great - I did it just as the directions said.  And YES - it DID make my house smell AMAZING!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I just made this pudding and it is delicious.  The apples really set off the flavour.  Of course I doubled the vanilla but what was with the 1/2 cup of margarine in the sauce.  It all separated so I poured off the butter which floated to the top and the sauce was just fine after that.  Very good recipe.

I soaked the raisins in Calvados (apple brandy)  for 1/2 hour. Sauteed the apples in an extra 1/4 cup of butter.  When the apples were tender crisp I added the raisins and brandy just until heated, then added them to the bread as directed. Using the remaining liquid as part of the milk measurement, I then cooked the sugars, etc. and added to the bread.  The brandy added an extra dimension of richness. I will make this one agian!

I was looking for a bread pudding recipe that was easy to modify for a healthier version and this looked perfect because it was already lower in fat than other recipes without the sauce, which apparently most reviewers didn't even make because this recipe is already delicious without it. That long sentence was all to say that I made this, substituted half the brown sugar with splenda, use applesauce instead of margarine, used fat free milk added a splash of orange juice, and didn't make the sauce. I served it at a party and no even knew it was a low-fat dessert. Top with a dollop of fat free coolwhip for a special treat!

This was wonderful!  The only thing I did different was add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I did take some advice and put the bread, raisins and apples right into my (9x9) baking dish so I could spread them out nicely.  I put the apples primarily on top, but next time I will put them more on the bottom.  The sauce is excellent!  We also put a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, outstanding!

The best bread pudding recipe I've come across. The apples help keep it moist and add great texture.  Turns out well every time I make it - one of my go-to desserts.

Great recipe! I used chopped canned peaches instead of apples, dried cherries instead of raisins, only 3 cups of bread (whole wheat), butter not margarine, and fresh nutmeg. Didn't make the sauce, served it warm with fat free vanilla frozen yogurt. Moist and delicious with a nice little crunch on top.

I must of done something wrong. I couldn't decide if it was under cooked or if the consistancy was suppose to be like that (mushy soggy bread). The vanilla sauce was a buttery mess. I didn't even serve any to my family.

My husband and I made this yesterday & we both agree this is one of the yummiest things we've ever made! We used French bread from the grocery store bakery and once it was all put together we let it sit covered in the frige for about 30 minutes. The sauce adds extra deliciousness. Thanks so much for posting this awesome recipe!

Awesome! This was super easy and delicious. I had leftovers the next morning and then thought that the sauce was much too buttery & sweet. But the night before it didn't bother me that way. Maybe I'll try to find a Whiskey sauce to go on top...yum!

I was not impressed.  It tasted fine but looked bad.  I am not sure why you would add the milk and eggs separately because it ended up not combining and effected the final product.  The butter was never fully absorbed and the bread never got puffy like I would have liked it to.

OMG!!! Awesome bread pudding. I used a 12 oz. can of evap. skim milk and for the balance of milk I used Vanilla Nut Liquid Coffeemate. Next time I might use 1 more egg so it would cover the top a little more. Thanks for a great recipe.

Perfect! I followed directions exactly but added 2T brandy to the sauce.  Yum!  I wasn't sure how fine to slice the apples, so mine were quite chunky, and it was good.  I think it is a lot easier than I made it out to be! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The texture was wonderful--perfect comfort food consistency!  I did find the flavor a tad too sweet; next time I'll cut back a little on the brown sugar, and use more apples (and tart ones at that!).  We wanted to go easy on the calories, so we served the pudding with low-fat ice cream instead of the vanilla sauce--it made a terrific substitute.  NOTE:  A previous reviewer said that she had a problem with "scrambled eggs" in the pudding--if you wait until the milk/margarine/brown sugar mix has cooled before adding the egg mixture, you can avoid this problem.

OMG!  This was the best bread pudding.  I love the addition of the apples.  All I did was slice up more apples (because I love applies) and sauteed them in the butter to make sure they would be soft and yummy and then added the brown sugar to heat through.  I mixed the raisins with the egg mixture and poured the apple mixture over the bread.  It was absolutely delicious and will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Family LOVED it....However, I used a long bakery baguette bread...Cut brown sides & corners off and cut bread into cubes...The thickness of the bread helped soak juices and remained as thick bread shapes without being overly mushy & I only cooked with unsalted Butter....Excellent ??

This was wet, like soggy bread. I think it needs double the eggs and less milk. I left it in for over an hour, but it was still runny in the bottom.

Followed the directions, and had to bake it to death, consistency was watery, soggy bread. The only good thing was how it made the house smell. I'd use 1/2 the milk, add an egg, add more cinnamon and cook the apples and drain before adding.

LOVE this recipe! I have made it soooooooooo many times & every time it gets better! I add the cinnamon to the bread instead of the eggs because it doesn't mix well in liquid & I add apple pie spice too, then I mix everything in the bowl till everything is wet then pour it into the prepared pan & bake it as directed. 45 minutes later you have a little batch of heaven!

I just finished baking this apple bread pudding and it came out moist and delicous. I changed a few things, I put butter instead of margarine and used cranberries and walnuts instead of raisins. I also only had 12 grain sliced toast bread and I believe gave it a more rustic taste.
 
Read most of the reviews so I ended up adding less milk to only 1 cup and it was great. I will be making this one again and again with my changes.

i have been making this recipe for several years. absolutely love it. saw an emeril show just before i made it, he said to soak the bread in the custard mixture for about 20 minutes before baking which i did. works great, the only change i ever made was doubling the vanilla.....

SOOOOO GOOOOD!  I had some apples that were going bad and needed to find something to do with them.  I found this recipe and tweeked it a little bit but i'm sure it would be great without changes.  I didn't have enough 'soft' bread crumbs so i used some dry bread pieces from a variety of different wheat breads and because of that i increased the milk by about 1/2 a cup.  I also used Pumpkin Pie Spice and omitted the vanilla extract but only because i didn't have any.  My fiancee couldn't wait for it to finish cooking but after he took 1 bite he stopped playing his PS3 to tell me how good it was.  DELICIOUS and i will be making this again!!!

So delicious!!!  I increased this recipe a bit since I had extra bread to get rid of (added more bread, apples, +1 egg, and milk).  I didn't make the vanilla sauce... I don't think it needs it at all, even though I'm sure it would be good too.  I used Gala apples and baked in a 9x13 for about 40 minutes.  I had to eat some right out of the oven because it smelled so good!

Very satisfying! This recipe is easily halved, which is terrific if you're cooking for only two. 

I used an 8x8 inch square baking dish, followed the recipe exactly (except halving each item), and baked for 50 minutes at 350. 

The consistency was a perfect combination of creamy, firm, and just slightly toasty on top. Definitely a keeper!

Made this for a luncheon and for a large Thanksgiving buffet. I served it with a cider-caramel cream sauce and it was a HUGE hit! Spicy, sweet, satisfying and delicious!

I found our pudding to be a bit dry -not enough custard for fruit and bread. I threw in about a cup of fresh cranberries instead of the raisins.  Also topped with vanilla ice cream instead of sauce.  Dish was beautiful to look at, but lacking in a little flavor.

Delicious, even without the vanilla sauce. The second time I made it, I was craving it but only had a variety of leftovers on hand. I used leftover Apple Betty and leftover apple crumble, added some cubed focaccia and chopped pear, and then threw in raisins, dried cranberries & dates, and chopped walnuts. I dropped the sugar and spices down a bit to account for the already seasoned leftovers, but kept the milk, butter, eggs the same. YUM! I know my second effort sounds very different from the original recipe, but it just shows that this recipe is a great base and adapts wonderfully to additions and changes. Thank you!

10 STAR GOOD!  This is not a "diet" dessert so be warned but whatever calories you do consume will be SO worth it....TRUST ME!  The only changes I made to this recipe was the use of butter and 1/2 and 1/2 and I baked it in a water bath....as for the sauce some liked the "butter" vanilla combo and some thought it was to much....I poured the warm sauce over my pudding while it was still hot and it was FABU!  Oh YES!  I halved the recipe and added an extra egg as other's suggested.  My husband RAVED and said I can make this again and again.  THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this recipe.  It has been printed and will go into my private cookbook.

This was my first time making bread pudding and it was FABULOUS!  My family loved it!  The only thing I would do differently is reduce the sauce.  It was SO rich and I love it as it is but less sauce would probably mean less tummy ache right now :)

I used Kings Hawaiian sweet bread for this recipe, and it was great! If you buy the rolls, I found about 10 of them was sufficient. I was a bit worried about it being to sweet, so I used granny smith apples and it balances out nicely. I took another reviewers suggestion and sauteed the sliced apples and raisins in a little bit of butter before adding it to the bread. I also didn't make the sauce. I made it the night before a party and served it cold, it went over great!

Very good and easy to make.  I thought the pudding itself was nice, but with the sauce it is very yummy.  Makes LOTS of sauce, I didn't need to use all of it.  I also cut back on the sugar in both the pudding and sauce (not by a lot, but just a little).

Very yummy. I make two different bread puddings and I like to call this one my sweet recipe. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that it may be best to only make half of the vanilla sauce.

Super Easy to Make!  Made this for Christmas and it was a big hit.  Will make a bigger batch next time.  Only change is I would add more of the egg (custard) fill.

The flavor of the pudding is very good (I didn't make the sauce) but it's WAY too watery. My pan baked for over an hour and still wasn't set the way I thought it should be done. The dish was really easy to assemble, but I don't know if I'll mess with this again or not.

Excellent recipe - we've served it with vanilla ice cream, the vanilla sauce, maple syrup, and a bourbon sauce (instead of vanilla, add 2-3 Tbsp of good bourbon to this sauce) - and we can't decide which we like best!  One note:  I've used a full 2 cups of milk each time, which makes it very moist.

I SUBSTITUTED A 1/2 LOAF OF RAISIN BREAD CUT IN CUBES AND IT CAME OUT VERY MOIST.  I WILL DO IT AGAIN BUT USE ONLY 1/2 THE BRN SUGAR (TOO SWEET) AND A WHOLE LOAF OF RAISIN BREAD.  FAMILY REALLY LIKED IT.  SERVED WITH COOL WHIP (NOT SAUCE).  JOYCE

I followed the suggestions from others and used white grapes (they really are sweeter) that had been soaked in run for 1/2 hour.  The rum really added a perfect flavor in the bread pudding!  I also used Pink Lady apples which complimented the white raisins and rum.    After reading about the brown edges and discovering that I didn't have a good size dish to be able to put the bread pudding in a water bath, I decided to use ramekins.  I set the ramekins inside a large baking dish and filled it with enough water to cover half the side of the ramekins.  It still took about 40-50 minutes to bake all of them at once but they were absolutely delicious!    Thank you for a wonderful recipe that will now be one of my favorite comfort foods!

A very different dessert! I don't like food to be too sweet and this turned out just perfect in that regard. I think it could use another 1/2 cup of apples. My raisins got a good simmer in a little rum and water before getting tossed in. I've never made bread pudding before, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to turn out, but I'm pleased. It fit beautifully in a cake pan (9" across, 2" deep) and after reading up on bread puddings I placed that in a 9x13 pan full of water. It sets at about 45 min but the last few min are for browning which greatly improved the look of it (in my opinion).

This bread pudding was the first I've ever made - it is simple and delicious.  I sauteed diced apples, raisins and a cinnamon stick in butter for about 5 minutes and added that mixture to the cubed bread, which I poured directly in the pan.  I added extra nutmeg and allspice to the milk mixture and poured the liquid ingredients on top of the bread.  I only had to bake for 30 minutes, and it came out very well!!  My husband is eating his second serving right now, and my toddler cannot get enough :)

We were stuck in the house during another Michigan snow storm yesterday so I searched for something I had the ingredients for and this was it.  The house smelled INCREDIBLE while it was baking.  It was SUPER yummy.  Next time I'll add more spice.  A little grossly mushy on the bottom, but that didn't stop me from eating half of it!  Would def. make it again!

I used this recipe as a STARTING POINT for using up some 'getting stale' homemade banana oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.....  1. I used the cookies in place of the bread and added another 1/2 cup instant oatmeal......  2. I used the saucepan mixture as the recipe calls for...... 3. Added apples, cinnamon, and raisins......  4. The egg mixture was just mix right into the batter...... 5. I did not use the topping (yet) - doesn't need it - yummy right out of the pan!!!!..... Bet it will taste awesome warmed up with a little cream on it!

I used 5 cups of bread and only 2 tablespoons of butter and it came out great! Instead of the vanilla topping I used left over canned apple filling my Mom made. Everyone loved it and took it to work with them the next day!

Made the recipe as described, but next time, I'll cut down on my use of bowls and pans a little.  Didn't have a 7x11 baking dish, but used a 7x9 instead.  In my opinion, it turned out just as good.  The bread sitting in the pudding mixture turned out great, while the pudding soaked bread sitting above the mix in the  baking dish crisped up nicely to give the dish added texture when serving.  Speaking of which, we put a nice serving in a big coffee cup, put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, followed by the  warm vanilla sauce.  Holy smokes was this good, everybody had two servings until the dish was empty.  Definitely added to my recipe box.

This is truely a great recipe.  My wife is not a fan of bread puddings and so I usually don't make it.  However, we had been given some home made challah that was a little too 'dense'.  So, I thought is would be good for breadpudding.  It came out great.  We will certainly make it again.

I actually made it in 6 ramikins.  It baked for about 30 minutes and was the perfect consistency, firm, but not hard.  I didn't even bother with the vanilla sauce, it was sweet enough without it.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked the apples in the butter/brown sugar mixture.  I think it made sure the apples were cooked and flavorable.

Yummy!  Skip the vanilla sauce and have some vanilla ice cream instead.  I soaked my raisins in a little vanilla and rum to soften them up before I added them (drain them first or its yucky).  UPDATE:  made again with dried cranberries and also very delicious

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Have made it several times and the neighbors have also asked for the recipe.  I did cook  the vanilla sauce longer and it thickened up.  Delicious anyway it is served.

Mmmm...what a great and yummy dish on a chilly evening. I'm still in awe of how delicious it turned out...I can make great bread pudding! Wow! 

The apple was a great twist that didn't stand out too conspicuously, and was a great way to get rid of my extra apples. I like my bread pudding a tad thicker, so I added a bit more bread crumbs, but otherwise awesome. I would recommend skipping the sauce. I'll be making this lots more...anytime the snow starts flying.

This was a good twist on plain bread pudding. I made it ahead and let it sit in the frig to soak up the liquid. I also mixed the egg mixture in after the milk and then dumped it all into the pan. I forgot to make the sauce but I'm sure it makes it wonderful. I served it with carmel-vanilla icecream so probable didn't need the sauce anyway. Everyone liked it. Maybe could've used more cinnamon or applepie spice.  Made this for a second time.  Made the sauce this time it had too butter floating on top.  I think the recipe calls for too much butter.  Use 1/4 c. next time.

This recipe made me join the allrecipe website.  I do not like bread pudding (my husband does) and I used honey wheat bread, egg beaters, and organic ff milk - even with my changes this was the most delicious dessert!  Thank you for your recipe, and thanks for taking me from a "lurker" to an allrecipe member.

This was very good, albeit rich.  The butter/brown sugar drizzle makes it a bit over the top.  I think a small scoop of ice milk or lowfat vanilla ice cream is the way to go.  I also belive it is worthwhile to use a hearty bread like French or crusty sourdough for this; I used plain store bought white bread and it didn't stand up well when I poured the egg mixture over it.

It was definitely comfort food, and very popular. I saved a clean bowl by putting the ingredients directly into the greased baking dish (after mixing the wet ingredients). Instead of the sauce I served this with butter pecan ice cream which I think provided a nice touch of crunchy texture, and drizzled some amaretto liqueur which was a nice touch. Also I only baked this 40 min or else the egg would've been too tough. Next time I would 1) double the raisins and plump them in warm apple sauce, 2) mix it better but leave some slices of apple to lay on top before baking, and 3) added apple pie spice since I thought the flavor just a little bland.

Toaster oven bakers everywhere, it's a keeper!...thank goodness for a lot of reviews to help me make this for the first time a success!...used dried cranberries instead of raisins, french bread, used 3 cups of DICED apples instead of 2, baked in a 2.5 quart oval dish for 30-35 min in a large toaster oven but beware, the top crust is close to the heating element and I end up with some crunchy croutons on top. Didn't make vanilla sauce because i prefer caramel sauce (half cup of each: brown sugar, whipping cream/butter - bring to boil, boil for 5 min. without stirring, cool). Going to take advantage of apple harvests yearly for this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this with Rome apples and Granny Smith apples.  I couldn't really tell the difference once it was cooked, only that they were both delicious!  I did not make the vanilla sauce.  I also cut back a bit on the brown sugar based on several reviewers commenting on the sweetness.

Absolutely fabulous.  Sometimes I will vary just a tiny bit by using brandy rather than vanilla...but it isn't necessary...just a different taste occasionally.  I take this (by request...or demand?) to our church potluck dinners and never bring any home.  I have also found that the best way to cook this is in cast iron...never, ever the slightest bit soggy.  I have found the quantity of sauce is too much for our taste and normally go by feel rather than using all of it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy and incredibly delicious dessert. Bread pudding is my husband's favorite dessert and this one was my first attempt. I used icecream instead of the sauce and don't think I'll ever make the sauce based on how good the dish was w/out it.

Good recipe, however it's much better with these changes:
1) use 1/2 the butter in the pudding and sauce(still tastes great)
2) use 1/2 the sugar (was way too sweet before)
3) add 1 extra cup of bread or use less milk (this recipe is too runny)
4) I liked it with chopped walnuts rather than raisins
Thanks!

Wonderful fall recipe!  Thank you, Meshel! For a variation, try it with cranberries (dried or fresh) instead of raisins and add a little nutmeg! Try different breads, too - my favorite is sweet italian!  Delicious!!

I have a bread machine, so I have lots of crusts to get rid of. I tried this recipe, and boy, did I love it! I have made it a couple of times now (trying not to overkill too soon!) and will definately make it again. Instead of making the sauce in the recipe, I made vanilla custard using instant powder (Harry Horner's?). It was excellent - not too sweet, and so creamy!

Used cranberries instead of raisins and 3/4 cup of yogurt, 3/4 cup of milk, cut back on the sugar by half, as I used Challah bread. It was delicious. Making it again for New Year’s Eve.

I made this for my mother and she loved it. Instead of slicing the apples I diced them. Then after pouring the bread mixture on I let it set for ten or fifteen minutes to absorb the mixture. Then moved it  to  the prepared dish. Also instead of adding raisins I used five cups of raisin bread. Hope everyone enjoyss.

Not a fan of a margarine - used butter instead. Also, used a 2/3 c brown sugar- especially because  I made the sauce at the top. Finally, I like more raisins than the recipe called for, and added cardamom - 2 small pods, and only a tiny pinch of cinnamon . Great recipe for sure.

I have never made bread pudding but I love to eat it. This was simple, fast and used ingredients I had on hand. Loved it!  I used ciabatta and Italian bread that was a little stale- gave great texture.

I made this in a 8x8 glass dish. The final product looked pretty similar to pics posted by other reviewers.  Unfortunately, I found it tasted a bit like french toast which was not what I was after (would make an excellent breakfast dish though). It's not bad...I'm still eating it, its just not what I was wanting. 

I did not think it was too sweet with the full cup of sugar. I also did not have a problem with it getting done, being runny, or apples not being tender as others had.

Note: I followed the recipe as is, except I left out raisins and substituted butter for the margarine. I also chopped my apples to roughly the same size as the bread crumbs, rather than slice them.  Otherwise, I followed the exact steps.

At first the Vanilla Sauce is so sweet I didn't think I was going to like it but after the dessert cooled it was perfect.  I used a variety of breads including wheat bread and hot dog buns.  Cubed them small and they worked great.  Tasty recipe, loved the apples and raisins, will make again.

Delicious! My changes: I cubed and added the 3 overripe bananas on my counter, and this was a big hit. I also used 6c (6 slices) of whole wheat bread and some extra raisins instead of 4c white. I like the heaviness and extra texture, and so did the family. I used 3/4 c of white sugar since I was out of brown. The only criticism - too much liquid really caused the cooking time to be off. Even using 6 c of whole wheat bread, which absorbs a lot, this needed less liquid. I poured some off after 30 or 40 min of baking (quite the trick!) and baked it longer.  Next time I make it, I'll use less milk, probably about 1 to 1-1/4c. I also did not make the sauce, this was more than sweet enough, and was heavenly with some whipped cream and toasted pecans.  One thought - stale bread (ideal for bread pudding) absorbs a lot more liquid than fresh, and may be the reason many reviewers find the recipe too moist. I recommend trying the liquid quantity in the recipe if your bread is stale, but reducing if it's fresh. The result was still a keeper, my daughter has already requested the same recipe for thanksgiving desert!

I gave it 4 stars due to overly sweet turnout...

It's delicious, but WAY too sweet even after I lowered the initial brown sugar amount to 3/4 cup. I skipped the sauce and also used 4 eggs from reading other reviewers suggestions. Also, it turned out really wet/watery like reviewers said, should have listened to that.

In the future, I will:
-lower the initial amount of brown sugar since apples have sugar naturally too - you can easily make it more sweet later if needed
-use less milk - too watery

I simmed sweetend condensed milk until caramelized then thinned with 2% milk 3 cans scd milk 1 cup 2% it baked up beautiful and not too sweet.

I never had apples in bread pudding, and they work great here. I was afraid they'd be too hard, so I sauteed them for about 4 min in 1/4 c butter. When they cooled, I combined them with the bread cubes (some raisin cinnamon bread in there, too). Sprinkled with about 1/2 tsp salt. A while ago, I made another plain bread pudding from this site that came out excellent. I halved that recipe and did the same thing here; I still only used 1/4 cup + 2 tblsp of combined brown and turbinado sugar. (I agree with reviewers who said there was too much sugar....I get by fine with a lot less.) I do sprinkle the top with a little turbinado sugar. That gives it nice crunch and shine. I also combined half whole milk and half non-dairy creamer with beaten eggs, sugar, cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, a little nutmeg and pumpkin pie seasoning. I then poured that over the combined bread and apples in a small baking dish. Baked perfectly at 45-48 min. Just had some warm with whipped cream....yum!

We reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and did not make the sauce. Used a mix of several day old wheat and Italian bread. Still sweet, very nice after dinner treat. I did follow catjenkins recommendation to sauté the apples and raisins in a little butter first.

I found this bread pudding entirely too sweet (for my tastes) and too runny/soggy.  Since it was my first time using this recipe, I followed all the directions as written (skipping the vanilla sauce and making a cognac whipped cream instead) and was underwhelmed by the results.  The flavor was good and it made my place smell wonderful, but texturally this pudding missed the mark.  In hindsight, I should have used less liquid and brown sugar, poured the egg mixture into the milk/sugar mix before pouring it over the bread/raisins/apple, and maybe add one more egg to the recipe.  Adding the egg mixture separately resulted in little scrambled pieces in the finished product, rather than getting a custard-y texture from the bread. I think I'll just find another recipe for next time.  Bummer!

It was tasty! I didn't make the sauce because I didn't feel like making it at the time but I don't see why I'd bother making it in the future seeing as how good it tastes without it. Will go back to this recipe in the future!

Best bread pudding I ever had. I made it as written, except I added a little more cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice, as someone suggested. Next time I would either use cinnamon bread or add triple cinnamon. I would not bother with pumpkin pie spice next time. I did place a pan of water in the oven like I do for cheesecake. It helps to keep things good and moist. I did not make vanilla sauce because I had a very good vanilla ice cream on hand that I melted in the microwave and poured over top of the finished pudding. The pudding baked for 45 min. Everyone @ the church breakfast loved it!

LOVE IT!!!! 
Made a few changes.  Omitted raisins (daughter does not like)and used challah bread.  Followed some of CATJENKINS suggestions; sauteed the apples in some butter, added to the bread.  Melted butter in the pan in oven.  Then heated milk and brown sugar with remaining butter and cinnamon. I added that to the bread/apple mixture.  I beat the eggs with vanilla.  The bread mixture was put into prepared pan and I poured the egg mixture over it, and then blended it to avoid the scrambled egg that others discussed.
At 350* it took only 40 minutes for it to be set.  I did not make the sauce, instead made cinnamon whipped cream.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

I liked this very much. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and added some pecans. Delish! My husband doesn't like bread pudding much because he doesn't like "mushy bread." Because of some of the watery comments, I added another 1/2 cup of bread cubes and baked it in a 9X13 pan. DH said it was okay, but he only ate one serving and didn't want more. I think the apples baking in it made it a tad watery, but I still thought it was great.

Made this twice after I started saving the bread heels in my freezer.  It turns out great.  I have had a request for the recipe.

I made this just today. I too used 1/4 cup of margarine and cooked the apples and raisins to soften the apples and plump the raisins. It was wonderful. Just as I remembered my mother and grandmother making it. Brought back fond memories. Easy to make. My suggestion would be on the sauce. Cut back the margarine to 1/4 cup. That's plenty for this recipe. I will be making this again.

Yummo! In Louisiana we eat bread pudding often, and it closely resembled the taste you may find in a restaurant. It was super easy too. I sliced the apples really thin, and baked in a 9x13 pan since I didn't have a 7x11. It worked great.

I cut the recipe in half; did not use raisins or the vanilla sauce.  Served with homemade cinnamon syrup and whipped cream. There were no leftovers.  Next time, will make the full servings so we can have some for the next day.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful treat, MESHEL !

I used skim milk and unsalted butter and this turned out really good!  The only thing is that it seemed quite oily.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of butter or use applesauce in place of the margarine.  Overall, pretty good!  And ditto on the house smelling amazing while it was baking!

I had some pears to use up and I couldn't find any "pear bread pudding" recipe that I liked. So I decided to go with this except use pear for apple. I followed the recipe exactly while using left-over whole wheat sliced breads and adding 1t of brandy extract and handful of toasted, chopped walnuts. Used light cream instead of milk and sprinkled ground ginger on top along with some honey before putting in oven. It did take longer than stated time here, but that might be because I placed about a cup of water underneath the baking dish. Didn't make the sauce, but it was still delicious. Next time I will try with apples!

Yummy!  I actually made it with Strawberries rather than Apples.  Wonderful and I was skeptical with some of the reviews I had read.  But I loved the very moist texture.  I was also nervous because both stovetop mixtures included milk and they curdled a little.  But that didn't make any difference in the final product.  But I did add about a tsp. of corn starch to the sauce to thicken it a little more.  Overall - Yummy!!

I made this super quick and it was very good. The only thing i would complain about is that I didnt have the right size pan, but it didnt matter much.  I loved the apples in it, my husband ate it with some ice cream.  Its a nice way to use up bread before it goes.

I just made this and it is delicious. I subbed egg beaters for the real eggs to cut the cholesterol and added 3/4 cup butterscoth chips. I didn't add raisins, personal preference. It is golden, fluffy, oh so simple. I baked it for 40 minutes. I like to scoop vanilla ice cream out of the carton into a bowl and let it melt. Then it can be poured on top of any dessert, kind of like a creme anglese. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my husband and served it with vanilla ice cream.  We both loved it!  I omitted the raisins (personal preference) and baked it in a water bath based on other reviews.  I'm not a great cook, but this was really easy to make, and turned out absolutely delicious!!

Yum...yum...yummy!!!!! I used canned apples because I made a LARGE batch for a holiday party. I also used french bread and added pecans. So many rave reviews from the guest. I have now added this to my holiday recipe list.  I also added rum to the vanilla sauce, that was also a hit.

Good flavor but a bit too dry.  Cream helped as did vanilla ice cream on top.  Easy to do and a good way to use leftover raisin-cinnamon bread.

Mine turned out a bit wet the first time, so I modified the recipe to 5 cups of bread cubes (I used a French bread loaf).  For the sauce, I made a caramel (equal parts butter and brown sugar) and added raspberry Chambord and lit it, then drizzled on top of servings and sprinkled each with a couple of fresh raspberries!  Excellent!

DH had been strongly hinting that he would like some bread pudding (even bought a little cookbook of breading pudding recipes for me while on vaca this summer). Decided on this recipe the other day. Followed suggestions of softening apple slices in skillet. Left out raisins. Made sauce as directed. This was absolutely delicious. It does make way more sauce than is needed for one pan, but it is yummy! Thanks for a great recipe! It's one I will definitely be using again!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy to make and was a great switch from our usual apple pie.  I'll defiinitely use this one again.  The vanilla sauce was soooooooo good.  It can be used with other desserts!

Wow!!  I wish I could give it more than just five stars.  This was truly extra special!!  I had a mixture of whole wheat and white hot dog buns to use up and a couple pieces of cinnamon bread.  I ended up using 6 cups of bread cubes.  I also had a mushy apple that was headed towards the trash, so I cut that up.  I used a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of nutmeg and it turned out perfectly.  Not soupy at all.  If I wasn't so full I'd have another serving.  Didn't make the sauce, we used whipped cream instead.

i have only made this once, but it was super yummy and will make it again.  i used Texas Toast for the bread which made perfect cubes.  we are not a raisin friendly house, so i omitted them.  the apples were a perfectly tart match for the sweetness of the pudding.  my glaze separated, so it wasn't that great.  plus, i think it might have pushed the pudding a little over the sweetness threshold.  but overall a great dish.  it is now in my recipe box!

I thought it was overly bready and fairly bland, however, I didn't serve it with the vanilla sauce.  Used vanilla ice cream instead.

I love this recipe and I make it all the time.. I give it 4-stars b/c I think it is overly-sweet as written. But when I make my adjustments, it is a 5-star dessert!  I use about 4-5cups bread and about 3/4 cup sugar. I always toss in extra apple chunks and cinnamon. I use the ends of whole wheat bread and have even used oatmeal and nut breads.

The taste was incredible!  The apples really added that special kick.  The only complaint I have it was a little dry to my liking but I will make it again with a little more liquid nest time.

This recipe was great. My first time making bread pudding and I will definitely make this again! I used cinnamon-raisin bread and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. My husband couldn't get enough!

I would give this a 5-star rating, but from some reviews, I thought that it may be too sweet, so I reduced the brown sugar to about 3/4 cup (and of course used butter instead of margarine!) and it was perfect!  My husband and I both like it very much.  The sauce is a good complement to the bread pudding.  Rather than going to the trouble of whipping cream, we just poured a little on top and that worked just fine!

I made this using Splenda brown sugar and Pepperidge farm cinnamon bread.  Also, I added toasted pecans and substituted craisins for the raisins.  It was delicious, and the house smelled wonderful!!

This was my first experience making a bread pudding and it turned out excellent. I omitted the raisins because I don't like much. I also didn't care much for the sauce, I would prefer to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for this wonderful recipe, it has been saved on my favorite's file.

This was an excellent recipe! I would totally recommend it. Wouldn't use 2% milk though, had an odd curdling effect when i warmed it with the margarine-- despite this my bread pudding came out of the oven looking and tasting great!

Excellent bread pudding! The sauce was just a little too sweet, though, as we enjoyed it much more with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

was a big hit at my small dinner party. next time i would use a little more apples and less raisens, the raisens overtook the pudding. i also followed another viewers idea and sauted the raisens and apples in butter and a splash of brandy which added a wonderful flavor. definietly a keeper recipe.

Okay, I made this for the playoffs party this weekend.  The recipe did better than the Eagles did.  It was delicious and I made it the night before.  Because people said it was soupy in previous reviews, I only added add half of the vanilla sauce on the top.  It was plenty sweet enough with half the mixture and not soggy at all.  I did not change anything else about the recipe.  I did not add raisins because my husband doesn't like cooked raisins.  I do, so I suffered in silence.

Now this is comfort food at its best!!  This was delicious and so easy.  I've made it with and without the vanilla sauce and I definitely prefer it without.  This dish is so flavorful already you can skip that extra work.  Just serve with vanilla ice cream if you're looking for a little extra something with this. Although it definitely doesn't need it!

This is soooooo good!  I love to cook but am not a baker.  This is the best dessert I've ever made.  My husband commented several times how good it was.  Four of us ate the whole pan in one night and my family is asking for more today.  As a non-baker I followed the recipe exactly except I added the sauce to individual servings rather than pouring it all over the top.

This is amazing!!!!  I made this with leftover homemade Challah bread that was getting dried out.  It was not mushy due to the bread being a little old.  The flavor is so good!  I did leave out the raisins since we are not fans of them and added a little more apple.  I will be making this again. Thank you!

I gave this a 2 star because my husband didn't think it was that bad. I found it to be "mushy" and didn't care for the texture. I will not be making this again. :-(

I loved this recipe!!  I made it exactly as stated except I was leary of pouring egg mixture on top so I mixed it in.  I also put a pan of water in lower level of oven.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan, it cooked in 50 minutes.

This was lovely.  I made it for dessert while visiting family for the holidays.  My sister-in-law's grandmother kept grousing, "I've never heard of applies in bread pudding.  Who puts apples in bread pudding."  Joy..... Well, even she begrudgingly admitted it was ok.  Everyone else loved it.  Like others, I simply used cinnamon raisin bread and didn't bother with the sauce.  Try this recipe on a cold day.  You'll love it.

This was delicious! Everyone raved about this dessert. It smelled heavenly while I was baking it. I had it with the vanilla sauce, and it reminded me of the bread pudding which my host mother used to make. I homestayed in an American family when I was studying English in the States. My host mother was a great cook. She blessed me with wonderful American homestyle dishes. I loved everything she made. Anyway, this bread pudding tasted just like her famous bread pudding. :)

EXCELLENT!!! I did make a few changes, (don't you just hate that in a review!!LOL) I used cinnamon raisin swirl bread and added 1/2 cup of walnuts then just omitted the cinnamon in the eggs. The sauce did appear to be curdling but smoothed out wonderfully after I took it off the heat and whisked in the vanilla..thanks for the recipe =)

While this recipe was great and smelled and tasted so good... I had some problems making it. I can't believe no one else mentioned the milk curdling! I happened when I made the pudding and the sauce. It was fine until it boiled then I had to strain out all the chunks. I did not care for the sauce at all because it was more of a liquid than a sauce. It never thickened at all, but I don't think it was needed as this was really sweet to begin with.

Super easy and tastes great!  I used week old bread which I let soak up the milk mixture for about 10-15 minutes as per another reviewer.  I also subbed walnuts for the raisins and added nutmeg.  I did not make the sauce since I took it to work as a morning snack.  Everyone loved it!

Tasty and super-easy! I modified it by using splenda brown sugar and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Perfect on a cool fall day.

I made this again a few days ago using plain Challah, adding the raisins, and using the Vanilla Sauce.  The sauce causes the decrease in stars as it really isn't a vanilla sauce, rather a butter sauce.  My picky eater, who loved it in 2008 with no sauce, took one bite and refused to eat it again.  The bread pudding is 5 stars, the sauce doesn't earn 1 star for our tastes. Original Review 10/10/08 - 5 Stars - Wonderful!  Even the pickiest of eaters loved this dish.  I used leftover Raisin Challah which made it all the better.  Not having time to make the sauce, I served it with homemade vanilla ice cream.

I made this for the first time last weekend for the family. My brother-in-law who has never bread pudding loved it right along with the whole family. I made 12 servings. I put it all in a 13x9 pan and baked it at 300 deg for about 90 minutes. It came out perfect.

This tasted like a fine resturant dessert. When I served this dessert at the table, I took one bite and got up and made some homade whipped cream to go with it. Everyone raved and fussed about how good it was. Thanks, Ann

I used a TON of bread cubes, so the top was kind of crusty. The vanilla sauce was the perfect thing to to soften it. My roommates and I LOVED it.

This was on of the best bread pudding recipies I have made.  The apples really add a lot. I added 1 more egg and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  Just personal reference. We like it a little moist and love vanilla.

Excellent moist bread pudding.  I thought I didn't like bread pudding but found out that is not true.  Hubby loved it!.  I made the vanilla sauce listed but added a Tbsp. of flour to the sugar mixture before adding the butter and milk.  It was not too thin and was a nice addition to the bread pudding.

Delicious!  I used plain sandwich bread and omitted the raisins.  I also added one extra egg (for a total of 3) and topped it with a glaze I found on this site.  It's by far the best bread pudding recipe I've tried.

I diced my apples (granny smiths)instead of slicing & will again....I don't think it would have been as enjoyable w/ apple slices. I omitted the raisins & I used a mixture of stale hamburger buns & WW bread. I allowed the bread to soak in the egg & milk for about 10 minutes before popping in the oven. Because of the reviews, I forewent the vanilla sauce & used Hershey's dulce de leche sauce instead....perfecto! Thansk Meshel!

WOW! I put this in the crockpot for 3 hours on low...watch though, I took a spatula and scraped the sides so it wouldn't burn.  I also put my raisins in some water and put it in the microwave for to get hot so they would plump up.  I wasn't up for the vanilla sauce, so I made a Caramel Sauce using a can of sweetened condensed milk simmered in water for 3 hours. Found that recipe on here...the neighbors are still talking about it!

Hmmmm....what can I say.  I went over and over the recipe to see if I did anything wrong.  My pudding was dry and had bits of cooked scambled eggs in it.  The sauce was really thin and greasy and seperated.  I love bread pudding.  Compared to another recipe that I found here, this one isn't that great.  Oh well, we all have different tastes I guess.

Substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, and doubled the vanilla otherwise made exactly to recipe.  Used half whole wheat, half white bread.  Used Granny Smith apples which I sauteed first in a little butter.  Served the first night with vanilla ice cream, made the sauce for the next night.  The kids liked ice cream best, grown-ups preferred the sauce (which had to be warmed up to eliminate grainy texture).  Will definitely make again but will use raisins (since my kids don't like cooked craisins either), will also add some extra cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.  Will definitely use half wheat bread again, it really made a nice contribution.  Very yummy!

We cooked it, we devoured it, we wished we had more ... I will definitely make it again.  The sauce seemed to much for the recipe, so we poured leftover sauce over slices of bread and that was yummy too.  Altogether a fantastic recipe.

How can you not love this recipe!? I have tried it a few times, and each time I have made a different serving amount with a different size baking dish. One time, I refrigerated the pudding before I put it in the oven. I didn't think it tasted as good. I also used a thinner pan and it made the pudding a little crustier. I think it is all preference. The recipe calls for way too much butter at the end, but my husband seemed to like that one the best.

Very flavorful, but I think I will try it again with a denser bread.  A little gooey, even after baking for an additional 15 minutes.  I didn't use raisins which may have soaked up more of the liquid. Did not care for the sauce. Too watery.  Not nearly as good as my Mom's vanilla sauce that uses 1/2 the butter and 2 Tbsp flour to thicken.

Very good. I have made this twice and would recommend baking it for only 30 minutes so that it is still soft. I made my own vanilla sauce after reading previous reviews.

I must have done something wrong.  The bread pudding was watery, even though I used French bread and baked it for an hour.   The sauce was too thin.  The overall flavor was ok, but I won't make this one again.  Sorry.

This recipe was WONDERFUL.  I recommend using a heartier type of bread like french bread or an Italian loaf (not sliced)like I did, rather than plain old cotton white bread.  It is a mouth-watering, melt in your mouth combination of the sweet bread, and the baked apples in one dish.

Very, very delicious!!! I omitted the raisins and added 1 Tbsp. of Bourbon and 1/4 cup of chopped, toasted pecans. I did not make the vanilla sauce, but served it with vanilla ice cream instead. Also, I used mostly whole wheat bread with a little cinnamon bread thrown in. It came out great and I will definitely be making this again!

I have made this twice now and it doesn't even last 24 hours! I do not make the vanilla sauce and I am very OK without it. The second time I added another apple and cut them in chunks. The apples really add to the recipe.  The is a great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I did make a couple of modifications. Instead of raisins I used craisins, just because they were on hand. I also baked it in a bundt pan, removed it immediately, and poured the vanilla sauce over individual servings.

This was DELICIOUS! I cut the sugar down by 1/4c and it was perfectly sweet. I copied another raters review and sauteed the apples a bit before hand just to soften them up. I also added another egg. Next time I would actually add a bit more apple- just personal taste. I didn't use the vanilla sauce, but topped with whipped cream. I reheated this twice and the second time was even better than the first. The flavors just marinated even more!

Great recipe, only changes were that I doubled the recipe and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Will definitely make it again.

Yum! It was rather liquidy, so not sure if I did something wrong. But upon reheating this goes away. It was even better the 2nd and 3rd day.

Used almond milk for lactose issues. Took a little longer than 50 minutes  to bake. Maybe because of the milk. I might add an extra egg the next time. Tasty and delicious.

This was great kept everything the same except I used hot cross buns for the bread and once the mixture was in the baking pan I added another topping of cubes hot cross bun bread to give it a crunch with the sauce I didn’t boil anything in the stove I just poured the sauces right over top shut the oven and walked away
Excellent!

Great recipe. I cut it in half as it was for a small dinner and it worked very well. Only thing I didn’t cut in half was the vanilla, I only use high quality vanilla so it added great flavor. I will say that using butter in the glaze instead of margarine caused it to separate. I ended up just pouring half of it over the pudding halfway through the baking time and I tossed the rest. Next time I make it will likely add some bourbon and make bourbon whipped cream to go along with it. Ultimately, this is a great foundation that you can add and tweak to make your own very easily.

Yum yum yum!! I didn't use raisins, and added 4 eggs instead if two, also added sauce about 5 minutes before it was done, for some reason it separated thus why added it to the pudding before. Other than that followed directions just as called for & it is honestly one of the best bread puddings I've ever eaten. My boys also thought so too!!

I made this for my husband who is a bread pudding lover.  I'm not usually a fan, but I liked this one because it wasn't overly sweet.  My husband?  Loved it!  I only gave it 4 stars because the vanilla sauce was off.  It needed to be cooked longer or something.  If I make again I will find a different recipe for the sauce.

I made this with a few modifications based on other reviews.  I did saute the apples and raisins in the butter (I used butter, not margarine- that stuff is pretty bad for ya) and then mixed it with the bread.  I made the custard in the same skillet, using 1 cup milk and a half cup of cream that needed using up, only a half cup of sugar and 3 eggs instead of two, as other comments said it was too sweet and too runny.  I think I actually could have reduced the milk even more, as the apples gave off a lot of juice and I think that's what is making it soft.  However I will say that after it cooled after cooking it solidified much better, so maybe we should have let it cool longer.  But it looked and smelled so delicious that we couldn't wait to dig in!  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving and was more popular than the pie!  I didn't make the vanilla sauce, instead we drizzled warm caramel sauce (jarred dulce de leche from TJ's) on it and it was phenomenal.  If you plan on using a sauce I'd definitely reduce the sugar!  I thought a half cup was perfect even without sauce on it, the sauce made it almost too sweet.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! My husbands' favorite dessert in the entire world is bread pudding, and he LOVES this version!!! I found all the different steps a bit over much, but I'd have to say it's worth it - and I'm sure I'll make it for him again!

Delicious. I prepared this bread pudding with apple pie filling I had frozen so didn’t follow recipe exactly. When I served this to my husband and guests it was a hit with second servings requested. The vanilla sauce was great and I added a dollop of Dulce de Leche.  GREAT dessert.

Delicious every time I make it!  I especially love the sauce, but usually skip it, just because it is fine by itself or with whipped cream, and honestly, I'm too lazy!!

Came out perfectly but I did reduce the sugar to 2/3.   Cooked it in slightly slower. I skipped the sauce.

I am on a mission to create the ultimate bread pudding recipe and figured I would start here.  I made this recipe with the following changes:  No raisins  (I was out of everything that even resembled a raisin) and I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla.  I heated the milk mixture, tempered the egg mix, then mixed eggs and milk together and poured them over the bread and apples in a large bowl.  I tossed this mixture gently then put it in a 9x13 baking pan.  It needed to bake for a full 60 minutes and it came out just fine.  The flavor is delicious but the texture is mushier than I like (4 stars for texture, but I am kind of funny about mushy bread).  That said, I would make this again.  The next time I will  use either drier or denser bread for a firmer texture.  Fresh french bread was too soft. I liked that the apples were a little chewy but would consider sauteing them with some butter so they would be softer to start.  I would also chunk instead of slice the apples to about half the size of the bread pieces. Toasted pecans and/or coconut would be really good on the top.  This dessert is sweet and moist enough to eat without a sauce.  If I was going to use a sauce, I would cut back on the sugar by half.  All in all a very tasty recipe.

Read MANY reviews - used maple syrup instead of topping - added more apples (what I had on hand) and a cup of raisons - presoaked (saturated). One person commented wished she had some kind of alcohol to soak raisons in - wish I did too!!

Five stars for flavor, especially when made with tart apples. Thank you to all the reviewers who mentioned that the pudding came out soupy. I researched a bit and found that most bread puddings have a ratio of two eggs to one cup of milk, rather than the near one-to-one in this recipe. I used four eggs and the texture was perfect!

I made it late last night and didn't have the milk to make the vanilla sauce.  It is still awesome without it.  I love it!! I tasted it again this morning and oh yeah the day after is so much better!!! It is so good!  I will make it again and again and again, etc.  :)  Oh yeah I only use skimmed milk, so hey it is still tasting so good!! I am taking this to church so I won't eat it all.

I hate raisins so I sub raisins for blueberries and it took this breadpudding to the next level. Easy and yummy recipe and the blueberries and apples in it were delicious! I also used leftoever apple turnovers instead of bread and it was rich and delicious.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is. I made it with hard rolls that had dried out. We ate it with vanilla ice cream last night. I ate the rest today without sauce or ice cream. Perfect! Not as sweet as most desserts.

Man, is this stuff good!  I made a few additions, but this is a very good and easy recipe to follow.   I doubled the raisins and soaked in 2 Tbs. rum with 2 Tbs. water.  They were old so they really needed plumping.  I then chopped the apples and simmered on the stove in the butter for 10 minutes.  Turned off the heat and added the sugar, stirred until melted and then added the rest of the ingredients except for the eggs.  For the milk I used 1-1/2 cups evaporated milk plus 1/4 cup half & half.   I also added 1/2 tsp. each ginger and allspice plus 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Increased vanilla to 1 tsp.  Dumped in the raisins with the soaking liquid.  Since the milk cooled off the mix, added the beaten eggs ( I used 3) and stirred. This was all done in the saucepan that sauteed the apples.  Poured mixture over the bread (1/2 multi-grain with nuts and 1/2 sour dough) that was in a large bowl.  Let all soak on counter 1 hour, poured into 8 X 8 baking dish (forgot to spray with Pam, didn't need it).  Was about to put in the oven when I realized I forgot the nuts.  Chopped a handful of walnuts, sprinkled on top, and dunked into mixture with a spatula.  Baked 55 minutes.  Yum! The multi-grain bread added a lot of flavor.  Had been saving the bread to make croutons but also needed to use up 2 apples and made this instead.  Good decision!  So good it didn't need any sauce so didn't make.  Might leave out half n half next time and cook 5 minutes less.

This is absolutely yummy!  I simplified the steps by soaking the bread in the milk (used a mix of milk and 1/2 & 1/2).  While that was happening I threw the butter into a skillet and let it melt with a handful of walnuts to toast them.  Then added a

I made this today. So delicious. I used cinnamon-raisin bread, toasted the cubes, and added a pear plus the 2 apples. Then put in some dried cranberries because I had them on hand. They gave a special tangy favor. I'll be making this again.

So good! Followed CATJENKINS directions, used a bit less sugar. Added a bit extra spices: 1/8 teaspoon allspice, 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/8 teaspoon ginger, 1/4 teaspoon cloves. Also did a vanilla pudding topping which was thicker and turned out delicious.

Excellent! I took the advice of other reviewers and used four eggs. I mixed the bread, milk and beaten eggs together first and let it soak. Then I sauteed the apples and raisins in the butter, then stirred the brown sugar in along with about a teaspoon of cinnamon. I let that cool a little before adding it all to the bread mixture. I cooked it until it puffed up completely, about 45 minutes. I didn't make the sauce but had some whipped cream that worked very well. I also think vanilla ice cream would be fantastic with this recipe!

The flavor was good, but the result was way too dense. I think the directions of pouring the milk combo into the bowl with bread then the prepared pan was the mistake. It seemed like it never really puffed up the way bread pudding should.  I was a bit dissapointed.

Liked the overall flavor and it didn't seem to be too sweet.  That said, I did soak the raisins in whiskey and added a tablespoon of that raisin liquid to the bread mixture.   The recipe seems to have a few extra steps since everything is mixed separately and then added together.   The sauce separates if not served hot but does add to the flavor of the dish.  Not sure if I  will make it again.

I made this with dry french bread, 1 tlb. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. cloves. I also briefly cooked the apples and raisins in butter.
 We omitted the  sauce because the pudding was so watery looking going into the oven that I really didn't think that it would turn out and I didn't want to waste the ingredients. It turned out like pudding and was sweet and very good. I'm not sure what the sauce would add to that, but I'll try it next time without raisins. Thanks for the recipe!

I made the bread pudding as directed, but I noticed from the reviews that a lot of people are having issues with the sauce. I let the sauce cool to approx. room temperature, and then whisked a room temperature egg into it - making it into a thin pudding. The sauce turned out beautifully this way!

I made this today.I know it has to be great as written. But like most I to had to play. I thought orange juice might be good in it. So I used half oj for the liquid. I too cooked the apples a little first. I must say "it is wonderful!". I made a little glaze of powered sugar, butter and oj. Drizzled it on while hot. This is the only recipe I will use for bread pudding. I will be trying it as written also. Thanks!

First time I have ever made Bread Pudding, and I picked this one as my first, glad I did.  It turned out great, rich flavours, and the raisins and apples made it extra good. 

The only thing I did different was mixing in the egg combo with the bread and fruit, then I placed that into the baking dish, then I made the liquid combo and poured that over the rest of the ingredients.  While I was waiting for the butter to milk in the sugar/milk, it gave time for the bread to soak up the egg, so I didn't end up with cooked eggs as it baked. 

I didn't make the sauce, just used whipped cream, and it was still very good.  Have saved this, in my faves, for future baking.

I made it with left over sweet rolls, four apples ready to go, a banana, and some juice of an orange.  Used a 3/4 cup of half and half.  It was what I had on hand and needed to use up.  This recipe was so close ...  Eating with syrup and vanilla ice cream!  Yummo!

We used whole grain bread since that is what we had, and didn't make the vanilla sauce. It was still sooooo delicious we will definitely be making it again! Thank you!

Flavors great. Like my bread pudding drier than this turned out. I baked it for 70 minutes. It was still too wet.
I did not understand putting the cinnamon egg mixture on top. I don't see how it could mix evenly, so  I stirred it together after adding the mix.  What are others doing?

DELICIOUS! Although I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I made pear muffins the day before which didn't turn out so good so I decided I would make a bread pudding with them. I used that, and I did not add any apples or raisins to the pudding. I should've cut back on the sugar because the muffin bread was already sweet, but it turned out amazing nevertheless. 40 minutes in the oven was perfect.

I just finished making this tonight and pretty much followed the recipe exactly. I am restraining myself from eating the whole thing in one sitting. Absolutely delicious. And it doesn't seem to matter what kind of bread because I really use some old crumbly bread and it turned out great.

I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.  I did not cook the first sauce. I combined all the ingr. with a wisk and poured over the bread mixture. I did not make the sauce. Instead I topped it with ice cream. This recipe is a keeper.

It's yummy but I think it would taste better with peaches in it. My mom makes bread pudding with peaches instead of apples and she adds pecans, still uses raisins. I prefer her recipe but this was still very tasty and pretty simple to make. I skipped the sauce and just used whipped cream. Tasted great,  I think the sauce would have made it a bit too rich/sweet. Will make again. Also I used an 8X8 pan and it was perfect size.

I made this the other night and it was my first bread pudding.... I used leftover dinner rolls instead and it worked well. I ran put of milk so I used a can of evaporated milk too. I left the skin on some of the apples and I will not do that again as some skins didn't cook. I also didn't make the icing as we have been eating it with honey drizzled. I will make it again...

Very good! This is the first time I make a bread pudding cake and first time I ate it. I lost the chance to try it on my last trip to USA. I increased a lot the bread because it was too little to absorb the milk. I put raisins in water and amaretto di Saronno!! My mom( she's picky about cakes) loved it! Thanks for the recip!!

I always twist recipes to make use of what I have at hand.  And today I had a week old Apple pie from Walmart sitting in the fridge which everyone at house had refused to eat and about almost empty 3 packets of left over regular bread pieces and ends lying on my kitchen counter top..  You know the kind everyone forgets to eat when a fresh packet arrives.  And I can't even begin to express how much I hate throwing away food. So here's what I did. I took the baking casserole and layered it with broken chunks of apple pie and that made the base for my pudding. I threw the torn pieces of ALL KIND of leftover bread I had over that. I followed the rest of the recipe for the pudding except that I used just half a cup of white sugar and a quarter cup of maple syrup! Well yeah that's my idea of brown sugar when I  don't have it and am really just trying to get some breakfast in place :) But......  This turned out delicious and I am super amazed by my clumsiness :p Thank you!

Very good. I will definately make this again.  The only thing I would change is, I poured the topping on the bread pudding when it came out of the oven.  Next time, I will put the topping on per each individual serving.  I think it may even be sweet enough without any of the topping.  Delicious and easy to make!

This was great,  easy to make. Took advice of some of the reviewers..  Great suggestion, Made it in a frying pan then put in muffin pans, easier for serving. I was taking to a dinner party, friend doesn't like raisins so I used dried cherries & put chocolate chips in half, didn't need sauce ...they were a hit, good either hot or cold.

I didn't want to use a cake pan so I used a muffin pan,I had to add 4 pieces of bread,and I added a little extra raisins, but when I cook with raisins I like to boil them in water first, then drain them before adding them that way they are soft,but they turned out really good

This recipe got rave reviews at my office party. We all agree that it is perfect even without the sauce. It is sweet and moist enough to skip the sauce if you wish to simplify or cut calories. The recipe is easy to make and tastes great!

I read the reviews AFTER I made and served this. We really liked it! However, when making the recipe I felt it would not set well with only two eggs, so I used four eggs. I also had cinnamon chips that  needed to use up so I added those to the bread pudding.  This was not overly sweet and was not soupy or wet and had a perfect texture.  I will most certainly make this one again.

I thought this recipe was delicious, though admittedly I am partial to bread puddings.  I thought the pudding stood well on its own and didn't need the sauce, though if you have a sweet tooth, the sauce is very good, too.

I made this recipe yesterday and took it to a gathering with friends.  It was a big hit!  I used both the vanilla sauce and an additional whiskey sauce.  This recipe will be at the top of my desert recipe file!  We loved it.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this with persimmons instead of apples and it was a huge hit… would definitely make again with apples or any other fruit I have on hand.

To make a Caramel Apple version, omit the raisins, and add chopped walnuts or pecans to the recipe. Instead of making the sauce, drizzle with caramel ice cream topping after baking.

This was a great recipe! Really delicious. I didn't have fresh apples in the house, so I used a can of apple pie filling, and cut back on the sugar. Excellent results. Putting this in my permanent recipe box!

Loved it.  I did exchange dried tart cherries instead of the raisins, and used Granny Smith apples.  Certainly will make again.

Loosely followed the measurements for the ingredients, but pretty much used up leftover bread and apple.  Used golden raisins, and omitted the sauce.  It was good.

This was awesome and I don't usually eat bread pudding much less make it. I had some apples left from season picking and a whole loaf of bread that was close to expire, seeing I was tired of apple pie and crisp I decided to give it a try. I used 3/4 of a cup of the brown sugar instead, dropped the raisins and used caramel candy drops, 2 whole eggs plus 1 egg white, the rest was the original recipe. It was absolutely delish!!

Way, way too sweet for me;  all I could taste was sweet.  For the pudding, made per recipe except halved the cinnamon and doubled the vanilla.  The sauce didn't work out for me (separated) but likely because I had to sub:  half and half for milk and spreadable butter for margarine. But I can't imagine having a sweet sauce on something this sweet anyway.  I don't have much experience with bread pudding but feel sure that the number of dirty dishes could be cut.  I know putting the eggs in hot liquid is a bad idea, but surely there is an alternative to baking dish, large bowl, small saucepan, small bowl, and saucepan...not that I'm lazy or anything :-)....

Wonderful combo for bread pudding.  The natural sweetness of the apples meant I didn't need to use much of the vanilla sauce. Will definitely make it again…this one is a keeper!

I thought this was the best bread pudding I have ever had.  Used the water bath so it stayed very moist.  Also, as a special treat, added blueberries and walnuts instead of apples and raisons.  Yum!!

We love raisins so we did a full cup on a double batch. The only thing I would change is next time I think I going to cut the milk back to 3 cups (double batch) to make it a bit dryer. I also think that using fresh peaches would be a great substitute for apples.

Not sweet enough for us.  I did increase the bread but it was a sweetened cinnamon bread.  Still very tasty!
Yes, I'd make it again . . . mixing dry ingredients and liquids separately, then combine in one bowl.

I made this and it was delicious! I made only small changes, based on the advice of other reviewers: added ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. I also didn't peel the apples because that seemed like too much work, but I prefer it that way! I used sweet honey crisp apples.

Although I generally dislike bread pudding, this is a very good recipe for it. I used pears instead of apples, and cooked the fruit separately with a bit of sugar. I also needed to use about 1/4 c. of extra milk to keep the bread soft.

Totally doesn't even need the sauce. If you want sauce though, i would just drizzle maple syrup over it. So delicious. i used a 9 x 13 pan of this recipe and it was not to soggy or to dry. Just right!

I used leftover challah - good bread definitely improves the bread pudding texture and taste!  I made the recipe as written except I used butter instead of margarine, and i added the sugar/milk/butter mixture to the bowl with the bread/apples/raisins, and then added the egg/vanilla mixture and stirred it up before dumping it into the baking pan.  I made a double batch which filled my 11x17 pan; and I sprinkled cinnamon on top of it.  It was so moist and crunchy on top - super comfort food!  I didn't bother with the sauce but it didn't need it -it was so good!  everyone wanted the recipe!

This was so good!!! As an alternative to the vanilla sauce I prepared a maple syrup sauce : Boil 1 cup water, 1 cup maple syrup, ½ cup brown sugar for 5 minutes. Combine 3 tbsp softened butter with 3 tbsp flour and gradually spoon in the syrup mix while stirring until it thickens. I didn't change the ingredients except I used butter instead of margarine and prepared it a bit different : combine milk and vanilla, add the bread and raisins, let rest for 5 minutes. Cream butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, add eggs and beat for 5 minutes. Combine this with bread mixture and add apples. I followed another reviewer's advice and placed the dish into a larger water dish for baking. PERFECTION !!!

I made this on the first day of fall. I had some stale whole wheat italian bread and some fresh apples.  I cut the sugar in half by substituting Splenda, and it tasted great.  Also, I used the full amount of milk, but let the bread cubes absorb it for about 15 minutes before baking.  Then I poured on the egg mixture and baked it.  My family loved it.  This was easy to throw together with ingredients I had on hand.

This was very good. I stuck to the recipe for the most part.  I used cinnamon raisin bread so I didn't have to add any additional raisins. I made the sauce as instructed but then I added some caramel and a splash of brandy. It smells wonderful while baking!  I will definitely make again.

Instead of directly following the recipe, I used CATJENKINS's steps and found out it saved me a lot of time.  Also, I will have to double the recipe next time because my bread pudding was less than an inch thick.  Also the time set was a little too long because my bread pudding came out slightly burnt, which might be because of its thinnest.  Will try it again since my family liked it so much last time.

Oh gosh, this was good!  I had apples and bread I needed to use up.  When I found this recipe, it was perfect.  I substituted Splenda for the sugars (white and brown) and used low fat milk, but left everything else just as written.  It was tasty and  easy to make.  Thank you, Meshel.

I was disappointed with this one as it had such great reviews. Mine turned out very soggy and with an odd flavour. If I did something wrong that's too bad because I have no desire to even try it again.

I love the recipe; it's very rich, be sure to pour a tall glass of milk!  I did not care for the sauce, however.  Other reviewers mentioned vanilla ice cream--good call!

This turned out fabulous.  I didn't have a 7x11 baker so I adjusted the recipe to a 9x13.  It wasn't very thick, so next time I will use an even smaller pan or more ingredients.  The sauce was a little watery, but the flavor was wonderful!!

this was the first time ever making bread pudding, this recipe was easy, the only thing that I changed was I sauted the apples first in a tbspn of butter and 2 tbspns of brown sugar to soften up the apples and it added extra moistness to the pudding and it was awesome...my family loved it..

This was really very good. My only problem was that my sauce was lumpy. I followed the recipe, but I couldnt get the lumps to go away. It didnt make sense to me. It was still tasty though. I will be making this again, just perhaps with a different sauce.

Favorite thing in the world= bread pudding. This recipe is soooo good. Ive made others that were too "eggy", not this one. I made a loaf of white/wheat in the bread machine with maple syrup and it made this reicpe to die for. I have to control myself so there will be some left when the kids get home from school. So yummy!!

Excellent! Yes the water bath makes it creamier, but I made the recipe as is except I only had 1 apple.  I'll make this again.  A wonderful way to use stale bread.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious. I made a couple of modifications--simmered the apples and raisins in rum and butter, and mixed the egg mixture right into the pudding instead of pouring it over. It was great, will def make again.

Excellent Recipe.  The sauce makes it.  I served it with yogurt because I didn't have ice cream, and that actually worked out well becuase it didn't add a lot more "sweet".  Wonderful with home made bread.

Super great recipe! I make it all the time and people always ask me for the recipe. It is great warm with ice cream, room temp or even right out of the fridge. I have also made it a few time with low fat ingredients and bread, works great every time!   I have never made the vanilla sauce though, so it make it not too sweet.

Made exactly as directed, except I used a French Baguette and I tossed a handful of candied walnuts in with the raisins and apples.  It came out Perfect!! My husband doesnt like bread pudding and he loved this.  I did not make the vanilla sauce but served with vanilla icecream instead.  This is what I now plan on making for the next cook out.  I may try using frozen or canned apples for time.  Oh and for those that dont keep raisins on hand... 1/4 cup is one snack box

Made a few adjustments, I used dried apple instead of fresh which turned out fine. Also added an 1/8 cup flour to sauce to thicken it because it was rather runny. Overall a great recipe

I cooked the apples and raisins with some butter before mixing, as one of the other people had advised, and added some maple syrup and it tasted great! I love this recipe and I use the crusts of the bread from when I make a big batch of cucumber sandwiches, so it doesn't go to waste. Perfect!

I've been avoiding rating this recipe because maybe I screwed up since this is the first time I've made bread pudding.  I made this for my mom who loves apples but both of us didn't care for it.  On the other hand, my dad and fiance loved it and finished it off quickly.

Can't go wrong with this stuff!  Yummy-yum-yum I put the pudding dish within a larger dish and filled the empty spaces left within the larger dish with water, and the texture was great...follow the review before this one - that person was perfectly right about how to do it right!

Made some changes. First only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, didn't use apples because I didn't have any. For the vanilla sauce, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar only. And 1/4 cup butter. My oven runs hot so only needed to bake it for 30 minutes.

This was amazing.  I tried two different batches when I first found the recipe: the first with Pepperidge Farms Raisin Bread, Jonagolds, and skim milk; the second with Sun-maid Raisin Bread, Granny Smiths, and whipping cream.  While the first was okay, I did have problems with the skim milk curdling when I was heating it.  This was probably just because I was distracted and multi-tasking.  I was much more careful with the second batch, and it turned out AMAZINGLY.  Very highly recommended!

great recipe.  This recipe deserves it's great reviews.  My family (especially my hubby) enjoyed this recipe.  I followed hints from the first review.  Less steps/ less pans.  I also soaked raisins in  brandy.  My family really enjoyed the crusty bread around the edges of the pan.  We really preferred the recipe without the vanilla sauce on top.  I will definetely make this a family favourite.

I didn't honestly think I'd like this.  But I love bread pudding so I thought I'd try. It was AMAZING.  I used granny smith apples and it was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever made.  It's light and not overpowering.  My husband loved it too (not that it takes much).  If you like bread pudding, you have to try this recipe.  It was quick and easy too!

When I made this I didn't have any apples, so I used apple pie filling.  I beat the milk and eggs in a saucepan, added butter and melted that, then added apple pie filling and heated this until the thicking melted, I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and no sugar.  We don't like really sweet desserts.  I used a egg bread in the bottom of a casserole dish, raisins, and pour apple mixture over and grated fresh nutmeg on top.  As soon as I removed the pudding from the oven I poured the vanilla sauce over pudding.  Very good!

Absolutely wonderful, moist, and very tasty.  Husband could not stop talking about it.  My father even asked to take some home with him.  I took the suggestion of baking in a pan 1/2 filled with water to keep it moist - a must!  I will make again and again.  My mother suggested that it would really taste great with some chopped walnuts added - will try next time!  Thanks for a wonderful dessert!

I thought it was bland. Mostly the flavor was from the apples and nothing else. I served it with vanilla ice cream, and that made it alittle better to eat.

Yummy, even without the vanilla sauce.  Perfect way to use up all of my stale french bread!  Apples added spiced up the average bread pudding recipe which I appreciated.

Use 1 loaf of raisin bread, 3 c. diced apples, 1 c. brown sugar, a little over 1/4 c. light butter, 2 and 1/2 c. milk. 3 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon. baked covered with foil ~1 hr then broiled for 2 minutes. Skipped the sauce and served with vanilla ice cream on top. It made a little over 8 servings. Everyone loved it!

I didn't care for this, just wasn't the way I remember bread pudding. My family however, liked it. I would suggest blanching the raisins, and cutting the bread into 1/2" cubes (mine were apprx 1"). The top parts of the bread were getting dry and a little hard during baking, so I added about half of the topping while baking to add moisture, having 1/2 left over is PLENTY.

pretty tasty - but I did have to arrange the apples and bread in the pan or else you get all the bread on one side and the apples on the other.  It was easy just to place them in the baking dish.

Very good! I used mostly half and half for the milk since I was almost out of milk and I used craisins instead of raisins. 1/2 cup brown sugar is plenty!!!! I was concerned about pouring the egg mixture over top at the end, so I gradually stirred them into the milk mixture so they wouldn't begin to cook. Then I mixed everything up and dumped it into the baking pan. A pinch of salt will help bring out the flavor. I made no sauce. We ate it plain or w/ frozen yougurt.

This is dense and sweet and loaded with flavor.  A good old-fashioned pudding with wonderful texture and easy to put together. Tastes even better when it sits for a day and the flavors have time to blend.

This is the best bread pudding I've ever eaten, better than Grandma's.  This is one for my cookbook

I do love my bread and butter puddings, but this was just really 'yummy' Perhaps because I enhanced it with sultanas (instead of raisins) which had been soaked in whisky for 3 days until they were round and plump and exploded in your mouth when eating the pudding.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I followed it exactly. Checked it after 40 mins. in the oven and did another 10. Next time I might use 3 eggs as some suggested but otherwise it was just perfect. 

I did do the vanilla sauce but couldn't get past so much butter in it so I used 1/4 cup butter and added a little cornstarch to thicken, Came out great.

Thanks for sharing it!

This was really good!  I have to say I did not follow the recipe as written-although I do not disagree with it!  I made Apple Strudel Muffins from a recipe from this site, but subbed applesauce for the butter and they came out dry.  Instead of throwing them away, I made this bread pudding.  I made as is, only there were apples already in the muffins and there was already a lot of cinnomon, so I didn't add anymore.  This recipe saved the muffins and I think I will make it with this two step process again!  Thanks for the save!

Very tasty! Next time I will cook it a bit longer, as the bottom was still a bit too soggy for my tastes.

Very Good.  I wish that I would have cut the apples up more than just slice them.  The vanilla sauce to top the pudding seemed a bit runny.  Still very tasty.

Delicious!!! I followed the suggestion of sauteeing the sliced apples before adding the apples to the bread.  I used 2 tbs of the fat required (I used butter instead of margarine) and cut the brown sugar down by 1/4 of a cup.  I used the same pan I cooked the apples in to warm up the milk, sugar and butter.  I was afraid the pudding would be way too soggy with all that liquid but it turned out to be perfect.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe states but added some nutmeg and more bread (just 'cos I had a lot of stale leftovers!) and it was truly yummy. My husband is not a big dessert guy but he wolfed down two helpings *before* his dinner so it's a keeper in our house! Thank you so much.

Fantastic recipe, very easy and tasty. The vanilla sauce was a bit too greasy so I think next time I'll just use vanilla ice cream as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried a lot of bread pudding recipes and this was one of my favorites.  I diced the apples rather than slice them.  I didn't make any sauce.  It still wasn't exceptional or the best ever, but it was definitely good.

This was extremely good - I did dice my apples and it worked out fine. The vanilla sauce is unecessary, I think, it's really rich just the way it is. I think it would be good with a small scoop of ice cream, though.

I made this recipe with Miltons wheat bread and it turned out great.  My family gobbled it up and it would be great for breakfast too. using brown sugar instead of white gives it a caramel flavor. yum.

Great recipe. My hubby bought 2 loaves of Kids Wonder Bread, but our kids did not like the taste. I toasted the bread first and buttered each slice before cutting it into cubes. I used 3 eggs and added apple pie spice.  Baked at 350 in a water bath for a more custard like texture. It is sweet enough without the vanilla sauce, but we'll just have to have it anyway. Yummy!

This was one of the best bread puddings I've ever made!  I found, like others, that the vanilla sauce was too thin.  I used a mixture of powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla to make a sauce to drizzle on top.  The apples make it a great fall dessert...great comfort food!

This was fantastic! Not as eggy as some bread puddings can be. I think it is great with or without the vanilla sauce (and may save some calories without it!)

OMG this was NOT GOOD. I ended up with hard chewy things in my bread pudding that my kids thought was hamburger. It was the milk that became solid when cooked. I see no need to cook the milk sugar butter first. The apples dried out. I may try this again but I will put the apple raisins and 1/2 brown sugar on the bottom of pan add the bread and then mix milk eggs cin vanilla sugar and cooled melted butter and pour over bread then bake. the sauce was OK but I would use heay cream instead of milk for a higher fat content so its creamy. So dissapointed with this one

Delicious! But the amount of the vanilla sauce that this recipe makes is alot more than it needs. You could cut the sauce recipe in half and be good to go.

I used some of the suggestions of others on this and it came out great. I used more raisins (although I didn't like them all that much in this recipe) and walnuts and vanilla like recommended. I really didn't know what to expect as I never had or made bread pudding. It wasn't pudding like, but was very very good. My husband loved it, and I recommend buttered pecan ice cream served on top of some of this heated up.

This was the very first time my dessert was completely wiped out at the Saturday Night card game!  It's been requested that I make it again and again.  After reading the reviews, I found a different recipe for the vanilla sauce, but other than that, I didn't change a thing. Thanks, Meshel!

I made this last week and found it too soggy and sweet.  It tasted good though!

This is an excellent variation on bread pudding.  I even made a mistake and added too much margarine and it was still good.  The sauce added a nice touch, but I agree that it was thin, and for some reason, mine was not smooth.  I will certainly make this again.  Loved it, and it got a thumbs up from my husband, too.

I only used the vanilla sauce part of this recipe.  My husband had baked our apple pie so long it became dry so I thought this sauce would be perfect for it.  After following the recipe I found the sauce a little runny and not as creamy as I wanted so I added some half and half and cornstarch to thicken it and it turned out perfectly. Everyone loved the dry apple pie as a result.

My husband and I loved this dessert.  He in particular liked the sauce.  I found it very easy to make.  I don't make bread puddings very much but I will make this again.  Thanks.

I made this as my husband's birthday cake this year, he's talked about the bread pudding his Mom used to make when he was a kid, he said this one was "every bit as good as Mom's" (high praise, indeed!!)  We had friends over to share the celebration and they loved it too!!

Very good.  Added raspberries for some of the apples, which added a neat flavour.  Did not make the vanilla sauce; it was not needed.  This is quite a mushy bread pudding, not a firm one.  Only problem was it didn't make enough!

This was the first Bread Pudding recipe I have tried, and it was excellent. I did not make the vanilla sauce, I used a dollop of whipped cream instead. I was concerned there was not enough liquid, and i wasn't sure what kind of apples, however it turned out great. I used Pink Lady apples.

This recipe is delicious! It is exactly like the bread pudding at a very popular and upscale Dallas restaurant. The only change I made was substituting walnuts for the rasins - just a personal preference.

Outstanding!  I loved the vanilla sauce.  I used a whole loaf of day old french bread and baked this in a 9x13 inch pan.  I left out the raisins since my son isn't crazy about them and only had to bake this about 35 minutes.  I went ahead and poured the vanilla sauce over the whole pan rather than each serving and it was devoured all in one day.  Even the left overs were delicious.  This one is going into my "favorites" collection.  Thanks Meshel.

I haven't made the sauce, but this is really good.  I think if you use a bigger pan, it won't be as soggy.  Everyone loved it!  I followed that advice to heat up the raisins in butter;  it makes the raisins plumper and tastier.

This was an easy, inexpensive and quick desert to make. I served it at a desert party and I got rave reviews. I  added some extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe. Very good. It was my first time making and eating bread pudding. The vanilla sauce was not so great. It seperated and was very watery. My guests did not know what to do with it. Next time I will pour it on top before baking or I will just use ice cream to top it, or the Kulfi recipie from this site which has an awesome flavor.

I did not have all the ingredients for the bread pudding recipe so I decided to make sauce to go over blonde brownies. It was excellent! So rich and buttery. I cooked it in the microwave instead of on the stove and it was super easy. I decided to run out and buy some vanilla ice cream to serve it with. I will definitely make this sauce again!
