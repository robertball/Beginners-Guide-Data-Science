After reading other reviews I did some editing of my own and it came out just like the Starbuck's Lemon Cake! Very moist and delicious. 

Used the lemon version of buttermilk, 2 lemons worth of lemon juice, and added about a tablespoon of vanilla and lemon extract to the batter. 

Instead of using so much lemon juice in the glaze I used mostly milk and added just a squeeze of lemon.

I made this over the summer while in California for a church function and received such rave reviews!  I made it again for friends in New York who couldn't get enough - the cake was gone in minutes.  I made a few alterations in the glaze and in the amount of lemon juice I added to the cake mix itself.  Only based on the people I knew I was making it for.  In both instances it was marvelous!  I will say, however, when I used standard buttermilk it was good - when I used an alternate way of making buttermilk the cake was much better somehow... more lemony, moister, richer!  A great pot luck/church function/housewarming cake - you cannot go wrong!

Not very moist, not very lemony, and not very sweet.  I do however appreciate the fact that this is one of the only recipes for lemon cake on this site that doesn't require a friggin box mix!  With a little work, this could be pretty good, it is worth playing around with.

Taking other reviewers suggestions, I pumped up the lemon juice and zest. I used the zest of seven lemons and about a quarter cup of the juice. It came out great and was devoured at our Easter gathering.

I loved this recipe! I used the zest of 2 lemons and the juice from 1 lemon in the cake, and for the icing I used another whole lemon. I iced this almost immediatly after it came out of the oven, which made it extra moist! I found that 10 min. is just the right time to leave it in the pan before removing it, any longer half of it stuck in the bundt pan. Even better the next day!

This turned out very delicious.  It seemed a little dry to me the first day, but after I added the icing and let it sit, it was really nice and moist the second day.  It's not too sweet, so it's really good with coffee or tea.  I added the zest of one whole medium lemon and the fresh squeezed juice of one half of that lemon, because we like a stronger citrus taste.  I even added a little more juice to the icing.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I added an equivalent amount of sour cream.  It turned out fine.  This is definitely a keeper.
I just had to add to this review, because I just made it a second time, but made it orange flavored.  I used orange flavored yogurt instead of buttermilk, added a tad more sugar, used fresh orange zest and orange juice in the cake and the glaze.  It turned out wonderful!

I made this cake yesterday and it was fantastic! My wonderful in-laws came to visit so I decided to make this for them. They really loved it! I did use 3 lemons saving about 1 1/2 TBL for the glaze. And I used the zest of about 2 of those lemons and it was perfect. I had to print out a copy for my mother-in-law! This is a keeper!

This recipe has become a Christmas morning tradition in my household and will be for years. I would suggest using twice the amount of lemon juice and zest. I would also suggest to use real lemons and butter.  I've made it both ways and it is just not worth eating if you use the fake stuff.

Followed some of the suggestions, used more lemon and butter and it still came out bland, heavy and dry.  Added an extra T of zest to batter.  Glaze was the only redeeming feature of this recipe!

This recipe was fantastic.  Moist and full of lemony flavor. I did zest 2 lemons and 1 lemon for the juice as one review stated.  I also added the juice of 1/2 lemon to the glaze.  Everyone raved over this pound cake including our church group and all of my grandchildren who are 9 and 4 year old twins.

I personally had a few problems with the cake.  The next day it was somewhat dry and the glaze didnt have a potent lemon flavor.  I added a little lemon flavoring to the glaze and it was great.  Maybe it was just me, I dont know.  But all in all it was great, especially hot.

My Family loves Lemon Cake.  Made this one for Easter and it looked wonderful but it was way too dry and 10 family members did not care for it because of that.  Have no idea why all the raves on it - or what I could have done wrong.  The only thing I did was to add more lemon zest and juice as recommended.  Guess I'll have to keep looking for that special Lemon Cake. junie

Light lemon flavor.  I halved the recipe, used a round, 2-quart casserole dish and madea  guess at the lemon.  I used the juice and zest of one lemon and a little bit of extra lemon flavor for the topping.  The top was a little bit crispy because it was not baked in the correct pan, but the cake was delightfully light and fluffy surprisingly, especially considering the fact that most pound cakes are dense.  Nice texture and flavor.

This was amazing! It was so light and fluffy yet it held its shape really well. The only change i made was i used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice in the cake and 3 in the glaze because i like my lemon...I gave half the cake to my neighbour and i thought she was going to fall off her chair when she tasted it!!!

Will absolutely make this again!!!!!! Thankyou!

Tried this last weekend. Added more lemon zest than it called for and it tasted ok. Will probably make it again. Will not use the glaze next time..too sweet.

This pound cake was a disappointment! This cake has no flavor whatsoever. Using lemon juice in the recipe, in my opinion, did absolutely nothing. I couldn't taste the lemon in the cake at all. I'll keep searching for a better lemon pound cake recipe.

This pound cake is moist and delicious but I think it needs more lemon flavor.  I will definitely make this again, just with a lot more lemon zest.  By the way, this is great as strawberry shortcake.  The lemon really adds an extra dimension to the desert.

Since I was out of butter, I used margarine, and the cake still had a very rich texture and flavor.  I used an additional 1/2 T. of lemon juice in the batter, and it was just right.  The lemon flavor was subtle, but definitely lemony.  I was a bit concerned about the glaze - the taste of the glaze alone wasn't that great, but when it was part of the cake was a good addition.  Very quick to make.

I made this Thanksgiving night while we were all sitting around. The aroma was heavenly and before the cake was cool and the icing set, there was only one slice left.  Will definitely make again!

I don't know if I did something wrong, which I don't believe I did. Just want to possibly give it a chance, but this cake was not good. It was not lemony at all and not sweet enough. It tasted like good cornbread with lemon icing if that's possible. I cooked it as one of the many deserts I had for Christmas, it was the last to go and no one took any home :(

Very good cake!  I loved it.  I would add even another star for durability.  I tried to make it in our new bread machine, but after it mixed it all up and baked, the end of the cycle left it raw.  So I had to transfer it (upside down) into another loaf pan and bake it for another 15 minutes in the oven.  Unluckily, I didn't grease the second pan well enough so the top of the cake stuck to the bottom of the pan and came off.  Even after all that, it was very good.  :&)

Really tender and moist cake. Would definitely make again! Several members in my family are allergic to dairy/eggs, so...I used only 3/4 c. of Earth Balance, instead of a full cup. (Earth Balance is a non-hydrogenated "margarine" that can be used in place of butter. I also made my own buttermilk by adding lemon juice to some soya milk. I used 1 Tbs. of ground flax seeds blended with 8 Tbs. of water, in place of the eggs. Omitted the glaze, (non-glaze people) but added a bit more lemon juice & zest to the cake. We love lemon. Not the healthiest cake in the world, but worth every single calorie! Yum...

I used extra lemon zest, about 2 tbsp total. My friends and I were pretty happy with the results. The glaze was the best, tangy and not too sweet.

This recipe was super easy to make. Lemony but an overpowering taste. Add a little extra lemon juice (fresh of course) for an extra bit of lemon flavor. Great with Vanilla Ice Cream.

Very good! I took another reviewer's suggestion and included an extra 2 Tbs. each of butter and lemon juice. It came out a great texture, though still fairly subtle on the lemon flavor. Since I put ganache icing on it, the only bites that really tasted lemony were from the "inside" part w/ no icing. It would probably help to add more zest to the batter as well. All in all though, I am pleased and will be hanging on to this recipe!

Like other reviewers, I prefer my cake to be more lemony - hence I use a total of 2 lemons. I also add in poppy seeds and a lot more lemon zest. Excellent recipe - heaps of compliments received!

This cake does take a little extra effort to make but it's worth it. Very tangy and tasty, firm texture and makes a pretty presentation. I highly recommend this one.

This recipe turned out very well. it was very moist and had a good thick texture.
I doubled the amount of icing though, and that was a big mistake - it was way too lemony.
I would definitely make this again.

This was wonderful!  It took me a while to grate lemon, etc, but SOOOO worth it.  I shared 1/2 with Mom and may not tell her the next time I make one:-)  Kids love it and, even hubby, who isn't a lemon lover thought it was yummy and moist.

Very tasty.  I substituted orange zest and juice for the lemon and skipped the icing and it was fantastic.  I am sure the icing would have been great but my group tends to prefer non-iced products.

This was a very good cake. It was even better the second day because the glaze had a chance to absorb. My 10 yr old thought the crust was a little firm but by the next day the entire cake was moist and even more delicious. I sent half the cake into  work with my husband--he only works with 5 others and the cake disappeared within hours! Fabulous recipe--will make again.

This is a very good cake, but as written didn't have enough lemon flavor for me.  I increased the amount of lemon juice in the cake and also added some lemon extract.  That made it perfect.

I read what others said and added more lemon.  I used a heaping TBS of zest and 3 TBS fresh lemon juice and a tsp lemon extract and it still wasn't enough.  I used more zest in the glaze and that helped, but only with the pieces that have it really on there.  I will make again, but will add a lot more lemon juice to it in the future.

I altered this recipe a little. I used brown sugar and wheat flour in addition to the white stuff. Although I used more lemon than the recipe called for it still wasn't "lemony" enough for me. I was also able to taste too much of the flour. This was probably due to my baking rather than the recipe. Overall, it's a nice cake.

This was a good recipe, I replaced the lemon zest and juice with orange zest and juice. Used a little more zest and juice than it called for. Would make this again. Overall it was very good.

This was good, but not lemony enough for me.  I'm going to make this again and add some lemon extract to the cake for extra flavor.  The icing is great--has lots of lemon zip to it.  I made 2 9X5 loaves and gave one to my brother-in-law (who loves lemon pound cake) and got high reviews from him.  Give it a try, but add the lemon extract!

This was good cake, although not 5 stars good. I used extra lemon peel, even so there wasn't a lot of "lemony" flavor. I was afraid adding much additional lemon juice could affect the recipe badly, so maybe next time I will try some lemon extract. The texture of the cake was not the fine, dense crumb I associate with the perfect pound cake either, more just your basic butter cake. It was a good "at home" dessert, but as is, I think I would have been disappointed serving it to guests or taking it somewhere. I'm going to try the rest of the cake tomorrow with sliced, sugared strawberries. It will be a very good foundation for berries, way better than store bought pound cake or sponge cake.

Excellent pound cake. I did add more lemon. I ended up using the juice of a whole lemon(about half for the cake and half for the glaze). I will have to make another soon.

This was a delicious cake. A definite "do again"!
Not too much lemon, very moist and dense. My husband loved. Next time I will have to make two.
