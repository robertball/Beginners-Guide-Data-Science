My husband said this was one of the best things I've ever made! Warning though, it makes a LOT. I was only cooking for the 2 of us, and using half the filling made a ton. I recommend this with Oriental Dipping Sauce from this site. YUM!

These are fabulous. I had so many compliments. People were surprised that I had made them, and that they tasted like a restraunts dumplings. I had a few as regular dumplings like the recipe calls for, but I premade these for later in the evening. After boiling them, I put them on a cookie sheet lined with reynolds non stick foil and popped them in the fridge. When we were about 15 minutes from dinner being served I put a tsp of sesame oil in a  non stick frying pan and cooked them about a minute or so on each side. This warmed them up and voila instant potsticker. The other thing I did that made this so easy was to use a small bag of coleslaw mix instead of messing with so much grating. This also had the purple cabbage bits in it and made it very colorful. I did also add a bit more soy sauce and a little dribble of balsamic vinegar. Then just let it all steam until soggy. Beware this makes a ton. I used a package of wrappers that had 60 in it and still had a heaping cereal bowl of filling. People went nuts for them though and nothing was left after about an hour, as some came back for seconds and thirds. I will definately be making this again.

These were awesome!!! One thing I noticed was, you should wait till the water is boiling to drop the dumplings in, so they take a solid shape and don't fall apart. Make sure you seal the wonton wrapper, otherwise it takes on too much water, falls apart, and becomes flavorless. We added fresh minced ginger and garlic, and they were irresistible!

Awesome and surprisingly easy!  Sure they took a little time to assemble, but the 5 minute cooking time makes up for the assembly time!  I did think that the filling was a little bland, I might use 1/2 ground pork next time or add some extra seasoning.  I also thought the actual wonton paper tasted bland so I will salt the water when cooking next time.  Despite these personal changes I would make, I will definitely add this recipe to my regular rotation for meals!

Add shredded ginger and minced garlic.  Could add heat of some sort too.  Wait till water boils to put dumplings in.  Could try frying in pan after boiling just until turning into pot-stickers!

Good recipe.  Not hard to make, but wrapping the dumplings is labor and time intensive, so plan for it.  My roommate and I also fried about half of them.  That didn't turn out as well as boiling them; the fried ones were a bit bland and the wrappers were chewy.

AWESOME...my husband's fav.  My only change:  fry instead of boil in about 1 inch of olive oil -- come out crispy and yummy in just a few minutes. Tips for perfect wontons:  Use mixture of water and soy sauce to moisten the wrappers before fillings -- the tops stick together better. I also make a teriyaki sauce, submitted by LINDSXLT4X4, to dip these in.  "A great homemade teriyaki for this dish is 1 T. cornstarch, 1 T. cold water, 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. cider vingar, 1 clove minced garlic, a dash each of ground ginger and ground black pepper (according to taste). Simmer all together, stirring regularly til thickened."  I'm telling you -- AWESOME!

MUST TRY this way....u can be the master....
1. Double the cabbage, mix with some salt, stand for 10 min. squeeze dry.
this make your filling not too watery, and tastier. 
2. Serve with shredded ginger soak with black vinegar. 
3. Use 1 potion flour and 0.4 potion water to make dumpling skin. (knee until combine,look bit dry,don't add any more water, wrap with plastic, stand for 1 hour, the dough will come soft and moist enough.) This is traditional North China style (Shanghai, Beijing) dumpling skin.

Boil these, then pan fry in a tiny bit of oil until sticking slightly to pan (thus - pot stickers!).

Simple and soooooo delicious.  I added some garlic to the mixture just for extra flavor.  Did everything exactly and they came out great.  You have to spend a little time putting the dumplings together, but this is very easy to do.  Thanks for the recipe.  This will be done often at my house. =)

I made this twice- one batch without any changes, the second with a lot of changes- and both times I didn't care for it.  If I could give this recipe 1/2 star I would.  I have eaten a lot of dumplings in my life, and this recipe tasted nothing like any dumpling of any Asian culture I have ever had. 
In my second batch my modifications included adding ginger, garlic, more onion and onion powder.  I added spices of all sorts, testing one dumpling at a time to see if my new mixture of spices improved the taste.  Though my attempts to alter this for the better did greatly improve upon this recipe, the dumplings still tasted bland and unappetizing. The next night I made dumplings using a different recipe from another website and it actually tasted delicious. 
I was gravelly disappointed with this recipe, to say the least.

WOW! Taste like restaurant yumcha. I would suggest to use green onions. This gives the recipe an authentic oriental taste. I tried boiling and frying, both ways are delicious.  About 500 grams ground beef will make 80 plus dumplings - that's if you fill it with 1 teaspoon(not heaping)per dumpling. Teaspoon size filling is good because wonton wrapping cooks so fast. If you put too much filling you will end up with burnt wonton, uncooked filling.If you are frying it, the temperature should not be too hot or the wonton wrapping will brown too quickly or burn.You can also freeze this recipe.I used glad wrap in between layers to prevent dumplings from sticking.No need to thaw out if using it frozen.Just make sure your water is boiling before dropping the dumplings.If frying your dumplings, your cooking oil temperature should be similar to frying an egg.This recipe is a keeper!

These are amazing! I used ground turkey, added red cabbage and some minced green onion. I boiled them, then pan fry them a bit. I made the with the Oriental Dipping Sauce here. I could not stop eating these. I made like 1/2 of the recipe and used almost a whole pkg of wonton wrappers (12 oz). I will definitely be making these again!

I thought this recipe was not very traditional at first, since dumplings are typically made with pork and shrimp, but these were a hit!  The most requested dumpling from my non-Asian friends, these make great pot-stickers.  This recipe makes at least 125 dumplings, so scale back if needed.  I like to make them with round dumpling skins, not the thin, square wonton type skins, and freeze them on a plate.  When ready to cook, just take them out of the freezer and put them directly into a pan with about a tablespoon of oil and 3/4 to one cup of water.  Cover and cook on med-high until water is mostly evaporated, then remove lid and fry on both sides until nice and crispy.

Made these with a pound of gound beef and a half pound of ground pork.  Used shredded cabbage and carrot coleslaw mix and added grated fresh ginger.  Served with a sesame-soy dipping sauce, and my family loved them.  Next time I'll add some minced garlic to the filling.  They are time-consuming to make but not hard at all.  This one's going into the keeper file.  Thanks for the recipe!
UPDATE:  I made again with garlic added and subbed toasted sesame oil for the vegetable oil.  Yummy!  These are really good.

I have been making this recipe for many years and it  is easily adaptable to personal tastes and "stuff" you have on hand. Sometimes I boil them but mostly I fry them in a little oil and then pour in 1/3 cup chicken broth, cover and let steam until the broth is gone. I have always called them pot stickers except they don't stick because I use a nonstick pan.

made these tonight with only a few minor modifications.  used ground turkey instead of beef, added a little mince garlic and mince ginger to the mixture.  boiled them till they were done then made pot stickers out of them.... they were extremely good.. a little time consuming to make and a little frustrating when it came to "shredding" the cabbage lol.  but it was very well worth it in the end.. served it with the oriental dipping sauce from another reviewers suggestion and it was so good.. i wont ever have to go to an over priced chinese restaurant to get my dumpling fix again.

Oh my gosh! I was so proud of myself after making these!   I had never bought wonton wrappers before and had to ask a friend where to find them. They were in the cooler section of produce.   I followed the recipe exactly. I may try this with some spicy pork next time. I had about 30% left over filling, so I just froze it for next time I want to make these. Labor intensive on the prep, but worth the finished product.   You really need a dipping sauce with this - I just whipped up some soy, sesame oil, and hoisen sauce to dip and that worked great.   I prepped the dumplings and made the mistake of stacking them all on a plate before being ready to boil them. Some got stuck together. I had the same sticky problem when I boiled them and put them on a platter to serve, some stuck together. I would add just a little oil to them upon removing from being boiled so they won't stick. When prepping I just need to make sure they are only in one layer so they don't stick together.   I see others fried them in oil after cooking and I agree that seems like it would be a tasty alternative.

These were very good and hubby and friends loved them.  This does make a lot so I freezed the ones we didn't eat, when we were ready to make I just took them out frozen and deep fried them in the fryer till they were deep golden brown.  They were still very good.  Recipes like this are my favortie it's so easy to change them up.  Thanks for the post.

I can't get enough of these! I don't eat red meat so I substituted ground turkey for the beef. I also added teriyaki sauce to meat mixture after letting it marinate. I seasoned the water with a very generous amount of salt, onion powder, soy & teriyaki sauce to make a dumpling soup.  It took everything to keep me from eating the whole pot to myself! I must say, I forgot to add the egg so my dumplings fell a part a bit so hopefully when I remake these, the egg doesn't affect the taste.

I thought the filling was a little bland so I for sure had to have some sort of dip with the dumplings.  Everyone was very impressed to see hand made dumplings so I will for sure be making these again.  Although it was time consuming.  If you really like doing everything from scratch try the Wonton Wrapper Recipe here on allrecipes.  I used it for these dumplings and I would definitely use it again.

I had to adjust the seasoning a bit and I used 1 lb of beef and one package coleslaw mix. It made 3 dozen with leftover filling. I cooked them potsticker style, fry 1 dozen at a time on one side only in peanut oil till brown, add 1/2 cup water and immediately cover till water evaporates. Amazing! I found a Korean BBQ sauce that I diluted for a dipping sauce. The party guests went crazy for them!

tasty, but it really took forever to put them together and many of them fell apart during boiling.  There must be a trick.  We saved half and will fry them later in the week.   I added fresh ginger and garlic.  The taste was very nice.

This is a truly excellent and tasty recipe.  The dumplings are a little work intensive to put together, but since they only take about 5 minutes to cook, the prep time doesn't matter.  I boiled my dumplings the first time I made them, and now that I have a steamer, I steam them, not being a fan of fried dumplings.  I did take a few short cuts with the recipe.  Instead of the carrot, onion and Chinese cabbage, I used a slaw mix that had broccoli shoots in it, that saved a significant amount of prep time!

Easy once you get the hang of wrapping them, using egg whites at the ends helps hold it together. Used cole slaw shredded mix to cut the time in half and low sodium soy sauce.

I don't know the English way of spelling it, but in Ukrainian, we call these Vereniki, and I just love them. I also make them with cottage cheese smothered in sour cream, or fried cabbage and tossed in fried onions, served as a main meal. Just happened to have the ingredients for this version and highly recommend it. Its a good recipe to make for children that don't like vegetables.

These were fantastic.  I only used 1 lb of ground beef and used shredded cole slaw mix.  The kids had a blast helping me make them too. I sauteed them in batches in a tiny bit of sesame seed oil after boiling. I can't wait to reheat my leftovers the same way, I'm sure they'll taste just as good.

This is a  very good recipe. I did a mixture of pork and beef and then followed the recipe exactly.  The next time, I would add scallions instead of onion and sesame oil instead of vegetable oil like others suggested.  I tried boiling them a few at a time and it was watery and the wonton fell apart. I also tried steaming them and it was much better and the wonton stayed together and had better texture.  I will make these again for sure.

Wow!  This recipe turned out really yummy!  I did make a few changes:  2 tsp chopped garlic to the meat mixture.  I mixed the ingredients together several hours prior to cooking and placed in the refrigerator to "marinate".  I also added salt and chicken buillon cubes to the boiling water to add flavor.  My husband could not stop talking about how good these dumplings turned out!  Thank you for this recipe!

Takes a while to make the dumplings, but they are def worth the time and effort! I made a few "test" dumplings exactly as the receipe states with the exception I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and green oinions instead of regular onion. The dumplings were a little too bland for my taste so I added some garlic powder and a couple tablespoons of oyster sauce. My picky-eating husband LOVED them! I took the rest to a pot luck lunch at work and the entire staff loved them.  Many requests for the receipe! Also, used the Teriyaki Dipping Sauce receipe another reviewer suggested, highly recommend it!

These were all right.  I thought they were way too much work for the quality of product.  I didn't like the way they came out of the water - unless one was going to use them in soup perhaps.  I fried them and they were fine but...

Absolutley delicious!! I had some trouble getting them to hold together in the water, so I instead heated some oil in a pan and fried them like pot stickers. Not the healthy version but between myself, my husband, and my three year old we ate the whole batch. Great with oriental dipping sauce.

Very good recipe. My family loved them! Wrapping the dumplings does take some time so plan accordingly. We formed an "assembly line" The kids love to help out in the kitchen so they enjoyed wrapping the dumplings. Prepared them just as the recipe states and served w/ soy sauce. Delicious!

I cannot give this 5*s b/c I wasn't able to make it as is. I'm not able to eat cabbage so I made them with sweet potato as a substitute. I must say they are delicious! I steamed them for 10mins, but next time I'll bake them. B/c there were so many (aprox. 40-45 dumplings) I steamed enough for two and froze the rest to make later. My favorite kind of recipe!

This is hardly an accurate review of this recipe. I had been given a recipe for Chicken Dumplings by an Oriental woman that I used to work with. She quoted the recipe from memory and spoke broken English so I assumed it was this reason that my dumlings were not as tasty as hers. I used parts of this recipe to to recreate her yummy dumplings. I substituted 1lb of ground chicken for 1.5lbs beef, 4-5 chopped green onions for regular onion, and sesame oil for vegetable oil. She always fried her dumplings but never said that she boiled them, so I tried boiling them first, then frying them over a medium low heat. I found that when you boiled them in a sauce pan, you had to stir until the water boiled again or a few would stick to the bottom, and if you fry the boiled dumplings on too high a heat, they stick. In the end I came to the conclusion that if you want to fry the dumplings, boiling isn't necessary. My co-workers dumplings are still the best, but these were pretty good

I made this with ground chicken, pre-packaged "Angel Hair" slaw, and omitted the egg.  I also replaced the wonton wrappers with gyoza wrappers (egg free) and deep fried them.  I couldn't cook them fast enough for my family.  My child who has an egg allergy was able to enjoy them as well with my modifications.  This does make a lot of filling and there are a lot of wrappers per pack, so we have enough to make another batch to freeze or steam, but the deep fried version, albeit not so healthy, were super tasty!

My fussy 9 y/o daughter LOVES to make and this recipe.  It is so easy, but makes A LOT.  I found the filling freezes nicely too.  The only thing I changed was, I used ground chicken instead of beef, (just because it's what I had) it was still very yummy!

Yum! I halved the beef, cabbage, carrot and onion, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same (accidentally).  Turned out with a good amount of seasoning (but maybe a bit too much oil - my fault since I was supposed to half it).  I should have made the whole batch, there were no leftovers except two measly dumplings for lunch the next day!! I tried to pan fry a few right after boiling, but that didn't work so well.  I'll probably need to boil ahead, chill, and then pan fry before serving.  I served them with "Oriental Dipping Sauce" and "Quick Chinese Style Vermicelli," both from this site, on the side. I also added a few drops of hot sauce to spicen up the filling, may do more next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are much better fried. Instead of boiling them we fried each side in olive oil and they were much better.

I, too, added ginger to mine.  I also omitted the cabbage (not a fan) and used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I used the Wonton Wrappers recipe and will serve with the Oriental Dipping Sauce. Very delicious...they'll become a regular item around here!

Best beef dumplings ever. Perfect seasoning. I don't like cabbage, so I  replaced cabbage with 0.5 bunch of cilantro and put all vegetables in food processor. I also made quick wrappers with all purpose flour 250g, cold water 150mL, and salt 1tsp to go with this recipe. Thank you very much. Quick, easy, and delicious.

You should substitute beef with pork for a more authentic flavor, or with ground seitan or TVP for a vegan version. (If going vegan also use 1 TBSP ground flax seed and 3 TBSP water in lieu of the egg.) Meatless or not, you want to add ginger to this filling. And to cook, heat some oil in a frying pan and lay the dumplings in the pan. Give them a cupla minutes to brown then add about a cup of water or broth to the pan and cover. Let the dumplings steam until the wrappers look ready. Mmmmm I'm getting so hungry just thinking about them....

Haven't tried these yet... Just a question for anyone... do you cook the meat first?  5 minutes of boiling doesn't sound long enough to cook beef.

My partner and I love this recipe and I make it all the time.  As a cook who likes to experiment with different tastes and textures, I added about a cup of diced water chestnuts (for texture and added crunch) and roughly 1.5 cups of rough minced shiitake mushrooms.  Made it for some friends who were visiting and they begged me for the recipe.  Goes great with the Gyoza Sauce recipe on here.

I have to admit, I am very happy with how these came out!!  My family and I couldn't eat faster if we tried! They are a lot of work but you get in a routine and you are done in no time and it is well worth it!! I scaled it down a bit with just 1 lb. of ground beef, 2 cups of rainbow slaw (so I didn't have to shred), and used green onions instead of regular.  I did leave the amount of seasoning the same and it was soooo GOOD!!   You have to try this!!

Yummy yum yum. The only down side is that it takes longer to put together than it does to eat. ;-)

WOW! These were amazing! I used chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I also scaled it down (using only 1 lb of chicken) and it still made a ton of dumplings. But, I'm glad to have the leftovers. These truly are worth your efforts. It does take some time to make each dumpling, but the time you spend making them you get back with the short cooking time. Just excellent...thanks for the recipe.

Delicious flavor all around.  I made it exactly as written and it turned out great.  One thing that wasn't clear is the size of the wrapper used.  We used wanton wrappers which are smaller than egg roll wrappers...LOTS of work, but good.  I tried boiling and just got a mess, we ended up steaming them which is more traditional.

I used ground pork instead of beef and it was really nice! My family doesn't like the texture of steamed duplings so I pan fried it. The wontons came up crispy and perfectly cooked! I love these little bundles!!

This recipe was good and easy to make....time consuming but simple.  I do agree with the other reviews and this recipe does need just a little bit more flavor & doing a half pork half beef just might do the trick.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Used ground pork instead of beef...were good but the next patch I make I will add little more of certain things for more flavour.
