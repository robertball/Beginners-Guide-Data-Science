I haven't tried this recipe yet - sounds very good.  I was a little confused whether to use fresh cranberries?  It just seemed to me that they needed to be cooked first?  Please let me know if anyone has tried the recipe.  Thanks so much!

The best.  This seems like work, but it makes a ton of cranberry sauce and it makes lots of nice little packets for the freezer.  What a treat to pull one out to supplement a meal outside of the holiday season!!  I will make this again and again.

Excellent cranberry salad. Switched to this recipe a few years back from the cranberry fluff. Easy to make,keeps well. Make sure you use 16 ounces of cranberries. Most store packages are 12 ounce now.I also cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

Thee Best ever Cranberry sauce, sweet and tart in every bite! I also have the Vita-mix blender which works faster and so much better then my food processor for things like this.

This is so yummy!! I took it to Thansgiving dinner and everyone raved about it. Then I took it to a Christmas party two weeks later and it was still good!! The nuts in it make it! I ground everything up in my mini food processer it make a huge difference.

This had an interesting flavor to it, but my family didn't really care for it. It tasted good, don't get me wrong. Thanks for the opportunity to try this one out.

This recipe was excellent. I used dried cranberries and pre cut pecans from Trader Joes, very easy and delicious. The orange really makes it.

I have made this recipe every year since my kids were babies. They are almost grown and I’ve only improved on it to make it my own blend. Thank you to the OP for this recipe— I’ve made many memories and many friends with this recipe.

Sugar NOT needed. With no sugar, a couple more tablespoons of pineapple juice, using only one-half of the orange rind AND placing it in the warm jello mixture to better blend that flavor before adding it to the cranberry, we love it! It's just my skepticism to not use the entire orange rind. I may increase it next time.

This was not a favorite around here.   The texture wasn't as smooth as we'd like and it was more bitter than we'd like.   I made as directed.

Family favorite.  Anyone and everyone that tastes this asks for the recipe.  Can't be beat!  I use Splenda in place of the sugar so it's not such a guilty treat, works great.  Celery is optional - good either way.
