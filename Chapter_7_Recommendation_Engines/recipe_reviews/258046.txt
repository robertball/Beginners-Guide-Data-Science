This recipe couldn't be more simple! I used 1 red bell pepper in place of the tomatoes. Just a personal preference. I did marinate my chicken for a few hours adding the veggies in for about the last 30 minutes to give it a little more flavor.  Instead of cooking on a skewer, I cooked the chicken in a grill basket as another reviewer had done and cooked my veggies in a grill skillet. Once done, I tossed it all together. The Jasmine rice was delicious and perfect for a mom on the go!

I tweaked this one just a bit. Rather than basting the kabobs with the sauce, I marinated the chicken pieces in the sauce for about 3 hours before threading onto the skewers with the veggies. I also added some mushrooms to the skewers, which was a nice addition.  These go great with the Uncle Ben's Jasmine rice - which is so quick and easy to use. Would be great for a weeknight dinner! Will make again!

The skewers were delicious.  Apparently I bought the wrong type of rice for this recipe but needless to say the rice was very good.

For a great summer meal, put your favorite meats and veggies on a stick and grill them, then serve on a bed of perfectly cooked rice. Our pop-in guests loved it, too!!

Great recipe! My family loved it and so easy to prepare. Uncle Ben's rice cooks in only 90 seconds with a  great flavor and consistency. I added to the recipe a red pepper that needed to be used, sprinkled some cilantro and squeezed some fresh lemon on the top.

We loved this recipe. I made enough marinade to marinade the chicken and serve some of it heated up on the side. My hubby said he could eat this at least once a week. I added some red chili's to the marinade and cilantro to spice it up a little bit. This is keeper and perfect for those hot summer days or when you want something quick and easy. Plus it's a great way to use up extra veggies.

I'm not a fan of putting all the items (chicken and veggies) on one skewer. since they cook at different times. Especially the tomatoes. They take maybe 1-2 minutes. I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for an hour. Then used  fresh teriyaki sauce to baste the veggies while grilling. I used tri- color peppers, a sweet onion and skewers of fresh pineapple. For the rice I subbed Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice, sauteed onions and used chicken broth instead of water. A great recipe, especially in the summer, when you want to keep you house cool!

Delicious!  I didn't have zucchini, so subbed with baby sweet peppers.  I did marinate the chicken, onions and peppers in half the sauce for about 4 hours, then used the rest of the sauce for brushing while the skewers grilled.  This was simple and quick to cook, and the Jasmine rice was the perfect accompaniment.  Great meal!!

It’s quick and easy and absolutely delicious.   If you are pressed for time and want a great meal, try this recipe.  I love these 90 minute rice packets that make meals so fast and easy.  This was a hit in our house.  I’ll be making this often.

Oh yah, this is quick and easy and doesn't need to be marinated so it comes together very quickly especially when served with the Uncle Ben's Jasmine Rice in the Microwavable pouch!  Great flavors and easy to prepare make this an easy mid-week summer time meal!

I would have given this 4 stars,  but my husband loved it and wanted me to give it a 5.  So there it is.  I only marinated the chicken for about an hour before grilling it, and I still thought it could have used a little more flavor.  The rice was perfect with this dish, and I would absolutely tell you to try that rice!  Thanks, Uncle Ben!

Very yummy! I, too, marinated the chicken for several hours, then tossed the chicken and marinade in a bowl with the cut veggies (added mushrooms) to coat everything. Rather than skewering, I grilled in a grill basket, stirring once or twice. The kabob mixture was great served with Uncle Ben's Jasmine Ready Rice and the meal couldn't have been easier to get on the table quickly! If When I make this again, I will reserve a little bit of the marinade (or make a little extra) to drizzle over the top when done, just to add a little more liquid. Very good overall!
