I just finished making this dish and wow, it was great.  I was worried that it would be a little bland but once the sauce simmered down it was just right.  We're garlic lovers in our family so I added one more clove,I also added 1/2 a chopped green pepper.  I cut back on the butter and used 3/4 cup 10% cream and 3/4 cup milk to cut back the fat content of the recipe.  It was still great and the sauce was thick enough.  I think next time I might add a little parmesan or mozzerella cheese to it just before taking the sauce off the stove.

Excellent recipe!!  The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 cup lite sour cream and 1/2 cup half and half for the 1 1/2 heavy cream.  The sour cream adds a little zip and the combo is healthier.  I also used fresh basil and parsley, which I had on hand.  Fantastic!

This was wonderful!  My husband had a funny look when he saw what I was making for dinner, but after trying it he wants it again!  He's even going to take the recipe to work at the firestation for the guys to try!  I was trying to use up what I had on hand, so I had a few substitutions.  Instead of fresh mushrooms I used canned, used penne pasta in place of fettucine, and plain evaporated milk for the cream.  It was still wonderful.  I can only imagine if I had actually used fresh mushrooms and real cream!

Wonderful!! I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk, used a garden style spaghetti sauce (with mushrooms and green peppers) and 1 1/2 tsp of oregano, parsely and basil.  I also spinkled mozerella cheese over each bowl. We loved this! Next time, the recipe will be doubled and in addition to the ham, I will add some cooked, cubed chicken, some shrimp and perhaps even some sun-dried tomatoes.  THANKS Chris and Carolyn!

This is a hearty sauce and a great way to use leftover ham.  In my non-stick sauce pot, I saute the ham (2 cups diced)first to render a lot of the fat then I drain off most of the fat and saute the onions and garlic.  Then I use 2 cups of Pasta sauce, 1 cup half-n half and 1 cup skim milk.  Just these modifications alone will cut your calories almost in half.

We had company when I made this and they and I thought it was good, but too spicy. My husband, who loves spicy foods thought it was great. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll use just 1/4 ts. of crushed red pepper instead of a whole one. We cut the mushrooms smallish, which seemed to work nicely. I used leftover ham instead of deli slices and kind of julienned it but smaller and the pieces was too big. The ham and mushrooms really need to diced or they don't work well with the pasta. I also put diced tomatoes on top of the sauce after everything was dished up. 

Overall, great dish. Fairly easy to make, a little longer prep and cooking time than what is listed. I will definitely be making this again, just with less crushed red pepper.

This is the first ham recipe that I've found that doesn't taste like an excuse to use up leftovers.  It is fabulous.  Some of my guests have found it too spicy, but that's how my family loves it.  The flavors are so unique together.  This favorite freezes very well!

YUMMY!  YUMMY!  This was great!  It was not a heavy sauce at all, which surprised me!  My husband loved it! As a side dish, we had brushetta!  Next time I want to experiment and add shrimp or scallops!  This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe! Reduced the mushrooms in half and added a lot more ham. We were using a smoked ham that friends gave us for Christmas and it gave it a nice flavor. Also, since this reminded me of a pancetta sauce, I decided to add a splash of vodka. Wow! That was a great addition. I didn't think it was too spicy but those were the first words that my husband said. One hour later, I tasted it again, and this time around I thought it was too spicy. I had added additional red pepper flakes. Will make again but next time I will keep the red pepper at the amount indicated and reduced the herbs just a tad.

1. Ignore the recommendations of the reviews that make substitutions for the sake of putting their stamp on the recipe; this one is perfect the way it is.  Why tamper with perfect?  This is restaurant quality stuff.  2. The only exception to rule one is to reduce the red pepper flakes if you don't care for spicy hot.  As "hot" recipes go, this one isn't all that spicy hot; just enough for an interesting little kick.  3. I used 3/4 pound of ham and cut it too thin.  Cut the ham thick enough so you can sink your teeth into it a little.  If not, you don't have the sense that ham is even in the dish.  Bravo!  This one is a winner.

This was good, a different way to use leftover ham.  I dont like mushrooms, but used this b/c it was a different way to use ham.  If you like mushrooms i think you'd love this as is.  I used half and half b/c it was what I had on hand and it thickened nicely.  I actually doubled the sauce b/c 2 cups (and then 1/3 reduced) just didnt seem like much sauce (with no mushrooms).  Doubling the sauce made enough for 1 1/2 lbs of pasta in my opinion.   A trick that I learned from Rachel Ray (go figure): Instead of scooping the sauce over the noodles as you serve it, put the noodles in with the sauce and mix and turn it for a few minutes to allow the noodles to absorb some of the sauce.  I've been doing this for all the pasta dishes I've been making lately and it is a great tip.  (And this is a strange color as other reviewers have noted, but it's supposed to be, it's a rose sauce.)

Delicious! I subbed evaporated milk for cream and thickened with 1/2c mozzarella cheese. I also diced the mushrooms and added 1/4c of green pepper since I had it on hand. Great balance of flavors with a dash of heat. Loved it!

I made this pasta dish last night and my picky husband said it was "okay" but the fact he went back for thirds told me otherwise lol. I used prosciutto instead of ham, left out the pepper flakes due to the fact my husband doesn't like spice and used a bottled sauce with peppers, onions and sausage that I had sitting in my pantry. The dish turned out delish, the only thing I would have changed was to reduce the amount of butter (it made it a little too buttery).

As another reviewer stated, this was a party in my mouth!

I had to sub light sour cream for the heavy cream as that was all I had.  Also halved the herbs and left out the red pepper, otherwise my elderly mother would not have eaten it.  I can only imagine how good it would have been if I made exactly as written.

I don't normally like cream sauces, but this was fabulous, thank you for the recipe...I will definitely be making this again.  Definitely restaurant quality flavour.

As an FYI, I just heated up some leftover (2 days later), and it wasn't as flavourful as when fresh made.  I will know for next time to make only what I need for those actually showing up for dinner...I can't wait to make this again...loved it!!

This was a quick, easy & delicious dish! I didn't have the ingredients to make the sauce, so used a creamy, rosa sauce from the jar. Instead of mushrooms I diced up red bell peppers. Also used penne pasta instead of fettucinni, though I'm sure it'd be good with any kind of pasta! Since I wanted a more sweet than spicy flavor, I omitted the red pepper flakes & added more basil. At the end I topped it with mozzarella cheese & fresh, thin slices of red apple. Gave it a great crunch & added flavor!

This was really good. I kinda forgot that I didn't really like mushrooms that much so I'll definitely omit that next time. Instead of using heavy cream I just mixed 2 % evaporated milk with cornstarch and I swear to you it tastes exactly the same. I'm not like a health food nut or anything but I just wanted to try something different. Totally worth it! It's a really good sauce so you could probaly sub the ham with different types of meats. I'm going to try shrimp next. I also used one green pepper and used half the amount of seasoning called for. And oh yea, this recipes is definitely missing something... Parmesan Cheese! It really added a lot of flavor.

This was very creamy and had good flavor. I did use spaghetti and canned mushrooms, also used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half. I used just a tad of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Yummy ♥

Used veggie ham slices and coconut milk. Also, I served the sauce with rotis instead of pasta. Inspite of all this, it was well liked. Thanks.

YUM! And so easy! Use 2 tbsp butter and a splash of red wine to cut the fat and add a little tang. I also used 1 c. fat free sour cream mixed with 1 c. cream. This is a keeper! I will definitely be making this again!

This was good, whole family liked it.  I forgot to add the crushed red pepper (I noticed this halfway through eating, so the spice that it was lacking was due to my error).  Its nice to do something different with a leftover ham.  Will make again.

I LOVE this recipe.  I changed just a couple of things.  I use chunks/cubes of ham, rather than slices (husband's request); and I stir in bowties or penne pasta rather than putting sauce over fettucine.  This was more for my 3 year old than anything, but I found it's really convenient to take as lunch to work with it mixed in. I also used more butter (a whole stick) and pre-minced garlic.  Thanks for the great new addition to dinnertime!

I just wanted a good rose sauce. This was excellent!. I didn't used the mushrooms or ham but this would be delish as well. I used half whipping cream, 1/4 coffee ceam and 1/4 1% milk. May try to cut down on the whipping cream some more next time, doubled recipe but only put in half the ground caynne pepper. Wan't spicey at all. Will make this again.

I made this a year or so ago and loved it but it got buried in my recipe box. I am so glad I rediscovered it! This is an easy meal to prepare when you are craving a rich, indulgent pasta dish.

Great easy recipe.  I did add green pepper, used fresh basil and fettuccine.  I did add the optional crushed red pepper along with lots of ground black pepper.  A little concerned that it appeared to be quite watery, but gave it an extra long simmer and it turned out perfect.

I like the flavor even though I had to make some substitution to the recipe since I found the recipe last minute and didn't want to run to the grocery store.   So instead of the mushrooms and the heavy whipping cream I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and added a little water with it.   If this altered version tastes good I can only imagine what the real thing tastes like.

Used Linguini instead of fettucini and everyone loved it.  Used one pound of shaved deli ham (since I didn't know what '6 slices' meant, and ground it up in the food processor.  pleased with the result, but will add more mushrooms next time.

Yum!  Made this on a whim to try to pull together dinner.  Really, really good.  Here are the substitutions I made...I used baby bella mushrooms, doubled the garlic ('cause we love it!), substituted the cream for evaporated milk to cut back on fat and calories.  It didn't specify what type of ham use so I had some nice deli ham in the freezer and sliced it up thin using an 8 ounce package.  Good, Good, Good!!!!  Used whole wheat spaghetti and served with whole multigrain garlic bread and parm. cheese.  Oh...almost forgot...I read the reviews and did add 1/4 cup of light sour cream.  It added a little zing!  I chose to add the red pepper flakes and my boys raved!

I followed this recipe except for the following.  Added peas for color, cut the parsley, basil, and oregano to 1.5 tsp and used Prosciutto instead of ham, only because I didn't have any ham.   This dish as a hit with the whole family.  Quick, easy and delish!  Who could ask for anything more for a nice Sunday dinner that makes everyone feel like you spent hours making it!  :)

I never thought of making "ham spaghetti" this was delicious and what a life saver since our fridge was running low. I had to leave out the mushrooms because I didn't have any and instead of whipping cream I used milk and extra butter. I also substituted angel hair pasta for fettuccine. I used a bit more spaghetti sauce and added green bell peppers.  Topped with mozzarella and Parmesan before serving! I also recommend adding the optional crushed red peppers, enjoy!!!

Delicious pasta. I used sour cream instead of the whipping cream. Next time I might try chicken instead of ham.

This recipe, leaving out the tomato and using chicken instead of ham, is something I make regularly but the tomato sauce and ham are not something that would have ever crossed my mind so I'm glad I came across this. It is yummy and will be a regular at our house in the future.

This is now my favourite pasta dish! (Thanks!!) Great for using up leftover ham. I like lighter rose sauce so I don't use *quite* as much tomato sauce as it calls for. Mmmmm.....

I'm sure this would have been fabulous with the heavy cream, but I opted for fat free half and half.  My only complaint was that I really couldn't taste the ham in this.  If I make this again, I'll definitely use Italian sausage instead.

I love this recipe as written!  I've made it several times.  I've tried it using half and half instead of cream, as many have suggested, and to us, it is just not nearly as good!  With most recipes, I can't tell the difference, but the heavy cream is needed here in our opinion.

Very good, quick and easy to make, but in my opinion the red pepper needs to be eliminated or cut back. It makes the dish far too spicy, to the point of overpowering. I also thought that a full one pound of fettucine was too much. The standard 12-oz that you usually find in the stores is a better balance for the amount of sauce.

I am revising my original rating of this recipe.  I gave it 3 stars the first time, and I followed the directions perfectly. The quantity of spices is too much!  They were overwhelming!  I re-made it last week, and with the changes I made, changed my rating to 5 stars.  Here's what I did differently: I only used a half teaspoon of the oregano and basil.  I used fresh parsley, so keep the measure the same. I purchase Fanestil Party Ham that the butcher sliced thin for me, and I coarsely chopped it.  I only used 1 cup cream.  It was SO good!  My company thought it tasted just like a dish served at a local Italian restaurant here in town.

This recipe is amazing! Very fast to make, and it tastes really good. Next time I'll use a bit less mushrooms, but overall, the rosee sauce is amazing and I used Linguini instead of fettuccini. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful!  I followed the suggestion to substitute milk for the cream and cut the crushed red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  It reminds me of a restaurant-quality entree.

My husband wants me to make this every week!  My changes are, I use a shallot instead of garlic for richer flavor and I use ham steak instead of slices.  And this recipe is quick and easy.  The only downside is all that cream CANNOT be good for you!

This was really great! At first I thought a pound of mushrooms would be way too much, but they really do cook down quite a bit. I ended up adding a little bit of cornstarch as I like a thicker sauce. It says it serves 4, but I only got three servings out of the sauce; however, there was leftover fettuccini so I suppose we were just really hungry. I'm definitely more of a baker than a cook; my boyfriend thought it was a hit so anyone can make this!

Delicious. Husband said "It looks like a restaurant meal." Yea! My only substitution was for the heavy (whipping) cream: I used 1 cup of light cream (10%) and 1/2 cup of homo milk. It tasted fine but I'm sure with the heavy cream it would have been pushed to decadent! Also, remember the red pepper flakes are *optional* - I don't think you can complain about the heat if you add the entire amount; 1 tsp. is a lot, so use sparingly if you want to add it. Thanks for the recipe!

A few people have said to half the spices but I think maybe they are using "ground" basil and oregano instead of flakes. Using the dried flakes the seasoning is right on- I love, love, love this recipe!

This was delicious. I halfed the recipe and just sprinkled the red pepper into the sauce. (I didn't have crushed so I just used ground.) It tasted great, despite my fears of mixing spaghetti sauce and ham. This is worth making for company. Oh, and I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles instead, and it turned out great. :)

Great recipe with a few modifications. Cut the oregano, basil, and parsley in half. Add the red pepper to taste... approximately 1/2 tsp. for us. Also used fresh fettucine. Will definitely make this one again.

This was interesting.  I'm glad I read the other reviews first because I cut the spices back by 1/2 and the crushed red pepper to 1/4 tsp.  Seemed to taste fine with those amounts.  Anymore would have been way too spicy.  It's hard to gauge 6 slices of ham since they come in all different sizes.  A more exact amount would have been helpful.  I took another reviewer's suggestion of saving time by chopping the ham in the food processor.  Made the job go quickly but the ham had the consistency of a hash, which I don't think worked well with the recipe.  Also, I took another reviewer's suggestion of using 1/2 and 1/2.  Since I already had the heavy cream, I used half of each, and it tasted fine.  This recipe makes A LOT so I would suggest cutting it in half for a family of four.  Not sure if I'll make it again.

Wonderful recipe!  Along with the ham, I added some prosciutto and some bacon.  For those who do not like "kick", I would definitely cut back the amount of crushed red pepper flakes...the 1 tsp goes a long way...but it is SO VERY GOOD!

This was very good, although I think I may have used the wrong kind of red pepper, because it was pretty spicy.  I think I will just leave that out next time, unless I want to clear my sinuses.  ;)  Otherwise, delicious!

I have made this several times with rave reviews.  I use half and half instead of cream and it's still delicious.  This is definately a winner.

My boys loved this, my husband said it was ok,  I didnt care for it, but i dont like ham that much.  I thought it did have a strong ham taste, but i did like the creaminess of it.  We probably wont make this again.

This had wonderful flavor. It was, however, a bit on the salty side. I'll choose a different ham next time. I only had 1/2 of the mushrooms it called for and I used half&half instead of cream. Turned out great!

Great recipe! I love it as is it but to jazz it up a bit I added a few capers and 1/4 cup of parm cheese near the end of cooking time. The cheese thickened the sauce to just the right consistancy. Also, added a couple extra cloves of garlic(garlic lovers here). I do recommend using 1/2 the amount of crusehd peppers if you aren't to crazy for spicy foods. Overall, the recipe is still great the way it is. Thank you for sharing... a definate keeper!!

This recipe is AWESOME.  I always use penne pasta as it is similar to a pasta dish I always order at a restaurant.  Not quite the same but I would probably rate this one higher.  Have made it 6 times already.  Family just inhales this pasta dish.  The combination of cream and marinara sauce is an awesome taste and is immensely enhanced by the hot pepper and ham.  I will definitely be making this over and over again - if I don't my family will complain!  Will try it with shrimp as another viewer suggested.  GREAT RECIPE - THANK YOU.

This is a very good recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly and then at the end decided to add a package of imitation crab meat and some N'ORLEANS CAJUN seasoning.  Everyone loved it.  I will be making again and again.  Thanks!

Another recipe my husband found and made for me when we were dating.  It's great!  The only thing we changed is to use a lot less butter.  it's a very rich recipe, so if you serve anything with it, I'd stick to a nice cool salad.

MMMM, so yummy!!  I was looking for a recipe to use up a bunch of ham from Thanksgiving and this one fit the bill!  I did cut this recipe in half & added some diced yellow peppers along with the mushrooms, sauteed in a bit of canola oil.  To cut back on calories and fat, used about 1/4 cup of 5% half and half and 1/2 cup of 1% milk.  Did use a bit more pasta sauce than called for and didn't have dried parsley, so omitted (basil and oregano were great)!  Used the amnt of red pepper flakes called for and didn't find it too spicy at all...nice flavour, would probably use more next time.  Served over fresh linguine, a repeat recipe!!

Oh so good! I mixed the leftover sauce with the pasta and it was even better the next day!   Here are the changes I made: used more onion, closer to 1 cup instead of ½. I substituted fresh basil and used about 4 times the required amount. I used a can of inexpensive Hunts spaghetti sauce and froze the rest so it’ll be handy the next time I make this recipe!  I used a pre-packaged Farmer John ham steak which made for plenty of meat and a good smoky flavor. I wanted larger mushroom chunks so I cut each one into thirds. Finally, I used small shells instead of linguine.  The recipe made plenty and two of us hardly put a dent into the sauce.  My only problem is that it took forever for the sauce to cook down. We finally ended up eating it before it had reduced to 2/3. Even though the sauce was a bit thin, it was delicious and I plan to make it again. The only thing I’ll do different is add more red pepper flakes since I like it spicier!

This is a great recipe!  I cut large chunks of Black Forest Ham and served it with thin spegetti pasta. I used just one large clove of garlic.  Served hot pepper flakes and sour cream on the side. My family loves it!  This is dish good with Ceasar salad and toasted garlic bread.  It's a keeper.

I made this today with my boyfriend and it turned out great!  We substituted half of the cream for milk because I'm too health conscious (but we didn't skimp on butter...I suppose it's a give or take situation)  Instead of using spaghetti sauce, we winged it and skinned about 8-10 Italian tomatoes for the sauce, though I think it would have been better if we had pureed it before putting it in with the veggies (we put it in before the cream so that the tomatoes could settle and mash up a bit)  I think next time I'll try it with just milk, less butter and probably a cup of wine and see what happens (because just the thought of all that butter and cream...yikes)

Very tasty and easy to make. I had purchased sliced mushrooms, so it saved on time. I like spicy food, so this was just perfect. If you don't like food to be too spicy, I would add less crushed pepper.

I actually only used the sauce part of this recipe, and used it on gnocchi, which was great! I reduced the mushrooms to 1/2 pound. It made about two servings. I couldn't find an easy recipe for rose sauce so I tried this and it turned out wonderfully.

Another left over ham meal from Thanksgiving dinner. It was very different than the boring spaghetti sauce. The heavy cream made it very rich. Nice to try a different meal.

Upped this recipe for 6 people and it made enough for 10!  
It was very good - but could have used more kick.  We like a bit of spice and this didn't have it.
Was very good the second day (if not better) when heated up in the oven.
The third day in the microwave should have just been thrown away.
Overall, I would make this again, but add a few spices to kick it up a notch and make WAY less.

I only had deli sliced chicken on hand and it turned out great, the next time I made it i used cubed ham (came in small cubes in a package at the store).  My boyfriend is requesting that I make it again - and I chop the mushrooms really small because he doesn't like mushrooms.  Good recipe.   Thanks!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes from this site. The whole family loves it! I don't like ham and I will make a ham just for the leftover ham to use in this recipe!! I sometimes use angel hair pasta or just plain spaghetti if I am out of the fettucini. I usually make a little extra sauce because it tastes so good to dip the french bread into.

This recipe is soooo good.  Never thought ham would be that great in this but with the crushed red pepper in the sauce, it makes it taste like tasso!  Wouldn't change a thing.

I'm sorry, usually I like recipes like this but this was not a winner for us...  Everything tasted fine until we added the heavy cream, which really dominated the taste.  The fettucine was hard, the sauce too creamy and not enough spaghetti sauce.  I originally thought how I would do it different next time and then the more I thought about it, the more I decided there would be no next time.  Sorry.

Wow what a crowd pleaser.  I made this for a party of 25ppl.  I would like to add that I made a few slight changes to fit my families taste buds,  I used green onion instead of white and I cut down the amount of garlic to about 3/4 the called amount.  I forgot the crushed red pepper but I am sure it would be the perfect touch next time I make this I will add it but only 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper as some of the family can not handle spicy foods,  I used ham from the holidays that was frozen I simply cubed it.

I joined AllRecipes specifically so I could rate and review this recipe.  I used 1/4 t. of red pepper flakes because the marinara I have is pretty spicy and I used fresh Italian Parsley instead of dried.  All I can say is WOW!  Fantastic flavor!  Can't wait to share this with family and friends!  Thank you Chris and Carolyn!

This one's a keeper.  I used regular milk-didn't have any cream on hand and it still came out good! Will make again especially to show off for dinner guests.  This one has gone into the AWESOME file of the recipie box!

This is a great meal served with fresh bread, and possibly a salad. This can be spiced up according to your taste. We have had this many times, and it never goes to waste. Very simple to make. Definately recommended.

I found this recipe when looking for something to do with left over ham. My family is SO happy I found this one!
This is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! My family loved it, including our 2 year old. This is definatly categorized as a family favorite!I made everyone that walked in my house try it and it received rave review by every one of them!
I only had 1 cup of heavy cream so substituted the balance with whole milk and it worked perfectly.
Thanks SO much Chris and Carolyn for sharing this recipe.

This was a real quick recipe, but I didn't really like it.  It was edible, but I won't be making it again.  I tossed the leftovers.  It has too much spice or a spice that just doesn't sit right.

OMG... WOW!!!! Super delicious recipe. Great way to use up leftover ham. I followed the recipe as written except that I found I needed to add salt to the sauce - could be that my ham wasn't as salty as most. My husband said this recipe is "definitely a keeper!"

Very tasty! I modified the recipe based on some previous reviews (I substituted half & half and a bit of sour cream for the heavy cream), and I used prosciutto since that's what I had on hand.  I also reduced the butter by 1/4 and added a tbsp of olive oil.  It was creamy, delicious and not overly rich. I will definitely make this again!

Per what I had on hand, I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and fresh basil rather than dried. Used less crushed red pepper only because of the others who might not like spicy. I personally would have loved to add the full amount. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  I couldn't wait until it thickened and simmered down because we were hungry and it looked so good, but you know what... it didn't matter.... it was still delicious!  The only change I made was I added a little Parmesan cheese to the sauce.  The ham I chose to use was a smoked ham from the deli that I had cut thick, it had a peppered outside and added a nice depth of flavor.  Very good dish.  I used different pasta and not fettuccine because of my preference.

This was very good! Was skeptical about ham in a tomato based sauce, but totally worked. Did not have cream so used milk and thickened at end with a little cornstarch and water.

Everyone ate this meal but no one was impressed.  I triple checked and made sure I followed the recipe and didn't miss ingredients.  This just didn't turn out anywhere near what we expected.  The leftovers were better than the orignal serving at dinner.

Oh my, what a sumptuously sinful dish this was!  Great for when you want to completely annihilate any semblance of whatever diet you may be on.  Used portobello mushrooms and egg noodles, both of which went perfectly, and I didn't really measure, just threw it together with whatever proportions looked right.  I'm already planning to make this for the significant other, it'll knock his socks off, not to mention guarantee that he'll be mine forever.  Oh yeah, this dish is really that tasty.  Forget the diet and try it tonight.. You know you want to.

I had all the ingredients on hand, and substituted half & half for heavy cream, which still lent a satisfying "creaminess" to the dish.  The red pepper flakes are an awesome touch, but be careful with it!  My husband was absolutely delighted with the meal.  It's refreshingly different, and delights the taste buds - Kay

This was very good, but my husband and I both were turned off by the rose color of the sauce.  I will make again, but will leave out the speggetti sauce.

I made this for the second time tonight and we just love it.  I follow the recipe exactly except I had fresh flat leaf parsley so I chopped that and added it and it really added to the eye appeal.  The only prepared ingredient is the red sauce and if you use a high quality one, you can't go wrong!  I used Classico Tomato and Basil because it has less sodium than many jarred sauces and it is delicious.  I agree with the reviewer who opined that you need to use dried oregano and basil leaves or flakes, not the powdered version.  I do not really know what six slices of ham means but I just use a lot of ham and eyeball it.  I cut it into 1/4 to 1/2 inch chunks.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

WOW!  This was great!  My whole family loved it.  I used leftover ham and followed the recipe as is.  If you have leftovers they are just as good as the 1st.  Will definetly make this again.

Yum...it was DELICIOUS!  I used leftover hickory smoked ham and it was similar to vodka sauce.  YUM! Hubby looked up wide eyed and said that I'll have to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really great! Gourmet Restaurant taste, but easy to make. My husband doesn't like me to try new recipies, but even he thought this was great! I made linguine instead of fettuccini, but followed the sauce exactly.

Holy COW this was good!!! For absolutely SURE I will make this again! Husband and 14 year old daughter agree! I really like spicy food, BUT next time will 1/2 the crushed red pepper. I was out of fresh garlic (again) so dumped (honestly I rarely measure) some garlic powder. I used half and half instead of cream, and served it with grated romano cheese. THANK YOU SO MUCH for this recipie. OH, and I should add that my husband is Italian .... and he had seconds!

Thanks for this wonderful yummy recipe! I desperately needed something to do with my baked ham leftovers from Easter and this fit the bill perfectly! The only changes I made was to make the sauce a little less fattening by using half and half and skim milk as another reviewer suggested. I also added about 1/4 cup of Pecorino Romano cheese to the sauce! We loved it and it saved good leftovers from being thrown out!

I really didn't know about this recipe with the whipping cream and spaghetti sauce.  The reviews were what talked me into it.  Wow!  This was WONDERFUL, a true keeper.  I didn't make any changes except I like to cut my mushrooms in quarters/eighths for looks/texture.  This is just comfort food that you will crave.  I certainly did, eating it cold in the middle of the night.  Big yum!

I loved this.  My kids thought it was ok.  You need to love mushrooms.  Next time I think I will make a little more of the sauce.  Once I added the noodles it took away from it somewhat because there were too many noodles for that amount of sauce which took away from the overall impact of the delicious sauce!  I wanted to lick the saucepan clean of the yummy sauce!

I really enjoyed this dish.  It was simple & tasty.  I gave it 4 stars only because my husband thought there was too many "grassy green spices" in it. I will reduce oregano, parsley, etc. by half next time.  Very good though!

I almost skipped over this recipe because the name rose sauce made me think of the flour....this is delicious and really very easy.  It is a terrific way to make plain old pasta great...made me feel like we went out to eat rather than our plain old dinners.  My husband really loves this and we will be making this again.  I did cut back alittle on the crushed red pepper flakes...that was the only change I made.

WOW! If I could rate this higher I would! I've made it for my supper club, and my family on numerous occassions and we're always fighting over the dish to scrape out the last bits!
I use Bertolli's Tomato & Basil, or I think the Classico brand too. Awesome recipe!

I was very impressed with this recipe.Instead of using store bought spaghetti sauce I used "Marinara Sauce 1" that I found in this site(another winner in my opinion).The next time my parents are in town I'll make this for them but I'll have to reduce the crushed red pepper or cut it out all together.For myself though I thought it had just the right amount of heat.For ham I used some leftover ham that I had and cut it into small diced sized pieces,about a cup I think.With the amount of fat in this recipe it's not something I'd want to make too often but it's hard to resist.

I made this using leftover ham from Easter.  I made the dish according to recipe and it turned out fabulous.  I was a little leery of using spaghetti sauce, but it was yummy!  Red pepper flakes made it spicy, but that's the way we like it!  If you're not too into spicy, you'll want to cut back on them.  A GREAT way to use up those leftovers!!

This recipe is definately a keeper.  I took the advise of some of the other comments and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  It was excellent.  My 3 year old even ate this.  Thank you for the recipe.

A very different pasta recipe. The crushed red pepper made it a bit spicy for my husband and daughter but all in all we really enjoyed it.

This is a great recipe and very easy.  I leave out the red pepper because it's a little spicy for my taste.  I also leave out the mushrooms.  Don't feel like you have to use chunks of ham.  Since I don't bake hams very often, I've used deli sliced sandwich ham several times and it's just as good.  This is also excellent with bow tie pasta.

The perfect sauce. Very creamy. Substituted chicken for ham and left the oregano out. Very easy to make and delicious.

Oh my goodness!  I was so surprised by the flavor in this meal.  When I saw the recipe I thought it would be decent, but it was better than any rose sauce I have ever had in a restaurant.  I served this with toasted Italian bread with a garlic and herb olive oil spread.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

WOW!  Yummy!!  I used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream, and it was still fabulous.  I also had to use canned mushrooms instead of fresh, but the flavor was still excellent.  This one is a winner!

I have been making this for months now because it is so delicious.  I have made this for family, friends and boyfriend. Everyone loved it except for my mom and my boyfriend's mom whom can't seem to tolerate any heat in their food.  So if you dislike hot food, just omit the red pepper flakes, otherwise make as directed and enjoy.  I even tried it with chicken instead of ham, but it just wasn't the same, the ham is a necessity. It is one of my favourite pasta dishes. Thanks so much for sharing!

I am not a big cook, but my fiance and I absolutely loved this. I substituted proscuitto for the ham and used portabello mushrooms, and it was a restaurant quality meal. Served with a nice gorgonzola bread, it was wonderful.

Wow this was great!  I used fat free half and half and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I also added a lot more veggies- julienned red and green pepper and some yellow squash.  My husband was impressed!

Wasn't as excited with the taste as I figured I would be.  Not all that dissapointed though, it is still a pretty good way to use up leftover ham.

It was good, but too much seasoning for my family. Not sure if I liked the cross of a Marinara and a cream sauce.

I was looking for recipes to use up ham from Easter when I decided to give this a try. It sounded a little different but I thought I would try it. We loved it! The ham and pepper give it just the right touch.

Served this to three families (with children) and it was a hit!  Delicious and easier than I thought it would be to make.  Will change ham to bacon next time - and there will be a next time.

Doubled the recipe and made as written except for the cream as I only had one cup.  The spice flavor was good with the mushrooms and ham.  Put the leftovers in the freezer.

I had a ham steak in the fridge so I used it in this recipe.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I used half-and-half instead and it worked great.  Other than that, I didn't change anything and it turned out delicious!

Only reason why I did not give a 5 is because I altered the recipe per others suggestions - half the amount of oregano, basil and parsley (can not imagine with the listed amount - ugh).  Delicious!!!!!

I was very surprised by how great this recipe tasted - my Italian wife agreed.  It is a serious keeper, basically a carbonara disk, and the small amount of spaghetti sauce was perfect.  Any left over ham, this is the dish.

We really liked this recipe!!  I followed everything except I took the advice of another and used 1/2 cup light sour cream and 1/2 cup fat free half & half.  I let it cook a little longer so the herbs got really soft and the rose sauce thickened a little more!  Picky son put the sauce on his bread like bruchetta...Winner!!

This was really really good.  I hate to make changes to recipes and post, but I always double the garlic in all recipes, and found we did not have linguine, so I had to use farfalle, which was fine.  I don't often have ham, but it was leftover from Christmas dinner, and I could not have thought of a better use for it.  I would buy ham just to make this.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

WOW! This recipe is really amazing. I was looking for a way to use up the leftover Christmas ham and this was perfect. I used canned mushrooms and evaporated milk because that's what I had on hand. Put this over some snowman shaped pasta that was a gift LOL and it was perfect. Man, can't wait to do this again!

My boyfriend absolutely loved it. his son who is 6 said he loved it too, but he might of just been being just like dad.  I thought it was alright... They just ranted and raved though. I am putting this is for future reference if i ever make it again which i'm sure i will.  I think it was just too acidic for me. I know i could always add baking soda to neutralize it in the future

This was actually better than it sounded. The SO loved it. Didn't even recognize the "Thanksgiving Ham" when he was eating it. Was sure it was bacon! Nevertheless, we both declared it delicious. Simple to put together. Creamy, smoky and filling. So glad to have found this recipe.

The flavor of ham was too overpowering for me.  My husband liked it, but said it would be even better made with chicken.  That still didn't stop him from getting 3 servings and covering them with parmesan.

This was a great pasta recipe.  I think you could come up with many different flavors depending on what kind of spaghetti sauce you use.  (I used meat flavored Ragu).  I used leftover Easter ham for this and was a great way to use it!  The red pepper flakes gave it just the right amount of kick and the leftovers were just as yummy!!!  Thank you for a recipe that I will make over and over again!!!

Wanted something different for left over ham and this was it!  Huge pasta and mushroom lover so it couldn't have been better.  I cooked the fettuccine 14 minutes and added 1 tsp Sambal chili paste to kick it up.

I've been looking for a rose sauce recipe similiar to that of Strapazza chain restaurant.  This one works well.  I omitted the ham and added crisply steamed brocolli pieces.  I prefer penne with this dish.

We really enjoyed this.  Substituted fat free half and half for the cream and only used about a tablespoon of butter.  We also used thin spaghetti instead of fettuccini.  Delicious!

Another "do-over" recipe. This was so easy but looks and tastes excellent.Both my daughters love it(no easy task),the vegetarian just takes out the cubed ham.

We will keep this recipe, but we both felt that something was missing.  For some reason, I thought I was tasting a clam (maybe I didn't cook the shrooms enough?) and picky boyfriend thought it needed something (he suggested proscutto rather than sliced ham).  I will probably use either bacon or pancetta next time.  Otherwise, this was incredibly easy to make, and I had everything on hand!  Thanks!  :)

This recipe was good but I felt it was missing something although I can't quite decide what at this time.  My husband really disliked it but he is not a huge fan of rose sauces.  I may try it again on a night where hubby will not be home but I will have to think on what spices/herbs to add to really bring the flavors out.

This was absolutely wonderful! I used Proscitto rather than plain ham and it added a great flavor to the sauce. Also, I used less red pepper as my wife does not like spicy food. I will definately make this again.

Great recipe! The taste was very good and the red peppers gave it "zing". If you don't like "hot" than cut back on the red peppers. I used cubed ham instead of the sliced ham. I will definately make this again!

5 stars on the night I made it - delicious and creamy.  1 star for the leftovers - for some reason it becomes really greasy, we could not eat the leftovers.  Next time I will cut the  recipe down to only make what we will eat that night.

This was an excellent recipe! I reduced the amount of red pepper flakes as suggested by other reviewers. I think I wound up using 3/4 of a tsp, and the sauce was hot without being overpowering. I actually also used fresh herbs (for the first time ever) with delicious results. The sauce reduced well (especially after cooling for a bit), which helped emphasize the flavors and gave the desired thickness. This is a great recipe!

I really liked the flavor combination in this dish, however the "rose" in the title is a bit of a misnomer.  Mine turned out sort of orange colored - looked kind of like beef stroganoff.  You couldn't even see the ham.  To me, a meal should look appetizing, and this meal was not pretty.  But tasted great!

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!!!!  I used half & half instead of the cream, mainly because I had it in the fridge and it was delicious.  I added a little fresh rosemary just because I love rosemary.  I served it on angel hair, just because I don't like thick pasta.  
Thanks for the recipe, it was GREAT!!!

This recipe was delicious!  Used mixed fresh mushrooms and proscuitto, and we both loved it.  I replaced the cream with half-and-half, and you never would have guessed.

We loved this recipe.  I had also found a simliar base recipe "Linguine with Mushrooms & Ham" on allrecipe.com.  We halved the forementioned recipe and added the 1/2 the marinara sauce and hot pepper flakes.  Both dishes are excellent - and it was great having 2 different sauces for dinner.

This was a great dish - it was surprising and loved by every critic in my house (including the in-laws!). I'll never think of leftover ham the same way again...

Great dish -- I would thicken up the sauce a bit for basting/serving, but otherwise wonderful flavor!  Very easy and quick cooking, too.

My first review but I just had to say it...this is a terrific dish!  The only substitution I made was to use farfalle instead of fettucini.  I did not feel the red pepper made it too spicy.  The cook time was about 30 minutes but this was my first time with this recipe (and I am NOT a gourmet) so perhaps it will go faster next time.  There will be MANY next times!

Made this last night with ham left from Easter dinner. Pretty much followed the recipe, except I did not use the same spaghetti sauce. It was fantastic! I will definitely make it again!

This was a great recipe..well worth the time. It was rich and filling but I recommend to either leave the red pepper flakes out or go half as much if you are making for youngsters. My 2yr old loves this dish!

I'm not exactly sure what happened with this recipe - it sounded so good but turned out bland.  I might have killed it by using gemelli pasta, which was just too much pasta, but in general the flavor was bland.  I was not sure if 6 slices ham was deli sliced ham or like a slice of a side of ham, and went with the deli sliced ham, and I did not taste it at all.  I'm sure I messed this up somewhere.  Plus the sauce never thickened for me, and I cooked it a long time!  Spicy, too.

I was pleasantly suprised, before reducing the sauce it was somewhat bland, but after reducing, amazing, perfect with the ham!
