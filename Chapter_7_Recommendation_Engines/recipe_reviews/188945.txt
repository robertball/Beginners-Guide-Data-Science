I found this easy and very tasty.  In fact, almost better the next day.  I will use it again.

Excellent flavor and you can even make it without the bacon and still good (but bacon makes everything better). Great over breaded porkchops.

I made my own sauce instead of using canned,  stewed tomatoes.  My sauce was garden fresh romas, red and yellow bell peppers,  sauteed onion w/garlic, fresh basil.  Blended,  then stewed.  
I used the gravy on veggie patties that were made from mushrooms.  I kept the bacon in the recipe.
