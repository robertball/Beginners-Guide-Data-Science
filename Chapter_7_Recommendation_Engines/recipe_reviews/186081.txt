I really liked this dressing. I'm trying to watch my calories so I didn't add 1/2 cup of oil as the recipe called for. I added 1/8 of a cup and it still tasted good to me. Don't skip the honey because that's what adds just a touch of sweetness to it.

Too much vinegar and Dijon as written.  Back off on the vinegar to a ratio of 3:1 oil to vinegar, reduce Dijon to 1-2 teaspoons, and use only about half as much honey and this is perfect.

Perfect!  Just what I was looking for.  This dressing has just the right balance of zip and sweet.  I love vinegar and didn't think it was too strong at all.  This dressing would go great on a variety of different salad ingredients.  I used a combo of baby spinach, tomatoes, carrots and cheddar cheese.  Delish!

I cut the recipe in half and used 2 Tbsp. of olive oil.  I added a little minced garlic and it was delicious!  I served this over mixed greens, cherry tomatoes and thin sliced red onion.

I chose to try this recipe because it was quick and simple and I was in a hurry. It tasted REALLY GOOD, but the vinegar was a bit overpowering. Maybe I'll put less in next time. For a quick and easy dressing, I really enjoyed it - thank you!

Perfect...but to make it even more perfect, try walnut or grapeseed oils. It will be much "lighter" in taste. Also, this works best if made in a mini food processor because it emulsifies that way. I used the "whipped" honey last time. It's very thick and adds a richness.

This was great but for a little texture, try adding a few poppy seeds!  I also heated the honey for easy mixing and kept it on the counter so it didn't thicken to a paste.

fast, easy, really yummy and a little different from the ordinary. I never buy the processed grocery store stuff anymore now that I have discovered how simple it is to make a great dressing at home, and how much better the fresh stuff is!

Balsamic was a little strong, felt like it overpowered everything else.  I like balsamic, so I didn't mind to much.  but might try to dilute it down a bit with more oil and honey.

Just made this for the first time and I think I've found a new favorite! I tossed it with baby mixed greens, feta and dried cranberries with sliced grilled chicken on top and it was very yummy. I was just making it for myself so I used 3 Tbs. EVOO to 1 Tbs. balsamic and it was perfect! Also added a little minced garlic because I love that in almost everything! Will never buy store bought again. Thanks for the recipe.

Used white balsamic vinegar (for appearance sake) and cut back a little on the olive oil.  Once whisked, the oil incorporates well with the other ingredients and does not separate into a layer.  Nice blend of sweet and sour.

This was pretty good - I added a clove of minced, fresh garlic.  Next time I might try adding minced onion as well.

This was an ok recipe. I made it as directed and thought it was touch to tart for my taste.  Added a little more honey to try to adjust the flavor.  Maybe more sitting time will help too.  The dressing does turn out quite dark becauce of the balsamic vinegar.  Maybe next time I'll try golden balsamic vinegar.

Best homemade dressing I've ever made! Perfect as is - no need for changes. Will use this over and over again. The boyfriend loved it too, and he is super picky about dressings, so that says a lot!

How yummy! Just the right balance of flavors. I did add 1 tsp of garlic powder for a little more zing. Such a refreshing change from my basic vinaigrette.

Way too much vinegar when made according to the recipe.  I had to redo it 3 times to get it to an edible level.  I won't be making this again.

One of my favorite dressing recipes.  I used the same ratio of oil to vinegar, but used 1/4 cup Balsamic, and completed the balance with red wine vinegar.  Add just the right amounts of S&P to taste, and it's fantastic!

Yum.  Light, tangy, and a good bit of sweet.  Added this to coleslaw with dried cranberries and slivered almonds.   Makes a tasty, nutrient filled go to side for the week.  I'll be making this again.

First of all, I scaled it down to half of the recipe. I just did not need that much for just myself. I followed the recipe and then, after trying the end product, decided to add 1 tsp of whole grain mustard and more  salt/pepper to my liking. Whole grain mysteries added a nice visual appeal and  a little kick to the whole recipe. At least in my opinion. I'm sure extra salt and pepper helped my addition. But even without any of my additional tweaking this recipe was great. Thank you!

This is an excellent salad dressing. I used less oil (equal parts oil and vinegar) because I prefer less oily, tangier dressings. I used blue agave instead of honey and it was the perfect balance of tangy and sweet.

Excellent as written! I didn't expect this to be as good as it was because of how few ingredients were involved, but it was really great! Very tangy, and was great on a romaine salad, and also as a dipping sauce for chicken.

Base for the recipe was good. Had to do some minor adjustments to make it more to my taste. As other reviewers did, I added minced garlic. I also added more honey, more balsamic vinegar, and used honey mustard as well as spicy mustard to give it more flavor. Final addition was about 2 tbs of red wine. It turned out amazing! Loved the base of the recipe but lots of adjustments to make it just right.

Great recipe but after reading several of the reviews, I tweeked it a bit!  I used 1/3 cup each of balsamic and olive oil; also didn't have dijon on hand so had to use spicy brown mustard: believe it or not, the dressing was a HUGE hit :)

Just made this for our dinner tonight. Really delicious just as it stands....for our flavour preferences though, I added 1/4 tsp of Herb de Provence. If I had anymore of Trader Joes "flower pepper" I would have used that. Also, added a small fresh garlic clove. Processed all in my mini food processor. Love it.

This recipe is good, make  that GREAT as is, and also with one, some or all of the variations of soy, lemon juice, basil, oregano, garlic, onion (chopped, minced, or powder).  I'm sure all the others mentioned would be equally delicious!  If you don't like the thick heavy consistency, use equal parts balsamic/cider vinegar.  Can measure right into bottle or jar and shake and serve/store!

We were out of salad dressing at my place so I made this recipe-amazing! Tangy and tart. I made a couple changes. I added 1 tsp lemon juice and 1/2 tsp lemon pepper...and I used canola oil instead of olive because it's a bit milder. It's a great recipe-definite make-again!

Simple, perfect as it is, but easily adjustable for preference. Mine tasted wonderful right after mixing, but now it's sitting in the fridge, and I can't wait to taste it in a few hours. :)

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  Thank you GumboGirl!   I've made it a number of times exactly as written and it's excellent.  Might try experimenting with some flavored oils and vinegar but this is my go-to.

Very nice 'vinegar/mustard' blend of flavors. The mustard doesn't overpower the flavor with heat. I used white vinaigrette because I was trying to duplicate something served in a restaurant.

Really good! I made a couple of changes for our tastes. Added 2 cloves of garlic and about 2 Tb of White Vinager (TJ's) from Modena to make 1 cup or 16 Tbs. of finished product. I found it exceptional.

Made this this morning, and put it over my spinach salad for lunch. Delicious!! My new GoTo salad dressing recipe. Wouldn't change a thing.

I've made this twice and followed the instructions both times.  It's wonderful.  I also might start hunting for a dijon mustard recipe, so that I'm not using prepared mustard - but it's excellent as is.   (I think I could drink it.)

Finally.... A really good dressing!  I cut back the balsamic to 1/4 cup and added 1 TSP of crushed garlic, as some other reviewers  recommended.  Couldn't be any easier to make.

I love vinegar, but this was too much vinegar. I had to add a little more oil and honey to balance it out. Btw, 2 Tablespoons is a serving in this recipe, so it only makes a cup.

Love it.  Have made it several times and sometimes I add less oil, or a bit of garlic, etc.  Just depends on my mood but it's a standard recipe every time.

Loved it as is, it is a bit on the sweet side but the bf likes that.  I add things as I have on hand like garlic, throw in basil or some feta- a very good base for those who like a sweeter dressing.  Use it all the time!

It was amazing. A nice dip for hard cooked eggs too.

This was very yummy! I cut the recipe in half since I was just making it for myself. I still added 1 tbsp of honey because my honey isn't that sweet. I'm glad I did, because it was just perfect!

I used all the ingredients as listed.  However, allow me to suggest to the reviewers that felt the vinegar was overpowering, do NOT use grocery store balsamic vinegar.  Use the aged balsamic.  It comes out thick, almost like a syrup.  It has a small hint of sweetness to it that is sumptuous.  The store brands are fine if you're cooking with it or what not but if the balsamic is going to be the star of the show, get the real stuff.  I thought the taste was fabulous.  I will admit though that living an hour from France gives me access to some amazing ingredients so not only did I use thick and sexy balsamic (which I could eat plain,) but I also used some wonderful dijon.  If you're going to go through the effort of making your own food, be a food snob when you need to and get the better ingredients.

I made this tonight it was great!!  I accidentally put even amounts (1/3 C) of vinegar and oil but i just went with it - very very good - I love the tanginess of the balsamic vinegar and the honey cuts it just enough without making it too sweet!  I added some dehydrated onions but that was the only change I made!!  Very good! Exactly what I was looking for!

A bit too much vinegar for me - I cut back to 1/4 cup, and it was still nice and tangy.  I would add either a clove of garlic or a little mince shallot to give it some bite.

This is good stuff! Rich and full bodied flavor. I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I added both onion and garlic powder to compensate. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Thanks -- this is a keeper!

Have been looking for a simple balsamic vinaiggrette recipe and this fits the bill. I used only 1 tbsp of the mustard since I keep a honey dijon mustard on hand.

4-1/2 * === Couldn't figureout how to do the 1/2.  I just made this, used plenty of salt and pepper, but also added a few drops of white wine vinegar to "cut" the heaviness  a bit.

I used this on red leaf lettuce topped with french fried onions and warm crumbled bacon. My kids ate about half the bowl before we even sat down to eat.

Delicious!  Served this on a chef salad.  Added a half tablespoon more honey than called for in the recipe and a bit of garlic powder.  Everyone loved it.

This dressing was sooo good! The kids helped me put it together which made the results that much more successful for us.  EASY, DELICIOUS and SATISFYING!  I had fresh herbs in my salad (basil)...I think this would be good with some fresh basil in the dressing.

great dressing and so easy to make. Used it on a salad of baby spinach, walnuts, feta cheese and craisins and it was delicious. All of my house mates have been using it since I made it :)

This is a salad dressing recipe that has become a staple in our house, It is simple to make, very tasty and goes well on a salad of greens with toasted pecans and dried cranberries. I have halved the recipe, but extra keeps well in the fridge as well. Thanks for the recipe!
