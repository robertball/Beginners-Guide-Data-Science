My grandmother just gave me this recipe and I absolutely love it. Her receipe uses prepackaged coleslaw mix, adds an extra 2 oz. package toasted slivered almonds, and beef flavored ramen. I've eaten this every night this week (I mix it all together right before eating). I make it with 1/2 torn up spinach leave and 1/2 slaw mix to make it a little healthier. Its really tasty with the spinach. However, if serving to guests I would probably skip the spinach b/c it doesn't look as pretty.

Very tasty salad.  Even my hubby likes it!  I add extras to this salad i.e. almonds, sesame seeds, mandarin oranges, chopped green onions and cilantro.  Pretty much anything goes.  To make this salad into a meal, stirfry some spicy marinaded beef or chicken and serve on top of the salad.

This was good, but will let sit overnight to see if flavors intensify.  Additions consisted of shredded carrots, a few slices of green pepper, a handful of almonds. toasted the almonds and ramen noodles before adding.

Yum!  I usually use a bag of cole slaw or broccoli slaw and change up the vinegar (cider, balsamic, red wine) for variety.

It needed some tweaking, but it was a good base (I already submitted to have a custom recipe made on it).  I made it double, so I used a whole head of cabbage and two packages of ramen noodles.  I recommend using the Oriental flavor because that matches right.  I then, instead of sunflower seeds, used sesame seeds (eyeballed it), used sliced almonds, and also added four chopped green onions.  For the dressing, as someone suggested, cut the oil in half, so I left it at a 1/2 cup, used about 5 Tbsp of sugar, and then used 4 tbsp of rice vinegar and 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar, along with the seasoning packets from the soup package.  It came out great and everyone loved it.  The thing I didn't do, which I need to do and will do, is add salt and pepper (especially pepper) to taste.  I needs that extra flavor and kick.  That was added to my customized recipe.

Great recipe.  I also add 1/2 cup dried cranberries to the recipe.  It makes it even yummier.

I liked this recipe for the versatility. I used the chicken ramen. Prepackaged 
chopped cabbage (purple and green with carrots)added green onion and celery and black pepper.I also used  2w types of olive oil mixed together. My husband wasn't too sure about the ramen but I was. I love the crunch. Pecans also work VERY well instead of sunflower seeds. Great as a summer MEAL!

Oh my!  This is fabulous!  I used both red & green cabbage, 2 sliced green bell peppers, 1/2 thinly sliced onion, 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 balsamic vinegar.  I didn't have sunflower seeds so I doubled the amount of almonds, which I had toasted. I brought this to a baby shower and it was the first thing to go and EVERYONE wants the recipe!  Thank you Tamera for a great recipe!

I bought a bag of already shredded cabbage but didn't know how much to use so I used the whole bag. I think I should have used less because there wasn't enough of the dressing.  Next time I'll double the dressing.  Otherwise it was very good!

I make something very similiar-- great with leftover chix (shr/chopped) or rotisserie chix-- also use toasted almonds and sesame seeds, but sunflower sounds good too-- mix of red and green cabbage adds visual appeal-- try rice wine vinegar in place of white vinegar. I've never tried it with the seasoning pkt- use a little sugar and white pepper in the dressing instead.  Great way to eat cabbage!!!

AWESOME!!!! We loved it...made just as directed (only doubled as it was for a potluck)..dh and I couldn't stop snacking on it!  Next time I will try the suggestion of having some spicy marinated chicken, using a spicy chicken ramen packet, almonds, and maybe mand. oranges.  yummmmm.  oh, and thought we might try olive oil instead of veg. oil.  YUM

I followed the recipe the first time and felt it only deserved 4 stars, as it was too oily for my family.  The second time I added 1 cup shredded carrots and used only 3 Tablespoon olive oil (instead of 1/2 cup vegetable oil) and it made all the difference in the world.  Next time I may try sesame oil and mandarine oranges.

My mom used to make this when I was a kid, and I was happy to find the recipe. I used a bag of chopped cabbage, and the recipe yielded enough to fill a large bowl. As others suggested, I decreased the oil. I kept the dressing separate from the salad (so it wouldn't get soggy) and ate on it throughout the week. Quick, easy, and yummy!

I really enjoyed this, but made some changes/additions because I thought the recipe as written might not have enough flavor.  Instead of the sunflower seeds, I used mandarin orange.  I used an equal ratio of oil, sugar, and cider vinegar plus I added about 1/2 tsp of the Oriental Seasoning from the ramen noodle packet.   Next time I make this recipe, I'll add green onion.  Oh..almost forgot to add that slightly toasting the crushed ramen noodles in butter was good, too.

Love those ramen salads but the seasoning pkts are very high in sodium and 1/2 c of oil is too much for this chubby cook. I omit oil based dressing and substitute a minimum of light toasted sesame dressing. Toasting the dry noodles and some sesame seeds boosts flavor a lot. Yum! Wish I had some cabbage to make some right now.want some right now....

A great foundation - you can enjoy simply as is or add other stuff.  I added broccoli slaw, cranberries, chopped green onions, finely chopped celery, and shredded carrots - it was excellent.  Best chilled for awhile - at least 2 hours.

I received a similar recipe from a friend but lost it so found this one.  I used a package of shredded cabbage with carrots and per suggestion of someone else, doubled the sauce.  Per my friend's recipe, I used 2 packages of oriental ramen and mixed the seasoning packets in with the sauce.  I also put in a little sesame oil and 1/s rice wine vinegar.  I remember my friend's recipe said to let the dressing blend flavors overnight but I was hungry so ate it right away and it's very good.

Don't hesitate (like I did ) to try this dish , its delicious !

Made this last night, it was great. I didn't have any cabbage, so I thinly sliced 3 romaine hearts and mixed with half a bag of mixed salad greens. The dressing is perfect, esp if you add a touch of seasame seed oil. I also added mandarin organges and seasame seeds to the salad. Great with grilled teriyaki chicken.

I love Hawaiian food and this is really great. I tried it without the sunflower seeds since that's the way my favorite Hawaiian restaurant serves it - and it was really close to the restaurant's!

My cousin made a salad like this for a baby shower and it was so delicious I had to find a recipe. I followed the recipe except I did not have any nuts. I did add green onion and sesame seeds and it was marvelous! I also used "pork ramen" and the dressing was to die for! We brought this to a barbecue and it was devoured. After we left we went to the grocery store and bought more cabbage so we could make it again right away. Thank you for sharing :)

Very good and easy to make!  I used 1/2 package of shredded cabbage and carrots, 2 packets of the chicken flavoring, some green onions, sesame seeds, and used only about 1/4 cup oil. I also did not have plain vinegar, so I used 1 tbsp. rice vinegar (ran out) and 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar. I also added a couple splashes of sesame oil. Topped the salad with marinated spicy szechuan chicken and broccoli. Husband does not usually like cold salads, but he liked this! Will definitely make again!

So good!  I get a salad like this from a local deli and wanted to try and replicate it at home - this is perfect!  Only changes were that I used half the amount of oil and split the vinegar with 1/2 white and 1/2 seasoned rice.  Totally satisfied my craving - thanks!

I made this yesterday for my son's Boy Scout family potluck.  I bought a package of shredded coleslaw mix.  I knew it was more than a half of a cabbage and I wanted a lot of dressing. I made tripled the dressing but only put in 2 packages of the ramen seasoning and 1 package crushed noodles.  Left out the sesame seeds and just chopped up one bundel of green onions. I made it a few hours ahead of time but didn't mix in the almonds or noodles until just before serving and had  really good luck with it.  Very tasty and easy.
Thanks! :O)

I left out the ramen seasoning packet, pan-toasted the ramen noodles & slivered almonds in sesame oil, added a can of (drained) mandarin oranges.  Also, I found a low-fat version of the ramen noodles (which are normally very high in fat content).  I substituted rice wine vinegar in place of the distilled vinegar. Excellent!  Everyone who tasted it asked for the recipe!

Boring - the only good thing I can say about this salad was it was crunchy.  I cook primarily for my family so we can avoid the additives so common in processed food, yet not listed in the ingredients but in the directions was the use of the preservative laden ramen packet.  I went ahead and used it since there didn't seem to be much flavor without, not enough flavor with it.

Good recipe.  Did variations as most others did.  Added sunflower seeds and use store bought Lite Sesame dressing.  I also sauted chicken stir fry sized chicken breast in the dressing and added to salad.

I love this and I can get my teenage son to eat cabbage becase he likes it too.  I use a package of slaw mix, rice wine vinegar and 2 teaspoons of sesame oil to give more asian flavor. Throw the seasoning out..too much sodium...

I used a bag of cole slaw mix and added a handful of almonds and dried cranberries. Only used 1/4 c sunflower seeds (plenty). It turned out really delicious! My only complaint is that it was too oily. Next time, I'll cut down on the oil. I also used half sesame oil and half olive oil - awesome!

Always loved this when my sister made it. I made a double batch, I doubled everything but the oil (1.5x the amt) and needed more vinegar than double. YUM. Used asian noodle kind.

I love this recipe. I had it at a fam party once and have craved it ever since. This tastes just like the one my aunt made. She used almonds which I like much better than sunflower seeds but that was all I had tonight.

Yum!  So easy, and fast too. My husband loved the simple yet tangy dressing, and we threw in some mandarin oranges, diced celery, and green onions. I used the oriental flavored ramen. Thanks--great recipe!

I'll have to try this one again. I think I needed more dressing and I used a whole head of red cabbage instead of the green, which seemed to be too strong of a flavor. I needs to soak overnight I think too. Maybe next time it will turn out better. I'm not writing this one off yet.

I make this as well...but Omit the oil completely.  I use 2T of crunchy Peanut Butter and 2 T of water.  I also sometimes add a spoonful of Orange Marmalade to the dressing instead of part of the sugar.  The Marmalade gives it a nice zing. I always use Apple Cider Vinegar and usually a few dashes of soy sauce.

A nice, unexpected blend of flavors. My wife really liked it, but I had trouble liking the vegetable oil. Next time I may try coconut oil, instead.

Made this twice over the weekend. First time followed directions and it turned out very bland, no taste at all. Second time I used 1/4 oil, 1/4 cup vinager,  1/4 cup sugar and 2 flavor packs from the ramen noodles (I used one chicken and one oriental). I also added some chopped green onions and 3/4 cups of sliced almonds. It was much better and there were no leftovers!

Just had this at a church dinner and it was the best salad there. Was told the recipe came from here and was made as written. The Ramen noodles were not crunchy, but I didn't know they were supposed to be and it was great as it was. I'll try it that way when I make it myself.

I used 3/4 a head of cabbage, and 1/2 of the remaining ingredients (I prefer smaller amounts of dressing), using oriental flavor ramen noodles.  It was by FAR the best cabbage I've ever eaten.  I will be sure to make again.

This is delicious.  I used half vegetable, half olive oil.  I also used half apple cider vinegar and half balsalmic vinegar.  My other recommendation is to mix together the cabbage and sunflower seeds, and let it marinate in the liquid ingredients in the fridge several hours. 10 minutes before serving, I crunched up and mixed in the ramen noodles, that way they remained crunchy, and by then the seasonings had melded into the other ingredients.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This is a great dish to bring to a cookout or summer event.  It is hard to stop eating this once you start.  Toasting the broken up Ramen noodles in a toaster oven before tossing them into the dish is key though.  I also toast the almonds first too.  Delicious!

Had this salad at a baby shower and then came here to hunt down the recipe.  So, so good.  Make sure you only make enough for the meal you're eating because it's not great the next day.  A little soggy after being stored in the fridge overnight.

This is so yummy and versatile.  My grandmother adds green onions and peas, and I added almond slivers as well.  I also beg to differ on the comment that it doesn't hold well!  It might not have the quite the same crunch the next day, but it's still delish :)  (p.s. we add salt & pepper to taste also)

Had this a couple years ago and was pretty skeptical about trying it. But I am glad I did. This is really good. Made it for my family and they were skeptical also, but once they tasted it they liked it also.

This was great! For extra flavor, I used apple cider vinegar instead of white, and stirred in a can of cold chuncked chicken, and craisins. We used almond slivers instead of sesame seeds. All of kids ate it up. (I have four kids ages 7 down to 1)

Tastey and loved by everyone I know.  I add green onion and chopped fresh broccoli to the cabbage.  I use Splenda instead of sugar because I can't have sugar and toast the noodles along with almonds, sunflower seed and sesame seeds.  I've also found that using the Oriental flavor of soup mix along with sesame oil and rice vinegar makes for a more Asian tasting salad.

The dressing on this is so good! I used broccoli slaw instead of cabbage and also added some green onions-really nice color. Also, I waited until just before serving to add the noodles- they were nice and crunchy that way. To make a more low-carb friendly version, substitute the 3 T. of sugar with 5 single serving packets of splenda or equal and omit the crushed ramen noodles. It still tastes good!

An unusual flavor - this is a great substitute for chips etc, when you have a crunchy/salty craving.

Love it- I tweaked it slightly using roasted sliced almonds, a cabbage that I shredded, 3 carrots shredded, sesame seeds, cut the oil back by 1/3, and the coup de gras- wild onions (ramps) that grow in our forest, leaves and all! Very pretty, and tasty.

This is pretty much what I remembered, except next time I will reduce the oil by half. It was a bit oily for my personal taste, but otherwise, it's a good recipe.

Delicious!  And way too easy.  I use sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds. I just made it for a potluck last night and it was all gone and I got all kinds of compliments on it. I just added one bag of pre-cut lettuce, thinly sliced celery, added sesame oil to the dressing, and used the Oriental flavor ramen.

Fantastic! I made this salad this morning and put it in the frig to chill until supper. Hubby ate 3/4 of it before 5:00pm! (He can be rather luke-warm on some of the stuff I make but, this one was a real hit!) My only alteration: I added mandarin oranges. Thank you for the recipe!

I used a bag of shredded cabbage and added in some chopped green onions, only about 1/4 cup sunflower seeds and some toasted slivered almonds.  I suggest substituting rice wine vinegar and found the dressing was great with only 2 Tbsp. sugar.  Just fantastic!  There wasn't a shred left in the bowl after our bbq.

This recipe is really good.  I will make it again.  I made 2 change.

1) I use apple cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar.

2) I do not have the seasoning packet from the Raman noodles.

I was skeptical of using the entire ramen noodle packet - thinking it would overpower the cabbage/noodles. It was good with Italian salad dressing... My mother - in - law was familiar with the recipe, and she's reassured me that it's good made up just as it's written...I'll try it again soon! Thanks Tamera!

I was looking for a simple version of this type of salad, and this was perfect. I can alter it when I want to make it more elaborate, but it tastes great just as it is, and it's very quick to assemble. I make it the night before, to let the ramen soften a little.

Excellent and different enough. My guy loved it!  We had it two nights in a row and we each had two servings. I kept dressing and ramen/sunflower seed mixture separate.

It was delicious as written.  I added 1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil because it was in the cupboard.  It added to the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.  served  with teriyaki chicken over rice - great quick meal.

I do use the flavor packs, it's not that much MSG for the amount of salad this makes. Also just a little minced garlic and mix the dressing up in my Bullet. Everyone loves when I make this. Thanks.

Great and easy basic recipe that gets better as it sits in fridge. Good one to make on weekend and take to work for lunch during week. A few variations: I used rice wine vinegar, added chopped green onions and a pound of chicken marinated in a bottled Teryaki sauce for a punch of protein!

I love this recipe. You can make substitution and it will still turn out great. Yes, like other reviews have said I tweaked it and used oriental ramen noodle, rice wine vinegar, and some soy sauce, turned out perfectly. Will definitely use this recipe in the future

I made this for a church potluck 10/1/16; I was afraid it wouldn't get eaten. By the time I was able to fix my plate, I had to literally scrape the bowl to get some, and had several requests for the recipe. I did as one Reviewer suggested, and toasted the ramen noodles for extra crispness. Once you mix the dressing in, by the power of chemistry, you can't really taste the cabbage, and that was a huge draw for my salad. I used 1 medium head of lettuce, 3 packs of oriental ramen, toasted both almonds and sunflower seeds, and subbed 1 Tbsp. of sesame oil in the oil. Next time I will add mandarin oranges and crispy lo mean noodles for extra crunch. Thank you for sharing!

This is a very basic recipe. I have some modifications that I make to this recipe: I add chopped green onions, I add the seasoning flavor packet from the ramen noodles to the dressing mix, and sometimes I will add grilled chicken also. This is one of my favorite summer salads, and it is always good for potlucks and picnics.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  My kind of recipe!  I've made this so many times I can't even count and every time it gets rave reviews.  I always add green onion and sometimes use stevia instead of sugar. More recently, I didn't have time to chop up the cabbage so I bought a bag of Dole Classic Cole Slaw mix and used that instead and it was just as good.  I also liked the color added by the carrots.  I make big batches so I'll have plenty leftover for myself!

Love this dish.  I wait to put my ramen noodles in until right before it’s ready to serve.  They will get soggy and lose the crunchiness.

I add the ramen seasoning packages to the dressing.  I have never taken this anywhere that I came home with any left.  I always double the dressing and add my own things like green onions and mandarine oranges.

My family goes nuts over mad hatter salad, and this is an awesome weeknight version.  It is also slightly healthier.  I toast the crushed ramen in a tablespoon, (or two) of unsealed butter with sunflower seeds and slivered almonds.

Toasted the sunflower seeds. Used red wine vinegar. Added 2 green onions diced in small pieces. Best if eaten the same day.

Easy and Good!  I added green onions, used both sunflower seeds and sliced almonds and put in cubed chicken.  I prepared the dressing and salad separately and then combined just before serving so it wouldn't be too soggy...but I think the soggy leftovers taste pretty good too.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone enjoyed it.  I did cut back on the oil a bit and toasted the ramen noodles and some slice almonds.  The recipe submitter is right, it does not hold up well so it's best to make just enough to eat for one meal.

This was good - but I should have added some extras. I used rice wine vinegar instead of the regular and that give the dressing a milder flavor - but it was just missing something. I will follow another reviewers suggestion and add some toasted sesame seeds (instead of the sunflower seeds).

I love this recipe and make it often.  I use both toasted sliced almonds and sunflower seeds.

I hate to lower the score for this recipe, but I just didn't care for it. My husband liked it though after dousing it with Italian dressing. To me it was just too plain tasting, and it was too sweet. I only did 2 tbsp. sugar hoping that it wouldn't be that sweet but it was still too much for my taste. I also used toasted pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds, toasted the ramen, and added green onion. This still is missing something though.

OK...I was a little skeptical about making this salad...but this is so good and easy.  I had just cut up a big batch of cabbage on my mandolin yesterday because I was making Moo Shu Pork. I only needed half the cabbage and this salad was great way to use the rest of it.   And the dressing is something I would use on my regular salads.  My daughter will be asking me to make this all time.. In fact, this will probably be a regular meal for her when she goes off to college in a couple of months. Best to add the noodles right before serving.

I made this for a camping trip.  It is very much like a broccoli recipe I make.  I thought it was good, but needs something added to bring more taste.

Good stuff, I kind of cheated though, as I just used chopped up romaine instead of cabbage. As a college student, I've got enough Ramen noodles to fill a warehouse. It's nice to have a different way to eat them. I didn't use any sunflower seeds, since I didn't have any on hand, but it tasted fine regardless.  Thanks Tamera.
*edit* I made this again, this time using cabbage, and I threw in those sunflower seeds too. Nice and crunchy, enjoyed it much like the first time I made it.

We had lots of ramen noodle packages in the cupboard and needed a salad for my son's Boy Scout camp.  This was very good and easy and I love the noodles crunchy so didn't add those until 30minutes prior to serving along with the sunflower seeds!  Thanks!

This is so delicious and made with items right around the house.  I bought the bagged cabbage and it was perfect!
