This was so easy and the finishing taste was very good. I basically doubled it. I threw in a little balsamic vinegar in the cheese mix. Used some ground beef and Italian sausage. The finished lasagna was about 4-inches thick and came out of the slow cooker nicely in a decent piece. Try it, you'll like it.

My entire family loves this lasagna, including my very picky 4 year old.  And it is SO easy. I put in in my large oval slow cooker on low (which still cooks fast) while I'm home for lunch and by supper time it's perfect.  Sometimes I add dried minced onion to the sauce and I almost always season the meat either with Mrs. Dash tomato basil seasoning or a packet of spaghetti seasoning just for extra flavor before adding the sauce to the meat. This is a great recipe!

very easy recipe.  Threw it together in about 20 minutes!   Needed a little seasoning but other than that it was great!  Definitely will make this again.

Great Recipe. It is easy. I doubled this to 16 servings and added some spices. Other reviews said a bit bland, and light on tomato sauce....so I just added some spices from a cooking light lasagna recipe and 8 oz tomato sauce:  1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil. I also mixed a high-end jar marinara with a low end canned version. And added 1 tbsp vinegar as a final touch. 

Cooked 5 hours on low. Result: PERFECTION! The lasagna was not drippy or dry, lots of good meaty sauce (I used 2.25 lbs ground beef, since I doubled and didn't want to break a pkg).
I took it to a church function and they scraped the pot clean. ;-)

This was sooo easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe and it filled my crockpot up. I cooked it on low for about 3 hours - maybe a little more - and the noodles were done but it was pretty liquidy, so I just turned the crockpot off and let it sit for a while, and it was perfect! I served this lasagna with garlic bread and salad to company, and it was a huge hit!

My family LOVED this!  I browned the meat in the slow cooker and drained the grease.  Also made my sauce from scratch:  can of diced tomato, can of paste, can of sauce + italian seasonings, garlic, salt and pepper + layer in noodles and cheeses = perfectly easy lasagna on a hot day!!!

I made this dish for the first time and will definitely be making it again. Made it for a function last night and it was a hit.  I was asked for the recipe - you know it's good when that happens. I doubled the recipe in every respect except for not having enough ricotta or cottage cheese.  Tho' next time I'll ensure I have the requisite amount, there was no noticeable lack of quality.  Set slow cooker on low for 4hrs the night before; shut it off, and set it back on at low for 3hrs before we wanted to serve it the next day & it was perfect. In fact, we kept it on low for everyone to help themselves over a 3hr period and it kept its moisture all through the evening.  Another thing, I didn't have lasagna pasta sheets so I used rotini pasta.  But pasta is pasta, in my opinion. I'll use the same pasta next time I use this recipe.  Certainly makes for easier serving.  As to flavour, the only thing I will add next time is a small amount of salt to the mixture.

I really enjoyed this lasagna. I put a Reynolds liner in and made it in there. The noodles were cooked perfectly. I omitted the meat (didn't have any). Cooked it exactly otherwise. It could use more spicing up but I enjoyed it enough to have 2 helpings and gave  1 to a neighbor. Now I get to enjoy leftovers. Will definitely make again. Thanks.

I used this recipe to make my first lasagna for a dinner party. It turned out GREAT! Only thing I did differently was sprinkled cheese on top before cooking and mixed two different sauces to make the sauce. My husband and friends loved it. Definitely making this again and again!

This is the only kind of lasagna I've ever made and we love it! It's so quick and easy and I love I can just set it and forget about it for awhile without risking burning it. We always increase the meat (we've used hamburger, sausage and venison) and cheese just a little (so there's plenty of leftovers.)

My family loves this recipe.  My youngest is always asking for lasagna and I rarely made it because of all the work.  This is far easier and tastes just as good.  Now I make lasagna more often because of this recipe.  I double it so we can have leftovers.

I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, added a layer of sliced mushrooms and put  fresh chopped green pepper into the sauce.  I wouldn't be afraid to add some Italian sausage into the meat .  This is a great choice to take to a pot luck dinner when you want to carry home an empty dish.

I'm not a cook!!! This was super easy!! So I surprised everyone by making lasagna
I was traveling away from home for work for 2 months, living out of a hotel room, craving normal home cooked warm food so I borrowed Mom's crock pot & the rest is history 

My additions & changes:
SOAK THE NOODLES while you're cooking meat & other prep!!!!
I use breakfast ground turkey meat - it's already spiced up & nicely blends in with Italian flavors & keeps calories lower

I add my own layers of olives always, add fresh sweet onions & mushrooms into the meat + sauce mixture, 

sometimes add layer of chopped broccoli  or spinach or julienne sliced carrots layer to get my "ninja" veggies in too

The first time I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and it was delicious. The next time time I used ricotta and did not care for it at all. I'm not sure if it was the brand of ricotta or I cooked it too long (only cooked 4 hrs).  I would definitely make again with cottage cheese. Super easy!

So this was my second dish from allrecipe.com and I have to remember to adjust the number of servings. Whoops! There are only two of us yet I keep cooking for eight! Anyway as a result I adjusted the recipe and used the following

Two 8oz jars of sauce, 1 pound of ground beef, added onions sauteed with onions in butter, olive oil, salt, pepper and sugar until tasty. 
Layered as directed in slow cooker and still used the the 8 serving cheese portions. 

The result was a meatier and cheezier and yummier lasagna and a happy hubby who ate it up after coming home from the gym. Served with caprese salad with fresh basil from the window sill and garlic knots from the freezer :o

Will make this again for sure but still have a ton left over so I'll make it for family dinner on the weekends. Make it and enjoy!

We loved this dinner! I didn't have ricotta cheese so I substituted cottage cheese and I added veggies....mushrooms, onions, garlic and peppers with the ground beef. I also had the no cook noodles on hand so I used them. I doubled the recipe in a large slow cooker. It made tons :)

This is by far the easiest lasagna I've ever made. I was hesitant to try it, thinking that the noodles would not cook completely, but after reading other reviews, I made it and couldn't have been happier with the outcome.

Love this recipe, it's such an easy go  to meal on a cold day. It's easy to overcook the noodles after  4 hours, I shut it off and take the cover off to soak up the extra liquid. Comes out perfect.

I dont post review here often but I had to comment on this dish... it was perfect!! I didnt changed a single thing and after reading some of the reviews I cooked it on low for 4-30 hours and it was great! 
My bf and I love lasagna so I knew he'd be a constructive critic but he loved it as well (and tried to eat the rest of mine!)
thank you so much

It was very good. However I just felt like it was missing something. Maybe I should have added some green peppers and mushrooms and a little more Italian seasoning and garlic powder? It was quick and easy and still very good with a side of garlic bread.

Easy, and pretty tasty. Great to make in the summer, when you don't want the whole house heated up by the oven.

-Use Classico Basil Tomato Pasta sauce (or equivalent) instead of spaghetti sauce
-Use whole wheat lasagna noodles
-Use 2 teaspoons dried parsley (instead of fresh)
-Use cottage cheese instead of Ricotta 
-Added Frozen, chopped spinach to cottage cheese mixture (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup)
-Omitted the 1 egg
-Lasagna seemed cooked after about 3 or 3.5 hrs  on low, in slow cooker

I just made this for the 3rd time. I've substituted broccoli and spinach for the ground beef this time. I also use more noodles, about 8 to 10 but I'm using a 6.5 qt slow cooker. 
I love how simple and easy this is so it fits well with my busy schedule.
Another variation I just tried: I mixed all the ingredients except the noodles in the slow cooker. Then I took about 10 noodles and broke them up and mixed them in with everything else.  When it was done I spread some more mozzarella cheese on top, covered, and let it sit for about 10 minutes.  I probably should have used a little more sauce and/or water but it was still good.

Easy with great flavor. I find this easier than cooking a lasagna. Add some sausage for a little spice too .

This was super easy to make! I took it to a potluck and my coworkers loved it! I doubled the recipe and probably used more noodles/made more layers than this called for, but I can't wait to make it again!

Super easy to make and delicious. I read other reviews that said it was bland or lacked seasoning, so I added spagetti seasoning. That truly made a difference in flavor.  This was my first time making lasagna and going forward, the only way. Love it!

I made this today. My kids loved it! As did I. I will recommend stirring it occasionally (separating the side from the slow cooker) bc while my top was bubbling with juices my bottom was burning. However I love this. Served with salad and garlic bread. Yummy!!

I like Italian sausage.
Try and make sure all corner type pieces get covered so they don't harden.  
Easy to make and the kids love it even when replacing ricotta with cottage (I typically use both)
Always use shredded parmesan cheese, not powdered.

This tastes good, but the consistency of the noodles is unappealing.  I don't think I'll make this again.  It's easier than traditional lasagna, but it's not worth the sacrifice in texture.

Not bad.  It takes just as much time to put together as a traditional lasagna, but at least it can cook while you're at work.  The sacrifice is that it's a little soupier than a baked lasagna, and of course lacks the broiled cheese on top (my favorite part!).  The sauce seemed a little bitter on a couple bites - something I've notice when a tomato sauce simmers for a long time.  I forgot the egg and added two cans of tomatoes.  I think I'll reheat the leftovers in the oven tomorrow - isn't lasagna always better the next day?

Good recipe.  I was worried that the uncooked noodles would turn out crunchy, but they were perfect.  I substituted the beef for venison.  One modification I would make is to either cut back on the ricotta or add more tomato sauce.  It was like a cheese noodle casserole with a little tomato sauce.  I will make this recipe again with the mentioned mods.

This recipe is very similar to traditional lasagne, just without the need to boil the noodles.  Could do the same with the oven ready lasagne noodles.  With that being said, I've made this twice, and both times it took about 30 minutes to prepare and longer than four hours to cook.  I cooked it the second time 3 hours on low and then an hour on high, and it was too liquidy, but good (used veggie crumbles for my vegetarian daughter - yummy).  I forgot that it was on after eating (I had turned it back down to low), so what was left cooked at least another two hours, and it was perfect!  I'll have to remember that MY slow cooker needs six, not four, to cook this perfectly.  As another reviewer stated, it was pretty bland, but I'm not giving up on this one.  I will try it again, for six hours and by adding seasoning to the meat while browning and using a better quality spaghetti sauce.  Third time's a charm, right?

Incredibly good and easy. Did add spices (garlic, pepper, Italian seasoning) to both mixtures and used beef broth instead of just water. Will definitely do again but double the recipe (I have a large crockpot).

I used Italian sausage in place of ground beef.  Added some granulated garlic to cheese mixture.  Sautéed 1/2 of a large onion and added to sauce, in addition to some chili flakes and dried oregano.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was really good and very easy to make.  I made it twice within the first 3 weeks I found the recipe.  I have shared the link with others as they are loved it too.  I did add a few seasonings just because I find prepared spaghetti sauce can use it. (typically Oregano, Italian seasoning, garlic power, salt and pepper).    Thanks for sharing.

This worked out very well.  I used bulk Italian sausage, and 8 lasagna noodles in my large oval cooker.  I had an extra layer VS the recipe and I was glad it worked out that way.  It’s very heavy to remove in good chunks and requires a heavy metal serving spoon to get it out intact.  I’ll make it again.

Will be making this again for certain. The only thing I'm going to do differently is add an additional pound of ground beef or maybe even spicy sausage. Very easy and actually more flavorful than I had expected. Loved the easy clean up!!

This was very good! I mixed Ragu Garden Chunky and Sauteed Onion Sauces together with the meat. Used more ricotta as my family loves it and used dry italian seasoning in the ricotta mix.  It was much better the next day as a left over so I recommend making  it a day in advance. We will definitely make this again without a doubt.

It was ok. Probably good for the busy person. I prefer making it and putting it in the oven @ 350 for 45 minutes. My husband prefers the baked version better too.

I made this, and it was delicious!  I left out the Parmesan on top and just used mozzarella, and forgot to add the egg to the ricotta cheese, but it turned out fine. I always add extra Italian spices to jarred sauce. I like a little more flavor. Hubby loved it, too! Great recipe!

Crock pot lasagna recipe came out great! It was moister than when I have made it in the oven. Plan to make it for an upcoming work luncheon. Also gave the recipe to my sister and she made it for her family. Everyone loved it!

Everyone loved it, even wanted me to make it again!! I think next time I may use Jimmy Dean sausage instead of the ground beef, that's what I usually use when I make lasagne, I think it would give it a bit more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious and easy.  I doubled the recipe and put in large oval crockpot. I did add some Italian seasonings and garlic to the meat and cheese mixture for more flavor.  It turned out great. It was just a touch dry but I believe I cooked it too long due to my poor timing. Easy fix with a little extra sauce over the top.

One of the easiest dishes I’ve ever made. My only suggestion and it’s one that was made that I followed, please add a packet of spaghetti seasoning and the meat will have the necesssry flavor it needs. This is a hit in my household!

This is not bad.  After tasting the meat sauce, I followed the advice of other reviewers and added spices.  I think it would have been incredibly bland otherwise.  I put the cheese on top before at the beginning of baking instead of the end and that was a big mistake.  Luckily, that burned layer pulled off pretty easily and the rest of the meal was edible.  I shan't do that again.

I have made this several times to the delight of my family. I use both ricotta and cottage cheese and do not use any egg. Comes out nice and juicy. Recommend you use the slow cooker liners for minimal cleanup. They work great!

This is a good starter recipe. Don't make the mistake I made & use the oven ready lasagna noodles - they get too mushy. I used spaghetti sauce & the cup of water, but next time I will substitute 8 oz tomato sauce for the water. Will probably use Italian sausage with the hamburger. Not fond of ricotta, so I used cottage cheese. Must have been okay; my son has taken the leftovers for lunch 2 times! Will make this again.

This is very easy and good.  Some of the reviews state that this dish lacks flavor.  I seasoned the meat with onion powder,  garlic powder, italian herb mix( basil and oregano), salt and pepper. I added the spagetti sauce and water. When I tasted it, I found the water had diluted the flavor of the sauce. I added about 1,5 teaspoons of italian herb mix to the sauce. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly . I cooked it for 6 hours. I took off the lid for the last hour to help some of the liquid evaporate. When I served this there was a small amount of liquid at the bottom, but it didn't detract from the dish. We all loved it!

I think it would have been better with out the water, and use
2 jars of spaghetti sauce. To me it lost some of its flavor.

I agree with many of the other reviews. Too much cheese and not enough sauce. Next time I’ll double the marinara sauce and add a bit of salt/spices to it. I’d also double the amount of noodles, because there weren’t enough in the cross section of lasagna. You only need half the cheese, that’s the honest truth, I only used two thirds and it was still too much cheese.

Liked it very much and so did my colleagues, as I brought it into the office for a pot luck Christmas luncheon.  Made one variation:  added layers of thinly sliced sweet Italian sausage that I cooked beforehand.  Next time I will not follow their directions to add that much water, as it turned out too watery, and I used my homemade sauce, which was very thick to begin with.  Only feedback - add less water.  Happy cooking!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner at work. Everyone loved it!! It was gone in no time. I would suggest leaving out the water and use more lasagna noodles. I used 1 lb of ground Italian sausage and 1 lb of ground chuck.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding some dried Italian seasoning to the ricotta cheese mixture.  I somehow ended up with an extra layer but that must have been due to the size of my slow cooker.  I will definitely make this again and honestly I think I will always make my lasagna this way!

Pretty good really, although I found the original instructions leaving me confused on which size crock pot was best. I settled on the smaller round one vs the big oval, increased the sauce to a 32 oz jar, and used an uncounted amount of noodles-I just layered to the top. I  ended up combining all of the filling into one pan vs two because it was less pans. I put a giant scoop in the bottom, noodles, scoop, noodles, etc. My husband ate three giant bowls and my kids all devoured it.

This dish was good, however I agree a little more sauce and/or spices would make it better. I doubled the recipe, used about 1/2 cup more sauce, 1/2 cup less water, and one pound each bulk sweet italian sausage and ground beef. The prep time was more like 45 minutes for me as well. This was partly due to my round slow cooker, which puzzling in the noodle layers a little trickier. I found the bottom layers more bland, so will plan on more sauce on each layer.

I have been looking for a crock pot lasagna recipe and this is the one I will keep. It is easy to put together and good.  The texture is not quite as good as lasagna from the oven, but the flavor is very good. I forgot to put the cheese on the top before serving and it was fine without it. (probably would be even better with it). The only change I made (intentionally) was I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef because we like lasagna better this way. It will definitely be a keeper recipe for slow cooker option.

This is so easy and so delicious! I had no Ricotta, so I only used Parmesan & Mozzarella. I made my own Marinara sauce. My husband and  grandson loved! I will definitely this make again, but with Ricotta next time!

I didn't care for it.  Made as instructed except shredded/grated  my own cheeses. Noodle texture was better than I expected. Maybe a different sauce than the one I used would have added more flavor.

Overall this was really good and I'll definitely make it again. I messed up a little and didn't realize it said to use uncooked lasagna noodles and I cooked them so they came out really soft and the top layer curled up real bad....but next time I'll know and regardless it was still really good.  (I left out the ricotta because noone in my house likes it and just added a little more mozzarella and Parmesan cheese)

I am intrigued & want to try this, but I have to ask: how do you get the lasagna out of the crock pot?   I have a deep, round pot & can't picture any way of getting the food out in a neat, portioned way.  What's the secret?

Easy to put together.  Since I was using tomato sauce and not pasta sauce,  I added some dried basil, thyme, oregano and rosemary, and cooked half of a diced onion and a minced garlic clove with the ground beef.  The second time I made this, I cut back a little on the ricotta, and the the third time, I substituted the rest of some mascarpone cheese I had on hand, in place of the ricotta. I found that letting it slow cook for 4 hrs was just the right amount of time.

The taste of lasagna with the ease of a slow cooker! Using the crock pot means you can set up this dish the morning of, come home, throw garlic bread in the oven, and have dinner ready to go in less than 30 minutes. The only drawback is that those of us with oblong slow cookers are going to get some rather crispy noodles if any of them touch the sides of the pot. If anyone has an idea about how to insulate the noodles (other than just avoiding the sides of the pot), please post it!

This was so easy & so good, it's the only way I'll make lasagna from now on. I only used a dollop of ricotta because my hubby doesn't like it & he usually doesn't care for lasagna but he had a big serving, said it was the best lasagna he ever ate & he asked me to make it on a regular basis. I used the oven ready lasagna noodles & they were cooked perfectly. When it was ready to serve, I covered the top with a blend of Italian cheeses & covered it for
5-10 minutes til the cheese melted. Next time I'll add more mozzarella & more seasoning to suit my taste.  I put everything together in the crock one evening (it only took 15-20 minutes) then put it in the fridge. The next day I ran home at lunch time, put the crock in the pot, set it on low & when I got home about 4 hours later it smelled divine. I added some Italian bread & a store bought salad ... supper was ready in a flash, it was very good & I froze the leftovers for next week.

I was skeptical about this but it actually turned out pretty well, my family enjoyed it and said they'd eat it again (I am a vegetarian so I did not try it).  It was not watery/liquidy after cooking on low for 5 hours and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  I used regular noodles, not oven-ready.  The only thing I did differently was add a bit of pepper and Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.

I agree that this was a good basic recipe. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and because the grocery store didn't have ricotta, I used cottage cheese. It could use a bit more seasoning/spices and a little less water, but over all not too bad for a first attempt.

This didn't turn out too bad. Made as listed, used regular uncooked lasagna noodles (not quick cook) and was not overly watery. I usually make my lasagna the night before if I'm in a hurry the next day, but that still takes 45 minutes or so to bake once we get home. This is ready as soon as you walk in so may make again if looking for quick dinner or a pot luck.

I used this to modify my personal lasagna recipe for the slow cooker. The only real difference is I made my own sauce instead of a jar, and I added spinach and diced tomatoes. This was amazing, and I'm going to make it again, and again, and again. I've never seen something disappear so quickly! The only thing was my slow cooker, on low, cooked the entire thing in 2.5 hours, which I'm sure is fault of my appliance and not the recipe. I'm just glad I didn't leave the house.

This was cooked way too long.  The noodles were too mushy.  It also needed a lot more flavor.  No one in the family liked it.  My husband was nice and ate 2 servings because he was hungry. I added some Italian seasoning, but it didn't do anything.

We didn't care for this.  The reason for two stars instead of one is because I liked the idea of using the crockpot instead of baking it in the oven for energy efficiency and not heating up the kitchen.

This recipe is a life saver. A quick and simple lasagna that I can do in a slow-cooker!!! The only change I made was to use whole wheat lasagna noodles. Everything else was to the recipe. The only thing I noticed is that the lasagna has to cool a fair amount before serving. If right out of the slow-cooker, it tastes bland. Once it cools enough, the flavors seem to crop up, and it's actually quite salty! I wouldn't say it's the best lasagna I've ever had. But for the easiness of it? I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

When I think of slow-cooker I think quick and easy.  I didn't feel that this was any easier than cooking it in the oven and I didn't care for the flavor.

Because the noodles were not cooked, it turned out like a glob of paste when it was done. I saw all of these wonderful reviews and was so disappointed!

Delicious and easy!  I doubled the recipe and used lean beef.  I also used whole wheat lasagna noodles.  Very good!

Very easy, basic recipe, turned out great. Need to add some extra seasoning next time, probably when first browning hamburger. I did add some mushrooms into the meat sauce.

Delicious!  Not quite as special as "the real thing" but a real time-saver, so if you never have time to make it the traditional way, try this!  I used ground turkey, as I don't eat beef, and it worked perfectly.

The only thing I would suggest is to increase the amount of the ricotta mixture by at least half and also, next time, I will add some extra veggies, like sautéed or roasted red pepper, zucchini, mushrooms and maybe some sliced carrots (blanch them first though - there's nothing worse than crunchy carrots in lasagna).

Loved it, have cooked it on many occasions.     My favorite part is its not to dry, not to wet.  just right!    
plus my fussy son also eats it without any complaints.  :).

A good starting point for Lasagna but bland.  Needs more sauce and I cooked it 1 hour on high and 3 on low and it burned on the bottom edges.  I think with a few changes this could be a great slow cooker recipe, but needs work
