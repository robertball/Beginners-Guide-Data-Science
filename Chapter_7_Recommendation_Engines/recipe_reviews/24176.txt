Good recipe. When I want this same flavor in a bigger bite...I lightly flatten one biscuit, spread with a little italian flavored tomato paste, three pepperoini slices, and a little cheese. Then I top with another slightly flattened biscuit and seal with a fork around the edges. Brush with a little butter and sprinkle with a little italian seasoning. Little pizza pockets! Serve with marinara for dipping.

I made 60 of these for a Christmas party.  I came home with about 8.  The next day for a birthday party I made 20 more and they were all eaten.  Everyone loved them!  I did do a few things diffrently. I used regular canned biscuit dough (the store did not have the buttermilk dough) and the pre-cut colby-jack cheese cubes and instead of pouring the sauce on the puffs, I had it in a bowl to the side.  Next time (and there definantly will be a next time) I think I may add a little garlic salt in with the oregano.

This is so simple to prepare.  The kids especially liked it.  I might add a small amount of finely chopped pepperoni with the cheese next time.

My 5 year old daughter helped me make these, and it was fun and easy!  We all enjoyed eating them--they make a great appetizer or part of a Friday night dinner.

This was good, but could be better.  I added some pepperoni to the cheese, and a pinch of garlic salt too.  I didn't add much pizza sauce to the mixture though either.  
You can also make this with scrambled aggs and bacon and cheese stuffed into the biscuits.
Thanks for the versatile idea!!

These were good but I made a few modifications.  I added about 1 tsp. or so of garlic powder to the biscuit dough itself and put a light sprinkle of basil and parmesan on the top before I baked it.  I used Barilla marinara sauce, but the first time I made it, it came out kind of soggy so I just kept it on the side for dipping.  Overall, not bad though. Thanks for the idea. :)

These were fun and delicious!  Using one whole biscuit seemed a bit much for one puff, so I tore them in half and they came out perfect!  Also, instead of cooking the biscuits with the sauce I used it for dipping instead.  I will be making these again!

Pretty good snack or light meal!  I served warmed pizza sauce on the side instead of pouring it over the puffs.

I wanted to try these before I made them for my friends and all I had was Mont. Jack cheese and they were still very good.  I used a little Italian Seasoning on the inside, I brushed them with a little butter and garlic powder, and sprinkled some parm. cheese.  I was in a hurry and just wanted to try the basic concept, and they turned out very well.  My daughter tried one and asked me to save her some for her lunch tomorrow :-)  Thank you for sharing.

I didn't actually get to try these because my 3 kids inhaled them.  I cut pieces of string cheese and wrapped the biscuits around them.  I sprinkled with some garlic seasoning and some parmesean cheese and baked.  I did not pour the sauce over, but served these with a side of pizza sauce, also from this site.  What a great afternoon snack to feed my kiddos!

This is a fair base for a recipe, use whatever Italian spices you have on hand (I ended up using a greek all purpose seasoning Cavenders)  in with the cheese, (used mozzarella cheese stick sliced into fourths), without using any sauce on top they came out golden brown and crispy, great with a side of warm marinara sauce.

My husband and I both liked these.  I used shredded mozzarella in place of the cubes.  I also brushed melted butter and sprinkled shredded parmesan cheese on top prior to baking.

These are delicious!  I used reduced fat buttermilk biscuits and a cube of pepperjack cheese.  I also sprinkled a touch of Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper before the folding in the cheese.  They were delicious.  Next time, I might try a sprinkle of finely chopped onions.  Yum!

Great, simple, cheesy biscuit.  I made these to go with 'Honey Glazed Pork Tenderloin' and 'Honey Roasted Red Potatoes' both AR recipes.  I used a mozzarella cheese stick cut in thirds.  Out of the 10 biscuits, 6 of these leaked the mozzarella out.  It didn't change the taste, just the appearance.  With the items I served with the biscuits, I chose to not use the pizza dipping sauce.  I loved how simple these were to make, and will be making them again.  I will work on sealing them a little better next time.

These were great, however, the sauce made it a little soggy. I made them a second time and they turned out perfect and I had the sauce as a "dip"

Not bad at all.  Stuffed in some precooked bacon too because you can never have enough bacon.

Followed directions exactly.  When they were done and left to sit for a couple of minutes, I cut them in half and there was NO cheese in the middle!  I know a little melted out but there was nothing left inside but the oregano.  Waste of time and ingredients, IMHO.

made these last night to go with spaghetti. The kids loved them!!! They looked great coming out the oven hot. When I got done getting ready for church I came to the kitchen to fix my lunch for today and they only had two left!!! I have three kids and they ate 8 rolls!!! I made half with pepperoni and cheese. Brushed with melted butter and added parm cheese and garlic powder. Reheat is not that great. Will be making again!!!

Four stars for kid related. It's a fun, good for kids things to make. A good way to be creative for the kids. As for adults, I would only give it 3 stars.

These were pretty good. I did some with just the cheese and some with cheese and pepperoni. I preferred the ones with the pepperoni. I think you could do a lot with this. Thanks.

They are great when they're piping hot but just okay when they're cold.  I heavily seasoned the tops with pizza seasoning and garlic powder.  I also served the sauce seperate instead of putting it into the puff itself.

These were good, but we preferred dipping them in pizza sauce, rather than having the sauce poured over them and baked.

As soon as I saw this, I knew I would be making pizza puffs because my husband loves pizza. I used Grands jr's after reading that some people thought regular biscuits were too big. I wanted Grands because they are a little larger and thicker, so the juniors pare perfect. I added a very small amount of pizza sauce to the middle, along with mini pepperoni and the mozzarella. I then warmed some of the pizza sauce on the side for dipping.i sprayed the tops with olive oil and sprinkled on some garlic powder. These came out wonderful and my husband loved them! Next time I will use even more pepperoni, I was a little on the stingy side the first time around because I wanted to make sure they stayed closed. I actually spent a little more time sealing these up because I wanted them tight and you have to make sure the sauce does not interfere or it makes it harder to close. This is a great, quick, flexible recipe. My husband is already talking about a sausage version!

What a delicious idea, and so amazingly easy to make. I made my biscuit dough from scratch and used cubes of string cheese, and they were awesome.

Following the suggestions, I made half with oregano and half with garlic powder. I also didn't bake with the pizza sauce but used the sauce for dipping. We preferred the garlic ones to the oregano, but in general they weren't anything special. Next time I may try them with pepperoni added as some suggested to be a quick, fun meal for kids. Otherwise I'll keep the recipe for a quick football game appetizer if we get in a pinch, but probably won't make them as a side dish on a regular basis.

These were pretty good. I made the puffs seperately and served them with the tomato sauce for dipping. My family liked them, and I might make them again if I had some biscuits to use up.

I think this simple recipie yeilds simple returns.  For our family, this was mainly for the kids - they put it together and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread!  It turned out exactly the way I expected, that's why the five stars. (after reading other reviews, it will be fun to add different ingredients next time)

Really good and really easy, my favorite combo! I followed a previous reviewer's advice and topped the biscuits with melted butter and parmesan before baking, and used the spaghetti sauce just for dipping. Mmm.. a keeper! Thanks!

Made it for company last night.  Everyone loved it - I read reviews first and cut the biscuits in half and added small piece of jalapeno peppers from a jar, and it worked really well with a little zing - think it would have been bland without.

Great recipe!  I divided each biscuit into two layers (that way it makes 16 instead of just 8), I mixed turkey sausage with tomato sauce and added garlic, oregano and basil - then put a six cheese blend on the top and pinched them shut.  They were wonderful!

Pretty good - used the whole-wheat Grands rolls and shredded mozzarella (all I had on hand). Added basil along with the oregano. Didn't serve with the pizza sauce, had it with soup at dinner. Simple, fast, and yummy.

So simple yet so good!  I served the pizza sauce heated on the side.  Next time I will add some sliced pepperoni to the inside.  Sprinkled with parmesan and Italian seasoning.  Yum!

These were super yummy. We made them to snack on while cooking, and ended up not eating dinner because we filled up on them. I put the marinara in a side dish, not poured on top and used more oregano than called for.

These were pretty good. I used colby cheese. Sprinkled them with oregano and garlic on the outside, then spread about 1 tsp. of  sauce on the tops. I baked them too long though, my cheese oozed out. Still delicious. We ate these with lil smokies wrapped in 1/2 a biscuit.
The kids want me to make again.

I made these for my chruch group and everyone loved them! the only thing I changed was I did not put the sauce inside the puffs as I felt it might make them too soggy. But flavorwise these are fabulous!

My family loved these, including my nine year old who swears she hates cheese. We did not put the sauce on them nor did we add the oregano and they were a perfect compliment to our italian dinner. We will make again I am sure.

I found this recipe very very good, however I only put on 2 tablespoons of pizza sauce before I baked them so I had some leftover to put on when it was done.

Like a bite-sized calzone. I wrapped the cheese, oregano, and some pizza sauce in the center of 1/2 biscuit, then served with warmed sauce. Easy and yummy, but most of them leaked cheese no matter how I sealed them!
