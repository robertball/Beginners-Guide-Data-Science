This is so good with a cup of coffee, I imagine that it would be nice served as a side to a savory dish as well.  I prepared it in a removable bottom tart pan so it was very pretty to look at.

I was thrilled to find this recipe here, but it has some flaws.  It doesn't specify what size pan to use and it was difficult to mix well when following the recipe. I used my standard 9x13 and it was far too much for the dish. It didn't cook right.  I tried again, halving the recipe.  I also modified the order for adding ingredients - I mixed the eggs into the butter/sugar.  I combined the flours, cheese, and baking powder and mixed them in together, adding the milk last.  It took 35 minutes to bake right. It was perfect. I uploaded pics.  For fun, I used a biscuit-cutter to make pretty circles instead of cutting it into squares.

My boyfriend is from Honduras. Although he has never had this before he absolutely loved it!! I halved the recipe because there is only 2 of us. My only concern was the topping. Without any  added butter to it.... The top if the cake had a bit of a white dusting to it. I'm assuming that the sugar sesame topping is suppose to be like a streusel. So next time I'm going to add some butter to it and see what happens. But even with that the taste was awesome so it still gets 5 stars!!!

My husband is from there and he was very impressed with my cake when I made it and it didn't last long he practically ate it for dinner. Although I did moisten it with a pinch more butter, bake in a 10-14 baking dish is essential, and I added cinnamin to the sugar on top, excellente

This is the best bread I have ever made!!! I canâ€™t stay away from it! I made this yesterday for Christmas and have eaten half of it all by myself. I halved the recipe because there were only 3 of us. It turned out perfect! I will be making this again!!

This is very good. Dont be fooled, its not a typical quesadilla; its more like a cake. It has a very nice flavor. Sweet but not too sweet. The cheese gives it a unique taste. I used a 14x10 (i measured it with a tape measurer so I could be off a bit LOL) glass dish and it fit PERFECTLY!

I made mine in an 11x16 pan, and it still needed at least 45 minutes. It was very sweet and light, and a great treat for a service team headed to Honduras!

I don't get it. I was looking forward too making this recipe for a long time as the pictures where beautiful and the ratings where all so positive. I followed the recipe exactly, but halved the quantities and it was way too sweet! Even my 4-yo daughter was taken aback by the sweetness and she could probably eat a bowl full of sugar and be happy. Not sure what went wrong with my recipes compared to the others, but 3 cups of sugar (or 1.5 in my case) just seems like way too much. It just tasted like very sweet corn bread.

It was super sweet, I followed the recipe, and it was and it almost burned, I'm going to try again with less cook time, less sugar, and I'm not going to do the topping.
