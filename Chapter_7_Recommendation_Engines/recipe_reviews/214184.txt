I made a version similar to this yesterday with ranch and oyster crackers & when I read the reviews for this, I read one where the reviewer had been using a packet of italian seasoning instead of ranch by accident. I love ranch dressing, but sometimes ranch seasoning packets don't taste quite right without being mixed in sour cream, buttermilk or something in my opinion so I made these today w/ italian seasoning in place of ranch seasoning & they were AMAZING. I don't normally give 5 stars if I change something in a recipe but these were too good to give any less than 5 stars. I cut back the oil to 1/2 a cup (only because I couldn't justify the calories for the full amount and these are so good I could eat every single cracker!) and used two packages of saltines and that was perfect for me. I will make these all the time, thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I have made this 3 times now.  Making it again tonight, I just noticed that the ingredients state RANCH dressing.  All this time I have been making and loving it using Italian dressing mix. I mean I REALLY love it! Now I will try it as written. I'm just saying.... Italian dressing rocks, and I apologize to the author. Sorry, I phill hungry.  I WILL do it your way next.

These are truly addictive and almost stupid easy(a definite bonus in my book!) I used 2 bags of oyster crackers instead of sltines. and a little less oil and more pepper flakes because we like them spicier! Very tasty!

I got a similar recipe from someone at work after she brought some in.  Her recipe calls for a packet of ranch mix as well as a packet of italian dressing mix.  They are so delicious with both the ranch and italian mixes and did not last long.  Yum!

Wow, I wasn't sure about this one but I thought I'd give these a try and wow am I glad. The only thing I changed was canola for vegetable. I have to admit that I cheated and ate a couple before letting them sit over night and thought they were too salty. However, after overnight they were not.

I've made these a few times now and family still wants more! I've used the oyster crackers, Triscuits, regular saltines. All are met with people asking for more. Thanks for a great snack idea. I should add my grown son ran out of bread crumbs when cooking chicken one day so he crushed these up and said the chicken turned out fantastic.

These are sooo tasty!  Spices didn't mix too well for me in the Ziplock, so just whisked them together first & then added to bag.  Easy & delicious - give 'em a try!

These are awesome! I made them with chili to send to work with my boyfriend during a blizzard and everyone loved them.  When his friends came over the next weekend for poker they all asked for more crackers.. sorry boys I already ate them all! Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made these several times. I'm going to try the Italian seasoning next time, and the rosemary suggestion at Christmas. I made two big batches recently, and couldn't finish the second, so I froze them. Just pulled them from the freezer, thawed, crushed them and used them for baked chicken coating. Oh My Gosh!! Fanastic

Made the recipe as written and my two cents worth is 5 stars for simplicity, great idea, and cheap. 4 stars because I wanted more "fire" in my cracker. 3 stars because I thought they were too oily. So I gave a total of 4 stars on average.  I definitely plan on trying these again to suit my taste.  Thank you for your recipe.

These are very good, but you must use wheat saltines they stand-up better to the dressing and the "shaking" to coat the cracker.

I wasn't too sure about this one, but tried it anyway -and was glad I did!   They are really good. I just wish they made a low salt ranch mix. next time I will try a little less oil and 1 1/2 packets of ranch instead of two.   They go great with a cold beer ;)    Give them a try.

These things are ridiculous! I hesitated because I was SURE that you weren't supposed to use a whole box of saltines, and I was SURE you had to bake them. NOT! I made these and tried them after about 30 minutes. They only get better over time. I put slices of sharp cheddar on top- CRAZY good. You can even melt the cheese if you want to get wild. Definitely a MUST for any party.

These are great as is. For a little something different I used Hidden Valley Ranch's Fiesta Ranch instead of the original and I used oyster crackers. The only thing I will do different next time is use about half the oil. Awesome snack with LOTS of flavor!! Thanks for sharing.

The basic recipe was very good, but with a couple of modifications they are fantastic.  Based on other reviews, I used only 1oz (2 tbsp) of the Hidden Valley mixture, eliminated the black pepper and added 1 tbsp of Garden Seasoning from GFS.  I used 1-1/2 cups of cannola oil and they came out fine.  These will remain a favorite for a long time, I predict!

When I bite into a cracker I don't want to smell or taste oil, and that is what happened with these. I even decreased the amount oil that the recipe called for.  I will not be making these again.

These are really good, but do need some tweaking.  I took the advice of others and used less oil, only a bit over 1/2 cup and it was still way too much.  After 24 hours my crackers are dripping in oil.  I may try using less oil, more crackers, or maybe baking them for a few minutes to help dry out the oil next time.  I also used an Italian dressing mix instead of Ranch, and I threw a little cayenne pepper in there as well as the red pepper flakes.  I think next time I would omit the red pepper flakes entirely and use all cayenne, as it blends better for a more even coating.  Very good idea, just needs a few little adjustments.

Cut the oil to just under 3/4 cup and worked fine.  I also used olive oil.  Adding a touch of rosemary is fun at holiday time.

I made these because local cafe sells them for a ridiculous price. These little crackers are perfect for eating with tuna and chicken salad!

MMmmm! Very good! I used only one cup of olive oil and two packs of crackers and they were still dripping the next morning. Anyone have any tips on making them less oily? The flavor was fantastic and next time I make them I am going to use Italian salad dressing instead of ranch, just to see the difference!

Simple to make and everyone thinks these are delicious. I do cut down on the amount of red pepper. However, I thought the seasoning did not distribute evenly when I cut down on the oil. Much better to just dump it all in there and focus on the taste, not the calories.

Why did I make these addictive little buggers?! I made as directed but next time I will decrease the amount of oil to 1 cup.  Great snack to bring to potlucks.

I have made these using half canola, half olive oil with the ranch dressing.  Today I used a taco dry mix in place of the ranch dressing and added some garlic powder and italian seasonings.  Just another flavor to consider. Tasty little cracker.

I have to say, I was VERY leery of this because of the whole plain crackers and added oil... but I was camping and wanted something easy, so I tried two versions with a bag of oyster crackers for each; one with Italian dressing mix and the other with Ranch dressing mix and each, I only used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil... .... ... OMG, these surprised me, they were that good.  They will be a camping, outdoor staple!  We liked the Italian version better, but they were both just as good!  They were better on the second night instead of the first.

Fantastic... and addictive!  These have become my most-requested contribution to carry-ins.  Over the years I have only tweaked the recipe VERY slightly (trust me, these little suckers are so incredible, they don't NEED any tweaking!) -- for those who have a bit more of a taste for the spice:  (1) I use two 10-oz packages of oyster crackers instead of saltines.  (2) Bump up the oil to 2 c.  (3) Double all spices, including dressing mix.  
I have used Italian dressing mix on occasion, if I run short on ranch - equally tasty, maybe just a little less zing.
I make this so often, I actually keep a screenshot of the ingredients on my phone so I always have it with me!  :)

These crackers come out tasting just like the ones I use to pay almost $6 for. I have made them several times now and agree with others on cutting back on the oil. Hard to resist snacking before the crackers are completely ready.

If you like spicy hot food you need to put this recipe in your Recipe Box.  Oh my gosh are these WONDERFUL.  My husband and brothers think this is the best cracker - ever!  The only change I made to this recipe was to cut the oil back to 1 cup.  All the crackers are evenly coated and the spices attached and dried nicely to the crackers.  Thanks I phil hungry for sharing this recipe.  It quickly has become a favorite with my entire family.  My mom, SIL, cousin and girlfriend have all made these since we discovered this recipe.

Love them!  So easy to make and so much flavor.  I did take the advice of using less oil, I poured in about 1 cup - but everything else I did the same!  These are dangerously addictive!

These crackers are addicting! We have them every year at my husbands family reunion and I never remember to ask for the recipe. I have it now ! For the lady who thought they were a bit salty instead of cutting back on the ranch flavor maybe you could use the unsalted crackers instead. Hope that helps.

I made these using 1/2 the recipe.  I reduced the amount of oil and used Scotdogs dry buttermilk dressing mix recipe.  I had to try these firecrackers because I was so curious about how they could not be soggy.  They were crispy and spicy delicious.  You can't eat just one.  They are addictive.  Thanks I phill hungry for sharing this great recipe..

Just made these today, to take on a camping trip this weekend. They are SOOOOO good and SOOO easy! I keep eating them out of the bag...I can't wait til tomorrow to eat them! Wish I would've found this recipe sooner! I will be making them all the time now, for a quick and yummy snack for camping, superbowl (or anytime) snack! My daughter even loves these, as she is a fan of foods with a little 'kick'.

This recipe was so easy that I allowed my 4 year old son to make this. I helped pour the oil for him and he did the rest. The hardest part is waiting overnight to eat the crackers!! Made the full recipe and with people dropping by the house and munching, the entire bag is gone!! Thank you for sharing!! DELICIOUS!!!!!

Oh, man! I know that these are supposed to set overnight, but we can hardly keep our hands out of the bag already, lol! I halved the recipe just to try them, and I know I'm gonna be making more before the day is done. The spices are spot on, and they are not too hot, but just spicy enough~PERFECT. This is going into the snack rotation for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I agree with some of the other reviews...I have always made this recipe with Italian dressing mix instead of Ranch.  A coworker made them with ranch and they were not quite as good, but still not bad.

These were great! I was trying to mimic a local deli who serves these with soup and sandwiches. I thought 1 2/3 cup oil sounded like a lot, so I only used 1 cup. It worked out perfect for me! I thought these were great but I did find myself adding more of the spices plus dill. I think I'm going to make gift baskets for Christmas and I will include these.

This recipe was a hit.  I used half the crushed red pepper so the kids could enjoy them too.  Next time though, I will use unsalted crackers.  They were a bit too salty for some of our guests.

these are so good, rather than cutting back on oil, I added a few more crackers. I do not buy ranch dressing, but used Scotdog's recipe for the ranch seasoning and it was great.  After shaking in a bag and letting it sit overnight, I placed the crackers onto a cookie sheet and baked at 275 degrees for 30 minutes, then left to cool. Delicious with salmon, cream cheese toppings. They last several weeks, if they are not gobbled up, and taste better as they age. Note-I added more crackers the second time I tried these they seemed a little oily the first time. Baking helped to crispen them up a bit more

I made these for my daughter's bridal shower along with many other dishes and I couldn't believe this recipe was the hit of the whole party. Had to share the recipe with just about everyone there, we have made these several times since and the shower was onlly a month ago. FANTASTIC RECIPE!

I am curing some crackers as I type.  I did not read the recipe correctly before going to the store.  I ended up with a package of ranch and a package of Italian.  So, I added both to the mix.  I also added garlic pepper in addition to the regular garlic.  We can never get enough garlic.  I have tried two and had to hide bag so I would not eat any more.  This is my second batch. I made these for a potluck party at the pottery studio where I go to make pots.  I served these with cheddar cheese and they did not last very long.

Made a half batch a few days ago. Took some to work and shared with a co worker. He loved them and went home that day and made his own. My DH also loved them and when I came in from work there were 3 boxes of crackers, a box of Ranch seasoning and two bottles of red pepper flakes... LOL!

Woo hoo these are spicy!  I love spicy foods but these may be a little hot for me.  I used saltine crackers and used less oil (1/2 cup) and the full amount of the spices.  I enjoyed the taste of the ranch dressing mix and the other spices and will probably decrease the amount of red pepper flakes next time.  These are great crackers and a snack I will make again.

OMG!  I should have made a double batch.  Made this for a Family Reunion and everyone, even the kids, couldn't get enough.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 less tablespoon of red pepper flakes and put 1 Tablespoon of cayenne pepper in it's place.  Also put in 1 Tablespoon of Italian Seasoning in for a extra flare.  This will be a staple for many more parties and gatherings!

I have made these crackers several times and my family/friends LOVE them!!!  I decided to read the reviews (for the first time) to see if anyone had a different twist on this recipe.  I noticed that many people stated that the crackers were too greasy.  I, too, cut back on the oil but after mixing them, I place them in a PAPER bag.  As they sit overnight, the spices will blend and the paper will absorb most of the oil.  They come out perfect.

Very good. A nice addition with just about any kind of soup.  I followed recipe except I didn't have powdered onion.  I used minced dry instead and probably would use this replacement in the future as it added a nice oniony quality.  Tx for recipe! :)

I tweaked this a little bit: I used 1.5 cups oil, 1 packet dry Ranch and 1 packet dry Italian dressing mix. When I use 2 pkts ranch, I'll add 2 tbsp Italian seasoning. Our church youth group loves this!

I've made this soooo many times that I just have to add my two cents. Saltines are great but if you like more of a snack type treat, try using two bags of oyster crackers and 1 and 1/3 cup of oil. Keep all the rest of the ingredients the same. Mix all of the ingredients except the crackers in a  small bowl. I let it soak for about 15 mins so that all of the the spices meld together. Put the two bags of oyster crackers in a gallon zip lock and then add the mix. Close and tumble it around until it looks like it's well combined. Let it sit...I know it's hard....over night! Once in awhile give it a turn. The next day all of the oil will be in the crackers and won't be greasy! I even transfer it at that time into a new bag or air tight bowl as the original bag is a bit messy from all of that tossing. It's really so easy! In a flash you'll have a snack that will knock peoples socks off and only cost you about six bucks providing that you have most of the spices already in your pantry!!!

These were really good.  Very spicy so if you aren't a fan of spicy, you may want to cut down on the red pepper. I also thought these were a bit too salty... but that could just be me personally because I don't like really salty stuff.  I would definately recommend trying and tweaking to your preference... I will probably try unsalted crackers next time... but these were great overall.  Thanks!

These were quite good, but IMO, not 5 stars.  I think next time, I'd make them with smaller crackers (more of a snack/munchie size for a party) and use less oil.

These are my go-to snacks when I want something savory! I have been making them for YEARS. A few pro-tips that will have you snacking on them in about 2 hours, instead of the next day: you CAN use just one cup of oil, and have it work just fine. Use a 2 1/2 gallon ziplock bag for mixing. Once you mix your oil and spices, let the flavors infuse the oil for about half an hour, stirring up the bits from the bottom a few times while you wait. I also like to use white pepper in place of the black pepper. Pour the oil over the crackers in the bag, and when you close it, leave plenty of air in there to shake them around in. Every 15 minutes or so, flip the bag and give it a good shake, then let it rest another 15 minutes. In two hours, from start to finish, you can happily enjoy your treat!!

Fantastic!  I didn't have a 2gallon freezer bag so I split the recipe and used 2 one-gallon bags. I used 2/3 cup of oil in each (1 1/3 c total) and next time will cut it down a little more. But the seasoning was perfect. I took it to work to share. Today coworkers are flagging me down on the street to request more!  Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe.

I always make as directed first. I made changes to suit our tastes the second time. Used one package of oyster crackers, 3/4 C. Olive oil, halved everything else. Left them in the bag for two hours (I have patience issues). Then popped them into a 250 degree oven until they began to brown, about 12 minutes.  Seasoning mix is excellent.

These were great; even better than expected.  I made them as an inexpensive side to carry to a party, and they turned out to be the most talked about dish!  I did use zesty Italian dressing mix instead of Ranch, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  This was much better received than the version with oyster crackers, and will be a go-to party recipe for me. Thanks!

A spicy snack. Overall just a different spicy snack. Added different types of crackers, like Cheeze-its, etc.

We like it even better this way: 1/2 c oil, 1t-1tbsp red pepper flakes, a couple T of powdered Ranch: toss w/a full box of cheeze-its.  Crazy good!  Part of what we give away for Christmas every year.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and lessened the oil to 1 cup and 1/3 with 2 bags of oyster crackers and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I made these for snacks for our camping trip and everyone gobbled them down with the same kind of surprise that I had. These little crackers with a weird mix of ingredients were actually really this good. I wasnt a believer and now I am for sure.

Excellent.  I make them all the time.  I use EVOO and they are so good you can't stop eating them. That being said, I never use 3 tbsp. red pepper flakes - usually about 1 1/2 tbsp.  You can adjust to suit your tolerance for 'fire'.

I make a similar recipe using 11/3 cup Canola Oil, 3 Tbls Hidden Valley Ranch Seasoning & Salad Dressing Mix, 1 Tbls  Parmesan Cheese, 1 Tbls Crushed  Red Peppers . Whisk ingredients together real well, pour over 4 sleeves Nabisco sea salt saltine crackers and turn crackers over several times until well coated. Put in a air tight container and burp. I let sit over night or at least 6-7 hours tuning and burping  ever so often. I take these crackers every where and recipe in hand because I get ask how to make them. They are wonderful!

That being said 3 stars for a good base recipe. TOO MUCH oil! I took the advice of other posters and modified BEFORE making this recipe. I used 1/2 cup oil and cut the pepper spice by 1/3. Instead of ranch dressing pkts I used homemade Italian dressing seasoning. I added 1/2 cup parm cheese and they are addictive!

These were a hit!  I used 1/2 cup oil as suggested by others and an equivalent amount of mini saltines. No one could eat just one!  Have another batch on the counter for tonight's festivities.

Amazingly good! For a southwest version, I use Hidden Valley Ranch "Spicy Ranch" mix - yummmm!  And I also reduced oil to 1/2 cup.  These are wonderful with tomato soup!

I would rate these 5 stars if I had made them right, but I accidentally used Italian Dressing Mix instead of Ranch! A little salty but they were a hit. Every cracker was gone before party end! I too as suggested, used less oil and more pepper flakes. Can't wait to try recipe with correct ingredients next time.

Wow what a simple easy and inexpensive recipe that was a crowd pleaser.  I did make some of the suggested changes as I used 1 cup of oil and one packet of ranch and one of the Italian seasoning.  This recipe lends itself to changes like mixed crackers and possibly adding dry roasted peanuts to the mix.  I will keep this recipe around for parties and pot lucks.

Apparently these are awesome!!  Lol   For some reason my tongue has never been able to handle anything spicy, so I have to pass on these, but I make them for my husband and son every year around the holidays. They LOVE them!!  They can polish off a batch of them in a couple of days. I think I've sent more than a dozen copies of this recipe with my husband to give to his coworkers because they love them too. This one is a definite keeper with no modifications at all!  Perfect as is   :)

Easy and awesome.  Used 1 cup of olive oil, 2 packages of oyster crackers, everything else the same.  My husband loves them.  Says they are better than any other snack and he buys the oyster crackers as a hint to make them for him about every other week.

These are truely AMAZING!!! A friend had some whereI use to work, And been looking for the recipe ever since. I used olive oil because it is heathier. next time I will use less, think they have a little to much oil.  I also ate some before I soak em overnigt!! I think Ritz crackers would be good too.  Thanks for sharing. I will make these again and share them with my family & friends.

I normally do not rate a recipe if I make changes, but honestly, the changes I made were so minor that I can't NOT rate this recipe.  Can we talk about delicious for a moment?! Yowsa, these are addictive.
The changes I made: I used mini saltine crackers for two reasons 1)mini anything is just more fun and 2) I like a smaller cracker but am not a fan of the way oyster crackers tend to split.  I personally think the mini saltines are preferable to the full size for snacking purposes.  The only other changes I made were using extra light tasting olive oil (I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut it in half),  a pepper blend instead of red pepper flakes (because I ran out),  and one packet of ranch and one Italian  (because I had them on hand already).
Just the right amount of flavor and crunch. I will most definitely be making these again.

Probably the simplest and cheapest gussied-up snack out there.  Here are a few tips for this otherwise tasty recipe:  3T cayenne flakes is more heat than I like; 1T is not enough.  Three different grocery stores did not have whole-GRAIN saltines, so I substituted whole-WHEAT. (A few years ago, I found whole grain crackers in grocery stores, but not yesterday.)  The whole wheat crackers I bought were kind of crumbly.  Next time I'll just use regular saltines.  I will also mix the seasonings with the oil in a 4-cup glass measure and drizzle that onto the crackers after the crackers are in the bag - just smooshing and flipping the cracker bag does not mix the oil among the crackers well.  The crackers need the overnight hours in the bag to absorb the oil.

I made two adjustments for these. I used Peanut Oil,but a little less of it and after letting it soak overnight I lined them all off on a cookie sheet with paper towels underneath. I then place them in the oven on the warm setting. That does two things, 1)the heat helps cook the spices on to the cracker, 2) the heat and paper towels help push out and absorb the excess oil making them not quite as oily.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I made these last night for a party tonight.  I didn't use the ranch dressing, but used fajita instead.  It took less than five minutes to put it together.  This morning I tried one with my coffee and thought, oh no!  I might not be able to stop eating them!  This is going to be a favorite recipe of mine especially for gatherings.

My family likes 'hot' foods so I added an additional 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper. I can't make them fast enough. An additional tip...if you like them as much as we do, I purchase my crackers at the Dollar General (in Texas) for $1.25...a LOT cheaper than regular grocery store prices.

YES YES YES!!!! Totally a hit. I work in a prison and we were having a pot luck. I wanted to make something that was portable enough that the officers could take it back to their housing units. This hit the spot. The right amount of heat and seasoning. I have made this at least 3 times since finding the recipe and have even used oyster crackers on a batch. Easiest snack to make and oh so good. :-) Thank you for sharing.

I have made this several times. It is always a hit. I have substituted the regular sized crackers with the oyster crackers for snacks and they work as well. Thinking of trying some other types of small crackers. So easy and always popular.

I didn’t think it was that great, and I love crackers. But maybe I just did not pair it with the right food.

Soooo Goood! Ive made these several times now but forget to review. I followed the recipe as written but like others here, i mix the oil and seasonings separately in a bowl then pour over the crackers. i have to stop myself from going into the bag before the 24 hours is up! I thought they were going to be greasy but surprisingly, they are still crispy. the craving for more hit me yesterday so ill be making them this evening. im going to try with ritz, and cheezits too.

what a waste of time. They end up looking like broken saltines and you really wouldn't serve them to anyone. They do taste good but there's nothing there to make the spices stick on the crackers and additionally, you'd never serve bare looking saltines to anyone. This is the worst recipe I've made on this site, or really any where. In trying to coat them in the plastic bag, they get broken. I couldn't get anyone to eat them and threw them all out

I’ve made these crackers using both the mini saltines as well as oyster crackers. They are wonderful, regardless! Did I mention addicting?! Snap to it and get to creating! Mix it up and try different flavors of dry dip mix. I find mine at local craft shows.

I've been making these for years since I had it as a kid once on an old hunting lease but I have tweaked the recipe a little. I use a tablespoon of each spice instead of a tsp (still use 3 tbsp of chili flakes) I also add a little cayenne and lemon pepper. I like a lot of heat and a little more zest.

3.28.18  I cut this recipe in half and used fewer red pepper flakes and less oil.  Taste is good, but every time you pick up one of these crackers, your fingers get greasy, and that’s with using only 1/3 cup oil.  As the recipe submitted mentions, I would think that they’d be a good partner to chili, but I think I’ll stick with my oyster crackers, so I’m not constantly reaching for a napkin to wipe off my fingers.

I made these with cheez-it crackers instead this time and added a little more red pepper flakes because of personal preference and they were soooo good. These are great with saltines as I originally tried it but the cheez-it crackers were maybe even better (I'm a cheese addict). Thank you for the recipe, these will be great for snacks, in lunches, and to give to friends and family.

I have made these several times now with only a few changes. I use 100% sunflower oil and I usually make two batches at a time, one with the pepper flakes and one without for those who don't like hot stuff. I have also tried using the Italian dressing but it just doesn't seem to taste right. These are my go to item when I need to "bring a dish" and they are always a hit.

I have been making these for several years and everyone loves them.  I use a box of Nabisco Saltines, one packet of ranch and one packet of Italian dressing mix and only 1 cup of oil.  I use less red pepper flakes than called for (or sometimes none), because I don't like them too spicy.  A great snack and great with chili!

I used Italian dressing mix only because that's what I had. I found them a bit on the salty side but that might be because I did not use Ranch dressing mix. I did like the flavor of these and the next time I make them I will use unsalted crackers.

I followed directions to the letter EXCEPT I cut the oil to 1 cup only and put two sleeves of saltine crackers.  They turned out fabulous and was a huge hit at the football get together I went to. Thank you!!!

These are really yummy. I found 1 1/3 c. oil, 1 pkg. ranch dressing mix and 2 Tbsp. red pepper flakes to be enough. 1 2/3 c. oil was to much.

I used only one tablespoon of red pepper flakes and the other 2 tablespoons were ms.dash extra spicy, which isn't that spicy..  was still uncomfortable to eat.  I can't imagine 3 tablespoons of red pepper. toooo spicy for all of us.  would have been 5 stars without that..

Made this many times now.  It is one of the most requested recipes.  I do not use multi-grain crackers but regular UN-salted top saltine crackers (or it gets too salty).  I tried this with Italian packets only and ranch dressing only but my favorite is using both Italian and Ranch dressing packets.  The bags really have to be turned every hour, at least 3-4 times, then definitely have to sit for over night.  But I found out that leaving them for second night is even better.  I made some without following this instruction and the result was completely disaster, so I strongly suggest to turn the bag and don't touch for one or two days.

These crackers are an absolute crowd pleaser! I put all of the crackers in a large cellophane bag meant to wrap gift baskets, tied a knot in the bag and tossed the crackers around about every 15 minutes for an hour. They taste perfect the nxt day (I wouldn't recommend trying them the same day you mix them). I think these will be a staple around my house--I'm not sure how we would ever get tired of them! Just for our personal taste preference I did the following: made sure to purchase "ranch & seasoning mix" (not just the ranch!) , omitted black pepper, only 2 tablespoons of crushed pepper, added 1 tablespoon of cayenne.

Very good! I changed it a little. I used Multi Grain club crackers and added 1/4 cup less of oil and 1 teaspoon less red pepper flakes. They were plenty spicy for us.

I thought I needed to try what I thought would be the worst recipe ever...My curiosity had me on this one

This was amazing. I cut the oil way back and used ceasar dressing pack and a touch of Italian herbs because that is what I had.. 
I will make again for sure

Do NOT NOT NOT use multigrain or salted top crackers!  The multigrain ones were absolutely horrible and the salted tops made them so salty they were almost unbearable!  Plain top, everything else the same, and these are WINNERS!  They really ARE better after a day.  I get requests for these  for get togethers, and get asked for the recipe every time.  These are a family (and work) favorite.

I made this at work and people loved it! After mixing all the spices, I put on a pair of gloves. I rubbed the oil mix gently on to each crackers to make sure the flavor distributed evenly. I did turn the container around once so often. Over night did the magic as well. Most importantly, the crackers never got soggy. I got about 20 thumbs up in one day.

I have made these several times and ALWAYS get rave reviews.  The multi-grain crackers stand up better than regular saltines.  I was not a fan of the baggie mixer.  I found a LARGE bowl at Target with a 4-sided snap on lid that would not leak.  I LOVE IT!
It is great for shaking and coating the crackers.  Bought one and gave it to a friend with the ingredients and recipe.  He was thrilled.

I'm making a 3rd batch now. I used only 2 packs of saltines half a packet of ranch dressing celery salt,along with onion and garlic powder. I left out the pepper and added just a dash of cayenne instead. Family went crazy for them.

I couldn't imagine these wouldn't be oily, but they weren't.  If you think there's too much oil you could brush it on both sides and proceed from there.  I have made them two ways.  One baked for a bit in the oven, because my crackers were old and stale and the submitted way.  Both are excellent.  I haven't tried the Italian mix yet, but I would also like to try Dill Pickle mix.  These things are the best for a humble old Saltine.

Love these....I have made them several times now. Made them with mini saltines, cheez-its and regular saltines, love them all. The only change which was consistent throughout any of the cracker varieties was I used less oil.  Will be making them over and over again.

I found these a little too hot for my taste.  Otherwise I liked them!  I think next time I will try using a little cayenne pepper instead of the red pepper flakes.  I'm a wimp!  I also only used about half the oil and, after they sat for a couple of hours in the bag, I baked them at 250 for 20 minutes.  That made them extra crispy and a little toasted.

Holy cow, these are awesome! I too followed reviewers' advice: Italian dressing and reduced oil. I have used purchased seasoning packets to make these crackers before, and now I can make these without the mix. Thanks for  the delicious recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as directions instructed.  It has definite possibilities.  I will make it again.  However, I will definitely cut the oil way back.  Half will be plenty.  Next, I will use oyster crackers, because I think they will be easier to coat without breaking and also coat more evenly.  I had a some crackers with loads of red pepper flakes and others with hardly any.  Lastly, I think I will change one of the ranch packets to an italian packet, but not both.  If those changes work they way I suspect, I will come back and give it 5 stars.

Served this at a graduation party. I had several that asked about the recipe or commented on it. I made it to the recipe. I think some tweaks may be different kinds of oil or using an Italian salad dressing mix instead of ranch.
Cant go wrong with fixin as the recipe calls out. I try not to fix them often because I can not stop eating them

I used Canola instead of vegtable. Yummy good. You can also do this with a bag of chex mix and half bag of stix pretzels and a quart of pecans. Great trail mix.

This was an interesting recipe that I'm not sure that I'd make again.  Drowning crackers in oil isn't my idea of a quality recipe. Even though my guests enjoyed it,  It ended up seeming too weird and greasy to me.

I wanted a snack mix to take to my in-laws, so I used oyster crackers, pretzel sticks and peanuts.  Everyone loved it.

Love this recipe, but I do cut back on the oil..1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup canola oil.  This last time I didn't have any Ranch or Italian mix, so I tried half a pack of taco seasoning instead.  They turned out great.  I like them with a bit of cheese for a great snack.

I've made these numerous times and there hasn't been anyone to not love them, yet!  I've been asked for this recipe dozens of times! I've tried using olive oil instead of veg oil when I ran out, and it wasn't nearly as good.  I've changed things around here & there because I've been out of an ingredient or two at times, but this original recipe is the best by far.  5 stars for sure!  This is great for when we go boating, and excellent with chili or just plain 'ole family get-togethers.  Everyone always hopes and espects me to bring these, they are a HIT!

These were really spicy, so keep a glass of water or milk nearby when eating. I loved the flavors though. I used multigrain club crackers, and these were a great snack!
