For Christmas at work I made this recipe into popcorn balls (using a little less popcorn, so they would coat & stick together well). This was soooo easy to make, even in bulk batches. Thanks for sharing it!

These are   better than the original cracker jacks!  I only had light brown sugar and light corn syrup on hand, so I used them and added about two tablespoons of molasses.  I used regular peanuts too since that was what was in the pantry.  So so good!

I actually prefer this to regular Cracker Jacks. You get all the good flavor without having any stale pieces. I also like being able to control the popcorn-to-nut ratio!

I have made three batches already, mostly for parties.  Great taste, very easy to make, and everybody who tries it goes back for more!  I tried it with light brown sugar and molasses in one batch (very nice indeed).  I also tried a batch with honey in place of the molasses, and that was good, too.  This is now  my go-to treat for get-togethers!

Delicious!  Alterations based on what I had on hand.... One stick of butter (8Tbsp) was perfect.   Used organic pure cane sugar, light corn syrup and added 2 Tbsp robust molasses.  Also dry roasted Planters peanuts.  Will definitely make this way again!

Made this for Christmas but forgot to take a photo. So I made it for New Year's Eve. So very easy, but when using a dark pan top shelf of oven and  take it out first.
