I had never tried watercress before, nor had I made my own pesto.  I really like this pesto a lot.  I added lemon to mine after putting it on pasta.  This recipe is great!  Leftovers for lunch tomorrow:)

I have always wanted a different way to make watercress besides potato soup or throwing it in salad. I tried this with pasta and chicken. Very good. Thanks Mandy!

Delicious! I always made pesto with basil before, but this time I didn't have any basil - just parsley and watercress. This watercress was delicious!! I added a couple tablespoons of EVOO to help it blend better, though that may not even be necessary with a real food processor (I was using a magic bullet). I omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any, and it was still perfect. And substituted parmesan cheese from the can instead of fresh because we were out of fresh.

This is a great alternative to the regular, basil pesto.  It is light and refreshingj - and I chose to squeeze a lime into the pesto because I wanted to serve it over shrimp scampi and linguini with a dusting of parmesan.  I gave it 3 stars because it is not as great as basil pesto and watercress can be hard to find.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I ended up having to use olive oil to get it to work in the blender and then added water to thin it out to coat the pasta.  I tried it with and without the lemon juice and I would definitely recommend adding lemon juice.  Felt like the paremesan cheese taste was overwhelming and made the sauce a bit grainy.  I definitely like the idea of the watercress in the pesto, just think in the future I might try adding more watercress and cutting back on the parmesan cheese.

I had never tried making pesto with watercress before, so I thought why not give it a try. I was afraid it would be too watery. Like with any recipe, I tailor the ingredients to our family's palette. I used 3 cloves of garlic, substituted olive oil for the mayonnaise, and added a couple pinches of salt. To round out the flavor I put in a tablespoon each of sour cream and yogurt and 1/8th cup of milk. Processed the whole thing and left it to sit on the counter for 30 minutes before serving on pasta. We had a bit left over and the kids fought over who got to use it on their bagel in the morning. Cool, refreshing change to the richness of basil pesto. Great for summer! Can't wait to try it on a salad.

We use this recipe almost every time we buy watercress at the farmer's market.  It makes an excellent topping for pasta and pizza!
