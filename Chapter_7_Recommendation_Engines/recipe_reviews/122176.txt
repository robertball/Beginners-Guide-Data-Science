These truffles are excellent! I loved the maple flavor, and really liked the addition of butterscotch chips to the coating. This gave the coating a nice flavor...not overly chocolatey. I cut the recipe in half, and shaped my filling into half inch balls. I found the filling a bit soft to work with, so I chilled it for half an hour. It was still very soft, but I could form it into balls. Next time I make these, I will chill it for longer, maybe an hour or two. After the balls were frozen, I melted the chocolate as instructed, but found it very thick...in my opinion, way too thick to coat a truffle properly. I added about a tbs. of shortening, and this solved the problem. The coating was now the perfect consistency! Because I made my balls smaller, I didn't have quite enough to coat all of them. My family was more than willing to help out by eating the extras! I found that the best way to coat these is to place a frozen ball into the bowl of chocolate, take a fork, and roll the ball around until it is covered with a smooth coating. I then take the ball out with the fork, using a butter knife to remove extra coating around the base of the ball and the tines of the fork. I tip the truffle off of the fork onto wax paper, take the butter knife, swirl the top of the truffle, and then swipe the knife very gently around the base of the ball to remove the extra coating. This prevents that ugly "puddle" from forming. Thanks for sharing the recipe...my family loves these!

I knew this would be good as soon as I tested the cream mixture. WOW! The only thing I changed was the maple flavoring. I bought a 1 fl. oz. bottle and when I measured it out it wasn't exactly 3 tablespoons, so I just used the whole bottle. I didn't want huge candies, so I dropped them on a parchment lined cookie sheet about 1/2 teaspoon in size. I stuck them in the fridge to harden, then rolled them in my hands to make nice round balls. Then I stuck them back in the fridge while I got the chocolate mixture melted. One thing I found to make the dipping process easier was to only pull a few out of the fridge at a time, so they don't get too warm and melt into your chocolate. I guess if I had more paitence, freezing them would have been better. I need more pratice with my dipping technique, but let me tell you this has no effect on the taste! I'll definately be making these for years to come. Very gourmet and addictive! YUM! (my smaller sized balls yeilded 100 bonbons)

These are good, but very sweet!  I had a hard time dipping them in the chocolate.  I should have read the reviews first and added a little shortening to the melted chocolate because it was too thick.  It was also a problem because I think the maple balls would then melt a little into the chocolate when I dipped them, and that affected the consistency.  The result was not a pretty, smooth chocolate coating like I was hoping for.  I used part walnuts and part pecans.  The maple flavoring was just right.

Love, love, love these.  Made them just as directed, and no one could believe that I made them!  They taste like I got them from a fancy candy shop!

YUM!  I am giving this 5 stars on taste alone.  The only problem I had was that I froze the balls and then dunked them in the melted chocolate, causing the coating on some of the bon bons to slightly crack as they cooled, due to the temperature difference.  Next time, I will make sure they are less frozen before putting on the coating.  **ALSO** My husband can't eat chocolate, so I made the coating with with 2 cups of butterscotch chips and one cup of white chocolate chips.  It really compliments the maple flavor and the light color lets everyone know that it's maple/butterscotch inside.  I am bringing these to a Christmas Eve party...they look great on a platter.  GREAT recipe!

Wonderful flavor, and let me say that these came out very nicely for my first try at making chocolate/maple cream bon-bons. I clearly need practice in making chocolates, though, as I found that I had to thin the melted chocolate with about 1/4 cup half&half so that it was thin enough to nicely coat the candies (half & half was all I had on hand).  I increased the maple flavor and this was a very good move (original may have been a little short of maple flavor?  Perhaps the type used is variable).  Also, instead of microwaving or direct-heating chocolate in a heavy pan, I put together a make-shift double boiler to melt chocolate (I've never melted chocolate before, though I remember hearing that this is what you must do so as not to burn it onto your pan).  That worked out OK, though perhaps the melted chocolate wasn't hot enough, causing the need to thin-out?  Comments/suggestions are welcome!  I used a toothpick to dip/roll the semi-frozen candies in the melted chocolate and this seemed to work out pretty well ... though not sure if there is a better way to dip the candies (?).  Lastly, the idea of making the bonbons small is a very good one ... they're fabulous though way to rich to make them too big.

These were good, but just not enough of a maple flavor for me.  I will try it again adding more maple to it.  Also, they were a little on the messy side when trying to roll them into balls, I had to refigerate them before I could work with the candy.

Way too much maple extract which turned the entire batch of candy bitter. Adding extra powdered sugar did no good.  I could taste the extract all day long & even the next morning.

These were delicious and very "professional" tasting. I added an extra TBS of maple flavouring and I think next time I will add an extra 2 TBSs. I made them regular size (and got exactly 60), but next time I think I will make them smaller because they are quite rich. I loved the addition of the butterscotch chips to the coating - it really put these over the top. I will be making these every year at Christmas from now on.

We tried them dipped in chocolate&butterscotch, and in butterscotch&whitechocolate.  I think it was amazing!  Very, very, rich.  I've searched around a lot for maple chocolates, and they are never in stores near us.  After a few you get tired of it. But it was still very good. :)
