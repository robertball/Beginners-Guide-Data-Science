Made about 500 of these for a wedding reception.  Talk about yum-yum-yummy!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! My tips: Use 4 oz. cream cheese instead of 3, use 1/2 tsp. peppermint oil, and use 5 drops food coloring (that made about 100 mints).  I mixed all ingredients (except powdered sugar) with mixer, then added the powdered sugar and mixed by hand.  I tore off little nibblets of the dough, tossed in granulated sugar, and pressed into candy molds.  To allow mints to set up, I dried them on a cookie sheet, lined with waxed-paper (also, it helps to sprinkle granulated sugared all over the waxed-paper to keep mints from sticking) for about 2 hours, then transferred to freezer in sealed containers.  Thawed in fridge the day before serving.  Turned out better than any mints I've ever had!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very very good BUT this recipe calls for a 3oz package of cream cheese!  USE AN 8oz!  They're relatively quick and easy and they taste terrific!  One more suggestion:  I add a little bit more peppermint to a recipe this size.

These little mints are wonderful!  They just melt in your mouth!  I used a tiny heart cookie cutter and made heart mints for Valentine's Day.  The only thing is that I added the red food coloring last and it was very hard to get a consistent color.  They ended up having a pink and white marble look, which was fine.  But next time I would put the food coloring in before adding the powdered sugar.  I think it would mix in better that way.  My 3-year-old even liked these!  They're addicting!!  NOTE: I also tried this recipe with fat free cream cheese.  You need to increase the powdered sugar in order to make the dough workable.  (Just keep adding it until the consistency is right to roll out.)  I then used tiny circle cookie cutters to cut the dough.  After they dried for 2 hours, I dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate that I had melted in a double boiler and refrigerated them.  They taste like little York peppermint patties and are low in fat! (Use real butter, not low fat spread, or they won't firm up enough). Just can't say enough about these - they're a favorite at my house!

This has always been a favorite recipe of mine.

Here's a tip---use a food processor instead of mixing by hand. 

The mixture will roll itself into a ball and is easy to remove and refrigerate.

The instant I saw this recipe I called my mom to the computer, my family has been making these as long as I can remember

To those that say its too sticky, my mom says the recipe isn't calling for nearly enough powder sugar. If it is too sticky, simply add more of the p.sugar. 

If it is too minty for you, don't use the oil, use extract, or simply cut back on the oil. I made these last year & realized I only had Torani Peppermint syrup & used that instead, still came out great. Always, always a big hit!

I made these for my son's wedding.  I used 8 oz cream cheese instead of 3 oz.  8 1/2 cups of powered sugar.  2 T + 2 1/2 t of butter and 3/4 t peppermint extract.  Use less for a tamer mint flavor.  Beat this mix well to give a smooth creamy mint.  I used my mixer.  This made approx 200 mints.  (Used heart and rose bud molds)  Be sure to roll your balls in sugar well before putting them into the molds.  This will prevent sticking.  I also used sugar crystals at the bottom of the molds that gave my mints a very elegant look that is perfect for a wedding.  I had to let these dry on wax paper all day before they were hard enough to put in freezer bags to freeze.  Hope this helps others that are making large quantities for special events.

I made these for Christmas but am just getting around to writing the review, because I'm going to make them again for Easter.  They were extremely simple to make (my 3 yr old twins helped).  I agree that you have to adjust the peppermint extract (it *has* to be extract, not imitation flavoring) to taste; I added more because I like a stronger mint flavor.  We tinted them green and red, rolled the balls in sugar and pressed them with a cork into penny-sized mints -- good size, as any larger could be overly sweet.  They dried just fine on waxed paper (maybe because of the small size) and they were a great and welcomed addition to every cookie tray I made.  For Easter, we're making them the same size but tinting them pastel colors.  These freeze extremely well and the texture remains the same -- creamy and smooth.  Great recipe I'll keep on hand for something I need quickly for a fancy occasion or party.

My sister and I made these mints for a wedding.  We used molds that we found at a kitchen store, one was a leaf and the other a rose.  We colored the leaves a pale green and left the roses their natural off white.  They were very elegant and received many compliments.  The recipe is perfect-all you need is a little patience and lots of room in your refrigerator!

I made these for Christmas this year, just to be a little different, and EVERYONE loved them.  My dog actually ate an entire tray that was waiting to be refrigerated before I caught her . . . so she must have like them, too . . . and her breath certainly freshened up.  I also tried to use the candy molds, as another reviewer suggested, but that didn't work at all.  It just made a mess, and I wasted perfectly good mints.  I also dipped the bottom of mine in melted Ghirardelli chocolate, turning them into what everyone thought were the best peppermint patties EVER created.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Wonderful, but I will use more cream cheese next time.  I used pure peppermint extract (1/4 tsp) but I think I will also use a little more of that, in the next batch.  The kids had a blast with this.  Nothing hot, but we sure had a lot of powdered sugar on us when we were done!  :)  We dipped a shot glass in decorator sugars and flattened some of the mints that way too.  Yummy!

WOW--so quick and easy to make!  They were gone in mintues.  I made them with 4 oz of cream cheese.  Divided the mixture and add 3 teasp. of lemon extract to half and 3 teasp. of mint to the rest.  Had to add a little more confectioner's  sugar as it was too sticky to handle.  Then it handled so well. I made them small, one or two bites.   Added melted chocolate to half of the mints and they tasted great.  Will be making these and giving as gifts.

These were the talk of the party! So pretty, yummy, and easy to make. I rolled the mixture into small balls and then rolled them in granulated sugar before flattening them with a fork. Gave a slight sparkle and kept the fork from sticking. People actually thought I had purchased them. Especially good when dipped in melted dark chocolate!!!!! Better than a York! Just be sure to refrigerate them well so they are nice and cold before dipping. Otherwise, they will lose their shape. FYI: I did not use the butter as my recipe (given to me by a friend) did not call for it. Definitely not necessary.  I used an 8 oz. package of cream cheese, 8 cups of powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp of peppermint OIL. Perfect!!!!!!

Easy and tasty. I used peppermint extract instead of oil (a little over 1/4 tsp.) and they turned out wonderfully. I rolled mine and snipped with scissors to save time. My husband said they look just like restaurant mints!

I made these mints for both my wedding and my friends.  I get a little creative with the flavoring and use candy oils other than peppermint, such as cream de menthe, cheesecake, pralines n cream, and butter rum.  They are all so good.  I personally wasn't a big fan of the cheesecake- I thought they tasted too sweet but the lady that sold me the oil at the candy store says it is the most popular flavor for these mints!  I also use candy molds- my wedding was at Christmas time and so I did molds of doves, gifts, bells, and christmas trees (so cute- I used green coloring and the white sugar looked like snow!)  It is important to roll them in granulated sugar before putting them in the molds and then pop them out onto a wax paper-lined tray or they will stick.  I also let them dry out overnight.

These just taste like minty creamcheese icing to me, so I wasn't that impressed. I just made them into small flatened circles so I think I'm going to dip them in mint chocolate now to make them salvageable. Also had to keep adding icing sugar to make them easy to handle. I will see what they are like after I dip them in chocolate, but as is I won't be making them again.  Ok...Update....I dipped them in mint chocolate, and they taste amazing, almost like the york peppermint patties, just much smaller, but that's not a bad thing at x-mas, smaller is better. So I will be making them again, but only dipped in mint chocolate.

These are very time consuming, but worth it. I used 4 oz cream cheese and 1/2 t peppermint extract. One batch made 100 mints.

What a great base recipe - perfect for an Easter treat! I needed to double the recipe since i was making them for a crowd and made them in my food processor which was SO EASY!  I used more icing sugar than was called for - possibly even double what it called for.  I just added until I had a workable dough-like texture in a ball.  Then after taking the dough out, I weighed it, divided it into 5 equal parts and mixed each part in the food processor in a snap.  I did the colors in order so it wouldn't matter to the next color.... ie.  yellow, green, blue, violet, and then pink.  I experimented with rolling "snakes" and cutting them, but I had to shape them that way too.... in the end it worked well to roll out the dough and cut with a small circle cookie cutter.  Mine were a little larger than a dime.  I dusted them with powdered sugar and will let them sit out on drying racks for a few hours before refrigerating them.** I didn't have any peppermint oil so for a double batch I used 3 tsp of extract.**
Just made these again for a kids cooking class and they were so much fun to make.  Lots of great ways to use them too.... bridal or baby shower... teacher gifts... Easter... Christmas... fun & easy as long as you make sure that you KEEP ADDING POWDERED SUGAR UNTIL YOU GET A SMOOTH BALL.

I put "the Best" because I've never had anything like these before. They are SUPER and sooo creamy. First, the amount of peppermint oil you should use depends on your taste or what you are looking for. I'm not one that really likes peppermint a lot, and two drops is plenty for me. My husband likes 5 or 6 drops in his, and so does everyone else that really likes peppermint. I always add powdered sugar until it comes together and is not sticky. That way the balls are easy to roll. This recipe can be played around with a little. Add more cream cheese if you like, but just add more sugar, too, so you get a rollable or moldable "dough." Also, you can add any flavor oil. Food grade oil is cheap and easy to find on ebay, too.

Quick, easy recipe that impresses people!  I just made these for a baby shower--did two double batches: one pink and peppermint, one blue and coconut.  With the pink batch I added 1 1/2 to 2 cups less sugar and loaded to goopy pink stuff into my "Easy Accent Decorator" gun and put the star tip on, rolled out some wax paper and "shot" out several pretty mints.  With the blue  mints I followed the recipe except I did coconut extract...which I think is better than the peppermint.  Next batch I'm going to do yellow with some butter rum.  This recipe was so easy, my 8 and 9 year old made the blue batch so they could have a stash of mints for their little tea parties.

These are really good!  I can't believe I've never made them before.  They're very simple to make, even though forming the individual mints IS a little time consuming.  I didn't have peppermint oil or paste food colors, so I used peppermint extract (3/4 tsp) and liquid food colors (5 drops in half a batch of candy).  Because of this extra liquid, I did have to work some additional powdered sugar in to get a manageable dough.  I rolled the dough into pencil-thick ropes and pinched off individual mints with the back of a knife so they would somewhat resemble butter mints.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Note - I used reduced fat cream cheese and these barely turned out at all. They tasted great, but couldn't hold they're shape for very long, so I suspect the cream cheese was the issue.

I just finished making these, i didnt have any of the problems that some ladies had.  I used 4 oz of cream cheese , i softened it in the nuker  for 8 sec. and softend the tablespoon of butter  for 5 sec. put them in the bowl of my kitchenaid mixer . Added the peppermint Extract of which i was only going to use 1/4 teaspoon then said oh what the heck and added another 1/4 Which was purrfect for our taste. I mixed cheese and butter and extract (and i used wiltons gel color which was added to this before the sugar) til it was nice and creamy ... adding 1 C of p sugar at a time ,mixing til it became smooth again then adding  another cup of the sugar .. creamed this then added the last cup ~  Came out perfectly... I want to coat them in chocolate ... Would i do this right after the drying process or after they come out of the freezer

These mints are fabulous! I made them for a family 4th of July party by dividing the dough into 3 parts and coloring one part red, one blue, and leaving the other white. I finished them as usual, and arranged them as a flag. One problem I did have (having done this in the middle of summer) was having the mints start to melt while they were sitting on the table, but that was easily solved by throwing gel ice packs in a square decorative basket, covering them with a towel, and arranging the mints on top of that! I can't wait to experiment more with these neat little candies, they are a total crowd pleaser.

NOTE:  the recipe calls for peppermint OIL.  I see reviews where folks are stating that the dough was too sticky and they are using EXTRACT.  big difference between two drops and a tsp or so of something that you are mixing into powdered sugar.  I didn't have oil so used extract and just adjusted accordingly by adding a bit more confectioner's sugar.  I doubled the batch and also sifted the sugar to avoid any small pea-size lumps. I also let mine dry overnight and turned them over half way through the drying process. The 'dough' works beautifully to put it through a cookie press using the star disc and adding a stripe of red or green.  They are creamy and mallow yet they stay together nicely.  The key I think is to adjust the amt. of sugar if you are using extract instead of oil.  thank you for this nice addition to my holiday treats.

I use an entire 8 oz package of cream cheese and almost an entire bag of powdered sugar. I also substitute 2 teaspoons of peppermint extract for the peppermint oil. I use a half teaspoon to make rounded mints instead of flattening them out with a fork. They are so delicious and easy to make. People can't believe how easy the recipe is and they can't get enough of these mints!

Delicious and so simple! I did need almost 4 cups of confectioners' sugar to get the mixture thick enough to mold. I rolled smalls balls in granulated sugar and then molded- turned out perfect!

I cannot rate this recipe as of yet(that explains the one star), I didn't try it. But, I've been making these mints for years. Tips: try different flavored extracts. Lemon is a good one. Vanilla is kinda bland. After mixing all ingredients (except extracts) split some up and knead in any flavor extract. See which one tickles your fancy. If mix is sticky, just add more P.sugar or let it sit in the frig for a bit.

Made three double batches for a friends' wedding.  Easy and fabulous.  The outsides 'crisped' up while the center stayed fabulous cream-cheese smooth!  If you double the recipe, you will need to add up to an additional cup of powdered sugar to get the mixture smooth enough to handle.

This was incredibly easy! They are so light, they melt in your mouth.  I followed directions exactly except adding more peppermint extract (I didn't have oil). I also added the coloring before adding the powdered sugar like someone suggested.  Turned out perfectly!!  I can't wait to give this out with my other goodies.  I know its going to be a hit!

These are tasty, fun, and pretty easy to make!! I used 4oz of cream cheese, 1 tbsp butter, 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp pure mint extract, then after creaming those together, just added powdered sugar until I got the right consistency to mold. Loved it!

I've been making cream cheese mints for years and just tried adding the butter this recipe calls for, yummmmm!  Adds just a little more depth to it and makes it easier to work I think.  I'm making mints for my daughter's baby shower and instead of molding them I bought mini cookie cutters (bottle, bib and onsie) and just cut them out like sugar cookies!  How simple!  I wish I would've found that out sooner cuz molding takes FOREVER!  Just sprinkle sugar on your surface after kneading the mix so it's smooth and roll it out.  If any stick you can just throw them back in the remaining mix (or in your mouth in my case!)  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are excellent!  I had people ask to take these home from my party!  
I read several reviews before making, and the reviews are very mixed.  I think it needs to be noted that the amount of powder sugar depends on 2 factors.  One: whether or not you soften the cream cheese in the microwave, or set out on the counter to be softened...Two: If you are molding the mints you may need extra powdered sugar so it is not to sticky to roll into balls.  Personally I did add more powdered sugar.  IF YOU ARE using a mold you need to roll in granulated sugar before placing in the molds, so they don't stick!!  Excellent Mint! Thankyou!

These are delicious.  My Gramma made these for my wedding and this recipe is just like hers.  I made them for Christmas, used red and green food coloring to make them look like individual red and green gift packages (from a Christmas mold I got at Walmart--the less detailed the mold, the better for this candy).  I keep these in the freezer and take them out right before serving them (they don't freeze hard)- the colder they are the better!

Wow, so delicious and fun!  I made these for a Christmas party that I'm going to, and they are amazing!  I did use 4 ounces of cream cheese instead of three for this recipe.  I used 5-6 drops of food coloring per batch.  I used rubber candy molds in the shape of a Christmas tree and jingle bells to shape them, which was time consuming but very fun, and they look so cute.  The key to using the candy molds:  refrigerate dough for a bit, then fill the candy mold with granulated sugar, then dump out the sugar (you want the inside of the mold to have a layer of sugar).  Make marble sized balls out of the dough, then roll them in granulated sugar and press into mold.  Remove the candy from the mold by just putting it over the cookie sheet lined with wax paper(sprinkled with sugar)and press it out.  After a few, they will start to just fall out.  I made the original recipe with peppermint and also made some using cinnamon oil. . . it is hard to pick a favorite, but my mom LOVED the cinnamon!  Definitely worth the time!

These mints are totally yummy, but I did find that I had to add more peppermint oil than the recipe called for.  I also shaped them into patties and dipped them in dark chocolate Wilton candy melts.  The texture is exactly like York Peppermint Patties.  You may want to use unsalted butter because the cream cheese does make them slightly salty.

Very quick and easy. I used my cookie press to make various shapes after 
mixing in a little red food coloring so they came out pink striped. Very cute and
delicious. I used 8 drops of peppermint oil. Tried making first batch with 
imitation peppermint - not nearly as good and took 1/2 the bottle.

Haven't made these yet but hint they r as good as what my mom used to make - she used an icing bag with a star tip and made small stars and dried them well - we froze some and the rest went into a candy dish - gone within days usually - we always made flavored ones in matching colors- cherry - orange - lemon and more  - always a huge hit!!!!

These are delicious little bites of heaven; however, they were VERY sticky to work with.  Next time I plan to increase the powdered sugar by at least a cup!  And I might dip some in chocolate for some excellent chocolate mints!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

4 stars from me only because the recipe is so simple.  I just made two batches for Christmas, one pink and one light green.  I mixed the "dough" in my little Oskar and I used my cookie press star disk.  They look professional!  Instant gratification.  For the pink batch, I followed the recipe precisely except for my substitution of peppermint extract for oil.  That batch was very stiff and hard to press and would be best for hand shaping.  The green, second batch I kept a little less stiff (@2-1/2 cu sugar) and it made all the difference in the pressing designs.  I dusted them with more confectioners sugar to make it look snowy.  I am delighted with this project!  I'll definitely make these again.  If I can figure out how to post pictures, I'll definitely post one of these.

I tried this recipe and there is no way they can be considered a candy.  I followed the recipe and i had to pipe them as there was no way i could roll this.  they have been drying for over 3 hours and i still can't pick them up.  i am going to try to salvage them by dipping them in chocolate but will probably have to freeze them first to handle them. 

This recipe needs a lot of adjusting to get right so that doesn't make it a good recipe for me.

So good! I couldn't find peppermint oil any where so I used a 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and it worked perfectly. I also added just a little bit of vanilla extract to offset a little of the mint. It was delicious. Suggestion for coloring: I had trouble mixing the color in last so I think next time I will color the powdered sugar, food coloring seems to work better with dry thigns.

I made these into the size of large chocolate chips. I used just my finger to get them out of the bowl, however I think when I make them again, I will roll small sections into ropes and cut them. I think that would be easier.  However very tasty and addictive! Thanks for sharing!

These was a great recipe. I doubled the recipe and colored 1/3red the other 1/3 green and left the last portion white. I also rolled my dough into ropes and cut them with a butter knife then tossed them on powdered Sugar. Yum!

First of all it is worth your time to read the other reviews, they are very helpful, and give great ideas. Like using the bottom of a shot glass dipped in sugar to press the mixture into the mold. I did find that if I sprinkled a little sugar into the mold first, this helped the mixture fall right out. Make sure you have plenty of time when doing this recipe, but they are worth it.

Stick with the recipe.  Do not use 8 oz of cream cheese.  If you do, you need to double the amount of confectioner's sugar.  Works well to roll into balls and roll in sugar then roll into candy molds.  Made cute baby shower mints.

Love this recipe.  I used peppermint extract like another reviewer recommended.  I just roll it out like a snake (think playdough) and make little slices.  I always get tons of mints and everyone thinks I bought them from a restaurant.  Some of my friends thought I purchased these mints from Lionhouse restaurant.

These are nice and easy to make.  Be careful, as they dry out a little quicker than two hours.  I used 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract instead of the oil (just the right amount!), and I found that using the food color drops (red and green) did not mix with it and made very cool Christmas speckles in the mints.  They turned out so great, I think I'm going to make them like this again and again.

This truly was easy and yummy!  I rolled mine in little balls then rolled the balls in powdered sugar and pressed them with my thumb.  As they dried, the powdered sugar made a swirled effect, making them look more like starlight peppermints.  The ones that I didn't eat and actually made it to the recipents of my Christmas gifts loved these!!

My 12 year old daughter helped me make these.  We did not add any food color and substituted 1/4 tsp. peppermint extract for the oil.  Turned out just great!  Everyone loved them.

These are the best peppermint patties you'll ever have. Their smooth, not grainy, like the boughten ones I've had. It doesn't matter what fancy store you buy yours from, these will beat any other, hands down. Their easy to make, fast and fun. I dipped them in melted chocolate and froze. Delish!

These are great!  Let the cream cheese soften and it makes it easier to stir everything.  I didnt have molds so I just rolled them out and used tiny cookie cutters.  Will be making these as gifts for Christmas!

Very easy to make, as long as you roll them into balls and press with a fork.  I
tried to make them in candy molds, but decided it was more trouble than it was
worth.  They are so good that they don't need to be in a fancy shape to be
appealing, anyway.  I made them to give as gifts in holiday tins.

Mmmmm!  I love peppermint!  I was a bit concerned at first, as the dough was quite crumbly.  First I tried to mix it with a spatula...then I abandoned that for my handheld mixer.  In the end, I just got in there with my hands.  I popped it in the fridge for about 10 minutes, in the hopes that it would roll a tad easier, and it did seem to help.  I found it to be quite fun rolling them out, and I didn't bother trying to make them too uniform...I think it is a hallmark of homemade candy to have a few misfits in the bunch :)  This was very simple, and quite good.  Thank you, Diane, for sharing the recipe :)

Absolutely EASY and fabulous!  I made these for Christmas "goodie boxes" that I am sending out.  I doubled the recipe (mistake!) and had far toooo many!  I rolled the "dough" into small "snakes" and cut it with a knife and made them just like you buy in the stores.  I did separate it into different batches and colored them with different Christmas colors.  I'm keeping this SUPER EASY recipe!

I did not have peppermint oil, so instead I used peppermint extract (1/4 teaspoon) and it was just fine!

yummy!  Used stand mixer, and about 4 oz. of cream cheese and 4 cups of sugar.  Mixed food coloring in before sugar and got a nice even color.  We rolled them and then cut them like in the picture, but excited about all kinds of ways to form them.

First time making cream cheese mints & they are very easy to make!  I used 8oz. cream cheese and 4 cups powdered sugar (due to stickyness).  I used a 10" decorators bag w/a coupler and tip #199.  I lined cookie sheets w/wax paper and sprinkled granulated sugar over paper.  I was able to get 156 mints out of one batch.  They are setting for 2 hrs as we speak.  Time will tell, as well as my nephew after his Eagle Scout Ceremony!  Thank you for sharing!

I am rating this one a 4 because I had to tweak it a bit to suit my needs and tastes but still think it a great starter recipe.  I made these and used a mold for shaping them.  To do that I needed to add 1/2 c to 1 full cup more powdered sugar for a less sticky and more cohesive consistency.  I also added more peppermint extract, and I recommend rolling the balls into powdered sugar before pressing them into a mold so they remove more easily and you don't have the crunch of granulated sugar.  They tasted great!

Not worth all the time it takes to roll into little mints... They tasted just like cream cheese icing and were too sweet for most people. I used an 8 ounce package of cream cheese, so I had to add a lot more icing sugar to make it easier to work with. I would rather just buy store bought mints and won't make these again.

I decided to roll the candies in crushed candy canes instead of adding the food coloring to them and they turned out great! Added a nice touch to a wonderful recipe! I also recommend adding much more peppermint extract that what the recipe calls for in order to get a nice mint flavor.

The first time I made these I could not figure out why they never got hard. I figured out what I did wrong. I used a whole block of cream cheese. I just 'assumed' it was the amount needed. (Considering I have never seen a 3 oz package of cream cheese) I made these again tonight with the 3 oz and they turned out pretty good. I did have to add quite a bit more mint and I still could have added more. Over all pretty good.

I was pretty disappointed on how these turned out. The mixture was a lot like the consistency of cake batter and it was hard to form little balls, even with adding tons more sugar than in the recipe. Then I tried piping them witha star tip and they were pretty, so I stuck with that technique. I COULD NOT GET THEM TO BE MINTS!!! I waited a long time and put them in the refridgerator and they were altogether too mushy. I would have given this 1 star, but they tasted good, even though they were messy, time-consuming and NOT pleasing. I wish these turned out better! : (

Perfection. I used all 3 cups of powdered sugar and that was just right. I used extract because I didn't have the oil and that worked just fine. I did use the paste colors as they make for a more vibrant color. These were pretty simple to make I squished some into my candy molds and cut some from ropes.

We love these mints.  I did end up having to work the dough with my hands to get it mixed well, and making double recipe was A LOT of mints and powdered sugar.  I know now that smaller batches are probably wise.  Like another reviewer, I rolled them into ropes and cut them with a dull knife.  I recommend that anyone making these have extra powdered sugar on hand, just in case... I had to go out and buy more in the middle of my batch.

All I can say about these mints are Wow! They were unbelieveable, melt in your mouth. Everyone loved them. I ate about half of them before anyone else had a chance. The only complaint is this recipie doesn't make nearly enough. I'd try the 8 oz. cream cheese. Thanks for the recipie!

Incredible! Just like mom used to make. Using my Kitchenaid stand mixer with the paddle attachment made this a piece of cake. The dough comes out a bit crumbly, but if you knead it a couple of times, it shapes up nicely. I'll definitely be making these again and again!

Very tasty! I made a half batch just to test this recipe and they came very good. I didn't bother to measure the confectioners sugar and just kept adding more to get the dryer consistancy that allowed me to work with it.

 I took about a 2" piece of it and dusted wax paper with the sugar and rolled it like a snake and cut them into 1/2 pieces. They dried quickly and I let my neighbor taste them and she really liked them so now I'm going to make a full batch to take with me to her party tomorrow.

Yummmm! My grandmother used to make these for me and they taste just like I remembered. Were a real hit at a baby shower I gave.

This recipe is pretty close to the one I use. I don't add the butter, and I use extract (1/2 tsp) in place of the oil. It helps to chill the dough for a while, overnight even, to make it easier to work with.

We make these mints for graduations, weddings, showers, first communions, and other special occasions.  You can also use rum extract, almond extract, lemon extract, etc.  We usually have three or four different flavors on each plate.  Divide the dough into sections and flavor each section, or if you are making more than one batch, flavor each batch with a different extract.

Very impressed with this recipe.  Made a couple of changes.  I used 4oz of cream cheese, and about 4 cups of icing sugar.  I also used 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract. I blended all the ingredients together before adding the icing sugar.  I divided the batch in two, and coloured one green and one red.  As one reviewer said she got "sparkles" when she dyed her batch of mints, I added the food colouring onto the bowl, and NOT onto the dough.  I then blended everything with a mixer and got a nice consistent colour throughout.  Will be adding this to my recipe book!

I made these for a fundraiser.  Pressed them into small molds and packaged them by the dozen in small clear plastic bags tied with crinkle ribbon.  They sold for $1 per bag.  I made a double batch that yielded about 100 per recipe.  Although it is time consuming because each piece of candy has to be formed individually, they are easy to work with.  If the candy is sticky, just continue to add powdered sugar, about 1/4 c. at a time, until it is a workable, non-sticky consistency.  Using molds takes no longer than pressing with a fork and gives a more professional look.  I used about 3/4 tsp. peppermint extract per batch and that seemed to be about right.

These are great!  Have made them for numerous weddings and they are always a hit.  I like the flavoring stronger also and use more.  Also like someone else mentioned it helps to dry them on cookie sheet for a few hours to a day and then freeze if needed.  Take out a few hours to a day ahead of when needed.  Make sure and roll in fine sugar before molding.  Yummy!

These are absolutely phenomenal. My mom's cousin, a wedding coordinator, used to make these for all of her weddings when I was a kid. I could never get enough of them! Now I guess I won't have to...they're so easy. I dressed mine up with Kisses and Hugs because the snowballs looked so plain and I don't have any candy molds. It's fine if they're not still frozen when you bite into them.

This recipe was awesome. I used peppermint extract instead of oil. When I rolled them into balls, I also rolled them in chocolate and them let the chocolate dry. After they cooled, I individually raped them in aluminum foil and decorated them with winter shapes to give to my family and friends.

When I made this recipe, I omitted the butter, used fat-free cream cheese, and substituted peppermint extract for the peppermint oil.  I rolled out the dough and cut it into little squares.  They were delicious, and I'll definitely be making them again.

Yum!  I made these last weekend for our daughter's baptism.  I used 4 oz of Cream Cheese as another user suggested.  I used 3 drops of red food coloring to make them a beautiful baby girl pink.  I rolled them in granulated sugar for a fancier texture.  Everyone loved them.  They were easy to make (my 4 yr old son helped!) and very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit!!! For one it is very easy. I made these to add to my Christmas gift baskets and everyone loved them. I didn't use molds this year but I think I will try that next time. The dough is very easy to work with and I think it will hold up in a mold quite nicely.

Definately use the 3 ounce pakage of cream cheese or they will not come out stiff enough.  Good flavor and very easy to make.

I made these for Christmas and tinted them with green food coloring.  Instead of rolling into balls, I rolled them out on waxed paper and cut out the mints with miniature holly shaped cookie cutters.  They are delicious and beautiful and just melt in your mouth.  My kids can't keep out of them!

These are super easy and really good.  I followed the advice of another and ran mine through the food processor.  It mixed really well.  I didn't have peppermint oil so I used 1/4 tsp of extract.  I rolled them into little balls and then coated them in candy cane that I also ran through the food processor so it was finely ground.  I didn't use food coloring and they look beautiful!  The candy cane really adds a lot.

This was a good recipe and really easy to make. I tripled the recipe and got two medium sized containers of mints. My personal recommendation is to taste the mix to determine if it has enough mint in it before you make the mints. I ended up adding much more mint than the recipe called for.

This was an awesome recipe! they taste like the inside part of a  peppermint patty! I made multi-colored teddy bear molds and regular white discs with the fork tine "design" on them (tried to post pictures on here but it didn't work). These mints couldn't be any easier and the taste is so melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I double the recipe just so that I didn't have half a cream cheese block sitting around and I'm glad I did because the kids, and my hubby (okay, and me too) devoured them in a heartbeat! these will be given as Christmas gifts this year because they are that tasty and that easy to make! I let mine dry overnight and I turned them 1 time thru the drying process. Also, if the "dough" gets too sticky, just add a bit more powdered sugar. I found that if I scooped some out and placed it on the wax paper, it was easier to mold when I was done scooping & back at the beginning to my 1st ball. After molding the last ball into the round shape, I went back to the beginning again and imprinted with the fork tines and didn't need any excess sugar on the fork because the mints had kind of crusted diminishing the need to use sugar to keep the fork from sticking. I used the sugar to make the teddy bear molds but after tasting the two, I actually like the non sugared mints better (they really tasted much smoother and creamier without the extra sugar). I will continue to make them both ways-the kids really enjoy the molded mints! Thank you so much Diane for sharing this!10stars!!!

Just like my favorite restaurant mints, but better! Easy as pie and totally customizable. I used tiny cutters, dipped in powdered sugar to cut them into shapes... time consuming, but they looked great. I followed other reviewers' advice and added 1+ tsp of peppermint extract.

I was looking for something to add to the Christmas cookie tray and noticed these could be frozen. They were quick and easy to make. I tried a half a recipe and got 36 mints. I would definitely do the full recipe next time. I scooped the filling onto parchment with a cookie scoop. I got 9 scoops, with half the recipe, which I cut into 4 pieces each. Rolling into a rope and cutting, which I originally planned, would have been to sticky. So, I rolled each piece into a mini marshmallow shape, dusting them or my hands with powdered sugar as needed. Then, I stood the pieces up and pressed with a fork, as suggested. It did make a nice even pattern. Next time I may experiment with food color paste or a mini candy or fondant mold for an imprint. Thanks

When I made these I added a little bit more butter and mint.And I divided the dough,rolled it into strips,and sliced them.I then shaped them a little. When they are made right,they taste just like After Dinner Mints only smoother.Everyone loves them,especially my eldest son.

These are a bit time-consuming (bc each mint has to be formed individually), but easy and cute :) I used 4 oz cream cheese and 4 cups of powdered sugar. Half of a tsp of peppermint extract worked out well for me! I rolled into balls and then flattened with a spoon. Cute addition to my cookie tray!

Very creamy, melt-in-your-mouth minty, and easy to do.  I was not sure if these would get firm enough because they were soft when I put them in the refrigerator.  Within hours they firmed up nicely.  No changes are needed with this recipe.  Thank you Diane for sharing.

These were very easy and really good!  I couldn't stop eating the dough!  I had to add more powdered sugar and a lot more peppermint oil!!  My bottle said to add 1/4 teaspoon for every cup of ingredients.  I used 4 oz. cream cheese and 4 cups powdered sugar (plus some added later), and used a teaspoon or more of oil!  even though this sounds like a lot, they still barely had a peppermint taste!  They still taste great though!  I used the rope and cute method which worked well!  Thanks for the suggestion!  I highly recommend this recipe!  The different oil/color combinations are endless!

So easy and they're so tasty! I'm making gift packs of them, so far I have mint and lemon, the last one I'll be making is going to be orange-ginger. Going to finely chop some crystalized ginger into it with some orange extract, or possibly zest. I'm always making short cuts, so this goes in my food processor and mixed, adding enough sugar until it clumps into a ball, then I roll into snakes like it's play-doh and just cut into little individual mints. Not gorgeous that way, but with the assorted colors they're pretty enough and they taste wonderful.

I made these mints for my daughter's birthday party tomorrow. The first batch I made turned out horrible...it was too stiff to work with...I followed the recipe to the "T". I made again, split into two bowls and the mixture turned out perfect. I upped the peppermint oil to 4 drops. We like our mints strong! I sprinkled sugar on my pastry mat, rolled the mints into balls, then smashed them down using a spoon. The mints look great, but they would be even better using candy molds. These were fun to make with my 6 year old daughter...even more fun to eat! Thanks for sharing.----These are wonderful after they've been in the fridge for a while. If you want a really soft mint, refrigerate, then allow the mint to reach room temperature before serving. These are great however you wish to serve them!

I made these for a baby shower and they were a huge hit. I had bought baby shower candy molds, and rolled the dough in granulated sugar before pressing into the mold, then popping them out to dry on parchment paper. To store, I cut squares of parchment paper that fit into a ziploc bag, and slid them into the ziploc bag. I made them a couple of days before the shower but they would have been fine for at least a couple of weeks (I know, I had made more than I needed and kept nibbling on them!).

I made a double batch of these this morning (8 oz. block of cream cheese, 6 cups of sifted powdered sugar, and 1.5 teaspoons of peppermint extract, along with some icing color) but didn't get a chance to look at previous reviewers, which is why they didn't turn out as well as expected. I did use fat-free cream cheese, which another reviewer said was fine, as long as you added extra powdered sugar (which I didn't do). I ended up having to pipe the mints out of a giant icing bag, which was much easier, but even after 2 hours, they had not set. They had a crust, but were definitely tacky inside, and impossible to get off the wax paper without crushing them completely. I'll try again later today with additional sugar. BTW, this made about 3 cookie sheets full of large star-tip (1/2-inch tall?) shaped mints.

This recipe saved me!  My stepdaughter wanted me to make mints for her wedding, and I had lost my original recipe.  I made over 1000 1" round 1/4" thick mints, rolled them in granulated sugar and they dried perfectly and within hours.  Creamy perfection; my father-in-law, who hates cream cheese, said that the mints were the only thing worth eating at that reception (lol, he didn't know I made them).  Thanks a billion, this recipe is fantastic!!

These are very good!  I experimented with different flavors and with the exception of mint, I really love the cinnamon!  I rolled my 'dough' in between wax paper and used my fondant cutters to make different shapes.  So fun!  I think I will give some out for Valentine's Day!

These were much better as small bite size mints than as bigger mints, unless dipped in chocolate.  I piped out the bite sized ones and then made peppermint patties with the larger ones.  I dipped them in melted semisweet chocolate chips.  Worked great.

This was very good.  I used 8 oz cream cheese, 2lb box of powdered sugar, 1/8 tsp peppermint extract (next time will probably us 1/4 tsp) and 2.5 tbls margarine, dumped in the kitchen aid mixer and 30 seconds later it was ready for food coloring-making these for a baby shower.  As others have said didn't yeild as much as the recipe states, ended up with about 14-16 dozen mints and I did the recipe at 2.5 times the normal ingredients.

Wow!  These were really good.  I had to add a little more cream cheese and peppermint, because it was pretty dry.  I didn't have peppermint oil, so I used peppermint extract.  But these tasted like butter mints.  I made these as part of a Christmas gift, and I will be making them every year.

This is good but add a little more confectioners sugar at a time to stiffen the mints.  Also, I flatten these into thin disks and dip in melted chocolate.  They are always a hit.

Wonderful mints!  This is a good recipe, you just need to remember that it takes a while to combine the cream cheese and the powdered sugar.  It is almost like kneading bread.  I took it out of the bowl and put it on wax paper to thoroughly mix.  I made molded rose mints with a Wilton candy mold, so I did not get 8 dz. from this recipe - I made about 40 mints.

What happened?  Mine never hardened, and I agree with the others that the flavor needs help. I will try again, however, but omiting the butter, as I think that kept the mints from being the texture I desired.  I colored them blue, and my 2 year old son thought they were blobs of toothpaste.

Another reader recommended using 1/2 teaspoon peppermint oil and 4 ounces cream cheese and it came out fabulous.  I also did a batch with anise oil and that came out fabulous too.  Next is going to be lemon!  :)

These tasted pretty good, but did not get hard! I chilled them as it says in the instructions. When I took them out of the fridge, they softened up and were kind of like balls of frosting. I followed this recipe carefully, and would really like to know where I could have gone wrong.

My daughter made these for the Holidays. Thankfully they were made far enough in advance that they had more time to dry.  2 days was not enough.  We placed them in clear cellophane bags and added them to our holiday cookie trays.  Would definitely make again.

I liked the idea of the recipe, but there wasn't enough peppermint. I would add 2 more drops of peppermint extract and use less sugar for better results.

AWESOME! Made several batches for an anniversary party. Went over great. Am going to use this recipe for a birthday party. You can use ANY SHAPE you want. I have found that the more different the better. What is really weird is the fact that some people love these if they have a different flavor.

My family loves butter mints, and this is a much "healthier" alternative to store-bought.  I used chopped, fresh mint instead of peppermint oil and stored them in the fridge.

Me and my dad made these mints. We tried the mixture and it wasn't pepperminty at all! We added 2 more drops of peppermint 1 more cup of sugar, 1 more ounce of cream cheese, and 4 drops of food coloring. Over all it wasn't that impressing but they turned out good. Add more peppermint oil as needed.

Made one recipe but used 4 ounces of cream cheese (1/2 of an 8 ounce block) and 1/4 t peppermint extract.  They were very good and a hit at my holiday luncheon.  I rolled the dough into small balls (probably about 1 t or less) and flattened with a fork like a peanut butter cookie.  It made about 30 of that size.

Good recipe. If you plan to use a candy mold it will need a little more sugar.. just enough so it isn't sticky. but if using a spritz press it worked well just as is. I made rum flavored also came out a nice compliment to the mint flavored ones.

Loved these!  I followed some of the other reviews and added a little more peppermint oil and I also used 4 oz. of cream cheese instead of 3.

yummy and really easy. We don't have a microwave so put the cream cheese and butter in a ziploc and soaked in hot water for 3 or 4 minutes to soften.  I dyed mine green and rolled into misshapen little balls. Will freeze and keep on hand for a little after dinner treat.

These are soo yummy!  Read a lot of the reviews and modified as such.  I used 4oz of cream cheese, 4 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. Mixed with hand mixer.  Then I "powder sugared" the counter each time I rolled out a golf ball sized piece and cut them into little squares!  Made sure to roll to the size I liked, but also making sure there was powdered sugar left on them so they wouldn't stick to each other and also so they would look pretty.  Halfway through, I added 2 drops of food coloring to the rest so I had some green and some white mints.  Very easy and yummy.  Messy, but fun with a 3 and 7 year old.

These are pretty good. I divided the dough into 3 parts, left one white and added green and red food coloring to the others. It took me about an hour and a half to roll all the dough into tiny little balls, but they look adorable and are quite tasty. The dough is much easier to work with after it has sat for a while and I did have to add about a 1/2 cup more of confectioner's sugar.

I used 4 oz of cream cheese, after reading other reviews.  These were tasty and cute for a baby shower!  I added just smidge of liquid red food coloring.  I served them as balls and "smushed" balls, I used a fork.  Very tasty!

I I helped friend of mine make these mints for her neice's wedding. She realized she didn't have he mold to make them in.  I suggested that we roll them in balls and mash them with a fork like "peanut butter cookies".  We didn't know we were basically "following directions" until I asked her to send me the recipe!  The flavor is excelent.  And they are so easy to make.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I made these for a baby shower last summer. I was a little nervous about how they'd go over because I didn't have any peppermint oil, so I just used peppermint extract. Also, I was slightly heavy-handed with the food coloring that I put in, and they were put-your-eyes-out blue. That didn't seem to be a deterrent to the guests...they ate and ate and ate them and then one of the guests asked me to make them for her daughter's wedding shower this spring. They do take a little time to make, but they're so yummy that they're totally worth it! :)

I was only making these for 2 people, so I split the recipe to 1/3 of the original. I had to add about 1/2 cup extra powdered sugar to get it to a thick enough consistency to work with. They turned out great though. My mom loved them and I will defintely make them again.

it tastes good but as other users have said, it is way too messy and sticky to work with no matter what i did, i dont think i will make this candy again unless i can figure out a way to make them look a little better
i made a few batches, all were colored mint green;  one batch was dipped in chocolate, one batch was drizzled in chocolate, one batch was plain with colored sugar
the candies wouldnt dry enough to handle, i even put it in the fridge for 30 minutes to no avail and i did use a dropper as i gave up rolling them in my hands very quickly as it was just too gooey

These were really great, but I did have some difficulty with the "dough".  I'm at a loss how some people were able to roll these into balls or press them into molds.  My dough was fairly thin (not runny, but not stiff...even after sitting out to "dry").  Although, all of that could have a lot to do with the fact that I used peppermint extract rather than peppermint oil and, therefore, had to add more liquid to the batter than the recipe calls for.  That being said, I piped the batter onto parchment paper and tossed them in the freezer in a sealed container.  Then once they were frozen, I melted some good dark chocolate and topped them off.  Then back to the freezer.  The recipe made a ton and I've still got quite a few in my freezer for a cool, minty snack.  I took some to work and those that had the chance to try them, loved them.  I will be making them again and maybe next time I'll remember to add more of the dry ingredients based on however much additional extract I add.  :)

These were delicious.  I made a double batch and colored the "dough" green, red, and left some white.  I served them at Christmas parties last year.  I did add extra peppermint     extract to taste.

These are so yummy! They are hard not to gobble up while you are making them! I used 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract and added a little powdered sugar as needed.  I was afraid to add the food coloring at first and rolled most of them in different colored sugars (I used red, green, yellow, and blue).  I got brave with the last dozen and split the dough in half and kneaded in a couple drops of food coloring paste (half red, half green)then rolled them in the same color sugar.  They were gorgeous that way!!!  I wish I would have made them all that way! Excellent recipe.  My 4 year old keeps wanting just one more!

abosolutely perfect! I first had these 12 years ago and was happy to find the recipe. They are delicious and melt in your mouth. They color very well to pastel colors. I have to make extra so I can eat them while I am preparing them. I find it easiest to roll the in to a small ball and then depress slightly with a spoon. So good!

These are really good. I give it 4 stars because they were messy and to soft to form into balls. I've made them 4 times and still, they are really sticky. They dont present well, but taste delicious.

The taste was excellent however, I could not get the to mold or press they were too sticky. I wasted the whole double batch.

These turned out too dry and too sweet for me. I followed the instructions exactly and used  peppermint oil but they did taste similar to toothpaste.

I made these mints last year for graduation but used vanilla extract instead. It gave them more of a sweet taste instead of a minty taste and they were still great. Thanks for the recipe.

These tasted great!  I used a candy mold, so did not get the 8 doz. but still a lot of mints.  Easy and delicious!

These were ok.  I had a hard time trying to form them with my hands, but this is the first time I've ever tried making mints from scratch.  I thought the taste was good and I too used peppermint extract instead of oil, but would use the oil next time if I could find it.  Thanks for sharing.

We did not care for these at all.  Way too sweet and not enough peppermint flavor even though I used way more than the recipe called for.  They were also very time consuming to make and difficult to mix to taste no better than they did.

This is the best recipe.  Every where I take these mints atleast 5 people as me for the recipe.  If you add a little bit if vanilla (1/8 tsp) it will cut the mint a little bit.

easy and delicious.  I added 1/2 tsp of peppermint because I couldn't taste it enough after a few drops.  But best to start with a few drops as indicated and add to your liking.  
These will be part of my Christmas food baskets for neighbors.

I by no means can cook nor bake so these could've turned out better.  They tasted so good.  I read the reviews about dipping them into chocolate to make them taste like York peppermint patties. I totally agree with them. I made them as a gift and didn't have the time to do so. I recommended that they do so and I will when I make them again.

I made these vegan using Trader Joe's vegan cream cheese and miyoko's vegan butter.  The dough really needs a lot of powdered sugar to be manageable and you should treat it like you would cookie dough...roll it in your hand really well before putting it on the cookie sheet. Whole fam loved it. Cannot tell it was vegan at all.

I have been making these since I received the recipe card in a mail pack 20 years ago. My children are all grown up and still come home at Christmas and look for these. These are an essential part of Christmas, light little bites are perfect to finish off supper, or to have in pretty  crystal dishes scattered around the house.

Excellent!   Good in small bites.  Creamy, almost fudge-like.  In fact, some thought it was white fudge!  I did use 1/4 tsp pure peppermint extract because I didn't have peppermint oil on hand.  Everyone loved these.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe. I have used it several times and I adjusted ingredients as other reviewers suggested, but they turned out best when I did the butter, cream cheese and powdered sugar as written, but I do add more peppermint oil then what is called for. I make these with mint molds. Everyone loves them and asks me to make them for all our baby showers.

So the taste is fantastic, but I lost track of my number of cups of sugar (I used the whole 8 block & sized the recipe to 40 so it'd use the whole 8 oz block, which meant 7.5 cups of sugar) and I don't think I put enough sugar bc it never got solid enough to truly be like a dough, which is what I think it SHOULD be like. Word to the wise, pre-measure all your sugar into a big dish first, don't be like me :)

So old school...My mom made these growing up and we loved loved them.  She had a bunch of different molds (leafs, hearts, etc) and she'd also make different flavored ones such as vanilla, red hot cinnamon, etc., not just mint, and she'd add food coloring to match (green for mint "leaves," etc.). We didn't get as many as we wanted because she made them for bridge parties or garden club meetings.

This recipe was SO simple to make and was a huge hit with my family.  I took about 1/5 of the recipe and rolled it into a snake/log shape and then just took a knife and cut it into pieces.  I didn't flatten with a fork (one more step it didn't need!).  I let it dry overnight and then popped them in the freezer.  Personally I like them best frozen.  I needed to add way more peppermint extract though (probably closer to 1/8 tsp or more) and we found the more minty the better they were.

I just made these. They taste great (except for one minor detail I'll mention in a bit)! I used peppermint extract, though I'm not sure how much. I LOVE peppermint, so I threw it in till it suited my tastes. I also added extra sugar because it was too sticky. One thing I wish I hadn't done was use 4 ounces of cream cheese that other reviewers suggested. My mints have a bit of a tangy cream cheese flavor that I could do without. Otherwise, the taste is great! Next time, I would make them according to the recipe and hope they wouldn't be as tangy. They are a bit of a pain to roll into balls and take a bit of time (and don't look too perdy), but I'd say they are worth it!

Tried this before sticking exactly to the recipe but my mints needed A LOT more powdered sugar to be workable with the molds. Tried them again, this time essentially doubling and using the ratios MariaMou suggested and it worked like a charm!! Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe as other members suggested by using 4 oz. of cream cheese. I also increased the peppermint extract to a heaping 1/2 tsp. I didn't have powdered sugar so I used regular sugar which made my mints very grainy, but that's not the fault of the recipe! My mints were very sticky and hard to work with but the flavor was very good! Similar to a 'York Peppermint Pattie' candy, just without the chocolate coating! I didn't add any food coloring. I will have to try it again using powdered sugar and adding more powdered sugar until it's less sticky!

This recipe is made very easy by using a food processor.  I used peppermint extract (which is alcohol and peppermint oil) and it required much more than two drops.  The extra moisture required just a little more powdered sugar as a result (maybe 1/4 cup?).  I rolled them in granulated sugar to help me form them into balls.  I also put them in the freezer for an hour, and then dipped them in chocolate (with a little shortening mixed in) and the results were delicious!

This was a very interesting recipe. I made these mints for Christmas, and I'm just not sure if the measurements are correct as listed. Does cream cheese come in packages of 8oz? I had to guestimate how much 3 oz was and with 3 cups of confectioner's sugar I had to give it a little more cream cheese. I will try again though and I appreciate having a simple mint recipe. It's always fun to try and make your own instead of buying them! Thank you!

Excellent mints.   Even my anti-candy boyfriend loved them.  It has to be pretty good to temp him.  I used food coloring and made a double batch so I could make green, red, and white.  The white mints were the easiest to form since they did not have the added moisture of food coloring.  If you are using extract or food coloring I would suggest a touch extra powdered sugar to avoid sticky handling.  I rolled them in cane sugar before forking them.  Also extra peppermint is a must!

These were made for my birthday, and they are very good.  They really have a cream cheese taste.  (More than a minty taste.)  And they are best chilled. Yum!

These are so tatsty!  I made two batches, one with mint extract and one with peppermint extract.  I used a half teaspoon in each.  While the half tsp. was fine for the mint, it was too strong for the peppermint.  So I just made a larger batch of the peppermint to mellow it out.  I use my pampered chef cookie press with the ribbon disk.  I made long ribbons, cut them into rectangles, and then cut the rectangles in half making 1" squares.  I then coated them with sugar.  Worked nicely and quickly.

This recipe TASTES very good, but I have yet to be able to make mints out of them. I have already added 3 extra cups of sugar, refrigerated overnight - yet they are still to hard to work with!! I don't know what's going on!!

I made these about five minutes ago!! They are FANTASTIC.  I couldn't believe how easy they were.  I substituted the oil for extract (adding a little to taste) but the consistency with 3 oz of cream cheese was perfect!!  Try rolling them in Holiday, red and green sprinkles along with the food coloring, it looks great!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this recipe last weekend for my family Christmas party and received many compliments on the mints.  I found this recipe very easy to make and had no problems.  I did modify the recipe by adding 3-4 drops of peppermint extract instead of peppermint oil.

These are very good and easy to make.  I think I used just a tad too much peppermint extract though.  Give the dough time to mix, it starts out very crumbly.  I used a mini ice-cream scoop, then divided each in half and was able to get about 4-1/2 dozen mints.  After pressing down, I sprinkled a little confectioner's sugar on them.

These were good, but they were so rich and thick that everyone who had them could only eat one (except my brother, The Iron Stomach). Chocolate coating goes well with it, but I'm not very good at doing that, so mine looked funny.

The mints have good flavor, but were very hard to make!  I used peppermint extract instead of oil, and also couldn't get the food coloring to take!  Everyone enjoyed eating them when I was done, but I'm not sure it was worth all the work.
