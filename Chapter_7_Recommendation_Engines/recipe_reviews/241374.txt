Lovely, the salsa taste really comes through so judge the spice level of salsa in it accordingly.  Would probably add some fresh garlic and just put the rice in the soup mixture to cook next time.

The soup is as good as the brand of salsa you choose to put in it, I used homemade salsa.  Definitely top it with lots of shredded cheese!

Change out chopped for crushed tomatoes, tomato soup for sauce.  Forget the salsa and corn, add two cans of mixed veges.  This doesn't have to cook forever, maybe 15 minutes then add rice and serve.
