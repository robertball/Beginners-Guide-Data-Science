I had to change my previous review because now I love these!  I use 5 TBSP honey instead of corn syrup and I also add a few TBSP of ground Flaxseed.  If you make these and they come out too crumbly, try adding more peanut butter.  I don't use marshmallows, but add 1/2 cup toasted chopped almonds and 1 cup choc. chips.  I make these so much that I had to start buying the ingredients in bulk at costco!  I have a 14 lb bag of chocolate chips in my cupboard!

I have tried every granola bar recipe on Allrecipes.com searching for a flexible, adaptable snack bar, that is enough like store-bought that my kids will eat them, but which is still better for them (sugar/bad fat-wise). THESE ARE A SUCCESS! I used mini-chocolate chips and chopped nuts in 1/2 the batch, and white chocolate chips, almonds, and dried cranberries in the other 1/2. I baked each seperately in a 11x7 pan and they turned out great--not too dry, chewy, and held together well.

I would like to thank you for this recipe.  I have made many different versions of it. . . I have about 20 flavors so far and have tried several, I make a new one each week.  I vary the ingredients considerably, but your recipe was the inspiration.  I like the high protein in this bar.  It sticks with you.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I've made it several times.  Once my mother-in-law tasted them at my house, now she asks me to bring these chewy granola to all of our family gatherings!  She raves about them to everyone she knows who enjoys healthy foods.  The rest of my family loves them too, especially my 3 young boys (age 9, 6 and 3).  THANK YOU for your creativity!

These were so easy to make.  The kids absolutely love them and they are way cheaper (and better for them) than the store-bought variety.  With todays' economy I need to save wherever I can.  We try different add-ins, fruits, nuts, flavors.  It's all good.

Addicting! I did not have quite enough peanut butter, so I topped off the measuring cup with (about a tablespoon) honey. The only other sub I made was to do walnuts instead of marshmallows. They are a little crumbly so next time I will try pushing them into the pan a little harder, to make them more compact and something you can eat on the go. I did cut the recipe in half and cooked in my 8x8 pan for exactly 25 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were very good, however I gave them 4 stars because if I had added all of the dry ingredients listed, it would have been far too crumbly.  I only used 2.5 cups of rolled oats, 1/3 cup of wheat germ and omitted the cereal all together.  I used dark instead of milk chocolate chips because that's what I had and I think it would have been better with Milk chocolate chips.  I could taste the applesauce a bit.  A bit.  If I did not know it was in there I would probably just wonder what that slight flavor was and continue eating it though.    I will definately make again.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I used honey in place of corn syrup which has a similar consistancy. I added some milk chocolate chips and white chocolate chips to mine and I made a few extras plain for my husband. Once cooled, I wrapped these individually so we can grab them on the go. I tried this recipe because of the great ingredients, especially the peanut butter and the addition of chocolate chips. Delicious!

This recipe comes together so easily, it's a great one for the kids to help with! They are healthy and homemade- which makes me feel good about feeding them to my children. I shared the recipe with my grandma and she has been making them with other types of cereal which turned out great. My only complaint is that the bars are too crumbly.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  Mine did not stay packed together like I had hoped and I even added some honey trying to get them to stick.  My 5 and 2 year olds were not crazy about it at all though.  I didn't have any chocolate chips so that was omitted.  Great recipe that I will make again!  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  I like to keep my kiddos' snacks healthy and this recipe is one way I achieve that.  I substitute honey for the corn syrup and milled flaxseed for the wheat germ.  Make sure and reduce the time to 23 - 25 minutes.  They brown quick at the end of baking.  I bake a pan, cool, then cut into bars.  I put each bar into a snack-size ziplock bag, then all of them go into a gallon-size freezer bag.  My kiddos know to grab one in the morning and it is thawed out by snack time at school.

I made a few changes to make them a little less sugary and maybe a little "lighter". I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, Trader Joe's organic chunky peanut butter, homemade SF maple syrup instead of corn syrup, homemade organic applesauce, dried blueberries instead of chocolate chips (the submitter of this recipe suggests to change out the chocolate chops and marshmallows with dried fruit and nuts if you would like, which I did), and I cut the wheat germ back to a heaping 1/3 cup Wheat Germ because I read a lot of reviews that claimed these bars were crumbly. Now, I baked these for 20 minutes at 350 and they were really well done. I don't know how to get the chewy consistancy of granola bars because it seems that even when I cut the time back, they're overdone. I don't mind them being crumbly, it's just I would like them to be chewy sometimes. I got eighteen bars, just like the recipe stated. I cut them up and individually wrapped them and stuck them in the freezer for weekly lunches and snacks. I get 18 organic bars for less than two bucks for the whole batch instead of almost five dollars for six. Not bad.

Followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of replacing the corn syrup with honey because I am allergic to corn in any form. I thought the flavor was good but as other reviewers stated, the bars came out crumbly. I will try adding more peanut butter next time to see if it makes a difference. Also, after baking for 25 minutes, the outter edges of the granola were almost starting to burn..so I think I will reduce the amount of cook time as well. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I know I will be trying these again!

These are very good and quick and easy to prepare.  I can definatley see how the recipie can be varied easily.  I used rice krispies as my cereal and skipped out on the marshmellows - the rest was the same

Yum! Just as good, if not better, than store bought. Thank you soo much for this basic recipe.   I used 1/4 cup sugar free maple syrup and 1/4 cup honey in place of the corn syrup.  Other swaps: 1/4 cup brown sugar, broken graham crackers instead of cereal, part raisins part almonds for the marshmallows, ground flaxseed for wheat germ, and added a scoop of whey protein powder.  I pressed the mix firmly into the pan before baking (27 minutes at 350) and I had no crumble issues. I cannot wait to try it with nutella and broken oreos!

This recipe is very easy and very good! My daughter is allergic to peanut butter so I made it with sunbutter.  A little crumbly so I will add more sunbutter next time like someone else suggested about adding more PB.  Overall, very good.

These were fantastic; we really enjoyed them.  I was just looking for a way to use up some extra wheat germ.  The only downside was that they are kind of crumbly, definitely not eating in the car material.  But as far as healthy and tasty go, five stars all the way.

Very tasty! I've been trying to find a more cost effective alternative to my family's favorite lunchbox snack; chewy granola bars from the grocery store. These are perfect! I didn't have any cheerios, so I used golden grahams instead. The bars tasted like S'mores! Delicious! I also used honey instead of corn syrup. I reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes, then turned off the oven and let the bars stay in the oven another 5 minutes. They turned out perfect! The kids are flocking to the kitchen to try the first batch!

The taste gets 5 starts, but I agree with other reviewers that they are a little too crumbly.  However, the recipe is extremely versatile! I wonder if adding an egg would help them be less crumbly, but have yet to try that variation.  So far my fave variation of this recipe is using almond instead of peanut butter, adding a tsp of cinnamon, replacing the marshmallows, Cheerios, and chocolate chips with a cup (combined total) of craisins, slivered almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin kernels, and flax seeds. Delish!

Too sweet for me, but I can see myself liking these with something other than chocolate chips and marshmallows--say, with cranberries or nuts I'd probably really like them.  They are too crumbly, though--I was having a hard time getting them out of the pan whole--so I think I'd have to add more Karo syrup and/or peanut butter to address that.  Otherwise, though, a decent granola bar recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure what we did wrong. Mine came out really undercooked in the middle and didn't have nearly enough "granola" texture-- like grainy chocolate chip cookie dough.  Off to keep looking for the right one.

Nice recipe.  I've been baking another bar,  and I'm really into those.  A little faster than these and little healthier.  I'll save this recipe for special occasions.

My boyfriend and I love these! :) I've made them twice so far and I love experimenting and having fun adding random ingredients in there! They're a great healthy snack and the texture is perfect. :) The 9x13 pan lasts us almost a month, and they stay nice and chewy the whole time. :)

It's great as is, and if I'm missing some ingredients, I can substitute honey for the syrup, oil for applesauce, flax for some of the wheat germ, extra cheerios for marshmallows, add nuts...  I press firmly with waxed paper under my hand both before and immediately after taking out of oven for best hold together-ness.

Eh. The concept is great, this was one of the recipe with the least amount of crazy ingredients and quickest turn around times. The flavor was very iffy for me. They were hard to swallow, very dense. They do hold up well though. Maybe try it with a little coconut next time?! I am not sure. My kids did not like them very much but my husband took them on a hike and enjoyed them. I am unsure, all I can say is Eh.

My kids loved these.  I added dried cranberries and melted chocolate on top after they came out of the oven to make them more like the ones from the store and my kids loved them.  I will say that they were a bit messy.

These were good i added whole peanuts as well as an extra 1/4c of peanut butter. But i think the corn syrup was a little to sweet and i will try just honey next time!

They were great not too sweet.  Instead of corn syrup I used 5 table spoons of honey.  I added 2 table spoons of ground flax seed and 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes.  I did not use the marshmallows.

These turned out great. I didn't have any problem with them falling apart. I did add a 1/4 cup more of peanut butter and pressed them very well into the pan. This may have helped them hold together. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Did I do something wrong?  Maybe I cooked them for too long because they came out thick and dry with almost no flavor. I couldn't taste the peanut butter at all... definitely won't make again.

The bars were too dry and didn't have much flavor. Not chewy at all! They were more brick/crumbly-like. You must drink some tea with these to help them go down.

These have an awesome flavor, but they definitely don't hold together like I was hoping. I was making these for a weekend trip, and needed them to be something that the kids can easily eat in their seats while riding in the car, and they're so crumbly that they require a bowl. Next time, I will use far less dry ingredients and press it down very firmly into the dish - not lightly.

These are fantastic.  I made quite a few changes, the 1st time I used honey instead of corn syrup, but the last several times I used Brown Rice Syrup and that has turned out wonderful!  I also add in about a 1/4 cup of flax seed meal, a cup of slivered almonds and remove the marshmallows and oat rings. Also makes a great white chocolate & macadamia nut.   Fantastic recipe.

I love granola bars andI had high hopes. I followed the recipe but these bars came out as crumbs and a little dry. Not bad to sprinkle over ice cream. I will dry it again playing with the ingredients and quantities.

I didn't particularly like this recipe,however, I didn't have rolled oats and used old fashioned oats instead. I'm not sure if that made a difference or not, which is why I gave it the benefit of the doubt, otherwise I would have given it 2 stars.  Some of the other reviewers were right. It doesn't hold together very well and was kind of dry. Too bad because I was hoping to have a healthy snack for my 2 year old.  He took one look at it and just said, "No!" I won't be making this again.
