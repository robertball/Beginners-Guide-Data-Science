I cooked this in the crock pot all day (8 hours - 6 lbs) after marinating it for 5 days. WOW! Excellent falvor! I have made this in the past and it turned out tough - the crockpot is the way to go! Made the gravy with Nabisco Ginger Snaps - A real hit at our German themed dinner party. I also served spatsel, red cabbage, mashed potatoes and sourdough rolls with Lingonberry jam. Excellent!

My husband bemoaned the closing of his favorite German restaurant so it was time to hit Allrecipes and try to make it myself.  Thank you so much Chris for submitting your grandmother's recipe.  This was surprisingly easy to make.  Do make sure to get roast whose sell by date includes the marinating days, the cooking day, and an extra day if you'll have enough for leftovers.  Husband took a hammer to the ginger snaps in a plastic bag to get them finely crushed as I didn't want to use the food processor; he seemed to enjoy contributing to the cause.  The ginger snaps are essential to the flavor and quickly thickened the gravy; my inner child enjoyed that part though I must admit I'm easily amused. Make sure to remove the solids first as directed.  The meat was wonderfully flavored, tender and delightfully falling apart.  The gravy was so delicious I used an almost sinful amount and was tempted to lick the plate.  This was fabulous! Five stars don't do it justice. Husband was thrilled it turned out so well and emphatic that it was better than the German restaurant's. We will definitely be making this again.  By the way, serving with German Red Cabbage, also on this site, was a must have combination.  Not wanting to tackle too much, I wimped out on the potato dumplings and just served with basic scratch made mashed potatoes. Now that I know this is so easy, maybe next time I'll take on the potato dumplings.

This was my first attempt at making sauerbraten and it turned out delicious! The flavor was mouthwatering and the gingersnaps made all the difference with the flavor. A very nice balance... It was extremely tender, but I wonder if I should slice the meat into serving portions before marinating in the spices? It just fell apart when it was time to serve, it was so tender! YUM. Total comfort food. :)

Delicious recipe as written. My Oma's recipe, had the following tiny differences. 
Marinade: sliced onions, not chopped. She added a crushed clove of garlic, an extra ½ cup of both water & vinegar, used freshly cracked black PEPPERCORNS and added ½ teaspoon WHOLE allspice with the whole cloves and bay leaves. She always said: Keep things big, so straining them out is easier.
Oma used a covered crock & a plate to marinate the meat in the ice box (I use a gigantic plastic bag in the fridge, today.)
She started sauerbraten marinating on a Monday... made an excellent Sunday dinner with red cabbage, potato dumplings & apple strudel.

This is one fantastic recipe for sauerbraten.   I made the sauerbraten twice within a period of two (2) weeks.  I'm ready to make another batch.  The family loves it!  The only changes I made were:  (1) added about a teaspoon of granulated garlic to the marinate; (2) used chuck roast rather than rump roast due to a cost savings of $1 per pound;  (3) strained the solids from the marinate before cooking the beef; (4) "finely chopped" the ginger snap cookies in a food processor, rather than "crumble"; (5) whisked the finely chopped ginger snap cookies in enough water to make a smooth consistency (like mayonnaise); then, added to the marinate when making the gravy; (6) added a few splashes of apple cider vinegar, as necessary, to have plenty of gravy.
 
I served the sauerbraten on a bed of spaetzle egg noodles, with two (2) sides:  homemade German/Polish potato pancakes; applesauce.

As a side note:  Before eating the second batch, my wife and I intentionally stopped at a restaurant that is known for its sauerbraten.   Although it was very-very good, the sauerbraten recipe herein is as good or better.

Chris Simpler this recipe was so tasty delicious!! I followed the recipe to a T but marinated for 5 days & used a crockpot on low for 6 hours for 3lbs of roast & oh goodness was it delicious, I can't wait to make it again. This was the first time I attempted it for my husband who loves sauerbraten & he thought it was better than his mothers (WIN!!) I made the sauerbraten along with Kartoffel Kloesse Potato Dumplings http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Kartoffel-Kloesse-Potato-Dumplings & Grandma Jeanette's Amazing German Red Cabbage http://http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grandma-Jeanettes-Amazing-German-Red-Cabbage [which are also both 5 star recipes] they all complimented each other it was an amazing meal!!

This takes some advance planning but is SO worth the effort!  I browned mine and then cooked it in a crock pot....yum! So the day of the meal really did not take a lot of time or effort, and it made a wonderful family meal!  We have a traditional German restaurant close by - and this is even better than theirs!  Will be making this one again and again.

This was our first experience with sauerbraten.  The flavours were good but I had a couple of problems. First of all it came out soooo dry. The gravy helped but I don't think gravy should be a rescue.  The gingersnaps are supposed to be crumbled. I would say they need to be crushed into bread crumb consistancy. I had some crumbles that were a little too big and it made my gravy lumpy. I had to strain it. It also didn't thicken as I thought it should so I had to add more.  I may try this again but try to figure out how to make the meat more tender. Glad we tried it. My apologies for not loving it. Maybe next time. Thanks Chris.

My whole family came over for German
night last night . I made this version of the sauerbraten for a change. ( have an old recipe from Germany from the 70's when we lived there.) I have to say this was a REALLY BIG HIT! All of my kids have lived in Germany and really enjoy German food. They raved about the dish.
I marinated  it for 5 days. I did brown it in a skillet but then used the marinade to  deglaze the pan, did not want to lose any of the goodness. I did use the crock pot since I had to make Brotchen and Black Forest cake also. Turned out tender and very tasty.  The Gingersnaps have to be very fine before adding to the gravy and the longer you cook the gravy the better to get a very flavorful and smooth blend. 
Thank you Chris for this delightful and easy recipe!!

This was very good in spite of the problems I had with it.  I followed it exactly.  After two hours of cooking on low on the stove, I smelled it burning and was shocked that most of the liquid was gone.  I added some water. When I made the gravy, I am not sure I had enough liquid because the gravy was way too thick after a few minutes on the stove.  I had to strain it and then add water.   I was worried it had all been ruined, but it tasted good.  I would like to try this again, but I would like to try cooking it in the oven or in the crockpot.
***i tried it with the slow cooker, and it was great.  After it cooked for about 7 hours on low, I strained the liquid and put it in a pot on the stove.  I finished making the gravy on the stovetop.  If there were clumps from the ginger snaps, I squished them with the back of a spoon.

Wow - Made per recipe except I used the crockpot as some suggested.  I used a rump roast (on sale), browned on all sides and then cooked on low for four hours.  I did pulverize the gingersnaps in a plastic bag and the gravy came together quickly - smooth and creamy.  I served with red cabbage and green beans almondine.  Next time I will cut in half the pepper (just for my personal taste).  I love anything with a vinegar type marinade as it is so flavorful.  I marinaded for 3-days just in a plastic bag.  Thanks Chris for sharing a great recipe!!

I have never had sauerbraten before but figured it was would be something new to make and try. I consumed a massive serving of this dish and was incredibly full but the amazing flavor had me grabbing another serving of it and I am already thawing out another roast to make some more. 10/10 would eat until overly full until stomache ache levels again!

I was nervous to make this my Oma always was not okay with the sauerbraten recipes that include the gingersnaps. But it was great!!!!  Everyone loved it.  My fussy uncle said it needed raisins, so maybe I will add those next time. I served with noodles. Oh and I used the crock pot.

My boyfriend and I recently hosted a German themed Christmas party.  We made this in a crock pot and used flour to thicken the gravy instead of ginger snaps.  It was a tremendous success!

Loved this recipe!    Aunt Elenor used to make this, I always wondered why it took her days.  Our family were farmers near Koln.   So I thought I'd give it a try.   I slow cooked and marinated for 4+ days.   I also added 1 smashed garlic clove, 2 1/2 c red wine, about 3/4 c red wine vineger which ended up with 3c strained marinade.  This was a 3# round steak that I cook in my slow cooker 9 hours.   I didn't want to waste marinade so I slowly added 12 crushed ginger snaps to make the ausumm gravy.  Delicious and even Better the 2nd day!   I'll try the spatzle next time also.   Thanks so much Chris !

I will definitely make this again. I only marinated it for 2 days but it turned our very flavorful. When adding the crushed gingersnaps to the strained broth I really didnt think it would turn into gravy but it was deep dark brown and very smooth. Yummy comfort meal with mashed potatoes and red cabbage.

We loved it!  My changes whew red wine and balsamic vinegar, half and half, which is what I had on hand. Gravy thickened beautifully. Served with red cabbage and steamed apples. Will freeze leftovers for holiday visitors. I had chuck roast but will use less fatty cut as suggested next time.

This was amazing! I've never made sauerbraten before, so I was nervous that after waiting for 5 days (that's how long I marinaded it) I wouldn't like it. I shouldn't have worried. My husband and I were both impressed. Incredibly flavorful and the perfect meal on a rainy winter day. Thanks!

Thank you for sharing your grandmother's recipe. My grandmother was born in Germany and she made this on special occasions. It was a family favorite!  I wish I had her recipe.  Every time I crave sauerbraten I'd have to go to my favorite German restaurant. No more!  Your recipe came out perfect!  The only changes I made were adding a little pickling spice and some red wine (I used 5 lbs of meat). I also cooked it in a slow cooker on low for 8-9 hours. It came out just like my grandmother's sauerbraten - tender and tasty! Brought me back to my childhood.  Danke schön!! :)

Holy  this freaking amazing! Seriously I have no words for how amazing this was. Thank you so much! I studied abroad in Germany  I find this to be comfort food. Since we are finally getting some cold and snow I thought it was time for a nice hearty meal. This was quite easy to make. I marinated it in my crock pot as I don't have a dutch oven big enough. I did add some extra red wine vinegar to the marinade because I love it. Then I browned it in  skillet and put it back in my crock pot for about 7 hours.  Don't forget to let it rest before you slice it. It was very tender and just made my tongue explode with flavor.

I made this for a dinner party and it was absolutely delicious. Almost everyone that attended asked for the recipe. The only changes I made was to substitute Chicken Broth for the water and cook the meat and marinade on low in a crock pot for a little over six hours.

Easy to make and tasted good but a little too spicy/hot for us (recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of black pepper).  Will make it again but will only add 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  Thanks for sharing!

I am born and raised in Germany and boooy I miss the good old German kitchen. 

this did it!!

I made a few little changes/adjustments such as increased water and vinegar by a half cup each.. replaced the cookies with flour and a little cold water.. just enough to water it down clumb free.. as well added about a half a cup red wine..

wow this was soooo delicious and loved by wife and picky kids ;)

This was a total win. I used the Nabisco Gingersnaps for the gravy, and that made the meal. Have saved this recipe and will be making it again for sure.

TABIJO just cut down on the amount of black pepper you use. I think 1Tbsp. is too much. I would give it another try if I were you using much less pepper. Otherwise this is a great recipe.

I made this in a crock pot with an eye of round roast. I cooked it for 5 hours. It was outstanding. However, eye of round is very lean. After 5 hours, it was relatively tender but it could have used a couple more hours.

Overall, it was delicious. My family loved it. One of my sons had three helpings. This will become a regular dinner.

I made this for Christmas dinner last year, and it was a hit with my German best friend (comparable to his Mother's he said!). I did it in a slow cooker. The gravy is delicious. I made the sauerbraten along with Potato Dumplings & Grandma Jeanette's Amazing German Red Cabbage (both from this site). I'm making it again this year per his request. It beats any Sauerbraten I've eaten at restaurants.

We loved it -- served it for an Oktoberfest dinner,  and especially loved the gravy.  First, our marinade was modified by adding a half-cup of dry red wine, and we let it soak for 3 days.  Used a dutch oven to roast it on the stove top and it took (for 3 lbs) at least a good 3 to 3.5  hours, and cooked on low heat. It went straight from the refrigerator into the pan, so it might take less time if it sits for a bit before any cooking is done.  The 10 crushed ginger snaps were just the right amount, and the gravy was a perfect consistency -- not to runny, not too thick. It was very  flavorful, and a popular item at our dinner.

I'm sorry to be the person to give this recipe less than 5 stars.... I WANTED this to be as delicious as the rest of the reviewers thought.  MY sauerbraten was SO spicy-hot that it was hard to take.  Yes, it was also sour, but man oh man, it was spicy too!  I have NO IDEA which spice made it spicy... I can only surmise that the 2 onions sitting in the vinegar emitted heat ... or maybe it was the vinegar?  I have no idea but I did have to cut the gravy with water due to the heat (which really didn't help).  We could hardly eat it and I've been informed by my husband that he will NOT eat the leftovers.  So I have half of a $15 roast sitting in my fridge which won't be eaten, apparently.  Bummer.  I made with red cabbage and potato dumplings which were both delish.

I just made my German grandmother recipe. She came from Bavarian part of Germany, arriving in this country in the 1880's; bringing with her many German recipes including the German made potato balls.  This recipe is just the closest I've seen to her recipe.I don't strain the cooked marinade, just continue with gingersnaps, molasses. I also don't pre-flour the meat; just brown it , after I marinade it 1 day per pound

The roast came out very well seasoned and tender. It was too tangy for my taste. I think it i had substituted beef broth for some of the wine vinegar it would have tasted less tangy.

Very tasty! I only marinated the roast for  4 hours, because I had cut the roast into large (1/2 pound) chunks, but the flavor was wonderful! Having smaller pieces meant that I didn't cook it as long.This one's a keeper!

Only thing I did different was to use Beef Stew Meat. I used a high quality Angus but chose the stew meat to absorb the marinade quicker (only 3 days) and it came out AMAZING! The whole family and some neighbors loves it with homemade spatzel!

Made this. Soooo good. Never had it before, but will be making it very often now. The ginger snaps added at the end definitely make it! Not the same without the cookies. I could drink the sauce! Thank you for this easy recipe that turns tougher cuts of beef into mouthwatering fork tender deliciousness!

Very authentic recipe. I’m actually kind of impressed with myself lol. I used white wine vinegar because it was all I had. I CRUMBED the cookies (I used a German brand). I had a 3lb. rump roast marinated for 4 days. I cooked it in a crock pot with all the marinade, including solids. One reviewer said they cooked it on low for 6 hours. Mine was done in 4 and a little dry but the meat was delicious and the gravy amazing! Definitely making this again. I lived in Germany as a child and this brought back good memories. Thank you so much for sharing. Served it with red cabbage and spatezle.

Thank you Chris Simpler! Nashville Tennessee has a lot to do but good German food is not one of them. This was no doubt the best I’ve ever had. I injected a rump roast and marinated it 5 days. Thanks again!

I recognized the flavors of sauerbraten, but they were hidden under all that pepper.  We couldn't even eat the sauce!  So disappointed.  I'm guessing a much shorter cooking time might help.

This was delicious, I'll be doubling the amount of marinade next time though. I am also going to try adding some of the ingredients I've found listed in other 'authentic' recipes like juniper berries, carrots, a leek, because I think it can use more veggies as well.

Delicious !  My first time making this dish, and coming from a German family with both maternal and paternal Oma's who made sauerbraten, the pressure was on !  Well, we were not disappointed !  The gravy came out just as I had remembered !   The meat was a little dry, but that was my fault for overclocking it, and nothing that the gravy could not fix.  Thank you for sharing this delicious  recipe !!!

The marinade flavored the meat beautifully, but simmering the roast on low for that length of time completely scorched the roast. I couldn’t use the marinade to make the gravy. Next time I’ll pop the roast in the crockpot and try that mode of cooking.

With three days of preparation. Careful cooking and specific focus on the gravy, this was absolutely delicious.
I served it with home-made German potato salad and sauerkraut. Clearly consumed with Spaten...

This Sauerbraten recipe is wonderful. I made it a few days ago and it was so worth the marination wait time.  It was tender, aromatic and full of delicious flavor. Now I don't have to go all the way up to my favorite German restaurant in Milwaukee for great sauerbraten. Thanks Chris!

I absolutely love Sauerbraten and after making this recipe, so did everyone else at the dinner.  I made it as directed in a slow cooker which worked great and made it super easy.  The gravy is heaven! We served it with homemade spaetzle, roasted brussel sprouts and sauerkraut.

My sauerbraten had a bit of a strong vinegar flavor.  I will try it again with a little less vinegar.  I used a Dutch oven on the stove top but many cooks had success with the crock pot.  I will use that next time.  Disappointed it didn’t taste as good as expected, but I will try again.  Thank you for the recipe

I have never made Sauerbraten before.  This recipe was easy to follow and I didn't change a thing. We had it over buttered noodles which turned out to be a perfect compliment to the dish.  People couldn't get enough of it, and we have had requests for this dish at every gathering we have hosted since.

Fabulous!  My husband said this meal was comparable to any he had in Germany!  I made german potato salad (extra bacon), potato dumplings and red cabbage.  The gravy turned out well.  Glad I pulverized the ginger snaps.

This turned out amazing.  I substituted balsamic vinegar for the wine vinegar because it brought a little sweetness to the party.  I served it with spetzle and  pickled red cabbage with a chopped up granny smith apple and chopped onions.   A nice loaf of crusty bread rounded out the meal.  Everyone loved it.

Followed the directions, had no problems. It came out pretty close to how my grandfather use to make it. Unfortunately, my local grocery store only had one brand of Gingersnaps at the time and I think it lacked slightly on the spicy sour taste as I use to remember, but overall this recipe was great and it satiated my craving for one of my all time favorite German meals.

A fun and easy dish to make.  Taste the marinade to get the acidic balance correct.  I'd recommend that you don't flour the meat prior to browning.  By doing so, you'll avoid burning the flour.  When you get to the gravey do as recommended, but add cookies to taste then a slurry to thicken.  I served on top of egg noodles, providing a base to hold the amazing gravey.  Serve with German Red cabbage and apple sauce and your guests will be asking to meet the German chef.

Browned in a skillet and cooked in a covered clay pot for 5 hours at 210°. I've made this recipe before with a Dutch oven stovetop but the slow low bake made the meat more rich. Yummy.

Fantastic; very true to authentic taste.  I simmered 4 hours.  I put gravy in fridge overnight along with roast.  Next day, heated up meat and dumped the fat layer on gravy.  Really delicious.  I had bought all the spices in a bag from a German deli so maybe that was the key ingredient.  I serve with homemade Rotkohl - pickled red cabbage and spaetzle.

I marinated the meat for 3 days, and cooked it in the crock pot. Instead of using the marinade in the crock pot, I added some spices to some red wine vinegar plus beef broth. It was very tender and the gravy was good and crazy easy! I wasn't sure about the gingersnaps but it wasn't overly sweet and gave it a good flavor and texture.

I add some dry red wine to the marinade and let it sit for 3-4 nights.  I use a chuck roast and cook it for 3 hours at most. It comes out in tender slices, not stringy or dry.

Fabulous! !  My friend grew up in a German/immigrant family, and Sauerbraten has been a family tradition of generations.  I never presumed that I could replicate his great grandmothers, passed down version, being a closely guarded secret.   When I recently had most of the ingredients dropped in my lap, I thought .. what the heck.. lets try it!  He and I made it together.  We followed the recipe to the tee.  Well, sort of.  We used Venison roast that had been languishing in the freezer.  This was SPOT ON Fabulous!! The only thing that I will change next time?  Is triple the marinade, so that I can triple the gingersnap gravy. We shared with about 8 people, and I'm getting RAVE reviews.  Thank you so much, for tis recipe! Hearts delight! It's a "must Serve" with Jennet's  German Red Cabbage from this site!

Made it for my husband and some guests!!  They raved about it so I'd say it was a hit!!  It was my first attempt at German food.  Used the crockpot as someone suggested.  Will make again.  I used eye of round and it was tender and moist.  Used the traditional German red cabbage recipe and it was a great side along with spaetzle!!

Not sure how this is supposed to taste but to me it was vinegar beef in cookie gravy. The tastes were so off that we threw it out that night which was disappointing since it smelled pretty good and the cookies were tasty by themselves. I'm not sure we're going to try any variation of this recipe again.
