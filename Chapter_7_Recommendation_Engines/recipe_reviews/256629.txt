Never put cherry tomatoes on Kabobs unless you like little balls of molten lava exploding in your mouth! Also, I don't have a Panasonic Counter top Induction Oven. So I had to figure that one out on my own. Otherwise this is a good basic recipe.

My husband and I loved these! I used only enough pesto to marinade the chicken which wasn't nearly as much as this calls for. I used more chicken and added colored peppers to the mix too. Was delicious!

This recipe couldn't have been easier and the flavor was fantastic!  The chicken was unbelievably tender and pesto gave it a complex flavor.   The tomatoes were sweet and the onions still had just the right amount of crunch.  I served with brown rice and broccoli, but, this would be wonderful on a sub roll!

5 stars all the way! This comes together so quick and is SO tasty! The Panasonic oven grills these kabobs to perfection. Add whatever veggies you like. I added a green bell pepper because I had one that needed used. Mushrooms would be a good addition and mix well with the pesto too. The chicken marinated in pesto is so good that I am convinced you can not go wrong with this recipe regardless of which veggies you choose to use. Excellent! Thanks for sharing Christina!
