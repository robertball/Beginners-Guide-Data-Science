Outstanding flavor! I love this bread recipe. Its a definite keep at this house. After reading some of the reviews about dryness I used 2/3 cup of frozen orange juice concentrate and 1/4 cup water.It turned out so moist and flavorful.The combination of orange, apricot and chocolate is so tasty. In spite of the changes in liquid ratio I felt it was still crumbly. Next time I will reduce the flour by 1/4 cup and see if that improves on the crumbly texture. Thanks for another delicious recipe Corwynn!

This bread tastes wonderful, but it's quite crumbly.  Just slicing it is a challenge.  If I make it again I would reduce the amount of apricots.

This is very good orange bread if you like to make bread. It is light and fluffy. I didn't add the apricots, chips, or nuts so it was very plain but good. It doesn't have much orange flavor but if accompanied by fruit or maybe orange glaze it could be more flavorful without the extra ingredients. It's quite crumbly and a little dry, so probably shouldn't be used for entertaining.

Following advice of others, I used 2/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp. orange juice.  Also only used 3/4 cup apricots and replaced mini chocolate chips for the regular.  I made them into muffins.  I really like them, even though they don't have a very "wow" flavor.  They're just very mellow, but still yummy.

very dry recipe, needs more butter or something, flavor is good though. I would try increasing the fat to 1/2 to 3/4 c.

Really liked this bread.  I love dried apricots and this was a great recipe to bake with them.  I made 3 smalls loaves with mine.  One without nuts and chocolate chips, one w/o chocolate chips and 1 as written.  Everyone in my family had a favorite verison.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Corwynn.

It looks like I'm the only one who had  problems with this recipe. I could not get this bread to cook in the middle; I even cooked it extra time, and it was getting too dark on the top.It is a very crumbly bread--by the time I cut away the under-cooked middle, I was left with two ends of the bread, and they didn't look very appetizing. I wasn't impressed with the taste--a bit bland.

To combat the dryness other reviewers reported, I used 1 1/2 cups of mashed fresh apricots instead of the dried. Which made it very moist--almost too much so. I also omitted the choc. chips. Next time I would use only 1 to 1 1/4 cup of fresh fruit & add cinnamon or another spice to give it a bit more depth. With all of the fresh fruit, the OJ was somewhat overpowered.

I didn't make any changes, but I think next time I will - it was just too crowded with flavours, none of them could be enjoyed is what we felt. Also it ended up super-sweet according to our taste. Next time (and there will be one), will leave out the chocolate and/or nuts and see if the apricot orange flavours come through.

I made this & it was very good but it needed a little more moisture so I added some sour cream. I didn't measure maybe 1/4 cup.
