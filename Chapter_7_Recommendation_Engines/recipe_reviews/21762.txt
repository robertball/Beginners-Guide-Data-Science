NO SPANIARD WOULD USE BUTTER TO COOK AN OMELET!
MY SUGGESTION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRY THE TRADITIONAL AND YUMMY SPANISH OMELET IS TO TRY THE RECIPE SUBMITTED BY PATTY:SPANISH POTATO OMELET(ITS GOT THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS )ALSO I WOULD REMOVE THE EXCESS OIL LEFT AFTER COOKING THE POTATO AND ONION.
JUST SOME ADVICE FROM SOMEONE THAT LIVES IN SPAIN. I HOPE YOU TRY IT AND ENJOY IT. IT´S REALLY GOOD!

A fast and easy weekend breakfast!  I used a small saucepan for the sauce and omitted the green pepper.

I love Spanish Omelets, but never knew how to make them. This was very tasty. I do have a few suggestion. Definitly use garlic and try a can of diced tomatoes instead of reg sauce, it makes it more chunky. I think the sauce needs more time to simmer to make the flavors blend. Add some shredded cheeses on top and Delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe...I will definitly make again.

This is a great and simple meal to put together. It is exactly what I've been searching for since I ate Spanish Omelets in California 20 years ago. Many of us think of "Spanish" meaning Southwestern or Mexican - not literally from Spain, so there is nothing wrong with using butter. And I prefer my omelets without potatoes! Thanks for a great recipe, Rebecca!

I know everyone has their own twist to their omelets. This one is how done just like Sara likes it so if you don't like it, instead of giving it no stars just advise the reader to look elsewhere.As pointed out, it is not the 'traditional' recipe, just one that uses butter. I prepared it as described, obviously with my own changes...but it was nice.I just wanted the basic know-how

A nice, sweet tomato flavor.
We used a clove of minced garlic, more peppers and onion, mozzarella, jack, and cheddar, and less tomato sauce.  We did it scrambled egg style instead of like an omelette and it turned out great.

Relax judgmental people.   We all know this is not a Tortilla Española.  It is a good old fashioned spanish omelet that was served in all diners back in the day.  And it is delicious!!!! I have been searching for this recipe for a minute now.  I added garlic. Thanks for sharing.

Very good. I never thought of putting a sauce over omelets! I added some garlic to the sauce as suggested, and I think it could be really played around with - bacon, sausage, mushrooms etc etc. I'll be making this again. Thanks, Rebecca!

This was a wonderfully easy and flavorful dish. I really liked the sauce, it was sweet and it made this dish. I used red pepper instead of green, a Texas sweet onion, and mexican tomato sauce. The directions called for making an omelet but the directions were for just scrambled eggs so I added in some mexican cheese to make it so. This was a fantastic dish and seemed really fancy without much effort at all. Thanks Rebecca for the wonderful recipe!

Thanks for the recipe, I like to put the sauce inside a larger omelet and fold it over.

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish!  Had some tomato sauce I wanted to incorporate into a breakfast dish, so I searched for tomato sauce and eggs and this popped up.  Glad it did!  Halved the recipe, and added  some a half teaspoon of garlic (because everything's better with garlic!).  Didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I added some beef bouillon to give the flavor some depth and put in a dash of smoked Tabasco sauce.  Definitely would make again!

Loved the tomato sauce and actually put it IN the eggs as a scramble and it tasted awesome! My husband put a sour cream/avacado mixture on his and loves it.

This recipe is like the Spanish omelettes restaurants made in the 70’s. I followed the recipe but doubled the onion and green peppers and added mushrooms and green onions and minced garlic. I used 2 teaspoons of El Pato hot tomato sauce instead of cayenne. I folded the finished sauce into a two egg omelette (2 eggs splash of milk salt pepper Colby&Monterey jack). Topped it with melted cheddar cheese and green onion. It was juicy and delicious.
