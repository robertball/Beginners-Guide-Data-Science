When I first found this recipe I knew that despite the bad reviews I had to try it!  It sounded so unique!  I didn't have the pumpkin pie filling on hand, but DID have 100% pure pumpkin, so I knew I would need to add in some sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, ground cloves and nutmeg.  I read the submitters indication that they prefer things spicy so I kept that in mind and scaled back the cayenne.  I also knew I wanted it to have some more depth than just chicken broth so I did a mixture of chicken broth (1 cup) and heavy cream (4 Tbsp).  It was very tasty but I thought it needed a little something extra.  I rummaged around in my fridge and found some ground sausage I had previously cooked...I added in about 1/2 cup and gave it another taste...OMG yum!!!!  

Don't allow the bad reviews to sway you, made right it's really yummy!  I think next time I may add in a bit of brie cheese for extra creaminess

My boyfriend was excited to try out this new recipe last night but it wasn't quite what we expected. Two teaspoons of Cayenne was way too spicy for us and we like our spice. One teaspoon of cayeene would have been plenty. Also, the sauce was not as saucy as we would like. It was very chunky and thick. We added more broth but it was still quite thick. Not sure if i'd try this again.

I personally expected more from this recipe. I really love a good pumpkin recipe but it was not a very good flavor. I did add some heavy cream to the recipe which helped a little. I really would not recommend this to anyone.

I am a huge fun of anything pumpkin, and I liked this super fast and easy recipe. *However, in the interest of full disclosure, I used half broth and half almond milk.* I am not sure how it would be with all water. I used Celentano brand light cheese ravioli. The heat level was fine with me, I actually also added some crushed red pepper, but I like this on the searingly spicy side. I would def make this again.

I should have read the reviews first.  We love spice, but this was way too spicy. I suggest that you use only half the cayenne pepper.

I agree with the sauce being way too spicy. I liked the pumpkin flavor but it does need a little thinning.

I made this with plain canned pumpkin, not a fan of sweet sauces.  Omitted thyme and used less cayenne. Very good. Definitely would make again!

Everyone loved it! It was delicious! No left overs. Will definitely make it again. I skipped the Cayenne Pepper because I wanted the kids to eat it.  I added 1 cup heavy cream & used 1 cup chicken broth. I also added 2 TBS brown sugar, 1 TSP Nutmeg, and sprinkled Garlic salt and black pepper to taste. We ate it with Garlic toast. Amazing!

I made this for the first time tonight. I was a little iffy about it due to the questionable reviews. However, I thought it was delicious! And my roommate and his friend both devoured it, loving every bite! I added a little sugar, cinnamon, and all spice to sweeten it up a little. But other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Unlike some of the others I had no problem with too thick of a sauce or with it being too spicy. Will definitely be making this again!
