Been drinking this for years. We call it a "Cola Red". Lots of people turn their noses up to the idea of this, but it really is just a red wine version of a white wine sprtizer.  A great way to drink red wine on a warm summer night. Not as sweet as a sangria. And with diet soda it comes out to be a fairly low-cal drink. Adjust the ratio to your personal preference. I like more red than cola

I was not sure about red wine and dark cola, but I tried it and it was refreshing, delicious, and really easy. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I used sangiovese and diet cola. I also added the lemon to the drink and it seemed to help blend the flavors together.

The Basque do it best.  When making this, pay special attention to the fiz.  You want a light purple fiz, which to me, is more wine, less cola!  And get the cheapest bottle!  My favorite 5 o'clock cocktail.

Fixed this drink last night for a party.  Great way to stretch out a bottle of cheap wine.  I even used diet cola.

I saw this drink on The Chive app. It didnt have a recipe attached so where else would one go to get a trustworthy recipe. I left the garnish off. Good drink. Will make again after I finish this one. Lol

I would prefer about 3/4 wine and the remainder coke with a lemon slice.
