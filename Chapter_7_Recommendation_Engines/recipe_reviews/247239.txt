I followed the cheesecake portion exactly, but used blackberries, blueberries, and golden kiwis. I added some strawberry sauce that I had made for another recipe and topped with more whipped cream. The cheesecake was so light and fluffy. It was surprisingly easy to make and everyone thought they were beautiful.

When some cooks start  their review by saying  "if I could I would give this 10 stars..", I roll my eyes  thinking,  drama people.  Well, I am one of those people now. I wish I could rate this more than 5 !
I made no changes and it was a such treat. I still have more than half a box of pecan shortbread cookies to use up. I will be making this again, soon for sure.

This is definitely a delicious and sweet day treat for anytime. I made the strawberry and it was fabulous. I then made it with lemon curd and was great also. I threw in a few blueberries with the lemon and got rave reviews. Thanks Ruth

OMG- if I could rate this 10 stars I would.  I doubled the recipe and put it in 9 oz plastic tumblers for Happy Hour at the pool.  It made 14 and the crowd went crazy over them.  Thank you RuthE for this wonderful recipe! I did not change the basic recipe.  The only thing I did was add 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1 tsp almond extract to the Heavy Cream when whipping it.

I followed the directions exactly except had graham crackers crumbs so I used those for the crunchy bottom layer and used raspberries and Marion berries.  I made it as a dessert for our Father's Day dinner and everybody raved. A delicious and easy recipe (and so cute in the tiny mason jars)

So easy to make even if your teen ate all the strawberries earlier and you don't have a full block of cream cheese! I substituted strawberry jam, reduced the sugar just a tad, increased the lemon juice (only had bottled), and used pulverized graham crackers as the base. I shaved dark chocolate (one piece from a candy bar), on the tops before closing the lids and chilling. Will make this again, and maybe use fresh strawberries if my hungry teen doesn't eat them beforehand. Thanks!

Definitely will make again. One of the best desserts I have ever made. May try a variation using fresh peaches. Would rather use graham cracker for crust.

This is delicious and so easy! I used Graham crackers instead of the cookies and everyone raved about it! I used 6 Graham crackers and had left over crust so next time I'd probably only use 4. I also used leftover berries instead of strawberries. I will be making this often!

I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was fantastic!!! The crust made with the Keebler Sandies  was a bit hard and the texture was a bit "off". I will defiantly make this again but, going to try gram crackers next time.

Made as written except used 1/4 cup Splenda instead of sugar; even bought the jars!  We couldn't wait to chill the first ones.  The last 4 made it to the fridge.

Made as written except I had no sandies so used graham cracker crumbs.  Raves all around.  Thanks for this recipe.  Don't like to give 5 stars but this is as close as it gets to perfect and would not be afraid to serve to anyone.

Really good no bake cheesecake. I didn’t even put in the strawberries. I just topped with cherry pie filling. I used plastic cups and served them as a dessert at a cocktail party.

This has become a family favourite.. Light, fluffy, the perfect amount of sweetness! We make our own shortbread first, and we've used all kinds of berries. It's a great recipe.

This was really tasty and easy to make! I used Ramekins because I didn't have jars and I used a graham cracker crust since I had it on hand. Was a big hit and will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe many times. it is delicious and easy. Instead of using shortbread cookies I used graham crackers. I also replaced the whipped cream with sour cream and added some more sugar.

Fantastic! In the interest of honesty, I didn't want to buy strawberries and jars when I had caramel apple pie filling and cupcake liners already in my pantry. So, I made caramel apple cheesecake in cupcake liners. BUT the cheesecake recipe remained unchanged and came out the perfect flavor and consistency. I was comfortable changing the recipe since I was only making this for myself, but next time I have company, I'll follow the recipe exactly (including the jars), and I know it will be wonderful.

Yum! Made it just like the directions, but used whiskey sour glasses as I didn't have any canning jars. It was so good and a perfect end to a summer meal.

Made this for Easter family dinner and it was a hit since those who were full from dinner could take the jar home and eat the dessert later. Recipe was tasty without any modifications.

I made this for my work friends and they loved it. I ended up splitting the cheesecake mix into two bowls and made 1/2 raspberry (Coles didn’t have any strawberries) and 1/2 with lemon curd. 
Will definitely be making this again.

This was a hit at the family Christmas dinner this past year 2018. I thought the strawberries looked festive and gave it a try. Each year I try to add 1 new item to the list of foods I bring over to family gatherings . Everyone loved them.  The only thing I changed is adding more pecan sandies to the bottom of the jar. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't get one.

Only changes made were using gluten free vanilla wafers for crust and deceased sugar. Very good. Will definitely make again.
