Used Bertolli olive oil spray, added smoked paprika & garlic salt. Very tasty, less calories.

The only thing I changed was to put the vegetables in a large bowl and add herbs, oil and sprinkle with cheese, then toss.  Then add them to the roast pan.

It seemed too simple to be true! I put it on some foil, sprayed the foil and the top of the cauliflower with "Pam" Olive Oil spray, then sprinkled with the salt, Parmesan and pepper. 
After pulling out of the oven the fist time, it did not make it to the dinner table! Even my Wife who is not a big cauliflower fan could not keep her hands off the stuff. This one is a hit, can't wait to get another head of cauliflower to treat the grandkids!

Wonderful recipe. I dry-roasted 8 or 9 garlic cloves  (with skins on) in a cast iron pan on medium heat stove to mellow out their flavor. Peeled off skins when cooled. Minced finely and added the roasted garlic to the olive oil, salt & pepper, before tossing with the cauliflower florets. Elevated it to a new level!

Really easy! Added garlic powder and only added the parmesan for the last 2 minutes...we also doubled the cooking time because we like our roasted veggies REALLY roasted!

A great and versitile keto recipe. I find seasoning easier during/after tossing with olive oil. Makes for a good side dish or an excellent pasta substitute to pour sauce over.

Be warned, you'll need to make at least double the recipe because it gets gobbled up quickly!
