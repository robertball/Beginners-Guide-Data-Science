Very good bolognese, I think I like it  more than beef bolognese to be completely honest. I did take a massive poo on the john afterward, but it's okay because it tasted good on the way in, and felt great on the way out 9/10 rating final rating.

Not bad, but I think next time I would add some crushed tomatoes as well. This was lacking in the sauce department as is.
