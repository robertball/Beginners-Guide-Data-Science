I made this the other night and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it.  I used a jar of mild sliced jalapenos and a container of chive and onion cream cheese.  We threw the cream cheese, meat, and jalapenos in a Kitchen Aid mixer and mixed it up until it was all nice and pink.  This broke up the jalapenos a bit.  We were a little concerned that the meat being mixed so much wouldn't patty well or hold together, but we were wrong.  Mixing it a lot also gave the burgers a really great light texture that brought out the flavors.  We didn't have a grill at the time, so we cooked the  burgers in a skillet and they came out great.  We wished we hadn't scaled down the recipe so we would have lots of left-overs.

These burgers Are GREAT!!! I would recommend putting the cream cheese in the middle. I tryed both ways, mixing and stuffing the burgers. There IS a taste differance. Mixing it together was like eating a meatloaf burger, putting the stuffing in the middle made for a tastier burger. RECOMMEND BACON!!!

This tastes amazing! The only thing I found was using mustard, ketchup, relish etc. with these kind of took away from the cream cheese flavour. I would maybe just use a bit of mayo and veggies (lettuce, tomato, onion) and try to stay away from any over powering condiments/sauces.

Okay, these were AWESOME....with a few changes. I added only about 1 1/2 cups of FINELY diced jalapeno (seeds and membranes removed) along with the 8 oz block of softened cream cheese. Then I just mixed the mixture into the meat and made patties. We then grilled on a well-oiled grill. They turned out great! Next time, we plan to top them with bacon...YUM!

This is the only way I'll be making my burgers from now on! If you like jalapeño poppers, you'll LOVE this! I chopped up jalapeños that were in a jar (all that I had) and mixed that into the meat. Then took regular cream cheese and spread a good amount onto the burger. It was FANTASTIC! I can't believe no restaurants have this type of burger. Could definitely serve this in a restaurant and it'd be a hit!

These were great!  We followed the advice of one reviewer who suggested mixing the cream cheese and jalepenos into the burger.  Next time we won't mix all of the cream cheese, as the patties didn't hold together very well, but will save some cream cheese to melt on the top.  The flavor and texture was incredible thought!

Good flavor, but the recipe as written is too messy.  I've made this twice and, for the life of me, can't get the burgers to hold together with the cream cheese stuffed in the middle.  I recommend using the jalapeno cream cheese as a spread on the bun instead.

I too mixed only 1 pkg of herb and garlic cream cheese right into the meat.

we really enjoyed this recipe. i love cream cheese in everything. i made a few (wonderful) changes. the biggest, and my favorite, was to add canned black beans (about 1/2 can) to the meat mixture. i wanted a little more flavor and moisture, and the beans made the meat so moist and extra meaty, if that's possible. i also used much less jalapeno and also added fresh tomato to the cream cheese mixture. cooked these under the broiler and they were awesome. my boyfriend went back for seconds.

I hate giving anything low stars - but without mods, this is so bland. The ONLY flavor is in the cream cheese, and that's just spicy. I made 1 as directed, just so I could say I did, and i was right. Bland, flavorless meat and then hot cream cheese w/ japs in it. Woo. I loved the idea though so to my meat I added salt, pepper, garlic and worchestershire sauce, and to the cream cheese/jap mixture I added S&P, garlic and just a handful of mexican shredded cheese. Soooooo awesome. Great idea, easily improved on. AS WRITTEN, not awesome.

My friend requests these burgers every time she comes over. I added an egg to hold the meat together. Kick it up by adding Dry Ranch mix and Worcestershire Sauce to meat before stuffing!!! (Recipe on this site for "Dry Ranch Style Seasoning for Dip or Dressing" A+++)

These were soooo yummy! I followed the advise of another reviewer and used less cream cheese (8oz.), and reduced the peppers to 1/2 cup. I also melted a slice of Mont. Jack on top of each burger before they came off the grill. I served them on toasted buns with homemade chipotle mayo and avocado slices. Oh so good!

I haven't made these (yet), but am giving 5 stars anyway because I have no doubt they will be fabulous!! Wanted to give a hint to those who say putting it together the way the recipe says is either too messy, or the burgers won't hold together.  They easiest way of stuffing a burger wiht cheese is to take the amount you want for your burger, form it into a round shape (like a meatball) and press an indentation into one side with your thumb.  Fill that with the cheese and jalapeno mixture and then form it into a patty with your hands, closing up the filling as you do.  Much easier than trying to put together the two thin patties, and your filling stays inside!  Hope this helps!!

Love! Love! Love these. Season the meat however you want. Wonderful. I make jalapeno mayo for a topping. YUM! Stay away from ketchup, mustard and reslish on these babies :)  Caution on the first bite. The cream cheese is really hot and oozes out . Be careful no one gets a burnt chin. Making these again today for family BBQ........Also added shredded mozzarella inside and slices of jalpeno

These are a regular at our house. I use canned jalapenos and leave a little juice with them. It makes them easier to mix in with the cream cheese. My husband doesn't eat spicy food so I make 1/2 with bacon bits instead of jalapenos. They are excellent!!

Wow.  I have been missing out.  This is the only way we want to eat our Turkey burgers now.  I always make extra cream cheese/jalapeno mixture to put on top too.

The crowd raved over these! I used about a pound and a half of burger to make 4 stuffed burgers. I cut the cream cheese WAY back to 4 oz and used 2 jalapenos and it worked great! I even had a little extra 'stuffing' to use. Next time I will use the extra stuff because I found that the cream cheese mix absorbs into the meat a bit during the cooking process but I still think the 4 oz will be enough for 4 burgers. I also seasoned the meat with garlic powder, pepper, worcestershire and onion powder.

This is one of our favorite hamburger combos. The first time I made it I didn't have canned jalapino's so I cut a large jalapino in half (theres only two of us) , seeded it and boiled it for a couple of minutes, I realised that I like this better than the canned or jarred, it takes the acidic factor away (brininess). I just added a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese and sealed it into the 85% burger meat.  Remember you cannot stuff burger meat if it has been previously frozen......it will NOT hold together, so save that package in your freezer and get some fresh ground beef.   We topped ours with chopped crisp bacon, shredded lettuce, the thinest sliced onion (barely any) and a little mayo. Still it's a very juicy, satisfying, delicious burger.

Just as the recipe is written, I found the burger itself lacking some seasoning, however that is how my boyfriend makes his all the time...  The one thing to note is to ALWAYS use fresh beef as frozen will always fall apart for stuffed burgers.  I also made my patties bigger as I only got 4 burger  patties per lb instead of 8...  Will make again, just will add some seasoning to the ground beef next time.

"Best Hamburger I've ever had!" That's what my husband said about these. Didn't change anything about the recipe, but did add some Emeril's hamburger seasoning to the tops of the patties before cooking them. It was raining so I put these under the broiler for about 5-7 minutes on each side. Ate these with nothing but a bun and some bacon. Can't wait to make again!!

Very good. I agree with the reviewer who said these are like jalopeno poppers in burger form. These are very good. In the future I think I will try seasoning my burger with chipotle seasoning to add a bit more flavor.

These hamburgers turned out amazing.  I used a whipped cream cheese which made it much easier to stir in the jalapenos. I would recommend putting a little mayo on a toasted bun and toppings like tomato & lettuce.  Great burger!

I cooked the burgers without stuffing them and added the cream cheese mixture as a topping.  Excellent!!

I loved this more with every bite! The cream cheese makes it so juicy and flavorful! I downsized this for two people; 1 lb. hamburger, 4 oz cream cheese, and about 5 canned chopped jalapenos (I didn't have fresh). Next time I'll add more jalapenos. I'm not sure that someone who didn't know would realize it was cream cheese in the middle; don't tell them and see if they can tell! I am going to try this as a sandwich spread (slightly warmed) too! Thanks for the great recipe!

Hey I am the submitter of this recipe :)  For anyone having trouble with these staying together you may be using a bit too much of the mixture! I use about a half and inch to an inch sized ball and I make my patties really flat and pretty large sized so you can pinch the sides together easily! And they are suppsed to be a messy yummy burger :) Enjoy :)

My husband loved the flavor of these burgers, and says "it's a keeper." The recipe made way too much filling, and next time I will change the ratio between the cream cheese and peppers so that there is less cream cheese. We topped ours with pepperjack, grilled onions, crispy bacon, and light mayo.

this was the first time i made these and i have to say that i was so dissappointed. i was excited to try this because i am a big fan of cheese, and spiciness but you couldn't really taste any of the cheese and pepper. not only that, after greasing the grill grate it still stuck and fell apart i was sad and embarassed to serve to my family.

I made these last night for my husband and I and we loved them! We don't have a grill so I put them under the broiler for about 5-7 mins on each side and they were perfect! He has now requested that we have this meal quite often! THANKS!

This was ok.  Maybe it was the cook but I got little meatballs instead of hamburgers.  Plus, they were really dry.  The cream cheese jalepeno flavor was great, though; we used the leftover filling as a dip :o)

Loved these. They were a big hit!  We put bacon on the burgers as well, and the extra cream cheese/jalapeno stuffing was delicious with a little bacon.

Delicious!  Had to season the ground beef (hence only 4 stars) and then doubled the jalapeno.

DELICIOUS!!!!!  I seasoned the meat with worchestershire, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and steak seasoning.  1 1/2 lbs of meat yielded me 4 burgers.  I halved the filling and I still had some leftover.  I did not find these messy at all.  The filling stayed in the burger nicely on the grill.  My hubby and I LOVED them.  Definitely going to put these on my summer grilling rotation. :0)  They had good jalapeno flavor, without being spicy.  Yum Yum.

Wow was this ever GOOD... I cut back about 1/4 on the cream cheese-jalapeno mix and it was plenty!  I also followed Tristin's advice about making the patty into a large pancake then pulling the sides to the top to form a ball, then flatten into a patty... it was easy-peezy!  The only problem I had was that I guess I didn't quite flatten it out enough cause they came off the grill looking like a rather large meatball, LOL, but they tasted EXCELLENT!  We will make this again for sure!

Definitely the best burgers from this site we've had! I did half the amount of fresh chopped jalapeno and substituted some jarred chopped jalapenos for some extra flavor. I also added about a 1/4 cup of finely shredded mexican cheese. I stuffed the burgers rather than mixing it all in. Try flattening out one large thin pancake of burger meat, plopping about a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture in the middle and then folding all the edges of the meat up and sealing well, forming a ball. After it is sealed, you can GENTLY flatten your ball into a thick patty. When cooking, only flip once! Spray grill and cook on each side until done. I had no problem with them falling apart. We can't wait to make them again!

Here's how we did it:   We mixed together 1 lb of ground beef, 4 ounces of cream cheese, and approx. 1/4 cup of sharp, shredded provolone. Then added a tablespoon of Worcestershire and two diced jalapenos. This mixture made four medium-size patties. Because we wrapped them in bacon held on with toothpicks, they stayed together fairly well while they cooked.   These hamburgers had a unique, delicious flavor, and they were nice and juicy. Yummy! We'll definitely try this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome burgers!!!!!!!! I halved the recipe because I only needed 4 burgers.  I had no issues with the filling oozing out ( I had no filling leftover I used it all) but you need to take special care in sealing the edges. When I turned on my grill I realized it was out of propane so I ended up baking these in the oven and they came out just fine. Totally a burger we all enjoyed and I will be making again!!!

These were really good!  I added bacon to the filling.  I don't know why but I had about half of the filling leftover so I saved it and used part of it for pasta, I mixed it with a little bit of alfredo sauce over speghetti noodles.  The last of it I made a chicken caserole with cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup over chicken breasts.  Everything was DELICOUS!

The taste is there for this recipe but there was way too much cream cheese filling and not enough seasoning for the beef itself. This recipe has the right ideas but needs a little work. I will probably make it again but season the beef as I would with a normal hamburger and use less filling.

Great burger, I added a pack of dry onion soup to the meat and it was sooo good! Don't use condiments, just spread some of the cream cheese mix on the buns.

Great! Made for a poker night for my husband and his buddies! They gobbled them up...next time will use less Jalapeno's though, so not as spicy!

Very good but needs a little more oomph.  I put the Special Hamburger Sauce from this site on it and it was really good.  Next time I make this I'll add something to the cream cheese mixture and season the ground beef.

These were great, and left us completely stuffed! The filling is great, but we had a lot leftover so if you aren't planning on making more in the future, it's safe to scale back the cream cheese and peppers in equal proportion.

I am not a spicey girl. My husband can handle a bit more heat than I can and he had no complaints, and enjoys these burgers quite a bit. I won't be making them with the jalapeno next time because I'm too wussy. But the cream cheese stuffed burger is delicious..just a bit on the spicey side .

These are excellent I make them all the time! I accidentally used a serrano pepper instead of jalapeno one time and it was extra hot for those that like it spicy!

Very Good.  It is now one of my favorites!  I added salt and perrper to the meat.  Definately use fresh jalapenos or serranos. Grilled it out! YUM!

A family favorite. We have found that canned Jalapenos give these burgers more spice and better flavor.

These were delish!  I used roasted green chiles instead of jalapenos, and I added quite a bit of grill seasoning to the meat.  Will make again!

This recipe needed some changes.  This is a great simple recipe and I wanted to kick it up. In food processor place, handful of cilantro, 4 jalapenos with seeds, 1 block light cream cheese, 1 cup shredded low fat cheddar, salt and pepper to taste and blend together.  stuff in burgers and grill, add monterey jack to top and melt.  So so good.

Awesome! I was hesitant to try these because I am known for being a little wimpy about spiciness. My husband, however, loves spicy food. We both loved them! I used canned sliced jalapenos and rinsed all the seeds out.

I just didn't care for these...the cream cheese flavor totally overwhelmed the peppers and I didn't skimp on the peppers. They just weren't spicy at all *AND* I had a ton of the cream cheese mixture left over even after cutting it in half. I probably won't make these again...EDIT: I tried this again recently with a completely different method. I used 1/4 the amount of the cream cheese and roasted and chopped my jalapeños before *mixing* them into the meat and forming patties. They were much more flavorful and the cream cheese enhanced the flavor rather than overwhelming it. If you change the method, these are tasty!

Grilled these for Memorial Day bbq. I made 6 burgers from 2 pounds of meat. The cream cheese mixture did not ooze out at all, I was careful to seal the edges. They were not as spicy as I was expecting, even with all the fresh jalapenos. It was very easy to chop the peppers in the food processor. I had more than half the cream cheese mixture left over, there was no way a pound of cream cheese was going to fit into 6 burgers. The burgers were moist, I served with sliced red onion and guacamole. By the way, I mixed some minced garlic and parmesean cheese into the left over cream cheese mixture, spread it on sourdough and baked at 400 for 10 minutes - very tasty! I will make these burgers again.

You had me at "Jalapeno!!!"  The sound you all hear is my husband Richard making "YUM YUM, snarf, snarf" noises.  Made him this burger for lunch today.  I can't do dairy (boo hiss) but mixed the peppers into the meat for mine.  He said his was like eating a Jalapeno popper with a meat coating!  I had no problem with the burger falling apart!  I mixed his filling up, divided it into 2 portions (knew he was going to want seconds!) and put it back in the fridge for a bit to firm up again.  Then I patted the meat around it.  Worked like a charm!  And, since I can't seem to leave well enough alone, I added a 1/2 package of Hidden Valley Ranch mix to the meat.  Added a nice little pop of flavor!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

There is a lot of potential for this recipe.  However, in my case I used 2 lb. of ground beef and only one packages of cream cheese and 1 cup of diced jalepenos.  I STILL had a lot of the cream cheese mixture left over.  I also have the complaint of the burgers being too small.  It seemed everytime I'd try and flatten them out even thinner to make them rounder and larger, they would just fall apart.  So what I ended up with was 8 little, but somewhat thick burgers.  I think if I make these again, I'll just stick with my regular hamburger patty ritual and then use the cream cheese and jalepenos as a spread.

This recipe created the best burgers I have ever had the pleasure of eating! The only change I made was that I mixed the cream cheese and jalapeno mixture in with the ground beef instead of putting it in the center of the patties. I made these in a frying pan, so to make sure the burgers didn't fall apart, I turned the heat up to high at first to seal in the cream cheese. After a few seconds I turned down the heat, and the patties held together nicely. I will be making these burgers very often! Thanks, Noelle!

AMAZING! Made them for a football party and people kept asking for more and raving about them! I just balled the meat around the cream cheese filling then flattened them out, rather than sandwiching between two burgers... was easier.

I read a lot of the reviews before making, and opted to stuff the cream cheese/jalapeno in the center of the burger as the recipe calls for instead of mixing it into the meat. After making them, they were wonderful - much better than I expected. I added a little garlic and onion powder to the cream cheese mix, and we topped ours with bacon. After making them, I simply cannot see how mixing the cream cheese INTO the hamburger would yield the same results. Follow the recipe's way for a more fun, unique and delicious burger.

Unbelievably delicious. Added green onions to the mix to add a little flavor with the spicy kick. Also, probably common sense, but make sure to make the patty thinner in the center and pinch together well at the edges.

These were delicious!  I made them last night for my boyfriend and we both loved them.  I left some of the seeds in, added chopped onion and garlic and I didn't use all of the filling.  I also wanted to season the meat, but I forgot and was initially worried, but the ketchup and salt on the fries my boyfriend made helped.    Suggestions, add onions and or garlic and definitely season the meat just a little if that's what you usually do.  All in all, a definite hit!!!

These were excellent. I made them one week, and my husband requested I make them again the next week for get together. I added bacon bits to mine, which made it even better. My advice is to sautee or use canned jalapenos. I did not like the cruchyness of them not precooked. I used 2 lbs of hamburger and only got 5 burgers. These are huge.

I just made these for lunch, with a couple of changes. They were fantastic! 
The only changes I made were that I did season the meat with onion, salt, pepper,  and a dash of A-1. 
As far as cooking, I used the proper Juicy Lucy method, which you brown the first side. Flip it, vent the top (helps so that the cheese doesn't squirt out and burn the diner). Once side 2 is browned, dome the burger with a lid and add some water so that they don't burn and the burger can cook too desired doneness

Wonderful, flavorful burgers! I added an egg and mixed the cream cheese/jalapeño mixture into the ground beef with some bread crumbs, creole seasoning, sautéed onions and celery. I was cooking for one, so I may have got the balance wrong, because it seemed too wet and the burger did not stay together, but the flavor was amazing! I grilled the buns and used a sauce made with mayo, jalapeño juice, and paprika. Sooooo GOOD!

My husband and I LOVE these! SO good with a great kick!! The patties don't always stay together and sometimes a little bit of cream cheese mixture spills out the side but I don't care the taste is amazing!! Best stuffed burgers ever!!!

We loved these! Bacon is a must. I put ground venison in my food processor with just a little bacon grease and just pulsed a couple times to combine.  I put the cream cheese mixture between two patties and sealed the patties the best I could. The patties kind of separated on the grill but ended up being a neat layered look!  I didn't really lose any filling so all was well! We made them for company and they were enjoyed by all, served on fresh baked hamburger buns alongside baked french fries.  This is a meal we will definitely make again!

Wowee! This was great. My boo loves spice, so I added some chopped canned jalapenos to the beef along with garlic powder, S&P, and then used Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand Jalapeno cream cheese in the middle. I admit to having the "ooze" problem the first couple (more like a sandwich), but figured it out by the time I got to the 10th burger. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

I have made these quite a few times and they are divine!  I absolutely love them.  I use the jar jalapenos because I really like the flavor.

We have made these multiple times and always come back to this recipe when we make burgers. I use one jalopeno, a pound a burger and about 1/4 cream cheese block. I melt the cream cheese in the microwave to get it plyable. I season my burger with lawrys seasoning salt and balck pepper. then I make very very thing pattys then i spoon some mixture in the middle and put another thin patty on top and bind the edges. I do like them with a slice of swiss or cheddar on top but it is fine without it. I have made these on the Forman, the grill and in a frying pan they have never turned out bad. although the forman and the grill are much easier. also those little 1 lb meat logs that you can buy those work the best since they are so sticky to begin with.

We made the 4 serving version with 4 jalepenos (3/4 cup).  We did not use the entire amount of cream cheese.   Topped them with pepperjack cheese. This was one of the best burger recipes we've ever had!

The best burger I have ever had! The filling is AWESOME! I used 1/2 cup jalapenos with 4 oz (1/2 pkg) of cream cheese for 2 hamburgers (used 1 pd of ground beef made into 4 patties, just used one patty for bottom, one for top, sealing in the mixture). Fantastic! P.S. Don't use thawed meat, use fresh, it will stay together better.

2 c jalepenos sounded like a lot...even if they are seeded which takes a lot of the heat out of them..so I cut it in half. For less "spicy" flavor I put garlic in instead....4 small cloves/crushed for the proportions of the recipe as given. There are only 3 of us here so I really only made half a batch. I also found that I only needed half as much cream cheese filling as the recipe calls for. 4 stars due to changes. I really liked the jalepeno/garlic blend. My stuff (filling) I made the in the morning before I went to work so it sat all day in the fridge before getting used. I think it does help the cheese flavor more to acually sit all day and have the flavor age as well.

I 1/2 the recipe, but I was afraid of the amount of jalapenos, so I only used less than 1/2 cup. They really did not have a bite at all, so I will up the amount next time. I sealed them very carefully and did not have any trouble with them coming apart. They were nice and juicy.

Yummy!!  I used 1 lb of ground beef, 1/2 block of cream cheese and 2 diced jalapeno peppers.  Sprinkled a little salt on each side of the burger once they were ready for the grill.

I love this recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I added two eggs, a packet of liptons onion soup mix and a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce to the hamburger meat.  I then spooned a small amount of the jalapeno cream cheese in the middle and sealed the sides up as best I could.  I cooked them on a griddle, browned both sides then placed a glass lid over them to ensure cooking throughout (juices were clear) The cheese didn't leak! I slathered them up in cilantro mayonaise and topped with arugula and spinach.  (This is a low carb dieter's dream!) had alot of depth and great flavor, thanks for sharing!

Five star rating based on the changes I made inspired by hothilary36's review.  The filling was a combo of cream cheese, cheddar, jalapenos, and cilantro.  I mixed some salt and pepper in with the meat, stuffed the burgers, and topped with cheddar.  So outstanding when prepared like this!

They didnt turn out how i hoped way too spicy and they leaked out, but something that i could have prevented.. i suggest using less jalpenos. I seasoned the hamburger with garlic salt and other seasonings. over all so/so.

As far as taste is concerned...these are EXCELLENT!!  However, I had a few problems.  They were super messy first of all, I had to really scrub my griddle to get it clean.  Also, I had a hard time cooking the beef thoroughly without squeezing the cream cheese mixture out as my patties did not hold together well.  If I make these again I am going to try a different preparation method.  I think I will cook the patties individually and when done sandwich the cream cheese mixture between patties and cook just long enough to warm cream cheese.  The end result would look and taste the same as what I ended up with following recipes instructions, (probably better because more cream cheese would make it to your plate), plus it would make clean up and prep alot easier.  Also, I only used the jalapeno's on my burger.  For my husband and daughters burgers I used real bacon bits with the cream cheese and they loved it.  This is a recipe that can really be customized to your own liking.  Definitely going to play around with different prep methods on this one.

UPDATE:  Okay, I tried this the easy way.  Made a burger and spread the cream cheese mixture on the bun....MUCH easier and not so messy.  Plus, this does NOT affect the taste.  In my opinion it is better this way.

These were very tasty but not spicy enough for me.  Next time, I think I'll leave the ribs and sids in the jalapenos, and let the mixture sit a bit before stuffing.  They were really good!

The flavor was nice but even though I thought I sealed everything well, most of the filling oozed out. I think next time I'll make two thin patties and then just spread this in the middle of them after cooking...I added diced red onion to the burger mixture and garlic to the filling

YUM YUM YUM!!! Any Jalapeno popper lover HAS to try these! I used fresh chopped jalapenos and they gave the burgers amazing flavor. Not the easiest patty to form and can get messy trying to flip on the grill but O-M-G...SOOO worth it. I can not believe these are not on restaurant menus everywhere!

This was AWESOME. I posted photos on Twitter & Facebook and several friends made this after seeing my pictures. We all love this amazing recipe! I seasoned the beef with Montreal Steak Seasoning and topped the burger with ketchup, mustard, tomato and lettuce. DON'T DO THAT. I would only use bacon, maybe some avocado, lettuce, and mayo next time.  I felt the ketchup & mustard competed with the delicate flavors and concealed them.  This recipe will be a BBQ staple in my household & I can't wait to share this on Father's Day weekend!

Yummmmmmmy!!!  If you like that wonderful jalapeno flavor, this recipe is a keeper!  The only real "work" in this recipe is cutting/dicing the jalapenos.

This was my first time cooking for another family, and it got rave reviews!!! I would suggest using only half the cream cheese, because I ended up wasting a lot of it. Also, I added onion soup mix to the meat. The flavor of the onions mixed with the cream cheese was SO amazing!!! Also I broiled it in the oven for 12 minutes.

Very good.  I think I will add some seasoning to the cream cheese next time, but I will surely make them again.  I buttered and browned the buns for an extra touch.

These tasted really good but were hard to keep together/keep the filling from falling out...wonder if it would be just as well to purree the filling then blend into the meat mixture then form patties?  We ended up making the patties then bacon wrapping them to help keep together, but still without messing with the burgers at all they still leaked.  But the taste was great!  Made LOTS of extra filling too, couldn't stuff any more filling in the already fully stuffed burgers :)

Yumm!! I added a piece of thick maple bacon to the top. It was a great sweet hot treat. I also toasted the buns. I will make these again for guests at my next cook out. These are BIG burgers but oh so good.

I used herb and garlic cream cheese and added a couple extra spices.  Very nice change to the basic, plain ole' burger.  They were a little messy, but well worth it.  Had to make sure I sealed the edges good or the yummy cream cheese goodness will ooze out!  Will make again.

My husband's aunt made these for us last summer. I LOVE them. Just as the recipe calls for. She also made another variation of a "stuffed" burger as we call them. She stuffed in between the patties onion, cheese, and mushrooms. Recommend this for everyone and anyone!!!

Very tasty! Next time I think I'll just make the filling and use as a spread instead of in the center because it was hard to keep the burgers together on the grill.

Will never make a hamburger any other way!!!  We've tried several reviewer suggestion and our favorite way to do these is to mix half the cream cheese in with meat, along with 'Jane's Crazy Mixed-up Salt' (if you've never had this seasoning go buy it right away-it will change your life!) and then used the remaining cream cheese in the middle of the patties...TO DIE FOR!!! Great recipe!!!

I followed the advice of others and mixed the cream cheese in- big mistake. I ended up with little burger crumbles that I was scraping off the grill. The crumbles tasted good but the sandwich looked like a hot mess!

I made this exactly as written and they turned out beautifully.  Hubby and his buddy went back for 2nds and neither even prefer spicy foods.  I had no problems with burgers not holding together, just make the bottom burger larger and dig a small dent into the middle.  Then place the smaller patty on top and fold over so the cheese doesn't melt out.  These were easy and fantastic!

This was a great burger.  I used 95% lean ground beef & fat free cream cheese.  Usually my burger lean beef burgers come of the grill dry, but these were not.  Perfect!  Will make again, and again!  Fresh jalapeno's have become a staple in my home.

This recipe provided a great technique for me to learn (stuffing the burgers), but it needed more.  Don't get me wrong, the jalapenos were great, but next time we try these, we'll do a cheddar and cream cheese mixture, along with jalapenos, scallions and possibly bacon.    One thing worth noting is that the burger filling is PIPING hot when they come off the grill, so you need to make sure to allow ample time to cool so guests don't burn their tongues on the filling.

these we're really good despite the fact that i charred them a little bit on the grill.  i just mixed the cream cheese mixture and the jalapenos in with the meat and made patties out of that, they fell apart.  i think next time im going to keep a better eye on them for starters and just do them as the recipe states.

I made these last night for my daughter's birthday dinner.  Everyone loved them, but I think I will try the jar jalapenos next time for added flavor.  The peppers just don't cook in the middle in that short of time on the grill.  They were very easy to make and to put together.  You make two thin burgers and add a ball like scoup of the mixture in the middle. The burgers seal the cream cheese mixture instead without any mess at all. I seasoned the meat as well. Delicious! Thanks!  PS. We are going to experiment with other things next time... such as black olives, green olives, bacon and mushrooms in place of the jalapenos!  Many possibilities here!! YUM!

Wonderful!  I followed the recommendations of others and mixed the cream cheese right in with the hamburger meat.  I was afraid it would burn on the grill, but it didn't.  So good!  I will make these often.

These are great!  They are now requested at all cook outs with neighbors and as our regular burger in our house.  We make it with jar jalapenos and use the extra mixture on the buns when serving. *EDIT* I have made these several times now.  The way to keep them from falling apart is to pinch the edges and freeze the burgers once they are stuffed.  That keeps the from falling apart while grilling and keeps them juicy!

Awesome!  I didnt have any fresh jalapenos, so I just chopped up some sliced jalapenos from a jar and added a little of the juice to the mix.  I also added some dried steak seasoning and garlic powder.  My husband loved them.

These were fantastic. What a hit in our family!  Some of the family can’t eat spicy so I took half the cream cheese mix and (without jalapeño) and added bacon, dry ranch dressing and a splash of ketchup.  Another yummy combo. Everyone was happy. Just be careful when you bite in...tends to “squish”  and “squirt”

We have a bumper crop of fresh jalapeno peppers in the garden this summer and went looking for ways to use them creatively. This recipe was awesome!!! I did follow a few suggestions and seasoned the meat (salt, pepper, garlic powder). I only used half of the cream cheese the recipe called for and it was plenty. I used 90% ground beef because that's what I had (usually use 85% for burgers). It worked out well because fattier beef would have shrunk more. It was difficult keeping the cheese inside the burger, but I made it work. We will absolutely be making these again!

I did this as directed, loved it as is!  Took it to the next level (for my personal preferences) the second time adding fresh minced garlic to the meat, used herbs and spices cream cheese with the jalapeno for extra flavor, then seasoned stuffed patties with seasoned salt.  This was a top 5 for me!  Thanks for the great idea!

This was the best burger I ever made, so much flavor. I too had trouble flipping them but the second batch I put on grill was easier since I had them sitting in the fridge for minute, it seemed to help them from breaking apart once I did put them on the grill.

Loved it! But has anyone else had trouble with keeping their form, or have any pointers? It was delicious all the same, although I only used 1 8 oz package of cream cheese, but it ended up as spaghetti meat which I just put in a bun. Let me know!

My husband and I love jalapeño poppers, and we LOVE these burgers! We made the stuffed version and the mixed version from the same batch since we had never made stuffed ones before.  These turned out delicious! We decided to add the onions and bacon to the cream cheese, and garlic powder and A-1 sauce to the hamburger meat. The cheese did ooze from both when we cooked them on the grill. These were a welcomed change from regular burgers!  We will be making these again!

Really enjoyed these. Only one burger oozed and that was the one I put too much filling in. We only used one box of cream cheese and I'm glad because hubby has a hard time making smaller burgers so we only got 5, not 8 and still had extra filling left over. The extra filling was also great to add on top of the burger! Only other change was to add an egg to the ground beef to help bind it since a common concern in reviews was the breakage. I chopped the jalapenos in the mini processor then added the cream cheese to mix. Worked beautifully. We will make these again for sure. Thank you  Noelle C :) for your recipe

These were great, a big hit with the family.. Only adjustment I made was I did half and half beef and ground pork, thought the cream cheese would pore out whilst being cooked.. Not at all... Delicious

Very interesting take on cream cheese jalapeño! Definitely worth a repeat! Only complain is that there is way too much cream cheese. For just 4 patties worth of cream cheese, you really only need 1 8oz put of cream cheese and 1 cup of jalapeño...

If I had to do the recipe over again I would use less cream cheese. I thought it overpowered the beef.

Very bland.  The burger itself needs some type of seasoning.  Trying to keep the cream cheese mixture in the burger was impossible.  We won't be having these again.

I loved these burgers, of course I love anything jalapeno.  I would not suggest topping them with ketchup and all that, I served them with extra cream cheese and jalapeno on top to give it even more jalapeno flavor...Perfect burger for a jalapeno lover.

Were these gluttonous, or what. We just mixed the jalapenos in (with a little salt) and grilled them on the george foreman. Once they came off the grill, a nice swipe of soft cream cheese, mmm... I'm sad to say we ate these without buns, off the plate, as we cooked them. Whether it was because we were hungry or they were super tasty is debatable, but either way, we'll be making these again.

I tried to make stuffed burgers as written, but it wasn't going to happen so mixed the cream cheese mixture into beef.  I also left some of the mixture to spread on bun.  I had trouble with them crumbling on the grill.  Overall the taste was just ok we thought.  The beef needs a little seasoning in my opinion.   Thanks for sharing, glad I tried them!

These were pretty good burgers, but they didn't work for us. The middle wouldn't cook so we had to take them apart and cook them as regular hamburgers then we topped them with the cream cheese/jalapeno mixture and bacon. Also we seasoned the meat with simple salt and pepper. It was pretty good but I think it would have been better if they would have cooked all the way with the mixture inside.

If you make these, use 1/4 the cream cheese and 1/4 the jalapenos. I used 1/2 and still had too much. None of us really liked these burgers.  In the mid-80's there was a restaurant in Tampa called Jimmy Mac's that had great burgers.  One was the Classy with cream cheese on top.  That was better.  These were really messy.  We saw no point to stuffing the burger when spreading the mixture on the bun would be neater.  I tried making a meatball, making a hole and filling it but that didn't work at all.

These were DELICIOUS!!  Don't be afraid to add enough jalapenos, i was nervous it would turn out too spicy so i only added 1 jalapeno, next time i will be adding the full amount!!

There's nothing in here about seasoning the meat, i used Lawry's garlic salt and pepper to taste.  

ENJOY!!

Need to flavor the meat, not just stuffing it.  You really have to make sure that they are sealed.  I tried this and while the burger was moist, I think cuz of the cream cheese that pretty much oozed out, it really lacked flavor of the meat itself.  The part that I did get from the stuffing was good and reminded me of a jalapeno popper.  I just was not wow'd by this at all.

I just tried this for my boyfriend and it was AMAZING. He loves burgers and he kept on raving about it and even ate my leftovers.

I did change a few things though. I added minced garlic, green onions, black pepper and all purpose seasoning to the patty mixture.  

I also mixed in 1 part minced pork to 2 parts minced lean beef to add some fat and this helped the burger stay together and it was PERFECT!!

The flavour was insane, I stuffed the mixture inside. I did it in a very hot saucepan and then covered it to steam so that it could cook all the way through. 

I then placed a slice of sharp cheddar cheese on top to add to the cheesiness of it and some crispy strips of bacon.

This is not your everyday burger but it was sinfully good.

I put 2 eggs in the meat mixture to hold it together, flattened it out like a pancake as others suggested, placed a huge spoonful of the cream cheese mixture in the middle then closed up the patty.  I baked it in the oven for 20 minutes, then pan- fried for one minute on each side. A little bit on the dry side for me, maybe bake a little less. And don't forget to add seasonings.

My hubby liked the burgers as did I. The only ting I'd do differently next time is make half of the filling and fill them less. When you bite into them you loose most of the filling and I'm not a huge fan of filling anyways. I will absolutely make this recipe again!

Yes, a tasty burger and definitely different than your standard burger.  But I felt this was a little too heavy and filling.  Had a nice taste but maybe I put too much of the cream cheese mixture in the center, and some bites were too cream cheesy for me.  Probably won't make this again.

Very good recipe! I used low fat cream cheese and mixed in bacon bits. The jalapenos I used weren't very spicy, maybe next time I'll leave in the seeds.

These burgers are really good. If the jalepenos are too spicy for you you can use a red/green pepper combination.

FABULOUS! My husband didn't love the idea of a "filling" so I blended the cream cheese (about 3 oz) into the meat and added 2 jalapeno's, worchester sauce, garlic powder, salt, pepper, a tablespoon of ranch seasoning and cayenne. I just looked at the original recipe and this is nothing like it but it is still really, really good!

Definitely a nice switch from regular burgers.  We used light cream cheese and fresh chile peppers - yowza!  Definitely has a kick to it.  Needs a little salt so I would suggest putting something in the hamburger meat to add a salty flavor.  Will make these again for sure.

Very yummy burger. I chopped up some cilantro and garlic and put it in the cream cheese mix as well. I didn't this time but next time I will add some pepper and cumin to the mix as well. I put my avocado cream sauce instead of mayo and topped with cilantro sprigs and salsa. Sooo good!

Flavor: OK. Having nasty liquid cream cheese squirt out on you: pretty gross! Leftovers: wish I hadn't. Would have been better mashing the jalapeno bits into the meat.

Wonderful recipe!  You do only need about 1/2 of the filling there was way to much.  I added 1/2 pack dry ranch to the cream cheese mixture because that's what we use to stuff our peppers, supper yummy.  We also did use foil on the grill instead of oil.  All the filling stayed in and they tasted so good !!

Delicious! Added to burger as a spread, didn't want to risk not getting the meat pinched tight enough. Can't leave out the bacon either, adds a nice smoky touch.

These were super easy to make.  Definitely season the meat before cooking.  I seasoned with Worcestershire, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  My husband LOVED these!  I liked the taste of the cream cheese but the jalapenos were too hot for me!  I think next time I will make his with jalapenos and mine with either green chiles or onions or maybe even mushrooms and cream cheese, or I may just use the cream cheese only.  Great idea for some extra taste to the burger.

I just got making these on the George Foreman. They turned out great but I would agree that they are messy.  I took hamburger and flattened it out like a pancake and cut the hamburger in half.  I spooned the cream cheese mix into one half and placed the other half on top.  Make sure you cook the hamburger until well done or there will be blood in the cheese.  I used half of the jalapenos called and it was perfect.

I used 8 oz fat free cream cheese and 2 chopped jalapenos for the 8 burgers (1/3 lb each) that I made and it was tasty!  I imagine you get a bit more flavor from full-fat cream cheese, but this was an excellent substitution for far fewer calories :)

We really liked this combo.  I did 2 jalapeños and 4 oz. (1/2 block) of cream cheese.  Next time we will add bacon strips to the burger or even crumbled bacon to the filling, it needs a little saltiness to balance everything.

The meat needs to be seasoned--I used a ranch burger recipe from this site.  These were SO messy.  I thought I had the perfect 'seal' and let them set up in the fridge all day.  They ended up coming right apart.  They're just so BIG.  It was toooo spicy for me as well.  Net time, I will make the burgers regular and use the cream cheese/jalapeño  filling as a spread instead of a stuffing.

These are very good, albeit messy. I think I made the burgers too big and they came apart, and when they were done grilling it was like a doublestack with filling in between. This would also make for a great spread to just put on the bun after the seasoned burger is done.  I'll make it again that way.

I think it might be good with the cheese mixture spread on the bun, but they were just oozing and gross with it inside. Won't make again.

I made these with 1 8oz pkg cream cheese for 2lbs beef, added chopped red onion, chopped fresh cilantro, and 2 chopped jalapeno peppers to the cream cheese. (used low fat neufchatel) I also used 95% lean beef...served on toasted onion rolls. Most people dipped in bbq sauce or mustard. These were a WINNER and hope to make them again! LOVED THEM - not one left!

After my teenage son took his first bite, he said, "This is the best thing I have ever tasted."  Even my other son who usually doesn't like jalapenos liked them. We followed the recipe exactly - no need to change a thing!

Wow, these were great! I made them with ground turkey instead of ground beef and also added cilatro to the cream cheese mixture. I recently made these again and toppped them with left over pico de gallo, it was a great addition!

This sounded pretty good, but had no seasoning in the recipe.  To try, I sized this to one large burger and added salt, pepper, onion powder, celery seed and worcestershire sauce to some ground round.  I did the two thin patties and sealed in the cream cheese jalapeno mix.  You have to really pay attention to sealing it well.  I grilled on an open grill about 8-9 minutes per side.  What resulted was a very pretty, perfectly shaped cheese filled meat packet.  I took to heart another reviewer's caution not to overpower the burger with too many condiments.  On each side of a kaiser roll I placed mayonnaise, then added meat patty, slice of homegrown tomato and romaine lettuce leaf.  It was an excellent burger.  I always ask myself if I would make a recipe again.  In this case, I would not make it this way.  Making the filled patty was just too time consuming.  I could get the same flavor by just topping the burger with it and could cut the work in half.  Good burger though.

great as wrote, love them, but I found it easy to stuff if you cut and then chill the cream cheese, much easier to form the burger.

YUM...These were very good, very messy, but very good! I scaled the recipe back to make 2 burgers and used jarred jalapenos instead of fresh (they were too expensive at the store). The spice in these were great and I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a great hamburger.  I had no issues with the cream cheese/jalepeno mixture oozing out.  How I did it was form out 4 patties (I was making 2 burgers), and on 2 of the patties, made an indentation in the middle for the mixture to go in.  I put the 4 patties in the fridge for about an hour, then filled them.  I used a fork to score the edges of the burgers to ensure that they would not fall apart.  My only reason for giving this 4 out of 5 stars is I think it would have been tastier if the filling had more of a zip or tang taste to it.  I didnt want to put the usual ketchup on them, because I was unsure of how it would taste with the cream cheese.  Overall, these were great.  I will definitly be making these again, only changing the mixture recipe a little to give it some more flavor.

These were very good.  I made half the original recipe.  I didn't have fresh jalapeno, but I did have a 4 oz can of hot diced jalapeno and used that, which worked very well.  Other ingredient amounts were proportionate.  A little messy, but not bad.  I cooked them in a frying pan which worked very well, and seasoned them.  Remember, 1/4" is thin - I flattened them out on wax paper, with the top and bottom side by side.  I had some extra filling and I thought I was pretty generous in stuffing the burgers.  Will try to find something else to do with it, because its delicious!

hubby loved it, i made a few changes cause he's a heat freak. seasoned the meat w/cayenne,season salt, black pepper and pepper flakes.  did not seed the jalapenos and added some habenero sauce to the cream cheese mixture. Sliced fresh hot banana peppers for the condiment and put a smear of cream cheese on the bun.  very happy with results will make this again

Yummy. My jalapenos were not very hot, so I added a dash of habanero sauce to the cream cheese mixture. Turned out perfectly.

very tasty-I used canned chopped jalapenos instead of fresh but it was very good and I was pleasantly surprised that they weren't too hot.  Just a nice bite. We used lettuce wraps instead of buns. Great!

Very good but too much cream cheese mixture to stuff between patties.  Agree to use half to stuff and other half on buns. I added bacon on top of patties to make it taste like one of our all time favorites of Jalapeno Poppers!

This is a simple and great idea! Make sure you make the patties BIG. I made mine palm sized and they shrunk a lot.  I'd would make them an 8 inch diameter next time. And make sure to put the cheese mixture in the very middle and have a good amount of hamburger left to seal around it or they will pop open on the grill. I also seasoned the meat with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion salt. And I add butter (makes the meat SO juicy). I usually add about a Tbsp per pound. Very good!

These burgers were fantastic! Because we are from Jamaica however, I did season the ground beef with chopped onions, thyme and oregano beforehand. Instead of using regular hamburger buns, I used Rosemary crustini buns - I will make this again and again and again!

I was very dissapointed in this recipe. I was so pumped up over it, since I love bacon wrapped jalapenos. I topped it with bacon. First of all, there was way too much filling. You could easily cut down to 1 cup of cream cheese and 1 cup of chopped jalapenos. Secondly, the meat had no flavor. Yes, it was moist, but no moister than my go to recipe, which is a pound of meat to a pkg of ranch. I was very surprised by the results, since everyone else thought it was so amazing. Mabey it would have been better if I hadn't of seeded the jalapenos like the recipe requested. I don't know, but I probablt wont ever try it again.

Very tasty but I modified it.  I used diced jarred jalapenos and reduced the amount.  It added a lot of kick.  It really tasted like Jalapeno Poppers.  Will make again.

These burgers were great. I mixed a package of ranch dressing mix with the cream cheese and jalapenos.  We did have leftover cream cheese mixture, so I added a couple tablespoons of sour cream to it and we ate that on chips and mixed it in baked potatoes.  They were the best baked potatoes ever!

Wow, these were spicy! I cut this in half and used a little less than a small can of diced jalapeno. There was way too much cream cheese for the filling too. None of us really cared for the cream cheese part at all and would love poppers but they didn't work in the burger for us. Thanks anyway, it was fun trying something new.

These are really good!  Make sure you chop the jalapenos fine so you can fit a lot more inside the burgers.  I've only made them once but I'll make them a lot more I'm sure, and I'm sure they'll just get better and better.

Great Burgers! Everyone loved them! We added some sliced cheddar cheese to the top and they were delicous.

Some were scared to try it in their burgers so they spread it on the buns.  It was good that way too.

Excellent recipe!  I used Jalapeno for me and banana peppers for my wife as she doesn't like as much spice.  This is a great summer bbq burger.  Thanks for sharing!

These were great.  We made the mistake and did NOT oil our grill.  Our burgers started to fall apart a little but they tasted great!  We did only end up using 1 cup of jalapenos and that was plenty.

Really great! I tweaked them a little though(no jalapenos!). The only problem was that they started coming apart in the middle of cooking, which I did on the stove.

Great recipe, I like to use twice the meat per patty because I use a lot of Cream Cheese.  My Wife loves to eat them and I love how easy they are to make.

These were seriously lacking something the first time I tried them.  I cooked them in the George Foreman grill which pressed them down too much, and they needed some sort of sauce but I wasn't sure what.  The second time I made a few additions:  a bit of minced onion and garlic in the meat, and Southwest Dipping Sauce (recipe by USMCWIFE03) to top it off.  I cooked these in the skillet so they wouldn't get flattened.  They turned out MUCH jucier and the sauce added exactly the kick they were needing!  This was a great use for some home-grown jalapenos from a friend's garden.

Sorry, I can think of better things to do with cream cheese and ground beef.  The amount of jalapenos were just too much for my taste and I like food really spicy. I even cut back to 1/2 the amount.  I will not make again.

A bit difficult to keep the cheese from leaking out, but turned out fine. Delicious flavor. Added bacon and onion on top. Will definitely make again. Husband loved it.

Great recipe, have used it many times!
RECOMMENDED: For folks saying it's too messy, I usually make the CC and Jalapeno mix and refrigerate it for a bit before putting 1/4lb patties around it, and then usually re-refrigerate.

Ridiculous to expect 2# of ground beef to make eight stuffed burgers. A crazy small amount of beef for a crazy large amount of cream cheese. I only used half the cream cheese called for and it was oozing out, and the uberthin patties of meat fell apart. I ended up using the leftover cream cheese mixture as a topping as I ate it with a knife and fork off my plate.  If you want to make this, read all the reviews for work arounds before trying it.

I am giving this three stars instead of two because I mixed the cream cheese into the burger instead of filling plain burgers with spicy cream cheese. Maybe as written it would be better. But actually, I think that mixing the jalapeño cream cheese in was all that gave the meat flavor. Add salt, pepper, garlic, and other seasonings to the meat and it *might* be a four-star recipe. As is it was wildly dull. I used fresh jalapeños; jarred might be better. I also used garlic herb cream cheese, but the extra flavor didn’t help.

I loved this idea, but the hamburger really needs some kind of binder like eggs. I added a bunch of spices, and I got 6 hamburgers out of two pounds.

I loved the taste of these burgers. My sons HAD to put ketchup on it as he's obsessed with ketchup.  It was a cold night so I didn't feel like putting them on the grill so I cooked them in a toaster over. So good. I will make again.

I halved the filling and that was still more than enough for the 2lbs of meat we had.  The burgers were good, not as good as I was expecting, but still good.  I felt they were a little bland, even after adding diced onion, garlic and cilantro to the meat and dusting the burgers with black pepper.  They held together okay, but did separate a little.  I feel like this recipe needs "something" to get it to really be a knock-out, but not sure what...

This was incredibly good! My only deviation from the ingredients as written, because I fried some bacon to put on the burgers with lettuce and tomato, was some chopped mushrooms I cooked in the bacon drippings and then added to the cream cheese/jalapeño mixture. It was really cold outside, so I cooked my burgers in a cast iron skillet with a lid to hold in the heat. They were moist, evenly cooked through, and phenomenal. I haven't had a better burger anywhere. I agree with others that condiments are unnecessary and might take away from the overall taste. Everyone loved these!

i used this as a base for what bf wanted for dinner.. i scaled this down to two servings to make one big 8 oz burger in our Stufz burger press.. i used a little less than half the jalapeno (pickled) called for and an equal amount of chopped onion.. halved the cream cheese.. and seasoned the ground *turkey* with 1/2 tsp of montreal steak seasoning and a dash of cumin.. had to pan fry the burger as it was raining outside.. bf really enjoyed it.. ty for the inspiration

These were a huge hit among all my friends who loved them so much, they ate at least 2 each (and I make them big)! Super delicious and so easy to make. Have made it numerous times since everyone is always asking :) 

Melt your favorite cheese on top and don't forget to season your burgers!

Very good ~  we used the exact recipe for the cream cheese/jalapenos; but we didnt put it in the burger.   We cooked the burgers;  then sliced horizontally; then spread on the cream cheese and topped with the other half of the burger.

very good, and juicy, mine turned out very thick, but wonderful.  I didn't use quite as much jalapenos as the receipe said, but I should have, they were very mild.

So I have made this recipe before,  my only changes and additions would be: 1. Slice the raw jalapeños length wise in half and seed them,  then soak them in olive oil and salt and pepper for about two hours.  Then grill the peppers until soft,  then Co then up and add them to the cream cheese.  2. Add crumpled bacon to the jalepeno cream cheese mix.  Makes a very nice flavor that cooks into the meat.

Great recipe! So simple but yet so delicious! The only thing I did differently was... I sauteed the jalapenos for a few minutes before I mixed it with the cream cheese. Thanks for sharing!

Loved these burgers!  We added crispy bacon and onion that was cooked with bacon to the meat mixture as well as salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Montreal Steak seasoning.

What a delicious kick to a hamburger.  My hamburgers were already formed when I found this recipe, so I put the stuffing on the top rather than in the middle.  I made half of them with the cream cheese and the jalapeños and the other half with mayonnaise, feta cheese and jalapeños for my cream cheese hating husband.  The burgers had a wonderful flavor to them.  The jalapeños added just the right amount of spice and the creaminess of the cream cheese was wonderful.  We will be enjoying this one again.

We made these in the summer and they were fantastic!  The only thing we'll be doing this summer is trying them with buffalo for a more healthy burger option and trying the herb and butter cream cheese!

Cook slim patties first, then add the middle mixture. Less mess on the George Foreman grill. Also, use foil on both sides of the grill. These are a big hit at my house!

i tried following the advice of other readers, and just mixed it all together, but i gotta say the texture and taste was just not at all what i was aiming for. i kept it simple with just some lettuce and a tad of mayo on the bun, but this one just wasnt working for me. Sorry :( will give it another try, maybe it was just an off kinda day

I could not get my cheeseburgers to stay "closed".  Tasted fine, but next time I would just top with the mixture instead of trying to stuff.

These were pretty good. The only thing I would recommend is to season the meat first. I did use canned diced jalapenos and the burgers were VERY spicy!

these were absolutely awesome!  i didnt have any jalepenos so i added a little garlic and bacon to to cream cheese mixture. the only problem i had was getting them to cook on the grill. they immediately fell apart and i had to take them off and finish in the oven. but the leftovers were even better the next day!

Ok these burgers were great! However mine kinda slid apart. I didn't get a good seal on them. I did change up the sour cream mixture by adding 1T cajun seasoning, 2t garlic powder and 1T worcestshire. Ionly used 1 lb burger and 1 8oz cream cheese for 3 big burgers. Topped with guac & crumbled bacon! Delish! Any suggestions for keepin patties together would be great! Will try again tho!  estshire

I love this easy recipe and it tastes very good. My family (4 people) cannot take too spicy stuff so I used a half can of jelapeno and chopped it real fine and mix into the 8oz of soften cream cheeze. It just turned out perfectly level of taste for us. but next time need to seal the hamburger real good becoz mine were leaking out to the grill and it was a bit messy.

I followed the recipe as-is. Everyone liked them but nobody LOVED them. I guess with all of the reviews I may have just expected TOO much out of them. I'm not sure. I hate to give it 3 stars but it seems fair. Not the best I've ever had but far from the worst.

This was by far the best burger I've had in a very long time. I only used a 4oz. can of diced jalapenos but it seemed to do the trick. Even without seasoning it was fantastic. THIS is how a burger should taste!

I changed the recipe a lot.  The beef would have been way to bland with no spices for our liking so I added salt, ground red chillies, ground coriander seed, some very finely chopped green chillies, cilantro and onion.  I made the burgers into sliders and instead of making two patties and trying to seal them, I made one bigger patty, put the jalapenos (some with banana peppers just to try) and the cream cheese (which I had cut into small cubes) in the center and folded the rest of the patty around it. (like making a stuffed bun) I baked them in the oven on a lined cookie sheet for about 20 minutes then lightly pan fried (no oil) before serving to warm them up and make the colour a bit browner.  Served them on low fat multi grain slider buns. FANTASTIC!! AND they were so darned CUTE!

I love spicy food and couldn't help changing this up a bit.  To the beef I added garlic and onion powder, cajun seasoning, chopped onion, soy and Worcestershire sauces, and a few drops of Liquid Smoke.  I added some feta to the cream cheese/jalapeno mixture and made sure the top and bottom patties were well sealed.  They were cooked in a frying pan since the grill died recently.  These were out of this world -- definitely a keeper.

I used 1lb ground turkey instead of ground beef, and added an egg white to the mixture. I also used canned jalepeños instead and mixed them into the cream cheese. These were just okay. They were fast and pretty tasty. "Not bad" is the review I got from my boyfriend. I think I will try this again but with chilis in adobo sauce next time.

Mmm mmm mmm! I loved this idea! I used fat free cream cheese (as I always do) and I don't think that I would have noticed any difference in taste! I really liked these hamburgers and will probably put them in my different-hamburger rotation ;) I also added a touch of chili powder; personal preference as I love chili flavor! I didn't need anything else on the hamburger except for lettuce and tomato!

I cut down on the cream cheese, but still had way more than I needed. I was afraid to use all the called for jalapenos, but really should have. I used ground chicken and had no problem with the patties sticking together and nothing oozed out during the grilling. Oiling the grill was essential. I did sprinkle seasoned salt on the burgers before grilling as it seemed to need something. We eat our burgers without the bun and these were delicious. Next time I will add more peppers and maybe only 4 oz cream cheese. A great way to add variety to your burgers.

Pretty tasty, for something so simple.  My family wasn't up for something different, so I just made one for me by chopped 1 tablespoon of chopped jalapenos (I used jarred macho-style slices to begin with) and mixing it with a tablespoon of cream cheese.   Nice zing, and the cream cheese contrasts it nicely.  Will definitely do these again when we have company! Thanks, Noelle!

Tasty. They did fall apart a little bit but they still tasted tasty. I only used about 1 lbs of ground beef and 4 oz of cream cheese and a handful of chopped pickled jalapenos.

Very Intersting.  I halved the recipe for just my mother and I.  We both enjoy eating jalapenos, and enjoyed the creaming mixture in the center.  I didn't grill these.  Just cooked in a skillet on the stove, which worked, but would like to try these on the grill.

I just made these the other night and they were great!   I didn't have jalapeno's so I used a 4 oz can of mild diced chiles. I only used one package of cream cheese.  I mixed everything up instead of putting it in the middle....I added one egg because of comments stating that it falls apart... and it still did with the egg in it.   Because of mixing everything together the burgers stuck to the pan quite a big, BUT, I don't even think I'm going to try it the other way because it was still AWESOME. I think having the cream cheese cooking onto the pan with the burger is what I liked the most.   So I'll probably update this again at some point because I plan on having this quite often.

This recipe was super yummy. We had a hard time keeping the cheese in the middle though even with pinching the sides. The cream cheese & jalepeno mixture was also really good as a dip with chip!! We had some left over. :)

This was beyond yummy !!!! To save time/hassle I grilled my burgers with a montreal steak seasoning and in a separate container mixed the cream cheese and minced up jalapenos.  When burgers were ready I just spread it on top like it was ketchup !!  Even the kids loved it !!

Okay the thought of putting 2 cups of chopped jalapeno's in the bugers didn't sound right to me.   I thought it would be way too hot.  So, I put less then half the amount called for.  Guess what?  Next time I'd use close the amount called for--since they really where not hot at all.  My husband wasn't too crazy over these burgers, the kids really liked them.  I think he over grilled them--worried the centers where not getting done--so they where somewhat dry.

I spaced on the directions and added my jalapenos to the meat mixture. I thought that's what it said to do! Since I thought that was a pretty awful idea, I also added a couple of eggs to use as a binder. It worked more or less ok. By the end I had too much cream cheese mixture for the amount of meat I had left, so I had to make some blended meat & cheese patties, which cooked up rather interestingly. I didn't care for the flavor of these -- but that's probably because I just wasn't hungry. My husband loved them, and the cooking error was all my own fault, so I'll give them a 4. Thanks for the recipe!

These Burgers were fantastic! We did a few things different. We marinated the ground beef with soy sauce, garlic salt, cumin, black pepper and onion powder. We also added chopped garlic and roasted red pepper. Overall, these turned out great. The cream cheese jalepeno mix added great flavor to the burger. Highly recommend this recipe, will make this again!

I'm giving this five stars, although it didn't really turn out for me. However, I think that is my fault and not the recipe. I don't have an outdoor grill so I tried to do it on the indoor grill. Big mistake. All of the cream cheese melted out and left just jalapenos in the middle. Made a big mess as well. The one thing I can say, though, is that you can easily reduce the filling by half. I had a ton leftover. I will keep this one for when we get an outdoor grill. Thanks for sharing!

This has become a Family Favorite! I did also find that the cream cheese did ooze out of some...in a time pintch I've mixed up the cream cheese and Jalapeno's and used it as a Spead for the Burgers. NO ONE Complained and it was Much easier and less Messy!  Also when using it as a spread...set out some Guacamole, they were putting it on anything they could find. Made a Great Combo on the burgers.

Very tasty. You can reduce the amount of cream cheese in this recipe. Using this much will leave you with a lot of unused cheese mix.  Be careful with the amount of jalapeno/cheese filling you put between the patties. I was a little over zealous and had cream cheese oozing onto the grill after the flip.

SO GOOD. my hubby never gives 5 stars and this got it!   i was worried that the burgers wouldn't stay together and they kind of didn't...so i docked a star because i think maybe there need to be some eggs/breadcrumbs/something to make the burger stay together better.  next time i will make the burger part differently - but i am definitely keeping the centre mix! YUM.

I thought these burgers were okay. I like the cream cheese/jalapeno filling but i also have a hard time keeping the cheese inside. I am going to try this recipe again. The family said they were okay but lacked a little flavor mabye I will put pepperjack cheese on top.

this sounds like such a good idea but they totally fell apart.  they cooked on one side and when we tried to flip them, the crumbled.  becareful too, jalapeno juice sticks to everything and doesnt just wash off your skin.  ive heard of people putting the creamcheese in the middle of the burger so it doesnt fall apart.  maybe that would work better.  sorry for the bad review.

Fantastic. Used the extra cream cheese/jalapeno mixture the next day in an omelet.

I can't review the recipe as written because we subbed a couple of things based on what we had in the fridge.  We used Neufchatel cheese and pickled jalapenos from the jar.  They were delicious!  We'll just need to cook them at a lower temp next time to make sure the outside doesn't char, but the cheese still melts.  We really enjoyed them with bacon and tomato on the burgers.

The burgers did not hold up well at all, and the overall taste was not very good. I think a regularly seasoned hamburger is going to be my burger of choice in the future. Now what to do with this tomato?

The flavor was great.  I tried to make the patties thin but they were still too big for everyone.  Next time I will do as others have done and mix the cream cheese and jalapeno into the ground beef before grilling.

Awesome! Made this with ground bison, used canned jalepenos, cream cheese and jalepeno pepper jelly for the filling. I agree with one of the other reviews when they said not to use ketchup or mustard, it will overpower the flavors, just mayo, lettuce and tomato!

I made them over a campfire this past weekend on a family camping trip.  They cook quite well and tasted good.  I agree that they could use something else in with the cream cheese mix.  Next time I think I will put some pepperjack cheese in with it.

it was messy to cook burgers with mixture in middle and then once on bun, it all oozed out as soon as you took a bite. I think messy is fine as long as it tastes really good and for me it needed more seasoning besides cream cheese/jalop mixture.I'm willing to try making it again with more seasoning or also mixing it all together so it's less messy...

I heard angels singing when I took my first bite. I took a glance at this recipe and off I went. I Used this recipe for game day... I used one package of chive and onion cream cheese and a quarter bar of regular cream cheese. Got pickeled Jalapenos and removed the seeds so it wouldnt be too hot for my family. In addition I added 6 Peices of cooked bacon and stuffed the burgers. I seasoned them with daddy hikles garlic and onion seasoning and nothing else. WOWWEE!! everyone loved them who was sceptable they were best plain without extra condiments. Next time i will make extra filling to spread on my toasted bun!!!

I added some stuff. Made it into like a meatloaf with egg, bread crumbs, worster. sauce, milk, seasonings. It turned out GREAT! They puffed up in fact which made it even better. Mom used to fix these years ago and called them "pocket burgers" ... very good!

These were really great! I used some canned mild jalepenos and added some green onion to the cream cheese mixture. Excellent. Oh, and I don't have a grill so I broiled these. Awesome burger :)

Great!  We loved finding another use for our garden jalapenos!  I would maybe mix some of the mixture in the meat next time.  There was so much of it to try to pinch into the center of the hambuger.

Absolutely delicious. Very easy to make. What I learned was I need to seal the sides of the two patties a bit more next time. However, they still hardly leaked and were amazing.

Ah these are awesome. very easy to throw together and taste so good! Definitly add bacon on top and dont dress it up too much, it takes away from the taste. I also used onion and chive cream cheese. Delicious!

These are amazing!  It's my favorite way to cook burgers now.  If you're short on time, it's also just as good to cook the burgers as you usually would and just top them with the cream cheese mixture.

Excellent burgers! I will continue to make them this way now :) Thank you so very much for the recipe.  I did only use 1 block of cream cheese w/2 lbs of Hamburger and it was plenty also I did add 2 TBSP Garlic Powder to mine and 1/4 c diced jar jalepenos (what I had on hand).  I also made the kids some without the jalepenos and added garlic herb seasoning from Mrs.Dash to theirs :) Very moist and juicy burgers with loads of flavor.  I can not wait to have these again.

I used ortega diced green chilies instead of Jalapenos because my young children don't like the spice.  They were excellent.

I couldn't say first hand how these were because I am vegetarian but my hubby thought they were great. I added onion soup mix, Italian dressing mix, a little ranch dressing mix, a little taco seasoning and pepper to the meat. For the filling, onion and chive cream cheese, Tapatio hot sauce ( didn't have peppers ) and shredded cheese. He grilled them, he loved them. He'll want them again, soon !

I really downsized this recipe. I only used one pound of hamburger meat (it's just me and my husband), 4 oz cream cheese, and 1 jalapeno. The burgers were slightly messy, but the cream cheese mixture is great!!!

These were very good and easy to make.  Cut jalapeno in half because I was afraid it would be too hot but they ended up not hot enough - will make again with all the jalapeno.

Wow! I could not believe how good these were! My husband likes a thick burger but I like mine well done but not burnt or dry. This makes them perfect for both of us. They are so moist and fresh tasting with the mixture of cream cheese and jalapeno in the middle.I will be making these again and again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These were good, but definatley needed seasoning. I don't eat beef very often and to be honest I forgot how to make burgers! I only put seasoning salt & fresh pepper on the tops and the meat ended up kinda bland. It could be because I used the 93/7% ground beef. Also, I baked and broiled in the oven so we figured it would have tasted much better over flame. I scaled down but ended up making the burgers too big too. I also put a lot of the cheese mixture in and the tops were so rounded they looked like giant burger balls! As we ate them my boyfriend looked at me and said "are you adverising for Carl's Jr?" because it was all over my face. :) I however had no trouble with the cheese oozing out so they did look pretty cool! I will make a few changes next time. 1)Make smaller burger patties & flatten well! 2)Season both patties before assembling. 3)Use less cheese mixture between the hamburgers. 4)Grill! After I try it with these changes, I would also like to experiment with crumbled bacon or bacon bits like another reviewer suggested. Great recipe! Thanks!

Awesome. Made these for the second time tonight and they were a big hit. I seasoned the patties with garlic powder, salt, and pepper before grilling. My husband said "A+". Thanks! :)
