I liked this recipe. It was heady with all the spices but it worked well together and smelled great while cooking. I subbed a mixture of canned and bottled coconut milk for the whipping cream which I thought was a good choice that fit well for this  Indian dish. It was super easy and I would make it again.  Thanks for adding this wonderful recipe.

This is quite nice. I typically don't like half of the spices listed, but they work well here because they go so well with all the flavors. The method is simple and easy to follow. All-in-all, this is an excellent recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.

Very tasty! I didn't have the chili powder, cayenne or fresh tomatoes, so substituted a can of pureed tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Served with garlic naan.  Looking forward to the leftovers! 
For the reviewer who said this is not a soup, that's right - this dish isn't meant to be a soup, either. Don't try to thin it. And for those who think it's too sweet, tradionally, makhani has a definite sweetness to it. This was a great hearty vegetarian meal for a cold night ??

Too much cinnamon, it overpowered the other spices way too much.  Though the author did say she enjoyed a sweet dal so that's to be expected.  For a spicier Dal I use 1/2 Tbs Cinnamon and then 2 Tbs Cayenne and chile powder.  Other than that the texture was great, it was very fragrant and a lot of fun to make!  I substituted lemon juice instead of lime.

We loved it! I left out the sugar since I don't like sweets. I also cut down on chilly because my son wouldn't eat it. it was still delicious!

This is not a soup, but a thick sauce. I had to add more tomatoes and beans and wish it had more lentils. I added almost a whole container of vegetable broth. Would not make this again.
