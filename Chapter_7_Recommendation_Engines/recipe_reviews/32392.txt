This recipe was very interesting. I made a few adjustments though. I used orange juice instead of grape juice. I scaled the water down to 1/4 cup and the juice to 3/4 cup. It tasted just like orange soda only better.

I thought the water and baking soda made it taste a little bad.

I will not be using this recipe again. The flavor was overpowered by the baking-soda and tasted horrible.

I too used 1/4 cup of water & 3/4 cup of juice (I used white grape). The grands loved them...I thought they tasted OK. Thanks!

I made this a number of times since I wanted to use up some baking soda. I made it exactly as written and I found it underwhelming. It was barely fizzy at all. Maybe kids would indeed like it more but I haven't been one for decades. The taste was okay but this was just kind of boring.

The juice taste was over thrown by the baking soda.

I did not care for the baking soda. You get pretty much the same effect with 1 to 1 part of seltzer water and any juice!

I used 1 cup of Orange Juice but the flavor of the baking soda just pretty much overwhelmed the taste of anything else.

Turned out pretty good although you can make pretty much the same thing by just putting together seltzer and orange or grape juice. I used 3/4 cups of juice and 1/4 cup of water just like JWONG but i only put in 1/4 tsp of baking soda. The fizziness was sooo cool.:)
