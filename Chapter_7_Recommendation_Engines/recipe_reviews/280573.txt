Quick, easy, light, and tasty
I served this over rice and it was good. We did need an additional side dish. I think this would go well as a brunch item with scrambled eggs and toast.

Ok,  so I made this with a mixture of sweet and regular Italian sausage (I prefer it to turkey sausage; it's a texture thing). Very flavorful and delicious. I will make it again but, with a sauce per my wife's suggestion.  SUPER EASY to  make!

This recipe was good.  I made it as written and ate it over rice.  The turkey sausage I used broke out of it’s castings which make them look a little uglier, but still tasted good.  I think it could have use a little sauce of some sort to go with this dish.  I’ll make this again.

Very easy to make and very  tasty. A great Keto dish!  I didn’t have Italian turkey sausages so I used a chicken sausage I had on hand. It still turned out great. This is a recipe I will be making again!

I made this as my main course for dinner, and my whole family loved it! This such an easy recipe with lots of room for your own creativity. I had some squash to get rid of, so I diced that up and added it along with the peppers. I also used turkey sausage patties instead of links, and they worked absolutely fine. It’s hard to beat a recipe that is this simple and also healthy! It’s a mainstay for me, for sure!
