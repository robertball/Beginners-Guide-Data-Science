I wouldn't say that these taste like carrot cake, but I will say that they taste good.  Nice blend of spices, the carrots & raisins bring some moisture to the somewhat dense bars, and the OJ brightens the flavor just a little.  After taking the photo, I drizzled Yogurt Glaze from this site over the bars, and that brought them up to a 5-star recipe IMO.  Enjoyed!

This recipe takes a little time to prepare but it is worth it! It turned out so good. I changes a few things. Used some pineapple and substituted all the sugar with honey. 
Great recipe!
