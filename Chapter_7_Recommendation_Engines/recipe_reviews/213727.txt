The part of the title "Garlic Bread" doesn't fit the recipe in my opinion. I ended up using 3 cloves of garlic in this and using an immersion blender at the end to transform the soup into what became a cream-free tomato soup. It did need quite a bit of salt and pepper seasoning also. Pretty good soup with the changes. I think next time I would also add a little brown sugar too.

Is it meant to be a bread soup flavored with tomato and garlic? Or a tomato soup with garlic bread?  Not that adding .5 teaspoons of garlic adds garlic flavor anyway.
