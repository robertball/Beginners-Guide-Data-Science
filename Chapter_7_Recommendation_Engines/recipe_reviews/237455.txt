This is like a cross between a crepe and french toast, and I love the eye appeal you get with the rolls.  I used reduced-fat cream cheese, white bread (didn't have any wheat on hand) and did put a little butter in the skillet along with the oil.  The filling is loaded with luscious and creamy banana flavor with a hint of cinnamon and just enough sweetness.  A definite remake in this house with nice enough presentation for company brunch.  Thanks, Glo, for this wonderful new recipe.

Wow, these are fantastic! I used 2 teaspoons of sugar, as we didn't want it too sweet, and they came out wonderful!

If you like Bananas Foster you'd like these! The recipe as written makes too much filling though, and I needed more than 2 eggs. I suggest cutting the filling in half because I ended up using 14 pieces of bread and 6 eggs and STILL had about a cup of extra filling (which I was happy to eat with a spoon). That was using a heaping tablespoon of filling per roll and sorta trifolding them and sinching the ends so it didn't ooze out on my griddle. I dusted mine with powdered sugar and the kiddos ate them whole and dunked them in syrup. I think they'd be good with nuts incorporated for a Banana Nut Bread flavor.

These were fantastic!! My boys loved it. I think my bananas may have been too ripe cause the filling was pretty loose, so it oozed out some, but they were still delish!!  Can't wait to make this again!!

These are tasty, but beware of using dense wheat bread! We had difficulties rolling the bread and it resulted in crumbly French toasts.

I followed the exact directions- except I had to add some extra bread slices (my bread must have been smaller slices).  The cream cheese flavor was too much. I think some extra cinnamon and sugar might have helped.  2 out of my 3 of kids were not impressed.
