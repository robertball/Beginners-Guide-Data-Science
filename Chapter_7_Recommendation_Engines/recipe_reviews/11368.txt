I bought several of the ingredients in this recipe just to make it because it sounded so good but after I made it I was surprised that this recipe won any awards. The crust of this bar is very bland and the toppings just don't work together. I would not make this again.

The flavors of this dish are amazing but the bars don't hold well together.  I'm planning on using it as a topping for ice cream!

This was the first time I tried a recipe without reading the reviews first - what a mistake.  This recipe didn't work at all. I followed all the directions precisely and when I took it out of the oven for the second time it was just a mess.  Nothing held together at all.  I just mixed it all up and put it back in the oven to crisp it up a bit.

Very tasty and not too sweet.  A cross between a granola bar and a conventional square.  It does crumble a bit, so be sure to have a plate or napkin on hand!

Took out the brown sugar, added apple sauce, diced apricots, coconut, half the butter, and cocoa.    My guests consumed the whole batch in one sitting,  taking 2 and even 3   

Only cooked them for 10 mins so they wouldnt dry out....and pack them down at the start, midway and after we took them out.  
Not too sweet, but perfect with apricots.

Made 21/05/2011 for an early morning mtn bike ride. I subbed my home-made muesli for the oats/nuts/raisins. They are actually quite delicious- maybe too much sugar for the pre-ride? They reminded me of the Nutri-grain bars I used to take skiing in college. Yummy!

First: I made changes. I used butter in place of shortening, blueberry preserves in place of raspberry and removed the chocolate. My son and I made these together for him to enjoy with his siblings. They are a bit crumbly, that being said all 5 insisted I give it a 5 star review because "it tastes amazing" we will be making these again in the future and experimenting with different preserves.
