This is great, I'll be making this again many times.  I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts to the crust, increased the rhubarb to 4 cups & added an extra TBSP milk in the crust.  I have a rhubarb plant that is an over achiver and am always looking for new GOOD rhubarb recipes.  This one fits the bill.

Too much sugar sitting on top, though my husband liked the crunch because he didn't know it was a cup of sugar. Don't think I'll use this recipe again.

This is a SURPRISE!!! Lots of raves and oohs and ahhs. Used a 10" pie plate - had 5 cups of rhubarb so used it all - It turned out just super - sure will be making again and again.A little Ice cream or whip cream added on top just hit the spot.

It was great to see this recipe.  I received the recipe from my mom's neighbor 30 years ago and have never seen it in print since that time!!  It's been a family favorite for all these years, and every time I take it to a gathering it is also a hit.  Thanks for submitting it for others to see.  I've added other fresh berries along with with rhubarb which is also great.

My neighbor grows rhubarb and gave me some to use.  I made this pie and shared it with him.  I did use almost 5 cups of rhubarb as suggested and did use some brown sugar for the topping instead of all white.  Also added the walnuts as suggested.  Very very good!  Served it with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks!

Great recipe. Just make sure you use the 3 cups of rhubarb (could use up to 3 1/2 if wanted to), or you won't have alot of filling to equal with the crust. I used frozen rhubarb that i had put in the freezer, came out fine. My father loved it and hubby who isn't fond of rhubarb liked it too!!. I'd make again.

maybe it was too warm but I had to roll the pie crust out between plastic wrap.  The topping stirred into a batter and I added oatmeal to obtain crumble texture.  Still the gelatin kick was a hit flavour with the kids.

This was really good! Everyone loved it, and both neighbors wanted the recipe. A really easy recipe with excellant taste. I did add 1/4 cup of sugar in with the strawberry jello mixed to combine all then poured into the crust. Thank you for the recipe!

The recipe was easy to make, but could use a little more sugar.  Also, I would prefer a flakier crust.  I think it would be really good with maybe 1/4 to 1/3 c. sugar added with the jello.

For those that have pastry anxiety like myself, this is GREAT!!!  The pastry portion is just pressed into the pie plate.  Used slightly less sugar as I prefer it that way. And a cup more rhubarb.

This was good.  The crust is very much like shortbread rather than traditional pie crust, but that's OK.  I used raspberry jello instead of strawberry because that's what I had on hand.  It was a bit overwhelming, but overall we did enjoy this.

This recipe is great! What a suprise.
I made it to take to a get together and everyone loved it. I found that I could change the Jell-o flavor and add some brown sugar to topping for a different twist!

The crust is a little hard, but the filling is wonderful!  I'm going to try using a regular pie crust next time.

Just way too sweet---use 1/2 cup of sugar for topping instead of 1 cup.  I would add a little vanilla to the bottom crust too.

For Billsslave;  I believe the recipe you are looking for is this: 
1 lb. rhubarb, cut in 1/4 " pieces (3-4 cups),
1 c. white sugar,  1 (3oz package) strawberry jello,
1 package yellow or white cake mix,   1c. water,  1/4 c. melted butter
Layer all the ingredients in order; do not stir! Bake at 350 for 45 min or until rhubarb is tender

Won't make again.
Not as good as other rhubarb crisps. Crust tasted salty. I did add just half the sugar and twice the rhubarb, but it was still too  sweet for my taste. I just didn't like the fake taste of the jello.

Agree with comments about crust, the recipe basically makes a shortcake crust (much like biscuit mix).  That may be healthier than a normal crust though.  Jello is a neat idea and it really works - this is GREAT for me, because the garden has a ton of rhubarb but can't seem to grow strawberries :-p  Crumb topping is very nice, I found myself stealing it off other pieces of pie!

My mom was had a recipe like this and lost it.  So when we found this one we wre surprised.  She did not think anybody had one.  She made it for a banquet and it was a hit. I think it is a great recipe. I like adding the jello rather than the berries.

I received a similar recipe years ago from a lady in a nursing home but lost it during a move.  Hers was even easier to make.  It incorporated a white cake mix.  Does anyone know how to modify this recipe to accomodate that change?

Whomever posted this recipe, thank you:)  It comes close to what I am seeking.  No doubt yours is just as YUMMY!
