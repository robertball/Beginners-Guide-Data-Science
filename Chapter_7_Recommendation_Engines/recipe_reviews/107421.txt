This recipe tasted pretty good and was easy to make ... however it was no where near as good as the other rave reviews suggested.  I don't think I'll be making it again, but if I do I would probably omit the honey and paprika.  The honey added a nice flavor but it wound up being too sweet and the paprika really didn't add anything that the other spices hadn't already given to the recipe.  Actual cooking time was also wound up being much less than recommended.  I might also consider adding the vegetables half way through the cooking process because they wound up being rather overcooked.

This was a great recipe! I made a few minor changes (I am not a fan of cooked peppers, which I think lose all their crunch and flavour in this sort of dish. Also I added some parsnips, which are kind of sweet, some small purple onions instead of the onions called for, and used two whole lemons, squeezed, then sliced about 6 squeezed slices into the dish). Anyway, it tasted great, and we are putting on our A-list of dishes to serve even for the most demanding company.

This has a lot of flavor. Very nice.  I cut the honey in half and added more olive oil. After squeezing the juice from the lemons, I cut them in quarters, tossed them in the paste along with a small sweet red onion and stuffed the cavity of both hens. I'm not a zucchini, squash or turnip fam, so I used small white potatoes, yellow onion, mushrooms, and red peppers tossed with seasoning. I added the vegetables half way through the cooking process, as another reviewer suggested. I also substituted  a 28oz can of Rotel with chilils.

I made this for Easter dinner - very flavorful and delicious.  Makes a TON of vegetables as written - we had leftovers for days, but they were very good so it was fine.  I used turnips and cut them in 1/4 inch slices, since they're only 2" in diameter to begin with - I wonder if the cook meant parsnips?  I served this with couscous, but it didn't soak up the juice like I'd want.  I think it would be better paired with something bland - mashed potatoes?  I also served with steamed spinach - delicious!

Made this for monthly dinner party. My theme was India. Never cooked Indian before was kinda scared. My friends were a bit afraid at first? We all loved it! In roaster even pepper stayed crunchy! Only change from recipe was (accidental cuz apparently I cant read) I used a lot of curry. My cumin ran out and I grabbed the wrong bottle. Still turned out perfect! Everyone wants this again! Thank you!!!!!!

This is a very wonderful, flavorful recipe! As with any recipe that calls for spices, the fresher your spices the more flavor! This is especially important with this recipe as it utilizes many wonderful spices. If your spices are stale they will have very little flavor. The hens came out perfectly juicy with meat falling off the bone. I took the lid of the last 15 minutes and the skin was nice and crispy. Will definitely be making this again.
