This is my  number one choice for cheesecake!  I had a recipe before I made this one, but lost it.  Here is my suggestion:  I do make mine with the 1/2 cup sugar and 2 pkg cream cheese- everyone is saying it doesn't fit in the pie plate.... well!!!! My recipe I had you made it in a little square 9x9 dish!!!!!!! It is so perfect.  The crust I use is what makes the recipe absolutely delicious- 1c flour 1c sugar 1/2 c chopped walnuts 1 stick of butter, you just bake that for about 10 minutes.  It is way better than graham cracker crust.

I liked this but my husband didn't.  Due to ingredients on-hand I made adjustments; used FF cream cheese 16 oz.; 4 oz. ff cool whip and 4 oz. low fat cool whip; 2-3 T lemon juice; 1 tsp. vanilla.

Excellent! I doubled the cream cheese and increased the sugar as advised from other reviews. The second time I made it I spread a thin layer hot fudge on the bottom of the crust before adding the filling.  The strawberries are a great addition too!

Perfect alternative to a traditional baked cheesecake!  It is SO EASY to make!!! Per the advice of other reviewers, I added 2 8 oz packages of cream cheese and increased the sugar to 1/2 Cup.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I used a ready-made chocolate crust rather than graham cracker and garnised the top with fresh halved strawberries. It looked pretty and tasted great! I brought this to a luncheon and it was a huge hit .... gone in 5 minutes ... I had many requests for the recipe!

The easiest, yummiest, no-bake cheesecake I've come across.  I've made this multiple times and always double the cream cheese (Philly brand every time), and increase the sugar.  I top the pie with sliced, fresh strawberries in a strawberry glaze (which I find in the produce department at the store). Truly awesome!

I give this 5 stars because it's a great base recipe!  The only change I made was that I used 2 lite Philidelphia cream cheeses and 1/2 cup sugar.  It made a little more than would go in the crust so I just put the leftover in a parfait cup with some of the cherry pie filling I put on top of the pie.  Make sure you don't use a mixer to fold in the cool whip, fold it in by hand.  Also, it is critical for the flavor for it to be chilled for the amount the recipe states.  The flavor is much better that way.  My husband said he liked this pie much better than a dense baked cheesecake.  I think I agree although I don't think I would pass up either!

I ate a piece of the cheesecake right after making before it had cooled for 4 hrs, and I didn’t think it was impressive. The next day however we ate some cold and it was delicious! I did add an extra package of cream cheese as suggested and ½ cup of sugar. It was really fluffy and held together great. I served some to my parents and they immediately said they wanted the recipe. Very good, I will make again, next time I will try low fat cream cheese though!

Great dessert, and very quick prep time. After reading other reviews, and because we don't eat as healthy as we should...lol, increased Cream Cheese to 2-8 oz packages (instead of 1), increased sugar to 1/2 cup, and added 1 tsp vanilla. Then added just a little more vanilla and sugar to suit our tastes. This is so much easier than baking a cheesecake, and really does have the cheesecake flavor, just not as heavy as far as the texture. Thanks Adora!

My husband was impressed. He loved it and commented on how smooth it was and he is a finicky eater. I think I should've used 2 pkgs of cream cheese b/c like one reviewer said, it barely fills the 9" crust. Or maybe use an 8" crust. Nevertheless, I will make this again and again!

For those of you that aren't crazy for the traditional heavy kind of cheesecake ... you will love this.  Nice and light texture and great taste.  I even added 2 tbsps of Frangelico (hazlenut liquor) when folding it all in, tasted yummy!!  But like Adora says you can use any topping as well or real fruit on top.  I've made this now 4 times and it never gets tiring!

Great recipe ... I added some lemon zest to it and a few squeezes of lemon juice.  I actually made this a layered "cheesecake" or "pie."  On top of the graham cracker crust, I put a layer of prepared lemon pudding (the quick mix kind where you just add milk and mix). After pouring the pudding into the crust, I let that set up for about 20 min in the freezer, then added the cheesecake recipe as shown on here(with the lemon zest and juice added) as another layer.  Then, I added half a can of blueberry pie filling spread on top not quite to the edge (we love lemon and blueberry together in a dish).  It turned out fabulous!

WOW! Amazing! I served it frozen - I made this for my guests and it was a big hit for the adults and the kids! I made some modifications - I used "Cookie Dough for Ice Cream (Eggless)" from this site as the base in a 9x13 pan. I kept the cheese cake non-dairy, so I used toffuti cream cheese instead of regular c.c., and used a 16 ox. container of non-dairy whipping cream. I used confectioners sugar instead of the regular sugar called for in the recipe. I followed the recipe's directions, and then added in some chocolate chips and little cookie dough balls to the mix. I placed it in the pan, topped with more chocolate chips and cookie dough and drizzled it with chocolate and served it frozen - It did not have to thaw out before serving. I have also made this recipe into a peanut butter cheese cake - by adding 3/4 cup of peanut butter to the recipe - always a hit!

amazingly easy!!! i give it 5 stars just for that. It turned out extremely delicious. I had my doubts because i have never attempted a cheesecake but this came out awesome. I used 2 containers of cream cheese and some vanilla flavoring. My fiance loved it (and he's a big cheesecake fan) So easy to make and so delicious. The texture is awesome. Filling but not heavy. Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe was a snap to make.  You definitely want to double the cream cheese, however, as the given amount barely fills a 9-inch pie plate.  Brand name cream cheeses, I've found, are best with this.  I've made this again and again for parties, for special gatherings and holidays, and no matter how I make it (with fruit topping or without, even a "chocolate" version), it gets *devoured*.  Thanks for the recipe, this is a keeper!

If you are looking for a traditional cheesecake recipe, look elsewhere. However, if you just want a yummy cream cheesy dessert, this is great! Very simple, very tasty. Many reviews criticize it for not tasting like a traditional cheesecake, but that's kind of confusing since it never claimed to be traditional. It's great with all sorts of toppings, but it great plain, too.  I didn't make any changes, and the only complaint is that to completely fill a 9-inch pie crust, you have to make about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 times the filling.  I would definitely recommend this recipe, and will make it again.

What an amazing tasting, easy to make dessert.  It is such a perfect summer treat.  Top it with fresh strawberries, it tastes fabulous.  It only took me 10-15 minutes to make it.  Two thumbs up!  I did follow other's reviews and used 2 cream cheese and half cup sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used a 10 inch ready crust.  It filled it perfectly.

This recipe is simple enough, however I did find that the measurements were a bit off.  It says an “8 oz” container of frozen whipped topping = about 1 cup. Definitely not enough. I used a whole container of Cool Whip which = about 4 cups. I did add another 4 oz of cream cheese but kept the sugar the same.  Also the original recipe says to put the mixture into a 9” graham crust . The Keebler crust that I bought said 6” and even using the whole tub of Cool Whip and adding the extra cream cheese it was JUST enough to fill the 6” crust. Otherwise, with these measurement adjustments the flavor was GREAT. My husband normally does not enjoy cheesecake and begged me to make another one just for him! Haha.

I've been making this cheese cake for at least the last 8 years... It's the only one that I use. I sometimes top mine with fresh fruit or chocolate sauce for a lil twist.

For the diabetic in my family, I used sugar free Cool Whip, lite cream cheese & sugar free cherry pie filling for the topping. I put a few drops of red food coloring in the Cool Whip mixture - excellent Valentine's dessert!!

Very good and easy recipe. I also used 2 pkgs of cream cheese, added vanilla and a dash of lemon juice and topped with strawberries. Husband thought it was fantastic!

Ok recipe,  not an authentic cheesecake but a great creamy pie.  Subbed regular whipped cream for vanilla flavored based on personal tastes,  Also added about 2 cups extra creamy whipped cream as i let the vanilla thaw a little too much, let the cream cheese soften alot first, no lumps :)

This recipe was pretty good, primarily because it's so easy to make. It wasn't cheesy enough for my families liking. I would use 2 packs of cream cheese next time, as the other reviewers suggested. However it is just as well to make a baked cheesecake. If you're going to spend money on expensive ingredients it's better to make something luscious out of them!

This was great!  I used 2 of the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and half the whipped cream so I could taste more of the cream cheese flavor.  It is excellent!  Great texture.  Perfect plain or with fruitchocolate topping.

I really liked this cheesecake it was lighter than regular cheesecakes and easier to make. I followed the recipe using the 1 package and it was alright in an 8" crust. I would add a little bit of vanilla next time and refrigerate for more then 4 hours, I would say overnight.

I was looking for an easy recipe to make for the holidays.  I came across this, and thought I'd give it a try.  I did use a second package of cream cheese, and added just a little bit more sugar.  I had my boyfriend help me, since he is such a cheesecake lover, and it was so easy!  And the best part of all?  He didn't even notice, HE made the whole thing!!

This recipe rocked!!! It is fast, easy, and delicious. I read that some others doubled the cream cheese amt (to 2 8 oz. pkgs), so I did that. I would highly recommend doing that to others, and I also added a pinch more of sugar (since I was doubling the cream cheese). Also, be sure to let it gel (I left it overnight), or it won't take the "cheesecake" form. Hubby is a cheesecake lover, and could not keep his hands out of this recipe! Kudos!!! I will be making this more often for sure!

I made my own graham cracker crust and a blueberry topping for the top of the pie. This lasted two days--the boys inhaled it. Next time, I would add some vanilla flavoring and make a strawberry topping instead. Good pantry dessert.

I love cheesecake, but this one didn't please me at all. It just didn't have enough cream cheese flavour for me. It tasted a lot like eating a more solidified version of Cool Whip with an almost unnoticeable tang from the cream cheese. The only way I'd make this again is by experimenting with using a lesser amount of Cool Whip to the cream cheese ratio. Thanks for the idea.

Really good. I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat graham cracker crust and fat free cool whip, and then I topped it with hot fudge and chopped walnuts. I will definately make this again and experiment with different toppings.

This is 5 stars IF you take other people's suggestions and double the cream cheese and use 1/2 c of sugar. I used a shortbread crust. And it's fabulous.

I make this recipe every year at the holidays and it's always a hit. But like some others have said, I always use 2 packages of cream cheese and 1/2 cups of sugar. I put this out with several toppings in cute dishes,and it's great!

Absolutely fantastic quick-and-easy dessert -- with one caveat. I made up a batch with low-fat ingredients, and it just didn't firm up.  For the family, this is fine, just enjoy it as a pudding on the pie crust. For guests or potlucks though, use full fat ingredients for maximum POW! Also, a teaspoon of vaniola really helps this taste like a whole recipe.  Fresh fruit is the last step to making this dessert look like you worked on it all day.

Add the sugar S-L-O-W-l-Y so that it doesn't lump up the mixture.  And, make sure your cream cheese is very soft.  I dump a can of pie filling over my pies before I chill them.  Delicious with blueberry and blackberry.  Good with cherry, too.  Fresh fruit on top is an option too, and I'm going to try it when it gets a little cheaper this season!

My husband is a cheesecake fanatic, and also a cool-whip fanatic, so this really rocked his world! 
I added vanilla, and used 1.5 packages of cream cheese. I also used about 3/4 tub of cool whip, so it was a little thicker. Delicious!

This was very basic but very good. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and about 1 1/2 tsp. lemon juice. I used it as a dip to accompany graham crackers, shortbread cookies, and strawberries. I formed it into a heart shape and poured strawberry puree over the top. Very pretty and yummy!

Fantastic! I've made this twice in the past week. My family loves it. I used 2 packages of cream cheese and half the recommended whipped topping. I also used a squeeze of lime juice. This is lighter than regular cheesecake, just perfect for a hot summer day!

I'd like to give this 4.5 stars because this doesn't have the texture of cheesecake, but the taste is close! I did the calorie-counter version: a combo of fat free and reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat whipped topping, and Equal instead of sugar. I would have tried completely no fat but I was making it as a quick dessert for company, and I didn't want to risk a complete failure of a recipe! I put it in the fridge overnight, but it was still a little soft. Perhaps the full fat version sets up better. I also threw some Heath crunchies on top. Anyway, my guests really liked it. I don't think they knew how easy it was to make!

This definitely was easy. I did use 2 pkgs of cream cheese and 1/2 c of sugar. Of course, it doesn't have the same texture that a baked one has. I made a homemade graham cracker crust with crushed almonds and it was good. My husband wanted cheesecake for Easter and this recipe allowed me to fulfill that wish! (And still have the time to prepare the rest of the meal.) We were thinking it would be good frozen and topped with chocolate syrup.:)

This cheesecake has a spongey texture.  Not our cup of tea at all.

I didn't know this was so easy to make and comes out so delicious! I used 2 packages cream cheese though and the taste was awesome! Even my mom who is a cook praised it. Gonna make more soon! :)

This is quite good but I think it loses something compared to regular cheesecake. I prefer the Nutella no bake pie for intensity of flavor. This is pretty good though and surely was easy. Maybe a topping or something would make it more fun or intense? I think that regular cheesecake browns just a bit in the oven and I miss that flavor.

Fantastic. This is so super quick, and easy. I did, as a few others did, and doubled the cream cheese and increased the sugar. (I used bakers auger) I made home made whip cream, and added it in as per recipe. Yummmmm we are living it.

Excellent!!!  I used confectioners  sugar to avoid  the  grittiness of regular sugar.  I used enough  for  my  taste , about 1/2 cup.  Added t tsp. Vanilla at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Froze 30 minutes before cutting.  Set up beautifully.  Also put this in a homemade graham  cracker crust.  Easy and much better  than store bought.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't add the whipped cream this time. Next time, I am going to. It was a little gritty and I think that the whipped cream would  take away the grittiness.

So good!  I actually followed the recipe except for adding frozen berries.  I blended frozen berries, the 1 pkg of cream cheese, about half cup of greek yogurt, and a splash of rice milk.  Then I froze it.  It's perfect!  I'm going to try using peanut butter next time and see how that goes.  Thank you for the recipe!

seems to be good, waiting to try it after refrigerating it... though i did regret doubling the sugar as suggested, a bit too sweet. one star knocked off because the cream cheese is very difficult to beat without water and with water it is a bit too watery. UPDATE: I had the cheesecake i made for dessert and it is absolutely great! My sister said that it taste like her birthday cake we got her earlier this year from a nearby bakery! Downside: it is too sweet especially if you have diabetic parents and it is hereditary. So I am going to cut the sugar by 1/3 next time. Also, no more sugar in the crust! Btw, I am a first time baker, so this recipe is definitely one for first-timers ! :-)

I made this last night and my family loved it. Changes: 2 pkgs of cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tbsp vanilla as suggested by other reviewers.  Didn't have to heat up my kitchen which is a plus in the summertime!

Other cheesecakes I've made call for lemon, so I added a packet of True Lemon and a small amount of vanilla.  Taste is amazing and so easy! Next time I'll try the 2 pkgs of cream cheese.

AWESOME!  I loved this cheese cake! I topped it with a blueberry sauce by Isybel (on Allrecipes).  Not only was it extremely easy to make, but it looked and tasted great, too!  I used 1/2 cup of sugar, 2 blocks of cream cheese, the whole container of cool whip, and 1/2 of a small lemon.  I will definitely make this again and pass it on to friends and family!

This was terrific!  I took it to a cookout and it was gone within 10 minutes of putting it out. I made this with a cookie crust and added chocolate chip cookie dough pieces throughout.  Also, like many others I used 2 packages of cream cheese and increased the sugar to 1/2 C.  The I doubled the recipe.

We are very happy with this recipe.  Since other reviewers stated that this makes more than needed to fill a 9" pan I tried using 3 8 oz. packages of cream cheese, scant 2/3 cup of sugar and 1 plus a 1/2  8 oz. container of whipped topping.  Fit perfectly in 3 8" graham cracker crusts! Yummy!!

This is the best recipe!!  We had friends over and I made individual pies with the already-made, individual crusts.  I used different fruit toppings so everyone could pick!  They were a big hit.  My only suggestion is to put the toppings on right befroe serving!  The cheesecake gets soggy if you put it on to far in advance.

This is a really tasty dessert.  My husband does not really like "cheesy" cheesecake and I certainly prefer the NO BAKE.  This is the perfect blend!!  We usually add a little vanilla.  Can also be done with light cream cheese and light whipped topping. UPDATE::  I made this today and used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light whipped cream.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and put into a reduced fat graham cracker crust.  You would never know the difference.  I put all ingredients in my stand mixer and whip it all up.  I see no need for a second cream cheese. I also set out various toppings for our guests. Chocolate chips, strawberries, chocolate and caramel sauce and some pecans so they could dress their own cheesecake!!

I have made this many times, but have always reduced the sugar to 1/4 c. because it gives more cheesecake taste without so much sweet; a couple less calories too.  I have made this (usually) with low fat cream cheese and light Cool Whip and no one was the wiser.  They ate the whole thing!  Most of the time, I also top this with Cherry Pie Filling, dipping the cherries out almost one at a time and disposing of the extra red filling.  The extra filling makes it too messy and it's not really needed anyway.  My family and friends prefer this recipe over regular cheesecake because it's lighter.

Before I read the reviews I got only one package of cream cheese but I added vanilla anyways, and made a graham cracker crust along with it and its very light, not a cheesecake texture but it taste amhmazing and did have a cheesecake taste. Next time I will use two things of cream cheese. It was really good still. I added strawberry's on top and I'm in love with this cheesecake. Thanks!!!!!!

It took me less than 2 days to eat the entire pie by myself and I can't wait for the next occasion (I mean excuse)to make this simple yet so delicious not-your-traditional cheesecake!  If you love the flavor of cheesecake but think it's just a bit too rich... try this recipe for a light yet very satisfying treat.

A decent pie, but it didn't have as much cream cheese flavor as I wanted.  After reading some other reviewer's experiences with low- or non-fat ingredients, I went with low-fat (neufchatel) cream cheese and full fat whipped topping and the pie firmed up fine.  The recipe itself is very good and VERY easy, but it is disappointing if you're expecting it to be exactly like a normal cheesecake.  However, I think topped with some fruit (fresh strawberries, kiwi, bananas), this could become a fantastic summer treat!

I live in Britain and have never heard of frozen whipped topping, so I decided to substitute it with cream. Unfortunately I managed to use single cream and the whole thing absolutely refused to set. So we ate it frozen! Delicious! The only tricky thing was to manage to chop a piece off!

I made this and took it to a potluck, and there wasn't any left for me! I had to make a second. It was just excellent. I don't like the texture of baked cheesecakes, this was perfect!

This recipe wasn't too bad - I used a lot of the substitutions others had offered.  However, this just wasn't cheesy enough for us either, even using two cream cheese instead of one.  Mine still had more of a Cool Whip flavor to it.  It did have a great taste and was a good dessert, but not the cheesecake flavor we were looking for.

As recommended, I used two 8 ounce cream cheese and increased the sugar.  The cheesecake was very good served with fresh strawberries.

This was the easiest cheescake I ever made!  It is very light and creamy.  Next time I am going to try making it with more cream cheese for a little more flavor.

Yes, this is a great overall rating... but to serve it at a party it wasn't so impressive.  In fact it tastes more like whip topping instead of cream cheese.  Maybe try it with actual homemade whipped cream to create a classy taste for guests.

This was easy & awesome tasting...even though I could only find 6 inch size crusts. It was very impressive when I divided the cheescake down the middle & across in 4 sections and alternated bluberry topping & cherry topping! I made 2 of these back to back & gave one to a friend. Will make again & again.
