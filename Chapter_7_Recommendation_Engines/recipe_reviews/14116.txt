The brand of creamed corn will make a huge difference in the result of any scalloped corn recipe. I always use Del Monte and always have great success with a nice creamy consistency, good flavor and no watery separation.

This is my fav version of scalloped corn.  I added an additional can of corn to the recipe and about 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of heavy cream to keep it really moist and creamy.  It was excellet.  So many holiday memories are in this dish.

I was anticipating a nice creamy scalloped corn casserole, but what I ended up with, unfortunately, was a watery casserole.  I cooked this for an additional 25 minutes hoping that the liquid would cook down, but it didn't.  Basically, I don't think this tasted much different than if I'd just heated all ingredients in a saucepan on top of the stove and then sprinkled with the crackers before serving.  I followed this recipe to the letter, but I would definitely make some changes  if I were to make again.  First, I'd increase the oven temperature to 375 or even 400.  Then I'd cut the butter and oil in half (you really don't need a 1/4 cup of fat to saute the small amount of  veggies).  Also, from a presentation point of view, a little bit of butter on top of the crumbs would brown them and make the casserole more eye appealing.  And a little bit of salt and pepper wouldn't hurt either.  This simply  didn't measure up to what I consider scalloped corn.  Kitkaty, sorry for the harsh review, but this just didn't work for us.

I don't like 'conventional' scalloped corn. Your recipe was exactly what I was looking for! The only thing I did differently was adding some cajun seasoning...but, only because it went with the rest of the meal I was preparing...it turned out great!! Thanks!

This was a great change from the traditional scalloped corn I've had. I had to change this recipe a bit as I was out of egg, so I omitted the egg, added 2 Tbsp. sour cream and added a extra 1/4 cup cheese. I also added garlic cloves to the celery,onion & green peppers. Everyone loved it!

This is just what I have been looking for, my mother makes something similar, she just adds a little salt and pepper.  Very good.

My family did not like this. It was not creamy at all and did not have much flavor. Not pleasing to the eye.

The recipe was far too watery when prepared as written. And yes, I did drain the corn. I did, however, use a store brand of canned corn and perhaps that made a difference.  The corn dish wasn't nearly ready to present for the original meal it was planned for, so after cooking it the first 30 minutes, I cooled it, then refrigerated it until the next day. I then mixed in two additional eggs to provide more thickening, and cooked that for 30 more minutes at 375 degrees.  It still didn't look done, so I increased the temperature to 400 degrees for 15 minutes, then added a buttered cornflake topping (I didn't have the cracker rounds on hand) and returned to the oven at 400 degrees for ten minutes. The result was acceptable, though not the best scalloped corn I've tasted. I might try this recipe one more time with a national brand corn before looking for a different recipe.

Made this as a Thanksgiving side dish.  It was ok. Most of my guests liked it. My only complaint is as others have said, it was too watery. I strained my whole kernel corn first before using it, so I don't quite understand why it turned out like that.  I used a spoon before serving  to get alot of the excess liquid out, however, my husband said it was good but needed to be less watery.  I going to analyze the recipe and try and figure out what causes this excess liquid. Not sure if I will make it again.

Taste is great,when complimented by proper entree.   Not really what I  would use for thanksgiving. 

FYI:  I think many of the complaints about it being runny are from those who don't drain the whole kernel corn.
