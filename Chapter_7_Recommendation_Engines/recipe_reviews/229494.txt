So easy!! This lighter, sweet/tangy treat feels like cheating... Feels like I spent way more time preparing it AND that I'm breaking my diet eating it!! Didn't have soy milk, but skim worked fine, and wish I checked how many apples I had (only 3 large) before I started, but all in all, a GREAT pre-holiday treat!! Mmmmm!!

A good plant-based diet recipe, but I felt it needed more sweetening.  We enjoyed it with some low fat ice cream, but my husband wanted more sweetening so he dribbled some Agave on his cobbler the second time around.  Trying to make low sugar and low fat dessert recipes is a challenge!  When I try this again I will probably add a Tablespoon or two of Agave or brown sugar to the apples and cranberries, and perhaps a little more brown sugar to the topping so it is not quite as guilt-free.  This is especially needed if you skip ice cream on top...as we usually do.  The topping was in clumps, but that was okay, more like a crisp than a cobbler.  Thanks for the recipe!

I haven’t made this, but I’m Leary about making this with oats since Glyphosate (main active ingredient) has been found in Quaker brand oats.. and soy isn’t that healthy for u either.. need to find alternative ingredients.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I cut the recipe in half, used all Granny Smith apples, and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar.  In an effort to make it even healthier, I used applesauce in place of the butter for the topping, and used whole wheat pastry flour.  It did change the texture of the of the topping a little, but it still turned out great!  I served it with some soy vanilla ice cream so it would be vegan friendly, and we loved it.
