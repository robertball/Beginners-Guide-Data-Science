I love this recipe!  I first made it for Christmas, but it's so good I make it all the time now. The only thing I do different is to use frozen veggies rather than canned.  Better flavour in my opinion!

Delicious, used black beans instead of kidney.  Half cup miracle whip, half cup olive oil hellmann's.  Yummy:)

I was expecting not to like this, but wanted to make it for the festive colors.  It is actually very good and my family members liked it.  I must admit that I had radishes in my hand at the grocery store, but they must have ended up in another shopper's cart (hope they like radishes!) because they weren't rung up on my receipt or in my vegetable bin when I went to make this yesterday morning.  So, I added some halved grape tomatoes just before serving to give the salad some extra red.  I do want to make this again, but actually use radishes.  Also, I only got to make this about 6 hours ahead of our Christmas dinner, but it was still great.  Overnight isn't necessarily necessary.

I tried this because I got radishes and have never used radishes in a dish. It turned out really good. I did not have regular corn on hand I had creamed corn so it made it really creamy and I used about half the dressing to make it low fat. It turned out pretty good. I don't know that i would recommend using creamed corn because it turned out more soupy after I added the dressing but it is pretty yummy, especially after leaving it overnight for the flavors to mix.

I used frozen corn and peas, I used miracle whip and Hellman's olive oil dressing. I also used a club house veggie seasoning in the mayo dressing. I originally let it sit for 6 hours. But the next day it was delicious.

I liked, not loved, it but no one else in my family did. I was the only dish still full at the end of dinner. I ate it as a in-between meals meal but ended up throwing over half of it away. Will not be making it again.
