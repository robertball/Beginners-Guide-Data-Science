This turned out alright, but there is another recipe I like better that uses cocoa powder.  I thought it had too much sugar, so I didn't pack the brown sugar, and it was still a bit too sweet for me. Overall, it was chocolatey and chewy, which is good. I microwaved for 60 seconds, and it was perfectly cooked. *Update-eat this right away. I only had half of it and then had to do something that came up, and when I got back to this it had gotten hard. ...I still ate it, because I'm not going to waste anything chocolate...

I've made this many times in a small, round corning ware dish and it turns out great.  I use a small whole egg, I didn't pack the brown sugar and I cook it 45 seconds based on my microwave.  It's best not to over cook it and eat it while it's still warm.  The top seems to still be wet and makes a sort of icing.  If you cut into it, the middle should be done even though the top looks wet.  I bake a lot so I have a variety of chocolate chips on hand.  I used 2 heaping tablespoons of milk chocolate chips and 1 heaping tablespoon of a mix of dark chocolate and semi-sweet.  This is a quick solution for a sudden sweet tooth or chocolate craving! Makes 1 large serving or enough for 2 to share.

Great! Perfect for a quick craving. Added a little almond milk, less brown sugar, and used Nutella instead of chocolate chips. Half the amount of brown sugar called for would be plenty!

I like the recipe, but this needs to be cooked at least 1:15 for it to be cooked all the way through. Careful though, if you do the whole time at once it may over flow

I loved it!  I didn’t alter the recipe and I thought that it tasted amazing. It was late at night and I wanted a mug cake. I looked at a lot of other recipes before I found this one but I didn’t do any off those because they needed ingredients that I didn’t have. I was very satisfied with the outcome! I will definitely make this again!

I used cocoa powder in place of chocolate chips and added hershey’s chocolate sauce over the top afterward, but otherwise I didn’t change a thing! Tasted great and was easy to make.

This is the 3rd coffee mug brownie I've made and I find one thing in common with all of them. Since the sugar doesn't have time to dissolve, they all taste very sandy and gritty -- not something I enjoy. I will experiment on my own and maybe use different types of sweetener to come up with a better recipe.
