My family really enjoyed this meal.  I did a bit different, though.  I cooked the ground beef with a teaspoon of minced garlic and about a 1/3 of cup of onions.  I, also, added the chili powder and cumin as suggested by others.  I went a little further and added a can of chopped green chilies and replaced the tomatoes with 24 oz. of salsa.  I used rotini, bacause I didn't have and macaroni noodles.  After it was done I topped it with crushed tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream, olives, and taco sauce.  Then I added chopped cilantro as a final garnish.  It was delicious and dissappeared quickly.  Thanks for the great recipe. We will make this one a lot.

I make a very similar dish- except I use a 16 oz jar of salsa instead of the canned tomatoes and serve it wrapped burrito-style in tortillas with the cheese and sour cream, instead of over pasta.  It's fast and very tasty.

This is a great recipe especially with tomatoes fresh from the garden.  I found that the beans should be drained.  A little extra garlic powder and some chile powder really added a lot of zip.

Thanks to all the other reviewers for their great suggestions on improving this dish. I am not sure how I would have rated it had I done it as written. I added garlic and onion to the meat while frying and also added extra spices with everything else....a generous helping of chili powder helped the taste really stand out in this hearty casserole. I also cut way back on the pasta. Sour cream is a must to top.

this came out really disappointing for us.  I would not make it again.  we did use a different kind of noodles but I dont think it would make a difference.

We changed a bit as follows:  browned 2lbs ground beef with 1/2 cup of chopped onion.  Added the corn, 1 can black beans, 1 can rotel, and garlic powder.  We then used Mexican-style shredded cheese for more flavor.  Also, we reduced the pasta to 6 ounces.  It was great.  We ate it two nights in a row, then I took the rest to work for lunch.

This was a hit with my kids. I sometimes cook for our Wednesday nite get together at my daughter's home. I added 1 stalk celery chopped, 1/2 white onion chopped, 1 clove of garlic, minced, 1/2 cup of salsa, 1/4tsp celery salt,1/4tsp chili powder,just to give it a little more kick. Sour cream and cheddar cheese is a must.

The reviews make this a better recipe than the original. I wouldn't rate it quite this high except for versatility. Added chili powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, seasoned pepper and cumin. The basic recipe needed help! Also, I would not use quite as much pasta.

I left out the corn and added more ground beef and beans. I substitued maccaroni for broken natcho chips. I also used fresh tomatoes and a package of taco seasoning instead of the garlic........came out better than the first time when I followed the recipe exactly. Just some ideas for substitutions :)

This recipe wasn't bad.  This is the type of stuff I cook when I'm down to the bare essentials in my pantry and need to go grocery shopping.  It's the only time I would cook this.  I added a can of green chilies, cumin, and chilli powder.  Not my husband'S favorite type of meal, but he ate this and didn't complain.  I think it's a pretty good recipe.

This is a good basic recipe. I've made it several times and played with the seasonings. The best I've come up with yet is to add a packet of taco seasoning to replace the salt, pepper, and part of the garlic powder. Really good. With that change I'm upgrading this recipe from three to four stars.

I found this too bland and dry for our tastes. However if one adds a can of Hunt's Spicy spaghetti sauce and mixes everything up together it's very good!! I will make again using my way because it also freezes very well that way .

My husband loved it, so did I. I did added more ingredients to it, like the other comments had mention. I've added onions, green pepper, some cream cheese because I didn't have a lot of of cheddar cheese, minced garlic, cumin, & oregano.Instead of 16oz tomatoes, I only had 28oz diced tomatoes,also I used chili beans. I would make this again.

This was good for a quick easy meal, and tasted a lot like an old stand-by my mom used to make. I used Italian-style stewed tomatoes which added some extra flavor, I think.

This is a great starter recipe.  I appreciated the suggestions of reviewers.  Here's what I did: used a whole chopped onion and 2 large cloves of minced garlic which cooked while browning the meat; used drained great northern beans (that's what I had) along with the diced tomatoes and corn, sprinkled very generously with sea salt, pepper and chili powder, let that simmer for about 5 minutes, then added about 1/2 pound of cooked elbow macaroni.  Finally added 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar but no sour cream.  It made a lot so I don't have to cook tomorrow night.  This is fast and very tasty.  Thanks!!

Simply good.  I also did what every else did: I replaced the tomatoes with salsa, added some cumin and chili powder, and added teaspoon of garlic with the meat.

I keep making this so I must like it! It's a quick and easy dinner that everyone in the house enjoyed. I added half a chopped onion and a heaping teaspoon of chopped garlic to the browning hamburger in lieu of the garlic powder. I also used diced tomatoes with green chilies and a dash of chili powder for extra kick. I'm currently on a dairy-free diet and it tasted just fine without the cheese and sour cream. Enjoy!

This is a great after work or anytime recipe. It's a fun recipe to experiment with. I had leftover Mac & Cheese and added that, used a can of tomatoes and green chiles (drained a little), Onion to the beef and crushed tortilla chips with a dollop of sour cream. No leftovers here!

YUMEE!This recipe alone would have been pretty bland(kept tasting to see) so i added lots of chili powder and cumin, extra garlic powder too. I did not have plain diced tomatoes so i used a can of rotel with peppers and some picante sauce i had. I have picky eaters so i only used half the corn. This turned out soooo good. Its definitly a new favorite of ours!!! We also kept everything seperate and let everyone build there own. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very interesting dish. It looked unappealing to say the least, but when mixed together, it had a really good flavor. I almost didn't even taste it based on appearances alone, but both sons (14 & 24) gave me a thumbs up, and I agreed it was indeed pretty darn good. I think the sour cream added that special something to it. I followed this exactly as written. Next time I would add some onion powder and maybe even diced green chiles. I kept the macaroni, cheese, and sour cream separate, and we built the "haystacks" on our own plates, so the macaroni amounts were not an issue for us. (Update: even the leftovers got eaten, so it was a family "hit". I orginally gave this 3 stars, but had to upgrade it to 4 for so many reasons...) Definitely will make this again.

This is one of the EASIEST, and tastiest, meals I make. It's not exactly gourmet, but it can be put together quickly and makes the whole family happy!!! (I have also made it with chopped leftover ham in place of the hamburger.)

Great starting point, but I didn't see any "southwest" spices.  So out came 3 cloves of garlic, a chopped onion, 1/2 a handful of chili power, a teaspoon or so of cumin, 6 - 8 shakes of crushed red pepper, a pile of chopped up hot pepper rings and some left over fresh salsa.  Also drained the tomatoes.  That gave it some good spice! :-)

I found that the tomatoes should be drained as well as the beans in order for it to work well.

I've made these before reading it, but we usually use chips instead of the noodles. i also set everthing apart so ppl can build their own. it makes a great pot luck meal. u can easily make it vegetarian by subst. vegie burger crumbles with taco seasoning for the burger. chili beans r also good, mexi corn, salsa, green chilis. this is usually my go to meal when i'm runing low on staples, bc anything works really.

I would've given this recipe 4 1/2 stars, but gave 5 instead to up the rating on this yummy meal.  It was super easy, super quick, and tasty.  I added 1 onion to the meat.  Seasoned with worceshtire sauce, tabasco, chilli powder, cumin, and cayenne in addition to the already called for spices.  I then added 1/2 jar salsa to the mixture because I wanted it a bit more saucy.  I am not a kidney bean fan, but this was delicious.  The cheese and sour cream are a must - even for my husband who isn't big on either of them.  The whole family loved it, and we will definitely be making this again and again!

Excellent, easy recipe!  I left off the kidney beans and used stewed tomatoes rather than diced tomatoes, but everything turned out wonderfully!  I will definitely be making this again.

I made these as the recipe reads, and found it a touch bland. My kids LOVED it though. The second time I made them, I did make some changes, and with changes, I'd rate it much higher. My changes weren't that drastic, just a chopped onion, some Adobo and 3 cloves minced garlic cooked with the beef. Also a chopped green pepper added with the rest of the ingredients. Also, seasoned with salt and pepper as the recipe reads, but added crushed 1/4 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp mild chili powder, 1 tsp paprika. Was deee-lish!

Simple and tasty this is a great hit with the men in my familly! I add a bit of extra shredded cheddar to the meat and beans while they're heating. I'm a pasta lover but this is WAY TOO MUCH pasta... I cut it in half!

Quick  easy and tasty . This is the second time I've made it. The first time I added a can of rotel tomatoes and the second time I didn't , next time I won't forget the rotel. Sure made a difference in taste.  This recipe served 7 easily so it makes a lot and not a costly dish to prepare either.

I am on a increased fiber diet, and make this with the Barilla macaroni "plus" for added fiber, it is very tasty. I like that you can make it fast, and that it's easy. I think it's a lot better than regular American Chop Suey!

I found this to be rather bland.  My husband enjoyed it but I found it to be lacking something.  I tried to spice it up a bit but nothing seemed to hit the spot.  Interesting recipe, just not my style.

This recipe was great! I followed the directions except that I substituted a smaller can of corn. I also added a little extra cheese. The sour cream gave it a tangy flavor that my family loved. I will make this recipe again.

YUMMMY!!! This was a very good recipe. My son HATES casseroles. But, he thought this sounded great and ate it up! He doesn't like sour cream so I didn't add it. But I did add cummin, chili power, garlic powder, dried chili peppers, basil and some other spices, came out great! Thank you for the great recipe!

Recipe has a good beginning, but needs more.  There is nothing in it to flavor it.  I added a bunch of chili powder, but it still needed more seasonings.

The second time I made the recipe I tried it a little different.  Added the Onion and taco seasoning a little tomato sauce and instead of plain diced tomatos I used salsa for added ZIP.   then poured it over rice instead of pasta.   WAS AWESOME!!  Even better the second time around.

Family liked it, just as easy to layer it all in a dish, rather than make stacks.  Browned a chopped medium white onion along with the ground beef.  This is a recipe that just seemed to need onion.

An easy weeknight dish. The first time I made it I followed the instructions exactly as provided. I found it needed a bit more seasoning for us. Now I add whatever spice mix I might have on hand to the ground meat - a teaspoon or so of taco seasoning is our favorite.

Super Yummy - only did 8 oz of macaroni - 2 Roma tomatoes and added jar of LaVictoria Salsa and a small jar of diced free chili’s and added chili powder to the top once served in each bowl and then mixed it all up.  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.

This is a really good meal and easy to make. The original recipe is good, but I made a few changes the second time to add some spice to it. If you like spicier food, i recommend adding some cayenne pepper when cooking the beef. I also added jalapeños and nacho cheese on top when serving. It is amazing and one of our favorites.

Need some more depth. Added a splash of Worcestershire Sauce, a small can of tomato paste, a dash of taco seasoning and Emeril's Southwestern Spice blend (about 1 tsp). With the additions it was definitely worth doing again.

This recipe is soooo good! The only things I changed were for the diced tomatoes I used a can of rotel and I mixed it all together when done cooking and then added the cheese to melt it into the macaroni and meat mixture. The rotel gave a nice kick to it. I would definitely make this again!

Very tasty, easy meal-in-one dish recipe.  I added the sour cream to the mixture, instead of putting it on top.  This is an excellent variation on goulash.

Great recipe!  I did make a few adjustments - added chili powder as others suggested; added a few drops of lime juice with sour cream; and used mac-n-cheese instead of just macaroni.  My whole family gobbled it up!

This dish was okay.  Not one of my favorites.  I needed to add spaghetti sauce to add flavor.  Just a little to bland for us.  I will probably make it again and try other spices or something to give it a little kick.

I don't really know where to begin with this review.  I substituted Rotel for the diced tomatoes, black beans for the kidney beans, and then followed the recipe.  I read all of the reviews so I knew it was going to require more seasonings.  I just tasted as I went and ended up adding a package of taco seasoning then a package of fajita seasoning to get it to where it had any taste at all when eaten with pasta.  My son really liked my finished dish because his two most favorite foods are Mexican and pasta dishes.  As for my husband and I, well, we ate it.  We bagged the leftovers into individual portions and wrote 'Kid Food' on it to freeze for my son when I fix something for dinner that I know he will not eat.

I give the original recipe 3 stars because of the lack of seasonings. The dish was bland, so I took the advice of the other reviews and added some dried onion flakes, chili pepper, cumin, 2 med onions, 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of 1 and marjoram. When doctored I give it 4 stars.

Very practical recipe for a family...I, too, added some other spices like garlic pepper, some chilli pepper, paprika, and taco sauce.  I also made it as a casserole and it was very easy to serve and then store for leftovers.  Great for having a one and two year old at home...Thanks for the recipe!

I made this once before and found it to be good but a little bland, so the next time I added taco seasoning to the beef mixture along with some chopped bell pepper-what a difference, it was so good. Even my very, very picky husband loved it! thanks so much!

Our family has tried the recipe with and without the sour cream, since our 2 boys "think" they don't like sour cream. Using sour cream tasted best, and the kids didn't mind the sour cream since I didn't let them watch me cook with it!

Usually my daughter hates foods that are mixed up but she loved this recipe. Next time I would use a smaller portion of pasta and a larger portion of the beans.  I also added onions and garlic when I cooked the meat.

This recipe is easily modified to suit your mood or tastes.  Following the other reviewers' suggestions, I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the spices the recipe calls for.  I also added onion and some chopped red pepper to the meat while browning.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and a can of black beans, drained and rinsed, instead of the red.  I thought it could use some color, so I then added some chopped green pepper I had in my freezer.  Finally, I served it over white rice instead of macaroni.  My husband wrapped his in a tortilla and ate it that way.  Overall this is a great, versatile recipe.  Thanks, Katrina!

Thought this recipes needed a bit of zip for a "southwestern" dish. I used Rotele tomatoes (w/ peppers)plus the diced tomatoes (which I blended); added onions and bell peppers, and a package of Taco seasoning. I didn't have the sour cream so I omited it.  It then turned out to be a really good dish.
