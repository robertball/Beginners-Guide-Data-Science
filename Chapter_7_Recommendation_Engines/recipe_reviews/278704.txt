I used store bought cookie butter. I think it will turn out really good since I tasted the mixture before refrigerating it and I really liked it. Will wait 24 hours to cut into it.

Oh my, this is rich and delish!  I had never heard of  "cookie butter" before seeing this recipe!  I Love the Biscoff cookies so I knew this would be a hit! And it is!   The only change I made was I didn't use the whole package of cookies for the crust. I don't like a ton of crust even though it is delicious, I don't think it's necessary. I didn't freeze it for two hours either.  I popped it in the freezer but took it out and put the filling in when I was done making it.  Otherwise, I made it as written.  Highly recommend!
