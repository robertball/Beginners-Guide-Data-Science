Darned delicious stuff.  I made two loaves and took them to a church potluck... not one piece left.  The rolling out the dough is a real pain so I ended up smooshing it into a rectangle instead,  I wasn't able to find mortadella in my regular store so I just used some cooked Italian sausage.  I also cooked the tomatoes and mushrooms to  extract some of the water so I wouldnt have a mushy roll.  I baked this the night before and then the next morning, sliced it up and then heated in the oven, Worked great
