Made a few adjustments and this lasagna turned out quite well: 1.  added 3 more cloves of garlic to roasted veggies and instead of brushing everything on, I bagged mushrooms and eggplant together and zucchini with red pepper, then I poured in some olive oil and the minced garlic into each and mixed it all together and let it sit for several minutes.  I then poured the two out into separate pans and baked as directed. 2.  used 1 real egg instead of egg substitute (didn't have any around) 3.  used regular dry lasagna and cooked it until it was almost done so it could cook the rest of the way in the oven 4.  had to use more than 26 oz of tomato sauce - it was more in the range of 30-32 5.  added more veggies to give it more substance - almost doubled it 6.  used whole wheat lasagna to make up for the lack of meat

Excellent!

The vegetables go together very well.

A couple of tips: be sure to cut the vegetables 1/4 inch thick, or thicker to make sure they don't burn when baking.

Next time I'll add some more mushrooms, and maybe some spinach.

It was unanimous...the whole family loved this recipe.  I've made veggie lasagna in the past but always struggled with crunchy veggies...which I didn't like.  I never thought of roasting them first.  It made all the difference.  I did make a few changes however.  Instead of all ricotta cheese, I used half ricotta and half 1% cottage cheese and used an egg white instead of a whole egg.  Then I added a combination parmesan and romano plus some parsley to the cheese.  I used whole wheat lasagna which I pre-boiled.  I noted here that everyone said there wasn't enough sauce.  So what I did was saut√© a large onion, 3 cloves of garlic and the mushrooms in 1 tsp olive oil in a sauce pan then added on jar of pasta sauce and one can of diced seasoned tomatoes and let it simmer for a good 1/2 hour.  There was just enough sauce for the lasagna.  It was really good and I'll certainly be making it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was really great.  Just one note, I would toss the chopped vegetables with oil and garlic instead of spreading them out and brushing them.

My husband and I made this for Valentine's Day and we loved it so much! It is a light, healthier version of lasagna that is so flavorful! We didn't have eggplant but I roasted zucchini and bell pepper in a pan and then added the mushrooms later (rather than using two pans). We also put fresh chopped spinach in the ricotta. If you're a roasted veggie lover, you have to try this recipe!

My family prefers meat lasagna but we were going on a trip with some vegetarians so I made two batches of lasagna, one with meat and this one.  This got rave reviews, even from my husband who is no fan of vegetables, and especially eggplant.  He even said he would eat it again!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I had to use much more olive oil and garlic than 3 Tbsp to coat all the vegies.

This recipe was awesome.  I'm terrible at making lasagna, and this was the first one I made that actually tasted great.  I did a few things differently. I used italian tomatoes/sauce in place of pasta sauce, added tons of fresh basil, and spinache.  I also added some nutmeg in with the ricotta mixture.  I didn't read the recipe properly and I left out adding the mozzarella in the layering process, and just put it all on top.  Next time I'll add some more cheese in between the layers, and salt the ricotta mixture.  Thanks for the recipe.

Worth every minute of preparation! Everyone at our dinner party gave this lasagna rave reviews.

It was nice to slice fresh baked lasagna that didn't ooze all over the plate.

I did substitute low-fat cottage cheese for the ricotta. Then, I blended in the egg/parmesan using my potato masher to eliminate the curds.

Thanks for submitting this recipe :)

Thank  you so much for sharing this recipe!  I served it for a very important occasion and everyone was impressed.  The guests also cleaned their plates and finished the entire dish... next time i'll make more.  I enjoyed making the dish as well. This will go in my "recipes guaranteed to impress."  especially vegetarians. Very versatile as well.. you can use different vegetables but i liked all the vegetables in the original recipe.  I might want to have more sauce on hand to add more layers to the dish but otherwise... perfect and delicious!  Thank you again.

Excellent; will use this often. It was lots of work, timewise, but worth it. I used eggs instead of eggbeaters, and full-fat ricotta, 2 full 28 oz. jars of tomato/basil sauce, no fresh basil, and additional mozzarella. If you make and refrigerate this ahead of time and put it in the oven directly from the fridge, allow about 1-1/2 hours to fully cook. Hint: put the pan on a foil-lined cookie sheet to ease cleanup.

Very good! I did make a few adjustments. I put the eggplant & mushrooms in a ziploc with 2 cloves of garlic & olive oil & shook to coat before baking in the oven. I sauteed zucchini, onion & red bell pepper in olive oil, garlic (1 clove), salt, pepper & crushed red pepper for 5 minutes. I then added chopped spinach (frozen is all I had) & sauteed throughly. I layered the mixture per the directions and baked. It was flavorful & delicious!! You won't even miss the meat!!!

This was really good, I tweeked it alot and made my own sauce, lots of basil, parsley, thyme,chile peppers, cilantro, fresh tomatoes and I used tinned cans of stewed tomatoes, paste etc. Cajun seasonings and lots of onion and garlic. I only used zucchini, it was fantastic. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and a combination of Itailian cheeses and mozzarella. My husband loved it.

Wow, was this ever good!  Even my carnivorous husband loved it!

I made a few small modifications, but not many.  I used extra mushrooms and about 1 and a half pounds eggplant.  I only had 1 red pepper in the fridge so used orange pepper as well.  I used about half cup finely chopped basil and Used about 8 cloves of garlic finely minced.  I sprinkled some of the garlic on the mushrooms when I roasted them and the rest I sprinkled on each layer with the basil.  I also made my own sauce as I don't like using the store bought ones.

Next time I will add spinach as well.  And like another writer said, I think this would work with just about any veggie that you wanted.

Very good.  A definite one to make again!

I have made this twice. It was all eaten quickly. I use vegetables on hand: zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes (spinach is mixed with the ricotta). I roasted the veggies at least 30 minutes. Roasting the veggies makes them very flavorful & sometimes a little sweet.

Delicious, but quite a production.  Hence, the 4 stars.  Of course, being Italian, there is no such thing as too much garlic so I used twice the amount called for.  Also, next time I will try chopping all of the vegetables into small pieces and mix them with the olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, basil, etc. and roast them like that.  Then, just scoop and layer.  All of the "turning" is way too much work for me!

I really liked this recipe.  It makes for a fresh, different lasagna.  

I did read others who mentioned the no-bake noodles remained crisp on the top.  I had this problem with previous lasagnas and found that adding additional water around the edges of the lasagna creates the perfect noodles.

Excellent and superb! This puts normal lasagna to shame.

 I used two cloves of garlic and needed two jars of sauce. The top layer of noodles didn't get tender during the cooking time, so I flipped the vegetables on them and cooked it for another half hour. That is why you might want two jars of sauce.

When everyone goes back for seconds and compliments a dish, it definitely deserves 5 stars. I followed the recipe exactly and have to admit that it was time comsuming roasting the veggies and putting it together but definitely worth it.  I made this dish a few days in advance so that I would have an easy dish for visitors who were coming for dinner at the end of a work day.  Worked out really well.  It was an investment in time but worth it.

I loved this recipe!  Although to be honest, I made so many alterations I can hardly say I followed it!  Here is a list of changes I made:
I included the following roasted veggies:
1 eggplant
1 zuccini
2 yellow squash
8 oz. mushrooms
6 oz. portabello mushrooms
1 bundle asparagus
1 onion
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1/3 head cabbage

I also added 8 oz. spinach to the ricotta/parmasian cheese mixture, which I made with 30 oz. Ricotta, 1 cup shredded parmasian cheese, and 2 eggs.
I also included 3 diced fresh tomato.
For the sauce I ended up using 3 24 oz. jars of Barilla spaghetti sauce and one can of diced tomatoes (drained).
Grilling the veggies took more oil & garlic than I expected - about 18 Tablespoons of olive oil and 5 cloves of garlic.  I salted and peppered the veggies as called for in the recipe.
I also used TONS of mozzerela - about 10 cups all together, and a box and a half of oven ready lasanga noodles. 
All of this, layered as directed in a disposable - HUGE casserole pan.  I also used fresh Basil as called for.
There was a massive amount of prep involved in making this - which I divided across 3 days.  Night one, I chopped and prepped all of the veggies.  Night 2, I roasted veggies and assembled the lasanga.  And finally on day 3, I baked the lasagna.  It ended up taking 70 minutes covered, and an additional 10 minutes uncovered.
This was the best lasanga I've ever had - hands down.  And my picky hubby and kids concur!  Thanks so mu

Veggies took longer to cook. Lasagna itself too 1 hr and 15 mins It was absolutely amazing!
Alot of work but well worth it. Makes a lot and reheats well.  Big hit with kids as well as adults.

I used elephant garlic because it's a bit sweeter and I used more of it than the recipe called for.  I doubled everything and it still only served nine because once they tasted it, they took larger portions.  I recommend using Newman's Own Sockerooni Sauce, it adds good flavor.  I also tossed in a tablespoon of Italian seasonings when mixing the vegetables after roasting.

No happy with this recipe.  I love roasted vegetables, but I was very disappointed with this recipe.  When roasting the vegetables, most of the vegetables stuck to my baking sheet.  Also it tasted like something was missing from the entire dish.  Will not be using this recipe again.

Amazing!  Actually making this for about the 10th time for tonight.  My only changes or substitutions rather are to make my own tomato basil sauce instead of using jarred. I also roughly chop the vegetables after roasting and include wilted baby spinach in the ricotta. Although I LOVE to cook I am never able to eat my own cooking....with the exception of this recipe.  Both myself and my husband and son love it....it is time consuming but well worth the effort.

Needs more sauce!  I went through 2 jars of sauce.  I also added more mushrooms than suggested and added extra zucchini along with a bag of spinach.  Very tasty!

I made this for my girlfriends and they LOVED it!  I had to roast the vegetables a bit longer than the recipe, but no worries, b/c I did the roasting and assembling the night before our get-together.

This lasagna is absolutely delicious and worth the bit of extra effort. A nice lighter version of lasagna for a summer meal .  I give it five stars.

Excellent. Served to high school students- they had a choice of "regular" or "veggie" lasagna. Those who chose the veggie, loved it. My husband also loved it. Followed previous suggestion to add a layer of spinach, ricotta, egg, parmesan, to which I added 1 TB . oregano and black pepper. I used a plain ricotta, parmesan layer also.  Also used lots of garlic when roasting veggies and sprinkled the eggplant with thyme and the zucchini with basil to add more flavor to the overall dish.  Really not that time consuming to make as I was busy doing other things in the kitchen while the veggies roasted.  Looking forward to making again for my vegetarian sister.

Best vegetable lasagna I've ever had or made.  Truly a quality dish.  Roasting the veggies makes a big difference.  The only changes I made were using my own marinara sauce--I hate jarred sauce. I also used small sweet red, yellow & orange peppers, and whole wheat pasta.  I agree with other reviewers that more sauce is needed, but not much more.  The end result would be too runny as veggies have their own liquid when cooked.  I also just cut the veggies & tossed in oil/garlic.  I used much more garlic.  Make sure eggplant is not sliced too thin as it will fall apart.

This was an excellent lasagna recipe. I modified it by adding a jar of roasted red peppers to the recipe (I  drained and chopped them). I made the sauce by sauteing  an onion, garlic, italian seasoning, and then adding the chopped, drained roasted red peppers and marinara sauce - let it simmer for 10 minutes. I think this adds more flavor. I would definitely make this recipe again. The roasting of the vegetables added a lot of great flavor.

Fantastic mix of veggies - excellent taste and texture even with my cheater method (using the food processor to slice all vegetables then throwing them all in a pan together, tossing with oil and baking). I'm sure it would be even better if I took the time and care to do as instructed here.

I added a lot more vegetables to mine (I'm allergic to eggplant so I had to avoid using it); I used fresh tomatoes, spinach, red onions, and more of all the other vegetables. I also made my own sauce since jar sauce is always under-seasoned or too sweet. I don't use no-boil lasagna noodles because the texture is off putting. I didn't use any egg substitute, just mixed ricotta with cottage cheese and green onions like my mom does. This recipe is easy even if you swap all the "short-cuts" for longer steps.

I cooked the veggies about 10 minutes longer.  I also added an onion.  I did as some others said, and used 1 egg instead of the egg substitue; I used 4 cuts of spagheti sauce; and I precooked the lasagna for top before putting it on.  It was very good.  I will add some more basil to it next time.  Yummy.

Takes a bit of effort but worth every minute. I'm not a big eggplant fan, so I used yellow squash in it's place and stayed true to the rest of the recipe. Delish!! I might add some carrot and broccoli next time.

Very very good..definate hit.  I used portabelo mush. instead of eggplant (because out of season), 6 cloves garlic, ~2cups chopped broccoli, 
~5 small zucchini & 3 red bell peppers, plus 16 oz mushrooms.  All fit into a 9x13 with 3 layers of noodles.  I chopped/roasted mushrooms and then all other veggies together w/evo & garlic as previously suggested and worked great.  Portabelos really were great, i would use them again before trying eggplant!!

I wanted to try a meat free lasagna. While this was good, I just didn't like it as much as my usual lasagna.  I will say I liked this better the next day after the flavors had some time to meld. This was a little cumbersome to put together.  The roasting of the veggies is fine, but my oven didn't fit them all at the same time. So that in itself added extra time I didn't plan on.  I also added extra sauce as suggested by others.  The amount called for really isn't enough at all. I ended up using two cans of sauce - so 52 ounces total.  It all fit in the pan just fine.  I may try a meat free lasagna again, but probably not this recipe.

I had 12 women to book club last night.  One eats gluten free and one is a vegetarian.  I made this recipe twice, but added roasted Vidalia onions and spinach to the recipe.  I used rice lasagna noodles in the second lasagna (a small one).  EVERYONE asked for seconds!  My only advise is to use 5 zucchini if you are making a big one, as I ran out at the end and had to go to the store for another one.  But, this is a great meal for a large group.

Yum! Gave only 4 stars simply because I made some changes. Sauteed mushrooms and onions and added to cheese/egg (real egg) mixture. Chopped up roasted veggies and tossed with some EVOO and salt/pepper. Layered as suggested and it came out amazing! My boyfriend had three helpings :)

This is my FAVORITE lasagna! Even my beef-loving husband will eat this and likes it! I follow the recipe almost exactly - I leave out the mushrooms for personal preference, use 1 whole egg instead of egg substitute, and sprinkle parsley flakes and red pepper flakes in with the ricotta cheese mixture. This is a time-consuming dish to make, but it is VERY well worth it!!

This is a great vegetable lasagna recipe.  I followed the recipe except I left out the red pepper & added 3 cloves of garlic as recommended in another review.  Since I was preparing this for just the 2 of us...I split it into 2 small casseroles and froze one.  I did use more than 1 jar of sauce..about a jar & 1/2.  Had a great flavor - even though eggplant is not my favorite.  I would like to try it again with spinach :-)

Great recipe.  I am helping my daughter, her husband and 3 year old big sister with newborn baby boy.  It is the second time in 2 weeks to make it, freeze some of it and have the rest for dinner.  Roasting the veggies is the key to this recipe.

I made some alterations to the recipe, but it is definitely a solid starting point.  I made my own sauce, and easily used more than a cup or two more than what it called for.  I used whole wheat noodles that were slightly undercooked.  I put a layer of spinach in too.  I think roasting the veggies is a must.  I almost skipped that step to save time, but that would have been a big mistake.  I used cottage cheese in place of ricotta and a real egg.  I added parsley to the cottage cheese/egg mixture.  All in all, it was delicious.  I got rave reviews from our guests, one of whom is a true Italian!

This was delish.  I couldn't get eggplant so used portobello mushrooms with other roasted vegetables.  I also increased the garlic and because my pan was larger, I needed 15 no boil noodles.  Very filling and satisfying.  Freezes well too even though I thought the roasted vegetables would make it watery.  Great dish

I made this recipe last night, we were ready to eat and then got a call that a family member was in hospital. It was left on top of the stove till around midnight when we arrived home, starving, only to have no electricity and the temperateure was -2 outside. Anyway, with only a slight warmth left to the lasagna, it was delicious by candlelight!

I think you could use whatever vegetables you have on hand, that's what I did, and it's perfect. I loved this!

Absolutely fantastic!!  My husband and I decided that we wanted to eat less meat in 2011, hence the reason for trying this recipe.  I saw someone else's comment about too little sauce, and added a tin of tomato and onion mix to the sauce beforehand.  Someone also suggested leaving the lasagne sheets in hot water whilst preparing the vegetables, but by the time I needed to use these, they were so stuck together that I battled to undo them, so next time will probably not do that.  Needed a bit more oil to brush all the veggies.  However, the final result was just sooooo good.  I plan to freeze the remaining portions (only 2 of us), for 'a rainy day'.  Loved this lasagne, and will definitely be making it again and again!  Thank you!

LOVED this recipe! made it for my inlaws anniversary dinner :) I changed it up a bit i did not use ANY mushrooms and added summer squash i roasted the red pepper seperatly over the fire on my stove and pealed them... I pealed the eggplant cause i think thats one of the reasons alot of people do not like eggplant....OH and I did not add ANY extra salt. I am a lowsodium all the way kind of gal! :) LOVED THIS VERSION

This is amazing!!!  I did add spinach to the ricotta mixture and used rice noodles, but absolutely delicious.  I would recommend reducing the olive oil in the roasted veggies as I didn't use the full amount and it was a bit much.  ENJOY!!!

This was the first lasagna I'd ever made and it was a HIT! A little extra prep but not complicated at all, and the results were so worth it. Not overly saucy (to be honest, the perfect amount of sauce in my opinion) and had just the right amount of veggies. Granted, I am a roasted veggie lover so I guess it shouldn't be a huge surprise that I loved it. However, everyone else (including hardcore "lasagna HAS to have meat!" enthusiasts) raved about it as well. This is automatically going into my "Everyone Loves!" folder.

SO delicious!  I have a couple vegetarian friends, and seem to always neglect their needs when I'm throwing a party.  Even our buffalo chicken dip has meat in it!  So I made this dish, and it was so delicious, I wished I had made an extra pan of it for the next day.  The only changes I made: used a real egg instead of substitute (it doesn't sit well with me or my husband) and mixed in spinach leaves with the ricotta cheese.  I think I'll use regular lasagna noodles next time, because even after saving a bunch of sauce for the top layer, the noodles still turned out a bit crunchy.  Otherwise, great dish!  I can't wait to make it again.

Amazing. I loved the recipe! The textures are so nice and everything went so well together. Much heartier than I anticipated. I found it very easy to make and this was my lasagna. I followed the recipe exactly except I used whole wheat pasta.

This was a very good recipe. I took the advice of others and tossed the vegetables in a bowl with the olive oil to coat instead of brushing. I also used whole wheat lasagna. My husband was reluctant to try this because he does not like eggplant or zucchini. He also liked it! I will definitely make this again.

Not bad!  I took people's suggestions and added more sauce (2 jars) and doubled the mushrooms.  I also double the cheese mixtures and add roasted carrots. Will add more basil next time. I also make three layers instead of two. Love the roasted flavor.

Absolutely out of this world incredible. I tried SO many veggi lasagna recipes - nothing ever came close to the meat alternative. Until now!   Here is what I did different. I omitted basil (don't really like the taste of cooked basil - like it fresh.) Used 2x the sauce (4-cheese pasta sauce from Whole Foods,) 5x parmasan, NO EGGS or EGG SUBSTITUTE (due to egg allergies,) full-fat organic ricotta (gives so much more depth to the dish.)   I also used all organic ingredients. Because of that, it cost about $40 to make this lasagna for about 8 people.

This was a tasty dish.  The vegetables were delicious!

Since the lasagna noodles are no-boil, make sure there is plenty of sauce on the top layer to soak the noodle (otherwise comes out dry.)

Wonderful recipe.  I did not use eggplant or mushrooms.  Roasted  onion, 3 colors of bell pepper, zucchini with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Chopped into small pieces.  Also added marinated artichoke hearts, chopped small and fresh baby spinach.  It was the best lasagna ever! Roasting whatever veggies you choose makes all the difference. Great flavor.

Loved this! I was not able to get zucchini and I added extra mushrooms. I used two egg whites instead of the substitute, and used two jars of sauce and a can of diced tomatoes. SOOOO good! Best meal I have had in a long time.

The taste of this lasagna was excellent.  Used a spicy tomato sauce which jazzed it up.  Didn't like the noodles though, think they absorbed too much of the liquid which made it a little dry.  Next time will use whole wheat noodles that I boil myself.

This was delicious!  I am cutting back on my meat consumption and was craving lasagna.  The roasted veggies gave this a unique taste.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I used fresh basil, added a sauted oinion the the pasta sauce, and used a real egg.  I will be making th again.  My 3 year old and my husband loved it.  Next time I think I may roast my red peppers by themselves and peel the skin off after roasting.

Absolutely delicious!  The veggies are really what make it.  Also, it would be easy to change up the veggies if someone doesn't like eggplant or zucchini for example.  Also I only used 2 layers of noodles which was fine with me but it could have used some more layers.  Otherwise I will be using the recipe from now on for my vegetable lasagna.

Followed directions besides the fact that I used green peppers instead of red, added garlic to the basil, and used an egg instead of egg substitute.  I loved it-which is especially impressive because I do not usually like eggplant.  My husband did not even notice there was no meat in it-I told him the next day!  Great recipe!

This is a lovely lasagna.  I assembled it in the morning, then we baked it when we got home.  Since it was cold from the fridge, I increased the bake temp to 375 and baked at 45 min then took off the tin foil for 10 prior to serving.  I don't have fresh mushroms in the house, so I didn't roast those and just opened a can of them to dump in.  Bf doesn't like ricotta and I don't have cottage cheese so I just subbed sour cream, which works well enough although you don't end up with quite the same consistency.  This turned out really well.  I would add more veggies next time; I was thinking it would be too many, but with the roasting it really reduced the size.  Otherwise, it's just great.  I love tomato sauces and and haven't really seen a veggie lasagna using tomato sauce; it's usually alfredo, so this is right up my alley.  Thank you for the recipe!

I just couldn't bring myself to use a jarred spaghetti sauce. Just saute an onions in a pot, add a 12 oz can of tomato paste with a couple of 15oz. cans of tomatoes or fresh tomatoes. From there, you're just adding 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of salt, about 1/2 tsp of pepper...or adjust to your own taste. I didn't add garlic to the sauce, as I usually do, because it's already on the veggies. I threw the basil into my sauce, too, to help bring out the flavor. I used one egg instead of egg substitute and whole wheat pasta. Instead of cooking the lasagna, I let it sit in a pot of warm water, while I prepared everything else. That way, I don't risk overcooking the pasta. All of the moisture in the veggies, sauce, etc will cook it the rest of the way in the oven. I also had to make a couple of extra batches of oil/garlic for my veggies (I'm a HUGE fan of garlic, though). I added some spinach to the veggies as well, because that's what I'm used to in my veggie lasagna. Overall, I thought it was pretty good. After years of eating lasagna with meat, I was missing the presence of Italian sausage. However, even my mom, who hates parmesan cheese, ricotta, AND spinach enjoyed this and raved to her friends about it.

Great! I just needed to add more sauce on the top because the noodles dried out. I accidentally poured a bigger third on the 2nd layer. Readers, follow directions on the red peppers and zucchini, because I ended up seeing water on the bottom of the pan after I cut and served. As for taste, manga!

The lasagna ended up being a little dry.  Next time I'll use more sauce and maybe try Alfredo sauce on some layers.  The roasted veggies were great-not crunchy I've had with other vegetable lasagnas.  Will use this recipe again.

Excellent!  Made for Christmas Eve dinner to have as a healthier option to go along with mother-in-laws traditional lasagna.  Everyone, even m-i-l, ate it and raved about it.  Husband even said I could make this instead of traditional lasagna from now on.

This was good, BUT: noodles just don't line up and cook right, if you place them 4 across...also, not nearly enough sauce OR veggies...next time I will have to almost double both.  In the end, roasting the veggies was a very nice touch, when I previously just threw them in raw...a nice, different flavor.  I ended up doubling the ricotta and mozzarella, also, as we are big cheese lovers!

The only thing I would change is that I would NEVER, EVER use bottled sauce. It's full of salt and sugar. Make your own. It's easy, and you know what's in it!

This was just so delicious.  It was a little watery, but that problem disappears once it's refrigerated and reheated.  If I wasn't worried about my waistline, I would have probably used more mozzarella on top, but it was definitely still rich and filling enough for me when I made according to the directions.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and omitted the egg, but it turned out great.

Unbelievable. I did pick out just a couple of ingredient/cooking method changes that were suggested by previous reviewers to fit our tastes (sauteed mushrooms, left out the red peppers, used one baking dish) but we kept the majority of the recipe the same. As eggplant-and-zucchini-loving vegetarians, this dish was super delicious!!

This is my husband's new vegetarian favorite.  Used feta instead of Ricotta and dry basil instead of fresh.  I think it could use a bit more tomato sauce, but that's my only suggestion.

This is so good!  I did a half/half lasagna.  My husband's half had meat on it and mine had veggies only.  I only use Annarinos sauce and Barilla lasagna noodles!  You'll love this one!

This dish was delicious and easy to make. I used about half the ricotta mixture and threw the mushrooms in the sauce instead of roasting them. The roasted veggies added such flavor to the jarred pasta sauces. The carnivores loved this as well.

I am a beginner, never have made lasagna or watched someone make it, so I found this recipe a little difficult to juggle everything needed to do. It turned out good but I will definitely use more sauce next time as it was way too dry.

When I made this I sprayed a large cast iron skillet and browned the egg plant, squash and onions together. In addition to the low fat ricotta I also added a container of low fat cottage cheese. This slices up so nicely I put a square in a quart freezer bag. It sure makes for a nice leftover meal when I don't feel like cooking.

So great. Lots of time, but definitely worth it. I sliced the veggies very thin and kept a close eye on them so they didn't burn. Delicious! Will definitely make again and again. Even  meatlovers loved it.

This is a great recipe! Took it to a party with meat lovers and everyone raved about it! I modified it a bit. First, I doubled it for a larger crowd. I used reglar noodles and pre-boiled them. Added spinach to my ricotta mixture, doubled the sauce by adding crushed tomatoes to it, and then added red pepper flakes to the sauce for a slight kick. Also roasted a combination of red and yellow peppers. My layers were sauce, noodles, ricotta, eggplant, sauce, cheese, noodles, ricotta, zucchini/mushroom/pepers, sauce, cheese, noodles, sauce, sliced provolone to finish it off. A definite keeper!

My family loved this recipe. I made a few changes though. I added garlic powder, 2 eggs and spinach to the ricotta cheese. I chopped and mixed the vegetables after they were cooked and then layered them on the noodles along with sauce and ricotta cheese. I layered the top with mexican style  mix cheese since I didn't have any mozzarella cheese. This is a great recipe to serve if you are having company over for dinner. I look forward to making this meal again.

Lasagna isn't something I typically make because it never turns out amazing. However this recipe did turned out to be absolutely amazing!!! The roasted veggies really make a huge difference. 

I made a few adjustments
1. I used a cup more ricotta and mixed in spinach that I copped in the food processor, a little kosher salt, pepper and two eggs.
2. My husband doesn't eat these veggies so i only put veggies on half the lasagna. I used almost a whole eggplant, one zucchini (though 2 would have been better) and half a package of mushrooms and no peppers. 
3. I used 3 cloves garlic instead of one.
4. I used regular lasagna noodles prepared per box instructions. 
5. I subbed the fresh basil for dry.
6. I used a few more oz of sauce bacuse I ran out by the time I got to the top.

Delicious! My only critiques are that I used a little extra sauce and the no-boil noodles didn't cook on the top layer. I just pulled them off, but next time I will probably boil them anyway. I will definitely make this again.

This was so good and full of flavor.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I used squash vodka pasta sauce.

I've never worked with eggplant so I asked my local produce manager how to handle & prepare it.  Afterwards I read this recipe over again before I started & was then completely confused & hesitant to make it!  Not any mention of salting & rinsing the eggplant!  So I blindly followed the recipe & it was delish!    I divided the pasta sauce in half & added Italian seasoned diced tomatoes for more texture. Also mixed Ricotta & cottage cheese & added spinach.    Made this to take to a family event & had NO idea what it would taste like, so I put my faith in my lovely niece Laura (no stranger to vegetarian dishes) to be honest with me.  Thumbs up all the way, so I will make it again!

Fabulous!  I omitted mushrooms, used roasted red peppers from a jar, Prego sauce, added one chopped onion to the roasted veggies.  I added quite a bit more mozz cheese and spinach too.  Also used whole wheat noodles. It was a total hit at our family reunion!  Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent veggie dish.  I added 2 extra garlic cloves, used half small curd cottage cheese, half ricotta cheese, and used a mix of parmesan, asiago and mozerella cheese instead of plain parmesan.  My entire family loved it including the guests we had for dinner.

This lasagna is great! I skipped the red pepper out of personal preference and increased the other veggies accordingly. The roasted veggies really make the dish! I placed the garlic, oil and veggies in a gallon ziploc bag and coated them before baking. I also sliced the veggies a little smaller and just cooked them all together for 30 minutes (turned at 15min). I also used 1 egg instead of the substitute. Finally, even though I don't love tomato sauce, I thought it needed a bit more than 26 ounces. This was quite simple and really delicious! I can't wait to add to the list of vegetarian options!

I almost feel like it's unfair to rate this because I changed so much, but here it goes.  It gets a 4 because of the time and effort involved, which seems unnecessarily long.  I roasted the eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini, and a green bell pepper in the oven, covered in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  We have to eat gluten free and only selected dairy, so I had to make some changes.  I used gluten-free rice lasagna noodles.  I added some ground turkey to the pasta sauce (half of a jar of pre-prepared plus a can of crushed tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder).  And instead of ricotta or cottage cheese, I made a bechamel sauce and we used almond-derived mozzarella cheese.  I added some sauteed spinach and garlic cloves to the veggies and layered it up!  Looks and smells delicious.  Just a little time-consuming...

OUTSTANDING!  My Family loved it   Only change was I threw the veggies into a large bowl and poured olive oil over it and rubbed it into them instead of brushing it on.  Can't wait to make it again!  Thanks Virginia.

Very delicious.  Didn't miss the meat at all!  I added one can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of red wine to the pasta sauce for more flavor.  I love lasagna and think I may like this better than the traditional.

This was the most delicious vegetable lasagna! I'll admit that the prep was a bit much for me, but well worth it -- and I'll definitely make this again. I'm always looking for healthy recipes for my boyfriend so I was glad to find that this recipe called for reduced fat ricotta. I also loved that it used the no-boil lasagna noodles. The consistency of the lasagna itself was solid, not runny. The only change I made was using 3 large garlic cloves (1 just didn't seem like enough) and I thought it was perfect. I took the leftovers to the girls in the office and they immediately went online to download the recipe. This is definitely a favorite!

This was FANTASTIC! My meat and potato lovin husband thought it was great (I had to tell him it was all veggie) I did use 2 jars of sauce, fat free ricotta and extra mozzarella. It was super easy just time consuming with the roasting and all, but so worth it! I will be making this again.

Very good!  I don't like mushrooms, so I omitted them, and you do need more sauce than is called for.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it takes quite a while, but it was delicious.  My husband (who is a meat-loving guy) said it was great.  I will definitely make this again!

This was super tasty, I gave it only 4 stars because it was quite time consuming and my veggies lost their shape after roasting and became smooshy.  Either I would cut them thicker or roast them for less time.

My husband is eating his second huge helping of this fabulous veggie lasagna. I made just two changes..left out the mushrooms (because we don't like them) and added a full layer of fresh spinach.  This is my lasagna from now on!

Wonderful recipe. I did add an extra clove of garlic to the roasted vegetables, also extra mozzarella to the lasagna. For added flavor, the tomato sauce I used was Bertolli's Tomato & Basil. Complimented the vegetables very nicely :)

This was excellent.  Used baby bella's, zucchini, yellow squash, (diced) red pepper and fresh sweet corn for the roasting veggies.  Steamed some broccoli.  Sauteed onion, (added more) garlic and some carrots with seasoning...and then mixed it together and let sit in a big bowl for a while.  This was a great hit, even the non-vegetable eater in the house enjoyed it!

Don't let the three stars discourage you from trying this...it was really good.  I have just had better. I will make it again since it presents very nicely, but I'll serve with extra sauce on the side.

I hate ricotta, so I substituted that with fresh mozzarella that I sliced by hand.  I also used sun dried tomato paste when making the sauce to bring out the tomato taste.  This recipe is so versatile that you can add your vegetables and customize and it still tastes amazing.  Thank you!

This was good.  I added a lot more veggies and tripled the recipe, ate one, froze one and brought one to a vegetarian friend who just had a baby.  She loved it.  The veggies I had in ours was spinach, peppers, onionm, carrots, cabbage, zuchinni, yellow squash, eggplant and mushrooms.

My new favorite lasagna recipe.  The roasted eggplant makes it so rich and delicious.  Leftovers frozen for two months were consumed last night and were just as good as the night the dish was originally made!

Next Time I would peel the eggplant, and my veggies took a lot longer to start to brown, which made the time issue a bummer, but it was absolutely delicious!  I also used cottage cheese - I like it better in Lasagna.

The best-well worth the extra effort to roast the veggies it gave it the best flavor-- even the ones that don't like veggies came back for seconds.Next time I will double the amount of filling and peeled the eggplant(the 2yr old had trouble with the skin) This one went into the recipe box it is a keeper

This is a great recipe. I've served it twice, both times to rave reviews. I took others' suggestions and increased the amount of vegetables as well as added spinach to the cheese mixture. I also used regular lasagna noodles (rather than no-boil) because I still prefer them when I have the time. I'm totally sold on using roasted vegetables for lasagna and will probably use this recipe exclusively from now on. It's exactly what I've been looking for in a vegetable lasagna.

A wonderful lasagna recipe! The roasted vegetables are really the stars of this dish. I didn't have any bell peppers, so I made do without and it still turned out great. I mixed some chopped spinach in with the ricotta--delicious! I also agree with some of the previous reviews: use more sauce and more garlic than the recipe recommends. I will definitely make this again.

This was my first lasagna and it turned out beautifully! I made one change, adding chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture. The second time I made this recipe, I doubled it and froze one, because it does take quite a bit of time. But it is definitely worth the work. I will make this recipe again and again and again.

I would give this 89000 starts however the original recipe grossly underestimates the volume of veggies and garlic it will require to take to fill the lasagna.

I had do almost double the amount of veg (used baby bellas, zucchini, carrots, onions, summer squash, tomatoes, broccoli, caluiflower) in my recipe.

Also doubled the sauce; used Muir Glen organic roasted tomato.

Used fat free ricotta and light cheese, no boil noodles.

It was, however, DELICIOUS with these changes.  I make it ALL of the time.

Very good! my vegatarin daughter loved it. I did not use red sauce so I used olive oil on the bottom of the pan instead. I also used all fat-free ricotta cheese was surprised it still tasted wonderful. Will make again

This was very good.  I would have used a little more sauce but I only had the one jar or I would maybe even have cut down some of the ricotta.  I would have preferred to taste the vegetables a little more.  That said, I thought it was great as written and would make it again.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  Like some reviews suggested, I used a bit more sauce than the recipe called for, it would have been dry had I not used more.  If you are a vegitable lover like myself this is a good recipe.

I've made this several times now & love it! My non-vegetarian friends also love it & come back for more.
The only change I make is to use a regular egg; and also to add about a tablespoon of grated nutmeg to the ricotta cheese sauce.

Roasting the vegetables made this a little bit more labor intensive than I expected, but the flavor was well worth it.   I added some chopped parsley to the ricotta mixture, and used whole wheat lasagna noodles (which I did pre-boil).  I also added a couple handfuls of chopped fresh spinach with each vegetable layer.  Overall I think it could have used just a bit more sauce, but it's still an excellent, excellent lasagna!

DELISH!  I thought this recipe was quite tasty and easy to make.  For the veggies I used eggplant, zucchini and yellow summer squash.  The roasted eggplant was so good I would consider making my next lasagna using just eggplant for the veg.  I added some chopped garlic to the ricotta mixture since you can never have enough garlic!  I  needed to use 1 and 1/2 jars of sauce, 1 doesn't quite cut it.  I also added some Italian seasoning to the sauce.  YUM, enjoy!

I would almost double the amount of vegtables used because I found that there wasn't enough substance to the lasagna - but that's just me.  This was great warmed up the next day.

DELICIOUS!!!  I wouldnt change a thing about the recipe but I would do two things different regarding the method.  First, I would toss the ingredients in the oil rather than brush (as that seemed a little tedious).  Second, I would definately peel the red peppers before putting them in the lasagna.  I spent a lot of time pulling the skins out as I was eating.  This may not bother some people but for me I think I will roast the peppers whole and then peel and chop them next time.  Overall, a total success!

I made this for my vegetarian friends on Thanksgiving and you would have thought I served them heaven on a plate.  I got such rave reviews.  Not bad considering this was my first lasagna.  Only change I made was I added store bought alfredo to the very top layer, topped it with the suggested amount of cheese, then added tomato slices and whole basil leaves on the top for decoration.  This is truly an excellent recipe.

Wow. What a delicious lasagna! I just finished it now, and I am so looking forward to having leftovers! I made the recipe almost exactly as written - I only substituted a green pepper as I didn't have enough red peppers on hand. When I make this again (and I will definitely be making this again) I will try a few things. I'd like to try it with portabello mushrooms and spinach. I would also like to make my own tomato sauce - to cut down on the sodium. But that's it.

Wonderful recipe. Thank you so much! My lunch the rest of the week is going to be delicious!

Thank you for the awesome recipe!  My in-laws loved this-it was great!  The roasted veggies add the best flavor.  I will definitely make this again; I may try to replace the ricotta with a bechamel sauce next time.  I will definitely experiment with other veggies.  This is my new favorite lasagna-everybody had seconds and I was asked for the recipe by my mother in law AND sister in law.  A hit!!

I omitted eggplant and added slices of onions and asparagus and about a tablespoon of sun dried tomato paste. I also reduced the mozzarella by half. I used whole wheat penne instead of lasagna noodles and just made a casserole out of it.

Next time, I'll add the squash closer to the end of the roasting period.

This was one of the best recipes I have tried from allrecipes.com. It was incredible.

Easy to make and very tasty!  I toss the vegetables with the olive oil and garlic before roasting them, and they absorb the flavors nicely.  I also use some spinach (not roasted), as well as red peppers, zucchini, squash, and eggplants.

My first try at lasagna and it came out great.Thanks to the reviewers that suggested tossing instead of brushing veggies. Added a little garlic powder in between layers. Would also cook uncovered a few minutes more to brown cheese slightly on top .Great recipe.My teenage son even liked it. Will do again.

This was a very good lasagna. In fact, so good I HAD to make a review. Some of the edges of the noodles were a little less soft than I wanted, but this could have been due to inefficient spread of the sauce. I would take the advice of another reviewer and toss the vegetables in butter and garlic rather than brushing.

This recipe is sooo awesome!  My husband who claims to hate anything and everything eggplant gets so excited when he knows I'm making this.  
I cheat a little and make it distinctly non-vegetarian and brown sweet sausage and add it to the sauce-it's incredible! I also use almost two jars of the spaghetti sauce.  The other modification I make is to use 1/2 the ricotta cheese the recipe calls for and sub with about 6 oz of cream cheese, it makes it really smooth and creamy.  The recipe is amazing as is without my changes though, thanks so much for sharing!

This was okay, I added a lot more garlic and olive oil though. If the eggplant browns as it cooks, it does not taste good at all in this.

After years this is still my go-to lasagna recipe. I change up the veggies as I don't care for eggplant or mushrooms but it's the roasting that is the key. My meat loving guests never miss the meat! Tastes even better the next day.

My family loved this recipie, and asks for it at least once a week. I had to leave the eggplant out (hubby doesnt like it), and just added zucchini. I sauteed the veggies in olive oil, garlic & chopped onions. For everything else, I followed the recipie exactly. This is a staple recipie in my house! Thank you!

Superb.  Was served at a Vegetarian Thanksgiving and had nothing but rave reviews.  The two vegetarians at the table commented that it was the best they'd ever eaten.  The meat eaters loved it too, all went back for a second helping.  I followed the recipe to a tee, aside from the part where you're directed to brush the veggies (I bagged them and shook) and also added a couple extra cloves of garlic to the oil/garlic combo.

Just average. A lot of trouble for not too much yum. It was fairly tasty, but no better than a regular veggie lasagna.

My family loved this lasgna. It was my first foray into lasagna, and was a complete success. I did, though, ignore the use of egg-beaters, no-cook noodles and fat-free stuff. I used green peppers instead of zukes and the combination of red pepper, green pepper and egg plant went over great. Good instructions and organization directions for even a tyro like myself!

This recipe is fabulous! My non-vegetarian friends were raving at our dinner party! Taking the time to roast the vegetables in advance is well worth it but ensure you give yourself enough time to do this recipe properly!

This is now the only lasagna recipe I will use.  I would recommend the following: use more mushrooms; add about 1/2 cup water to the tomato sauce (cooks the noodles better); add spinach and about 1 cup dry cottage cheese to the ricotta mixture; reduce cheese to 1 cup and only put it on the top.  This recipe impresses everyone I cook it for.

This is the best lasagna ever.  My husband asks for it over and over.  I find that grilling the vegys on the grill was so much easier.  I used extra virgin olive oil in a spray can to apply the oil a lot easier.  Added onions and garlic as well.  Very tasty!

This is amazing, however it is a pain to bake the veggies.  I had to use three large pans!  Next time I think i'll saute the mushrooms, peppers, and zucchini in a pan.  And only bake the eggplant.

This is very good, but I feel spaghetti sauce masks the flavor of the roasted vegetables. I prefer another recipe from this website: "Greek pasta salad with roasted vegetables and feta".

This was good. I think that I left my vegies too big.  Next time I will cut them smaller.  Also, the eggplant was bitter.  I guess I should have sweated it.

I didn't have any ricotta, so I just used a mixture of freshly grated parmesan and mozzarella sprinkled on top of the layers (with no egg to hold them together), and it was delicious! I also added a little diced onion, chopped spinach, and fresh basil. My meat-loving sister (who despises eggplant) loved it!

This is awesome.  If you are sick of the same old, same old lasagna this is for you.  When I first read the recipe it seemed time consuming but it's not bad at all.  I omitted the zucchini because I don't like it and I added a couple more cloves of garlic to the oil.  Other than that I followed it to the letter.  Absolutely delicious.

Delicious!  I did what some others had done and added more sauce to each layer and over the top.  I also mixed chopped fresh spinach into the cheese mix along with some seasoning. Over-all it was fantastic and a huge hit worth the time to make.

This was my first veg. lasagna and it was awesome!  I made it because I have a friend who is a vegetarian coming over for dinner.  I'm a big meat eater, but this pleased everyone, even my husband.  I didn't have any eggplant in the house, but I have a lot of zucchini so I just used a little extra of all the other veggies to make up for it.  Everyone loved it and the leftovers didn't last long!

This lasagna is well worth the time! I also chop up a block of tofu and add it to the ricotta for protein--and non-vegetarians will never know! I call it my "life or death" lasagna b/c I make for anyone who has a baby or a death in the family.  It has gotten rave reviews.  Just one major adjustment--I found I did not like the "no-bake" noodles as much...they are probably good if you know someone is freezing it (need to add extra sauce), but if you will be eating it that night, I would go with traditional noodles.

The flavor of this was very good, but I found it needed a lot more vegetables.  Next time I will probably double the amount I put in and maybe add some others as well.  Overall worth repeating!

First of all, I am not a good cook in fact anything I cook and its not burnt amazes my family.  I made this recipe for the first time for Christmas dinner and it was a BIG hit.  I enjoyed making it as well as eating it.  I used real eggs and added carrots. I had never cooked Eggplant before so I had to look up how to cook it.  I didn't even know how to peel it. It worked out fine.  I may not ever buy lasagna out of the grocer's freezer again.

Delicious! I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but there just wasn't enough sauce so I had to use almost 2 jars. It was perfect - not too saucy and it all held together perfectly. The flavor was great. Next time I might add more red pepper - fantastic flavor. Vegetarians and carnivores alike raved about this. Yummy!
UPDATE: I liked this even more when I used half ricotta and half mascarpone. Plus, the second time I made it I added more egg plant and more red pepper - I thought it was even better.

This lasagna was delicious!  Some carnivore friends even fell for it :)  The grocery store was out of eggplant, so I added extra zucchini and mushrooms and it was plenty hearty.  You definitely need more than one can of sauce, though.  One and a half did the trick for my batch.  Highly recommend it!

Quite possibly the best lasagna I have ever made. It tasted great and held up perfectly. Usually the first slice is messy but this one looked like it belonged in a magazine.

A lot like my standard lasagna recipe -- I used 2 eggs instead of egg replacer and put some garlic powder, black pepper and parsley in w the cheese mix.  I liked the roasted veggies, but hubby the carnivore just said OK.

This took more time to prepare (mainly roasting the vegetables) but everyone seemed to enjoy it and it went quick!

This was probably the best lasagna I've ever had.  Made for others and they all raved about it.  Will definitely make again.
