I was really skeptical, but this turned out way better than I expected. I made it with strawberries that were just passed their best, and cherry flavored Kool Aid. It tasted really fresh and fruity. Thanks, Connie!

Very easy! The kids picked watermelon/kiwi koolaid. When I finished filling the jars the kids grabbed bread and wiped the pot clean. This will be fun to give with fresh baked bread to friends and new neighbors.

I made a number of really tasty (and complicated) jams and jellies last year.  This was one of the easiest and tastiest.  As stated in the recipe, this is a refrigerator jam.  It has not been tested for long-term storage after canning.  Stay safe canners!  :)
