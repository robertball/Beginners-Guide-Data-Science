I made this for my usual Saturday night family gathering and it was a big hit! They all loved it. I will be making this again. The only change I made was I used a sweet Vidalia onion instead of a Spanish onion. I also want to mention be sure to set the scallops on a paper towel before placing on the potatoes to remove excess oil and keep the potoatos crisp!

Delicious!  Definitely a keeper.  Followed directions except I used a jalape√±o and added cilantro and some salt to the salsa.

Refreshing and light.   I made this as a main dish but it works better as an appetizer.  I love the mango, lime and salt flavors together.
