This pie is so so so delicious!  I only used half of the maple cream filling in my pie and the subtle maple flavour was perfect.  I'll use the other half tonight when I make another one.  Thanks for such a great recipe - it'll be part of our Thanksgivings and Christmases and Summer birthdays.

I thought this pie was 'ok'....everyone who tried it felt the same. I followed the instructions exactly. I think maybe the pie would have tasted better if I only used half the filling, because the pie pan was overflowing with filling and it just was waaaaaaaaaay too rich (and I like rich foods!) I don't know if I'd make it again.

I really liked this pie, and so did my daughter (she thought it tasted like a coffee cake).  However, the other members of my family were not so keen on it (thought it was too sweet or didn't like creamy filling in an apple pie).  I suspect that a 9" crust may be too small for the ingredients because it filled my 10" crust quite nicely.  Although I followed the recipe exactly, I wondered how it would taste to shortcut the streusel topping using packets of instant maple & brown sugar oatmeal mixed with the flour and butter.

Made this as directed, except I subsituted Maple & Brown Sugar instant oatmeal for the rolled oats, and maple syrup for the maple extract.  It's quite tasty and the maple cream layer cuts the sweetness of the apple and streusel layers well.  I think my only complaint is that the maple cream layer seems a little soft...I wonder what would happen if I left the extra 1/2 cup of milk out of it.  I couldn't cut and serve a piece...it was more like dishing out banana pudding or something of similar consistency.  I also left the apples in the skillet (didn't really end up with extra syrup because of this) and the streusel on the pan to cool so I didn't have to use extra dishes.  Overall though, quite tasty and a great alternative to apple pie!

This was really good. I halved the cream cheese layer because some people said it didn't go well with the apples. I didn't have any maple extract so I used maple granola in the cruncy topping, and I actually made some maple pudding with real maple syrup and poured that over the apples before putting the topping on. The flavors all melded together well, and it was actually a pretty good pie.

I thought this pie was SOOOO good! For some reason, I didn't have extra sauce from the apples to drizzle over the top. Next time, I will use more butter.

The apple and streusel layers are great, BUT the maple cream layer just doesn't go well with the rest of the pie.  It just wasn't a good tasting pie because of the cream layer!

This is a different yet amazing pie recipe! My husband absolutely loved it. I used more mild flavored apples (red delicious) and wish that I had used the more tart ones instead. It needed the extra fruit flavor but even with the mild ones this was soooo good. I might try this with peaches too! Yum!
