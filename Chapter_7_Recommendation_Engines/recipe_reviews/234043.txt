This was my first time making biscotti and it seems to have turned out well. I followed the recipe and directions as written. I personally need to flatten out my dough better next time, but I look forward to making this again. The icing is amazing!

Good recipe but I would suggest cooking it longer the second time to dry it out more. Glaze tasted lovely, did slightly less icing sugar than suggested.

My mother because of health problems no longer cooks.  So it is up to me to keep her in Biscotti.  I have made lots of biscotti most of my own design.  This is a very nice one to make.  I did skip the glaze because of her diet concerns.  Also I used a sugar substitute.  She loved it and that is all that matters.  I am not a fan of Biscotti but it smelled great to me.

I love biscotti and this is a nice variation.  I used pure Grade B  maple syrup to get the ultimate maple flavor.  I increase the baking time in the slices, turning them over after eight minutes and baking them an additional eight minutes for a crunchier biscotti.

This recipe is going into my collection of the best biscotti recipes I've ever tried.  The only change I made was substituting pecans for walnuts.  There ended up being a lot of glaze, so I'll cut down on that next time, as these cookies are excellent on their own.

This is a delicious recipe!  Since I like biscotti fairly dry, I baked the sliced pieces for eight minutes, turned them over, then baked them another eight minutes.  Perfect!  The icing was very good and even better with some added cinnamon!  Yes — I will definitely make this again.   :o)

Delicious recipe, but was so crumbly that i had a hard time keeping it together during slicing after the first bake.  I believe it's the butter, since I never had this problem with biscotti that were made without fat or with olive oil.

Not the first time I've made these. My husband loves them.   I have on occasion added dark chocolate and I always substitute almond extract for the maple extract.

Delicious!  This was my first attempt at making scones, and they turned out perfect.  I used my own maple syrup from our maple trees.  I did flip the scones and bake them for an additional 8 minutes, as others did, to make them more crispy.  They did not get overcooked at all, so I will do that again next time.  I followed the recipe as written otherwise.

Yum!  I made this with pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference) & thought it was great!  No issue with the texture being too crumbly/dry.  Will def make again.

Tasted great with just the right texture. Didn't have maple flavoring so substituted with almond. Still tasted good.

This was my first time making biscotti, and I followed the recipe exactly, except I used pasteurized egg whites instead of eggs.   The biscotti had good maple flavor and a nice crunch.  My family and I loved them!

I enjoyed these cookies, but I added maple extract to the glaze, I love a stronger taste of maple.
