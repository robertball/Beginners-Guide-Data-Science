I recently found this recipe at all recipes.com, and was excited and pleased
to see it, Ive been searching for a good corn dog recipe for years.

  Then I Tried it,what a dissapointment!
the recipe calls for corn flour,and local stores dont sell it (unless they sell it by some other name) so that could be the reason for the poor results. The corn Dogs we made from this recipe were tasteless, and the texture was heavy and tough.

I thought this recipe was going to be good, come on "county fair" quality - it was not.  I found the batter to be too thick and when it fried it was too hard.  I had corn flour in my cupboard, I had it for something else, so I used it, but the amount is so miniscule that I don't even think it would be missed.  I will not keep this recipe.

I used namaste gluten free baking flour mix and it still turned out pretty tasty! I think you can use any gluten free baking flour mix that you have on hand and it will turn out pretty good.

I made these in order to take a picture and it bordered on disaster. The batter was too thick so I thinned it - then the batter was not sticking - so I let it sit to thicken up. BTW - the corn flour that is listed as optional I do believe is corn starch. Maybe I just don't know how to fry corn dogs.

Loved the recipe but I did modify it to my liking by adding some sugar to the batter and once I fried them I let them cool and cut down the middle open faced style and added bacon then chili and topped off with cheese and served with a side of Cole slaw. YUUUMMMYYYY!
