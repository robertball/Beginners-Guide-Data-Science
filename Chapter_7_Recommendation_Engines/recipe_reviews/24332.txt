Very good recipe.  Several reviewers have mentioned having a problem with the skin staying intact after scooping out the flesh.  The answer is very simple.  First, be sure to use baking potatoes, as the recipe states.  These have thicker, less delicate skin than some other varieties.  Second, don't attempt to scoop out all the flesh, down to the skin.  Leave a good 1/4 in. of potato on the skin.  This is the way restaurants do it and generally makes for much better results.

I used very very large russet baking potatoes for this recipe. Perfect.  I also added 4 oz. of cream cheese to this recipe and used packaged Hormel REAL Crumbled Bacon to save time.  I made and stuffed these potatoes in the morning and refrigerated them, then cooked then at 350 for about 35-40 mins.  Sooooo I guess these can be done ahead of time which makes them even better!!  Certainly not a low-fat recipe - especially after I added the cream cheese, but wonderful.  My family and friends loved it. I love the idea that they can be done ahead of time. Hope someone finds this helpful. *******************************
Update:  So here it is 2013! I can’t believe I wrote the above post in 2004.   I’m still making this recipe! I got the “do-ahead” instructions down and thought I should update this post.  
You can make this dish a day or two ahead of time.  Do not bake it.  After topping with bacon and cheese, just cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator.  Remember the directions do not consider the refrigerator factor so it will increase baking  time.  However, to help take it of the refrigerator and let it sit out at room temperature for about one hour or a little longer. This will cut down on baking time. Bake about 1.25 hours but watch them – you want them heated through and the cheese lightly browned.  
Freezing:   Freeze prior to baking.  Tip:  flash freeze them so they’re in individual servings.

I've made these twice and they are always a hit! I read the other reviews and here's what I suggest:
1) I use the largest potatoes I can find. It doesn't matter if you cook them at 350,400 whatever. The point is to cook them until a knife will go easily through them. It usually takes me an hour and a half. I also wrap mine in foil with a teeny bit of butter and salted. 
2) I also mash mine with about 1/2 pkg of cream cheese. I just happen to really like cream cheese. :-)
3) I mix the bacon in the potato mixture. I don't mess with topping it usually. 
4) The easiest way to get the mixture into the shells is to spoon it all into a large Ziploc bag, snip a corner off the bag, and squeeze it into the shells. No mess! 
5) If you're in a hurry, you can also broil the potatoes until the tops start to brown. Quicker than baking.
6) These freeze really well wrapped in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil.

I have been making this same recipe for years with one exception.  I make them with mini red skinned potatoes.  Here's how: cut the mini potatoes in half length-wise, toss in a bowl with a few tablespoons of olive oil to coat and bake them at 425 degrees, cut side down for about 25 minutes.  After they have cooled for about 10 minutes you can scoop out the flesh with a mellon baller.  Then follow the rest of the steps of this recipe.  Using the mini potatoes is faster than larger ones (use as many mini potatoes as you think it would take to equal four large potatoes, usually about 12 for the size I buy)because they bake so fast and they make perfect sized finger foods.  Great for a barbeque when none of the other food requires a fork!  No matter how many of these I make I never have leftovers!

Everyone enjoyed at Christmas dinner.  Tips: Next time, I'd reduce green onions in the stuffing mix and would add a little finely chopped bacon.
How to get perfect potato "shells" - bake potatoes in oven (if you wrap in foil when you bake, don't do so), allow to cool about 10 minutes, and slice in half longwise as recipe suggests. Then, use knife to gentle slice around the edge of the potato as you would when cutting a grapefruit (leave about 1/8 inch of flesh and skin to give the shell some weight). Then, slice the flesh of the potato almost to the bottom in quarters. Use the knife from the center to loosen the quarters from the shell. This should leave you with a firm shell to stuff.

After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to make these potatoes and once I did, I was more than pleased!  Even the pickiest of eaters loved these twice baked potatoes, sour cream and all! I received compliments for three days afterwards.  So simple and fun to make... I made them the day before and threw them in the oven for 35 minutes straight from the fridge (topped with extra cheese of course) and they were perfect!  After initially baking the potatoes I took other's advice and put them in the freezer to cool-and scooping was so easy. Would definitely recommend adding the sour cream a little bit at a time to get the desired texture that you want. I can't wait for another cookout so I can make these wonderful potatoes again!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! Have made these more times over the years than I can count. I use what I need, then freeze the rest in zip-lock freezer bags to have on hand as I need them. SO convenient to have them ready and waiting!  My daughter practically lived on these while she was in college! Only one suggestion: ease up on the milk. Too mushy otherwise.

You can not go wrong with this recipe.  I have used another twice baked potato recipe for a few years now...and this one is really just as good.  The only direction that I have is to follow the recipe exactly...you won't be disappointed.  Thanks for the post.

My husband loves these potatoes and asks for me to make them all the time.  They are really easy.  
You can pretty much change them however you want, although I usually make mine pretty much as the recipe states for a side dish.
I have also replaced the bacon with crab for a main course meal.  They are really good that way too.

These are great, and one of those dishes that if you're going to go through the trouble, you might as well make a huge batch and freeze them. They're a perfect "freezer-to-oven" meal, here's how:
1. I typically triple the recipe, bake the potatoes and stuff them, but do not put them in the oven a second time.
2. Put stuffed potatoes in a single row on a baking sheet and put in the freezer for an hour until solid.
3. Now you can freeze them without having them stick together.
4. Cook frozen, 375 for 45-50 minutes. 
I'm having a baby in two months, and having a lot of these in the freezer ready to cook will make my life so much easier!

For those of you who find the mixture a bit runny, I suggest you hold off on adding the milk until the end, and add just enough to get the right consistancy. Also, I don't cut the potatoes in half. I use 1 potato per person, and cut off the top 1/3, and use only the bottom 2/3. The shell hold up better, and the presentation looks much better. This method also allows you to use smaller potatoes as well.

Delicious!  This was my first time making any kind of twice-baked potato and I was half expecting it to be a messy disaster.  But these turned out perfectly!  I used large russet baking potatoes and did what another reviewer suggested - baked them for an hour at 400 degrees with no foil on my upper oven rack.  About 30 minutes in, I put the bacon on a cookie sheet, placed it on the lower rack and cooked it for about 15 minutes.  Then I pulled it out to let it cool so I could crumble it later.    When creating the filling, I used a melon baller to remove the inner part of the potato.  I also put in a few dashes of both garlic and onion powder.  I first mixed everything but the milk and then added it a little at a time until it reached the consistency I wanted.  I also stirred bacon into the whole filling instead of just sprinkling it on top.  I served these with steak and salad.  My boyfriend ate three and skipped his salad because he didn't want to "waste the room" in his stomach with salad when he could have one of these potatoes instead.  :D

First off...what are people thinking to undercook the potato and then use instant potato to fix it, and then rate it??!!  Obviously, cooking time will vary!  If the potato isn't done...keep cooking it.  Why would anyone bother to rate it when they completely changed the recipe?  

Okay, sorry....now...I gave it 5 stars because it tasted great.  The only thing I changed simply out of preference, is that I used less milk.  I like them a little thicker.  Out of laziness, I didn't use a mixer, and everything still blended nicely with a fork.  The surprising thing is that they taste AMZING the next day.  I didn't think I could make them ahead and have then turn out that good, but they were even better than the night I made them!  Really good recipe.  A definite crowd pleaser.  Thanks so much.

This recipe was a hit at my dinner party and took so much pressure off me by allowing me to make it the day before and just heat it before the dinner.  I used ideas from prior reviews which were really helpful: (1)wash, dry, rub outside of potatoes with oil, then microwave them for about 15 minutes, then bake 50-60 minutes, (2)use fat free sour cream, (3) add 4 oz fat-free or reduced fat cream cheese, (4)use real bacon bits from jar, (5) use reduced fat shredded cheese, (6) roast garlic in oven with potatoes and squeeze into potato mix. I had to heat potatoes for about 45-50 minutes from refrigerated state. Everyone loved them!  YUM!

These were AMAZING. My boyfriend and I made these for the next two days after because they were so good. 
I did cheat a little. I put them in the microwave for 3 minutes first and then was able to have them in the oven for 30 min at 370 instead of an hour. Saved a lot of time and tasted just as good! I do think that next time I make them I will broil them for a couple minutes at the end to get the skins a bit more crispy. Also used chives instead of green onions and yum yum!

Awesome!  I prepared these a couple of days ahead and froze them.  I was so happy because freezing the did not change the taste of the potato.  I made them clear up to the point of stuffing them but did not bake them.  I also added the bacon to the filling mixture.  I placed them on a cookie sheet and froze the until solid.  I then wrapped them in tinfoil, placed in a Ziploc freezer bag and froze until needed.  When I was ready for them, I took off the foil, placed on a cookie sheet and baked at 375 for 55 minutes.  I put the cheese on for the last 10 minutes and topped with extra bacon and green onions when they were done, a huge hit at my house!

I have been making Twice Baked Potatoes this way for years.  Instead of green onions, I grate an onion and use that.  After scooping out the flesh of the potato, I put the skins back into the oven so they dry out a little more.  I usually make 10 baking potatoes, place the ones I'm not using on a cookie sheet and freeze them.  When they are frozen, wrap individually in freezer bags.  They will last about 3 months.  When ready to use, defrost and then bake at 350 until hot.

These are SO good!  I would give them 6 stars if I could!!  These potatoes are the best!  They arent dry like most twice baked potatoes are that I have tried (not that that is a hard one to fix)  I followed the directions to a T and they turned out perfect.  Oh!  I did coat the skins of the potatoes with oil before I baked them to give them a bit of a crispier shell.  These would also make great mashed potatoes and save a bit of time by boiling rather than baking.  Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!

I love this recipe and have cooked it for years (maybe not this one, but my version, which is quite close), the difference I do is adding the cream cheese (my rule of thumb is 1 tablespoon of cream cheese for each potato), but also, after scooping out the flesh, return the skins to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown in the inside, then finish as normal... yummy for the tummy :O)

I love potatoes made like this!! ive been making them for years. the good thing about these is the recipe is totally customizable. my fave combo is chaddar cheese,cheez whiz,butter,garlic,chives,sour cream,bacon and cut up broccoli...mmm.my husband enjoys a "jalepeno popper"version.there really is no wrong way to fill them!
heres a quick tip to SAVE time. take the potato and cut a circular/oval shape in the skin on the top of the raw potato(do not remove this chunk of potato) within the circle, cut deep lines(dont cut thru the bottom of the potato)instead of baking, you can microwave them for 10 mins(give or take depending on # of potatos and size).test for doneness with a fork,if still hard return to microwave for 1-2 mins at a time.after theyre cooked put them in the freezer for 10 mins.once theyre cooled you can scrape the circle of skin off the top with a spoon,and it leaves you with a perfect shaped hole to scoop the potato out. to avoid tearing the skin, leave about 1/4 inch of potato remaining.mix the scooped out potato with the filling, and top with a dab of butter or a slice of real cheddar cheese, bake in the oven at 500(or broil works too) until theyre crispy and brown on top. hope you find this useful!

This is so simple and yet so delicious!  My only change is that I rub olive oil on the outside and sprinkle with course sea salt and cracked black pepper before baking. You can use a little less milk or add a little cream cheese if you are worried about the mixture being too thin, but I have never had any issues.

Soooo good!  Couldn't get enough compliments!  Made a few changes though - cut milk and sour cream in half, and then added a little more milk to get the consistency I wanted. I used a lot more cheddar cheese, used bacon bits instead, mixed bacon+chz into the mixture. THEN topped w/ more chz+bacon. (Not very healthy, I know.)  Very easy to make in advance, fridge it, and then just pop in at whatever temp your oven is at to heat up.  I've done 300 degrees for 40 minutes, 350 for about 30 minutes.  (When previously fridged)

Been making these for years...my mom used to make them when I was a kid, and now I make them for my family.  TIP-if you want to speed up cooking, cook for about 15 mins in microwave and then cook rest of way in 400 degree oven.  You have to cook in oven to be able to have the skins crip and tough enough to withstand scooping and filling!  Also, in a pinch you can always use those Bacos instead of real bacon :-)

Very yummy! A little time consuming, but adds a little something fancy to dinner parties. I'll make these again, but I'll add the bacon into the potatoe mixture rather than as a topping. I had large potatoes and I'll cook them longer next time too.

This is a great tip:  After you scoop out the pulp, return the potato skins to the oven for 10 minutes   The skins  have a crunchier texture and hold their shape - fabulous!!!

To keep the skins from getting hard/chewy and easier to scoop-out I lightly rub conola/olive oil on the potatoes before baking in oven for an hour. Gives the potato skin a crisp, flakey texture

These were an incredible hit and change from our normal side of baked potatoes.  I made extra for a family dinner and expected that my husband and I would have leftovers for our meal the following night.  Little did I know...  Even the most picky eater of my inlaws enjoyed these!  I too used real bacon bits and used chives rather than the green onion (I had a lot of cooking/chopping for the rest of the meal).  I added a dash of paprika to the top of each and a small dab of margerine which kept the top moist while browning.

My son is on his 4th half...he loves them.  I personally thought that they were a bit runny, so next time I will cut the milk down a little, but I still enjoyed them none the less.  I used my melon baller to scoop out the potato and that worked great for me.  Thanks Debra!

Great recipe. I have made these for years, using evaporated milk or buttermilk, garlic powder, mayo and sour cream, chives, real butter then scooping them out and leave about 1/4 inch on the skins for support as you refill. Then I top with cheese and paprika. I wrap them individually and freeze or vaccum pack them for future use. I do a whole 5 lb. bag at once. All you have to do is thaw them a little and heat up in the toaster oven or oven. Great to have on hand. Thanks, Chef Nell

Easier/Faster Version!! Bake your potatoes at 500 degrees for one hour
When done and waiting to cool a tad bit 
Scoop a bunch of shredded cheese, real bacon bits (from a jar lol), chives, a big dollop of butter, and sour cream mixed with some Hidden Valley Ranch Dip packet into a large (gallon) zip lock bag.
Cut your potatoes in half long ways
and scoop out the center being careful not to tear the potato skins.
Mix into the baggie with all of your fixins and add a little heavy whipping cream. All you have to do is squish the bag untill all of your lumps are gone! Then cut one corner off the baggie and twist into pastry bag shape and squeeze into your hollow potato skins.
Bake for another 20 minutes (or untill lightly golden on top) at 350 degrees.
Done and YUMMMMM!!!!

This was easy and delicious. I used it as my main course with a side salad. I didn't have to use a hand mixer. I just used a regular potato masher and it came out smooth and creamy. I also used low fat sour cream because that's what I had, and it came out fine. Also, I only had 5 green onions and that seemed like enough. Thank you for sharing!

I'm giving this only 5 stars because I have no way of giving it more!!! Absolutely delicious! A bit sinful, yes. But hey, everything in moderation, right? Serve these for a special occasion and sit back and enjoy all the compliments you'll get. They were a bit labor intensive, but WOW-WEE-KA-ZOW-WEE, were they ever tasty! Change up the cheese any way you like... its all good! I used a blend of part mild cheddar, sharp cheddar and freshly grated Parmesan. But you really just have to follow this one as it's written and you can't go wrong!

Made these with steak tonight!  Wow!  I didn't have as much cheese on hand as I thought I did, so I only sprinkled it on top.  Also, instead of baking the potatoes in the oven for 1 hour, I microwaved them for 13 minutes.  Cut cooking time in half.  Still used the oven for the final bake.  Will be making these again and again!

This is a really great recipe for restaurant style twice baked potatoes.  Be aware that YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR PERSONAL JUDGEMENT ON THE MEASUREMENTS OF INGREDIENTS based on the size of your potatoes.  Every time you buy potatoes, they will be different sizes (even potatoes in the same bag are different).  I try to buy the very large "baker" Russet potatoes (many grocery stores put two or four in a wrapped container and label them "bakers"), but the 5 or 10 lb bagged Russets will work just as well.  If your potatoes are small, you can always use 6 or 8 potatoes instead of 4 - believe me, they will be eaten!

When adding the liquid/soft ingredients, do NOT dump the entire amounts in all at once.  Only add half, then mix with potatoes and add more if needed to get the correct consistency.  If your potatoes are on the small side, and you add the full amount of soft/liquid ingredients, you will end up with a runny soup.

When scooping out the insides, I use a spoon, and after the first large scoop, I just scoop a LITTLE at a time to make sure I don't tear the potato.  You can always take a little more potato out if you go slow.

Some people have complained the recipe is too bland.  I add about a teaspoon of garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the mashed potato mix, and I sprinkle some paprika on the top with the green onions.  I also add salt and pepper to taste (usually 1 - 1 1/2 teaspoons of each).

All and all, this is a great basic recipe that's easy to customize!

Delicious! I did bake my bacon for 17 minutes on 375 to make it easier. Also instead of milk I added about 3 ounces of cream cheese. Also added garlic powder and more cheese just used the cup in the mix and topped with more cheese. I coudnt wait for the leftovers the next day!

I love these potatoes.  I never have much time, so put my potatoes on the microwave until done.  Scoop the potatoe out to prepare the filling.  Wnen I put them into the oven to finish them I bake them for about 1/2 hour on 350.  The skins crisp up wonderfully and you can't tell they were micorwaved to start with.

Comfort food crowd pleaser.  Can't go wrong.  I've made these several times and agree with others that making the filling up ahead of time makes them taste better, and it makes it easier on you if this is part of a large feed.  I also doubled the bacon.  I put 8 slices in with the filling, and then 8 slices on top.  I also added garlic powder to the filling.  If you use large baking potatoes, its going to take more like 1 15 min to 1 30 min till they are done.  Also, rub the taters in oil and wrap in foil for baking.  Don't get greedy and try to get every little ounce of tater flesh out of the skin.  Leave some around edges.  Otherwise, your taters will fall apart and not be able to stand up the chunky yummy filling.  Sometimes I use the small red potatoes which is nice because lighter eaters aren't too intimidated to put one on their plate.  If you use large bakers, the portions are just huge.

WOW, what a great make ahead recipe!  We had a pumpkin carving party last night and on Fri. night I actually baked and mixed then restuffed the potatoes - covered them in the fridge then baked them at 300* for 35 minutes to reheat and melt the cheese.  Instead of using LARGE baking potatoes I used medium Idaho potatoes and they were enjoyed by all!  Thanks for a great recipe!

it would have been nice if the recipe actually said to bake the potato is soft and a toothpick could easily slice through it.  i baked it according to directions and got lumps of hard potatos but since i had already sliced them up, i couldnt just put them back into the oven.  not to mention i had also turned off my oven for the 10min cooling period and would have to wait for it to reheat again.

These were good. I read a lot of the reviews and have the following tips: based on the size of your potatoes you will have to adjust the amount of milk, sour cream etc that you will need to use, so that the potatoes are not too thin. You are basically making mashed potatoes so you have to do it to taste and not follow the recipe so literally in terms of amounts to use. I used a melon baller to scoop out my potatoes and this helped to keep the potatoes in tact.  Also, I tried to make these a little healthier by: using low fat sour cream, non fat 1/2 and 1/2, turkey bacon and using less cheese than called for. I also greatly reduced the green onions and didnt include them in my stuffing but sprinked them sparinly on top.

Made these for Thanksgiving and what a hit.  I microwaved the baking potatoes to save some time and then mashed the potatoes with all the ingredients minus the onions(taste preference not to have them)and a little more butter then suggested and a little less sour cream. Then I topped with bacon.  I made them the day before and heated at 350 covered for 30 minutes and topped with extra cheese and cooked uncovered for five more minutes.  Absoulutely delicious and still just as tasty reheated two days later.

The texture on this was great, not too thick or too thin. ( I didnt use quite 1/2c milk) I also add some sauted green peppers which gave the mixture a nice flavor. Everyone loved them, I'll be adding this one to my list of favorite side dishes.

Great recipe!  I spray the potatoes with Canola then sprinkle a litte salt on the skins.  I make mine ahead of time, so double up on the recipe and put the finished filled potatoes on a cookie in the freezer over night, then I wrap each one in plastic wrap and put them in a gallon freezer bag to be used later.  They are great to use as a side during the summer when you don't want to heat up the kitchen and can be put on the grill to warm up along with your chops, steak, etc!

Excellent!  Smooth and creamy, and so easy.  (The cooking time for a large baking potato in my oven at 350 is 1.5 hours.  The first time I made this, I baked them for only an hour and they were not done and the end result wasn't as good.  But with an hour and a half, they came out perfect!)  Also, in later tries (because of not having some ingredients) my custom version tasted even better.

These potatoes are awesome.  I made a whole bunch of them and put them in the freezer.  They are great for busy night dinners.  The kids love them.

These really are excellent.  I've found that using a melon baller makes easy work of scooping out the potato without damaging the skins.  I use less milk than called for, as it gets too mushy.  These are requested often by my family!

WOW! Easy & delicious. What more could you ask for? I made the the day before & just poped them in a preheated 350 oven for about 45 minutes to an hour. Everyone loved them.

UGH!!! YUM!  make them with regular onion and garlic.  basically throw anything you want in them... plus some cheese.  Makes wonderful potatoes... just remember when scooping out the flesh it doesn't matter what potato you use just leave a small amount of flesh around the edge of the potato so they hold together.  Oh ya and I cover my potatoes in olive oil and montreal steak seasoning before their first bake in the oven.  Fantastic!

Delish! I also made them before hand and put them in the fridge (before cooking the second time). I just threw them back in for 35 min to heat... everyone loved them!!

These are soooo good, my finace gets all giddy whenever I make these! When I'm trying to get something other than beer & red meat into him, I also add some tuna in there - it might sound wierd, but it tastes great! I also found that brushing the potatoes with a little olive oil and then sprinkling a bit of salt, pepper or other seasoning on them (rosemary works well) before baking makes for a really crisp, savory skin that is a little easier to scoop out. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were absolutely fantastic!  My fiance and I ate them for dinner last night.  We also cooked hamburger steak with onions and gravy also from this site, and they both turned out wonderfully!  The only change I made was I mixed the bacon and chives with the potatoes, and I baked all at once. (This is the 15 minute baking time).  One more quick note, the time was off a bit.  I had to bake the potatoes for an hour and 20 minutes, and then I still had to put the potatoes in the mocrowave for two additional minutes.  That would be the only complaint I would have, although, everyone should try these atleast once!  I will surely be making these again... thank you so much for the recipe!!!

My Husbands 'SECRET  INGREDIENT' that is missing from this recipe is...grated Horseradish.  Add at least 1 teaspoon while whipping the pototoes and taste...you may want to add just a little more.
The flavors really pop with this little addition.Now you have 'Grandpa's Special Potatoes'.

OH MY!  These potatoes tasted SO good.  They went so well with a barbeque meal.  I know I'll be making them for years to come.

You might want to leave a little bit of potato (small amount) on the skins when you are scooping so that they don't collapse when you fill and re-bake them later.

Thanks for an amazing recipe!

These were pretty good.  I omitted the bacon since I don't eat it.  I think next time I would reduce the sour cream as it was a bit much for me.  I also would add some black olives - my mom used to make twice baked potatoes with black olives and cheddar and they were to die for.  I think this recipe is a good base that can be added to or altered to suit you.

These potatoes are fantastic!  I have made them according to the recipe, which in my opinion is still a 4-5 star recipe.  However, instead of sour cream, I stumbled across using 0% fat plain greek yogurt (which is thick and adds a really nice tangy flavour to the potatoes) one day when I had run out of sour cream.  The yogurt replacement has become our standard now!  I also usually add only 2 tbsp of butter and also add in 1-2 tbsp of minced, dried onion to the mashed potato filling (because my hubby can't eat green onions).  Chicken bacon (instead of regular bacon) is also good on top of the potatoes.  However, we have had it regular bacon, too, and both ways makes for an extremely yummy potato!  Thanks ponygirl!

I made these for my hubby for Valentine's day... and they were wonderful!  I added 4 oz. of cream cheese to the mixture and I had a little mixture left over because I didn't want to overpower the potatoes.  I will definitely make them again.  Also, I just put the bacon on the top and I did not mix it in... I will not do that next time.  It didn't really give the potatoes that good bacon flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

These were the best twice baked potatoes I have ever had. I did not have bacon and only had freeze dried green onions. Mixed them and some freeze dried chives with the sour cream and put in fridge while potatoes baked. Omitted additional salt since the butter & cheese had salt in it. Didn't even need to use mixer, just mixed everything together with a fork and they were awesome.

I scaled this recipe to just two servings and used about a 14 oz. potato, which I thought was large.  Well, I guess not, because the amount of sour cream and milk called for made these way too loose and I didn’t even use the entire amount of either.  Next time I would cut those back to at least half and add more cautiously.  I love twice baked potatoes, so I will try these again, and I may increase the butter a bit.

My 11yr grandaughter made these on Christmas.. with no help, just a recipe..  they were amazing.  She had little dishes of extra toppings ... french fried onion  rings, various cheeses, olives, mushrooms.. bacon bits and a few other inventive ideas like chocolate chips and mini marsmellows that not everyone tried..

Very Very good.   I love these as written but the calories just were too much for my waistline.  I cut the sour cream, butter and cheese in half and added chicken boullion.  For greens I chopped the green onions very very small then added chopped broccoli flowers. I like to prepare these the night before they seem to marinate with time and just taste much better.  Place the cheese is on the top so it browns when broiled.

Fantastic!  Will try adding onion powder next time as well as the green onions.  Made them the day before the party and reheated wrapped in foil on the bbq and put under broil for a few minutes with the crispy bacon and additional cheese.  Froze the left over mashed and left over potatoes and will have our side dish for another meal sometime next week.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I have been making these delicious twice baked taters for years! I do a few things different though, I bake my potatoes without the foil on 400 degrees for about an hour, this causes the skin to harden and makes it easier to scoop all of the potato out and makes a nice secure boat to put ingredients back in. I also don't use any milk and add some season salt as well. My family would eat these every night if I made them! They are the best.

Mmmm...I love twice baked potatoes and this recipe was perfect. Only thing I changed was leaving out the onions because husband does not like them. This is one of my favorite side dishes. They taste great reheated too! Thanks.

We had these tonight and they were very good!  I used bacon bits and a regular onion just because that's what we had on hand.  The only thing I would do differently next time is broil them on low for the last few minutes so the top gets a little crispy.  We will definitely be making these again!

Very good made with out bacon and with added garlic - fresh minced or powder, and a dash of soysauce. Be sure to use russet (baking) potatoes. Baked without foil is best for drier, crisper skin that holds together. Great side dish, or vegetarian entree depending on whatelse is served.

Worth the effort.  Top notch recipe.  Always make more, they freeze and reconstitute just fine.  It's no more effort to make six potatoes than it is to do 4.  Great for company.

Now I know why this recipe was called the "ultimate".  It tastes like a fully loaded baked potato that you could get in a restaurant.  I mixed extra cheddar cheese in with the potato mixture and added some sauteed onions.  This was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!

These potatoes are wonderful!!  I served them with Aussie Chicken (from this site) and got rave reviews!  I made them the night before and brought them to room temperature before I baked them.  The leftovers were just as good warmed up.

I have made these numerous times, and they always turn out perfect! I get so many requests for these potatoes that I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore...I know it by heart! I read some reviews where the readers say the potatoes are runny. This has never happened to me before, but I can only think of two things to suggest. First, use Yukon Gold baking potatoes. They are meater and hold there substance better than others. And second, I always make these ahead of time and place them in the refrigerator until I am ready to bake them for the addtional 15 minutes. This may help keep them from being too runny. All I can say is bake and enjoy!

Great recipe! I skipped milk and butter and they got me raving comments. Be very careful when scooping out the flesh, the skin tears very easily.

I make these every time I make a ham dinner and the are absolutely wonderful.  I bake the potatoes early in the day, allow them to cool and then mix the filling together and re-fill the potatoes.  Then when I am preparing dinner I don't have to worry about fixing them, I just put them in the oven for the last half hour of whatever else I am cooking.  They always come out wonderfully.

Excellent recipe. I rubbed the skins with a little olive oil and sprinkled with coarse salt before placing directly on the oven racks. Makes the skins even yummier.

The BEST Debra! The only thing I did differently was to add some garlic and onion powders and some chopped green pepper. I didn't measure out the sour cream, but added it to the mixture until I was happy with the consistency. Loved by all!

These are SOOOOO good. Whatever you do do not omit the bacon or use imitation. I mixed some of the bacon and green onions in the filling.  I also used a melon baller to get the flesh out easier.  This is definatly going into my favorites file.

I used a bit less onion than called for. Did the potatoes once in the oven once in the microwave. Oven left the skins with more "structural integrity".

I don’t know what this recipe means with “baking potatoes” but potatoes have to be cooked in boiling water or rinsed to get the starch out. I baked them for an hour and it was almost impossible to mash them, had to microwave them it was a sad mess! I had to take them to a dinner party where everybody said they were “OK” I wasn’t mad but I always like my food “AMAZING”. Bad experience…

I made this w/ red potatoes , that was all I had so I baked 2 of them took filling out of both put in bowl.. Kept the shell of the larger red potaoes. I had to use bacon bits because I was out of bacon.. I used Wisconsin Extra Sharp White Cheddar cheese & diced up couple slices of yellow onion.. got my blender out mixed everything together.. OMG you can lick the blender handles I filled back up the potato shell it over flowed some so I wrapped extra aluminum foil to support hold the extra filling... WHEN IT WAS DONE, THE BEST BAKED POTATO I ever had.. I didnt ad topping at all except the butter because I forgot to mix it in. If  you like potatoes this is the best way to eat them.. Hell you actually can make bake a lot of potatoes & blend together make this into a cassarole soufle.

Wow! The only thing I did differently was put some finely diced garlic in but other than that is was perfect! I also Roast my potatoes at 350 for one hour after i lather them in EVOO and Kosher salt. Do not wrap in foil. Just poke some holes in the spud with a fork(about 8-10 times, all around) then the oil and salt. Throw right on a rack in your oven towards the top and cook for 1 hour. Perfect every time and that way you have a great seasoned skin that you can eat as well. I also did not use bacon. Didn't need it.

Too runny! Added a lil garlic for more flavor. Next time I'll use less milk and not whip them as much (whipping might have contributed to the funniness). I tested this recipe the day before serving to my guests, thank goodness! Great flavor with the garlic but I had to spend a lot of time simmering and stirring on low to remove the excess moisture.

My family loves this recipe. I like to add a package of Hidden Valley ranch dressing mix and shredded parmesean cheese. Sometimes, I add ham instead of bacon.

You can totally cut calories on this one by using fat free dairy products. I used greek yogurt, I can't believe it's not butter, reduced fat cheese, and fat free half and half. I couldn't taste the difference but i never use full fat dairy prodeucts. 
I also froze the potato halfs and reheated them in the microwave followed by a quick broil. THey turned out great!

Delicious! My kids and I really enjoy potatoes prepared this way. When I don't feel like stuffing the skins I simply put the mashed potatoes (with all the fixin') in a baking dish and bake it all together that second time around. Perfect!!

OH MY GOSHHH! Honestly, a really great recipe. Just made it for my boyfriend and I. I served it with ribeye steaks and ceasar salad. As a college student, I enjoy thinking outside of the box and refraining from eating ramen every night or going to chipotle so this was a great change. I tweaked the recipe just a little but no major changes. I halved the recipe because there was only two of us and it was more than enough. I rubbed the potatoes with olive oil and salt and then microwaved them for three minutes to cut on time. It only took thirty minutes in the oven. I cut back on the sour cream and the green onions and mixed some of the bacon in before rebaking. Turned out AMAZING. My boyfriend is a really picky eater and he loved it. His exact words "I guess I like potatoes now?" But then again when steak is the main dish he thinks everything else on the table is gold.

Wonderful! Just don't add so much milk. I'd suggest only adding a little bit of milk as you mix. You're going to find that the butter and the sour cream make it creamy enough and if you were to actually add all the milk the recipe calls for you'll have a too runny mixture. I skipped adding the bacon and didn't have green onions but found adding some onion powder was just as tastey. This is the 2nd time I've made these in the last month. They also freeze up well. I wrap in plastic wrap and then put in a freezer bag. Easy to pull out and microwave for a quick side later on.

These were a great way to change up our usual mashed-potatoes-or-potato-wedges rut.  I did sub cream cheese (4 oz) for the sour cream and also added a sprinkling of dry Ranch Dressing mix (maybe 1/4 packet).  I also didn't have green onions or bacon, but they tasted great anyway!  Could easily be pre-assembled, frozen, and baked the second time later.

Great recipe. I have made it for several years. Recently my husband helped hollow out the potatoes. A few shells were destroyed, so we improvised and made "Twice Baked Potato Casserole." We just mixed all the ingredients together as directed, but poured the mixture into a baking pan (that was lightly greased with Pam), and topped it with cheese. I baked it the same. It was GREAT and much easier. I will be fixing it this way from now on. I am very happy my husband "helped." :)

I have been making these for years, I suggest that you do not wrap your potatoes in foil instead put them on a metal skewer ( more than 1 potatoe on each), then put them in the oven.  They will cook faster and the skins will be easier to handle. I use fat free sour cream, low fat cheese, and only add the milk if I need them thinner.  If you like Jalapeno peppers you can chopper them up and add to mixture, or just add them to the top before cooking.  These are a favorite in my house, I always make extras so when someone wants a snack they just grab one and pop it in the microwave.  (You can also add a little garlic and herbs the them, add just about anything you like and they are great)

I have been making my twice baked potatoes with these same ingrediants for years (although I just eye ball the ingrediants) and they are a hit.  A tip for spooning out the potato flesh... Hold the halved potato in your palm using a pot holder or folded towel to protect your hand from being burned.  Gently scoop out the flesh with a teaspoon being careful not to scoop too deep and tear the skin.

I didn't have any bacon, so I omitted that.  I replaced the sour cream with plain yogurt (standard in our house).  These are AMAZING!  Definitely going into the rotation.  I was short on time, so I cooked them in the microwave first and twice-baked them in the oven after; they needed to go more like 45 minutes in the oven, but that may have been because the yogurt is a little soupier than sour cream is.  These are way better than anything in the restaurants even with the shortcuts, substitutions, and omissions.  Thanks for submitting such a WONDERFUL recipe!

These were very good but I would use 1/2 c. sour cream next time for the filling, as I found the flavor too overpowering. They are time consuming but worth it.
I made these a second time without sour cream in the filling at all. I only had enough cheese for the top, so I put some jarred cheese whiz in the filling. This was very good and a big hit at a party.

Really good! I was short on time so I microwaved my potatoes until just soft and let them sit about 10 minutes before I cut them, then followed directions-reheating in the microwave again rather than the oven. It worked just fine! I did find them to be just a tiny bit too wet-I will cut down a couple tablespoons of milk next time.

I had trouble keeping the skins in one piece so I just made a "bed" of skins on a baking sheet and spooned the mixture onto that. Not bad. It is a very rich recipe, so I won't be making it often, but I liked it very much!

Less would be more!  These had way too much butter, sour cream, bacon, onions, and cheese!  The only thing I changed with the recipe was I cut the milk back to 1/4 cup and then added another tbsp after it was all mixed.  Judging on the consistency, I would not add that extra tbsp and stick to the 1/4 c.  The other thing I changed, was I brushed on olive oil and sprinkled coarse salt on the potatoes skins before putting on cookie sheet to bake.  My potatoes did cook perfectly after 60 minutes.  My skins were soft.  I carefully scooped out flesh (leaving a good 1/4 inch on skin) and they stayed intact.  Next time I make these, I will probably cut everything back (except potatoes) to 3/4 the amount and then go from there.

These are very good, I like that you don't have to mash them instead you just used the mixer.   I used precooked bacon instead of cooking my own and it sped up the cooking process and still tasted great!

I made these over the weekend and they were delicious!!! I only had red potatos, they were still good, but the skin did not get crispy. I'll make sure to use a different kind of potato next time. I also used an ice cream scooper to remove the potatos from the skin and to put the mix back in, I thought it worked really well. They were still just as good the next day after we heated them up in the oven.

These came out pretty good...a little too much sour cream..next time i'll cut it down to 1/2 or 3/4 cup.  The 1 cup seemed to overwhelm the flavor a bit..and I used 5 large baking potatoes.  Other than that, they were a huge hit.  My husband has already asked when I'll be serving them again!

Great recipe. I love these! Getting the scooping down is the hardest thing. Try and leave a 1/4 of an inch around the skin to give these some stability. I always like to bake 1 additional potato to add to the filling so there is enough and in case something happens to one of the the potato skins.

I make these all the time with the following options to slim them down and speed them up: 1) I cook my potatoes in the microwave until almost done, then remove and wrap in a kitchen towel to let them steam the rest of the way.  I also cook one additional potato (usually a smaller one) in order to have a nice heaping serving.  2)  I saute medium diced onion and peppers (orange, yellow red are pretty) in a little olive oil to start and then chicken broth to finish up (cook till almost dry). 3)  I add dill, basil, oregano (whichever you prefer best) to the onion mixture as it sautes.  4)  I add half a package of lipton onion soup mix to the potato mixture. 5)  I use low fat sour cream and enough butter to make it taste yummy. 6)  I use the precooked bacon that has been crisped up in the microwave. 7)  I don't usually need milk because of the wetness of the sauteed veggies.  8)  And the cheese and green onions put them over the top.  They can be very fast with these shortcuts and always a hit.

I have been making this for years and it is always a hit.  I microwave the spuds, cut in half, & remove the "meat". I spread butter in the potato halfs & crisp in the toaster oven or oven.  This makes for a nice crispy skin. While the spuds are in the oven I mix the "meat" & all the other yummy ingredients.  When spuds are crisp I fill the spuds, top with cheese & back and broil.  I cannot wait to have these on Friday.  Happy Holidays everyone.

I have been making 2X baked for years, without a recipe. This recipe had all of the same ingredients I use, so decided to give it a try.  This recipe had all of the right measurements. I usually throw  the ingredients into a bowl and make adjustments as I go. Measurements made the process much faster.  I use light sour cream and 2% cheddar for the potato mixture and the fattening stuff on top because 2% doesn't melt the same. I use the bacon peices Costo sells in a bag and crisp them in the microwave on a paper towel (we like our bacon crspy).  *Note* 1/2 cup bacon bits = 8 slices fried bacon.   I tripled the recipe and will put them in the freezer. Twice baked freeze great. My huband and daughter, that have a both have gift of never gaining weight, will snack on them daily until gone. I will need to practice a lot of restraint.

I've made these several times, what makes them ideal is the fact you can make them the day(s) before your going to use them.   Set them out for a few hours to come to room temp. then bake till they bubble.......they are delicious with NO change in flavor!!!!

I cooked this for my boyfriend and I and it was very delicious. I rolled the potatoes in oil and sprinkled with salt before I baked them and I also added about 4oz of softened cream cheese to my filling. It turned out great. The only thing I would change is possibly adding a little less milk.=)

To crisp the potato skins, rub the skins with butter or olive oil. For added flavor, sprinkle garlic salt or powder over the skins. Flip over and begin stuffing.

OMG.......never had twice baked taters before and wanted something a little different tonite. i came upon this recipe and i had everything but scallions, so i caramelized a yellow onion and folded it into the mixture. i also folded in the crispy bacon. i didn't really measure the milk and sour cream. i eyeballed it, used what i would use to make my mashed taters. i only had two russets so i didn't need full amts as what the recipe called for. these were by far THE MOST YUMMY TATERS i have ever had! Will def make these again...and again!  Thanks for sharing ponygirl64.

This is an excellent basic recipe.  Toppings could also be varied by using fried onions and mushrooms, brocolli etc.  Also the flavor could be changed up with different cheeses. The possibilites are endless.  I did not use the milk and added the sour cream, butter, salt and pepper to taste.  Mashing was done with a hand masher rather than a mixer and I folded in the green onions, bacon and cheese before filling the potato shells.

Very tasty, yet very traditional tasting. I used bacos, and bottled chives because I was in a pinch. I also decided to roast a head of garlic and squeeze it in for flavor after reading some other recipes/reviews. I may use a more exotic cheese next time and try sauteing some of the ingredients next time. This was the first time I have ever made these so this was a great starter recipe.. really these are sort of fool proof and you can probably modify to your taste buds. (Broccolli, garlic, ham, cheese, whatever sounds yum!)

These were very good. I did everything the day before except for baking.  Then about 30 minutes before dinner I took them from the fridge and baked them.  Baking time was a little longer since mine were cold from the fridge.  Thanks

I remember having potatoes similar to these on my honeymoon in Mexico 10 yrs. ago. The only difference is that they used Oaxaca cheese with cheddar. Oaxaca cheese is similar to mozzarella cheese, but have a much better flavor. I truly recommend them with this type cheese, which can be found in any supermarket in the cheese section.

Instead of baking the potatoes, I poke holes into the potatoes and stick them in the microwave instead. Cuts down on time and the potatoes come out just fine. Also, I broil the potatoes for the last 5 minutes they're in the oven, makes the cheese nice and bubbly.  Topped off with chives instead of green onions. Delicious.

Not too difficult, and very good. I didn't like the green onions so much - something about the crunchiness. Maybe I'll try chives nest time. Update: Made again with chives this time and they are now 5 star in my opinion. A great side dish, and can be at least partly made ahead of time. Thanks!

I baked my potatoes at 375 degrees for 1 hour and they were ready by then.  They were medium to big size potatoes. I also threw in 2 garlic cloves and baked them for the length of the potatoes and mixed them in with the other ingredients to give it a garlicky taste. I brushed the potatoes with olive oil and sea salt to give the skin some flavor.  Everything turned out delicious!!

i made these for dinner tonight.  I didn't have big baking potatoes, so i used idahos.  They were kinda - bite sized.  They were delicious.  My fiances cousin was over for dinner, so i made a ton.  There still were no leftovers.  They liked them so much, they were gone before the main dish.  We'll definately make them again.

Fantastic! These were better than you'd get in any restaurant. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and omitted the milk completely and mine were just the right consistency. A great side dish to Cornish hens and a recipe I'll be keeping around - thanks!

These potatoes have become a holiday tradition around our home. I have found that the following substitutions produce the same oohs and ahs at the table, with less guilt: use low-fat shredded cheddar cheese, use 1/2 non-fat plain yogurt and 1/2 low-fat sour cream in place of the 1 cup of regular sour cream, use half the bacon (the flavor is still there!) 

I also use 1/2 chives and 1/2 green onions for a nice flavor addition.

Enjoy!

GREAT recipe!  So easy and satisfying.  I made them up the night before (reserving the final baking step until the day of).  I took them out of the refrigerator about an hour before so they weren't cold when I put them in the oven.  They came out perfect and were a bit hit.  This would make a great potato salad too -- I'll be trying that in the summertime.

the potatoes were just as good without the 1 cup of sour cream.  (i was scared of it being too soupy.)  instead, i just used it to top the potato off.  1hr baking time didn't get the potatoes as soft as i would've liked.  next time, i'm going to try microwaving it for a bit first.  also, i used real bacon bits to eliminate one whole step.  yum!

Delicious!I tweaked the recipe a bit-baked the potatoes brushed with oil, salt, pepper, this made the skin quite crispy.Added fresh parsley, chives, mint, diced mushrooms, juice of one lemon, 1/4 cup sour cream, salt, pepper, 1 cup cheese, 1/4 cup milk, butter to mashed potato then put all back into shells, topped with extra parsley, chives, paprika and cheese and rebaked.  I am a vegetarian so didn't use ham.  It was still a big hit with the meat-eaters :-)

The BEST twice baked potatoes!  My dad is a very picky eater and he always requests these when he's coming over.  As a short cut to frying the bacon, I buy the prepackaged crumbled bacon (in the salad dressing aisle).  It tastes the same and makes it faster to prep.  These are also easy to make before company comes...then just pop them in the oven to warm them when you are ready.

great potato recipe!  i baked an extra potato so that i'd have extra filling.  do watch the amount of milk.  mine seemed dry before re-baking it, but once out of the oven the filling was a tiny bit runny.  it was still delicious, though.

I made these for my husband...they are a little work but well worth it.  He loved them!  I omitted the milk altogether and they came out nice and creamy.  I did make the mistake of letting the potatoes cool way down, which made them harder to handle.  in spite of my mistake they tasted wonderful!  5 Stars!

Good Basic recipe.  I make these frequently.  I do not add the milk, instead I use some ranch dressing in with butter & sour cream which adds a great flavor...

I have to agree with some of the other reviewer's that the potato is kind of liquidy with the addition of milk,sour cream and butter. Take note on the size of potatoes you are using. I suggest omitting the milk. However, I liked them, the sour cream and cheese was very tasty.

Great recipe!! I followed this recipe to the exact ingredient and they turned out great. If you use a large enough size baking potato it will not be soupy and if you bake your potatoes unwrapped on the oven rack the skin will be tough enough to scoop the pulp out. Be sure you pierce the potato with a fork or sharp knife or it will explode in the oven. I know from experience. LOL These potatoes are better than any twice baked potato I have had in any restaurant.

Yum! A big hit with my grilled steak dinner. I followed a friend's advice and popped the hot potatoes in the freezer for about 30 minutes, then used an ice cream scoop to scoop them out. Minimum effort, maximum compliments.

Oh my goodness!  This recipe is an absolute favorite of our family.  I've made it numerous times and it's always well received.  The only thing that I sometimes do differently, is adding 1/2 the cheese and bacon for the filling, instead of the 1/2 cheese and onions.  I find that the green onions don't always taste that good when reheated (I always make tons for leftovers).

I guess I will be the only one NOT to give this recipe an enthusiastic review. To me, there was just too much butter, sour cream etc. and too little potato. I might try it again and reduce all ingredients accept the potatoes.

I made this as a cassarole for Christmas.  I made it up the night before, put it in a 2 quart cassarole dish, refrigerated it  and then baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes on Christmas Day.  It was very tasty and may have been even better if I had waited and put the  bacon in at the last minute,

The only reason I gave this recipe high marks is because I had to "fix" it and then it was great.  Unfortunately, the "large" potatoes I cooked for 1 hr at 350 degrees were way underdone.  I guess it was my fault for not checking their doneness before I cut them in half.   1 hr at 400 or 425 degrees was needed.  The author must have used much smaller potatoes than mine.  Other recipes for twice baked potatoes call for either 1 or 1-1/2 hr at the higher temperature.

This is one of my favorite comfort foods. I took off a star because when I measure according to the recipe, the mixture is too runny for my tastes. I cut down on the sour cream. 

This freezes well, too. After refilling the potato skins, I put the potatoes on a baking sheet in the freezer until they're solid, then I wrap them in foil and package in a gallon-sized ziplock bag. Then I thaw as many as I want and bake once thawed.

These are so easy to make and even better--make a bunch, individually wrap in plastic wrap & these will keep in the freezer for months--that way I just need to pop out how many I need for dinner and heat up. Delightful dish!

This was my first time making these, I always add or subtract a little to my liking and consistency; I forgot to buy green onions, so we did without it. I made them the night before Easter, I was feeding 10 people and had no room in my fridge to keep them overnight so I baked the potatoes and scooped out the middle and put it in a covered bowl, then covered the hollowed potatoes as well and left everything on the counter overnight without adding any of the dairy products that would spoil. I warmed the flesh the next day in the microwave, heated the milk and added all other ingredients. I used a pastry pouch with a decorating tip to make them a little more fancy, then put them in the oven while the meat was resting on the counter. They were a hit!

well... I don't know what the deal is but a potato never gets done in one hour at 350. Unless they are really small ones. I bake them at 400 or even 450 for an hour. Also: I don't use a hand mixer for potatoes: they can end up with a glue-like consistency. Read a good cookbook like Joy of Cooking and they will validate this. Use a good old potato masher and the potatoes come out the perfect consistency.

Finally a recipe all the kids agreed was great!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used an extra potato since I thought mine were not super big.  Next time I will season the skins with salt and pepper before adding the filling as it was a little bland once you ate past the filling.

It could be a 5 star by changing the following things:

1. Switching out milk for evaporated milk. This changes the consistency to more creamy and less watery. 
2. Try mixing 4 tbs Ranch dressing (or to taste) for added sweet flavor- so delicious!

My mother n'law famously makes these with the evaporated milk and ranch dressing. It's always a hit at every party and people- EVERYONE- loves them.

I only scaled it down(still too much for 2 people, gotta remember not cooking for 6 now!) and left out green onions just because i didn't have any. A+ to go with a steak :)

Another idea for the potato skin staying intact, in addition to using baking potatoes, grease the potatoes with a little shortening (I also add a little kosher salt on top of the shortening). The potato skin will be nice and crisp when done baking and the potato flesh will be much easier to scoop out.

Very good. Made just a couple of adjustments for a firmer filling with a touch more flavor: cut the sour cream in half, added 1/2 cup cream cheese, add milk to desired texture, and added garlic salt, white pepper, onion powder, and about a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. Yum!

These are the best potatoes, my entire family loved them. I was in a hurry so I microwaved my potatoes, and used the real bacon bacon bits. I saved this recipe to my recipe box.

This is DELICIOUS! The 2nd time I made it, I put it all in a casserole dish instead of the skins and it was awesome. Just a different version of a great potato dish :)

I use dairy chip dip (sour cream and onions) when I make twice baked potatoes, much simplier than these featured. This sounds like too much bacon and sour cream.

Delicious. I didn't have sour cream so I used philadelphia garlic and herb cream cheese spread that was really good. There was no left overs. I'll def make this again and use the garlic and herb spread. I think that is perfect for this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I made these for a party and made a lot thinking I'd have leftovers to enjoy if anything. WELL! They were all gobbled up! Definitely a keeper! I assembled them the day before and this made what could have been a hectic day in the kitchen much easier!

Unbelievable! Added 3oz cream cheese and used only 2 T. Milk.  Plenty moist, but didn't get runny.  Also added diced ham...and made 2 without green onions (green=vegetable for my boys) and the whole family  gobbled them up.  Thanks for the basic recipe!!

LOVED these!  I rubbed the potatoes with olive oil and kosher salt before baking in the oven, this helped the skins get a little crispy.  Everything else exactly as written.  Just delicious!  I will definitely make these again!

Wonderful. Rave review from everyone but this takes longer to prepare than expected. Took us about 1 hour, cooking bacon, mixing, stuffing, plus cooking time.  We did baked the potatoes the day before and stored the insides in a ziplock till next day. Making it a two step process helped.  Great as leftovers too!

This is pretty near perfect!  While the potatoes were baking the first time, I threw some garlic in the oven to roast.  I added that in with the cheese, etc.  Yum!

I modified this recipe also.  Omitted the sour cream, and added, Softened Cream Cheese with Chives a couple heaping spoonfuls, thus allowing me to not add the milk, additionally I added garlic powder, however next time will use fresh minced.  I baked the potatoes in the morning and let the skins sit on a rack covered, while my Spare ribs baked slowly in the oven.  The last hour I pulled out the ribs transferred to a Slow Cooker to finish on low and then assembled the potatoes, topping with green onions, and Cheddar Cheese.

Excellent. I might next time put a bit of bacon in with the potatoes, and put the rest on top. But anyway, I made this exactly as written, and we loved it. Will make again. Maybe next time try to finish under the broiler to kind of melt the cheese and crisp up the top; and maybe fill the potatoes through a pastry bag to make it look nicer than a flat mound. But YUM!

I changed the recipe to 3 potatoes and tried to scale the rest of the recipe.  The proportions weren't good for me.  I'm also not sure that i liked using the hand mixer on the potatoes.  The texture was like baby food :(
What I did like was that I prepared them up to baking them for the second time the night before.  At dinner time I just put them in the oven for 30 minutes.

Great recipe!  The only change I made was to add about 2oz of cream cheese.  Yes, it was super time consuming to do all of this, but for Father's Day, it was worth the trouble!  I'll be making these again!

I absolutely love these. They are simple to throw together and you can adjust the sour cream to how you like it without it affecting the overal taste. I also added ready made real bacon bits and it was delish

Wow.  It's been over a year since the last time I made these and all I can say is, Why did I wait so long?!"  Awesome and very easy.  Too bad we try to eat healthy or we'd be eating these all the time!

I had trouble keeping the skins in one piece so I just made a "bed" of skins on a baking sheet and spooned the mixture onto that. Not bad. It is a very rich recipe, so I won't be making it often, but I liked it very much!

Excellent! Even when using fake butter, light sour cream and turkey bacon - still had that delicious flavor, with a little less guilt.  Only change was to microwave the potatoes for about 5 minutes, then bake for 30 to cut down on the cooking time.  Worked like a dream!

This Recipe is delicious the only problem i had was that the potatoes were not cooked enough in 1 hour in order to make the potaoes soft enough in the middle to blend in to a creamy mixture. So i tried blending it all together and mashing with a potatoes masher. I just put the mixture in a oven safe bowl and cooked for 20 minutes then blended again with a little more milk. extremely tasty!!!

These were really good.  I agree with another post on pouring in the milk a little at a time, the amout depends on how big your potatoes are.  Next time I will bake my potatoes longer , one hour wasn't enough in my oven.  My hubby said some chopped broccoli might be good in the filling too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were just OK. I feel though that maybe the potatoes could have been cooked a little longer- probably my fault not the recipe. I didn't fry my own bacon, used pre cooked. Next time I will fry my own. They did warm up well the next day though, better than when I made them. I will try again to see.

Big hit at the dinner table!!!  My family has already requested that I add this recipe to our Christmas menu.  Here’s what I did   •Used all the ingredients but eyeballed the amounts to get firm mix.   •Baked 8 very large potatoes but only stuffed 6 •Used a hot pad when holding potatoes and scooping insides out.    •Microwave bacon and added it into the mash mix instead of on top.   •Put most the cheese into the mix and sprinkled just a little on top.    When finished the potatoes were rounder and way prettier than the picture shown.  I had 2 leftovers that were just as wonderful reheated in the microwave the next day.     Some of the reviews people had trouble cooking the potatoes.  Don’t follow these directions word for word when it comes to baking potatoes.  If this is your first time or you are unsure how to bake a potatoe, I suggest researching online how to do this instead of following these directions.

Very good! I made it healthier by doing the following: Used turkey bacon (and mixed it into the filling), halved the butter, used light sour cream (half of what was called for) and a little less milk. I also didn't have green onions, so I sauteed vidalia onion in the turkey "grease" and some olive oil and added that to the filling. I made in the morning, put in the fridge, and baked at 350 for 30 minutes (adding cheese to the top after 10 minutes). These were excellent! :)

These were absolutely fantastic!  And they would make great mashed potatoes, too.  I think the only change I would make is to add a little more salt next time.

We all loved these very much! I was told these are better than the ones served in a restaurant. Only thing I did different, and I'm glad I did, is I used 5 potatoes, but only stuffed 4 of them. I just used the flesh from the fifth potato so I had plenty of filling to stuff the shells nice and full, so the appearance was mounded. If you don't do this, I do believe they will not seem very stuffed, but they would be fine. I just used the other 2 halves to make potato skins as a little appetizer. We thought everything went together very well, perfect amounts of ingredients. I pretty much added a little more of the ingredients listed to the filling since I did use an extra potato.  I wrapped the potatoes in foil to bake, and I let them cool over an hour before scooping them out. I didn't have any problems with the skin/shell  breaking at all, it's much easier to do this when they are really cooled down. This recipe is going to be used very often. Thank you :)

So yummy!  I made these tonight with the Blackened Chicken recipe from this site and it was a winning combo.  The only reason I am reluctant to give this recipe 5 stars is because I feel the baking temp is incorrect.  Baked potatoes are usually done at 400 degrees, so that is what I baked my 8 medium sized potatoes at and they were perfect in 45 minutes.  I did have some difficulty scooping out the middle of the potatoes without completely destroying the skins, though, so perhaps baking them longer at a lower temp makes this easier? (but I doubt it)  I also didn't whip my filling entirely, because I wanted to keep some texture in there.  If you use the mixer for too long or at too high of a speed the sour cream will break down too much and could turn your filling runny.  Mine was perfect and my family gobbled these up.  Thanks for a great recipe! (but try baking at 400 )

I would give this ten stars if I could.  I made a big batch of these and froze the extra (before the final baking).  When we want to eat them we thaw them out and bake them for about 1/2 hour at 350.  Excellent exactly as written!

These were good! I rubbed the potatoes with butter and salt before putting them in the oven and I cooked them about 1 hour and 45 minutes to make them extra tender. I added some garlic powder to the mixture and skipped the onions since my boyfriend isn't much of a fan. They were delicious and easy!

These are delish and a snap to make. To save on time I have cooked my potatos in the microwave and after they are assembled I bake to melt the cheese. During the hot humid summer months I have also "baked" the potatos on the grill, made up the filling and thrown back on the grill to melt the cheese so I don't heat up the house by using the oven. The recipe is perfect as is, but I add one more ingredient to the filling - cottage cheese. Super yummy.

The whole family really liked these potatoes. We used a little less sour cream and about 1/2 of the milk listed (used half and half in place of milk). The potatoes used were really big so that added a few minutes to the initial baking time. After baking and stuffing, placed them on a baking sheet and covered and refrigerated until about 30 minutes before dinner. Baked at 375 covered for about 25 minutes and then uncovered, sprinkled cheese, bacon and scallions on top and baked additional 6 -7 minutes and they were perfect. We will make these again and again. Thanks for sharing!

These twice baked potates are so tasty and easy to make.  I make a bunch and freeze them. Makes dinner simple on a busy night.

I've seen HW (Happywife) rec these time and time again on the RE.  However, I've never used a recipe for twice bakeds...I just dice/chop/plop and mash...a pinch here, a dash there-you get the picture.  My FIL requested these for his bday dinner and I decided to give this recipe a whirl.  I'm so glad I did!  We all LOVED them.  I think the green onion really makes them pop.  I followed the recipe, though I did have to nuke the potatoes a bit as they weren't done after an hour and a half in the oven.  I made them the night before and refrigerated them before the second bake the next day.  I was using the oven at 425, so I baked them for about 15 min at that temp, covered for the first 10.  THANKS for a great recipe, PONYGIRL!

We make twice-baked potatoes as a vegetarian option on the cruise boat I cook for (Without the meat, of course). When I put the potatoes in the oven for the first time, I rub a teaspoon or so of  olive oil all over the skin, and as they bake the skin crisps up a bit, It really helps improve the stability of the skin and makes it a lot easier to handle.

Thanks, PonyGirl, for a great recipe! The combination of milk, sour cream and butter is great in creating the perfect texture and flavor for the mashed potatoes and the other ingredients stirred in add a really nice depth to the flavor. This will become a standard around here and we'll use it for regular mashed potatoes as well.

I made these potatoes for dinner the other night and my husband and I really enjoyed them.  I used Hormel Real Bacon Pieces instead of cooking bacon.  I also used onion flakes because I did not have any green onions.  I did add some chopped chives.  I plan to freeze the leftovers for another meal.  They freeze well.  Will definitely make again.

These were very good. I used a kosher salt and olive oil rub on the potatoes before baking and this gave them a nice crunch. I also added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to give it just a bit more flavor. Will definately make these again.

These were soooo good. I had my mom bake the potatoes for me so when I got home from work all I had to do was scoop out the insides, stuff the potatoes and top with the bacon and cheese. We ate these for dinner not as a side dish and they were very filling. She baked 10 russett potatoes so we have plenty for leftovers!

I haven't made Twice Baked Potatoes in a very long time.  These were very good  and a reminder why I liked them.  I added onion ranch dip, like another reviewer stated.  These are amazing.  Thanks for reminding me how great potatoes can be again.

Great with BBQ steak.  Made these a day ahead, and refrigerated them covered tightly with plastic wrap.  On serving day, take them out of the frig about one hour ahead to begin to come to room temperature.  Place a rack in a shallow baking pan lined with foil.  Preheat oven to 400 and heat potatoes about 20 minutes.  The skins stay crispier that way, a tasty counterpoint to the creamy filling.  I used one more bacon slice and about four green onions, which was just to my taste.  Very well received by guests. A delicious recipe.  Thanks.

These are great. I didn't have green onions, so I grated about 1\4 of a small onion in it. Used low fat sour cream, and fat free shredded chedder cheese. I didn't tell any one, and no one said a word. Except that they were good. I'll diffently make these again.

This dish is amazing and easy. I am not much of a cook myself but I was asked to make it for my In-laws and was very nervous, I just followed the recipe and it was so amazing they are asking me to make it every time I go to visit.

This is a good, classic recipe. I thought it needed a few minor changes, though. I increased the salt and pepper to 1 teaspoon each. And, I added a tablespoon of homemade dry ranch dressing mix to the mash. They were a hit!

This was good but not WOW. I don't think I added enough salt or something. It tasted a little bland. I think next time I'll jazz it up a little with some garlic salt or something.

Love these potatoes! I omit the milk, it isn't needed. I also use a slice of velveeta on top instead of the additional cheddar cheese.

I have tried this recipe twice.  The first time I had not much success because of the time for baking the potatoes.
The second time they turned out great.  I combined cheese, green onion, sour cream, milk, garlic, salt and pepper.  Five minutes before serving I sprinkled extra cheese and a small amount of paprika before serving and broiled them. This gave the potatoes great coloring and the melted cheese was yummy!
Will definitely be used for company with many of my future meals.
Thank you!

awesome recipe....i always do my own thing with salt, pepper, and cheese,...also added cream cheese.  the following really helps with skin...before baking rub oil on potatoes prick with knife and when time comes to scooping out potatoe do not do it all the way to the bottom...leave some potatoe.

Unfortunately I did not have any large baking potatoes so I used what I had: small gold potatoes. And it still came out great!! I followed the recipe exactly except I mixed bacon in the mix and put some on top just because I like it so much. Be sure to be very careful when scraping the mixture out. It wasn't too hard though, which is good because I hate diffuclt recipes. Will make again and again and again......

This was ok (and I love twice baked potatoes). I tried the recipe as is, but it needs a bit more kick to it. I'll try it once more but this time adding some chilies and Tabasco sauce to it.

I make these all the time! I've used a couple short cuts to save time. First, I "bake" them in the microwave for the first bake, that really cuts down on bake time. It only takes about 10 min. to cook 4 baking potatos instead of an hour. I let the oven pre-heat while the potatos are "baking." It's important to use a potholder when handling the hot potatos. Since the skin comes out a little softer when prepared in the microwave, it's important to leave a good 1/4" skin when scooping out the insides. Second, I buy pre-cooked bacon. I follow the rest of the directions for mixing the filling and bake the second time in the oven. They always come out perfect. My kids actually prefer them cooked in the micro first because the skin isn't quite so tough. I hope this helps some time savy cooks save some time!

these were good. i rolled the potatoes in some olive oil and sea salt before baking. then i just placed them on the top rack w/ a roasting pan on the bottom to catch the potato ooze. this gives the skin a really great texture. i had to use bacon bits because i was out of bacon and they turned out pretty good. i just mixed them in instead of putting them on top. i think next time i make these i will broil them after filling them because i like the tops to brown a bit and they didnt.

Very awesome!!! Very filling! This is a main course, not a side! I substitute ham for the bacon. I go easy on the onions, half the butter and I add a heaping tablespoon of cream cheese to the mix. So delicious! Here's a tip on baking the potatoes, after washing and drying them, rub them in an oil of your choosing. The skins will be excellent!

I love twice baked potatoes for two reasons, 1. you don't have to be exact with what you put in and 2. you can make these in advance and refridge. or freeze!  Yum.. the bacon in this recipe really make these delicious.  I used turkey bacon and it was great!

Most excellent. Followed the recipe as is expect used real bacon. Also I oiled the potatoes and preheated the oven to 425 to get a crispy skin. Then I just cut the top off of the potatoe to make deeper so that you can stuff more stuff in them!!! Scoop out all but about 1/4 inch around so the potatoe doesn't break.

Fantastic recipe! Followed all the steps precisely but did have to change one thing for personal preference. Instead of sour cream, I used 1/2 can cream of chicken soup. I found it really added another terrific layer of flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making twice baked potatoes and the recipe was easy to prepare and came out wonderful.  I fully prepped this meal in the morning and stored them in the fridge until it was time to bake them for 30 min. at 350 degrees.  I baked 8 medium-large potatoes, but only prepared 7 halves.  I wanted the potatoes to be over filled with the potato mixture.  Allow the potatoes to cool slightly before slicing in half and then allow them to further cool before scooping out the potato with a teaspoon.  I left a thin layer of potato in the skin and as a result had no problem with the skin staying intact.  For the filling I used some snipped chives instead of green onions and I mixed ¾ of both the chives and the bacon into the filling.  I used fat free half and half instead of plain milk and also added a ½ cup of reduced fat cream cheese to mixture for taste and texture.  Make sure to mix in the milk and sour cream gradually as mixing until the desired texture in reached.  I ended up not needing all the milk and sour cream.  I stuffed the skin initially with a spoon and then piped on the top layer with a pastry bag fitted with large tip to get a finished look and topped with shredded cheese and the rest of the chives and bacon.  I will be making these potatoes again.

These are sooo good! I used packaged 'Real Bacon' instead and they were very tasty. I make them ahead of time, and then cook them on top shelf of BBQ just to melt the cheese & warm up. Thanks!

Very good twice baked potatoes! Easy to make, and a hit at the dinner table. I baked the potatoes in the microwave to save a bit of time, and it came out perfectly!

These were pretty good, but I only added half of the milk and sour cream. The consistency came out perfect. To prevent skins from breaking, do not attempt to scoop out all of the potato. Leave some in the skin to hold its shape.

These. Are. Amazing.

A few things: I will NEVER understand why people bake their potatoes in the oven!!! I popped mine in the microwave (three large potatoes) and in 20 minutes, they were perfectly tender. Waited for them to cool, and used a serrated knife to slice them lengthwise. Be very careful while scooping out the insides - give yourself plenty of time so you're not rushed. The mixture looked/tasted great even before it went back into the potatoes. You don't even really need to measure: put ingredients in according to your own tastes. I (accidentally) left out the butter which cut tons of fat while the sour cream made it just as creamy. When everything was done, they looked so impressive: very colorful, flavorful... these would be perfect for entertaining (esp. with steak in the summer) and they also reheat well. Could make a lunch of 'em the next day!! Just perfect.

Great recipe! Have been making these for years.  Instead of sour cream I use french onion dip - you get the sour cream/onion combination all in one.

I used 5 potatoes.. but followed the recipe exactly (minus onions on top) .. at first I thought it was going to be too runny, but once it baked, they firmed up and were delish!!  I made these in the morning, and baked them a 2nd time at dinner for 30 minutes.

i just gotta say yum. i froze extras for 2 hrs on a cookie sheet, then packaged them in foodsaver bags and stuck them back in the freezer. double yum. only change was to increase the cook temp to 450 the second time around as i had them at 425 on the first go at them and 2 of them needed more cook time.

these were absolutely delicious. my boyfriend and i loved them.  will definately keep this recipe up my sleeve!  i added the milk in gradually and beat by hand and they came out great.  i also coat the skins with olive oil and salt to flavor before i bake them for the hour.  two large potatoes are more than enough for two.

Very good potatoes! I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because they were a little on the runny side when I added the milk and mixed them. It made them pretty creamy. We tend to like ours a little more chunky so next time I will use less milk and not mix as long. Also a hair more salt is needed but otherwise a great recipe!

These potatoes are so incredibly yummy! I make them ahead the night before and keep them in the refrigerator (making sure not to smash them) and then reheat them in the oven before dinner. This saves on clean-up and allows you to have more visiting time with family and friends!

These are soooo good and easy.  I must admit that I cooked the potatos in the microwave first - much faster.  I added garlic salt to the mix which was yummy.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.  :o)

These were awesome!!  I also made them Christmas night to go with prime rib.  I chopped the bacon ( while its still frozen then cook it, lots easier) small and mixed it right into the potatoes.  I also cooked 5 large potatoes but only filled the four so that they would be nice and mounded full of stuff!!!

12/26/07 update: we make this every year for Christmas Eve.  This year, even after a great deal of beating, I had chunks.  I think I need to bake the potatoes more as they were fairly large.  Advice:  make sure your potatoes are thoruoughly cooked.  Recipe still awesome.  First review, 2005: This recipe is fabulous.  I made for Christmas Eve dinner to go with our prime rib.  It was a hit.  One thing I did different-I used medium potatoes instead of large.  3 large=5 medium

I only modified this recipe to make it a little more healthy, because it is just about perfect!  I rubbed the potato skins with EVOO and wrapped them in foil to bake, like I always do for baked potatoes.  I completely omitted the milk and reduce the butter to 2 tablespoons and used light sour cream and 2% shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added a little garlic powder along with the salt and pepper for extra flavor.

As is, a little soupy.  After a few changes, they were great!  Instead of sour cream, i used a small tub of chive and onion cream cheese.  Then I just added milk to get it to the consistency I wanted it.  Much better this way.  More flavor too.  Also, I rubbed the potatoes with oil/salt before the first bake and we were thrilled with the results!

The best twice-baked potato recipe I've ever tried! I scrape as much potato out of the shell as possible and add a little more of everything which means I usually end up with more filling than shells, so I have to fashion a few fake shells out of tin foil, but they get eaten up just as fast!

Ginger, I have been making these for a few yrs now. I make a lg amount and once they are cool, I freeze them first and then place in a ziplock bag. . My grown children have very busy lives. They love it when I bring them a bag full of them. They do the last baking step (added time if still frozen) while their dinner is cooking. I just made 20 for a BBQ I am keeping  those in the refrigerator in a sealed container.  We will have the most DELICIOUS potatoes in just a short time. Can't go wrong....yummy

I love this recipe!  We actually use it as a main course, because it is so filling.  I have to double the amount.  I'm going to try adding a bit of cream cheese as suggested this time, along with a few spices.  Easy for the beginnner.

WONDERFUL! Made exactly as stated. Best I've ever made!. The only addition I made (and it worked well) was to brush the shells liberally with melted butter and place back in the oven to warm while I made the filling. The butter helps to crispen them up and make them sturdy enough to hold the filling without losing it's shape. Nice presentation! Great post!

These were amazing!!!  And I hate baked potatoes!  The only change I made was substituting ranch dressing for the sour cream (per my DB's request).  I can't imagine it tasting any better, though.

These were delish!  There was so much good stuff added to make these potatoes, they were overflowing from the skins!  I microwaved the potatoes before taking the flesh out, because I didn't have an hour to bake them.

If your trying to eat low fat, low calarie, this is not the thing to be eating, but boy are they worth straying off a diet for. My daughter doesn't like potatoes as a rule, but she really liked these, which was thrilling.  As others suggested, I rubbed the skins with olive oil, and the outsides turned out soft and perfect.  I also added some regular onion to the flesh, and didn't have green onion, so I used chives.  They were easier to make than I thought they would be, and they are rich, so a little goes a long way. With 4 kids and a husband, it's almost impossible to find something that they all like, but these were a hit with everyone!

These tasted great but the potato mixture was just a little too soupy. Maybe a little less milk next time. Other than that they went over well. Thanks for the recipe.

great recipe,  for some reason mine came out a little salty and gummy, but the flavor is good.  I will try again and not use the salt.  I also cut back on the onions--kids....

OH. MY. GOD.  Made them a second time and used fat-free sour cream - don't do it! It's too watery and makes the potatoes ooze out of their skins!

I made these for our guests at a Memorial Day get-together.  They were Wonderful!!!  I even left out the green onion (just in case there was someone who did not like onions).  What a fabulous recipe!  And not at all difficult to make.  I mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid mixer and the taste was awesome!  Thank you!

These potatoes are REALLY good. I am not a big fan of sour cream, but it didn't really bother me in these potatoes.  One word of caution - there are a lot of steps involved with this recipe so it's not something to make if you are pressed for time. I'll definitely be making these again.

Taste is very good but I would reduce the amount of milk and pepper.  Let your guest put on their own pepper.  This can be made ahead of time and put in for the last bake just before eating. I didn't think the bacon was needed, but added a nice touch at the end.  Also Thoroughly mash potato flesh before adding sour cream and milk.

I tried this recipe based on all the great reviews, and sure enough, for the first time ever, both my 7 and 9 year old actually asked if I would make them again sometime! This recipe was a big hit with everyone in the house - I'm sure that's a first.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I didn't use all of the sour cream called for.  I also didn't use the onions.  I made this for Easter for twenty people.  There were two left!  Everybody loved them. I also used red potatoes because I think they are creamier when baked.  Thank you for the recipe Debra, I will use again and again!

Excellent! I scaled this to make 6 potatoes (because I knew I would want more than just 1!) and minced the green onions. The only tricky part was getting the potatoes out of the skin without destroying them...I guess I just need more practice at that part. Still, they were very good and my family LOVED them...and we were fighting for the last one. I guess I'll have to just double the recipe next time! Thanks Debra!

I prepared these on Christmas Eve and baked them on Christmas Day for a party of 22. They were excelent! Many people complemented them and asked for the recipe. This was the first time I made twice baked potates and when I was mixing them up I thought the consistancy should be similar to mashed potates so I added extra milk. I found out while I was baking them that I should not have done that. They went kind of flat. Next time I will not add extra liquid. They were very good.

Idk what happened, but I cooked the potatoes the recommended time on the recommended temperature and they were nowhere near done enough. The potatoes were still quite hard, even though they are average sized potatoes. Idk if that is the intention of this recipe, but I like my potatoes done more which makes scooping them out a lot easier.

I've been making these for 30 years, in one form or another. For a good skin, rub the potato with oil (any kind), and cover with salt. Do NOT poke holes. Bake in oven at a higher temp (400) until done. This gives the potato a very nice flavorful, hard skin and creates a fluffier inside. I like to mix bacon and green onions in the mix to meld all flavors. And just smash for a chunkier consistency. To the mix, I add about 2 T of horseradish (medium), a few dashes of hot sauce and a little Worchestershire to kick it up. For the topping, I mix shredded cheese with a little Panko or bread crumbs and some melted butter. After baking for the time suggested, broil them for a minute or so to get a nice crust on top (watch them!) Delish!

Fantastic.  These are not weight watchers approved for sure.  These were a hit at the last gathering I had.  Everyone loved them!!  I added the potatoes to the mizer and all the ingredients and the kitchen aid mixed eerything perfectly.

I had two leftover baked potatoes, so I cut them in half, scooped out the flesh, added butter and cheese and bacon bits, and nuked. (I didn't add salt since I'd coated the potatoes in EVOO and kosher salt while they baked.) Once everything was warm, I added the sour cream and put the mixture back in the skins and baked. Great way to stretch 2 potatoes to feed 4 people...keeper!

Made these for a family dinner to go along with steak. Everyone thought they were great! and they were very easy to put together, just leave a lot of time to bake your very large potatoes (400 degrees for mine took a little over an hour). I did use a plastic bag to pipe the potato back into the shell and I did taste the filling adding just a little more salt before the second bake. Would definitely make again!

Amazing recipe. Few minor changes. Used chives instead of green onions,  bacon bits instead of real bacon (much easier and still so yummy) and I incorporated the bacon,  chives, cheese and butter all together with the potato flesh. Also be careful not to add to much milk as the mixture will be very runny just add a little at a time until you get a thick mashed potato like consistency.  I placed the mixture in a big zip lock bag, snipped off the corner and filled the skins. No mess! I added a bit of cheese and bacon on top when baking for the second time. Soooooo delish!

AH-mazing!!! EASY and delicious. i made a double batch and froze for later. Best tip i read in the reviews- use a ziploc bag and pipe the topping in!  EASY!

For those who think they should bake extra potatoes to use as filling, i had LOTS of extra, mine are heaping, so no need to bake the extras.

Yummy but we veered somewhat afield by picking and choosing changes made by other reviewers. Microwaved extra large russet potatoes for 8 minutes at 70%, turning once mid way through, and then baking in oven for 1 hour at 375° F. For the stuffing mixture, added 4 ounces cream cheese and chopped broccoli florets, subbed turkey bacon bits for pork bacon, and reduced sour cream to 1/2 cup and reduced milk, pouring as needed to make a creamy consistency. Very good recipe PONYGIRL64, and thanks for sharing.

Good recipe - thanks!  A variation we've followed for a few years is to mix in a cup or so of brie instead of the cheddar in the "mashed" step - adds a great creaminess.  Also, we spray a little cooking oil and powdered garlic into the potato shells and pop them back into the oven for 5-10 minutes, to "harden" the shell just slightly. (Sometimes we'll make them a little more crunchy, depending on our mood.) That will combat the tendency others mentioned for the skins to come apart when stuffing.

Been making this for years - Love it and will continue to do so. I've occasionally substituted cottage cheese for sour cream or done some combination of the two. 

Also have microwaved the potatoes to save time, works fine as well.

I've made these for years - both at home and at the fraternity house where I cook.   Perfect menu item to prepare in advance for larger groups - I often freeze them in ziplock bags or refrigerate on baking sheets depending on how soon I'll use them.   Since I have a prolific herb garden, I much prefer using fresh chives in season to the green onions  - just snip with scissors.  For great flavor you can use a combo of softened cream cheese and ranch dressing in lieu of sour cream/milk/salt/pepper for the same texture.

My family and friends loved it.  Brought it over for a potluck kind of get together and now I am the one to provide this on a regular bases.  However when I made this recipe I made 8 potatoes and it took much longer to cook even in a convection oven.  I also added cream cheese to my mix but no milk.  It was a little moist still but not too sloppy.  I added plenty of cheese, bacon and green onions to the top as well.  Certainly going to make this again.  I also used very large rustic potatoes.

The whole family loved it!  However, I had to bake my potatoes a little longer, as I used 4 very large baking potatoes.  Also, I found 1/4 c milk to be plenty.  I will be making these again, great flavor!

It was good, next time I will oil the potato skins to get them crunchier during the last 15 minutes and maybe even bake it a little longer than 15 minutes

Excellent Recipe! I have made these before, and always make a little more because you can freeze these on a baking sheet in the freezer, then put them in a freezer bag for later. Simply put the filled freezer bag in water to get most of the air out and then take a straw and stick though the last amount of opening in the seal; then suck the remainder of the air out. These will keep in the freezer for up to 4-5+ months. I always keep precooked bacon in the freezer too for salads and anything else. If you are going to heat your oven for an hour, you might as well do as many as you like for lunches, dinners and snacks. YUMMY!! (Don't waste your money on "premade" when you can make these for a little of nothing with ingredients on hand. :))

I make these for Christmas Day dinner every year. I prepare them the night before and just pop them in the oven the next day. Easy to customize since my son and FIL don't like onions, I just leave the green onions off a few.

Perfect! I've been looking for an easy but delicious recipe for comfort food for sad, depressing days. I've found it! The only remark I have was that my potato needed a bit more than 15 minutes in the second part of the baking - I kept mine in the oven between 20 and 25 minutes.

These were good but next time I'll make some adjustments. Less sour cream & instead of adding the milk all at once, I'll add it gradually to achieve my preferred consistency since I felt that the filling was a bit thin. Perhaps a little more salt.

These are absolutely delicious.  I wanted to a nice hot meal for camping, so I did all the prep work at home and then wrapped the stuffed potatoes individually in tin foil for the second round of "baking"...we placed them on the coals of the fire for about 10 minutes and they came out quite nicely!  Make sure you bring tongs if you choose to cook them this way, because the foil will be too hot to touch.  A unique, satisfying dish for camping - thank you for the recipe!

Great flavor!  Subbed fr onion dip for green onions / sr cream due to kitchen stock.  Let cool for 6 hours before rebaking - and would reccommend using 400 degrees if you let it sit 1st - was a bit soupy bt figure that's my fault.  Also put 1/2 recipe up in the freezer for another night.  Thank you!

Excellent comfort food. Great recipe, easy to follow. After I scoop out potatoes, I brush the empty skins with a little melted butter and return them to the oven for 5-10 minutes so they are crispy.

Delicious crowd pleaser. Make sure to bake the potatoes for longer if they are quite large. I baked at 425 for 1hr20 so they are super soft and easy to scoop out.

This recipe was good but we left out the sour cream and added in smoked paprika and garlic. I think next time we will also add in a little cayenne pepper.

YUM! My 4 yr old asked for 3rds! I love it. After scooping the potato whites out, I baked the skins 5 minutes on their own, just to strengthen them, and also used a ziplock baggie with a clipped corner to stuff the skins. Much easier that way. Great finger food for the football game, or for dinner.

these are very tasty but a ton of work... i used leftover baked potatos from the fridge which may have been a mistake because they potato didn't come out very easially and they didn't whip the greatest... but after a little work they turned out great... very tasty... the only thing I had in the fridge was sour cream with onions and chives so i used that instead of plain sour cream and green onions... very good recipe even if it is a lot of work...

This is a great recipe, I put the bacon in the potato mixer, but next time I will just put on top with a little cheddar cheese on top.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Yummy!!!

The flavor on these was amazing! I used Uncle Dan's ranch mix (mixed up with half mayo/half sour cream) as the ranch and added fresh chives to it.  Once I had them stuffed (thanks to the reviewer who suggested using a ziploc to fill the shells!!) I sprinkled a little more cheese over the top and lightly seasoned with Johnny's... stuck them in the fridge for the next night and they were great!!  A fantastic side to my Garlic Prime Rib (also on this site)... thanks!!

Awesome recipe - here's how I reduced prep time and added punch...
Microwave (yes microwave potatoes on high for 3 min. rotate(flip), 2 min more) remove and place in oven or toaster oven at 450 for 15 minutes. Potatoes are cooked perfectly with a firm skin for scooping.
Now scoop out and make your favorite mashed potato recipe.
The PUNCH --- blend in smoked Gouda and some cheddar, your bacon bits - cooked from scratch of course as noted above and the rest - sour cream, milk or heavy cream, melted butter, salt pepper, etc.
Scoop in to skins and top with more Gouda and cheddar. Place in oven or toaster oven (300) for another 10 minutes. DONE. green onions or chives on the side....
You can make these unbelievable twice baked in 30 minutes - I know, I do it all the time and my family and guests cant get enough!

Awesome dish. I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they came out perfect, everybody loved them. I'm on a lactose/dairy free diet currently, but made an exception for Thanksgiving. But that doesn't mean I skimped out, I substituted as much as possible. For those of you who are trying to make these but still stay on the relatively healthy side here's what I subbed; 1 c Lactose Free Sour Cream, 1/2 C Original Almond Milk, 4 Tbsp of coconut butter, 1 Tsp Sea Salt. Taste was excellent! Remember that since you are adding ingredients to the scooped out potato, you will have extra filling. You can fill the inside of 5 - 6 Potatos even if you follow the recipe on the bottom exactly, that's what happened to me.

These were so good! When I was scooping out the potatoes, the skins fell apart so I mixed everything, put it in a cassserole dish, topped w/ onions and cheese and baked for another 10 minutes or so. My family loved it and "baked potato casserole" will be added to our regular weeknight menus.  We didn't have bacon so I left that out, but will definately add it next time. Yum!!

Made these last night and the skins fell apart.  So I mixed everything together in a bowl. Used the mixer and put it in a 9x13 pan.  Instead of frying bacon I used bacon bits.  I used 2% milk and low fat sour cream.  I baked 350 for 20 minutes.  They were wonderful

I've been making this recipe for several years and it is great!!  I've made it using large baking potatoes or using small (even tiny sometimes) red potatoes to make appetizers at parties.  These are always a hit.  I use a hotter oven (around 400 degrees) and place my potatoes right on the rack.  Also, I always mix the cheese, bacon and green onions in with the potato mixture rather than just sprinkling on top.  Also, as with most recipes, I probably throw in more cheese than the recipe calls for.  (I love cheese!)  Otherwise, I just mix all the ingredients as the recipe says and adjust as needed based on the taste of the mixture.  I always make these the night before (up to the point of putting the potato mixture back inside the skins), which is a great time saver.  Try doing the little potatoes the next time you have a dinner party or even as a side dish at a cookout.  I guarantee they'll be a hit!!

Let me just say that I joined this site just to post a review for this recipe! These potatoes are amazing. Fairly easy and very tasty. I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and added cream cheese (2 oz.), and unintentionally left out the milk, and my family loved them. I anticipate using this recipe often and passing it along to friends and family.

These were awesome! I started by baking the potatoes following the "perfect baked potato" recipe on this site. The only thing I did differently was, since my potatoes were smaller, I just cut the tops off instead of splitting them in half. Super delicious! Amazing!

These turned out perfect.  I used white onion which I sauteed in a tiny bit of olive oil to take the bite out of the onion and omitted the bacon.  Really great flavor even without the bacon.

Sooo delicious! My boyfriend and I made these for his family and they were really impressed, even though the cooking is not of their culture. Thanks so much for the recipe.

these were good for company because you can make the day before.  I used small potatoes which was great (one per person- took a little off the top) if you use large cut in 1/2 and use both sides.  added cream cheese in place of some sour cream.

It takes a lot longer than 1 hour to bake a potato to where it is soft enough to scoop out of skin. Skin fell apart, recipe ruined. Will not make this again!

These are the best potatoes in the world! I made them for a dinner I was having with friends and they loved them. You don't have to change a thing. Easy and so yummy, just allow enough time to cook and cool.

I have been making this for years now, and my family loves these. The only change i have made was i was tired of scooping the potatoes so i just peel, boil and whip this up and put it in a baking dish and throw it in the oven. I know the other way looks pretty, but this way you still get the same great taste and half the work. I also saute my green onions in a little bit of butter of bacon grease.

These were truly awsome!  Really, really good!  Followed the recipe for the most part but mixed the bacon bits in with the potato cream.  I didn't really measure but tasted as I went as others had suggested.  Hubby had 3!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Outstanding! I made these for the first time and they were great. I used 1/2 the sour cream but added 1/2 package softened cream cheee. I totally forgot the cheddar cheese and they were still great. I added the green onion and bacon to the pototoe mixture.

I served these for Christmas dinner with a wonderful beef tenderloin  They were a big hit. I liked them b/c they were so easy to make ahead of time.  I sprinkled jarred bacon bits on top after discovering I didn't have sliced bacon.  That make it really easy.

Very well put together. I've always mixed my additions in.  Note: be daring and change up your cheeses! Other cheeses are great, too! I get blocks of cheese versus the easy to rely on bagged shredded cheese and shred my own. Topping with Paprika makes a nice pretty appearance.

Love this recipe!  I've made these numerous times and they always turn out great.  I will usually also add a bit of celery salt and garlic salt for a little extra flavor. If in a hurry also works great to put the filling into a casserole dish and bake rather than dealing with stuffing the skins.  Great either way!

Turned out a little "soupier" than I expected.  Next time I'll use less sour cream and milk but overall was a delicious recipe and I'll use it again for sure!

To me they were too cheesy. All i could taste was cheese and not the bacon. I also thought it took so much time and effort.

So good!  I made them pretty much as directed except I added some of the bacon to the filling and used a little grated sweet onion mixed into it instead of green onions.  I coated the skins with vegetable oil before baking them the second time.  I didn't have any problems with the skins holding up or with the filling being too runny.  Next time I will cream the filling more, but that was my own fault for leaving it too chunky.

My mom always made these just from memory and taste, but it's so nice to have something to write down for future use!  The only thing i did differently was to use dried chives because i didn't have fresh.  I also cooked my potatoes in the microwave to save time on the first part.  You have to leave about 1/4 inch on the sides to get a nice bowl for your twice baked filling, over scooping can lead to a floppy bowl.

I micro-waved the potatoes, as it was easier to scoop them, and also added Tarragon and some of the bacon grease, then baked them in the oven under broil.  Very tasty!

This is the same recipe I have been using for years.  My mom taught me a trick that helps keep the skins from tearing.  Before you bake the potatoes, rub them with butter.  It makes the skins a little crisp and helps keep them in tact.

I actually haven't baked potatoes very often---though I do consider myself a fairly good home chef---and I had trouble with the baking time. I only did two potatoes and after 1:20 they were still crunchy in the middle. Anyway, followed to recipe exactly but used "lite" sour cream (I know...why?), added a couple of cloves of garlic to the filling mix, and used chives instead of green onions. In spite of my potatoes still having some slightly crunchy bits in them, these are delicious. Highly recommended, perfect comfort food. We ate them as a meal, with some steamed broccoli on the side just to help cut some of the richness.

Followed the recipe exact.  Pretty easy to make.  I followed some advise of another and left about 1/3 of the potatoe unscooped otherwise they will tear.  Very fattening but delicious.

Really great! Tip: I baked my potatoes in the crock pot the day before, then let them cool in the fridge overnight.  The potato meat is easy to scoop out when it's cooled, and the skin doesn't tend to break.

Amazing!!!!  I added just a bit of cream cheese, and baked the potatoes in foil with olive oil and kosher salt. Other than that I followed this perfectly. YUMMM! 5 stars in our house.

My mom made twice baked potatoes all the time when I was a kid, but her's are much simpler than this!  Basically she bakes the potatoes, like you would if you were baking a baked potato, then scoops out the flesh and mashes them like you would for plain old mashed potatoes -- salt, pepper, butter, and milk -- until they're creamy.  Then scoop back into the skins and bake again until golden brown on top.  No sour cream or cheese or chives or bacon.  They're probably good with all the additions, but when I think of twice baked potatoes, I think of them as just potatoes and not everything else with them!

My daughter always request these. Perfect for entertaining big crowds!  Sometimes I would just make this as mashed potatoes rather than a twice  baked if I have other dishes to make and especially when the oven is being used. I make this stress-free by boiling the potatoes first then mashing the potatoes in a crockpot  the night before.
cover with siran wrap and refridgerate. The following day I mixed all the other ingredients and plugged in the crockpot on low heat for  4-5 hrs. Also, adding cream cheese makes these  even more tastier!

I like the skins. Make them crispy and they won't fall apart. Generously slather them with bacon grease. (Your mom kept a container of it on the stove) Just take some in your palm and rub it all over the potato. Then bake it. I don't bake mine, I put them on my smoker at 350° and smoke them until a knife can be easily inserted. Killer grub.

We particularly enjoy eating the skins so with that in mind, here are a couple of extra steps (and calories) I take.  First of course scrub the potatoes before baking.  Once you have scooped out the flesh, brush oil or melted butter inside the shells and pop them back in the oven to crisp up while you prepare the stuffing.  I also use garlic salt rather than plain salt.

I have loved making these for months! Recently I was running short on time and ended up boiling the potatoes instead of baking them. After mashing them and adding all the other ingredients, I baked them as directed in the recipe and no one could tell the difference! So if you are running short on time give that a try :) Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Love these! To speed up the baking process I cut my potatos in half and put them cut side down on a baking sheet with some olive oil. Baked at 400 for an hour. The flesh had a crisp layer on top but when you mash them up you would never know it. I skipped the sour cream and used half a brick of cream cheese. Couple Tbls of milk was plenty for me. To make a tad healthier I used turkey bacon. Can't wait to make again!

These were great - so rich and tasty.  I did not blend the filling with a mixer, I just mixed it so it still had a chunky texture.  I save a few raw green onion slices to garnish the top with.  Will definitely make again.

As we were eating these with steak, I tried to cut the fat where possible.  I only used about half the butter (no way you really need that much butter when there's that much sour cream & cheese in them...come on) low fat sour cream & vegetarian bacon....Super delicious!

Very tasty twice baked potatoes. The only thing is I use russet potatoes instead since the skin is way easier to work with, and I would say is bake them a little longer, an hour and 15 to an hour and a half to really get the russets nice and soft. And DON'T wrap them in foil while baking for the first hour, the skin won't get tough that way and you'll end up tearing the skin.

These are delicious!  I used medium-sized russets, and I didn't add any milk--probably just an extra tablespoon or so of sour cream.  I followed the recipe otherwise.  I was disappointed in the freezability of them, however, because they got a little runny (probably the sour cream).  I'll be making these again!

Very tasty!  I didn't have any sour cream so I used blue cheese dressing.  Also, I used that ready cooked bacon and just crumbled it cold onto the top of the potatoes before putting back into the oven.  Much less clean up.  I will make this again for sure.  My husband loved it too.

I always make these at Christmas with surf & turf or prime rib.  they can be made ahead since they are somewhat timeconsuming. Then put them into oven while you're making rest of dinner.   Leave at least 1/4 inch potato inside skin.  Very filling and re-heat well the next day.

Great recipe.  Easy for a student like me to make.  The only thing  is that it is hard (even when you are extra careful) to not break the outer skin/shell, but one can still make due with broken/incomplete shells.  Also, I would agree with one earlier review that the potatoes should be broiled and not baked in order to save time.    I would also not use as much sour cream and milk as the recipe does.   An all-around great recipe to add to my portfolio!

These are so good!!  I made these with low fat sour cream, and shared 1/4 of a strip of bacon per half potato, as well as cut the butter by half and these were still creamy and delicious!!  I also added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder.  I'll be making these for the rest of my life.

A good basic recipe for twice baked potatoes.  I used three baking potatoes I do not cut my potatoes in half after baking. I take a small sharp knife and cut a oval circle out of the top and then gently slice the top skin off. This gives much more room for stuffing the potatoes and they are more stable when moving from oven to plate. A mini cookie scoop also makes fast and easy work of removing the potatoe.we eat them as a full dinner with a salad.  I always  improvise as I cook.  Mine was the addition of half n half instead of milk and 1/4 stick of butter and kept the sourcream probably  to 2/3 cup I  I never measured just tasted as I added stuff. I used extra sharp cheddar cheese  it adds more flavor.  I added about 1/4 tsp salt. Put about 3 green onions into the potates and around two tablespoons of the bacon as well.  I  used  6 extra thick bacon fryed it  and let it cool so it crumbles chops up nice. I then grated about 1/4 cup more cheese and sliced up one whole green onion  mixed all three together put aside.   I heated the now  stuffed potaoes to a nice hot temp in the microwave  put in the oven 10 minutes opened the oven took the mixture of bacon cheese and onion  that I put aside ealier  onto the top and baked for another 5 minutes until the cheese, onion and bacon melted and was sizzlin hot.  I took the tops if the potatoes skins and made peperoni pizza skins to bake for the kids as a treat. This is a nice fun recipe when you want to splurge.

I made these for our football players "before the game dinner" & they were wild about them.  They ask for them  every game now.  Taste as good as a restaurant.

These are a beautiful addition to any meal...the best way I have found to scoop out the centers w/o damaging the skins is to use a grapefruit spoon with serated edges..works perfectly!

These were great. My family at all of them. The only thing I changed was I mixed the crumbled bacon in with the mashed potatoes. Every bite had bacon in it.

I've used this recipe three times now and have gotten great reviews from everyone that has eaten them.  I have left the bacon out of the recipe because I usually don't have bacon on hand, but will try it in the future if I plan far enough ahead.  Excellent, easy recipe...all you need is time.  I like to prepare the potatoes ahead of time on a Saturday afternoon and refrigerate them until 30-40 minutes before the rest of the meal is ready Saturday night.  Great with sweet corn and roasted chicken...mmmmm

If this doesn't get a 5 star rating then something had to be done wrong. These are absolutely amazing. My husband drools like a dog when he comes home and finds out we are having these. The bacon is a must have on these. The potato mixture that goes back into the potato "shell" is actually wonderful just by itself for mashed potatoes! Mmmmmm! I did try and "cook" the potatoes in the microwave instead of the oven for 10-15 minutes but the microwave makes the "shell" too soft and it tears while scooping the insides out. You must cook these in the oven! Make this recipe. You will love it!

For the 1000th review of this recipe, I give it 5 stars!!! My husband and I have been married for less than two years and had my in-laws over for Christmas Eve dinner in our new house.  I made two for each person and we didn't have any leftovers! In fact, I could have eaten one or two more myself. What I love about this recipe is that it seems so elegant and labor intensive, when really it's not. I did all but the last step the night before, placed them on a baking sheet and wrapped it in saran wrap in the fridge overnight. The next day when I got home from work, all I had to do was pop them in the oven to let the cheese melt.  Wondering how it would be to replace the sour cream with a little cream cheese/blue cheese mixture...

I was originally bringing a chicken dish for a shower, which at the last minute got changed to a potatoe dish. In a pinch I started with mashed potatoes since the shower was for 75 people. I quadurpled the recipe and added garlic, pepper and a variety of different grated cheeses.  It was a tremendous hit. Even though there were other potatoe dishes there this one was demolised.

I adjusted this recipe to use up leftover mashed potatoes I had in the fridge.  I added sour cream, onion powder, crisp bacon pieces and grated cheese my taters.  Placed the new mixture in a casserole dish and topped with more bacon (can't go wrong with bacon) and more grated cheese.  Cooked at 350' for 10 minutes and then broiled until browned and bubbly.  I would do this again but leave the skins on my potatoes for a baked potato casserole, a little easier than stuffing skins.

VERY GOOD POTATOES!!! I added some cream cheese because it seemed dry. Also, I got frustrated because the potato skins kept falling apart so I just made a 13 X 9 potato casserole.

I have been making this recipe for 4 years now. We made this again for Thanksgiving today and I think every year they taste better, if that is even possible. I do end up adding about 1/2 cup more milk since I it seems I need to use the hand mixer on them for 15 minutes until they are smooth. My husband loves them. Thank you!!!

Excellent.  I make these often.  We don't eat much meat so I
use half the amount of bacon and we love cheese so I add more
cheddar than called for.

This tastes soooo good.  The only thing I change is I only add 1/2 cup of sour cream and then add 1/2 cup cream cheese.

My father in law made these for EVERY Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner and when dinner was all said and done, we'd fight over the leftovers. Only thing he did different was add one of those packets of potato seasoning (you can find the packets usually with the guacamole packets in the grocery store). Now that he's gone, I try to make them at least one holiday a year. Anyone from the family who knows I'm making them calls dibs. Seriously.

Awesome potatoes. Trust me.

Even without bacon, this is delicious! I takes quite a bit of time and effort (my guest said, "Wow, you are very patient!"), so I won't do these often. But it will definately be a special treat when I do!... (Several months later) This is still my all time favorite recipe on allrecipes. I never use bacon (except once to try it, and I prefer without), and I don't bother with the top garnishes, I just mix it all together. Even using white cheese and plain yogurt (instead of sour cream), this is still delicious. Just wanted to say thanks again for posting. I am a picky cook, so this rating means probably the equivalent of 10 normal stars! =)

Yummy!  I love these!  One thing I would recommend, especially to the people who are having trouble with the skins breaking:  make sure you are hollowing the potatoes out when they are hot.  It works much better.  I've found the best way to do this is to use a silicone kitchen mitt and hold the potatoes in one hand and scoop with a spoon with the other!  Hope this helps!

Great Recipe! 

*Changes I made: 
-Instead of garlic powder, I roasted some garlic at the same time as baking the potatoes and threw a few of the roasted cloves into the mix (was awesome, I'd do this again). 
-Instead of cooking bacon I used the good pre-packaged stuff, I can't say that I missed it or noticed. 

*One thing I'll do differently next time: 
-I'll take someone's suggestion of microwaving the potatoes for 5-10 minutes to start them off. I had a hard time scooping out the potatoes that weren't as cooked, and had to microwave the mixture a couple times in order to mash them to a nice consistency.

I made this only substitutions made were.. 3/4c. sour cream & 3/4c. buttermilk.  I think this makes them creamier with more flavor, not the little bit of bitterness that comes with sour cream.

I made them to serve 20+ at Easter.  What a huge hit!!  My niece even took 3 home with her and the next day my daughter woke up and wanted leftovers.  Time consuming, but easily made up the day before & reheated.   Great Recipe!!

Amazing. I've made them a few times, a total crowd pleaser. As usual, I added extra bacon. :) But then again, I always use extra bacon.

This was so easy and incredibly delicious! I made it for Valentines Day, lets just say my boyfriend LOVED it! 

But...just in case anyone is in a hurry and still wants to make this...just pop the potatoes in the microwave for like 8-10 minutes instead of baking for an hour. They turn out just as great!

Really great.  They are even better reheated later on.  If you aren't a huge onion fan, I would cut back on them.

This recipe is to die for!  I added minced/pressed garlic; 1-2 cloves depending on how you like garlic, and another 1/2 cup or shredded parmesan cheese.  When I needed additional liquid I used whipping cream!  This is not an everyday recipe with Wh. Cream and sour cream, but all will love these potatoes!
I will try as suggested using the convection oven for both first and second bakes.  Labor intensive, yes, it took four of us to do enough for 24 people, but well worth every minute! 
If you love these 'killer' potatoes, try Carnie Wilson's "Fall to your knees Mac and Cheese". Another show stopper!

Everyone enjoyed these potatoes. Easy to make and they make a nice presentation on the plate. I served with meatloaf and asparagus.They are very good reheated the next day. Make sure you use large baking potatoes and don't scrape the skins out too thinly as advised by so many other reviewers. Thanks for the recipe.

Came out very mushy. I wish I had used a mixer, then it may have come out different. 
I will be using a different recipe. 

Few weeks later:
I tried this recipe again, this time i baked the potatoes in the microwave to save time (about 4 minutes each side) and then i spooned out the inside, this time i made sure to spoon out all the way to the skin. (potato guts came out easier) I mixed all the ingredients as directed.
The mixture alone was sooo good, i could barely stop myself from eating it. After baking, they came out perfect...Glad I gave them a second chance.

Really good Potatoes. Loved the flavor.I brushed a bit of olive oil on the outside and sprinkled with Sea Salt.  I added a bit of minced garlic to the mixing part too. My family loved them! Will definitely make them again.

Received two sweet compliments from my husband about this recipe.  He first said the house smelled like a restaurant when he came home and then he said that these delicious baked potatoes tasted like they were made at a restaurant.  :)  My family and I were very pleased with these.

This was a great recipe! I added an extra cup of cheese and a whole pound of bacon!I mixed half of the crumbled bacon in with the other ingredients and sprinkled the rest on top. I felt like it still could have been cheesier though. If you use the large baker's potatoes it is enough to feed an army! I also didn't scoop out all of the flesh in order for them to hold their shape. DELICIOUS!

WOW WOW WOW!!!! One of the best dishes to hit my mouth. Only thing I did different was to coat my potatoes with oil and used kosher salt to season the skins before baking. The rest of the ingredients I followed to a tee. The amout of ingredients will need to be judge by you, depending on the size of your potatoes, some reviewers stated the filling was to runny, just ajust your milk and sour cream. Truly good enough to be served in any fine restaurant. 10 stars!!!! You go Debra girl!!!!.

Very tasty :) I liked it a lot..

I followed the recipe exactly and used the following ingredients to make the baked potatoes low in fat: turkey bacons & fat free sour cream. 

The potatoes were very tasty... I will definitely make them again. Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

Wonderful flavor, easy to make, and everyone loved them!  I did not change any of the ingredients or their amounts.  You can make all or part of the dish ahead of time.  If the potatoes are completely cooled when you make the filling, melt the butter in the microwave so it will blend in easily.  Then for the final baking before serving, increase the total time in the oven to 20-30 minutes, or until heated through and cheese on top is nicely melted.  I will definitely make this delicious recipe again.

This is a really great recipe, my potatoes were large, so it took longer than one hour to bake them, but go ahead and try this recipe, you won't be disappointed, the presentation is also beautiful with fresh chives on top.

Been looking for a twice baked smashed potatoes recipe for a while. This was excellent!  The only thing I'd do differently is add the bacon bits into the mixture. They were too tough when just sprinkled on top.  

Had them for Chirstmas dinner with Prime Rib. Mom and hubby raved! YUM!

I almost didn't try this recipe because I needed something that could be prepared in about 30 minutes.  But then I read that other reviewers had made the potatoes the day before and then reheated - so I tried that and they came out GREAT.  I also recommend adding the milk last because I only needed a splash and any more would have made the filling too runny.

These are great. I love potatoes, and the addition of the other wonderful things on these potatoes just makes them even more yummy. Thanks for this recipe! Would definitely make again!

We served these potatoes this past weekend at our dinner party.  I altered the recipe slightly based on others' reviews. I baked the potatoes first with a light coating of olive oil and salt. Also, I cut both the milk and sour cream in half (to 1/4 cup milk and about 1/2 cup sour cream) to keep them from being too runny. The result was fantastic, and all six people present loved them. Thank you!  This one's a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, instead of using russet potatoes I used Yukon Gold potatoes one thing I changed was that I used only about 1 cup of sour cream, to a 4lb bag of potatoes...I cooked a full pound of bacon and mixed half in with the potatoes and also used about a 1/4 lb of scallion cream cheese as well as the fresh green onions...I baked it in a casserole dish...It came out fantastic with no leftovers! Great recipe I will be making this again.

oh my goodness... DELICIOUS!!! these are a great way to kick up your baked potatoes. They taste like they came from a restaurant... or maybe even better!! The only thing I did differently was I coated the potatoes with olive oil and kosher salt before baking them to give the skin a little crispiness and saltiness.  Otherwise, PERFECT. this is my third day eating it alone for lunch! Thanks!

These were great.  I didn't add bacon as I'm not a big fan, but I did add a Tablespoon of horseradish to the potatoes and they add a nice flavor touch.  Great served with chops or prime rib!

These are delicious Debra, but to make them truly "ulimate"... you need to add some cream cheese, IMHO. I always make an extra potato here (you know you're inevitably going to ruin one of the skins, especially if preparing for a special occasion!) I also cut the sour cream  in half, as it just seems like a bit to much for my personal taste. I add a bit of granulated garlic and use the Lawry's seasoned salt and pepper with these, too. Also an extra sharp cheddar. Everyone in our family really looks forward to this special treat.    Thanks for the recipe!

This was the first time I've made twice baked potatoes and it was soooooo good.  My husband has requested this as part of his birthday dinner!  I went by the recipe exactly and didn't have any trouble with lumps.  Pure flavor!

These were great!  My husband and I really loved them.  I cooked the potatoes first in the microwave the night before and made them up.  I refrigerated them until I was ready to bake them in the oven.  I then baked them for about 25 minutes.  Very yummy!  I had never scooped out potatoes before so that was a little hard but well worth it.  Also I used real bacon bits instead of real bacon.  I will be making these again because it is a nice change to regular baked potatoes.

I've been making these for the last 10 years and find them to be wonderful with everything!  The best part is that it is such a versatile meal!  I have tried many different variations using different cheeses and vegetables.  I always use the Hormel brand real chopped bacon, its so much easier and very good! I sometimes substitute the sour cream with Ranch dressing, and that adds a little more creaminess and extra flavor.

This is a great recipe! I gave it 5 stars, even though this is the first time I've done twice baked potatoes. I've had them many times from the store freezer and other places and there is no comparison. I followed the recipe exactly and used Plumrose Smokey Maple Bacon..Yum. My wife gave this a "9" and she refuses to give anything I cook a "10"....says it's not good for my ego. Almost every recipe is just a beginning point and this one is no exception. Next time I'll try to sneak in some garlic, but that's just me. Thanks!!!!

I served these to company last night, and they got raves all around!  I had to double the recipe, because I just knew everyone would want more than one half (yes, we're pigs!).  I only added a touch of milk, after reading the other reviews, and that's really all it needed.  I think 1/2 cup would have been too much.  I stirred the bacon right into the potato mixture, rather than sprinkling it on top. Also, to make scraping out the potatoes easier, and to avoid breaking the skins, use a grapefruit spoon!  You can carve the outline of the amount of potato you wish to scrape, and then you can gradually scrape the potato from its skin with the grooves.  It worked like a charm!

In one word, it would be a challenge, but....

...INCREDIBLE!!!!!!

VERY good is an understatement.  I may have put alittle too much green onion in for my families likes, but it was still DA BOMB

Thank you VERY MUCH!!!!

I have to say, these didn't come out exactly as intended, but it was totally my fault.  I baked them for an hour at 400 instead of 350, so the shells all but disintegrated when I went to scoop out the potato flesh.  I ended up putting everything in a casserole dish, and baking for 15 minutes.  Still turned out great!  I'll try them again for sure.  I did use fat-free sour cream, skim milk, 1 Tbl. butter, and 1/4 cup cheese to cut down on the fat - great adjustments.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Some adjustments I would make next time...1.  Cook potatoes longer than 1 hour at 350, or bump up to 375.  2.  Use less milk - I had to cook a bit longer than indicated and filling ran and became twice baked mashed potatoes!  3.  Do not bake filled potatoes longer than indicated - see #2!
I also used bacon bits instead of real  bacon.  Excellent flavor.  Somewhat time consuming, but easy.

These were so good. My family loved them. I didn't have any green onions so I used dried chives instead.  and I used the Kraft Mexican shredded cheese that is all I had.  I really didn't measure anything just mixed it all together and it turned out GREAT.  Perfect comfort food.

We really enjoyed this. One of the best things about this for me was that I could do one meal for all just leave the bacon off for the vegetarian in my family. I did have a bit of trouble scooping out the potato flesh without breaking the skins but my 14 year old daughter sorted that out she loosened it with a knife first. Thanks so much.

60 minutes was not nearly long enough to bake the potatoes initially.  They were hard, and the skins ripped when I tried to scoop them.  They never did get completely mashed, so I had to scoop out the big chunks and add instant mashed potatoes to the filling so that it would be think enough.  As a result, they were NOT good.

Made these with salisbury steak the other night, and they were a HUGE hit! I followed the recipe almost exactly,except I used Hormel Fresh bacon bits for speed, and they worked great. I also rubbed the potatoes with a little veg oil, and some coarse salt, wrapped in foil to bake, and they turned out great. They also reheated wonerfully, were great as leftovers! I can highly recommend this recipe, Thanks Debra!

Delicious! I made these but used hald sour cream and half cream cheese with chives and onion and probably less milk as I just poured in to suit. Don't worry about ripping the skins or not holding their shape, once you spoon a couple spoonfulls of the mixture in you can press the skins to the mixture and they stay no problem, get really close to the skin, but if you do leave some potato around the skin then season it, I didn't and you could taste when you got to the plain potato. Just a bit of ex virgin olive oil, salt and pepper would be good. I plan on making these with just the sour cream next time like the recipe says to see the difference, I also mixed hald the bacon in and sprinkled the rest on top otherwise it is too much to put on top. Many thanks

I found this recipe a year and a half ago.  What a winner!  Anytime I ask my family if I should make baked potatoes for a side dish ... I'm quickly asked if I could make these! I only use 6 green onions - seemed a tad too much with 8.  I'm looking forward to trying the suggestions I've read about rubbing the skins with olive oil and salt.  Sounds yummier still. (Is that possible?)

this recipe was wonderful. (make sure to use baking potatoes) I rubbed the skins of the potatoes with olive oil mixed with salt and pepper before baking-make sure to put a tray under them if you do this to catch the oil. I also added some garlic to the mashed mixure instead of onions. the leftovers were just as yummy the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a delishious recipe!  I did not think it was very hard to make at all.  I did microwave the potatoes first as I didn't have time for the oven . . .then after mashing the insides I put them in the oven for about 15 minutes.  Thanks so much!  I got a lot of compliments on them!

These potatoes are worth the work.  I just mixed it all together and didn't bother trying to top them.  I also used yukon golds and whipping cream instead of milk. Yum Yum.  Everyone loved them even the kids couldn't get enough.

WOW!!! Great Baked Potato!  My children Loved it.  I used Smoked Turkey Bacon, instead of Pork, and I didn't use any green onion. A must try.

AMAZING!!!  I made it with lobster for Valentines Day, so I didn't add the bacon, and it was still great.  My boyfriend ate two, he thought they were so good.  And even though I had a little mishap with the cheese (it didnt make it as a topping, and neither did any of the other toppings), my boyfreind said they looked so fancy, like we would eat them at a $100 a plate dinner :)  Thanks for helping to make our v-day perfect :)

I enjoyed these very much! However my family wasn't crazy about them. Hubby said he'd prefer a reg. baked potatoe topped with ingrediants, my 10yr old said she'd prefer either reg. mashed or baked, but they both still ate 'em. My 6yr old wouldn't touch 'em. Only thing I changed was I used reg. yellow onions(didn't have any green onions) and also only put the onions in the mixture, didn't top with extra, I thought that the amount of onion in the mixture would be pleanty and it was.

This was a good recipe but the taste of onions and sour cream was a little to strong for my taste. With a little less sour cream and less onions this is a five star recipe.

These are my favorite potatoes.  I add horseradish in with the sour cream and it spices up the potato a bit.

This was very good.  I used light sour cream and skim milk to cut out some of the fat and it turned out well. I did not have green onions so I used dried chives.  Also, I used some really big potatoes and I had to cook it about 1 1/2 hours.  I did not wrap the potatoes in foil while baking them.  I made this ahead of time and filled the potatoe halves with the mix.  I later reheated the potatoes with no topping until they were hot and I topped them with the extra cheese, bacon, and chives.  Thanks Debra for the great recipe.

I didn't try these, but my boyfriend absolutely loved them.  He raved about the potatoes all night (I should have tried them but wasn't hungry at the time).  The only substitution I made was swiss cheese for the cheddar (I didn't have any cheddar on hand, but the swiss evidently worked just as well).  A very easy recipe to make, and I will definately make it again.  Excellent recipe Debra!

I've made these twice now. The first time was horrible, but I learned from my mistake.  You have to make sure to cook the potatoes for a very long time or you won't be able to scrap the flesh out and the skins will break. Very good the second time.  Will make again.

I have used this web site for years and enjoyed many GREAT recipes, but this is the first one I had to rate, these were sooo good that what did not fit back into the skins was eaten straight from the bowl. Thanks for a great way to wake up potatoes.

I got nothing but compliments on this dish tonight.  I took it to a barbeque so I didn't put it in individual potato skins and instead put it into a 9x9 baking pan to finish baking for the last 15 minutes.  It was sooooo good, that no one even bothered to put the extra sprinkling of cheese and bacon on it.  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

We thought these were good, but in our opinion, it needs more butter, less milk, more cheese and add garlic salt.

This was FANTASTIC! If you purchase the larger potatoes definitely plan for additional baking time....at least 30 minutes. I also used light sour cream and added 3 roasted ancho chilies for a very suttle "kick". Everyone in my dinner party had a whole potato, despite how full we already were!

These are awesome! I have also used this just as a casserole. I boil about 6 potatoes and then mash them together with the sour cream, milk, cheddar, onions, etc. Then I top with grated cheddar & bacon and bake in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes. Very yummy and less work than stuffing the potatoes (but obviously not as pretty!).

I only gave it 4 stars because, while tasty, I thought it is a pretty basic twice-baked potato recipe, with all of the standard ingredients. I cut down on the amount of milk, and added a handful of parmesean to kick it up a little, and they turned out great.

These were so awesome! The only  differences I made were that I roasted a few cloves of garlic,and omitted the chives. I would eat these every day if not for the ten pounds I just gained from them.

These were amazing.  I did substitute 1/4 cup lite Ranch dressing for the 1/2 cup milk and left out the green onion (didn't have them on hand).  Will definitely make them again!

They were too soft even tho I greatly reduced the milk. If I made these again I'd add more cheese to the mix and completely leave out the milk.

Excellent!  Best recipe for twice baked potatoes that I've come across.  I mixed the onions & bacon with the potatoes, then topped it with the cheddar cheese.  They were easy to make ahead of time and just throw in the oven close to dinner time.  Thanks for a great make-ahead dinner party side dish!

These were great!  Everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe to the t, except I added 1/2 the bacon to the potato mix.  One thing I'd do differently next time is to use less sour cream, I felt there was a little too much and I love sour cream.

Wonderful recipe!  I used 1/2 cup of chopped Walla Walla sweet onion in the mashed potato mixture instead of green onions, and topped the potatoes with 4 chopped green onions.  I also chopped the cooked, cooled bacon in the food processor and added it to the mashed potato mixture before stuffing.  This is a perfect dish to prepare the day before, then just bake when you need it.  Thank you for sharing, Debra.  This has become one of my new favorites!

mmm, these were good. Not the best I have ever had but definately the best I ever made. Served with steaks on the grill. The only thing I did different was I used 6 medium russet potatoes instead of large baking potatoes. Stuck them in the freezer for a few after cooking a good 1 hour 15 minutes. (as another reviewer suggested, make sure a fork goes through easily). Used a metal teaspoon to remove the insides without ever damaging the skin. I may add more bacon next time also. Thank you!!!!

My family loved these, however they were a bit too greasy for me (I prefer a simple baked potato with salsa and cottage cheese, though). These also take a bit longer to prepare than some other potato recipes. I will definately make them again for my family when I have the time.

These were so tasty...  I am not a fan of sour cream so I omitted it, and even without it, they were full of flavor and I will definitely make them again.

Outstanding! I made just one potato for my boyfriend and I, and I just quartered the recipe. It turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except that I only put the finished potato halves in the oven for 5 minutes... just long enough for the cheese to melt. Fabulous!

Delicious.  The preparation time took longer than I expected it to (an extra 15 minutes or so), but it was worth it in the end.  Does anyone have a good technique for scooping them out and not having the skin fall apart?  One or two of mine did.

Well, this was good (because all baked potatoes are), but it did not live up to its reputation.  If I ever try this recipe again I will try broiling the potatoes after they are stuffed so that the filling will be firmer and crisper.  Save yourself the time and mush up your baked potato with your fork -- it's the same exact effect.

This recipe had great flavor.  I suggest cooking the potatoes longer than the recipe calls for - make sure they're done!  A fork should slide in easily.  I stirred the bacon, cheese, etc. in with the rest of the "filling", saving some out for garnish.  Worked great!  My family thought it was great

Super easy and super good! I made this for a friend who was sick and rather than baking it the second time right away, I put it in her fridge and she was able to have a yummy, warm meal with just 15 minutes of baking!

My kids didn't really care for it but my husband and I just loved 'em!!!  This is definitely a keeper!!! The only request my husband made for next time was to leave a little extra "potato flesh" on the skin to scoop up with the filling ~other than that, it is perfect.  To cut down on time a little, I cooked them in the microwave (instead of the 1 hour in the oven)first and then prepared them and threw 'em in the oven as directed.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I made these for the first time for Easter this year.  I'd had twiced baked potatoes before, but not like this.  I doubled the recipe to what I thought would be enough for my whole family, but was I ever wrong!  They loved them so much they were practically fighting over who would get the last one, they went pretty quick after taking them out of the oven.  I made them again about a month later at my nephews first birthday, and once again they went fast, but this time I made enough so that there were about 3 or 4 left over.  Even my year old nephew will eat 1 or 2 to himself!  So if anyone out there is looking for something simple to make a big hit at a party, this is it!  It's great that you can take something old, and put a twist on it, just enough for people to keep coming back for more!

GREAT recipe!! I used a wedge type ice cream scooper to remove the potatoe from the skins and left about 1/4 inch so the shells held their shape.  I added the milk a healthy bit at a time  until I was satisfied with the consistency. 

This one’s a keeper!!

These potatoes are delicious. The reason I gave four stars is that I felt they would be too runny with 1/2 cup of milk and a full cup of sour cream. I recommend you reduce those ingredients and only use the full amount if your potatoes are extra large. Mine turned out perfect using 1/3 cup of milk and 2/3 cup of sour cream.

Made an account specifically to rate this 1 star. 1 hour is not nearly enough time to tenderize the potatoes. They need 90 to 120 minutes.

First, microwave potatoes in microwave potato bag 4-8 minutes - very moist this way. Poke holes w/a fork lengthwise all around potatoes to makes sure they will be sliced open evenly. Wearing a pot holder glove scoop out hot potatoes carefully w/grapefruit spoon into potato ricer, then add sour cream,  finely pre-shredded Colby Jack cheese, bacon, scallions & salt to taste (no milk, add more sour cream if stiff). Bake shells lightly coated w/cooking spray 10 minutes for sturdiness. Cool shells then add potato mixture, top w/more cheese & bake in oven. Yummers! Less time, smoother & much tastier!

My go to recipe all the time - never fails!  I have made this many times and definitely add milk last, as needed.  These are great made ahead and hold up well in the freezer.

Some of the instructions need corrected.  I followed instructions as written except for 2 things.  There is no way these potatoes are done in an hour.  I cooked them for 1:00 hr at 375 and then another 45 minutes at 400 just to get them done enough to mix.  Also, I couldn't use the skins as they tore apart so I just baked the mixture in an 8X8 pan.  Taste was good but the timing is way off.

If you need this kind of video instruction,  then you need to wait for worst cooks in America to call. If you want a bland no taste lack luster twice baked potato then you are looking at the perfect recipe. However, if you really want the best ever twice baked potato, think for yourself. What do you like? For me: To my mashed potato I add; butter, bacon (baked in the over at 350 for 12 -15 minutes or to the crispiness you like) sour cream, cheese, heavy whipping cream, seasoned salt, minced garlic, chopped green onions, and fresh ground black pepper to taste. I save some bacon, green onion and cheese to put on top half way through the second bake. When they come out of the oven, sprinkle with smoked paprika and fresh cilantro. Tell me this is not the "Ultimate Twice Baked Potato." You're welcome!

I baked the potatoes at 350 for an hour and when they came out they were still half raw on the inside. I should have boiled them first, but I trusted "ponygirl" and completely ruined my date's dinner.

Loved these potatoes!  The only add was after scooping the flesh out, I turned them upside down and drizzled olive oil on the skins and sprinkled kosher salt on them, then righted them filled them and cooked as directed, Terrific!

Very good. I took the lazy way and cooked them in the microwave. I then let them sit for 15-20 minutes, while I prepared the rest of dinner. I followed the instructions on the filling and microwaved them for 2 minutes. Quick, easy and delicious.

These are terrible.  Too much sour cream.  Turned out flat and runny.  Twice baked potatoes should be the consistency of mashed potatoes.  I will stick to my own recipe.

These are awesome! I used the same recipe with only two large potatoes and they still came out tasting amazing. I've never made a twice baked potato so be careful with scooping the flesh out. It's easiest if you cut it out like an avocado. Use criss-cot cuts on the flesh, then carefully use a spoon. Don't just dig with a spoon like it's a tub of ice cream.

I make these a couple times a year. When I make them I make a large quantity (25 or so) and then I freeze them. They freeze very well and just take them out as you want them for a meal. Make sure you taste the potato mash & add more salt/pepper to your taste. You can also baste the potato skins in melted butter & put them in the oven on broil to crisp the skin up and then fill the potato with the mash after.

First off, very good flavor.  A little "runnier" than I prefer; although I only used about 1/4 cup milk, perhaps next time I'll cut down on the sour cream by 1/2 cup or perhaps add an egg or cream cheese. I tried one reviewer's idea to only cut the top 1/3 of the baked potato off, making more of a bowl shaped shell, which looked really nice, but then I found I had too much filling for half the amount of shells (instead of 8 halves to fill I only had 4 slightly deeper ones). That was okay, though, I just nuked the leftover filling in a bowl and ate it with a spoon! Yum! Cook's treat!

Here is my variation which is an assortment of suggestions found in other reviews and they turned out awesome.  I cooked the bacon ahead of time and used the drippings to coat the potato with before baking.  I only cut the top 1/3 of the potato off.  I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 cup herb and garlic cream cheese.  For the cheese, I used herb and garlic cheddar.  Substituted chives for the onions.  I only added enough milk to get the consistency I wanted.  I added everything in (saved nothing for toppings).  I used the top 1/3 skin that was cut off and placed it in the bottom of the scooped out shell (gives it extra texture in the bottom and there is no waste).  I used the nipped zip lock bag method for filling the potato.  Made them early in the day, kept them in the fridge and when ready for the second bake , I cooked them for 40 minutes at 350 (they were large russets).

My husband n daughter loved them. I didn't have bacon either but I am sure that would make them even better. I microwave 2 of them for 10 mins n thenput in oven for 20 mins. Saved a lot of time n still got a lot of rave reviews.

I made these potatoes a few times now and each time they got rave reviews from my company! They're easy to make and very flavourful!

I am going to make a double batch but put them in a casserole dish instead of the jackets...

Family just loves this recipe. I make my own bacon bits when I have extra bacon left over. I cut it into small pieces and vacuum seal it. It really cuts down on the prep time. I also mix my bacon and cheese in the potato mixture and top it with paprika. No matter what it is a great recipe.

I made this recipe for my culinary project for my family, and it was really good. I used less green onions though because my family doesn't like onions and it was too much. It turned out really tasty to me and everyone else. I wouldn't do anything differently than what the recipe says except less onions.

I have been making this recipe on and off for the last year, and both my husband and I love it!! I use the edit tool and cut it in half, there's only two of us, and I use bacon bits, they are not only cheaper, but they go with my diet!! ( I haven't eaten meat in 10 years.) There is usually left overs of the stuffing, but I eat that by itself. Its awesome!!

Yummy as is, but very easy to adapt to you own preferences. Have left the bacon out if I don't have it. Added some parmesean cheese to the cheddar. Use grated onion if I don't have green ones on hand. Always comes out tasty!

Reading the recipe I thought 1 cup of sour cream for 4 large potatoes seemed like an awful lot and after adding it realized I should have followed that impression.  I like the ingredients and the potential for flavor but next time I will use less sour cream and see how it turns out.  It was too much even for the 5 large potatoes I made.  From trial and error I found that using a knife to cut around the edge of the potato halves made removing the flesh and keeping the skin in tact much easier.

I made mine with the red skin potatoes.  I wrapped them in foil with some butter and baked at 350 for an hour.  I cut 1/3 off, scraped potato from lid and remainder of potato, being careful not to scrape too close to the skin.  Before I refilled the potatoes, I placed the lid skin in the bottom.  I added a little sour cream while mashing.  Filled, then topped with remaining bacon and cheese.  Baked 20 minutes at 350, then topped with chives.  SCRUMPTIOUS :))))

Incredible - a lot of work but worth it.  I haven't tried freezing yet but that would make it even better since it's a long process.  I agree with another reviewer that they are a little soupy so I should have eased up on milk.  I did follow another's advice and squished them a little bit to make them fluffy.  I don't really know if that made a difference but I did it.  I subbed cream cheese for half of sour cream and that was tasty - I usually add both to my mashed potatoes.  I tripled the recipe since I had a lot of guests coming. If you do double or triple, don't cut all of the potatoes and then scoop...the potatoes started cooling too much which made scooping more difficult.  Cutting 4 at a time would have been better.

Huge hit at Thanksgiving this year. Tasted just like my Grandma made back in the day. Also I bought Yukon potatoes that were all different sizes. And my guests were able to pick big one or little ones. This is on the permanent Thanksgiving menu for sure. Thanks

I really like this recipe,It is easy and can be quick using potatoes that are already baked. I made a few changes to the prep which knocked off an hour of cooking time. I followed  all PONYGIRS64'S ingredients exactly as written. However, I made some short cuts for which I will use in the future. I had potatoes that were leftover from a previous night's dinner. I removed the flesh from the spuds into a microwavable bowl. Then I added the milk, butter, sour cream,cheese,and the salt and pepper. I nuked all of those ingredients until the butter and cheese were melted,and tosed in the green onons...  I proceeded with the recipe exactly as written. While the potatoes were baking I zapped the bacon in my microwave for 5 minutes. (since microwaves differ adjust to your microwave)...I had time to crumble the now cooled bacon to garnish along with the cheese and green onion. I will make this recipe on a regular basis, keeping in mind to bake extra potatoes ahead of time. My family loved them. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Delicious!  Whole family loved it!  Next time I will bake the shells separately  before filling them and baking as I like the shells to be really crunchy.  Baking aside, the recipe was perfection!

We liked the recipe, and I followed the directions to a tee. I do agree with some of the reviews that it would be better to boil the potatoes so they are softer. I must have used potatoes that were far too big or something because they were still hard, which proved to make a really "interesting" baked potato. I will try this again and look at boiling them or cooking them longer.

Sounds like a great meal in itself. I like to brush my baking potatoes with some oil and roll them in salt. I don't use foil on my potatoes either. If you like eating the potato skin like I do then the salt simply gives it a little more zing!

I made this tonight as a main dish with a side salad. I didn't follow the recipe exactly , I omitted the sour cream and bacon completely didn't feel it was necessary for my personal taste and waistline :). I made my mixture with salted butter and roasted up 2 cloves of garlic added broccoli florets, green onion finely chopped, paprika and a dash of salt and i added the milk (warmed) a teaspoon at a time until i reached the desired consistency. I topped with shredded cheddar and put back in the oven until the cheese melted then quickly turned on the broiler to get it just a bit crispy. It was amazing so full of flavour and that was mainly because of the roasted garlic which was not over powering.

 I also seasoned my shells before baking with an olive oil rub and some course salt. The only thing that I might change next time is halfway through the baking process is to remove the potatoes from the foil and let the skins get a bit crispier, other then that i would make it the same way with an addition of black olives on top. These were delightful and will be added to my dinner rotation, my 6 yr old loved it.

My kids absolutely love this recipe. The leftovers are even great the next day.  Although I've used crumbled bacon that I cooked the first time I made these potatoes now I take the easy way out and use precooked real bacon bits and they are just as good.

Perfect as is; just subbed garlic salt for the regular salt.  What a treat!

UPDATED on 1/19/15:  While this is a very, very good recipe, I actually have found one I like even better.  So if you're of a mind, check out Chef John's Twice-Baked Potatoes on this same website.  Personally, I like CJ's version just a little bit more.  (In no way is this meant to diminish or denigrate this recipe, however... It's still rock solid!)

Extremely delicious, my whole family wanted more than one! One thing however, one hour at 350 was definitely not enough to cook such large potatoes. I put them in the microwave for ten minutes and then in the oven for an hour and they were perfect! Also, make sure not to dig too deep taking the potatoe out of the skin because the skin will break and it will not work!

Made these for a huge Christmas dinner.  First time to ever make these and my dad stood over me making sure I didn't do it wrong.  He was impressed.  Good recipe.  Easy to follow.  Cooked them in the microwave first until the were ALMOST done...but not quite.  Finished in oven.  Much faster...same results. :)

Big problem w this recipe....don't even try using all the milk they recommend...it'll be a soggy mess. I make the best stuffed potatoes and I recommend about 1/3 of the milk. Keep the sour cream and add only ya touch of milk. It's the only way to go!

family staple in my home.It is a great way to hide veggies from the picky eatters in your family.I have switched up this recipe so many ways from a simple side dish to the main course.they are great warmed up the next day or cut up and turned into a hash with eggs.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I decided to make these for our out if town guests, thought they would be a perfect compliment to steak. My husband & I love potatoes (easily one of our favourite foods) so we always get excited to try new potato recipes. When trying new recipes my husband & I like to be the guinea pigs, not our guests, we were glad that we were. I made them the day before so we tried them that night and refrigerated them for the BBQ the next day - was nice to have prep out of the way. We couldn't get enough of these & we ended up eating them the following day as well...three days in a row. This one's a keeper!! Mmmmmmmmmm....

It is really hot so I didn't want to turn on the oven for that long.  I first cooked them in the microwave for about 15 minutes.  I than scooped them out leaving out the milk and butter and put them in the oven just until the cheese on top was melted.  This saved a lot of time and prevented my from dying in my kitchen from the heat.

Wow these were good.  I followed the recipe as is.  My son who is a little iffy with potatoes loved these.  I thought they came out perfect.  The flavors blended beautifully and it was so dang easy to make.  Definitely a hit and will be made again.

Wrapped the potatoes in foil with butter/salt and baked in over for 1 hour.  Be sure to leave a thick skin so they don't fall apart.  Added 1/2 block cream cheese to mixture and only used a splash of milk.  Can be made ahead and baked in the oven when ready....great for cook outs!

I made these again last night, and there was some pretty stiff competition to snag one of the leftovers for lunch today!  My whole family loves this comforting dish.  I like to add diced ham to make it more like an entree.

I do it the lazy way! I cut off the top 1 inch of a large, well washed Russet potato, stick it into a coffee cup cut side up, cover it with cellophane film and nuke it for 12 minutes. The moisture from the washing helps the spud to cook thoroughly and scooping out the flesh is a cinch using a teaspoon, just let it cool about 4 minutes. Do your thing with the flesh like above and you have the perfect twice baked potato. I just add whatever I feel like adding at the time and never had any complaints. Oh! btw, I do this at my Restaurant also! LOL! You'd be surprised how many great comments I get!

Beyond Scrumptious! Used reviewers suggestions for milk: used 1/4 cup. Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Slightly mashed taters first to avoid overmixing for lumps. Important to find thick-skinned taters - had a bit of a mess due to too thin skins, but just as delicious. Next time will add fresh baby spinach or diced green or red pepper to mixture before second bake. Served with grilled asparagus with diced mushrooms. Success and sooooo yummy.

I tried these for the first time and they came out great!  Only thing I had to alter was: 1)cooked them about 30 minutes longer, but that also depends on the size of potato 2)after scooping out and mixing all ingredients, I had to add another potato because the mixture was too runny, but after that it whipped up perfectly!
Will definitely continue to use this recipe again and again

This was a fantastic recipe which I actually turned into an appetizer- I cut the "potato shells" in half before filling them with the mashed potatoes. The first time I made this recipe I wasn't patient for the initial baking stage which led to a disastrous finished product, but when in remade this with a little tender love and care, it turned out perfect.

These are the best double baked potatoes I've ever had!! Like most people do, I did tweak it for our tastes.  I excluded the onion and added a clove of garlic instead.  I also used marble cheese instead of a sharp cheddar just because that's what we had on hand, I'm sure cheddar would have been even more amazing. One other thing I did that wasn't mentioned in the recipe, I rubbed the potatoes with olive oil and lightly salted them before baking, this made the skin tasty and just a bit crispy. These potatoes will definitely end up on our dinner table again soon!

This was delicious!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and made sure to leave about 1/4 inch of potato around the skins while hollowing out. It made it really easy to scoop everything out and left the skins ready for the filling later. So tasty!!

These were pretty good but next time I think I will cut back on the sour cream. I am not a huge fan of sour cream so don't do this unless you have similar preferences. My boyfriend enjoyed them very much the way they were.

These are AWESOME! Very tasty and wonderful texture IMO.   Definitely not for people watching their fat intake, though.  Yes, I'm aware of reduced fat cheeses/sour cream/bacon, etc....just doesn't tastes as good then.  Keeping this recipe in my favorites file  :))

I found myself with an abundance of potatoes, cheese and sour cream. Sounded like a great time to have twice baked taters. This recipe was great. I made a double batch and put some in the freezer to have in a week or two.

Perfect just as is!  Well I snuck in a tad (2 tbls) more butter but that was a personal preference.  If you use 4 large baking potatoes as stated you will need to bake them a little longer. Not too runny at all so my potatoes must have been just right!  I made the day before and baked for some friends. When one of them asked for butter I asked him to try them first.  He did and passed on the butter as they were so creamy and delicious!  I am always looking for a "cook ahead" recipe for when we entertain and this will be on the top of the list!  We froze a couple up as someone suggested! YUMMY

SO Yummy! I used about 20 pulses with the food processor instead of a hand mixer. It did the trick!

Simple and tasty.  I baked the potatoes the day before and they turned out great.  I did mix some of the bacon in with the potatoes and topped with the rest.

Tried doing twice baked potatoes so many times, but could never get them to turn out for one reason or another. These were delicious! I made extras and have them in the fridge this week. Next time I'll have to get larger potatoes.

I do these on the grill (from baking the potatoes to finishing them) and add a few more slices of bacon. They are incredible!

I thought this recipe was good, but needed more sour cream. I would use 1 1/2 cups or maybe even 2 next time. Other than that, delicious.

Great recipe.. I had extra large bakers.. so they were undercooked.. not a big deal to fix.. I also added 1/2 cup of cream cheese.. they were extremely tasty and the whole family loved them.. This will be a regular addition to my repertoire.

I just made these for dinner and we LOVED them!! I made a few modifications (used dry chives - that's all we had! - and "real bacon bits") but it was delicious nonetheless. I also used aluminum foil to better hold the spuds together and that worked great. Will absolutely be making these regularly, and sharing with all my friends!! Thank you!

This is my "go to" recipe when I make twice baked potatoes. I adjust ingredients to however many potatoes I bake. I don't cut them in half, just slice them, scoop, mix and put back. Very tasty.

These are AWESOME! I use dried chives instead of green onions. Also i microwave the potato then put in the oven for about 20 minutes. Make sure your potato is cooked threw before scooping out the filling. I blend with my mixxer to get smooth. Great side dish! My husband though i ordered them from a resturant and could not believe they were home made!

Now that we've tasted these - no more store bought "twice baked" potatoes.  
I followed the directions precisely but made one indgredient alteration - instead of cheddar cheese I used a gouda and gruyere combination.  This made them so creamy and melt in your mouth smooth.  Easy to follow and a delicious result.  Thanks for the recipe PonyGirl64. My wife has already told me she wants these again - soon.

This is the Ultimate Twice Baked Potato!!!  It has become a favorite standby in our house, so much so that I double it and freeze half when I make it.  Have even revamped this into potato soup.

I've made these several times and they are fabulous.  I now only use this recipe when making twice baked.  They are more work than baked or mashed, but are worth it and a special treat in my house.  Thanks for posting!

YUMM, but when I got a "large" potato, I got a REALLY big one, so it was big enough for two people, and I had to cook it for about a half hour longer.

Yummm!!!  Can't go wrong with these. Halved the sour cream with cream cheese like another suggested but it still would have been awesome the other way. Will make often!

I skip the onion  and use ranch dressing instead of the sour cream, milk and butter.  These are the potatoes of choice at our house!

Everything about the recipe is good and so are the suggestions!

Use cream cheese and I also suggest Lawry's seasoning salt...it always gives a great flavor!

this rescipe is ok, not great, don't add milk, use cream cheese, or even better borisin cheese, and 1 hour is not long enough to properly bake a potato,

I used 6 medium potatoes, which I baked in the microwave for about 14 minutes. I increased the salt to 1 tsp. They came out great; very creamy and delicious. The only thing I would do differently is to reduce the amount of sour cream to 3/4 cup and use more than half of the cheese and onion in the filling and less on top, because there was so much, it was hard to get it to stay on the potatoes. Great recipe!

WE LOVE THIS recipe!  Made it the other night for me and my wife.  Very easy to make and I took adivce from a couple of other  reviews and eased up on the sour cream.  I also used Russet potatoes that are wrapped in a cooking "bag" for microwave use.  Since I used 2 large potatoes, I "nuked" them together for 10 minutes and to my surprise, they came out perfect.  Instead of using a hand mixer to make a creamy mixture, I used a fork to grind up and mix everything together.  The filling did have lumps, but that was fine for us both.  Using the fork also helped keep the filling from getting to "creamy".  Overall, this was delicous, easy to make and definitely a keeper.

There was definitely something missing in the original recipe because these were very bland!  I'm going to go through some of the modifications others have listed because this recipe was nothing special.

I added onions to this and a little more sour cream. My family loved it, though we ended up with more filling than what would fit in the potatoes.

Perfectomundo!  I just went for it and used whole taters and didn't cut in half and didn't have to "deal" with them spreading out.  Just make sure you leave a good tater wall; also I baked up 2 extra taters to add to the mixture just to have plenty!  They make good leftovers to boot.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm....so good!!! To make these ULTIMATE twice baked potataoes so lunch, I did make a few changes. First, when I baked the potatoes, I rubbed each in olive oil and salt then wrapped them in aluminum foil. Next, I replaced the sour cream with cream cheese, the chedder cheese with pepper jack, and the green onions with red. I also didn't use any bacon. They came out AMAZING! Will definitley make them again and again and again! :)

Good recipe, but not exceptional, especially taking into account that it is time - consuming. I had no problems with the recipe though, thus the rating. I used sauteed yellow onions, 'cause I didn't have any green ones and added some curry powder into the creamed mixture, as we love the potato - curry combo.

I made these for dinner tonight. They were so good. I followed the recipe except that I used real bacon bits, instead of cooking bacon and I mixed them in with the potatoes and then sprinkled a few on top. My nine year old son never likes potatoes and he ate them and said they were great. These are a crowd pleaser. I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy. My only negative is that when I put the potatoes back in the oven for 15 minutes, the skin was a little chewy. Next time I will heat up the ingredients before scooping it into the skin so it doesn't have to go back in the oven for too much longer.

SO GOOD!!  This is what comfort food is all about! The melted cheese, the bacon, the sour cream!  Dreamy!  I had extra stuffing (due to a skinning mishap), so I scrambled it with eggs the next morning for breakfast.  Wow!  That has become a breakfast favorite!  Thank you for posting!

These were delicious! I made them for my mom's birthday and she absolutely loved them. I never thought of using a hand mixer to mix the filling before. It made it so smooth and creamy.
I decided to put the filling into a Ziploc bag and fill the potatoes and then smooth it with the back of a teaspoon. This made it easy to fill and know when they were evenly distributed.
I managed to break a few of the skins, but luckily they are really easy to mold once you have the stuffing in.

Very tasty!  Turned out pretty good, only thing was it was a pain taking out the flesh and next time I would cut back the milk to 1/4 cup and a touch less butter.  Went well with a steak dinner!

I had a problem with the potato skin becoming loose but the centers weren't cooked, so I just had to cook them all the way and then mash it up, mix all the rest of the ingredients, and bake. I probably just had weird potatoes.. it was still good though!

These are fantastic just as written, and you can play around with them by adding different ingredients to your potato mix.  Delicious stuff, thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I completely forgot to add the milk until it was too late.  It still turned out perfectly!  As soon as my husband took a bite, he got up from his chair and gave me a kiss.  He said these were AWESOME!  My husband also happens to be the pickiest person I know!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made these potatoes for many years - I like them better without bacon (a personal choice) and I mix all the ingredients together before stuffing the potato skins. Then I sprinkle a layer of Parmesan of or Romano cheese over the top.  I bake them a little longer until the Parmesan/Romano cheese starts to brown.  Everybody likes these potatoes - even the picky eaters.

I have been making this recipe for at least 5 years now and it is always a hit in my house!!  My bf and son fight over these things and I am lucky if I am able to get one!!  Thank you so much Ponygirl for a fabulous recipe!!  In my house it isn't Thanksgiving or Christmas without ultimate twice baked potatoes.  :)  I have made them so many times over the years I could probably make them in my sleep.  Sometimes I omit the sour cream just because I prefer them without it but they are good either way and I don't use green onions because my son doesn't like them.  Otherwise I follow the recipe to a "T".  I  make sure to scrub the potato skins real good before baking them because my kids like to eat the whole thing skin and all.

We loved these! We didn't have any green onions handy, so we substituted diced white onion.  It was very good, but we think the green onion would be better.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good basic recipe.  To lighten my stuffed baked potatoes, I pour in some fat-free spray butter and add low-fat ranch dressing instead of sour cream.  Bacon bits that come in a jar are a time saver, as well.

These weren't the greatest twice baked potatoes my husband and I have had, but they were tasty.  Even after I was full I went back for just one more potato.  I loved how easy they were.   If I were to do something different next time, I would mix the bacon in the potatoes, instead of adding on top.

These were great!  I made them for our Christmas party everyone loved them & really so easy. I am terrible @ measuring, just added everything to taste. I put a can of condensed milk in instead of milk, but other than that used pretty much all the same ingredients.  I took my baked potatoes and rubbed them in butter w/ a dash of salt, foiled them and baked them for 1hr 1/2,  I did 14 potatoes! let set prob. 20 mins and cut them & they came out perfect. I was pretty proud of them. My Husband thought I was crazy! but he said they were awesome. :)

I thought these were going to be so much harder than they were, but I have to admit that I did cheat by cooking the potatoes in the microwave.  And whenever I can, I try to reduce the fat/calories in a recipe, so I used light sour cream and turkey bacon.  They are still incredible, and now that I know how easy they are to make, I will do so more often.

I baked these for 1 hour at 350 (as the recipe says to do) and they were not cooked. I put them back in for 30 more minutes and still were not soft enough to scoop the flesh out. I ended up making them into mashed instead. Anyone else have this problem?

My stepmom and I have made this for years. We dont save the skins and it is much simpler and quicker. Bake the potatoes through out. Spoon out the inside into a large bowl, down to the skin. Discard skin. Add sour cream, butter, salt and pepper (all to your taste prefrence). Mash with fork, it will get stuck and not mix well with the hand mixer. Then add bacon bits or frispy bacon pieces, cheese and diced green onions. Mix well. Sprinkle cheese and bacon bits on top. Put in microwave about five minutes to reheat and melt cheese. It is just as good and folks can get a larger serving than when you put it back in the skin. Everybody that has it loves it.  You can also substitue the butter and sour cream with either miracle whip or ranch dressing. The flavor is a little different but just as delicious.

I have been wanting to try this recipe for a while now and finally did when we hosted a football party. They were better than expected! Everyone loved them. I used another users tip and added the bacon and green onion to the mix and I thought it gave good flavor. They are really filling so dont plan on making more than 1 per person (2 for hungry men!) I will make these again for sure.

These are delicious, but I make them with regular chopped onions in the mixture, and you could still add a few green onions on top for color.  I make the potato mixture & bake it in a cassorole, and then I save the potato skins for the next day & make yummy potato skins!

For some reason, these just didn't have very much flavor. Also, the potato part didn't really scoop out of its shell too easy. Not sure what I did wrong, I left it in for a full hour.

This was wonderful. Went very well with marinated steak and asparagus. I used smoked gouda and turkey bacon instead of cheddar and real bacon to add some interesting flavours.

I did not add the bacon on top since my husband is not a fan but even without it I thought it was great. I added a little salt and black pepper. Turned out great.

These were AMAZING!  I love potatoes and these were the best twice baked potatoes I've had!  I made them for guests on the side of Tequila Lime Chicken and it was incredible.  Everyone complimented it, that is, when they weren't asking for more.

Have never fixed twice baked potatoes in my life; decided to try them on company.  These potatoes were awesome!  Rec'd many compliments and will make again!  The only thing I did differently was put the bacon and onions on the side since I was entertaining a couple picky eaters and children who aren't hot on onions.  Worked perfectly. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome flavor, I received many compliments!  I added chives which gave a very nice flavor.  Minor changes: no bacon, low fat sour cream, skim milk.  Used a hand full of fresh chopped chives and sauteed 1/2 small onion instead of the green onion.  Only need about 1/4 cup milk.

I have often used the Garlic Baked Potatoes recipe from this site so I baked 2 huge Russet potatoes using this method. I cut down on the milk as suggested by another user and only added enough to reach the right consistency. I used Hormel Real Bacon bits and ready shredded nacho cheddar cheese. We ate it as the main course because our potatoes were so big and we loved it so much that we fought over the single leftover half for breakfast! Thank you!

I have made these several times now--once with low fat sour cream and once with low fat cream cheese--both times were awesome!!  Per other reviews, I too crumbled the bacon and add it in the mixture instead of just on the top.  I usually make a dozen or more of these at a time and freeze the leftovers.  My husband loves these, so it's nice to have them on hand in the freezer as I just pop them in my toaster oven--so yummy!!!  Thank you ponygirl for a great recipe!

These potatoes are really good and very easy to make!  My potatoes took much longer than an hour to bake, however....More like an hour and 45 minutes.  We added some extra salt and pepper for more flavor but they were enjoyed by my whole family.

My hubby said these are the best potatoes I've made, and he loves my regular mashed potatoes.  All my dinner guests love these too.  I made one small modification though, I just added a little bit of dry ranch mix, to taste.  It adds an extra little zing!

Made these for Father's Day dinner and they were a big hit. The only changes I made were to use fresh chives (because I had them already) instead of the green onion but either would work great. I also reduced  the amount of milk adding it as I whipped the potatoes until they were the right creamy consistency. I think this will vary depending on the size of your potatoes although mine were quite large. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I know they will be requested again soon!!

I tried this recipe this weekend and the potatoes practically disappeared.  I will definately make again.  I used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon.  Also,  I did not garnish the potatoes with the green onions but I did put them out when serving them as a garnish for those who like green onion.

Awesome! Everyone loved them! Would give it 5 stars except I had to make adjustments. I used 1/2 the bacon and 1/2 the sour cream and 1/2 the butter. Still tasted FANTASTIC and much less calories and fat.

Made these and my whole family loved them! Only thing I would suggest (this is a matter of personal opinion) is that when you beat the potatoes, make them a little bit more lumpy instead of smooth. Gives it a good texture. My family prefers it lumpy to smooth.

Very good! I mashed them the old fashioned way, it wasn't "soupy" like others suggested. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very delicious! I made them exactly as the recipe reads and they turned out wonderful. These freeze really well too; I use them in my homemade tv dinners. I highly reccommend this recipe to anyone who loves twice baked potatoes or just potatoes in general.

Very yummy.  To shorten the prep time, I baked the potatoes for the first round in the microwave, and the second round for 20 minutes in the oven.  It turned out great!  I also used real bacon bits instead of bacon, left out the green onions, and added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to make it quicker.  Turned out great!

My family loved them, and they are quick and fairly easy on nights we have sports. I think that there was a little too much sour cream and will cut down on that next time. We also love spicy food, so I will add some horseradish and/or garlic next time....

Great flavor, looks good, but I'd use a little less cheese next time.  I made three times as many as I would need and froze the extras in bags of two.  They tasted better reheated, although the texture wasn't quite the same.

Terrific & easy to prepare- I made about 7 potatoes, and had enough 'filling' to last for days, I froze all the potatoes for weekday dinner options when too busy to cook, a great time saver, and delish side.

I love these!  The only extra thing I do is after I have cut and shelled the potatoes, I wipe the outsides down with some olive oil and a dash of salt before I fill them.  Gets them a bit crispy and helps the skins not tear.

this recipe is great!  I was looking for the perfect side dish for some friends coming over and I had all the ingredients in my fridge, so i gave it a shot and it was a HIT!!!!  Instead of frying bacon, I used the pre-cooked oscar mayer bacon bits and it was PERFECT!!!  I also added some freeze dried chives and that worked well.  I think these potatoes are great and you should give them a try!!!!

These are absolutely delicious. I'm watching what I eat, and I substituted lower fat ingredients whenever I could--2% cheese, reduced fat sour cream, light margarine, and they were still unbelievable.

Made this and my husband went crazy for it.  Tasted wonderful.  I made ahead and stored in refrigerator until dinnertime.  Set the oven for 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they heated up with ease.  These are now a regular part of our meals.

Totally yummy.. mine didn't come out as good as they could have. Should have cooked the potatoes more, but mine were especially large. Also, didn't beat the filling mixture, was too lazy and just used a masher which worked fine. Definitely good, will definitely make again and again and try differentv variations of fillings.

love love love... Delicious just the way the recipe is.  Here's how i made mine *slightly* less guilty: - turkey bacon - fat free sour cream - soy milk Definitely use real chives and i'd recommend a sharp cheddar Wisconsin cheese.  You can find it in the Kraft cheese aisle next to regular cheddar.  Best part about these potatoes?  Even BETTER microwaved up the next day for lunch.  AWESOME RECIPE!!!!! Making them again tonight:)

This is a FABULOUS basic recipe for twice-baked potatoes!  Its " fabulousness " comes from the fact that it can be easily changed with whatever ingredients you want to put into it.  I dressed mine up with pieces of toasted ham and melted Maribo cheese on top.  Next time, I might try a three-cheese combination, with a bit of red pepper on top.  Great recipe!  It's a keeper in the recipe box.

I added a few more herbs as I like lots of flavor: 1/2 t of dried parsley, 1/2 t of dried chives and 1 clove of garlic.  I also used light sour cream and 2% shredded cheddar and no one knew the difference! Rave reviews put this one in my recipe box for good! Thank you!  P.S. Easy to make ahead of time- even the day before! Just don't put toppings on until you are ready to bake.

These were a huge hit for Thanksgiving.  We made them instead of the usual mashed potatoes and had them all ready to throw in the oven for 15 minutes after the bird came out.  Was great because there wasn't a lot of last minute mashing.  Kids LOVE THEM!

First of all, unless you have small potatoes it takes a good bit longer than an hour to bake.  These were a pain to scoop out, having to be careful not to scoop to close to the skins.  With that said, they tasted pretty good but it was a lot of work if you're willing to do it.

Very yummy! I used small russet potatoes which was a mistake. Next time I will use the large baking potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made these so many times since I found this recipe.  They are ridiculously delicious!    Hints: Add cheese and bacon to the flesh before you blend it together.  Also, try replacing half the amount of milk with cream.  Mmmm, these are extra naughty when you do these things.  I always add in cheese and bacon to the flesh mixture.  Oh my gosh, it is SO good!    Everyone go and try it like that! =)

We are eating less meat, so I omitted the bacon, and just estimated the other ingredients, since my potatoes were kind of small. A splash of milk, a dollop of cream, etc...til I had a nice creamy but still chunky mixture. Anyway, they were delicious, and even the hubby liked them and he is a potato purist. He likes plain buttered mashed potatoes or plain baked potatoes with sour cream. If I even try something like garlic mashed potatoes he freaks! But he loved these! These are a keeper! Especially since potatoes are so inexpensive! Thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes are absolutely delicious! The recipe is perfect as is, and you don't need to change a thing. Those who are tearing the skins are probably trying to scoop too much of the flesh out of the insides.  It's perfectly ok (and practical) to leave some of the potato inside (1/4 in. around the sides and bottom) to preserve the skins.

Very good. I tried these because I am looking for recipes I can do ahead for Thanksgiving dinner and Kristy's review said they freeze well.  I have one in the freezer and if it gets a passing grade from hubby and I they will be on that table Thanksgiving Day.  I will definitely make these again.  I reduced the milk to 1/4 cup because after making them a few times I found that they sometimes came out a bit runny, probably due to the potato's I used but that solved the problem.  Always make more than I need and put the extras in the freezer and just heat them up when I need them.

these were very good,  I did do things a little different as to what I had on hand.  I didn't have enough sour cream so I used some ranch dip that I had, and wow did it ever give this recipe an awesome flavor.  I omitted the milk cause after adding the sour cream and the ranch dip it didn't look like it needed it.  I also added some other spices that I had on hand from epicur( cheese, chive and garlic as well as a garlic potatp topper).  Am I ever glad that I found this recipe thanks

These were really good. I mixed the cheese and bacon in with the potato flesh instead of sprinkling it on top. I also did not use green onions. Very good, and a big hit with the kids.

These are soooo yummy!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 cream cheese.  They freeze well too, just bake them a little longer.  My dad, who usually eats only because it's necessary for survival, has requested these often, especially with meatloaf.  Eat up!  This are great!

Delicious! Be sure to use baking potatoes and let cool a little longer than 10 minutes; otherwise, the skins are more likely to tear.

This Recipe Is Great!! I loved and so did my entire family. Definately a keeper, but it does take a long time to cook. Baked Potatoes always take a while, though and they are so worth it.

I know, I know, when you review a recipe one should make it exactly as written. However, I had no cheddar cheese at the time. Looking in the fridge, I found a wedge of Yancey's Fancy Horseradish cheese from BJ's. I'm glad I used it because it gave the potato that extra pizazz.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Best loaded potatoes ever.  As other reviews have said if the potato is completely cool you'll have a much easier time scooping out the flesh.  One time I was lazy and instead of scooping out the flesh, putting it back in the potato, etc. I just turned it into loaded mashed potatoes, excellent that way as well.  This is a great dish to make the day before and then refrigerate after you put the loaded mixture back in the shells and pop back in the oven the next day for reheating.

Excellent! The only change I made was to add the milk gradually so they wouldn't get too runny -- I ended up not needing all of it to get them the consistency we like. A delicious treat!

This is a great recipe!  The only think that I changed was replacing the green onions with chives.  The green onions were a bit strong for my family.  Oh, and I always use the precooked bacon and I mix about 1/3 of it in the potatoes and the rest goes on top.

definitely better when made with mini red-skinned potatoes!  I just sliced them in half prior to baking, spraying the cooking sheet with an olive oil spray and then spraying the potato skins once placed cut-side down on the table.  I baked them for about 20 minutes at 425 degrees.  Important note:  keep in mind it will take a lot more of these, and be careful when mixing the insides of the potatoes; it can turn to soup faster than you'd imagine!

These were pretty good, but needed more salt and maybe some garlic powder.  I'll make again, but with those modifications.

Count me in this is the best I ever had!  My sons and husband absolutely loved them.  I did use a little garlic powder, and 1 C. chopped sweet onion because I didn't have chives.  Wow!  Over the top!

A tasty recipe - served with grilled steak and Maple Dill Carrots, also from this site. I made a few changes - I used 1/2 cup of light sour cream and 4 ounces of light cream cheese (which I had on hand - so a good way to use it up) for the 1 cup of sour cream. When mixing the potato mixture, I added half of the  bacon to the ingredients, saving the rest for the top as directed. I made the potatoes ahead of time, refrigerated them, and baked for 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven before serving. I had some spillage over the sides of the potato cases - but I attribute that to the 'light' products - not the recipe. The potatoes were delicious.

YUM!  Delicious! I had asked my picky husband if he wanted a twice baked potato with his dinner tonight and he said no.  Well, when I took these out of the oven, he suddenly changed his mind and ate the entire thing before I had a chance to eat a bite!  They were delicious!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  SO EASY and GOOD!

I have made these twice in the past week. Once as my family's potato choice for Christmas day and another time for a staff Christmas party. Both times I made them the day before and then popped them in the oven 30 min. before we ate. They were perfect. Nice and creamy!  I will note that I did add about 3 oz of cream to each batch just like I do when making GOOD mashed potatoes.  Put the mix in a zip lock bag and snip off the corner to fill your potato halves. If you want to make it super fancy, use a 1M piping tip.
Try this one you will love it!

I made these for our Christmas dinner and they were a huge hit!  My kids liked them the next day also.  To help hold the skins together I wrapped them in foil before baking, that seemed to help~

These came out very good!  The only probably was that I was short on time so I microwaved the potatoes.  The skin wasn't that think so when i was scrapping the filling out, I was breaking the shell.  But the taste was great and easy! The bacon on the top was also a nice touch.

FANTASTIC! Great flavor.  My only complaint is I would like to make the skins more crispy on the outside.  Hubby liked these so well that he asked for them for Thanksgiving Day.

The only substitution I made was using cream cheese instead of sour cream.  Also, I would recommend baking the potatoes for more than 1 hour (maybe 20-30 minutes more) to make it easier to remove the insides of the potatoes.  But they tasted great.  Thank you for a wonderfully easy recipe.

We really liked these. The only problem is the way to easily scrap out the skins to make the fillig. But really wasn't all that hard, it just wasn't as lovely as it could have been. But still, SO GOOD!

Cooking for one...I used one microwave ready Russet potato (in plastic).  It said to microwave for 7-8 minutes so I choose 7 minutes and let it sit for 10 minutes as instructed.  I cut the potato in half and the skin fell off so I had to adapt the recipe.  I put the potato in a ramkin and mashed the ingredients together.  It was chunky, not creamy and I baked it as directed.  The taste was fabulous but it was a little dry (not bad though) so next time I would probably add another tablespoon of milk.  The flavors really melt together and you don't need any salt.  Will make again!

Being a native Idahoan, it is expected that I whip up the best potato recipes. I got this recipe out of Barbara Swains 1978 Cookery for 1 of 2, and have been using it since... 30 years now.  Sometimes, in lieu of milk I use 1/2n1/2 or whipping cream.  This recipe is the utlimate!

WOW...very good. The only thing I added to this recipe was rub the outside of the potatoes with olive oil, & sprinkle with garlic powder, salt & pepper. Added garlic powder to the mixture. Everyone is always begging me to make more.

These were awesome and sad to say none left over to snack on. My only mistake was mixing it all together- the potatoes weren't that big so the milk/sour cream was probably to much, next time I will  hold back these two and slowly add till the right texture.
Will make all the time now!

I had no scallions so I really can't review accurately. I substituted carmilized onion and a small amount of fresh garlic. I thought over all the recipe was good but very rich.

I used the baby red potatoes and used chopped parsley on top instead of scallions. They turned out amazing and after the party there was none left!

I would not recommend this recipe. 1 full cup of sour cream is far too much. When added to a 1/2 cup of milk you're left with a soupy consistency that wrecks 1.25 hours of preparation. Most recipes call for half the amount of sour cream (or no milk), so stick with one of those.

I ended up mashing the potatoes because the skins fell apart, but it was really tasty. I just added the same ingredients and mixed it in my mixer.

LOVE THESE!!!  I'm sorry I didn't rate this recipe sooner.  I've been using this recipe for 2 years now.  They have become a staple at my Thanksgiving table.  My hubby calles them potato boats.  I usually have to double the recipe if I want any leftovers.  They are absolutely delicious!

Oh, I almost forgot; as suggested I did rub olive oil on the skin and dusted with a little bit of Kosher salt.  Nothing was wasted on this potatoe.  Everyone ate everything, including the skin.

These potatoes are amazing.  I made them on Mother's day with BBQ Steak for my Inlaws.  Rave reviews all around, even from the F.I.L who likes his food pretty basic, I think he was looking for a second potatoe.  Sorry Dad,  maybe next time.  
 
Rather than half the spuds, I 3/4'd them and used the flesh from the other 1/4. This meant that there was more of the potatoe, sour creme, bacon, onion mixture that could fit in the souds.  So I finished it off,  that was the best part, one of the perks to being the chef that night.

My friend, Linda, told me about this recipe.  I rubbed the outside of the potatoes with olive oil, salt & pepper before baking.  I also added garlic powder to the potato innards, bacon, scallion, cheddar cheese, sour cream, milk, and S&P.  Made them the night before and I'll just reheat the filling, stuff the skins, and pop in the oven to reheat and melt the cheese.  So good!!!

Awesome recipe, will make again. I also used olive oil on the potato skins before baking, added great favor and made the skins softer. I also added a bit more cheese as my family are huge cheese fans.

i baked my potatoes in the oven and when they were done, they werent cooked in the middle. so i ended up microwaving them with a damp papertowel on top, and instead made "baked mashed potatoes". still good, but cooking time was off. a little disappointed in that, but is a good recipe overall.

Yum! Only part I changed was zapping three slices of Pre-cooked bacon in the microwave since I had some I needed to use up.  They tasted great and my husband loved them. Thanks for a great recipe!

These wound up being very good despite me destroying the potato skins when trying to scoop the insides out. Definitely make sure you don't forget to put in the pepper and salt, otherwise it turns out a little bland.

I cheated making this to save time.  I microwaved  my potatoes for 10 minutes and before placing them in the oven, I sliced them in half and scooped out the potato flesh.  I baked the potatoes for 10 minutes on 450 and broil for 5.  Removed from oven and scooped the potato mixture  in and returned to the oven for 15 minutes of baking.  They are perfect and saved me some time.

This was very good and easy.  The only thing I'll do different next time is to add more salt and pepper than what is called for.  The filling needed a little more salt & pepper.  Very tasty!

Very tasty and simple to make.  Be sure to cool potatoes before scooping out otherwise they tend to fall apart like mine did.  No problem, I molded them back together when refilling.  I omitted the green onion for my kids sake and they were still very good. A keeper!

These are excellent, and an "always asked for" side at my house.  I find that bumping the temp of the oven up to 425º and baking for an hour produces a really thick and crunch shell-- which we all love.

These were a big hit.  I left out the green onions b/c the kids don't like them.  The key is making sure the potatoes are cooked through before cut them and scrape out the inside.

These are the best twice-baked potatoes ever! I leave out the sour cream, however, as DH will not eat anything with sour cream, but they are still good.

Try microwaving the potatoes as a shortcut instead of baking them in the oven. Also, these freeze really well. Just pull them when you need them to go with a fast meal.

I was looking for an easy way out and instead of baking the potatoes for a hour first, I microwaved them for 10 mins.  They came out just fine.  The mixture did well and the shells held up nicely.  I cant imagine taking all that time to bake them in the oven when these were great, even as leftovers!

I make these often and my husband and I love them. I have even brought some for my parents to reheat and they are just as good. Although I do add more cheese than this recipe calls for and sometimes add different types of cheeses. I have used real bacon bits before but making it fresh is the way I prefer it.

These are really yummy potatoes! 
They seem to be a hit with everyone I make them for!
I definitely like to add more cheese, and as a tip:  I used a melon-baller (those metal scoops) to scoop the insides out of the potatoes.  I found spoons to be too dull, and was able to keep the skins in tact more easily with it.
Thanks so much!

This was pretty good.  The potato filling seemed a little loose and like it was missing something.  It just needed something else.  Overall it was good and there weren't any leftovers.  Now if only I could figure out what is missing...

Excellent recipe -- easy to prepare.  I had to add the guts of one extra baked potato because the filling was a little too soupy, but I may have used potatoes that were too small.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over!!

Add a little dijon mustard to the mixture~really excellent flavor.  I also used mayo instead of sour cream~much smoother tasting and the four cheese taco mix instead of cheddar.  Family loved it!

Unbelievable! So much creamier than a typical baked potatoe!  This was a crowd pleaser!  I didn't use nearly as much green onion b/c it can be so potent. Probably half was good for us, and it was perfect! This is such a yummy treat for a different spin on baked potatoe night!

These were pretty good, but not nearly as good as I was expecting based on the ratings. I used Oscar Meyer's Real Bacon Bits as a time saver, mixed some into the sour cream mixture, as well as sprinkling on top. I also added some parsley and garlic powder to the mixture. I put them into bread loaf pans, which worked out great. They stayed upright in the oven and kept the mess to a minimum.

I make this recipe often. The only thing I might do differently is put all the potato/cheese/bacon mixture into a casserole dish and add more shredded cheese on top. Saves time and my family loves it.

I love these. They are a great way to have an impressive side dish when you know you'll have a tight timeframe to cook in but still want a decent meal. Just make em ahead of time and refrigerate/freeze em and then pop em in the oven when you need em.

ON MY GOODNESS!!! I cannot say enough about this recipe. I have made it 3 times now and we have LOVED it every time. I made a few little modifications...I added a little oregano, a heaping tablespoon of onion soup mix, some garlic powder and extra cheese (of COURSE). I have used fat free sour cream and lots of milk because we like them nice and creamy. I bake them for about an hour. I love this because you can have it all organized for guests in the afternoon or even the day before! AWESOME!

Its a great recipe!Though I used 6 small delaware potatoes in this recipe. Any unused filling made tasty lunch snacks by using puff pasty and lining muffin tin bases with it. Then filling was added. Very Tasty!

My husband is a Marine and a lot of times his buddies will come over to eat with us. I am not a good cook, but when I served this dish you would have thought I could have my own cooking show! His buddies loved them so much whenever they come over they bring the ingredients so I can make them!!! They turned out great! I added broccoli, garlic salt, and oregano...just to add a little more flavor. Great recipe!

I'm sorry to say, but this was okay at best.  Not bad, but I've made twice baked potatoes several times in the past that I enjoyed quite more, with fewer ingredients.  I think I'll stick with the basics.

This makes a very rich, creamy side dish, perfect for those nights when you want something more than just “meat and potatoes”!  I was very happy with these, though my potatoes took almost two hours to cook, but they were very big!   I took the advice of other reviewers and added the milk at the end of my mixing, so I could judge the consistency.

These were very good but I'll try them again with a few adjustments next time like less onions ( I thought the onions overpowered everything else) less sour cream and bake the potatoes a little longer ( my peels did not stay intact).But like others have said, all this depends on the size of your potatoes, you adjust it according to that.

These turned out very good but I found that I needed to bake the potatoes for more than 1 hour.  I also added 3 oz of cream cheese to the mix.  Overall it is a great recipe.

I've made this recipe at least 10 times. Whenever I feel like having potatoes I use this recipe- it's so much tastier than a basic potato, and you don't have to worry about the kids getting the fixin's all over! I've used lots of different cheeses and I separate it into 2 batches, adding the onion to the "adult" batch and I add more bacon to the kid batch to make it more appealing to my 2 & 4 year old boys. This is my standby dinner! Update: I recently made these with an added 1/2 cup pureed cauliflower and a 1/2 cup of cooked, pureed navy beans. It was FANTASTIC. Not only did the potatoes have more nutrition, but the taste was more full AND it made it so each potato skin had more stuffing! I will only do this from now on!!

These potatoes come out delicious every time.  The only thing that I have learned to do differently is to wait until the end to add the milk.  That way I only add what is necessary to get the perfect consistency.

I am giving this a four becuase I thought it was a 3 and my husband thought it was a 5.  These were just a little too runny for my tastes.  If I make again, I will add the milk a little at a time.

This recipe was wonderful with a few changes, after having read several reviews that it was soupy, I only used about 1/4 of cream instead of milk.  I also used the grease from the bacon instead of the butter (sounds disgusting but highly recommended).  It was the most delicious twice baked potatoe I'd ever had and I am not a huge fan of baked potatoes.

These are fantastic!  I used cream instead of milk to make it smoother, and cooked the potatoes for 1 hour 20 minutes to make sure the flesh is all soft. I started with the hand masher, but finished them with the electric. Everyone loves them :o)

The flavor is very good however I had the same problem as some of the other members with the filling being too soupy and when I pulled them out of the oven lots of the filling had boiled over onto the pan. I will make them again with a little less cream and see how it goes. One more tip: my potatoes kind of wobbled around a bit so make sure that you scrape enough out of the bottom of the skin that they will lay flat.

I tried this recipe last night & was pretty disappointed. It needs to specify how big the potatoes should be because when I mixed it together it became almost soupie. All we could taste was sour cream in the filling although I put extra cheese. I will probably try the recipe again but cut back on the milk & sour cream. Also I probably will not beat the filling with a mixer as instructed.

This recipe was okay but I was looking for a duplicate recipe of a twice baked potato that we get at a local restaraunt and this didn't come close. It was good but mine turned out very runny so I would probably cut back on the milk next time.

Awesome!! I would cook the potatoes at 400 degrees for 1 hour next time because they weren't done enough at 350. I made them in the morning for a dinner party & kept the filling in the fridge.  15 minutes before everyone came I stuffed & put them in the oven. They cooked 30 minutes or so, but were just fine.  I put bacon on half of them, just in case people don't like that flavor.  I did mix in all the green onions & only used 1/4 cup of cheese on top. Every last one was eaten & my husband wonders when we get to have them again!

Time consuming, but oh so good.  I cut the recipe in half.  Used turkey bacon, low fat sour cream and skim milk.  Turned out great.  We did not top with extra cheese or onion, just used bacon

Thanks Debra.  What a great baked potato.  This recipe is great as leftovers.  I just stored in a plastic bag and pulled out what I needed during the week and heated in the microwave.  I will definately be making this again.

These are wonderful!  We didn't have green onion, so we finely chopped some yellow onion instead.  We will make these again.

These were the ULTIMATE twice baked potatoes!  The only change I made was to add about 3 ounces of cream cheese to the mixture.  I decided to mix the bacon bits in with the potato mixture and put them on top.  Also, I think 4 green onions would be plenty.  These got rave reviews!

Let me add my voice to the chorus of those who sing the praises of this wonderful recipe!  Excellent! Divine!  Wonderful!  Oh my goodness!  Need I say more?  Depending on the type of potato I had on hand, I used more or less milk and butter to get the right consistency, but other than that, followed the recipe as written.

Well, these were....okay.  The consistency wasn't as creamy and smooth as I had hoped for.  My husband can't eat them b/c he is low-carbing it right now.  I had one for dinner and will have one for lunch today.  I froze the other two for a quick lunch or snack later on.  They seem to freeze well.  I followed the recipe with only one change and that was I used less green onions than called for...about half.  I think next time I will add a couple tablespoons of cream cheese to the mix and see if that gives it the consistency that I want.  UPDATE: 9/16/2006; I tried again and added 2 Tbsp of reduced fat cream cheese and this made it much, much better.

I have made these twice now and each time we love them!  I sort of eyeball all the measurements.  Will continue to make this--my toddler loves them... it's a good way to sneak in  other foods (fish, broccoli mashed up, etc).  Thanks!

I used 3 large potatoes (microwaved), 3 pieces of bacon, 1 cup of cheese, no green onions, everything else the same.  Then whipped in a blender.  It was wonderful!

I made these with our NY Steak Dinner last night. My family couldn't stop talking about how great they were. My husband said that it was the best potato he had ever had in his life. And he isnt that young. I followed the recipe exactly exept i put oil on the outside of my potato and coated in coarse salt before baking. I also used precooked bacon bits for the bacon. Saved on time. I will be making these again soon. Thanks for the recipe :)

The recipe does not include any instructions on how to bake the potatoes. Having never made twice baked potatoes before, I wrapped mine in tinfoil the first time with disasterous results - the skins were unusable and I had to spoon the mixture into a muffin tray. That said, the taste was nice, and second time around, with advice from others, I coated potatoes in oil and salt and didn't wrap them in anything, and it turned out wonderfully! Also, I'm a vegetarian, so omitted the bacon, but may try with BacoBits or veggie bacon.

This recipe takes some time, but it's well-worth the effort. I get requests for them whenever we have people over for dinner. For me, the trick is to MAKE SURE your potatoes are fully cooked before making the filling. Then I just add the liquid (milk, sour cream, etc) as needed--sometimes I need more and sometimes less. After one or two tries you definitely get the hang of it.

I tried these last night doing only two large bakers (russets). A little time consuming but a very good loaded twice baked potato recipe. If you want the skins to be a little more "crisp" so they're easier to work with, scrub taters well, pat dry and rub a small amount of tub margarine all over the skin and put directly on the oven rack. You will still need to use a knife (or spoon) to outline where you are scooping. I baked these about 1 hr and 15 min. as these were good sized potatoes. My 20 yr old son actually asked me did I really make those or did I buy them. I will make again for a family function/holiday.

Yummy!!  I added about 1/4 cup more sour cream to make them tangier, used 1 1/2 c cheddar in the mixture and 1/2 cup on top, and added a bit more milk to make them creamier.  I also buttered and salted (w/coarse salt) the potato skins before serving.  My grandma always makes these without the bacon, and as a result I'm not sure it's necessary, but it certainly wasn't a horrible addition.  Am happy to have found this recipe!  Plan on bringing to a get together in a few weeks!  Thanks :)

These really are the ultimate. My skins fell apart, so I just baked them in a dish in the oven. I cut the sour cream in half and made up for it with cream cheese. I also used all light ingredients (except the bacon!) and they turned out great.

These were sooo good.  There were no leftovers - next time I will make more.
A few changes - I used half the sour cream and cheese because I ran out.  Used only 2 T. Butter to cut fat.  I didn't have any chives, so instead, I added French's Onions to the top about five minutes before they were done baking.  I also baked in a 9x9 pan - less work.  This recipe is impossible to screw up!  I will be making for all my parties from now on.

Very good.  My oven was "busy" cooking other things so I nuked the potatoes for 30 minutes which worked our perfectly.  Also, i had mozarella cheese already shredded so I used that instead of cheddar - probably would have been better with cheddar but mozarella was very good, too.  I skipped on the bacon, as well - seems like there would be a lot of ways to vary this recipe and still have it yummy.

Very good Potatoes.  I did as some members suggesyed and used just a little milk.  Threw in some garlic for taste and they were awesome.  Not really very hard to make either as I made them in the afternoon then just reheated them for the dinner..

This recipe was wonderful.  I substituted colby jack cheese for the cheddar because it's what I had, but that didn't hurt the taste or texture.  The one thing I noticed was that at 350, those large baking potatoes won't get done in an hour.  I baked mine at 450 and it still took an hour and twenty minutes.  Next time I'll use smaller potatoes.  But the recipe itself is solid and the flavor of the onion with the sour cream was great.  I also added garlic powder and parsely, and would have thrown in chives if they were in season.  Every bite disappeared.

These were AWESOME and even better the next day! I didn't change the recipe at all, but you have to *really* like green onions - 8 is a lot! I thought they added a nice touch. I didn't think they were runny, just perfect. And even if you mess up taking out the filling, when you put it back in - it looks perfect. Ha ha :) Great, thanks for sharing! Oh, and I microwaved the potatoes to save time and they still tasted great. 12 minutes for 4 big potatoes, but it depends on your microwave!

These were wonderful.  I made them, but before doing so, I checked the reviews.  I saw that they could be runny with the milk and sour cream, so I omitted the milk altogether.   They were very good, and there was extra filling left over, that I believe, I will make mashed potatoes as a side dish tomorrow night.  I will definetly make these again.

The flavor was very good but i agree with the other reviews that it is too soupy.  I cut down on sour cream but i think you must cut down on  milk also

Very tasty potatoes.  I didn't put the green onions in because I forgot to buy them.  I think the flavor would have been better with them or some onion.  I suggest adding the milk slowly as you beat them so you can control the consistency.  I followed the recipe and I thought they were a little too wet.  I used a melon baller to scrap the potato out.  I was able to get right down to the potato skin without breaking it.  I will make them again with a few other variations.  Overall very good.

Made last night for Christmas Eve dinner. VERY nice recipe. I adjusted milk/sour cream to make a chunkier filling. Otherwise everything was fantastic.

I love these!! the only difference is i do my taters in the microwave, and i use the bacon bits in a jar, i have made them with regular home cooked bacon, which iiisss much better, but in a pinch, bacon bits are good too! thanks for a great recipe!

What a great recipe!  I love the way you can alter the recipe to suit whatever you have in the pantry or what you're in the mood for.  I only had Idaho russet potatoes, but they worked fine.  I used low-fat ingredients and left out the green onions and bacon since I didn't have any around.  Instead I added minced garlic and dried chives.  Wow!  My husband has never had any twice-baked potatoes other than the packaged, frozen kind, so he was doubtful he'd like these.  Instead he found himself scarfing them down and telling me I should make them again! I plan to, but want to play around with the ingredients, adding things like turkey bacon, chopped broccoli, and so on.  These are practically a meal in themselves, especially with a nice green salad for a side.

These had a great flavor but we weren't too thrilled with the "soupy" consistency.  I will definitely try these again but will have to experiment -- maybe try less milk.

These are really good! I saved some time by buying the potatoes that come shrink wrapped with instructions for microwaving(only 15 minutes!). More expensive, but I was in a hurry and it worked great. I missed the part where it said to put the bacon on the top, so I made a little extra bacon and just mixed it in with everything else. Next time I will also experiment with extra seasonings just for fun. Thanks for the great recipe!

I am a big fan of twice baked potatoes. I have been using the same recipe for years.  I came across this recipe the other day and decided to give it a try tonight as a side dish in our easter dinner.  I'm glad I did. Very delicious potatoes!I did make extra bacon and mixed half of the bacon into the potatoes then used the rest to top.  I made a double recipe so everyone can have 2 servings, thinking they'd be saved until the next day. Boy was I wrong! Everyone at both potatoes plus people were asking for me! Highly recommoned.

I thought this was a very good base recipe. I am a vegetarian so I omited the bacon. I used 3/4 cup low fat sour cream and 3 oz of low fat cream cheese. I omited the milk and reduced the butter to 3 tbsp. I also reduced the green onions by half and added a minced clove of garlic. I dried out the empty shells to make the filling easier. They were tasty!

We made these for Thanksgiving (easy to make ahead of time) and we really loved them. The potato skins were rubbed with butter before baking (step 2), then we omited the bacon and added a bunch of roasted garlic (in step 4). WOW! Thanks for a keeper recipe.

One word, AWESOME!!! After reading the previous reviews about the potatoes being undercooked for one hour, I set my oven on 400 degrees and baked for an hour,they turned out PERFECT!  As I was mixing the sour cream,milk,cheese and other ingredients, I couldn't help but taste the filling, YUMMY!  I then lowered the heat to 350 degrees to finish the potatoes with the cheddar cheese and scallions.  I'm glad I made extra because I'm going to have it for lunch today!*LOL* THANK YOU!!!

Excellent recipe. I've made it as is, and also tweaked it--it's equally good (or even better) with roasted garlic, or cream cheese as added ingredients.

Extremely tasty!  Rubbed the potatoes with vegetable oil before baking and ended up baking them 1 1/2 hours as my potatoes were very large.  After scooping out flesh, cooked skins for a few minutes while preparing filling, makes them a little more sturdy and chewy for eating.  All in all a very good tator!

Yummmy! But take a note, you're going to have to bake the potatoes for at least two hours to get them soft enough where you can scoop out the flesh with ease.  It was rough!  Good stuff!

Made these yesterday, refrigerated overnight, brought back to room temp this morning and heated at 350 for 30 minutes.  What I learned is that the potatoes must be gently mashed together with the other ingredients, and a bit stiff when you spoon it back into the shell.  The cheese and such in the mix adds wetness.  Watch how much milk you add.  My next batch will be perfect.  The flavor is awesome, and I followed this recipe exactly.  Thanks.

There is a reason for all the five star ratings.  These potatoes are terrific. I did rub olive oil on the potato skins before I baked them, so they would not be too dry. I made these for a dinner party and got rave reviews.  Definitely not a recipe for when you are dieting, but great for a special occasion.

These were really very good and quick and easy.
I took some others advice and left out the milk.
I also used clobyjack cheese just on the top and because I was already baking cornish hens in the oven I used the microwave to bake, (whipped mix with a whisk),reheat and melt the cheese on top.
Everything including bagged salad was ready at the same time. hint add ingredients to your taste.

I made these for a dinner party last night and they were outstanding.  I don't care for green onions so I excluded them and the recipe was still great.

This is a GREAT recipe. Add your own touches if you like, but you can't go wrong with the recipe as printed. Very rich, very filling. As far as the skins tearing, using a good baking potato should help prevent the 'jackets' from being too thin.

Very good.  I put the potatoes in the microwave first for 10 minutes.  I also used low fat sour cream.  My husband liked it very much.

Wow!  I made these for Christmas dinner and my family raved over them.  I used extra large idaho potatoes, and instead of halfing them, I cut the tops off and used almost the whole potato.  I had leftover potato mixture and reheated them the next day for a side dish.  Excellent!

Very good and easy to make.  I mixed all the ingredients into the potatoes adding the milk at the end.  As others said, it needed much less milk then called for.

My husband LOVES these potatoes!  I took the suggestion of others by adding less milk.  I used just enough to make the potatoes creamy and smooth.  I also added Ranch dressing, either from an envelope or a bottle.  It gives the potatoes some flare!  Mmmm!

I wanted to give this 4 stars since I liked everything about it.  My family would like more salt (they like salty food) and my son would like less sour cream.  I'll make those changes next time.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used less milk.  They were plently creamy.  Next time I may not use any milk.

These are so good! I didn't have large baking potatoes, so I used 6 medium sized. I just cut the tops off and made little bowls instead of two halves, worked great! The only other things I did different were cut down on the milk by about half, and I added half of the bacon into the potato mixture itself, then sprinkled the other half on top. Delicious!

These were great!!! I did make a few changes. I used a cheddar jack blend instead of cheddar cheese. I also used onion salt instead of regular salt, and reduced the milk content. To save time, I substituted real bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon in a pan. This also eliminated a dish to wash!

Very good.  I had never made twiced baked potatoes and was excited to have them turn out sooo  good.  I used large potatoes, so it took almost 1.5 hrs to cook on 400 degrees to soften them up.

We have this at least once a week and this is our main course!  I completely omit the milk, butter and green onion.  After scooping the potatoes, I add salt, pepper, thick sliced bacon, x-sharp shredded cheddar, hand mash, then top with more bacon and cheese!  So fattening but so good!  My hubby likes me to cook these for about 20-25 minutes so that the potatoes "pancake" (or spread) on the cookie sheet.  One of my hubby's fave's!  Thanks Debra!

Didn't have bacon, green onions or sour cream. Instead I used hormel's real bacon bits, dried chives and went without the sour cream. They were fantastic. Next time I'll make to have the sour cream because that will put it over the top. I made them in the morning and then put them on the grill with the meat I was making to heat them up. So I got the grill baked potato taste without all the time.

This recipe was YUMMY!!!  My boyfriend has never had twice baked potatoes so he didn't know what to expect, but he LOVED them.  The only thing I did different was I added 1/2 of the bacon crumbles to the potato mix and then added the rest for the topping.  This was easy and is great for parties or as a side dish w/ steak.

This recipe is great! I don’t have anything to add, really. It seems like everything’s been said. This recipe is really easy and delicious. Just make sure you bake the potatoes until their centers are soft enough to scoop out with a spoon, or you’ll have a mess! (Mine were almost done, but not quite!) My fiancé loved this as well. Yummy!

These were good.  I halfed the recipe but it needed more butter and cheese for my taste.  I would up a few things but I would make again.

What a treat!  These turned out great!  I have to admit that I took a short cut and used pre-packaged real bacon pieces instead of frying the bacon myself.  But they were still wonderful.  I waited and sprinkled the cheese on the top for the last couple of minutes and I stuck them under the broiler.  They looked and tasted great!

This was great! I added 2 cups of broccoli (cut the florets small) to 2/3 cup of water and 1/4 tsp of salt. Covered and boiled for 3-5 mins (until just tender) and then drained. I prepared the potato mixture as the recipe indicated and after I had combined ingredients using the hand mixer, I then folded in the broccoli. Turned out great!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My hubby loves twice baked potatoes and these were up there with the best.  The only problem I had was waiting too long to bake the potatoes, as they always take longer than an hour if you use the large baking potatoes.

These were pretty good.  I thought they needed a bit more moisture, so I recommend adding another 1/2 cup or more of milk to the mixture.  This recipe can also be varied depending on your topping tastes.

Made them for Christmas Eve and my family loved them - big payback for the small additional effort!  Will cook longer next time if using the same size (they were fairly large).

Excellent!  I've made this 3 times in the last month, always with rave reviews.  I do the second bake on a baking stone and my family eats them skins and all, so I've also made them with smaller potatoes just by approximately doubling the quantity.  (you can adjust this depending on the size potato you are using.) For some reason I always have some leftover filling, but I just put it into a very small ceramic casserole, top it and bake it along with the potatoes.  Delicious!

My entire family likes these, including some very picky children! We’ve had them twice now. First time I followed the recipe as written, second time I mixed all the cheese and green onions into the mixture rather than holding some out to sprinkle on top (I’m a lazy cook). Both ways are delicious.

These are so good!  Local grocery had 5 # bags of potatoes on sale 2/3.00 . I used one bag which held 10 avg sized potatoes. I took some of the hints from others and added bacon & cheese with the potatoes and then gradually added the other ingredients until I got the right consistency , assembled them, topped with cheese & bacon and into the freezer they went. So yummy , on a busy or lazy day to just pop them in the oven.

Our whole family loved it! Very simple to make. I was out of  bacon which can be optional & our potatoes tasted great with or w/o bacon.

This was incredible. Used 4 large BAKING potatoes as stated and subbed the green onion for chives and bacon bits for bacon. My only complaint is after baking 1 1/2 hours they weren’t even close to done. Microwaved for 12 minutes then they finished. Used exact amounts for the milk etc and they weren’t runny at all. Definitely a repeat though next time I think I’ll do as others have and make a huge batch to freeze some as they are time consuming. Not something to make after work as I did lol. Took almost 3 hours to be done where they took so long to cook.

This is a good started stuffed potato recipe. I’ve omitted the milk and added whipping cream instead. I’ve used celery seed instead of celery. You can add anything to the recipe and it turns out good!

I will make these again. Flavor is fabulous.  The only thing I will change is the amount of milk and/or sour cream. My husband mixed the potatoes for me so it could have been user error, but it was to “soupy” for my taste. I like my whipped potatoes stiff.

Came out great. Made in the morning for Christmas dinner. Reheated great for about 30 min before dinner. Used 8 russet potatoes and coated with olive oil before baking. Cut in half (not lengthwise). Stood up in dish and followed recipe. Made 1.5x the recipe. Will definitely be making again :)

So good for a football game! The only thing I did different was oiled and salted my potatoes before step two with brushing  extra virgin olive oil and sprinkling with kosher salt. I think it does a world off difference! Will be my go to recipe!

Probably just my lack of experience, but I have troubles getting this one to turn out perfect every time. Others have suggested baking potatoes, which is a good suggestion but you need to bake them a lot longer the first time. Might even want to bake them longer for any kind of potato to get the right consistency. If you nail this one, it will be the best potato side dish you’ve ever had.

Honestly, I am not the best cook so the recipe  MUST be a good one!  This was enjoyed so much by my family that I tried to convert it to straight mashed potatoes at thanksgiving.... I do NOT suggest doing that. But I am excited to make them again tonight to accompany a few very expensive steaks .

Made these for the first time Friday night for dinner with a big green salad and they were delicious!  I ate 2 servings tho and felt too stuffed probably because they’re mixed with butter, sour cream, milk (I only had buttermilk, so used that) and of course, cheese! I will definitely make again but may lighten up on how much of the dairy I add. These are great leftover the next day! Also, great game day food!

Y'ALL. I added extra bacon and onions because why not, and these are ridiculous! I'm telling you, I have to keep myself from making these too often because we apparently have very little self control. SO GOOD! Making them again this week for my husband's and my anniversary dinner!

The one thing I can tell y’all is to leave a little potato on skin for a firmer body..simply place in fridge while preparing mashed portion..Then when filling they will be firmer..I was a prep cook for 10 yrs at Tumbleweed Tex mex restaurant in Ohio and made this similar version ..

Absolutely delicious.  I didn’t change anything and it was fabulous.  Next time I’ll add a little more salt, but that’s a personal preference.  Add as much milk as you like for the consistency.   My 13 year old nephew loved it so much that he asked for the recipe.  When we grill filets, this is the side dish my boys request.  Thank you for the recipe.

Just made these last night! My first time making twice baked potatoes! Only changes were adding a bit of cream cheese and using a little less milk, as other reviewers recommended. We had company for dinner and served them along with grilled steak and salad. Everyone raved about these potatoes! Thank you for posting this recipe!

I omitted the green onions because my family doesn't care for them. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. it turned out fine but I think I'll do less Greek yogurt next time. it had a pretty strong flavor.

This is my 2nd time making these. My husband and I love them! I follow the recipe exactly. Both times we had steaks on the grill with them. I use a grapefruit spoon to scoop out the flesh. None of mine fell apart.

If you’re just making a small amount, I suggest not cutting the potatoes in half. If you cut the top off (just enough to scoop out the inners) they look a whole lot better. Oh and placing them in a baking dish as you put the topping on for the second round of cooking. Works really great and you don’t waste any toppings.

I rate it a 10 ! They are fabulous ! 
When i heat my oven for something, I usually make it count. I’ll bake at least 10 large potatoes so this makes at least 20 meals, after doubling if course.  You can have them ready for unexpected company, long hard days or a helping hand to someone who’s caring for an aging parent.  Whatever the case,.... they’re in your freezer. 
I dont put the ones I'm freezing, back in the oven the second time. I cool them and put them in the freezer so when I vacuum seal, I’m not crushing them. Yep. Just on a sheet pan uncovered is fine. Just don’t forget about them.  Then when completely frozen, put into a vacuum seal bag, pull all the air and seal.  
Thanks for this spectacular side !

Turned out delicious, but when they say "Large" potatos they actually mean baseball-ish. I got some large potatos and they didn't cook in the hour time...took about 2 hours to cook through. Otherwise everything was great!

I made this and my family thought it was the best they have tasted. I used MEDIUM SIZED Russet potatoes, did some minor changes as well. I coated the potatoes in olive oil and sprinkled them with Kosher Salt completely. I also used chives rather than Green Onions and baked the potatoes at 400 degrees rather than 350 for 1 hour.  I found this to get my skins crispier.  DO NOT scrape them all the way to the skin, you need to leave them about 1/8 - 1/4 inch thick around the inside.


NOTE: you need to use Russet or Idaho potatoes as well. These are high in starch,thicker skinned 
and what makes for the best BAKED POTATOES. I saw some complaints about them being to soft and mushy and I bet they were using something other than a high starch potato. Also cooking times need to be adjusted for the size of the potato.

Nice recipe. I substituted a different mixture of milk products. I used 1 cup of organic buttermilk and 1/2 cup of lactose free sour cream.
I stirred all of the chopped green onions in at the very last to help them stay together better.
No bacon. If you want a stronger cheese, Gruyere is really nice.

Would've been better off just boiling the potatoes and making mashed potatoes, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid. I don't know if you have tiny potatoes or I have huge ones but my potatoes were completely inedible even with extra cook time. We got pizza instead.

These were some of the best Twice Baked we have had. Added a dash of Onion Powder and a dash of Garlic Powder. Recipe by itself was excellent.

This is one of the best recipes around for Twice Baked Potatoes. Each time I make them remember how great they are.
I always make them just as the recipe is written and no complaints from anyone. Nothing i would change
A definite keeper despite taking a bit of time but if you are organized, it's a snap!

I feel as though it’s too long to bake the potatoes, when they came out they were soft but to the point that the skin was bubbles away from the flesh. Could have just been a mistake on my part though and the mix seemed good.

These are great!  I always bake up a whole bag of potatoes at one time.  Prepare as twice baked and freeze them.  It is so nice to be able to remove how ever many  are needed, thaw in the frig. and serve with a ham steak or whatever .  Thanks for the great recipe.
Update:  Last time I baked 10 lbs of potatoes, once potatoes were baked I dug out most of the potatoe and left the skins with a thin layer of potatoe.  Froze the mashed potatoes seperate from the skins.  Now I can have; twice baked, mashed or potatoe skins.  This worked great! Last night we had potatoe skins stuffed with a chicken mixture and lots of cheese on top.  One more variation for the menu from the freezer.  Thank you so much for sharing the idea of freezing twice baked potatoes.

Very good recipe. I substituted heavy whipping cream for the milk and it was a mistake I think. The extra fat in the cream made them a bit runny/greasy. Next time I’ll just use milk.

Turned out very good. Took a lot longer to bake in the first step than stated. Added some garlic powder and parsely. I think I'll add more cheese next time. Overall, it was very good.

I made these last night, they turned out fantastic. I did run into a problem with the potatoes, The 350 degrees didn't seem to be cooking them for the hour. So, I put a couple more in for an hour at 400 and those turned out fantastic. 

I don't think I pierced the first batch deep enough (my mistake.) Otherwise, everyone loved them, they were so good everyone ate every single portion. I added 1/2 a block of cream cheese to mine, but they were a hit.

I followed the recipe as written and my family loved it. My daughter kept asking me to make again and again. Now, I add different cheeses like smoked Gouda and havarti. I also add some fresh herbs to the mixture; thyme, rosemary and sage. I chop them up fine. Since we love garlic, I now include 1 crushed garlic clove. After baking the potatoes I do score the inside and gently scrape the flesh with a serrated spoon. The smell of them baking is mouth-watering!

These are crazy good.  I used a five cheese blend.  For the topping I mixed it all together and gently packed it on top.  I will be using this recipe again but with just a bit more salt

I have made these twice now and my whole family loves them. I used huge russet potatoes so they take a lot longer to cook. This is now a family favorite. My family was so happy to eat something new for a change.

The 11 year old had thirds! :) Make sure you put the mix in a zip lock bag for easy “spooning” back in to the potato’s. ... I personally cook things till “they look like I want to eat them”. Took about 23-25 minutes. Absolutely DELICIOUS!

Fantastic Taters!  I made it but reduced the milk to half what was called for, so 1/4 cup. Perfect.  They were gobbled up and one of my guests even asked if he could take one home.  Plus they even looked good with the scallions, bacon, and cheese as toppings.
Thanks for the recipe.  It's in our rotation of best recipes.

Will definitely make these again. I used bacon bits from the store and added the cream cheese as one person did. They were very good.

Great recipe!! I made these to go with our Christmas ham meal. I would have been happy with just one of these creamy delicious  potatoes for my dinner and nothing else.

OMG! So super yummy!! The only change I made was that I doubled the recipe and I used 1 1/2 c sour cream & 6 oz of cream cheese. They turned out perfect!!! Can't wait to make this wonderful recipe again!

Excellent recipe.  I generally followed this recipe.  Making it again tonight.  The only changes I would make include.  

No need to puncture potatoes before baking.  I have never done this and don't believe there is a genuine need.

The majority of ingredients are included in the mixture, especially the bacon, onion and cheese.  I leave out only a minimal amount for the sake of garnish (appearance). 

I don't tear the bacon by hand, preferring a butcher knive to chop it up into smaller pieces.

That's about it.  Again, wonderful recipe.  Easy but takes a little time.

These are good, but I found them to be a lot of work for not a lot of reward. Maybe if I tried cooking the bacon and potatoes in the microwave to speed things up before making, then it might be worth it. Otherwise there are just too many steps and it takes too long.

I followed the recipe to a T and it came out fantastic! These twice baked potatoes were well worth the effort and paired fantastic with baked pork chops  and BBQ baked beans. Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe with yummy results. Have a new oven, so don't know if that's the problem but my potatoes did not get done in an hour. Had too much trouble trying to get them scooped out, so wound up just making them in a casserole dish. Still great and easier!

I made these once for my family and now I am asked to make them for every family function. My only change was to add a half packet of hidden valley ranch Dips. It gave it a big flavor boost.

Amazing recipe.  I added shrimp, spinach and used three types of cheese. Parmesan, mixed blind and cheddar.  Great base recipe for twice baked or prefect as is.

I made this last night and it was a hit with both my husband and son.  I did add 2 extra tablespoons of butter and doubled the cheese after tasting it (before baking).  This is one of those side dishes that everyone raves about and they forget about the main dish.  So good.

These potatoes are awesome. I did tweak the recipe a bit. Also I cooked the potatoes in the microwave then scooped the potato out and put the shell in the oven to crisp while mixing the potatoes.  Instead of sour cream I added tzatzaki, fresh parsley, basil and garlic.  Delicious.

I was in a hurry; baking the potatoes for 1 hour would have taken too long. So, what I did, is putting the potatoes for 15 minutes into the microwave and it worked! Another thing I changed is that I used cream cheese instead of sour cream.

I thought they were a little bland, but most people I served them to loved them. So maybe I'll experiment with seasonings next time.

Ive made this a handful of times. Learned a few things on the way. Read other reviews!! I wrap my potatoes in foil and place in toaster over at 400 after about 1 1/2 hours when they feel soft they are done. Trust me, you want them soft. You also want to use large potatoes. When scraping out potato leave a bit on the edges and bottom so they won’t “break”. I cook a whole package of bacon then crumble all of it up. No one complains about too much bacon. You can even leave these in fridge. Easy to throw them in the microwave for a quick snack. Oh and I just put a bunch of cheese, no need to measure.  This is NOT a low fat side! Thanks for the recipe. They don’t last long in our house.

Love this recipe. Family asks for it every holiday dinner. We add garlic for a bit more flavor. Someone suggested easing up on the milk. I disagree otherwise the potato is so dense. Light and fluffy with richness is what you get if you follow the recipe. Reheats well in the oven too Incase you have leftovers. I try to make extra, but never end up with any. It’s that yummy. Best twice baked potato recipe I’ve tried thus far. No need to lol further.

Made these tonight and they are AMAZING!  My daughter, who “hates” sour cream was hesitant, but then cleaned her plate in record time.  My only note is that my big potatoes did NOT cook in an hour... I put them back in for another 15 minutes and still weren’t fully soft.  Next time I’ll up the oven temp for that first hour.

Very good and easy recipe. I didn't use the oven to bake them, but used the Instant Pot instead. I also mixed in half the bacon and cheese to the potato flesh before spooning back in. I think that made the full potato more delicious rather than only having bacon & chsses on the top.
Otherwise I think this is an excellent and easy recipie

Delicious! Don't change a thing. Just be careful not to get to crazy trying to scoop out every little bit of flesh from the potato or you will run the risk of destroying the skin. Leave a little bit in the skin to be safe.

First time making this, I think they turned out very good. The potatoes took a little more than an hour I assume it’s because of the size.

The taste of this recipe was fabulous, however, the filling I created for the center became more runny than I would have liked. The next time I make this I will half the additional ingredients for the filling in hopes of correcting my failure. The taste and timing on this recipe is perfect though.

Instead of the sour cream and milk I used 1/2 Cup of Heavy Cream.  Also used OM bacon bits instead of regular bacon.
Everyone liked them.  I still think it's a lot of work and not sure if it's something I want to continue to always make.  2nd time  attempting these and having a hard time scooping out the insides without damaging the sides.  Messed up 3 of the ten made.

Outstanding! For those who don’t like sour cream, substitute about the same amount of mayonnaise or a less sour version of sour cream such as Crème fraîche.

To make this vegan, omit bacon and use substitutes for sour cream, butter, milk, and cheese. There are vegan bacon recipes out there if you want to go the extra mile. The brands we use for substitutes: Tofutti vegan sour cream, Earth Balance butter, Silk almond milk, and Daiya cheddar cheese. I added onion powder and used the mixer to blend the ingredients for the filling. Daiya vegan cheese tastes good, but doesn’t blend or melt easily. Having the cheese broken up and distributed by the blender helps with consistency and melting. Instead of topping with more cheese, I topped with paprika and dill. It was a hit! None of this one to put away after Thanksgiving. It was all gone!

These are awesome! I too made them ahead of time & refrigerated. Also, I used the microwave to initially cook the the large baking potatoes (about 6 min). Thx to all those who recommended leaving about 1/4 inch of the flesh intact. I too used less sour cream & milk. Just added what I wanted to get the right consistency. I also added chopped garlic. Yum!

Love this recipe. I usually add more sour cream and butter and less milk. My family eats them all right up. Great recipe, we just add more butter and sour cream for our preference.

One hour was not enough to bake the potato, 1 1/2 minimum. Otherwise it was quite tasty, make sure when you warm them up they are in a smaller dish so they prop each other up.

Absolutely loved these, they turned out amazing!! My husband & our roommate were in their glory! Only thing I did differently was I boiled the potatoes about 15 minutes before putting them in the oven. Will definitely be making these again!

Great recipe!  I only made adjustments because of my ingredients on hand.  I had 4 leftover baked in the fridge.  I gutted them cold and hoped it would be okay.  Had fancy real bag of hormel bacon bits.  I used about 3/4 cup.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  Great flavor and my family loved it!

I have always been hesitant about doing twice baked potatoes.  I didn’t have baking potatoes, so I used what I had on hand: russet potatoes.  Still, these were super easy to make and made the BEST potatoes I’ve ever eaten!

I always try to make things as streamlined as possible, as the mother of 4 with a more than full time regular  job.  While the potatoes baked (I wet them and coated them lightly in sea salt for a crispier skin), I put the filling ingredients in a gallon ziplock bag (including all the bacon, which I bought precooked and chopped)and left it on counter to soften butter.  After cooling baked potatoes I used a melon ball scoop to extract the potato interior.  I added that to the ziplock bag and mixed the ingredients by hand (I love kneading bread,etc), by just massaging the contents of the bag and breaking up potato chunks.  As another person suggested, I cut the corner of the ziplock off and piped the filling in and continued with the recipe instructions.  Throw away the ziploc bag & no bowl or mixer parts to clean.  And if you put foil down on baking sheet you don't have to clean it and can also use it to keep potatoes hot if you aren't ready when they are!

I made it just as written. Tasted good. My family did not oh and awe as I hoped they would. For me, this was a lot of work. I struggled scooping out the potatoes without poking through despite trying different sized spoons and a melon scoop. The ones I did not poke through had so much original potato in the shell that it tasted dry because it had less of the mixture. Overall, too much work for so so outcome.

I made it exactly as written. YUMMY! My 8 year old twins loved it too. They thought it tasted like a sour cream and onion potato chip. (Which makes sense.)
Make sure the potatoes are well baked. Some of my larger potatoes weren't quite done and ended up splitting apart when I scooped them out.

Made these for dinner. I cut the sour cream in half for my preference. My kids absolutely loved them. Next time, I will season my skins and saute onion and garlic to add to the mashed. Great recipe to play with!

These twice backed potatoes are delicious! 
I brushed them with EVOO before baking to give them a little extra crispy goodness. I also cut the amount of sour cream way down - I only used a little dollop of it since I don't care for it.
These turned out so flavorful and satisfying. We will definitely have them again.

These are to die for!  A decent amount of work and time go into them.  Definitely use baking potatoes.  For the sour cream, I used sour cream that I had already mixed Hidden Valley Ranch Harvest Dill Dip Mix into it.  The flavor was delicious.  My husband is still talking about these, a month later.  Next time I make them I will follow other suggestions to make them up ahead of time and freeze them, that would cut down tremendously on the work.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

loved these, the only change I made was I put the potato mixture into ramekins instead of using the potato skins to bake

Very good. I hate waiting an hour for potatoes to bake. So, I used my Potato Express bag. It only takes 5 minutes and makes perfect potatoes. I scooped out the filling and baked in the oven for the final 15 min.
I preferred probably half less sour cream. It made it a bit rich for my taste. Otherwise, delish!

Got rave reviews! Only change was that I didn't have bacon on hand but had prosciutto which worked great but I'm sure the regular bacon would be as good.

Great recipe. To make scooping out the flesh easier I used a melon baller. *Update* These are so good and easy to make. I make several ahead of time, freeze and bake for the second time when ready to serve.

Potatoes are NOT ready in just an hour. I wish the author gave the correct baking time so I wouldn't have to waste the next two hours trying to get them to be soft enough to scoop, and then have them turn out mediocre and dry. Wasted too much time on this. At least next time I'll know what to do differently

My family and I loved this receipe. My daughter is a potatoe-addict and she typically does not eat her whole meal at dinner but when we made this dish she finished her meal and went back for seconds on the potatoes. She also had them for lunch. This receipe is a keeper.

I modified the recipe to make more than the original. I think I added too much butter or sour cream as they spread quite a bit and kind of fell out of the potato shells.But everyone loved them! Will make again.

Baked for one hour at the recommended temp. The potatoes were not near done, and when I tried to scoop out the flesh the skin started to tear. Might just be my oven. I'll try again and bake the first phase longer.

These were good, but a little too soft and too creamy. Next time I will decrease the sour cream and milk amounts to make the consistency a little thicker.

Super bomb recipe!

I added 2 diced jalapeños, and I used red potatoes which i boiled and then mashed and mixed everything. Then I scoop the potato mixture into colorful single serving ceramic bowls and bake @350F for 20 mins!!

Like Crack!! Just cant stop eating this stuff!

I'm no health nut by any means, but I don't think you need so much fat to make this recipe taste good - I will cut the bacon and butter in half the next time I make these.  Very good just the same.  Thank you for the recipe.

Loved them. I made a change to mine though. I didn't have enough sour cream in the fridge.  Instead I added a 1/2 of cup of ranch which worked.  My family loved them so I'll definitely be making these again, but this time try it with the sour cream and put them in 20 minutes.

Awesome!  I didn't even put it back in the "shells".  I put it all in a casserole dish with cheese and green onions on top.  Covered with foil and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  Scrumptious!  Did add in 4 oz of Cream Cheese.

I thought the filling was too loose and lacked flavor, definitely needed much more salt and pepper.

Really good! The only thing I changed was since I had heavy cream, I used that instead of milk. I think I used a little too much because it didn't hold it's shape like I thought it would. More like mashed potatoes. But still delicious!

I used real bacon bits in the potatoes that are mixed with the sour cream and put back into the potatoes. Really good and I didn't have to cook the greasy bacon.

I got so many compliments after taking this as a side dish to a New Years party. My kids are already asking for it again and it has only been 3 days! :)

Very good recipe, my whole family enjoyed these.  My potatoes were pretty large and needed to cook a little longer. I just used a fork to mash everything and we liked the chunkier texture.   Next time I will add a little more salt to the mixture.  Other than that, great!

We loved it, but cut back on the milk a little. Just added while mixing until the consistency seemed right. I left the mixture a little bit chunky and mixed about half the bacon into it. I like the idea of making a bunch and freezing for later.

I used Fat Free sour cream in this recipe so, that may be the reason for my rating.  The mixture  was very  "soupy"  --- I would have preferred it a little more of a mashed potato texture. Also,  if you make this recipe, do not let the potatoes get too cool after baking --- the  potatoes take much longer to mash up if they get too cold!

These turned out really good although the potatoes I  used had too much starch in the potato itself so I ended up boiling some white potatoes and mashing those for the inside they were delicious everybody raved about them I would definitely make them again ! 
 And like other people have commented I would not add the milk until the end  to make sure you need the extra liquid to make them fluffy

We omitted the onions, I didn't add any chopped up the bacon into the filling.  Also, at the end of the first baking cycle, we increased the temp to 500 to prepare for the prime rib and left the potatoes in the oven to crisp the outside. Worked like a charm!  Best twice baked potatoes ever, per my dinner guests.  Will definitely make again soon!

Excellent recipe.  I made these last year for Christmas Day and they were easy to make and a hit with everyone  so I'm making them again.  Suggestion:  Make them the day before and then just pop them in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes and serve.

Basically a good basic recipe Only comment I have is to NOT wrap the potatoes in foil to bake. The skin will hold up better to complete the process of making this recipe. The foil on the potatoes makes the skin softer and less easy to work with.

Using smaller russets? Rub a light coat of olive oil on each potato, sprinkle with kosher salt, and wrap in foil. Place directly on the oven rack. After you've baked them, remove from foil and place on cooling rack. After they have cooled off 10-15 minutes, the skin will crisp up a little so they won't tear when you scoop the flesh out.  I used a melon baller which worked PERFECTLY for smaller potatoes. Oh, and I also added half of the crumbled bacon into the mixture.  YUM!!

Very good, but I wouldn't serve again like the picture. Probably in a casserole dish. My potato skin got a little tough, but like the other reviews the mashed potato mixture was the bomb.

Very good! i substituted the sour cream for cream cheese and the milk for half and half milk. I also added silantro to the potato mix.

I made this for church. I boiled the potatoes instead of baked (10#).  Just tossed in rest to mix. Lots of compliments. It's a keeper.

I do terrible at keeping the skins whole, so I've basically turned it into a casserole. I follow the same recipe but rather than put them back in the skins I just put them in a baking pan for the last 15 min.

Another restaurant quality dish I got off all recipes. This was outstanding. I oiled up the potatoes before I put them in the oven so the shells got nice and crispy. Was very easy To make and I received compliments from everyone who tried them.

Just made these tonight and they were delicious! I added a packet of lipton dry vegetable soup, and did 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese, shredded cheese and crumbled bacon (left over from this mornings breakfast) I cut some fresh chives from my herb garden, and snipped them up into tiny pieces added to the mix. Leaving some of the potato in the skin and remaking for 15 minutes made it perfect. Thank you to the reviewer who recommended using a meatball scooper, it made getting the potato out easy and saved the skins.  Scooped the mix back into the potato boats, topped with shredded cheese, crumbled bacon and snipped chives.
My son took his 1st bite and said "WOW!" with my husband following suit. This is now on my favorites list!

first time I ever made this type of potatoes.  I will definately make this again!  I only recommend making sure the potatoes are done as I needed much extra cooking time than an hour.  But other than that it was excellent!  Thank you for the recipe!

This a great recipe for twice baked potatoes! I turned my oven to 350 as suggested and cooked for an hour, and when time was up, the potato was just a wee bit hard when I cut it so I tossed it in the microwave for a few minutes. Cooking time will vary depending on your oven and the size of potato. Oh, I didn't cut the potato in half-I just cut the top off which makes a really good shell for the pulp mixture. I just eyeballed the milk, sour cream and butter.  I totally love cheese so I just went to town on it! I would definitely make this again and again. Thank you so much for this!!

For mine I didn't add bacon or green onions only because my bacon was in the freezer and I didn't have green onions on hand. I added chives and paprika for seasonings and it turned out wonderful. The only thing that I will say is that maybe 1  cup of sour cream was way too much and next time ill only be using 1/2 cup at most.

I doubled this recipe for a family function. I added the butter and sour cream to the potatoes and mixed them in. Then I added only enough milk until the consistency was right. I left out the green onions in half the potatoes for the onion haters. The adults enjoyed these potatoes, but the children didn't seem to care for them.

I used russet potatoes and baked them on the rack to let the skins get crispy. That's the only adjustment I made. This was a hit! My family rated it a 10 out of 10 and have asked me to make them again. I made them yesterday haha. This is definitely being added to my repertoire!

These were the best twice baked spuds I've ever made. I made them for Easter for a crowd of 25.  This was a wonderful dish to do ahead of time which freed up time to clean my house the day before.  Plus once I knew I had too many I was able to pop them in the freezer for my family to enjoy another time.  It will probably replace my favorite cheese potato recipe from my mother-in-law with real potatoes, bacon, cheddar & onions.

Good.  Baked potatoes (rubbed with EVOO and kosher salt) at 400 for 1 hour - no foil.  Mixed bacon in with potato filling.

This is has become one of my go to recipes now.  Everyone whom I have served them to generally will eat the potato first before they get to the other items on their plate. I made them just as directed.

I fried the skins to give them more crunch, I also microwaved the potatoes until they were done and I used a bag of hormel real bacon bits.  It cut prep time down considerable. Turned out Fabulous, the kids loved them.

These were definitely good. The instructions don't specify, but I would recommend rubbing the potatoes with oil & salt & piercing them with a fork prior to baking. I mixed the bacon into the filling, reserving a bit to put on top. Next time I'll actually use a little more bacon (I was using HUGE potatoes). It still felt like it was missing something though. Maybe more butter? I might even try using some ranch powder in the mix next time.

Made these for Christmas dinner to go with our prime rib. They were delicious. Left off green onions as kids don't like. Otherwise followed recipe. My husband said "you shouldn't make potatoes any other way". Will make these often!   Thanks for. Sharing your recipe.

I did not make any changes. It was very good. It took a bit to learn how to get the potato out of the skins but I got it pretty quickly. It was so good some of my family went back for more. We will enjoy making this again.

I brush my baked potatoes with olive oil, sprinkle sea salt on them and wrap in tin foil. I didn't with these and found the skin to be a little bland. I added roasted garlic to the filling and it was great. I will definitely make them again.

These were good but too salty and a little too runny. Omit the additional salt (the cheese and bacon add enough) and reduce the added milk by half. I used russets and fork-pricked them before baking and they worked out well. One reviewer suggested adding cream cheese to the mixture and that would probably be good to try.

I made this yesterday for our Christmas Eve dinner, and it  was a huge hit!  I used about two tablespoons of dried chives instead of the onions.   I also used Russet potatoes instead of baking potatoes, and I wouldn't recommend doing that.  After an hour of baking, the potatoes still were hard and I had to microwave them for a little.  Next time, I'll listen to the recipe and use baking potatoes!

You can make this dish a day or two ahead of time. Do not bake it. After topping with bacon and cheese, just cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator.  take it out of the refrigerator and let it sit out at room temperature for about one hour or a little longer. This will cut down on baking time. Bake about 1.25 hours but watch them.  Spoon the mixture into plastic bag, snip corner of bag and squeeze  to fill potato skins.

Pretty good. My first time making baked potatoes at all, so I had to look up whether or not I needed to use aluminum/flip them/etc as it wasn't included in the recipe. Over all tasted awesome when finished.

very yummy to be served alongside any main dish. I added garlic powder and lots of paprika to my potato mixture. Unlike other reviewers, i had no problem with keeping the skin intact---you just have to be careful. will make this again. a big hit in my household!

I've made these for holidays for at least 3 years now.  A couple changes and tips might help:
Bake the potatoes at 425 for an hour and 10 min
Put the potatoes in the fridge to cool while I prepare the other ingredients.
Mix everything into the potatoes.
Use a knife to loosen the flesh 1/4-1/8 inch from the skin so it won't tear.
Put potato mixture in a Ziploc and pipe it into the skins.

Hope this helps!

I made this dish for a Sunday afternoon football game.  It was delicious!  Instead of topping the potatoes with the onions, cheese and bacon I added it into the potato mixture then topped it with just a little more cheddar cheese.  Will definitely make these again!

The secret to firm skins which withstand the scooping process is to NOT wrap them in foil; oil + salt and bake is all they need. Foil will keep the skins moist and soft, which is undesirable.

Instead of baking the potatoes, I pricked them with a fork and microwaved them for 10 minutes (turning over halfway through).  Just make sure your filling isn't too loose ornit will run out when cut into.

I have made these several times now without changing a thing on the recipe, and they are just too good.  Make sure to not scoop out to much flesh near the skin of the potato, which you're going to want to do, but don't do it.  A thick layer at the bottom keeps the potato intact, and there is so much flavor going on top you won't be left with a bland potato.  Trust me.  These are quite filling though, so don't plan for too many sides.

I have been making these for over 20 years and usually a few times a month as my family loves them. For my potatoes I only buy the huge russett potatoes and after I wash them I baste them with a little bit of olive oil and season them with bucks seasoning or whatever I'm in the mood for. My children who never ate the skin now ask for everyone elses skin. When It is time to scoop out the potato I cut a diamond shape in the top of the potatoes about 3 inches long by 2 inches wide. It gives you plenty of room to scoop them and when you fill them I always top it coming out of the potatoes so you don't even see it. I have also try some different add-ins. I use tiny broccoli florets,  I've used tiny bits of mushrooms, cream cheese and I have a potato topper that I mix in as well as sprinkle on top of the cheese and Bacon. My kids absolutely love these and I always make about 15 so I can vacuum pack them and freeze them. I am cooking these now so I will post a pic of what I mean when they are finished.

Everyone LOVES these potatoes!   I learned to make them years ago and the key to keeping the skin in-tact is rubbing the skin with Crisco or spraying with Pam.  And definitely do not wrap the potatoes in foil.

Love the recipie no matter how much I make it always disapears! Everyone loves it and the recipie is good as it is; but if you need to make changes it still works wonderful. You can make it as a side or main and either works great. It can be a meal to fix while your moveing and busy all day,or a meal for a verry special ocasion. Its all your choice, and all choices are fantastic or should i say( fantisicly yummy) :)

love twice baked potatoes. We owned a steak house & made twice baked all of the time. Just a hint about baking the potatoes. Scrub them well, dry, then rub with small amount of vegetable shortening. Place on baking sheet & bake 1 hour. Allow to cool enough to cut in two lengthwise & scoop out flesh. Add butter, sour cream & ranch dressing. Mix well & stuff back in to skins. Top with favorite toppings & bake until cheese is melty & slightly browned. Baking the potatoes in this way makes the skins nice & firm & crispy.

Slightly time consuming but well worth every second. Always a hit .. Can't get enough of them myself . I'd definitely use baking potatoes as I've tried them with all kinds and the skins just don't hold up as well

These were excellent! I made a few changes. I'm the only one in my family who likes bacon, so I just topped mine before the 2nd bake with Hormel real bacon bits. Everything else went into the mix. We added shredded cheese on top for the 2nd bake. I don't like my potatoes mushy, so I skipped the milk. We think potatoes need garlic, so I used garlic butter I made with fresh minced garlic from my garden. (If you like garlic but don't want it really strong, roast some while potatoes bake.) And I just used a fork to mix it all up; no need for a hand mixer (which would probably only work with the milk in it anyway).

The only change I made was not to add bacon. Not that I didn't WANT the bacon... Who doesn't want bacon?!?!
I just didn't have any on hand... That being said, these were INCREDIBLE!!!
So next time I make them & I actually add the bacon... My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!

Twice baked potatoes are one of my favorites! Another trick is coating the outside with olive oil pre bake, helps make the skin nice and crispy and easy to scoop out!

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was easy and simple to make and included easy directions. The only changes I made was adding regular onions instead of green onions which added more flavor. The dish turned out great otherwise and I would defiantly make it again. The only thing I would note is to make more time to cook the potatoes, they took about an hour in the oven.

Very good! Decided to toss the limp potato skins & bake in ramekins. Made ahead & so that I could take out & bake as needed. Very convenient! Mixture was a bit dry; had fresh whipped cream in the fridge & added to moisten the dish. Turned out amazing!!! Don't know if it should be considered a side dish or dessert

Good recipe. I've made twice baked potatoes before so I already knew that you need to use a large russets and bake them very thoroughly. Then you've got to let them cool pretty well so that they can be handled easily during the scooping. For my taste they needed more salt, and I would have buttered the skins and wrapped the potatoes in foil for baking.

Extremely yummy!! The whole family enjoyed multiple helpings! I was in a bit of a hurry, so I cut out some of the cook time by microwaving the potatoes. I pierced each potato first. Then I drizzled each with olive oil, garlic salt and pepper, before wrapping each individually in wax paper. Aside from that little change, I followed the rest to a T!

Very yummy! Only change I made was to add some bacon to the potato flesh. That way you got a little bacon in every bite. You can never have enough bacon!

I made these for my husband and they turned out really good. They were pretty tasty.  I've never made these before, so scooping out the potatoes from the first time baking was hard and the potatoes fell apart, but what fell apart, I stuffed into the others since it was just the two of us.

Great!  Thanks for the recipe.  My potatoes took longer to bake than the recipe said but that was the only "problem" I found.  Family loved them.

I added the milk last as well and mixed the cheese in with the filing. Divine! I will be making large batches of these to freeze and add as a side during the week for dinner!

Bake potatoes for 1 hour 20 minutes and they are perfect.  One hour isn't long enough and the skin rips.  Very good recipe and very easy!

Love this recipe. I altered it by adding diced Roma tomatoes and putting them on top of the bacon and scallions, then topped with the cheddar. Everyone raved! Making these again today. The tomatoes give it a much fresher taste.

these came out great. but I recommend pre heating oven to @ least 400 degrees otherwise it may taken longer than an hour to soften potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly for the mash & it tasted fantastic!! would def make this again.

Great recipe. I rub my potatoes with olive oil, stab with a fork here and there (so steam is released and potato skins are crisp), sprinkle with sea or kosher salt and bake at 400 degrees for 45 min + depending on size of potatoes.  I cut 1/3rd off lengthwise and use the large 2/3rd to stuff and the 1/3rd for appetizers.

I'm really disappointed. I wanted to make these SO bad and when I took potatoes out if the oven, scooped them out, they didn't mash. They were still too hard and I nuked them a bunch if times to no avail but it never got the mashed potato consistency I wanted. I think it might be because I threw them in my oven without it being all the way to 350 but I did leave then in for an hour. So disappointed, but I will do these again. Next time ill even boil the guts if I have to!

I liked this recipe - it was my first attempt at twice baked potatoes but they turned lot pretty tasty. After completing it, I should have added more sour cream and less bacon. Overall, worth trying out!

Made the recipe last night, almost exactly, just left out butter and milk and only mashed the centers with sour cream alone. It was moist enough. This recipe is fantastic. It might seem like one of those "you can do it without the recipe" kinds of things but I NEVER would have guessed to mash them with sour cream and re-bake. Everyone saw them on their plate when served and eyes lit up like it was Christmas!!! My daughter ate one half and said "too bad you don't make these all the time" ... well, I can make them a lot more often now that I know how!!!! Sometimes the simplest things are the best, this is one of those times! Instead of wrapping potatoes in foil and baking I lightly greased them with vegetable oil (a trick my grandma taught me) Thanks for a fantastic recipe, and I don't think me omitting milk or butter is enough ground to re-write and publish a recipe, claiming it as my own, I am sure mine tasted exactly how they should have :)

Tasted so good.  My potatoes were medium size and so 1 hour in the oven was plenty of time.  I mixed everything together including the bacon and added cream instead of milk as I had some to use up.  I prepared everything beforehand and then just put cheese on top and bunged in the oven 30 minutes before the steaks went on the grill.  Yum!

I'm asked to make this almost weekly, everyone devours these! I've used large potatoes and smaller russet potatoes, the larger ones are better but if you only have small one on hands, go ahead and use em (except add 2 extra ones to get enough filling). I add 4oz cream cheese, extra cheddar (I never measure it out I just dump some in) and use bacon bits to save time. You will not be disappointed!

The idea of freezing the leftovers sounds wonderful...But my family loves these so much that there's never any left over! Excellent recipe, and one of the few that I don't make any changes to. Perfect just the way it is! :-)

I used this ingredients for years and decided to write a review for it. For full disclosure I removed butter, salt, and pepper and still had a tasty meal. Sure the time is a little long to make but it is worth making it then enjoying the meal afterwords.
The ultimate twice baked potatoes are great re-heated and work for any meal. I enjoy a cooked egg on top of the re-heated twice baked potatoes.

Great recipe. Potatoes are fantastic. Only thing done differently was to broil the potatoes at the end just to get a little color on the top. These freeze great.

Very creamy and delicious. I used thick cut bacon to give it a little more substance and flavor.

Made these with some BBQ Ribs... Awesome flavor!  They were a hit!  I may even use the mixture for regular mashed potatoes as well!

These freeze wonderfully!  We usually double the recipe and then freeze them in quart size freezer bags - two halves in each bag.   However, it works even better if you put them on a cookie sheet first and put them in the freezer for about a half hour BEFORE putting into the bags.

These potatoes were good, but I cook them longer than one hour at a lower temperature. It makes them softer. Also, I add less milk and more cheese.

I halved the recipe (so 2 potatoes). On 350, the potatoes took about 80 minutes, but could probably have come out at 75 (tried at 60 and they weren't quite ready), as one burst a little bit. My mixture needed the milk (I saw others were saying it made it soupy, but I didn't experience that), but maybe it's because I mixed mine by hand, not with a mixer (didn't want them too starchy). They were good and all, but a lot of time and work for what wasn't a whole lot better than most other potato recipes. I'd try a different twice-baked recipe next time - something with spices or vegetables or something more flavorful than just what amounts to a loaded baked potato. oh, and there were too many green onions.

This recipe is amazing. When I use it my potatoes come out perfect every time. Only thing is the bake time; mine take around an extra half hour at 350 degrees. I will never use another baked potato recipe because this one is just perfect :)

Amazing flavor! Had guests come over and they loved them! Will defiantly be using this recipe again. I didn't take all of the flesh out of the skin and left about 1/2 inch inside the skin to make it keep it's shape when I filled them with the potato mixture. That helped with filling it and the skin didn't fall apart because it had the potato holding it together.

I made these last night and they were awesome. I added 1/2 c of heavy cream and 1/4c of cream cheese. They were moist and creamy. Loved them!! Will definitely keep this in my recipe box.

definitely ease up on the milk. I recommend easing up on the sour cream too. That's a ridiculously indulgent amount; completely unnecessary. Halve it.

These are so addicting. I always follow the recipe exactly and they are perfect every time (ok I add a bit more bacon but who doesn't?!).. These have become a staple in my house, I cannot rave about them enough! .. I especially love to pair them with the Lobster Colorado recipe also on this site.

Absolutely fantastic! As a "potato junkie" I love making different varieties of this exact recipe:
Switch bacon for sausage (Hormel makes an awesome pre cooked "pizza topping" sausage that comes in a bag)
Or try different cheeses; pepper jack, white cheddar- be creative! They always come out awesome!
I also love whipping in fresh finely chopped garlic! Delish!

Everyone loves it! The only thing I do different - because I like a smooth texture, is I peel and boil the potatoes for the mashing part, and bake the potatoes that I am using for the shell. I also tend to use more sour cream...just keep tasting it as you add it.

Absolutely delicious! I was making a large quantity for a family dinner so I mixed all the cheese and bacon into the mashed potato mix. I served the green onions on the side. I used white pepper instead of black pepper. I also used plain yogurt in place of sour cream and chicken stock in place of milk to lighten them up just a bit. I added the stock last gradually so I could get the perfect consistency. Our family loved them, even picky young ones who don't eat mashed potatoes. This recipe is a keeper!

Made these for over 20 years. We like to OVER STUFF the potatoes.. I simply bake extra potatoes to add to the mixture and discard the skins of the extra ones. This way you can  leave more potato on the skins and the skins will stay firm..............Being from Louisiana where we love crayfish, I sometimes plate the potato in a bowl and ladle with crawfish ettoufee and it becomes an entree instead of a side dish. Shrimp or crabmeat can be substituted.

These were amazing! The only issue I had was preventing the potato skins from falling apart (being too tender). I always microwave mine for 2 minutes each, then wrap in foil and bake at 350 for an hour. It works great for a nice soft baked potato, but maybe my technique needs to change in order to provide a skin that will hold up better?

Loved it!  Next time I would mix the bacon in to the potato mix before the second baking.  The bacon added a nice flavor but once you got through the topping, the delicious combination was gone.  Replacing Thanksgiving mashed potatoes with these single-serve potato options :) Making a batch for 16.

I used large russet potatoes, left out the milk & chives and used about 3 semi large tablespoons of Chez Whiz instead of shredded cheese. my 5 yr old son who never has anything specific to say about anything he eats said it was his new favorite food and he ate 2 of them skin and all! my husband loved them and said i had to have bought them from the frozen section they're just too good! =) ALSO! Instead of baking i microwaved for about 12-14 minutes and it was perfect after baking for 15 at 350 as stated. Very yummy!

Very good! To cut down on the time, I used the pre-packaged bacon pieces and "Express Bake PotatOH!" that is pre-wrapped, microwaveable, and is cooked 7-8 minutes per potato. The skin kept its consistency too, as like others suggested, I did not scoop it completely out. The ease of making them and the taste was unbelievable! Great for a spare of the moment side dish!

The recipe was very easy to follow, and relatively cheap to make. Needed more sour cream in my opinion but they turned out to be quite nice regardless.

Make sure you cook the potatoes well enough. I had chunky potatoes and ended up just making mashed potatoes. If your potatoes are large, cook them for way longer than directed.

Years ago when we were dating I fixed a meal for my current husband that included frozen twice baked potatoes. That is the only item from the meal that either of us remember, and they made a big impression on DH. Now that I "really" cook, I was delighted to find a recipe that tasted even better than those potatoes of our memories! Thank you PONYGIRL64 for sharing.

Very good! I leave a thick rim of potato around the skin when scooping out to make a sturdy shell. I also don't use a mixer but mash the potatoes until creamy.

These were okay, but I thought it was way too much sour cream.  Next time I would cut down the sour cream to just coating the potato mixture, or I might try cream cheese instead. I think that might make for a richer, creamier filling.

I loved it!! I tried this recipe with my family and they also enjoyed it. The only problem was, it was a bit hard to keep the potato skin in place and not have it break apart when trying to scoop out the flesh. Maybe if I had waited a little longer for the potato skin to harden...but it was still delicious.

Not that you need more stars on here to advocate for how awesome these are, but they are delicious and so simple! I cheated and microwaved the potatoes and then baked them the last 15 minutes as directed in the oven to expedite the cooking time; they were excellent. Thank you!

Awesome!  My 8 year old loved these.  The most I can usually hope for is that he will eat without complaint. To actually get a compliment was a testament to how good these potatoes were! These will be a new family favorite.

Beautiful potatoes, recipe is perfect; don't change a thing.  I ended up with 7 halves because I mounded each half; okay though because hubby likes skins.

Make this all the time in the summer, for BBQ's...Kids love them, and so do we (usually we make the kids with no onions)But you can add whatever toppings you like! Only suggestion I can make is depending on the size of the potato, you may need to cook it longer than 1 hour...I usually by bigger potatoes and they need to be cooked for about 1 hour to 1 hour and a half.

These are one of my go-to side dishes when I have company because I have not served them to one person yet who hasn't raved about how good they are! Who doesn't love potatoes, cheese and bacon? Definitely not for the calorie conscious, but a real treat!

These potatoes were delicious.  I didn't have bacon so I had to skip that part, and I only put in about half a cup of light sour cream and maybe 1 1/2 tbsps of butter just to cut down on the calories and they still turned out amazing...my husband ate three of them in one sitting!  If you want to save time baking the potatoes, throw them in the microwave on high for ten minutes instead of in the oven for an hour.  Then make them as per the recipe and finish them off in the oven.

Great! Tasty and easy.  I used left over baked potatoes and they worked fine.  All you need to do for those is put them in the oven for about 20 minutes, top with cheese, and broil until the cheese melts.

This was great! I didn't have enough time to bake my 2 potatoes, so I placed them in a plastic bag, loosely tied the top and nuked them for 10 minutes. Then I followed steps 3-5 and sprinkled paprika on top (tip from another reviewer). Delicious!

I make these also with the following changes.  I will chop up an onion & mix in with the mashed potatoes.  Instead of mixing in shredded cheese, I slice pieces of cheese about 1/4" x 1/4" and about 1/2 -3/4" long.  Once I have restuffed the potato halves, I poke the cheese sticks down into the potato halves (maybe 8-10 sticks per half depending on their size).  This gives you little pockets of cheese when you are eating them.  I then sprinkle paparika on them and brown them in the oven until the cheese melts.  I also use the "real bacon bits" you get in the salad section.

I have never made twice baked potatoes and was very happy with the results of this recipe. My picky eater loves it as well. Really the only thing different we did was add fresh cayenne peppers to a few of the potatoe tops for my husband and I. Outstanding recipe, thank you.

Love this recipe! It was a huge hit with the family! I even got a request to make a big batch for a get together. The only changes I would recommend is if you are doing a big batch and using larger sized potatoes, bake the first time for 1-1/2 hours, the filling comes out smoother and mixes better with the ingredients.

This was a great recipe and watching the video beforehand really makes it even more easy. I used less green onions, only 2 because that's all I had and it still came out delish!

I think this recipe would be a lot better with less butter, sour cream and milk. It came out too gooey and only one out of eight I served it to liked it. (Mostly kids). My husband said he missed more of the potato flavor. We figure if we cut some of the extras in half it would be just right.

Tried this recipe for a St. Patty's day party last night. Everyone loved them and it was so easy to prep and serve for a crowd. Use a sturdy, metal ice cream scooper and you will no trouble getting the potato out of the skins without breaking them up.

I served these twice-baked potatoes alongside the baby back ribs recipe from this website.  My husband was in love.  Instead of baking the potatoes in the oven (I had to use the oven to slow-cook the ribs), I cooked them in the microwave; it didn't compromise the taste at all, and it was much quicker.  When I was done using the oven for the ribs, I put the potatoes in to melt the cheese and heat through.  I think we could've made a meal out of this, and we would have if we didn't have the ribs to eat, too!

I've been making this (similar) for years.  One difference - I add 1/2 cup (give or take) of peas to the potato stuffing.... When I am in a hurry I just make mashed potatoes and follow the rest of the directions - put the stuffing in a casserole dish and top with extra cheese.... it stretches if an extra appetite shows up and is a quick reheat for breakfast the next day....

Made these as written for Valentine's Day, adjusting quantities for 4 servings.  SOOO good, didn't change anything except to pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork then microwave them for 7 minutes instead of baking.  Used russets and scooped out to 1/8" from the skin.  Only for special occasions though... if I ate as many as I wanted to I'd quickly be 300 LBS :)

This was great.  We didn't have bacon so we did sausage, and it was nice, although I think bacon would be better.

I followed the recipe, except I used sauteed yellow onions, and I put bacon in half the potatoes. It's a great recipe!

Very delicious potatoes. I cooked mine for an hour, but should've cooked longer. I'd add more salt, cheese, and bacon next time. Otherwise they were very good.

These potatoes are fantastic and the leftovers are just as good, if not better, than fresh out of the oven...at least the way I made them.  I followed this recipe for our dinner and made a few extra potato "boats". I think I might have used a little more grated cheese on the tops when I baked them because they were really covered nicely with cheese.  You'll see why that's important next. The next night I added a little margarine to a non stick skillet and heated it on medium high heat.  I placed the cold potato boats, skin side down, in the pan and and cooked until I knew the bottom of the skins were browned...about 5 mins.  I didn't distrub them after I placed them in the pan.  I wanted a nice unbroken crisp bottom. Next I added another tablespoon of margarine to the skillet and carefully slide a spatula under each potato and quickly turned it over, cheese side down. I placed the spatula squarely on top of each potato skin and pressed down to flatten them to about half it's original thickness.  Now just let it brown in the margarine for another 5 mins on medium heat without disturbing.  The cheese will get nice and brown and crispy.  Remove the potato to the dinner plate but let it sit a few mins before eating.  These left over potatoes tasted so much like cheesy potato onion perogies. I made this recipe again tonight and this time made 4 extra potatoes for leftovers. This is a keeper!!

Have made these several times, and they are very good!  Of course anything with bacon is good.  :)  Had several cups of the potato filling left after I re-filled the potatoes, so I put scoops of the filling onto parchment paper on a pan and froze them.  Once they were frozen, I put them in ziplock bags.  You can also make potato pancakes from the leftover filling.

Great!  Made these for New Year's Eve dinner.  Subbed grated parm for cheddar (as I forgot to buy it!) and added some sauteed onion instead of chives to the potato mixture.  Made them the night before and put them on a cookie sheet covered in frig overnight, then warmed them for 35 min in oven.  Delicious! Our dinner party loved them!

These were very yummy. I had some fresh bacon bits on hand so I just used those instead of frying bacon. My picky son loved these and has eaten the leftovers, no problem.

I made these for Christmas, and everyone loved them. I did not cut the potatoes in half instead I just sliced about 1/4" off the top and did everything else the same. They were more filling and delicious!

These were good! I didn't have a problem with the skin staying intact because I followed the advice of other reviewers. I picked large baking potatoes. When I split them in half, I used the knife to slice about 1/4 in inside the skin and scooped out the flesh with a spoon. It was very easy with the knife. The only thing I did differently was to use extra bacon (pre-cooked) and about 2/3 of the green onion. I also added some of the bacon and paprika to the filling. Next time, I think I'll add even more bacon and still less onion (or use chives instead).

UPDATE: I made these again for New Year's and followed the suggestions I had last time about using more bacon and chives instead of the onion. They were great! Everyone loved them. I even made a vegan version for some vegetarian/lactose intolerant friends with vegan sour cream and veggie cheese, and they told me those were great, as well.

I felt that for the true baking potatoes I had, the original cooking time was definitely too short...I'll be trying again shortly with extra time added to the cooking stages.  I can only imagine the baking potatoes I had were much larger than the ones this recipe was designed for, so make sure to leave a little extra time in case you need to cook your potatoes longer.  Remember, you can always place these in the fridge or tightly wrapped in the freezer if you end up making them early and the rest of dinner isn't ready!

Perfect rendition of a beloved childhood comfort food. I made these exactly as printed, except I used soy milk as that's all I ever buy. I've made them twice in two weeks--a record for me. We served them with ribs for company the first time and rotisserie chicken the second. If I were to continue to make them that often I might substitute low/no fat sour cream or use yogurt cheese (drained yogurt) because sour cream is not a staple in our house. I didn't find them runny at all, but of course the potato size is key. Eyeball it. Mash with a masher, not a hand mixer which can give you glue. By the way, I made extra the second time and froze them individually for an easy treat later. Next time I will rub the skins with oil and salt to crisp them as other reviewers have suggested. YUM!

One word....Awesome!  I did as another reviewer suggested and added 4 oz of cream cheese.  I also added in some paprika.  I mixed all the ingredients together and put inside the potatoes and didn't sprinkle anything on top although I may do that next time just to make it a little prettier.  Delicious!

The first time I made this, I did exactly as the recipe said minus the green onions. Ever since, I've always made them to accompany steak or ribs (really any meat product.) With a vegetarian in the house, I didn't add bacon into the mixture, but still as a topping it tasted great. (Although in the mixture is just as delicious tasting c:) I always add cheese into the mixture AND on top. If you use half-slices of your favorite kind of cheese (tastes great with Colby Jack and Cheddar) on top and put bacon underneath, it's just delicious. I also add Nature's Seasoning Salt along with the pepper and salt and it does make a difference! This is a wonderful, easy recipe that's great for families, big or small. Love love love this recipe!

Great! - the first time I made this for my family, my wife said, "This is heaven in my mouth" and my kids were asking for second and third helpings.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using low fat sour cream and low fat "butter".  Delicious.

Excellent recipe! I made them for a Father's Day BBQ. I washed the potatoes and flavored the outside with sea salt and garlic powder and every bite of the potato was yummy.

These were very good, but seemed like they needed a little extra kick. I did add some cream cheese as other people recommended, but it still seemed to be missing something. I cooked them for 25 minutes, but I would have gone longer in retrospect, maybe 30-35 minutes.

A Superbowl favorite for the past two years, these potatoes earn me many hugs. I used peppercorn ranch instead of sour cream as I did not have any on hand, and it turned out fine. I also occasionally add jalapenos. These potatoes are a time investment,  but well worth it.

I made this for a cookout and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved them. My husband told me this is what we should bring to every group event we go to. I used the recipe more as a guideline since I made so many. ( I used two bags of Idaho potatoes, so maybe 20 whole potatoes) I did use evaporated milk instead of regular and added garlic and onion powder to the potato mixture. I just added the sour cream and milk until the texture was smooth and then had my husband taste test to see if it tasted good before I filled the potatoes. Overall, this is a great recipe and a great comfort food.

I used only 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1 green onion, but I used medium-sized russet potatoes. Also, I added some garlic (sautéed with the butter) and about 1/2 cup cream cheese. I have to say it was AMAZING.

Comofort food.  Takes a little effort to prepare but well worth it.  I tried to keep the mixture a little more dry to get and broiled them at the end for a little golden crust.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe last night for dinner, and it was delicious! The filling was a little soupy, and next time I would probably halve the milk. I nixed the bacon and green onions, and instead added chopped red bell pepper.

I followed the recipe as it is and my whole family loved it!  We had it for Easter so I made it the day before since we were cooking lots of things.  I followed the recipe up to the point of the 2nd bake and instead kept it in the fridge overnight.  The next day I just baked it the 2nd time right before meal time and I got lots of complitments from the family.  We will be making this again!

I was looking for a side dish to go with ribs for my son's birthday dinner and found this recipe.  It was a hit with the whole family and will become one of my go to recipes for BBQ get togethers.  Love the fact they can be made up ahead of time and popped into the oven when needed...allowing me the opportunity to visit with friends and family.  Followed the recipe as is with a little extra cheese and bacon for extra flavor!

This was a great side dish with steak.  What was really great about it was the fact that most of the ingredients can be found in pretty much everyones kitchen. Will definately be making this again!!!!

This was beyond fantastic! We usually have sour cream and cheese on hand so this was a simple way of dressing up our baked potatoes from last night! I added green onions and a small bit of cream cheese as well as the cheddar and mozarella. Will absolutely be making these again!

The 1st time in my cooking at home I.ve tried to make stuffed potatoes and I was seemingly surprized.  I've been trying recipes from allrecipe and sometimes adding my own ingredients and am happy so far.  Would like to know how to submit my recipes so others can try them.

I'm not sure what I've done wrong but as I type this, I'm finishing my potatoes. They took way longer to cook then it was indicated with this recipe and I didn't change the recipe at all.I'll try them again one day and see what I've learned

These were delicious! I used 5 large russet potatoes and they turned out great. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used pre-packaged bacon pieces to save time. My husband loved them!!!

I used 10 potatoes, definetly a little longer than an hour in the oven, probably 75 minutes - keep checking after an hour.  A few edits:  I used good quality bacon bits from a jar (easier), light sour cream (healthier), garlic salt (instead of regular), and added tabasco to taste. I stuffed whole potatoes (cut a boat pattern in the tops to add mixture).  All else the same.  Magnifico!

Very good, have made these a few times. Make sure your potatoes are cooked long enough, if not it basically ruins the recipe.

I doubled the recipe and these came out great!  They were all gone by the time I had finished cooking the rest of the finger foods I was serving for a party (about 30 minutes alone with 12 people)  So I am basing my review on my husbands word of how they tasted and my experience cooking them.  I wrapped each potato up in aluminum foil & baked for 1.5 hr. on 350.  I scooped out the insides with no problems leaving some of it intact with the potato shell so they wouldn't break or fall to pieces.  I only used 1/2 the bacon that it called for.  Everyone at the party made a huge fuss over them!  I will be making this again maybe next time I may even get a bite!

I have made this many times over the years. (Have never actually used this particular recipe) The two differences between this one and mine is mushrooms and milk. Omit the milk.  Mushrooms make a great addition. Saute until done. I saute the green onion with the mushrooms.

this recipe is great and I can't believe how easy it is.  I used 3 large potatoes- maybe it all depends on how large yours are but I think a little less sour cream.  Overall- I rate this 5 starts.

AWESOME! I just added the bacon into the mixture but Im sure either way would work fine. Twice baked potatoes sounded so hard so I never tried it before now. But it wasnt hard and paid off because this was excellent. Thank you!

These are AMAZING!!!  I was frusterated the first time I made these, since the skins didn't hold up, but the second time I cut the potatoes in half after they baked and it worked just fine!  These are great for anytime or a special occasion!

Tried this without the sour cream because I ran out and it was an instant hit.  The kids prefer it to my wife's version.

I've made these three times now and they are wonderful! I eased up a tad on the milk and sour cream the first time and they turned out perfectly, so I've continued to do the same each time. However, I'm sure they'd be fine if you followed the directions exactly. This is one of the few recipes I've found on here where there aren't a hundred recommendations on what to do differently... it's pretty much perfect the way it is! Great recipe!

These are quite yummy i have made them twice in the last 2 weeks. I use cream instead of milk and add a lil bit of plain cream cheese. Dinner guests quite enjoyed them. I had 1 half leftover & one of our guests requested to have it packed up for lunch. :)

Wonderful. I only had a few potatoes and mashed them after boil and just threw it in a casserole dish. Topped off with cheese and onion. Baked for about 25 minutes then hit it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the top. Was awesome and had far more than I thought I would have from 3 baking potatoes.

A crowd pleaser! As suggested by another, I used cream cheese along with a bit of garlic.  I used lite cream cheese and lite sour cream...every bit as good.

Huge hit in my household!  I omit the green onions since none of us are a big fan.  I reduce the sour cream by removing a couple tablespoons from the measuring cup since it makes the filling to runny.  I compensate and add more cheese.  These potatoes are the best!

I made these at a party and they were a smash hit! The only thing I did differently was that I had slow cooked my potatoes in my crock pot during the day and they were ready to come out when I started making this dish! They were PERFECT. Also, I used hormel real bacon bits because that's what I had on hand and it was great! All my dinner party guests raved about them, they thought I had got them from a restaurant! HA!

I made this for my inlaws. I made regular baked potatoes and twice baked potatoes. Everyone loved the twiced baked potatoes. I used the huge baking potatoes. I didn't use as much green onion as it called for because a lot people do not like onion. I will definately make again.

I have tried making my own twice baked potatoes for years. I have never found the right way. I was having people over for Father's Day dinner and wanted to try again and I luckily found your recipe. They were a huge hit! Everyone loved them, and they were simple to make. I followed one of the other comments and made them in the morning and then baked them right before we ate. Fabulous!! Leftovers were just as great! Thanks for sharing the perfect recipe!! I will make these often!

I have made this numerous times.. what i usually do is steam the potatoes for about 10 minutes instead of putting it in the oven for over an hour. Actually, I've never baked the potatoes before, only when it's stuffed (guess they are not twice baked after all). Also mushrooms could be added, pimento and a little mustard for colour.

I only gave 4 stars because I made some changes....These were a hit at my recipe exchange. I did make a few changes. I used chorizo instead of the bacon, left out the salt (chorizo already has enough) and the pepper. I used 6 potatoes (instead of the 4 listed), so I used 1lb of chorizo and just added more milk, cheese and sour cream. Hubby LOVED them!! Next time I will actually double the recipe.

These are the best!!!  The green onions and bacon add the perfect touch.  These are always eaten and enjoyed by everyone.  I always make extra so I'll have plenty to eat the next day -- yum!

These twice baked potatoes are the best! My sister-in-law made these at Christmas and then I made them by request of my children at Easter. They will be a family tradition for the holidays for sure!

These are just how we make our twice baked potatoes and they are DELICIOUS!!!! Sometimes I find that I don't need to use all the milk, but I always add atleast just a splash for extra creaminess. These can also be made a day or two before and just kept in the fridge, removing about 30 minutes before baking with no problems. You will NOT be disappointed with this recipe, trust me! :)

These were VERY good.  I put half the bacon in the filling and half on top.  I followed the directions exactly other than that.  Would definitely make these again.

Wasn't super impressed with these. They were good but not as good as I thought they would be. Had a hard time getting the potato out of the skins because they kept breaking apart.

I must have used smaller potatoes then I should have because mine ended up very runny. Overall they tasted great just didn't stay in the potato skins.

I used this recipe when my husband and I had my parents over for dinner. The potatoes were excellent! My family said they were the best twice baked potatoes they have ever had. The only change I made was I added 8 oz. of cream cheese to the mixture!

Delicious! I would add kosher salt to the outside of the potatoes before baking also for a little extra seasoning.  We served with T-Bone steak on the grill and a glass of cabernet sauvignon.  Delicious!

These were very delicious.  My only complaint is that they were a little on the runny side.  Next time I won't use quite as much milk.  Other than that they were devine!!

These were great. I did cook the potatoes in the microwave first to save time and also cooked an extra potatoe to have extra stuffing. Make sure and leave some potatoe meat in the skin when you are spooning out the potatoe meat so that it doesn't loose it's shape while trying to fill. Had extras left over and simply freezed them to have for later.

I didn't have large baking potatoes on hand, just normal russet potatoes. So I used 8 of them. That was probably too many as it made a huge amount and I had to use two baking sheets. This probably also messed with the proportions of the other ingredients as well. I would say that it's probably ultimately the bacon that makes this dish and since I don't eat bacon, using bacon bits was really just pointless (they're really not the same at all) and overall I found the potatoes a little bland without eat. I'm sure this is great with bacon, but without it, this definitely needs a bit more flavour pumped into it.

This was a great great recipe and very easy to make .... Instead of scooping the potatoe mix back into the potatoe peels, I poured it into a casarole dish , spread the bacon, onion and cheese over the top and into the oven and it was perfect.  I made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit.  Very yummy

Excellent!  I think these are hubby's favorite potatoes ever!  I only made one potato for the two of us, so I adjusted the amounts accordingly.  To make it easier, I just used real bacon bits instead of going to the trouble of frying up bacon.  Do be sure to leave some of the flesh attached to the skin so it's sturdy enough for the filling.

This recipe is OUTSTANDING! The only things I did differently was to mix in the crumbled bacon rather than sprinkle on top and substituted freeze dried chives for the green onions. DH and I LOVE these twice baked potatoes! Thanks PONYGIRL!

I liked this recipe. It was easy and I skipped baking them in the oven for an hour, and cooked them in the microwave. To make it a quick dinner. I also added fresh crushed garlic and italian seasoning to the potato mixture. Will make again :)

Perfect.  This has the exact flavor your taste buds are screaming for when you've got twice baked potatoes on the brain!

This is an excellent, decadent recipe. Please, just try the recipe as it's written, it's perfect as is!  When I am making this and I want it to be on the lighter side, I simply double the amount of potatoes and use light sour cream and half the butter. Believe me, you won't tell the difference and no one else does either. Don't skimp on the bacon, get the best stuff you can, I get Applewood Smoked from Target. Makes a huge difference.

I reserve enough mixture to stuff two or three potatoes and add a can of tuna to it.  YUMM!!  (I do that just for me and hubby.  Kids don't like it as much as we do.  SO THEN YOU GET A CHOICE OF TWO different kinds!!!  If you like tuna, you will love it.

This recipe was  awesome my husband couldn't believe that I made it.  I am not the best cook but these were so easy to make.  The only thing that I did differently was I added the bacon and green onion to fillling and I used Mexican mixed cheeses to top the potatoes.  I would use this recipe again and again.

The best ever.  My 17yr old gave me the ultimate compliment.  Said they were "cool".  Used 4 med potatoes and had to cook 1hr 20min.  Only used 4 green onions (divided) and used seasoned salt i/o salt.  Be careful not to tear skin.

Every time I make these it is a huge hit! They are always the first thing gone. I changed it up a little though... I take bacon along with a little bacon grease (i know gross but SO good) and mix them in with the filling. The bacon grease makes the filling consistency perfect. Also I add replaced the salt with Season Salt and added a teaspoon of garlic... SO GOOD!!!

These are really great.  I thought at first the filling was too thin but it turned out perfect.  I didn't need the additional green onions for on top because there was plenty of flavor inside.  Also my potatoes took more than an hour and twenty minutes, so I guess it just depends on the size.  Great recipe!

I've made these a few times & my family absolutely LOVES them. The only adjustment I made was to add a couple of extra slices of bacon, crumbled and added to the potato mixture prior to stuffing (still adding the remaining bacon to the top). Wonderful, wonderful recipe!

And I thought I had made these up!!!  I had these as an appetizer at a local restaurant and thought "Hey, I can make these!"  So I did - they are DELICIOUS!  I made them for a Chritmas Eve get-together this year and everyone asked for them at the New Year's Eve party.  I also add some fresh finely-chopped garlic! Yum!!

I've recently began eating potatos quite frequently and these were the best. I have never heard of twice baked potatos till a friend of mine mentioned them. I made this for my bestfriend and boyfriend and we all ate two... had to lay down for an hour ;)... fantastic!

Everything is great about the recipe, except that 1 hour is not nearly enough to get the potatoes ready. I baked them for 90 minutes at 350 and they were still not soft! Ideally, potatoes need to be baked at a higher temperature. I recommend 425 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour.  But otherwise, delicious!

Could have been a bit more tasteful, but next time I will just add more ingredients. And it did turn out a bit soggy, but everybody loved them.

This is a really good basic twiced baked potato recipe. First time I made it I followed the recipe exact. Other times I played around with it and added different spices to suit my tastes....skipped the bacon...added garlic & chives, etc.

These were great!  The only issue I had is one of my potatoes exploded in the oven, but that is not the recipes fault.  In 20+ years I have never had one explode!  The filling was tasty and we all thought they were good.  My MIL even said they were better then her recipe:)  Thanks for sharing Ponygirl I will make these again.

Fantastic, easy recipe!  This was a hit with everyone in my family.  I now make a double batch, since they are great as leftovers, too.  I also bring them to potlucks, and they always disappear quickly.  None of the measurements are that specific - I often use more or less of something and they are still great.

Fantastic!  I am an experienced cook, and these are the best I have ever made.  Easily a dinner on their own.  They were also excellent the next day just heated in the microwave.

Great basic recipe. I made a few changes: I mixed the bacon and cheese into the potato mixture and also used about half the amount of sour cream. Next time I will use even less. I didn't have any green onion so I just added a little bit of a regular one along with some garlic. I also added a tiny bit of cream cheese. I included broccoli in the mix because I had it on hand. I highly suggest  using VERY large baking potatoes to make these.

WOW, these are really good. I made them as a main meal and not a side dish. Very filling, even for my husband who is a BIG eater. I used large russet potatoes and replaced the milk with cream. I know, I know.. extra fattening! but Oh! so good! I also used bacon bits due to time restraints and had a ranch dressing dip on the side. YUMMMM

These were great.  Had trouble leaving the skins together the first time, but think I mastered it by the end for next time.  I put less onions and bacon than the recipe called for and found it really was too little.  Don't skimp on the bacon!

Delicious but way more time consuming than I expected.  I also couldn't get the skins to be crispy enough; maybe I didn't scoop out enough and they were too thick?    I also used ideas from the Baked Potato Skins recipe and brushed a mixture of olive oil, paprika, and garlic powder on the skins.

I made these exactly as recipe states, and everyone loved them.  My husband has already asked when I'm going to make these again.  I adjusted the recipe for 10 huge baking potatoes for about 5 adults and two children and I was so emberassed because we ran out of these (I always like to have plenty for my guest).  Everyone loved them!!!! Will def make these again.

These are very good, similar to how I usually make mine. I oil my potatoes before baking to get a very crisp skin and after they have cooled I use my melon baller to get in and scoop it out, best tool for the job hands down. You can also make this a great appy if you use nugget potatoes and a strawberry huller.. I recommend a pastry bag for the filling though as it is a bit meticulous for large quantities!

Loved it!  Best twice baked potatoes I have ever had.  Crumbling your own bacon instead of using bacon bits is what makes these great.  I make too many on purpose just so I can wrap a few in plastic wrap & freeze them so i can take them in my lunches for work.  Just remember to use baking potatoes-so they dont fall apart as easy when you are scoping them out.

Creamy and Delicious!  I omitted the bacon to save on calories.  Next time, I'll cut the sour cream in half and use low-fat to make it a "lighter" recipe!

This was my first time making these stuffed potatoes and they turned out great.  Even my 21 year old daughter liked them and she puts the finicky into a finicky eater.  She does not like anything except for ten basic foods and that is all. But she loved these she ate more of these than I did and she ate them for left over’s the next day.  Left over is not one of her acceptable food groups so thank you PONYGIRL64 and all the people who left feedback on ways to get the potatoes out of the skin and some other little tips. Thank you!!

I have been using this recipe for a couple years and we LOVE these. I follow the recipe exactly as stated except I add the bacon into the mixture opposed to sprinkling it on top. It takes some practice to get the potatoes scooped and not damage the skin, but once you get it down, it's totally worth the work.

Excellent! The flavor is terrific. I think I filled mine too full though, because my filling ran over. I didn't have very large potatoes so perhaps I should have cut back slightly on the milk or just saved the extra to bake in a small cup. They were terrific the next day too; one minute in the microwave, yummy. I will be making these again.

This is a great recipe. I made these for my family.  Due to the heat, I did bake the potatoes on the grill, on a piece of tin foil.  Other than that, I made no other changes.  My husband loved these, and has already asked when I will be making more!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good, not too hard to make either, I didnt use real bacon, just because I didnt want to buy any and cook it, we used Bacos instead, my son still loved them, I think next time I will add a bit more salt and some seasoning, and let them get a bit more crispy.  We made them with the seasoned turkey burgers, also from this website. Great meal

These were great.  I left a bit of the flesh in each shell and that helped.  They did get a bit dry and I had to add more milk which I think is because my potatoes were huge.  But good combination of  flavors.

We made these one night and they were really good.  I should've let them cook longer because the flesh was really hard to remove and resulted in some gaping wholes.  Next time we'll get the assembly line going and make them look really pretty.  Perfect recipe tho!

My husband and daughter loved these. I rubbed the outside of the potatoes with olive oil and garlic salt prior to baking. I used smart balance butter, skim milk, and fat-free sour cream in addition to the rest of the ingredients. My family couldn't even taste the difference. Next time I will use reduced fat cheese since I am sure it would not taste any difference. I sprinkled cheese and bacon bits and then baked for about 15 minutes.

Made this as an alternative to our usual holiday potato dish.  It was great to have done ahead of time and just pop in the oven at the last minute.  Looks so impressive but it quite easy to make.  My family raved about them.  Thank you.

These were really good.  I added the milk slowly till I got the right consistency - didn't use the amount stated but less.  Also used about 3 oz. of cream cheese.  I had smaller potatoes so cut the top third off then scooped out and refilled.  Great to make ahead of time (several days) then they are ready to put in the oven.

I took the 3-4 recipes that I found at this website and used everyone's suggestions, as far as type of potatoe & cream cheese -- wow I would not have thought of that!!! These were great!!! We had a houseful for my best friend's 40th birthday & I wanted something a litle more 'special'  These were a total hit!! I've made them once after the party (3 weeks ago) and this could become a family favorite!!! Everyone raves!!

A total hit!  I baked the potatoes the a couple days before and kept them in the fridge... they scooped out easily!  After preparing them in the morning, I kept them in fridge til half hour before dinner then baked.  Great time saver-- great side dish-- definitely a staple when I entertain!

These were very good.  Not the best I have ever tasted, but very good.  I never review a recipe unless I make it exactly as written, but next time I think I will take the suggestion of adding the cream cheese to it.

I did not have bacon or scallions on hand, but they were good anyway.  Next time I will make sure to have all ingredients.  It was a little soupy, so I will add a little less milk next time.

Yummy! This recipe is awesome! I made these with some steak and salad, my family loved it! Now when my in laws come to visit they always want these and they are pretty easy with some planning ahead! My husband hates cream cheese, but he doesn't even know I use it in this recipe!

I love this recipe!  I had to bake the potatoes a little longer to soften them, however, it was well worth the wait!

These are SUPER!!! Followed the recipe exactly the first time and they came out perfect. Have tried different cheeses and it comes out wonderful every time. I nuke the potatoes first and then bake since I normally make a small batch.

This recipe was just alright.  It lacked pizzazz.  Personally, I think I will use more cheese and sour cream next time and try to add a flavorful garnish.

These were a big hit.  I used more bacon and mixed some into the potatos directly.  Since it was my first time, I baked an extra potato in case I messed up a skin whiles  scooping.  Sure enough, I did mess up a couple of skins.  But that just made it so the remaining skins were overflowing with filling.  Which is not a bad thing.

Love this recipe, so very easy!  Keep in mind you may have to bake the potatoes longer, depending on their size.  I also wrapped mine in foil, as some others suggested.  Also, I used a regular potato masher, not a hand mixer, and they came out very creamy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I read the reviews and decided to go with the 1/2 cup light cream cheese and 1/2 cup light sour cream version of the recipe and it was delicious! I also made mine the day before and transported them to a party to cook there and they were a hit! I don't eat bacon so I used bacon bits (they are actually animal product free) and it was still delicious! The only criticism I would give is that I definitely did not use all of the green onions on the top.

These are great and really easy!  I would recommend adding the sour cream in quarters to ge the consistency you like.  Same w/ the milk.  I had onion powder on hand and used that.  I mixed half of the bacon in w/ the mixture and sprinkled the rest on top w/ the cheese.  Yum!

Was a tad runny. However, I cooked these for the first time every a few weeks ago after never even hearing about twice baked potatoes. My other half requested them and he loved them. much better then his recipe of cooking the potatoes with only Velveeta cheese on top ;)

AMAZING!! I dont really cook a lot, and this was so easy to make! I used almost a whole block of light cream cheese instead of sour cream. It seemed to be pretty thick and creamy using the cream cheese. Over all loved it! thanks!

these were delicious! followed the recipe exactly. Used 4 of the largest baking potatoes I could find, and took suggestions from other reviewers and left about 1/4" of the potato in the bottom for some support. We ate 4 of them (boy are they huge) and I put the other 4 in saran wrap and froze for a quick side dish next week.
thanks!

Right, so it would be difficult to make these taste bad, what with the bacon, butter, creams and cheeses.  They were great for lunch the next few days, but it might have been nice to try and make them taste good without all the fatty fat fat.

These were so good. I made alot for a party and they were well liked. It's like eating a filled potato skin, with the bacon and chives. Next time, I will use bigger potatoes because it took a really long time to scoop out and then refill the smaller potatoes I had. What was left over, we ate with eggs for breakfast the next morning.

This is a good, basic recipe for twice-baked potatoes.  Spice it up your own way, it's hard to fail at this one!!  Just add what tastes good.  Unlike with mashed potatoes, you can't really "over-beat" these...I used my electric mixer and created a nice, whipped texture for the filling. Also, in my kitchen, time is usually of the essence, so I "baked" my potatoes in the microwave.  It's more steaming, really, and it saved me 40 mins at least!  I did finish them in the oven at 350 for about 15 mins, though.
To microwave your potatoes: Pierce your washed, wet (I don't dry them off) potatoes with a fork several times all around the potato.  Place wet potato on a MS plate, sprinkling a bit of water on your plate. If doing multiple potatoes, leave an inch of space between them, and only do two-3 medium sized baking potatoes at a time for even cooking.  Cook on high heat, about 7 mins for one potatoes, about 12 for two, and so on.  Carefully - don't burn yourself!- squish your potato to gauge it's texture inside.  Skin and flesh underneath should give nicely. Voila!  Baked potatoes in the microwave.

This recipe was great! I even managed to mess it up (I only made two potatoes and forgot to alter the recipe accordingly, so it was a little more soupy than it should have been)! Absolutely delicious

These are almost identical to "my" recipe - I use a little bacon fat to cook some diced yellow, white, and/or red onions, and sometimes a diced shallot or two and add it to the potato mixture.  I top mine with a dollop of sour cream, freshly snipped chives and bacon pieces.

Yum...I didn't have large baking potatoes so I used 6 medium-small. I didn't use the exact measurments for the ingredients just eyed it to our tastes. I had a large chicken breast from dinner last night so I diced it small and threw into the mix. I also added a dash or so of cayenne pepper for a kick. Served with a veggie on the side and bam we had a simple dinner. Since it was only my 19 month old and I, I froze half the batch before the second baking. We'll see how they taste later on.

great recipe! like another reviewer said, I used smaller potatoes cut in half rubbed in olive oil and put face down on a tray cooked @ 450 for about 30 mins.. the part of potato that was face down gets a little hard but it still tastes good when you mash it out.. after the potatoes cooled I took a knife and outlined a circle to scoop out... followed the mixture exactly adding chives, bacon ranch dressing, and only a splash of milk.  Made for football party and they went over well!  Will definately make again

Wow! What a good twice baked potato!!! Made these for dinner tonight, as an accompainment to flavorful flank steak (by Janice Montiverdi - on this site). I was skeptical at first.... I microwaved my potato (I only purchased one, enough for two servings) for the suggested amount of time per my "users manual" (yes, I save these!) and they were still rock solid! After cutting them in half and zapping for another couple of minutes, they were fork tender (whew!), but I could see them drying out if not watched carefully. My second "hurdle" was not using a big enough bowl to mix all the filling ingredients. My hand mixer would barely fit, so my potato mixture came out a bit lumpy (oh well - my bf prefers his this way...). I added bacon bits to the filling and sprinkled some on top as I did not have fresh bacon available. Baked as directed to "ultimate" perfection. This recipe now has a permanent place in my "keeper" file. Next time, I'll BAKE my potatoes and use a large mixing bowl to avoid the frustration.... I'd also like to try one reviewers idea for making "mini" stuffed reds as an appetizer. Oh, ya, and leave a thin shell (i.e. don't scoop all of the potato) or else you'll have problems filling them. Thank you SO much for sharing, Debra!

These potatoes are wonderful. Followed the directions exactly. As suggested, make sure to add salt and pepper to your taste. I made more because I watched the video and tried freezing for future dinners or a light lunch. Definitely worth the time and effort.

Phenomenal!! I brushed the potatoes with oil and rubbed with garlic salt before baking. 
I only made 4 servings of these, and you MUST BE CAREFUL when adding the sour cream and milk. It will turn out runny if you put the whole amount in at once- I suggest adding a little, mixing, adding, mixing, until it is the consistency that you'd like. Otherwise, this is the perfect potato side dish-or even a meal in itself!! LOVE LOVE LOVE! :)

Very yummy, and easy to make.  Didn't have any green onions, and I used bacon pieces instead of frying up bacon. Will definitely make again.

I mixed everything in the potato mixture and added extra cheese and onion on top.  I also added half & half instead of milk to give it a creamier texture.  They were great.

Excellent.  I didn't have any milk so I just omitted that and added a tiny bit more sour cream.  I froze the extras (prior to the second bake) and we've been adding the frozen ones to dinner ever since!

We found it a little to runny the first time when following the recipe, so we cut back on both the milk and sour cream and everyone loves them.  They are great to freeze and then in the mornings with guests, pop them back in the oven for a half hour or so.

These were fantastic! We don't care for onions or scallions so I left them off. We used to buy the frozen twice baked potatoes.  Notice I said "used to"...Best we have ever had!!

Very very very yummy, in that way that only something this bad for you can be :).  I didn't mash mine all the way, and definitely wished I had, it needs that ultra-smooth, ultra-creamy texture.  With bacon and sour cream and cheese...oh dear.

Would have been better without the bacon and to add ranch dressing.  Other than that it was awesome.  Added fresh ground black pepper on the top.  Good stuff.

These were excellent.  I left out the bacon since my family are not fans, and the shells disintegrated on me a little, care needs to be exercised in removing meat once cooked.  I would definitely make again, maybe adding a little garlic or substituting some ranch dressing for part of the sour cream.

These were very good.  I omitted the bacon as the boyfriend and I don't eat it, but everything else I followed exactly.  I used a blender because I didn't have a mixer and as a result the potato mix was very smooth and creamy.  I actually think I prefer it a little chunkier, and will take note of that for next time.  Otherwise these were perfect!  Very filling, could nearly be an entire meal in themselves.

This was my first time making Twice Baked Potatoes and it went easier than I thought it would.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time I think I'll add a tad more cheese.  Oh, and I even ate the skins, I NEVER eat the skins!  I rubbed the skins with olive oil and salt, poked the taters full of holes, wrapped them in foil and baked them on the grill.

I thought these were very good, but I didn't use all the sour cream it said to use and I only used half the bacon (because   I ran out).  I also didn't have chives.  Next time I would use all the bacon it calls for and add the chives which I think would make it even better.

I used the suggestion by another reviewer to use red potatoes tossed in olive oil.  The olive oil gave it a great taste and kept the skin from tearing as easily.  Very yummy!

My grandma had a recipe for this and i couldn't quite remember the whole recipe this is the closest one to it the only thing that we did different that saves a hole bunch of time. We put each potato in the microwave for about 5 min then if they need to be put them in for 5 more but make sure you poke a few holes with a fork so you don't have a mess. And then we also add garlic powder to the potato mix they are delicious!!!!

Excellent recipe.. I did however change it a bit.  I used ranch dip/dressing that I make myself along with some sour cream.  They turned out fantastic!

So creamy and delicious. I just havent mastered the art of scraping out the inside yet. I ended up serving mine more like mashed potatoes. They were still very good.

Easy and great!  My son can't eat bacon so I substituted a little bit of chopped up ham.  Very yummy.

Hay que hacerla con una papa firme. Antes de meterla al horno, la unte con aceite de oliva y sal, se hicieron en una hora y 15 mas o menos a 180°.
El relleno es mejor que quede un poco mas solido para que no se "derrita" al volver a ponerlas en el horno...
No olvidar dejar queso para la decoracion

These potatoes are SO good. I either use real bacon pieces from a jar or the ready-to-serve bacon when making these. I also put the whole mixture in a casserole dish instead of back into the potato skins and bake for 30 mins. Scrumptious!

I made these for my family, and they were ok.  I had to put less onion in mine, as the full amount was too much for my family's taste.

Very good.  Used chives instead of onions, but will try with the onions next time to see the difference.

Omitted the milk, but added 2 -3 oz. of cream cheese.  Also threw in some garlic powder.  Great recipe!  Update:  This time omitted milk and added ranch dressing...about 2-3 Tbsp. Very good also!

These tasted really good, although next time I think I would either increase the baking time after they've been stuffed or increase the oven temp.  They turned out a little mushy.  Great flavor though, thanks!

This recipe is the best.  I go heavy on the bacon and cheese.  Other then that I follow it exactly.  I did mess up one time (when my future in-laws were coming for dinner ~ yikes!) and had the potato skins fall apart on me.  I just threw it all in a casserole dish and finished at the same lengths of time on the recipe.  It was still a hit, even though the presentation wasn't as pretty.

The overall taste was ok but I will not be making these again. The filling turned out too soupy and I even used less sour cream than what was called for. These may have been better if I had used 4 huge potatoes, or 6 large.

I attempted to make this as one reviewer suggested, with the mini red potatoes; however, when I got to the grocery store I couldn't remember if I was supposed to get the very small red potatoes or the larger ones. I got the larger ones, and then I was running out of time so I just made mashed potatoes instead, but with all the same ingredients to make them stuffed. The family didn't like so many onions, so I would decrease that, but otherwise it was very good.

Not amazing but not bad at all. I won't make this again, not because it tastes bad, it's just too much work. For that amount of prep it needs to be a bit better.

These potatoes were awesome.  I didn't read the recipe correctly and added the bacon to the mix, instead of putting on top.  I think it actually worked better that way, you get you have some bacon in every bite.

I love twice baked potatos. when I was 15 I made twice baked potatos with ham, green onions, sour cream, milk, one egg, salt, Pepper, and seasoning salt. I mixed all of these ingredients together with the potato then stuffed it back in and put cheese and bacon bits on top and baked it again.

Like the recipe.  Easy to make and prep ahead of time, then just heat and serve.  I don't know if I would use as much sour cream next time, but that's just's my own taste.  Everyone loved them.

I'll give this a 5 star because my teenage boys said this was the best Twice Baked Potato recipe that I have ever made. I thought it was excellent but not necessarily the best I've ever had. Definitely worth the effort and I double it for a nice quick left-overs.

I love eating these! I don't cook the bacon, but if I have the packaged "bacon bit" kind, I put those in. If I want to get fancy, I'll pipe the potato mixture back in with a piping tip. Makes it look fancy.

First time making twice baked potatoes, it was a success! This recipe is super easy, it was actually an after thought for new years and it was surprising that I had all the ingredients. My potatoes were a little small i cut the amount of sour cream to 3/4c, I think if they had been large the amount would be appropriate. the filling was a little lumpy, but I think maybe it was because I had my friend mix it and she's not that cooking saavy, but in any case if I notice it nexy time it would be hard to take a masher to that and make them smooth. Overall it was surprisingly easy and now I will just play with ingredients to give it that extra kick!

I modify it a bit by using 6 green onions, otherwise too "onion-y" for us.

Wonderful!  I did follow a couple suggestions from other reviewers: I added 4 oz of cream cheese and used Hormel Bacon Pieces.  I inadvertently forgot to add the butter.  I also used lowfat ingredients.  Regardless, they were fabulous and a huge hit at our Christmas dinner.  Even my kids loved them!

Perfect baked potatoe. Super creamy and the bacon gives that delicious crispy flavor. 
My husband and a group of friends loved it.
I'll do it again, definitely.

This was very easy to make, and a great hit with the family!  I did end up having to cook the potatoes for a couple of minutes longer in the microwave to get them soft enough, though.

I don't know why, but I can't do these right! The potatoe skins always end up tearing. So I made this as a mashed potato dish instead. I mixed the onions & cheese as in the recipe, but plated it & topped it with everything else & microwaved it so the cheese would melt. Came out great!!

I've made these and didn't fool around with measurements! I used all the bacon-half pound-and after mixing in the cheese, I topped with a bunch to make a nice crispy topping. Yep, time for some artery hardening, but man are they G O O D!!!

These were sooooo good. I also used Bacon bits to save time. Next time I think I might use a hand mixer to make the potatoes really creamy. I didnt measure anything precisely, just eyeballed a bit and it worked out great.

yep, this recipe rocks!  i didnt have a problem with scooping the potatoe out of the skins, but if you dont care for "show" i'd just put the mixture in an oven-safe bowl and pop it back in the oven for the last 15 minutes.  much much easier!  the only thing i changed was using bacon bits instead of having to cook bacon - since i'm lazy!  thanks so much for the recipe!

These are awesome.  My super picky kids even love this recipe.  Sometimes I cook the potatoes in the microwave and then mix all of the ingredients (skin and all) instead of placing the mixture back into the potato skins.  I just put some left over green onions, bacon pieces,and cheese on the top as a garnishment.  It makes the process a little faster AND I can take one big dish to church or whatever get together I'm going to.  People always request I make this dish.  Of course, I double the cheese and bacon!!!!

These tasted amazing.  For some reason though, all of my filling sort of oozed out in the oven and the potatoes didn't look very nice when I served them.  I think my potatoes were too small so there wasn't enough flesh in the mix so I'm still giving it 5 stars!  Can't wait to make again!

These potatoes were a big hit.  I did decrease the milk to 1/8 of a cup.  I also left some potato pulp in the skins so they would maintain their shape.

Fabolous.  I used some large baking potatoes, served with a salad and that was plenty for a whole meal.  And they're great reheated.

I'm afraid these were just okay for us.  I used much less milk so it wasn't soupy....also used and about half the onions but still found tthat the potaoes were too oniony.  I think we will stick with just sour cream and butter for our baked stuffed......sometimes less is better, I think

These were great!  I used the pre-cooked packaged bacon to save time.  I actually used 2 additional crumbled into the rest of the mixture as well as the bacon on the top.  This was a great recipe, both simple & delicious!  My husband loved it.

I made this recipe without alterations and the filling turned out a bit runny so it didn't really maintain shape.  However, they tasted delicious! Hopefully, they'll turn out better next time I try to make them.

Things were going my way when I made these.  They were excellent!  You could definately make a meal out of one potato; probably even half.  I think next time I will add a little more bacon.  We ate these for 2 days.  I think they were even better after the third bake.

Thanks for the good recipe. Like many others I add less sour cream and milk cause by accident the first time I made it I messed up the proportions and it turned out just perfect anyhow.

These are just what i was craving.  i didn't add the bacon (i don't like bacon), and i added oregano to the mixture.  the oregano complimented the cheese, butter, and sour cream well.  i also added some grated parm cheese on top to help brown.  I prefer these to the ones at Fresh Market, they just need a little preparation time.  i did have to bake them 30-45 minutes longer initally so they would be soft enough to scoop the flesh out.

I made these with Porterhouse steaks and French onion soup, also from this site, for Mothers Day.  it took longer than expected for them to bake, but that is probably my oven.  I used EVOO and Kosher salt on the skins, other than that I followed the recipe and they turned out super. They look make a nice colorful presentation, very creamy and tasty.  I will certainly be making these again.  Thank you for sharing!

We love these potatoes! The second time I made them, I chopped up some cooked broccoli and mixed it in with the filling. Delicious, and adds a bit of a healthy twist to an already great side dish!

These were delicious. I think I added to much sour cream or milk because the mixture came out a bit soupy. Next time I'll cut back but otherwise it was a very good.

I left out the bacon to make these vegetarian.  I also made them with chives instead of the green onion and added a little paprika.  They were pretty good, but I've had better twice baked potatoes that weren't as high in fat.

Words cannot desribe how good these are!!!  I made them as a side dish for a holiday dinner, and I honestly did not need to eat anything else....they are that delicious. If you or your kids don't like sour cream, I would cut that amount down a bit, or cut it out all together and perhaps use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. Just unbelievably yummy!!!

This recipe is DELICIOUS.  I don't usually like baked potatoes at all but I LOVE this.  So does everyone I've made it for!  It doesn't need any changing IMO.

My husband I both loved these potatoes!  The only change I made was I omitted the green onions.  These were really, really good and tasted great reheated the next day.

This was great.  You can change it up a bit to fit your taste and still have it turn out very well. I didn't change a thing (the first time) and everyone loved it!  Easy and tasty.

Add a little garlic salt and some extra cheese to these potatoes and you have a sure thing.  This is a new staple in my house and my husband cannot get enough of it.  While it does take some time to cook and mash and whatnot, the taste makes up for it.  Perfect for Super Bowl parties, appetizers or dinner around the table!!

I omitted the bacon and did not even measure the rest of the ingredients before mixing, I also forgot to add the milk. Despite this, this recipe came out great.

I several people over for dinner and decided to make this for them.  As a college student I must say that I love it and it is so easy to do.  I also found that the potatoes can be cooked initially in the microwave and just put in the oven to melt the cheese if you need to speed things up.

Very good mixture.  I used less sour cream per other suggestions.  I also added small amounts of milk, mixted & added more until it was the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Will definitely use this recipe in the future!

These were the best!! I used good size potatoes, and 1/2 was all anyone could eat, so there were a lot left over. They were good reheated for lunch. Next time I would allow 1/2 for each person as they are filling.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have a problem with them being runny as I used more potatos then called for and didn't alter the other ingredients.  I ommited the green onions, because I hate onions.  But other than that I followed the recipe, and they were pretty good.

Loved it. Used Hormel bacon bits, not the super crunchy kind, as a substitute. It was quick easy and looked nice.

Great accompaniment to steak from the grill!  Definitely a little extra work required, but well worth it.

So good!  The second time I made this, I added more milk, more sour cream, and more cheese.  Also, I used store bought crumbled bacon and added chives.  Recipe is a keeper!

I loved the way the green onions tasted- I've never used them in twice baked potatoes before.  My husband and I thought they were a little bit too heavy- next time I'll cut out some sour cream.  Otherwise- YUMMY!

These were great! They were a little too runny; but I think thats because I accidentally melted the butter when I was trying to soften it. I'd add more salt and pepper next time, as the prominent flavor was the sour cream, but it was excellent to start with!

I found the recipe very easy to use. Considering the size of the 2 potatoes I used, I ended up cooking them for about 1 hr 20 min.  Smaller potatoes would have been less time.  I did use 1/2 the sour cream that it called for and added cream cheese in its place.  I added 2 extra slices of bacon to the original recipe, added half the bacon to the mixture & the other half i sprinkled on top.  Regretfully, by putting the bacon in the mixture made the bacon soft.  Next time I will only put the bacon on top.  My husband really liked the potato & said it will be difficult to go back to a plain baked potato. Great recipe and a definate keeper

Love twice baked.  Tried the recipe exactly and other than teh stronger taste of eth green opnion they were a tad bit bland...perhaps as another suggested I could add garlic next time or another predominant spice?  They were all gobbled up at my barbeque anyway and I will make them again with a little modification.

I did not follow the recipe word for word, but it was a great start for me.  I used small red potatoes instead and added some cream cheese to the mix.  I left out the green onion (I did not have any) and it was still great.  A great finger food and side dish to any meal!  My guests and family loved them!  What a great recipe to  help make a great meal!  Thank you!

Great recipe! My fiance hates chives so I substituted the chives for chopped broccoli and added a pinch of crushed red pepper to make up for the taste of the missing chives. Fantastic!

It was amazingly good and I'm not sure I'll be able to go back to eating potatoes any other way. It turned out warm and creamy.

These were just alright for me.  It tasted really sour (too much sour cream!) and I don't think you should add the green onions for baking because it gets hard and burnt.  That is best left for topping later (the sour cream too).  The consistency was a little mushy as well.  I guess I'll have to tweek it a bit.  Thanks anyway.

Oh so yummy...perfect comfort food and a nice change from plain old mashed potatoes.  They would have been even better with the bacon, but I had to leave it out for my husband who has an unnatural aversion to bacon.

I left out the green onions (didn't have any) and the milk (filling was moist enough without it) and they were fabulous...will definately make them again.

Everyone raved about these potatoes!  I will definately make them again.  I also made a batch without cheese for those who needed it. They loved them as well.  Also great with a little (about 1/2 cup)cooked broccoli florets added!

These were good, but I don't know if it's worth the trouble.  Why not just make mashed potatoes with these ingrediants?  I might try it again.

Everyone loves this recipe.  The family wants it at least once a week.  I didn't make any changes.  I believe it depends on the size of the potatoes.  Enjoy!

This recipe is similar to one that my mom used to make years ago.  It is always a delight to find great-tasting recipes that also bring back good memories.  
I poke holes in the potatoes and microwave them to speed things up a bit, but this recipe is a must-have in my book!  Thanks for sharing it!

I think it would be really hard to screw this recipe up. I used cream instead of milk, and put way too much in. They still turned out really good.

I made these almost a week ago and I'm STILL thinking about them! They were so darn good! I "baked" my potatoes in the microwave and mixed the green onions in with the potato flesh rather than sprinkling them on top. I also used Hormel Real Bacon Bits instead of cooking it myself. But that's all I changed and they were SLAMMIN! Mmmm... I'm making these again this week.

This was a huge hit with my family and company.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to cut the milk in half.  All personal choice/taste so the next time I will leave the milk out totally.  I think it depends how dry your potato is(and that depends what type of potato you use).  Absolutely wonderful recipe!  Thanks!

These potatoes are so tasty! My best friend's mom makes some very similar, and hers had been the only ones I had tried. They turned out very well; thanks for the great recipe!

These were really good, although next time I'll cut down on the sour cream.  I like the filling to be thicker.

We served these potatoes with our Christmas Eve ham. I like the idea of being able to do them up the day before and then finish them off after the ham came out. Everyone thought they were good. I thought they were a little runny. I think I would cut back on the sour cream if I made these again. Loved the bacon and cheddar together.

We love these but often don't have the time to bake the potatoes, wait for them to cool, etc. An easy shortcut is to make mashed potatoes and then add everything into the potatoes and put them in a casserole dish to bake.

These were delicious and a big hit with my potato loving family.  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave (which cut down on the prep time considerably0.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

I just made this for supper and it's great! I cooked the potatoes in the microwave to save time. I left out the onions since we don't care much for onions. They are so creamy and tasty! I didn't even really need to measure anything...I even used only 2 potatoes! Soooooo Good! :) This is a new regular in my kitchen!

This is a great easy to make recipe. The baking time may vary depending on the size of your baking potates. Mine took about 1 hour and 20 minutes, instead of 1 hour. Very Yummy!!

These were fantastic!  I made them for thanksgiving, in place of the standard mashed potatos and gravy, and they were well recieved.  My husband kept raving about them and my kids devoured them.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients; the recipe proved to be very flexible.  I will definately be making these again!

My family loved these. I didn't change a thing, except I didn't use the hand mixer, I just mashed everything together until it was smooth. I don't generally like leftovers but these are great even reheated.

A great recipe. We made it, ate half, and then ate the rest as leftovers two days later. They were as good then as the first night.

I made this last night for my family and everyone loved it!!!  The only thing I did differently is that I omitted the bacon because some of them do not eat pork.  Full of flavor!! A definite keeper.  I think is going to be on my Thanksgiving table.

These potatoes were the hit of the dinner party.  I added about 1/4 teaspoonful of ground red pepper for some zing.  Also, I increased the cheese by about 15%.  Excellent!

I found these to be a bit too creamy.  I prefer twice baked potatoes just a little stiff.  Next time I will cut back on the milk and sour cream.  Other than that, the taste was great.  Will make again with adjustments.

This was a great recipe! I omitted the sour cream since I didn't have any on hand, and added some more butter and milk instead. The potatoes came out so flavorful and yummy. My husband and I loved them!

These potatoes were delicious!  I did have a hard time scooping them out of the skin though.  I mangled a few skins so bad that they could not be used.  I would recommend cooking a bit longer than 1 hour to soften the potatoe more.  Other than that, easy recipe with wonderful results!

Great recipe!!  Made these for company and they were a big hit.  I omitted the onion and bacon since I didn't have those 2 ingredients on hand.  However, I do think the addition of those two items would make this wonderful dish even better.  Will definitely make again and again!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I guess we are some of the very few people who didn't care for this recipe.  I found the flavors to be really overwhelming, even though I cut back some on the bacon and green onions.  Also, even taking others' recommendations to cut back a little on the sour cream and milk, we found them to be too runny.  I think I will continue to just make my basic twice baked potatoes recipe that I've had for years.  Sorry.

Now I know where this recipe got it's name. These were fabulous! This was my first time make twice baked potatoes but not my last! There were a couple of things I did different. I cooked them at 425 degrees for 50 minutes. I added a 1/2 tsp of onion salt and a clove of fresh garlic. Like another reviewer, I rubbed them in olive oil and sprinkled them with course Kosher salt. Great flavor. They were a huge hit at my dinner party, even with my 7 year who had seconds! I would definitely recommed these to everyone. They are fabulous. Thanks Debra.

I made this recipe exactly as shown for Christmas dinner (18 people) they raved and raved and raved ! ! ! Definitely a bit of work but well worth the effort. I have been making these for Christmas dinner for the past 6 years.  My family wouldn't consider having anything else but these along with rare prime rib roast!

Super recipe with small revisions. 400 degrees for one hour worked better. I like the mixture to be creamier so I incorporated more sour cream and milk. I also blended some of the bacon into the mixture as well as topping the potatoes.

Good, but not ultimate.  I baked the potatoes much longer than the recipe called for, and even microwaved them when they didn't seem soft enough to be done.  ---  There's a small, and inexpensive, restaurant in my town that serves twice-baked potatoes to die for - fluffy, tasty, and fulfilling.  These didn't quite match up.

So easy and so good! My son will never eat all of his potatoes unless I make these. It is great because the ingredients are all things that I always have and I never have to add any other seasonings to it. This recipe is perfect the way it is. Thanks!

These potatoes were great!! I put the potatoes in the microwave for 10 mins before putting them in the oven to speed things along. Also, I didn't use that much green onions. Overall, great recipe and I would make these again!! :)

Excellent. I used potato topper instead of regular sour cream and left out the green onions. Not very hard to make. Might have to bake potatoes a little longer. Big hit with the kids also. Make lots they are even better left over.

Excellent recipe, I have made this a couple of times and it always turns out great.  I usually use a mix of sharp cheddar and colby-jack cheese.  I also like to mix a bit of the bacon in with the filling.

Not a huge fan of twiced baked but, I thought these where good, a bit time consuming.......but, husband and boys LOVED them!  Actually had some left over & they all loved them next day too!  Next time I think I'd double the recipe and freeze extra.

A really good potato!  Just be careful when you scoop out the cooked potato- the skins are very fragile!

These were wonderful. I made them over the weekend and they were quite a hit.  My husband always says my twice baked are just mashed potatoes in the skin and he really doesn't like mashed potatoes (which I really feel by the way is un-American!).  But these potatoes he absolutely loved.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - definitely a keeper.

maybe i didn't use big enough potatoes?  found it to be a bit too mushy, i generally like it a little more potatoey but not bad.  i mixed bacon into the potato for extra flavor and will use less green onions if i try again.

While the flavor was very good, I think the texture was a little too creamy, almost like mashed potatoes. I like twice baked potatoes a bit drier so maybe adding less milk or sour cream next time will help.

we were in chile for the holidays and couldnt find baking potatoes, so we just converted this into a mashed potatoes recipe and they were still delicious, if not as visually appealing. it did seem like something was missing, though...maybe diced broccoli?

Great recipe and very easy. I changed a couple of things and added a 1/2 cup of tatter topper instead of using a whole cup of sour cream. I also decreased the milk by just a bit. I didn't use any bacon because I didn't have any on hand and I added garlic salt to the mixture. Overall, it turned out great considering this is the first time I have ever made these!

These were a hit with my picky eaters!  I like how easy it is to vary the recipe for each picky eater, i.e. I halved the filling and added green onions to half before filling the shells.  I would only recommend blending the potato, milk and butter a bit before mixing in the cheese and onion so that the filling is creamier.  Thanks!

Very very good. However the 1 hour baking time was not long enough. The potatoes were still pretty hard and ended up a bit lumpy. Next time I will cook them longer, but I will definately make them again.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but the first time I made them, I had a little trouble.  I bought 4 large baking potatoes and baked them for an hour, but they were no where near done. I nuked them for awhile, but then second guessed myself and thought maybe the skins would "stand up" better if they were not quite all the way done.  Nope.  I cut them and dug them out the best that I could and mashed the filling with butter and sour cream etc. they were only a little lumpy.  I did try to serve them in the skins...I mangled a couple of them, but luckily we only had one other couple over so it worked out ok.  They tasted wonderful.  I made them again and instead of baking the potatoes, I basically made regular mashed potatoes (boiling) and added the ingredients from this recipe.  Same great flavor, but without the fuss.  That bacon makes them soooooo good!

Being fairly new to cooking, this is the first time I attempted this dish, using this recipe to the letter and WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS!!!! My boyfriend hates sour cream and cheese and he ate TWO of them. Leftovers heat up nicely in the microwave. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

Excellent recipe... tastes very good and it is very presentable... I actually cut the cooking time in half by wrapping the potatoes in a plastic wrap and put it in the microwave for fifteen minutes or until your knife goes through smoothly.

These potatoes are fabulous.  I like to put the mashed potato portion into a pastry tube with a large tip and pipe them onto the potato half.  They look so elegant and taste wonderful.

I tried this recipe the same night i found it on this site. It was simple and very tastey. We have already planned on making this again for appitizers and as a side dish. I was very impressed and will be trying more recipes here. Thank you.

These were delicious.  I cut down on the sour cream because the whole thing was getting really runny so used only about a half a cup and used chives instead of onions.  Very tasty, great the next day.

Very good recipe.  Sometimes I make this and add half of an envelope of Hidden Valley dry Ranch dressing mix to the potato mixture and omit the salt.  It's always a hit with my family and guests.

My family loved it!!  It was an instant favorite.  My 4yr. old even asked for more.  I added a bit of garlic powder to give it a more flavor and used honey smoked bacon instead of the regular.  It was great.

These turned out great!  Instead of baking them I wrapped them in foil and put them on the grill for about 30 minutes until fork tender.  Next, I scooped out the insides, added the ingredients as instructed and put the filled potatoes back on the grill for an additional 10 minutes or so.  The grill added a nice smokey flavor, too.

Tried the recipie twice and both times I didn't bake the potatos long enough. Potato filling was too difficult to scoop out and ended up using a blender to combine all of it. Turned out okay but certainly not worth the hassle.

AWESOME! I knocked the calories in half a potato from 366 to 180 by using half the butter (and using a no trans fat margarine instead of butter), 1/2 of the light sour cream, and no bacon and they were still terrific

Really yummy, even the skins were good. Added a little garlic powder and extra cheese to mine. This one's a keeper!

Awesome!   Brought to a dinner party and they were a big hit!  Keep in mind that because of the richness, many people will only heat a half potato.

These were good.  I don't think they were exceptional (tasted like a basic baked potato with all the goodies to me), but I will certainly make again.  Not sure why people had problems with the mixture being too "soupy" - I mixed all the ingredients as stated and found the consistency to be perfect.  I did add more cheese, however (personal preference), and used chives since they were all I had on hand.  Great basic recipe.

As far as taste goes, this recipe is delicious!  I did encounter a few problems with it though.  Apparently an hour wasn't really long enough to soften the potatoes, so when I tried scooping out the insides, the skins got a little butchered.  So I did away with the skins and served it as is.  I also used a blender since the potatoes weren't soft enough to use a hand mixer.  I also used reduced fat sour cream, fat free cheddar cheese, and soy milk.  But like I said - the taste couldn't be beaten!

These are really good.  I cheated and I microwaved the potatoes for about 10 minutes and then wrapped them in tin foil for another 10 minutes.  Scooping out the potato and mixing the ingredients was easy.  Then I just popped them in the oven for 15 minutes and they were done by the time my main course was ready.  I think I might use a little less onion next time.

It was ok. I think that you should bake the potatos a bit longer and not use so much milk and it would be great. It was to creamy for me.

Delicious...depending on the size of the potato, you may need to bake them a little longer than 60 minutes or increase the heat to 375 degrees or else the potatoes will not cook through.  Try putting everything in a good food processor to make the potatoes extra creamy and without any chunks.  These are the best twice baked potatoes ever!

Wonderful! These were delicious! I cheated by microwaving the potatoes and using Real Bacon Bits. I also used fat-free sour cream, margarine and skim milk to cut on the calories, but they were still great. My husband raved about them! If you're not a huge onion fan, you may want cut down on the onions.

I make these twice baked potatoes every time I make steaks now. :) Only thing I change is to "cheat" by microwave-baking the potatoes to cut the cooking time, and using either microwave bacon or even bacon bits instead of cooking bacon. This is one of my favorite things to make for company!

It was very very good, but I had to cut everything, but the amount of potatoes, in half. This recipe is really really good but works best if you eat it with other foods that won't make you feel so guilty about eating all those calories and fats.

i made this 3 diffent times during the christmas holiday. this went over very well. the only thing i didn't do was put them back in the skin. i kinda tore them up.  so instead i didn't mix them up real creamy so they would have that  in a baked potato texture.  i also added more of cheese and stuff to taste.

We love these twice baked potatoes! I find it hard to keep the skins from breaking when scooping them out, but they don't have to look perfect just to taste good:) They also reheat well as left overs later on.

The only twice baked potatoes recipe I like more is my grandmothers, but for some reason I can't make them like she does.  So, for me, this recipe works.  It does take some time to make, but it's worth it.  Yummy!

Fabulous potatoes!  The green onions & potato mixture has a very original & tasty flavor.  My husband gets very excited when he sees these out on the table.  Like other reviewers, however, I would agree that 1 potato = 2 servings (especially with the size of those genetically-engineered taters out there these days); they're very rich.

So easy. So good.  Even our one year old granddaughter love these!  I've always used chives in the past, but the green onion was tasty.  I might use a sprinkling of chives on top next time for more visual interest.

I omitted the bacon and the onions, and cut back on the amounts of milk and sour cream, so the potatoes wouldn't be runny, and mixed them up with a hand mixer.  Then I just put cheese on top and these were wonderful!!  I baked them in a 425 oven for thirty minutes and they turned out great!  I made them for my in laws for dinner and got nothing but praise.  My husband loved them so much, he now wants me to make them at least twice a week!!  Great recipe!!

Wonderful mix of ingredients. You can also make mashed potatoes and add the same ingredients for an easier version of this recipe.

These were so good!  I didn't use the bacon, but am looking forward to trying it with broccoli.  I will also make more than I need the next time (I halved the recipe) and freeze the leftovers. YUM!

Great! We love these! It is difficult to keep the skins nice to put the potato mixture back in, but if we wreck one, we just stuff more potato into the other skins! Yum!

This is the first time I've made twice baked potatoes and this recipe turned out great.  I left out the bacon due to time, and they still tasted great.

MMMMMMMMMMM!  What a delicious recipe for potatoes!  In fact, I made them two nights in a row - my family enjoyed them so much they welcomed the second night of these potatoes.  Even my parents-in-law liked them so much they thought I went to a lot of trouble making these "special potatoes" just for them.  =)  They're really health-conscious so I didn't reveal that I used real sour cream and milk to make the potatoes taste rich and creamy.  Next time, I'll try low-fat or non-fat sour cream for them!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Debra!  It's a keeper at our home!

This is the first time ever making twice baked and these turned out great!  I probably wont use as many green onions next time, but that is just a personal preference.  I loved them, and will definitely make these again. Thanks!

GREAT tasting twice-baked potatoes. Moist and creamy. I'll definitely make these over any other recipe I've tried so far.
