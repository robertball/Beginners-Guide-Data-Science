Dough is easy to work with. I used yogurt and instead of aspartame.8 g packets of saccharin and it worked fine. I suggest using a serrated knife to cut the rolls and wiping the blade after each cut to keep the tops jam-free.

We had to use more flour than the recipe stated to make the dough rollable. The dough was not too good at holding a lot of jam inside. The strudel has a basic textrue and not too much taste when more flour is added.

Made these for a friend who cannot have sugar. I only left out the raisins. I didn't like them - hate raspberry and found it kind of bland. Both my husband and the person I made them for loved them though. I also found it was a lot of work with the 3 steps. Definitely not a cookie. probably won't make again.

Tasty but not exactly a cookie. I must have used too much jam; they came out a bit squishy and runny. Better to eat them with a fork! Not too bad overall.
