This recipe kind of surprised me. The peaches were unexpected but a great addition to this recipe. I didn’t have a red onion but the white onion seemed to be ok. The next time I make this, I’m for sure using the red onion and I think I’ll get a different jerk seasoning to see if it might enhance the flavor more than the one I used. Also, my Boys loved this recipe! Thanks for a great recipe!
