This was a wonderful dish! I highly recommend this pasta and it is in my regular rotation. I prepare it with the following changes: use a 15 oz. can of diced basil seasoned tomatoes (not drained) instead of the fresh tomatoes, use the entire package of basil feta cheese, stir approx. 5 oz. of shredded asiago cheese into the pasta prior to mixing with chicken.  DO NOT CUT THE PASTA IN HALF as other reviewers have suggested. This spaghetti isn't super saucy and liquidy like many Americans expect and that could be why people suggested using less pasta. The asiago cheese adds texture and flavor to the pasta.  If you use the amount of pasta called for, this meal will go a long way.  Enjoy!

Hi, everyone!  I'm so glad to see that people have enjoyed my recipe.  I didn't even know it had been posted until I "googled" my name the other day (just curious, ya know?!?!)  Anyway, having read through the reviews and suggestions, I would like to make a few clarifications to the recipe.  I always use Paul Prudhomme's blackened redfish magic, and I realize now that I usually only use 1/2 to 2/3 box of angel hair pasta.  Hope that helps, and thanks again for the good reviews.  Enjoy!
PS:  I didn't know how to post notes to your own recipe, hence posting here in reviews.
Thanks again, 
Molly

What a great meal!
It had a very nice bite to it and would go great with wine.
The Feta Cheese is crucial to this pasta dish.
I made this for my girlfriend over a weekend!

Killer!  I made it without the chicken and it was incredibly good.  Will definitely make again and again.  As a side note, this dish is extremely spicy with the 2 tablespoons of cajun seasoning - you may want to adjust if you don't like it too spicy.

This is a staple in our house! We have been making it since 2005 and I am just now rating it! haha. We always keep these ingredients on hand and we make it quiet often! This recipe is great as is... but, we add a few other ingredients depending on our mood. One change we always make is we use roasted garlic because we like the flavor it gives off. Some other items we sometimes include are: mushrooms, black olives, artichokes, and crispy bacon.  This is a keeper! Oh by the way- we have made this many times for company and always get rave reviews!

I've made this in the past and enjoyed it, but my husband didn't really care for it.  I was making for a potluck for work, and somehow, I forgot to buy chicken for the chicken spaghetti!  I subbed Italian sausage, and what a difference!  It was amazing, and my husband's already begging for it again! At the potluck, they were scraping the pot clean!

They should rename this recipe "Crack Pasta". This is one of the best meals I have ever eaten. It's so simple and fast that you wouldn't think it would be that good, but it is. It even reheats great and tastes great cold the next day. If you can get over the idea of a sauceless pasta (it didn't sound quite right to me either) and give this a try you're going to make a lot of people happy in your house. If you're a feta fan, you will wonder where this recipe has been all your life.

I've been making this for about three years now since one of my college roomates turned me on to it. I'm married now and still making it- even my husband, who is somewhat choosy about food, loves it and actually requests that I make it. I will say that it is much better with the freshest tomatoes you can get... during the winter, tomatoes from the store can be a bit bland, and because tomatoes are a huge part of this recipe, the dish will be a bit bland because of it. So, I think it's best during the summer with fresh farmer's market or your own garden-grown tomatoes (which are tangier and more flavorful than anything you'll buy in the store), or canned diced tomatoes with plenty of Italian herbs in them. All else being equal, though, the fresh tomatoes will taste better and have less sodium than canned. Try this recipe!

This is a definite keeper!  Instead of using chopped romas, I halved 1/2 a pint of grape tomatoes, used an Italian spice mix from my grinder, and used multigrain pasta.  The feta cheese is a must, and sliced kalamata olives would also add good flavor if you like them.  Thanks for a delicious & easy recipe!!!

Delicious! We just found out my husband is diabetic, so I used whole wheat thin spaghetti noodles. I felt like such a gourmet and my husband loved it! I used Zataran's Creole seasoning, I'm not sure if it's a blackened seasoning, but it was great.

Thank you so much for this recipe. My hubby, Granddaughter, and I all loved it. This gets better as a left-over, which is how the grandaughter got to try it. I used 2 cans of Italian seasoned tomatoes (garlic and basil), 12 oz angel hair pasta, no salt and pepper and it was still fantastic. My only complaint was that the first time I made this there was just the 2 of us. Can't wait to fix this for company. This makes quite a large batch.
  
*  I just had to up-date you on this
recipe! Since I started preparing this I have become an addict! Nearly all winter I kept a batch of this in the fridge. I have made it with every kind of pasta and today I used the Fideo type AND used canned white meat chicken because of a time crunch. This is my favorite way to prepare it now.  Everyone that has tried this loves it and asks for the recipe. I never have made it with the roma tomatoes cause the canned ones work so well. Sometimes I think I'm going to turn into an Italian. Thank you over and over again!!

Sorry, I don't agree with the others.  I don't like pasta by itself so I'd prefer a little more "juice" as it was VERY dry.  Maybe canned tomatoes would make a difference.  We drizzled olive oil over the top to make it a little more palatable.  Next time I would also break the angel hair pasta or use half the amount called for.  There was way too much.

I subbed 2 cans of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes for the 10 romas, and it came out wonderfully. Absolutely fantastic recipe -- and easy too! Definite keeper! *****

Great recipe! I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic and basil in place of fresh tomatoes because I couldn't find nice ones at the grocer, and they really worked well. The juice in the canned tomatoes helped to create more sauce for the pasta, otherwise I think it may be too dry. Also I cut the pasta in half. Used parm instead of feta and it was great. Really tasty and easy. Will be making this one again!

This made a really quick, tasty dinner. The flavors were good, although I added a little more cajun seasoning than the recipe called for out of preference.

I didn't think this recipe was anything too special, but I love feta and thought I'd try a new recipe! I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil and garlic already added but added some extra minced garlic (we love garlic!) too. I used regular cajun seasoning and grilled it to get the "blackened" effect, then cut it into bite sized pieces. I also felt that it needed another veg, so I sliced up some zucchini. We enjoy a "meatier" pasta so I used spaghetti instead of (in my opinion) wimpier angelhair. Overall, a really tasty dish! Next time I'll use fresh basil and more cajun seasoning for more flavor.

This recipe was good.  Those who ate it, said that it was a little dry.  I'd suggest adding a small can of tomato sauce so it has a little bit more of sauce to it.  What the recipes calls for doesn't seem to do the trick.  Other than that, everyone loved it!

Great recipe!!!  I halved the creole and basil since I don't like it TOO hot and it was perfect.  Used grape tomatoes, added broccoli and used leftover rotissorie chicken.  Can think of other veges to use next time.

I loved all the seasonings in this recipe!  Although it was really spicy. So I think I will add half of the cajan seasoning that it asked for. Very Delicious.  It changes up your regular ground beef spagetti.  Enjoy! We Did!

Delicious, easy to fix with ingredients I always have on hand. I used spaghetti squash, and instead of the blackened seasoning (did not have any and when I found a recipe on another site, it was much too spicy for me!), I used about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I cut the recipe in half for two people, but we could have eaten the full recipe!

Substitued:
Chicken Breast- Whole Chicken Stripped
Cajun Style- Cheyenne Pepper
10 Roma Tomatoes- Canned Tomatoes

SO GOOD! The Basil kicked the chicken up amazingly. And the feta cheese definitely is the star here.

This is a great flavorful recipe.  My husband and I both love it.  I have made it several times now.  I use fresh basil and a salt-free homemade cajun seasoning from Scotdog from this site.   I used olive oil cooking spray instead of the olive oil.  I sprinkled the cajun seasoning on the chicken and cooked the chicken in the skillet.  Once cooked I removed the chicken and deglazed the pan with a little white wine and added the garlic and tomatoes.  The feta cheese makes this dish.  It is delicous with the cajun seasoning and the tomatoes and basil.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was ok.  It needed more sauce.  Also, I used the only cajun seasoning my store had, but it wasn't that spicy.  Still, if you can add something to make it more saucey and spread the flavor around, it will be good.

I loved this delicious, easy, healthy pasta dish!  Instead of fresh I used whole,canned plum tomatoes, and broke them up slightly in the pan.  I was afraid there was too many spices, but it  was perfect!  Next time I will add another can of tomatoes for a bit more sauce.

Superb recipe! I used McCormick's Cajun Seasoning (not sure if this was the correct thing!) and added plenty of it! (We like pretty spicy food!) Also, I used a regular can of diced tomatoes. This is really easy and flavorsome, and pretty healthy too. I topped it with crumbled basil and sun-dried tomato feta cheese, but it didn't taste any different to regular! Will definitely be making this again. Thanks, Molly!

I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and it turned out very well.  Next time I would drain most of the liquid off first, but it was excellent.  The leftovers were good reheated later too!

Easy and delicious.  I used garlic salt in leiu of fresh garlic and hothouse tomatoes (2 large) instead of the grape tomatoes.  I let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  I will definitely make this one again.

Very easy and very good.  I replaced two of the chicken breast halves by a pound of steamed asperagus.

California Chicken Spaghetti Haiku: "Way too much pasta. Could use a little color. But wow, it was good!" Let's see, I reduced the angel hair (I used around 10 oz.), threw in some frozen (thawed, drained) spinach for color, and had to halve the blackened seasoning (which, incidentally was the seasoning from AR's "Blackened Salmon Fillets" recipe) for the tender tastebuds of a younger diner. Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe, and was really pleased! Like another reviewer said, it was almost like a meal one would order at Olive Garden. And feta is key! I can't imagine this dish w/o the feta on top!

this is one of my favorite go-to recipes because it is uncomplicated and relatively few ingredients. one thing i have found has ruined it is using canned tomatoes. resist the urge! :) i use different pasta depending on what i have on hand. i usually make it with penne though. sounds disgusting, but is actually good as a cold salad the next day. and when i make it for company i leave the feta out and let people add as little or as much as they'd like, it's one of those finnicky cheeses. :)

This was a little too spicy for my family, and I halved the Cajun spice. I didn't even dare give it to my three old.  Bu the husband and I still really liked the other flavors,  I will definately make this again with maybe 1/4 T of cajun spice. It tasted like something I would order at a restaurant and it was SO easy! Really everyone should try this one.  I e-mailed the recipe to my mom as soon as we were finished eating it. But seriously, start with less cajun spice and add according to your taste.

I've made this recipe twice now and I love it.  My roommate doesn't like anything spicy so I only used a tbs and a half of blackened seasoning and added some italian seasoning.  I also used tomato basil feta instead of plain. . . yummy!

Very fast recipe!  I added half of an onion, two cans of seasoned diced tomatos, and a ton of salt, pepper, cajun seasoning and garlic.  My mistake was adding too much garlic...this isn't a garlic dish so go EASY on the garlic and heavy on the cajun seasoning and you'll be happy

This is definately a winner.It took a little longer to make than I thought it would just because of dicing all the tomatoes but after eating it I'll gladly make this again.But be warned though,this is a bit on the spicy side.If I was making this for my folks I'd only use 1 teaspoon of cajun seasonings.For myself though I thought this had just the right amount of spice.

i will give it a 5 but i did add some ingred. on my own.  the family has spoken and they say, "you can fix this one again, mom".  so i will.  i added onions, and mushrooms.  i also used the suggestion to add a can of the diced tomatoes with garlic and peppers to give it more juice. don't be shy on the blackening seasoning it is great.

This was really good but I have some words of wisdom. Don't be scared of using the blackening seasoning- It is perfect with 2 T and not too spicy. After reading the other reviews I have to wonder if some others were using creole seasoning. Big difference. Make sure it says blackening seasoning. I used grape tomatoes and wheat pasta. It was perfect.

Oh goodness, this was a great recipe!  We just had this for dinner and it was fabulous.  I didn't change a thing about it and it was incredible-a great summer meal.  This was very easy to prepare and tasted so good, I know I will make this frequently.  Thanks Molly for sharing such a great recipe.  By the way, I told my hubby what a previous reviewer remarked about this recipe and he was in agreement-this recipe is that worthy-haha.  :)

Let me just tell you, I cant cook ANYTHING. Cooking is very intimidating to me, but I tried this dish, and to my surprise it turned out amazing!! My boyfriend was pleasantly surprised. I added McCormicks Chicken Garlic & Herb seasoning and it was great! Next time I'll try peppers or onions. Thanks!

this was so good.  I can't wait to make it again.  Instead of the blackened cajun spice, since I couldn't find it I used the McCormick's new 1 Step Chicken Seasoning Jambalaya.  It was incredible, I had company and they all loved it.

Not bad, watch your added salt with the Cajun seasoning, it wound up being too salty and my son ate buttered noodles for dinner instead. Will definitely try this one again but with a few modifications

Great dish!!!  Absolutely 5 stars, and my daughter just packed it for her lunch tomorrow before we've even cleared the table.  Alterations:  as suggested, used the entire box of angel hair pasta, used 1 15oz can of seasoned diced tomatoes (I might use 2 cans next time), only 1/2 T of Emeril's Bayou seasoning.  To serve, I placed all the pasta into a large pasta dish, poured the chicken/tomatoe mix on top, added a layer of asiago cheese (very thin layer), and then covered it with regular feta.  Delicious!!  :-)

I followed this recipe exactly except I only had a jar of 3 cheese sauce and used that. My husband loved this recipe, but my 3 year old couldn't eat it (too hot)and my 8 year old struggled even though very good, too hot. Next I time will use 1tablespoon of cajun seasoning.

This recipes is great, it is easy and delicious.  I dressed it up a bit with fresh basil and artichokes, and thickened the sauce with corn starch and water....but all in all, this is a winner.  I would feel comfortable serving this as a standard family meal or for various guests.

I tried this recipe last night with my husband and he just LOVED it! I substituted the Cajun seasoning with Franks Red Hot and a little goes a long way. I also had my husband grill the chicken outside and it came out EXCELLENT! I would make this recipe again in a heartbeat.

This is a highly requested meal in my home. I was concerned about the spices used in this recipe, but believe me, it is just right!! 
I love the spicy flavor of the Cajun seasoning combined with the diced tomatoes and cool, tangy Feta cheese. It is a real crowd pleaser, and there are never any leftovers. This is the perfect flavor escape from plain spaghetti.
Note: I enjoy adding extra diced tomatoes to the dish.

This was very good. I did't use fresh tomatoes. I used canned crushed tomatoes with basil. I only used 1 T of the Cajun Seasoning (did't have Blackend) and it was the perfect amount of heat. Tossed with Whole Wheat angel hair.  It only took about 20 mins from start to finish!

This was very tasty and simple to make.  I used a 28-ounce can of diced tomatoes (drained), and it turned out great.  Will definitely make again!

I made this last night, and it was terrific. I used extra feta cheese, and tore pieces of basil into the pasta at the very end. Very creative and delicious meal--the tangy-ness from the cheese is perfect with the zestiness of the cajun spices. Heavenly! Thanks

Not bad.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic for a little more flavor and sauce.  My husband thought it was still too dry.

I was looking for a pasta dish to serve my book club and decided this one sounded interesting.  It was just different enough from other things we'd tried to warrant a shot.  While it was simple enough to prepare, in the end I found it a little salty.  My guests all loved it though, so I've decided that it was just me (I don't tend to salt my food, so I'm probably a little sensitive).  Overall, good enough to try again for my husband, since he missed out.  Thanks!

Good hot or cold.  My addition is a small can of sliced black olives.  Adds taste and a nice color contrast.

Simply perfect.  I added artichoke hearts because I like them.  I also took a previous poster's advice and used diced tomatoes from a can to save time.  Definitely going in the menu rotation.

Loooove this!  I added an onion, a little more garlic, and a lot of feta!  I used about 6 roma tomatoes diced plus one can of diced tomatoes undrained.  Taste is wonderful and it's very easy to make...different, too!

I might have given this 5 stars had I not had to dice 10 tomatoes... It had a little more prep work than I care to do.  BUT my 14-year-old son who's fairly hard to please LOVED it. Finding recipes that he enjoys makes dicing those tomatoes worthwhile... LOL  My hubby liked it but didn't rave.  My 5-year-old wouldn't have touched it because of the spiciness, but I just washed some of the chicken off in water and she ate it just fine.   I also really liked the addition of the feta cheese on top. I'm sure I'll be making this one again.

I used whole wheat angel hair, canned diced tomatos (seasoned with garlic & basil and also added extra fresh of both), and the Paul Prudhomme seasoning. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms, and used both feta and fresh parmesan cheese. The meat had a wonderful flavor, and the meal felt overall very light and healthy, and it was SO EASY and fast!! I will be making this about once a week from now on.

this was terrific!  i love simple pasta dishes, and this one really tops the charts.  i added more garlic (because i just LOVE garlic!) and used garlic & herb feta cheese.  i served with some crusty italian bread and made a simple "italian butter" by crumbling some of the feta on a small plate and drizzling with extra virgin olive oil, seasoning with salt and pepper.  yum!!  thanks molly! :)

I've made this several times and it is a family favorite.  I substitute canned diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes as it makes it extra juicy.  We also like the spice so we use more cajun than it calls for.  Great recipe!

This was really good for throwing random items into the ingredient search. I used cherry tomatoes, a ton of fresh basil, and added a lot more feta. I think if you happen to have some fresh parsley or basil on hand it really brightens it up. If you like this recipe you should try the Cajun Pasta Fresca from this site too. Both are good and easy.

this was very easy to make and very good. i'm eating it as i type this review!! i did change it up a little bit though..i first sauteed some chopped onions and garlic then added the chicken (i ALWAYS add onions and garlic to my dishes) also, i didn't have any fresh tomatoes so i used 1 can of diced tomatoes and it still came out delicious!! it's a little spicy for my husband, but it's perfect for me..i will definitely be making this again!! thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love this recipe. My husband hates tomatoes, and he still loves this and can't wait for me to make it again. I've made it with and without the chicken and both are amazing. I used Tony Sachery's seasoning.

We thought this was really good....a twist on regular chicken speghetti (with the cream of mushroom soup & processed cheese)--at least somewhat healthier.  The feta made it extra yummmy.  I did  grill my chicken breasts (seasoned w/cajun blackening and put the rest in the saute) to almost done and then sliced and added to the saute mix.  I let that cook until tomatoes where soft.  I also added a small chopped onion.

I agree with the previous raters-the feta is critical to this dish and I also did not find the need to cut the pasta in half or use any less. I did use less Blackened Seasoning because I have younger kids who are not fans of spicy foods. WONDERFUL DISH!!

Good recipe - nice change from traditional spaghetti and sauce. I used http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Simple-Cajun-Seasoning/Detail.aspx  for the cajun seasoning and it worked quite well. Might make again but wasn't mind-blowingly tasty.

This was good but it was really salty and REALLY spicy!! I served it with rice instead of pasta though. Next time I make it I think I will use less salt and spice.

I loved this recipe, I changed a few things but only because I did not have the other ingredients on hand.  I used spagettini instead of angel hair, and a few red pepper flakes instead of blackened seasoning and diced canned tomatoes the feta cheese adds a wonderful flavour. This is definately going to be a regular at our house.

Very good! I too used canned diced tomatoes (2 cans garlic and olive oil) The cajun was too spicy for my daughters, they are picky! I love spicy! Next time I will decrease the amount of cajun seasoning. The Feta was a hit with everyone in the family. This will be a regular at our home! Oh, and for those not using fresh basil...one tsp. of dried basil is plenty. But fresh is way better!Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish is simply delicious - restaurant quality!  I have made it several times for company and everyone raves about it.  I did add artichoke hearts and black olives with the tomatoes as others have suggested.  It's hard to believe how fast and easy it is to make this and still have it taste like you're eating at an italian restaurant.  Thanks so much for the posting!

With some guests coming over for dinner, I wanted to make something tasty and different and this was it. Simple to follow, this recipe yielded a very tasty dish. I used diced canned tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes to save some time and it worked out well. Will definitely make again and again.

Delicious!  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano, chopped the tomatoes in my zyliss chopper (to eliminate the big pieces due to preference)Used a whole box of angel hair pasta (it was a little too much for the amount of sauce I made) used a blackened chicken recipe from this site and served with the feta cheese on top. It is very light and very tasty and will certainly be made many times in our house!

Wow wow wow!  What a great combination of flavors!  I was short on time so I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil already in it (worked like a charm - probably will do that next time :)  Also added some chopped artichokes per a friend's suggestion - that was great too.  Lovely, can't wait to make again!

Great dish!

I made the following change when I couldn't find the cajun seasoning.  I used Montreal Chicken seasoning instead, in the same proportion and my partner loved it!

I also used real basil instead of the dry - it smells so much better while it cooks!

Such a nice alternative to "regular" spaghetti! I used fresh basil (MUCH better flavor), and used a mixture of fresh tomatoes and store bought sauce to make a saucier product. Very good!

I only used 1 tbsp of the blackened seasoning because I am not big on spicy things and I also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh.
Thanks! :D

Fabulous!  I was not able to find blackened seasoning, so I substituted cajun seasoning, decreasing the quantity to 1 tablespoon to compensate for saltiness.  I added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to give the dish a little kick.  As was recommended in previous reviews, I added a small can of sliced olives and a small jar of quartered artichokes in brine, both drained well.  This would make a nice, simple dinner for company.

Excellent recipe.  Our friend who is a picky eater actually cleaned his plate.  Using the canned tomatoes made it real easy.  Added a little fat-free half and half.  Cooked the entire dish,except for the pasta, and then just heated before serving.

This is my husband's favorite meal.  The feta cheese really makes this meal wonderful. I'm not a big basil fan, so I only add 1 TBSP.  We love tomatoes so I add about 4 more roma tomatoes, which also keeps it from being dry.  Great recipe!

I found it was too dry with just chopped tomatoes, so I made it again with a large can of diced tomatoes instead.  Replaced dried basil with fresh as well. It was so, so tasty! My husband loved it!  I added a bit more cajun spice as we like our food hot and it was great. This is now a staple in our house!

I made this dish last night. I used about 2/3 the amount of oil and spices, and it was fine. The chicken pieces should be cut very small, so that they are covered with the spices. I also used canned diced tomatoes, and mixed some asiago cheese with the feta. Everyone loved the flavors.

Wonderful summer supper!  So fast and easy.  I added a little white wine and red pepper flakes when simmering the chicken.  Also substituted some sun-dried tomatoes for some of the Roma and used fresh basil instead of dried.  Had a little grated parmesan cheese, so added that at the end with the feta.  Yum!

this is a GREAT recipe - i think i've actually convinced my friends that i know how to cook! it's really easy and pretty quick, so i definitely suggest this one. i cut the cajun seasoning to 1 tbsp because i don't like things really spicy, and it was still pretty hot, so i'm going to cut the spice even more next time - but there will DEFINITELY be a next time! i paired this with an easy, quick focaccia bread i found on this site and made "italian butter" with some of the leftover feta cheese, olive oil and pepper - they all agreed i can cook for them next time, too! thanks, molly! we LOVED it!

I really enjoyed this dish, but I also have an insane love for peppery dishes, which the combination of dry basil, cajun seasoning, and black pepper provides. So, be careful with the "to taste" pepper. I added less than a half teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper and it was too peppery for my wife.

This was so simple and easy to make...  It tasted amazing!!!  I found a cajun spice blend on google that was also easy as well and I had almost all the spices on hand.  I will certainly make this again!!!

This was an easy and delicious meal.  I did made some tweaks to it: I passed on the cajun seasoning, since my grocery store didn't have any.  I also used grape and cherry tomatoes instead of roma tomatoes, pot-sized angel hair pasta instead of regular angel hair pasta (I recommend it, since you don't have to break the pasta in half), and minced garlic instead of crushed garlic. I would make it again someday.

Good stuff! I did add some sliced black olives, but other than that stayed true to the original. It's a kind of puttanesca, but with a little Cajun touch.

This is my go to chicken spaghetti recipe!! I didn't modify on purpose but I do use Cajun seasoning instead of the blackened seasoning. That was an honest mistake from the very beginning that we loved!

This was really good!  Made it as stated in the recipe but you could definitely sauté some mushrooms or artichoke hearts or asparagus tips etc. I'm not a huge fan of angel hair pasta so next time I would just us thin spaghetti but that wouldn't change the taste.

Excellent dish with just the right amount of spice.  As a few others have noted, I did use canned tomatoes instead of fresh so that I'd get a bit more juice, as I don't like my pasta very dry either.  I also added some sliced black olives to the mix, which gave it a very nice touch.  This is definitely on my list of go-to recipes when I need a quick dinner that's sure to impress.

Very tasty dish. However I did find that the chicken doesn't taste great as leftovers. I will certainly make this again, but will try it with sausage or shrimp. I also followed the suggestion of adding some shredded Asiago to the pasta before mixing with the sauce.

This has become one of our families favorite meal.  I have added it to my rotation. I follow the recipe almost exactly, except I alternate between fresh and canned tomotoes, and it tastes delicious either way.

This is excellent.  I followed the recipe with the only difference being that I used a large can (28floz) diced tomatoes, partially drained, instead of fresh, and I added a partial jar of artichoke hearts - others had mentioned them and I wanted to use them up.  I had no Cajun seasoning so I made Blackened Seasoning from this website.  I'll be making this dish again really soon for company.  My husband's still raving about it.  Thanks, Jakesmom31, for wonderful taste treat using ingredients that I almost always have on hand.

This was excellent & the sauce it makes as it is cooking down is "soppable". It makes you want to dip it up with bread or just eat it plain!

This is a tasty dish, but it's HOT! Be careful. I halved the cajun seasoning and used Montreal Chicken seasoning for the other half and it was still hot. The plum tomatoes give just barely enough sauce for the pasta; I could see using another 1/4 cup of liquid, probably chicken stock. Used a healthy amount of fresh basil at the end - added a nice fresh flavor. All in all a good dish.

Altogether NOT spectacular. I did make some modifications based on what I had available: used 1 can diced tomatoes (as suggested by other users) and regular cajun seasoning because I didn't have cajun blackening seasoning. I also used 100% whole wheat angel hair (we abandoned white pasta long ago). The dish turned out spicy, but nothing to write home about. I doubt I'll make it again.

This was a great recipe--my whole family loved it  I didn't purposely make any changes, but realized that my box of pasta was 14 oz, rather than 16.  As many other reviewers mentioned, I will probably reduce the amount of pasta next time I make it.  I did use roma tomatoes--not very good quality due to the season, so I think this will be even better once homegrown tomatoes are available.  It was not over-spiced by the cajun seasoning, so I can only assume that there is varying spiciness depending on the brand.

My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I was worried it would be too dry, but it wasn't at all when using the appropriate amount of pasta. I also drizzled a small amount of extra virgin olive oil over it when finished. The Cajun spice I bought wasn't spicy enough, unfortunately. Next time I'll make sure it's a little hotter. Also, I think the addition of zucchini with the tomato would be delicious.

LOVED IT!!! This dish was soo simple to make, and everyone in my family loved it, even my picky eater!!! The only thing i changed was I cut the blackend seasoning in half because it would have been too hot for my 2yr old otherwise. I have made this several times and my family loves it everytime i make it!

the spice mix is calibrated for fresh tomoatoes, so you have to watch the salt when using canned tomatoes. cajun spice mix has a ton of salt. canned tomatoes do, too. so taste as you go. i recommend less than 1 Tbsp of cajun spice mix to start and no table salt.

Great dish.  Used Zatarain's Blackened Seasoning and reduced the amount by half.  If I had used the full amount it would have been to spicy.  Did not need to add salt because of the salt in the blackened seasoning.  Also, reduced the amount of spaghetti in the dish by half.  I used fresh basil instead of dried and low fat feta. If I have to make revisions to a recipe I do not give it five stars.  The flavors in the dish complemented the fresh ingredients.  A good low fat dish with great flavors.  Will definately make again.

I make this once a week I use one tin of diced tomatoes with juice I find diced romas did not have enough flavour. Best the next day when reheated, great leftovers.

So I made this last night, and my husband and I thought it was fantastic. I think the only thing I would change in the future would be to add the tomatoes just before the pasta, toss and serve. I prefer fresh tomato pasta to be warmed rather than cooked. The tomatoes got kind of soupy and didn't retain their shape as much as I'd like. Other than that, we loved it!

This is a very flavorful recipe. We enjoyed every last bite. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, fresh basil (6 tablespoons is equal to 2 tablespoons dried) and added a little more cajun spice (we like spice). I didn't add salt, you won't need it with the other spices. An absolutely great recipe, I'll be making it a lot. My husband loved it.

This recipe was good. I will make it again but with some fresh spinach maybe. Very easy to make. I also used a lg. can of diced Italian tomatoes for a quicker preparation.

This is my all time favorite recipe from this site.  The only difference we make is that we add quite a bit more of the seasonings.  It is just sooo good.  It is also really good cold as a pasta salad.

Nice dinner, relatively easy to cook, and not as heavy as a pasta with canned spaghetti sauce.  Forgot to buy angel hair so we used spaghetti and it worked fine.  Next time, the more feta the better!

I'm also a Jake's mom. My family loves this recipe and my husband is not usually a fan of pasta. The only thing I did was add three zucchini. Delish!!

I did not care for this recipe at all. I think what turned me off was that my pasta didn't have any flavor. I'm not sure if I'm used to having an alfredo or tomato sauce, but besides that It was not my favorite. What I did like about it was the chicken and the feta cheese. I think I'm going to put feta cheese on my spaghetti dishes for now on.

Really liked this. Only change we made was to substitute canned stewed tomatoes since fresh are in short supply right now with the salmonella outbreak.

I halved this recipe for just the two of us.  It was very good and worth making again.  I might add more feta cheese next time.

The first time I made this my husband said it was too spicy--which is spicy considering I am the spice queen.  The second time I made this I shook the Cajun seasoning lightly over the chicken, I also added a little oregano and extra garlic. Instead of fresh roma tomatoes I used a large can of petite diced tomatoes--undrained is better. I also used the basil tomatoe feta cheese to top it-yum.

I am trying to eat healthier so I use whole wheat angel hair pasta instead.  Once the chicken was cooked I sauteed red onion and fresh spinach with the garlic and basil.  It was delicious!  My meat and potatoes Boyfriend loved it too!

I followed the recipe exactly but we (my husband and I) did not care for this at all.  We love Feta cheese but it would have been better to just put a little olive oil on the spaghetti and sprinkle the feta on top.  I won't make this again.

I made this quick and easy pasta the other night for supper, but I made a few changes.  First, I cut the recipe in half as there were only 3 of us eating it (and one of us is a 2 year old...so he doesn't eat much).  I altered the amount of seasoning to 1 tsp each of cajun and basil and I also used canned, diced Italian seasoned tomatoes instead of fresh.  Lastly, I used garlic and herb seasoned feta cheese.  To be honest, the cheese was sort of lost in the seasoning of the chicken....but the end result was pretty darn good and very quick to put together.

This was pretty good. I don't know if I will make it again though, without making a few changes. There didn't seem like there was enough sauce. And a different cheese other than feta might be better.

This is a nice dish.  Using another reviewer's suggestion, I used 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes instead of fresh for more juice.  I only had a little over a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning left, so that is all I used - and it was nicely flavored.  I think that next time, I might cut back a bit on the basil and/or add fresh basil.  Then end product was riddled with basil flecks - not terribly pretty.  However, I will be careful, because the taste was quite good.  I did add artichoke hearts and olives.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical when I sampled just the chicken and tomatoes. I didn't like it until after I added the noodles and feta. Next time I make it I will skip the chicken. I used penne (only 8 oz.) because I think it looks prettier when it's tossed. :)

The flavor of this recipe is really phenomenal, but it was really too dry (not any sauce to speak of). I think next time I will try it with canned tomatoes instead of the romas, and maybe half of the angel hair. It tastes so good though, I can't wait to experiment with it again!

This was one of the best recipes I've tried through allrecipes! Very tasty, very fresh, and very flavorable. I love roma tomatoes and this was a great way to cook them. I used a cajun seasoning I found at Target, the Archer Farms brand. Worked like a charm. This was an easy and quick recipe!

Delicious! I made it just as it was with just a little less Cajun Seasoning (my family doesn't like spicy foods), and it turned out great, the flavor's delicious. My whole family loved it. I will make again and again.

Not bad, an a nice change, but had to give a 3 because I have to make to many adjustments. My husband thought it was a 4, but he agreed it needed tweeking. Will make again w/quantity of spices changed. Suggestions of adding zucchini we'll try along w/maybe adding mushrooms.

I'd give this one 4.5 stars.  Very tasty, not too spicy.  Overall, really good!  I added extra tomatoes for our families personal preference.

My family enjoyed this.  I think it could use a little more flavor.  But overall it was good.

I would definitely make again- but I think I would try fresh basil instead. This is a great combination of flavors!

This is a great recipe for company! Very flavorful. I might use less cajun seasoning next time--it was a little spicy. I served with garlic bread and a caesar salad.

This is definitely a good, light recipe!!  I used ~1/4 cup of Ragu: Old World Style Spagetti Sauce in addition to the roma tomatoes b/c I wanted it to be kind of saucy.  I also added ~1/4 cup white cooking wine, so it wouldn't seem too much like spagetti sauce.  And finally, I sprinkled some shredded cheese (blend of Mozarella, Asiago, Romano) on top.  It was tasty!!

I am not a big pasta fan, but I love this recipe. It is very light and flavorful, and it is pretty healthy since the sauce is made from olive oil and fresh tomatoes (and I use whole wheat angel hair).  I have made this for many guests, and it has always gotten rave reviews.  It also reheats very nicely, and I love to have leftovers to eat for lunch or dinner the next day.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

A favorite from this site. I have been making this for about 3 years. It does give me heartburn! Husband is not too crazy about tomatoes so I usually leave those out.

It was good!  People liked it - but I am not sure it was great enough to make again and again.  Nice dinner - nothing to write home about.

I thought this was very bland. There was a spicy kick but it lacked flavor. I was looking fwd to the recipe because I love the ingredients..but it really missed the mark. I made it exactly as written. Even my husband who loves spicy food didn't like it. Sorry. It is missing something, don't know what..but it needs some added flavor.

This is an excellent recipe, I encourage you to try it!   The small changes I made were to use a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh (which incidentally is one of the greatest things to come along since sliced bread!!! I use them all the time),  reduced the dried basil and added some fresh, and I used Chef Paul's Magic Salmon seasonings(!) instead of the cajun.  I will be making this easy yet DELICIOUS recipe often.

This was great though I don't think I used the right Cajun Seasoning. It tasted similar to another recipe I found on here (Pasta Pomodoro). I added extra things: garlic powder, oregano, sugar, crushed red pepper, chicken bouillon, and used chicken broth to dilute the sauce. I also used a can of crushed tomato with some fresh ones. Loved the feta cheese, we used a bit more than called for. My one year old ate this up so I'll be making this time and time again! =)

This was a neat alternative to traditional spaghetti. My friends and I are wimpy about spicy so it was a little too hot for us.

I absolutely love this recipe and so does everyone that I make it for!  It does take a little longer than 30 minutes but it's worth the time.  The feta is the "icing on the cake".  I love it!  Thanks Molly!

Great flavor for the chicken but not enough sauce - would be great with 1/2 as much pasta.

This is a simple, easy recipe!  I have made this many times for friends and when I like to feed a big crowd, and someone always asks me for the recipe.  It makes tons of food, so I'll usually cut the recipe in 1/2 depending on the number of people that I'm cooking for.  I also don't add in all of the cajun seasoning that is called for.  If people would like more, they can always sprinkle as much of it as they like on their own portion.  That way everybody is happy!  Very great recipe overall!

I make this recipe often and always get compliments on it.  Something about tomatoes, basil and feta cheese- yum.  And a good thing is you can adjust the cajun seasoning depending on how spicy you like things.

Not only is this very good, it is quick to prepare.  Great meal to make after coming home from work.
