I'm usually not so adventurous to try a recipe that only has four previous reviews, but this one caught my attention and just sounded intriguing. It also had all the ingredients we love. Anyway, as you can tell by my 5 rating, we loved it!!! I have only made this once, but am planning on making it again this week. It was super easy to put together because most of the ingredients are from a can, which I was a bit skeptical about. However, this recipe tasted anything but like it was from a can! Like another review, I too used the diced green chilies instead of the jalapenos. It had the perfect amount of spice to sweetness. It is super chunky and I had my doubts about a couple of my kids eating it when I added the corn, but they all raved about it and have requested it several times since. I tasted it when I was simmering and immediately fell in love! Of course, upon seeing my reaction each of the kids wanted a preview taste too and then no one could wait for the noodles to finish cooking so we could eat! This is definitely a keeper and will be added to our family recipe box for good! I would have given this a 5+ if that was an option!!

Delicious, hearty and definitely a keeper.  I did make a few changes - sauteed and onion and a big clove of garlic instead of using onion and garlic powders.  Also subbed leftover roasted chicken breast for the chicken tenders - green chilies and some crushed red pepper flakes for the jalepenos (daughter is allergic) and omitted the olives.  We really liked the corn. Lovcd finding a recipe that I can just throw together on a busy night.  Thanks!

This recipe is pretty near perfect!  I did modify it based on what I had on had and our personal tastes.  And it still turned out great!

I used a canned chicken breast from Costco (12.5 oz.) instead of the tenderloins, spaghetti sauce with meat, Red Gold canned tomatoes with green chiles, no jalapenos, no olives (yuck), no onion powder, using a leftover half cup of chopped onions instead.  I had about half can of black beans leftover, so I threw those in.  And I used regular thin spaghetti, as I didn't have any angelhair.  It was a quick and easy recipe to make, and my picky eater even liked it!  Had just the right amount of spicyness for the kids.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very nice change from regular spaghetti. I do think it needs more chicken if you plan on serving 8 but other than that I have no complaints.

I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for this dish.  I left out the black olives (don't care for them) and used 3 large chicken breasts rather than tenderloins but I don't think those changes affected the end result.  The dish tasted fine and there's nothing wrong with the recipe itself, but I guess we just prefer a more traditional spaghetti.

I made this recipe for something different than plain ole spaghetti.  I used diced green peppers instead of the jalepenos and 3 chicken breasts I cut into strips and seasoned with garlic salt. I also didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I diced 3 small tomatoes and used a small can of tomatoe sauce in place of that.  Used frozen corn instead of a can of corn.  As I do with my regular spaghetti sauce  I always add a little bit of baking soda to cut the acidity and a teaspoon or two of sugar.  Its cooking now, and I anticipate it to be very good!

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this recipe.  It was quick, it was easy, and a family pleaser.  I used diced green chiles in place of jalapenos, used a deboned roasted chicken, and skipped the black olives.  Next time I'll add them, they would've been good!

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and will make it again!  It is chunky, flavorful, and looks appealing; very satisfying on all levels.  I used more chicken than it called for based on one review, and won't do that again.  I am pretty sure this recipe would be just as good with no meat at all and I plan on trying that.   I made a few changes just because I was trying to impress, but I am not sure they really added to the flavor.  I used a large onion, chopped,  in place of onion powder and about 5 cloves of garlic, chopped, in place of the garlic powder.  I added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms, saut√©ed,  and used plain spaghetti sauce.  And I used a small can of chopped chili peppers instead of jalapeno peppers.  So tasty!  Thank you for this easy recipe!

This is fantastic! I made a double batch to feed a family of 4 with mega eaters but we had a good amount left over. I used home sliced tomatoes, gluten free spaghetti, tomato paste for some thickening and regular chicken breast. I really appreciate spice and this was perfect for everyone! We left out the corn and black olives for picky eaters but it was still delightful! Highly recommended and I'll be making it again! (:

Very different from the typical spaghetti i make but i really liked this one. The corn gives it a really nice texture. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

My daughter requested a spicy spaghetti, so I found this recipe and made it. I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand and personal preferences. I omitted the red pepper and olives, used jarred jalapenos, and grilled the chicken. We ate plenty and even had leftovers for the next few days.

Delicious and easy. I subbed diced tomatoes with green Chile‚Äôs for the diced tomatoes, used fresh garlic with the chicken, fresh onion instead of powder, omitted the jalape√±os, and I served it over black soy spaghetti. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good. Since this was the first time to try this recipe I followed the recipe. A very nice change to standard spaghetti. Next time I will try 1/4 - 1/2 cup finely chopped onion while cutting onion powder.

Had this recipe for dinner last night; my boyfriend and I loved it, but the kids were a little snobby with it ;)  They have no idea what they were missing!  Very good; we'll definitely cook it again; great spice to it also!

like some other people I was a little weirded out by the corn but decided to give it a try.  The recipe was actually REALLY good and I did like the crunch that the corn gave it.  My husband (who likes nothing) even liked it!
