This is the best recipe for banana pudding!  I bring it everywhere.  I also use more wafers than it calls for in the recipe.  TIP - You can dip your bananas in SPRITE and they won't turn brown.  Works great!

I have been using this recipe for many years now. I work in the Law Enforcement field and everytime we have a get together no matter what it is, even at Christmas the Officers always want me to fix Banana Pudding. They rave about this recipe and to be honest it is better than the old fashioned real recipe on the side of the Nilla Wafer Box. I started using this recipe because the original home made one always was so rich it gave me a stomach ache. They all think this is my secret recipe. Even though I have given them the recipe they say it doesn't taste the same when they make it. I Love the attention and since this has always worked I will continue using it. The only thing I have changed is I use Banana Cream instant pudding instead of Vanilla..

This is a fabulous banana pudding! I've been making this Eagle Brand recipe for about 15 years and it's a family favorite! Whenever I take it somewhere I'm always asked for the recipe! I typically use more wafers than what the recipe calls for because folks like the cake-like way they turn out, and I always crush a few to sprinkle on top - it looks so nice! If you're in a hurry, substituting Cool Whip for the heavy cream works fine. It's great both ways! The BEST banana pudding EVER!

I have never made pudding before so maybe I did something wrong, although I can't figure out what it might be. I followed the recipe to the letter and chilled it overnight and it was still soupy the next evening. I think it would have tasted great if it hadn't come out so watery. Anybody have any ideas as to why this happened???

VERY sweet! Actually,way too sweet. Next time I will sub the Condensed milk for regular milk and use a quarter of the whipping cream suggested. I had to make more regular pudding to add to this recipe, because it was overwhelming.

I prefer this recipe because it uses condensed milk, which my husband loves, and real whipped cream. It's always a hit.

I make this banana pudding year after year and it never fails.  It is the best nana puddin' recipe around.  Try squirting lemon juice on the bananas to keep them from turning brown.  YUM-O!

Pudding came out light and fluffy, I would recommend that you should add vanilla extract to the mix while mixing. It's very good, everyone loved it. Best banana pudding I have ever tasted.

This is the best recipe--EVER!! I've been using this for more than 25 years! After discovering this recipe, I stopped making my Mom's cooked custard--which was super rich! I also use the banana cream flavor Jello pudding in mine too. And i always add more cookies than the recipe calls for, just because we like cookies. I've also made this for one friend who doesn't eat bananas, but loves the pudding with just the cookies. This recipe beats all the rest!!

This is the BEST banana pudding ever!!! I have been making this one for a long time and people just go nuts over it! Sometimes i substitute the nilla wafers for pecan sandies, that turns out really good too. OH, and one pckg of cream cheese also goes into mine. It makes alot more than regular banana pudding, but the more the merrier!!

Oh my gosh !!!!!! This is one of those to die for recipes.  I love it; the older it is the better it tastes.  My Father in law said that it tasted great - and he is a picky old guy from down South.  Can all recipes be my favorite!

This was the best banana pudding I have ever tasted!!! I would usually go to this southern popular restaurant just to eat their banana pudding. Well guess what! I don't have to anymore. This recipe was better than the restaurant. I called one of my girlfriends to tell her how good it was...and she made it the next day and love it.   I used whipping cream and vanilla pudding....  Thanks for this recipe.  ~P.  Godboldo~

THE.BEST.BANANA.PUDDING.EVER!!!! I have been making this recipe for years - I am asked to bring this to every family/friend gathering - it is DELICIOUS and yes, it is RICH but worth the splurge.  I use more bananas and wafers than the recipe specifies, but that is just my personal taste. I have made double this recipe with no issues.  Try this recipe, you won't regret it!!!

Oh my goodness. I never thought banana pudding could be this good but I was missing out! I first was introduced to this recipe by my ex-boyfriend's family and I just couldn't believe that the terrible stuff I was served in grade school shared the same name as this heavenly creation!   Yummy stuff! Every time I make it, everyone raves. Really classic recipe and it can't be improved.

Really delicious! Creamy and satisfying.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out really nice and thick and creamy.  I could see how if could be called too sweet, but I think the key is to not sweeten your whipped cream when making it.  I only used about 1/2 a cup of whipped cream, half because that's all I had, and half because I wanted to do that minute of a thing to decrease the calories...not that I expected this dessert to be low calorie. 

YumYumYUM!

This was a very easy and delicious pudding recipe.  I found it to be a little too rich for my taste, but still very good.  Next time, I willl add more bananas.   Note:  Pudding was better the second day - sitting really enhanced the flavors.

I had this a few years ago at an office gathering and it has been a summer staple ever since.  It is really rich, so if I'm making it for family, I use light whipped topping and sugar free pudding, but people rave about it as is.  It's something that I even get asked to bring sometimes.  A+ summer potluck recipe.

I've already made this twice in the past week - it's that good!  I was skeptical using unsweetened whipped cream, but it balances the sweetened condensed milk perfectly.  The second time I made it I used 4 bananas and forgot to put lemon juice on them - no problems with them turning brown thankfully.  Also I subbed fat free condensed milk the second time and I couldn't even tell the difference.

Served this Easter Sunday and it was a big hit.I used Banana cream pudding in place of  vanilla pudding,make sure you use instant pudding.I dipped the banana slices in Sprite instead of lemon juice,which thought it would change the taste.Also used a 2qt glass bowl and 3 LARGE bananas and the full box of wafers. ENJOY!

I received this recipe from a friend and it is the best banana pudding ever.  For a different taste try using nutter butter cookies broken into small pieces instead of vanilla wafers, delicious!!!

This was my first time making banana pudding and I don't think I want to try another recipe. I followed directions exactly and it got amazing raves from the moment it touched their lips! This is what I will be taking to office parties from now on.

Between the condensed sweetened milk and the real whipped cream, this pudding was far too rich for my liking. The sweetness was almost overwhelming.  Presentation wise, it looked and smelled fantastic, but definitely too sweet for me.

Being asked to hand a favorite family recipe down to the next generation is not only an honor but the greatest of compliments! After 20 years of making Creamy Banana Pudding I've discovered the holidays aren't the same without it. I can't recall the last holiday meal that didn't include it. The texture is so light and creamy it seems to just melt in your mouth. The taste is delectable! If you like banana flavor you will love this! It's delicious! My family races to get the last serving! I've been making this pudding for at least 20 years. In that time I've made a few alterations with only minor changes the original recipe. I always start by chilling the mixing bowls. I prefer to use a metal bowl when whipping the cream. It seems to speed up the process with equal results. I use pineapple juice to preserve the sliced bananas instead of lemon juice. You get the same results and that I believe taste better. It may not even be noticeable. I substitute banana flavored instant pudding mix for the vanilla. We've done a side by side taste test and banana flavor won hands down. DO NOT substitute the EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk! I've used another brand only to find it really does make a difference! One of my favorite gifts of all time is an antique, cut glass, footed serving dish given to me by my best friend. The dish and the dish are a perfect match! Warning: you can not make this just one time! You will make it a family tradition! Vivi

I make this when we get together with special friends. It is so delicious and gets rave reviews. It is sweet, so you don't need much and is definitely for special occasions if you're watching calories. I've renamed this the, 'Oh my goodness, I need a moment creamy banana pudding' in honor of one of my friends that needed just that. A moment. :) 
I'm giving this 10 stars

This was AWESOME!! I had 6 over ripe bananas on hand, so I used them all.  The ONLY tiny tiny issue I might have would be that there was just a little too much whipping cream in it for my taste, but I don't like whipped cream on things usually... more of a personal preference than a suggestion to chance anything. Overall, I thought it was really great, and I would definitely bring this to a picnic or outing with friends. YUM!!

I picked this recipe up in the produce area many years ago and once I made it, it became a favorite.   Always gets rave reviews.  It's one of those lick-the-bowl-clean type of desserts.  Delicious!

This is the easiest banana pudding. Try adding Pepperidge Farms chessmen cookies instead of vanilla wafers.  It will take your banana pudding to a whole new level.

I love this recipe, I have been using it forever!!!!  Every holiday dinner, this is my specialty dessert.  I do use 2 boxes of vanilla wafers and half can of sweetened condensed milk.  I also use 5 or 6 bananas and cool whip instead of whipping cream!!

THANK YOU for posting this recipe! I've been making it for years and years (and have been especially popular at potlucks because of it), but I moved across the country and lost it in the process. I scoured the Internet for a while in search of it, but at first I could only find ones with Cool Whip (this recipe is wonderful in part because of the real whipped cream), or the kinds that require baking and separating eggs and all that nonsense. So I was so relieved to finally find THE best pudding recipe all over again. It really is the best--I've made (and eaten) lots of others, and I keep coming back to this one. Thanks again for putting it up here!

This was good. But I found you must eat it all gone the day you make it. Or slice the banana's right before you serve it. It was ok. I think dipping the banana'a in lemon really throw's off the flavor it's too lemony. We did enjoy it though.

this came out ok, was a little heavier than I wanted. I was trying to go for a more whipped and creamy taste but still turned out good and disappeared by the end of the day.

Only Banana Pudding recipe I will ever use. I use cool whip when I want something sweeter, but whipping cream is great too. I made this for my grandpa and he said this is the best he ever had! Which means a lot coming from him!

Yummy!  Turned out great, I had to substitute Cool Whip for the whip cream, which made it a bit sweet (my fault) but overall it was good.  Will make again, but with the whip cream!

VERY sweet.  If that's your thing, then you'll LOVE it!  If not, I'd suggest omitting the condensed milk and water and just use regular milk instead.

I confess that I used Cool Whip instead of whipped cream which made it too sweet thus this is probably an unfair rating.  I want to try again with unsweetened whipped cream which would probably up my rating.  I loved the texture though.  Very light and creamy.

My husband just LOVES banana pudding! So much that when he was a little kid his step mom would make it for his birthday and special events! Well me not being the best cook, I just grad a box of banana pudding and there you have it, My husband being the man he is, is nice and always says its good. (yeah right) Well this year for his birthday I was determined to find the best banana pudding! I FOUND IT and he didn't even have to tell me that he liked it I knew he did since no one else like it in my house he ate it all lol! So for me its 20 Star recipe!

Perfect 10! I followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change one thing! (I just didn't use any lemon juice, it's not necessary). Perfect, REAL southern "nana puddin'"

The BEST ever banana pudding recipe.  This is a prize winner.  It works for an elegant dessert and as a quick and satisfy sweet.  EVERYBODY raves over, asks for the recipe, and inevitably want more.  If you take it somewhere, make sure you take copies of the recipe!

I am not a banana pudding person (don't like bananas too well), but my new husband is.  So I attempted to make one and found this recipe that so many raved about.  I made this and now I can do no wrong in my husband's eyes. (that's a good thing! LOL)  I tasted it myself and I may even have to start liking it (just the pudding and the cookies anyway!) I only had french vanilla pudding, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was perfect!!!   My husband said not to make this too often, he didn't want to lose his manly figure!  LOL!!

I already had this Eagle Brand recipe and have been making it since the 1980s.  I usually add an extra banana and I don't count out the wafers.  I usually have some wafers left in the box.  It's the best.

This was delicious but SO rich!  I'll try again but maybe cut the whipped cream in half.  The taste was steller, though, and I loved the way the Nilla Wafers (after sitting in the fridge overnight) turned into what tasted like little cakes.  YUM.

Excellent and everybody LOVED it.  Followed recipe to a T except I used Banana Cream instant pudding mix instead of vanilla.  I did need 4 bananas instead of 3 and used more than 36 wafers.

This is an awesome recipe that never fails. Everyone LOVES this. 

I used imitation whipped topping instead of whipped cream and I use way more cookies than the recipe calls for.

I also use skim milk instead of water. Water just seems weird to me, but its probably fine. Either way, this recipe is a real crowd pleaser and its super easy to make!

I first discovered this recipe almost 17 years ago and I've made it countless times since. Every time I make it it always gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe. It has become a favorite in my house and at the request of my family I make it for every get together. 

I do mine a little differently as I layer it in a large bowl rather than serving in individual cups. 

This is quick and easy to make and is always a hit.

This is the best banana pudding. I've had the recipe for years from my Great American cookbook where Eaglebrand put their recipe in. People always love it. It's so creamy. My sister and I both made banana pudding once and she made Paula Deen's recipe (which I personally think is so thick) and mine went pretty quick. I just think it's better when creamy the way this recipe is.

My family said this was the best banana pudding ever.  The only thing I changed was the 1 1/2 cups of water - I reduced it to 3/4 cups because it seemed too much.  It made the pudding more like a custard but it was still good.  I will make this again and I will follow the recipe to the letter.

It's gorgeous in a trifle bowl and I am frustrated that I have not taken any pictures of this spectacular-looking dessert.  My hubby is annoyed that today the pastor asked 'Who made the banana pudding?' (his favorite dessert)  then added, 'If you want any, you'd better hurry because it's absolutely the best banana pudding I ever had!'  So there were no leftovers to bring home and it only gets better for days! Make sure you make it the day before and use ripe bananas.  (I also use milk in place of the water called for.)

We loved this banana pudding! The only thing I did differently, was I accidently bought the bigger box of pudding, so I adjusted the water by 1/4 cup. I also took the advise of another reviewer, who said you can dip your bananas in sprite and I did. This was the VERY BEST banana pudding I've ever made. It stayed together, did not get watery nor did the bananas turn brown. Next time, I will add more bananas and still use the bigger box of pudding.

Awesome, decadent, creamy banana pudding!!

To the reviewer who said hers was too "soupy" - did you follow the five-minute chilling step for the pudding?  

The instructions say to mix the pudding mix, condensed sweetened milk, and water - and then to chill the mixture in the fridge for five minutes before proceeding.  This is a critical step!  When I make this pudding, the initial mixture is soupy (even after I beat it with a hand mixer for 2 minutes) - but by the time it comes out of the fridge 5 minutes later, it is much thicker.  That five-minutes of chilling time really does make a difference.  And when I subsequently fold in the whipped cream (which I prepare as the pudding mixture is chilling in the fridge), the pudding becomes even thicker.

I follow this recipe to a "T" and it turns out great every time.  

It's pretty heavy (calorie and fat-gram wise) but so, so delicious and decadent - perfect for a once-in-while special family dessert.

I am used to the old southern way of making this over the stove and stirring so much that your hand is cramped and cooling the pudding for hours so you don't cook the bananas lol. This recipe tastes great and is soooo easy to make however the old fashioned pudding tastes just a little richer.  I gave 4 stars as this will be my go to recipe for quick and easy but I prefer the old stove top, eagle brand, home made banana pudding.....something about that one that doesn't compare.

Excellent and elegant.  Much more subtle than other condensed milk or pudding banana pudding recipes.  Felt it could have used another banana and will add one next time.  Because of cholesterol issues, used cool whip in place of whipped cream but, even so, wonderful flavor.  Thanks for sharing

I've made banana pudding with the pudding mix before but not with condensed milk and I used cool whip instead. WELL WELL WELL I will be using this recipe from now on. It's absolutely DELICIOUS. Oh and I added a touch of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla.

I wanted to make something different for Easter dessert this year and remembered this being a childhood favorite.  I have tried several banana pudding dishes, some that I've made, and some that others have made.  This is bar none, the best by far!  You wouldn't think, based on such a simple ingredient list, that this recipe would offer something different, but it did!  It was perfect, and incredibly creamy.  My dinner guests polished off every bit of it, some even having thirds!  The ONLY thing I changed was garnishing the top with a few sprinkles of cinnamon.  The cinnamon doesn't really flavor anything but it does really compliment the creaminess.  Nutmeg would probably do something similar.  It also makes it look fancier.  Having followed the recipe exactly (minus the cinnamon garnish), I would probably add more bananas next time.  They only sparsely covered each of the three layers.  I did follow one of the other reviewer's tips in dipping the bananas in Sprite to keep them from browning. Worked great!

This recipe is  d e l i c i o u s !!  It's very creamy, velvety smooth, and you simply cannot resist having a second helping.  Just before serving, I added a few crumbled vanilla wafers and then topped with a dusting of cinnamon sugar.  Remember to beat (and beat) the whipping cream until it's stiff.

I made this a dessert for a dinner for an entire Men's College soccer team! I am sure everyone can imagine how much hungry college athletes will eat. I made it in the morning, and it was the perfect amount of time for two huge pans to set. It was really easy and inexpensive, even given that I was quadrupling the recipe. This dessert disappeared! They loved it and gave it rave reviews. Thanks for the great recipe!

What a GREAT recipe! I made this last night and it was so easy and turned out great...per a previous review I substituted the vanilla pudding for the banana cream and it gave it a good banana flavor. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this banana pudding yesterday for my family.  Everyone loved it. I think it was a bit too sweet so the next time I will use regular milk instead of the sweetened condensed milk and see what the difference would be. Overall it was really good other than the sweetness!  Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again!

Very easy and tasty.  Nice alternative to baked banana pudding.  Just a note, add sugar a tablespoon at a time to the whipping cream as needed to thicken.

I made this before, and would recommend either using 2 small packets of instant vanilla pudding or 1 large packet. I would also recommend using a 12 oz. container of frozen whipped topping (thawed) for stability purposes only. 

For those who had trouble with a runny pudding, make sure you are buying INSTANT, not cook and serve pudding. Also, if you're making your own whipped dream, DO NOT use whipping cream. Use heavy cream (or double cream depending on the store/country you're in). For those complaining about the lemon juice, try pineapple or orange juice instead. Best of luck!

Great recipe!! But I do mix it up a bit -  I use Pepperidge Farms Chessman cookies on the bottom & edges of pan and in the middle between layers. I add bananas on top of the cookies. I also use banana cream pudding. Not sure what the lemon juice is for (maybe to keep bananas from getting brown) but I don’t use it either. This always gets rave reviews!! Definitely a keeper!!

this is an old great recipe that I made many years ago then forgot.  I'm glad it  showed back up in a pin.  I made it the other night and the nice memories of how good it tasted came back.  Instant pudding, to me, has a lingering nasty after taste, but that disappears in this recipe.

What a disaster this recipe was!!  I followed the directions to a tee, but the pudding mixture never set after chilling it much longer than the five minutes.  It was a watery mess!!  I had to send my  hubby on an emergency milk run and made it with cold milk, then proceeded to add the whipped cream and it turned out fairly good.  No more eagle brand recipes for this cook!!  Very disappointed to say the least.

This recipe has been a family tradition in my home for the past 15 years during Easter, Thanksgiving, or Christmas holidays.  My kids grew up with this recipe and now make it for their children. It's like banana pudding with a kick! WARNING!!! Make sure you whip the whipping cream until it is creamy before you fold it into your recipe - or you'll have a  SOGGY mess.

Followed advice of others and did half milk, half Eagle brand rather than all Eagle brand.  Also, made sure water and milk were very cold and put metal bowl in freezer for a few minutes before mixing in order to help it thicken up when mixing.  Used cool whip.

I've tried this recipe for the third time and finally got it right!!! Like another reviewer, mine was turning out soupy. Although it was soupy, my husband and kids ate it because it was still good. Since it was good, I kept trying it using different methods of the same ingredients or different versions of the same ingredients, but I kept getting the same results. The lightbulb finally came on while watching a Jello pudding commercial. It dawned on me that I had been purchasing cook and serve pudding mix instead of instant pudding mix. LOL!!! So to the other reviewer with the soupy issue, check your pudding mix. As stated in the ingredients, use instant pudding mix. (Grocery stores should stock the instant mix on the top shelf and the cook-n-serve mix on the bottom shelf. Don't they know, we need stuff quick now. Lol.) This banana pudding is perfect as is!!! The only thing I did differently was to use a whole lot more cookies. I like to use a big bag of Jackson's vanilla wafers. I crumble the last few cookies across the top when I'm done. I like this recipe much better than my mom's totally homemade pudding because it's not as rich, is quicker to make, and has LESS calories.

I love this recipe...I put my own spin on it by using lemon extract instead of lemon juice but either is fine. I also added a little vanilla extract as well, I use 2% milk instead of water (still used the sweetened condensed milk also)...and finally I added cream cheese and chessmen cookies instead of all wafers(I put vanilla wafers at the bottom of the pan and the chessmen cookies throughout the pudding)..Got great feedback everyone loved it

This pudding is VERY sweet and way too rich for my taste. I read all the reviews before making the pudding and thus reduced 15% of the sweetened condensed milk called for the recipe, but the result is still far too sweet for me. I will probably use only half of the sweetened condensed milk and substitute regular milk for the other half next time. Also, make sure to use well-riped bananas, 'cause the bananas I used weren't ripe enough so their texture is firm and didn't provide any banana aroma.

This is so good! I use it all the time. I normally use cool whip in place of whipping cream and add extra cookies. This recipe is so easy and quick to make my husband asks me to make it all the time.

This is delicious! I only put cookies on the very top, otherwise I feel like they can overwhelm the pudding. Super easy to make, and very fast!

I have been using this recipe for over 15 years.......it's always a big hit.  I now use low fat Nilla Wafers, fat free sweet condensed milk, and fat free sugar free instant vanilla pudding. Trust me, you can't tell the difference. I usually don't tell people until it's all gone at a function and they can't tell the difference from the original recipe. So if you want the same great taste without the calories then try it this way. It's great and you won't be sorry.   This is definitely a favorite wherever I take it.

We took it to a dinner party last night hosted by the parents of my teenage daughter. The teens loved it. I received so many compliments. I used banana cream pudding mix. I had to make it again today for my dear hubby, and this time I used vanilla pudding.  I like the vanilla better. I put mine in a bowl and topped with vanilla wafers. On both occasions, I used milk instead of water and added a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. Also this holds up if made the day before and tastes better. It does not get mushy like the recipes that have the custard that you make in the double boiler.

I have made this for over 24 years.  It never fails and everyone always loves it.  I have in a pinch substituted cool whip for the heavy whipping cream.   I always use more bananas and cookies.
