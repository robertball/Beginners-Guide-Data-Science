This was very good, although I did alter the recipe a bit to make it healthier. I used 3 cups skim milk and 2 cups of chicken broth, then added my potatoes, corn (a mixture of sweet corn and regular corn), and spices. I sauteed the onion with cut up chicken breasts, then added that to the soup. I also added several dashes of thyme, oregano, and onion powder. If you let this soup simmer for about an hour, the potatoes become mealy and thicken the soup tremendously without having to use heavy cream as the thickener. I felt that it needed quite a bit of pepper, which was nicely offset by the sweet corn. My whole family enjoyed this chowder and I'll gladly make it again.

I added mashed potato flakes to thicken it up a bit and used fat free half & half. Canned corn also works just as well.

I modified this recipe as others have suggested (thanks!). I sauteed the onion and shallots in butter in a soup pot, then added four chicken breasts with all fat removed, a 32 oz box of chicken broth, additional water to cover chicken (about 2 cups), and boiled until the chicken was cooked and tender. Then I shredded the chicken with two forks right in the pot. I added 2% milk to reach the desired consistency, and also added thyme, onion powder, scant cayenne pepper, and a dash or oregano; I upped the potatoes to 4, and simmered for 45 mins. to let soup thicken and flavors meld. We served the soup with finely shredded 2% milk cheddar on top. Not a true chowder but quite delicious, and definitely not a bad bet calorie-wise!

Really great way to use leftover rotisserie chicken from the grocery...I added bacon by browning two slices in a pan and then used the grease to sautee my onion.  I chopped the bacon and added it in with the potatoes, corn etc....delicious! The slight hint of smokiness from it really added depth to the recipe.

This was a really tasty chowder!  Even my daughter who is not a corn eater liked it very much!  It was so yummy and it fed us (3) for days when it was coooold...excellent and easy.

husband liked it a lot(after eating cambell's version all these years) the ingriedients were easy to come buy(used up all that corn in the freezer!) and i cooked 3 huge chicken legs in the crock pot filled with water all day and used the broth from that.  Kept everything else the same, turned out great!  Husband liked it better when it thickened up the second day though.

What a great recipe. This is a hearty chowder is full of fresh vegtables. Is a light bodied chowder. Will make this as a standard meal in cold months to come. A very healthy choice!

Love this soup!  While my potatoes are cooking I sometimes add the rind of a parmesan for extra flavor.  Oncce I realized I didn't have heavy cream and it was just as tasty with skim milk and a cup of instant potatoes to thicken it.  This is also a great way to use leftover rotisserie or baked chicken.

This chowder is wonderful! I took the advice of some previous reviewers and changed a few things. I cooked onions, garlic, and carrots (didn't use the shallots) in olive oil. I used two pounds of chicken breast and boiled them in 32 oz of chicken broth and I added in the onion/carrot mixture once the broth was boiling. Once the chicken was cooked I shredded it and added in the potatoes and corn. I used four potatoes and a bag of corn. It cooked closer to 30 minutes, and I continued to add chicken broth while it cooked since the broth seemed to be soaking into the chicken and vegies. I also used more cream than called for-but it made it that much tastier! Look forward to making this again!

This was fantastic. Need to thicken in a hurry? Cut up one of the potatoes very small and add to onion butter mixture with a half cup of water. When potato chunks are soft, mash them up into a paste and add 1 T of flour. Mix well and then slowly add 2 c of milk and simmer. This will thicken nicely. Then add other ingredients as indicated. Also, I used milk instead of cream (skim is fine) and roasted chicken breasts cut up. Throw the bay leaf in the whole mixture. Add more milk as needed to desired thickness. EXCELLENT!

I made this for my family and they were going back for seconds, the only thing I did differently was add a little garlic powder. I can't help myself when it comes to garlic.

I liked this soup although it was a little bland.  Next time I think I will add some additional spices to it and some carrots.

This was excellent! I left out the shallots, because the onion was so strong, I was afraid to add anything more along that line, and that turned out to be a good decision. I used about 3 tablespoons of dehydrated potato flakes to thicken the chowder a little (which I keep on hand for this very purpose), because I thought it was a bit too thin. I threw in a couple of whole garlic cloves with the chicken, and added a tiny bit of celery salt to the soup at the end. Easy, tasty comfort food!

I absolutely loved this. I used chicken breasts instead of a carcass, boiled in broth and water for 2 hours. I also added some sliced carrot for color. Very easy to make. Great fall dish, thanks for posting this!

My husband loves chicken corn chowder so I made this for him. I had to add chicken broth and cook it down as there was way too much stock. Also I added a whole bag of corn and 2 chicken breasts instead of using meat from the carcass. We topped it with bacon and shredded cheese and crumbled up some Jiffy cornbread on the top...everybody went back for seconds. Great recipe if you take your time with it.

This was a good bowl of chowder!  Like everyone, we made a few changes: added 1-cup of sliced carrots, 1-cup of diced celery, I was onion-crying too much to cut a shallot. The chicken (one pound, tenderloins) were cooked with a healthy coating (on each side) from McCormick’s Garlic Pepper Seasoning Grinder.  We used two large baking potatoes and a bag of Steamfresh Southwestern Corn (which has light seasoning)—covered it all in (light) chicken broth then added a pound bag of steamed then pureed cauliflower.  Liberally used salt and pepper…my boyfriend claimed all the leftovers (but I did get a small bowl for lunch--which received four compliments for smelling amazing)!

Excellent soup!  I added more cream as the amount in the recipe didn't make it creamy enough.  Great flavour though.

Loved it. Easy and quick to make. Added about 1 tsp of thyme, oregano and onion powder each, additional 1/2 cup corn and two more tablespoons of heavy cream. Mmmmmm my husband and I lapped it up enthusiastically.

I have altered this recipe because I don't use bouillon due to the chemicals.  I have made the chowder with the whole chicken as described and with cut up chicken breasts and organic boxed chicken broth.  If I don't have cream, I just use enough milk to whiten.  My biggest improvement on the recipe is to use fresh corn cut off the cob.  You will not believe the difference!  No matter how I make chicken corn chowder, this recipe is a great starting place and my family always loves it.

Very tasty!  I'm trying to cut calories, so I used fat free sour cream and some low fat milk instead of the cream, and it was still delicious.  I also refrigerated the broth after cooking so that it was easier to skim more of the fat from the top and then strained it a second time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions of the recipe exactly, but found the recipe did not mention how big the chicken should be.  My chicken was average but a lot of water was so the need which makes more broth then you need more vegetables and more half and half.  I did not like this recipe very much

We used left over fried chicken (skin removed and shredded), 2-10.5 oz cans of Campbells chicken broth, 2 soup cans filled with skim milk, 1 onion diced, 1 bay leaf, 2T parsley, 12 oz bag frozen corn, 1tsp chicken bouillon, 6 small red potatoes diced, 1tsp garlic powder and salt and pepper on the table.  We mashed some of the potatoes to thicken.  Made this way is lower in fat and a healthy alternative and it also tastes great.  Next time, we might add carrots.

This was great, I followed the the recipe as well as I could, but used items on hand. I made a gigantic stock pot full of this chowder. I used green peppers instead of shallots (as I had none). I added a cup or two of potato flakes and 2 cups of skim milk instead of cream. Tossed in some extra corn and potatoes, as I made a huge pot. I also added two cans of chicken stock to fill the pot to the top.  It turned out great!

Loved it!!!! All of us gave it rave reviews! Mashed up some of the potato and added back to thicken. Didn't have chicken carcass so boiled some breast.

I found this recipe confusing as the method does not give instructions on how much broth to use - so the ratio of 2 tbsp of heavy cream may be skewed depending on how much broth is used.  This is probably why my soup came out very thin - not at all chowder-like.

I didn't have a chicken carcass on hand so, like another reviewer, I boiled 3 large chicken breasts in 32 oz of chicken broth (plus 1 cup water).  After the chicken was done, I took out the chicken and strained the broth into a separate bowl.  Then I sauteed 1/2 an onion with 3 minced garlic cloves.  After the onions turned translucent, I added the chicken, broth and other ingredients into the pot.  While the soup was simmering, I added 1 tablespoon of parsley, 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme and a dash of cayenne pepper.  To thicken the soup without adding extra calories, I blended some of the broth, corn and tender potatoes together.  This thickened the soup to a more traditional chowder consistency and added a wonderful color.  Taste the soup when finished -- you may feel that a little salt is needed.  Adding about 1/2 teaspoon of Lawry's seasoning took the soup from bland to tasty!

This looks great.  I'm going to really modify it b/c I'm craving it NOW and don't have all the stuff.  We'll see how it turns out.  I'm going to use canned skillet corn, frozen chix breasts, sweet potatoes, and adding some green beans to the broth.  I'll puree the veggies so they'll "hide" from my three year old twins.  :)  Wish I had carrots but they'd make the soup turn orange.  Looking forward to trying it.        WEll, I just tried it.  MY version which is so unlike yours was not good.  I'm only posting so people will STICK to the versions prior to mine :)  I WISH I'd stuck to your attractive and tasty recipe.  Canned corn and frozen green beans...yuck!!!!  NOT in this soup.  Learn from my mistakes.  I'm rating high so the recipe itself doesn't get a bad rating.

I used a leftover rotiserie chicken and added mushrooms.  To compensate for the lesser amount of chicken I made a 4 serving version and heavily reduced the chicken broth to concentrate the flavor.  My biggest fan when I hit and biggest critic when I miss is my wife, and as she so eloquently put it when she tried the first spoonfull: "Wow..."

Wow, this was seriously yummy. I didn't make enough of it! I only used three little potatoes (as I am trying to not use too much food in one go) and I think I only put a cup full of frozen corn in because that's all I had... I also omitted the shallots because I didn't have any, but everything else went in! The taste was to die for! I added a little bit of instant mashed potato like someone else mentioned to thicken it slightly. My boyfriend and daughter gave it a 10!   I considered adding diced carrot but I wasnt sure what it would turn out like, so I will do that next time.   For those who say that they didn't know how much water/stock to put in, I almost covered the chicken carcass, then I added more stock until the pan was half full. Should have added more then it would have lasted longer! Oh well.....!  I didn't use cream, just skim milk and that instant potato like someone else recommended.

I used one large sweet potato, because I didn't have any other potatoes, and it turned out great.  Slightly sweet and very yummy.  I also used half and half thickened with flour to save a few calories.

I omitted the shallots and added more bouillon.  Turned out perfect. My Husband took a big container to work the next day and shared it with some friends, they all loved it also.  Great recipe and a hearty filling soup. Thanks for the recipe.

GREAT flavor.  I was really discouraged at how thin mine turned out though.  There was no instructions on how much broth to use.  So... I took some of the broth, dissolved a bunch of flour and added it to the soup.  Plus I doubled the cream.  Good... but not as thick as chowder should be.  BUT the flavor was so good I'm still rating it a 4.

This recipe is an 8-10. Some small changes could make this a 9-10. Most comments reflect changes. Sadly, most comments are from fairly ignorant folk that have yet tasted the recipe and still Judge/condemn it from their own conversion. For those that speak it, bless their hearts!

Recipe was a great starting place. I used 3 chicken breasts baked instead of carcass .  Corn off 2 ears that I had. 1 hot pepper. Chicken broth and some 'better than boulion chicken flavoring. Added a little Parmesan cheese and whole milk at the end. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I thought it was very tasty.

It's great! I added a little more cream and corn and one tablespoon of flour. And because my boyfriend is mexican, we spiced it up a bit with chile de arbol. Next time I'll add 2.5 cups of corn and 1.5 potatoes. I bet then it will be 5 stars!!!

The flavor was not as full as I like. The corn as whole kernel is fine. Creamed corn is used in basic corn chowder per old northeast recipes for bolder taste. Salt pork chopped up pieces cooked in pan chowder is made and onions added into during frying adds bolder flavor. The chowder was not as creamy as northeastern chowder but fine. As with everything it is to individual taste and eating style.

This is a pretty good basic recipe but I felt it was a little too vague.  Like a lot of others I wasn't sure about how much water to use so I ended up with too much and a thin soup.  So I added some dried potatoes and also some corn starch dissolved in water, and added more cream than the recipe called for.  I skipped the bouillon because my broth was tasty without it but added extra black pepper and some seasoned salt.  After the modifications it was reallllly good.
