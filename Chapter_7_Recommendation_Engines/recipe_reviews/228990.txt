Sorry, but I must have missed something in this recipe. I found the 1 T cinnamon extremely overpowering. I also could not fit it into a 1-1/2 qt casserole. Did not care for this recipe. Couldn't even taste the peaches or hardly find them in the pudding.

Looks real good for winter time. I'll try it.
As a lactose tolerate I'll use soy milk and soy cream.
I am sure it will work.

We loved this.  I used spiced rum and our own home canned peaches and it was a big hit with all my eaters.  Who doesn't love peaches? And cream?
