The overall presentation was rather visually appealing.  I thought that the taste and texture were the highlights of this dish.  The softness of the pair and the contrast between the fruit's flavor and the cinnamon was fantastic.  It was moist and sweet.  I would definitely prepare this recipe for my guests and family.

A delicious things to do to pears, and without the aftertaste that announces to your guests that you've skimped on the sugar. This is a good dessert.
