I made this with my husband,  especially the dough (whole wheat and yogurt), and as an avid meat lover, I was amazed how delicious this turned out. I criticized the lack of tomatoes, mozzarella or meat, but this was a really easy make, and now a keeper. I recommend this recipe to anyone. For a healthier pizza, use a less fat/calorie tomato sauce.

My entire family (including 2 picky teenagers) loved this recipe. However, I did tweek it slightly. 

I added ground turkey meat with a very small portion of pork sausage to a hunt's garlic sauce then added a small amount of cottage cheese as a layer (in place of the normal ricotta cheese). I also added fresh basil on top.
