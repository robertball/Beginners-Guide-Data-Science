Very delicious!  I'm sure it's even better with the lime leaves, which I didn't have, but even without it was very good, and it's quite easy to prepare.

I added undon noodles.  This is good but does not even hold a candle to "Adrienne's Tom Ka Gai" from this site.  The other recipe knocks you socks off ---awsome.  This one is just okay---AND I had a hard time finding straw mushroom,  look in the canned goods section.

I love this recipe.  It's simple but delicious.  I used canned straw mushrooms, too.  I've never seen them fresh even in well-stocked Asian markets here in Canada.  Do try this recipe!!

This was a fantastic recipe! My boyfriend absolutely loved it, and it had so much flavor and was so easy to make, I would definitely recommend it! Canned straw mushrooms seemed to work fine for me, too.

Don't hesitate to make this recipe if you cannot find kaffir lime leaves in your grocery store.  I made it without, and the soup was still absolutely amazing! I added some chinese noodles and used water and miso instead of chicken broth, and it was a perfect.  I will definitely make this again.

I have never been a big fan of hot and sour soups but this is awesome! My mother loves hot and sour soup and always gets it when she dines out. I made this recipe for her one weekend and she begged for the recipe.   This is also our new go to soup when we have a chest cold.  It works wonders.   I can not praise it enough.   I saw the earlier comment about Adriennes Tom Ka ga soup.   That's also a great recipe.  Different type of soup and taste pallete though.  It's like comparing apples and chocolate.

Good recipe, I tried it as it was presented. Good! I make this dish too, I use half the lime leaves, be cautious with the lime juice. Straw mushrooms are canned I dont like the slimy texture so I use fresh button mushrooms sliced. I also dont use chicken broth, I use only the stock left from the prawn shells try it. Either way a good dish serve with rice on the side!

I was very happy to see that this recipe made use of the shrimp shells.  The only change I made was to chop up one whole red Thai chile pepper (with seeds) and add it at the same time as the lemon grass.  It had the perfect amount of heat.  The reason for only 3 stars is that it was so salty, it was really inedible.  There are only two possible sources of salt - the chicken stock and the fish sauce.  I use the same low-salt chicken stock so it had to be the fish sauce.  I would reduce it by half - although this may affect the "sour" part of the hot-and-sour.  My other option is to try a different brand of fish sauce.  I used "Roland" brand.

I had trouble finding some of the ingredients for this soup. I used lemongrass paste instead of fresh lemongrass, and used lime zest in place of the kaffir lime leaves. I also couldn't find straw mushrooms, but I usually don't care for mushrooms anyways, so I just choose to omit them. Even without using the precise ingredients, this turned out to have a wonderful flavor. I really enjoyed this, so I wouldn't let the lack of fresh ingredients available stop you from giving this a try.

Lovely .. thanks for the recipe ... Made a double batch.    I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce, large package of ramon noodles & tons of mushrooms I cooked off first with chinese spicy oil.  Shrimp added to each bowl at the end.  Made it early so hot peppers where put in hole while I let it steep for a few hours on low.  Family loved it.
