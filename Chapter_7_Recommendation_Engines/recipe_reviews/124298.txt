Everything about this recipe is simply perfect. I prepared them exactly as written, and even after doing so I believe that not only are no changes necessary, I would not recommend them. First, they are picture perfect, bakery style muffins--so pretty and plump. They are perfectly sweet and not overspiced, which allows the fresh banana flavor to shine. They are moist, with a delicate, cakey crumb, not too dense as some banana muffins/breads can be. I wouldn't exactly call the topping streusel, as it isn't as crumbly as that-it has more of a crackly crunch-maybe even better than streusel! I have baked for a great many people in my life, and I would not hesitate to serve these anywhere or to anyone.  Great recipe!

Very good.  I doubled it to save time and feed the army of company that we had over.  I baked it in a 10" tube pan for 50-60 minutes.  I added a little more sugar and flour to the streusel to make it more crumbly.  Tip:  You can freeze bananas that are starting to turn brown.  The skins will turn dark brown in the freezer - that's ok.  When you want to make a recipe that calls for bananas, simply thaw what you need.  The thawed bananas will slip out of their skins - they don't look great but will taste fine in any recipe.

These are excellent muffins. They are light and fluffy... they freeze very well. They have almost a lemony essence to them and not an overwhelming fake banana taste. Amazing. Everyone should make these!

And see the pictures too... I added mine!

Great recipe, left out the cinnamon as we are not big fans, but still were great.  I doubled the recipe as I had 4 bananas tht needed to be used, and therefore ran a little short on the sour cream (I used light) so I just added a little more milk, and they still turned out.  Will make again.  Thanks so much.  A doubled recipe yielded 28 muffins.

Very Yummy. A great way to use those over-ripe bananas lying around. I made them mini muffin sized. I would suggest making a little more of the topping just because I think that's the best part. Yum!

Nice, light banana muffins.  I would use brown sugar in the streusel for more flavor as well as some color.

I tried another popular banana streusel recipe today and honestly, I liked this one better. I used half whole wheat flour, added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and a little vanilla. I had to work with what I had on hand, so I used half sour cream and half cream cheese. I know it's not by the recipe, but I'm trying to keep with what I have on hand. It was a great addition. This streusel worked a lot better than using brown sugar. Since I had issues with baking the other recipe at 375, I baked mine at 350 until the toothpick inserted came out clean. Worked great! EDITED: I made a second batch right after this and added two tablespoons of orange juice concentrate and just sprinkled sugar on top. Even better! EDITED AGAIN: My kids ate half a batch of these in one day on their own. They raved about these. I am SO making these again. Plus, they freeze well.

Wonderful!  I made this into a loaf of bread and doubled the topping.  Yummy!  I also added 1 1/2 tsp banana flavoring and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the batter before pouring it into the pan. I doubled the amount of cinnamon in the struesel and also used some apple pie seasoning in bread since it added some other flavors.  This is so good warm!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. I used brown sugar and doubled the cinnamon for the streusel topping. For the muffins I used 1 tsp. of cinnamon. The texture of these muffins is perfect, the flavor wonderful and they look fantastic with their overflowing muffin tops. I was worried the muffin cups were too full, but they came out beautiful.

Very good muffin.  My recipe made 12 regular size muffins and 20 mini muffins.  Didn't make the streusel topping - just sprinkled with cinnamon & sugar mixture. Only baked the minis for about 13 minutes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is a keeper. Muffins have a sweet, crunchy top and are very moist and flavorful. I normally make banana cake with my ripe bananas, but am very happy I tried this recipe. The next time I make this I will double the recipe and freeze half for later. Thanks Robin for submitting this great recipe!

These muffins are so moist and the streusel topping is perfect.  I did double the topping at my husband's request because the last time I made these there didn't seem to be enough on top.  Quick and easy to prepare...will definitely go into my "favorites" hand-me-down recipe book.

Excellent recipe.  Banana bread can sometimes bore me, but everyone loved this recipe.  I substitute applesauce or yogurt whenever i can for the oil.  They came out great!

These muffins are great and easy to make. I made them for Fathers Day and they are delicious! I definatly will make these muffins again! Tip: Add some brown sugar to the streusel for extra flavoring. I also skipped the sour cream and it tasted fine!

Very nice cake-like texture, and looked pretty, but WAY too sweet for my taste. I even cut down the sugar and used all whole wheat flour. Adding some oats to the crumble made a very attractive topping.

This is the perfect recipe. I've been searching for a long, long time and am thrilled to finally have found this. I used 3 bananas and 1/2 c. of plain yogurt since I only had 1/2 c. of sour cream. Next time I will also add some chopped walnuts.

This is a terrific recipe.  I didn't have quite a full cup of sour cream so I filled in with plain fat free yogurt and they still baked up moist, fluffy and delicious.  My only disappointment was the topping gets soggy by the next day - but still tastes great.  Thanks, Robin I will surely make these again.

Yummy! It was a hit at our brunch potluck!. Rather than plain granola, I added a granola mix with dried cranberries....sweet, tart, and had a crunch. Will be making again. Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins turned out doughy for me, the taste was ok but the texture was wrong. The only thing i substituted was splenda brown sugar mix for regular sugar which i do in all my baking without any problems. The topping was very nice.
Mind you i did switch my usual all purpose flour for a cheaper brand. I don't think it would make that much of a difference.
I don't think i will try this recipe again.

I like banana bread/muffin recipes with sour cream in them.  The breads come out slightly tangy and cake-like.  Love them.  I played with these ones and used white whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar a little, and omitted the topping.  For fun, I added chopped pecans, sweetened coconut, a splash of vanilla and a few handfulls of chocolate chips to them.  Really good!  I think you can add what you like.  They aren't very "banana-y" so I wanted to take them up a notch.

Simple to make but look and taste like you spent hours on them!  I love recipes that use what is commonly on-hand in the kitchen.  I used 1/2 wheat flour and skipped the streusel topping and the muffins still turned out beautifully.  A must try.

Great recipe!  This particular recipe gave me 12 FULL muffin cups!  Adding the streusel made it look messy before baking, but once baked, they look great.  No overflowing at all.  I did check them at 20 minutes, but baked them at 30 minutes.  
This recipe is a great alternative to the "Cream Cheese Banana Nut Bread" recipe that has appeared on other web sites.  The main, and important reason, this is a great alternative is that the recipe uses sour cream instead of cream cheese.  For those on a budget and watching their money, where I am located cream cheese has doubled in price, while sour cream has not.

I was easily able to make these dairy-free by using Earth Balance baking sticks in place of butter and Tofutti sour cream.  My dairy-loving husband and sons ate more of these than I did!  Definitely making a double batch next time!

Very moist, and the sour cream really lends a unique and delicious flavor. One adjustment I will add next time is to at least double the cinnamon and add some nutmeg and ginger. THey could use quite a bit more seasoning.

These muffins were really good.  I had one banana, so I used the ingredients for 6 servings.  I used whole wheat pastry flour for both the muffins and the streusel (you can find it in bulk at health food stores), and  I substituted  plain yogurt for the sour cream, and sunflower oil for the melted butter.  I got 10 regular-sized muffins that were perfect!  Thanks for sharing~~

Easy and excellent, I made as written but changed out 1/2 cup flour for 1/2 cup wheat germ for better nutrition. Muffins were light and had a lovely banana taste. I did use 3 banana's as that is what I had that needed to be used. Grandson loved them and ate 3.

These turned out delicious and moist.  I added a tsp of vanilla extract and used vegetable oil instead of butter for the muffins.  I cooked them for 20 mins on 350.  i have an electric stove, so I'm not sure if that matters, but they turned out moist and the top was crunchy.  They would be even better with banana extract added.

Really good banana muffins recipe...moist and sweet.  The banana flavor really comes through and the topping is a nice compliment.  I added extra cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg for additional flavor.

It actually surprised me how much I liked these, because normally I don't care for banana flavored anything. My little boy loved them! The only problem that I had was that the topping wasn't very crumbly, therefore hard to "sprinkle". Other than that, great recipe!

I loved this recipe! I used a bunt pan because I did not have a muffin tin handy. Lol. And it turned out just fine. Another substitution I did was a 1/2 cup sour cream, and a 1/2 cup apple sauce. It was not to banana-ish. Which I loved! Super nums! Will for sure make this again (muffin style). (:

I followed the recipe except for the cinnamon in the batter, instead I used 1 1/4 teaspoons of vanilla. So you have a vanilla banana cake, did use the cinnamon in the strussle though. The recipe was delicious!!!!!!

I had some bananas and light sour cream that needed to be used up and when I came across this recipe I thought I would give it a try. Overall these are good, if you are looking for a sweet banana treat you might be slightly disappointed. Not much banana flavor- I think the sour cream diminishes the banana taste. If you bored with traditional banana muffins give these a try.

These muffins are delicious as they are but to cut down on calories I substitued plain yogurt for the sour cream and applesauce for the melted butter.  Surprising that you can't tell the difference.

This was an amazing banana muffin recipe.  Moist and flavorful.  I doubled the recipe and made one dozen jumbo muffins.  I had enough batter left over to make muffin tops.  Wouldn't change a thing Thank you for sharing this recipe.

EXCELLENT!!! These muffins are everything a banana muffin should be! They are very moist & lightly sweet with just enough of the banana flavor. And the Streusel topping makes the muffin!!! The only thing I did different was I substituted 1c of whole wheat flour for 1c of white & added 1tsp Vanilla to the wet ingredients! And my 2 year old daughter loved them! I will make these again and again! Great recipe!

I like to healithfy (is that a word?) things so I made these with 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I also substituted plain greek yoghurt for the sour cream.  I made mini muffins to take to a picnic and everyone loved them.  They didn't even know they were eating something healthy. :)

Excellant recipe.  Good flavours and light fluffy texture.   I used 3 bananas as I needed to use them up.  I was not able to sprinkle my streusel as it was the wrong texture, maybe my tablesppons of butter were too big, or the butter was too soft?  The taste of the streusel was great though and we loved the crunchy top it gave to the muffin. My search for a banana muffin recipe is now over. This the winner :)

I did not have high expectations when trying the recipe.  Loved them!  I did mix my streusel mixture a little to long and it was mushy but thats my fault.  Will definitely make again.

Very good muffins. I used 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4c white in the batter, and kept the original amount in the topping. Doubled the cinnamon. I used a jumbo sized muffin tin, so I got six large muffins with the batter. Baked for exactly 20 min.

While these did bake up nicely, and were moist enough (though so is my regular recipe that doesn't use sour cream), I found that they weren't really spectacular in flavor.  Sort of bland. There was far too much "streusel" too. I won't make them again, sorry.

Pretty good recipe. My muffins came out a little dry and less "banana-ey" than I would like (even with five large bananas for a double batch). I would up the amount of bananas, add some more cinnamon,some nutmeg, and substitute regular sugar for some brown sugar. I also did add two tsp. of vanilla extract to the batter.

Spectacular!!! these were very good... few accomodations, i used 1/4 c. heavy cream and lightened it up a lil by adding some water beacuse i didnt have any sour cream and skipped on the banana ( i added raisins)... also for the streusal topping i added some oats and they came out perfect!! i know i shouldnt really be rating this recipe on the count that i didnt follow it down to the T but there isnt a simple recipe on this site that is this easy and that u can really work with by adding and ommiting ingredients like this one... i just believe i owe it to this recipe submittion.. thanx..cant say i enough great mufins...

These are very good, the streusel wa gummy, not crumbly but I think that was my fault.  It still melted over the tops and added a good flavor.  BB with that much sour cream can get heavy, but these were light and moist.   I read a great reminder to not overmix the batter, just enough to get the dry ingredients mixed.  Good point to follow.

I was out of sour cream, so I substituted vanilla yogurt.  I also substituted canola oil for the butter because I don't regularly use or keep butter on hand.  The muffins turned out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Really yummy!  I followed the directions exactly and they came out great.  My boy friend loves them. 

I did use margarine and it was too soft when I made the topping and it didn't come out like streusel.  I will make sure to have COLD butter/margarine next time.

These are really good muffins, and I think what makes them special is both the sour cream and the streusel topping!  This is my go to recipe when I have ripe bananas!

These were great!  Loved the flavor and the streusel just topped it off.  I only baked them for 15 minutes... which was perfect for nice moist muffins.  I actually got 18 regular-sized muffins out of the recipe... which may explain why the recipe says to bake for 20 minutes... the recipe baking time must be for 12 jumbo muffins instead of regular sized.

These were delicious!  I didn't have sour cream so I put in 2 of the snack pack apple-mango sauces - YUM!!  They turned out quite sweet but I think that's why my husband liked them.  The topping is awesome!!!!!

This was by far one of the best banana muffins I've ever tasted. I only made one substitution because I was low on eggs. So, instead of eggs I added 2T of milled flax seed, plus an additional 2T of butter. Delicious!

These are great! The recipe is perfect the way it is.  Or, using bananas that had been frozen, I cut the sour cream to one cup.  And, they were just as great as non-frozen bananas and two cups of sour cream.

I used more mashed banana (because I had a ton) and 1/2 c sourcream. Double the topping and I got about 18 muffins. Very good, love the topping.

4 stars only because it's not as healthy as muffins I usually make, but they were so easy, and my family loved them!  I'll probably add a bit of wheat germ next time just for some extra nutrition, but I'm definitely making them again!

These are great! I made them as both regular sized and mini muffins. Each turned out well :). I cooked them for a shorter period of time for the mini muffins.

Excellent!  I made this for our Sunday morning Bible Study and everyone loved it!!  Streusel on top makes it!!  Perfect alternative for banana bread when needing to get rid of aging bananas!

Update, I searched for a "new" recipe to use up my bananas (again) and came across this one...again!  Didn't realize it until I decided to rate it!  Only change this time is I didn't take the time to make the streusel, so I gently sprinkled brown sugar over each one, put an ever so slight dab of butter atop each one, and lightly sprinkled oats.  Still 5 stars!  Excellent recipe!  (again)  lol  I guess I'd better put this one in my recipe box!

best banana muffin recipe I have ever made!! I had to use 1/2 a cup of oil with 1/2 cup of sour cream as I ran out of sour cream and I used 5 medium bananas instead of 2 ( I love the rich banana flavor).  I baked these for 30 mins and they were fluffy and moist and amazing. I would add more cinnamon and some chocolate chips maybe next time. perfect texture!!

I followed the recipe exactly, streusel melted all over and created a crust on top but still tasted  good. For the second batch, I added more flour to the streusel mixture and it turned out better.  Muffins did not have much flavor.  Next time I may add more cinnamon.

absolutley amazing!!! Followed directions perfectly.They were sooooo moist and my kids love them. I am going to make another batch and freeze them for my kids school lunches as I am sure that this batch will not make it past the week prior to school. Thank you so much for this recipe, it is a keeper.

Perfect muffins!  In my muffin pans, this recipe made 15 muffins.  I made it exactly as written and they came out light and perfectly flavored with banana and cinnamon (even at our high altitude).  Took 'em to my work with college kids and they were gone within minutes.  Thanks, Robin!

These are delicious and taste just like banana bread! I decided to make them without the streusel topping and they are still sweet. I think I prefer them this way.   I definitely plan on making this recipe again in the future. YUM, YUM!

I've made nearly every banana muffin/bread recipe on here and this is far and away the very best. I made these exactly the way the recipe calls for and they were fabulous! The two of us gobbled up 4 just out of the oven. They were big and fluffy and moist and just really really good. Just like a bakery! You have to try these.

This is a great base recipe for me. I pureed three bananas and a cup of strawberries in place of the mashed bananas. I also added oatmeal to the streusel topping. Excellent! The kids loved them and so did all my coworkers!

Sorry, made these yesterday, even added dried cranberries and chocolate chips AND vanilla extract, but they came out tasteless. I know there must be a better recipe for Banana Muffins  out there somewhere.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that i added about a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips. These muffins were heavenly, but the cooking time is too much. I cooked the muffins at 375 for 16 minutes - any longer and the would have been toast. I loved the streusel on top, it was divine. I'm really glad i added the chocolate chips. because i felt that on their own, the muffins may have been a bit bland.

These are wonderful muffins. I doubled the recipe with a few changes. I used 5 large bananas, 1 cup sour cream, 8oz of cream cheese, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon vanilla. I also added chopped pecans to the streusel. They turned out really moist and fluffy. will make this again. thanks

This was certainly a success! Everyone loved them, even without the streusel topping. Although next time I would probably add some walnuts for some extra texture. Thank you Robin for sharing this, now I have something to use ripe banana's in BESIDES banana bread!

All i can say is yum...I have never used sour cream in a muffin recipe but now i think its a staple. I used 3 bananas and more cinnamon in mine and baked them in "muffin top" pans for 15 mins and they turned out fab. My mom who doesn't bake much is making these tonight

I doubled the recipe and threw in a handful of chopped pecans. Baked in jumbo muffin tins at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. Excellent flavor and texture. This is my new favorite recipe for banana muffins. Doubling the recipe produced 12 jumbo muffins.

I made a half batch as I only had one banana and it was perfect. So glad to see a recipe that can easily be halved since it's only us in the house to eat them! These muffins are great and smell wonderful while they cook! I changed nothing except doubling the cinnamon and I Loved the simple & fresh flavor of banana that came through without a lot of other spices to cover it up. As other's have said, the topping is more of a "crunch" than a streusel but I liked that about it. I will alternate between this recipe and my other favorite depending on which topping I am in the mood for that day! Thanks so much for the easy and delicious recipe, it will be used in my house for many years to come :o) PS: A half recipe actually made eight muffins for me, maybe my muffin pan is smaller than the norm!

Delicious!!! I used half whole wheat flour, half brown sugar, 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and greek strained yogurt for the sourcream. I needed to use up some over ripe bananas and full-fat greek yogurt I bought by mistake...turned out great!! Will make this time and time again.

A good muffin recipe overall... I'm only giving 4 stars though because I didn't feel there was enough banana flavor. Next time I make this, I'll be sure to mash up a third banana. I will also add in some walnuts because I felt there was a "something crunchy" missing.

This was a wonderful muffin recipe. The best I've ever tasted. I made half the recipe in regular muffin tins and half in the mini muffin tins. I added one more banana and shortened the cooking time for the mini muffins. I think they were even better than the regular size. I think it has to do with having topping in every bite;)

These were very moist.  I did not follow the original recipe the first time and instead added extra spices as suggested by another reader.  I think I would like them much better WITHOUT the extra spices.  Somehow the banana with the cinnamon and the nutmeg didn't seem to go too well together.  I will probably add some toasted pecans to the batter and/or the struesel next time.  I think oats would also be very good in the topping.  You can substitute whole wheat pastry flour for all or half of the white flour called for.  It really doesn't change the consistency, but it helps get more whole grain into your diet.  Thank you for this recipe!  My kids really enjoyed them!

Wonderful Muffins!  I used fresh whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. instead of butter in the batter, I used applesauce.   This is a keeper!

This is the moistest, most flavorful banana muffin I have ever made!  After reading some reviews, I cut out some of the sugar since others said they were a bit on the sweet side - only 1 1/2 cups for a double batch instead of the full 2 cups. (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5).  I made them for my husband's office and they got rave reviews - one of his coworkers had one in his hand as he was eating another one at the same time!  I agree with other reviews that this isn't really a streusel topping, but it is good!  It makes the tops a little sweet and a bit crunchy!

These were very good. I made mini muffins out of them, which made 48 muffins, and cooked them for 15 minutes.  To make the topping more crumbly I added an extra tablespoon of flour and tablespoon and a half of sugar to the streusel topping.  Kids loved them!!

I just ate one still warm from the oven and it was delicious!  Now I have a great recipe for my too-ripe bananas!  I'm thinking that perhaps next time I might use 3/4 cups of sugar instead of a full cup, though, because they are very sweet.

These were delicious!  I had some bananas that were turning brown so I wanted to make something with them and found this recipe.  I doubled the cinnamon to both the mix and the topping as well as added an additional banana since I had 3.  I did have a little trouble getting the topping crumbly enough but the flavor was perfect!  They were moist and the top was sweet and crispy which balanced with the inside since it wasn't too sweet.  My husband loved them and I will definitely make again.  Thank you for the recipe!

a great muffin and a great way to use up bananas instead of plain old banana bread! Here are my changes....I used half white whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  I used egg substitute.  I used low fat buttermilk instead of sour cream.  I used 3 medium bananas.  I also added 1/4 cup wheat germ to the batter.  And, I also use more cinnamon than a recipe calls for.  I used 1 tsp in both the batter and streusel.  These were great with these changes!

Yummy and soft with a sweet crunchy topping! I was looking for an easy banana recipe that wasn't banana bread and this fit my needs perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly and was pleased with the results although I think I overbaked them by a few minutes.

My daughter had a fit over the "crunchy" muffins, but I actually decided that the crumb topping was not for me, I guess I prefer a soft top. However, the muffins were moist and delicious.  I did add cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter for some spice.

My muffins came out pretty yummy. The only thing I added to it was 1/2 tsp of vanilla, chopped walnuts, and a sprinkle or two of nutmeg. I still have to work on my streusel topping.

I made these the other night exactly like the recipe said to make them, and they were amazing! My husband devoured two, and he doesn't even like bananas!

Amazing muffins.  I can't wait to have some more over ripe bananas so I can make them again.  Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe.
