Okay, before I start, I KNOW I made a lot of changes but it was only due to extenuating circumstances and a deadline!  I used Italian sausage, crumbled, instead of breakfast sausage.  I also shredded my own potatoes, on the suggestion of another reviewer, and added some shredded sweet potato when I realized I didn't have enough potatoes.  I doubled the recipe, also, and upon realizing I had no idea where I put my muffin tin, just tossed the entire thing in a casserole dish and called it a day.  Found out too late that I had no butter in the house, so I used olive oil instead.  I also used green and orange bell pepper because that's all I had, too.  Finally, I sprinkled the cheese on top right before I popped it in the oven instead of mixing it with the eggs.  I didn't MEAN to make all these substitutions, but the finished product was great regardless!  I fully plan on making it again, per the instructions, but if I can do all this and it still comes out fine, then the recipe is definitely a keeper!
ADDENDUM:  I made this closer to the original recipe, except I left out the hashbrowns and just made the eggs in my muffin tin.  My husband LOVES THEM.  They're great for him to throw on an English muffin for a quick, on-the-go breakfast and I can make them in a large batch at the beginning of the week so he can just grab one and go.  Keeps getting better!

I followed the recipe exact. I made these for brunch and they were egg-cellent! (Sorry had to!) We loved them. Very handy for breakfast on the go, a brunch or even a snack, too. Be sure to grease the muffin pans good or it will stick. I did have to cook the hash browns a bit longer than stated in the recipe to get a nice crisp to them. I will definitely keep this one handy. Possibilities are endless for mix -ins.

I made these for a weekend breakfast but instead of frozen hash brown potatoes I used 3 medium sized russet potatoes, peeled and grated with the food processor then placed in the colander of a salad spinner and soaked in cool water to remove some of the starch.  Empty the water and spin the grated potatoes dry.  2 cups of cheese is WAY too much - there would have been no room for the sausage, peppers and eggs.  Bake times were perfect.  I have a few left over and think they will make for a quick on the go breakfast snack.  Update:  I made these again with just a couple of changes that worked well.  I used paper cupcake liners, sprayed with cooking spray.  I reserved the cheese to just add some to the top at the end of baking time.  This way I was able to fit a lot more sausage into each muffin cup.  Using the convection setting on my oven really helped to crisp up the potatoes.  These reheat very well, perfect for a quick breakfast on the go.

Update: I have tried different potatoes in these. I have used potatoe tots, potato rounds, and hash browns. Tater tots
Work great if you thaw them well and crush them up. I add garlic salt and chopped onion in the potato mixture and fill the tin half full with potatoes. I spray the tins with Pam and then spray the potatoes with Pam before baking. Make sure you push the potatoes down well. After baking fill with your families favorite ingredients. I fill the tin full and they rise up nice without running over. They puff up big but fall down after baking. A pound of tots makes 24-36 muffins depending on you ingredients.  After cooling I put two in a zip lock bag and freeze them. It is great grab and go breakfast or after school treat for kids. I keep these in the freezer.

I understand this recipe is an ad for a sausage company. This said, I made with 1 lb. cooked until crisp, drained and crumbled bacon, 3/4 c shredded cheddar, and followed rest of recipe. Absolutely terrific! Will never try it any other way! Thanks for the inspiration, Johnsonville!

Easy and yummy. I used fresh potatoes and 1/2 the cheese as suggested by Baking Nana. Thanks for a tasty recipe. Next time I will use less sausage too - the sausage overpowered a bit for us. These are great reheated!

I reduced the amount of sausage for our family preference, but these have a nice, solid taste to them + were quick + easy to make. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BASE RECIPE. I've already made several batches + here are my suggestions.  Skip the butter and just press the hash browns into a sprayed pan.  I do this by spraying the muffin tin and then dropping a small handful of hash browns in to each opening. Then take a 1/4 cup measure, spray the back side (bottom) of it, and squash it into the muffin tin holding the hash browns.  This presses it down + up the sides brilliantly. You may have to wipe off the 1/4 cup measure and respray it several times. Then I sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Bake the 12 minutes as suggested.  Then, add in whatever finely diced toppings you like. Finally, pour in the egg over each cup and bake per the recipe.   A couple of thoughts on the cheese.   We try not to each much of it, so I have made these without cheese and they still taste great.  I've also tried topping them with cheese at the last few minutes of baking, which didn't turn out so well.  The muffins have a rounded top and the cheese fell off and crisped up along the sides of the tin.   This could be because I overfill mine with toppings...  but this is what I've experienced.   I love the flexibility of this recipe.  I love that I can jam some of these full of mushrooms, spinach, peppers and asparagus.  Right along side of the cheese and egg only for my picky eater.  Love love love it!

These truly were amazing.  The potatoes were crispy and buttery, and the layers worked really well together.  The top was fluffy and the hash browns sweet, with a layer of sausage-goodness in-between.  My family is craving this recipe so I'll be making it again and again!

I made the following substitutions: Being on a paleo diet the potatoes were OUT. I subbed shredded turnip and cauliflower. I used crumbled turkey sausage;  instead of 6 whole eggs, used 3 and subbed egg whites for the remaining 3, reduced the cheese and just added it on the top during the last few minutes of baking. Also added peppers, onions and spinach, oh boy, my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it!

These are delicious but I rated 4 stars due to the fact that I think some of the amounts are a little off.  I used about half the sausage and half the cheese called for. With these modifications they are going over very well with my boys. I used fresh Simply Potatoes Shredded Hash Browns instead of frozen. I could definitely see switching up the ingredients. I want to try with spinach, red bell, and feta.

I made it as written but found that the hashbrowns didn't crisp and these muffins were hard to get out of the pan (but they tasted good!) Also, the proportions were definitely off. It calls for far too much cheese and I needed more egg. I made a second batch and used my silicone mini muffin pan and upped the temp for baking the hashbrowns to 425. After pouring in the egg, I turned down the temp to 400 and finished cooking as the recipe states.  They turned out MUCH better:  Crispy hashbrown base and they popped right out of the silicone pan. I'll definitely make them again and I am going to try freezing & reheating the leftover muffins from today.

This is a reprise of my earlier review.  Yep, we still love 'em!  After grinching about the hashbrowns sticking to the bottom of the muffin tins, repeatedly.......I bought a Texas-Jumbo sized muffin tin that was non-stick.  You need to cook a little longer due to the large size (and it only makes 6) but they slip right out of the tin.  These are good anytime but making in advance in putting in the freezer makes them readily accessible. The addition of fresh fruit and blueberry/cranberry muffins make a delightful breakfast.

Not only are these pretty, they are tasty as well.  I’ve made these with both breakfast sausage and using sweet sausage removed from its casing and cooked the crumbled sausage until brown. These are perfect for any brunch. I prefer these made with freshly shredded red potatoes, squeezed and nuked for a minute before adding the remainder of ingredients.

First of all, I'm a freak about sneaky ways to get my teen boys to eat a various assortment of vegetables. I used 1/2 regular tater tots, 1/2 sweet potato tots. SIX sweet potato tots contain 30% vitamin A! My boys would NEVER touch a sweet potato! The half & half mix with the regular tots disguised it well! I think the exact count was 30 tots of each to total 3 cups. I thawed them, broke them up and mixed. I greased the muffin tins with the bacon grease, using the larger muffin tins. I baked the tots in the tins at 400 until well browned. I also cut up a handful of fresh spinach, red bell pepper, and green onions-- all mixed in the bacon-egg mixture.  They were excellent! I'm just getting ready to start the second batch which will be sausage, red bell pepper, green chiles & a small amount of jalapenos, with a Mexican cheese. I also thought about using regular potato (grated) and grated/shredded carrots for the crust, but glad I went with the sweet potato. It gave it a nice slightly sweet element. Great recipe!

Great recipe that combines everything you need for breakfast in a few bites! Plus they're great for "on the go". I used Ore-Ida hash browns and opted out of the red pepper. I used half the amount of cheese which proved to be a good decision and added a little half and half to the eggs to get them nice and fluffy. These were easy to put together and were done in no time at all. I'll definitely make these again. Perfect with a side of fresh fruit and a glass of OJ!

I just made these for a work pot luck.  I used bacon because I don't like sausage.  I doubled the recipe and added 4 more eggs.  I also cooked it for 18 minutes after the eggs were added.  This is great!  They came out of the pan easily and are a perfect portion for each person.  It seemed like too much cheese before it was cooked, but perfect after cooked.

We thought this was pretty yummy. Unfortunately, we had to omit the bell pepper and chives (not on hand). So we added some chili powder to give it more of a kick. Also, we had to cut it down quite a bit, since it's only the 2 of us, but we each ate 2 muffins. We normally go exactly by the recipe the first time we make an item, but we couldn't wait to taste it this morning. Next time, we will use the recipe exactly, and I'm sure it will get 5 stars from us again!

As I'm counting calories, I did a slimmed down version.  Used a low fat cheese and cut the quantity in half (was still plenty of cheese!).  I also used a veggie sausage, zapped the bell peppers til softened before adding to the egg and also added summer savory to the egg mixture.  Will use egg substitute next time.  Man, these were good!

Followed the recipe exact. They were without a doubt , absolutely delicious. The nice thing about this recipe, is you can add anything your family enjoys. will definitely make again and again. The only negative comment, I would have, is despite spraying my muffin pan heavily, I still had quite a mess with some sticking to the inside of the muffin pan.
Thanks to a reviewer, that said to use a 1/4 cup,to press in the hash browns. Worked like a charm.

I cut out the separate baking part and just put the potatos in the bottom of paper cups and poured the mixture over it and cooked it altogether for 18 mins on 350, I would double cup it next time because the bottoms were kinda greasy but I recommend the cups if you have little ones. Worked great!  Thanks for the idea!

These were very good!  I have a ton of shredded zucchini from the garden that I froze for later use- I lightly salted it and let it drain in a colander for about an hour and then subbed it for the hash browns, worked perfectly!

I really like this breakfast treat! I looked over some of the reviews and saw that many people did substitutes. I actually did this recipe in the large Texas size muffin pan. It was equivalent to a slice of quiche! Here are my substitutes: I did not have the red or green bell pepper so I used red onions and caramelized. I used chicken breakfast sausage because I do not eat beef or pork. I think next time I will forgo all the meat and do veggies such as mushrooms and spinach! Serve this with fresh fruit berries and coffee for a special brunch!

Hash browns were bland at the bottom so next time will add more seasoning before cooking.

So easy.  So versatile.  The only change I made was to add a couple of Tbsp. of milk and to adjust each muffin to the tastes of my individual family members.  Some wanted theirs without red bell peppers, my pescetarian didn't want the sausage, etc.  It was nice to be able to make those adjustments without any big to do.  My mom tried a couple of these and mentioned how well she thought they would freeze.  What a great idea, then they would be a great breakfast to pop into the microwave on a busy morning or for kids to have as an after school snack.  This is definately a keeper!

The hashbrowns didn't crisp for me but the finished product did come out for the most part(I lost 2 due to them falling apart). Overall, not very impressed.

Delicious! I used the breakfast chicken sausage links and it was so tasty! Easy to make...I will keep this recipe forever....really good. I did add some green pepper too, for color. Do not overfill...the eggs do rise up.Make sure you oil/grease your muffin tins and the come out easy.

I am eating this right now and it is so good!I did not have sausage so I used ham and it is great!  I think next time I may add some tomoatos and maybe some spinach to it but then will probably need to add another egg.  the great thing about this recipe is that you can use whatever you have in your fridge!  Love it!

I accidentally forgot to pre bake the hash brown crust on my 2nd batch and they still tasted as good as the first batch. Plus they were easier to get out of my muffin pan. However the 1st batch wasn't difficult to get out of the muffin pan either.You just don't want to rush it....even though you want to cause they look and smell so darn good!

We made these for Easter weekend. They were quick and easy. They also heat up very well after the fact, so they are wonderful to make ahead of time!!!

I have never made a breakfast casserole in muffin cups like this. It was interesting to try. I read through many of the reviews to make sure I got this right. Some people said that their potatoes did not crisp in the 12 minutes. I kept mine in the oven for 30, 3 racks down from the top. It got some golden spots on the edges at that point and it also helped the potatoes to loosen and form more of a cup. They also have to be flattened well to make room for the other filling. To help with browning I also sprayed the muffin cups with PAM and then after shaping them spritz the tops with olive oil. I had a good durable muffin pan, so it helped immensely with avoiding sticking. I just set it on a sheet pan for ease. After the potatoes were done, I then followed the rest of the recipe as is. I noticed the recipe calls for 12 links and the package has 14. I was able to fit 5~6 sausage pieces in each cup or about 11~12 links, as suggested. After adding the egg mixture I baked them for 18 minutes. I let them kool about 15 minutes before removing from pan. I had a plastic knife ready to loosen them up, but they slipped right out of the pan with no problems. I would not have thought to make a breakfast recipe like this, but I liked how it created individual servings. I would just serve it with some cut up fruit or oj for a rounded breakfast.

This recipe was awesome even though I didn't have bell peppers or onions on hand and I had to sub bacon for sausage because I didn't have that either.  STILL fantastic although the bacon made them a tad bit greasier (kids and hubby still loved it). I also added a pinch of onion powder (since I didn't have onions) a pinch of garlic powder and some seasoned salt.  For those who said the hash browns didn't crisp or they stuck, I always bake with Pampered Chef stoneware.  I am NOT a PC distributor but I do love the way this stoneware bakes and cooks everything so evenly.  Next time I'm trying this with turkey sausage and the onions and peppers.  Nonetheless, this is quick and easy enough to make on a school day and it has already been requested to be in the "circulation!"  Yum! Thanks!  One more thing...so easy to tweak to your liking, add or omit and still be good.  Those are recipes I really love!

OMG this recipe is to die for. Made it **exactly** as written with one exception: Instead of using sausage, I made 6 of the cups with cooked bacon and 6 of the cups with steamed asparagus. Love that you can make both a meat and a vegetarian option in the same batch!!  Used Pam liberally, along with a non-stick 12 cup muffin pan, and they slid out perfectly after 5 minutes of cooling. For the people who said 2 cups of cheese was too much, try using the thinly shredded 4 cheese Mexican blend. I did this, and 2 cups of cheese turned out to be perfect. Used mashed Ore Ida tater tots for the hash brown crust. Also, you can watch a video of how to make this on the Johnsonville website. Great for entertaining, will make many more times.

Really great flavors and presentation. Do follow the directions and have some paper towels ready to remove some of the oil collected at the bottom of the cups. This would be a great take along recipe for family and church brunches. This really is just a casserole recipe made in a muffin tin. This recipe was extremely easy to prepare.

These were pretty good; I'm not much of an egg person and I liked it better than I expected I would.  I could not get all of the sausage to fit in the cups though, even cutting down on some of the cheese mixed in.  Also, I made them with cupcake liners and I wish I would have skipped the liners.  With a great nonstick pan the liners are not necessary and just stick to the food.

This is so yummy. It is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I made it for dinner and served it with a side salad. The leftovers were great warmed up for breakfast the next morning. I shredded 2 cups of fresh potatoes, rinsed and spun dry in a salad spinner and it worked perfectly instead of buying frozen hash browns. My package of sausage links had 14 so I cut the other two up and put on top of the muffins prior to baking. Definitely will be making again!

First time I've ever cooked sausage links in the oven.  Followed the instructions on the Johnsonville® pkg and baked 12 minutes @ 350 degrees F for perfectly cooked sausage.  No skillet to clean, no grease from splattering, this is the way to go, and it's now my go-to method!  This was Breakfast for Friday Night Dinner, and these really are appropriately named because we thought they were "amazing."   Followed the recipe to the letter, and wouldn't change a thing.  Had some left over, and they went into the freezer for a quick reheat weekday breakfast.  ****UPDATE 3.15.17***** Forgot to put the muffin tin with potatoes in the oven to bake for 12 minutes, just put in the sausage pieces and egg mixture, and they still baked up beautifully.  Saved myself a step, and will do this in the  future.  Used Colby Jack cheese (what I had on hand), and it worked well.  Into the freezer for a quick breakfast-to-go!

Easy and delicious.  I've made this several times now and they always come out great.  The potatoes were crispy - I used Ore Ida country style hash browns and they turned out great.  I don't like peppers and chives so I left those out, but I don't think it mattered a bit.  The sausage was mild but flavorful and the eggs came out great.  This would make a great on the go breakfast, too.  A keeper for sure!

Quick and easy! I used Ore-Ida tator tots (2 per silicone muffin cup) instead of the frozen hash browns, and 1/2 package of Johnsonville Ground Mild Italian Sausage instead of the breakfast links. I agree with others that the 2 cups of cheese would have been too much, and I used about half that amount. These were so cute, and made a nice "Brinner" (Breakfast for Dinner) tonight! I served it with quartered tomatoes with basil, toast & OJ. Had dinner on the table in no time. Thanks Johnsonville! UPDATE (4/13/14): I made these again today, and this time I took the advice from Baking Nana and used russet potatoes shredded in my food processor, rinsed in my salad spinner and spun dry. Worked great (much better than the tator tots I used last time)! I only used 8 links of Johnsonville Original Breakfast Sausage (cutting each link into 6 pieces, and using 4 pieces per muffin cup. I also used pepper jack cheese which I shredded myself (about 1 cup), because that's what I had on hand. These turned out perfect! So pretty, so tasty, and the perfect addition to our brunch today.

I like creative recipes like this but they usually don't turn out for me the first time so I iterate.   My 1st attempt tasted good but stuck to the bottom of the pans despite greasing them.  My second attempt didn't taste as good and still was a pain to clean up.   My 3rd attempt (so far) was to use parchment paper baking cups and cleanup problem was solved.   I'm still working on flavor but my 3rd attempt used thawed country style hash browns precooked in a skillet with onions and green peppers for about 8 minutes (basically potatoes O'Brien).  I made a nest of the pre-cooked hash browns in the bottom of each cup but didn't try to press them real hard.   I followed the rest of the recipe as written and they turned out great style wise but need work on flavor -- looked just like the picture on this recipe.   Bottom line, try parchment paper cups if you are having problems with sticking and don't aggressively press the potato mixture into a cup shape (which can cause sticking), make a looser nest instead.

Only a few changes; cooked bacon in a small cast iron skillet and used the skillet as the cooking vessel, there are only 2 of us. Adjusted ingredients accordingly, used 4 eggs and cut back on everything else. Will definitely make again

1) I didnt measure...like anything....
2) I finely chopped spinach and added
3) 1/2 egg whites and 1/2 whole eggs cook slightly different..whites seem to take a tad longer
4) hash browns took about 22min in oven.to brown
5) I didnt have onions or chives (oops) but I had dehydrated onions I added to the egg mixture


Taste is absolutely WONDERFUL! I would definitely make again!

Very good, simple recipe. Added a couple minutes to the first hashbrown baking step. Will likely add a couple more minutes next time so they get crispier. I might not have pushed them down enough in the muffin pan. They didn't fall apart, stayed in the muffin shape. Very easy and very good.

Great recipe but I made some changes. Instead of adding red pepper I used Rotel out of the can. I also used sausage and crumbled it up and mixed it in with the egg.

Great Brunch Recipe or for a light dinner!  This is the second time I had made it, so I changed it up a little.  Instead of the Johnsonville® original breakfast links, I used a half-cup of Johnsonvile® mild italian sausage.  instead of the  bell pepper and onion, I used a can of green chilies and sliced black olives.  It was great!

Amazing is right! They're like delicious little sausage quiches! Elegant, easy and quick! Very nice. It took a while for my hash brown crusts to brown. Much longer than 12 minutes. (Maybe it was the pan, or my oven is not heating properly.) They turned out fine though. I'd make these again. My favorite destination for breakfast is now JOHNSONVILLE! Thank you, Johnsonville!

This were tasty.  Be sure to cook the potatoes long enough until they are crisp so they will slide out of the pan.  Otherwise, they may stick to the pan, even after spraying with cooking spray.

Everyone loved these for Easter brunch. I added fresh jalapeno, and made pico de gallo to go with.

I made these for a Sunday morning breakfast and they were way more work than I prefer for such a simple result/flavor.  Any make ahead egg egg bake w/similar ingredients tastes the same w/fewer steps.  My other issue is the ingredients:  this is a brand sponsored recipe, so you'd assume they know their brand.  Jville breakfast sausages come in a 14 pack, yet this recipe calls for just 12 (and I used just 4 and it was plenty).  Shredded potatoes come in much larger packages, so now I'm forced to come up with a use for the rest of the (thawed, per directions) potatoes or they'll go to waste.  These taste fine, but just aren't worth the effort/waste in our world.  THANKS for the recipe, Jville.

These muffin cups were amazing! Great for dinner as well as for breakfast!I think I may have used too much hashbrowns because it took 10-15 minutes longer than the instructions to crisp them up. I made the recipe as written except for variations based on taste for each member of my family. That's what I love about these - they are so versatile. One can add ingredients that they like to each cup making them customizable - I left out the cheese for all but mine (and I just sprinkled it on top) and put no peppers in some of them. I even made a few using a some prepared crescent roll dough instead of hashbrowns for my potato averse son. Everyone gobbled them up!

I made these for dinner tonight and they were a big hit!  I didn't use all the sausage or cheese called for.  It would have been WAY too much.  I used maple flavored Johnsonville breakfast sausage and O'Brien style hash browns.  The egg mixture could use a little salt and pepper, but otherwise they tasted great!  Several people mentioned they had trouble with these sticking, but I used vegetable shortening instead of cooking spray to grease my muffin tins and they came out of the pan very easily.  Will definitely make again!

This was so good!  I made this dish this morning to have with a friend of mine who is helping me pack my house up for an upcoming move.  It was a hit!  She kept going on and on about how delicious and "perfect" these were!  I had to give her the recipe before she left today :-)  

Ok, the only things I did differently was I baked the hash browns for the length of time the recipe called for, but they didn't crisp up like I wanted.  SO, I simply turned on my broiler and let them crisp up that way.  The other thing I did was I cut back one of the eggs.  I used 5 instead and it was exactly the right amount of egg mixture I needed.  I was able to fill each muffin tin level to the top.  Oh, and instead of bagged cheese, I grated my own.  So , this recipe didn't need any adjusting except for 1 egg less.  I call this dish a SUCCESS!

De-lish! And so pretty! I loved the potatoes on the bottom. Next time I might cook the potatoes a little longer just to crisp them up some. I did use about half the cheese called for, but that's personal preference. We will definitely make these again.

I just got these out of the oven a few minutes ago. I have to say, they are very tasty. I did have to use a roll of sausage because I didn't have any links thawed out, though. I also had only put about 1 2/3 cups of shredded colby/jack cheese(it was what I had on hand). I sprinkled a little garlic powder over the potatoes before I mixed in the butter and seasoning for a little extra kick. 

TIP:I don't know if it was the sausage, the cheese or the butter, or a combination of all three, but there was a lot of grease bubbling over the side of the pan and dripping on the oven bottom, so next time I will use a pan under the muffin pan and I will also use foil cupcake liners, as the potatoes didn't come completely out of the muffin cups.It will make cleanup a lot easier!

Quick and easy for breakfast.  You can use a variety of leftovers, whether its veggies or cheeses, and just toss them into the muffin tins for a versatile breakfast.  Make sure to use non-stick muffin tins though, I used Pam and it was still difficult to get the muffin cups out of the tins.

These were easy and quick to put together.  Mine were a little salty, but it's because I added salt when the recipe did not call for it.  Mine were also a little runny, so be careful with how much liquid you add.  I did add a bit more liquid than called for.  Everyone enjoyed these and the best part is they are Gluten Free!

We thought these were great!  Very easy to customize for my daughter who isn't eating a lot of meat these days - I simply didn't add the sausage to several of the muffin cups. Mine turned out perfectly, although I felt the hash browns are sort of lost in the bottom (and hash browns are probably my favorite part of breakfast!).  This would also be good cooked in a casserole dish which would probably appeal more to men - somehow I think a big square wouldn't be as "dainty" as the muffins, but they were perfect for me and my girls!

Not sure what I did wrong, but mine did not come out of the muffin pans. Ended up having to use a spoon to scoop them out. The flavor is good, but I agree with other commenters that it calls for too much cheese and definitely too much sausage. I think my trouble might have been with the hash browns. They didn't go all the way up the sides and they never really got golden brown, even though I cooked them longer than the recipe calls for. It may have been the positioning of my oven rack, which I ended up adjusting. I can see how this recipe could easily be adapted to different flavors and I really want to use it again but I'd have to figure out how to make the hashbrown component work, first.

Yummy! But I'll definitely use cupcake liners next time, they stuck to the pan, even well greased. Just used about half a package of ground sausage, and I recommend putting the cheese in first, then pouring the eggs in. Also had to changes the ingredient amounts a bit, more eggs and potatoes and less cheese.

I made the jumbo version of these, sorry my picture wouldn’t load up.  They were a little dry on the bottoms I think that combining all the ingredients together and baking would fix that instead of baking the hash browns separately.  They were delicious though and I would make them again!

A different option for breakfast. Great to take on the go or to storage in the fridge and  eat them when needed.  I love to have them with salad for brunch. You can reheat them for a few seconds in the microwave or eat them cold, they taste delicious anyway.

Very good! Nice presentation thanks to the red pepper and green onion colors. Followed almost exactly except used less cheese. I sprayed the pan generously with canola oil spray and the muffins slid right out.

These were a big hit. I altered the recipe just a smidge. There were NO leftovers. The most challenging step was getting the hash browns spread in the cupcake tins. Oh! and I recommend spraying the pan first. I didn't it was a pain to clean. :-P

These were delicious. I did have a bit of trouble with the hash browns. First, I couldn't get them up the side of the muffin cup and second they would not brown. After 18 minutes I pulled them out and blotted the hash brown cups of the excess butter. They finally browned after 23 minutes. The rest of the assembly was easy and the outcome was delicious.

This is a delicious recipe. After perusing comments, I knew that I could substitute/change ingredients and still have a great tasty breakfast muffin. So I modified based on what I had in the fridge as well as my family preferences and what could fit into the muffin cup!

I used frozen tater tots instead of hash browns. I microwaved them for 4 minutes and used 4 per muffin cup as a base. My family also prefers spicy so I added salsa to the egg mixture as well as to the layered ingredients and added cilantro and avocado in the cup.  Next time I make these (and that will be soon!) I will take a little more care in assembling these. Hubby prefers to taste each ingredient in every bite. So I'd layer it more like a lasagna ensuring he gets a yummy taste of every ingredient with each bite. I may use bacon next time for taste comparison.

And, to get around other reader's comments regarding sticking to the muffin pan, not only did I spray the pan but cut and used small pieces of parchment paper. The muffins came out with no problems and the pan was easy to wash!

I made the recipe as written.  I sent these off with my son and husband as they worked on my son's Eagle scout  Project with a few  youth and adult volunteers.  They were a big hit and they hit the spot as the group work on planting trees and installing a deer fence!  Great for taking to go, no plates or utensil really needed!  Thanks, will be making these again!

Cute idea but too time consuming to be considered a quick grab. Ways I didn't follow the recipe but it still turned out: shredded my own potatoes (probably the biggest slow down because of work and cooking time), used ground sausage, forgot the cheese and added it to the top after, forgot to mix butter with the hash browns.  Pretty good recipe if you can mess up cooking as much as I do to have it still turn out! :) If you're in it for something fast to grab you may just like to cook the hash browns and egg mix separately and just put it in baggies.  If making a large batch I would use a food processor to shred the potatoes.  3 med-large potatoes made about 3 cups shredded.

I normally don't write reviews, but felt compelled to do so.  Fantastic!  Thank you...I do find them labor intensive, however, for brunch and to freeze for later use, it's worth the effort. I didn't have links and used Bob Evans italian sausage.  It gave it a nice tangy taste.  Doubled the recipe, and mixed eggs with pepper and sausage. Used my convection oven, and sprayed top of hash browns. Also make both large muffin cups and smaller ones.  Since my family loves to eat, I think I will on make the larger ones in the future.  Great recipe...thanks!

This recipe is very very good! Keeper for make ahead type of breakfast! I did not have enough green onion so I chopped a bit of yellow onion and added it to the egg mixture. It ended up great! My only mistake was that I used cooking spray which I think was not enough for preventing them to slightly sticking to the muffin pan.

We loved this! Very good base recipe and easy to substitute lots of ingredients!  
I made a couple of changes - I used / cup of broccoli instead of red pepper 'cos that's what I had on hand and wanted to use up. This would be great with mushrooms too (IMHO) Also I threw everything in the bowl then put it into muffin tins only because I missed the step making it into 2 steps - worked perfect.   I also didn't have any frozen hash browns so I shredded 2 potatoes instead. And I only use 1 1/4 c shredded cheese because that's what I had on hand.  
I was making some vegetarian so I only added 8 sausages (if you cut them before you brown them they will cook faster), and added a few splashes of Franks Red Hot.

You don't have to use sausage, its really yummy with leftover ham off the bone, or whatever's in the fridge, sometimes I also add a small amount of finely chopped tomatoes.

These egg/potato muffins are an excellent idea for customizing breakfast offerings for people with many different tastes. The possibilities are endless. I recently made a batch for which several contained no meat, several had different vegetables, and several were made very spicy. You really can use the basic potato / egg foundation as a starting point to make these however you might prefer. Will definitely make again and again, playing with different combinations of meats, cheeses, veggies, and spices.

Good for on the go breakfasts. Pan was a pain to clean, even though I sprayed Pam on it prior to cooking.

Great tasting! I brought these to Sunday school and everyone raved about them!  I almost left them at home because I could not get the hash brown bottoms/sides out even though I sprayed the pan with Pam.  Regardless, they were still delicious.  I think next time I will just mix the hash browns & meat in with the egg mixture and cook in one step.  Also, I used the Jimmy Dean precooked turkey sausage in one batch and chopped ham in another batch so I wouldn't have to deal with the grease.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed.  They are ok.  I didn't read any reviews before hand.  I would make them again but next time I will 1/2 the amount of cheese, add a little bit of spinach and use crisp bacon instead of sausage.

I made this with the following modifications: I used turkey sausage links and reduced it to 6 sausage links.  Increased to 3/4 cup of red, yellow and orange bell peppers.  Added more eggs (8 total) to compensate for the decreased sausage.  I followed other user's advice and only used about 3/4 cup of shredded Mexican cheese mix.  I cooked the hash browns for 20 mins and they were brown and crispy at the tops, but still kinda mushy in the bottoms.  I live in Denver, so things take longer to cook/crisp here.  Next time I will try tater tots as another user suggested.  I think they will mash flatter and cook more evenly than the hash browns.  I actually wish I had used more cheese - it kind of got lost in the egg mixture.  I didn't account for the eggs expanding - I probably could have stuck with the 6 eggs.  Also, the eggs needed a little salt.  Overall good recipe.

I made these for a weekend breakfast and followed the recipe exactly.  We don't do a lot of savory breakfasts around here, but these were so good!  My husband and I loved them.  Our 3 boys wanted to pick out all of the peppers and green onion, but they are picky.  They were also wonderful for reheating in the toaster oven days later!  I'm planning on making them again soon.

I thought this was a great recipe.  Out did seem like an awful lot of cheese the first time I made it but go with what the recipe says.  The only change I had to make was baking time for the hash browns.  Mine were done perfectly after 18mn. Other than that no changes,  everybody loved them. Next time I'm going tho try steak onions and mushrooms!

Delicious little treats.  We had breakfast for dinner.  I made 9 of these, and the two of us finished them with no problem.  Very, very good and also very easy.  We'll do this one again for sure!  Thanks, Johnsonville!!

No matter what their shape, they are delish! I used my popover pan Amazing Muffin Cups... and they came out cone shaped! LOL! I've been making these for years, even included them in a cooking class I taught a few years back and some of my students still are making them for a quick brunch or fast dinner for the fam. I like to add a little hot sauce to my eggs and some chopped spinach but however you slide on this one it's going to be a winner with Johnsonville breakfast sausages.

Loved these! I liked the hashbrown crust and we loved the flavor of the muffins. My kids really enjoyed these. Bake time was perfect. I did add a bit of cayenne into the egg mix. Would love these with some mushrooms. Yummy! Great addition to a breakfast for dinner :) Served with fresh strawberries.

ABSOLUTELY use foil muffin liners.  at least, if you did, as i did, use shredded sweet potatoes instead of the hashbrowns.  but they are divine.  i enjoyed every bite, and then spent an hour cleaning my muffin pans!  (worth it!)  :)

These were delicious and very easy to make.  I followed another reviewer's advice to grate my own potatoes for the hashbrowns.  They just need to be rinsed and wrung out once or twice, so that there isn't too much moisture.

I forgot to thaw the hash browns ahead of time so I put 3/4 of a two lb. bag of potatoes in a colander and ran some luke warm water over them for maybe a minute and then sat them in the sink to drain well.  I added seasoning to our taste to the potatoes and I didn't have red peppers on hand so I opened up a small can of green chiles and spooned it on top of the egg mixture before I placed the sausage in the cups.  The green chiles really added a nice flavor.

These were pretty yummy! If I had to change anything though, I'd add less cheese. They made them more chewy and less airy. If fact, I'd omit the cheese all together. These make great lunch pack items for the next day though. I had them for lunch 2 days in a row. I will make these again! Also, I must add that Johnsonville sausage is the best breakfast sausage I have ever tried. Perfect flavor and really juicy.

Well, these actually are AMAZING, just like the name implies. I have made them twice so far, and they have been devoured each time. My mom came for breakfast yesterday and ate 3 of them then asked for the recipe.
The only change I made was to omit the red bell pepper because my kids don't care for it. Otherwise followed the recipe. These are a bit time consuming, so I won't be making them too often, maybe once a month for Sunday brunch, but they are super tasty! Thank you, Johnsonville!

We will be serving these for Easter brunch.  I need to bake them in muffin cups so I have to figure a way to keep them from sticking, I think the egg seeps between the potatoes.  I will use ground sausage for those only because of the number we have to make.  And the bonus is I can easily adapt these for our vegetarians.  Thank you Johnsonville for your great products and recipes!

This tasted very good but just wouldn't brown up for me! I put it under the broiler but that just browned the top, not the bottom and sides. Mine also stuck to the pan. I doubled the salt & pepper for the hash browns and I also added salt & pepper to the egg mixture. I used 1/2 of a 32 oz. bag of hash browns, which was just enough for 12 muffins. This was very tasty and the sausage inside was a nice surprise for my family!

This was such a quick and easy breakfast that I really didn't think would have much flavor. I was so WRONG! I used southern style hash browns o brian style. (they are a dice cut and have the bell pepper and onion in them) These was so good I could not keep them around. I will be making these again and trying the maple Johnsonville sausage in them.

My family loved these!  Even my picky 9 year old!  My husband thought they'd also be good using ground Johnsonville sausage instead of the breakfast links. I also found that the hash browns didn't crisp after 12 minutes.  I put them back in the oven for another 15 and they were perfect!

Love, love, love Johnsonville sausage.  These were very easy to make, did not have any problems getting them out of the muffin tin which I sprayed with non-stick spray.  I love this sausage so much that I ate a ton of it before finishing the dish.  Like others did I used less cheese but still had all items leftover so I just threw them all together and told my husband to eat for breakfast and I took the pretty ones to work.  lol

Following the recipe as-is, I really enjoyed these. My husband, however, had a few gripes. The hash browns would not crisp up properly, it needed a little less cheese and a little more seasoning. I will make this again with some changes and see if that will get more of an approval - great breakfast on-the-go idea!

Loved this recipe.  Used breakfast patties which were already skinless, so browned and crumbled this sausage. Liked the crispy potatoes.

These were super good.  I am made half the recipe exactly as stated and they were great.  I made the other half without the hash browns in order to cut down on carbs and they were also great. My family really enjoyed these. Thanks Johnsonville.

These were so good and went very well with pancakes as a nice breakfast for dinner!  These would be great to make up a batch (or two!) to have a nice brunch as well!  I did not add the bell pepper as I didn't have it on hand.  To get the potatoes to crisp up, after 15 minutes I turned the broiler on and just watched until they were brown.  The whole family loved these!

Lets just say we have a new favorite for breakfast.  These are wonderful fresh out of the oven or reheated the next day. The Hubs put one on an English muffin for a breakfast sandwich the next day and one of my kids put two in a tortilla, wrapped it up and ate it on the way out the door to school.  I made two versions - one with the shredded potatoes and I found they they stuck in the pan a bit.  Second version I use some potato rounds that just fit in the bottom of the pan.  The verdict was that everyone preferred the potato round better.  More potato flavor and more substantial to bite into.  Next time I make these I will add some fresh parsley and perhaps some other veggies like shredded zucchini, mushrooms and onion.  Lots of possibilities with this recipe.  I did freeze two just to see what it would be like. Well, they freeze best when completely cooled.  First batch they were still too warm and they defrosted "sponge like".  The second time I refrigerated the muffins first then froze.  We reheated for 40 seconds and they were perfect!  I plan on making a large batch to take on vacation and for on-the-go days when you need something quick.  What could be better -These are easy enough to whip up and will last (if your lucky!) a few days in the fridge AND they freeze well!.  Great recipe we will be making again! **My daughter came up with the idea to maybe try using silver dollar pancake on the bottom of the cupcake - will be giving that a try too! :)

These turned out perfect with no changes made to the recipe.  They puffed up nicely and were very flavorful.    I will definitely make these again.  However, I personally found them to be a bit time consuming for a morning dish.  Next time instead of lining the muffin cups with the hash browns, I'll just stir them in to the egg mixture.  I don't think the change would be noticeable.  Also, instead of fiddling with cutting up the links after they're cooked, I might use patties crumbled in the pan before cooking, or the ground Johnsonville Italian Sausage.  Hmmm.  That's sounding good already.  Hubs savored every bite, so in my book this is a winner!

This was the main dish for our Sunday brunch I never said the name of the recipe only that it was from Johnsonville and that I had used their breakfast sausage. Every single person at the brunch took a bite or 2 and then looked up and said " Joan these are amazing ". I used fresh potatoes and only needed 2 cups, I also didn't need 12 links I used 9 links and had more than enough meat. The other links didn't go to waste I just added them to the platter of links I had on the table and they were gone in minutes with many compliments to the chef and Johnsonville. I also only used 1/2 the cheese and I added 2 eggs, and as my guest said they were AMAZING.

These turned out great. Perfect crispness on the hash browns with a buttery flavor. I do think the cheese is a bit of an overload and took the suggestion of Baking Nana and cut back on the cheese. I didn't measure the cheese - just eyeballed it. Not being sure about the eggs I poured them level with the muffin tin and they looked great.  This recipe turned into a perfect nonstick delight. Adding to my TNT folder. *UPDATE* These are my go to breakfast muffins. I still only use half of the recommended amount of cheese and I make double batches so I can freeze some. Refrigerated or frozen they microwave perfectly.

Everyone loved these!!  I didn't have the peppers or onions (which I don't think would have gone over well with my little ones anyway), so I added 1 tsp dried onion flakes and a sprinkle of California garlic salt to the eggs.  Also, I used freshly shredded cheddar and ground browned sausage instead of the links because that's what I had.  Still turned out brilliantly.  I love it even more that this is such a versatile recipe!

It's a good base for us, but it just needed...something.  I followed the recipe except I used refrigerated hash browns and freshly shredded cheddar cheese due to pantry limitations.  I had no trouble with these coming out of the muffin cups, but my potatoes did not come out crispy, and they just don't have enough flavor for our tastes.  I'll try them again, but this time I'll crumbled tater tots or hash brown cakes, and I'll cook the pepper (adding more pepper) with some onion before adding to the eggs and omit the green onions.  These would also be a great place to add all sorts of veggies, and I'll definitely do that next time, too.  Once I tweak these to our tastes, they will be a great prepare ahead breakfast that I can just keep in the fridge.

I used the type of hash browns I had on hand---Ore-Ida's that are cubed rather than grated.  That made it hard to form the cups, and then they were very hard to get whole from the muffin pan even though I greased it heavily.  I used a mixture of three Johnsonville products---All Natural Mild Ground, All Natural Hot Ground, and Three-Cheese Italian Sausage (all of which are MSG-free, I must add).  These were good---not great---but good.  Be sure not to overbake these because they get rubbery otherwise.  I'll try these again when I have the correct hash browns.  I loved the sausage mix!  Thanks, Johnsonville!  EDIT 4/6/14  I made more of these today.  I cut down the recipe to 4 servings (just hubby and me), and I got 5 perfect muffins!  I used Mild Italian Ground Sausage (no MSG) and cut the cheese down a little but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'm changing my review to 5 stars because I think using shredded hash browns (Ore-Ida) makes all the difference in the world.  I greased my muffin tins and they just came out beautifully!  I hope the little girls in my life will like these, but I can always tailor these to fit their desires--that's the beauty of recipes like this!  Yummy!  Thanks, Johnsonville!

A tasty, handy, savory breakfast bite, this recipe is easy to tweak to your tastes or ingredients on hand.  I used Ore-Ida Frozen Hash Browns, 5 large eggs and one cup of cheese.  I have fresh chives, but if you don't have any on hand, saute some onion as you brown the sausage.  Honestly, I don't think the amounts specified in the recipe would fit my muffin tin.  I liked the use of hashbrowns instead of a pastry crust.  Though it's a little complex for my busy mornings, it would be a nice touch for a brunch with friends, or for a late breakfast on a lazy weekend.  Made this a second time today, April 12, 2014, subbing 2 Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage Links, browned and crumbled, 2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese and 5 eggs.  I left out the butter, salt and pepper, and found there to be enough fat and seasoning for our tastes.  Very tasty!

These were great, i think i should have left my hash browns in the oven a little longer, they werent as crunchy as I wanted them to be, maybe its my oven. I have tried these with real potatoes and I like them much better with the Ore-Idea.

I made several changes with this recipe based on what I had on hand, specifically Johnsonville Italian sausage and Ore-Ida cubed hash browns. I just didn't think the cubes would make that outer crust in the muffin cups, so I cooked the sausage in a black skillet and then added the thawed hash browns and extra orange bell pepper. Then I mixed together my eggs, poured them over the sausage mixture, and sprinkled with chives. I baked the skillet in the oven until a toothpick came out clean. After it had been in the oven a while, I realized I had completely forgotten the cheese, so I just added it on top at the end, and it worked out great. This was a delicious dinner served with a salad, and I'll probably make it the same way again just because it's one-pan easy! ***UPDATE 4-15-14 I finally made this recipe as written - in muffin form. I still like it.  This time I served the muffins with grits and orange slices. Delicious for breakfast or dinner!

Changed this quite a bit to adapt to what I had on hand.  I used thawed and crumbled tator tots for the base, omitted the butter and salt and pepper (didn't need it, enough oil and seasoning from the tots) and made the whole thing in a 10" cast iron skillet in the oven.  To the eggs, I added red onion, green pepper and mushrooms that I sauted in the same pan as the sausages to get them soft.  Only used about a cup of reduced fat cheese.   Baked until it was set, about 25-30 minutes.
It was delicious, and I would definitely make it again.  It's an easy one to "make your own" by adding whatever veggies you like.  The sausage seasons the whole thing perfectly. UPDATE:  I remade this recipe using a muffin tin and stayed closer to the original recipe.  To keep calories down, I did reduce the amount of sausage in the recipe by about half, used half whole eggs, half egg beaters, increased the amount of peppers to 1/2 cup finely diced red and orange, and used only 1/2 cup reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese.  Delicious.  I plan to put some of these "muffins" into the freezer for easy weekday breakfasts!  Thanks!  Great recipe!!

Simply delicious and so easy to prepare!!!  I used diced mushrooms instead of red pepper.  We love this dish for breakfast!  Revised:  I made this again using roasted red peppers...OMG, just when I thought it could not get any better, AMAZING!  This recipe truly lives up to it's name!

I just made these to take to work tomorrow. My son asked me to put one aside for him for breakfast tomorrow after he saw them through the oven door.  Well, he couldn't wait until morning and thought they were delicious!  I made them exactly as the recipe stated - no sticking. It seemed like a lot of cheese but turned out perfect. Will try bacon the next time.

Delicious!!! I used half the amount of sausage and added chili powder, garlic powder, tomatoes and onions. I bet spinach would be great too. I also sprinkled parsley for some color. I put them in Ziploc bags and in the freezer so we can pop them in the microwave any morning. Can't wait to make them for the whole family during the holidays!

These were good, everyone really liked them.  I did make some substitutions, I subbed bacon for the sausage and moitted the pepper.  There is a another recipe on this site called egg and cheese puffs that uses cottage cheese in the recipe, cottage cheese would have been good in this too.  (And I hate cottage cheese in everything else, but it works when baked).  My advice would be to cook the hashbrowns longer, and maybe broil them for a minute at the end, mine took a long time to cook and they never really looked crispy and brown.  GThey still tasted good though.

Super easy and excellent premade breakfast on the run! I did not grease the muffin tin - between the oil from the cheese and the grease from the sausage there was enough already. I skipped the onions due to an allergy but otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out excellent!  I want to add jalapeños next time to spice it up a little.

I loved it! First, I cut 5" squares from parchment paper to line muffin tin. Then, I substituted jalapenos in a jar for the peppers, bacon for the sausage, and Simply Potatoes southwestern hashbrowns for the crust. Delicious!

The hash browns I picked up at the grocery store were the chunky cubes so I just put them in the bottom of a casserole dish instead of the muffin tins. It worked great and everyone loved it.

Awesome and great  and make wonderful leftovers.  I did use Simply Potatoes  Southwest Hash Browns.  Awesome flavor.  The only issue I had was they stuck in the muffin tin, however, do have a few old non-stick pan which might have been the problem.  Will make again for sure in my new muffin pan!  So versatile.

I was looking for something that I could make on the week-end, freeze then bring to work for breakfast and this worked very well. I did make some changes for subsequent batches:  I bought a bigger muffin pan & mashed fresh potatoes with some cheese and lined the cups with them.  I followed the recipe after that, including browning the potatoes.  This worked best for me & they are wonderful!  I freeze them in individual baggies, then keep them in a freezer bag to grab & go.  Bacon & plain cheese works well, too.  Wicked good recipe!

These were good.  I made them exactly as the recipe said.  I will make them again but I will make some changes.  For my liking they need more seasoning.  I did have problems getting them out of the greased non stick tins.  Once they were a bit cooler they came out easier.  Since we want to eat them hot I may make some alterations to assure they come out when they are still hot.  I am going to try the tater tots instead of the hash browns.

These were really good.  I was nervous about how the potato cup would turn out, but it was great.  I didn't get to use the Johnsonville product but substituted another meat.  These are good reheated in foil before school!!

I could not find my cupcake pans so I just did this in a regular casserole dish and it turned out just as well and took less time :)  This was very good!  I used just regular ground sausage because that is what I had in my fridge and I think I will continue to use ground sausage instead.

My family loved them.  Easy to make.  I personally didn't care for the hash browns in them but that is just me - hash browns aren't my favorite.  Next time I'll try it without and with more egg just to play around with it.  I loved having a muffin cup - perfect for reheating on mornings when you're running out the door.

The hashbrowns didn't crisp and the muffins were impossible to extract in one piece. The flavor was fine, but I've certainly had better sausage/egg muffins.

These were easy and delicious. Greased pans with bacon grease. I used 5 pieces bacon cut up and fried till crisp instead of the sausage.(didn't have) Added some parsley, precooked tater tots and squished them in the bottom of the cups, pouring the egg mixture over top.Came out with no sticking. Perfect proportions. Thank you!

Wow, these were amazing.  I used sausage patties because it's what I had, cut the cheese back to 1 cup and added diced onion.  Cooked the onions and peppers to soften.  I also added an additional egg since I was using less cheese.  Cooled for about 5 minutes and they popped right out of the pan.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made recipe as stated (except half the cheese as others recommended).  I did encounter a couple of problems.  First, the hash browns stuck to my fingers, so it was hard to push them into a cup shape.  I tried spraying my fingers and, also, tried using a cup to smoosh the hash browns up the side, but they kept sticking.  Maybe it was the brand of hash browns.  If anyone has a good tip I would love to hear it.  Second, even after greasing my nonstick muffin tin, the egg muffins still stuck.  That being said, we did enjoy the flavor and I am loving having them on hand for a quick breakfast for my teenage son.  Next time, I may add some herbs/spices for some variety  (and a different brand of hash brown!).

This was delicious and very easy to make.  We added tomatoes after it baked and served with salsa.  This would be great with crumbled bacon or siced ham.  Nexy time I think I l’ll try jalapeños too.  This is a really great recipe! Thanks for sharing.  It got eaten so quick, I have no picture to share????

Adorable and delectable.    Hash browns took about 16 minutes to brown.    Grease tin well and these will come out without a hitch.     I am going to cool and then freeze for quick breakfast/snack options.

Excellent! I read another review and used 8 eggs. My picky husband loved them! Since I didn’t use a muffin tin, next time I’ll add a few more potatoes.

The only change I made was to use bulk sausage rather than the link sausage and cooked a bit of onion with it. Will definitely make these again.  The only further changes I'll make is to make sure that the hash browns get good and crisp before adding the filling.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe. First of all instead of the sausage links, I used Chorizo. I left out the peppers and only used 1 1/2 cups of cheese and used 8 eggs.  I also didn't use the muffin tins but put it in a glass 9 x 13 cake dish. Everyone just loved it and said it was a repeater. The only thing that I didn't think came out right, was the hash browns and that could be that I used a big cake dish instead of the muffin tins. The hash browns didn't crisp up as much as I expected, and I even baked them longer, I think a total of 27 minutes. So, I will have to play with that timing, Definitely a repeater though.

No changes, made to the recipe and I will definitely make them again.

Hint: I tried to skip greasing my muffin baker because it is clay and often do not need to grease it but in this case you need the greased cup.

Tasty...I added some more seasoning for my personal taste.  I had a small issue getting them out of the muffin tins which I did spray first.  My tins aren't new, but not that old either.  I will make them again...so many possibilities!

Made this recipe but changed a few things. I used grated potatoes and bacon instead of sausages because I didn’t have any. I also don’t like too much cheese so I just sprinkles a bit of cheese on top. It turned out great. Still good the next day warmed up.

I used mushrooms and baby spinach, simply because that's what I had on hand and had to use hash brown patties, because my market was out of the Simply Fresh potatoes and I did not want to thaw a whole bag of regular hash browns. I also had to use cupcake liners because of my sketchy muffin tin. They turned out awesome anyway. You would really have to try hard to screw this up. There are lot's of idea options, just use your imagination. Two in the microwave makes a perfect quick out the door breakfast for a single old lady.

OK, first the easiest method to do this is use pre-cooked sausage and then when the cups are prebaked there is no need to have the egg and cheese mixed a bowl. Just sprinkle in your cheese and if desired bell pepper then fill the cups with the egg

Saves a step and a bowl to clean..

We used both pre-cooked turkey sausage and egg beaters to save some calories.

My daughter got the whole family hooked on these a few years ago.  She made 3 batches (sausage, ham, and bacon) and after baking put them in warm slow cookers and brought to a potluck.  Potato stayed crisp - fantastic flavors - and just the right size to try each flavor ;)

This was an amazingly simple recipe. The cooking time was right on, and I loved that the hash brown "cups" were brown and crispy but not overcooked. The eggs were a perfect consistency and completely done the first time I pulled them out of the oven.I didn't like the proportions listed in the recipe. Even after filling all 12 cups, I had plenty of leftover sausage and cheese. Next time I will probably cut those ingredients in half. I might also add just a little more hash brown. Not a negative, but more of a personal preference. And THE BEST thing about this recipe? Not only did both of my boys ages 8 and 12 eat really well, they both asked for seconds! This will be put into our family dinner rotation. Thanks for a great recipe.

Everyone loved these breakfast muffins. I’m rating this recipe 4 stars because it was hard to get the “muffins” out of the muffin tins. I will try these again, using muffin liners.  I also added a 1/4 cup of canned diced green chilies, which increased the flavor with these.

I made these for a Mother’s Day breakfast at my daughter’s elementary school with bacon instead of sausage and a little less cheese (with some being left vegetarian).  The taste was very good but they stuck terribly to my pans, despite generous greasing, which kind of defeats the idea of the cute individual servings.  They are also a lot of work. If I try again, I will only do so with silicon muffin cups and double greasing (before & after the potatoes bake) or doing the whole recipe in a casserole dish instead.

I have made these many times now with a few variations.  I've used mild Italian sausage, ham, or bacon.  I've made them 3 years in a row for our Easter brunch at church, and they're always gone in less than 10 min!  I can't make enough of them!  They are so delicious!  This year, I was in a hurry and forgot to bake the potatoes prior to adding the eggs and meat. They still turned out perfect!  If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I'd give it at least 10!

So I used this recipe but I changed it a little bit! I switched the sausage for ground turkey, and I added chopped jalapeño and spinach. They came out so amazing! They were so good! And they are perfect for meal prep! I will definitely make these again just because they are so easy to make and just really helpful to get through the week!

I made this as written and sprayed my nonstick muffin pan generously with Pam and the hash browns still stuck.  The pan was a huge pain to clean!   The muffins tasted delicious though.  I made them again with paper liners which I sprayed with Pam - they stuck again!   I then made them again - a healthier version without the hash browns.  I sprayed the muffin pan with Pam and did not use the paper liners.  They did NOT stick.  I will continue to make them without the hash browns as it is healthier like that anyway (although I know, nowhere near as delicious!)

This was a huge hit with everyone at Elk camp!  After making AS DIRECTED, I froze them. Then just tossed them in the microwave (defrost for a minute, or so, then cook a minute or so).  It was a wonderful, tasty and filling breakfast snack before the early morning hunt.  Next time I will have to take more. This will be a regular in our house and Elk camp!

i made no ingredient changes.  To make a 'cup' I did press the hashbrowns into the muffin cup bottom and sides with the bottom of a small juice glass before baking, and extended bake time for that step by 2 min.  perfect and delicious.  
I wouldn't make if I had crowd -- a bit too much assembly time.  Better for 4 -6.

The bomb!!!!!!  I but I had to improvise due to not having all ingredients. .  I defrosted about 36+ tater tots.  I put them in the micro for about :30 sec.  then mashed them with my hands so they looked like hash browns.  I added the butter and cooked them like the recipe says.
I had about 1/4 Portuguese Sausage and some leftover ham.  No cooking meat necessary!  I missed in 1 green onion with the meat.  Then followed the recipe as is.  Wow!  these are awesome, simple and I'd definitely make them again!!!!

These turned out okay. I made a slightly larger batcheck and skipped the peppers for my crew. The potatoes stuck to the bottom a bit. I did grease the tin.  Next time I'll cook them longer to see they crisp up better and come out of the tin nicer.  They do taste good and I will make again.

I don't know what other people's muffin tins look like, but the ingredients were all wrong for mine.  I didn't have enough potatoes to go up the sides but there was WAY too much sausage to use in 12 cups.  These are tasty, but way more trouble than they are worth.

Great way to build a terrific breakfast!  I made it exactly as called for and managed my cook times to ensure the hash browns were browned and then again that the eggs were set and browned just slightly.  The directions for the recipe were clear and the ingredients were perfectly distributed between the 12 muffin cups.  We loved this, thank you Johnsonville!

We enjoyed how these turned out! I had a stone muffin (tin) from pampered chef. I cooked 4 batches and enjoyed my hash browns being more cooked so I left them in for 20 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. Also made some without cheese and they turned out great!

I love these, only changes I made was used turkey sausage and reduced fat cheese. I did use less cheese than called for, I feel the amount in the recipe would be to much for my liking. They are so good a little splash of tabasco, salt, and pepper, yum! There is so much you can do with this to make it how you like. Thank you for a great recipe!

They also heat up great in the micro.

Had to mix this the evening before. The hash browns went into the muffin tin and the cheese/eggs mix was combined and also stored in the fridge overnight.
The hash browns were cooked longer so they browned but cooked the final time for only 12 minutes.
The brunch was with strangers so I left out the meat on 3 of the muffins for any vegetarians and added a chunk of sausage link on top of the other 9 muffins to tell the difference later.
All 12 (yeah, I ate one at home, so 11) were snapped up and everyone had compliments. Made some new friends!

I used rehydrated dehydrated shredded potatoes, and had to use mushroom instead of bell pepper because I was out. I also didn't have any fresh onion, and I used cooked till crisp, drained and torn up bacon,  instead of sausage.  

My hashbrowns never really browned, I cooked them an extra 8 minutes but the edges started to get too crispy so I continued on with the recipe. I was even using less than the recipe called for. When done cooking, the hashbrowns still weren't super browned, stuck to the pan and fell apart upon removal. I added salsa and sour cream and, besides being a big mess on the plate, they tasted delicious.

I added 4 minutes of Broil time. That helped crisp them up a bit before adding the egg mix.  I added 1/4 cup of chopped mushrooms to the egg blend and reserved the bell pepper and chives for just a few cups since our kids don't like them (but love mushrooms). I served the cups with salsa and sour cream condiments. Very tasty. Buttered toast on the side. It occurred to me later that a side of fruit would have completed the  plating.  Everyone enjoyed this dish and will  keep as a favorite.

Turned out fine, shared it with others (both the recipe and the muffins).  I agree -- they tasted very good, but the frozen hash browns didn't brown/crisp very well for me.  Still, overall result was tasty - will repeat, but maybe shred my own fresh potatoes.

Really, really good. Like others had to make some adjustment for what I had on hand. Did not have shredded hash browns so used regular cubed hash browns and chopped them up to the consistency of shredded. Used bacon instead of sausage, Shredded some old cheddar and parmigiana  reggiano, and put some in the egg mixture and some on top. Ended up a little salty perhaps because of the salt in the cheese and bacon. Will adjust salt next time. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe and they turned out ok, probably a little rich for my liking.  The potatoes never got crisp which is disappointing.   I like the idea of using muffin tins  for portion control and easy to have as leftovers but will try some other recipes with less cheese.

I made it exactly as the recipe is listed and we loved them!  A single one initially feels like it's not enough, but after 10 minutes it was filling and lasted until lunch no problem.  Easy to make, store in freezer, grab and zap when needed.  Keeper!

Used hash browns with peppers and onions mix instead of adding 
Also put 1 cup cheese in the mix and sprinkled the last cup over the muffins the last couple mins of baking! Yum; cheesy!

Great recipe.  A couple of tweaks for my family.  Added a bit of onion powder to both egg and used seasoned tater tots mashed with a fork for the hashbrowns (essentially the same thing).  My family likes chopped shaved deli turkey in most breakfast egg dishes, so I added this as well.  I accidentally placed the eggs on the "hashbrowns" before baking and almost panicked.  Instead I put them in for 20-25 minutes.  They still turned out amazing!  My son and toddler daughter demolished them and quickly asked for seconds.  Great recipe and will make again.

My changes. 
One whole bag of shredded frozen hash browns. Sautéed with 1 half chopped yellow onion and 1/4 cup butter until just thawed. Seasoned with salt and pepper and a pinch of garlic powder
Baked potato (bowls) for 15 minutes at 400.
Chopped pack of Canadian bacon put over potatoes then filled each cup with egg mixture. Only used about 3/4 cup of cheese mixed in with egg. No veggies simply because I had none and these are pretty good with just the protein. Not much salt needed at all. 
Baked 15mins at 400.  
One bag of potatoes made enough for 24muffins(2 recipes)     Set them in cupcake liners and froze. 
Delicious.

Made these for part of a Christmas brunch and served with salsa.  I baked the potato cups longer than recipe called for the night before and then finished with the filling in the morning.

My family loved it,  I couldn't find my muffin tin so I  just used my mini muffin tin. I followed the directions but--- Because of space constraints I only used sausage and cheese for toppings on half and cheese on other half (we have vegetarians in the house).  I cut up the 4 links of sausage to tiny pieces. Spread hasbrowns between  24 mini muffin cups ( 1 poured approx. 2 Tbsp of egg mixture over each hasbrown) and watched closely to make sure not overcooked. I used a spoon to loosen right as the came out of the oven. They came out pop in your mouth perfect. (actually about 2-3 bites each) looked nice too. now i need to figure out how to keep warm on buffet line for  family brunch gatherings. Thanks for a great recipe.

Good flavor! I cooked the veggies and added Mrs. Dash seasoning to suit our taste. I also grated fresh potatoes.  I will experiment with this a bit the next time I make this recipe as the potatoes stuck to the over sized greased muffin tins. Thank you for sharing the recipe! Very good!

My kids loved them! I used the base of a small glass to push the hash browns into the muffin tins  - much easier than using a spoon.  I only had hash brown patties, I defrosted them and crushed them up in a bowl. :)

I used real shredded potato since I didn't have frozen. I found that it took a lot longer to brown (crisp) I had to bake the potato shell for about 10-12 minutes longer to get it crispy.  I also used half the amount of cheese and I used bacon instead of sausage since I didn't have sausage.   Otherwise it turned out very nice.  Looked good and tasted yummy!

Took these to a breakfast tailgate and they were a big hit!  Warmed them in a covered foil pan on a BBQ grill on low.  Perfect!
My only substitution was cubed ham to save a cooking step.  I used foil baking cups inside the muffin cups and sprayed those with cooking spray before adding the hash brown mixture.  (I found that 2 Tablespoons of hash browns was a perfect amount per muffin cup).  Also sprayed tops of hash browns before baking.  I had to double the number of eggs because 6 did not make enough to fill 12 muffin cups.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of season salt to the 12 beaten eggs.  I did not mix the red pepper and cheese with the eggs, but added them individually to each muffin cup to assure an equal amount in each and then carefully ladled in the egg mixture.  Each cup was almost full.  The chopped green onions sprinkled on top are colorful and add great flavor.  Baked as instructed.  Will definitely be making these again.

Honestly, the only alterations I made were, I used bacon in place of sausage. I cooked the bacon in the oven and chopped it into pieces.  And, I added onion powder.  Lastly, I mixed everything together and stuffed it all in the muffin tin and baked for 30 minutes.  Came out perfect.  No need to cook for 12min then add more and  cook for another 13min.  I do a similar recipe that calls for most of the same ingredients and I mix it all up and throw it into a 9x13 casserole dish and cook for 30minutes @ 425.  It's always a hit and now, this is as well!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Love love love these! I add a package of spinach (thawed out in the microwave and squeeze out the excess water) instead of peppers. Also added some onion. Used a 16 ounce carton of egg substitute instead of the 6 eggs. I also used a blended three cheese. One of my favorite breakfast recipes!

This recipe is a keeper. If you have silicone cupcake molds definitely use them, they'll slip right out. Those I put directly in the muffin tins stuck a bit and took work to get out despite generously greasing.

I was short on ingredients, (only 4 eggs, 6 sausages, and no peppers, so I could only make 6.  I found them pretty greasy, and probably not overly healthy, but my son loved them, so I will make them again :)

I subbed vegetarian soy sausage for the sausage links and grated my own potatoes instead of using frozen hash browns.  I had to cook the potatoes about 10 minutes longer to get them brown and they could have used another 5 minutes I think.  It tasted Amazing though!  I wish I would have used more pepper and next time I will add chopped onions.

I made these and they came out pretty good. I personally did not eat a whole one, but I did sample a piece and it was o.k. Most of the kids loved it and my husband said they were good.  So in all, I would only make these for something special, or to have fun with the kids. Otherwise, I’d stick to making an omelet, as I felt it took more prep time than it was worth.

Also, I am not a big cheddar cheese person, so I would skip the cheese in the mixture and lay a piece of processed American cheese (you know…fake cheese) on top.

These were ok. They were tasty and maybe I screwed up cooking them but I followed the directions. They look good but my hash brown cups seemed smaller than should be. They were indeed tasty though. Great and quick way to get all of your breakfast foods in one spot on the go!

The Johnsonville breakfast sausage is so delicious! Flavor is great. There are a few too many steps in the recipe but it's worth it. I reduced the amount of cheese by half so that the muffin cups would not overflow.

This was a hit for the whole family at Easter Brunch.  The only adjustments that I made were to use an entire red pepper, and 1/2 the cheese.   Next time I will use paper liners in the muffin tin, it was tough to clean out without them.

These were delicious and I didn't have any trouble with them sticking to the pan. I did cook the potatoes a little longer; as recommended by some reviews I read. I did not have red bell pepper so used green. Use your creativity with ingredients your family loves. This recipe has many options/possibilities. These reheated well. I plan on making some ahead for those days when someone needs breakfast-on-the-go.

Great recipe! I didn't change a thing but had to cook my hash browns a little longer to get them crisp. Great breakfast idea and perfect for any time! I used the Maple Johnsonville breakfast links and they add so much flavor to the eggs and potatoes! This one is a definite keeper.

This is very tasty. Made it for bunch it was a hit. I left out the peppers because I didn't have any on hand. I chopped broccoli and added that. I also added ham cubes. Definitely will make again.

This was a big hit in my house!  I made exactly as the recipe stated, but, used freshly grated potatoes that I rinsed and dried well instead of frozen hash browns.  Mine took closer to 18 minutes to cook, but, were moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I did spray my muffin tin with a little cooking spray because I was afraid they would stick.  This would be wonderful to make for a crowd.  I would cook the sausage the night before so that step was done and double the recipe to make 24.  Thanks for the recipe, Johnsonville!

Followed the recipe to a tee, albeit I used Johnsonville's MAPLE flavored breakfast sausage (my family's favorite).
A nice and easy hearty breakfast.

This recipe was great! I used bacon instead of sausage, diced potatoes instead of hash browns, and green onion instead of peppers as that's all I had on hand, and it came out marvelous. The only thing I would change is adding more eggs and less potato, creating more of an even ratio, but that's just because I love eggs so much.

We liked these muffins but for our taste we needed to add sriracha sauce to them to spice them up.  The muffin texture reminded me of quiche.  I think these are prefect for a quick breakfast before school or a luncheon.

I made these per the recipe and they were good.  So I got easier and vegetarian for our daughter's family.  Usedsed "O'Brian potatoes, and added soy chirozo.  Prefer sharp cheddar and using a little less cheese for calorie savings. Nice served warm or cold, so good for a brunch party.

These were a big hit in my house.  Although, I can't get my almost 2 year old to try anything these days.  I would probably make them again on a weekend for breakfast.  We ate them as a dinner.  Very easy.

These were very good! I do have to agree w/ those that said the hash browns didn't crisp up enough, and also some of mine stuck a bit in the pan. The kids liked the sausage 'surprise' in the middle. All in all, these were simple to make and the family really enjoyed them! Thanks for sharing. :)

Such a great all-in-one breakfast cup!  Potatoes, cheese, sausage and egg all in one wonderful cup!  I will be making these again. (I added a little salt, pepper and onion powder to the egg mixture, along with about 1 T. half & half to make the filling a little less bland.)

If the hash browns have not started to crisp at the bottom before putting the egg mixture in, I suggest letting it have a longer baking time.  I altered the recipe to fit ingredients I had here, made my own hashbrowns by parboiling the potatoes then shredding them.  I added some chili powder and cumin the mixture since I didn't have Mexican flavored cheese.  No peppers except jalapeno so I used about 1 tablespoon of that and chopped tomato and tomatillo to stir in.  I also reduced the sausage to about half.  This is a great base recipe.  You can do so many different flavors.  It gets 5 stars for that purpose alone!

4/13/14 - I made these again today and left the Mexican flavors out. Sharp Cheddar, sauteed mushrooms and red peppers and chives for flavor.  AMAZING is the word.  :)

My husband loves breakfast sausage, so I wasn't surprised when my husband said, "I like these eggs, much better than scrambled eggs." I love the combination of eggs, sausage and cheese which made for a very flavorful breakfast.  What is great about these egg muffins is that I didn't have to make breakfast the next day.

Amazing! And fun to make! We took them with us to our hotel and they went in the refrigerator and reheated nicely in the microwave! I will also make these in bulk to freeze for fast lunches for the husband to take to work!
TIP: Mine had overfilled made as directed. Next time, I will save at least 1/3 of the sausage pieces for the top of the muffin cups for AFTER they are done baking. Then set them under the broiler for a few minutes to reheat the sausage. I would also choose to use fresh sweet potato hash browns. (Personal preference!) With those two changes, this would be a five star! Thank you Johnsonville!

These were delicious.  You can add or delete and make this your own which is great.  My only problem was with them sticking to a nonstick and very well sprayed muffin tin.  Will have to figure that problem out.  I used a mixture of cheeses that I had and, instead of sausages, I used pancetta.  I made half the recipe and will freeze the leftovers.

I would give this recipe 4 1/2 stars if I could. Brought these in for my co-workers this morning and they all raved about them! I wish the potatoes would have crisped up for me, but other than that they were easy to make, tasty and look super cute.

Delish! I made it according to the recipe and it was great. When I'm short on time, I use tater tots as someone else suggested, the refrigerated pre-cooked turkey or sausage pieces, and put it all in a casserole dish. Every variation I've tried has been yummy.

I would rate this a high 4. Very easy and delicious. I had a little problem getting the hashbrowns to come out but this didn't affect the taste. It was hard cleaning the pan so maybe I just need to try a better muffin pan. Made this as written.

Loved these muffins!  Made these for Christmas Day breakfast and all the family loved it!  Worked out great in the muffin pan cause some people are lactose intolerant others want onion and peppers so it was easy to make each for individual people.

Very good!  I used tater tots instead of hash browns, which I broke apart and ham instead of sausage...then I was running late so I mixed everything together, potatoes and all (but no butter), with one additional egg and only 1.5 cups of cheese.  Fast and easy!

Very tasty!!! The only thing I would suggest is mixing the egg and cheese together pouring over potatoes.  Then add any other ingredients to each cup.  This way it gets distributed evenly.

Great recipe I also made it adding only sharp cheddar cheese instead of Mexican blend and adding a 1/2 cup of cheddar to the hash brown mix and also tried using bacon instead of sausage both are great

Could someone tell me if the serving size is one regular muffin size or a mini muffin size?  Thank You.  I haven't tried them yet but I know in advance they will be a 5 star!

These were very easy to make and my family loved them. I used Ore-Ida hash brown potatoes and ground sausage rather than the breakfast sausage. I will be making these again!

better if everything is separated as a full breakfast. luke likes red bell pepper.
