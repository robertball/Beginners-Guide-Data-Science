I tried this recipe as I was looking for something quick and easy and quickly found that not having a binding agent meant batterless rings.  I ended up having to take the rings out of the flour mixture, dip them into a mixture I made of egg whites and milk and then put them back into the flour mixture in order to get the batter to stick.  Once I did that and fried them, they came out okay.

Using 2 beaten eggs with 1 Tlb. of milk beaten in as batter for the onion ring will help keep the flour on while frying. Dip well in egg mixture, place in lg. ziplock bag. Using *rice flour* will make anything you fry "crispier!" Frying with veg. oil is healthier too!

I think some people misunderstand what these are supposed to be like when they finish. They are not the battered or breaded type one commonly finds in restaurants. These are a much more delicate dish that was very popular in the Midwest in the '50s and '60s.

Made as written except that I subbed out 1/2 cup of the flour with cornmeal due to personal preference. On my first batch I was unable to get any of the breading to stick whatsoever making me feel like I was wasting all of the extra ingredients. So, on the second batch I soaked the rings in milk prior to breading them and this worked nicely. They were not completely coated but enough stuck to give them a nice crunch.  These were really good and I will definitely make again.
