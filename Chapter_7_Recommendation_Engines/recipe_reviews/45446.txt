This sauce is surprisingly very good with very little ingredients. In my country we make this sauce from scratch and it is a very tedious process. I am so happy to find this recipe. So close to the original. If you like it hot like me, you can add sambal oelek (hot red chili sauce)or red chili flakes.Yumm!

I have searched for this recipe forever and here it is!Beautiful. Only problem I had was that I only had access to non-natural skippy type peanut butter,so when I boiled the ingredients, the oil separated from the rest of the mix. I needed to whisk the oil back in, as no amount of spoon stiring helped. I don't know if anyone else had this problem when using natural peanut butter.I also plan on using the leftovers to make a cold thai pasta salad that has penne, apple chunks, ginger(already in satay sauce), chicken chunks, green onions and small bits of brocoli just like I used to buy at my favorite cafe diner.

This was thicker than my usual satay sauce, but had a good flavor.  I love coconut milk and am always looking for ways to experiment with it.  I tossed this with pad thai noodles and rather than chunky peanut butter, I used the creamy kind and ground up my own peanuts to sprinkle on top.  Thanks Steve.

This is the most authentic peanut sauce if you are looking for what is similar to those found in restaurants...it is made with coconut milk.  If the recipe is too bland for your taste, increase the heat with a hot sauce, cayenne, more red pepper flakes or whatever you want.  I put lots of ginger in mine.  I don't even measure how much.  I estimate a tablespoon or more.  If the recipe is not peanutty enough, add more peanut butter.  As long as it has the coconut milk and the peanut butter it is an extremely flexible recipe.  In addition to lots of ginger, this recipe is served well by generous garlic as well.  I serve this over chicken skewers marinated in an improvised teriyaki sauce with the red chili sauce (not rooster sauce) with rice and edamame.  A perfect, easy and reliable meal.

I'd give it no stars if I could.  It was gross.  It tasted like the grossest peanut butter you could imagine.  I'm a really good cook, and I followed the recipe to a tee.  I dunno what everyone else is talking about.  This recipe is NOT good.

Excellent both in taste and in ease of preparation. Versitile recipe -- my husband had his on chicken, I had mine on tofu. Good with snow peas and other crunchy vegetables. I also have added ground ginger (1 tbsp or so) and a tsp or so of garlic chili paste. I think this latter could be increased, if you like spice. Really great recipe -- I won't be looking for another one.

Thanks Steve - This was so easy to make and produced the best Satay we have had at home! Actually there is only one Thai shop we have had a better Satay at.
Out of habbit I fried the onion with some garlic before adding other ingredients (doubled the recipe with success) and because I had no red pepper flakes, I just used the Cayenne Pepper Powder (not fond of hot spices, so used limited quantity).
We stirred cooked chicken in sauce and left it to marinate. It reheated successfully and we served it over rice. Thanks again - I will use this recipe again and again!

This turned out well. I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used Sriracha brand hot chili sauce. (Many Asian groceries sell this sauce.)

I'd recommend less brown sugar than the recipe lists. The peanut butter and the coconut milk make it sweet enough.

This is a good base for satay sauce just a little bit boring. I added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander, 3cloves of garlic, a tbsp of ginger, half a tsp of sambal oelek and added some brown sugar (to taste),  to make this a lot more adventurous and spicier.

I used cream of coconut instead of coconut juice, and it came out thick and very tasty. Definitely a keeper!

In a desperate attempt to make this a little healthier, I used a lower-fat coconut milk. Wouldn't cut that corner again.Be sure to use higher-fat coconut milk. It makes a HUGE difference.

I felt this recipe to be too bland.  I added some cumin and Chinese 5 Spice Blend to it to give it a "more than peanut butter" taste.

My husband was born in The Netherlands and Indonesian food is really popular over there. This recipe tastes JUST like the Satay sauce his mother buys in there grocery stores. We give it thumbs up all around. We have used it for the family and for entertaining. Didn't change a thing.

This was so goooooood.  I used 13 oz of coconut milk instead of the 10 oz can.  I baked a couple of chicken breasts in the oven and cubed and put into the sauce.  I garnished it with chopped green onions and served it over jasmine rice.  I would make this again in a heart beat.  I am going to use the leftovers tomorrow and put it over linguine noodles.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I added about a teaspoon of garlic and used about a 2 1/2 teaspoons of cayenne powder (I didn't have any flakes, and I am a hot-food freak). Also, I used a 14 ounce can of coconut milk.

This turned out very nice! I'm curious to try it out as a marinade (and may up my rating later, if I can!).

Pretty disappointing.  Very bland, really just tasted like peanut butter with some spices in it.  I love peanut/satay sauce, but I'll keep looking for a recipe to use at home.

I needed peanut satay sauce for a recipe I found in a magazine.  The grocery store I went to did not have it so I turned to allrecipes for the answer.  The recipe in the magazine called for 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice and I ended up using the entire 13 oz can of coconut milk.  It turned out delicious!!!!

My family and I lived in Malaysia and ate local food everyday.  This recipe is great and in my opinion is even better than what we got when we ate satay at the local food stalls.

I used this recipe instead of a more traditional one because I ran out of fish sauce and this uses soy sauce.  This recipe is excellent and so easy.  I did add 2 tsps of red curry paste and more red pepper than called for.  Without these additions it might have been a bit bland.  Great recipe!

This is a really good, quick, & easy sauce.  I added a bit more peanut butter and left out the brown sugar completely.  I had missed the sugar when making this originally and then decided it was great with out it.  I also added garlic, and chili paste.  I tend to like a more savory peanut sauce. 

I grilled chicken skewers using this as a basting sauce, and then alongside as a dipping sauce.  The next day, I took the leftover sauce and made a meal out of it by adding some leftover linguine noodles and cut up chicken.  I warmed this up, tossed it with the sauce and added bean sprouts, some leftover veggies, and some green onions to the top.  It was yummy!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried chicken satay in NYC and have been hankering for the version I had there ever since.  This is exactly it and I'd certainly use it again.  I really don't care much for peanut butter but I made an exception for this and I used plain peanut butter.  Worked out great, I MIGHT thin it a little next time but that's just me.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was pretty good. Definitely not as thick as I was expecting, and I had to add some garlic and a couple dashes of curry powder to really liven up the flavour--but a good base to start with.

I have never had satay or any thai cooking.  this looked so easy I thought I would give it a try.  It was GREAT!  Of course I have nothing to compare to, but reading the other reviews I think I picked a good place to start...

Love this more than the peanut satay sauce we get at various malasian, thai and vietnamese restaurants we've been to!  Great basic sauce... I just omitted the sugar, added more crushed red pepper as we like it spicy and for an even prettier presentation, topped w/ crushed peanuts.

This is a very simple sauce that reminds me of my trips to asia. As with others the peanut oil did separate from the sauce, I will try the natural peanut butter next time

This was the most delicious satay sauce I've tasted in a long time. It was so easy to make too. I added chopped chillis as I didn't have the flakes and it was yummy. I also used light soy sauce which was fine too. I will be using this recipe again soon!

I loved this sauce. It was perfect with chicken satay. I made Naan, and filled it with lettuce tomatoes, red onions, chicken satay and this sauce. It was great! I only made half of it because I didn't need a lot for two people. I ended up increasing the amount of red pepper flakes to make it spicier. Yumm!

Fast, easy and good. By accident I put a shot of ginger & poppy seeds in the finished product (noodles), and they produced a little extra depth. If I used Reduced Fat Skippy again for this, I would cut back on the brown sugar since RF Skippy is high in sugar.

Rich and delicious. Makes a lot of sauce. Use the correct ingredients for the best flavor. It is a little thick so add more coconut milk if you want it a thinner.

I liked this sauce, but my husband didn't.  He said he didn't care for the peanut butter taste in it... although I've made other chicken recipes with peanut butter and he really liked those.  I thought it was good.

Very yummy!  I made it with Kraft peanut butter and it didn't separate - I made turkey skewers and used a bit as a marinade and the rest as a dipping sauce.  My kids even ate it and they are soooooo fussy!

This is a fine receipt which I was resigned to discard because I have a peanut allergy (not the worst kind - just allergic rhinitis). But I substituted the peanuts with roasted edame, and to my surprise, nearly all of it was eaten.

Ever since I lived in Indonesia, it's been my personal mission to find a fantastic peanut sauce. The store bought ones don't cut it for me. But tonight I attempted my own (this recipe) and was pleasantly surprised! It wasn't quite what I wanted, but I was still satisfied. I didn't have coconut milk, so I used 1% (the strongest I have!). I also tossed in a sprinkling of taco seasoning instead of pepper flakes, and added a bit more brown sugar as it was too peanut-y. It went well with my satay and the family loved it!

The satay sauce turned out excellent, I did have to do a few variations: I added more peanut butter, and brown sugar and soy sauce.  It was a tad bit bland when I prepared as directed, so I just increased the amounts.  It was delicious and went perfect with our chicken satay.

I think this was too rich for my kids. They didn't like it, which surprised me since they love everything peanut butter. I added some garlic and ginger and used it with chicken tender pieces and then broiled. It made the chicken nice and moist.

A basic satay recipe.  I didn't find the peanut butter too overwhelming.  The coconut milk is definitely better than using regular milk.

Thought this was really good.  I only used about half the onion that was called for, because as I was adding it just seemed excessive.  I also did end up adding a little bit of raw crushed garlic before serving it...I just really felt that it needed a bite.

This vegan "Satay Sauce" tastes much better than I anticipated given the simplicity of the recipe; however, mine was thin (remedied with extra peanut butter).  I would add the coconut milk slowly next time to see how much I need. Also, I think ginger,  garlic, sesame oil, and sriracha would be good additions.  As the recipe is, it tastes exactly like the appetizer dip served with shrimp chips at a local Thai restaurant. For those of you who like to cook in metric, my 1/2 cup of all-natural peanut butter weighted 150 grams (not 130 grams as in the metric version of this recipe). Thank you SMTUNE for sharing your recipe.

I made it without the yellow onion but cut up green onions and sprinkled them on top of the sauce portions for each person. Huge difference and delish!!

Creamy and yummy, but a bit bland. Next time will add ginger, garlic, and hot sauce as suggested.

I added  2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro to it, and that made the sauce a bit more complex.  I would be careful bringing this to a boil. My sauce quickly burned on the bottom of my sauce pan.

Not bad, quick and simple to make, but needs a touch of lime juice to freshen and lighten it up a bit.
Otherwise, good!

Far too much peanut butter and not enough taste.  I tried salvaging it with more pepper flakes, garlic and even Frank's hot sauce, still tasted like melted peanut butter. Didn't work. Won't make again.

This recipe is great.  I use creamy peanut butter per my own tastes.  Half an onion minced can be overpowering depending on how its done, so be careful.    About 1TB minced seems good to me.  I also like double or more of the red pepper flakes.  I love to use this sauce on thai pizzas.

I just looked at the ingredients, and the amount was played by taste and look.  I used chunky peanut butter sauce, and the texture turned out really great with the finely chopped onion.  I also added minced garlic to bring out the flavor and fish sauce, it tasted more authentic.  
Next time, I will try adding either lemon, lime, or mined lemon grass.

I don't understand the review from 2006!  This is the best satay sauce I've ever tried. I looked for canned/bottled supermarket brands and was always disappointed. Desperate, I tried this and I had great difficulty not just sitting down with the saucepan and a spoon.  It's *THAT* good.  And it lasts for ages in the fridge.

I was doubtful because it wasn't brown like peanut butter, but it's very good. A little sweet too.

A very quick tasty peanut sauce.  My picky eater LOVES when I make this on chicken and rice.
