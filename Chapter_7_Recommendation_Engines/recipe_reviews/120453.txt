Enjoyed the flavor, but there wasn't enough of the topping to cover the biscuit dough.  Next time will double the mayo and cheese.

Used regular pizza dough and sauted the onions in the bacon grease to carmalize them. My whole family loved this.

I thought this was super good.  I made 2, a smaller one for my boys with colby since they don't like swiss, and one as is, but with pizza dough instead of biscuits.

I made this on pita bread so I could eat it today--I don't have refrigerated biscuit dough and didn't feel like making biscuits.  So I just spread the mix on the pita and baked until the cheese melted, about 10 minutes.  It's actually not a bad combo; I was worried about the mayo (not a mayo fan) but I just put enough mayo in the mixture to hold it together.  Somewhat rich, but works as a quick lunch for me, and I like the tomato bacon combo.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good but be forewarned: it is really rich. Both my husband and I could only eat one slice a piece. I did adjust the recipe a little, but only to make a larger pizza, essentially I doubled most of the ingredients. I will definitely make this again but probably stick to what the recipe states and make half as much as I made this time.

I made this as a main dish-great tasting.  Really different plus it was quick and easy.

While I am sure this is not a healthy recipe, everytime I've made it I have received rave reviews. It is delicious! I actually think it tastes better the next day after the topping have melted into the biscuit dough. I love the taste of the biscuit dough and would not want to substitute regular pizza crust. I do think adding a little extra cheese helps the recipe, and I skip the onions because I don't like them. I didn't have any basil, so I skipped that too. Overall, this was incredibly delicious!

Good starting point. I read through the reviews before I started this recipe, then I took it and ran with it. Thanks for the ideas--this was a great way to use a couple rolls of the reduced fat crescent roll dough I couponed for next to nothing and odds and ends from my fridge to make a kid-friendly dinner night sans Daddy.

I do not like onion on pizza, and I also can't handle pieces of cooked tomato so "juiced" the tomato and used like a sauce.  I really couldn't figure out why it needs full-fat mayo.  I always use Miracle Whip, and *never* have full-fat around, so there wasn't a lot of option other than buying a jar and wasting the rest.  I did have some packets of real mayo from restaurants, so I used that, and then filled in the other half with the low-fat Miracle Whip I have around.  It worked just fine, and if I made it again, I'd try using all low-fat Miracle Whip.  I couldn't taste it very well anyway.  I mostly tasted biscuit, bacon and Swiss.  I had no issues with using biscuits for this, so no it's not a "bad" idea - simply a personal preference.  I always have trouble getting dough things to pinch together, but fortunately it wasn't a huge deal as it just pulled apart when done into a few uneven pieces.  It was good, and a bit different, but not "great."  I certainly would make it again, whenever I allow myself to buy another package of bacon. :-)

Yum Yum Yum. My whole family really liked this. I cooked the onions with the bacon and added about a tbsp of minced garlic. It was so good. I served with a garden salad for a complete and tasty meal.

the biscuits are a BAD idea. Do the same toppings and use pizza dough - that tastes good. THIS does not.

Very tasty!  We made this for New Year's Eve.  I did omit the onions, but kept everything else the same.

These turned out really good, we did replace the swiss cheese with mozerella, just a personal preference.  Thanks for the post.
