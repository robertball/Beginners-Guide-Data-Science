Ok, here's what I did- and my husband loved it! I seasoned my flour with garlic powder and herb seasonings. Once I finished browning the chicken, I took all the chicken out. I then added 1/2 of a chopped onion, 4 cloves chopped garlic, and sauteed for 2-3 minutes. I then added 2 different types of mushrooms, shitake and button, all sliced (we like a lot of mushrooms).  After a couple of minutes, I added about a cup of white wine, and let that simmer to burn off any alcohol. Then, I added 1/2 and 1/2, and about a cup and 1/2 of chicken broth. At this point, I also added in the dijon mustard. To  make the sauce thicker (because I didn't use the heavy cream), I added a slurry to the sauce. I then poured the sauce on top of the chicken and put it in the oven on 350 for about 15 minutes. My husband said "We need to add this into the rotation!" YUM!

Measurements of ingredients is way off.  No way do you need 2 cups of flour for one chicken breast.  Perhaps 2 tbsp.  And 1/2 tbsp is not nearly enough butter.  Flavor is good. I used sour cream instead of cream and added about 2 tbsp dijon instead of 1 tbsp.

My husband just loves this one!  We usually make it with chanterelle or shitake mushrooms.  Sometimes we serve it over rice, other times just on its own.  It is a very easy and yummy recipe.

I gave this only 3 stars because the measurements are way off and don't translate well when you increase the amount of servings.  I increased the amount to 4 servings and it asked for 1/2 pound of green onions which is a lot of onions and a full 6 cups of heavy whipping cream which is way too much whipping cream. In fact all I used was a pint and I thought that was a little too much.  This is a delicious recipe, but not written for a beginner which is a shame because it is actually very easy to make, but only if you already know by looking at the recipe that the measurements are all wrong. Because of this I gave it a poor rating.

I gave this 2 stars because like some other reviewers have said, the measurements are way off. There is WAY too much cream! And I had to cook my chicken a lot longer for the mushrooms to be tender and the chicken to be done. I was not impressed and had to do a lot of changes to the recipe.

Very good recipe. I did take the tip and use a red pepper which really dressed the dish up. I also used a yellow onion because that is what I had on hand. After the chicken was done, I removed it from the pan and then sauteed the onion, mushrooms and red pepper in about 3 T butter. After I added the cream and mustard and let it simmer I poured it over the chicken breast.

Use 1 c. 1/2&1/2 plus 1.5 c chicken broth.  Add slurry (fat&flour) to thicken. Add chopped onion & garlic after sauteing the chicken 5 mins. Add white win, chicken broth and slurry to thicken instead of cream.

I have to give this four stars only because I did not follow the directions completely due to lack of some ingredients. I seasoned my flour with Thyme, Garlic, salt, pepper and Marjoram. I also did not have any green onions on had so used regular onions. For the sauce, I had made a veggie casserole and had a little of the filling left. So my sauce consisted of RF mushroom soup, sour cream from the casserole and mushrooms, onions,dijon mustard and chicken stock. This came out amazing. The taste was wonderful and I would have rated it five stars but like I said I just hadn't made it per the recipe. But I will be making it again and I will re-rate once I have all ingredients on hand. But I think if you are creative this is a great start and you can really play with it to suit your own taste. YUMMMMMMY!

The only thing missing from this recipe is flavor in the sauce.  I added sauted onion & garlic with a pinch of dry mustard and it was much better.

Very good, easy, and fast! I think it will become a "working late" staple in our house. I followed the recipes except the scallions- only had red onion on hand.

This is very good.  I made it like Marnie and added 1 cup chicken broth and more flour to make a gravy.  Chopped up the chicken in bite size pieces and spooned over puff pastry shells.  Sprinkled with chopped fresh chives.

Quick and easy! For one serving, I used 1/2 cup half and half and 2 tbsp mustard but I guess it depends on the strength of the brand you're using. For an even quicker meal, use canned mushrooms!

Previous reviewer was correct -- Two cups of flour is outrageous. Just eyeball it. Beyond that, this is a classic recipe. Very good with a bottle of Merlot. I had made a pork dish using a similar recipe and threw a chicken breast in the pan when my daughter requested it. Very good.  Simple.

Lovely recipe for a quick meal that feels special. I added chardonnay before the cream and reduced that, I also added fullgrain mustard and honey. Was delicious. Pounding the breast made it more tender and it went further.

I loved this recipe because its simple and fast. I cooked it for supper for my husband and I one evening and the next night our church had a covered dish supper. SO rushing home from work I thought hummm....I'm gonna try something different. I didn't use chicken at all. I cooked 2c of rice in my rice cooker, put 2tblsp of butter in my sauté pan, added the mushrooms and onions, salt, pepper and garlic powder, cooked it down and then added 2c of heavy cream with 3tblsp of Dijon mustard. When the rice was finished I added it to the sauté pan and mixed it in the sauce. It was a HIT at church. Everyone wanted the recipe. Its definitely one of my new favorites!

It was very good but I tweaked it a bit. I removed the chickento a seperate dish and then fried 4 strips of bacon which I added with the green onion garnish later. After removing the bacon I used the bacon drippings in the pan to fry the mushrooms, then addes 1 cup of sour cream diluted with 1/2 a cup milk and added the mustard.

I found this a delicious recipe - made a few adjustments - I did pound the chicken breast, dried it off and just lightly dredged it with flour (so likely used 1/2 tbsp flour). I used Crimini mushrooms (which I find hold their shape and seem to give off less water in cooking), about 1 tbsp of green onion, 1/2 cup of 3.5% milk and 1 tsp of Dijon mustard. I didn't boil it, but brought the 'sauce' just below a boil. Tasty indeed.

I thought this recipe was very good but I did have a few changes. I didn't cut the chicken in half or pound it down. Instead I took the chicken out of the package and seasoned it with powder and a dash of cumin (which really makes the recipe). I cooked up the chicken the way it was in a pan with chicken broth (to make it softer) and then added the ingredients above with some red pepper and sour cream instead of heavy whipping cream. It was great with some wild rice and asparagus! Would make again!

The chicken turned out okay, it didn't seem like there was enough flavor to it. Also, I only used about 2/3 of the cream stated, and it was still too much sauce. I would definetly suggest cutting the cream in half.

Made this dish tonight for my mum and i.  I didnt use as much cream it would have been too much.  After bringing the mixture to boil i simmered for a while to thicken the sauce.  Overall a really nice and tasty dish.  I would make again definitely.

This was pretty good.  I did add the red pepper as suggested and I also added fresh spinach during the last few minutes and it added a great taste.  I also served this over noodles since it appeared to have a lot of sauce.  I would def. make this again.

This turned out MUCH better than I thought it would! I made it with chestnut mushrooms, and I also threw in some diced yellow onion as well as green. I thought that perhaps 1.5 cups of heavy cream would be too much, but the sauce was just SO delicious, I was glad there was lots of it! I wouldn't hesitate to make this again, especially for company. Thanks so much, Mike!
