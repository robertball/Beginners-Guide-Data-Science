This is certainly very easy!  And tasty, too!  The only thing I'd have wished was for a bit more flavor.  I followed the recipe even using a little more seasoning than called for, but it needed a little more spice for us.  I will use the leftovers and will make it as a quesadilla with all the extra ingredients---the sour cream, a spicy salsa, and some cheese.  I would make this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!
