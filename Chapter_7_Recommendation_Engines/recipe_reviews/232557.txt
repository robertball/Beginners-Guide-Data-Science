Super simple yet very tasty. I downsized the recipe to one serving. I was pleseantly surprised by the perfect blend of butter, sugar, cinnamon, cocoa, and allspice. I topped with all of the suggested toppings. The best part is you could make a large batch and store the leftover chips. They would also be a great gift to a host coupled with a homemade jar of the sauces.

I reduced the cocoa a bit and didn't use the peanut butter sauce. Instead, I reduced a merlot with Marionberriy syrup and drizzle that instead. Delicious!!  Couldn't make them as fast as they were being eaten.

You will definitely want some whipped cream or cool whip to balance it, though my boyfriend enjoyed them without it. Delicious!

I needed a quick dessert for an impromptu birthday lunch and I found this recipe. I baked them and placed 3 'chips' in each dessert dish, added sliced bananas, an extra drizzle of salted caramel, and whipped cream... everyone raved. So quick & easy, yet looked very special. Thanks!

It was extremely easy to make. It came out a bit sloppy though, the boys in my class loved it but most of the girls didn't eat it because of the way it looked, but overall it was really tasty

Don’t let the simplicity of this recipe fool you into assuming that it can’t be that good.  It is.  Not only is it quick, easy, and delicious, it makes a stunning presentation.  I served it with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe for an all nachos menu at small group.  They are crazy good, and so easy to make.  This recipe is now one of our party staples.

Made this for Cinco de Mayo.  All our friends LOVED it.  It is super easy to make.  We opted not to bother with the peanut butter sauce.
