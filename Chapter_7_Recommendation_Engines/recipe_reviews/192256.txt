These were super good. I normally am not a fan of brie cheese or oysters but I could not resist eating these. The brie made the oysters taste butter and delicious. Very much complementing each other. Would definitely make again.

Simple, yet fantastic!  The red pepper is a nice touch, especially color-wise.  I did half with lightly sauteed portobella mushroom slices and found out that you can garnish with a wide variety of whatever you like (thin sliced cheery tomato, fine chives, roasted garlic).  Makes for a great appetizer with friends so you can stretch out on your own toppings!  Thanks again for a recipe that is easy, quick, inexpensive, yet delicious and dynamic!

So gooood...! Never imagined that the combination of brie and oyster could taste this good. I used smoked oysters and pita bread so it looked like mini pizza. Next time I'm gonna use fresh oysters. :)

Well, I hate to review something after changing ingredients, but I had leftover oysters after steaming fresh in the shell and used this recipe as a base.  I had a loaf of rosemary olive bread - italtian style bread - and some of the laughing cow reduced fat cheese. I toasted the bread, spread on the cheese and put the oysters on top after just tossing them in a pan with some olive oil, butter, sauted garlic, parsley- that's it and they were absolutely divine!  Just be careful not to over cook the oysters. Thanks for a good idea to work with-- I'm sure would be good with canned smoked oysters as well.

Loved this recipe, only thing I did differently was sprinkle oysters slightly with cayenne before baking, put oysters on bread with the Brie on TOP to melt down over the oysters.
