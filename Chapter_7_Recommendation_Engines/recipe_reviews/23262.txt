This dish is very good, and with a few tweaks is even better. I used red and yellow peppers to add a little colour. Before adding the broccoli, I sauteed a little minced garlic in the oil. After the vegetables had sauteed a little, I added a couple of tablespoons of water and covered the pan to let the veggies steam until they reached the desired tender crisp stage. A splash of soy sauce and toasted sesame seeds finished the dish. This was very well received at Easter dinner, even by those who usually reject all things green. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

A simple way to enjoy broccoli and peppers. I don't agree with reviewers who said it was bland: sesame oil gives a nice nutty taste to this dish! Sometimes, you just have to enjoy the simple taste of veggies..

Very tasty and quick to make!  I used light sesame oil, added 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce for added flavor.  Thanks!

I don't get it. Since this recipe called for no seasoning, not even salt and pepper, I knew it would need something to liven it up.  But even after adding onion, fresh garlic, salt, pepper, soy sauce and a dribble of toasted sesame seed oil, this was still, as my husband aptly described it, "nondescript."

This is a good recipe, but since broccoli is normally a pretty bland tasting veggie, I made one big change. I used "Hot" sesame oil. I used a wok and doubled the amount of oil and cooking times. The result was quite "invigerating". However, if you prefer "mild" salsa, etc, this is not for you!

At first taste, I thought they were pretty bland. (But I wasn't that surprised. Afterall, there are no spices). However, I let them saute an extra min once I added a couple splashes of soy sauce (as others suggested) and the taste was much better. Went well with our baked bird and potatoes.

This meal was quick to make, but didn't offer much for flavor.  I'm sure some soy sauce or other spices would help it out.

Very good!!!  As suggested by other reviewers, used red bell pepper instead of green...as good as it was pretty...and added garlic AFTER first two minutes and then steamed it by adding a little water and putting lid on until cooked tender crisp.

I like this recipe. I recently became a lacto-ovo vegetarian for health reasons and was looking for healthy ways to enjoy vegetables. I am not a big veggie fan and I have never liked broccoli. This recipe made me like broccoli and in a healthier way than some other recipes. The flavoring is very suddle, I must agree. However, it was easy for me to jazz it up with flavor. Yet, it didn't kill me eating it as a basic recipe enjoying the flavors of the seeds, veggies and oil. Later, I added soy sauce a dash of sauce and enjoyed broccoli for the first time. Thanks, You have helped me on my quest to eating healthier!

It was a little weak on flavor, even after I added s&p and 3 cloves of garlic.  And I had to add water so it didn't burn.

A little bit oily. Didn't have quite the pizazz I wanted, though it did have a nice sesame flavor. I would consider adding some other spices, depending on what the main dish is.

Very tasty! I served this with Waikiki Meatballs and Orange Medley Rice (all on this site). I did add a splash of soy sauce right before I removed the broccoli from the heat.

Didn't have sesame oil, so I used peanut oil. Would like to try again with sesame oil.

Cooked again, this time with sesame oil. Still a 4 star. Rather boring, but super quick.

I made this for Christmas and it was a hit.  I liked the fact that it was simple yet the sesame oil gave it a hint of a nice nutty flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

This dish is very good, I added a splash of soy sauce to make it tastier. I also used olive oil which has the same great taste of sesame oil.

I sauteed the broccoli in olive oil and added a few drops of soy sauce for extra flavor.  The crispy, colorful result has quickly become a family favorite.  Thanks so much for sharing!

LOVED this! Delicious with only sesame seeds and sesame oil. If you want to add more of the nutty sesame flavor, just add more. Tastes light and is healthy!

It's good.  I will make it again.  I served it with the Asian Salmon recipe and it was a nice compliment so that's probably what I'll keep doing.  It wasn't spectacular and not something I'd make if I was having guests...but a nice change of pace for broccoli.

With some tweaking, this can be five stars, but as it stands, I could only give it 2.  Though it smelled wonderful, I agree that it was bland.  The next time I made it, I added onions, a dash of white sugar, and soy sauce.  What a difference just 2 simple ingredients make!

Light and delicious. I like my broccoli a little more done, so I stir-fried it about 5 minutes before adding the sesame seeds and bell pepper, then cooked it another 3-4 minutes.

Not bad. Good way to use up that broccoli that sat in my fridge for 2 weeks. I didn't have the sesame oil, so used olive oil and kicked it up a notch with about 15 drops of Tabasco. Great side dish!

I added garlic to the oil, along with the sesame seeds so they could toast a bit.  I also added a white onion, cut into large pieces with the red pepper and broccoli.  The sesame oil really makes this recipe, it adds a lot of flavour.

Really good!  I would like it cooked a tad longer so the veggies aren't quite as crisp, but that's just preference.

I am going to try this recipe using the red/yellow peppers instead of green. One question though... Why in the picture of "Sesame Broccoli" is there red pieces of what looks like red pepper? when the recipe only calls for green pepper???

That's a good dose of vitamin C! I used olive oil and fried 3 cloves crushed garlic before adding the fresh broccoli which I steamed for 5 mins in the microwave before adding to the pan. A dash of soy sauce was complimentary too.

This was really good, my four year old didn't care for it (and she usually loves broccoli, if it's plain), but hubby and I loved it. The sesame oil soaked into the broccoli pieces and they melted in your mouth. Yum, will make again....

I made a salmon dish, and put it into the oven.  I quickly searched for any broccoli dish that took less than 15 minutes to make as a side dish.  I found this recipe and had all the ingredients..  It didn't even make it to my family's plates, because it was so terrible.  I love sesame seeds, I love broccoli and green pepper.  But this combination was horrendous...

This receipe does not tell you if you use fresh or frozen broccoli.  I used fresh broccoli from my garden.  My family did not like it, they said it was much too bland.  I agree, it needs some onions and other seasoning to purk it up.

This recipe definitely lacks some zest.  I added soy sauce and used red peppers, as opposed to green peppers, for aesthetic reasons.  Because it's so fast though, it makes a great quick meal when served over rice.

Used half vegetable and half sesame oil which provided plenty of flavor.  I also used a red pepper instead of green to add color.

Perfect side dish with sushi. I needed a vegetable dish to balance out the dinner and this worked well. Followed other reviews and added garlic, a splash of low-sodium soy, and chili flakes. Doesn't need salt & pepper.

I added carrots (cut up matchstick style), strips of onion, and some garlic to the broccoli and bell pepper.  This was very simple and was a great side to our chicken yakitori and baked brown rice!  This one is going into regular rotation.

I like taste of sesame but this dish was too overpowered by it.  Also requires some seasoning. Made again and added a tablespoon of soy sauce.  That made it better.

Very good way to spice up plain old veggies. My problem (which I always have with broccoli) is the 2 minutes is not long enough to soften the broccoli to tender. I need to either steam it a little before hand or I saw a review that added water and covered it towards the end to reach the desired tenderness so next time I'll try that

I made this as a side at Christmas. It was a surprise crowd favorite! Substituted a red bell pepper for the green bell pepper for festive coloring, which worked great.

Great as a side dish. I used yellow pepper and added in a bit of soy sauce for extra flavour.

The house smelled wonderful after I made this. Must be the sesame oil, of which I added more than what was called.    I also added a dash or two of soy sauce for extra kick close to the end of the cooking time.

My boyfriend and I loved this. I used red bell pepper instead of green, for color, and I used olive oil instead of sesame oil. I also added some salt, pepper, cayenne, and garlic. It was delicious!

This was a very expensive mistake for me.  I thought I would love this, but It was just O.K.  The sesame oil was almost $8.00 for a small bottle at my grocery store and the sesame seeds were over $3.00.  I will not be making this again.

I didnt care for this at all. I followed other reviewer's advice and added a splash of soy suace and I still found it bland. I ended up stirfrying it w/ some terryaki that I had on hand it was somewhat better.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  It smelled great cooking (gotta love that sesame oil), but the resulting taste of the dish was lackluster.  We both found it very bland, and in fact I could not finish my portion.

Taste was a little boring.  I threw in yellow peppers for an extra sweetness and some soy sauce to give extra flavor.  Will make again.
