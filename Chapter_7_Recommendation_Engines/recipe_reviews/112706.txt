Hello all!   I just wanted to share that in the spirit of continuous improvement, recently discovered that the flavor is MUCH better using Yukon Jack canadian whiskey instead of the marsala. Sorry about giving myself 5 stars, but had to place a rating to leave this note! :) Also, wanted to say please do substitute where you want or need! Often I'm forced to use jalepenos because it's hard to find exotic peppers in cincinnati ohio. If you find something works better, please share! I'm constantly subbing out things in other's recipes and love to hear what works for you. Thank you for trying my recipe!!  XOXO  Noelle

I used this as a guide as I had to make tons of substitutions with what I had on hand...I loved how it turned out though!    I cut back on the sugar, used no honey, and as I didn't have molasses I tried adding a bit of unsweetened chocolate for the dark flavor. I used a roasted jalapeno instead of a poblano, regular cooking white wine for marsala, white and red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar, plus a little chipotle with adobo for the smoky flavor...LOL, it was a great guide for a fun BBQ sauce!  And I was happy it didn't call for Ketchup (my apologies for making so many changes...I just didn't want to go to the store!)

I agree that it is nice to have a bbq suce that does not require ketchup. This is a good stand alone sauce but has me wondering what I can do to satisfy whatever it is I think I'm missing.

While the original recipe was good (4 star), I redid the recipe with the whiskey Noellethediva stated was better, it was a definate NOT!  Personally I use organic wines and foods and make most things are prepared from scratch which in its original version was rich and robust with flavor, this version did the recipe no justice.  Sorry I had to give your recipe a low score this round.  YUKKKKK!!!!!!!

This sauce is wonderful...the only modifications I made were to omit the whiskey,  molasses,  & liquid smoke. I also added an extra tbsp. or 2  of  the honey. My son loves this sauce and would drink it if I would let him! Yummy!

I loved the addition of poblano pepper in this! This reminded me of a Kansas City style sauce and I enjoyed it seeing how that is my favorite style of BBQ sauce. It was a little bit too sweet for me so I'll just cut back on the brown sugar the next time I make it.  Thanks for sharing!

I was really looking forward to this sauce after seeing the ingredients.  So many deep rich flavors, but it didn't come out as well as I was hoping.  I needed something to smooth it out and make the flavors pop.
