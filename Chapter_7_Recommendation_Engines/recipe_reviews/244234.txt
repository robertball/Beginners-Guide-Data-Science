This was a great idea and simple recipe, especially since I'm not a big meatloaf maker. I followed the recipe exactly, but included some minced garlic and scallions I still had. The ritz crackers I got happened to be the Italian seasoning one and oh wow I think it really enhanced the flavor of the dish! I thought the sauce was a little sweet so would in the future omit or reduce the amount of brown sugar. I don't understand why I would leave some on the side though because the brown sugar was still crystallized and crunchy so I made another side batch without the sugar at all and it was tasty. The cooked sauce melted the sugar so no issues there. Regarding the garlic teeth- I inadvertently turned them green!! Became an incredible effect and perfect considering it's a zombie! I had cooked the meatloaf the night prior then added the fresh cut garlic pieces as teeth. I left it overnight since it was for a potluck at work, and the next day the garlic teeth were green! I freaked out at first thinking it was mold but it wasn't- the vinegar from the ketchup that touched the garlic caused some sort of reaction to turn it green! It's the sulfur or whatever that does this and it's still totally edible. Perfect perfect for this dish! Thanks for the idea and simple recipe.

This turned out perfect!! The taste of the meatloaf was phenomenal! Whenever I make meatloaf, I always use a new recipe since I haven't found "the one". This is it! The only difference is that I added some garlic to it but made it exactly otherwise! It was super easy to shape the zombie watching the video. Thanks! We loved it and it brought many smiles and giggles!

I know it is not Halloween yet, but I love Halloween and begging Oct. 1st the decorations come out and at least 3 times a week I make a "scary" Halloween meal. With that said, I wanted to practice how well this would turn out so I made it yesterday. Making the zombie was surprisingly easy. I did, however, use my own meatloaf recipe! Thank you for the awesome idea!

My family loved the recipe, and I even forgot to put in the milk.  It turned out fine.  Next time, I am going to add raw garlic as the teeth and cook it with the meatloaf to see what happens.

Great Halloween food. Lots of fun, my kids loved it! I used pieces of onion for the teeth and added them before baking so they weren't raw.

Everyone loved it! Made dinner fun. I am a big fan of the AMC show "Walking Dead" so I served this Zombie meatloaf & then we watched the show. I've never put crackers or cheese in my regular meatloaf but after trying this recipe I was surprised how much it made a difference. It tastes great. ???

Made it mostly as written. I sauteed the onions and garlic before  adding to meat mixture.  And I used 1/3 ground chuck, 1/3 ground lamb, and 1/3 ground pork. Lastly, I added Dijon mustard and dash of Tabasco to meat mixture and a dash of Sriracha to the sauce.  It was the best meatloaf we've ever had.

My 3 yr old son loved this! It's an inexpensive, practical and fun way the family can spend time enjoying Halloween!  I substitued rice for the crackers since my kiddo has celiacs!  Also I didn't have cloves so used olives!

I made this meatloaf for supper on Halloween, and it was a big hit with my family.  It has a nice flavor and great texture.  The sauce on top is a little sweet, but we liked that.  I didn't have garlic cloves for the teeth, and so I substituted pistachios.  I'll definitely make this again.

I left out the garlic and boiled egg since I made this into a normal meatloaf instead of a zombie. It was quite good although quite crumbly and the onion was obvious. I did use 1/2 cup of dried onion though. My family loved it! It definitely needs the extra sauce for serving. I served it with potatoes and carrots. I also used hickory smoke sauce in place of barbecue sauce.

This was so easy to make. Used almond slices for teeth. And used cocktail weenies in BBQ Sauce for "brains" that spilt out. Was over all amazing.

I made two of these, one for my son's family and one for us. This was a lot of fun, and everyone raved about it. I did think  the meatloaf recipe looked a little plain so I added a large diced carrot and some chopped celery to each. The sauce was great, made it exactly as per the recipe.

Very easy to make, very tasty, kid and SO approved!  I used corn for the teeth and they worked just as well.  I had no problems and made no other changes to the recipe.  Will be making this meatloaf recipe again!  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.

It was a big hit. I had a little trouble getting the teeth (garlic cloves) to stay put- the hot meatloaf kind of just pushed them out, and they dropped into the 'back' of the mouth.
