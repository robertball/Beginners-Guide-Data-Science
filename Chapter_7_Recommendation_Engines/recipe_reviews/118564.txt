This is an easy, tasty recipe. By following various suggestions made by  reviewers, lots of needed flavor is added to the dish.  To the marinade add an additional Tablespoon of honey, 1T garlic chili sauce & fresh ginger & 2T orange juice.  We also increased the marinating time to approx 45 minutes.  (Tip:  Store fresh ginger in the freezer.  It’s a snap to grate – no more strings!)

I thought this was very good, but I did make a few modifications.  I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen, and added some fresh ginger to the soy sauce/honey mixture and I used three cloves of garlic instead of one.  I also squeezed in a fresh orange as suggested by another reviewer.  When I make it again, I think I will add another tablespoon of honey.  I also added some crushed red pepper flakes and a few dashes of fish sauce.  I will definately make this again, the kids loved it too.

This was a really good stir-fry recipe.  I made a few changes that I felt really improved it so am giving it 4 stars because I don't think it would be as good as written.  I used shrimp instead of chicken, added some fresh ginger, used a little bit of rice vinegar, and then at the very end tossed with a small amount of sesame oil.  It turned out fantastic.  My Chinese husband was very impressed.  This would probably be even better with fresh veggies but I used frozen due to time.

This was a nice weeknight meal.  I keep grilled shredded chicken breasts in the freezer to make quick work of meals like this.  Using the pre cooked chicken, I heated the oil & garlic, added the honey, soy, and salt (no pepper for me!) and then added the chicken and frozen stir fry veggies and picked up from there.  I did double the sauce and it was barely enough for 2 of us.  This would be even better w/fresh veggies, I'm sure, but was still good w/frozen.  I also added a few shakes of crushed red for a little heat and a dash of sesame oil for a little more depth.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I doubled the sauce and threw in 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (makes it really spicy!) and 1/4 tsp ground ginger.  I also tripled the garlic.  Easy to make and delicious!

Probably didn't need the cornstarch, but this was really tasty and really easy.  It took the same amount of time as the rice took to cook.

This is a good recipe to work with. Like other readers,I added more honey and red pepper flakes. Also took an orange out of the fridge and used fresh orange juice instead of water to mix with  corn starch then zested the orange and put the peel into the sauce. This  added a great orange flavor. Will definitely make again. Family friendly

Very good. Added some crushed red pepper for extra flavor.  Also added a bit more soy sauce and honey to chicken and vegetables.  My boyfriend loved this recipe. Will definately make again.

This was very good. Like so many others, I made some changes. Used fresh veggies instead of frozen (time saving tip on fresh produce: prep it as soon as you get home from the grocery), used a lot more garlic (I love me some garlic), added a couple of dried ancho chilis for heat, and a tablespoon of fresh peanut butter. For the crowning touch, I added a tiny drizzle of rice wine vinegar and sesame oil before before serving.

Will definitely make again.

This is a very simple and easy recipe.  I made a few changes of my own, added a bag of frozen supar snap peas and more soy sauce, honey and garlic.  It was very tasty considering it didn't take any time to make, will make it again.

I rated it 5 because i read the other reviews and saw people added a few things which inspired me to add some of my own stuff which really made it a hit with my boyfriend who is all about flavor. Instead of 3 tablespoons of honey i did 5. I doubled the soy sauce and added 1 tablespoon rice vinegar and 1 teaspoon fish sauce. I also added a red bell pepper cut into small squares and one chopped onion. when i did the frozen veggies i added the sesame oil. Along with minced fresh ginger about a tablespoon with some red pepper flakes. YUM!!

I usually go for spicy stir fries so this was something different for us to try and we really enjoyed it.  It was a last minute find and I decided to make it to use up some frozen chicken breasts.  I only had a frozen vegetable blend of sugar snap peas, carrots, mushrooms, and leeks so I substituted that for the broccoli blend.  Great on a busy weeknight.  Served with brown rice made in rice cooker.

LOVED THIS - my husband left NOTHING on his plate after his 2ND serving! I used chicken billion cube in the rice as well as using trimmed chicken fat off the breasts in the rice – unbeknown to my husband I do a half brown rice (brown rice I cook first as I start the whole process- it takes lot more time) then do half white rice - simply adding additional water with white rice - in a few minutes  rices have 'merged'. So far he has not caught on he is eating healthier! The 'most helpful' reviews I used what they suggested with what I had on hand in my kitchen (red pepper flakes, a little rice vinegar, and fresh ginger). In my freezer I had some ‘in the freezer a long time’ frozen green and red sweet peppers I added to store bought frozen stir fry package.  I doubled sauce ingredients – one reviewer stated there wasn’t enough sauce - she doubled it. This stir fry turned out WONDERFUL – look forward to cooking again. Next time I hope to have an orange or juice on hand – I see how orange added would bump up the ‘yummy’ factor! One thing I LOVE about this Allrecipe website - are all the reviews – rated by most helpful. What a delightful way to share fun food experiences so easily!

I made this last night.  Absolutely delicious.  After I sauted the chicken I deglazed the pan with some rice wine vinegar.  Then I added a bit more olive oil to stir-fry the vegetables.  I also added half of a medium onion.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  I also used orange juice in place of water to disolve the cornstarch.  Like others have said, I let the sauce cook down until it carmelized everything nicely.

Really good stirfry recipe! Nicely sweet, and tastes similar to a recipe from Joey Tomato's that I've been trying to replicate for years! Needs more garlic than called for, and the sesame oil and rice vinegar at the end didn't hurt either.

Winner winner chicken dinner!  What a nice surprise!  I was just looking for a way to use blsl chicken breasts and found a recipe that I will use over and over.  I doubled the sauce as others suggested because I would rather have extra than not enough.  I didn't plan on any changes but had the addition of celery seed due to grabbing the wrong jar.  lol!  It didn't hurt the flavor at all.    Thank you Caroline Sperry for sharing such a great recipe!

Very good! I doubled the honey and soy sauce, added ground ginger, and a little crushed red pepper. I might marinate the chicken next time because it doesn't have much flavor and might actually triple the honey and soy sauce just because it tastes so good.

Delicious!!!  My family loved it!  I added a bit more garlic, sprinkled in some ground ginger and doubled the sauce.  It reminded me of my favorite Chinese dish, General Tso's chicken, without the spiciness.  I think next time I might add some red pepper flakes, but it is great as is too, and so easy to make!

This recipe was great! But instead of using frozen broccoli stir-fry vegetable blend, I used a stir fry mix in the produce section. I will definitely make this again!

My husband really liked this and it was really easy. After reading reviews, I added more garlic, honey, soy sauce, added some garlic powder and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it turned out nicely.

I followed the recipe except for adding some cayenne pepper to add a small kick.  I added zucchini too.  It's delicious!

Thanks for the idea for dinner tonight!  I didn't really follow the recipe, just used it as a guideline.  I couldn't even tell you the measurements that I used at all.  I marinated the chicken first in a Ponzu sauce/worchestershire/garlic marinade that I make and then used the Ponzu sauce in place of plain soy.  It added a bit of citrus to the sauce.  Very good!  Thanks for the new recipe!

This was so good! I tripled the recipe like other users recommended ...  I also added fresh grated ginger and plan to add some crushed red pepper for a little 'kungpao' next time. Oh, and I just used green and red bell peppers and yellow onions as my veggies. Makes very good left-overs too.  It's a keeper - it made it onto our family menu.

Very quick and easy.  I usually buy the frozen stir fry vegetables that are already seasoned to add a little extra flavor to the dish.

This was decent and easy to make.  It needed a little more salt for me and I think next time I'll add more garlic. We used a stir fry vegetable mix and it worked out well.  Very good!

Fantastic base recipe!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 TBS honey, 1 tsp red pepper flakes to the sauce, and to the corn starch added 2 TBS OJ (instead of water) and 1 TBS soy sauce.  Yum!!!  Best stir fry I've ever made :)

a fabulous dinner that would have a 5-star except you must double the sauce for sure!  very easy, and great flavor, except it definitely could use some fresh cracked black pepper on top just before serving.  i made rice in my rice cooker, which gets it just like it would be served in a chinese restaurant - nice and sticky!  the sweetness of the honey with the tang of the soy was a really great combination.  and amazingly, my kids both LOVED it!  this will be a recipe i hang on to for quick weeknight meals.  thank you!!

We liked this, we did 1 1/2lbs chicken - 1/2c. soy sauce and 1/2 cup honey, triple garlic, add red pepper, 1 tsp fish sauce and 1 tsp vinegar. It was a nice sweet alternative to stir fry. We also didn't use the cornstarch.

Awesome recipe! Took suggestions of other reviewers and tripled the garlic; added an extra tablespoon each of soy sauce and honey; a dash of rice vinegar and chili pepper flakes (didn't have red pepper flakes on hand); added fresh minced ginger. Used fresh veggies. I have made this recipe several times and loved it everyone time. Highly recommended!

This was a great, easy recipe!  I loved it as is, but can see how some of these modifications may be good as well.  I think that next time I'll add a little more honey and soy sauce, to make more of a sauce to pour over the rice and will also chop up some fresh veggies to add. :)  Delicious, my boyfriend asked if I can make this once a week!

This is really fresh and healthy.  I skip the rice, just to save calories.  At the end, I added a tiny bit more soy and honey. Delicious, and a great base recipe to add other flavors to. I might add more garlic and maybe a little ground ginger and chili flakes to the next batch.

I make this meal about every other week, I love it, It's easy and my boyfriend and friends love it too. The honey really gives it a great flavor, I usually even add more than the recipe calls for. I also use fresh broccoli, carrots, and onions instead of the bagged stuff.

I thought this was pretty good considering it didn't take me long at ALL to make. I tripled the sauce, cooked the stir-fry veggies in the sauce (warmed the chicken separately) and used a little ground ginger, crushed red pepper, and sesame oil. Good enough for my picky husband and our three friends!

This was very quick and easy to prepare.  I used pre-packaged fresh stir fry vegetables I found in the produce section of the grocery store instead of frozen vegetables.  The flavor was good, nothing outstanding, overall it's a good recipe for a quick healthy dinner.

I never have ginger on hand, so I was looking for an easy stir-fry dish that didn't have ginger and gave this a try. It was delish. Definitely use low-sodium soy, as it was pretty salty with regular, even without adding any extra salt. However, I did triple the sauce and most of it boiled away quickly. It didn't even need the corn starch. Anyway, I would definitely make this again for a quick, easy meal. Thanks!

I like that this recipe is super healthy! It's a great quick cook. If you want to keep your chicken moist though, don't put it back in with the vegetables before serving. Just keep warm and put on top of rice and vegetables.

This recipe was fantastic, a new family favorite for sure! The only things I changed in my cooking from the original recipe was adding more honey, garlic, soy sauce and I also put in some fresh ginger. I did not marinate the chicken before hand although I did simmer all of the ingredients together for a while. Over all this stir fry was a huge hit!

Turned out very well. I did add some chili powder and red papper flakes fora  little heat (personal preference) but tasted before the addition and it was still fantastic. 
You can add any and all veggies that work for you : baby corn, carrots, peas, edamame, etc. All are delicious!

We absolutely loved this recipe!!  I didn't measure everything exactly...probably used more fresh garlic than it called for too.  

I served it first with brown rice and hubby thought it was wonderful.  The next time I served it with bean threads.  I soaked them in water when I started the chicken, and then added them after the veggies were cooked.  They soaked up the juice, but kept a wonderful flavor.  Normally we use sooo much soy sauce to get the bean threads to keep a nice flavor, so it was a great suprise.  Will definitely continue to make this recipe!

This is pretty good. I added more honey and found that there was enough juice from the chicken to leave the chicken and juices in the pan while frying the veggies. Really good!

This was absolutely fantastic!  I had 2 pounds of chicken so I doubled the sauce as well.  Used fresh stir fry veggies, (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, celery and snap peas). It was so good.  We also made a beef stir fry and the guests preferred the Honey Chicken, by far!  Thanks for a great recipe!  We will be making this again and again.

I give this recipe a solid 4 stars since I was able to use it as a good base for my own sauce. I didn't measure any of my ingredients but here is what I did: mixed minced ginger and honey added an equal part of Tamari (gluten free soy sauce) and a generous sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Salt and peppered the chicken before adding it to the hot oil and once chicken was almost done added minced garlic (the stuff in a jar) with a little juice to the chicken.Allowed the chicken to finish cooking and the garlic to simmer for a couple of minutes. Added steam fresh Asian mixed vegetables and the sauce after a couple of minutes. Mixed my cornstarch with additional Tamari until smooth added that to my stir fry and allowed it to boil and thicken for a minute or so...ended up being very good and well received by my hubby. Very very easy and quick!

Great recipe! Just edited it a bit to fit my own needs- I added a bit more garlic, and I substituted olive oil with sesame seed oil.  I also skipped the cornstarch to make it a bit more healthy :) Overall, I was very satisfied

Quick and easy!  However, the next time I make it I will use fresh vegetables, more honey, soy sauce, and garlic.  I will also add some fresh ginger.  Overall, it's a good recipe to work with.

I make this exact recipe all the time!  And other reviewers have made modifications, which is great, but the essence of this recipe is how EASY and QUICK it is :)  It's also fine just the way it is I think.  I especially LOVE to let it cook extra long at the end (as I'm getting my kids to the table and getting it set)  It carmalizes the flavor and is SOOOO good this way!  Def try this recipe!

Very good basic recipe.  I did make some adjustments as per prior reviews.  Squeezed an orange in, a dash or two of red pepper flakes, and used fresh broccoli, carrots, and green onions.  Will also add one more tablespoon of honey next time.  Will be a go-to in my recipe book!

This is very good, and very easy to make. I did marinate my chicken in some soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, chili garlic sauce, and ginger before cooking it. Also I added one scrambled egg. Thanks for the recipe.

This has quickly become one of my favorite meals to make - the only recommendation I have (like many other reviewers) is to make more of the sauce!  I personally triple the sauce each time I make it.

If  you prepare this ahead of time, the cooking is perfect for easy dinners.  It has a very good flavor- sweet and salty.  I used celery and carrots fresh for the vegetables.  I will keep this in mind for quick nights!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time i made it exactly how it is written. And it was very bland. Not bad but it needed some help. The second time I added more garlic, a pinch or two of ground ginger, and a generous splash of pineapple juice (just b/c that was what i had in the fridge but i think orange juice would have been great tasting as well)...Voilà!! Delicious! :-)

Definately a keeper. I added more honey since i'm a sweet freak, and omitted the salt since all i had on hand was regular soy sauce. i didn't cook everything seperate, i cooked the chicken how the recipe said, then i just added the veggies with the chicken after it was cooked through. After the veggies were heated i added the cornstarch and water. My 4 year old twins even ate it which made my day.

I think this recipe is fantastic. I used fresh vegetables but the foundation of the recipe is so good, I think it still deserves 5 stars. I didn't make many changes other than a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and little additional honey and soy sauce in the last minute. My 4-year-old ate almost all of my chicken. It was delicious. This will definitely be a family favorite.

Totally delicious!  Made as stated, with the exception of making a triple batch of the sauce just because we like extra for our rice.  Pared this with some Jasmine rice and it was a perfect, fast dinner!

This is my husband's favorite recipe, and it's wonderful.  I only changed a few things.  I don't understand the point of using reduced sodium soy sauce, and then adding salt.  Just use regular soy sauce.  Also, I use half a package each of frozen broccoli and peppers instead of the frozen broccoli stir fry.  You can also use a pepper/onion mix.  Serve it over brown rice.

So good! I doubled the sauce. Used half at the beginning and added other half when I put the cooked chicken back in with the veges. I also used sesame oil to cook with and fresh veges.

In our house we rate recipes 1-10, this came out as an almost 7.  My husband said it would be good to make again, just not too often.  It's a nice recipe to use when you want to switch things upa  little.

This was a nice basic recipe for stir fry. I wanted more sauce so just started adding more soy, water/corn starch and then some chicken stock. The flavor was very good with a little ground ginger.

Great basic recipe that can easily be modified.  Was an easy week night meal!  Added a frozen bag of garden blend veggies (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) along with mung bean sprouts. Thanks!

This was a good base for a stir-fry.  I did make some adjustments per reading other reviews.  I upped the garlic to 3 cloves, the honey to 4 Tbsp, added 1 Tbsp of chili sauce and a small sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  Also used fresh vegetables: broccoli, bell pepper, carrot and some green onion.  Served over rice.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have any garlic on hand so I used a "garlic plus" seasoning and a bag of frozen Asian vegetables (red pepper, snap peas, onion, water chestnuts) I also added half a fresh onion with the chicken. Even my girls loved it, not a bit left after supper. Great recipe. Thanks!

This was fast and okay.  It obviously would have been better with fresh veggies, but it's a fair sacrifice for quick preparation time!  Watch out when you throw the garlic in the wok -- Ours burned in seconds!

This was very easy and quick. I tripled the sauce ingredients and I added a little adobo because I was out of salt. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper for some spice.

This is my go-to Chicken Stir-Fry recipe.  I love it.  The only thing I do different is double the amount of honey/soy sauce in order to make more sauce.  I also add some crushed red pepper to add some spice.

This recipe was so delicious! It reminded me of one of my favorite dishes in a local Chinese restaurant. I added an extra tablespoon of soy sauce and about 1/2 a tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes.

My family and I looooooove this recipe! It is so easy and quick to make! And perfect for leftovers the next day. The only change I made to the recipe was add additional corn starch and water to make it a bit juicer.

I thought this recipe was amazing! My whole family enjoyed it and there are no leftovers. I did add 2 extra TBLS of honey, 2 extra TBLS of soy sauce and a TBLS of rice vinegar. Overall a great recipe, I think it would be good without the rice vinegar too - I would still increase the amount of sauce because I like extra sauce. This one is definitely a keeper!

I thought it was yummy just the way it was!   Okay, I did add some extra garlic because we are fans, but only 1 clove and used fresh veggies.   But otherwise, I didn't change a thing.

This was a very good base recipe. I used fresh veggies (zucchini, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli) instead of frozen because I had just went to the farm market. I followed the recipe otherwise. Although after adding the ingredients for the sauces, I felt it needed more so I doubled the sauce. DH really liked it and asked that it be put on the menu again. I enjoyed it as well. Thank you for a good base recipe!

Had this tonight and thought it was very good.  Doubled the sauce and thought it could be a little "saucier."  I loved the flavor.  Maybe leaving out the cornstarch would leave it more saucey.  Yum!

Easy weeknight meal.  I like to use the frozen veggies that steam in the package. I double the sauce in this recipe and serve with brown rice.

This recipe is definately one of my favorites! i am 18 and i love cooking but after a looooooong day of school and my parents just get home from work, none of us want to cook. So I just volunteer to cook and this recipe is short and easy! Its a family favorite (: You who want good eating, try this amazing stir fry!
One difference that i like to do is to make it sweeter, I add a little bit more honey.

We all loved this one, I 4's the sauce but it didn't come out right  when I made this for the 2nd. time. So I have to be a little more careful on the sauce when I double it. taste it as I go. Lucia loved it, I thought it was really good also, so did Garrett & Stephen. Definately make again.

LOVE this recipe!  It is so easy, and delicious.  I had one serving and my hubby ate the rest.  I will need to make more rice for next time as I only made 2 cups.  I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

What a great dish!  It's so easy, and most of the ingredients are those you'd have in your pantry already.  I made it exactly as described -- delicious!!  Even my 5-year-old ate it (although I kept all the ingredients separated, haha).

I enjoyed this recipe, but made quite a few modifications. I felt that just the honey & soy sauce combo was a little bland, even when I stir-fried the chicken with garlic, so I added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, & cajun seasoning. I also put it additional honey & soy sauce then was recommended. Still, it was great & my friend was very impressed!

This was easy and pretty good.  I tripled the sauce (used about 4 cloves of garlic) and added fresh ginger, half of a lemon (juiced squeezed out), and a splash of sesame oil.

This was a great, super quick recipe!  I did take some suggestion from readers and added a a fresh squeezed orange to the sauce.  It really added a dimension of flavor!  The only thing my family suggested was that it needed more of the sauce.  So next time I make this recipe we will be doubling up the sauce!

Yummy! Only gave it 4 stars because I followed the suggestions made by the other reviewers. I tripled the sauce and used extra honey, used fresh veggies (red peppers, green peppers, zucchini, broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms and onions), squeezed some fresh orange juice into it and added some red pepper flakes and it was yummy!

I have done a lot of stir-frys, but this one was the best. My whole picky family like it.  The only changes I made was I added Teriyaki sauce to the sauce in the recipe as I like sweet sauces and I used 1/4 green pepper and a whole sweet red pepper. I also adjusted to make more sauce. s

Very tasty recipe. I give it 4/5 because of the adjustments I made do to others suggestions for needing more sauce. I added sweet chili sauce, red pepper flakes, tripled (if not more) the honey and soy sauce recommended. I also added about 1/3 cup of water while stir frying my veggies. I was able to impress my girlfriend with this dish. Thanks for the simple, yet delicious meal.

Was good, I used fresh veggies and fresh noodles from an Asian market. However I tossed my chicken breasts with cornstarch before stir frying, that always helps the sauce stick.

This was totally delicious! However, I wanted to make sure there was plenty of sauce for the rice so I tripled the soy sauce and honey and put in equal amounts of each. I also used much more garlic and added chopped onions.  With fresh veggies and red pepper flakes (very spicy, which we like!) it came great. Will surely make again.

This is a nice and easy stir fry recipe.  It's mild, so if you want to spice it up a bit, you'll need to modify.

This was so easy and really good.  I used fresh veggies (a combo that I like) and doubled the sauce (5 tbsp. honey, 5 soy).  It was so simple and good!  I was nervous at first because of the smell when you mix honey and soy but in the end it smelled and tasted great!

Perhaps a 3 1/2? Maybe I did something wrong but mine came out without a strong flavor and not too different than other stir-fry's that I've tried. Of course, I used my own broccoli mixture (broccoli, carrots, sugar snap peas, onion)...and it was the first time I've ever used cornstarch.

This is tasty, when spiced up more. I added a little more honey, red pepper, ground ginger, and garlic powder. Versatile-I used fresh bell peppers, onion, green beans, and frozen broccoli since I didn't have the frozen mix.

This is great. I added the garlic and onion when I did the vegetables so they wouldn't burn when getting cooked on med high heat with the chicken. I added orange juice like others suggested and it turned out wonderful.

This is one of the easiest recipes i have ever done. I made it with a friend (we are in high school) and we loved it. We used fresh vegetables instead of frozen including a yellow squash, half an onion, broccoli and a green bell pepper. The honey gives this recipe the perfect hint of sweetness and the soy sauce isn't overpowering. I highly recommend using fresh vegetables (sauteing onions first in the sauce from the chicken) even if it takes a little longer.

Perfect for a busy night dinner. I used orange blossom honey and added an extra TBSP and it was a little too sweet. I believe clover honey is best suited for this dish.

5 stars, with the following alterations: 

+Double sauce mixture OR add moisture in some way (I chose to throw in a 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce I had laying around--next time I might use a little beef consume?

+Add a little chili paste and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes

+Chopped ginger is a MUST! Also, throw in fresh veggies of your choice

We made with shrimp and jasmine rice... delicious!

Really this should be 4 and a half stars.  I loved this recipe and my family raved about it too.  With a 8 yo boy, a 4 yo girl and a picky husband that is just about a miracle! I made a few alterations - I added some garlic cloves, I used peanut oil instead of what was listed, added some ginger; but really they were small changes based on our tastes - you could make it exactly as it is and have a great dinner or you could add a few things here and there and make it your own.  A great recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I followed the advice of previous reviews and basically doubled the sauce mixture. We didn't have any regular oranges on hand and ended up using a Clementine instead -- it still tasted great. I also used some fresh snow peas, carrots, and broccoli. Definitely planning on making this dish again.

This was AMAZING! Even my picky 2-year-old asked for more, and she doesn't eat anything! I did make a few changes. I followed the suggestion to double the ingredients for the sauce, and added extra garlic. I also used orange juice instead of water to mix with the cornstarch, and added a little bit of ground ginger. A fabulous recipe!

It was okay.  Definitely not spectacular.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, a pinch of ginger powder, and some extra soy  sauce.  Even with these additions, I thought that it was just somewhat flavorful.  Would probably not make again.

I was really pleased with this recipe. I thought the sauce was a nice consistency--however I did follow other recs to up the honey, garlic, soy, and added fresh giner. Served over brown rice cooked in veggie stock. I think this sauce will be a great marinade to use in other ways.

Very good.  The only thing I did different was to cook the white rice in Chicken broth and added the cooked rice to the finished meal.  I add a tbsp of soy sauce to the rice as I mixed it with chicken & veggies. I also added a half of jalapeno for some added kick.

Excellent meal.  The only change I would make would be to use more sauce.  I ate it with Mandarin Oranges on the side and it was superb.

This was a great kid friendly recipe. I personally really like stir fries with lots of unique oriental flavors and spices and tons of different veggies, but my kids like things that are more conservative. This is one of the first stir fries that meets their approval. I just used frozen broccoli and cauliflower. The kids (including my extremely picky 6 year old) told me to make this one again.

My first attempt at this recipe was awful.  I did something terribly wrong but I don't know what.  I tried again and it turned out to be fantastic!

I used all fresh veggies including broccoli, bell peppers and a sweet onion.

This was just ok.  There was no real kick to the flavor.  I added some red pepper flakes and some more soy sauce to liven it up, as well as fresh veggies instead of frozen.
Thanks anyway.

Thank you so much for this recipe! Back in Ireland, there was a special frozen stir-fry that I used to buy (to save time), it was the only one I liked and if I hadn't of made it myself, I wouldn't have known the difference! Quick, easy, and perfectly sweet for us. Everyone loved it!

Really liked this marinade a lot. I didn't use the frozen veggies, but instead added a fresh red pepper, onions and mushrooms. I like fresh veggies better than frozen I guess. Very quick, healthy and delicious!

My husband loved this recipe, but I think it was more because of the changes I made. I used left over chicken from the day before (I did a very flavorful whole chicken in the crock pot) and then doubled the amount of honey and soy sauce. I will have to do this again the next time we have a whole chicken.

I liked this more than my husband. He doesn't care for meat that has a sweet taste to it but I thought it was a nice change. I doubled the sauce, otherwise it wouldn't have been enough for me.

Love this recipe, have made it several times. I marinate the chicken in some evoo, a little soy, splash of oj, pepper, garlic, onion. I cook the frozen veggies in the microwave to save time (while rice and chicken are cooking). I use the tips of adding a little ginger and cayenne, and of using oj instead of water with the cornstarch.

One of the best stir-fry recipes I've ever had.  Two changes: I added a touch of ginger, which gives the sauce a slight kick of extra flavor, and I doubled the sauce.

This is a kid-friendly stir-fry because the flavor is mild and slightly sweet. My kids are little and aren't into strong flavors yet, so this dish worked out well. My husband and I would have liked to have jazzed it up with some fresh ginger and maybe some crushed cashews or peanuts.

Terrific!  The honey soy mixture is really good.  The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is I didn't make it exactly as written as I used fresh veggies (broccoli, yellow and orange pepper, onion) and frozen peas/carrots and corn.  Healthy and delicious!

I made this as written and really like it. However, I prefer a slightly saucier stir fry. So next time I will probably double the sauce recipe and add some of the flavor suggestions by other readers. But overall, with picky eaters, a success!!

I doubled the sauce and the amount was perfect. I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki instead and less honey. I served it over brown rice. It came out really good. Thanks for the recipe!

very tasty.  as with most stir fry's I seem to add a bit of water before I thicken it up.  I like more sauce for my rice.  I also used fresh broccoli and fresh muchrooms.  Felt so healthy!! thanks for sharingll

I marinated the chicken in soy sauce and the seasoning including the garlic and followed the rest of the instructions and it was delicious!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and myself and loved it! Easy and delicious. I used fresh vegetables as opposed to frozen like many other reviewers...I chose broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, bean sprouts and water chestnuts...but the great thing about this recipe is that you can choose just about any combination of vegetables that you like. Definitely triple (or at LEAST double) the sauce. I didn't add any chili flakes this time like other users have suggested, but I definitely plan to next time...delicious recipe but it could use a little kick of spice. If you're a leftover person this recipe is for you....the leftovers are equally delicious!!

This is the second time we tried this recipe.  The first time we thought it was a bit too sweet, but I thought I used too much honey.  I made sure to measure very accurately this time and it was definitely better.  We like a lot of sauce so we did triple the sauce part of the recipe.  And I didn't have access to any kind of stir-fry blend so I just used frozen broccoli.  Last time I used some fresh broccoli and other veges which I unfortunately can't recall.  Very very good and simple recipe.  We love it with brown rice.

Awesome recipe.  Made for some friends this weekend.  Great advice by some of the other members to add a little bit of extra honey.  For the spice lovers out there, you have to add SRIRACHA hot chili sauce.  It's a must!!! Again, great recipe and thanks!

I've made this twice and really enjoyed it both times.  The first time I added red pepper flakes which I thought was great but was way too hot for my bf.  The second time I omitted the red pepper flakes but somehow the broccoli ended up overcooked and a bit of mush.  Very important to time it right when putting the broccoli in the mix and only cook for the 4 to 5 mins as recommended.

This was good, I have been looking for a stir fry recipe that is easy and fast with on hand ingredients.  I really like the sweet taste from the honey, I also added chili sauce for some kick.  Really good with fresh veggies instead of frozen.

I followed other reviewers' advice and added some OJ and some chili garlic sauce as well as some ginger and I thought the flavor was good but not outstanding. It was very easy though and I may make it again to play around with the recipe a bit more. It is a good starter recipe.

Very good recipe! I made this a couple weeks ago for my boyfriend and myself and we both loved it! He actually still talks about it! I took the advice of some other reviewers and added an extra clove of garlic, threw in some red pepper flakes for some spiciness, and doubled the sauce. We liked it a lot, but thought the chicken didn't take in a lot of the flavor, so I will probably marinade it in some of the sauce for a bit next time. However, the leftovers were awesome the next day!! The chicken really soaked up the flavor. I also will triple (maybe even quadruple! :)) the sauce next time because we like to have lots extra for our rice! Very good recipe! It will be one of our regular dinners!

I thought this stir fry was pretty good.  I added extra garlic, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp. ground ginger.  I also ended up putting in extra honey and soy sauce because there didn't seem to be much sauce.  At the very end, I put in a few splashes of rice vinegar.  Good!

wow. i was looking for something easy to make that would keep for a couple meals. this is great. i didn't have everything the recipe called for so i modified a little bit. i didn't have cornstarch so i used 1 tablespoon flour and 2 tablespoons cold water. Worked great. I also didn't do the rice. It would have been good I just didn't feel like cooking it. This is going into my favorites though!

We thought this was very good, even with frozen broccoli. I used about 3x as much honey as the recipe called for, but that was because it was fresh honey and I really wanted to be able to taste that flavoring. We'll make this again soon.

This is a favorite in our house.  I use whatever veggies I have on hand (peppers, onions, and mushrooms do well).  Also add a clove of garlic and substitute tamari for soy sauce to make it gluten-free.  We make this on average once a week because we always have honey and tamari sauce on hand.

This was a great recipe--quick, easy, nutritious!! I didn't have cornstarch, so i used the same amount of flour and some hot water to get it smooth, just before adding it to the pan. I also added another tablespoon of honey  when I put the chicken back in with the vegetables, for a little extra sweetness. For a change from rice, I served it on rotini pasta.

Nice and easy, but a little heavy on the honey flavor, light on savory.  Definitely double the honey/soy mix AND the cornstarch mixture if you want any sauce to make it through to the rice.

The taste was fine on this recipe, but it was very dry.  What did I do wrong?  I didn't see any liquid to add the cornstarch to.  It was dry chicken and vegies with no sauce.  Any suggestions?  The honey flavor was good...

This recipe was wonderful! The only thing I did different was made a double batch of the sauce, and that was still not as much as I would like but was a very good dinner. I also added fresh crushed garlic to the recipe. My son who does not like chicken even ate it. I did use fresh veggies i.e. broccoli, sugar snap peas, carrots, mushrooms and orange sweet pepper. Thank you for a simple tasty recipe.

This was excellent and easy.  I added extra veggies and a can of water chestnuts.  I served it with brown rice.  Next time I think I'll add some cashews to the recipe.

Absolutely amazing and so quick to make. I work full time and still have to come home and make dinner for my husband and I. This recipe is so good that he eats it for left overs for days after I have made it.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the sauce/marinade recipe exactly as the way it was.  Only thing I did differently was add A LOT of veggies. Carrots, snap peas, broccoli, onions, mushrooms.   Just delicious. Can't wait to have some leftovers for lunch!

I found this a bit bland for my taste.  I ended up adding more honey in the end and that helped some.  I used fresh carrots and cabbage instead of frozen and added some red pepper flakes for a little kick and should have added more.  I think some ginger would go well in here too.

Liked the base for this recipe. Doubled the marinade recipe. I added more garlic, fresh ginger, and red pepper flakes. Used fresh veggies. Would recommend pre-marinating chicken in 1/2 the marinade and using the rest when stir-frying veggies.

Pretty good. I used all fresh veggies: a couple of bell peppers, carrots, and broccoli. Also 1/4 cup of honey instead of 3 tbls. It turned out a bit bland - next time i'll add more garlic and spice, but for a customize-type dish, it was wonderful. Thanks! :)

This is a great easy recipe that can be modified to suit everyones preferences.  

I also added more garlic, and doubled on the honey/soy sauce, and added a tsp of cayenne for some kick.

I used fresh vegetables (bag of stir fry veggies), and sliced carrots.

Okay, so I didn't exactly do it JUST like the recipe. Instead of chicken I used venison stew meat & fresh veggies instead of frozen & it was GREAT!!! Will make this again. Oh, & left the peppers out & doubled the sauce like another person had said.

This was easy to make. I highly recommend using fresh veggies as suggested in previous reviews. I found the flavoring to be very light, next time I would beef it up. I also barely had any type of sauce, which was fine, but if you want sauce increase the ingredients.

pretty good, didn't make very much sauce, though. we had to use extra soy sauce to moisten the rice. we used low-sodium soy sauce to make it slightly healthier.

This turned out amazing. . I made a slight motification, i used fresh veggies. ( i always try to use fresh stuff). Also I doubled the amout of garlic. Next time i'll triple it. The honey flavour can be a bit overpowering. But it was a very distinct great dish! Thanks!

Absolutely great and so healthy.  My husband and kids loved this and so did I.  The only change was that I used fresh vegetables.  Thanks for the healthy and easy recipe.

I love this recipe. I made it while my parents were away on vacation and had my cousins over. They ask me for it almost everytime they see me! (I am young, so I am not that great of a cook..) I thought I would try to make honey mustard chicken stirfry and I had no idea what I was doing.. and it turned out great. I just squeezed a little bit in the pan and added more as needed. ( I got the idea from a honey mustard chicken I tried in Mexico) Hope this helps anyone :)

Amazing recipe! I used fresh broccoli as my only veggie and doubled the sauce so I'd have plenty to go around. Delicious with basmati rice. My husband said it was even better than the Chinese take-out place! Wooohooo! Healthier and cheaper too.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I have to point out that I live with some of the fussiest eaters I have ever had the misfortune to come across, and they were back looking for more.

I did use fresh veggies instead of frozen, though I seriously doubt that would have changed much. It was a cinch to make, cutting up the veggies and chicken and cooking the rice were what took the longest.

My only suggestion would be to make extra. It'll definitely go quick. ;)

I made the recipe just as the recipe said and it was just good. I made it last night and added a few things.  I cooked the chicken then added fresh garlic and onion, then I added the honey and soy sauce and to that I added a few tablespoons of oyster sauce, sauteed that a little then added fresh steamed vegetables, I also added a bit of garlic powder and ground ginger, then the corn starch. OMG it was AWESOME!  Way better flavor than in the original recipe! I give my version 5 stars and the original 4.

I'm sorry I just did not care for this. There was too much of something, not sure what. I did double everything as suggested, maybe that is why the flavors were a bit too strong. I gave 3 stars because my stepson did like it, even though my husband and I did not. Thanks anyway!

Really good, even as a leftover. Added extra honey and soy sauce, as recommended by others (added more every time that I changed pans). Definitely will make again.

My roommate and I both loved this, but I did add a lot more of each ingredient.  Every time I changed it over- as in took out the chicken and put it back- in went an extra tablespoon or so (I wasn't really measuring) of honey and soy sauce, and sprinkles of salt and pepper.  The extra sauce was really good once it was mixed up with the rice when I ate it.  I might try some extra garlic as well next time.  I also used all frozen broccoli instead of mixed vegetables since I'm not a big fan of cauliflower or carrots, and that's the only mix I could find.  Turned out well anyway!  Definitely will be having this one again.

Two words: de -- LISH!  It's so quick and easy, and to me, it tastes like the PERFECT stir-fry!  I was sold on the honey and soy sauce, they are beautiful together!!  I ate it almost every meal for three days!  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a really simple dish to make and had great flavor.  DH loved it too.  I served over brown rice which I cooked in chicken stock versus water for added flavor.

easy and delicious. the honey lends a wonderful flavor to the soy sauce, and helps to cut the salt a little.

So Good! BF loves it also.  I used frozen broccoli instead of mixed veggies because that it what I had on hand.  I don't even really like chicken, but is wonderful in this recipe.  
Very Fantastic and Easy!

So yummy!  I made about 3 times as much sauce as the original recipe and also added a teeny bit of ground ginger.  I served it on udon noodles instead of rice; my fiance and I loved it!

We really enjoyed this recipe, especially how tasty and moist the chicken turned out.  I added a touch of ginger and red pepper as suggested by other reviewers.  I definatly will be making this again.

It was really great...I just like more sauce in my stir fry to go over my rice.  Will definitely make again, and just up the 'saucy' ingredients!
