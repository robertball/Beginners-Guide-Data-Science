Excellent: but unless you're using abnormally large zucchini, I'd recommend getting 4. I also followed the recommendation of another reviewer from another recipe and salted and baked the zucchini slices for a little over 10 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. I compensated by reducing the salt in the cheese mixture, but perhaps I didn't need to. I substituted frozen spinach for the parsley in the cheese and egg mixure. Turned out great. I was afraid of it drying out, so I added some pasta sauce on the very top before baking -- about 1-2 cups to get a nice coating.

This is so delicious!  I actually used eggplant instead of the zucchini!  It turned out amazing.

I made this in a 10X15 glass casserole dish, I never seem to have enough room in a 9X13 for lasagnas. I used a Julienne vegetable slicer to slice my zucchinis, so they were quite thin, and I didn't do any of that pre-cooking or salting them. 4 medium zucchinis made three nice layers with no problems, and I kept the seed slices in there also. I had some homemade marinara sauce, about three cups, so I used that with the diced tomatoes, and only a small can of paste, since I had a larger casserole dish. The instructions for layering are well written, so many lasagnas are confusing when it comes to the layers. Someone complained about the prep, but I did all that in the time the meat and sauce was simmering, a really good lasagna is worth the extra time it takes to prep. We really loved it and you don't miss the noodles at all...will make this one again.

I made this exactly like the recipe called for the first time.  It was great!  The second time, left out the sugar and red pepper flakes and I added fresh spinach. It was even better.  The third time, I added fresh spinach and sour cream (16 oz divided in 1/2)with 1/2 on top of each layer of spinach and spread over spinach.  The layers went like this: zucchini, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce, spinach, sour cream.  Repeat.  Let me say that the dear husband and the cute little munchkins wanted more and there was none--I mean none-left for the week--which is what I was hoping for lunch leftovers.  I am thinking a repeat for next week!  Yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was awesome!  Make sure to salt the zuchinni slices to get as much liquid out as possible before building the dish!  Delicious!  I've already shared the recipe with several people.

This is the best lasagne I've ever had. Made exactly to the recipe. Everyone loved it, including my non-veggie eating teenaged boy. Will make a few to vac seal and freeze for winter!

Great recipe! My noodle loving family didn't miss noodles. I used all Italian sausage, no beef.  I also followed another reviewers suggestion and used spinach instead of parsley in the cheese, egg mixture.

To be honest this recipe is very delicious but extremely time consuming! Also unless you have found extremely large zucchini to use you will need WAY more then three!! I would also recommend using a mandolin to cut the zucchini so you will get even pieces. I used a peering knife as suggested and it was tedious and frustrating. I am not sure in what world would it take 30 mins prep time since it is all home made and you have to chop and cut everything including the spices. The sauce alone takes 30 mins of cooking time. Once was all said and done it was very good. If I were to ever make it again I would make those changes.

Best flavor ever! The seasonings in this dish are superb, my husband and I both loves the flavor. I am in the process of making number 6 and 7 to put in the freezer, I already thawed one to see how it re-baked and it was as good as fresh. I made a couple of modifications, no beef-just sausage and fresh Asiago rather than ricotta.

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and half of the zucchini for eggplant and decreased the amount of salt a bit. Still was a little salty, but loved the flavor of the meat sauce. Good recipe and will definitely make it again.

This was excellent!  I used a larger pan because I like to have plenty of room without the lasagna bubbling over.  I also used about 4 med. zucchini just sliced as thin as I could.  Didn't salt or precook them.  Used 1lb each of Italian sausage and hamburger and threw in some mushrooms cause I love them!  Besides that, I did the recipe exactly as written.  Loved it!  Next time I might use a bigger container of ricotta since I used a bigger pan.  And I did cover with foil for about the last 20 min of baking, but took that off again when adding the last layer of foil.  This recipe is so worth the time and effort.  Thanks Jeff B!

My husband and guests from WV raved about this recipe.  It has now become our favorite pasta-less lasagne.   I used all mild Italian sausage rather than half ground beef.  I also cut the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon rather than the 1 Tablespoon in the original recipe.  It turned out plenty spicy.  This  lasagne actually held together perfectly for cutting and serving!  Many thanks!

This was amazing! Everyone loved it and raved. EVERYONE. Not a morsel was left! I didn't salt the zucchini, just used my mandoline slicer and put them directly into lasagna. No one missed the noodles. Was perfect! I really didn't feel it was time consuming as others did. I used ground venison and breakfast sausage from a local farm, and added fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach in the layers. Didn't use the sugar because it seemed superfluous. Can't rave enough! Will be making this again and again and again.  If you are considering making this recipe, do it now!

This was the best lasagna I've ever made. A little time consuming but well worth it.  Next time I might slice them in rounds to save some time.  I used dry herbs(except for parsley) and cut the amounts in half. I used less than a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and, for me, that was enough spice. My hubby loved it. Since I don't eat wheat, it was the perfect dish. The rest was frozen to enjoy this dish again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

We use a pound of ground turkey with our homemade sausage seasoning instead of the beef and Italian sausage.  This is our go-to "special occasion" dish.  If there's a reason to celebrate, chances are we'll be serving this lasagna.  It's delicious!

This was great.  Followed the recipe as much as a could with the ingredients we had, such as two yellow squash and one zucchini. The yellow squash were good for the bottom layer because they were thicker.  Used light ricotta but the mixture with the egg and Romano cheese  and fresh parsley was divine.  Also used jarred Healthy Delight sauce but added the recipe's garlic, pepper flakes, and fresh basil and oregano. It was wonderful.  I was just amazed that everyone loved it.  Thanks for this.

This recipe is great! This is a good way to use up those extra large zucchini that hide in the garden. I didn't have sausage so just used a whole lb of hamburger.  The hardest part was slicing the zucchini lengthwise.  Next time I'll just slice  normally and layer them that way. I think I like this better than regular lasagna!

We used crumbled pork sausage instead of beef and added a few more veggies, but all-in-all it was delicious.  My 3 & 5 yr old kids ate the whole thing (and then we told them it was zucchini and not noodles).   Great dish, will definitely make again.  Especially if my garden creates those massive zucchini again.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out fabulous!!  I did prebake the sliced zucchini at 350 for ten minutes and added fresh spinach on top of the sauce and it turned out great.  I also used the big zucchini that get lost in the garden which made for good size 'noodles' and good flavor.  Would make again.

I did use 1 lb of both ground beef and hot ground sausage.  As per other suggestions, ended up using my food processor to slice 5-6 medium zucchini and added a can of stewed tomatoes. My family loved this recipe. They did not even miss the noodles. So good!

I made it. I didn’t have ricotta. So I used a brick of cream cheese. I will follow the recipe next time.

The family ate all . No complaints. I was surprised how firm it was. Good Keto recipe

Excellent. I cut the zucchini slices thin and then doubled them in a pattern. I did not need to pre-bake the zucchini slices. I doubled the meat using half ground beef and half turkey sausage. It was very good! The only thing different I would do is halve the red pepper flakes, but it was fine. I will be making again for sure!

Followed the recipe as is and it was absolutely fantastic. Don’t see any need to buy lasagna noodles any more. This is a definite keeper and I will make again for sure!

I found this recipe when I was looking for a lasagna I could serve a diabetic. I doubled up on the meats for a little meatier sauce and my husband loves it. Now when I do make it, I make extra ones, and freeze them, to use up all the extra zucchini and always have a premade meal on hand.

This was excellent. I used a  28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes instead of 14. Loved the flavor of the sauce. Eggplant slices  replaced the zuchinni. Added extra veggies into the layers  baby portabellas, fresh spinach and sliced yellow squash.  This recipe was a pleasent surprise! Will definitely make again.

I make this at a retreat center I work at. I didn't care for it being so watery and after reading all the reviewers have the same problem, I came up with a solution! I peel the zucchini and then then spiral cut it. Put a rack in a baking pan and place the spirals on the rack, trying not to overlap. I put the pan in a 250 degree oven for 30-45 minutes to draw out the moisture witout cooking the zucchini. Worked great and texture wise you could hardly notice the difference from a pasta lasagna. The 14 ladies raved it!

Great recipe- modified a few things. I used a full 1 lb package of mild ground sausage, no beef.i did bake the zucchini first with salt, which really helped keep  them crisp. I also added Asiago cheese into the ricotta mix. I loved it!

This was delicious, and approved by our children as well. The only change I made was the addition of fresh mushrooms and dried vs. fresh spices, since I only had them on hand.

I wasn't a fan of the brown sugar in the meat and the recommended tablespoon of red pepper flakes was WAY too hot-- it covered up all of the other flavors. And that's coming from someone who loves spicy curry, hot wings, siracha sauce, etc.

Loved it! Very flavorful and one meal you want seconds of. Will try it with ground turkey as well as egg plant next time. Great flavor with garden fresh zucchini. Will definitely be sharing this recipe with others.

I used only half of the red pepper flakes, salt & pepper. It was spicy enough to taste but  not enough to make my hubby put it down. It was yummy in my book. Loved it.

Delicious recipe!  No changes needed!  I do, however, add mushrooms when i add the tomato paste and diced tomatoes.

Why does the photo (not the recipe) have black olives? EW! YES---plan on having plenty of ZUCCHINI! Yes--- it took me about 4 hours to make this. YES---- Its good! I did ADD A SPRIG OF ROSEMARY & threw in a BAY LEAF while the tomato sauce was brewing.  Next time I make this I will do 3 LAYERS of zucchini/ricotta mix/ tom sauce instead of just 2.

Holy... wow.  I loved this.  Yes, it's time consuming (but making food this good at home is usually worth it to me)  I mistakenly cut the zucchini widthwise instead of lengthwise using a mandolin instrument.  It just took a bit longer to do the layers.  I did not roast the zucchini, and I'm okay with it being a little watery.  It wasn't gorgeous, but wow.  So good.  I couldn't find bulk Italian sausage (all they have are links where I am? )  so I substituted ground lamb for the sausage and added a small amount of fenugreek with it.  It was excellent.  I might try some of the other iterations of this recipe next - love the idea about sour cream and spinach!

I roasted the squash first and then used it instead of noodles. Pretty good, but not significantly healthier.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious!  I substituted butternut squash for the zucchini just to try it and it was great.  I also used a jar of Mezzetta Arrabiata sauce instead of making the sauce.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same and I hope you try it.  Just wonderful!
