I didn't have coconut or the pineapple, so added tomatoes (Hey, its a fruit, right?)  I also used a balsamic vinagrette with a splash of lime. Absolutely delightful salad!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is very good and quite adaptable.  I cooked the shrimp in a little garlic and red pepper.  The sweetness of the pineapple and coconut meld great with the other ingrediants.  You won't be disappointed.
