I loved this and will definitely make it again. I had trouble finding buckwheat so I used bulghur wheat which is similar. Other than having to adjust the times slightly due to the wheat this recipe was fabulous. The only recommendation that I have is that the water/broth from cooking lentils/legumes can add to the unpleasant after-effects of eating them, so I used fresh vegetable broth instead. Thank you for this recipe - it will be a household standby!

I used cayenne instead of crushed red pepper--not wise on my part, it was too hot!  I used oat groats instead of buckwheat groats, and found it to be a pleasant combination--I can't wait to try it with buckwheat!  This was quite tasty, and I'll be making this vegetarian meal again!

Wow! This was not only attractive, but delicious. I doubled the garlic, cause we love it. And I didn't us the lemon thyme, cause I don't have any.  Otherwise, the same. I think I'll try less oil the next time. But great!!!

This is good and I'll make it again, mostly for its vitamin and vegetarian benefits.  It's not terribly flavorful, but it might get better in the fridge overnight. The only substitution I made was using dried marjoram instead of fresh.

THis recipe was amazing. Husband loved. The only thing that I changed was adding more regular thyme because I did not have lemon thyme. Thought flavor original and very tasty. Making it again for a party.

We really didn't like this one.  It was edible but it was missing something.  I don't think I'll make this again.

I absolutely loved it! Such an unusual, healthy, and delicious side for almost any main dish! If you find it hard to find buckwheat in a supermarket, you might want to try an ethnic store - they are sure to have in in any Russian grocery (ask for "grechka" if they don't understand "buckwheat").

I simplified this recipe by cooking the spices, lentils and carrots together with the veg broth. I didn't have the salt free seasoning so I added a few dashes of basil, sage, marjoram, onion power and garlic powder. I didn't want to deal with draining the lentils and with the carrots cooking with it I couldn't have drained them anyway. I cooked the egg covered buckwheat in water and added it after it was done cooking. It was a delish recipe! My family loved it, even my picky daughter!

I really enjoyed this meal and my kids ate it. Full of nutrients.  I thought the leftovers were a little dry, so adding a bit more olive oil and red wine vinegar helps.  I double thyme (didn't have lemon thyme) and used 1/2t dried marjoram.  I left out the red pepper flakes (don't like spicy food) and cardamom (I've run out).  For those who thought this meal was bland -- taste it at the end and add more salt/pepper/seasoning.  It's a very healthful, nutritious meal!  I topped with baby chard and chopped tomatoes.

This salad has crunch and nutrition and is easy to make.  I like that it can be served at multiple temperatures, making it versatile.  It is sufficient enough to serve for a lunch or with a protein side for a dinner.  The cumin overpowered the other herbs in the recipe, for me, but it was good.
