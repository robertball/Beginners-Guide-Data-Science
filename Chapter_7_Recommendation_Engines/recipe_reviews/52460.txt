This was so awesome! I've made this dish for years and never added the vinegar or parsley. It was given to me by a friend who lived in Ulm Germany. Her Mom always fixed this for them as they were growing up because it was economical. I tried yours using the vinegar and the parsley and what a nice change! I bring this to a lot of Potluck banquets and people raved! Now they rave even more with the new twist from this receipe! Simply Awesome! Thank you!

As a huge spaetzle fan I of course love this. I always have had spaetzle plain though with gravy or butter. This is like a really fancy mac and cheese but better. I made a simple cucumber salad with it ( Chopped cucumbers tomatoes and onions with a couple TB of apple cider vinagar over it) and it went wonderfully with it. Thanks for the tip.

I have made this recipe twice and there was no way it was a "dough" that could go in a spaetzle maker. I put it in a zip-loc bag and cut the tip to squeezed it into the water. However the flavor was very good and I will keep making it. After boiling I panfriend mine with some well cooked sauerkraut. I miss real german food since I moved back to the US and I can not find a recipe for something I used to eat and find in the stores all the time called Schumpfnudel so making this is about as close as I can come.

This recipe is perfect. Tastes just like my grandmother's and she always prided herself on the craft of perfect spaetzle. And my father was to happy to hear how well it came out as he always seemed to think it was a little to tricky for him! Suggestion for those making this dish without the special spaetzle seive: Spoon the dough into an extra strength freezer bag and cut the tip off one corner. (xtra strong because all that squeezing of dough will break the back and you will have dumpling spaetzle. It's also nice to have extra dough to spare because I always seem to make quite a mess. I'm going to double the recipe next time! Also make sure you have some larger sized onions and caramelize them WELL. Chedder cheese worked great as a substitue and I think i omited the vinegar too. Experiment with your spaetzle.. it may become a favorite dish! My father would serve it instead of mashed potatoes and we would cover it with gravy!

I accidentally stumbled across this recipe and I'm so glad I did. I love spaetzle and make it certainly more frequently than the average American but I've always made it with pork roast and served with gravy. This is an excellent change of pace. If you like spaetzle invest in a spaetzle maker. Mine looks like an extra large potato ricer and has a variety of plates to choose from to vary the size of the spaetzle. It's so easy I use it when I make chicken or turkey soup. Rather than buying noodles I make spaetzle and squeeze into the soup when everything else is done cooking. I made this recipe for supper last night. Followed the recipe exactly except I grated fresh nutmeg and fresh pepper across each layer before I added the cheese. I used a bag of shredded swiss cheese since I didn't want to spend 9 on cheese when I wasn't sure if we'd like the recipe. I'm sure it would be even more delicious if you bought better quality cheese. My bag of cheese had 2 cups in it and that worked out fine although if you really want cheesy go for the whole amount. The onions on the top are so delicious. My husband asked if I added French onion soup mix. (I did not.) He said it reminded him of French onion soup. I did cook the onions in butter rather than oil. It only took 3 Tbsp. of butter. I also forgot to add the vinegar but that was okay. The thing that really made this meal was what I served with it. I made a simple salad with cucumber cherry tomatoes and red onion

This recipe gets 5 stars for taste and 3 stars for preparation. I thought is was an excellent dish and even my husband a meat and potatoes man ate it right up. However I had a difficult time making it. I don't have a spaetzle maker so I used a colander with course holes. The dough was too thick (or maybe my colander holes were too thin) and did not drop into the water as it should have. I ended up dropping the dough into the water with a spoon. While the pasta did not look as it should have it didn't seem to greatly affect the rest of the meal preparation. I also found that the pasta preparation was a bit labor intensive. This might not be a problem for some cooks but with three young children crawling up my legs I wasn't able to give my full attention to making the dish as I should have. If I attempt this meal in the future I might try to cook all the pasta at the same time and then drain the pot so I don't have to remove the pasta with a spoon and to save time. However as I said earlier this is a delicious meal that I highly recommend especially for cooks who like to try new and different dishes.

I've been making this for years; my SIL is German. Super easy to make!! The noodles cook up really fast. It's also good with some sauteed mushrooms on top!

I do not have a spaetzle maker and prefer to tip the bowl slightly over the pot you cook them in and just take a wet a knife and cut them off the lip of the bowl into the pot. They are like little dumplings. Nice reheated the next day in butter.

Great Recipe! The spaetzle was a little more difficult to make than we thought it would be. We live in Bavaria right now...so we can just go pick up a package of it to make the preparation much easier. We made the recipe as written. We are definitely keeping this one! But we are going to mix the onions in with the spaetzle cheese mixture and also add some broccoli to it next time. Thanks for sharing!

When my mother died many of her recipes were lost and I have been searching for a spaetzle recipe that matched hers- this recipe was wonderful- light fluffly little pillows of pasta. I couldn't find my spaetzle maker so instead I improvised using a grilling basket designed for the outdoor BBQ. I placed the rather large basket over the boiling water plonked a cup of dough in and smoothed it thru the basket with a spatula. It worked beautifully. Thanks for sharing.

I've only made the spaetzle portion of the recipe but it was good! I find it difficult to use in a ricer without adding extra flour. I love it in my Chicken Paprikash recipe.

Very good and went over well with my picky 10-year old eater. I hate it when people modify recipes but this one I'm only adding 2 eggs because it was very runny and I think that adding only two will cut down on that. Glad that you posted and happy to have it!

I spent several years being stationed in Germany and I have loved authentic German foods ever since. I feel in love with spaëtzle for the first time a couple decades ago. I really loved this recipe but I used packaged spaëtzle noodles and didn't make the noodles from scratch. The only changes I made was using freshly ground black pepper instead of parsley. I served this with chicken paprikash and it was a big hit with my family. Thanks for the recipe!

oohhhh my goodness. DELISH! i used red onions (quartered and sliced) and unsalted butter instead of oil for cooking the onions... and i mixed all but one cup of cheese together before baking instead of layering (i let the spaetzle/onions sit for a while until cool/company came) then i topped the whole thing with the last cup of cheese. For the swiss cheese i used 2 cups gruyere and 1 cup swiss. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!! better than restaurant!!! (only thing missing in the spaetzle batter was the nutmeg but i didn't miss it with the finished product! Fantastic!

I sent this recipe to my sister in law. She made it for Christmas and said that it was really easy and it is JUST LIKE Grandma's. She said that the carmelized onions took a litle longer than she thought they should but they were easy to make with a spaetzle maker. My husband had some the day after microwaved and said that it was excellent!

My boyfriend made this for me and it was DELICIOUS! So simple yet so good. He added some roasted peppers and it was wonderful. Just as a warning though this dish does not reheat well. That is if you can keep yourself from eating it all!
