This was a very delicious pie! I had to make a substitution to accommodate a person who is allergic to strawberries. Instead I used frozen raspberries and was very pleased with that result! Boysenberries would also work nicely with this lovely recipe!
I have a funny story to add to this: I had just finished placing the lattice top and fluted the edges of the crust then pondered if I should brush the top with an egg wash. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I had forgotten to add the eggs to the fruit mixture! I literally hollered in frustration as I realized the eggs were absolutely necessary and considered the mess of pulling everything apart in order to mix them in! I mentally cast about for a remedy and then remembered my marinade injector syringe! I quickly beat the eggs and then sucked them into the injector! I injected them between the lattice-work and saw the yellow stuff squishing back up...Fortunately, it all worked out fine! The pie looked beautiful and no one was the wiser! The moral to the story is: Even when faced with a potential culinary disaster, there may be a simple solution right at hand!

This was my first attempt at a lattice top pie as well as my first attempt at a strawberry rhubarb pie.  The flavors were wonderful but I did run into a few problems.
1) The crust cooks quickly and should have been completely covered with aluminum to prevent it from over cooking.  I took the pie out early to prevent burning but then not all of the rhubarb was thoroughly cooked.
2) This is a very runny filling.  I will probably add tapioca flour and reduce the number of eggs to 2.  Also, I think it would be worth letting the fruit sit in the sugar in the fridge overnight and then straining out the excess juice.  I will also be adding more fruit as I like my pies bulging with fruity goodness!
Thanks for the great inspiration though.  The crystalized ginger really makes this pie!!

Wonderful, wonderful pie!  I love rhubarb (and who doesn't love strawberries?) but have never liked rhubarb/strawberry pie because it always seemed to be made with jello.  So my rhubarb pie is a custard-based pie.  I was excited to find this recipe and half expecting to be disappointed because I WAS so excited to find it, but this did not disappoint in the smallest way.  This is now one of my favorites.  Buffalochef, I have never met you but you are my friend.  Thank you so much for sharing something wonderful with me.  I will look for other recipes you have posted.  Later, GF!  Judith

This is my first time to rate a recipe and this one definitely deserves 5 stars all the way! The ginger really adds great flavor so don't skip it~ I will definitely make this again and again! The only advice is to make sure you put the baking sheet underneath while the pie is baking, I put tin foil over a sheet and drippings still overflowed into the bottom of my oven... The pie was so good that the mess was worth it!

This is a beautiful pie - the flavours work really well together. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect. One of my guests, a friend for over 40 years, said this is the best pie you ever made.

Awesome recipe! Ginger adds a great flavor and the pie turned out great. Normally, I have trouble with rhubarb pies being runny but this one was perfect! My new go-to receipe for my favorite strawberry-rhubarb pie.

We thought this was just ok.  It didn't have the tartness that we like from rhubarb pie.  I did use frozen rhubarb and strawberries, so that might be why.  Or it could be from the spices, egg and lots of sugar.  I did a latice top, I didn't cover it while baking and it didn't burn.  For those that had burning issues, it could be your oven is hot.  Mine is about 25 degrees hotter than what the dial says.  Or it could be the crust I used.

I had never heard of a struesel topping being baked beneath a lattice crust.  I tried it.  Decent....  Now for me, here was the kicker.  I only allow myself 45 grams of carbohydrates per meal.  I had a slice of this pie, and had to give up 2 full meals, as one slice contained almost 90 grams of carbs.  Never again!

Everyone loved this pie. I recommend lightly beating the eggs before adding them to the mixture. And I'm not sure if it's because I'm in a low elevation or my oven temp is off, but it took about 60 min to cook the pie when I turned the heat down to 350 degrees. I used "Alan's Pie Crust" recipe for the crust and added rolled oats to the topping just because. Serve it warm with vanilla bean ice cream on the side-delicious!! I needed a recipe that didn't have gelatin as an ingredient and this worked out perfectly!

This is a fabulous recipe!    Perfect balance of tart and sweet with a little crunch in the crust.  The crumb crust under the lattice work is a nice touch.   Pick this recipe for your next family gathering, potluck or bake sale - it's a winner! 

I used a Pillsbury refrigerated crust and it paired with the flavors very well (and nobody knew!)  Instead of flour to thicken, I used 6 tablespoons of Minute (quick cooking tapioca); it held together beautifully!   Translating pints/pounds to cups:  3 cups sliced strawberries and 4 cups sliced rhubarb.

Made this pie yesterday exactly as directed, except that I did not have enough pie shells to make the lattice top; the pie shells I bought were not big/deep enough to hold all that filling! So, I doubled the crumbly topping and baked it to make a streusel topping instead. The pie was delicious and creamy! You could taste the spices--especially the nutmeg. Pretty good for nutmeg lovers, but next time, I might reverse the cinnamon and nutmeg added to the filling as I'm a cinnamon lover. Anyway, when I took the pie out of the oven, it was a little jiggly. So, the pie rested and cooled off for over an hour before we decided to each have a slice. It set nicely and there was no more jiggling! :) Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Amazing filling. Just right in sweetness and firmness.  My bottom crust was rather soggy but I will try one of the following tricks next time:   Partially baking bottom crust, preheating cookie sheet that pie plate is set on, or brushing bottom crust with egg white before adding filling.

This pie was super tasty and delicious. I did not have any crystallized ginger so I replaced it with clove and everyone loved the pie.  They also loved the mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove spice mix.

This is a perfect recipe! Not runny, unless you can't wait and eat some right out of the oven (my wife loves to do this!). Make sure the butter, flour etc.for the crust etc. are cold and refrigerated for at least an hour. Sometimes I put it in the freezer until ready to use. UAdded crushed pecans in bottom of deep dish pie plate (on top of crust) before filling it. And please, don't forget the crystallized ginger, cut into small pieces. OMG. Making a second one today, went so fast.

I like ginger, but I did not care for this pie.  The flavors didn't seem to meld at all, so some bites tasted quite gingery, and some did not.  I should have stuck to a regular strawberry-rhubarb pie, because none of us liked this one, and my 4yo kept saying, "I don't like the ginger!".

Beginning cook appreciated the details on a lattice pie crust.  Wonderful recipe. Makes a robust pie with great flavores.  Made it exactly as written and let it set up until room temp and it was perfect.   I did not have trouble with the crust burning. In fact I had to leave it in for 60 minutes for it to brown nicely.  Warmed before serving and served with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe is fantastic! I made it just as the directions said and it was a big hit. Although, you should plan to have a lot of time to put this whole thing together, especially if you make a homemade crust, which I did using this lovely recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/ruths-grandmas-pie-crust/detail.aspx

I made this pie for Easter. I thought I had too much filling, so I decided to make it in a 9x12 glass rectangular pan. I placed one crust on the bottom and then layered with walnut that I ground in the food processor before adding the pie mixture.  I used 4 cups of fresh frozen rhubarb and 2 cups of frozen strawberry (all defrosted) and I added one cup of chopped leftover plums that I had  in the freezer. I also ground the crystallized ginger in the food processor, but I think I only used two tablespoons instead of the three the recipe called for since I've never tried ginger in my strawberry-rhubarb pie before. I then placed the top crust over the crumb mixture.  This is my first attempt at doing a lattice pie top. So simple. Then I cover the pie with tin foil before placing itI placingbit on a parchment covered cookie sheet tray.  I followed the indicated baking time, took it out and placed it to cool, and then noticed that the bottom looked soggy. So, I tried again and put it back in the oven for an additional 30 minutes, took it out, looked at it, and it still didn't look fully cooked. So I think I put it back in for another 10 minutes. Is there such a thing as overcooking?  it looks perfect now.

I made this pie following the recipe exactly and it came out very runny.  It did not set up at all.  My family thought it still tasted good, but I was disappointed and will probably not make it again.

Delicious!   I did not have crystalized ginger so I added 1/8'tsp ginger.  Everyone raved about the pie, even my daughter who sad she doesn't like cinnamon said it was heavenly!

Using chilled butter is horrid. It was a pain to mix so next time I'd soften it beforehand. 

I skipped the ginger and used a full pound of defrosted and drained frozen rhubarb. I did my best to drain the fruit mixture well and had no problems with it setting up. 

I also brushed the crust with egg white. I had to cover the edges with foil half way through but that's not a big deal. Make sure to check it though so you don't burn your crust. 

I'm not normally a fan of strawberry rhubarb pie but this was great! It was a big hit at the party I took it to. I'll be making it again.

Live in Florida,so a friend of the family brought rhubarb from NY.  I tried this recipe.Everyone enjoyed it and the pie was gone in no time.
