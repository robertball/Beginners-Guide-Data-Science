I normally don't do unrated recipes.  It came out pretty good. I would advise to drain the potatoes as well as you can before mixing everything together. I will also suggest using the dried minced garlic (I believe it was calling for fresh based on the thyme).  Would I make it again? sure.

Delicious! We do not care for thyme, so I just subbed some parsley (yes, I know it's not the same, lol). LOVED the flavor of these...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good... I oven fried instead.  Use the bacon grease on the bottom of a cookie sheet, spoon on and flatten.  They needed about 15 minutes per side.  I didn't drain the potatoes but would next time.

Love this! I don't have thyme so used dried basil instead. It came out great! Definitely a keeper dish.

These were amazing. The only thing I added was half an onion, diced, to add to the savory flavors of garlic and thyme. I served it under poached eggs and ketchup. It was a hit with me and my girlfriend and we will definitely  be using this for quick weekend breakfasts in the future.

These potatoes were delicious.  I varied my herbs a bit but they were a real hit, even with my picky husband.

I usually make potato pancakes but the bacon just took it to a whole new level. I love it.

It would've been okay if it wasn't for the thyme it's to over powering. Even after I only used half the reccomend amount. Although I might try it again just with some different seasonings

We really enjoyed this recipe!  Next time I think we'll reduce the size of the potato shreds, but other than that it was great.
