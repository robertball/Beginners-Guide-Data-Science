Super easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe (except for the pineapples) and replaced the other 1/2 of the called for pieapple juice w/oj. I also used fresh onion in my meatballs and added granulated garlic and a few drops of liquid smoke and 1/4c of bbq sauce to them as well. I did also reduce the milk called for and trust me, they were still PLENTY soft. My husband thought the house smelled great when he walked in the door and was more impressed when they hit his mouth. It was too simple but I still relished in the praise! ;O) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight and it was great!  The only thing I would do differently next time is to reduce the amount of milk.  I think it was too much liquid in the meat mix... I used ground pork tonight and it worked well, too!  I would make this again :)

Very good meatballs but I thought it kind of pointless to put in the slow cooker. I boiled the sauce ingredients in a large frying pan and after rolling the meat balls I browned them in the oven, then added them to the sauce to simmer for 20 minutes. The only thing I would do differently next time is double the sauce ingredients to make sure I have enough to serve over rice. A delicious recipe.

CROCKPOT advice:  After combining all the ingredients, put them into a crockpot and cook for four to six hours.  This allows the sauce to permeate the meatballs and increases the deliciousness at least tenfold.  Short cut:  used a 2 lb. pkg. of frozen meatballs and cooked them in the microwave for ten minutes per pkg. directions.  Made a double batch of the sauce adding 1 cup of ketchup.  Used pineapple tidbits, not chunks and cut the pepper finely.

My mom loves anything w/ pineapple so I decided and my dad loves anything w/ beef, so I decided to try this recipe :) It turned out great. I had some time on my hands while my daughter napped so I made the meatballs and put them in the slow cooker on low w/ only the liquid ingredients (pineapple juice, cider vinegar, soy sauce) and the cornstarch for 3 hours. I chopped the green pepper and about 1/4 C red onion and put them in the fridge w/ the pineapple chunks. After the 3 hrs I turned the cooker up to high for 1 hr. It helped reduce the sauce so it was thicker and gooier. I turned it back to low and added the green pepper, onion and pineapple for 1 last hour. They were delicious! The sauce was a good consistency, the veggies were still slightly crisp, the pineapple was a little tender and the meatballs had time to absorb the flavors :)

These were terrific as appitizers. However I doubled the recipe and pureed the pineapple and added extra canned pineapple juice, and used very little worchester sauce. I made the pineapple "sauce" into a light glaze (with cornstarch). Thanks for the recipe...I will make again.

I tried this recipe & added another can of pineapple & 2 small cans of pineapple juice.  I can not wait to make it again and plan to triple the size so there will be leftovers for future meals!

I also doubled the recipe, and used ground pork because I had pinapple pork meatballs one time at a superbowl party that were amazing! HOWEVER, this particular recipe was lacking something, just not sure what. my boyfriend loved it however, so maybe it was just me comparing it to the others i had before.

This was a simple and easy recipe, it took me less than 15 minutes to make it. I left the Apple cider part and used white sugar instead and it was amazing. My husband couldn't stop eating. I served it over white rice and that's all it need.

While I was making this, my 8yr old son complained that my food "stunk" (apple cider vinegar). But when it came time to eat, he had 3 helpings. Yes, everyone else loved it too. It is sweet, but its still tasty!

This was edible, but only because we put it on top of noodles. The juice was too sweet and the meatballs lacked flavor. I would have to do some serious revisions to the recipe to cook it again.

So here's the thing... I didn't have an egg, green pepper, or a can of pineapples. So I hand squeezed about 4 tangerines which equaled to about a cup. I added the soy sauce, cider vinegar, and everything like normal. I added about 1/2 a tsp of minced garlic to give it a spice kick. With the meatballs I simply omitted the egg and reduced the amount of milk I used. Meatballs still turned out great. I rolled them once in the bread crumbs before baking in the oven. Very tasty, Id used this sauce with chicken as well as these meatballs.

I have made this twice now and both times were fantastic. The second time was tonight and I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I was running late and decided to make this in a pot the second time and it turned out just as delicious as the first time in the crock pot. I did not change a thing...as I think the flavors are perfect the way they are. The meatballs were moist but not too moist. My husband says this is his favorite now. The second time I served it over white rice and it was fantastic. Definitely recommend!!! Thank you for a great recipe. :)

This is good. Making meatballs was fun. 1st time. Although  you can't brown all the meatballs outsides without cooking them through. And after 15  minutes I put them in slow cooker and they cooked thoroughly. The green bell pepper is necessary and tastes like it belongs there. Good on rice.

Like other reviewers, I loved the meatball recipe.  It had a bit too much pineapple for me and not enough meatballs.  I would probably double the meatball recipe next time.  My family really liked this and will make it again.

I agree w/ other commenters sentiments that this dish is just too sweet. I used half a can of tomato paste and some water added to the sauce to try to salvage the dish. They turned out to be sweet and sour meatballs. I won't be making this dish again

These meatballs were AWESOME!  I used pre-packaged, frozen, all natural chicken/turkey meatballs with this sauce - but next time I plan to make them homemade.  The sauce is KILLER...we had 60 meatballs so I doubled the sauce recipe.  I did sautee the green peppers before putting in crockpot to soften and brown them a bit.  My husband likes a bit of kick, so I added some more soy sauce and some worchestershire to make it more tangy and not so sweet.  It was a HUGE hit and everyone loved them!!!  A VERY NICE change from the chili sauce/grape jelly sweet and sour recipe everyone makes.  These were much better!  DELICIOUS over rice, with extra "juice" drizzled on top!!!

This was pretty good!  I used store-bought, pre-made frozen meatballs.  I put the frozen meatballls in the crockpot with the sauce and cooked on low for about 3 hours and on high for about 1 hour.  Next time I will add some onion, green peppers, and carrots the last hour of cooking.

This is probably the best recipe I've tried for sweet and sour meatballs!  I had all the ingredients, and the sauce was perfect, not too sweet or too sour!

This is a delicious recipe ! I did tweak it some. I used store bought Italian style meatballs ...i also  trippled the recipe because i like a lot of  sauce. I added a cup of bbq  sauce and a cup of ketchup. I also added  2 tablespoons of  worchetshire sauce and about a tablespoons of red pepper flakes....i left the brown sugar at about a1/2 cup tho. I Iet them simmer on low  for 2 hours & the last 2 hours i put it on high and added the pineapple andva red pepper. So good

This recipe has been around in one form or another (using rice vinegar, vinegar, or as this recipe suggests) and can be found online under the name Hawaiian Meatballs.  Other recipes include Worcestershire sauce. I used Panko instead of Italian flavored breadcrumbs (to eliminate Italian flavor).  Also suggest 1 tsp garlic powder in the meatballs and a TBSP fresh ginger in sauce.

I have seen this recipe on multiple sites with tiny variations from multiple people, but mostly the same. Very Tasty either way
