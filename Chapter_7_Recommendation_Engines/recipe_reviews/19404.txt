Made this for dinner last night and what a hit it was.  As easy as this was, I will never used jarred sauces again.  I had leftover shrimp from shrimp scampi which went perfectly with the sauce.  My only addition was to add some fresh cracked pepper, a pinch of salt and garnish with a little chopped Italian parsley before serving.

This is a great fettucine alfredo recipe.  I hardly changed anything.  I switch swiss cheese for the parmesan just because I didn't have any on hand.  I did add pepper, parsley, and garlic to the sauce.  Having said this I would like to point out something I didn't understand in the recipe.  Why would you add cooked shrimp and then cook it for 15 min.  I really think that if you followed this part of the recipe you would end up with bad shrimp.  Don't add the shrimp until after you have cooked the sause for 15 min and then just heat them through.   Very simple, easy tasty recipe.

I subbed half and half for the cream and it still thickened up nicely with the addition of the parmesan.  Also added a little white pepper and salt.

Excellent recipe.  Used 1 lb of fettucine, skipped the mushrooms, used 3/4 lb of shrimp & added a couple cloves of minced garlic & some parsley.  Almost had to wrestle it away from my BF!  Awesome.

I put my 1/2 stick butter in the pan and a few T of flour to make a rouix then whisked in half and half instead of heavy cream; added some garlic powder and salt, pepper and  onion powder and a jar of mushrooms...  I didn't have any fettucine so I used mini farfalle; I think they meant to use raw shrimp since the directions have you cook so long but I added my cooked shrimp during last few minutes and just heated until they were hot.   Sprinkled in some fresh parsley and parmesan cheese!  Thanks

Very easy...very quick....very good! I really enjoyed this recipe. I made mine with angel hair pasta and 5 cheese garlic bread and it was really good. I sauteed my shrimp in butter and garlc for just a few seconds, long enough to turn pink, set aside until the last 5 minutes on the sauce, then iI added the shrimp and they turned out great. Not over cooked, or chewy. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!!!

If you want your sauce to be thick I would recommend that you cook the mushrooms separately. I used more shrimp and more fettucine than the recipe called for. I also used pre-cooked shrimp and added the shrimp and the cooked mushrooms to the sauce just before serving. It was an easy dinner and a big hit!

The mushrooms made flavor in this dish, would however add more shrimp. I doubled the recipe, big family! I used a 1 pound of shrimp, but didn't thicken I like I wanted--guess I'm picky. I don't like runny, I like real creamy sauces. But I added Konjac glucomannan powder used like cornstarch about 3 teaspoons for doubling  the recipe(if your curious I bought the powder from miracle noodle dot com--it's amazing). I cooked the pound of shrimp with 2 tbsp butter 1 tbsp of fresh minced parsley & 1 tbsp minced garlic. Then added it to the cream mixture. But would add more shrimp the next time I make this. I soo will make this again. Flavors in this dish just popped! YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!

Super EASY to make!  The sauce was very thin though.  I followed the directions without any changes, but it was "soupy" sauce.  Excellent flavor though!!  Made this with garlic bread but had to serve this pasta in a bowl due to the sauce consistency.

Very good, easy & quick. I added some diced red pepper & fresh garlic, and some Italian seasoning. I also used half & half instead of cream & it worked just fine. Served with a tossed green salad & italian bread...perfect meal!

This is awesome!  I used Chicken stock instead of the wine, doubled the garlic and added sliced baby portabello mushrooms and increased the butter a bit and added evoo.  It was so awesome and makes great leftovers too!  Will definetly make again.  It will be a great Christmas dish - can't wait to use again!  Thanks for the post Kimberly!

I really messed this up. Not sure what went wrong, but my sauce never thickened, so it was really soupy. I made this just as the recipe stated besides adding a clove of garlic.  I probably won't make again.

Due to the HIGH fat content, I used 1/2 and 1/2 cream and low fat margarine.  It still tasted absolutely wonderful since you also add parmesan cheese.

I truly hate to give a less than optimal rating but this was just waaaaaay too thick.  Fetuccine alfredo is a favorite of mine at Olive Garden but this wasn't even close.  "Heart attack on a plate" is what I call Fetuccine Alfredo...............and this was maxxed out on cholesterol.

This was my first attempt at making fettuccini alfredo and I was really nervous about how it would turn out, but I shouldn't have been.  This was so easy to make and my kids, who are kinda picky, ate it up!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Saute garlic and onion in tablespoon of butter until clear. Add mushrooms and red bell pepper and 1/2 stick of butter. Then add fresh shrimp seasoned with salt and black and red pepper over medium-low heat. Add sour cream and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream with teaspoon or less of corn starch to thicken and parmesan cheese.

It's unfortunate for my waistline that I have this recipe.  I had mushrooms and cream and went in search of a good alfredo.  I didn't have any shrimp, but did as others suggested and added garlic powder and capers.  I am in heaven.  My only problems are going to be making this too often and not being able to eat enough at one sitting.  I did cook it a bit longer and felt the consistency I got was perfect.  Thanks for this easy recipe that even my toddler enjoys.

This was pretty good.  Like another reviewer said the sauce was very soupy.  I added minced garlic and parsley for a little more flavor.  I will try thickening it with a little flour or cornstarch the next though.

Super easy and very good.  I added a bit of garlic powder for a little added kick of flavor.  I also ended up added a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce quicker.  I'd make this again and again.

My family really enjoys this alfredo.  I add sauted capers and mushrooms to it, and it is awesome.

Would not cook already cooked shrimp 15 minutes but other than that thought it was a nice easy adaptable recipe.

This dish was delicious!  The only changes I made were:  I used 1 lb lg. shrimp, added 1 t. garlic powder, 1 pkg. fresh spinach and used macaroni because I had some leftover pasta from another meal.  Loved the flavor of this dish. YUM.....

I used this recipe for my annual Chrsitmas Dinner party with 2 variations
I cooked the shrimp in olive oil( from Apulia, Italy) finely chopped garlic and shallots.  I tossed linguini, the shrimp and al dente asparagus pieces into the alfredo sauce.  The dish won rave reviews. Carmella D.

This was absolutely wonderful, and could definitely be restaurant quality! I sauteed my shrimp in garlic, and also added 1 tsp of garlic to the sauce. I cooked this for a romantic dinner and my guest loved it. I'll definitely be making this one again...thanks for the great recipe!

My family really liekd this recipe.  It was SOOO easy and so yummy!  I didn't have but a half a pint of heavy whipping cream so I subsituted the the other half pint with 1% milk and it came out great.  I was worried it wouldn't be as thick but it was REALLY thick!  Great recipe...thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe. I put olive oil, garlic salt, & pepper to shrimp before cooking. I also after done cooking everything, I let stand for 5 minutes so, that sauce could thicken. Other than that, great recipe! My family and I enjoyed this dish!

For best results, mix the parmesan in with the butter and cream prior to adding the shrimp and mushrooms.

Easy and economical. With my shrimp I seasoned them with Old Bay seasoning  and garlic powder while sautéing with butter. I added all the ingredients along with some freshly hand grated Asiago cheese. Yes I said hand grated bc me and cooking are not friends. Lol. I also added parsley to then sauce and let it simmer. It didn’t come out as thick as i would have liked but I think it’s due to the extra cheese I used. But my sauce was not bland.

really easy. i used fresh large shrimp and sauteed them till just about done, then added to the sauce with about 5 mins left to simmer and they were perfect. i like fresh shrimp as opposed to precooked as i am very particular about how they are cleaned. garnished with green onions. nice and light for summer. family loved it!

I doubled this for a family vacation to a cabin in the winter. Tastes delicious (especially with portabella mushrooms) but a little TOO rich with all the butter and heavy cream.  Put me and my family either out on the couch or fast asleep!

I am not a big white sauce fan but since my husband and daughter are, I made this. I loved it! I thought the sauce was the best white sauce I have ever tasted. It was so good. This will be a regular at our home for sure. It was so simple and easy but incredibly delicious. Try it.

It was better than average. I added smashed garlic, onion powder, parsley, oregano, and corn starch. Also substituted a few ounces of cream of mushroom as I don't like fresh mushroom much. Would have given 3 stars otherwise for lack of flavors.

This recipe was really good! The only alteration I made was adding a clove if minced garlic when it was nearly done. However I thought the alfredo was a bit thin.. Next time I might add some flour to help thicken it.

I used more shrimp, added parsley and green onions for color, added black pepper, scrapped the mushrooms (I hate mushrooms!), and used less fettuccine. My only complaint is that it was too soupy. I was hoping for a thicker sauce.

Doubled the recipe and served it to my mom friends at a weekend get-away.  Everyone LOVED it.  I had extra and ate it for lunch the next day.  The flavors blended even more overnight.  So good!   (The mushrooms made it extra yummy.)

I loved this recipe. I din't change much. I used twice the amount of shrimp because I knew my son would be picking them out and eating them. I diced the mushrooms to very small pieces b/c I love the flavor but hate the texture and then I sauted them for a bit with the shrimp. I also added garlic powder to the sauce.
Served with a Romaine salad and garlic bread and it was delicious...

The sauce was good but I made some changes. I cooked some bacon, then heated up some thawed grilled chicken strips, a clove of garlic and the mushrooms in the drippings. I let the sauce thicken without shrimp then added the above ingredients as well as a pinch of salt and freshl ground pepper and a head of steamed broccloi. My husband said it was worthy of a dinner party! yum
