I've made this nice light torte a few times now and it turns out perfectly every time.  It has a beautiful almond flavor (although I used almond extract rather than Amaretto) and looks impressive when sliced.

Beautiful presentation great flavor! I often use almond (or even vanilla) extract in place of the amaretto. An excellent recipe and lowfat, too!
