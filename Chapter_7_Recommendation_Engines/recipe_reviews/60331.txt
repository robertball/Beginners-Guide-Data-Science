I had every intention on following the recipe as stated, but decided at the last minute to use sun dried tomato pesto in place on the honey and tomato paste (less time and mess).   I also added a sprinkle of asiago cheese!  I only cooked for 25 minutes and the cheese looked burn't.  Next time I will add more cheese but put on the last 5 minutes.  My kids really liked this for an after school snack.

This is really good and super easy.  Like other review do not put cheese on until last or it will burn.  Also, I thought the amount of tomato paste was a little to much.  Next time I will cut in half.  Otherwise very yummy.

My bread turned out more like a super-tomato pizza. Stabbing the dough with a fork did nothing productive, there was too much tomato paste and I'm pretty sure that I should have left it rise a little more. The directions said nothing of this, I was a little tooo trusting. My bad.

We really liked this recipe. My honey had crystalized, so I squirted what I thought was a tablespoon in there. Not really sure though. I know some people said they thought the tomato paste was too much. There's plenty on it, but I liked it that way. I wasn't able to get the dough into a true circle, but it didn't really matter to me. I put grated parm cheese on the last 15 minutes and didn't have any problems with it burning. Served it with marinated chicken, and grilled sweet potatoes, yukon gold potatoes and carrots. Perfect. Will be making again!
