Very good. The only thing different was that I used apple juice and regular vinegar. If you like you sauce to be saucy double or even triple the sauce recipe.

I did some research online for substitutes for rice wine, if you don't have rice wine you can use gin instead. I've used it before and it worked pretty good.

I haven't tried other recipes yet but this one had ingredients I had on-hand (though I had to sub apple juice for both rice wine and rice vinegar) but the end result was pretty good! I think I need to cook in the oil longer next time but overall it was a great meal and leftovers just as good! Thank's Joe!

This recipe was good!  I didn't have rice wine and substituted white wine.  It turned out fine.  I also didn't have small red chilies so I substituted crushed red pepper and sprinkled that in to taste.  I did chop one half of a poblano pepper to give the meal a "green" taste and not just heat.  Other additions were that that I cut up one large head of broccoli and sauteed that with onion slivers and the poblano pepper in a ginger-based stir fry oil.  (The best General Tso's chicken I ever had contained broccoli; the standard recipe is very unhealthy if you make it without vegetables.)  When finished, I tossed the whole thing with green onions and sprinkled some chopped peanuts on top.  Authentic General Tso?  Maybe not.  Absolutely delicious?  Yes.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely loved this recipe. While it is time consuming, I took the advice of doing the chicken earlier in the afternoon. I used white wine instead of rice wine. I also took the advice to make extra sauce and doubled that part of the recipe - next time I will triple or quadruple it!! I wasn't familiar with the kind of hot peppers used, so I put 1 1/2 Tbsps. of crushed chili into the doubled sauce and it, for us, was the perfect heat. I put one red bell pepper and 2 ribs of celery in, to add some vegetables, and finished with 4 chopped green onions and 1/2 cup of white sesame seeds. This will be made again, and again, and....

This tasted ok, but it definitly didn't taste like the take out that we love.  The soy sauce taste was overpowering.  Not bad for a  chicken dinner, but it just wasn't right

I like it some, but there are some things that I would mention. First, rice wine. I dunno what it was, so i tried it. Next, soy sauce. I didn't add any of that because my family hates it. We had a great mandarin sauce that I like to put on meatballs and drizzled it with that. Delicious! Last, pepper pods. Not that much flavor. So I rate only 3 stars. Nice try on the recipe, but didn't like the things above. Other than that, an OK recipe.

This was great, Joe!  I prepared the chicken without breading, but the sauce was terrific!  Used the chicken and the sauce with some mixed veggies and rice to make a fabulous rice bowl.  Thanks for the tip about the gin, too!  Works great!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I don't often make Chinese food mainly because it is not my forte. But I have been making it more and more these days. I also did my research about rice wine and I read you can sub out dry sherry or white wine. I made 4 lbs of chicken on Sunday and started making hours before the guests arrived. I did 1 lb at a time and when each batch was done, I put it all into baking dishes and warmed in the oven before we were ready to eat. I was a little concerned how the batter would stand up after a couple of hours but it turned out perfect!

The taste was fantastic!  The recipe actually took longer to make, but only due to my small deep fryer.  The sauce was easy and so good, it actually surprised me.

The recipe was okay, but I don't think it was much like the General Tso's chicken that I usually get as take-out. Maybe that was because I used sherry as I didn't have rice wine?  I doubled the recipe and the sauce, but the sauce evaporated away as soon as it hit the hot pan. I'll probably continue to look for a recipe more to my liking for this dish.

Yes, this was very good!!! Though i have a hard time finding the right ingredients, it came out to be so delicious.  No more Chinese takeout.  It was easy to make too.  Somebody read my review, is there a way to make the chicken crispier without overdrying.  Please advise.  Thanks...

I have made this recipe a few times and my husband and I love it! I have made the recipe as written and at the suggestion of others I used apple juice and white vinegar. Tastewise I prefer to use apple juice and white vinegar. They are also ingredients that I tend to have on hand,which makes the recipe easier. I also triple the sauce.

This is a very tasty version of General Tso's Chicken! I cooked in a deep fat fryer, as recommended. I served with Serrano chiles, because my grocery store does not stock dried red pepper pods, and I did not have time to order them. I served it over white rice.

Love this one!! My kids like it because it tastes like take out.  I have made it with tofu instead of chicken, and I do't use exactly the same ingredients for the sauce...and it is still amazing. Thanks

I added broccoli, peas, and jalapeños for an extra kick, however it did need more sauce. Not sure if it tastes exactly like the restaurant version, but I thought it was delicious!

I've been wanting a really yummy Chinese recipe and am so glad I found this one. Thanks Joe! Love how the rice wine, vinegar, sweetness, and soy sauce come together in this. The sauce is so delicious as it is (but like one of the previous reviews said, I did need to increase the amount of sauce..tried doubling but ended up making quadruple the amount of sauce to fully coat the 1.5 lbs of chicken pieces I fried). I also used a large sweet onion and a green bell diced small instead of green onions and chili peppers. Added a couple teaspoons of red pepper flakes to put the spice back in. One other adjustment...out of habit, I just had to put the cornstarch & egg-coated chicken pieces on a plater of flour for an extra coat of crispy before frying...not sure if that's necessary though!

I saw this recipe and it looked appetizing  so i decided to make it. And it did not disappoint.  My family enjoyed it very much. However I used chicken breast, added fresh ginger and instead of rice wine I used white wine vinegar. It came out great for my taste but like another review stated if you like it more saucey. You have to double or triple sauce ingredients. Thanks for good recipe.

The breading and sauce both came out spectacularly. Initially it looks very much like tempura but, once the sauce is added, it starts looking very familiar. While it didn't taste like take out, I find most low end Chinese food has an oily presence that makes me feel ill. This was not like that at all which allowed me to enjoy the taste much more.

Not a bad recipe, but not the best either...at least it's not a difficult one.  
One big error however is the suggestion of substituting gin for the rice wine; a better substitution is dry sherry, which many Chinese chefs have stated is much closer to the character of Chinese rice wine.

The recipe appealed to me because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It tastes OK, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  It does not taste like General Tso's at all, and I've made better generic stir-fry sauces.  It is not bad, but I don't like it enough to make this one again.

We just finished dinner. This was a very good recipe. I added fresh carrots and canned pineapple with the juice too. As someone has mentioned, if you like it saucy, triple the sauce. Also, for kids you should probably add fewer peppers. I think three would be fine. I will make this again.

Very good! I didn’t have rice wine so I substituted white wine vinegar. I doubled the sauce recipe and I would suggest every tripling it. I like my dishes a little more saucy and with the doubles recipe the chicken was barely glazed

I substituted the chili’s for tuong ot toi Vietnam chili garlic sauce. The garlic gave it the extra kick and it was just the right amount of heat. This was super easy to make. I didn’t have rice wine so I will be remaking to include this ingredient. I am serving it with broccoli because that is how my family likes it. Try making this one, guaranty favorite.??

I love General Tsos chicken and made this a couple of times. There are other General Tsos recipes here, but to me this is the easiest, with the least number of ingredients, and a faithful version of the original. I doubled the sauce. Used a dry sake for the rice wine and red pepper flakes for the heat since it's difficult finding red chili peppers. Added diced carrots, chopped onions and broccoli crowns to the fryer before adding the chicken to finish up. Thanks, Joe!

The taste was exquisite! I followed the reviews of others and doubled the sauce but my husband said he would have loved more so next time I will try adding some chicken broth at the end. This is not a quick recipe, so plan it for a night when you have lots of time.

Loved it. Didn't have access to the red chillies, they are market specific here. I used 3 tsp red pepper flakes. Other than that, no substitutions in the directions. I made typical fried rice, served the chicken with broccoli. Chicken wasn't as crunchy as I had hoped, it was before I mixed everything together, so I'm sure that was my fault, I will perfect this. Thanks Joe!

Great flavor! I used two pretty good size chicken breast. (Probably 11/2-2 lbs) so I was a little short on the delicious sauce! I didn’t have thighs but the breast worked great! I also didn’t have any sake’ (rice wine). Don’t think you’d be able to tell unless you tried both, one right after the other. I wouldn’t hesitate to double sauce. It is really good!

This is my new go-to recipe for General Tso's chicken.  The batter was like a tempura and it browned up quickly on the chicken.  The only change I would make is to double the sauce - everyone seemed to wish there was more.  Delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe Joe!

I followed recipe exact except used Moscato wine instead of rice wine.. And used Mexican dried chile peppers (ended up burning and didnt seem to add spicy kick). Also, my meat thermometer only goes up to 220°F so i wasn't exactly sure what temp oil was at but at some point it started to really smoke and i dialed stove top down to steady 3-4 heat and chicken (marinated in soy sauce for hours before sliced to thin, small bite size pieces) fried great for 2-3min for doneness. Didn't taste like General Tso, but it was good.

It was a little salty. I would recommend either low-sodium soy sauce or adjusting the ratio of soy sauce to the other liquids. It also wasn’t spicy enough. I think next time I would just mix in crushed red pepper flakes.

Didn't have dry red peppers so I used 3 thinly sliced Serrano peppers and used about 1/3 of the seeds to give it just the right amount of heat. Came out great.

This was superb!  I followed the recipe, but left out the hot peppers, and added a bit of Thai chili paste.  We are not fans of hot spices.  This was just right.  My husband said it was one of the best meals ever.  I served it with steamed broccoli/cauliflower and rice pilaf.

This is very easy! I fried chunks of chicken, and used crushed red pepper instead of red pepper pods due to availability. 

I substituted an ordinary white wine for the rice wine, and Splenda for the sugar so that someone who's had bariatric surgery could enjoy it.  A little more water was needed to make the sauce come out properly. If you're missing this dish, go ahead and make this version!

He likes it even better done with chunks of breaded pork tenderloin!

Great taste. And I would say, it's a 'forgiving' dish if you're not very confident in your own cooking abilities. I'm giving it 5 stars even though mine turned out a little less intense than I expected. I think it's important to have temperatures correct for this. My oil was a little under temp so my chicken pieces came out a little pale. Still tasty, but not that deep golden color. And when I added the chilies I burned them because my oil was too hot. Still a great dish, but I think I might need to give it another try. 5 stars because even with my mistakes it turned out better than my expectations.

The first time I made it, there didn't seem to be anywhere near enough sauce, and it wasn't great. The second time, I doubled the sauce and it turned out exactly how I wanted it.

I used gin instead of rice wine and honey instead of sugar. I used peanut oil for frying the chicken. I served it over white rice with steamed broccoli.

This turned out better than I've had from the local Chinese restaurant.

We didn't care for this one too much. More work than the flavor & texture were worth in my opinion.

I made this using seitan instead of chicken. It was delicious! I doubled the sauce and threw in lightly steamed broccoli. Thank you, Joe!

I made this, changed it a tiny bit, used red pepper flakes and about 10 ounces of orange soda cooked down and regular vinegar.  My grown boys said it was better than the restaurants!  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I make this meal just about every two weeks. My Mother In-law and husband get so excited when I say I'm making General Tso's Chicken. Sometimes I substitute dried red pepper pods with chili paste for when I don't have Dried peppers. Or even dehydrated red pepper flakes! When making the sauce I always make sure to add 3x more than the recipe calls for just so I have enough to pour over my rice. Great recipe and I've shared it with a few friends & family members.

This was delicious! I added a dash of ginger, Chinese five spice, sesame seeds, onion powder for green onions and crushed red pepper flaked instead of pepper pods. I also added a little coconut palm sugar in addition to the white sugar for a little extra sweetness. Make sure on last step not to use too much oil when mixing in the marinade or all your hard work will be ruined. You can always add a little more but cant's remove it if you add too much...Scrumptious!

Now this was a magnificent recipe...!

I made a few tweaks to it...:

Added cumin and turmeric to the eggs and cornstarch prior to dipping the chicken chunks in.

Fully cooked all of the chicken and allowed it to drain and begin to cool prior to beginning the sauce.

Doubled the sauce recipe - a whole jar of orange marmalade + about 1/3 of a cup of low sodium soy sauce + half an orange + dried red pepper pods + 1/4 cup of molasses (eliminated the white sugar). In addition, right at the very end I mixed 3T of corn starch along with about 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and mixed prior to adding to the sauce.

Once the sauce was thick and bubbling I poured it over the chicken chunks. Stirred and stirred and stirred to make sure that each and every chunk was coated. Then put all of this in a 350 degree oven for about 20-25 minutes.

Came out absolutely brilliant....will definitely be making this again.

Not the same as "take out"...much, much, MUCH better!!! A+++++

I didn't have rice wine so I used red wine vinegar and didn't have the red peppers.  I 3x the sauce recipe and it turned out really good.  Everybody loved it.

Turned out really well, despite not having any red peppers available. Substituted with paprika and black pepper powder and it still turned out delicious. I'll definitely be making this again. However I do wish that the instruction about mixing the sugar, soy, cornstarch in a small bowl was labeled as a separate step asi almost ran right over it
