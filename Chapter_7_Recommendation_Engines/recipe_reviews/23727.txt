adding less rice and more mushrooms makes it even better.

Very tasty-I added an extra egg to the mixture to bind it better

The flavor of this was really good and I love that all the ingredients are real food- no packets/cans necessary.  I gave it four stars instead of 5 because of the long cooking time! I made it as stated except I used brown rice.  Next time I will try the extra egg thing and play with the lentil/rice ratio so it can be more of a protein main course.  My whole family loved it!

Absolutely delicious. The two eggs instead of one is integral for keeping it firm and bound. I used half mushroom and green pepper spaghetti sauce mixed with some organic ketchup on top and it was wonderful. Great meal and I'm looking forward to the leftover lentils and rice for lunch tomorrow or a soup tomorrow night.

The flavor of this "meatloaf" was very good however it would not hold together.

I'm sorry but this was awful. It was very dry and bland. Will not make again.

it wasn't bad but i really didn't care for it per the recipe. if i make it again i'll put some spaghetti sauce into the loaf and top it with that instead of the ketchup. i think it was just a little dry for my taste.

This was alright but for the amount of time it took to cook I wouldn't do it again. I really think the ketsup was a bad idea too.

Good flavor (especially after I added a dash of salt) but I agree that it didn't hold together too well. An extra egg would probably help. I also think BBQ sauce or some other glaze would be good.

I gave this 4 stars because I did take the recommendations for using 2 eggs adding more mushrooms (since I love mushrooms). I also replaced the ketchup with barbeque sauce (since I don't like ketchup) and I boiled the rice and lentils in vegetable stock for added flavor. With these adjustments, this recipe is delicious! I will be making it again!

I was a good recipe and I will make it again. I added two eggs and it bound well. I also read about the bland taste complaints so instead of ketchup in top I did a marinara with hot salsa mix. It added a lot of flavor.

I used a 6 oz can of tomato paste in lieu of the eggs to make this vegan. Also added 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs and 2 tablespoons Sweet Baby Ray' s BBQ sauce to the mixture and baked in a 9x13 pan. For the topping I used equal parts ketchup mustard and brown sugar...yum!

It's a very good alternative to meat however I added a bunch more spices real garlic fresh basil thyme I cooked the mushrooms w the garlic and onions and added eggs and breadcrumbs. It's a good base but you def gotta jazz it up with your personal touches.

I made this for Thanksgiving and really enjoyed it. Instead of eggs I used flax meal as a binder (so it was vegan) and omitted the ketchup. The top got a bit crunchy without the ketchup but it wasn't too bad. We'll be making this again.

Just made this for Christmas dinner and it is pretty good. It is quite under seasoned though. I used fresh garlic double the spices and also added half another onion too. I despise under cooked mushrooms so I sauted them with the onions. Mine turned out a smudge soggy but may have been undercooked. Overall I love this recipe & will keep tweaking until it is perfect per my taste buds.
