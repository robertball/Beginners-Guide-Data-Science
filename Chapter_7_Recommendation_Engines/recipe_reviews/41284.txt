Good recipe.  My kids are picky eaters so I had to leave out the mushrooms and horseradish, but it was still good and easy to prepare.  I will make this again.

These were good, and so easy! My kids have renamed them hamburgers without the buns. I started out using fresh ground round and was surprised that there were hardly any drippings in the pan to drain. I followed the other suggestions and added some worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, which definetely added a nice flavor. If I were to make them again (and I probably will) I wouldn't go out of my way for the green onions--it may have been my onions but they just didn't add enough to the flavor, I would have prefered a regular old onion in there.

So simple and so good.  I didn't have all the ingredients on-hand and did some creative substituting and it was delicious.  I used French's french fried onions instead of the green onions, skipped the horseradish (didn't have any) and used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  Served with mashed potatoes.  My picky 3 year old cleaned her plate.  My picky 33 year old did too!  Anything that can please both husband and child will become a regular in the dinner rotation.  I'll be making again.

Easy to make and very tasty. I used roasted garlic & beef gravy. The combination of garlic and horseradish gave this dish a delightful tang. The meat came out tender and moist and bursting with flavor.

These beef patties had great flavor.  I made gravy instead of the bottled stuff.  You definitely need to try this!!

Ok so this is nothing fancy but it's great for when you're pushed for time and/or low on groceries. The only changes I made were to use very finely diced regular onion, I omitted the water from the gravy, and I added a lot more horseradish. Like others have said, this is great comfort food (even for a warm day). Thanks!

This is good! Perfect for a cold day's dinner. I made them last night according to the directions and when heating up leftovers today for lunch I did add some Worcestershire sauce -- which made it even better. The mustard, horseradish, and green onions are wonderful additions. Great comfort food!

I loved not only the end result, but the ease of getting there.  Very quick, easy and delicious.  I added the Worcestershire Sauce as someone else suggested and put the horseradish in with the meat as also suggested.

These are just like salsbury steaks...just make them flatter and fry them up..top with a homemade beef gravy (don't use jarred stuff...it isn't the same)...before this recipe my husband thought that the only way to get salsbury steak was to do a frozen dinner....

Very quick easy - less then 5 minutes of prep time - and the horseradish added a very nice flavor to the gravy.

Great comfort food!  I too added worchester sauce to the meat, and I put half the horse radish to the meat and the other half in the gravy.  Don't skip this ingredient--lends a nice flavor.

This was great my family enjoyed every bit. They stated this is better than just regular hamburgers. I always look for something new  or different to enjoy and I will make this again.

This was very good. We omitted the mushrooms, since we don't care for them. I put the horseradish in the patties, rather than in the gravy. I also sauteed some onions in butter, then made homemade gravy, rather than using jarred, and poured that over the patties. My husband says this is a definite keeper.

The horseradish was really overpowering in this and both DH and I love horseradish. DH thought it might taste better if the horseradish was mixed into the burger instead of the gravy. I agree, but probably will not be making this again to try it.

My husband says this is a keeper. The horseradish gives it a nice bit of zing to make the dish terrific.
