YUMMY!  Very rich so a small piece does it, (but my tastebuds and mind have to be contained!)  I will keep this for special decadence desserts.

I try to avoid flour and this recipe does that.

Only bake for the total of 15 minutes as indicated. The torte will firm up as it cools. Over baking will result in a dry torte.

The torte came out perfect. Since I couldn’t find my spring pan I used a low sided 9” round and cut parchment paper to fit the bottom and a strip for around the inside of the pan. I followed the advice of another reviewer to make sure I didn’t bake for more than the total 15 minutes. Made all the difference from the first time I made. The parchment on the sides made for nice smooth side and the edges didn’t crumble. Great recipe! My guests loved it!

I made this for my daughter's birthday, as she is gluten intolerant. She says it is her new favorite cake. I did find that t has to bake a lot longer than indicated(the recipe says 5 minutes uncovered, then 10 minutes covered). It has to bake for  more like 40 minutes.

I will make it again for a large function, because this is a lot of chocolate for a family of 4! Very very rich as another reviewer mentioned, so it will feed a LOT of ppl sliced thinly. And it was very easy to make!!!
