OK, I know I'm not supposed to review if I changed the recipe, but these were THE MOST amazing beans I have had outside of an authentic BBQ restaurant.  First of all, the only things that I changed were 1) I omitted the meat because I wanted a vegetarian-friendly side dish, and 2) I just dumped everything in the slow cooker and let it cook on low for a few hours.  AMAZING!!!  I will be making these beans often because EVERYONE raved about them.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Love them beans! BBQ sauce and brown sugar give this a great flavor. I threw some Jim Beam in there as well instead of the cider vinegar.

This was a great recipe.  I knew my husband would like it, but the kids really liked it to.  I prepared everything the night before and let it sit in the slow cooker all day.   It would have been really great with some corn bread. This did make a HUGE amount, so don't make the full amount if you don't want leftovers.

We loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly except I substituted Butter beans for the lima beans and great northern beans for the kidney beans.  I took this to a small group meeting and everyone loved it!  Will make again very soon!

Thanks for sharing this Tom in MN.  My mother-in-law used to make this years ago and I had forgotten all about it!  It is truly great - one of my favorite bean dishes.

Did not like much. The bbq sauce was just a too strong and overpowering taste. Next time will stick with the basics:pork n beans + ground turkey

Absolutely, loved it.  I'm not a fan of Lima's so I will omit them next time and replace them with another bean.  There was nothing left in my crockpot when I went to get it at my family reunion.

A wonderful recipe.  Will make again and again.  I left out the lima beans though because my family does not care for them.  Very tasty and sweet.
