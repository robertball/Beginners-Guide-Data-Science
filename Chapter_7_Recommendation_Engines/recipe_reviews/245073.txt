Used a little over a pound of meat, otherwise as given. Found it to be so incredibly salty as to be inedible. Used Hidden Valley Ranch mix. If I do ever try this again, I'll just use the spices from a ranch dressing recipe and skip most of the salt.

If you are not used to Hidden Valley Ranch packets then this would taste too salty. I would suggest 1 packet for over a pound of meat. Otherwise I loved this meatloaf and my boys ate it too!

I made this tonight but mine does not look like that photo! taste is good and it was super easy to put together. I would probably double this to feed four people but it is an OK size for two.

I love ranch dressing, but this meatloaf was pretty blah. Hidden Valley Ranch works much better in burgers.

First try at meatloaf and it tasted pretty good. For decent sized loaf, I suggest 2lbs of ground beef(adjust other ingredients also)

I made this and I like it a lot. I made a slightly larger loaf, and adjusted the ingredients accordingly. I did not feel that it was too salty, and I don't like a lot of salt. I did not add any sauce on the top as in the photo, or put any on it at table. I thought it was fine the way it was. I will make this again.

Loved this. It took longer to cook in my oven but everything else I did as the recipe calls. Amazing. Next time I am going to try to make my own ranch seasoning because the one I used had msg.
