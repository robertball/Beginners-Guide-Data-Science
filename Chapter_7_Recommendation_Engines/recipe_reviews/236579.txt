Mahalo (Thank you) for this amazing Mahi Mahi dish. I thought adding the Artichoke and Sun-Dried tomatoes would overpower this beautiful fish. But both held their own like a Hula to a full moon black sand beach...  Ok, enough of that! This was really good and fun to make.  I served it with creamed spinach and next time some rice would be nice but today trying to cut back on the carbs. Try this one for a special "lent" night dinner with someone special. Mahi Mahi is expensive here in the upper Midwest but I can picture this using whole Trout or even Tilapia filets would be just as fine.  Aloha nui loa

Read the recipe ingredient list and knew this would be good.  I guesstimated the amounts.  But the ingredients blended together so wonderfully, I doubt I ever will measure.  I made one change to the directions: my mahi mahi was quite thick so I seared it on both sides and set it aside.  I prepared the sauce in that fry pan.  At the point the sauce started to thicken, I added the remaining vegetables and returned the fish to finish cooking in the sauce.  Delicious!  I think this sauce would also work with chicken breasts as well.  Might also add sliced mushrooms next time.  Will definitely make again!

This was great.  I did adjust it a little.  I thought the garlic was a little much, so I cut it by half.  I used onion instead of shallots because I didn't have any.  My husband loved it.  I will make this again.

This was good but a little to lemony for me in the sauce. I did half of the lemon, 2 tbls chicken broth and added some capers. Honey said this is a keeper.

Lovely accent to fresh or flash frozen MahiMahi. I used half the butter  and 2-3 T EVOO initially. I used Trader Joe's artichokes , sliced the garlic and used twice as much shallot as the recipe called for in the original recipe.
I look forward to using the artichoke, tomato , shallot and garlic for other pan seared fish. I made enough sauce to also sauce the pasta I served with the fish.

I switched out the butter for Smart Balance alternative and used less salt.  Great initial recipe...much better after tweaking

I wanted to like this more.  I forgot to get garlic at the store and used dried so maybe that was the difference. Though really I think it was that the artichoke soaked in the lemon juice and every bite of it was overwhelmingly tart.  It was so strange.  I suggest less lemon juice.  I would also use less butter. It was a tad greasy and would have been okay with less.  But it wasn't bad.  I would just make a few adjustments.

I made this for my boyfriend last night, I often get a "that was good", but this one he says, "that was an A+ dinner"  He loved every bite.  The only thing I did different is add a little more Artichoke hearts because we love them!

We really liked this recipe.  We like lots of sauce, so I doubled it for the two of us.  Next time I would add more of the veggies.

I made this dish "as is" except quadrupled the recipe for our annual "fish soiree" the Saturday before Christmas.  Well, I made enough servings for 18 people.  I just eyeballed how much of each ingredient and I had 16 raves and 8 requests for the recipe.  You can also add more or less of the ingredients  according to your own tastes (artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, salt, pepper, etc.).    I did use half the oil in the sun dried tomatoes to give it a little extra flavor and that was a good call.  There were two portions left over and my husband and I had those for dinner Christmas Eve.  Was just as good as the day I made this dish. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It is now a part of our friends and family gathering before the Christmas holidays.

This dish was excellent and so worth the effort!! Prep time for me was more like an hour. On the first go-round, the sauce burned. ?? On round 2, I turned the flame down to barely visible and the result was better. The sauce did not emulsify but that's ok, it was delicious! Practice makes perfect.

We loved it, and I'm not much of a fish eater--I.m also on a Keto diet.  As such I didn't dredge the fish in flour, just followed the recipe with out it.  I used dry sherry instead of white wine.

I followed previous advice and reduced lemon to 3 T but would do 5 next time. Much less flour is needed. I will check my labels on artichokes and sun dried tomatoes, & seasoning next time as it was saltier than I prefer but overall ver nice.

As Guy would say, this stuff would be good on a flip flop. I double the sauce recipe every time I make it.

This was really tasty, I did decrease the amount of garlic by about 1/2. I'd make it again.

The mahi cooked up beautifully in the flour and seasoned salt mixture.  However, the garlic ended up burning to a crisp and had to be removed from the sauce mixture to make the sauce even near edible.  I think instead of finely chopped it should be sliced paper thin so it virtually melts into the sauce mixture as it cooks down.  We love sun dried tomatoes and artichokes but just not the right combo or flavor profile for the mahi.

This was tasty. I would suggest cutting back on the lemon juice just a little. It was slightly overpowering.

I loved this!  I gave it 4 stars because I think it has too much butter and not enough white wine as written.  I'm going to make again and play around with it but I really enjoyed this dish.  Having family week soon at the beach and this is what I am making.  I can't wait!
