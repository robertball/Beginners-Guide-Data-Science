This was very good. Even my kids loved it. We ate it spread on whole wheat toast for lunch. I didn't have celery seed, so I used just a little celery salt and omitted the plain table salt.

Very good.  A tasty way to get protein into you diet.  Next time I'll probably use less garlic powder and omit the celery seed.

Great way to liven up cottage cheese when you're on a diet! I used Morten's light salt and spread this over rye melba toast.  Very tasty!

Mmmmm!!! Sooo good. I've been making this for several months now and have no clue why I haven't left a review. I have two tubs sitting in my fridge right now. My boyfriend LOVES it and he HATES cottage cheese. This is a great treat if you're health conscious or dieting. Also, BE SURE TO LET THIS SIT IN THE FRIDGE OVERNIGHT BEFORE SERVING. The flavor isn't half as intense as it will be the following day, and when I don't have chives, I just sub green onions. Just as good, the onions may be "spicier," but delish!

Not complicated, not sophisticated and really not even a recipe.  It's just good!  I had fresh dill on hand so I threw that in too.

WOW, this was AMAZINGLY good! I am kind of on the fence with cottage cheese. Sometimes I like it and sometimes I dont. I stumbled on to this recipe and decided to make it. I used Fat Free cottage cheese and not the 1% as stated. It turned out VERY nice. It was a nice little treat in my mouth. I will say that the longer it sits the more the flavor intensifies. (especially the clelery) I will be making this one alot. Thanks!

Maybe this is a good recipe for people who don't like cottage cheese but I didn't really think this was all that great - I'd just as soon eat plain cottage cheese

Very simple and delicious way to prepare cottage cheese. Made as written (*I assumed the chives called for were dried minced, which I didn't have, so used some fresh;gives it a tiny bit of bite). Thank you for sharing this one!

Delish!  This is soo yummy and low calorie.  To bump up the volume even more, I added chopped red bell pepper, chopped cucumber, and chopped celery.  I have 1 serving this morning and I was stuffed for 2-3 hours! (pretty good considering it was around 200 calories)

Why didn't I think of this?  I used 1% whipped cottage cheese, which is smoother.  I had no chives so I added some fresh basil.  Any combination of herbs and spices would probably be good.  This turned celery and carrot sticks into a treat.  Thanks , Traci

I don't particularly like cottage cheese but am trying to eat a healthier diet.  I followed the recipe exactly, left it over night in the fridge, and the next day it was delicious on saltine crackers for a snack.

A nice change for cottage cheese!  I halved the recipe and it worked out well.  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1. Used 1 1/2 tsp of dried chives.  Maybe use just 1 tsp next time.  2. Didn't have celery seed - had celery salt on hand so I didn't add the 1/8 tsp of salt.  Next time if I don't have celery seed I will probably use less celery salt b/c it was a bit too overpowering.

Simple and delicious. The only thing different I did was use fresh chives instead of dried. This had great flavor and is a perfect way to dress up cottage cheese. Next time I might even throw some tomatoes in the mix.

I grew up eating cottage cheese with fruit but never really cared for it until I found this recipe.  I tweaked it slightly, using garlic powder and italian dried herbs (basil, oregano, etc...) and even sometimes add diced sweet red pepper.  so good!

I used FF cottage cheese and followed the recipe for all the spices.  Next time I will decrease the garlic powder due to personal preference.  This made a great lunch served over halved cherry tomatoes, which are in abundance from my garden.

I thought the herbs were a little overwhelming. I think I may have used too much garlic. I might cut the recipe down next time.

This was great! I usually just eat my cottage cheese plain or top it w/ no sugar added applesauce and call it a day, but this was a real nice change from the usual. Thanks for sharing. :)

I loved this!  I used fresh chives from my herb garden, and all the other spices that were listed in the recipe.  At the last minute, I squirted a few drops of Sriracha Sauce for some heat.  Delicious!

This was my lite supper tonight - it was good with crackers and a cup of hot tea.  Didn't have fresh chives so used parsley instead.

I loved this recipe!   I get kind of sick of the plain ol' cottage cheese so this was such a nice twist.  Thanks!

Great way to spice up cottage cheese! I like to add a dash of Tony's to give it a little kick. Thanks for a simple way to dress up a family favorite!!

This was a nice add to cottage cheese.  I really like cottage cheese, but have never added anything to it before.  I would definately eat this again.  Thanks for the idea!

I didn't have chives on hand and cannot imagine eating it for breakfast but in the afternoon or late at night, it's delicious and reminds me of the goodies on top of a slice of garlic bread.  I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.
