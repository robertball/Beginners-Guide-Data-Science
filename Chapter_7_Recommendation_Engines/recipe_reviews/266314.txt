I perfected my version of this about 30 years ago and it has won many chili cook-off prizes.  Flouring the meat before browning it adds all the thickening we need to make it stew rather than soup.  Most often I don't add tomatoes - they really take this in a sweeter direction, so omitting them makes a more savory stew.  I always add hominy... taking the dish in the posole direction but ever so much richer.  Finally, we served it with warmed flour tortillas and sour cream and shredded cheese toppings for those who like them.  And this pork/green chili combination works as a sauce - many like it over rice... and a great filling, with cheese, for burritos.

I am giving this a 5 star rating as it has the proportions perfect. 

For those complaining about the amount of the flour, the flour is used only to coat the meat in a bag, then shaken off before cooking. It is not all put into the pan with the meat. 

 I made changes, though. First, I added about a TBSP of Mexican oregano with the cumin. I got the Hatch peppers from Albertsons, who were roasting them, so I didn't have to do that. I deglazed the pan with red wine, about 1/2 cup. 
So, here is my make process for a large dutch oven:
Preheat oven to 350.
Saute the pork in dutch oven in batches. Reserve. 
Add more oil and saute the onion until transparent. 
Add the cumin and oregano (if using)
Deglaze the pan with red wine, cooking until almost all gone.
Add everything else, giving it a good stir and bringing to a boil on the stovetop. 
Cover and put in oven for about an hour. 
Mine was perfectly tender in an hour. 
Serve with tortillas. It is absolutely delicious.

Good recipe for green chili pork the way we make it in Arizona.   The only change I made was to add more chopped garlic and chopped cilantro while it was cooking.   My dish was spicy because our hatch green chiles were hot. For that we add a dollop of sour cream to taste when you serve it along with chopped cilantro and green onions.
 Do not add all 2 cups of flour to the recipe as I saw in one of the reviews. All you do is shake the pork in the flour and discard what's left.

I was so excited to find this recipe! I grew up eating this chili and have been making it myself for decades! In a pinch, you can substitute a 28oz can of diced green chillies; it won't have the same depth of flavor as fresh roasted but it is still great. I also like to sweat my onions before adding them to the slow cooker, but that may just be personal taste. Finally, I often spike it with some diced jalape√±os to bring up the heat a touch. Use it as a sauce over burritos and you'll never eat them any other way again! ??

Worst recipe I made in a while. I should have known that two cups of flour is way too much for three pounds of meat. It created this gooey mess that was inedible. Like I was trying to make pork and dumplings but the dumplings exploded and never cooked. Something like that. Just couldn't get over the texture. Flavor was ok. Maybe more liquid could have saved it, not sure

After cooking  for 3.5 hours my meat was very tender but the onions were a bit under done. Since I made this dish early in the day it sat in the 'warm' mode for about 2.5 hours. By the time we ate the onions were nice and tender. We buy 50 lbs of roasted hatch chiles every year so I omitted step 1 and 2. I cooked this in my Instant Pot using the slow cooker button and it was a breeze  with only 1 pot to wash! Very tasty. Will make again.

This was delicious. I made a few changes, I decreased the salt & pepper. My slowcooker, seems to cook a little hot, so I cooked this on low 5 hours. I cubed the pork large about 3 inches, so it would not dry out as much as small cubes would. Then broke it into bite size pieces as it became tender. I also like to roast my chilies whole, then peel and seed. I think it is easier, because the Hatch chilies I had were a little thin. My hubby loves chili verde, and claim this was the best he ever had

It was very tasty.  And to the reviewer who thought the 2 cups of flour was to go into the chili itself ,  it isn't.  The flour is used only for coating the pork.  I guess you could save the left over flour and you might even add extra ingredients to make German dumplings as a side dish. IF  as inferred all this flour was added to the dish with the pork I can only imagine the result was inedible.

Excellent flavor loved this recipe. Very good with fresh tortillas or pita. Easy to put together and the portions are perfect.

For the people that rated low because Hatch chili's are from New Mexico. Do you rate a recipe low when it says "Michigan Parmesan Chicken" because Parmigiano  Reggiano is from Italy. Not Michigan! Come on that's just ridiculous. 

The recipe is excellent and I didn't change a thing. Good flavor, good textture and wonderful in the colder months.

I have made this twice and it is a big hit at our house! I used half the flour and half the salt in the flour, none in the chili itself. I have cooked it for three hours on high. We all find the meat to be a bit dry, so next time I will fry the onions a bit first and then cook the chili on high for one hour and let sit on warm. By the time the meat is browned on all sides, it is nearly done anyway. We love the flavor of this dish, and be warned, it is a bit spicy!

Loved this recipe! Super easy! I didn‚Äôt have hatch peppers and so I used poblano peppers instead. Just cut them open rinsed out the seeds and cut them up. No need to grill and peel.. Delish!

I‚Äôve made this twice now and both times it came out great. The first time, other than substituting anaheims for hatch chilis, I made it as written. Second time I added a can of yellow hominy. The hominy gives it even richer flavor and some more texture.  

I saw an earlier reviewer saying the flour made it a sticky gooey mess. Just in case someone else doesn‚Äôt understand and makes the same mistake, the flour is used only to dredge and coat the meat. Do not add the flour to the chili. Discard the flour after you coat the meat.

I am disappointed with the sarcastic reviews from people who criticize a fantastic recipe (before even making it!) simply because it isn't authentic from Hatch, NM.  Call it Timbuktu Hatch Chili for all I care, this recipe is a winner! I couldn't find hatch chilies so I took the advice of other reviewers and used canned hatch green chilies, which were fine.  The problem I had was trying to figure out how many cans to open to make it equivalent to fresh, seeded chilies.  I doubled the recipe and used five 4oz cans.  My husband has a weak palette and said it was too spicy,  but the rest of us thought it was amazing!  I will most definitely be making this again, but sadly will cut back on the canned chilies to please the big guy.  Topped off with cilantro, sour cream and corn/flour tortillas, it's a true 5 star!  Thank you!

Absolutely wonderful. Very similar to a recipe I was allowed to help prepare (Paquita‚Äôs old family recipe from NM), in the early 80‚Äôs. I read a one star rating on this recipe that said ‚Äúturned into a gooey mess‚Äù, and had to laugh. He/she obviously thought the whole two cups of flour get added to the browning process. The only change or addition I made was to add 2 Tbl Spoons of Ancho Chili Powder. Great Chili Verde!

Because hatch chile peppers weren't available, I substituted Anaheim peppers, which worked out well. I also added canned diced green chiles for a little kick. After four hours of slow cooking, the pork was extremely tender. Definitely don't skimp on the cumin and fresh garlic for this recipe (both really make it taste delicious) and consider garnishing with some fresh cilantro.

Wow! Have never made a pork chili before, where have I been? Living in Florida, we don't have Hatch chilis, but we can get poblanos.  I happen to grow pablanos on patio! Anyway, made this and it was fabulous. Did add some Mexican oregano as suggested and also feel that 2 cups of flour was too much, had to throw out a lot of extra flour after coating, so next time will cut it back. Great recipe

Of course changes...only need enough flour to dredge the pork in prior to browning it....2 cups is way too much.  I freeze roasted Hatch Chile‚Äôs every fall, so I did not have to go through that step. I use  medium hot peppers for the main flavoring and add hot ones for the heat...depending on who I am cooking it for. I usually just use canned tomatoes  (not with chili‚Äôs in it).   In the fall, you can sometimes find Hatch chiles in the produce sections of stores in other states - I‚Äôve even found them in Oregon, which was a wonderful treat for this NM gal!

Having never even seen hatch chilis in a store here in Pittsburgh, Pa., I used chopped green chilis. I used bone broth, and coconut flour for coating the pork, but certainly only a few tablespoons.  I also double garlic whenever I cook. Cooked it on the stove. This was very good.

Definitely will make it again, BUT three tablespoons of salt is waaaaay too much and unnecessary.

okimidoki......Your not supposed to add the 2 cups of flour, you just shake the meat in the flour and discard the flour.  Its for coating the meat.

This recipe is good, but a little too thick. Needed to add 4 cups of chicken broth, this shouldn't be as thick as a stew.  Also, I added only a few chili's while the pork was cooking and added the remaining at the end. The chili's will disintegrate into almost nothing if cooked too long. 
We eat this by the bowl with cheese and fresh warm flour tortilla's or poured over pretty much anything. Breakfast burrito's, burrito's, beans and rice, corn tortilla chips etc.

How excited I was to see you post this version of green chile.  This is so close to the recipe I was taught by a woman who owned a mexican restaurant in a small town in Colorado, the year was 1973.  This will always be my favorite, whether I am enjoying it smothered over a burrito or in a bowl with a flour tortilla on the side.
