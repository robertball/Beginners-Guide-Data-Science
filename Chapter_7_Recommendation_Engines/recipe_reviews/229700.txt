My husband and I loved this--but I made what I think is a very important omission:  I didn't add powdered sugar--the recipe is sweet enough!  Will definitely serve again . . .

This is a delicious pie! I have made it both with homemade pie filling and store bought. I think it's better with the homemade. I do not use a graham cracker crust, instead I crush cookies to make a crust with. I've used vanilla and chocolate wafer cookies and vanilla taste better to me, even though I generally prefer chocolate things. I don't like wasting lemons so I substitute 4tsp lemon juice for the zest.

I am only giving this 4 star as written because of the canned blueberry pie filling.  I made it with home made blueberry pie filling & it was amazing.  I want to try it again with cheesecake pudding & raspberries.

I tried this recipe and it is excellent. I have to agree with another reviewer about the addition of sugar. I also Omitted it and it was certainly sweet enough.

We really liked the flavor but it was very rich. My husband had two large pieces but I could only handle one small one. I made it as written and it was very easy to make. I may have been a bit heavy on the zest but I never measure it I just zest straight into the bowl.

This is a good and easy recipe.  The only thing I did different was I omitted the powder sugar and it was sweet enough without it. (Looked at the reviews). It was well received and I was told to make 2 next yr for a family gathering.

This is a huge family favorite for dessert year round! Essentially a no bake cheesecake, it quick to make. a wonderful taste of Summer for anytime of the year.  Though I did find using a larger sized graham crust, putting all the custard then all the blueberry to be more popular in our home, which is nice for me since it is much quicker!

Delicious combination of blueberry and lemon. Sweet creamy cheesecake. I may try it out without the sugar to see how it tastes but it tastes great as it is.

Very easy to make and I love that it's a no-bake! 

I followed the recipe exactly except for the pie crust. My grocery store had run out of graham cracker crust so, I went for the Oreo cookie pie crust and the combination turned out pretty good. 

With the amount of filling the recipe makes you can make one fat pie or two thin pies.

Made this with homemade bluebery filling....super good!  Would've given  it 5 stars if it set a little firmer but the flavor was worth every calorie. Glad I made 2 pies.

Made it exactly as written and it turned out good - creamy texture, kids and hubby loved it.  Nice recipe for a quick and easy, no bake option.  I think with a little tweaking it could be a five (maybe make a homemade graham cracker crust instead of store bought, omit/reduce the powdered sugar as it is really sweet to my taste buds at least).  The lemony flavor is not as strong as you would think considering - I think that maybe because the sweetened condense milk sweetness just dominates.  As it is it's good though.
