Let me start by saying I dislike beets. I rated this 5 stars because it does taste good considering my opposition to beets. So far, this recipe has been the only way I've found beets edible.

I made some important modifications and it turnout great.  Oven to only 250 degrees F, and bake, single layer for 1.5 hours, turning half way.  What a healthy snack.

Thank goodness I only started with one beet. I set my timer for 12 minutes (for the first 15 minute period) and had to snatch them out before they set off the smoke alarm (burned black and beyond any possibility of recognition). There was absolutely no way they could possibly cook at 400 degrees F for a total of 30-35 minutes! Or maybe someone's temp selector is off just a bit. Or something. Maybe I should just treat them as potatoes and do them in the MW. . .

I made several batches, If they didn't burn up they were too soft and mushy and never hardened! Impossible to get them just right & I am no amateur cook....I will buy them already made at my health food store because this recipe was a big mess with little results!
