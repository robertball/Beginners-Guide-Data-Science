My kids and I just made these and they turned out AMAZING! We microwaved the butter and marshmallows  however with 2 batches so we could use food coloring to give the eggs color. We used 1 1/2 tbsp of butter and half a bag ( about 20 lg marshmallow) for 2 1/2 minutes and stirred til creamy, adding the food coloring in as we stirred, then added 3 cups of Rice Krispies. We sprayed plastic eggs with cooking spray so that the mix wouldn't stick when molding and filled each half of the egg, then closed it to press it together. For the chocolate, we bought Baker's Dipping Chocolate that could be easily melted in the microwave and then dipped in sprinkles. They came out great and will be a new family tradition! Thanks so much for the idea!

Fun and easy, grease hands as well as the plastic egg. Less is best when using the chocolate. Feel free to wipe some chocolate off with the back of spoon. Sprinkles will still stick but it's the "cereal egg" you want to taste most not "crunchy" chocolate.

Really easy.  Just molded the eggs by hand.  Melted a bag of hershey kisses with the shortening and dipped the krispy eggs in that.  Really easy, really cute, and who doesn't love krispy treats?
