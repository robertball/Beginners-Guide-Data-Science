Finally, the perfect cherry pie! I made 2 for Father's Day. Based on previous reviews I added 1/4 cup of flour(instead of 3 tbs) to one pie and 4 tbs corn starch added to the 2nd pie.  We all liked the pie with extra flour better.

Good old-fashioned cherry pie flavor! I love fruit pies that are thickened with flour, such as this one. I used 2 cans of sour cherries, increased the flour to 6 tablespoons and added another 1/2 cup sugar since the cherries were very tart. I added a dash of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Very good recipe, Carol!

The only modification I made to the recipe was to add 4 tablespoons corn starch to the fruit and sugar mixture before pouring it into the crust. I did this to correct for the excess liquid the previous poster reported.  The pie was beautiful!  Sweet, tart, and lovely. This is a good recipe for a no nonsense cherry pie.

Well, I must be the odd person out.  I had never made a cherry pie using fresh cherries so I made this exactly as written.  2 1/2 CUPS of cherries???  I am an apple pie maker and when I made the filling mixture it didn't look right to me.  I did add a few more cherries but it still was not enough.  I used a 9" pie plate as instructed but the cherries sat way too low.  The finished pie was delicious but too sweet and I love sweet.   I did check a bunch of other recipes after I made this and the smallest amount of cherries called for were 4 cups with most being 6 cups/ 2pounds.  I did look at the some of the other reviews before makings and no one mentioned this.  HELP..WHAT DID I DO WRONG?  I won't be making this again.

This pie was fantastic!  I made a homemade crust and did a lattice top which I brushed with egg white and sprinkled with sugar before baking.  It was beautiful!  I didn't have fresh cherries so I used one bag of frozen tart cherries and one can of tart cherries, both drained.  I increased the flour to 1/4 cup and the sugar to 1 cup due to the extra cherries.  This was pretty runny while warm but after cooling it set up well.

This was the best cherry pie ever.  I used at least twice as many cherries, an extra Tbs of flour and pinch of salt, less sugar because our flathead cherries are sweeter and brushed the crust with milk then sprinkled with brown sugar & cinnamon.  The inside was set up and tasted great.

The first pie I have ever made and it was great.  I am new to cooking and it was so easy.  I upped the flour previously mentioned as well as the sugar.  I will definitely pass this recipe around.

Can you say "yum"?  My husband and I ate 1/2 the pie after lunch and the rest after dinner!  We picked more cherries off our tree today, so I'll make another pie tonight.  I think I'll add more cherries than the recipe calls for this time.  Very delicious and easy!

I am not a baker, almost never make pies but had a load of cherries so decided to try a pie.  I also increased to 1/4 a cup of flour, but everything else the same.  Great pie, my husband loved it.!  Thanks

I use a similar recipe when I make cherry pies or tarts. Simple and wonderful! Don't bother with all the other complex recipes that take away from the simple and delicious flavor of the cherries and the flakey pie crust. The best pies are ones like this!

First time making pie with the sour cherries from our trees. This is wonderful. Tasted great even a couple of days later. I did use 1/4 cup flour as recommended in other reviews. This is NOT a deep dish pie, so if you make it in a deep dish pie pan it looks skimpy. Also, I would recommend buying a cherry pitter if you don't have one as I am still looking at my stained fingers several days after pitting cherries with a paper clip :)

This is the best cherry Pie. Add the extra flour like the other reviewers say, it does need it. Also I added a couple drops of red food coloring, just to give it that real red cherry look...was beautiful and tasty!

This was the first time I made cherry pie and I thought it was delicious!  I followed a couple of suggestions---1/2 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and added almond extract.  I thought that the result was great---definitely a keeper :)

Easy, pretty, very tasty.  Picked my own cherries at a local orchard.  Next time I will up the amount of sugar as the cherries I picked were a bit tart.

I chose this for the small ingredient list and our cherry tree has always blessed us with more cherries than we know what to do with.  The filling didn't set up for me and remained runny even after the next day. The flavor was great and why I am giving 4 stars but I hate runny pies so this won't be for me but I don't think you'd be disappointed giving it a try and maybe adding a little cornstarch.

Pitting the cherries is a task. But it is absolutely worth it compared to using canned sour cherries.

This was the first cherry pie I ever made and it was AMAZING!  My parents have two tart cherry trees and this was one of the only recipes that called for fresh, tart cherries.  It was even better that there was no stove top cooking required!  I used the 1/4c flour also and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  When I ran out of cherries for the last pie, I mixed in blueberries.  The cherry/blueberry pie was delicious also!

Our neighbor brought over cherries they picked off their tree and I baked this wonderful pie.  Pitting the cherries is a pain but the hard work paid off.

My husband does not get excited about food.  He has raved over this pie for the last 3 days.  I used fresh cherries and did the 1/4 cup flour also.  This pie was perfect.  Absolutly perfect and so mmm mmmm good.  A recipe I will keep forever.  I have picked and pitted enough for 4 more pies and put them in the freezer.  Wishing cherry trees produced all year.

this turned out remarkably well. Easily the best fruit pie I've made yet! My husband even said it was Thanksgiving-quality, and that means a lot to me, if not to you as well.   I modified the flour to 1/4 cup and used Rainier cherries instead of sour cherries. I did have to mash about half of them to get enough juice to mix with the dry ingredients. I used the 9" frozen Pillsbury crust, since they're sold in packages of two.

I have not made this pie but I read the recipe and the ingredients call for a 9" pie crust recipe.  Where does the extra crust come from for the top of the pie.  I think this recipe needs to be revised. Someone may buy a 9" pie crust and forget about the top crust and then get half way through the recipe and discover they don't have crust for the top.

Excellent Cherry Pie!  I'm not sure I prefer the taste of the pie with flour but as far as consistency goes it was right on.  I have to add that I added about 3 tbs. of cornstarch mixture to mine.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of almond extract, a few drops of red food coloring, and 1 tbs. lemon juice.  I do like tart/sour things so to me that was perfect.  I used Ruth's Grandma's crust recipe from this site for my pie crust.  Thank you for sharing Carol.

This cherry filling had a wonderful tart flavor but was too runny for my taste.  It just needs a bit more flour to thicken it.

Simple the best fruit pie i've ever eaten! Pitting out the cherries was time kind of consuming but the steps were easy to follow, and the taste is really wonderful. This was my first pie that i baked and it was a total success!

I had never made a cherry pie before but I needed to use cherries I found in the freezer.  I'm not the greatest cook so I used this recipe because it looked easy and it turned out great.  Following advice from others I did increase the flour to 1/4 cup  and the filling was firm, not runny at all.  One additional step I added was to brush an egg yolk onto the lattice crust and sprinkled sugar on top before putting it into the oven.  Not only was the pie delicious, it was also pretty.  My husband said it looked like a store-bought pie.

I will make it again but I used frozen cherries mix (tart dark cherries, tart cherries, and dark sweet cherries) I added less sugars too. Also 2 1/2 cherries was not enough so I doubled it.

The flavor is delicious.  We used tart cherries fresh-picked off our tree!  I added a dash of cinnamon, vanilla, and a tiny bit of almond extract.  I also upped the flour from 3 T to 4 T to make it less soupy.  Like other reviewers, I found that 2 1/2 cups of cherries was NOT enough.  I doubled the filling, intending to make two pies, and ended up using most of the filling for one 9-inch pie!  The pie was a hit, especially topped with vanilla ice cream.  This is a great base recipe and it will go into my permanent recipe book.

I doubled the filling to fill the 9 inch pie plate.  It was too sweet.  I will cut back on the sugar next time.  It needs more flour also. It is too runny.  I baked it about 5 minutes longer.

I used 5 cups PLUS one cup of blueberries, 4 tbsp of cornstarch, 1/2 cup of BROWN sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1tsp of vanilla. After it was done, I left it in the oven with the oven off for another hour. Then i took it out and left it for another couple of hours to set. Not a drop of juice when you give it enough time to set.

I have never made a pie from scratch until this recipe. Our famliy planted a cherry tree and we have finally gotten some cherries this year so I tried this recipe. Like others commented on I did add the 1/4 cup of flour and added some rhubard and some vanilla flavor to the recipe. It turned out GREAT and will use it again next season !! Dale

Very good and not too sweet.  Mine came out with twoo much liquid.  I think it would have been better to use 3 tbsp of corn starch instead of flour.

Very yummy! We loved it but I also used 2 cans of pitted tart cherries and added a little extra sugar. Still turned out great!

So delicious and I don't normally like cherry pie. This was wonderful with the sour cherries.

I LOVE this pie! It's so easy and so delicious. Pitting the cherries was actually really fun, and I knew exactly what I was putting into my pie. My 3-year-old helped w/the lattice crust (we used a second pie crust for this -- the refrigerated variety). Delicious and so easy!!

Was very runny. Will try adding more flour next time. Do love the use of non-canned cherries though!
