Very tasty and full of flavor. I actually used this seasoning on both thinly sliced flank steak and pork. It is so much easier if you visit an area Mexican Grocer and buy the meat already thinly cut from the meat counter. These were very good. We grilled for a bit, then popped in the oven in a foil-covered pan. We cut slits in the foil and let it bake on 275 for about a hour so that the meat would get even more tender. We served on warm tortillas with cotija cheese, green onions, cilantro, refried beans, and salsa. Yummy

I didn't have the chipotle mustard, so I took 2 tablespoons of yellow mustard and added 1/8 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder and mixed it together.  It was appropriately spicy and worked great as a substitute.  I also didn't add the chipped chipotles simply because I didn't have any and the sauce was very tasty.  I've saved this recipe to use again and again.

This is an easy dish to cook.  All the prep is done ahead of time.  Combination of rub and sauce is good.  The sauce is a bit sweet when eating it on the meat but that is entirely optional and dependent on personal taste.  The toughest part of cooking was that the pieces is steak I bought were cut in a wide variety of sizes so cooking it evenly was a challenge.
