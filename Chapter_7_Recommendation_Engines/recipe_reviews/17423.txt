Good & moist, the pineapple & walnut make for an interesting texture.  I'll make again for a fun, different dessert to accompany an asian meal.

This is one of the easiest cakes to make that is moist and similar to homemade carrot cake, maybe even better!  It tastes just as good without cinnamon.  I know because I forgot to add it.  Yet, all the ladies that I served it to loved it and asked for the recipe! Here's the trick to making it, allow the baking soda to fizz before adding the remaining ingredients.

this one was bland to me.  I think it needs a pinch of salt or something to balance out the flavor.

This is a reasonably moist cake, very similar in both texture and taste to carrot cakes. I will consider making it next time when I want some variation.

Great success, for mother-in-law's birthday!  I especially appreciated the suggestion to use whipped cream cheese frosting.  When combined, it rivals the cakes one would buy at the Neiman Marcus cafe.

This is one of the best cake recipes I've ever tried.  It's simple ingredients I always have on hand and is a wonderful "go-to" dessert.  Actually my 18 year old son requested this for his birthday cake!  Have made it with chopped apples in place of pineapple and it was very good.  It is very moist and tasty.

While this recipe had a great flavor, I'm on the fence with this. Batter was easy and simple and while it had a great flavor, from a piece I could taste. I couldn't believe how the batter soaked up the non stick spray I used to keep the cake from sticking to the pan as it cooked, totally went out the window and glued to the pan like I didn't use anything. I couldn't pry this out of the pan. No subtle way or approach worked to get a nice piece out of the pan. I looked like Lucille Ball from I Love Lucy involved in a comedy skit. By the time I tried, the cake was all over me and the countertop and it looked like a bomb exploded in my kitchen. Needless to say, a 2nd attempt was made and same thing happened, so I gave up after I had a few chuckles from my kids at my mess. There won't be a 3rd attempt but again what I could taste was nice.

I skipped the glaze and opted for a powdered sugar dusting. I think the flavors are really nice in this cake - simple, sticky, sweet and full of nuts. I noticed it starts breaking down pretty quickly though with all that fruit juice in there. Refrigerating after 24 hours is probably a good idea.  I like that there's no oil added!

I never tell people the name of this cake before they try it. It is a moist pineapple-nut cake. I have been making it for years. I put a cream cheese frosting on it. It always disappears.
