One important ingredient left out of this recipe is eggs, by adding an egg or two the meatballs will be less likely to fall apart. Also you don't have to use the oven to cook them. We'd just simmer ours (covered) on low heat for around 40 minutes in the same skillet that they were browned in, adding more liquid as needed. You can also transfer them to a crockpot after browning them. As far as seasoning, it was always what was on hand. On day they might be cooked with canned tomatoes, the next with a mushroom sauce or brown gravy. My Dad used to cook us porcupine meatballs often when I was growing up, and I had all but forgot about them until I came across this recipe. Grandpa used to tell my Dad that this recipe was "good home cooking" when they were children, and that still holds true today.

Have used this recipe for years and love it. I always use canned mushroom soup instead of tomato. I never brown the meatballs just put them in dish and cover with sauce. Then cook 45 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered. Yummy!

Porcupines was one of the first recipes I learned as a new bride, over 35 years ago.  I believe the original recipe was like this one, but I have modified it to give it more flavor and "zing."  The first modification I made was to use instant rice.  It seems to "glue" the porcupines together better, so no eggs or bread is needed.  I also add diced green pepper to the meatball mixture.  After placing the porcupines in the baking dish, I top with 2 can of Rotel with juice, eliminating the need for water.  Just before removing from the oven, I sprinkle on cheese (sharp cheddar is our favorite, but use whatever suits your tastebuds) and return to the oven just until cheese melts.  I make these for company all the time and everyone always asks for the recipe.

This recipe originally came from the Betty Crocker recipe library, but the worcestershire sauce is left out.  That is why is sauce is so bland.  You must add 2 teaspoons full to the water/tomatoe sauce mixture.  Also, these do not have to be browned first.  Just bake, covered until the rice is done, then uncover for the remainder of the cooking time.  These really are good when made right.

My daughter usually loves porcupine balls.  I didn't have any tomato soup like I normally use though, so I decided to try this recipe.  I prefer the soup, I think it has a better taste.  I know several complained about the rice.  I have found after several tries you have to use either pre-cooked rice or instant rice.  I prefer the pre-cooked, but either will work.  I left the water out so I didn't have the issue of my meatballs falling apart, but they were also a little dry.  
I would recommend Zesty Porcupine Balls also from this site instead of this recipe.  So far, I think they are the best.  The sauce on this one tasted too much like plain tomato sauce, it really needs some spice.

Love this recipe with mashed potatoes and green beans!!  I use leftover rice for this dish, because it just didn't get done if cooked in the lean meatballs. And you have to cover the dish with foil or the rice that's sticking out will get crispy !! I don't brown the meatballs before baking them, they will fully cook in the oven, and not fall apart. I pour the tomato sauce over it during the last part of baking. Just season these like you would a meatloaf or hamburgers.  Really good !!

I have to tell you, I giggled all during dinner last night, my family gobbled this up!!!  They only do that when I make spaghetti and meatballs.  

As for the recipe, it was fantastic!  I doubled it and I did make a couple of modifications, I used 1 lb gr beef and 1 lb Italian sausage, omitted the celery seed - instead used 1 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  I also used a red onion.

Awesome recipe and a huge hit with my family!

We LOVED these.
I did add an extra can of tomato sauce to cover the meatballs and added about a TBS or so of worcheshire sauce to that. I did find out the bigger meatballs that did not get all the way covered the rice did not get soft. These heat up very well the next day for meatball sandwiches. We used the Peppridge Farm soft hoagie rolls and they were excellant with the leftovers!!!!

This was a great recipe. However, I just drained the fat off the pan and poured the tomato sauce right in and simmered it on the stove covered for about 40 minutes on medium low. I also used fresh garlic instead of powder and omitted the celery salt as I didn't have any. And instead of water I used apple juice. Kids loved it and asked for seconds.

I am not sure what happened.  I followed the recipe exactly but it was really hard to roll the meatballs and while I was browning them they all fell apart.  So we ended up with a cassarole type dish.  I was really looking forward to meatballs though.  I thought combining 1/2 cup of water in with the meat would not turn out great.  Overall I was dissapointed.

Should read "white INSTANT rice." These looked perfect. Unfortunately, having never made them before I followed the recipe to the letter and used uncooked REGULAR white rice. The author didn't stipulate any different. So I ended up with meatballs with little 'quills' of not-quite-done rice. They were good, but a bit crunch. Now I know better.

Pretty good recipe. I pre cooked my rice and omited the water. I added 1 egg as the mixture seemed a bit dry.  I tweaked the sauce as it was very plain, even with the addition of worcestishire sauce as suggested by another reviewer. I did not brown the meatballs, just placed them in the sauce and baked for about 1 hour covered and 15 uncovered. The meatballs were good, just a tad bland for my taste. Next time i will up the seasoning a bit to suit my taste and try a different sauce recipe. I will make this again using my changes.

My husband and I loved this dish. In the meatballs I used an egg then filled the rest of the 1/2 cup with water. I followed the suggestion from others and used boil in the bag rice. The remainder of the rice from the bag I put in the sauce, then I put in another entire boil in bag in the sauce. This makes it a one dish meal. I too used 2tsps of Worcestershire Sauce to the tomato sauce. Also one tbsp of sugar.

Very good! The name says it all. These super-cute "porcupines" remind me exactly of the prickly little creature lol! When served with mashed potatoes and a green veggie or corn, these make a very filling meal. My hubs and I had ours with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans & dinner rolls (be sure to serve some of the sauce on top of your potatoes... yum!). As with any new recipe I try, I can't resist the temptation to make a few minor tweaks. This recipe was no exception. Some changes were necessary and others were "just because." I subbed instant rice for the long grain variety (I feared crunchy bits of uncooked rice otherwise) and instead of baking in the oven, I drained all grease, added my meatballs back to the same skillet I browned them in, covered and simmered on medium-low for 45 minutes. I also added an egg to my meat mixture (to ensure my meatballs kept their shape) and 2 T brown sugar / 2 t Worcestershire to my sauce. I can't imagine how bland this sauce would have been as is.... Overall, I was quite pleased with these, if for nothing other than being easy to assemble and calling for basic (and cheap) pantry ingredients. Thanks for sharing, Tara! :-)

Yummy, but not a ton different than regular meatballs. In the tomato sauce make sure the sauce is not too acidic.   In cream of mushroom sauce mix ranch and sour cream into  a 1/3 measuring cup. This makes it taste like beef stroganoff. Good, but fattening.   *Brown rice- does not work, and wont get soft.

Love porcupines!  My mother served them with canned peaches and so do I.  We line the bottom of the pot with saurkraut.  Sounds weird but it is delicious.

Add 1-egg to meatballs, use spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and poke a small 1/8" breather-hole in center of foil and it's even better! :)

These were really good.  After reading the reviews, I did make a couple of changes.    I believe this recipe should specify that the uncooked rice should be instant.  I used raw rice and precooked it (after reading that others had problems with it)  I then omitted the water and some of the salt since I cook my rice with salt.  I used fresh garlic in the meat and no garlic salt. And I added 1 Tb Worchestershire sauce to the tomato sauce to add a little flair.  I also might add that some reviewers thought you need eggs in this recipe to hold it together but rice also holds together meatballs.  My family loved them and I will be serving the leftovers today over some homemade french bread I am baking now.  :)

All of the ingredients did not hold together very well and broke apart in the pan.  This meal did not taste very well either.  It was bland in flavor and no matter of easy could make up for that.

These were great!! I honestly forget if I used raw rice or cooked rice the first time I made these, but the second time I used raw rice, and it never cooked through. The first time the rice was not crunchy, so I will note my recipe to use cooked rice. You may want to double the sauce, the meatballs really soak it up. I used crushed tomatoes w/basil instead of Tom sauce. I served these over mashed potatoes, Mmm!

MAKE SURE you leave the meatballs in the oven for 45 minutes.  I made these last night and I took them out at 20 minutes thinking they were done because the rice only takes 20 minutes and I dishes us up and the rice was still hard.  Also make sure you add an egg.  I think I put to much tomatoe sauce in the casserole dish so the porcupines didn't really stick out because everything was so saturated with tomatoe sauce.  (I believe I used way more than what the recipe called for)

Really good!  Made mine with a can of cream of mushroom soup and half a can of milk instead of the tomato and water.  Added black pepper and worcestershire to the gravy too.  I used instant rice and it worked great. My picky stepdaughter couldn't stop eating them!

I always make a double batch now.  I don't brown them so I put half on a cookie sheet and stick them in the freezer.  Once they're frozen I throw them in a ziploc bag.

Flavor great, added chopped green pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Used basmati rice but it didn't get cooked enough. Will try with another type.

Love these! I am ashamed of how many of them I ate, so tasty.  I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of tomato sauce, as that's now my nana used to make them.  Enjoy!!

A definite comfort food I remember my mom made.  She always used a pressure cooker which keeps them moist and soft.  I've used both instant and regular rice and varied the sauce - have used tomato soup, tomato juice, beef broth instead of water...whatever I have on hand and feel like using.  Never browned them first.  Ok when you bake, but be sure to increase the amount of liquid - and baste them often.  Wouldn't think of serving them without mashed potatoes!!

I don't eat beef, so I made these with ground turkey.  Pretty good.  I decided to try 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 can of tomato.  Whole family loved it.

Made these for dinner Monday night...did change a few things, I used left over already cooked rice from the night before in my mixture, I think it helped hold together with out the added egg or bread crumbs. I also added Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and to the sauce. Didnt bake in oven, just browned in skillet drained the grease and added sauce..brought it to a boil and then just let simmer for abou 30 minutes! It was good. The kids and hubby loved it! Left-overs were good over some texas toast with a little parmesian cheese on top!

My family has been making this recipe for many, many years now.  The only change we make to this recipe is bypassing the browning step and cooking the balls directly in the oven.  Perfect every time.  We usually serve these with mashed potatoes and cheesy cauliflower.

Excellent and super easy. I did add 2 tsps of worcheshire sauce to tomato sauce mixture & did not brown beforehand as others suggested. Came out perfect! Made red potato mashed potatoes, topped with porcupine and lots of sauce. So good!

This is a good base recipe.  The recipe is bland as written.  Add your own spice to make it your own.  I added Greek seasoning and a bit of chopped green pepper.  I also added another 1/2 cup rice to the tomato sauce mix and 2 teaspoons of brown sugar.  Used Instant Rice and had no problem with the crunchies.  Family loved it ~ so will be making it again!

I loved these they were little bite sized Meat Loaf. The only thing my niece did not like about them was the onion in them but she said she would eat them again if I didn't put so much onion. My 4 Year old niece loved them so much she ate more of them then I did!!!!!

Very flavorful! The only change I made was to smother them with real spaghetti sauce (not plain tomato sauce) because we wanted them over spaghetti noodles. YUM! They were flavorful and moist. We didn't even notice the rice. The onion is what made these so good. Will definitely make again! One pound of beef made a whole 13x9 pan of meatballs.

Made these according to original directions. The meatballs were okay, although the rice was still not 100% cooked in the 60 minutes allotted. The tomato sauce was a tad on the bland side. Future modifications: mix Worcestershire sauce in with tomato sauce and add, did not use previously frozen ground beef--after defrosting the meet is way too moist and poor for holding meat balls today (always use fresh). Other possible add ins: an egg or two, substitute tomato sauce with cream of mushroom, and use pre-cooked rice or orzo.

I have made Porcupines for 50 years but have never baked them.  I make meatballs with rice, salt, pepper, garlic powder and worchester sauce.  Then I put tomatoe sauce, rotels with green chilis, and water in a large pot, enough to cover meat balls.  Heat the sauce then drop the meatballs in the liquid and cook until done.  I also add a little extra rice to the sauce.  (I use instant rice).  Everyone lioves them.

This is my daughter's favorite and she asks for me to make this when she has friends over. I always sprinkle some basil over the sauce before baking, just to add a bit more flavor. It is perfect with green beans.

Very good. I now use spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. I did parboil so the rice wasn't crunchy. I did not brown the meat first. Just added basil, oregano, italian seasoning, garlic, onion and egg with the ground beef. Added the same spices with the sauce.  This way the porcupines and the sauce both tasted good.Picked up the browned meatballs in the oven pan with a slotted spoon this is the easiest way to drain the fat. Made about 15 meatballs, we loved it.

These were GREAT; we gobbled them up.  I'd recommend using 1 tsp garlic powder instead of 1/8 tsp, and instead of celery salt, one stalk of celery chopped into tiny pieces.  Also, I added about 1.5 T apple cider vinegar and 2 tsp apple butter to the tomato sauce.  Made for a tangy/sweet sauce.  Delicious beside mashed potatoes OR over rice.  Will make again, and often!

This recipe is really good!  I've made this a few times now & modified it a bit.  Instead of browning the meatballs, I just place them in the pan with sauce to cover.  I also add 1 tsp of celery salt & 1/2 tsp. of black  pepper to the tomato sauce/water mixture.  I like to serve the porcupines over rice or with baked potatoes with a nice green salad for a yummy, complete meal!

I have not tried this recipe yet, but it looks very similar to the recipe my mother used growing up.  I add worcestershire sauce to the tomato sauce.  I double up on the sauce, and serve over mashed potatos...definitely need extra sauce as gravy over potatos.  Canned corn is also a great side along with this meal.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  However, it only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because as it is written, the meatball mixture is very wet.  I had to add to it some cooked rice to get it to sort-of stay together, even after adding two eggs (I doubled the recipe).  So next time - and there WILL be a next time - I make this recipe, I'm going to halve the amount of water that goes in to the meatball mixture.  For sides, I served this with mashed potatoes and broccoli - yummy!  Oh also, I made this with ground chicken instead of beef.  Maybe that was my problem with getting the meatballs to hold together?

These were very good.  I added worcestershire sauce to the tomato mix and an egg to the meat mixture.   I browned the meatballs in my electric fry pan and simmered them in the same pan.  Maybe a tad salty with the addition of the worcestershire.  Next time I will omit the salt from the meat mixture.   I served with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.

ALL I CAN SAY IS OMG!!  MY 11 YEAR OLD WENT NUTS.  HE IS SO PICKY AND ATE THREE TENNIS BALL SIZED MEATBALLS.   THIS WILL DEFINITELY BE SERVED AGAIN.  I DID CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE BY ADDING TWO EGGS, BREAD CRUMBS AND GARLIC.  I ALSO ADDED THE WORSTESHIRE SAUCE TO THE TOMATO SAUCE AND BASIL ON TOP OF IT WHILE IT COOKED

These were not that great. I followed the directions exactly and some of the rice didn't fully cook. Crunchy rice and meatballs don't really go well. I will stick to my standard Italian meatball from here on out!

Excellent recipe for old school style comfort food! I wondered about adding water to the meat mixture but IT WORK PERFECTLY! Rice turned out perfect. Meatballs did NOT fall apart. I did dump a can of diced tomatoes with a sprinkle of sugar on the bottom of the dish and set the meatballs on top of that. I also added a splash of worchestshire sauce to the tomato sauce on the top. YUMMY!

My mom used to make these when I was a kid and they are delicious. Doesn't seem to come out quite as good as my mom's. I'll need to get her recipes soon, haha!

I will definitely make this dish again. It was very tasty. I think that the next time I make these, I will take another reviewer's suggestion and substitute the tomato sauce with cream of mushroom condensed soup - that sounds good!

I made this for my family tonight. The kiddo"s loved it and so did the hubby! Next time, I think I will tweak the recipe a little by adding minced garlic and some parmisian cheese. The great thing about this recipe is that it would be so easy to add your own little touch.

IMO these meatballs tasted like little balls of meatloaf. The sauce that comes after being baked is the perfect topping.

I had no issues with the meatballs falling apart.  I did not have any tomoato sauce on hand, so I substituted with spaghetti sauce.  This recipe is a  keeper!  :)

I tried to make this with brown rice.  It does not work!!  The rice will not soften.  I had to cook them to death.  Stick with the white rice--that makes a big difference.

I modified the recipe a bit to our liking and also easier for me.  I used pre-cooked al-dente brown rice, and also added the beef bouillon to the water as suggested in other reviews.  I added 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, 1/4 c. italian style bread crumbs to the mixture. The sauce was a can of Annie's Organic Tomato Bisque soup (yummy by itself!) and a cup of beef broth.  I also cooked it on top of the stove instead of baked.  I would have used ro-tel to kick it up a bit if I wasn't serving it to my children.  :)

Instead of using tomatoes, I used mushroom soup, 1 can milk, 1 can of water and poured over uncooked meatballs.
Cooked for 1 hour, then flipped the meatballs over and covered and cooked for an additional 30-45 min.
Pulled meatballs out, added a little milk to stretch gravy, added a little salt and pepper to gravy, thickened and served over potatoes.

GREAT Recipe, Family LOVED it

These were okay.  My husband seemed to really like them and he doesn't like meatballs or meatloaf.  I'd increase the amount of sauce.  It cooked down to much.  I used instant rice and had no problem with it being hard.  Thank you for the recipe.

I felt like a one-man comedy act when I made this recipe. As I used thawed ground beef, I should have waited to add water to the recipe. I ended up having to press the mixture to drain it before it was able to form balls. Once drained though, they formed nicely and fried up well. Instead of the stated 1/2 hour prep time, it took me at least double.

I made the recipe with pureed plum tomatoes and do not recommend it. The sauce needs more flavour than my in-stock herbs and spices would allow.

As an aside, I highly recommend NOT serving rice as a side-dish. With the recipe as is, I don't believe you need rice, potatoes or noodles on the side. They make a good meal with just a side of veg!

I added about half a packet of onion soup mix to the meat mixture and then added some leftover "Devine Spagetti Sauce" I had on hand and it turned out WONDERFULLY!  I don't know if I made them too big, but the meatball rolling was a lil messy and and made up for a little more time devoted to prep and clean up, but was well worth it because it was loved by all.

I made these exactly by the recipe, browning them first. They seemed a little tough to me. I've made porcupine balls where you don't brown them first, and I think I like those better. I might try these again omitting that step.

Very good! I was tired of the same ole ground beef recipes and this was a nice change. I added some red pepper and baked in home canned tomatoes. I did add a little worchestire sauce as was suggested. A nice "throw back" meal.

Great recipe! It's my go-to for porcupines, only thing I add is an egg to help bind it together and a tblsp of Worcestershire sauce. Instead of using any water I just use a little more sauce to cover to meatballs. I love making this for dinner cause even my kids(2yrs and 1yr) eat them up!

These were pretty good. I use French Onion soup instead of tomato sauce and used mostly cooked rice instead. They fell apart a lot so I wonder if just making them in a loaf or just loose would be easier.

I made the recipe as written and was extremely disappointed. Not only was the rice still completely uncooked and hard after the one hour cooking time, but the meatballs were falling apart before I browned and baked them and everything tasted very bland. I would not make this again.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the directions exactly. The meatballs are too moist and fall apart when you brown them. The rice is still uncooked and the tomato sauce that it's cooking in needs more flavor (maybe some spices and herbs).  It really isn't anything to be excited about.

The first time I made these, I was in a hurry and didn't even see where I was supposed to brown them in the frying pan.  I simply made the meatballs and put them straight into the casserole dish and baked from there.  They were fully cooked and tasted just as good.  I also used Turkey instead of Hamburger.  Cut out quite a bit of time and less mess to cleanup.  In addition I spray my casserole with cooking spray first - makes for an easy wash up.

Needed some zip - the seasonings looked rather bland.  I kicked it up with some chipotle pepper powder in the meatballs and some taco seasoning with the tomato sauce.

These are okay. The rice doesn't really stand out flavor or texture wise, so it seems like a waste to add it, which is why I only gave this 3 stars.. I was expecting a little something more from these. Next time I will try this with a flavored instant rice, like mushroom, and see if that makes a difference. I don't really care for red tomato sauces, so I made these with one can (it's all I had at the time) of cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1/2 milk and 1/2 water with a little cornstarch to help thicken it.

We enjoyed these meatballs, but had to modify a little. I added an egg to the mixture to bind better. Used instant rice, added worcestershire sauce and made a sweet and sour tomato sauce to jazz it up a bit from the Cabbage Rolls II recipe here. I did not brown in pan b/f baking, just baked to save time, but it would be better to drain off excess grease if you have the time. My 5yo loved these.

These were very tasty and super fast and easy to prepare.  I think they were just a little too salty for my taste so next time I will at least half the salt.  I also think these would be delicious cooked in cream of mushroom soup mixed with a cup of water for a Swedish flare.  Thanks!

First time I cooked this and I wasn't that impressed. Maybe add some Italian Seasoning, and a little less rice.

Good base recipe!  Used cream of mushroom for sauce instead of tomato, added baby portabellas chopped up into the meat mixture, used less rice & put over rice.  Family loved them!  Will try with the tomato mixture next time.

I started off making this recipe as written but it went in a whole different direction because I didn't have tomato sauce so I used cream of mushroom. I also used ground turkey and cooked brown rice. I had leftover rice so I added that to the soup and put the meatballs on top. Cooked as directed. It was fabulous! I'll have to try this one again but with the tomato sauce next time around.

Was having trouble getting them to bind, so I threw in some bread crumbs and an egg. Sauce was a litttle bland so I threw in half a cup or so of brown sugar and about a teaspoon of ground mustard.... PERFECT. Simmered on stove instead of baking. This will be a new staple.

I grew up on these and still LOVE them!  The only thing I do differently is add oregano instead of the celery salt.  I always serve this with boiled potatoes, veg and a green salad - just like my Mom used to.  Mmmm - total comfort food.

After reading some reviews and mods, I also added 1Tbs of Worcester sauce to the tomato sauce, and an egg to bind the meatball ingredients better. I found that the water made the meatballs too soft when I was forming them. Next time I will add less than 1/2 c. I also chose to simmer it on the stove rather than bake it and they came out just fine. I basted the meatballs with the sauce every once in awhile to keep them moist and to make sure the rice cooked. The last 15 minutes of simmering I added cabbage (quartered into wedges) to the pot. It's kind of like a lazy version of stuffed cabbage rolls.

Made as instructed & won't make this way again. No taste & meatballs fell apart. Needed worcestershire sauce & parsley for taste and a couple eggs so the meatballs don't fall apart. I will use a good pasta sauce instead of water & tomato sauce for added flavor. I will also place in a dutch oven, cover & simmer til done instead of adding heat to the house from the oven in this super hot summer!

This was comfort food for sure - simple, easy, and soothing. Sometimes that's really all you need. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I minced a couple of cloves of fresh garlic and used that in place of the garlic powder. The rice cooked perfectly, the meatballs held together fine in the pan and in the baking dish, and husband and I both had seconds. We split the leftovers up for lunch tomorrow, and I imagine they're the kind of thing that is even better the next day. We had ours with Brussels sprouts and some corn from the garden, but next time I think mashed potatoes will be just perfect. Thanks!

These tasted so good - with a few tweaks! I used ground turkey and added extra chopped green peppers, basil, red pepper (powder), and Worcestershire sauce. (I didn't have celery salt to add.) I had a really hard time browning these... they just wouldn't really stick together while in the pan so I got frustrated at that point. After baking they were just fine. Also, maybe it was because I had too much meat (20 oz), but these weren't very prickly! Next time I might add more rice if I use that much meat again. Definitely worth a shot!

I have fixed these about the same but add a little extra minute rice since I use an electric pressure cooker.  I use 2 cans of tomato sauce and a can of water to cook them in.  The extra sauce makes great gravey on potatos with the porcupines.  I pressure them for about 30 min.

I tried this recipe two ways. First with tomato sauce and then with cream of mushroom. My family loved them both ways.  There are many comments about the meatballs falling apart. I found you have to work the meatballs by rolling them in your hands quite a bit, almost softening the fatty parts from the meat to help it stick together. It worked for me and it should work for you too!

I read this recipie and a lot of the reviews. After reading them I used a can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup milk like someone suggeated. I put a dash of worchester sauce in the meat mix also. Everyone like it. I would chane up the spces a little next time.

Wow!  These turned out great!  I used instant brown rice instead of regular white, plus added an egg and they stayed together.  An important thing to remember when browning them is to leave them alone; otherwise, they will fall apart.  For the sauce, I cut up half a large tomato into a small can of tomato sauce, added 1/4 cup of water, and simmered them for 15 minutes in the same skillet I had browned them in.  There was so little sauce left after 15 minutes that I added an undiluted can of reduced-salt tomato soup, and there was plenty left after simmering another 10 to smother over a biscuit.  Thanks for this classic!  I can't believe I haven't made these sooner!

I have been making this recipe for a number of years.  I found it in a book of recipes from the world war one era, titled "365 Ways to Cook Hambuger" written by Doyne Nickerson.  
Doyne Nickerson's recipe is one step easier, the meatballs aren't browned before putting them in the baking dish with the tomato sauce.
My family have long enjoyed this wonderfully simple,tasty recipe.

I was dissappointed.  First, if you used quick rice instead of long grain, it would probably turned out alright.  White or brown quick rice would work well.  No one wants to bite into a meatball that crunches!  An egg would have helped hold it together better.  Maybe I will try them again sometime and see if these changes will have better results.

We love porcupine meatballs. My mom tried it a little different some years ago. Instead of using tomato sauce, she used cream of mushroom soup. This is great with mashed potatoes.

This recipe was really good!  I used instant rice instead of long grain and everything held together really well.  I added about half a cup of green peppers to the tomato sauce before baking and it tasted great!

I have been making these for over a year now and we LOVE them!  I always follow this recipe to the "T" and now do it by heart! One thing that I change sometimes is that I use the three meat mixture: Veal, pork and beef. It's excellent.  My 5 year old who doesn't eat meat loves these, great for kids. Thanks.

This is very good. I used 2lbs ground beef, celery seeds, fresh garlic and added fresh parsley. For 2lbs meat you will need more sauce. Will make again.

These meatballs were excellent!  I changed the recipe slightly due to lack of ingredients and time.  I omitted the celery salt, tomato sauce, and 1 Cup of water.  I added 2 tsp. of ginger, a few shakes of crushed red peppers, about a tsp. of cayenne pepper, and a Tbsp. of fine dry bread crumbs.  I cooked the meatballs in an electric skillet at 325 for about 30 - 35 minutes then drained them and added my own sauce.  They were so good...my husband and I were like vultures waiting for them to cook!

I love this recipe! The sauce is delicious after the meatballs have been braising in it for 45 minutes.  The sauce and the meatballs are great served over mashed potatoes.

I make these slightly differently:  brown the porcupines in a skillet, add a large can of tomato sauce (not soup) with about 2 T brown sugar and 1 T powdered ginger stirred in.  Cover and simmer on the stove for an hour or two.  Even my picky toddler loves these!

Excellent.  Omitted the celery salt because I didn't have any on hand but it didn't seem to affect anything.  They were great.  Even my picky 4 year old ate them.

I made this and have to admit, I got excited and misread the directions.  First, I used regular Jasmine rice, yes the asian kind because that is what I had and nothing came out hard or undercooked.  I think for me, it was because I used 85/15 for the beef.  The mixture was very wet so I ended up adding 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and the mixture was still very wet.  Here is where I really messed it up but I think paid off.  I baked it in the oven for an hour covered to hold the steam in.  During this time I realized I made the mistake.  I then transferred the porcupine balls to the slow cooker with tomato sauce and I added 2 Tbspns of brown sugar.  I did think because I was multitasking and left them there for an hour.  The juice was sucked up but everything came out perfectly cooked and moist.  I will make this again and again and again.  You can use regular rice but I would say keep the fat content a little higher on the beef and don't skip on the water.  The mixture should be wet.

These were really good! I agree with the addition of an egg or two to help hold them together. I made these twice one as is and the other I stuffed into peppers and baked them in the sauce. I like a bit of Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top too. Delish! Thank you for the recipe!

I use this app all the time but have never reviewed a recipe until now. We absolutely loved these! We couldn't get enough. We don't eat much red meat so I'm always a bit skeptical about trying  anything new with beef. Can't wait to make these again; thinking about adding a bit of fresh garlic to the tomato sauce!!

My 8-year old watched the video and decided to make these for supper.  We followed the video and didn't brown before baking, and they browned just fine anyway (so feel free to eliminate that step!).  They were delicious, and have been approved as a repeat dinner in our house.

I thought that this recipe was charming, in that the protruding rice after baking really did make them look like little porcupines or hedgehogs or whatnot.  It was a nice, quick, kid-friendly meal for a weeknight.  I paired with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Might want to double (or triple) the tomato sauce to have enough to douse the mashies.  I also added a few more seasonings.  It turned out very well, and I was thankful to add another meal idea into the weeknight rotation.

I have been making these meatballs for a couple of years now. I make them the same way except I add 2 tsp. of worcestershire sauce to the tomato/water mixture, and I just put everything in a foil covered pan(without browning the meatballs), and bake on 350 for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. They come out perfect every time.

I made this recipe exactly how it was written. It was an okay dish. It tasted a little bland and the balls slightly started to fall apart. I would recommend to use an egg to hold the balls together and to use Italian Seasoning to spice it up a bit instead of celery salt.

Excellent!!! I added my porcupines in a cream soup gravy, then baked. Oh, and I used uncooked parboiled rice, and covered the baking dish while in the oven. I didn't have a problem with the rice not being cooked, it was perfect.

These turned out wonderful. I added an egg and had to add some Italian bread crumbs to get the meat to form, let it rest for a hour or 2 in the fridge. Browned in the skillet then placed in a baking dish and covered with fresh homemade sauce and baked for 45 minutes. I couldn't have asked for any better.

The porcupines were okay tasting, but I am not going to make it again.  I made it just like the recipe said to.  First, the meat was slimy from too much water.  Second, the meatballs kept falling apart while I was cooking them.  Lastly, I thought that the sauce was not enough to cover the meatballs thoroughly.

Not bad as a basic recipe.  I think it could use more salt and more spices.  I didn't bother to bake it as well, I just covered the skillet and turned the heat down once the tomato sauce had heated up.

easy and hearty.  I doubled the recipe for a food co-op, added an egg for binding.  I did the brown and bake which worked fine.  After taking out the meatballs I made a roux of tomato sauce and corn starch and whisked it into the baking dish so the sauce was a bit thicker.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and zesty broccoli (from this website)...

I just made this and it was fabulous.  It really brought me back to when I was little.  My mom would make stuffed peppers or stuffed cabbage and she always made some porcupines to throw in because I didn't like the peppers or cabbage!  I also agree with putting 2 tsp of Worcestershire Sauce in the tomato sauce water mixture.  I also agree with using 2 -  15 oz. cans of tomato sauce as opposed to one.  It gives it way more flavor and lots of juice for the taters! Because I used 2 cans to tomato sauce, I also increased the water to 2 cups and the Worcestershire sauce to 4 tsp.  I served mine with mashed potatoes and seasoned steamed broccoli spears.  There is only 2 of us so the leftovers are plentiful!  I will make this again and again.

Great Recipe.  But I broiled the meatballs in the oven for 15 minutes instead of browning them on the stove. Saved me having to stand there.  Also i put the rice and 1/2 cup water in the microwave for 5 minutes on high to get it started cooking (did not have instant) and let it cool a bit.  this worked perfect and the rice was not hard. Finally I sauteed the onions, added garlic and finely chopped celery instead of celery salt and the garlic powder.  Just enough to release the flavors.  Used the 2 tsp of Worcestershire in the tomato sauce as suggested by another person and also some Hot Sauce to taste to spice things up,  Not wanting to make mashed potato's LOL I served them over perogies.  My family scarfed them up.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I was so happy to find it! This is what my mom used to make in the 70's and called it "Porcupine Meat Balls". My dad would joke about whether the porcupine it was made out of was fresh or not. Thanks for posting this, I can't wait to try it!

mmm very good. The whole family thought these were really great. Only suggestion was maybe throw in some herbs. Went great with mashed potatoes -- especially the left overs combined w/ the sauce!

Love this recipe! I made these using ground turkey (thats what I had handy) and it came out perfect! My family went nuts over them! I also took some left overs to work and everyone asked for the recipe. The only downside is the amount of prep and cook time. I think I will also try putting cheese on top during the last 15 minutes of cook time. Very yummy!!!

Very good, liked the idea of using the canned rotel tomatoes and green chili's from another reviewer, great idea, gave it some good kick and flavor.

While I haven't eaten them yet.  I can say that I had quite the difficult time keeping the mix "together".  It all kept falling apart during the browning stage.  Any suggestions would be helpful.  I found myself adding breadcrumbs and mozz. cheese in hopes that either would help bind the meatballs.

I DID NOT ADD ANY WATER. I ADDED WORSTERSHIRE SAUCE, FRESH GARLIC, ONION, BELL PEPPER, DICED VERY SMALL. 1CUP OF RICE TO 2 LBS OF GRD BEEF. I ADDED CILANTRO AND PARSLEY FLAKES. I USED COOKED RICE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND USED CANNED SPAGHETTI SAUCE IN THE MIX AND POURED IT ON TOP. I DID NOT MAKE MINI BALLS, I MADE MINI LOAFS AND ALL 8 OF THEM WERE GONE BY BED TIME!

I had never heard of these before, my fiancée had, so I decided to make them for him. They were good, but a little bland. Maybe, add a little more seasoning to them. I will, definitely, make them again.

I make these as written, except I add about 1 tablespoon Worchestershire to the tomato sauce/water mix. Also, instead of baking, I sometimes just cook the meatballs covered in the same skillet I used to brown them--one less piece of cookware to wash.

Oh my goodness! Could it be better than I remember as a kid? My mom used to make Porcupine Meatballs growing up. It was one of my all time favorite meals. I found this recipe trying to recreate mom's dish. I cant believe how GREAT these turned out! My husband LOVES this, I seem to make it 2-3 times a month!

This was great.  Followed the recipe exactly, but doing it again I would double the tomato sauce/water it cooks in for extra gravy.  Awesome with rice as a side dish and a salad.  Will make again!!

I was skeptical at first -- i did not mix water with the meat, added 2 eggs and diced jalapenos...also used basmati rice ( becoming my favorite  rice to use) and went with original tomato sauce....was a little tricky browning the meat, but i got it- excellent recipe! will make it again.

The only directions I followed was temp & cook time. I used 1lb. Ground chuck mixed with 1 egg bread crumbs splash of water minced garlic garlic powder paprika celery salt seasoned salt pepper onion powder Italian seasoning all to my desired taste and minute rice. Instead of tomato sauce I used a can of French onion soup and a can of mushrooms. Covered 45 min. Uncovered 15 min. Served with sauté fresh green beans. DELICIOUS!!! Five stars for my way. Alll the reviews seem like the original recipe was bland and I would agreed based off reading it.

I grew up eating these. We NEVER brown them first and NEVER bake them. We always simmer them in a large skillet. This recipe makes it so much more complicated than it has to be. I think I will stick to my way! That is why I only gave it 3 stars.

I'm giving this recipe a 3 only because I did alter it a bit based on the recommendations of other reviewers.  I added an egg and used tomato soup (knowing how much I love tomato soup, I thought it might be a nice change from typical tomato sauce).   It was horrible.  My meatballs were mushy and ended up falling apart and the "sauce/soup" mixture just made for an awful taste.  Note to self - tomato soup and meat does not taste good together!    Next time I will follow the recipe.  In the meantime I have to find a way to get this wretched taste out of my mouth.

Very good and easy recipe.  I added egg and some lipton soup mix to give it an extra punch.  Also when browning them you can add a little water to the pan so they won't stick and come out very easy it also retains the shape of them better.

Yummy, but I like my tomato products a little more... flavorful.  so I stirred a few tablespoons of HP sauce (it's like A-1 steak sauce, only 100% better) into the tomato sauce.  perfect!

These were decent enough, but a little bland for our taste. I did add some worstishire and a couple other standard spices, but it still needed something. The rice was good with the meat, but I gotta say, upon first glance, when pulling the meatballs out of the oven, I thought, eww, they look maggot infested-- because of the rice. Not something I'd serve to guests.

I have a recipe a lot like this one, but I tossed that one away, this is my new go to.  I didn't have celery salt, so I used celery seeds instead 1/4 tsp.  I did use 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, that was a little too much, so I will cut down next time.  I halfed a green pepper and put it in the tomato sauce while it baked in the oven, that was a litttle trick from my other recipe.  All and all it was really good and flavorful.  Thanks for posting!

This is just like the filling my Ukranian mother made for her stuffed cabbage. The only difference is she cooked the rice first before adding to the meat mixture, then stuffed the cabbage leafs, poured tomato sauce or soup over and baked. THAT WAS GOOD!

I added two eggs to the meat and 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the tomato sauce.  I chose to omit the browning the meat step.  The completed porcupines had a strong celery salt flavor and were not very attractive to look at, but had a good home cooked meal feel to them.

Very, very good!  I tripled the recipe (for guests), and used 3 cups of leftover cooked shortgrain brown rice.  Served with mashed potatos and salad.

I tried this recipe twice, and both times the rice turned out crunchy. I used bison meat, which tasted great. If I make this again, I'll boil the rice for a couple minutes first.

A good recipe, my family really likes it, it just needs a little spicing up. I use a beef bullion cube melted in 2/3 cup water, chop the onion VERY fine, and add finely chopped red bell pepper. You don't need as much salt using the bullion cube. You can also substitute canned beef broth for the water and/or bullion cube. I also add in soft bread crumbs, about 2/3 cup--helps hold it together. And I use pre-cooked rice, just seems to work better. Last thing I do is use some thyme, and a touch of cider vinegar to spice up the tomato sauce.

Made these today for the first time and LOVED them!!!!! I used tomatoe soup and tomatoe sauce combined and then added chicken stalk as they cooked. Did them on the stove brown them then add liquid and simmer for about an hour...rice was cooked fine.

These were great!  I've never eaten or made anything like these before.  My family loved them.  I followed the directions for making the meatballs and they did not fall apart.  I used beef broth instead of water for the sauce and had to double it half-way through cooking because the rice meatballs soaked up all the sauce.  Very tasty!

I added tiny bits of potato. I would recommend adding Progresso bread crumbs to keep the meat together. I would recommend this as an appetizer for a dinner party.

Reading some of the reviews, I added an egg to the meat mixture along with some bread crumbs. I think that the bread crumbs helped out a lot.Someone also mentioned they used cream of mushroom soup instead of the tomato sauce; in which I did too. We thought they turned out great. next time I'll try the tomato version.

These were really good.  Instead of the cup of water mixed with the tomato sauce, I used V-8 juice.  Really flavorful. Love this recipe. I served with rice pilaf and a cucumber/tomato salad.

I used a variation of this recipe many years ago when my children were small. I would wrap the meat mixture in cabbage leaves and pour tomato sauce over them and cook in a skillet. My mother-in-law gave me this recipe back in 1983. Wow I need to make this again for my grandsons now

Surprisingly Very Good! I followed the meatball recipe exactly and the only change was one my husband suggested, a can of garlic-y fire roasted tomatoes in place of the cup of water in the sauce.  I used the left over meatballs and sauce to make meatball sandwiches topped with mozzarella.  2 meals from 1 recipe!  Thanks!

Very yummy!!!!  I do brown mine before baking to get out more of the grease.  I added a green pepper.  Also, after it baked for the 45 minutes, when I remove the cover I put shredded 2% mexican cheese on top- so yummy!

I followed the recipe, but the rice did not fully cook in the time suggested.  I finally ended up scooping them all out and simmering for 20 plus minutes on the stove.  Not worth the trouble! Tasted ok.

My family loves meat, so I was thrilled when I came across this recipe. However I had to make some minor changes since I have a picky family. Instead of tomato sauce I used brown gravy! Also, I served this over mashed potatoes made from scratch! It was a hit!

These were great!  The whole family loved them!  I subbed meatloaf mix (ground beef, pork, and veal) instead of just beef, and minced garlic instead of powder.  Next time I'll try baking them in cream of mushroom soup.  I was a little skeptical using uncooked rice.  I always use cooked rice for filler.  The uncooked rice worked out perfectly and the rice poked out of the meatballs making the name porcupines very appropriate.

I have never made meatballs before. I've only ever had them from the store. These were great and very easy. I changed the recipe just a bit... I used brown minute rice, added 1/4 cup of egg beaters, and used cream of mushroom soup instead of tomato sauce. They turned out great. We wished there were more leftovers. I'll never buy meatballs from the store again!

I made these for my husband and he said they were very similar to the porcupines his mom made for his family when he was growing up. They brought back good memories for him and we both thought this is a very tasty meal. Thank you!

Very easy and it took very little time to get these assembled and into the oven. My whole family liked them. They have good flavor, but they are nothing fancy. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was good as is, but it could be tweaked a bit to suit your personal taste. I will make these again.

The meatballs themselves were good but we were not thrilled with the tomato sauce.  We thought it was missing something.  Will keep looking.  Thanks

These were REALLY good! I followed the recipe exactly and I had no problems with the rice being hard. The kids (ages 4, 2 and 1) absolutely LOVED it and gobbled it up. The husband did the same. We have no leftovers! I will definitely be making this again. Not only are they easy, they are fun! The kids loved the way they looked!

really great.  I changed it a bit I added beef broth (I had in the fridge)to the meatballs.  I had no tomato paste so I used a can of Tomato soup to 1 can of water.  I also added some Italian seasoning to the soup mix.  With the slight changes the reviews were great. Everyone enjoyed it including Mr. Fussy (the 8 year old) definitly A KEEPER

These wre pretty good - reminded me of something my mom used to make but not quite the same.  I used ground turkey, minced garlic instead of powder, added more onions and did not use the water as ground turkey has a lot of moisture.  I was out of tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste and thinned it out with both water and worcheshire sauce.  I also threw some mozzarella cheese on during the final 15 minutes.  Unlike others, I had no issue with the rice being cooked - use Minute Rice!  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought these were absolutely excellent.  I love meatloaf, yet it's always "hit and miss" for me.  I think when I'm in the mood for it, I'll use this recipe instead.  They were moist, tasty, and extremely easy to prepare.  Thanks for a great idea!!!

These were just what I was looking for...my mother used to make these when I lived at home, but she called them "porcupine balls".  Not the best name for food, but I loved them.  Thanks

Save some tomato sauce for after you take it out of the oven a second time and drain the liquid, otherwise you're just going to have regular meatballs with virtually no tomato sauce at all

Lacked some flavor in my opinion but I still enjoyed these.  I did notice it was really hard to get the meatball shaped even with adding an egg to help bind, maybe I did something wrong but the mix seemed super wet and hard to form.  I do intend to make these again but I will be tweaking the recipe to my own tastes for sure!

My family's been making these for decades. One reason why some reviewers say the meatballs are falling apart is the leanness of the beef. Use 85/15 or even 80/20. That will help and you might consider cooking at 325 for one hour. More time for the rice to get cooked.  You can also zap it in the microwave, 5 mins. at a time, turning the meatballs. Then put it into the oven for a bit to brown. Good, but I'll stick with our own recipe. Thanks for a walk down memory lane.

very good! Be sure the meatballs are covered with sauce so the rice gets enough liquid. I cooked them for 45min. but had to spoon sauce over the balls so the rice got enough liquid and extended the cook time.

I make these quite often, I make them when I make stuffed peppers, I am the only one who loves stuff peppers, so I make these in the same pot as the stuffed peppers, they love the flavor of the peppers, so the pepper flavor gets in the porcupine  balls, very very good, I prefer the tomato  soup. but tomato sauce is good also.

I read the reviews and changed up a bunch of the ingredients according to what people said. My meatballs were crumbling when I started pan frying them so I took them out quickly, added an egg, as I remember reading about it, and they held together fine after that. I also used minute rice and tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. I baked them in the oven and served them with mashed potatoes (I used Chef Johns recipe on all recipes which complemented them well and highly recommend it). So with the original recipe I would give 3 stars but with the changes from reviews (add an egg, use tomato soup, and minutes rice), I would give 5 stars. My family and kids ate them all up!

Tasted good but not awesome so 4 stars. Was a little concerned when I was forming the meatballs as they didn't seem sticky (no egg). I was careful browning them so they didn't fall apart in the pan. I used 1-1/2 tsp of onion powder in place of the onion as my daughter won't eat them.  I also didn't have canned tomato sauce on hand so I made up my own with some of the Roma tomatoes from my garden this year. All in all, a solid go to recipe that is easy on the budget.

Porcupines has been my favorite meal that my Mother has made for over 50 years. We add two eggs and 2 cans of tomato sauce to 1 cup of water. Then cook in an electric skillet or on top of the stove. Twenty-five minutes later. Fantastic....

Use fresh tomatoes instead of canned paste tomatoes.  I grill them before I peel off skins.  I also grill the meatballs to brown them.  Use a smoker grill gives the dish one awesome taste!

The only substitution I made was to use celery flakes, which is what I had on hand, instead of celery salt. For me, this recipe has too much rice in proportion to the meat.  Plus, with it being uncooked, it didn't all get tender during cooking. Last, the porcupines didn't stay together well. I was hoping for a recipe reasonably close to my grandmother's. I think she may have made her porcupines from leftover stuffed cabbage filling, so that's what I'll try next. Thanks for sharing this recipe! Even though it wasn't a hit, it was a nice change of pace.

I used to make this for my kids and boyfriend-brought back memories. You basically follow the recipe but I added some green pepper and garlic . Make sure rice is cooked!  I baked it in an oven at 375 for 45min. Then I made the sauce adding some westshere sauce some sugar and a splash of red wine. Mix well season to taste and pour over porcupines. Too with cheddar cheese and a handful of mozzarella . Finish baking for 15 min served over mash pot with salad and corn.

I made these and they were amazing! In the video it does not show to brown the meatballs in the pan before baking them in the oven. I HIGHLY recommend doing it though. It will keep the meatballs together perfectly without a binder. These turned out perfect! I also recommend the worcestershire. I added a little bit to the meat and then some to the sauce. Turned out perfect!

It was pretty good. I didn't brown before baking, but I probably should have because they were pretty greasy. I think if I make this again I'll add egg because they didn't stick together well, and that's what kept me from browning them.

Will definitely make again. Subbed jasmine rice since I didn't have any plain white rice, and knew brown rice could be a disaster. Rice turned out perfect, little spikes sticking up when I took out of the oven. Of course if you spoon sauce over them after done the "quills" disappear. Will look into using brown rice in future, maybe soaking overnight or parboiling before mixing with beef.  I use a 1/4 cup measuring cup for meatballs and just plop them in a large 9x13 (lasagna) pan without even rolling--shape was still fine, brown at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes, then pour sauce over. I'm lazy and don't like to brown in skillet first, plus these were a little loose and risk falling apart. I used pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce, which ended up being a little bitter. I think tomato soup would be tastier, like what I use for ham balls. I forgot that I was supposed to remove foil and bake another 15 minutes.  I cooked mine 45 minutes total at 350 and they were done, rice was done!  The sauce consistency was also perfect, thick enough without extra time, maybe because I used pasta sauce vs. plain tomato sauce.

made this just as  it is and is very good!
the next coupe of times I made small changes.
added finely chopped sweet pepper and 2 eggs to bind balls
I used 15 ounce can diced tomatoes and can of Rotel  tomatoes and chiles for the tomato sauce  and water. 
I also place 6 slices of sharp cheddar  cheese on top  at the end to melt and brown a bit.

This was a great recipe! To make it even tastier, I  used a can of Campbell's Tomato soup with Basil and Oregano instead of plain tomato sauce. Yummy! I also used cooked rice instead of uncooked rice, which meant the cooking time was less.

Made this the other night and my boys raved about these!  I did read some of the reviews before making and made a few adjustments.  I doubled the recipe and added a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce and I added 3 eggs to help bind the meatballs together.  I agree with the other posts that the meat mixture was very loose.  I also used Crushed Tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  Served these with mashed potatoes :)

I also would use an egg instead of water in the meatballs. They were pretty wet and fell apart easily. Otherwise, this is a great recipe. I browned them in my Dutch oven and then put the whole thing in the oven. One-pot meal!

I baked these with purchased pasta sauce rather than tomato sauce and both husband and I thought they lacked any flavor.    Won't be making these again.

My Mom made these all the time when I was a kid ( a very looonngg time ago!).  Her recipe came from a book that came with her very first crock pot and included both eggs and Worcestershire sauce.  They are a family favorite with my own family too.  Simply mix it all together, throw it in the slow cooker and 8 hours later, you have dinner.  Add some mashed potatoes and corn or green beans and you have a hearty homestyle meal that even the kids will eat!  IMHO, this recipe needs the eggs to hold the meatballs together and the Worcestershire sauce for added flavor. Oh, one other change-Mom's original recipe (that I still use) calls for tomato soup instead of tomato sauce--it just adds more flavor from the soup seasonings as opposed to plain tomato sauce.

We enjoyed this recipe. I added oregano, basil and garlic as suggested. The meatballs were a hit. I have celiac disease and I found this recipe after entering "Gluten Free Meatballs". If you added worcestershire sauce they would not be gluten free.

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out well.  Porcupines were very moist and the sauce went well with them.  I will make these again but they are a once a month type recipe not an every week staple.

I have made this recipe for years..it is passed down from my mother. I use tomato soup and add chili powder to the soup. I have to make a lot of sauce to put over the mashed potatoes for my family. It's been a favourite in my family for years.

I made this with Johnsonville Sweet sausage instead of ground beef, and made a sweet and sour sauce instead of tomato.  It was delicious.  The rice was just slightly too hard, I'm not sure how that could have been solved, perhaps a little more water in the mixture.  This is the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5.  I would definately make this again - both ways, with sausage or ground beef.

My family LOVES this! Quoting my brother, "It tastes like it came from a restaurant!" I might consider using sweet onions as a trick. Maybe I'll experiment this with the slow cooker, too! Highly suggest, and can see making it agian!

As for me, it is great. Personally, I prefer it without onions, but, hey, that's just me.

These were ok. The leftovers went slowly. Nice for a once in a while thing when you're sick of the regular stuff that you do with ground beef.

My mom used to always make porcupines when I was little, but sadly, this was one recipe that I didn't remember by heart. I decided to give this one a shot. I noticed the recipe did not call for eggs, but since it was the first time I was trying it, I decided not to alter the recipe. Big, BIG mistake. This recipe most definitely needs eggs to help hold the meat together. The balls fell apart pretty badly during the cooking process. Ah well. We'll try again next time ... but definitely with eggs. :)

I made this recipe twice.  The first time, I used cooked brown rice and it turned out well.  The second time, I used uncooked white (not instant) rice, but found the mix needed an egg and some breadcrumbs to bind enough to form meatballs.  With cream of mushroom soup or tomato sauce for the gravy, either way it is a very good comfort food.

Great!  I had to modify based on what I had, added the Worchester like someone mentioned to the sauce.  We ate it up!  I didn't brown first, just plopped them in the pan and covered with sauce.  Will def make again!

This is a must try. Prepare the night before and it would make for an easy day the next day. I think that you could even get away with adding spaghetti noodles if wanted to make the dish go even further. It made a lot of food.

For some reason this just wasn't a hit at my house.  I felt is was just ok.  Maybe I wasn't sure what I was expecting to taste this being my first time eating this.  Most likely will not be making again.

My  mom has made these for years, since I was a child.  WE LOVE THEM.  I did want to add though, I see several people have stated the rice didn't cook.  The BEST ground beef to use is one that is not to lean, we typically use 73/27, the juices in the meat is absorbed by the rice and then the rice will cook and your meal will be perfect.  The more lean the meat the harder it is to get it to cook.

These were good. I will make them again. I did not brown my meatballs. I just shaped them and then poured the sauce over them and baked them covered. When uncovering them be sure to pour some more sauce over the top of them so they don't dry out. Easy and good.

I like to use tomato soup instead of tomato sauce & put a little sugar in sauce, not so much tomato acid
 to the pallet. Fix in Pressure cooker rocking for 15 min., cool on it`s own. FANTISTIC!!!!

Had to add an egg and breadcrumbs because they were not holding together. Added garlic for extra flavor. The sauce was a little bland but my 3 y/o gobbled it up!

The rice needs to be cooked ahead of time and I added a little extra garlic powder. It was delicious, other than the fact that the rice was crunchy on the inside.

I made these tonight and they were very  good. I added some chopped parsley to the meat mixture and I also sautéed fresh garlic and onion before adding in. Some meatballs fell apart while cooking but that's ok. I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper to the tomato sauce/water mixture and then I added to meatballs. I felt that it needed more sauce so I added another small can of tomato sauce and bay leaf.

I made these tonight....followed the recipe and suggestions. I didn't brown them first, I used uncooked rice and left over spaghetti sauce from dinner the other night along with a can of Italian style diced tomatoes. I would definitely add worcestershire sauce to the tomato sauce for extra flavor next time. Over all....delish!!

With 10 people in our house, it is very hard to please everyone but this did just that.  I didn't have celery salt so i used this rosemary and garlic blend.  It was a great add in to this recipe.  I also sprinkled some garlic on the top of the bottom layer of sauce.

Good recipe. My mom made these meat balls when I was young and I was searching for the recipe. I did change the recipe by omitting the water and tomato sauce and adding 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup milk.

A good, quick and easy recipe. I was a little disappointed with the flavor. I think I will use this as a basic recipe and add my own spices and flavorings to it in the future.

It wasn't fantastic.  The meat fell apart and left a mess on the plates.  The taste was a little bland and not to my family's liking.  Probably won't make again.

Easy and delicious. I followed the recipe and they turned out wonderfully.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  They remind me of a less spicy version of the filling for stuffed bell peppers or meat loaf, but more flavorful.  I will make them again!

Kind of bland by itself, but was good with mashed potatoes. Sauce needs something for a kick. I also agree with other probably best to use instant rice to keep it better held together.

This is the same recipe that I use to stuff cabbage with but I always double it so we have plenty of leftovers. I do add egg to the mix also. For the sauce I use two cans of tomato soup with two cans of water and one 15oz can tomato sauce.  I season the sauce with either frsh garlic or garlic powder which ever is available.  Great recipe t serve with mashed potatoes and corn...Yum Yum!!

I thought these were "okay" and my husband didn't like them at all. I think they would be great for kids, but we thought they tasted pretty borning.

Very good. Only had 1 8 oz tomato sauce so I used spaghetti sauce for the other half. I did parboil so thank goodness the rice wasn't crunchy. I had no celery salt. I did not brown the meat first. Just added basil, oregano, italian seasoning, garlic, onion and egg with the ground beef. Added the same spices with the sauce. This way the porcupines and the sauce both tasted good. Made about 12 meatballs, we loved it.

I think this would have been good had I had all the ingredients so I'm giving it 3 stars. I did not have onion so I used celery and red bell pepper finely chopped. I still used some celery salt and extra garlic powder. I also did not have tomato sauce, so I decided to use a beef gravy I had on hand. I think those alterations would have all been just fine, but I made the mistake of using brown rice, b/c it's all I had. I knew I should probably cook it first, but didn't have time, so I figured it'd just have to cook longer. Well, even with an extra 20 minutes, the rice was crunchy. I think next time I'll use fully cooked brown rice. Other than that it was an interesting dish. My girls liked it other than the crunch, but I'm sure glad Hubby wasn't home for this one! :)

A friend saved this recipe for me. She said it was something she used to eat as a kid. Well I invited her over for dinner and didn't tell her what I was making. I ended up serving a fine porcupine MEATLOAF!! I got carried away and dumped the tomato sauce into the bowl with the meat and rice DUH!!! Sure tasted good though! Even better cold on homemade hoagie rolls!! I'll make it again!

I followed the recipe and when attempting to form the meatballs found it was falling apart.  So I added an egg to hopefully hold them together, but it didn't help.  As another reviewer mentioned, this ended up as a caserole and not meatballs :(

I came across this recipe today after prepping mine for tonight's dinner...lol.  I have made this one since childhood and rarely make it the same way twice.  Normally I add a couple of dashes of chili powder to the meatballs and the tomato soup.  I also like to add some salsa to the soup sauce as well.  Definitely use instant rice instead of regular white rice, it cooks more evenly and won't leave the meatballs crunchy in the middle.  Enjoy!

I enjoyed this recipe, but my boyfriend wasn't too keen on the fact that some of the rice was hard on the outside. I like this recipe because it was easy and the ingredients were simple. I would make this again.

When I looked over the ingredient list for Porcupines, I was really excited to see how the rice would taste in the meatballs. When I cooked them, the rice was nice and soft in the center, but hard and crispy on the top. I wasn't really fond of how it all turned out and my boyfriend (whose idea of a good dinner is Hamburger Helper) didn't seem to care for it much ether.

This is our favorite "go to" recipe for  meatballs.   I love to make this with mashed potatoes since the sauce is great over it!..  I add a T of brown sugar and a dash of worcestershire to my tomato sauce.  Yum!

I have used a similar recipe for years using a large can of tomato juice instead of tomato sauce (it will reduce)as our family likes the additional sauce and instant rice.  This is a great recipe to take to a potluck dinner or office party...always a hit!

My family would have no problem living on this recipe.  We make this at least once a week and have for a few months now with no complaints but many request.  We play with the sauce, sometimes its cream of mushroom, sometimes its the exact recipe and sometimes its the zesty sauce.  The possibilites are endless and its just a fantastic recipe!

I have made one with tomato soup several times and I think I like it better.  The rice can be parboiled for about 10 min.  The old Campbell Soup recipe does add an egg to the meat mixture and cooking time is 40 minutes. I have never heard of a child that didn't like them. This meat mixture is similar to one use by my family for years when making cabbage rolls (Holapsie in our German culture in North Dakota).

Even with browning the meatballs first as recipe suggests, the rice just doesn't get done in 15 minutes in the oven. Probably needs 30 to 60 minutes in the oven to be done unless you like partially cooked rice. The recipe itself is fairly tasty.

Very good and really easy.  I used almost 2 lbs of meat and add 1 egg, but cut back on the water to compensate.  For seasoning (with just under 2 lbs meat) I used 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp of chives, 1/2 tsp basil & 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  The flavor was great.  Browned and simmered in the same pot with 1 large can of Hunts spagetti sauce with water added as needed.  My husband really enjoyed these.

I'll give this 5 start but more like 4 and a half only because the meat balls didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Next time I'll try my own meat ball recipe. I used one can tomato soup and one can tomato sauce. Other wise this was excellant. Oh I did add 2 eggs but the meat balls were still very soft to cook.

This was a great family meal on a budget! I was a little leery with just tomato sauce and water for the porcupines to cook in but, but really good! Kids said make it again!

This is a great recipe, instead of using tomato soup, I use bbq sauce or something along those lines. I find using the bbq sauce, it adds much more flavor. Thanks for all the great recipes here!

They seemed rather bland, but I am excited about how flexible and easy this recipe is.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, but next time I will probably add some fresh garlic along with some bell pepper and green onions to the meat mixture.  I will also try a brown gravy or a cream of mushroom gravy.

They were okay.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of tomato sauce (didn't have any).  I don't think I will make them again.  

I will stick with my other meatball recipe.

I loved the easiness of this and the taste but the rice was crunchy after cooking. Is it supposed to be like that or am I doing somelthing wrong. Maybe I could use cooked rice and see how that works because I want to cook this alot more in the future.  Dee

Fun, easy to do.  Hubby and co-workers loved them, however I wasn't as thrilled with the tenderness or flavor even though I played around with the spices/herbs.  Will try again.  Thanks for the post.

Pretty good, but nothing exciting. A little bland and not quite what I remembered from what Mom used to make. This might need a little tweaking, but has the potential to be a very yummy recipe.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was pretty bland.  I've never made porcupines before, but have been trying to find the perfect meatball recipe. I used less onion than called for but added onion powder, 2 tsp of Worcestershire, a couple sprinkles of red pepper flakes,  Italian seasoning (Mrs. Dash) to both the sauce and meat hoping it would improve an otherwise bland sounding recipe--to no avail. I wasn't expecting to see as much rice fall outside the meatballs as I did, so I think the recipe might call for too much.  I used regular rice (not instant) and it cooked al dente, not all nice  soft--even with 10 extra minutes.  Will keep searching for the perfect porcupines. At least I understand why they're called "porcupines"

I used to make a recipe similar to this and often it didn't cook the rice in the time the recipe called for. I learned to always check before I pulled it out of the oven. You can usually just look at the meatballs and see if the rice looks like it has swelled up. If that fails taste it. Better that than raw rice!
I added Worchestshire Sauce and several drops of Tabasco Chipolte sauce to the tomato sauce. It wasn't spicy but kept it from being blah.
The family loved it!

I have made these for many years.  I always use a can of tomato soup though.  One way to avoid the "crunchy rice" dilema is to use leftover rice (especially from your Chinese take out).  I am not fond of these, personally, but the rest of my family loves them.

This was ok. It was a good base and could be spiced up. DH hated it, I think it was the rice texture in the meatballs...way too crunchy still even after being cooked in the oven for an hr. Thanks anyway!
