This is an amazing chicken roast!! I'd never made one because I never thought I'd be able to make one as good as the one you can find at the store, but I was waaaay wrong. This chicken was hands down the most delicious and moist chicken we've ever had. My husband is still raving about how good it was two hours after having eaten it. I cannot wait to chop up the leftovers for super awesome salad for lunch. This is a phenomenal recipe! Thank you so much!!

This made a beautifully browned chicken. It was super moist. I had to cook it a little longer than directed. I have mixed feelings about the spice mixture and I'm having a hard time deciding why. I wasn't overly fond of the taste. It was o.k. but not OMG I can't get enough of this. I am not sure if it is too much brown sugar or too much thyme. I definetly love the technique.  I will just have to play with the spices next time for my taste.

This was delicious! The only thing I will do differently next time is to add the bacon halfway through the cooking process, I don't like mine really crispy.

delicious! I didn't have enough bacon and it was still absolutely fantastic. I think I like that the bird I used was a bit smaller, making the coating thicker. I will definitely be making this incredibly inexpensive and tasty dish again.

Tried this recipe earlier today and had the chicken for dinner.Very moist and full of flavour. All my family enjoyed it. I have added this one to my recipe box and will be trying again.

I have made this twice one with a whole chicken and once with cornish hens both times excellent.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I was very disappointed with this meal :( The bacon came out brown and desiccated around the edges and pink in the middle.  Also, the skin on the chicken was soggy...not crisp the way I like it.

This was an OK roasted chicken to me. You do have to cook it a little longer. My husband loved it though. It was just something about the sent of all the spices that turned me off a little bit. But it wasn't bad. I probably want cook it again though.

I made this for dinner last night and we couldn't get enough! I had to make a couple of quick substitutions because I didn't have all of the herbs, so I just used 4 tbs. Italian seasoning in place of the oregano-and 1 tbs. chili powder in place of the cumin. Absolutley great recipe!

I seasoned it exactley as the recipe stated but roasted it in our convection oven on 360 for 1 hour and 10 minutes. All I have to say is DELICIOUS.

Great recipe! I only had three strips of bacon and it still turned out amazing. Very moist and just enough flavor. Easy to make and doesn't take to long.

Very good!  I have been looking for a good roasted chicken recipe and this is it.  My husband was a big fan and he can be picky!  The only things I did different were to rub the butter mix only under the skin on the "bottom" side of the chicken (not the breast side) and roasted it breast side down.   I also roasted for a little longer, to 175 instead of 165, and did tent the chicken so the bacon wouldn't burn.  Made gravy with the drippings....delicious.

I halved the pepper and thyme,doubled the paprika.
This is one of best chicken dishes I made lately.I had a quarter leg and 2 boneless breasts.Started the bone in 1/2 before the breastsThese came out tender and juciy.Next time i will half the oregano.This one's a keeper.

This was very tasty.   I actually loved it.   I didn't have cumin so I left that out.  However it has way too much pepper.  With less pepper it would be a 5star.  I used the same spice mix for lamb I cooked and it was even better than on the chicken.
Update:  looks like they reduced the pepper from 2 tablespoons to teaspoons! much better

I will never make chicken without bacon again! Ive never used bacon on chicken before. Didn't know what I was missing. I didn't care for the cumin. I,ll leave it out next time. Everything else was great. Will be making this many, many, many times. The chicken was very moist too. I used b/s breast tenders.

I did not make any changes and it came out wonderful. Had to increase the cooking a bit but that is just my oven.
