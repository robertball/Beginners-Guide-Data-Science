For some reason,  the top layer didn't firm up.  I also didn't like the fact that the jello was salty.

I tried making lime under the sea but changed a couple of ingriedients. First I made 1/2 of the 3oz. jello and let it firm completely.  Then I mixed the cream cheese, nuts, and pineapple juice/ tiny bits of pineapple (instead of pears) and let it slightly set on top.  Then I flipped it over to make it appear to be under the sea...  I really liked your recipe, but I think the pineapple is a better choice

This is an old favorite of our family, and having misplaced the "Joys of Jello" book containing it, am pleased to find it!  Sorry someone found it salty, but perhaps some ingredient you used was not best quality -- the one thing you do  have to be careful about is to make sure the first layer is "just" set, so that the second will adhere.

Very good standby salad.  Have made this for years for my kids who are now in their 30's.  Originally I found it in an Amish cookbook - always good.  Super simple.

This has always been one of my favorite Jello mold recipes! If made correctly, it is delicious. There should be no salty taste at all.

Followed  the recipe to a T , but the top layer did not set. 8 hours in the fridge, and still runny. 

I'm wondering if the fresh ginger caused the top layer not to set up?
