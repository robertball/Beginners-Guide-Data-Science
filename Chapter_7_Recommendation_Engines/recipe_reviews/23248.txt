This recipe was very delicious and it looked beautiful when served on a platter. This dish is easy enough for everyday but also would wow your guests if you made it for company. Thumbs up!

This is a FABULOUS recipe. VERY easy, as well as low fat, fragrant, and lovely to present. One guest, a gourmet restaurant owner & chef, said he'd be proud to serve this one in his restaurant. I browned the tenderloins before roasting. Didn't have dried sage leaves, but had powdered sage, which worked fine. Also added a good crush (about 1+ tablespoon) of Herbes de Provence (thyme, rosemary, basil, marjoram, sage, fennel blend). The tiny dab of pork & beas leftover the next day tasted even richer, which leads me to think it'd be great to prepare the bean/artichoke/tomato/herb mixture ahead of time to let the flavors "marry." That would also reduce pre-dinner prep time and counter clutter. Used a meat thermometer to assure the pork wouldn't overcook. Kudos to this "keeper!"

Terrific, delicious recipe. Used two small tenderloins and put minced garlic in the slits. Also, sprinkled on seasoning salt, black pepper (freshly ground) and LOTS of dried sage. Used a lot more sage than called for, maybe 6-7 times more. Rub the sage into the meat. Put a little olive oil in a skillet and brown all sides. Do not drain the beans. I had no problems with a lack of liquid because I didn't drain the beans and I added some chicken broth (use your judgement on this one, I used maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup). I don't think it would be kid friendly, at least with my kids who detest beans and everything else in this recipe. If I were to serve this to adult guests, I would make it part of a Northern Italian feast, sort of a Tuscany kind of thing. I can see large loaves of bread, bowls being passed around. Went great with a Chianti.

I browned the tenderloin first and thought it added a great deal of flavor. The recipe was delicious and I will make it again. Next time, however, I would add some flour and broth....I missed a sauce to blend the meat to the other ingredients.

I made this recipe exactly as described (except I did not include the lemon peel), and it was wonderful.  The only change I would make next time is to make more of the bean mixture.

Could not have been simpler to make! Very attractive.  I was only making one pork tenderloin for the two of us so I used 1 can of beans (partially drained), one can of artichokes (drained) and one can of tomatoes (not drained).  It was perfect for us - looking forward to eating the leftovers.  Served it with Creamed Onions and Sage which is on this site.  That is also a keeper!  Thanks submitter. Update - I love this recipe so much that I use it with pork chops too. Just season the chops with Goya seasoning, brown them a bit in a fry pan and then put them in the oven and cook according to size of chops.

I didn't expect so much flavor from such a simple, rustic dish.  The bean mixture was absolutely delicious, and the pork was tender and juicy.  Easy to put together, and fast!  Next time, I'll double all the non-meat ingredients because we have half the pork left (only because I didn't put it out on the serving platter!)... and nothing else.  One of our guests didn't even like beans, and he went back for thirds!

A great blend of flavors, and the pork was so tender.  The sage is a fantastic flavor.  This was my first allrecipies.com attempt, I am hooked!

Took a lot longer to cook than stated time.  I cooked a single 1.75 lb. tenderloin.  Maybe a pair of 1 pounders would have worked better.   Ended up having to remove pork from bean mixture and finish cooking alone because bean mixture was drying out.  Not much flavor in the pork but the bean mixture was tasty.

Excellent, easy and can be partially made ahead. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I browned the tenderloins in a pan before roasting (don't forget to reduce oven cooking time, though). Great flavours, good presentation. I used fresh sage and more of it than called for in the recipe.

VERY GOOD!  I don't think anyone would be disappointed in this recipe.  Great comfort food and easy to adapt to your own tastes once you've become familiar with the recipe.  Doesn't need any changes though!  :)

It had been a while since we made this.  My kids are early teens and liked it.  This was a quick/easy prep meal to make on a Sunday afternoon and will give us a "frozen meal" to use in a week or two as we only used 1/2 of the recipe. For my son who hates sauces, we just rinse off some of the pork and he was happy with just the pork.  My daughter loved the bean/tomato/artichoke mixture.  I noted one reviewer added Chicken Broth.  May try that next time instead of salt (recipe needs a little). We like lemon accents and used about 2 tsps of zest. Next time, I will try doubling the lemon zest to 1 rounded TBSP.  We tented our and cooked for an hour which seemed to work well and kept it from drying out. My wife always gives high marks to anything with beans in it because of they are really good for you.  For a busy family, considering the healthiness of this and ease of making, this gets high marks for us!

So simple and tasty to make a really nice dinner. I think next time I will add some other spices besides sage. I did brown the tenderloins like other reviewers suggested. I had no problem with the amount of liquid.

By the time my pork was done, my beans had no liquid left to them.  I also thought the garlic slivers detracted rather than enhanced the pork's flavor.  If I tried this again, I would brown the pork with garlic and keep a better eye on the beans, adding broth as necessary.

This is SO easy!  I made a few changes. I used the zest of 2 lemons, squeezed the lemon juice onto the vegetables, omitted the tomatoes and used a jar of roasted red peppers instead.  I also drained a can of pitted black olives and added those.  SO easy and SO good!

This was really easy to put together (besides dealing with the tenderloin itself) and tasted yummy!  An earlier reviewer suggested not draining the beans, but I thought that made too much juice/sauce.  I would follow the recipe -- draining the beans and artichoke hearts, but not draining the tomatoes.  Also, I would salt AND pepper the tenderloin before putting it in the oven.  The texture was perfect and the aroma and flavor were both wonderful!

This was delicious! I did not have sage (unforgiveable, but I live in a small town!) so I used an Italian herb blend and added one half teaspoon additional rosemary. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful! My mother-in-law's reaction is my benchmark, as she is very fussy about meals. She also loved this. She pointed out that this could easily use any plain, canned beans. Good to know. I definitely plan to make this, again. It was easy to fix after work, nutritious, and my family loved it; what more could you want?

This was pretty good - I give it four-minus stars since it's better than three but I debated on giving it four.  I made it in a slow cooker and the pork was tasty and fell apart because it was so tender.  I think next time I'd add the beans and artichoke hearts later in the process because they were very soft by the time we ate it.  I did substitute Rosemary for the Sage since I didn't have Sage in the house - the seasoning was still tasty, though.  The presentation was impressive - I spooned the veggies/beans & juice into a big shallow bowl and put the pork on top of it.  Pretty!  I'll probably make this again and try using Sage and also adding the beans/artichokes later, but I'll still use the crock pot.
